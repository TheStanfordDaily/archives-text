# Socialists Nominate Gouin As Head of Three-Party French Coalition Cabinet
## Communist Party Scores Victory; DeGaulle to Issue Two Statements Explaining Reasons for Retirement 
### 
PARIS, Jan. 22 (UP). â€” Felix
Gouin, Socialist speaker of the Na
tional Assembly, was nominated to
day to head a new French coalition
government of Communists, Social
ists and Popular Republicans.
Nomination of Gouin to succeed j
Gen. Charles DeGaulle was consid- ;
ered a victory for the Communists, j
who earlier in the day had refused j
the candidacy of Socialist Vincent )
Auriol and had refused to consider
anyone else but Gouin.
In advancing Gouin's candidacy to
break the three-day crisis that has
existed since DeGaulle resigned
suddenly Sunday afternoon, the
Communist political bureau de

clared that he was a "personality
over and above politics."
DeGaulle Explains
(A Radio Paris broadcast heard
by CBS said that DeGaulle would
release two statements to the press
after the new government was
formed, one stating his reasons for
his political retirement and the
other addressed to "the men who
joined him on June 18, 1940.")
Gouin had steadfastly refused to
accept the nomination throughout
the crisis. Late today, however, he
accepted when Socialists and Pop
ular Republicans agreed to his can
didacy.
After his acceptance, Gouin con
ferred with Communist leaders
Jacques Duclos and Maurice Tho
rez and Socialist chief Daniel
Mayer.
Substitute Speaker
One of the first acts of the Cham
ber of Deputies tomorrow will be
to nominate a new speaker to take
the place of Gouin. Communist
leaders agreed that since Gouin was
a Socialist, his place should be taken
by one of his party fellows.
Gouin was credited with the in
tention of forming an "integral"
three-party cabinet composed al
most exclusively of politicians and
without the numerous non - party
technicians of the DeGaulle govern
ment.
Gl-Year-Old Gouin
Gouin was born Oct. 4, 1884, at
Peypin in southern Bonches du
Rhone Department, the son of two
school teachers. After schooling and
law studies at Marseilles, he became
a member of the Marseille bar in
1907, although he never exercised
his profession.
In 1911 he was named counselor
general and in 1923 he was elected
mayor of Istres. He has been a
member of the Socialist party since
1904, and became Socialisl deputy
for Aix-en-Provence in 1924.
