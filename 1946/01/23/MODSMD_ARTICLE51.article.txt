## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 22 (UP).â€”
United States, Russia and Britain
announced jointly tonight that op
erable units of the German fleet
would be divided equally among the
Big Three. It was assumed here
that the United States would use
its share as "guinea pigs" in Army-
Navy tests of the atomic bomb on
surface forces.
The announcement said that the
decision to divide seaworthy units
of the fleet, including 30 submarines,
was made at the Berlin conference.
It also was decided that other units
would be destroyed.
A tri-partite Naval commission
was appointed and the three powers
are now considering its report.
The Navy disclosed on Jan. 15
that joint Army-Navy plans to test
atomic bombs on a huge naval task
force have been completed and
turned over to the joint chiefs of
staff, who will soon announce the
site, date and other details.
