# Kaiser Claims He Can Settle Steel Strike

### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 22 (UP).—Hen
ry J. Kaiser, war-time shipbuilder
and newly established automobile
manufacturer, said in an interview
tonight that he could settle the na
tionwide steel strike within 24 to
48 hours if both sides accepted him
as arbiter.
He was commenting on reports
that he might be asked to arbitrate
the wage dispute between most of
the industry and 750,000 striking
steelworkers. He could not confirm
these reports, he added.
Kaiser was in direct disagreement
with such leaders of steel as Ben
jamin F. Fairless, president of the
United States Steel Corporation. He
signed a contract Saturday with the
United Steelworkers (CIO) that
granted the workers of his Fontana,
Calif., steel mill an 18.5 cents an
hour wage increase—the figure sug
gested by President Truman for an
industrywide settlement. Fairless
rejected Mr. Truman's formula.
In his interview, Kaiser did not
j state specifically how he would set
j tie the strike should he be accepted
jas arbiter. But he said he "didn't
j think it was much of a problem"—
I was merely a matter of "making
j both sides listen to reason."
