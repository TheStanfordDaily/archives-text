# Murray charges Steel Industry. Can Kill Union
## 
### 
| PITTSBURGH, Jan. 22 (UP).â€”
, Philip Murray, president of the CIO
and leader of 750,000 striking steel
| workers, charged tonight that tax
i refunds "siphoned from the U.S.
' Treasury" would enable the steel
j industry to close shop in 1!)4G and
destroy labor unions in an attempt
to obtain uncontrolled profits.
As the effects of American labor's
greatest strike began to be felt in
allied branches of the steel indus

try, Murray sought legislative cor
rection of the Revenue Act of 1942,
which he said will enable industry
to collect $200,000,000 in tax re
funds and to break the strike.
The steel leader released the text
of a letter to Secretary of the Treas
ury Fred M. Vinson urging steps to
end conditions of the tax act which
"create special and unjust privileges
for the large corporations." Copies
were sent to legislative leaders of
both parties.
