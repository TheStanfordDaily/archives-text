# Labor Group Approves Fact-Finding Board Bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 (UP).â€”
The House Labor Committee today
approved, 10 to 8, an emasculated
version of the Administration bill
to set up fact-finding boards in la
bor disputes, thereby breaking the
long congressional deadlock on such
legislation.
Acting chairman Jennings Ran
dolph (D., W. Va.), who voted for
the measure, said he did so in order
to get some kind of bill to the floor.
This indicated there may be no re
strictions on amendments, although
the Rules Committee will decide
Lhat.
The measure originally requested
by President Truman would have
given the boards power to subpoena
company books and records and
would have provided a 30-day cool
ing-ofT period before a strike could
be called. The committee bill mere
ly provides that government agen
cies, at the request of the President,
should supply the boards with all
the information they have bearing
on a wage dispute. The cooling-off
provision also was eliminated.
