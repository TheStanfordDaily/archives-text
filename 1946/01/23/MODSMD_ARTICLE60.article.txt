# Short Says Washington Responsible
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 (UP).—
The congressional Pearl Harbor in
quiry committee today heard Maj.
Gen. Walter C. Short characterize
himself as the War Department's
"scapegoat" for the Dee. 7, 1941,
disaster, and then debated whether
it can complete its investigation by
Feb. 15.
Recovering from pneumonia, Gen.
Short appeared before the commit
tee just long enough to read a 15,-
000-word defense of his Hawaiian
army comfnand at the time of the
Japanese sneak attack. He was ex
cused until tomorrow while the 10-
man committee met in closed ses
sion to explore their chances for
winding up the hearings.
Kimmcl Claims Similar
Like his naval opposite and pred
ecessor on the stand, Rear Adm.
Husband E. Kimmel, Short blamed
Washington rather than himself for
the unprepared ness of the Army
and Navy when (he Japanese struck.
He asserted that in the four years
since the Pearl Harbor raid, he has
not been treated fairly. He insisted
that Washington needed an exam
ple, and that he was selected. But
the blame belongs in the capital, he
said, because he did not know, as
Washington did. that Pearl Harbor
was a likely target for Japan.
And like Kimmel, Short received
a spontaneous ovation from the
spectators who crowded the Senate
caucus room to hear his defense.
When the applause Subsided Chair
man Alben W. Barkley (D., Ky.)
cleared the hearing room and
brought the committee into execu
tive session.
''We discussed procedural mat
ters," he said afterward.
Hearings Over Feb. 15
Other members disclosed that the
Pel). 15 deadline—Congress has set
this as the expiration date for the
hearings—was the major concern of
the meeting.
Barkley said there was general
discussion of the "order of testi
mony" after Short has finished. He
emphasized that no decision was
reached and that the committee will
continue its discussion at 3:30 p.m.
tomorrow.
"I hope that we can come to some
decision by then," he said.
Group Near Agreement
Sen. Owen Brewster (R., Me.)
said one of the major points under
discussion was whether to accept
testimony by Kimmel and Short's
underlings given before previous
inquiries, or to have them appear
again.
The committee "almost reached
an agreement," he said, but he did
not clarify this statement.
Difficulties arose when two Dem
ocratic members—Reps. J. Bayard
Clark of North Carolina and John
W. Murphy of Pennsylvania—ob
jected to any limitation imposed on
the questioning of the supporting
witnesses.
Codes Played Large Part
It was revealed, meanwhile, that
in the longest committee executive
session to date, such matters as
the "winds" code messages, the
Roosevelt-Churchill messages, and
the part played by the Army and
Navy in the Philippines prior to the
war figured prominently.
The "winds" code messages refer
to weather broadcasts by the Japa

nese which were to tell their diplo
| mats abroad whether war had been
! decided upon against Britain, the
United States or Russia. The Roose
| velt - Churchill messages concern
J their pre-war meetings, such as the
| Atlantic Charter conference, and
were said by a committeeman to
I embrace some 1,500 documents.

And like Kimmel, Short received
a spontaneous ovation from the
spectators who crowded the Senate
caucus room to hear his defense.
When the applause Subsided Chair
man Alben W. Barkley (D., Ky.)
cleared the hearing room and
brought the committee into execu
tive session.
''We discussed procedural mat
ters," he said afterward.
Hearings Over Feb. 15
Other members disclosed that the
Pel). 15 deadline—Congress has set
this as the expiration date for the
hearings—was the major concern of
the meeting.
Barkley said there was general
discussion of the "order of testi
mony" after Short has finished. He
emphasized that no decision was
reached and that the committee will
continue its discussion at 3:30 p.m.
tomorrow.
"I hope that we can come to some
decision by then," he said.
Group Near Agreement
Sen. Owen Brewster (R., Me.)
said one of the major points under
discussion was whether to accept
testimony by Kimmel and Short's
underlings given before previous
inquiries, or to have them appear
again.
The committee "almost reached
an agreement," he said, but he did
not clarify this statement.
Difficulties arose when two Dem
ocratic members—Reps. J. Bayard
Clark of North Carolina and John
W. Murphy of Pennsylvania—ob
jected to any limitation imposed on
the questioning of the supporting
witnesses.
Codes Played Large Part
It was revealed, meanwhile, that
in the longest committee executive
session to date, such matters as
the "winds" code messages, the
Roosevelt-Churchill messages, and
the part played by the Army and
Navy in the Philippines prior to the
war figured prominently.
The "winds" code messages refer
to weather broadcasts by the Japa

nese which were to tell their diplo
| mats abroad whether war had been
! decided upon against Britain, the
United States or Russia. The Roose
| velt - Churchill messages concern
J their pre-war meetings, such as the
| Atlantic Charter conference, and
were said by a committeeman to
I embrace some 1,500 documents.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 (UP).—
The congressional Pearl Harbor in
quiry committee today heard Maj.
Gen. Walter C. Short characterize
himself as the War Department's
"scapegoat" for the Dee. 7, 1941,
disaster, and then debated whether
it can complete its investigation by
Feb. 15.
Recovering from pneumonia, Gen.
Short appeared before the commit
tee just long enough to read a 15,-
000-word defense of his Hawaiian
army comfnand at the time of the
Japanese sneak attack. He was ex
cused until tomorrow while the 10-
man committee met in closed ses
sion to explore their chances for
winding up the hearings.
Kimmcl Claims Similar
Like his naval opposite and pred
ecessor on the stand, Rear Adm.
Husband E. Kimmel, Short blamed
Washington rather than himself for
the unprepared ness of the Army
and Navy when (he Japanese struck.
He asserted that in the four years
since the Pearl Harbor raid, he has
not been treated fairly. He insisted
that Washington needed an exam
ple, and that he was selected. But
the blame belongs in the capital, he
said, because he did not know, as
Washington did. that Pearl Harbor
was a likely target for Japan.
