# Little Injun Weary! Please Share Rides
## 
### MARION MORROW 
Li'l Injun has been wearing his legs down to the ankles and further
the past few years.
This results from long hikes to and from Palo Alto on beautiful but
undeniably lengthy Palm Drive.
Li 1 Injun has also become an incurable eye-roller. This results from
rolling his eyes pleadingly after cars who pass hint by on the tradi
tional "share a ride" corners in Palo Alto, the History Corner, the
Bookstore, not to ignore the corners in between.
Visitors to the Farm have remarked on the extraordinary appearance
of ihese weary students who trot along Palm Drive and elsewhere with
no feet and their eye-balls rolling in front of them.
Hardened Stanfordites laugh coldly and say, "There used to be a
tradition about sharing rides to and from Palo Alto, but during the war
cars were scarce, and the tradition was neglected. Now people have for
gotten about it, so Li'l Injun practices track up and down the dusty
trails of Palm Drive."
Older and more sympathetic Stanfordites recall a story that proves
it's often the driver of the picker-upper car who benefits.
Back in 19 , they remember, there was a famous car on campus
named "Methuselah." Never forget, they stress, that "Methuselah" was no
ordinary auto, but possessed of an unusual and stimulating personality.
When "Methuselah s" rods rattled, or his carbon choked, or his generator
burned out, the campus noted and mourned en masse.
It was the practice of the owner of this never-forgotten car to al
ways pick up riders on the History Corner, Palo Alto, or wherever.
And several times, these old-timers insist, these riders helped "Methus
elah" back to campus with pushing brute force. The question is, how
would "Methuselah" ever have gotten back to campus at all if the
driver had not been considerate enough to pick up riders who helped
to push it there?
A story which grew out of the war years is told by a junior on campus.
It seems there was one girl no campus who had a mania for neatness.
She was not only neat in the obvious things like changing socks twice a
week and taking a bath on Saturday, but she washed her face 15 times
a day (by actual count), cleaned her room twice a day, emptied her waste
paper basket whenever there was anything in it.
Well, naturally, a girl this neat accumulated a lot of laundry during
the week, particularly since she changed the sheets on her bed much
oftener than most people on the Farm.
By the end of every week, her laundry bag was stuffed to the top
(with laundry), and since she used a good-sized bed sack for a bag,
the load she took to the laundry every week was pretty heavy.
Every Saturday she stood on the History Corner, waiting for a ride,
and since she was a frugal gal, when she didn't get a ride, she walked.
She didn't show the signs of this labor for two quarters. Then one day
she just didn't return from her weekly trip.
Friends began to worry. Then they discovered what had happened.
She had just been too tired to make the long trip back so she had
taken a job at the laundry. Of course, this meant that Stanford lost
8143 plus $195.50 a quarter, which is not hay, as you know.
By this time there's no doubt what the moral is of all this glub. You'd
feel simpully ghastly if you wore your legs down to the knees, or if your
eyes went rolling in front of you. or if you had to work in a laundry—pick
up riders, restore a Stanford tradition, feel that happy glow of Stanford
spirit inside you. 'Nuff said.

Hardened Stanfordites laugh coldly and say, "There used to be a
tradition about sharing rides to and from Palo Alto, but during the war
cars were scarce, and the tradition was neglected. Now people have for
gotten about it, so Li'l Injun practices track up and down the dusty
trails of Palm Drive."
Older and more sympathetic Stanfordites recall a story that proves
it's often the driver of the picker-upper car who benefits.
Back in 19 , they remember, there was a famous car on campus
named "Methuselah." Never forget, they stress, that "Methuselah" was no
ordinary auto, but possessed of an unusual and stimulating personality.
When "Methuselah s" rods rattled, or his carbon choked, or his generator
burned out, the campus noted and mourned en masse.
It was the practice of the owner of this never-forgotten car to al
ways pick up riders on the History Corner, Palo Alto, or wherever.
And several times, these old-timers insist, these riders helped "Methus
elah" back to campus with pushing brute force. The question is, how
would "Methuselah" ever have gotten back to campus at all if the
driver had not been considerate enough to pick up riders who helped
to push it there?
A story which grew out of the war years is told by a junior on campus.
It seems there was one girl no campus who had a mania for neatness.
She was not only neat in the obvious things like changing socks twice a
week and taking a bath on Saturday, but she washed her face 15 times
a day (by actual count), cleaned her room twice a day, emptied her waste
paper basket whenever there was anything in it.
Well, naturally, a girl this neat accumulated a lot of laundry during
the week, particularly since she changed the sheets on her bed much
oftener than most people on the Farm.
By the end of every week, her laundry bag was stuffed to the top
(with laundry), and since she used a good-sized bed sack for a bag,
the load she took to the laundry every week was pretty heavy.
Every Saturday she stood on the History Corner, waiting for a ride,
and since she was a frugal gal, when she didn't get a ride, she walked.
She didn't show the signs of this labor for two quarters. Then one day
she just didn't return from her weekly trip.
Friends began to worry. Then they discovered what had happened.
She had just been too tired to make the long trip back so she had
taken a job at the laundry. Of course, this meant that Stanford lost
8143 plus $195.50 a quarter, which is not hay, as you know.
By this time there's no doubt what the moral is of all this glub. You'd
feel simpully ghastly if you wore your legs down to the knees, or if your
eyes went rolling in front of you. or if you had to work in a laundry—pick
up riders, restore a Stanford tradition, feel that happy glow of Stanford
spirit inside you. 'Nuff said.

Li'l Injun has been wearing his legs down to the ankles and further
the past few years.
This results from long hikes to and from Palo Alto on beautiful but
undeniably lengthy Palm Drive.
Li 1 Injun has also become an incurable eye-roller. This results from
rolling his eyes pleadingly after cars who pass hint by on the tradi
tional "share a ride" corners in Palo Alto, the History Corner, the
Bookstore, not to ignore the corners in between.
Visitors to the Farm have remarked on the extraordinary appearance
of ihese weary students who trot along Palm Drive and elsewhere with
no feet and their eye-balls rolling in front of them.
