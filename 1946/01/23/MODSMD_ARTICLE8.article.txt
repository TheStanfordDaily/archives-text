# Seniors Carry Traditions Throughout School Year
## 
### NANCY BANNICK 
When Stanford students become
seniors, they carry on many tradi
i tional activities in memory of their
1 years at Stanford and the founding
I of the University. Senior Week is
I a time for getting together with all
. the members of the class and other
Stanford friends and acquaintances
before the class members leave
Stanford.
One tradition not confined to Sen
| ior Week is the placing of a wreath
of flowers every Sunday morning
; on the Mausoleum, the tomb of the
! founders. This is done by repre
sentatives of the senior class and is
handed down to the noxt class dur
ing the traditional pilgrimage to the
I Stanfords' tomb before graduation
j every spring.
Token of Gratitude
Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur
has said, "This tradition has real
carrying power; for it brings homo
to our young people this man and
woman and boy—this father, moth
er, and son—who had lived here on
this Stanford 'Farm,' who had en
joyed this same beauty that we now
enjoy of our fields and mountains—
and'out of whose suffering was born
j our great University. This observ
ance is a token of the enduring
gratitude of each generation of
I Stanford men and women."
On Commencement Day each
year, the records of the graduating
class, such things as the Quad,
Alumni Reviews, Dailies, Chappies.
I the will, history, poem, class scroll,
J and a record of the class gift to the
University, are placed in a tiny
I vault beneath a bronze plaque nam-
I ing each class year.
I The plaques are diamond-shaped
and are located in a long strip on

j the sidewalk before Memorial
Chapel.
