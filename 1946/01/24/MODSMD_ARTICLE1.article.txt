# Posies, Sweets Gifts In Lockout Tradition
## 
### MELLON SHELTON 
When the Mills Florist's carry-all drives up in front of some women's
living group, it's a pretty sure guess it's bringing a nosegay to a Stanford
woman. And it's also a pretty sure guess that some Stanford Rough is
observing one of the Farm's longest standing traditions: that of sending
flowers to his date if she had a lockout on THE night.
Incoming male students may not even know of the dire implications

in that word, lockout. Probably
good many Roughs of long standing !
still don't realize what a lockout
means to a Stanford woman.
Morale-Builders
But the Stanford woman knows, j
If she's even one minute late re
turning to her living group after i
closing hours or after the time she \
signed out for, she's minus one good I
night. The Committees of Nine, i
Five, and Seven, or Women's Coun- !
cil, rule that she must stay home
one night to make up for being late, j
And the later she is, the worse the
penalty.
So somewhere in the dim past,
Stanford Roughs adopted the cus- j
torn of sending flowers to their dates j
if they got lockouts. The women j
find it a good morale-builder to J
console them on the nights they're ■
locked in. And the men have
learned that flowers (or candy, if i
The Girl is allergic to posies) go a !
long way toward promoting their |
own prestige with Stanford women.
One time flowers are definitely
not the thing on the Farm, how
ever, is at dances. This, too, is a
tradition that originated long, long j
ago when some student governing '
body decided that purchasing cor- :
sages for student dances began to i
bum little holes in the pockets of ;
the average Stanford Rough. It was
also felt that the practice might tend
toward the undemocratic, since j
Roughs who couldn't afford corsages '
would feel at a disadvantage to
those who could. The idea stuck,
and corsages remain taboo to this j
flay.
Student-Faculty Friendship
Among other things that have !
helped promote unity of spirit and ,
feeling in the Stanford Family have 1
been the cementing of faculty-stu- j
dent friendships through various
ways. Less tangible than other tra
ditions previously defined, the very
fact that students and faculty have
found it mutually beneficial—and a j
great deal of fun—to meet each !
other on ground other than the
classroom is, in itself, one of Stan
ford's best-loved traditions.
Some ways by which student-fac
ulty friendships have been pro
moted or strengthened are open j
houses given by members of the \
faculty. Payson J. Treat, professor
emeritus of history, and Mrs. Treat, j
for example, have held open house j
for Stanford students and friends
every Thursday afternoon for the i
past 25 years.
Water Carnival Too
Some professors have entertained
small classes at their homes for af- j
ter-dinner coffee and an evening of j
talking. This has worked both
ways, when students have taken
their professors to dinner.
Faculty members have also taken
part in such student activities as the
Junior Water Carnival, the Spring
Sing, and other all-campus func
tions. Last year students played
faculty in a scries of student-fac
ulty tennis matches.
Faculty dinners at students' liv
ing groups have been a common ;
practice—and a popular one —ever j
since Stanford was started. Stan
ford students have found in such in- |
formal meetings a better chance to
know and enjoy their school, and j
the men and women who help make |
it what it is.
