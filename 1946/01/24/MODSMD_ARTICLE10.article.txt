# Tresidder Urges Defense Commission To Recommend Government Policies
## 
### 
A National Defense Commission
to investigate and recommend mea
ures for long-range governmental
policy in industry, education, health,
and other fields was advocated by
Stanford's President Donald B.
Tresidder in an address to the Los
Angeles Chamber of Commerce last
night,
Program Imperative
A so-called national defense pro
gram is imperative, according to Dr.
Tresidder, because "we dare not as
sume that thers will never be an
other war." We continue to live in
a dangerous world in which we are
impelled to follow the method of
'trust in God, but keep your pow
der dry," he said.
The proposed commission would
be made up of non-partisan mem
bers selected for their special
knowledge and broad experience in
large affairs, with authoritative rep
resentation for military, legislative,
educational, industrial, and diplo
matic establishments. Research
should be backed by adequate funds
and testimonies from experts in the
fields under consideration. The aim
of all planning should be strict
economy — of natural resources,
manpower, industry — contained
within our future financial limits.
Need for Planning
The need for long-range planning
is demonstrated by the wastes of

war and the inefficicncy of piecc
meal legislation. Education, health
of the people, and abundance of ma
terials for production arc neccssary
in a nation to which the whole
world looks with hope and faith,
oaid Dr. Tresiddcr. Only through

an integrated, large-scale program
can the United States hope to over
come the present national confusion
and achieve these objectives.
Decisive legislative action is nec
essary now, he continued, but
should come only after thorough in
vestigation of fact; Congress, for ex
ample, should not allow War De
partment officials to railroad through
any military conscription bill until
specific military needs for men and
training are known.
Interim Policy
An interim policy, one to guide
officials until the Commission has
reported, is necessary; "we must not
present to the world the disturbing
spectacle of a nation trying to solve
the urgent problems of peace in an
aura of disunity, doubt, suspicion,
fear, and indecision."
Dr. Tresidder calied for clear and
definite policies on domestic issues,
backed by demonstrable power for
enforcement. Domestic legislation
for atomic control must come soon,
to preserve national security until
the time when an effective inter
national control can be set up.
We Have Lagged
Furthermore, he said, we lagged
badly in the fundamental research
on atomic fission, and our security
demands that we immediately ac-

; .nents —more satisfactory for occu- i
! pation than conscripts—miss the j
necessary quotas, a modified form j
of selective service should bo ex- |
tended on a year-to-year basis.
Selective service must be truly i
selective, placing or retaining men j
in their most valuable fields of en

Tresidder in an address to the Los
Angeles Chamber of Commerce last
night,
Program Imperative
A so-called national defense pro
gram is imperative, according to Dr.
Tresidder, because "we dare not as
sume that thers will never be an
other war." We continue to live in
a dangerous world in which we are
impelled to follow the method of
'trust in God, but keep your pow
der dry," he said.
The proposed commission would
be made up of non-partisan mem
bers selected for their special
knowledge and broad experience in
large affairs, with authoritative rep
resentation for military, legislative,
educational, industrial, and diplo
matic establishments. Research
should be backed by adequate funds
and testimonies from experts in the
fields under consideration. The aim
of all planning should be strict
economy — of natural resources,
manpower, industry — contained
within our future financial limits.
Need for Planning
The need for long-range planning
is demonstrated by the wastes of

war and the inefficicncy of piecc
meal legislation. Education, health
of the people, and abundance of ma
terials for production arc neccssary
in a nation to which the whole
world looks with hope and faith,
oaid Dr. Tresiddcr. Only through

an integrated, large-scale program
can the United States hope to over
come the present national confusion
and achieve these objectives.
Decisive legislative action is nec
essary now, he continued, but
should come only after thorough in
vestigation of fact; Congress, for ex
ample, should not allow War De
partment officials to railroad through
any military conscription bill until
specific military needs for men and
training are known.
Interim Policy
An interim policy, one to guide
officials until the Commission has
reported, is necessary; "we must not
present to the world the disturbing
spectacle of a nation trying to solve
the urgent problems of peace in an
aura of disunity, doubt, suspicion,
fear, and indecision."
Dr. Tresidder calied for clear and
definite policies on domestic issues,
backed by demonstrable power for
enforcement. Domestic legislation
for atomic control must come soon,
to preserve national security until
the time when an effective inter
national control can be set up.
We Have Lagged
Furthermore, he said, we lagged
badly in the fundamental research
on atomic fission, and our security
demands that we immediately ac-
