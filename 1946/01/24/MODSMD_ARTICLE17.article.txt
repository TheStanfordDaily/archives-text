# Seminar Hears Whitaker Discuss Army University
## 
### 
The faculty for the two American
Army universities in Europe was
sent from 147 universities and col
leges in the United States of which
Stanford sent the second largest del
egation, totaling five men, accord
ing to Professor D. M. Whitaker,
speaker at the Biology Seminar yes
terday, who was chief of the science
department at Shrivcnham.
Last June Whitaker was called to
Washington where he helped select
the remainder of the faculty for the
universities located at Shrivcnham,
England, sixty miles from London,
and at Biarritz, France, near the
Spanish border.
Stanford Men
In addition to Professor Whitaker,
Clifford F. Weigle, associate profes
sor of journalism, and Willis H.
Johnson, professor of biology, were
at Shrivcnham while Hubert C.
Heffner, professor of dramatic lit
erature, and Gabor Szego, professor
of mathematics, all from Stanford,
are at Biarritz.
The original plans called for Army
instructors; however in a poll the
troops showed that they would pre
fer civilians. The ratio was then set
at (50 per cent civilians and 40 per
cent Army personnel; however,
there were even more civilians in
proportion.
University Education
The object of the program, said

Whitaker, was to provide university j
level education for soldiers await- j
ing return to the United States for
discharge or further duty.
Eight Week Quarters
The courses at the universities
lasted eight weeks in which 4,000 j
men including some women received â– 
training. There were two such
semesters at Shrivenham. which j
closed Dec. 5, and Biarritz is in its j
third at the present time.
The training was voluntary and
for enrollment a soldier had to have
superior credentials much as he !
would have to enter Stanford, ac- \
cording to Whitaker.
Curriculum
The universities offered subjects
in science, agriculture, commerce, |
education, fine arts, liberal arts, and
journalism. According to Whitaker
equipment for the laboratories wa?s
collected from everywhere when the
Army did not supply adequate ma
terials. A football team, symphony
concerts, a weekly newspaper, and j
a band were among the activities of
the schools.
The student response to the pro
gram was enthusiastic and virtually
the only problems that arose were
that the soldiers wanted to take
too many subjects and study too
long.
