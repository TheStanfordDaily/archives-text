# Yell Leaders Try outs Today
## 
### 
Two new assistant yol 1 leaders
are very much needed for Friday
night's game, announces Cardinals.
Any men interested in trying out
are urged to attend the tryouts this

afternoon from 1 to 3 in the Nitery.
When the yell leader, Newt Ar
nold, resigned last quarter Stan
ford rooters were left with two new
assistants, Charles Jackman and
Bill Lippincott. These two were to
run against each other for head
leader in the February election.
Since Jackman has resigned, Car
dinals appointed Lippincott acting
yell leader until the election when
he will be voted on by the student
body.
One yell leader is not enough to
carry on the Stanford spirit, and all
men, even those who have never led
yells before, should make some at
tempt at trying out today.


JOAN McDONOUOH, Cardinals
chairman.
