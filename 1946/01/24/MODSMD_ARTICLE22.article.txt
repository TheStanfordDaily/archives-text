# Boathouse Will Open February 1

### 
Boathouse days will be here again
February 1, as the lifeguards open
Stanford's lakeside resort to campus
swimmers and paddlers. This open
ing date was approved by Excom at
last night's meeting.
Application of Phi Delta Delia,
women's legal fraternity, for rein
statement after going inactive dur
ing the war was refused on the ba
sis of a qualifying clause in the or
ganization's constitution saying
"members shall be white women of
Christian faith." Bob Kenndy,
A.S.S.U. president, will write a let
ter to the parent organization rec
memending that the discriminatory
requirements be removed, illustrat
ing Stanford's position with the de
cision made last night.
Rally Coin may usner
In eight days, the Cellar recorded
$60.40 in walkouts.
Excom went on record to recom
mend that Rally Com be allowed to
usher at the Pavilion during bas
ketball games, and to favor a break
in the tradition which frowns on
basketball rallies. A letter to this
effect will be sent to the BAC.
Sponsorship of the quarterly Red
Dance will henceforth open to the
bids of campus organizations. In
the past three years Cardinals has
had exclusive sponsorship of the
dances, with the particular intent of
paying off the debt on the Boat
house now nearly accomplished.
