## Censorship for Cal? 
### 
It \v s with considerable surprise and dismay
11.. we? read of Assemblyman Thomas H. Wer
dei's resolution to the State Assembly yester
day asking for supervision and control of stu
dent publications on the Cal and UCLA
campi ses.
Assemblyman Werdel urged faculty control
of tb j -ippointment of editors and staffs and
.il supervision" of all student publica
tions. The resolution read, in part:
"Editorial and reportorial judgments are gov
erned by enthusiasms, passions, and prejudices
of youthful, immature minds, and the policies
too often reflect unsound, harmful ideas whose
influence is multiplied out of all proportions to
Ihe soundness of judgment of the youthful edi
tors.
"Stronger faculty control would prevent
harmful ideas among thousands of youthful
minds."
Perhaps we are jumping the gun somewhat
to gripe about the proposal of the Honorable
Assemblyman (R., Bakersfield). But the very
fact lhat such a resolution was presented indi
cate:; that the desire for regimentation of some
peo;.-lo by some means exists even among
members of our law-making bodies. Certainly
the "harmful ideas" lie with Assemblyman
Werdel, and not with the editors and staff
members cf the Daily Californian, the Daily
Bruin, and other publications on those cam
puses.
College newspapers serve a unique purpose
in the world of journalism. They exist not only
as a service to the students—many of whom
read no other daily paper regularly —but they
act as sounding boards of administrative, fac
ulty, and student opinion.
A fre9, uncensored, and intelligently pub
lished college newspaper can be as much of a
service Jo a university's governing board as it
is to the students.
If a college newspaper tails to fulfill the
service expected of it, then action rests with
the student body and not with the faculty ad
ministration, or the State Assembly.
Universities serve a purpose that furthers the
right of a student newspaper to publish freely
and without intimidation. They exist not only
for "book learning," but also to teach men and
women of college age how to think with clarity
and discernment, and how to live in a demo
cratic and free world.
The fact that college students are exposed to
ideas, many of them "harmful," is proof in itself
that they are on the right track towards getting
a liberal education. And if the students are
unable to know the difference between good
and bad, right and wrong, whether it is in a
student newspaper or anywhere else, then it is
the university which has failed—not the stu
dents.
Whether Assemblyman Werdel's resolution
was prompted by a desire to stifle any adverse
editorial comment concerning the January res
olution of the Board of Regents of the Univer
sity of California—which subjected to suspen
sion any student found to be advocating the
"overthrow of the United States government"
by violence—we don't know. We do know
that the resolution applies to Communists in
so far as they may advocate the above-men
tioned policy.
We have read no pro-Communist outpour
ings from either the editorial or news columns
of the Dailies Californian and Bruin. If those
are the "harmful ideas" Assembly Werdel re
fers to, he had best retire. We expect to read
none. Nor do we think that "enthusiasms, pas
sions, or prejudices of youthful, immature
minds" govern the publication of either of
those papers.
We don't think that the University of Cali
fornia is failing in its purpose, though Mr. Wer
del's resolution seems to indicate just that. V/e
do think, however, that any kind of administra
tive or faculty control of student publications
tantamount to censorship—would defeat the
purpose of the university: to educate the stu
dents of America to a free-thinking, democratic
way of life.—M.S.
