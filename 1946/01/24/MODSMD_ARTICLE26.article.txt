"BOLLICKAWOLLICKA BOP"—YET
To the Editor:
To one whose undergraduate days were spent at a
sophisticated and perhaps supercilious eastern univer
sity, where a delicately lifted eyebrow greeted any
spontaneous outburst of collegiate enthusiasm, where
"rah-rah boy" and "Joe College" were decidedly terms
of opprobrium, where Harvard or Princeton "big
games" had to vie with the counter-attraction of a
weekend in New York, your school spirit here at Stan
ford is refreshing.
The Daily editorial to the contrary notwithstand
ing, there is much evidence of exuberant support
for the Indians' hapless but earnest basketball team.
Before every game the die-hards, defying logic and
observation, negating the repeated evidence of their
senses, raise their' bloody but unbowed hopes in one
more undespairing effort to root their team home to
an inspired victory.
One cannot but admire such buoyancy, admire it
with a sigh of envy for its youthful resilience, its un
daunted optimism, as—phoenix-like—it arises anew
from the ashes of each defeat.
On the other hand, one can—and hereby does —take
exception to one of the methods by which each fervent
prayer for victory is expressed. Reference is made to
the obnoxious practice of organized bands of vandals
pasting stickers with such poetic injunctions as "Bol
lickawollicka the Bears" or "Bop the Bruins" on the
inoffensive windshields of parked cars. These are
enough to shake the loyalty of any Stanford graduate
student of as advanced years and soured humor as
your present correspondent, who must allot a quarter
of an hour's toil with wet cloth and razor blade re
moving the slogan of each imminent game.
Lest this objection seem in any wise to reflect an
absence of school spirit, the writer is willing to suf
fer the nervous strain of having to read these al
literative emanations on his windshield before each
game provided the committee which so enthusias
tically and inexorably pastes them there will vol
unteer to remove them after Stanford again tastes
the dust of defeat.
In the preposterous event that Stanford should win
a big game after its team members have been exposed
to the sight of reason-shattering phrases for days be
fore the contest, the writer will leave the damn thing
on his windshield and mutter into his beard, "Bollicka
wollicka Bop" five hundred times.
Fair Enough?
