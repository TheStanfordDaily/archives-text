### STANLEY WILSON 
I'm getting sick and tired of people complaining
about the housing conditions about campus. I don't
think things are as tough as everyone makes them out
to be. In the following 1 will mention just a few solu
tions to the problem, and I only hope the proper au
thorities take action on it.
Now in the first place, classes must be run on a
24-hour schedule. Half the students could go to
school at night and the other half in the daytime. As
one student crawls into bed in the evening, another
would he rolling out the other side and preparing to
go to class. The wake up system would lie an out
dated thing if this were to go into effect.
And not only that, the unemployment situation
would be greatly relieved. Twice as many professors,
hashers and janitors would have to be employed to
take care of the two shifts. And just think, Stanford
would have a greater enrollment, and the $143.00
checks would be rolling in at an accelerated rate.
Now, as regards the various places in which to house
everyone:
It's really not very hard. In the first place, Lagu
nita Lake could he filled with water the year round,
and the University could put in floating boathouses,
old LST's, or a discarded battleship. It would he
kind of tough holding the Junior Water Carnival, but
then we could figure that one out when the time
came.
Just as with the Lake accommodations, government
surplus commodities would be the answer in most
other cases. For example, about six beat up old Navy
blimps could be anchored atop the Hoover War Libe,
and that would take care of half the freshman class.
Encina would be outdated, as if it isn't now. Water
bagging would develop into a fine art. Students could
go to class either by parachute or by a hanging ladder.
And think of the keen pent-house dances that could
be given '"High atop the Hoover War Libe." The Mark
Hopkins would be dominated by this innovation.
And we must not forget the possibility of using
all the tree space, of which there is such an abund
ance. Tree houses were good enough for us when
we were kids—why not now? They couldn't he any
colder than open air sleeping porches!
The other idea I have would have to be adopted by
persons especially suited for it. It would have to be
an ex-coal miner or a submarine man. He would live
in the tunnels which run under the campus. His prob
lem of getting to class would be an easy one. Just run
up a ladder and out a man-hole and there he would
be, one step from Quad. Of course, this might tie up
the water system on campus, but what college student
drinks water anyhow?
Oh. yes, there arc plenty more, but space and edit
board limit me. As I said before, I don't see the real
problem at all. If only someone with a little inge
nuity and ambition would think these things out,
we all would be a happy lot. Think about it. What
is this problem everyone is talking ahoiU, anyway?

we were kids—why not now? They couldn't he any
colder than open air sleeping porches!
The other idea I have would have to be adopted by
persons especially suited for it. It would have to be
an ex-coal miner or a submarine man. He would live
in the tunnels which run under the campus. His prob
lem of getting to class would be an easy one. Just run
up a ladder and out a man-hole and there he would
be, one step from Quad. Of course, this might tie up
the water system on campus, but what college student
drinks water anyhow?
Oh. yes, there arc plenty more, but space and edit
board limit me. As I said before, I don't see the real
problem at all. If only someone with a little inge
nuity and ambition would think these things out,
we all would be a happy lot. Think about it. What
is this problem everyone is talking ahoiU, anyway?
I'm getting sick and tired of people complaining
about the housing conditions about campus. I don't
think things are as tough as everyone makes them out
to be. In the following 1 will mention just a few solu
tions to the problem, and I only hope the proper au
thorities take action on it.
Now in the first place, classes must be run on a
24-hour schedule. Half the students could go to
school at night and the other half in the daytime. As
one student crawls into bed in the evening, another
would he rolling out the other side and preparing to
go to class. The wake up system would lie an out
dated thing if this were to go into effect.
And not only that, the unemployment situation
would be greatly relieved. Twice as many professors,
hashers and janitors would have to be employed to
take care of the two shifts. And just think, Stanford
would have a greater enrollment, and the $143.00
checks would be rolling in at an accelerated rate.
Now, as regards the various places in which to house
everyone:
It's really not very hard. In the first place, Lagu
nita Lake could he filled with water the year round,
and the University could put in floating boathouses,
old LST's, or a discarded battleship. It would he
kind of tough holding the Junior Water Carnival, but
then we could figure that one out when the time
came.
Just as with the Lake accommodations, government
surplus commodities would be the answer in most
other cases. For example, about six beat up old Navy
blimps could be anchored atop the Hoover War Libe,
and that would take care of half the freshman class.
Encina would be outdated, as if it isn't now. Water
bagging would develop into a fine art. Students could
go to class either by parachute or by a hanging ladder.
And think of the keen pent-house dances that could
be given '"High atop the Hoover War Libe." The Mark
Hopkins would be dominated by this innovation.
And we must not forget the possibility of using
all the tree space, of which there is such an abund
ance. Tree houses were good enough for us when
we were kids—why not now? They couldn't he any
colder than open air sleeping porches!
