### ELLIOTT EPSTEEN 
A slrike is n war of rival poeketbooks. The side with
the biggest bank account wins. The corporations have
insurance in the form of the new tax legislation, but
the unions have nothing save slim savings of their
members and strike benefits.
In the face of this, the nation's union leaders must
have banked on something when they called their
strikes. That was probably the war powers act, which
allows the president to seize a vital industry if it is
tied up in a labor dispute.
What Government Action
Well, the government is moving in on the packing
houses, and some sources report that the steel mills
will come next. But what will the government do
about the union wage demands?
President Truman's fact finding boards are working
hard in all cases, and they will continue to work after
government seizure. These have worked out rea
sonable formulas, and organizer! labor has usually been
satisfied with them.
The use of the war powers net might salve the labor
situation now, but for how long?
Inflation and Wages
However, new rises in the cost of living can ofTset
everything accomplished now. The war powers act
will not stay in force forever. If the unions strike
again, the next battle might be to the finish.
