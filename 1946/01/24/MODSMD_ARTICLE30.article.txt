"The Yogi and the Commissar" —
Arthur Koestler. The Macmillan
Company. 1945.
If all political authors were as
easy to read as Arthur Koestler,
then political immaturity would al
most disappear. In "The Yogi and
the Comissar," Koestler runs a
gamut of Leftist topics, from some
tea-tjme generalities to the statistics
on Soviet education, without losing
iny customers on the trip. To quote
(he preface: "Some of the essays in
this volume were originally written
for American magazines where . . .
each point has to be driven home
with the sledge-hammer; others for
the polished columns of Horizon
where the correct instrument to
use is a nail-file." On reading, it is
clear he is a terror with both. He
never descends to glibness, though,
and he never has recourse to the
favorite tool of the less sincere Rus
sian critics, namely, the stiletto.
Nail-File Manner
"Meanderings," the first portion,
is Koestler in his nail-file phase.
The smaller essays, while well writ
ten and absorbing, could have been
written by any sane Leftist with a
literary, manner, and it is only in
the two main essays of this group,
"The Yogi and the Commissar" and
"The Intelligentsia," that Koestler's
versatility and individuality appear.
He has a passion for psychological
analysis, and in the pinch, he is
more likely to be quoting from
Freud than Marx for his authority.
In the former essay he tries to
delineate the two fundamental
components of which our political
personalities are composed. These
are the Yogi, or "change from
within" type, and the Commissar,
or "change from external pres
sure" type. They culminate in
passive resistance 011 one hand
and political butcherings on the
other (any less drastic position is
only a compromise, tight-rope
walking between the extremes).
Both are confronted with the di
lemma of means vs. ends, and in
practice an ideology must include
both if it is to survive and retain
adherents at the same time.
"The Intelligentsia" may have a
slightly restricted audience, for the
word has become an obscenity in
this country, but Koestler knifes
through the prejudice with straight
talk. He points to the inability of
the independent-thinking portion of
the population to stimulate the re
mainder. and its bankruptcy of
practical initiative. But he is criti
cizing with compassion: "To sneer

at Ihe intelligentsia and, while de
priving it of the responsibility of
action, shove on to it the responsi
bility of failure, is either thought
less stupidity or a maneuver with
obvious motives."
But the bombshell bursts in the
third part, "Explorations." Here
Koestler parts company with affili
ated radicals of any description. He
refuses to negotiate the sharp turns
in the path of any one Leftist sect,
and he sets up his private fortress
in No-Man's Land. It must have
been no easy matter to break with
many former comrades of the Span
ish Civil War, yet if anyone has
made this break gracefully, and
without malice, it is Koestler.
He stands completely apart from
the Max Eastmans and Alexander
Barmines who discontentedly grind
an anti-Russian axe at the least
pretense of impartiality.
Flanked by two semi-psychologi
cal essays, "The Soviet Myth and
Reality" is the meat of the book, the
hard core of facts around which
Koestler's opinions have clustered.
In it, Koestler outlines the six ma
jor points of the Stalinists, present
ed for once rationally and accu
rately.
After carefully building this Sta
linist straw man, however, he
knocks it down — more wistfully
than zestfully — knocks it down
firmer than I have ever seen it done
before. This is not a phoney wist
fulness, and the sincerity with
which he undertakes his patently
unpleasant task makes his conclu
sions appear all the more urgent.
His criticism has its weak
points, and occasionally he tries
to draw more conclusions from
harmless figures than they will
reasonably allow. Hut his main
points are unassailable, and his
sincerity is unquestioned.
Most appealing of all, for those in
toxicated with the "Russian Myth,"
his logic is like a healer's knife,
which cuts painlessly and clean; no
reactionary will ever quote Koestler
to his own ends, for his criticism of
the Stalin regime intimately em
bodies his fundamental radicalism.

"The Yogi and the Commissar" —
Arthur Koestler. The Macmillan
Company. 1945.
If all political authors were as
easy to read as Arthur Koestler,
then political immaturity would al
most disappear. In "The Yogi and
the Comissar," Koestler runs a
gamut of Leftist topics, from some
tea-tjme generalities to the statistics
on Soviet education, without losing
iny customers on the trip. To quote
(he preface: "Some of the essays in
this volume were originally written
for American magazines where . . .
each point has to be driven home
with the sledge-hammer; others for
the polished columns of Horizon
where the correct instrument to
use is a nail-file." On reading, it is
clear he is a terror with both. He
never descends to glibness, though,
and he never has recourse to the
favorite tool of the less sincere Rus
sian critics, namely, the stiletto.
Nail-File Manner
"Meanderings," the first portion,
is Koestler in his nail-file phase.
The smaller essays, while well writ
ten and absorbing, could have been
written by any sane Leftist with a
literary, manner, and it is only in
the two main essays of this group,
"The Yogi and the Commissar" and
"The Intelligentsia," that Koestler's
versatility and individuality appear.
He has a passion for psychological
analysis, and in the pinch, he is
more likely to be quoting from
Freud than Marx for his authority.
In the former essay he tries to
delineate the two fundamental
components of which our political
personalities are composed. These
are the Yogi, or "change from
within" type, and the Commissar,
or "change from external pres
sure" type. They culminate in
passive resistance 011 one hand
and political butcherings on the
other (any less drastic position is
only a compromise, tight-rope
walking between the extremes).
Both are confronted with the di
lemma of means vs. ends, and in
practice an ideology must include
both if it is to survive and retain
adherents at the same time.
"The Intelligentsia" may have a
slightly restricted audience, for the
word has become an obscenity in
this country, but Koestler knifes
through the prejudice with straight
talk. He points to the inability of
the independent-thinking portion of
the population to stimulate the re
mainder. and its bankruptcy of
practical initiative. But he is criti
cizing with compassion: "To sneer

at Ihe intelligentsia and, while de
priving it of the responsibility of
action, shove on to it the responsi
bility of failure, is either thought
less stupidity or a maneuver with
obvious motives."
But the bombshell bursts in the
third part, "Explorations." Here
Koestler parts company with affili
ated radicals of any description. He
refuses to negotiate the sharp turns
in the path of any one Leftist sect,
and he sets up his private fortress
in No-Man's Land. It must have
been no easy matter to break with
many former comrades of the Span
ish Civil War, yet if anyone has
made this break gracefully, and
without malice, it is Koestler.
He stands completely apart from
the Max Eastmans and Alexander
Barmines who discontentedly grind
an anti-Russian axe at the least
pretense of impartiality.
Flanked by two semi-psychologi
cal essays, "The Soviet Myth and
Reality" is the meat of the book, the
hard core of facts around which
Koestler's opinions have clustered.
In it, Koestler outlines the six ma
jor points of the Stalinists, present
ed for once rationally and accu
rately.
After carefully building this Sta
linist straw man, however, he
knocks it down — more wistfully
than zestfully — knocks it down
firmer than I have ever seen it done
before. This is not a phoney wist
fulness, and the sincerity with
which he undertakes his patently
unpleasant task makes his conclu
sions appear all the more urgent.
His criticism has its weak
points, and occasionally he tries
to draw more conclusions from
harmless figures than they will
reasonably allow. Hut his main
points are unassailable, and his
sincerity is unquestioned.

"The Yogi and the Commissar" —
Arthur Koestler. The Macmillan
Company. 1945.
If all political authors were as
easy to read as Arthur Koestler,
then political immaturity would al
most disappear. In "The Yogi and
the Comissar," Koestler runs a
gamut of Leftist topics, from some
tea-tjme generalities to the statistics
on Soviet education, without losing
iny customers on the trip. To quote
(he preface: "Some of the essays in
this volume were originally written
for American magazines where . . .
each point has to be driven home
with the sledge-hammer; others for
the polished columns of Horizon
where the correct instrument to
use is a nail-file." On reading, it is
clear he is a terror with both. He
never descends to glibness, though,
and he never has recourse to the
favorite tool of the less sincere Rus
sian critics, namely, the stiletto.
Nail-File Manner
"Meanderings," the first portion,
is Koestler in his nail-file phase.
The smaller essays, while well writ
ten and absorbing, could have been
written by any sane Leftist with a
literary, manner, and it is only in
the two main essays of this group,
"The Yogi and the Commissar" and
"The Intelligentsia," that Koestler's
versatility and individuality appear.
He has a passion for psychological
analysis, and in the pinch, he is
more likely to be quoting from
Freud than Marx for his authority.
In the former essay he tries to
delineate the two fundamental
components of which our political
personalities are composed. These
are the Yogi, or "change from
within" type, and the Commissar,
or "change from external pres
sure" type. They culminate in
passive resistance 011 one hand
and political butcherings on the
other (any less drastic position is
only a compromise, tight-rope
walking between the extremes).
Both are confronted with the di
lemma of means vs. ends, and in
practice an ideology must include
both if it is to survive and retain
adherents at the same time.
"The Intelligentsia" may have a
slightly restricted audience, for the
word has become an obscenity in
this country, but Koestler knifes
through the prejudice with straight
talk. He points to the inability of
the independent-thinking portion of
the population to stimulate the re
mainder. and its bankruptcy of
practical initiative. But he is criti
cizing with compassion: "To sneer

at Ihe intelligentsia and, while de
priving it of the responsibility of
action, shove on to it the responsi
bility of failure, is either thought
less stupidity or a maneuver with
obvious motives."
But the bombshell bursts in the
third part, "Explorations." Here
Koestler parts company with affili
ated radicals of any description. He
refuses to negotiate the sharp turns
in the path of any one Leftist sect,
and he sets up his private fortress
in No-Man's Land. It must have
been no easy matter to break with
many former comrades of the Span
ish Civil War, yet if anyone has
made this break gracefully, and
without malice, it is Koestler.
He stands completely apart from
the Max Eastmans and Alexander
Barmines who discontentedly grind
an anti-Russian axe at the least
pretense of impartiality.
Flanked by two semi-psychologi
cal essays, "The Soviet Myth and
Reality" is the meat of the book, the
hard core of facts around which
Koestler's opinions have clustered.
In it, Koestler outlines the six ma
jor points of the Stalinists, present
ed for once rationally and accu
rately.
After carefully building this Sta
linist straw man, however, he
knocks it down — more wistfully
than zestfully — knocks it down
firmer than I have ever seen it done
before. This is not a phoney wist
fulness, and the sincerity with
which he undertakes his patently
unpleasant task makes his conclu
sions appear all the more urgent.
His criticism has its weak
points, and occasionally he tries
to draw more conclusions from
harmless figures than they will
reasonably allow. Hut his main
points are unassailable, and his
sincerity is unquestioned.
Most appealing of all, for those in
toxicated with the "Russian Myth,"
his logic is like a healer's knife,
which cuts painlessly and clean; no

to his own ends, for his criticism of
the Stalin regime intimately em
