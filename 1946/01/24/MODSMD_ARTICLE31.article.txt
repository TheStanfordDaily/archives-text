# World Atom Control Asked By Chapman
## 
### MARY VIRGINIA POND 
If the nations of the world in
the future resort to another war
to settle their differences, they
won't outlaw their best weapon,
the atom bomb, according to Se
ville Chapman, assistant profes
sor of physics at Stanford.
"One need not elaborate on the
effect of the atom bomb either on
war or on international politics,"
Mr. Chapman said. "Another war
will mean the destruction of the
world's largest cities and civiliza
tion as we know it."
"The solution to the problem lies
in international control of the atom
bomb," Mr. Chapman asserted.
'Placing the atom bomb in the
hands of an international control
would not mean that we would be
giving it to other nations to use,"
he ::aid.
In regard to the "atom-bomb
secret," Mr. Chapman claimed
there are no fundamental secrets
to keep, but only a certain amount
of engineering know-how that
other nations can discover if they
really try.
Under this situation, Mr. Chap
man contended, the United States
can make the first move, and added,
"Even though not more than a few
American Senators would approve
of world government, we can hope
that they might be made to realize
the destruction an atom bomb could
bring to cities like New York, Phil
adelphia, or Washington."
"The problem of control of atomic
weapons is much less involved than
the problem of world government,"
Mr. Chapman emphasized. "Not all
of us want world government, but
all are agreed that we want no
atomic war."
As a result, Mr. Chapman stated,
the American people need to make
their collective voices heard over
the voices of any pre-war isolation
ists. The Association for Interna
tional Atomic Control, he added, is
an organization being set up for
ihat purpose.
"The problem is to enlist the sup
port of the people as a whole," Mr.

Chapman stated. "The Association
for International Atomic Control i
has not as yet made any formal
drive for membership. However,
they will accept as members any
persons who subscribe to the fol
lowing 'Statement:
"'I advocate the establishment
now of an International Atomic
Control Authority as an agency of
the United Nations Organization,
which Authority shall have con- I
trol of: all atomic weapons, all
facilities for their manufacture,
and all their essential raw mate
rials.' "
If any person wishes to support
this statement, he may send hi. 1 -
name in to P.O. Box 2451, Stanford
University, California, and his name
will be addsd to the list of mem
bers.
Mr. Chapman pointed out that the
A.I.A.C. was forming plans to launch \
an organized membership drive next !
month. Other Stanford physics pro- !
lessors who are members of the :
committee working for the A.I.A.C. j
on the Stanford campus include Fe- 1
lix Bloeh, William W. Hansen, Paul |
H. Kirkpatrick, and David L. Web- !
