The football mystery at the University of California—Berke
ley extension—is slowly being cleared up. Earlier this week
publication of the gridiron schedule for next fall was announced.
Big surprise was the scheduling of the University of Wisconsin
for the season's opener in the Berkeley cement saucer.
The only cloud that still has to be cleared away is who is
going to handle the coaching reins of the Golden Bears. Stub
Allison was given the heave-ho a year ago, and last fall Buck
Shaw transferred headquarters from Santa Clara to Cal. But
Shaw signed up only on the agreement that he would leave
after his first season. He had previously inked a contract to
mentor the newly-formed San Francisco club in the All-Ameri
can pro circuit. The Bear's record this season was far from
enviable.
Starting out with a loss at the hands of the adroit St. Mary's
gang, they plowed their way through to average luck the rest of
the season. But never once, or at least from official circles, was
Shaw criticized for the mediocrity of the football team. Always
blame was thrown to the squad itself, and of the lack of talent
on it.
THEY COULDN'T KEEP SHAW
Some of the moguls at the University had rosy visions of
hanging on to the Notre Dame flash of years back, but Shaw
curtly replied that he was leaving the collegiate ranks to enter
the "pay-for-play" circle of gridiron society.
Since his leaving, rumors have been cropping up almost
daily on the new coach. First Charlie Erb, famous Cal quarter
back in the 20's was mentioned for the job. Then Don Faurot,
now at the University of Missouri, was said to be "in." So far
no one has been officially announced as the successor to Buck
Shaw.
CROCODILE TEARS TO THE COACH
The job the new varsity mentor will receive will be in part
a thankless job. For the last few years, football has been "de
emphasized" at the Berkeley institution, which explains for the
lack of success the Bears have had. Many people thought that
Dr. Sproul was following the same course at Cal that Dr. Robert
Hutchins followed at the University of Chicago. But the an
nouncement of the new schedule has apparently squelched that
story.
At the present Cal isn't to enter any contests away from home
that might keep the team away from their classes more than a
day or two. That rules out cross-country junkets, or more cor
rectly, it ruled out intersectional frays, for now teams can be
transported via air in less time than it takes to fight a traffic
jam on Vermont boulevard in Los Angeles.
It will be interesting to note what arrangements Cal makes
in 1947 for football games. And the question of the day still
remains: who is going to be the new coach.
Cal simply cannot turn their noses high in a weighty moral
fashion, and say that they are through with this crude business
of rounding up football players to perform for dear old Blue and
Gold. If they do, they'll find themselves in the same category
with Marin J.C., or Willow Hi. And I doubt if they want to do
that. In this competing business, Cal must compete with the
rest to stay in the league.
CLAGHORN'S THE NAME
And while on the subject, what is so unfashionable about re
cruiting football players? Schools have no qualms about seeking
outstanding students for their medical, or law departments. Why
should they shun athletes? If "scholastic sponging" is avoided,
and out-and-out cash gifts to players are omitted, athletes can
be of just as much credit to schools as any other student. Some
of the finest people ever turned out at Stanford, and other uni
versities, too, have been athletes.

be of just as much credit to schools as any other student. Some
of the finest people ever turned out at Stanford, and other uni
versities, too, have been athletes.

The football mystery at the University of California—Berke
ley extension—is slowly being cleared up. Earlier this week
publication of the gridiron schedule for next fall was announced.
Big surprise was the scheduling of the University of Wisconsin
for the season's opener in the Berkeley cement saucer.
The only cloud that still has to be cleared away is who is
going to handle the coaching reins of the Golden Bears. Stub
Allison was given the heave-ho a year ago, and last fall Buck
Shaw transferred headquarters from Santa Clara to Cal. But
Shaw signed up only on the agreement that he would leave
after his first season. He had previously inked a contract to
mentor the newly-formed San Francisco club in the All-Ameri
can pro circuit. The Bear's record this season was far from
enviable.
Starting out with a loss at the hands of the adroit St. Mary's
gang, they plowed their way through to average luck the rest of
the season. But never once, or at least from official circles, was
Shaw criticized for the mediocrity of the football team. Always
blame was thrown to the squad itself, and of the lack of talent
on it.
THEY COULDN'T KEEP SHAW
Some of the moguls at the University had rosy visions of
hanging on to the Notre Dame flash of years back, but Shaw
curtly replied that he was leaving the collegiate ranks to enter
the "pay-for-play" circle of gridiron society.
Since his leaving, rumors have been cropping up almost
daily on the new coach. First Charlie Erb, famous Cal quarter
back in the 20's was mentioned for the job. Then Don Faurot,
now at the University of Missouri, was said to be "in." So far
no one has been officially announced as the successor to Buck
Shaw.
CROCODILE TEARS TO THE COACH
The job the new varsity mentor will receive will be in part
a thankless job. For the last few years, football has been "de
emphasized" at the Berkeley institution, which explains for the
lack of success the Bears have had. Many people thought that
Dr. Sproul was following the same course at Cal that Dr. Robert
Hutchins followed at the University of Chicago. But the an
nouncement of the new schedule has apparently squelched that
story.
At the present Cal isn't to enter any contests away from home
that might keep the team away from their classes more than a
day or two. That rules out cross-country junkets, or more cor
rectly, it ruled out intersectional frays, for now teams can be
transported via air in less time than it takes to fight a traffic
jam on Vermont boulevard in Los Angeles.
It will be interesting to note what arrangements Cal makes
in 1947 for football games. And the question of the day still
remains: who is going to be the new coach.
Cal simply cannot turn their noses high in a weighty moral
fashion, and say that they are through with this crude business
of rounding up football players to perform for dear old Blue and
Gold. If they do, they'll find themselves in the same category
with Marin J.C., or Willow Hi. And I doubt if they want to do
that. In this competing business, Cal must compete with the
rest to stay in the league.
CLAGHORN'S THE NAME
And while on the subject, what is so unfashionable about re
cruiting football players? Schools have no qualms about seeking
outstanding students for their medical, or law departments. Why
should they shun athletes? If "scholastic sponging" is avoided,
and out-and-out cash gifts to players are omitted, athletes can
be of just as much credit to schools as any other student. Some
