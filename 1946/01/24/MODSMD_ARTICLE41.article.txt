# Luisetti Was National Scoring Champion on '37 Indian Team
## 
### RAY PASCOE 
After so many disastrous seasons
prior to this on?, we find in the
'37 basketeers the fruition of all our
dreams. They weren't "Vow Boys"
or anything, but they played terrific
basketball and with this play they
walked away with the Pacific Coast
Conference.
Leading this stellar quintet was
Hank Luisetti. This Italian lad went
zany on the court and broke all
kinds of shooting records, and fi
nally wound up as National Colle
giate scoring champ with a 652-
point record. Brother, that's some
tall shooting. Teaming up with
Hank was "Handsome Howie" Tur
ner, who besides his good looks had
speed to burn. Another vet of this
select group was Art "Stork" Stoe
fen, beanpole center. Back at the
guard slot for the third year was
"Dinty" Moore, all - conference
guard as a sophomore. The last
regular was Jack Calderwood, an
other all-coast ball hawk in the
previous year.
Barnstorming Successful
They started the season out in
terrific style by creating mayhem
on their little barnstorming trip.
First they took on seven foes and
emerged with seven scalps, and sec

| ondly they dumped the cream of
the Eastern crop, the big boys from
j Long Island University.
To get on with the conference
schedule, the Indian quintet took
on the U.C.L.A. Bruins first and
promptly drubbed them to the tune
of 03-40 and 69-39. Angelo got 17
: markers in the first melee and
wound up with 23 in the second en
counter.
Arch rival Cal was next, and they
felt the fury of the Big Red on
j slaught, 51-35, with Luisetti sink
ing 22 pointers. Still undefeated, the
Indians took on the perennial tough
Trojans and took it on the chin in
a close match. 42-39. Recovering
1 fast from a heartbreaker, the In
j dians came back strong and mauled
| S.C. 61-49. Luisetti scored 17 and
! 26 points respectively in the two
games.
The Bears came to town again
and went away on the bad end of
j the score, garnering 39 points to the
j Cardinals' 50. Hank only racked up
18 markers, (Must have been off
| his game.) Once more the Bruins
i felt the sting of the Stanford might
and succumbed 42-40 and 67-38.
Incidentally Luisetti made 20 and
21 points in the games.
Next came the big conference de-

I ciders. The Indians faced Troy mi
-1 nus guard Calderwood and with
i Luisetti and Stoefen ailing. But it
1 was Luisetti who eventually led
[ them on to double victory and
"Dinty" Moore who played the best
games of his career. His inspired
play helped the Indian men to take
the measure of the Trojans 39-34
and 47-38.
Having tucked away the South
ern Division championship, the In
dians trekked to Washington and
met the Staters in two rough
matches but after a hard fight came
out with the championship, winning
! 31-48 and 41-40. (Believe me, it was
j a pleasure to write up this season.)
