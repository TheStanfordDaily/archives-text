# Cardinals Win at Last! Defeat Mariners, 39-36
## 
### 
They won!
Stanford's varsity basketball team
finally ended on the large side of a
final score. Three points was the
winning margin as Coach Everett
Dean's smooth - working quintet
smeared the San Mateo Merchant
Mariners by a score of 39 to 36 at
the Pavilion last night.
Jumping off to a fast start, the In
dian cagers took the lead, but the
visitors came right back. Led by
Harman, a smart, tricky and fast
man who scored 15 for the evening,
the Merchant Marines pulled up
and away to lead 1(5 to 11 with sec
onds remaining in the first half.
Martin Top Scorer
But Gene Martin, who took high
point scoring honors for the evening
with 16 points, dropped three shots
in a row to give Stanford a tempo
rary lead. A foul shot by the Ca
dets tied the game 17-17 as the half
ended.
But the Cards weren't content to
stop there. Tom Hood came to life
and led a driving attack on the Mar
iners' bucket. Sinking shots from
all parts of the court, the home team
went ahead by a score of 23 to 19
within a few seconds. After the
Marines came back, the Dean-men
finally got up full steam and raced
to a nine-point lead.
But could Coach Dean, finally
within sniffing distance of his first
victory since the first San Jose State
game, sit back and enjoy the spec
tacle? Uh, uh! Harman and assist
ants came right back and gave him
the same old shudders. But timer
Bigge and his trusty 32 ended the
scoring spree.
Dean Rests Regulars
Making sure that his charges
would not be overtired for the
forthcoming conference series with
U.S.C., Coach Dean used his regu
lars sparingly and the substitutes
like Hood, who totaled 10 points in
the second half alone, did well.
However, Stanford's tape - covered
cagers—Murphy. Christiansen, Mar
tin, and Rodman —will again have

to carry the burden come Friday
and Saturday.
Making the evening a complete
success for the loyal handful of
Farm supporters who came out for
the game, the J.V. squad romped,
that is, to a 33-32 victory over the
San Mateo Juniors. Jack Wood,
who did a good job in both varsity
and J.V. games, came through with
nice play. High scoring honors went
to Ostrau of San Mateo, who made
15 points.—Millar and Welter
