# Humor Society's Birth Heralded by Earthquake
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
Forty years ago, late on the night
of the seventeenth of April, a group
of ambitious students, the big-wigs
of the Stanford Chaparral, gathered
together to organize the mother
chapter of Hammer and Coffin, the
honorary humor society. A few
hours later—early in the morning of
April 18, 1906 —dear old Mother Na
ture gave a twitch of that part of
her anatomy known as the Pacific
Coast. Thus within a few short
hours two memorable events
shocked the nation—the founding of
Hammer and Coffin and the start
of the San Francisco fire.
Mystery Meeting
The exact meeting place of the
group has not been left to posterity,
not because the founders were too
hazy afterward to remember it, but
because the following issue of
Chaparral was destroyed by the
sudden jolt. However, Hammer and
Coffin members swear even today
that the founding of their society
had no bearing upon the catastro

( phe of the earthquake. They dis
claim all responsibility and give
credit where credit is due.
The publication of the Chaparral
was started by Bristow Adams in
1900 and for several years the mag
azine passed from hand to mouth, so
to speak. In 1906. the staff felt that
the organization should have a more
stable foundation, and hit on the
idea of the Hammer and Coffin.
Professional Society
If the name Hammer and Coffin
has any hidden or mystic signifi
cance in its meaning, only the mem
bers have any knowledge of this
fact. It is not only an honor so
ciety, the members of which are
taken from the business, literary,
and art contributors to the Chapar
ral, but it is also a professional and
social organization.
The society has four fundamen
tal principles. It stands for clean
humor, co-operation with the ad
ministration of the University,
freedom from studnt politics, and
co-operation with the Hammer
and Coffin chapters of other uni
versities to form one unit.
National Organization
The Stanford chapter was the
| only one in existence until 1919. It
was then made a national organiza
t tion when eleven members from
j Stanford went to the University of
! Washington and formed a chapter
| there in conjunction with The Col-
I umns.
Since that time, chapters have
been formed all over the country.
There are chapters at the Univer
sity of Oregon, Oregon State, Uni
versity of Chicago, and Northwest
ern University, and even at the
University of California.
