# Railmen Stop Freight Strike
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Jan. 23 (UP). â€”A serious threat to the nation's transconti
nental rail freight service was partially averted late tonight when an elev
enth hour agreement canceled a scchedulcd Brotherhood of Railroad
Trainmen (Independent) strike against one of the two belt lines faced
with walkouts at 10:30 p.m. (CST).
William Bishop, vice-president of the BRT, and T. L. Green, general
manager of the Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad, jointly announced less
than three hours before the scheduled walkouts that the strike threat
against the Indiana Harbor system had been lifted.
Green, also general manager of Chicago Junction Railroad, the othei
belt line facing a walkout, and Bishop said talks were continuing in an
effort to solve the dispute which would shut down operations of the
system.
The BRT, in defiance of government intervention, had decided to go
ahead with the walkouts even though President Truman earlier had ap
pointed an emergency panel under the Railway Labor Act. The decision
to continue the walkouts had been made as A. F. Whitney, president of
the Brotherhood, indicated in Cleveland that a strike of 300,000 trainmen
and engineers against all the nation's railroads will be called in "two or
three weeks."
