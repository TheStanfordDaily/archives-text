# French Patch Up Crisis; Elect Socialist President
## 
### 
PARIS, Jan. 23 (UP). â€”Socialist Felix Gouin was elected president of
France's new three-party coalition government tonight by a vote of
41)7 out of 555 after eleventh-hour demands by Popular Republicans for
guarantees against Communist domination of the country.
Despite a patching up of differences demanded by the urgency of the
four-day-old government crisis, basic antagonisms still existed among the
major parties and some Frenchmen predicted that Gouin's government
would not last more than three weeks or a month.
A day of bitter wrangling preceded the election and negotiation be
tween the parties was expected to be resumed tonight in an effort to
reach agreement on details of the government program which still are
in dispute.
