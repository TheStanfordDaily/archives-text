### 
LONDON, Jan. 23 (UP). —The United States will urge before the United
Nations tomorrow that all colonial powers extend the benefit of the UNO
charter to the peoples they rule and make possible the realization of "the
legitimate aspirations of non-self-governing peoples," it was made known
tonight.
Representatives of the Big Five powers failed today in an attempt to
break a week's-long deadlock over the selection of a secretary general for
the United Nations Organization, but usually well-informed sources pre
dicted that agreement might be reached in a day or two.
Russia wants an eastern European for the important post and has sug
gested Stanoje Simic of Yugoslavia or Wincenty Rzymowski of Poland for
it. The United States and Great Britain prefer Lester B. Pearson, Canadian
ambassador at Washington, but there is some backing also for Trygve Lie,
Norway; Jan Masaryk, Czechoslovakia, and E. N. Van Kleffens, Nether
lands.
