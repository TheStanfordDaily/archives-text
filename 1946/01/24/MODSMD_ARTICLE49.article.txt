### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 (UP). â€”President Truman today ordered fed
eral seizure Saturday of struck packing houses in a move to avert a criti
cal meat shortage which already is being felt at millions of dinner tables.
The action will affect nearly 100 of the nation's biggest packing plants,
which produce about half of the normal meat supply. The plants have
been closed for eight days by a strike of 300,000 AFL and CIO packing
house workers seeking wage increases. Many small and independent pack
inghouses are not affected by the walkout.
It was the first time that the White House has made advance announce
ment of seizure plans. This was construed as indicating the Administration
hopes to settle the strike before Saturday and thus obviate seizure.
