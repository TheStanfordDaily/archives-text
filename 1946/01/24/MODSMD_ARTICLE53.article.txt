Many students do not know that
there is a place on campus where
they can rest in comfortable chairs
and study while listening to the
strains of their favorite music. It's
the Music Listening Room, room 14
upstairs in the Old Union.
This room is open Monday
through Friday from 1 to 6 p.m. and
Sunday from 1:30 to 3:30. Student
volunteer attendants are present to
play the records chosen by the lis
teners.

Volunteers working there this
quarter are Katie Orme, Mary-
Ethel Robinson, Nancy Wither
spoon, Tink Ryan, Jackie Pearl, Val
Bryant, Rosemary Hines, Vada
Flowers, Ruth Woolf, Marjorie
Ambler, Leslie Jones, Carolyn Mar
tin, and Bob Phillips.
At present the Music Listening
Room has over 100 albums of rec
ords, including a large collection of
Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, and
many other works ranging from
modern and light classical to sym
phonic and operatic records. Nu
merous scores have been loaned by
A 1 NovikofT, enabling those inter
ested to read, as well as hear, the
music.

request lists made by the listeners,
