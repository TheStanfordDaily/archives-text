# Weekend Features Two Dances, USC Ball Games
## Trojan Horse invades Cardinal Pavilion Tonight; Branner Dali Dance Follows Saturday Night's Game 
### 
Dali, walking tables, goldfish afloat in lucite lego, drapes staring in j
hundreds of different directions at once, and confirmed and converted j
surrealists will invade Branner tomorrow from 9:30 p.m. tu 1 a.m.
Dancing will be somewhat confused by Dalistic Hellzapoppin scenes,
according to Cathy Morris, Branner vice-president. "We guarantee that

there won't be a dull moment," said'
Miss Morris, "but if you really want
a little peace, you can wander out
in our inner court for hot dogs and
coffee."
Dali Fashion
Though dancers may wear any
thing from skirts and sweaters to
formals, they have been urged to
make themselves inconspicuously
conspicuous by dressing in the Dali
fashion. Hostesses, dressed as two
crossed eyes, will greet guests at
the door.
Dancers will be admitted only
when in possession of bids. Bids
were sold through Branner and the
A.S.S.U. office earlier in the week.
Dance Committees
Committee heads are as follows:

The Trojan Horse will meet the Indian Warriors tonight at 8 in the
Pavilion for the first game of its two-day sojourn on the Farm.
The Horse (also known as El Trojan and U.S.C.), ably handled by Coach
Sam Barry, carries an imposing array of talented manpower, including an
all-confcrencer and several new candidates for these hypothetical honors.

> Troy's lineup has been set. for
most of the season, the injury
plague being concentrated in this
locale and at Westwood, and will be
the same for tonight that it has been
for the past ten tilts or so.
A young giant, Jack Nichols by
name, who holds down the center
slot for the visitors is one of their
two spearheads. Nichols is current
ly holding down second spot in con
ference scoring with 84 points (four
points behind Cal's Andy Wolfe) for
six games, or a 14.0 average per
conflict. Nichols lias been all-con
ference center for the past two sea
sons.
Close behind with 74 points in
third place is Troy's freshman flash,
Bobby Kloppenberg. Kloppy, who
was the leader until last week, has
dumped in 172 points this season.
Paired with Kloppy at forward is
veteran Bob Webster.
At the guards will be Ernie Fili
berti, who missed the first S.C.-
Stanford series. Filiberti was a star
forward for the Alameda Coast
Guard team last season, and will
team with another ex-forward, Tom
Shan ley, who scored 16 points
against the Indians earlier this
reason.
The Trojans arrive in Paly this
morning with the smallest S.C.
traveling team in years, only ten
players accompanying Coach Barry.
The Stanford situation Li still se
rious, forward Jim Hill—who be
comes a civilian next week—being
| definitely sidelined for the series.
I Coach Everett Dean has indicated
that Martin, who performed won
; ders on the court aaginst San Ma
| teo Wednesday, will hold down one
I of the forward posts, while Jack
Meredith and Tom Hood, another
Wednesday's wonderman, will share
the other post's chores between
themselves.
At the center either Tom Murphy
or Bill O'Brien will start. Bill
Christiansen, who adds a " charley -
horse" to his other ailments, will
start at one guard, while Tom Rod
man or Jack Wood will open at the
other.
The "B's" raise the curtain both
nights, tangling with the Dibble
Hospital tonight and Marin J.C.
tomorrow night.
