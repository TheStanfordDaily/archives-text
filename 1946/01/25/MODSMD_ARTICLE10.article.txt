# Stanford Government by Students Among Highest of Farm Traditions; Resembles Federal Government in Flexibility
## 
### 
Ranking with the highest of Farm
traditions is that of student self
government. Student government
evolved with Stanford's growth;
originally in the hands of the Fae
ulty Committee on Student Affairs,
it passed to the President, and the
Deans, and from them into the
hands of the students themselves.
Today it is an active force on the
campus, governing every phase of
student life in relation to the stu
dent body.
The A.S.S.U. is patterned after
the same fundamental principles in
corporated in the federal govern
ment—division into executive, judi
cial ,and legislative branches.
Executive Branch
Heading the executive branch of
student government is the A.S.S.U.
president, elected from the student
body at large by all members of the
student body He (or she) presides
at all-campus meetings, appoints
student body committees, advises
governing committees of the A.S.-
S.U.'s many subsidiary organiza
tions, and represents the student
body at inter-school conferences.
Under the president is the vice
president, also elected from the stu

dent body at large. The post, usu
ally occupied by a woman, entails
chairmanship of the campus social
committee; keeping of the campus
date book; and attendance at Wom
en's Conference, Honor Code Stand
ing Committee, Sponsor - Choosing
Commit Ie", Nominating Committee,
j and Cardinals meetings.
i A.5.5.1 1 . Constitution
Under the trial A.S.S.U. constitu
tion, the vice-president succeeds the
president if he should leave school
before his term expires. These posts
arc currently occupied by Robert C.
Kennedy and Charmian Kolar.
Law-making body of the Asso
ciated Students is Executive Com
mittee. whose members, under the
trial constitution, are elected from
j their living group areas. Excom
meets every Wednesday night to
j formulate the policies which will
j determine the course of student
j government.
Judicial Councils
Excom is presided over by the
A.S.S.U. president, who may be
represented by the vice-president in
case of absence. In addition to the
; regularly elected members on Ex-
I com, there are several ex - officio

members who may advise but who
have no vote. These include the i
chairmen of Women's Conference,
Men's and Women's Councils, and
War Board, editor of the Daily, and
the student manager.
Judicial matters arc handled by
Men's and Women's Councils, who
determine penalties for violators of
the Farm's Honor Code. Long an
important pmt of student life, the
Honor Code and its observance by
the students is the base on which
rests Stanford's ability to maintain
a free and democratic student self
government.
Women's Conference
Women's Conference is in a class
by itself. Its functions are to dis
cuss and legislate on problems af
fecting women students alone. It
determines women's social regula
tions, delegating enforcement to
Women's Council.
All the officers heading the or- !
ganizations just mentioned arc '
electcd either by the student body j
or by the students whom they di- J
rectly concern. Other important stu- |
dent committees, such as Cardinals, j
Nominating Committee, and Spon- j
sol-Choosing Committee, are self

elective or appointed by the chief
I governing bodies.
Flexible Government
Student government at Stanford
is organized with flexibility, so that
it may adapt itself to changing con
ditions and needs on the Farm. This
is the fundamental criterion under
which any form of democratic gov
ernment can continue
But. the core of student govern
ment, its strength or weakness, de
pends entirely on the students
themselves. It is up to them to elect
capable officers to A.S.S.U. posi
tions. And although the average
| student may do little to determine
student policy, he is always free to
participate. Excom meetings are
open to the students, who may
speak freely on any subject up for
discussion.
St'idcnt Responsibility
The continuance of responsible
j student government rests ultimately
j with every student on the Farm. It
requires the interest and active par
ticipation of each member of the
I A.S.S.U. For at Stanford the gov
i ernment resides with the students
j and depends on them for success or
failure.—Shelton.
