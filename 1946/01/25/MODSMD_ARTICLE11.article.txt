# Poll on Housing Program Suggested for All Women
## 
### 
A suggestion for a poll to be given immediately to all girls on campus
in regard to their happiness in the residence in which they now live was
made at yesterday's meeting of Housing Committee.
The poll would be given so that each girl would have a chance to
express her opinion on the congeniality of her living group and

to offer suggestions for a better sys-*
tem of room drawing, house quo- j
tas, and class preferences.
These questions were brought ;
to the front when three members !
of the sophomore class attended j
the meeting and expressed their !
dissatisfaction with the present !
system of house quotas and class i
preferences.
A poll, they thought, would bring
fresh campus-wide opinion on the j
issue and ideas that could be incor- j
porated into Housing Committee's
plans. The poll could be repeated in j
a year, so the committee could see
the results and plan for the follow- j
ing year.
"People don't know and don't
understand what is Â«oing on." j
was one complaint. "They arc not
given enough chance to express i
their opinions and are not well !
acquainted with the program."
It was suggested that Housing
Committee be made an elective j
body so that the students rcpre- '
sented would be more in contact
with the committee.
Housing Committee members
decided that representatives from :
each living unit should explain i
Social Committee's open house
program to Roblc, Ventura, and j
o(T-campus women before the I
next open house, Feb. !>.
Guyla Runyan will represent Un
ion Residence; Anita Zimmerman,
Union Unit; Connie Wheeler, the
Row; and Ellie Brill, Lagunita.
