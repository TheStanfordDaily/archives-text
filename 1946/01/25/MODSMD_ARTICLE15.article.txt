Traditions are funny. Sometimes they fit
like a nicotine-stuffed Camel after dinner, other
times they fit about as well as a Virginia Round
before breakfast.
Some traditions are so important, however,
thai they actually make one gasp —these big,
important traditions that make people form
big, important decisions.
Take the girl, for instance, who has one
morning a week without an 8 a.m. class. She
turns over and groans when the alarm rings at
7 a.m. It's a dark, foggy morning.
She decides to sleep till 8 and regain her
libe lost composure. When she goes to so
called "late breakfast" she is served watery,
pink orange juice with dry toast and warmed
over coffee.
About 10 a.m. she's so hungry she has to
r<:..:oit to the Cellar lor breakfast. This, of
coiif ye, increases the congestion "in the Cellar,
not tp mention the walked-out-on Cellar checks.
The question is, why was she hungry at 10?
Because, and here's the jolt, there was a tradi
tion connected with that watery orange juice
and diy toast. *
li uuj friend had arisen with her 7 a.m. alarm
and had eaten at so-called "eaily breakfast"
:,h< would have been given at least a choice
between dry cereal and dry ioast.
iiui when she questions WHY she couldn't
have pickr-d up a dish with a box of dry cereal
on n at "late breakfast," she is informed, "Be
cause it's traditional not to have dry cereal at
late breakfast."
This is not scuttlebutt—it's a quote from one
of our dining room directors.
Well, guess our friend will just have to in
crease the congestion in the Cellar every
morning at 10. Traditions are made to be kept,
particularly when they're big and important
like not having dry cereal for late breakfast.
