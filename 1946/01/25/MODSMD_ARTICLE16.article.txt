# Bull Session

### DICK BOWER 
Walk into the sunlight and onto the grass in
front of the Libe. Throw down your Econ book
and forget about supply and demand curves
and people making money and losing it just
as fast. Sprawl out on the grass and let the
sunlight filter down upon you.
Listen to the crunch of footsteps on the gravel
and the trickle of water in the fountain. Listen
to the conversation around you. Some of it
pretty, some of it supposedly profound . . .
"Ralph called me up last night and we went
dov/n the highway and he tried to . . "She
comes from Kansas City, Missouri, the largest
meat-packing center in the world." "You find
the empirical formula by just dividing this
number by . . ." "Boy, is she ever stacked."
Listen to the gentle yet persistent hum of an
airplane as it pushes southward. Listen to the
clock while it tolls three hollow notes. Hear
the soft whirr of a swallow as it dips gracefully
downward. Catch the silly giggle of a girl,
the bored laughter of a boy, as they tell each
other they "haven't opened a book in a month."
Light a cigarette and watch the smoke dis
solve as it curls upward. . . . Try to think of the
name of that blonde from LA with the smile that
flashes on and off like a neon sign. . . . Feel
the wind as it gently brushes your side. . . .
Wonder how that horse in the third is doing.
. . . Remember T.S. Eliot and how he said "ev
erything ends, not with a bang, but with a
whimper." . . . Nov/ somebody's whistling
"Deep Purple," which you haven't heard since
your sophomore year in high school. ... It
seems so long ago . . .
Suddenly something soft hits your face.
Open your eye just in time to catch a bunch of
grass in your mouth. It's a friend of yours and
he's got one of those practical joker looks on
his face as he smirks, "Let's go out for a beer."
I did and that's why this Bull Session is so
full of tin-horn trash.
