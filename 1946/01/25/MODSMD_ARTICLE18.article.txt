UNO NOTES

The recent news from the UNO mostly points
out a series of forestalling moves by the Soviet.
Russia is trying to have a lot of investigation of
British activity in Greece and Indonesia so that,
if England accuses her of maltreating interna
tional law in Poland, Iran or the Balkans, it will
look like a case of the pot calling the kettle
black.
What she would do in case we started criti
cizing her might be a bit of a problem. But
our politicians, in propagandizing their inven
tion so thoroughly, have staked their electoral
future on it, and they are probably not willing
to precipitate too many open clashes on ac
count of that fact.
SIGNIFICANCE OF MOVES
The Soviet seems to be trying to propound
the thesis that the big powers are free to do
whatever they wish, subject only to the limita
tions they mutually negotiate in secret confer
ence, and the whole organization in general is
just to keep down any outside power trying to
attack them.
But to admit that much is to shatter the whole
thesis. A series of compromises between the
Big Three makes for synthetic unity. Things
go along all right for a while, but the members
are always trying to get an edge in bargaining
power, and are always afraid of what would
happen if their so-called Allies got too strong.
So, if another nation, on the outside, develops
a strong military force and a reputation for us
ing it intelligently and readily, it can maneuver
itself into big time power politics by playing
part of the Big Three off against the rest. The
UNO, meanwhile, is helpless.
SOVIET ATTACK
Obviously, Russia is not proposing this di
rectly. She is trying to show that so many oth
er people are stabilizing their spheres of influ
ence,- and doing what they want in them, that
none of them could blame any major power
for doing the same thing.
The fact that Britain is doing this, and that
America is trying to settle disputes, shows that
the organization is not too highly regarded in
international circles.
UNO ORGANIZATION
If the United Nations were to change the or
ganization so that it was a single house where
majority decision would bind all members, and
put all atom its disposal, it does not
seem that aggression by anybody would be
possible.
However this is not done. It seems that sov
ereignty and suspicion are still dominant in
international relations, and thus questions of
importance will still be settled by power poli
tics rather than cooperation.

But to admit that much is to shatter the whole
thesis. A series of compromises between the
Big Three makes for synthetic unity. Things
go along all right for a while, but the members
are always trying to get an edge in bargaining
power, and are always afraid of what would
happen if their so-called Allies got too strong.
So, if another nation, on the outside, develops
a strong military force and a reputation for us
ing it intelligently and readily, it can maneuver
itself into big time power politics by playing
part of the Big Three off against the rest. The
UNO, meanwhile, is helpless.
SOVIET ATTACK
Obviously, Russia is not proposing this di
rectly. She is trying to show that so many oth
er people are stabilizing their spheres of influ
ence,- and doing what they want in them, that
none of them could blame any major power
for doing the same thing.
The fact that Britain is doing this, and that
America is trying to settle disputes, shows that
the organization is not too highly regarded in
international circles.
UNO ORGANIZATION
If the United Nations were to change the or
ganization so that it was a single house where
majority decision would bind all members, and
put all atom its disposal, it does not
seem that aggression by anybody would be
possible.
However this is not done. It seems that sov
ereignty and suspicion are still dominant in
international relations, and thus questions of
importance will still be settled by power poli
tics rather than cooperation.
UNO NOTES

The recent news from the UNO mostly points
out a series of forestalling moves by the Soviet.
Russia is trying to have a lot of investigation of
British activity in Greece and Indonesia so that,
if England accuses her of maltreating interna
tional law in Poland, Iran or the Balkans, it will
look like a case of the pot calling the kettle
black.
What she would do in case we started criti
cizing her might be a bit of a problem. But
our politicians, in propagandizing their inven
tion so thoroughly, have staked their electoral
future on it, and they are probably not willing
to precipitate too many open clashes on ac
count of that fact.
SIGNIFICANCE OF MOVES
The Soviet seems to be trying to propound
the thesis that the big powers are free to do
whatever they wish, subject only to the limita
tions they mutually negotiate in secret confer
ence, and the whole organization in general is
just to keep down any outside power trying to
attack them.
But to admit that much is to shatter the whole
thesis. A series of compromises between the
Big Three makes for synthetic unity. Things
go along all right for a while, but the members
