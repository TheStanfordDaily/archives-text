Dear Editor:
I noticed under Campus Opinion yesterday an item
by Dr. Allen, in which he blamed the high schools and
the Army for Stanford's lack of a band. While the
Army and the high schools are undoubtedly factors, it
seems to me that this is side-stepping the issue. The
real reason, in my opinion, is that the Administration
does not care if Stanford has a band, or for that matter,
any music. Institutions which have far less enrollment
than Stanford has have very much larger music de
partments. People with musical ability just do not
come to Stanford, because they know that the Admin
istration will "frown" on their musical activities.
In short, the reason that Stanford docs not have a
band is that the Administration either does not want
one, or does not care. Letters to the Administration
would be much more effective in getting a band for
Stanford thai/ letters to your Board of Education.
Sincerely,
Nod C'hanin
