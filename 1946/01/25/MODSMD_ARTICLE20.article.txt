# NOTHING IS WRONG!

To the Editor:
What's wrong?
I don't think there's anything wrong! What could
possibly be a better sign of a healthy University than
4,ii00 continually nagging and griping, so called, Stan
ford "Men and Women"? Ask any of the 1,300 newly
returned vets if the surest sign of a high moraled outfit
isn't determined by the number of gripes per man per
minute. What else could have led our lads to victory?
Certainly not discipline or machines or B-29's!
What's wrong? Nothing. Every Stanford man, and
sometimes eVen gentleman, loves to see Stanford
women, ladies if you please, walking up the Row
or down a street, pulling on a Chesterfield. So do
Liggett and Meyers. Such lack of regard for Emily
is much better than causing Mrs. Stanford to be
come a whirling dervish by smoking on 'lie Quad;
hut why not both? Everyone at Stanford loves to
break the more genteel customs of civilization as
well as Stanford traditions: WE'RE ROU(ilIS!
What's wrong? I repeat, nothing. Every soldier,
sailor, or marine who has spent most of the past three
years waiting in line for chow, for pay, for church, for
passes, for trains, and even for answering nature's call,
revels while standing in another line in the Cellar to
have some pert little chic saucily pass him by and
break in at the front. And why not?
Ah, yes, there's good news tonight!
There's nothing wrong, nothing ihat is. Every
nature-loving Stanfordite particularly enjoys stand
ing on Eneina corner, idly waving his thumb at the
slowly sinking sun. And all this to watch a petite
philanthropist pass in a Cadillac car. Sure is inter
esting to watch the Fords go by and the signs say
there's one in his future, anyway.
These cannot be wrong! The courts of justice offer
no remedy for them. These are the things we love.
These are the things the newer lads and lassies will
learn to enjoy through their future years of enlighten
ment at STANFOIH)! R.W.R 'JI
