# Freshman Course History As Told
## 
### BARBARA LENDER 
Two Stanford freshmen are in
troduced. and the conversation
invariably begins, "Who do you
have for Civ?" A bond of sym
pathy is straightway established, '
and the friendship grows, fostered
by Burns and nurtured in the Civ
Libe.
The History of Western Civiliza
tion has just completed its first dec
ade as a required freshman course
at Stanford. History has been re
quired for 25 years, but it wasn't
until 1935 that Civ as it stands to
day was initiated into the curricu
lum.
In 1920. a University committee
was appointed to investigate the
curriculum. The report of that
committee laid the foundation for
the present lower division organi
zation, with its three-fold distri
bution.
At first, the history requirement
could be met in one of three ways:
history of Europe, United States, or
England, depending on the student's
work in high school.
Ten years ago this system was re
placed by the required civilization
course we have today. The Univer
sity believed that "every student
should study on a college level the
culture which is his inheritance,"
according to Dr. Carl F. Brand,
chairman of the course's adminis
trative committee.
"To present the whole picture
of the development of the West
ern world is something which can
be done only by history," Dr.
Brand said.
In order to achieve a broad view
of a period, the course selects from
the politics, economics, religion, phi
losophy, arts and science of the time
those things necessary for a com
plete perspective of the epoch.
For example, in studying Flor
ence of the Renaissance, "we study
Michelangelo as well as Machiavelli,
Savonarola as w r ?ll as the Medici,"
said Dr. Brand. He pointed out that
although material from many fields
is used, it is always employed as
history.
The course is organised into
sections which meet three times
a week. A lecture for all the sec
tions is given once a week in
Memorial Auditorium. It is inter
esting to note that the Western
Civ lecture presents the only op
portunity for the entire freshman
class to meet regularly.
Mst of the lectures are given by
members of the History Depart
mentâ€”usually in the field of spe
cialization of the professor con
cerned. Sometimes members of oth
er departments are invited to lec

] ture, and Dr. Brand remarked that
; they have been very generous in
their response.
A favorite rendezvous for Civ
I students is room 202, first floor of
1 the History building, afTcctionate-
J ly known as the Civ Libe. This is
a rather over-heated room with
a studious atmosphere, where one
can usually find fellow frosh
struggling with reading matter,
known in the course as "source
material."
This source material is employed
as a supplement to the text, and
constitutes the bulk of the reading.
The "raw materials" of history are
used, and students read great docu
ments in whole or in part, from
Babylon's Code of Hammurabi to
British Parliamentary Debates.
Over to one side of the Civ Libe
is a door guarded by the forbid
( ding sign, "Reserved for Students
on (lie Independent Study Plan."
Ordinary students watch rever
ently as the chosen few, who
j "have shown the greatest interest
and ability," pass through this
door to partake of the special re
; serves of knowledge.
The staff of Western Civilization
is administered by a committee from
! the History Department. The pres
! ent committee includes Professors
Carl F. Brand (chairman), Merrill
Spalding, Donald O'Malley, and Ed
ward White. Previous chairmen
have been Maxwell Savelle, David
Harris, and Harold Bradley.
' Student opinions on the course
I vary from enthusiasm to resigna
tion. A Roble freshman said,
"Civ? I think it's a good course.
You get a smattering of all kinds
of learning from the source read
ing."
, An N.R.O. who was questioned
I refused to comment for, as he re
i marked, "Mr. Evans might read the
Daily."
A lower division veteran mere
ly groaned at the mention of his
tory.
The majority of students, how
ever, eventually share the senti
ments of a girl on the Row who
took the course two years ago.
She said:
I "Although Civ seemed difficult at
| the time, I realize now how valu-
I able it has been to me. It gave me
I a useful background for all the
l fields I've gone into since then."
