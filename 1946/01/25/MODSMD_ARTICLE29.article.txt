Tonight in the Pavilion USC and
Stanford hook up in a return en
gagement—a la basketball. The way
bay area sport scribes have been
panning the 1946 edition of Cardinal
basketball playing, you'd think that
the Trojans would run rampant over
the fair Farm five.
But things aren't that had. No
siree. Our two previous games
with the basketeers of Southern
California were not run-away af
fairs. To "rehash" those early
conference games, our initial con
test with SC in the Shrine Audi
torium was a high-scoring game,
with the final score reading 62-49.
That was the game in which Jim
Hill scored 17 points. The second
tilt with USC lightened up consid
erably, and neither aggregation
broke loose for a high-scoring
spree.
Since those two games, injuries

j have plagued Coach Dean's men. Bill
J Christiansen—Mr. Adhesive Tape,
| himself—was slowed down by vari
j ious anatomical bumps. Bill O'Brien
i has never been in top-flight shape
because of trench feet that he got
while in Germany. Tom Rodman,
injured early in the season, is slow
ly rounding into shape, although he
is still sporting plenty of gauze.
This weekend the squad will he
in just as good shape, if not better,
than it has been all season. The
only man on sidelines is Jim Hill,
the diminutive player of the team.
Probable starting men are Gene
Martin, Bill Christianson, Tom
Murphy, Jack Meredith, and Tom
Rodman.
USC has been riding through the
| season without any injuries. Right
! now they're in a two-way deadlock
with Cal for top position in confer
; ence standing. Last week the two
! schools mixed in a twosome down
south, and each team came up with
a victory. Cal won the first night,
and the Trojans nabbed the second
tilt.
Hobby Kloppenhurg. sensational
frosh, spearheads the USC attack.
He was sort of bottled up against
Cal, but the boy is still plenty ca
pable of ringing the Pavilion bas
ket for a lot of points. Another
star from the SC campus is Jack .
Nichols, who towers to about six
and one-half feet. Last year he
was an All-Conference man, and
figures to turn in a repeat per
formance (his year.
For the last two series this writer
has boldly predicted that Stanford
would spring an upset. Well, unfor
tunately, both times we were wrong.
This week we have been spending a
lot of time trying to figure out who
is going to take the series. (We're
not one of these pessimists who ex
pects USC to trounce Stanford to
their own merry tune.)
So—here goes for this week-end.
USC will win Friday night by 11
points. The following night the
crystal bowl is a little hazy, and
we aren't venturing forth with any
brazen comments. But watchout!
Stanford will be "hot" that night.
Does anyone know what kind of
hozanna will be pulled off between
halves? Last Friday night four mai
dens pranced around in a demon
stration of plain and fancy fencing.
Our ace photographer, Herjp Nishino,
got a peach shot of the gals in ac
tion, and in case anyone's interested,
he is cordially invited to drop in
at the little Green Office in the Daily i
Shack, wherein all the sports copy j
originates. . . . Game time is 8. j
See'ya.
