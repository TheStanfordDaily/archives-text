# Individual Responsibility Keynote of Honor Code
## 
### 
By HELEN PINKERTON
The key to the success of the
Stanford Honor Code, during the
years it has been in operation here,
is its dependence upon individual
student responsibility. The sense of
personal honor based on the stu
dent's acceptance of the Fundamen
tal Standard, as his guide to action,
has its academic, application in the
Honor Code.
David Starr Jordan, Stanford's
first President, expressed the Fun
damental Standard, which lias
since become the essential spirit
of the University. It says, in part:
"Students arc expected to show
both within and without the Uni
versity such respect for order,
morality, personal honor and the
rights of others, as is demanded
of good citizens."
Individual and Collective
An individual and collective
pledge, the Honor Code is expressed
in Article X of the Constitution of
the Associated Students:
"1. That they will not give or
receive aid in examinations; that
they will not give or receive un
permitted aid in class work, in
the preparation of reports, or in
any other work that may he used
by the instructor as the basis of
grading.
"2. That they will do their
share and take an active part in
seeing to it that others as well as
themselves obey the spirit and the
letter of the Honor Code."
It is a contract of mutual faith
between the students and the Uni
versity. For its part, the University
refrains from proctoring examina
tions, or otherwise taking steps to
prevent the forms of dishonesty
mentioned above. During examina
tions the professor leaves the room,
asking as his assurance that each
student sign the pledge, "No un
permitted aid given or received."
Conduct of Exams
In order to ease the strain in ex
ams, the use of alternate seats is
suggested on the cover of exam
bluebooks. Smoking is not permit
ted in exam rooms â€”"breaks" can
be taken by students to smoke out
side the room.
Excom has approved a recom
mendation by the Honor Code
Standing Committee that students
refrain from taking their exams
out of the room if there arc
enough seats for all. But this is
not a rule. It is merely a safe
guard to the student, for expe
rience has shown that when ques
tions of violations occur, inno
cence can more easily be shown
when the exam has been taken in
the room provided.
This places the responsibility for

the conduct of the exam upon the
students as a collective undertaking.
The student pledges not only to ob
serve it himself, but to see that
others do likewise. This second re
sponsibility has come to be termed
"the third person responsibility."
Honor Code Violations
Honor Code Standing Committee
has said: "To some students who are
just entering Stanford, our use of
the third person responsibility may
be hard to understand at first. . . .
To them, may we say clearly and
definitely that Stanford men and
women do not tattle and are never
expected to at any time." The
Honor Code is a tradition that has
been built by generations of Stan
ford students. Any action which
tends to undermine it is destructive
of the entire structure.
The student is responsible, not for
reporting a violation of the code
himself, but for mentioning to the
suspected person that he has been
observed, in order that he may ap
pear before Men's or Women's
Council to clear himself. If a per
son's actions are doubtful, one may
speak to him after class or tap a
pencil on the desk to draw his at
tention to the fact that he has been
observed.
The offender may not be aware of
the violation. A friendly reminder
from a fellow student would have a
better effect upon him than a report
to the Council. If an offender does
not report himself, the observer
should report him to Council. This
is the only way to clear any doubt
about a person's integrity in a given
incident.
A.S.S.U. Council
Men's and Women's Councils are
separate, elective bodies elected to
handle Honor Code violations and
any other failure by students to
meet the standard of conduct set up
by the A.S.S.U. Councils' work is
designed to be constructive, helpful,
and educational rather than strictly
punitive. All proceedngs are held
in confidence.
The idea of the Honor Code came
from the Law School which first suc
cessfully introduced this practice.
The placing of trust in the students'
sense of honor proved to be so ad
mirable an achievement that cam
pus sentiment, favoring the general
adoption of a like policy, came to a
peak in 1921. Seventeen hundred
students signed individual petitions

asking for complete responsibility
for honesty in academic work.
The request was granted by Pres
ident Ray Lyman Wilbur, who ex
pressed satisfaction at this step ta
ken by the students toward liberal
education. Student machinery was
then set up to handle the responsi
bility.
The scholastic reputation of
Stanford depends to a great ex
tent upon the continued success
of the Honor Code. Each genera
tion of Stanford students has the
opportunity to maintain and to
strengthen the standard already
established.
