# Atomic Group Meets Tonight
## 
### 
Felix Bloch, professor of physics,
will be the guest speaker at the
meeting tonight of the Student As
sociation for Atomic Control at 7:45
in room 7 of the Education Building.
Mr. Bloch will discuss the ques
tion. "Why should the U.S. relin
quish its atomic secrets to a UNO
atomic committee?" according to
Charlie Clark, president.
Discussion
After the talk, the following state
ment will be put on the floor for
discussion: "Proposed: The UNO
atomic committee should be estab
lished with full disclosure of atomic
information including engineering
'know-how'."
From July 1942 to July 1945, Dr.
Bloch was a theoretical researcher
at the Los Alamos, New Mcxico,
plant of the atomic bomb project.
From there he joined the staff of
the Radio Research Institute at Har
vard, where anti-radar devices were
developed.
Mr. Bloch is a native of Zurich,
Switzerland, and has studied at the
Technischc Hochschulc in Zurich
and Leipzig. He has held fellow
ships at Utrecht, Copenhagen, and
Rome nnd is a fellow of the Physical
Society. He has been a member of
the Stanford faculty since 19154. He
is a member of the recently formed
Association for International Atom
ic Control.
Necessary Things
According to Dr. Bloch two things
are necessary to avoid world dis
aster: (1) international authority
which would have control of all
atomic weapons and their sources,
and (2) full power given to the au
thority to carry out its duties and
carry out its decisions.
Clark especially emphasizes that
everyone is cordially invited to at
tend the meetings and join in the
discussions whether he is a member
or not, and regardless of his ideas
concerning the control of the bomb.
