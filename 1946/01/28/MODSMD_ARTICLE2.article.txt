# Trojans Dump Indians Twice; Take Lead in Conference Race
## Stanford Seems Greatly Improved; Hood. Rodman, Murphy Stand Out 
### 
The Trojans of USC moved into first place in the Southern Division ol
the Pacific Coast Conference title race last Friday and Saturday nights,
when they dumped the Stanford Indians twice, 48-36, and 55-41.
The Cardinals looked like a much better team Friday night than they
have at any other time this year. Even with Jim Hill, the squad's top

scorer, out ol unitorm, tne team
looked good. With Gene Martin and
Tom Hood following their shots and
playing an inspirational backboard
game, the Indians got just as many
rebounds as the Trojans.
Murphy Outscorcs Nichols
Tom Murphy, starting at the cen
ter slot for the first time this sea
son, actually outscored the Trojans'
vaunted Jack Nichols in Friday's
game. Murphy dumped in three
whirling pivot shots and two free
shots for eight points while holding
Nichols to a mere one field goal. Bill
O'Brien didn't see any action until
the last part of Saturday's game, but
looked sensational in those five min
utes.
The two Trojan forwards, clever
little Bob Webster, and high scor
ing Bobby Kloppenburg, were just
too good for Stanford to handle Fri
day. Webster scored 21 points, most
of which were swishers from the
side of the keyhole. Kloppenburg
scored most of his 1.8 points on fast
breaks that found him all alone un
der the basket. Tom Rodman, due
to a badly-bandaged knee, found it
hard to keep up with the fast mov
ing Webster.
USC Holds Lead
The Trojans built up an early lead
only to have Tom Rodman sink
three long left-hand shots to cut
the lead to a fairly respectable 26-
17 halftime score. In the second half
USC maintained their lead all the
way. The closest the Indians could
come was at the 12-minute mark,
when they pulled to within eight
points. Martin was high point man
for Stanford with nine points. Rod
man and Murphy had eight, Hood
six, and Christiansen five.
The Saturday night game found
the Trojans taking the lead from the
very beginning. Everything the In
dians tried was wrong in the first
half. Their passing was spotty, their
shooting was off, and their back
board work was bad. Another fac-
tor in the Trojans' 32-13 halftime
advantage was Jack Nichols, who
broke away from Murphy and sank
five quick baskets.
Scoring Ebbs off in Second Half
At the start of the second half
Gene Martin bucketed three straight
baskets to cut the Trojan lead to 13
points where it remained most of
the game. Coach Everett Dean
started substituting very freely with
about five minutes to go, find the
scoring ebbed off decidedly.
Martin was again high man for
Stanford with nine points. Rodman,
Murphy, and O'Brien each had six,
Hood five, George Sloat four, Bill
Christiansen three, and Jack Wood
one. Kloppenburg had 17, Nichols
14, and Webster 9, for the Trojans.
Fiiibcrti Stops Brawl
A near brawl took place in the
second half of the second game,
when Wood got a headlock on Nich
ols during a wild scramble under
the Stanford basket. Nichols came
up ready to swing it out, but his
teammate Ernie Filiberti stepped in
between the two boys.
Kloppenburg's 35 points for the
series placed him back in the scor
ing lead of the conference with 109
points. Nichols' 21 points put him in
second place with 105 points. Andy
Wolfe of California, last week's
leader, did not play a conference
game this week, so still has an ex
cellent chance of winning the crown.

the Trojans taking the lead from the
very beginning. Everything the In
dians tried was wrong in the first
half. Their passing was spotty, their
shooting was off, and their back
board work was bad. Another fac-
tor in the Trojans' 32-13 halftime
advantage was Jack Nichols, who
broke away from Murphy and sank
five quick baskets.
Scoring Ebbs off in Second Half
At the start of the second half
Gene Martin bucketed three straight
baskets to cut the Trojan lead to 13
points where it remained most of
the game. Coach Everett Dean
started substituting very freely with
about five minutes to go, find the
scoring ebbed off decidedly.
Martin was again high man for
Stanford with nine points. Rodman,
Murphy, and O'Brien each had six,
Hood five, George Sloat four, Bill
Christiansen three, and Jack Wood
one. Kloppenburg had 17, Nichols
14, and Webster 9, for the Trojans.
Fiiibcrti Stops Brawl
A near brawl took place in the
second half of the second game,
when Wood got a headlock on Nich
ols during a wild scramble under
the Stanford basket. Nichols came
up ready to swing it out, but his
teammate Ernie Filiberti stepped in
between the two boys.
Kloppenburg's 35 points for the
series placed him back in the scor
ing lead of the conference with 109
points. Nichols' 21 points put him in
second place with 105 points. Andy
Wolfe of California, last week's
leader, did not play a conference
game this week, so still has an ex
cellent chance of winning the crown.
The Trojans of USC moved into first place in the Southern Division ol
the Pacific Coast Conference title race last Friday and Saturday nights,
when they dumped the Stanford Indians twice, 48-36, and 55-41.
The Cardinals looked like a much better team Friday night than they
have at any other time this year. Even with Jim Hill, the squad's top

scorer, out ol unitorm, tne team
looked good. With Gene Martin and
Tom Hood following their shots and
playing an inspirational backboard
game, the Indians got just as many
rebounds as the Trojans.
Murphy Outscorcs Nichols
Tom Murphy, starting at the cen
ter slot for the first time this sea
son, actually outscored the Trojans'
vaunted Jack Nichols in Friday's
game. Murphy dumped in three
whirling pivot shots and two free
shots for eight points while holding
Nichols to a mere one field goal. Bill
O'Brien didn't see any action until
the last part of Saturday's game, but
looked sensational in those five min
utes.
The two Trojan forwards, clever
little Bob Webster, and high scor
ing Bobby Kloppenburg, were just
too good for Stanford to handle Fri
day. Webster scored 21 points, most
of which were swishers from the
side of the keyhole. Kloppenburg
scored most of his 1.8 points on fast
breaks that found him all alone un
der the basket. Tom Rodman, due
to a badly-bandaged knee, found it
hard to keep up with the fast mov
ing Webster.
USC Holds Lead
The Trojans built up an early lead
only to have Tom Rodman sink
three long left-hand shots to cut
the lead to a fairly respectable 26-
17 halftime score. In the second half
USC maintained their lead all the
way. The closest the Indians could
come was at the 12-minute mark,
when they pulled to within eight
points. Martin was high point man
for Stanford with nine points. Rod
man and Murphy had eight, Hood
six, and Christiansen five.
