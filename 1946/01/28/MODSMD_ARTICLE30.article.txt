## Housing Committee 
### 
A REPRINT FOR READING
Reports drifting toward the Daily Shack lately
i?i - i \tc that a number cf Stanford women are
stii! asking "What is Housing Committee, what
ck it do, or how do 1 fit into the Housing Pro
gram?" Accordingly, v/e reprint an editorial
from . Daily issue dated October 2, 1945, in the
ftrv i.l hope thai the uninformed may obtain
ynmr idea cI the purposes and principles under
which the present program is attempting opera
tion.
"Housing Committee, now a sub-committee of
Women's Conference, was created last winter
quarter to work with the Administration in find
ing a solution to a difficult campus problem
converting former sororiiy houses to University
lesic' nces. The committee members were cho
:xn with particular care to be representative and
fair and their meetings quickly bcame a focal
point of campus interest. Several radically dif
ferent plans for maintaining group congeniality
Without resorting to the rushing system were
proposed; opinions were aired, suggestions were
mado, and step by step a plan evolved, a plan
base i Oil the fundamental contention that among
Stanford women "there need be no greater cri
teria for selection of one's fellow residents than
their willingness to assume the responsibilities
of making the living unit function."
The main points embodied in the final plan
W' ! >ijh was approved by the Eoard of Trustees
include:
1. Agreement to have the same lot system of
room choosing for all women's residences.
2. Consideration of casas in Lagunita as small,
separate units.
Maintenance of the co-operative living sys
tem in former sorority houses and independ
ence of house policy.
4. Recommendation that the University work
toward putting kitchens and co-operative living
systems into email Union units as soon as prac
tical and possible, if it is desired by women in
the unit's.
5. Recommendation that house bills be uni
f< nin all women's residences.
i. Establishment of an all-campus social pro
cji iin to acquaint freshman women with types of
li/iiig units and their members, and recommen
dation that an educational program be set up
outlining the duties, functions, advantages and
di:-.'idvantages in all types of living groups.
1 1 cognizing that there would be a need for
lu jlied women s action in the co-ordination of
social policy, and exchange of ideas among
various living groups, the first Housing Commit
/Cfcommended that a permanent committee
be set up. That committee is now . . . coping
w;!h present-day problems in women's housing.
Its discussions will be reported in full. Again
tb.s quarter the committee needs the interest
and co-operation of all Stanford women to carry
Ihrough its objectives: . . the facilities of con
geniality within a residence so that each woman
niay i eel herself part of a friendly group .. . the
formulation of a new social policy which will
both unite all women's living groups and pro
vide a happy way of living for each Stanford
woman . .
''hat tells the background and basic fea

tures of the accepied housing plan. Its present
operation and applications will be discussed in
future editorials.
