ORGANIZATION IN PROGRESS
To the Editor:
We're sick of being blamed for lack of spirit.
In regards to the rooters at basketball games,
we would like to make a bitter complaint.
We've got the yell leaders, we've got the
"band," we've got the spirit, but we DO NOT
have the organization.
We suggest:
1. A roped-off section for Stanford rooters
only.
2. Students in the section required to carry
out red and white theme in dress.
3. A section divided for boys and girls to
insure more enthusiasm. (There will be less
distraction for all concerned.)
4. Band be in a central location, preferably
in the south center with rooters on either side.
5. The band play the songs at least a key (or
two or three) lower.

(Editorial Note: Rally Com, in a letter in last
Wednesday's Daily, explained that organization
of a special rooting section at basketball games
was not permitted by the Board of Athletic Con
trol because it felt that those matters could best
be handled by student police. Since that time,
but too late for last weekend's games, the com
mittee has obtained permission from the B.A.C.
to organize a student section and plans will be
made for the next home basketball games.)
