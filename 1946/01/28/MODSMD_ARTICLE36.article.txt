"Alchemy as a Way of Salvation,"
the latest book of Frederic Spiegel
berg, instructor in humanities, is an
attempt to place the much scorned
and ridiculed science of alchemy on
a scholarly basis.
"Dr. C. G. Jung, who has written
several books on the subject, and
with whom I was c|°' n § psychologi
cal research in Switzerland from
1932 to 1936, provided the inspira
tion for the book," said Dr. Spiegel
berg. "I then did a lot of research
among rare alchemical manuscripts
in famous European libraries before
coming to this country in 1937."
Misconception
Modern day science ridicules al
chemy, while really it is a philoso
phy, Dr. Spiegelberg continued.
There is a common misconception
that medieval alchemists were in
terested only in turning baser met
als into gold. Such men were pseu
do-alchemists, or "cauldron-cboks."
"Real alchemists would have been
greatly disappointed if they had
produced gold." stated the author.
"Medieval philosophers, such as
these men were, thought not only
with their minds but with their
hands.
Strange Brews
"They mixed strange metallic

brews in their laboratories, and in
these boilings and explosions they
saw spiritual revelations."
Dr. Spiegelberg said that alchemy
could be called a Western Yoga be
cause it developed as an attempt to
master at once the material and the
spiritual side of earthly existence;
it was philosophizing with the hand.
Mysification
"The alchemists' mysterious lan
| guage and symbols were developed
partly to mystify the layman and to
! protect the practice from criticism,"
| continued the author.
"I believe alchemy is important as
S a philosophy along the psychologi
! cal lines, because through under
j standing it one can learn much of
! the spirit of the times. They were
spiritual metaphysicians," he con
cluded.
Dr. Spiegelberg is the author of
! numerous books on Oriental phi
' losophy. He is also the co-editor of
j "The Bible of the World," familiar
j lo many students.
