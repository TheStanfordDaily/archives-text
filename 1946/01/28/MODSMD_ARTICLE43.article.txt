# ON THE DISCS
## 
### LARRY FRANKLEY GEORGE ECKSTEIN 
Phil's Feeble Four
Since their departure from Victor,
the Phil Moore Four has signed a
long-term contract with Musicraft.
Recording Company. Their first disc
on this label is quite disappointing.
The songs cut were "Symphony,"
the most overdone composition of
the day, and George Gershwin's
'Porgy, I Loves You"; and if we
are not mistaken, feature different
personnels on each side; that is, un
j less the Phil Moore Four is now the
Phil Moorp Five!
Billy Daniels is the vocalist (we
use the word loosely) on (he first
side, and we're quite positive that
he either had a bad cold or is to
tally tone-deaf. There is some
muted trumpet and Moore plays
: some of his nice locked - hands
! style piano.
The reverse is all Phil Moore and
j his Steinway, his 88, or more com
monly, his piano. Through the first
few choruses of the number, the ef
fect is very nice, but then it begins
to drag. There is not enough wax
allotted to the guitarist who is prob
ably Remo Palmieri, Esquire Silver
Award winner, and Moore's piano
j stylings certainly rub the wrong
J way toward the end of the disc.
Woody-Wayne Wonderful
Woody Herman's newest record
j on Columbia label is now available.
It differs from his recent discs in
that neither side is one of those fan
! tastic originals for which the band
j is famous. The tunes are well han
dled by the Herman herd, and are
| both taken at a relaxed tempo that
j will provide good dancing music as
! well as enjoyable listening.
The first side, the ever-popular
| "I've Got the World on a String,"
features the old Woodchopper on
the vocal and the bass of Chubby
! Jackson. The side also shows
Flip Phillips' wonderful tenor to
good advantage, and is a good
demonstration of his phrasing on
ballads in contrast to his solos on
such discs as "Apple Honey,"
"Northwest Passage," and "Your
Father's Moustache." Down to
the last novel brass figure, which
if you don't listen closely you will
miss, the side is right up on the
ladder of the Herman discogra
phy.
Flipping the disc, we found an
other Frances Wayne vocal—hold us
| back, mother. This time, the thrush
j does one of the more popular tunes
'of the day, "Love Me." As usual,
j her phrasing is impeccable and the
I effect that this platter would have at
a dimly lit fireside would be nothing
short of sensational.
! Backed by soloists, Bill Harris and
I once again Flip Phillips, the side is
j a good backing for the Woody vocal.
| Our only desire is that Miss Wayne
(now Mrs. Neal Hefti) would record
| more of the standards that she does
; so beautifully over the Herman air
( show on Friday evenings. Another
| redeeming quality about the record
jis the surface —it is perfect!
i We've Heard That Song Before
j Erskine Hawkins' latest record.
| flying the Victor banner, is one
! comprised of two strangely famil
iar tunes, 'Good Dip" and "Let's
Have Fun Tonight." Without
listening two closely, one can de
tect in the riff strains of "Good
Dip" the melody of the Duke El
lington tune, "Everything But"
You." Although Erskine (we call
him Erskine; he calls himself the
"Twentieth-Century Gabriel") is
i not quite a "Gabriel," he never
theless has a fine solid band that
has possibilities of really being
top-flight.
Upon turning the record over, we
i find "Let's Have Fun Tonight," a
! number that is very reminiscent of
! "Pistol Pack in' Mater." (This is
, Stanford, son.) The vocal is handled
I by Ace Harris and members of the
| band, and the side is quite listen-
I able. Hawkins is one of the few

Victor artists that are getting fair
treatment from that company, al
though one bad aspect of the band
is the absence of any outstanding
oioists.
More Monroe Moaning
Oh g?e! Oh gosh! Oh golly! He's
released another one! Yes, Vaughn
Monroe's latest disc, "You May
Not Love Me" and "Just My Luck,"
is now in the local record stores, and
pardon us while we throw up. Fea
turing Monroe and the Norton Sis
ters on both sides, 111" vocals are
taken care of—for good. Monroe
must have an "in" with the worst
publishing house in the United
States as he consistently records
very poor tunes, but we t'«el that
Monroe, the poor man's Ezio Pinza,
is out of place singing with a dance
band, and therefore the music does
not make too much difference.
With the opera-type voice that
Monroe possesses, it seems that he
would he more at home on the
Metropolitan stage than at the
Palladium bandstand. The band
itself is not bad. It is not good,
but there are worse. The en
semble work is very clear-cut and
superior to most bands of this
type, and it seems a shame that
this group should be burdened
on each and every side with
Vaughn's laynx.

Phil's Feeble Four
Since their departure from Victor,
the Phil Moore Four has signed a
long-term contract with Musicraft.
Recording Company. Their first disc
on this label is quite disappointing.
The songs cut were "Symphony,"
the most overdone composition of
the day, and George Gershwin's
'Porgy, I Loves You"; and if we
are not mistaken, feature different
personnels on each side; that is, un
j less the Phil Moore Four is now the
Phil Moorp Five!
Billy Daniels is the vocalist (we
use the word loosely) on (he first
side, and we're quite positive that
he either had a bad cold or is to
tally tone-deaf. There is some
muted trumpet and Moore plays
: some of his nice locked - hands
! style piano.
The reverse is all Phil Moore and
j his Steinway, his 88, or more com
monly, his piano. Through the first
few choruses of the number, the ef
fect is very nice, but then it begins
to drag. There is not enough wax
allotted to the guitarist who is prob
ably Remo Palmieri, Esquire Silver
Award winner, and Moore's piano
j stylings certainly rub the wrong
J way toward the end of the disc.
Woody-Wayne Wonderful
Woody Herman's newest record
j on Columbia label is now available.
It differs from his recent discs in
that neither side is one of those fan
! tastic originals for which the band
j is famous. The tunes are well han
dled by the Herman herd, and are
| both taken at a relaxed tempo that
j will provide good dancing music as
! well as enjoyable listening.
The first side, the ever-popular
| "I've Got the World on a String,"
features the old Woodchopper on
the vocal and the bass of Chubby
! Jackson. The side also shows
Flip Phillips' wonderful tenor to
good advantage, and is a good
demonstration of his phrasing on
ballads in contrast to his solos on
such discs as "Apple Honey,"
"Northwest Passage," and "Your
Father's Moustache." Down to
the last novel brass figure, which
if you don't listen closely you will
miss, the side is right up on the
ladder of the Herman discogra
phy.
Flipping the disc, we found an
other Frances Wayne vocal—hold us
| back, mother. This time, the thrush
j does one of the more popular tunes
'of the day, "Love Me." As usual,
j her phrasing is impeccable and the
I effect that this platter would have at
a dimly lit fireside would be nothing
short of sensational.
! Backed by soloists, Bill Harris and
I once again Flip Phillips, the side is
j a good backing for the Woody vocal.
| Our only desire is that Miss Wayne
(now Mrs. Neal Hefti) would record
| more of the standards that she does
; so beautifully over the Herman air
( show on Friday evenings. Another
| redeeming quality about the record
jis the surface —it is perfect!
i We've Heard That Song Before
j Erskine Hawkins' latest record.
| flying the Victor banner, is one
! comprised of two strangely famil
iar tunes, 'Good Dip" and "Let's
Have Fun Tonight." Without
listening two closely, one can de
tect in the riff strains of "Good
Dip" the melody of the Duke El
lington tune, "Everything But"
You." Although Erskine (we call
him Erskine; he calls himself the
"Twentieth-Century Gabriel") is
i not quite a "Gabriel," he never
theless has a fine solid band that
has possibilities of really being
top-flight.
Upon turning the record over, we
i find "Let's Have Fun Tonight," a
! number that is very reminiscent of
! "Pistol Pack in' Mater." (This is
, Stanford, son.) The vocal is handled
I by Ace Harris and members of the
| band, and the side is quite listen-
I able. Hawkins is one of the few

Victor artists that are getting fair
treatment from that company, al
though one bad aspect of the band
is the absence of any outstanding
oioists.
More Monroe Moaning
Oh g?e! Oh gosh! Oh golly! He's
released another one! Yes, Vaughn
Monroe's latest disc, "You May
Not Love Me" and "Just My Luck,"
is now in the local record stores, and
pardon us while we throw up. Fea
turing Monroe and the Norton Sis
ters on both sides, 111" vocals are
taken care of—for good. Monroe
must have an "in" with the worst
publishing house in the United
States as he consistently records
very poor tunes, but we t'«el that
Monroe, the poor man's Ezio Pinza,
is out of place singing with a dance
band, and therefore the music does
not make too much difference.
With the opera-type voice that
Monroe possesses, it seems that he
would he more at home on the
Metropolitan stage than at the
Palladium bandstand. The band
itself is not bad. It is not good,
but there are worse. The en
semble work is very clear-cut and
superior to most bands of this
type, and it seems a shame that
this group should be burdened

Vaughn's laynx.
Phil's Feeble Four
Since their departure from Victor,
the Phil Moore Four has signed a
long-term contract with Musicraft.
Recording Company. Their first disc
on this label is quite disappointing.
The songs cut were "Symphony,"
the most overdone composition of
the day, and George Gershwin's
'Porgy, I Loves You"; and if we
are not mistaken, feature different
personnels on each side; that is, un
j less the Phil Moore Four is now the
Phil Moorp Five!
Billy Daniels is the vocalist (we
use the word loosely) on (he first
side, and we're quite positive that
he either had a bad cold or is to
tally tone-deaf. There is some
muted trumpet and Moore plays
: some of his nice locked - hands
! style piano.
The reverse is all Phil Moore and
j his Steinway, his 88, or more com
monly, his piano. Through the first
few choruses of the number, the ef
fect is very nice, but then it begins
to drag. There is not enough wax
allotted to the guitarist who is prob
ably Remo Palmieri, Esquire Silver
Award winner, and Moore's piano
j stylings certainly rub the wrong
J way toward the end of the disc.
Woody-Wayne Wonderful
Woody Herman's newest record
j on Columbia label is now available.
It differs from his recent discs in
that neither side is one of those fan
! tastic originals for which the band
j is famous. The tunes are well han
dled by the Herman herd, and are
| both taken at a relaxed tempo that
j will provide good dancing music as
! well as enjoyable listening.
The first side, the ever-popular
| "I've Got the World on a String,"
features the old Woodchopper on
the vocal and the bass of Chubby
! Jackson. The side also shows
Flip Phillips' wonderful tenor to
good advantage, and is a good
demonstration of his phrasing on
ballads in contrast to his solos on
such discs as "Apple Honey,"
"Northwest Passage," and "Your
Father's Moustache." Down to
the last novel brass figure, which
if you don't listen closely you will
miss, the side is right up on the
ladder of the Herman discogra
phy.
Flipping the disc, we found an
other Frances Wayne vocal—hold us
| back, mother. This time, the thrush
j does one of the more popular tunes
'of the day, "Love Me." As usual,
j her phrasing is impeccable and the
I effect that this platter would have at
a dimly lit fireside would be nothing
short of sensational.
! Backed by soloists, Bill Harris and
I once again Flip Phillips, the side is
j a good backing for the Woody vocal.
| Our only desire is that Miss Wayne
(now Mrs. Neal Hefti) would record
| more of the standards that she does
; so beautifully over the Herman air
( show on Friday evenings. Another
| redeeming quality about the record
jis the surface —it is perfect!
i We've Heard That Song Before
j Erskine Hawkins' latest record.
| flying the Victor banner, is one
! comprised of two strangely famil
iar tunes, 'Good Dip" and "Let's
Have Fun Tonight." Without
listening two closely, one can de
tect in the riff strains of "Good
Dip" the melody of the Duke El
lington tune, "Everything But"
You." Although Erskine (we call
him Erskine; he calls himself the
"Twentieth-Century Gabriel") is
i not quite a "Gabriel," he never
theless has a fine solid band that
has possibilities of really being
top-flight.
Upon turning the record over, we
i find "Let's Have Fun Tonight," a
! number that is very reminiscent of
! "Pistol Pack in' Mater." (This is
, Stanford, son.) The vocal is handled
I by Ace Harris and members of the
| band, and the side is quite listen-
I able. Hawkins is one of the few

Victor artists that are getting fair
treatment from that company, al
though one bad aspect of the band
is the absence of any outstanding
oioists.
More Monroe Moaning
Oh g?e! Oh gosh! Oh golly! He's
released another one! Yes, Vaughn
Monroe's latest disc, "You May
Not Love Me" and "Just My Luck,"
is now in the local record stores, and
pardon us while we throw up. Fea
turing Monroe and the Norton Sis
ters on both sides, 111" vocals are
taken care of—for good. Monroe
must have an "in" with the worst
publishing house in the United
States as he consistently records
very poor tunes, but we t'«el that
Monroe, the poor man's Ezio Pinza,
is out of place singing with a dance
band, and therefore the music does
not make too much difference.
With the opera-type voice that
Monroe possesses, it seems that he
would he more at home on the
Metropolitan stage than at the
Palladium bandstand. The band
itself is not bad. It is not good,
but there are worse. The en
semble work is very clear-cut and
superior to most bands of this
type, and it seems a shame that
this group should be burdened
on each and every side with
Vaughn's laynx.
