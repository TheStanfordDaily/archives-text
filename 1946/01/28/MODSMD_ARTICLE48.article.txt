# NO MORE CARS FOR MELTON

BOSTON, Jan. 27 (UP).-Singer
James Melton has been awarded the
annual prize of the Veteran Motor
Car Club of America—a 1907 model
Reo —but he isn't happy about it.
Collector Melton said he already
has 95 ancient automobiles on his
Westport, Conn., farm, and his wife
has positively forbidden him to
bring home any more.
