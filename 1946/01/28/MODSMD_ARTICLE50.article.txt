Weekend wonderings. How the Stanford hoopsters can fluctuate so
much in their showing during an evening. Saturday night during the
first half, the Trojans went on a "bucket-plunking" campaign, and hit
the basket from all coiners of the floor. Stanford, on the other har.d, was
unable to find the basket. At various times, the Farm five tried to break
up the game with longshots, but the ball failed to sink through to run up
ihe Stanford Score-ledger.
Mid-game feeling through the Pavilion was depressing, to put it
mildly. People who so much as said boo, were heard on the other side
of the basketball saucer. Some disgusted v/ag was wondering if USC
could run the score up to 75 points. Then another cynic in the press coop
recited the score of the Montana-Ganzaga game, 103-34, with a curl
innuendo.
Second Half Surprise
When the Farm cagers trotted out for the second half, everybody
braced themselves for the expected drubbing. But what happens, Charlie?
Stanford springs back like a rejuvenated outfit that had just been in
jected with a shot of Vitamin B complex.
Fighting like mad tigers, the locals were able to actually outplay the
visiting boys from Trojan land. The lackadaisical appearance of Sam
Barry, USC coach, turned to that of seriousness, probably wondering if
his team could outlast the Stanford storm. Sadly enough, they did.
Friday night's edition of conference play, to turn back the page, was
a case of Stanford just being a little behind their opponents at all times.
Whenever the Farmsters located the basket for points. Webster or Klop
penburg would come back and raise the Trojan ante.
lii'l Turns Civilian
Today Jim Hill, currently on the basketball sidelines, doffs his Navy
togs for jeans and saddle shoes. He is being discharged from Camp Shoe
maker 011 points, but plans to return immediately to his classes on the
Cardinal campus. Medicos have said that he probably will be in playing
shape for this weekend's non-conference games against the College of
Pacific on Friday night, and the University of San Francisco on Saturday
night. . . . KO Justice is coming along fine at Santa Anita. S ois Bushel
