# J.V. Cagers Take Double Win from Dibble, Marin
## 
### 
Forrest "Fordy" Anderson is
j happy today. His junior varsity
! basketball team won two games in
j one week-end, something unusual
I for a Stanford athletic squad these
days.
The junior cagers squeezed by
Dibble Hospital on Friday and in
creased their momentum to win eas
ily over Marin Junior College the
next evening. The scores were 35
to 34 and 49 to 29.
Trio Leads Juniors
The three sparkplugs of the team
I were John Muir, who totaled 24
| points for the two evenings, Brew
i stcr Arms, and Bob Hagopian. All
three were high scorers, but in ad
dition played outstanding defensive
■james.
Dibble fielded an almost entirely
| different team than the one which
bowed to the Farm J.V. team ear
lier in the season. The aggressive,
hard-fighting outfit quickly took
the lead and at half time was lead
! ing 21 to 13.
But Muir put Stanford on the
road back by sinking three field
goals in a row. Then Hagopian got
I hot, scoring nine points in the sec
j ond half. His last field goal came in
l the last moments and provided the
1 winning margins.
Cards Slow Starting
It took the Cardinal team a whole
half to get warmed up, but once it
did, it was obviously the superior
team. Making sure that his charges
would not be so icy for the first
twenty minutes of the Marin game,
mentor Anderson had the team
warming up much earlier on Sat
urday night. And this change paid
dividends.
With Muir sinking almost every

112 shot he took, the locals catapulted
to a 16-point half-time lead and
i went on to win easily. After putting
up a fight for a while, Marin's de
fense fell apart and Stanford's cag
| ers met little competition. Arms
| with 12 followed Muir who made 16
j points in the scoring department.
Muir on Way Up
Muir has shown definite varsity
potentiality in his last few games,
| dropping a high percentage of his
shots and handling himself capably
! it all limes.
Another junior varsity man who
j may have attracted Coach Everett
Dean's attention is center Ed Culin
who has been consistently getting a
; high share of the rebounds. Other
j members of the undermanned squad
! are David Toney. Ross Hughes, Fred
Loomis, and Del Torkleson.—Marin
