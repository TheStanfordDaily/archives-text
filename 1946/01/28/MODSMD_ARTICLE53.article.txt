### KEN ROTENBERG 
Have you noticed the strange reactions of a few of your classmates
upon hearing the bell signaling the end of a class period? If so, be as
sured that the condition is nothing to worry about. These characters who
tuck their chins behind a protecting shoulder and make for the door in
a bobbing and weaving crouch occasionally side-stepping or circling to
the right, are nearly as normal as *

I you and I.
Explanation
J The explanation lies in the fact !
| that they are boxing team aspirants, j
| and haven't as yet shaken off the j
j effects of a stiff left hook absorbed
i in a sparring session the day before. '
. These fellows spend their spare time !
| every afternoon from 4 o'clock on in j
i the gym furiously tossing leather at I
1 each other.
j We investigated these activities
I yesterday and are pleased to report
| (hat this form of mayhem is regard
! cd as peachy fun by a goodly per
| centage of both lower and upper di
j vision Stanford males. The whole |
thing as a matter of fact is quite a j
worthy undertaking, since the boys j
are instructing themselves in the j
art/science of right-crossing and j
uppercutting with the idea in mind
of carrying the colors of the Farm
to further glory.
Bend and Blacken
These knights of the squared cir- !
cle intend to bend the noses and j
blacken the eyes of chin-tucking j
bobbers and weavers of rival cam- |
puses. The fact that most of them ;
! lack experience in the ring does not j
in the least dampen their ardour. j
This is the most idealistic form of
school patriotism known to this
writer.
The team as a whole lacks repre
sentation in the lightweight division,
and is not particularly star-studded j
in any of the other divisions. But !
the coach didn't seem a bit worried !
when he reported that his athletes i
were going to begin active competi
tion next month. And if he isn't per
turbed why should you or I work
ourselves up about it. In all likeli
hood the coach and team know what
they Ye doing.
Statements
We asked some of the fighters
themselves to make a few statements
relevant to the trials, tribulations, j
I and hopes of the team as a whole, j
, They answered in great length and j
| were probably very informative and !
interesting. I say were probably in
formative and interesting because I
don't really know. You see they all i
kept their protective mouthpiece in
their mouth throughout our chat. I
couldn't understand a word of what i
was being said.
Coach Vic Lindscog made several ;
attempts to aid me grasping the sig
j nificant facts pertinent to the one
two set. He was thwarted in these
efforts several times when one of
his student's head was separated by
a "bolo blow" from his shoulders and
rolled over to a neutral corner. Af
ter this incident he preferred to re
main on duty as the third man in
(he ring and forget his public rela
tions responsibility.
I think you wiil agree that what
[ information I have gleaned was ob
tained under severe handicaps.
