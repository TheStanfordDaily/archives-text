## 
### (By United Press 
The Washington Huskies retained
! their Northern Division lead in the
Pacific Coast Basketball Conference
today despite the loss of an over
time game to Oregon, and South
ern California continued in top
place in the Southern Division after
handing Stanford another defeat.
In another conference game last
night the Idaho Vandals came from
behind to triumph 43-38 over Ore
gon State College and hold third
spot in the Northern Division.
The University of California loafed
to an easy 56-42 victory over the
University of Santa Clara in a non
â–  conference game at Berkeley.
Idaho trailed through most of the
first half of its game with Oregon
State, due largely to a 13-point
scoring streak by Red Roncha of
Oregon. With six minutes of the
second half gone, the Vandals tied
the score and, after the lead see
sawed between the two teams seven
times, tallied the winning score with
two and a half minutes to go.
