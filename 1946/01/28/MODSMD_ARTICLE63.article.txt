# Four Broadway Shows Offered to Theatre Fans
## 
### 
San Francisco's habitually slow
drama season has taken a new lease
on life this month with four New
York productions scheduled for the
Geary Street theaters.
San Francisco's hill-climbing pop
ulation, used to catching only an oc
casional glimpse of good theater,
will have four excellent produc
tions from which to choose.
"Dear Ruth" Was Big Ilit
The first sign that San Francisco
was to be the headquarters of road
show companies this spring was
when "Dear Ruth," a swell little
comedy by Noi'man Krasna, packed
them in for an extended run early
in December at the Curran.
Then, revitalized by the news that
San Francisco was to be the recipi
ent of some of the better Theater
Guild productions, plans went ahead
for San Francisco's best theater sea
son in many years.
"Harvey" Now Running
Running currently are "Harvey"
with Joe E. Brown and Philip Bar
ry's "Foolish Notion" with Tallullah
Bankhead.
Stepping into the shoes of Frank
Fay, the star of Broadway's "Har
vey," was no easy task for Joe E.

Brown but his restrained perform
ance of Elmer Dowd, the alcoholic
who runs around with a six-foot
rabbit, is admirable.
Barry's I'lay Weak
Miss Bankhead deserves a better
play than the little comedy Philip
Barry has cooked up for her in
"Foolish Notion." Miss Bankhead is
very good and in many ways makes
up for the faulty lines and plot.
Opening next month is the long
awaited "Oklahoma." Probably the
most - heralded production of this
decade, the Bodgers and Hammer
stein adaptation of "Green Grow the
Lilacs" should disappoint nobody.
Revolutionary in staging and use of
the ballet among other things, ''Ok
lahoma" has been breaking box of
fice records in New York for three
years. The St. James Theater, home
of "Oklahoma," has reported that
the S.R.O. sign still hangs on the
door nightly.
Bergner Is Outstanding
Opening next month also is Eliza
beth Bergner in "The Two Mrs.
Carrolls." Miss Bergner turns in
one of the most polished perform
ances of her brilliant career as the
second Mrs. Carroll. The plot has
obvious weaknesses which few ac
tresses would have been able to
cope with, but Miss Bergner ex
hibits perfect stage technique and
the plot's weaknesses are hidden
beneath her splendid performance.
Victor Jory, who co-starred with
Miss Bergner in the New York pro
duction, is out of the San Francisco
past. His absence will be sorely felt.

tions from which to choose.
"Dear Ruth" Was Big Ilit
The first sign that San Francisco
was to be the headquarters of road
show companies this spring was
when "Dear Ruth," a swell little
comedy by Noi'man Krasna, packed
them in for an extended run early
in December at the Curran.
Then, revitalized by the news that
San Francisco was to be the recipi
ent of some of the better Theater
Guild productions, plans went ahead
for San Francisco's best theater sea
son in many years.
"Harvey" Now Running
Running currently are "Harvey"
with Joe E. Brown and Philip Bar
ry's "Foolish Notion" with Tallullah
Bankhead.
Stepping into the shoes of Frank
Fay, the star of Broadway's "Har
vey," was no easy task for Joe E.

Brown but his restrained perform
ance of Elmer Dowd, the alcoholic
who runs around with a six-foot
rabbit, is admirable.
Barry's I'lay Weak
Miss Bankhead deserves a better
play than the little comedy Philip
Barry has cooked up for her in
"Foolish Notion." Miss Bankhead is
very good and in many ways makes
up for the faulty lines and plot.
Opening next month is the long
awaited "Oklahoma." Probably the
most - heralded production of this
decade, the Bodgers and Hammer
stein adaptation of "Green Grow the
Lilacs" should disappoint nobody.
Revolutionary in staging and use of
the ballet among other things, ''Ok
lahoma" has been breaking box of
fice records in New York for three
years. The St. James Theater, home
of "Oklahoma," has reported that
the S.R.O. sign still hangs on the
door nightly.
Bergner Is Outstanding
Opening next month also is Eliza
beth Bergner in "The Two Mrs.
Carrolls." Miss Bergner turns in
one of the most polished perform
ances of her brilliant career as the
second Mrs. Carroll. The plot has
obvious weaknesses which few ac
tresses would have been able to
cope with, but Miss Bergner ex
hibits perfect stage technique and
the plot's weaknesses are hidden
beneath her splendid performance.
Victor Jory, who co-starred with
Miss Bergner in the New York pro
duction, is out of the San Francisco
past. His absence will be sorely felt.

San Francisco's habitually slow
drama season has taken a new lease
on life this month with four New
York productions scheduled for the
Geary Street theaters.
San Francisco's hill-climbing pop
ulation, used to catching only an oc
casional glimpse of good theater,
will have four excellent produc
tions from which to choose.
