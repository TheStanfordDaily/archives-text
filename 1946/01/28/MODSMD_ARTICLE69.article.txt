# Greene Outlines Aims Of Liberal Education
## 
### ROD BROWNING 
Dr. Theodore M. Greene, visit
ing professor of Humanities, be
lieves that modern education is
leaving out a vital part of edu
cationâ€”the liberal arts. Accord
ing to Dr. Greene liberal educa
tion involves both breadth and
depth, and includes such subjects
as literature, the social sciences,
art, history, and philosophy. An
educated person, besides knowing
something of these subjects, must
also know a great deal about one
particular subject. In this way he
is able to get a broader outlook
on the framework of modern so
ciety.
According to Dr. Greene, an edu
cated person must fulfill the follow
ing requisites. An educated person
must first of all be able to speak,
read and write his own language ef
fectively, and have at least a read
ing knowledge of a foreign lan
guage, in which he has become ac
quainted with the literature of that
country. Students of today, Dr.
Greene thinks, are not able to use

their own language as effectively as
did the students of the past.
Logic and History Are Important
An educated person must also be
able to think clearly, logically and
accurately. Courses in mathematics,
the exact sciences, and philosophy
are of help to the student to a
greater or lesser degree. "An edu
cated person should also know mod
ern America in the context of west
ern civilization, which includes our
long religious, political and cultural
traditions," according to Dr. Greene.
This will give him the ability to see
our culture in a historical perspec
tive.
An educated person ought to
know about the physical world and
about himself as a part of that
world. The present day political and
economic factors and the democratic
system are also of primary impor
tance. He should know about the
various countries of the world, and
aboijt America's place in the pres
ent as well as in the future, and
about what we have to give up in

order to live at peace with the fami
ly of nations.
Great Minds of the fast
The student should come in con
tact with the great minds of the
past, and it is the job of the faculty
to introduce the Student to these
men. Dr. Greene save a list for ex
ample of famous men which an edu
cated person should recognize at
once, such as: Homer, Sophocles,
Plato, the Bible, Descartes, Aris
totle, St. Augustine, Thomas Aqui
nas, Michelangelo, Pascal, Cezanne,
Newton, Darwin, Jefferson, Shake
speare, Millon, Beethoven, Mozart,
Gibbon, and Adam Smith. By study
ing the works of these men the stu
dent will be seeing man at his best.
And last of all an educated person
is one who knows how to be intel
ligent about controversial subjects,
because the great human issues,
such as religion and society, are aH
controversial.
Value of Education
Dr. Greene said that to test the
educational value of a college he
would ask, "how many students who
are leaving the college have learned
how to read with comprehension, to
think clearly, to vole with intelli
gence and a keen concern for so
ciety, to enjoy beauty in its various
forms, and to pray intelligently?"
"In other words," said Dr. Greene,
"the job of liberal education is to
make the people more intelligent,
but as yet we haven't done a very
good job of it."
