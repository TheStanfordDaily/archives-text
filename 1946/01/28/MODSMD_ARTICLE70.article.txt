# Trips to Moon In 50 Years?
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 27 (UP).â€”
Passengers in rocket ships should
be able to whizz to the moon in 90-
hour trips within 50 years, W. E.
Osborne, radar and television ex
pert and former Australian army
major, predicted today.
Spatial Filling Stations
Refueling stations hung in space
also should permit sight-seers to
go to Mars but a round trip to that
planet would take about two and a
half years. So much time would be
wasted to permit the earth to come
around into the same spot before
the travelers could return from
Mars.
Osborne is here doing secret re
search for the American govern
ment. His predictions about visit
ing other planets were made after
the U.S. Army announced that it
contacted the moon by radar.
Tourist Trips in 50 Years
With new improved fuels, scien
tists will be hitting the moon with
pilotless rockets in less than ten
years, Osborne believes. In less than
50 years, space ships should be car
rying passengers to the moon, he
added.
Such ships will need space re
fueling stations as any rocket uses
most most of its fuel getting away
from the atmosphere and gravita
tional pull, Osborne explained.
Theory Complete
"The theory of these refueling
stations already is complete, and it
isn't as difficult as it sounds," he
said. "They would be taken through
the atmosphere by rocket propulsion
and set in the same orbit as the
earth. They would turn with the
earth, and if they were 22,500 miles
high, they would stay stationary in
relation to the earth."
A space ship, for instance, headed
for Mars, could go through the at
mosphere, refuel at the station, go
on to Mars, slow down and stop,
come back, refuel again and return
to earth.
