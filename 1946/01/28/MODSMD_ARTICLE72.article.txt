# Steel, GM Strikes to Continue; Packinghouse Workers Return
## Ford Settlement May End Strikes 
### 
PITTSBURGH, Jan. 27 (UP).—
The week-old steel strike was still
deadlocked tonight, hut labor
sources believed that the indus
try's case against an 18' cents
an hour increase definitely has
been weakened by the signing of
wage agreements with Ford and
Chrysler.
Ford signed with the CIO United
Auto Workers for 18 cents, Chrysler
for 18 1 2 cents. The steel strike was
called for an 18V2-cent increase.
Favorable
It was believed that the settle
ments were a "favorable" sign in
the steel wage case. One labor
source said, "I have no question but
that the Ford and Chrysler settle
ment will influence the minds of
some steel people."
However, steel industry spokes
men were silent on the swift week
end developments in the auto in
dustry—one of the largest consum
ers of the strike-blockaded steel
products.
Beginning
The great strike began a week ago
tonight after Benjamin F. Fairless,
president of U.S. Steel Corp., re
jected President Truman's wage in
crease formula of 18' _■ cents an hour.
He offered 15 cents. Some 750,000
steel and aluminum workers walked
out in 1,200 companies in 30 states.
But a labor source indicated that
some of the large independent pro
dusers of steel, who are believed to
have played a powerful part in the
rejection of Mr. Truman's wage pro
posal, may remain adamant.
It seemed likely that the govern
ment would now await further de
velopments before going ahead with
indicated seizure plans.
