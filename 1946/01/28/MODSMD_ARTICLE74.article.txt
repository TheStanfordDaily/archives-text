### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 27 (UP).
| —Machinists of AFL Lodge 68 today
| rejected a San Francisco employers'
proposal for a wage boost of 18 per
cent and will continue the strike
which began Oct. 29 and shut down
approximately 200 shipyards and
machine shops idling an estimated
50.000 worers in the Bay Area.
Five thousand members of the lo
cal lodge, which struck in concert
with CIO Local 1304 in Oakland,
attended the mass-meeting in the
Coliseum Bowl this morning and
heard the majority of speakers ad
vocate continuation of the walk-out.
Speakers strongly criticized the
| employers' proposal that a no-strike
| clause be included in the new con-

tract. The proposal was made by
two separate employer groups—the
California Metal Trades Council and
the San Francisco Employers' Coun
cil.
