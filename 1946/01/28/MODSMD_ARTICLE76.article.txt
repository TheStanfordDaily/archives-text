# Reuther Demands GM Compensation
## 
### 
DETROIT, Jan. 27 (UP).â€”CIO
United Auto Workers tonight de
manded a higher wage scale from
General Motors Corporation than
those granted by Ford and Chrysler
to "compensate" 175,000 GM work
ers for losses incurred during their
68-day walkout.
Walter P. Reuther, UAW vice
president in charge of the General
Motors division, claimed that that
the 18 cents an hour pay hike won
from Ford and the 18K cents grant
ed by Chrysler yesterday resulted
from"the determined stand of Gen
eral Motors strikers."
The pay raises affected about 100,-
000 Ford production workers and
some 66.000 Chrysler production,
salaried, office, plant protection and
engineering employees, with the to
tal raises for 1946 estimated at $64,-
000,000.
Reuther made the claim in a press
statement tonight on the eve of a
National Labor Relations Board
hearing on the union's charges of
unfair labor practices against Gen
eral Motors, including refusal to
discuss "ability to pay" the UAVV's
wage demands.
