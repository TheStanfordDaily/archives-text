Promotions Slowed

the staff.

quarters, night editors and editorial
board members receiving two votes,
all others receiving one. Outgoing
editor Helen Dietz has four votes.

the keys to the Shack to her suc
cessor, managing editor Skidmore
will transfer the symbol of her au
thority, a theoretical "big black
whip," to the person appointed in
her stead.
