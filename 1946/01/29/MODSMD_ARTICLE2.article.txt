# Play Builds Wardrobe
## 
### 
The Stanford Players' production
of "The Taming of the Shrew" is an
opportunity for the Wardrobe divi
sion of the Speech and Drama de
partment to acquire a long desired,
extensive Elizabethan wardrobe, ac
cording to Mrs. Muriel Lievsay, cos
tume director.
Because of the intention of mak
ing a complete Elizabethan ward
robe, the costumes to be used in
"Taming of the Shrew" have not
been confined to any decade in the
last half of the sixteenth century,
but are made in pattern following
high styles over the last half of the
century. Costumes will differ there
fore, mainly in the treatment of the
necklines. The low neck of the late
century will be combined with the
neck ruffle of the earlier part of the
century.
"Shrew" This Week
"Taming of the Shrew," the Stan
ford Players' production for win
ter quarter will be presented Thurs
day, Friday, and Saturday nights of
this week, January 31, February 1
and 2. Tickets may be obtained in
room 202 of the Memorial Audito
rium, or at the Peninsula Box Of
fice for ninety cents. The curtain
will rise at 8:15.
Mrs. Lievsay has been assisted in
the costume department by Paula
Kanner. A minimum of eight yards
of material has gone into every
dress, and materials appropriate in
texture and color were dyed when
the correct cloth could not be ob
tained.
"Hip Rolls" Popular
Instead of the Elizabethan farth
ingale, which is a graduated bell
shaped hoop skirt and is difficult to
handle, the women in the will
wear hip rolls which were more
popular in Italy, which is the scene
of the play. Girls in the cast have
rehearsed a great deal in costume to
get used to the hip roll. Men in the
cast have found mantles and huge
Elizabethan hats hard to handle.
Jewelry, which was an important
part of the personal decoration of
Elizabethans, will be used on dresses
and hats and necklaces, ear-rings,
and rings have been made for the
costumes.
