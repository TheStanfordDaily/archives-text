Continuing its efforts to find
housing facilities for student vet
erans, Stanford University has ap
plied to the Federal Public Housing
Authority for any public housing
"that may become available in lo
cations within practicable commut
ing distance of the University,"
President Donald B. Tresidder an
nounced.
Locations specifically mentioned
in the application included Sunny
vale, Tanforan, San Carlos, and
particularly Dibble Hospital in the
event it should be vacated by the
Army.
Many Facilities Sought
The University's formal applica
tion was for 400 single occupancy
units and 200 units for married vet
erans, including some "suitable for
the accommodation of one or two
children in addition to man and
wife." The application also stated,
however, that substantial additional
facilities could be used to advantage
if they become available.
Since the FPHA does not yet
have application and contract forms
for use in connection with this type
of housing, the application was
made in the form of a letter to the
San Francisco regional office of the
FPHA, Dr. Tresidder said.
Campus Construction
The letter stated that Stanford is
projecting additional campus con
struction "as soon as materials and
manpower are available and the
sites can be prepared. This, of
course, will require some time and
our immediate need is for some
thing that can be used right away."
Stanford, Dr. Tresidder said, will
agree to bear any financial loss that
things to bear any financial loss that
might result from operation of such
facilities, will keep up current
maintenance and repairs, and will
return the housing to the govern
ment in approximately its present
condition, less reasonable deprecia
tion, when the emergency is over.
Operation of the facilities would be
on a non-profit basis.
