T j .'ay's election for Daily editor will be, in
c nee, a vote of confidence from staff mem
for Nada Skidmore, whom they asked be
allr vod to run. The names of no other candi
date will appear on the "ballot," since pres
ent ( i-aociate editors, originally scheduled to
l ii" is election, have declined to compete,
no explanation to the campus is nec-
The phrase "in order to slow dov/n the
} rcinotion rate, perhaps too rapid during war
ye;. and insure competent, experienced work
( ,s in key positions on the staff" has appeared
in the day-by-day account of the forthcoming
f-!b: non, and the Daily's right of self-determina
tion : appointments and policies is rarely ques
;d; yet these alone may not express the
b. . nground or expectations that prompted the
.stall's decision.
At present the composition of the Daily staff is
prn ■ pally women; the editor, one of the senior
me :rs of the staff, is only a second quarter
juni m. In the normal course of promotion, asso
ti editors are not appointed until the begin
ninn of their senior year, and the editor, when
re!, a ;d, looks forward to graduating at the same
time he completes his term. The question, how
tan', has not been solely whether an older edi
to v ould do the job better than a younger one,
but bother it would not be to the benefit of all
st: ' nembers as well if they had more expe
rience in each category of editing the paper. A
sophomore, promoted to associate editor now,
would have run the gamut of promotions by the
mic o of his junior year; some other sopho
more, if promoted to night editor' might be
force 1 to spend six or seven quarters in the
position because with preference going
to more competent workers or to returned staff
members, he could not go any higher.
That's the immediate aspect of today's modi
ficvl election. The staff wanted additional expe
rience before assuming higher positions of au
thority, and wanted this experience to be thor
ough and well balanced.
! ' •) one has accused the Daily of trying to pro
le ng the womanly reign in the editor's chair. At
present none other than a v/oman could have
readied the position, because there have been
no men eligible and perpetuation of the present
rn.- oeiate editors ostensibly insures at least two
more volumes under the supervision of a
worn n editor.
Ynt considering the composition of the pres
ent student body, the sudden reversal to a pre
dominance of men, the Daily is aware that
news of men's activities, attention to men's
cr.mpus problems- and a "manly" method of
presenting them will be demanded from the
students inemselves. Naturally we are further
eware that these demands would probably best
be satisfied by men writers and observers.
The staff has looked forward for a long time
to the quarter when the Shack would once more
be the scene of male enthusiasms, forums, and
football demonstrations; we have expected it,
and hoped for it, knowing that when the men
2 :n ained to the Daily it would be the time when
rrnn"l would also return to assume their share of
Ie [-arm's student responsibilities. It would be
normal and welcome outcome of the war's
end. And it would likely mean a man in the
famous swivel chair of the Shack.
So with these realizations before them why
.has the staff taken the step of outlining the
composition of the next two editorial boards,
and of supposing that the next two editors will
be women, isn't it illogical?
But consider, is it not logical to suppose (from
II e men-to-women ratio of the registration fig
ures) that within the next quarter and a half,
men will join our staff—men with experience
on the Daily before the war, or with other ex
perience fitting them for appointment to au
thoritative positions? Is it not probable that

men who feel their viewpoints are not being
completely or fairly presented will come to the
Shack and point this out to the persons respon
sible? And is it not fair to believe that a per
son with experience and a knowledge of the
staff is not better qualified to be a member of
editorial board than some one drafted from the
student body because he is a representative
"man." We sincerely hope so. We can say
now that it is wholly possible for a man to
compete at any time in the election for editor
if the staff requests it.
And so the "latch-string's out," and the way
is open for the composition of the staff to un
dergo the same changes as those now affect
ing the student body as a whole. The Daily's
realization that the staff needs to return to a
normal and fair rate of promotion is an indirect
but strong invitation to Stanford men to come
to the Daily, to give the edit columns and the
news stories their inimitable touch and, when it
is time, to take over the "keys to the Shack.
