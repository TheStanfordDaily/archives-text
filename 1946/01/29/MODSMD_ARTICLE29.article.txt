To the Editor:
Can bigotry be associated with Stanford or any other
University? The term itself is in direct opposition to
the ideals and purposes of all educational institutions,
and labeling a university as bigoted is as astonishing
as branding communism a capitalistic form of govern
ment! Yet, I believe that Stanford University is nar
row-minded.

My reason?—A university ruling that husband and
wife are not allowed to teach at Stanford at the same
time, unless a definite shortage of instructors or pro
fessors prevails in the department concerned. Obvious
ly this ruling is a result of faculty politics, another
unmentionable, but ever-present force. For if the
wife of one Stanford professor is on the teaching staff,
naturally, the wives of some other professors or in
structors will want to elevate themselves to this active
and trustworthy position, whether or not they are
qualified. But a blanket ruling, preventing a wife
from teaching, is entirely without foresight and ex
tremely irrational. A teacher should be chosen en
tirely on the basis of his or her merits
It is common knowledge that one of the best instruc
tors in the chemistry department is teaching qualita
tive analysis. She is believed by her students to be
one of the most praiseworthy teachers they have ever
known. However, she will not be teaching next quar
ter, because the University "emergency" is now non
existent, and she must once again retire to the back
ground.
I have no idea how many hundreds of students have
taken her course of instruction, but I can say with a
great deal of exactness, that a very large majority of
them have been enlightened on the subject of chem
istry to such an extent that the doors of science have
been opened to them, and they can now see far beyond
the fog of ignorance that had previously blanketed
their minds, and into an organized world of scientific
beauty. No, I am not being over-poetical when I say
that she has helped many a student to reach closer to
a star, which some day he may find in his hand, as did
the world-renowned Madame Curie.
In my opinion the "emergency" still, and always will
exist! Brilliant teachers who can explain a difficult
subject in simple, everyday terms, so their pupils can
grasp the full significance of every statement, are at a
very high premium today, and every day! Surely the
Board of Trustees of Stanford University realizes this
fact! Now. the students of chemistry at Stanford want
some action!

To the Editor:
Someone around here must have the idea that G.I.
Joe turned in his voice with his uniform. It is hard
to understand how such an attitude can be maintained
when even the casual observer knows that the former
G.l.'s outspoken opinions are far from silenced. Fur
thermore. I think that unless there are some changes
made soon, this University is going to hear plenty of
these opinions in direct and clamorous terms. I don't
claim to represent Joe by a long shot, but my guess is
that he'll be heard from first and loudest on the fol
lowing topics:
1. The fact that in more than a year, and with many
suggestions, Stanford hasn't been able to formulate a
method of registration which avoids the veteran's pet
antipthy—ianefficiency. Comment during the two
hour wait in the returning student veterans' line was
not. kind to the Administration, and understandably so.
2. The fact that students' wives who are not enrolled
are being treated as rank outsiders, thus preventing
the student from enjoying many campus activities.
Veterans are probably hardest hit because of finances.
How many veterans receiving (eventually) $90 a
month can con tin vie to pay $1.20 for their wives' tickets
to any basketball game besides an NC4A championship
contest (which last weekend's games were not)?
How many veterans will leave their wives home to
attend any ASSU-limited function ? How many mar
ried vets were thrilled by their priority on Hope tick
ets, knowing that their wives were completely banned?
Sure, there are ways to "get around" much of this,
but one gets tired of even the "necessary" minor dis
honesties.
Many of the girls affected by the school's attitude
in this regard are former Stanford students; all of
them are (or could be) as enthusiastic Stanford-ites as
their husbands. They should be given generous con
cessions before public opinion regards S.U. as too mer
cenary.
3. The fact that the Cellar charges considerably more
for poorer-quality food than can be found at lower
prices in commercially-operated restaurants in Paly.
This situation is even more distressing when one con
siders that the Cellar's volume of business is prob
ly the highest in its history, and that IT SHOULD
BE A NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION IF IT ISN'T.
4. The fact that Stanford hasn't done anything about
the veterans' housing when other schools, such an
UCLA and San Jose State, already have their plans in
operation. The Mothers' Club letter spoke of proposed
action on this problem.
We have talked on many of these problems, but on
action is forthcoming as other schools outdistance us.
Joe is soon going to demand of Stanford what the
Army demanded of him: Action, not words; and NO
EXCUSES!
Respectfully,
Samuel S. Sewall
(Editorial Note: Far from having "turned in his voice
with his uniform, former G.I. Joe, we believe, is going

Can bigotry be associated with Stanford or any other
University? The term itself is in direct opposition to
the ideals and purposes of all educational institutions,
and labeling a university as bigoted is as astonishing
as branding communism a capitalistic form of govern
ment! Yet, I believe that Stanford University is nar
row-minded.

My reason?—A university ruling that husband and
wife are not allowed to teach at Stanford at the same
time, unless a definite shortage of instructors or pro
fessors prevails in the department concerned. Obvious
ly this ruling is a result of faculty politics, another
unmentionable, but ever-present force. For if the
wife of one Stanford professor is on the teaching staff,
naturally, the wives of some other professors or in
structors will want to elevate themselves to this active
and trustworthy position, whether or not they are
qualified. But a blanket ruling, preventing a wife
from teaching, is entirely without foresight and ex
tremely irrational. A teacher should be chosen en
tirely on the basis of his or her merits
It is common knowledge that one of the best instruc
tors in the chemistry department is teaching qualita
tive analysis. She is believed by her students to be
one of the most praiseworthy teachers they have ever
known. However, she will not be teaching next quar
ter, because the University "emergency" is now non
existent, and she must once again retire to the back
ground.
I have no idea how many hundreds of students have
taken her course of instruction, but I can say with a
great deal of exactness, that a very large majority of
them have been enlightened on the subject of chem
istry to such an extent that the doors of science have
been opened to them, and they can now see far beyond
the fog of ignorance that had previously blanketed
their minds, and into an organized world of scientific
beauty. No, I am not being over-poetical when I say
that she has helped many a student to reach closer to
a star, which some day he may find in his hand, as did
the world-renowned Madame Curie.
In my opinion the "emergency" still, and always will
exist! Brilliant teachers who can explain a difficult
subject in simple, everyday terms, so their pupils can
grasp the full significance of every statement, are at a
very high premium today, and every day! Surely the
Board of Trustees of Stanford University realizes this
fact! Now. the students of chemistry at Stanford want

Someone around here must have the idea that G.I.
Joe turned in his voice with his uniform. It is hard
to understand how such an attitude can be maintained
when even the casual observer knows that the former
G.l.'s outspoken opinions are far from silenced. Fur
thermore. I think that unless there are some changes
made soon, this University is going to hear plenty of
these opinions in direct and clamorous terms. I don't
claim to represent Joe by a long shot, but my guess is
that he'll be heard from first and loudest on the fol
lowing topics:
1. The fact that in more than a year, and with many
suggestions, Stanford hasn't been able to formulate a
method of registration which avoids the veteran's pet
antipthy—ianefficiency. Comment during the two
hour wait in the returning student veterans' line was
not. kind to the Administration, and understandably so.
2. The fact that students' wives who are not enrolled
are being treated as rank outsiders, thus preventing
the student from enjoying many campus activities.
Veterans are probably hardest hit because of finances.
How many veterans receiving (eventually) $90 a
month can con tin vie to pay $1.20 for their wives' tickets
to any basketball game besides an NC4A championship
contest (which last weekend's games were not)?
How many veterans will leave their wives home to
attend any ASSU-limited function ? How many mar

subject in simple, everyday terms, so their pupils can
grasp the full significance of every statement, are at a
very high premium today, and every day! Surely the

To the Editor:
Someone around here must have the idea that G.I.
Joe turned in his voice with his uniform. It is hard
to understand how such an attitude can be maintained
when even the casual observer knows that the former
G.l.'s outspoken opinions are far from silenced. Fur
thermore. I think that unless there are some changes
made soon, this University is going to hear plenty of
these opinions in direct and clamorous terms. I don't
claim to represent Joe by a long shot, but my guess is
that he'll be heard from first and loudest on the fol
lowing topics:
1. The fact that in more than a year, and with many
suggestions, Stanford hasn't been able to formulate a
method of registration which avoids the veteran's pet
antipthy—ianefficiency. Comment during the two
hour wait in the returning student veterans' line was
not. kind to the Administration, and understandably so.
2. The fact that students' wives who are not enrolled
are being treated as rank outsiders, thus preventing
the student from enjoying many campus activities.
Veterans are probably hardest hit because of finances.
How many veterans receiving (eventually) $90 a
month can con tin vie to pay $1.20 for their wives' tickets
to any basketball game besides an NC4A championship
contest (which last weekend's games were not)?
How many veterans will leave their wives home to
attend any ASSU-limited function ? How many mar
ried vets were thrilled by their priority on Hope tick
ets, knowing that their wives were completely banned?
Sure, there are ways to "get around" much of this,
but one gets tired of even the "necessary" minor dis
honesties.
Many of the girls affected by the school's attitude
in this regard are former Stanford students; all of
them are (or could be) as enthusiastic Stanford-ites as
their husbands. They should be given generous con
cessions before public opinion regards S.U. as too mer
cenary.
3. The fact that the Cellar charges considerably more
for poorer-quality food than can be found at lower
prices in commercially-operated restaurants in Paly.
This situation is even more distressing when one con
siders that the Cellar's volume of business is prob
ly the highest in its history, and that IT SHOULD
BE A NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION IF IT ISN'T.
4. The fact that Stanford hasn't done anything about
the veterans' housing when other schools, such an
UCLA and San Jose State, already have their plans in
operation. The Mothers' Club letter spoke of proposed
action on this problem.
We have talked on many of these problems, but on
action is forthcoming as other schools outdistance us.
Joe is soon going to demand of Stanford what the
Army demanded of him: Action, not words; and NO
EXCUSES!

To the Editor:
Can bigotry be associated with Stanford or any other
University? The term itself is in direct opposition to
the ideals and purposes of all educational institutions,
and labeling a university as bigoted is as astonishing
as branding communism a capitalistic form of govern
ment! Yet, I believe that Stanford University is nar
row-minded.

My reason?—A university ruling that husband and
wife are not allowed to teach at Stanford at the same
time, unless a definite shortage of instructors or pro
fessors prevails in the department concerned. Obvious
ly this ruling is a result of faculty politics, another
unmentionable, but ever-present force. For if the
wife of one Stanford professor is on the teaching staff,
naturally, the wives of some other professors or in
structors will want to elevate themselves to this active
and trustworthy position, whether or not they are
qualified. But a blanket ruling, preventing a wife
from teaching, is entirely without foresight and ex
tremely irrational. A teacher should be chosen en
tirely on the basis of his or her merits
It is common knowledge that one of the best instruc
tors in the chemistry department is teaching qualita
tive analysis. She is believed by her students to be
one of the most praiseworthy teachers they have ever
known. However, she will not be teaching next quar
ter, because the University "emergency" is now non
existent, and she must once again retire to the back
ground.
I have no idea how many hundreds of students have
taken her course of instruction, but I can say with a
great deal of exactness, that a very large majority of
them have been enlightened on the subject of chem
istry to such an extent that the doors of science have
been opened to them, and they can now see far beyond
the fog of ignorance that had previously blanketed
their minds, and into an organized world of scientific
beauty. No, I am not being over-poetical when I say
that she has helped many a student to reach closer to
a star, which some day he may find in his hand, as did
the world-renowned Madame Curie.
In my opinion the "emergency" still, and always will
exist! Brilliant teachers who can explain a difficult
