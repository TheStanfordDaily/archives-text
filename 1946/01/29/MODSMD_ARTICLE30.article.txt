# I Club Discusses Japanese Mind
## 
### 
One of the most valuable things
the United Nations Organization
could do for peace would be to
launch a qampaign for the under
standing of peoples and nations, Dr.
Frederic Spiegelberg, instructor in
humanities, told members of Inter
national Club at a meeting held
Sunday evening.
In his address on "The Japanese
Mind" Mr. Spiegelberg stated that
the slogan "Remember Pearl Har
bor" ciuld be of value if it gave rise
to the realization of a need to be in
formed of the history, culture, and
the mind of the Japanese.
Hatred Dangerous
"It seems to mean let us keep the
hatred of the Japanese in mind."
Mr. Spiegelberg said. To keep one's
emotions and hatred alive is morally
disastrous, he pointed out, since
such feeling can block constructive
action in peace as in war.
How little the American people
knew of the Japanese mind is shown
by the fact that very few people
understood the Japanese language
at the time of Pearl Harbor, accord
ing to Mr. Spiegelberg.
"For the first year after Pearl
Harbor, government officials didn't
know whether to count the number
of persons who understood Japanese
on the fingers of two hands or one
hand," he said.
"To know one another is one of
the sure in life that are of
value, and the same is equally true
in international relations," Mr.
Spiegelberg asserted.
Inferiority Complex
In discussing the "inferiority
complex" of the Japanese, Mr. Spie
gelberg claimed that according to
history of their culture the Japanese
could have a basis for an "inferior
ity complex."
He pointed out that the Japanese
had derived their art and writing
from the Chinese, in addition to
customs, and economic and social
systems. From the United States
they gained their knowledge of
modern machinery and technology.
Mr. Spiegelberg described the
Japanese as "A students who took
their knowledge from some great
teachers, absorbed it well, and were
later able to add to it themselves."
In regard to the apparent lack of
individuality or personality in the
Japanese, Mr. Spiegelberg stated
that that characteristic was also
linked with the language.
Knowledge of Language Essential
According to Mr. Spiegelberg the
Japanese language is rich in forms
and endings, and is highly inflected.
"To truly know the Japanese you
have to know many languages," he
said. The Japanese has one lan
guage to speak to his superiors, an
other to speak to his wife, and still
another to speak to his servants."
Mr. Spiegelberg added that the
Japanese speak in prescribed for
mulas for prescribed occasion. "For
every situation a different treatment
of a word is necessary," he stated.
"The more he fails to introduce his
personality, the better educated he
is."
The Japanese thinks of himself
first of all as a member of a family,
as part of an entity, Mr, Spiegelberg
pointed out. In military matters, in
sports, and in religion this concept
carries through.
Influence of Buddhism
In giving a reason for the seem
ing detachment of the Japanese. Mr.
Spiegelberg named Buddhist indoc
trination. "Buddhist doctrines and

detachment help each other along,"
he said.
Mr. Spiegelberg added that this
feeling of detachment may go so far
that a .single person cares very little
for the "joys of life or the pursuit
of happiness."
He emphasized the fact that the
attitude of detachment of the Japa
nese often seemed like cruelty, es
pecially in the case of war.
"If detached toward death and
pain, the suffering of another does
n't master to the Japanese," he said.
If you don't think of yourself, you
don't think of others. The Japanese
can't imagine the feelings and emo
tions of a highly developed person
ality."
Democracy?
When questioned concerning the
chance for "democratization" of the
Japanese, Mr. Spiegelberg replied
that it could not be done unless the
whole attitude of the Japanese mind
were changed, "and that would be
extremely hard to do," he said.
"The only hope in that respect,"
he said, "would be to reach the
masses of uneducated and down
trodden people who could accept the
Western ideas more quickly, not
having been indoctrinated or having
hccepted completely these other at
titudes."—Mary Virginia Pond

He pointed out that the Japanese
had derived their art and writing
from the Chinese, in addition to
customs, and economic and social
systems. From the United States
they gained their knowledge of
modern machinery and technology.
Mr. Spiegelberg described the
Japanese as "A students who took
their knowledge from some great
teachers, absorbed it well, and were
later able to add to it themselves."
In regard to the apparent lack of
individuality or personality in the
Japanese, Mr. Spiegelberg stated
that that characteristic was also
linked with the language.
Knowledge of Language Essential
According to Mr. Spiegelberg the
Japanese language is rich in forms
and endings, and is highly inflected.
"To truly know the Japanese you
have to know many languages," he
said. The Japanese has one lan
guage to speak to his superiors, an
other to speak to his wife, and still
another to speak to his servants."
Mr. Spiegelberg added that the
Japanese speak in prescribed for
mulas for prescribed occasion. "For
every situation a different treatment
of a word is necessary," he stated.
"The more he fails to introduce his
personality, the better educated he
is."
The Japanese thinks of himself
first of all as a member of a family,
as part of an entity, Mr, Spiegelberg
pointed out. In military matters, in
sports, and in religion this concept
carries through.
Influence of Buddhism
In giving a reason for the seem
ing detachment of the Japanese. Mr.
Spiegelberg named Buddhist indoc
trination. "Buddhist doctrines and

detachment help each other along,"
he said.
Mr. Spiegelberg added that this
feeling of detachment may go so far
that a .single person cares very little
for the "joys of life or the pursuit
of happiness."
He emphasized the fact that the
attitude of detachment of the Japa
nese often seemed like cruelty, es
pecially in the case of war.
"If detached toward death and
pain, the suffering of another does
n't master to the Japanese," he said.
If you don't think of yourself, you
don't think of others. The Japanese
can't imagine the feelings and emo
tions of a highly developed person
ality."
Democracy?
When questioned concerning the
chance for "democratization" of the
Japanese, Mr. Spiegelberg replied
that it could not be done unless the
whole attitude of the Japanese mind
were changed, "and that would be
extremely hard to do," he said.
"The only hope in that respect,"
he said, "would be to reach the
masses of uneducated and down
trodden people who could accept the
Western ideas more quickly, not
having been indoctrinated or having
hccepted completely these other at
titudes."—Mary Virginia Pond
One of the most valuable things
the United Nations Organization
could do for peace would be to
launch a qampaign for the under
standing of peoples and nations, Dr.
Frederic Spiegelberg, instructor in
humanities, told members of Inter
national Club at a meeting held
Sunday evening.
In his address on "The Japanese
Mind" Mr. Spiegelberg stated that
the slogan "Remember Pearl Har
bor" ciuld be of value if it gave rise
to the realization of a need to be in
formed of the history, culture, and
the mind of the Japanese.
Hatred Dangerous
"It seems to mean let us keep the
hatred of the Japanese in mind."
Mr. Spiegelberg said. To keep one's
emotions and hatred alive is morally
disastrous, he pointed out, since
such feeling can block constructive
action in peace as in war.
How little the American people
knew of the Japanese mind is shown
by the fact that very few people
understood the Japanese language
at the time of Pearl Harbor, accord
ing to Mr. Spiegelberg.
"For the first year after Pearl
Harbor, government officials didn't
know whether to count the number
of persons who understood Japanese
on the fingers of two hands or one
hand," he said.
"To know one another is one of
the sure in life that are of
value, and the same is equally true
in international relations," Mr.
Spiegelberg asserted.

Mr. Spiegelberg added that this
feeling of detachment may go so far
that a .single person cares very little
for the "joys of life or the pursuit
of happiness."
He emphasized the fact that the
attitude of detachment of the Japa
nese often seemed like cruelty, es
pecially in the case of war.
"If detached toward death and
pain, the suffering of another does
n't master to the Japanese," he said.
If you don't think of yourself, you
don't think of others. The Japanese
can't imagine the feelings and emo
tions of a highly developed person
ality."
Democracy?
When questioned concerning the
chance for "democratization" of the
Japanese, Mr. Spiegelberg replied
that it could not be done unless the
whole attitude of the Japanese mind
were changed, "and that would be
extremely hard to do," he said.
"The only hope in that respect,"
he said, "would be to reach the
masses of uneducated and down
trodden people who could accept the
Western ideas more quickly, not
having been indoctrinated or having
hccepted completely these other at
titudes."—Mary Virginia Pond
