There has been a spreading interest in ping pong on the cam
pus in recent months. The Stanford "Roughs" who are unable
to take an active part in intercollegiate or intramural sports like
football, baseball and basketball, have discovered the wonderful
opportunities ping pong offers. The invigorating sport has been
ignored long enough by the Daily, so here goes a little exposition
on the game of table tennis.
After a diligent search by this writer, the center of all ping
pong activities on the campus was located at Tyler Hall, high
?mong the hills. This writer had noticed before that the ping
pong table was centrally located, so that you inevitably stumbled
into it at the world famed Tyler "blackout" firesides. The more
ardent ping pongster had suggested that the table be moved
into the sleeping porch so they could play while the dance was
going on, but this met with a loud clamorâ€”the table was needed
cit the dance for more obvious reasons.
ENTHUSIASTS AT TYLER
Tyler was found seething with ping pong enthusiasts of every
type and genre. A few of the confiding types told this writer that
nearly everybody spent most of their time playing ping pong,
instead of studying at the hilltop house. In fact, the sport is so
popular that high hall moguls are seriously considering installing
tables on every floor, so everybody can be accommodated.
There are several types of ping pong players which the
reader should be acquainted with, if he ever decides to try table
tennis. You can always spot the "ball shark" because he always
says,"I only played once or twice before; let's kinda have a
practice round. Whaddya say?" In actuality, this player has
probably been at the game since he doffed the diapers, or even
before.
"SHOTGUN CHARLIE"
Another type is the "shotgun Charlie" player who stands five
feet back from the table and sends the ball over the net with
the speed of an express train. This player is very dangerous be
cause you inevitably double up when the zinging ping pong ball
smashes you in the stomach.
Still another type is the "master strategist." He stares va
cantly at a fly on the ceiling, or reminisces about that Saturday
night dat euntil you look up, then carefully plants a shot just
where you ain't- and chalks up another point. If you v/ant to en
gage, in a tantalizing game of ping pong, hook up with the last
type.
An interview by appointment was secured with Noble D.
Barry, self-styled champion and ping pong expert. After spend
ing fifteen minutes outlining his qualifications, background, and
strategems, which he added, were off the record, but still very
interesting and useful; he released the following statement for
the press:
BARRY SPEAKS
"Ping pong is the future sport of America. Even of the world.
I would like to see more outstanding boys and girls take up this
interesting sport. Even boys and girls who aren't outstanding
should indulge in ping pong, for they will then become outstand
ing. It would keep them off the streets and eliminate juvenile
delinquency. A ping pong table in every home! Through ping
pong to a better world. Ping pong MARCHES ON!!!"
Barry further mentioned that there was nobody in the Tyler
ping pong set who was good enough to play him. If anybody
cn the campus wants to play a game of ping pong, just call
N. David Barry, Tyler Hall.
