# Farm Basketball Squad Shows Great Improvement
## Three Victories In Row Expected 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
Don't look now, bul Stanford's
basketballeis are currently showing
all the earmarks of a team that is
certain of winning its next three
games, namely Del Monte Naval
Training Station tomorrow night,
College of Pacific FFriday night and
University of San Francisco Satur
day night—all in the Farm's Pavil
ion.
Impossible? Don't kid yourself,
kid. None of the aforementioned
clubs is in the class of a world
beater. Matter of fact, one might
say that (hey were none too hot.
even if the record showed other
wise.
Who Is Del Monte?
And the record doesn't. Del Mon
te is purely a question mark. No
body knows from nothing; their

lineup is purely a list of so many
names, and their record is non
existent in regard to previous
games.
C.O.P. is a slightly different mat
ter, but not much. The Stockton
Tigers have played 15 games, same
as Stanford, and have won seven
while losing eight. (Stanford has
won three and lost twelve.)
But if you take the time to con
sider the caliber of C.O.P.'s oppon
ents, the record is not quite so im
pressive. It's no feather in anyone's
cap to whip a bunch of junior col
lege kids, which is what C.O.P. has
been playing in most of its games.
The only blight spot on the Tiger
escutcheon is a 41-39 decision over
Nevada, which in turn shaded the
arm. However, Nevada turned right
around the following night to
soundly thump C.0.P., which takes
care of that angle very nicely.
U.S.I'. Is Better
U.S.F. has a slightly more im
pressive record, but the Dons have
shown that they can be beaten. The
big-city boys started off like a two
bit lighter first time out of the
showcase. The Dons proceeded to
ring the bell seven consecutive
times. Their last five starts have not
been quite up to par; matter of fact,
they've lost them all.
The Farm came out of its two
game tussle with U.S.C. in fairly de
cent condition, meaning that no
body has had to reach for more ad
hesive tape than the ration board
allows. And despite the double loss
to the P.C.C. league leaders, Coaches
Everett Dean and Fordy Anderson
believe that the Indians will show
a lot more promise in the future as
a result of the showing.
Outplayed the Trojans
The Indians outplayed Troy in
the first game on the court, the
wizardry of the Trojan shooters
supplying the winning margin. In
th» second game, it is doubtful if
any team could have beaten U.S.C.

in the first half. The visitors could
not miss, and Stanford hasn't an
experienced enough team to over
come a 19-point deficit. The Injuns
outscored Troy in the second half,
28-22, but the damage had been
done.
At any rate, if the Cards continue
to turn in exemplary court play,
and improve their shooting eye, they
have a better-than-average chance
of making it rough for the rest of
the schedule.

hesive tape than the ration board
allows. And despite the double loss
to the P.C.C. league leaders, Coaches
Everett Dean and Fordy Anderson
believe that the Indians will show
a lot more promise in the future as
a result of the showing.
Outplayed the Trojans
The Indians outplayed Troy in
the first game on the court, the
wizardry of the Trojan shooters
supplying the winning margin. In
th» second game, it is doubtful if
any team could have beaten U.S.C.

in the first half. The visitors could
not miss, and Stanford hasn't an
experienced enough team to over
come a 19-point deficit. The Injuns
outscored Troy in the second half,
28-22, but the damage had been
done.
At any rate, if the Cards continue
to turn in exemplary court play,
and improve their shooting eye, they
have a better-than-average chance
of making it rough for the rest of
the schedule.


COACH EVERETT DEAN
Don't look now, bul Stanford's
basketballeis are currently showing
all the earmarks of a team that is
certain of winning its next three
games, namely Del Monte Naval
Training Station tomorrow night,
College of Pacific FFriday night and
University of San Francisco Satur
day night—all in the Farm's Pavil
ion.
Impossible? Don't kid yourself,
kid. None of the aforementioned
clubs is in the class of a world
beater. Matter of fact, one might
say that (hey were none too hot.
even if the record showed other
wise.
Who Is Del Monte?
And the record doesn't. Del Mon
te is purely a question mark. No
body knows from nothing; their

lineup is purely a list of so many
names, and their record is non
existent in regard to previous
games.
C.O.P. is a slightly different mat
ter, but not much. The Stockton
Tigers have played 15 games, same
as Stanford, and have won seven
while losing eight. (Stanford has
won three and lost twelve.)
But if you take the time to con
sider the caliber of C.O.P.'s oppon
ents, the record is not quite so im
pressive. It's no feather in anyone's
cap to whip a bunch of junior col
lege kids, which is what C.O.P. has
been playing in most of its games.
The only blight spot on the Tiger
escutcheon is a 41-39 decision over
Nevada, which in turn shaded the
arm. However, Nevada turned right
around the following night to
soundly thump C.0.P., which takes
care of that angle very nicely.
U.S.I'. Is Better
U.S.F. has a slightly more im
pressive record, but the Dons have
shown that they can be beaten. The
big-city boys started off like a two
bit lighter first time out of the
showcase. The Dons proceeded to
ring the bell seven consecutive
times. Their last five starts have not
been quite up to par; matter of fact,
they've lost them all.
The Farm came out of its two
game tussle with U.S.C. in fairly de
cent condition, meaning that no
body has had to reach for more ad
hesive tape than the ration board
allows. And despite the double loss
to the P.C.C. league leaders, Coaches
