## Phi Psi's Swamped 
### 
In the most lopsided game of the
intramural season to date, the Phi
Psi's were snowed under by the
powerful Nimitz (N.R.0.T.C.) team
by th? disconcerting score of 34-4.
The score itself is the best comment
that could be given on this game.
As can easily be seen, the Navy
boys were never in trouble. High
point man for the Toyon squad was
Shoup, with ten to his credit. Ev
erett Dean might do well to look
over this outfit; the sailors really
played a game.
Zeta Psi's Down Lincoln
One-sided games seemed to be
the Monday night theme as the
Zeta Psi's dumped Lincoln easily,
34-21, over in the gym. In Mr. Sher's
other gymnasium attraction, the
Pierce Hall squad sat and twiddled
their thumbs, "waiting for the Wash
ington team that never showed up.
(Pierce gets a 2-0 victory on that
one.)
Some would probably like to
know the score of the Encina 1W-
Firehouse game. So would we. Will
the referees please phone in the re
sults of both games after this?
Thanks.
Games tonight will see the Legal
Eagles matched against Encina IE
in the Pavilion at 7:30, and Jefferson
playing Johnson at 8:30. In the gym,
it's Hayes vs. Cleveland at 7:30 and
Buchanan vs. Taft at 8:30.
