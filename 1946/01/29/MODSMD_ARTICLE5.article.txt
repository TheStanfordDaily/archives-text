# Atom Bomb Power Told
## 
### 
David L. Lobster, former head of
the Physics Department, spoke be
fore the Sludent Association for
Atomic Control last night. Profes
sor Felix Bloch was unexpectedly
detained from attending the meet
ing.
Dr. Webster was engaged during
the war in important governmental
research work on ballistics and
rockets at the Aberdeen proving
grounds in Maryland, and has only
recently returned to the University.
Atomic Bomb .Differs
The fact that the atomic bomb is
not just like any other bomb was
particularly stressed in Dr. Web
ster's talk. He explained this state
ment by giving a wealth of techni
cal material.
His main stress was on its three
fold striking power: (1) extreme
heat, (2) powerful concussion wave,
(3) gamma ray and ultraviolet emis
sions. He concluded that the atomic
bomb was millions of times as
powerful as the same weight of
TNT.
World Knows "Secret"
Since most of the principles be
hind the bomb are known to the
world, and since many other nations
besides America and England made
important contributions toward its
discovery, the two nations cannot
hope to be sole possessors of the
bomb for long. Mr. Webster stated
that "there must be thorough in
spections by the UNO to prevent
such manufacture; such inspections
arc technically possible.
The business part of the meeting
consisted of a short news resume by
George Brunn, and Charlie Clark
urged all members to join in the
organization's project to contact 800
universities throughout the nation.
Merrill T. Spalding, associate pro
fessor of history, will be the guest
speaker at the next meeting on
Feb. 4.
