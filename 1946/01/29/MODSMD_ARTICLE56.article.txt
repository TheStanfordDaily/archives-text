# Col. Fairman Returns From AMG Command
## 
### MARY ANN McCOMB 
Colonel Charles Fairman, profes
sor of political science now on leave
of absence, returned recently to
this country after spending two and
a half years with the United States
Army in North Africa and Europe.
Colonel Fairman left Stanford in
May of 1942 to go into the army.
The first year he spent in Washing
ton in the War Plans Division of
the Judge Advocate General's Of
fice. His work there was concerned
with the problem of international
and constitutional law.
In May of 1943 he was sent over
seas to the Allied Force Headquar
ters at Algiers to be chief counsel
of the Allied Military Government
of Occupied Territory. Shortly af
ter he arrived, a staff section at Al
lied Headquarters was created to
handle problems of military gov
ernment in Italy. This was first
called the military government sec
tion, but its name was later changed
to the now-familiar G-5. Colonel
Fairman was ordered there as legal
adviser.
Italian Relations
In September of 1943, with the

completion of the armistice with the
Italian government of Marshal Ba
doglio, this body was confronted
with the problem of relations with
that co-belligerent government and
of administering the armistice.
Italy was the first of the Axis
powers to submit to the Allies.
Therefore, it was the first Fascist
country where the Allies faced the
problem of bringing into existence
a democratic civil administration on
the ruins of a Fascist regime. Ac
cording to Colonel Fairman, we can
hardly appreciate how difficult it is
to re-establish any measure of local
initiative even on the lowest levels
among people who for 20 years had
had all political energy stifled.
The policy of the military gov
ernment was to call on the Italians,
under the supervision of the Allied
Control Commission, to carry on in
the rear areas those administrative
functions which were compatible
with our own military needs. This
policy has now been carried on to
a great extent. At present the Ital
ian nation is working out its own
problems by its own means, and the
Allied supervision has become ex
ceedingly attenuated.
Attains Top Itank
In October of 1944 Colonel Fair
man was requested by the head
quarters of the European theater
for the position of Chief of the In
ternational Law Division in the of
fice of the Theater Judge Advocate.
As he had been on the job in both
North Africa and Italy probably
longer than any other officer in any

single military government posi
tion, Colonel Fairman was anxious
to make the change and go to the
European theater to which at that
time most of the Allied energies had
been transferred. Incident to his
change to another theater, he was
given a month's leave to come home,
(.and Warfare
His last year overseas was spent
at the headquarters of the United
States forces in the European thea
ter. He was first stationed in Paris
and subsequently at Frankfort, Ger
many. His work there was largely
concerned with the problem of the
rules of land warfare, the law of
beligerent occupation, treatment of
prisoners of war and disarmed en
emy forces, disposition of captured
property, and like matters.
During the last three months be
fore coming home, Colonel Fair
man's work kept him in rapid mo
tion between Weisbaden where the
War Crimes Center is located. Ber
lin, the seat of the Office of Military
Government for Germany, and Nu
remberg where Justice Jackson has
his office.
Ordered Home
In December Colonel Fairman
was ordered back to Washington on
a mission to the War Department,
with orders that took him home for
a discharge upon its completion.
During the time he was overseas,
Colonel Fairman stated that he saw
quite a few of his former students
and colleagues from Stanford and
elsewhere. He always kept an aerial
view of the Stanford campus on the
wall beside his desk, and found that
the picture continually drew forth
some pleasant reference to Stanford
University on the part of the visi
tors who noticed it.
Colonel Fairman will resume his
position as professor of political sci
ence spring quarter.
