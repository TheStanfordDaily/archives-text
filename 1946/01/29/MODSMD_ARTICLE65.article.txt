Most powerful fighter in the world, this new Consolidated Yultee XP-81 built for the AAF, Is the first
plane to fly with a gas turbine engine designed for propeller drive. Powered by a General Electric gas
turbine engine in the nose and a G. E. jet engine in the tail, the trim fighter will fly at a speed of more
than 500 miles per hour. High efficiency of the engines, which usually burn kerosene, also enables the
XP-81 to cruise over long ranges. The two engines operate indcp?ndently and their combined power is
virtually the same as that produced by all four engines on a li-29 Superfortress. The front engine, which
has a four-blade propeller of 12 feet diameter, is known as the General Electric TG-IGO, Propjct. The rear
unit is designated, 1-40, and is also built by G. E. The versatile fighter can fly on both engines or either
one. Gross weight of the single place lighter is 1!),500 pounds. Its NACA laminar flow wing has a span
of 50 feet six inches, its length is 44 feet eight inches, and height 1j feet 6 inches. It is equipped with a
tricycle landing gear.
