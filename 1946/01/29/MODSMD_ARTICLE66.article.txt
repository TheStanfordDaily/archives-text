# Dr. Greene Tells Roble Women How to Benefit from College
## 
### 
'"Why Did You Come to College?"
was the subject of a talk given by
Theodore M. Greene, visiting pro
fessor of humanities from Princeton,
at Roble last night.
Dr. Greene reviewed the various
reasons for coming to college given
by college women, and said that if
every one he asked were to give a
really honest answer, the number of
different replies would be appalling.
Some of the reasons which he had
been given were: inertia or the de
sire to come because "it is the thing
to do"; the desire for social contacts,
particularly sororities and fraterni
ties; and what he considers one of
the best reasons for coming to col
lege, the desire for education.
Why Are You Here?
One of the first questions which
a college student should ask himself,
said Dr. Greene, is "What do I want
an education to give me?" The an
swers to this question, too, he said
are many and varied.
Most college students want to get
married; to find work which not
only gives financial remuneration
and is useful, but work which is
really interesting; to find a place in
society in which they can be of use
to the people around them.
Find Your Loyalty
In order to accomplish all ihcse
things, Dr. Greene said, an individ
ual must find something in the uni
verse which is so interesting that
other things—families, friends, and
his place in society—seem subordi
nated to it. The person should see
all these things simply absorbed by
a loyalty which is greater than any
thing around him.
In answer to the question, "How
can I find an interesting husband?"
or "How can I find interesting
friends?" Dr. Greene said that one
must be interesting himself. By be
ing interesting, he stated, you will
appeal to interesting people, and be
ing interesting depends upon being
interested.
"Becoming Interesting"
College should help you to be

come interesting, Dr. Greene said,
! by giving you five things: language,
a knowledge of facts, an idea of
i values, some conception of religion,
i and perspective. The language of
[ college students is terrible, in his
j opinion, that of the Western schools
j being much worse than that of the
j Eastern schools. The ability to carry
| on an intelligent conversation, to
J enjoy a good book, depends on a
| knowledge of language.
Even though a person has a good
! vocabulary at his command, a
| knowledge of important facts is nec
! essary, and this can be gained
; through a liberal education. Coup
j led with this, an idea of values is
i important not only in carrying on
I an intelligent conversation, but in
j the overall attribute of being inter
! esting.
Religion Counts
Some knowledge of religion is im
portant, Dr. Greene stated, because
without it an individual is missing
t something which can serve to make
j him more interesting and more in
\ terested in things around him.
Lastly, a college education should
give one perspective. The provin
cialism shown all over the world
should be eliminated, and it is the

job of a liberal education to break
down the walls of narrow perspec
tive, he said.
Take It or Leave It
If a college student is unable to
discover what he wants from his
education, and how he can get it,
by the end of his freshman year,
Dr. Greene advises him to leave
school, for "there are plenty of use
ful jobs for uninteresting people
who don't want interesting work."
The question "Why Did You
Come to College?" is a vital one,
Dr. Greene said, not only for the
individual, but for society as a
.vhoie.

Some knowledge of religion is im

j him more interesting and more in
\ terested in things around him.
Lastly, a college education should
give one perspective. The provin

should be eliminated, and it is the

job of a liberal education to break
down the walls of narrow perspec
tive, he said.
Take It or Leave It
If a college student is unable to
discover what he wants from his
education, and how he can get it,
by the end of his freshman year,
Dr. Greene advises him to leave
school, for "there are plenty of use
ful jobs for uninteresting people
who don't want interesting work."
The question "Why Did You
Come to College?" is a vital one,
Dr. Greene said, not only for the
individual, but for society as a
.vhoie.
'"Why Did You Come to College?"
was the subject of a talk given by
Theodore M. Greene, visiting pro
fessor of humanities from Princeton,
at Roble last night.
Dr. Greene reviewed the various
reasons for coming to college given
by college women, and said that if
every one he asked were to give a
really honest answer, the number of
different replies would be appalling.
Some of the reasons which he had
been given were: inertia or the de
sire to come because "it is the thing
to do"; the desire for social contacts,
particularly sororities and fraterni
ties; and what he considers one of
the best reasons for coming to col
lege, the desire for education.
Why Are You Here?
One of the first questions which
a college student should ask himself,
said Dr. Greene, is "What do I want
an education to give me?" The an
swers to this question, too, he said
are many and varied.
Most college students want to get
married; to find work which not
only gives financial remuneration
and is useful, but work which is
really interesting; to find a place in
society in which they can be of use
to the people around them.
Find Your Loyalty
In order to accomplish all ihcse
things, Dr. Greene said, an individ
ual must find something in the uni
verse which is so interesting that
other things—families, friends, and
his place in society—seem subordi
nated to it. The person should see
all these things simply absorbed by
a loyalty which is greater than any
thing around him.
In answer to the question, "How
can I find an interesting husband?"
or "How can I find interesting
friends?" Dr. Greene said that one
must be interesting himself. By be
ing interesting, he stated, you will
appeal to interesting people, and be
ing interesting depends upon being
interested.
"Becoming Interesting"
College should help you to be

come interesting, Dr. Greene said,
! by giving you five things: language,
a knowledge of facts, an idea of
i values, some conception of religion,
i and perspective. The language of
[ college students is terrible, in his
j opinion, that of the Western schools
j being much worse than that of the
j Eastern schools. The ability to carry
| on an intelligent conversation, to

| knowledge of language.
