Marylou McClure, chairman of
Housing Committee, read the sug
gestions made at the last meeting
in regard to the women's housing
plan by three sophomore guests.
Conference members discussed
them, but no action was taken.
They were to he discussed in house
meetings last night and put up for
further discussion next week.
Some of the suggestions were, (1)
giving sponsors who do not wish to
return to the living group they left
drawing preference over their class;
(2) making it possible for women to
draw according to their social class
instead of their academic class if
they wish; and (3), holding a poll
for all women to get their opinions
on the present housing plan and sug
gestions for its improvement.
It was also suggested (4) that
Housing Committee be made an
elective body so it would be more
representative, (5) that women not
move into small houses unless
they know someone in the house,
(6) that transfers who have been
at Stanford only a short time not
have preference over sophomores
who have Wen here much longer,
and (7)) that a sophomore speak
to the freshmen and transfers
about room drawing because of
her experience from last year.
Jane Irwin, chairman of the Honor
Code Standing Committee, urged
more education on the Honor Code
so that its standard will be kept up.
The Honor Code as well as the whole
Fundamental Standard needs revi
talizing, and the women can help to
make people aware of it, she said.
It was suggested that students try
again the system of pencil tapping
that has been neglected the past few
years. It involves upholding the
third person responsibility in a class
room by tapping a pencil when
someone appears to be cheating.
