### 
PITTSBURGH, Jan. 29 (UP). —Amid persistent but unconfirmed
reports of an earlv break in the steel strike deadlock, the shock of
the walkout tonight was reaching out to many smaller plants.
A United States Steel Corp. spokesman here said Benjamin F.
Fairless, company president, denied that there has been any settle
ment reached in the nine-day strike.
The U.S. Steel spokesman quoted Fairless as saying, "There was
absolutely no truth in the report that U.S. steel had agreed to pay an
lH'a-cent increase and would receive a $4 a ton price increase."
A spokesman for the CIO United Steelworkers said union president
Philip Murray had phoned strike headquarters from Washington about
5:30 p.m., but "he knew nothing then" about the reported settlement.
The spokesman said that Murray said "not a word" about the reports.
