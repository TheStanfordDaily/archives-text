WASHINGTON, Jan. 2<J (UP).â€”
j The Army today revealed develop
| menls in its radar and rocket equip
j mcnt which a spokesman said will
make modern artillery guns obso
lete and .should hasten the day when
radio-controlled airships will streak
through solar .space.
Lt. Gen. Levin R. Campbell, Jr.,
retiring chief of Army ordnance, dis-
I closed that the Army's radio-con
trolled rockets arc capable of de
veloping into missiles that can reach
any point on the earth's surface. The
present rocket is "earth-bound" but
can rise 50 miles above the earth.
This development, coupled with
Ihe Signal Corps' recent achievement
in bouncing radar pulses nfT the
moon, means that scientists can now
| work out the problem of guiding
space ships beyond the earth's at
mosphere.
"The artillery gun as we know
it," Campbell said, "will some day
become obsolete and be replaced by
a gun-and-rockct combination. This
missile will be fired from a gun but
will use rocket power to maintain
momentum.
Campbell's revelations followed
I announcement by Maj. Gen. George
1 L. Van Deusen, chief signal officer,
that the Army is increasing the pow
; er of its radar equipment so that the
; moon may be observed throughout
its journey across the sky.
