# Yell Tryouts Tomorrow

### 
According to the Stanford con
stitution two assistant yell leaders
arc elected by the student body
from six tryoulees each winter quar
ter, announced Joan McDonough,
president of Cardinals.
During the war this was waived,
but now that the campus is again on
a peactime basis the ruling once
more will be followed. Two try
outees acted as assistant yell leaders
at the games last weekend, and two
more tryoutees will be given their
opportunity to show the student
body what they can do at the games
this weekend.
A meeting of all men who have
already tried out and all those who
would like to try out will be held to
morrow night in the Nitery at 8:30
p.m., said Miss McDonough.
"We need as many men as pos
sible at the meeting Thursday so
two assistants may be chosen for
Friday night," concluded Miss Mc-
Donough.
