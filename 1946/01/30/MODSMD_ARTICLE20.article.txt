## 
### 
A magnificent free trip was
taken by ItirtO people last night
when Austen West presented an
illustrated lecture entitled "South
Africa, Land of Tomorrow," he
fore a filled auditorium.
Mr, West, who has been an officer
in the South African army as well
as having been a rancher, presented
South Africa in all its reality and
picturesqueness by appealing to the
audience with humor, interest and
charm. The beautiful scenery and
the interesting tribal rites became
real with a nostalgic sense in the
carefully chosen words and pictures
of the speaker.
With (he illustration of a map,
Mr. West began by stressing the
strategic position of South Africa,
both in the past and future as
well as in the present. In words
and on the screen the history of
the country was traced, from the
exiled Huguenots and the Boers
to the modern industries and
farmlands of today.
The streets of Capetown and Jo
hannesberg, with its flower vendors,
and the rocky tides around the coast
land—the statues and monuments of
Cecil Rhodes were pictured and ad
mired.
From Capetown, with its fa
mous university, to Johanneshcrg
and its stock exchange, the cam
era traveled. And from (here the
scene shifted to the Veld to Zu
luland, to Rhodesia, to Pondoland.
and finally to Durban. Whereas
Pondoland may be remembered
for its pipesmoking and hard
working women, Durban will be
thought of in connection with its
great eastern spirit. The city is
mainly populated by Indians.
Mr. West concluded his free trip
and stated that whereas South Africa
is not as dark as in the past, how
ever behind its quick modern growth
there is a continuous struggle be
tween the white man and the witch
doctor. This struggle is particularly
in the form of medicine.—Ryall.
