Tii housing program for women has recently
bo:> • the brunt of criticism, some of it construc
ts jc and some of it based upon a scanty knowl
edge of ihe background of Lhe plan as it is now
opcj citing. The success of the program up to
this time has received what we consider to be
premature judgment. We maintain that we will
be ui to pass final approval or disapproval
on it until several years have passed . . . years
in which the housing situation is normal, and
in which a great deal of effort has been ex
pended to make the plan develop its inherent
values. However, it is a good time to consider
just what have been the results of the first quar
ter of the plan's application, and to discuss
some ot the snags which it has hit.
We feel that it has reached a limited level of
success. On the positive side we place the
cooperative attitude of the former sorority
houses, and the effort which they pui forward
to welcome and to absorb sophomores into the
traditions and routine of house life. We have
a similar effort, certainly not complete as yet,
on part of other halls and houses to retain
t) ir individual characteristics and yet provide
a more friendly welcome and a place for new
women in their activities.
On the negative side is the fact that with the
unur u :lly large class of women which entered
in 1: M, it has been impossible, from a practical
standpoint, to ensure that a sufficient number
of women receive one of their top preferences
in residence. What seems important here is
that this would have happened under any sys
tem of residence choice, and therefore is not a
fair indication of the desirability of the present
cystem. Housing Committee devised the plan
With ihe hope that it represented the long-range,
viewpoint; it is our contention that we must con
tinue to examine it with that eye on the future,
realizing that the swollen housing conditions
which necessitated the "shrinking" of Juniper
and eventually of The Redwoods and Branner
will not distort the natural results of the sys
tem's use a year or so from now.
Another item on the negative side is the
lack of education (due in part to the newness
of the plan), which hampered the whole social
program last year. Many freshmen* did not un
derstand either the principles of the .plan, or
the practical differences between types of liv
ing units. This year the opportunity for learning
these things is being presented to the freshmen
women by speakers sponsored by Housing
Committee; and it is, we believe, up to the
freshmen in justice to themselves to consider
their choice of residence as carefully as they
would that of their University course, or of a
career. It is up to them, with the help of the
older students, to become acquainted with the
women in as many of the residences as possi
ble, not just of one, for this is the best way to
insure that they find congenial fellow-residents,
whether they receive their first choice or fifth.

ts jc and some of it based upon a scanty knowl
edge of ihe background of Lhe plan as it is now
opcj citing. The success of the program up to
this time has received what we consider to be
premature judgment. We maintain that we will
be ui to pass final approval or disapproval
on it until several years have passed . . . years
in which the housing situation is normal, and
in which a great deal of effort has been ex
pended to make the plan develop its inherent
values. However, it is a good time to consider
just what have been the results of the first quar
ter of the plan's application, and to discuss
some ot the snags which it has hit.
We feel that it has reached a limited level of
success. On the positive side we place the
cooperative attitude of the former sorority
houses, and the effort which they pui forward
to welcome and to absorb sophomores into the
traditions and routine of house life. We have
a similar effort, certainly not complete as yet,
on part of other halls and houses to retain
t) ir individual characteristics and yet provide
a more friendly welcome and a place for new
women in their activities.
On the negative side is the fact that with the
unur u :lly large class of women which entered
in 1: M, it has been impossible, from a practical
standpoint, to ensure that a sufficient number
of women receive one of their top preferences
in residence. What seems important here is
that this would have happened under any sys
tem of residence choice, and therefore is not a
fair indication of the desirability of the present
cystem. Housing Committee devised the plan
With ihe hope that it represented the long-range,
viewpoint; it is our contention that we must con
tinue to examine it with that eye on the future,
realizing that the swollen housing conditions
which necessitated the "shrinking" of Juniper
and eventually of The Redwoods and Branner
will not distort the natural results of the sys
tem's use a year or so from now.
Another item on the negative side is the
lack of education (due in part to the newness
of the plan), which hampered the whole social
program last year. Many freshmen* did not un
derstand either the principles of the .plan, or
the practical differences between types of liv
ing units. This year the opportunity for learning
these things is being presented to the freshmen
women by speakers sponsored by Housing
Committee; and it is, we believe, up to the
freshmen in justice to themselves to consider
their choice of residence as carefully as they
would that of their University course, or of a
career. It is up to them, with the help of the
older students, to become acquainted with the
women in as many of the residences as possi
ble, not just of one, for this is the best way to
insure that they find congenial fellow-residents,
whether they receive their first choice or fifth.
