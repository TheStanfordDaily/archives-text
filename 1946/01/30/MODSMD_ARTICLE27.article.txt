### STANLEY WILSON 
A very imposing bit of literature is presented
in the current issue of Life magazine v/hich is
beyond comparison. It is the report by Win
ston Churchill on the course of the v/ar in the
grim, black days of April, 1942. It is a frighten
ing thing to read, and a revelation of just how
far back on our heels we were jn those days.
The document was a secret war speech deliv

ered to the House of Commons and no punches
were pulled by the ex-Prime Minister. If you
collect contemporary historic documents in
your head, read it.

At this point a Rally Com member has stuck
his head in the door and reminded this depart
ment to call attention to all hidden song and
yell talent. There are three pairs of nylons
and a sweater awaiting you potential Irving
Berlins who prove your worth in the current
Rally Com sponsored contest. What easier way
is there of impressing the gal friend than pre
senting her with three pairs of gam-glorifiers?
Show your vim, get in the swim and write all
you kin. . . . Egad, see how a Rally Com man
can upset your equilibrium?
Plato once said that a man is responsible for
his own unhappiness and his own problems.
Do you think we could apply that gem of phi
losophy to the problems present about Stan
ford? Then if we are the ones responsible, we
are the ones to correct the existing disturb
ances. It seems to follow in that vein anyhow.

And a big fat Congrats to the new boss of the
Daily, Nada Skidmore. If you don't mind hav
ing a nervous breakdown, going minus about
40 and sleeping and eating in the Shack, I'm
sure you'll like the job. Luck, good wishes,
God bless you, and make that deadline!!!
For the greatest cheese-cake show of all
time, buzz by Lathrop House one of these not
so-sunny afternoons. Last Saturday the show
began soon after lunch and continued until
cocktail time. It all took place on the second
story front porch where about six comely Lath
! rop dwellers were sunning themselves. I looked
1 for the sun, but it seemed to be hidden behind
the trees. Then yesterday a young lady ap
peared, dried her wet hair, brushed it and put it
' up in curlers in full view of those passing down
the Row for their one o'clocks. As I said, quite
a show. And I can hardly wait until tomorrow's
matinee. I hope it's a double bill!!
