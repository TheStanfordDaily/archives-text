### ELLIOT EPSTEEN STALIN'S NEW GREAT PROBLEM 
At last many Russians have seen tha outside
world. This is significant. It might be deter
mined, for good or for evil, in the history of the
next few years. Indeed, this fact is adding much
to the turbulence of present international rela
tions.
Stalin has starved his nation for a long time.
His top-heavy bureaucracy has been fantas
tically inefficient. He had twice as long as Hit
ler had to prepare for war. He had many times
the resources, and he could, and did, starve
his people in the name of armaments to a
greater extent than the Nazi fuehrer ever
dreamed of doing.
Yet the Red Army was saved from collapsing
by lend lease. What a testimonial on the five
year plans.
RED ISOLATION
Still, Stalin controlled the organs of opinion
in his country. He prevented the importation
of truthful foreign news. Few people ever got
out of Russia, and they were high officials in
his regime.
He could progressively lower wages either
directly, or by increasing prices. He could pay
his workers about two dollars a week in terms
of American buying power. He could live on
Volga sturgeon while the proletariat ate bad
soup.
He could do all this safely because he could
tell everybody, "Things are much worse in the
capitalistic states, comrades." There were not
many people alive to say that living conditions
were better under the Tsars, and if they opened
their mouths, they joined the ten million in Si
berian concentration camps.
PRODUCTION NEEDED
But then Ivan the worker got drafted. He
fought his way into the capitalistic countries,
and saw, to his amazement, that the men whom
he had always thought were exploited were
living better than he was. When Ivan goes
home, he probably will not want five-year
plans, or ten-year plans, or even what lie has
been promised, a fifteen-year plan. If he is hu
man, he will demand a higher standard of
living.
But this means more goods, and more goods
mean industrial expansion. That in turn re
quires more cement, steel, and, most of all, ma
chine tools. Inefficient management and long
war years have been hard on Soviet fixed capi
tal. To produce washing machines, radios, and
cars for the masses will require much more
than Stalin controls now, and it will have to be
imported.
Stalin's new fight is thus for a great export
trade, in order to finance imports. He made
such an effort before, during the first five-year
plan. He has advantages in his battle for credit
this time, and disadvantages. His fate hangs on
the result.
