# Farm Idea Used in War

The klystron, which was used
during the war in radar receiving
sets, .will now be turned to the
peacelim .â–  use of investigating nat
ural phenomena, according to Pro
lessor W. W. Hansen of the Physics
Department.
'1 he original klystron was de
veloped before the war at Stan
ford, starting from ideas of Itus
sell Varian, a former Stanford
student. During the war the gov
ernment took it over.
Mr. Hansen explained the klys
tron as a gadget used to make and
receive very short radio waves. In
an ordinary vacuum tube which
runs at a low frequency there is a
stream of electrons which can be
tin ned on and off by a control grid.
The control grid is used to give a
series of pulses, usually one for
every oscillation.
At high frequency the control
grid does not work. The klys
tron achieves the same effect
without the use of a control grid.
This is done by slowing down part
of the electrons and speeding up
the rest. The fast electrons catch
up wjth the slow electrons, leav
ing gaps in the stream of elec
trons.
Stanford physicists are now meas
uring the velocity of light with the
aid of the klystron.
Although there are few workers
on the klystron now at Stanford, the
number is rapidly increasing with
Ihe return of more graduate stu
dents from the armed forces.
