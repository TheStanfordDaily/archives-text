# Errol Flynn Flays Hero In Hollywood Style Western
## 
### 
SAN ANTONIO—Now playing at the Stanford Theatre.
Warner Brothers' "San Antonio" represents the last stage in the degen
eration of the Western. The Stage is now reached in which the Hollywood
influence ean be felt in every line and gesture of a supposedly raw-boned
story. Gone are the days of the lusty bar-room brawls, here is an era of

+• moonlight petting on the balcony and
sophisticated singing in the former
barroom (now turned into a gin mil!
with a $2 cover charge.)
Errol Flynn is top man in "San
Antonio" and is seen as a pseudo-

renegade who is
the enemy of San
Antonio's crooked
bosses, Paul Kelly
and Victor Fran
cen. Why Errol
can't get along
with these t wo
gents was never
fully revealed so
all we could do
was to duck be
hind the nearest

covered wagon with the rest of the
cast when the three meet. But be
fore many blanks can be fired one
J Alexis Smith drags her body into
| town and announces that she's go
l ing to sing at the town's hottest cab
j aret, the Bella Union, which is
S owned fcy Messieurs Kelly and Fran
| cen. From here on in the story is a
' sticky mess that belongs in True
i Confessions.
When the action finally does ar
-1 rive, it's not very hard to tell that
the walls are of plywood and the
! chairs of cardboard. And the stunt
men must be ex-opera performers,
judging by their wild gesticulations
| as they fall from the chandelier.
San Antonio's highlight is prob
ably Alexis Smith's rendition of
I "Some Sunday Morning." a popular
I song in case you didn't know. Poor
I Mr. Flynn acts throughout as if he
were suffering from an acute hang
i over, his extra-curricular activities.
! however, not being of our concern.
Victor Francen as the polished crook
is the picture's only real asset.
The second feature, "A Girl, a
Guy and a Pal." is an obnoxious lit
tle thing about two people register-
J ing as man and wife who really
I aren't, their experiences on a Pull
man sleeper, and all sorts of smutty
i stuff' like that there. O.K. if you
olan to live on Mission tSreet.—Dick
i Bower.
