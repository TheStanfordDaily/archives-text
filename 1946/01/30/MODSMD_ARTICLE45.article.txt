So California has finally decided
who they're going to let run their
football team. Frank Wickhorst,
who did the collegiate stint at An
napolis, besides playing All-Ameri
can football, was appointed to the
head job at "U. of C."—Berkeley
extension.
It always is most amusing when
ever a college goes through the
paces of hiring a new football coach.
About everybody in the nation is
listed as a possible candidate, with
the exception of the outgoing coach,
whose reason for departing was his
inability to turn out a champion
ship team. Since every team can't
be a winning team, there is a con
stant turnover of coaches through
out ihe country.
Strange Happenings
Cal's recent episode in the foot
ball hiring business was no excep
tion. The number of men who at
various times were listed as "in"
for the job is longer than draft eli
gibles on the campus. It wouldn't
have surprised many if the volley
ball coach at Willows High had
gotten the job. More sober minds,
however, got the choice of selec
tions down to Charlie Erb, famed
quarterback on the Golden Bear
team in the bathtub gin era of the
'20's, and the man appointed to the
job, Frank Wickhorst.
Influential alumni aligned sides
on the issue, setting up barricades
and firing at each other on oppor
tune occasions. But apparently
Wickhorst's side had the most am
munition. His friends pointed at
the good record he made serving
Stub Allison, and besides that, in
nuendos were probably thrown at
Erb for "playboy tactics" of his in
earlier days.
To this writer, it doesn't make
much difference whom Cal ap
pointed their head grid man, for it
is mainly the policy of the school
that matters. Cal can embark on
the road to good football teams
without in any way infringing on

| their athletic standards. And that is
j the point they fail to understand,
i Good athletic teams don't neces
; sarily mean rotten politics. There
j are too many exceptions to that
rule. Alter all. we want some good
competition in the Big Game next
J year, don't we?
S Other Coaches
Other coaching jobs in the Pacific
Conference are all set. At Stanford
Marchie Schwartz, All - American
1 gridcler at Notre Dame, will do the
head coaching. Down at the two
Los Angeles college mills, Jeff Cra
vath and Bert Laßrucherie return
l next fall to turn out football teams,
Cravath at U.S.C., and Laßrucherie
at U. of C., Los Angeles extension,
j Cravath's job was in some doubt
last season with the mediocre team
! that he was turning out,' but he
finally landed in the Rose Bowl,
| sure insurance to a contract re
j lewai.
At the Oregon schools Lon Stiner
and Tex Oliver seem to be "in" for
next season. Oliver at the Univer
sity of Oregon took a terrific drub
bing from certain circles for his at
titude, which was termed cold, to
j the team. But no one could deny
his football coaching virtues, so he's
getting set for another season with
Jake Leicht, who'd make anybody's
team in the nation. Stiner has been
at Oregon State —a la Corvallis—for
| a long time, and probably will stay
there for a long time to come.
At the University of Washington
Pest Welch will stay on, despite
! many stories to the contrary. One
report even had Jock Sutherland
i migrating from his pro coaching job
i out to Seattle, but apparently Jock
was too content with his present
job.
Over at Pullman, which Washing
ton State calls its home, Phil Sorboe
recently signed a new contract for
i several more years. His last year's
outfit was the surprise team of the
year, and came within a shade of
! trekking to the Rose Bowl. . . .
