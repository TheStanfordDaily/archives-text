Hideki Tojo and other major war
criminals are being delayed pending
ihe Supreme Court decision in the

Press that the success or failure of
the Japanese trials hinges on the
Supreme Court rulings, since the
decision may have an important
bearing on the kinds of evidence
that can be used.
Technically, the Japan trials will
be international in nature, but Al
lied officials would be reluctant to
adopt a procedure that had been
publicly condemned by the Su
preme Court of the United States.
In this connection, the source said,
the Allies here are afraid the Su
preme Court might take a stand
against the admission of affidavits
and signed statements. Much of the

prosecution evidence in the Japan
trials is expected to be of this na
ture.
This has been the case with vari
ous minor trials already under way
