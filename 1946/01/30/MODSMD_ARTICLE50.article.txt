# 'Hank' Leads Cage Squad To Laurels
## 
### PHIL STEINMETZ 
Running through 24 games with
only two defeats, the Stanford var
sity of 1938 won their third straight
conference title. Again it was Hank
Luisetti who led the Farm team to
new records.
After starting off the season with
easy wins over San Jose State and
the Olympic Club, the Indians went
East for the second straight year.
They defeated Arizona 44-28 in the
first game of the trip and then trav
eled to New York for two games in
Madison Square Garden. City Col
lege of New York was defeated in
the first of these games, 45-42, and
Long Island University, 49-35, in
ihe second.
Stanford then went over to
Philadelphia only to lose to Tem
ple, 3.5-31, Then they went to
Cleveland where they swamped
Duqucsne to the tune of 92-27.
The Indians led 24-0 after the first
ten minutes of play. Luisetti set
a new national intercollegiate rec
ord in this game as he made 24
field goals and four free throws
for a grand total of 50 points. In
between conference games the
Cards edged out St. Mary's 42-32.
U.S.F. 51-32, and Santa Clara 56-
55.
Entering the conference race as
overwhelming favorites, Stanford
split their opening series with U.S.C.
The Indians won the first game 64-
54. as Luisetti scored 28 points, but
lost the second in a hard - fought
tussle, 4£-48. Hank scored 13 points
in the latter game.
Next came the Bears for a single
game at Berkeley. The Indian title
hopes dimmed as the Bears won, 47-
44. This left the Big Red down in
third place with only one win in
three games, while Cal was unde
eated.
Stanford then moved to L.A. to
play the hapless Bruins. The In
dians won easily, 69-33 and 56-29,
but still were two games behind
California. In the first game the
36-point margin of victory was a
new conference record. Luisetti
scored 48 points for the two-game
series.
Playing in the Pavilion the Cardi
nals got revenge on the Golden
Bears, 62 - 33. Luisetti scored 28
points for the second straight game.
Down in Los Angeles again the
Indians took two games from the
Trojans. The first game was 36-30,
and the second 48-35. Center Art
Sto?fen was high man in the first
game with 15 markers, but Hank
was back in form on Saturday night
with 21 points.
The Bears returned to the Farm
the next Friday, and left without
their top spot. The Indians scalped
California 41-39, to move into a
tie for first place. Luisetti was
aagin high point man for the game
with 13 points.
The Bruins then came north and
took two more on the chin. This
time the scores were 53-31 and 50-
33. Luisetti scored 38 points for
the series to break his own South
ern Division record of 208 points a
season by two. He was also only
four short of the national record.
The same nights California could
get no better than an even break in
their series with U.S.C., so Stanford
held the league lead by one game.
Then came the grande finale
with Cal at Berkeley. Luisetti's 22
points were instrumental in the
Farm's 63-42 victory. This set the
division record at 232 points, and
broke the national record for the
Stanford captain.
The University of Oregon, winner
of the Northern Division, came
south for the playoff. Stanford won
the first game in the San Francisco
Civic Auditorium, 52-39. and also
the second game, played in the Pa
vilion. 59-51. Again Luisetti was top
scorer with 48 points for the two
games. *
This marked the end of the Stan
ford Golden Era of basketball. An
gelo "Hank" Luisetti had brought
the Indians out of the dust and put
them on the top rung of the national
hoop picture. He scored 1596 points
in his four years at Stanford, break
ing the old national intercollegiate
four-year record by 65 points.

Running through 24 games with
only two defeats, the Stanford var

lost the second in a hard - fought
tussle, 4£-48. Hank scored 13 points

hopes dimmed as the Bears won, 47-
44. This left the Big Red down in
third place with only one win in
three games, while Cal was unde
eated.
Stanford then moved to L.A. to
play the hapless Bruins. The In
dians won easily, 69-33 and 56-29,

33. Luisetti scored 38 points for
the series to break his own South
ern Division record of 208 points a
season by two. He was also only
four short of the national record.
The same nights California could
get no better than an even break in
their series with U.S.C., so Stanford
held the league lead by one game.
Then came the grande finale
with Cal at Berkeley. Luisetti's 22
points were instrumental in the
Farm's 63-42 victory. This set the
division record at 232 points, and
broke the national record for the
Stanford captain.
The University of Oregon, winner

ten minutes of play. Luisetti set

overwhelming favorites, Stanford
split their opening series with U.S.C.

tussle, 4£-48. Hank scored 13 points

Next came the Bears for a single
game at Berkeley. The Indian title
hopes dimmed as the Bears won, 47-
44. This left the Big Red down in
third place with only one win in
three games, while Cal was unde
eated.
Stanford then moved to L.A. to
play the hapless Bruins. The In
dians won easily, 69-33 and 56-29,
but still were two games behind
California. In the first game the
36-point margin of victory was a
new conference record. Luisetti
scored 48 points for the two-game
series.

their top spot. The Indians scalped
California 41-39, to move into a
tie for first place. Luisetti was
aagin high point man for the game
with 13 points.
The Bruins then came north and
took two more on the chin. This
time the scores were 53-31 and 50-
33. Luisetti scored 38 points for
the series to break his own South
ern Division record of 208 points a
season by two. He was also only
four short of the national record.
The same nights California could
get no better than an even break in
their series with U.S.C., so Stanford
held the league lead by one game.
Then came the grande finale
with Cal at Berkeley. Luisetti's 22
points were instrumental in the
Farm's 63-42 victory. This set the
division record at 232 points, and
broke the national record for the
Stanford captain.
