LONDON. Jan. 29 (UP). —Nor-
wegian Foreign Minister Trygve Lie
was unanimously nominated Secre
tary General of the United Nations
by the Security Council today.
The 50-year-old Lie (pronounced
Lee) was proposed by U.S. chief
delegate Edward R. Stettinius at a
30-minute closed session of the 11-
nation Council. He received the
Council's unanimous vote.
Security Council President N. J.
O. Makin of Australia immediately
sought to reach Lie, who had gone
to Oslo for a week-end and was not
scheduled to return here until to
morrow, to find out if he would ac
cept. It was assumed that h» would.
Lie's nomination must still be ac
cepted by the 51-nation General
Assembly, but it was a foregone
conclusion it will adhere to the Big
Five compromise on Lie which led
to the unanimous action of the
Council.
