# Indians To Meet Naval Hoopsters
## 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
Stanford's hoop men take to the
court tonight for the first of three
encounters with independent teams
this week. tangling with the Del
Monte Naval Training School at the
Pavilion at 3.
The remainder of this week's
schedule gives the Cards a welcome
respite from the whipsaw compe
tition of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence Southern Division squads. Fri
day night the Injuns tee off on the
College of the Pacific and play the
University of San Francisco Sat
urday night.
Guessing Game
Concerning the tussle tonight
with the Del Monte troupe, not
much is known about it; neverthe
less, they do have a team, but how
good a combine they are remains to
be teen.
For all that is known of them,
they might be a bunch of world
beaters, but it is unlikely, for if they
were, word of their prowess would
have leaked out by now.
Not even their starting lineup is
known, although a team roster was
sent to B.A.C. Publicity Director
Don Liebendorfer. It contained the
players' names (last) and initials
(first and middle), positions, pre
vious experience and numbers
(which we neglected to copy—hence
all of the visitors on the court to
night will be known as "Joe").
Some Experienced
In the matter of experienced men,
most are of the high school variety,
although there is a scattering of col
legians in their ranks. These are
forwards C. F. Chappel of the
Washington frosh and L. F. Stern
berg of Wilson (Chicago) J.C, and
guards K. Kirstan of lowa State. E.
Koehler of C.0.P., and M. "Pappa"
Brooks of the U. of Cincinnati.
Then there are forwards R. E.
Land (Okla. City H.S.), D. W. Do
bler (Lamar, Colo., H.S.), R. D.
Witty (Toledo Waite H.S.), and H.
Hausknecht (Bingham, Utah, H.S.).
The remaining guards are J. R. Lan
derholm (Portland, Berkeley H.S.),

J. G. Sternziner (Little Falls, N.Y,
H.S.), und D. Billington (Hill Prep.,
Penn.). Centers are W. N. Patter
son (N. Phoenix H.S.) and L. A.
Ward (E. Rockfyrd, 111, U.S.).
The team in coached by Lt. (j.g.)
C. U. Fowler.
Victory in Store?
The lineup for the Stanfords will
have Tom Hood and Gene Martin
at forwards, Bill Christiansen and
Tom Rodman at guards, and either
Tom Murphy or Bill O'Brien at cen
ter.
Now, while it is impossible to
gauge the effectiveness of the in
vading squad, a victory for the
Farm is imminent; one could even
say overdue. And a victory to
night will put Coach Everett Dean's
lads in fine fettle for the week-end
clashes with two squads who are
by no means as invulnerable as
they would like their supporters to
Deiieve.

For all that is known of them,
they might be a bunch of world
beaters, but it is unlikely, for if they
were, word of their prowess would
have leaked out by now.
Not even their starting lineup is
known, although a team roster was
sent to B.A.C. Publicity Director
Don Liebendorfer. It contained the
players' names (last) and initials
(first and middle), positions, pre
vious experience and numbers
(which we neglected to copy—hence
all of the visitors on the court to
night will be known as "Joe").
Some Experienced
In the matter of experienced men,
most are of the high school variety,
although there is a scattering of col
legians in their ranks. These are
forwards C. F. Chappel of the
Washington frosh and L. F. Stern
berg of Wilson (Chicago) J.C, and
guards K. Kirstan of lowa State. E.
Koehler of C.0.P., and M. "Pappa"
Brooks of the U. of Cincinnati.
Then there are forwards R. E.
Land (Okla. City H.S.), D. W. Do
bler (Lamar, Colo., H.S.), R. D.
Witty (Toledo Waite H.S.), and H.
Hausknecht (Bingham, Utah, H.S.).
The remaining guards are J. R. Lan
derholm (Portland, Berkeley H.S.),

J. G. Sternziner (Little Falls, N.Y,
H.S.), und D. Billington (Hill Prep.,
Penn.). Centers are W. N. Patter
son (N. Phoenix H.S.) and L. A.
Ward (E. Rockfyrd, 111, U.S.).
The team in coached by Lt. (j.g.)
C. U. Fowler.
Victory in Store?
The lineup for the Stanfords will
have Tom Hood and Gene Martin
at forwards, Bill Christiansen and
Tom Rodman at guards, and either
Tom Murphy or Bill O'Brien at cen
ter.
Now, while it is impossible to
gauge the effectiveness of the in
vading squad, a victory for the
Farm is imminent; one could even
say overdue. And a victory to
night will put Coach Everett Dean's
lads in fine fettle for the week-end
clashes with two squads who are
by no means as invulnerable as
they would like their supporters to
Deiieve.
Stanford's hoop men take to the
court tonight for the first of three
encounters with independent teams
this week. tangling with the Del
Monte Naval Training School at the
Pavilion at 3.
The remainder of this week's
schedule gives the Cards a welcome
respite from the whipsaw compe
tition of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence Southern Division squads. Fri
day night the Injuns tee off on the
College of the Pacific and play the
University of San Francisco Sat
urday night.
Guessing Game
Concerning the tussle tonight
with the Del Monte troupe, not
much is known about it; neverthe
less, they do have a team, but how
good a combine they are remains to
be teen.
