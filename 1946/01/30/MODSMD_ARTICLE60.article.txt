# Stanford Flayers Bring Best in Drama to Farm
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
"The Stanford Players Present"
is a familiar phrase to every Stan
ford playgoer. Although these
words appear at the top of most
play programs, few have any idea
of just what the term "Stanford
Players" implies.
The Stanford Players is the pro
duction organization of the Speech
and Drama Department, open to
anyone on the campus, even those
not majoring in dramatics. It is,
however, a fictional group having
no definite body.
Although there was an organi
zation with the same name on
campus prior to 1940, the history
of the Stanford Players really be
gins in that year with a reorgani
zation of the group by Hubert
Ileffner, executive director. To
arouse student interest in plays,
which had been sadly lacking up

to that date. Hcflner ran a poll in
the Daily to determine what kind
of plays the students wished to
see produced.
The poll, however, turned out to
be unrepresentative of the Univer
sity, for it was known that drama
students influenced their friends to
vote for the plays in which they
j desired parts. As it turned out, no
â€¢ one was cast in the part he had
electioneered for, when "The War
rior's Husband" was given in the
winter quarter of 1940.
Since that time the teaching
j stall' has had to choose the plays,
but according to F. Cowles Strick
land, head of the acting and di
recting of the Players, the stalT
has always welcomed the idea of
forming a student branch.
In theory, any student who has
worked in any production is a mem
; ber. The cast parties following each
play are the only get-togethers en
j joyed by the actors and the produc
! lion staff. Strickland hopes that the
i time will come when anyone who
i has worked on a production of the
j Stanford Players will feel free to
join in a party every Saturday night
I a play is in production.
Since the Players aim to produce
| two shows a quarter, they try to
I vary the diet of plays as much as
possible. This season a Shakespear
ean comedy, "The Taming of the
| Shrew," to be given Thursday night,
j and"The Magic Flute," an opera
{ by Mozart, to be given in March,
: are indicative of the variety of
| types.
"The Taming of the Shrew" is
the third Shakespearean play to
be given since 1940. It has been
the Stanford Players' policy to
give one Shakespearean play ev
ery two years. "Richard II" and
"The Comedy of Errors" have
been presented during the last
four years. The Stanford Players
also hope to give an Ibsen or a
Chekhov drama every two years,
as illustrated by Chekhov's trag-
I cdy "The Sea Gull" given last
quarter. One different or experi
mental play is on the Stanford
Players' docket.
The Stanford Players try to pre-
I sent plays with real literary value,
! and to stay away from light farce
I comedy, although last quarter's
production of "Highland Fling" was
| in this vein. Strickland believes
I that the Players' chief claim to glory
is that Shakespeare has always been
j popular at Stanford. Stanford has
j tried to keep musical drama going,
1 and has presented "Of Thee I Sing"
and "Knickerbocker Holiday." "The
j Magic Flute" will be one of the
I Players' most serious undertakings.
At times the Stanford Players
j have employed professional actors
l and actresses to insure competent

performances and because it is one
J of the finest ways of teaching drama
students.
During' August of last year Mary
Morris, Richard Hale, and Linda
Walkins were brought to Stanford
to star in "The Skin of Our Teeth"'
by Thornton Wilder. Alline Mc-
Mahon, known for her motion pic-
I ture work, and Robert Duke, now
j in the New York production of
' ''Winter's Tales," were also "art
ists in residence" during the sum
mer.
Guest players were used in last
I year's production of the opera, "The
Merry Wives of Windsor," and for
| "The Magic Flute," Lois Hartzell
I and Joseph. Tissier, professional
j singers, will play difficult roles,
i These guest stars are usually from
the Bay Area, but have had more
training and experience than any
undergraduate student. Both for
| sake of the audience and for the
student players each play should be
done with distinction, even if this
| entails the hiring of professional
! players, according to Strickland.
The students usually absorb the
perfection of these artists and the
quality of succeeding plays stays
up. Strickland says that the guest
stars of the Stanford Players serve
as a "shot in the arm" to the whole
company.
