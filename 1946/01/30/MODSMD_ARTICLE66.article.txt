# High Priest Visits Farm
## 
### SPECIAL REQUEST 
A letter received yesterday by a
Farm freshman tells of the impend
ing arrival to Stanford of the High
Priest of Drofnats. Drofnats is a
small semi-civilized nation nestled
in the Himalayas between Tibet and
India,
Many exploring parties have ven
tured into this wilderness only to be
beaten back by the savage natives.
The religion of these peoples dom
inates them entirely. It is said that
the inhabitants of the country are
completely comprised of men, and
so great is their hate for the female
of the spccies that they reproduce
asexually.
Since birth the High Priest has
not spoken to anyone outside of his
closest followers, but now he has
confided in his most loyal associates
his desire to come to America to
preach his gospel.
The journey for this high priest
will be an ordeal in no mean sense
of the word. The first 1,846 miles
will undoubtedly be made on a
mountain goat, and the crossing of
the Pacific will be made on a spe
cially consrtucted paddle board.
