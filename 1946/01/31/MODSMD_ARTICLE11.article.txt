With the expressed hope that
Stanford's ties with national and
world-wide student affairs would
be strengthened, Excom last night

approved a mo- j
tion that the
A. S. S. U. rejoin
the National !
Student Federa
tion of America
which is reor
ganizing after its
inactivity during
the war.
The Stanford i
student body be- j
longed to the j
until 1943, and !
in 1942 was host. '
to a Bay Area -

[ representatives to the national con
j ferences which serve to promote the
[ exchange of student opinion, pro
| vid"? special facilities for travel
j abroad, and encourage exchange
scholarships. A convention for re
organization purposes will probably
be held in June. The A.S.S.U. will
