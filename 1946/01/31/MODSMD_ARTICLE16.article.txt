In his own words, Maxim Scha
piro, Russian-born concert pianist,
"marched through the history of tho
concerto" when he spoke and played
to an audience that filled both living
rooms and the hall at Storey House
for the first open meeting of the
Stanford Symphony Forum last
night.
Although slated to speak on
"The Evolution of the Concerto,"
Mr. Schapiro delighted his audi
ence by spending a good three
quarters of his time playing
lengthy selections from the con
certos which illustrated his talk.
Beginning concerto history with
Bach and 18th century concerto
style, Mr. Schapiro told of the popu
larity of the polyphonic .style in or
chestral and piano arrangements.
Bach, who first introduced tho piano
concerto, utilized polyphonic ar
rangements to the fullest in his com
positions. In his concertos, the piano
has equal place with the orchestra,
and "carries on a sort of dialogue
with the various instruments in the
orchestra."
With his piano accompanist. Miss
Shirley Jones who played orches
tral backgrounds for the various
selections. Mr. Schapiro demon
strated this style with "fragments"
from the first and second move
ments of Bach's "Concerto in D
Minor."
"With the development of me
lodic form, the style of the concerto
changed," Mr. Schapiro continued.
"Composers and pianists wanted a
display of virtuosity in piano con
certs, and the piano became a prima
donna."
Mozart was the first to intro
duce virtuoso display in his con
certs, and this was illustrated by
the playing of part of the first
of Mozart's "Piano Con
certo in E flat Major.*
Two characteristics mark this
trend in concerto development, Mr.
Schapiro said. First ,a big orchestral
introduction, and second, the caden
za. Here, the solo instrument plays
without orchestral accompaniment.
"This is a moment of virtuoso
possibilities. After all," Mr. Scha
piro grinned, "cadenza means 'do
what you like.'"
Beethoven was the first to "cur
tail the piano's all-superior air,"
said Mr. Schapiro, when, in his
fourth concerto, he introduced the
beginning of the symphony. The
piano became integrated into part
of the orchestra, and in the second
movement of the fourth, it is equal
ly important with the orchestra.
Concerto development followed
a symphonic pattern in Schu
mann. Chopin, and Brahms, the
second being the first to achieve
complete integration of piano and
orchestral sonorities.
Mr. Schapiro closed his discus
sion of concerto evolution with se
lections from Russian composers
Rachmaninoff (beginning of the
second concerto) and Tchaikowsky
(first movement of the "Concerto
in B Flat Minor).—Shelton

"With the development of me
lodic form, the style of the concerto
changed," Mr. Schapiro continued.
"Composers and pianists wanted a
display of virtuosity in piano con
certs, and the piano became a prima
donna."
Mozart was the first to intro
duce virtuoso display in his con
certs, and this was illustrated by
the playing of part of the first
of Mozart's "Piano Con
certo in E flat Major.*
Two characteristics mark this
trend in concerto development, Mr.
Schapiro said. First ,a big orchestral
introduction, and second, the caden
za. Here, the solo instrument plays
without orchestral accompaniment.
"This is a moment of virtuoso
possibilities. After all," Mr. Scha
piro grinned, "cadenza means 'do
what you like.'"
Beethoven was the first to "cur
tail the piano's all-superior air,"
said Mr. Schapiro, when, in his
fourth concerto, he introduced the
beginning of the symphony. The
piano became integrated into part
of the orchestra, and in the second
movement of the fourth, it is equal
ly important with the orchestra.
Concerto development followed
a symphonic pattern in Schu
mann. Chopin, and Brahms, the
second being the first to achieve
complete integration of piano and
orchestral sonorities.
Mr. Schapiro closed his discus
sion of concerto evolution with se
lections from Russian composers
Rachmaninoff (beginning of the
second concerto) and Tchaikowsky
(first movement of the "Concerto
in B Flat Minor).—Shelton
In his own words, Maxim Scha
piro, Russian-born concert pianist,
"marched through the history of tho
concerto" when he spoke and played
to an audience that filled both living
rooms and the hall at Storey House
for the first open meeting of the
Stanford Symphony Forum last
night.
Although slated to speak on
"The Evolution of the Concerto,"
Mr. Schapiro delighted his audi
ence by spending a good three
quarters of his time playing
lengthy selections from the con
certos which illustrated his talk.
Beginning concerto history with
Bach and 18th century concerto
style, Mr. Schapiro told of the popu
larity of the polyphonic .style in or
chestral and piano arrangements.
Bach, who first introduced tho piano
concerto, utilized polyphonic ar
rangements to the fullest in his com
positions. In his concertos, the piano
has equal place with the orchestra,
and "carries on a sort of dialogue
with the various instruments in the
orchestra."
With his piano accompanist. Miss
Shirley Jones who played orches
tral backgrounds for the various
selections. Mr. Schapiro demon
strated this style with "fragments"
from the first and second move
ments of Bach's "Concerto in D
Minor."
"With the development of me
lodic form, the style of the concerto
changed," Mr. Schapiro continued.
"Composers and pianists wanted a
