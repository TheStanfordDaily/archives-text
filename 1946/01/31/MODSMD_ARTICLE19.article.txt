### 
Agreeing (hat business and eco
nomics courses arc important in
college, hut that languages and
cultural ones also hold top places,
four alumnae last night talked on
the subject, "Is Business Life Your
Life?" at the second Vocom meet
ing of the quarter.
The four speakers each told' some
of the outstanding characteristics of
their jobs and a short panel dis
cussion followed.
Dr. David Faville of the Graduate
School of Business opened the pro
gram by stressing to his audience
the importance of women knowing
something about business now. For
merly, he explained, women went
only into the merchandising fields,
and even now the business of sell
ing is the third most important one
in ihc United States. Millinery and
farming top selling by a small mar
gin, he explained.
The first speaker, Miss Marga
ret Elliott, who was graduated in
1942, is now working with Inter
national Business Machines.
Miss Elliott explained the com
plicated business machines which
her company makes, distributes, and
services. Among other things, time
clocks arc manufactured by them,
which, .she told her audience, "you
will soon become familiar with."
Miss Elliott found her courses in
typing were of the most value to
her, although language and litera
ture courses made up the most of
her undergraduate study.
The second speaker was Miss
Ellen C'onaway, who received the
M.A. degree from here in 1944.
Her field is in cmplo.ver-lahor re
lations, with United Employers,
and she took most of her under
graduate and graduate work in
economics and labor, she said.
Miss Carolyn Kuhns, '44, works
with personnel in hiring and wage
problems and stressed that her work
is not "typical" personnel work, net
work lies with the hiring of non
academic workers at the University
of California.
Stressing that secretarial training
is important even after a college
degree, Miss Jane Herington, '41,
told of her secretarial work with the
State Department. Her advice was
to emphasize typing and bookkeep
ing courses as well as languages for
her work.
