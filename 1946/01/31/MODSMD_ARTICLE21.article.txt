# Curtain Will Rise Tonight On 'Taming of the Shrew'; Play to Run Three Days
## Use of Elizabethan Sets, Costumes Augmented by Bright Italian Scenes; Played with Shakespearean Touch 
###

which is a Stanford Players production, will be presented Friday and
Saturday nights also. The curtain will rise at 8:15.
"Taming of the Shrew" will be played with the original, broad Shake-

spearian comedy which includes ;i
' great many quick-moving scenes
i with farcical qualities. The story,
which deals with the way in which
to tame a woman, will be preceded
with the famed induction scene, in
which Christopher Sly, a tinker
played by John Menzel, is made to
believe he is a noble lord.
Clever Staging
Elizabethan staging will be used,

stage within a stage, so that action

"Taming of the Shrew," a Shakespearean comedy, will open tonight in
the Memorial Hall for the first night of a three-night run. The comedy,
which is a Stanford Players production, will be presented Friday and
Saturday nights also. The curtain will rise at 8:15.
"Taming of the Shrew" will be played with the original, broad Shake-

spearian comedy which includes ;i
' great many quick-moving scenes
i with farcical qualities. The story,
which deals with the way in which
to tame a woman, will be preceded
with the famed induction scene, in
which Christopher Sly, a tinker
played by John Menzel, is made to
believe he is a noble lord.
Clever Staging
Elizabethan staging will be used,
i which will have the added beauty
of five colorful backdrops depicting
j Italian scenes. A gay front curtain
has been devised which has been
j dyed to show an Italian scene. Ac
tion will go on before this curtain
as well as on the stage, and a clever
stage within a stage, so that action
can be continuous. Because orn'
I stage can be shut off, action will be
! continuous except, for two intermis
sions. Coloring in the scenery will
j be brilliant to harmonize with the
bright colors of the authentic Eliza
' bethan costumes and the gay mood
j of the comedy.
