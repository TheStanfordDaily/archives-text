# Russian Repercussion

### 
We should like to disagree with Elliott Ep
stec n's "History 1946" column.
We must disagree because we believe that
his r lumn both today's and yesterday's -
can c use far more harm than good.
Wo, like Epsteen, have no great admiration
for the Soviet government. But we know that
it ir gy to make sneering remarks (especially
false ones) about Russia, and we also know
thai liie-ie can be no hope lor world peace un
less the United States and Russia work to
gether.
A mutual slandering campaign is hardly con
ducive to cooperation.
Let us look at some of the most obvious fal
lacies. Epsteen maintains that Stalin had twice
as long as Hitler to prepare for war, that he had
many times the resources, and "yet the Red
army was saved from collapsing by lend lease."
Reference to any standard textbook of Rus
sian history would inform Epsteen that Russia
in ISI7 had about the same industrial develop
ment as Germany in 1880. By 1942 they were
nearly equal. Thus Russia moved 60 years in
25, a process that naturally could not occur with
the perfection Epsteen seems to demand.
Bridging a gap of 60 years is hardly proof
of the "fantastic" inefficiency of "top-heavy bu
reaucracy."
Let Epsteen remember that while we, too,
had (cr longer than Hitler to prepare' for war,
and were blessed with immensely greater nat
ural resources, we were caught with our pants
down, and have a war record that is not much
better than the Russian.
When Epsteen opines that only our lend
lease goods saved the Soviets, let him recall
Ihe nattle of turning point of
the war. The Russians won this crucial battle
without the benefits of lend lease.
We would also like to point out that Epsteen
can hardly speculate as to what the mythical
"Ivan" wants. So far, we have not the slightest
indication that "Ivan" is opposed to his gov
ernment's planning.
After eight paragraphs of anti-Soviet propa
ganda, Epsteen, by a logic all of his own,
reaches the conclusion that "Stalin's new fight
is thus for a great export trade, in order to
finance imports."
As Epsteen knows well, Russian industry is
so destroyed, that for years to come the So
viet s new fight" cannot concern exports and
imports, but must instead be a battle of re
building.
In today's column, Epsteen deplores Russian
power politics. We, too, have little sympathy
with it. But we believe that name-calling does
not lead to an adequate solution. No nation is
free of power politics, least of all we.
Destructive criticism and name-calling is
cheap. It merely requires a good vocabulary.
It destroys what little understanding there is
between nations; yet without a basis for com
mon understanding the peace for which we
fought so hard will be but another brief armi
stice.
After sacrificing millions of men— Ameri
cans, Russians, and many other nations'—the
v/orld has finally succeeded in building an or
ganization to which it looks to keep the peace.
But peace cannot be kept by organizations, it
can only be kept by men, men willing to work
together. Hostile propaganda is the first step
toward a bigger and better war.
