### ELLIOTT EPSTEEN 
STALIN'S NEW GREAT PROBLEM (contd.)
Stalin fought for foreign credit before, when
he was financing his first five-year plan. Then
he was selling to a market that was not glutted,
but much better supplied than the one he is fac
ing now.
Foreign capitalists knew he needed money,
so they paid such low prices for Russian pro
duce that the Soviet was accused of dumping.
INFLATION
But now the European market is caught in
inflation. Anything that can be sold will bring
a high price. This is Stalin's hope for the future.
Still, he can produce much less now than he
could then. The Soviet heavy industries still
can't compete with ours. Russian wheat has not
been spared by the famine that is sweeping all
of Europe, and that, formerly the basis of his
export, might now have to be imported.
Russian steel production is also in a mess.

The Germans flooded the Donets coal mines
so that many cannot be used for years. New
sources will take too much time for develop
ment. At present, Marshal Malinovsky is try
ing to organize Silesian coal production, but
even if he succeeds, the produce will have to
go to Russia over a deteriorated transport sys
tem.
STALIN'S SOLUTION
Stalin can sell anything he has, but his prob
lem is that he doesn't have much to sell. Thus
he is trying to get it from his neighbors.
In China, he has bargained for progressively
more of Manchuria's resources until now he
has practically half ownership. He has been
trying for years to establish a sphere of influ
ence over rich Sinkiang. Further west, it seems
that Stalin is not so much interested in what he
likes to call the "poor oppressed peasants of
Azerbaijan" than in the oil under their feet.
In Europe he has been stripping every coun
try he took over of everything that will produce
more.
NEW PROBLEM
But this idea of stealing goods and services
from one's neighbors has its bad side too. Ev
erybody else in the world becomes suspicious,
and a high standard of armament has to be
kept. Thus Stalin has to divert billions of ru
bles from washing machines and refrigerators
to radar research and atom bombs. The strain
is so great on the economy that either the
highly sensitive people have to be pressed too
far to slacken things, or more resources have to
be stolen, and the long road to war is begun.
Stalin today is in a mess. He needs money
and capital goods, and his way of getting them
might mean war.
The immediate picture for Russia in the fu
ture will probably be the shooting and disap
pearances of more leaders to prevent the dis
concerted veterans from having organizers,
and an aggressive foreign policy aimed at the
military capture of credit.
Perhaps we can stop it by buying out Stalin's
spheres of influence with cash and long-term
loans. But it would cost us a lot of money.
Still, if the recent news dispatches are any in
dicator, the situaton is on the road to becoming
desperate. >

ture will probably be the shooting and disap
pearances of more leaders to prevent the dis
concerted veterans from having organizers,
and an aggressive foreign policy aimed at the
military capture of credit.
Perhaps we can stop it by buying out Stalin's
spheres of influence with cash and long-term
loans. But it would cost us a lot of money.
Still, if the recent news dispatches are any in
dicator, the situaton is on the road to becoming
desperate. >
STALIN'S NEW GREAT PROBLEM (contd.)
Stalin fought for foreign credit before, when
he was financing his first five-year plan. Then
he was selling to a market that was not glutted,
but much better supplied than the one he is fac
ing now.
Foreign capitalists knew he needed money,
so they paid such low prices for Russian pro
duce that the Soviet was accused of dumping.
INFLATION
But now the European market is caught in
inflation. Anything that can be sold will bring
a high price. This is Stalin's hope for the future.
Still, he can produce much less now than he
could then. The Soviet heavy industries still
can't compete with ours. Russian wheat has not
been spared by the famine that is sweeping all
of Europe, and that, formerly the basis of his
export, might now have to be imported.
Russian steel production is also in a mess.

The Germans flooded the Donets coal mines
so that many cannot be used for years. New
sources will take too much time for develop
ment. At present, Marshal Malinovsky is try
ing to organize Silesian coal production, but
even if he succeeds, the produce will have to
go to Russia over a deteriorated transport sys
tem.
STALIN'S SOLUTION
Stalin can sell anything he has, but his prob
lem is that he doesn't have much to sell. Thus
he is trying to get it from his neighbors.
In China, he has bargained for progressively
more of Manchuria's resources until now he
has practically half ownership. He has been
trying for years to establish a sphere of influ
ence over rich Sinkiang. Further west, it seems
that Stalin is not so much interested in what he
likes to call the "poor oppressed peasants of
Azerbaijan" than in the oil under their feet.
In Europe he has been stripping every coun
try he took over of everything that will produce
more.
NEW PROBLEM
But this idea of stealing goods and services
from one's neighbors has its bad side too. Ev
erybody else in the world becomes suspicious,
and a high standard of armament has to be
kept. Thus Stalin has to divert billions of ru
bles from washing machines and refrigerators
to radar research and atom bombs. The strain
is so great on the economy that either the
highly sensitive people have to be pressed too
far to slacken things, or more resources have to
be stolen, and the long road to war is begun.
Stalin today is in a mess. He needs money
and capital goods, and his way of getting them
might mean war.
The immediate picture for Russia in the fu
ture will probably be the shooting and disap
pearances of more leaders to prevent the dis
concerted veterans from having organizers,
and an aggressive foreign policy aimed at the
military capture of credit.
Perhaps we can stop it by buying out Stalin's
