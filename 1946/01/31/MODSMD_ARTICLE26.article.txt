# Bull Session

### STANLEY WILSON 
One might say this is the kiss-off. It is the
end—my swan song. As the journalists say,
"It's 30."
Comes the end of volume 108 of the Penin
sula's Only Morning Newspaper, and also the"
end of my tour of duty as Bull Sessioner.
Accompanied with this end comes a feeling
of regret, coupled with a certain amount of
satisfaction. A person becomes attached to a
! column as much as he becomes attached to an
individual, a place, or a thing. This was my
baby for a guarter and a half. Now it will be
adopted by another writer for its further devel
opment.
For the next volume this will be H. D. Thor
eau's baby. I'm sure he will take fine care of it.
An old Daily and Stanford man, H.D. is well ac
guainted with life about the Farm and what
makes things tick in general. The development
of this offspring should go on in good style.
As for satisfaction, there has been much.
This column has attempted in some way to
produce some humor, some serious notes of
general interest, and some problems which
were thought necessary to bring to your atten
tion.
Not all has been presented to you. There has
1 been much left out. . . . Partly because of inade
guate time and space, and partly through dis
cretion. There is much to be said in any com
munity, but not all may be printed. We have
attempted to print the most pertinent and that
which would appeal to the most persons.
We suffered together through the reign of
Itchy, watched 8.0. Plenty turn from innocent
farmer to innocent gangster-accomplice.
We saw Stanford emerge from a wartime
school to a reconverting peacetime institution.
We also saw a multitude of our friends return
to Stanford after roaming over various portions
of the world in many types of uniforms. We
liked that sight. But we also disliked the fact
that many of them didn't like what they found
here upon their return. We tried to help them.
We will do more with their help in the future.
We saw Stanford field a football team and
j were glad. And we were glad the Farm's name
once more was linked in Pacific Coast inter
collegiate athletic circles.
Yes, plenty has happened. And this depart
ment is glad to have been on the reporting end
of some of it.
I could well thank many persons who have
contributed information for my column. I could
thank edit board, and of course, I could thank
you readers. But all that is guite evident, I be
lieve.
So for now I will place this column's copy
paper in the able typewriter of H.D. and wish
him well. And to all of you, good sailing, and
this is "30" from an appreciative ex-Bull Ses
sioner.

tion.
Not all has been presented to you. There has
1 been much left out. . . . Partly because of inade
guate time and space, and partly through dis
cretion. There is much to be said in any com
munity, but not all may be printed. We have
attempted to print the most pertinent and that
which would appeal to the most persons.
We suffered together through the reign of
Itchy, watched 8.0. Plenty turn from innocent
farmer to innocent gangster-accomplice.
We saw Stanford emerge from a wartime
school to a reconverting peacetime institution.
We also saw a multitude of our friends return
to Stanford after roaming over various portions
of the world in many types of uniforms. We
liked that sight. But we also disliked the fact
that many of them didn't like what they found
here upon their return. We tried to help them.
We will do more with their help in the future.
We saw Stanford field a football team and
j were glad. And we were glad the Farm's name
once more was linked in Pacific Coast inter
collegiate athletic circles.
Yes, plenty has happened. And this depart
ment is glad to have been on the reporting end
of some of it.
I could well thank many persons who have
contributed information for my column. I could
thank edit board, and of course, I could thank
you readers. But all that is guite evident, I be
lieve.
So for now I will place this column's copy
paper in the able typewriter of H.D. and wish
him well. And to all of you, good sailing, and
this is "30" from an appreciative ex-Bull Ses
sioner.
One might say this is the kiss-off. It is the
end—my swan song. As the journalists say,
"It's 30."
Comes the end of volume 108 of the Penin
sula's Only Morning Newspaper, and also the"
end of my tour of duty as Bull Sessioner.
Accompanied with this end comes a feeling
of regret, coupled with a certain amount of
satisfaction. A person becomes attached to a
! column as much as he becomes attached to an
individual, a place, or a thing. This was my
baby for a guarter and a half. Now it will be
adopted by another writer for its further devel
opment.
For the next volume this will be H. D. Thor
eau's baby. I'm sure he will take fine care of it.
An old Daily and Stanford man, H.D. is well ac
guainted with life about the Farm and what
makes things tick in general. The development
of this offspring should go on in good style.
As for satisfaction, there has been much.
This column has attempted in some way to
produce some humor, some serious notes of
general interest, and some problems which
were thought necessary to bring to your atten
tion.
