# Stanford Barber Traces Men's Tonsorial Needs
## 
### BARBARA LENDER 
Jim Pennington, owner of the
Stanford Barber Shop, has seen the !
roughs in the past few decades pass i
through quite a few hair fads, in
cluding (he long, "Hollywood" cut, |
the butch, and the now - popular
military style.
"Close over the cars, and me
dium-short on top — that's how
most of the boys want it now. I
guess they got used to it that way
in the service," said Mr. Penning
ton. "Been a big increase in bus
iness this quarter," he added, "es
pecially from the returning serv
icemen."
When Students Couldn't Smoke
Pennington has owned the Bar- :
ber Shop for 27 years, and in that
time has seen many changes on the
Farm. The Pavilion, the Stadium, j
Toyon, Branner, and the new Union
have all been built since ho came.
"I remember when women and
freshman men weren't allowed to
smoke in public," said Penning- '
ton. "And when each class had
to wear its own cap. These days j
you can't tell a freshman from a
senior."
The first Stanford Barber Shop
was located in Eneina. In 1917 the
shop was established about where
the cigar stand is now in the Cellar, j
Two years later it was taken over
by Pennington and moved to the
spot it now occupies in the Union. !
Not Many Shaves These Days
Pennington has two assistants in ;
the shop, Ben Fowler and Elbert
Reid, and could use some more. He
estimated that they take care of
from 10 to 15 haircuts a day.
"We don't have many shave cus
tomers," said Pennington. "Not
many of the boys shave very often, 1
and those that do, take care of it
themselves." According to Pen- j
nington, men aren't as particular j
about results as women. "They
know good work, and they like good
work," he said, "but they aren't as
fussy as girls."
Souvenirs of Old Stanford
The walls of the shop are lined 1
with scores of football games back j
to the 1919 battles. Arguments be- j
tween returned alumni about old |
game scores can be easily settled ,
by referring to the printed word on j
ihe wall.
A razor strop hangs in one cor- J
ner which has been in the shop [
since 1917, adorned with the signa- J
tures of many dear departed alum- :
ni. Among the signatures are those
of Bob Kenny, now state attorney |
general; Joe Murphy, who was Ne
vada state senator; and Oke Miller, |
who held the Stanford track rec
ord in 1919.
Whisker Marathon
On the subject of toupees, Pen

nington was emphatic. "They don't
fool anyone but the man who wears
them," he said He remembers only
ene customer who wore a toupee,
and he is now dead.
Pennington remembers the Whis
ker Marathon, which used to be
a Stanford tradition. Participants
were given three weeks to grow
their beards, and at th? end of that
time were judged on length, shape,
thickness, and aesthetic appearance.
The winner was awarded a cash
prize and a picture in Chappie.
"They haven't had the Marathon
for nearly 20 years now," mused
Pennington. "There've been a lot
of changes made."

When Students Couldn't Smoke
Pennington has owned the Bar- :
ber Shop for 27 years, and in that
time has seen many changes on the
Farm. The Pavilion, the Stadium, j
Toyon, Branner, and the new Union
have all been built since ho came.
"I remember when women and
freshman men weren't allowed to
smoke in public," said Penning- '
ton. "And when each class had
to wear its own cap. These days j
you can't tell a freshman from a
senior."
The first Stanford Barber Shop
was located in Eneina. In 1917 the
shop was established about where
the cigar stand is now in the Cellar, j
Two years later it was taken over
by Pennington and moved to the
spot it now occupies in the Union. !
Not Many Shaves These Days
Pennington has two assistants in ;
the shop, Ben Fowler and Elbert
Reid, and could use some more. He
estimated that they take care of
from 10 to 15 haircuts a day.
"We don't have many shave cus
tomers," said Pennington. "Not
many of the boys shave very often, 1
and those that do, take care of it
themselves." According to Pen- j
nington, men aren't as particular j
about results as women. "They
know good work, and they like good
work," he said, "but they aren't as
fussy as girls."
Souvenirs of Old Stanford
The walls of the shop are lined 1
with scores of football games back j
to the 1919 battles. Arguments be- j
tween returned alumni about old |
game scores can be easily settled ,
by referring to the printed word on j
ihe wall.
A razor strop hangs in one cor- J
ner which has been in the shop [
since 1917, adorned with the signa- J
tures of many dear departed alum- :
ni. Among the signatures are those
of Bob Kenny, now state attorney |
general; Joe Murphy, who was Ne
vada state senator; and Oke Miller, |
who held the Stanford track rec
ord in 1919.
Whisker Marathon
On the subject of toupees, Pen

nington was emphatic. "They don't
fool anyone but the man who wears
them," he said He remembers only
ene customer who wore a toupee,
and he is now dead.
Pennington remembers the Whis
ker Marathon, which used to be
a Stanford tradition. Participants
were given three weeks to grow
their beards, and at th? end of that
time were judged on length, shape,
thickness, and aesthetic appearance.
The winner was awarded a cash
prize and a picture in Chappie.
"They haven't had the Marathon
for nearly 20 years now," mused
Pennington. "There've been a lot
of changes made."
Jim Pennington, owner of the
Stanford Barber Shop, has seen the !
roughs in the past few decades pass i
through quite a few hair fads, in
cluding (he long, "Hollywood" cut, |
the butch, and the now - popular
military style.
"Close over the cars, and me
dium-short on top — that's how
most of the boys want it now. I
guess they got used to it that way
in the service," said Mr. Penning
ton. "Been a big increase in bus
iness this quarter," he added, "es
pecially from the returning serv
icemen."
