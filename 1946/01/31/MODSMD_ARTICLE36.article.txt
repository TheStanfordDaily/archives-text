Now that the new intramural ath
letic program is well under way
let's have a look at it. To date it
has showed a good degree of suc
cess. This success can be contrib
uted to the interest of those stu
dents participating in it, and to
the time and effort put into the
program by the Intramural Com
mittee.
Accomplishing End
From all reports, both of the
committee and students alike, the
program is a success, and looks like
it will continue to be one. It is ac
complishing what was wanted â€”
competitive athletics for those stu
dents who are unable to take part in
varsity competition.
Thirty-five teams signed for the
intramural basketball league which
is just about the capacity. In past
years there were about 60 teams
signed up in the league, but that is
just about impossible under the new
arrangements which call for games
to be played on the full court in
stead of the former cross - court
games.
Safety in Regulation Courts
The use of the regulation court,
which was requested by the stu
dents, has a great safety advantage
over the cross courts, besides mak
ing for a better game. In the past
when the short courts were used
there were quite a few injuries. In
the gym the courts were right next
to one another, and caused many a
head-on collision, as well as the
problem of basketballs rolling from
one court to the other. The out
side lines for the two end courts
were the walls, which was the cause
of many accidents. There were also
overhead beams hanging out over
the of the floor waiting to meet
the noggin of some tall player.
At this point some may be won
dering where all the teams in the
past came from. In those days ci
vilian men students occupied Toy
on, Branner, and Sequoia halls. To
day the women have Branner, the
navy Toyon, and Sequoia has the
dry :'ots.
When these halls are once again
occupied by their rightful owners
it isn't likely that it will be possible
to go back to the old 60 teams un
less there is a sacrifice of safety and
desirability, or unless more facili
ties are furnished, which isn't very
likely.
Rooters Needed
There is only one thing that is
lacking at the games. That is root
ers. The majority of games are ex
cellent to watch, and provide many
a thrill for the spectators, espe
cially for those gals who have a boy
friend or two*on the teams. And

don't think that just because a game
is being played in he Men's Gym
the fair sex can't attend, because by
all means they can.
The fact that a couple of the in
tramural teams are playing the
Stanford "B" team in preliminaries
to the varsity games shows that
these boys can play a good brand
of basketball.
