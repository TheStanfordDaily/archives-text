# Lighter Mat Men Needed
## 
### 
Wrestling last year attained offi
cial status as a minor sport. Be
that as it may, the interest in it is
strong. Coach Mumby started his
elimination tournament yesterday.
The boys who come out on top will
represent Stanford against all com
ers.
Like the boxing team, the wres
tlers are short of light men. The
Farm won't have anybody "grunt
ing and groaning" for it in either
the 121- or the 128-pound class.
This fact not withstanding, the team
will meet the Far West Amateur
Wrestling Campionship entries at
a later date.
According to Coach Mumby, there
aren't any Joe Savolds on the squad,
but our boys will hold their own
against the competition they'll'come
up against. Of course more definite
information will have to wait until
after the first real test, which the
boys will get in Oakland.
Big: Event Later
The other big event in the lives
of our bone-crushers is the Pacific
Coast Amateur Wrestling Campion
ship. This will take place at the
Olympic Club in San Francisco.
We will also meet the University
of California twice, once in Berke
ley and once on this campus. Defi
nite dates will be announced at a
later time when. complete arrange
ments have been concluded.
Coach Mumby will welcome any
late comers who are interested in
learning the sport, or even those
who have had some experience and
would like to sharpen up their tech
nique. He even claims that some of
the fellows who were in his ad
vanced class in '42 are back on the
campus but don't even know the
team is working out. Be it known
by all that these fellows are now
notified. As you can well imagine,
he would be particularly pleased if
a few feather-weights showed up.
Are You Overweight?
Some of the fellows who find
themselves in the embarrassing po
sition of being just a pound or two
over a certain weight class, there
fore having to llpul and tug against
athletes who outweigh them by as
much as ten pounds, are making an
interesting experiment. They have
begun a non-liquid diet. With a
little figuring they determine how
long it takes to lose an amount of
wrestle after going without liquid
for a given period.â€”Rotenburg
