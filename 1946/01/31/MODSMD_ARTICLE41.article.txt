## 
### PHIL STEINMETZ 
If the Stanford basketball team
played as well on weekend nights as
I they do on Wednesday nights, they
! might not be at the bottom of the
l division standings. Last night they
; won their second straight Wednes
j day night game when they defeated
a smooth looking Del Monte Navy
i team, 47-40.
For the first ten minutes of play
the score was very close, with first
one team and then the other taking

a narrow lead. At the twelve-min- j
ute mark Tom Murphy began hitting !
the basket, and the Indians boomed j
into a 20 to 12 lead. Three points by !
Don Dobler cut the score to the half- ,
time margin of 20-15.
Martin Sparks Team
In the second half the Sailors j
started fast and cut the score to j
three points, but Gene Martin got ;

hot and the Cards pulled away
again. At one time in the second
half Stanford had a twelve-point
margin at 44-32. The hard fighting
Navy boys came back to whittle the
count to six points, but that's as far
as they got.
Held to only two points in the
first half, the rugged Martin broke
loose to pot 11 in the second stanza.
He played his usual hard fighting
game, and aided Murphy greatly on
the backboard. He was a little bit
off on his free throws, however, as
he only made three of seven chances.
Murphy Looks Good
Murphy-played his best game of
the season, with the possible excep
tion of last Friday's game against
USC, as he score 12 points. Tom used
his height advantages over the short
er Sailors, as he controlled the back
board all through the game. He
scored seven points in the first half,
qnd added five in the second half for
his game total.
On the Del Monte side of the

scorebook, Dobler was far and away
the top scorer. He scored ten points
in the first half, and nine in the sec
ond half for nineteen points. He
was easily the best man on the floor
last night. Doebler's only previous
experience was with his high school
team in Lamar, Colorado. His shoot
ing was superb.
Hill Still Missing'
Captain Bill Christiansen played
his usual steady game, but found it
a little difficult to check Dobler. He
shot only three times all evening,
and made two of them. However, it
isn't his shooting but his floor work
that makes him such a valuable
player.
