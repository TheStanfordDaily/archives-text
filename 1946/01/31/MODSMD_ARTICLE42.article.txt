# Raqueteers Progressing
## 
### 
The tennis team is slowly, but
surely, working itself into trim. Ev
! ery afternoon the "racqueteers"
! meet on the clay courts behind the
gym and exchange lobs, backhands,
and overhead smashes.
The competition for the top
spots on the team is very close,
the reason being that there are no
returning lettermen out this sea
son. So far, the first four men in
the ladder are Arnold Biesser,
drover Miller, Dave Bashan. and
Boh Rutledge. However, these
standings are far from certain and
will probably change many times
before the season begins.
The P.C.C. schedule has not been
| arranged as yet, but will be an
i nouneed shortly. We will, of course,
meet U.C.L.A., U.S.C., and the U.
| of C.
J. D. Williams, the senior man
| ager, is at present contacting tennis
| clubs around the area in an effort
to schedule some practice matches
; for the Stanford players. The team
| would like to meet some of the
j smaller schools around about in
: order to sharpen their strokes for
j the big matches, which will begin
in the spring.
Last week, as has already been
1 reported, the Farm boys met the
Palo Alto Tennis Club, which is
mainly composed of old Stanford
varsity men. These court wise vet
! erans with their superior experi
ence whipped our fledglings, but
Coach Bugge was well pleased with
j the fight they made.
After such a fine showing so early
in the season they can be expected
to develop into a tough threat by
April.
The U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. teams
at this point seem to be the class
of the league as they've got some
of the best tennis men in the
country. Coach Bugge refused to
predict a victory over them but
on the other hand wouldn't con
cede them the victory. He is of
j the "You can never tell what will
happen" school of thought.
For further announcements of
j matches watch the sports page.
There are four practice meets this
I quarter that you will want to see
j if you're interested in good tennis.

standings are far from certain and
will probably change many times
before the season begins.
The P.C.C. schedule has not been
| arranged as yet, but will be an
i nouneed shortly. We will, of course,
meet U.C.L.A., U.S.C., and the U.
| of C.
J. D. Williams, the senior man
| ager, is at present contacting tennis
| clubs around the area in an effort
to schedule some practice matches
; for the Stanford players. The team
| would like to meet some of the
j smaller schools around about in
: order to sharpen their strokes for
j the big matches, which will begin
in the spring.
Last week, as has already been
1 reported, the Farm boys met the
Palo Alto Tennis Club, which is
mainly composed of old Stanford
varsity men. These court wise vet
! erans with their superior experi
ence whipped our fledglings, but
Coach Bugge was well pleased with
j the fight they made.
After such a fine showing so early
in the season they can be expected
to develop into a tough threat by
April.
The U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. teams
at this point seem to be the class
of the league as they've got some
of the best tennis men in the
country. Coach Bugge refused to
predict a victory over them but
on the other hand wouldn't con
cede them the victory. He is of
j the "You can never tell what will
happen" school of thought.
For further announcements of
j matches watch the sports page.
There are four practice meets this
I quarter that you will want to see
j if you're interested in good tennis.
