# Golf Course Hides Temple
## 
### Special Request 
While searching the hills near the
golf course for lost golf balls. I hap
pened to stumble on a cave, half
hidden among the foliage. My cu
riosity getting the better of me. I
wandered in to find myself in an
immense labyrinth of caverns and
archways.
Suddenly I heard a weird chant
ing emanating from somewhere
within. Three hours later I found
myself in a huge circular room
which was the source of the strange
noises. Sitting cross-legged on the
ground around a huge pedestal
were over a hundred men listening
reverently to the toga-clothed gure
seated on the pedestal.
It was Etah, the High Priest of
Drofnats, who had made a lightning
trip to our continent! Wait a min
ute! Did I say one hundred men?
There must have been five hundred
by now. They were reproducing by
binary fission!
Suddenly the 747 men rose as a
female goat was led in by another
placed on the sacrificial altar, and
its throat was cut from horn to
horn. A great cheer came from the
throats of the 983 men present,
"Seev-Lieb!"
I hastened to leave before my

whereabouts were discovered, and
as I was leaving I could hear a cry
echoing and reverberating against
the walls of the cavern. "Wait till
Friday! Wait till Friday!"
