## 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 30 (UP). —The United Nations Security Council, bowing
to an angry Russian demand, today referred the Soviet-Iranian disp'ute
back to the Iwo parties for direct negotiations and removed it from its
formal agenda.
Russia had rejected an Iranian offer of direct negotiations because it

♦ was conditioned on the understand
j ing that they would be conducted
1 under supervision of the council. By
I its action today the council did not
i prejudice its right to look into the
j negotiations as they progress.
Russia Objects
Soviet chief delegate Andrei Y. Vi
j shinski, pounding th table in object
ing to council supervision of nego
tiations, shouted:
"There is no reason for keeping
| this case on the council's agenda be
! cause we are not threatening war on
j Iran or vice versa."
Vishinki's statement followed a
; declaration of British Foreign Sec
| retary Ernest Bevin that Russian ac
j tions in Iran: "Look to us like . . .
| the beginning of an aggression."
Lie Secretary-General
| Trygve Lie, Norwegian foreign
minister, returned from Oslo today
j and announced his acceptance of the
' post of secretary-general of the
! UNO. His nomination is expected to
' come before the assembly on Fri
; day and overwhelming approval'was
j expected.
The dispute, the first brought be-
I fore the Security Council, was re
j moved from the agenda by a com
| promise resolution offered by Dutch
! Foreign Minister E. N. Van Klef
i fens.
As finally adopted, the resolution
! required the disputants to ''inform
| the council of any rcsnults achieved"
j and added that "the council mean
j while retains the right to request
j information on the progress of nego
j tiations."
Unanimous Vote
The resolution passed unanimous
i ly, Russia voting for it.
I The entii'e point at issue was the
insistence of Iranian delegate Seyed
Hassan Taquizadeh that the 11-na
tion Security Council retain the dis
| pute on its agenda while the direct
j negotiations were being carried on
i with Russia.
He was supported by Bevin and
i chief U. S. delegate Edward R. Stet
tinius as well as by the French, Chi
nese and Polish delegates.
Vishinski objected to the nego
; tiations being under UNO supervi
sion. It would be contrary to the
! dignity of the Soviet government to
so proceed," he said.
