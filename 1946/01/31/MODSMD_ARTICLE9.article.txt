# GM Demands New Contract
## 
### 
DETROIT, Jan. 30 (UP)).â€”Gen
eral Motors Corporation, refusing an
increase above its 13' j-ccnt-an-hour
offer to 175,000 striking employees,
indicated indirectly tonight that it
might be ready to hike the bid when
objectionable features of its old la
bor contract were removed.
Harry W. Anderson, GM vice
president, after the first, meeting
with top leaders of the CIO United
Auto Workers since Dec. 2(5, de
manded the removal of the mainte
nance of membership clause and
other provisions of the old agree
ment.
Union Objects
"We have nothing further to of
fer in the way of an increase until
the provisions of a new contract are
worked out," Anderson said.
R. J. Thomas, international presi
dent. of the UAW, immediately
branded Anderson's statement as an
act of bad faith in the renewal of
bargaining on the first day of the
UAW walkout. He asserted that the
strike would continue until the com
pany receded from its position.
Uninterrupted Production
"If the union wishes to order the
employees back to work on the ba
sis of an increase of 13 1 2 cents per
hour while such a contract is being
negotiated, that will be all right with
us," Anderson said.
He said a new contract should
give the corporation "assurance of
uninterrupted production efficient
work effort by each employee and
other provisions which we believe
will contrdibutc to better relations
between the union employees and
the management."
Anderson stated the company's po
sition after a two-hour meeting with
a union committee, headed by R. J.
Thomas, UAW president.
