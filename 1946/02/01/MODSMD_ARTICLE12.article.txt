# Marcuse 'Tames Shrew' in Excellent Performance While Barrett Gives Role New Interpretation
## 
### NONA THOMAS 
The Stanford Players last night
presented a colorful, enthusiastic,
well - directed, well - lighted, and
aptly cast performance of "The
Taming of the Shrew." Mr. Phil
brick, tho director, is to be congrat
ulated for clcver and interesting
stage business that gave the per
formance much of its exuberance
qnd reality.
Convincing Portrayal
Ted Marcuse played a lusty Pe
truchio, sustaining throughout the
play a part involving a difficult
combination of humor, vigor, and
control. His portrayal of Petruchio
convincingly depicted the character
as both earthy and sophisticated.
Pat Barrett, as Kate the Shrew,
played her part with increasing
control as the performance pro
gressed. In the first scene Kate was
shown as angry and resentful, in
variation from the interpretation of
the character as more spirited and
arrogant than angry. Miss Barrett's
performance of the reconciliation
scene in the last act was both subtle
and definite. She ably portrayed a
Kate who, with unbroken spirit, is
both amused and pleased to join her
husband in the game of confounding
and astounding the rest of the
world.
Double Part
Although her lines in the first act
are those of a convention - bound
young lady, Bianea, as played by
Jane Saulsberry, by her actions in
the first act gives premonitions of
her rebellion in the last act. Miss
Saulsberry shows simultaneously
ostensible obedience to Baptista and

subservience to Kate, and an inner
rebellion against the decorum she
displays.
Good Comedy
John Menzel as Christopher Sly,
Newton Arnold as Gt umio, Larry
Frankley as Biondello, and George
Eckstein the tailor incorporated
into the straight comic parts some

of the best and most gymnastically
difficult stage business in the per
formance. Mr. Mcnzel's Sly is an
amazingly loose-jointed and con
vincingly confused drunken victim
of a practical poke. His antics with

David Crabbe, the Page, enlivened
the short pauses between scene
changes. Mr. Frankley had his best
lines, his best action, and gave his
best performance in his active de
scription of Petruchio in the second
act, and Mr. Eckstein made much
of a small part in the second act.
Charles Garis as Tranio must play
a part on two levels, as for Ihe
most part he is a servant pretend
ing to be his master. Particularly
in his first entrance as Lucentio his
performance of the master has a
properly affected and overdone
quality, but his performance is best
when he is paired with Melvin El
let in the first scene. Mr. Ellet hero
and in the last act gives his finest
portrayal as well. He has a little
too much strength for the seven
teenth-century conventions of love
at first sight (on which much of his
action is based) to be believable,
but where his lines are strong
enough his performance is good,
and unlike a few of the other play
ers he possesses a strong voice and
enunciates well.
Feeling for Part
Duane Heath imparts dignity and
a sense of position to his perform
ance of Baptista, but neither is
his voice as well modulated as Mr.
El let's nor is his pronunciat ion as
clear, and these faults impair a
performance which shows good
feeling for the part.
Edward Marion presents a vary
ing performance of Gremio, who
wavers occasionally from senility to
vigor. His best scene is that in

which he bargains with Baptista for
the hand of Bianca.
Gordon Kennell as the Pedant
who substitutes for Lucentio's la
ther slightly ov-T-accenLuates voice
peculiarities in his first scgne though
his action here is good, and in his
second appearance his poses and
his voice equally substantiate his
performance. Once again Mr. Phil
brick's direction and the introduc
tion of lively action arc praisewor
thy. Particularly to the comic and
more typed characters the action
lends validity.
Single Set Excellent
An admirably adaptable single s?t
similar to the one used in Paul
Robeson's performance of ' Othello"
is used as background for the entire
production; yet the changes which
are rung on this single set are
integrated into the whole well
enough, and the variations striking,
so that the single basic set docs not
make the scene monotonous, nor
does it soem that the entire action
takes place in the same spot. The
sole exception to the general excel
lence of the adaptations of this one
background is in the outdoor scene,
one retains the impression
that the sceno is really an interior,
in part because the drapes are left
at the doors. However, the action in
this scene is so excellent that the
dcfect in the set is incidental and
docs not detract from it materially.

properly affected and overdone
quality, but his performance is best
when he is paired with Melvin El
let in the first scene. Mr. Ellet hero
and in the last act gives his finest
portrayal as well. He has a little
too much strength for the seven
teenth-century conventions of love
at first sight (on which much of his
action is based) to be believable,
but where his lines are strong
enough his performance is good,
and unlike a few of the other play
ers he possesses a strong voice and
enunciates well.
Feeling for Part
Duane Heath imparts dignity and
a sense of position to his perform
ance of Baptista, but neither is
his voice as well modulated as Mr.
El let's nor is his pronunciat ion as
clear, and these faults impair a
performance which shows good
feeling for the part.
Edward Marion presents a vary
ing performance of Gremio, who
wavers occasionally from senility to
vigor. His best scene is that in

which he bargains with Baptista for
the hand of Bianca.
Gordon Kennell as the Pedant
who substitutes for Lucentio's la
ther slightly ov-T-accenLuates voice
peculiarities in his first scgne though
his action here is good, and in his
second appearance his poses and
his voice equally substantiate his
performance. Once again Mr. Phil
brick's direction and the introduc
tion of lively action arc praisewor
thy. Particularly to the comic and
more typed characters the action
lends validity.
Single Set Excellent
An admirably adaptable single s?t
similar to the one used in Paul
Robeson's performance of ' Othello"
is used as background for the entire
production; yet the changes which
are rung on this single set are
integrated into the whole well
enough, and the variations striking,
so that the single basic set docs not
make the scene monotonous, nor
does it soem that the entire action
takes place in the same spot. The
sole exception to the general excel
lence of the adaptations of this one
background is in the outdoor scene,
one retains the impression
that the sceno is really an interior,
in part because the drapes are left
at the doors. However, the action in
this scene is so excellent that the
dcfect in the set is incidental and
docs not detract from it materially.


F. COWLES STRICKLAND, di
rector of "The 'laming of the
Shrew."
The Stanford Players last night
presented a colorful, enthusiastic,
well - directed, well - lighted, and
aptly cast performance of "The
Taming of the Shrew." Mr. Phil
brick, tho director, is to be congrat
ulated for clcver and interesting
stage business that gave the per
formance much of its exuberance
qnd reality.
Convincing Portrayal
Ted Marcuse played a lusty Pe
truchio, sustaining throughout the
play a part involving a difficult
combination of humor, vigor, and
control. His portrayal of Petruchio
convincingly depicted the character
as both earthy and sophisticated.
Pat Barrett, as Kate the Shrew,
played her part with increasing
control as the performance pro
gressed. In the first scene Kate was
shown as angry and resentful, in
variation from the interpretation of
the character as more spirited and
arrogant than angry. Miss Barrett's
performance of the reconciliation
scene in the last act was both subtle
and definite. She ably portrayed a
Kate who, with unbroken spirit, is
both amused and pleased to join her
husband in the game of confounding
and astounding the rest of the
world.
Double Part
Although her lines in the first act
are those of a convention - bound
young lady, Bianea, as played by
Jane Saulsberry, by her actions in
the first act gives premonitions of
her rebellion in the last act. Miss
Saulsberry shows simultaneously
ostensible obedience to Baptista and

subservience to Kate, and an inner
rebellion against the decorum she
displays.
Good Comedy
John Menzel as Christopher Sly,
Newton Arnold as Gt umio, Larry
Frankley as Biondello, and George
Eckstein the tailor incorporated
into the straight comic parts some

of the best and most gymnastically
difficult stage business in the per
formance. Mr. Mcnzel's Sly is an
amazingly loose-jointed and con
vincingly confused drunken victim
of a practical poke. His antics with

David Crabbe, the Page, enlivened
the short pauses between scene
changes. Mr. Frankley had his best
lines, his best action, and gave his
best performance in his active de
scription of Petruchio in the second
act, and Mr. Eckstein made much
of a small part in the second act.
Charles Garis as Tranio must play
a part on two levels, as for Ihe
most part he is a servant pretend
ing to be his master. Particularly
in his first entrance as Lucentio his
performance of the master has a
properly affected and overdone
quality, but his performance is best

Taming of the Shrew." Mr. Phil
brick, tho director, is to be congrat
ulated for clcver and interesting
stage business that gave the per
formance much of its exuberance
qnd reality.
Convincing Portrayal
Ted Marcuse played a lusty Pe
truchio, sustaining throughout the
play a part involving a difficult
combination of humor, vigor, and
control. His portrayal of Petruchio
convincingly depicted the character
as both earthy and sophisticated.
Pat Barrett, as Kate the Shrew,
played her part with increasing
control as the performance pro
gressed. In the first scene Kate was
shown as angry and resentful, in
variation from the interpretation of
the character as more spirited and
arrogant than angry. Miss Barrett's
performance of the reconciliation
scene in the last act was both subtle
and definite. She ably portrayed a
Kate who, with unbroken spirit, is
both amused and pleased to join her
husband in the game of confounding
and astounding the rest of the
world.
Double Part
Although her lines in the first act
are those of a convention - bound
young lady, Bianea, as played by
Jane Saulsberry, by her actions in
the first act gives premonitions of
her rebellion in the last act. Miss
Saulsberry shows simultaneously
ostensible obedience to Baptista and

subservience to Kate, and an inner
rebellion against the decorum she
displays.
Good Comedy
John Menzel as Christopher Sly,
Newton Arnold as Gt umio, Larry
Frankley as Biondello, and George
Eckstein the tailor incorporated
into the straight comic parts some

of the best and most gymnastically
difficult stage business in the per
formance. Mr. Mcnzel's Sly is an
amazingly loose-jointed and con
vincingly confused drunken victim
of a practical poke. His antics with

David Crabbe, the Page, enlivened
the short pauses between scene
changes. Mr. Frankley had his best
lines, his best action, and gave his
best performance in his active de
scription of Petruchio in the second
act, and Mr. Eckstein made much
of a small part in the second act.
Charles Garis as Tranio must play
a part on two levels, as for Ihe
most part he is a servant pretend
ing to be his master. Particularly
in his first entrance as Lucentio his
performance of the master has a
properly affected and overdone
quality, but his performance is best
when he is paired with Melvin El
let in the first scene. Mr. Ellet hero
and in the last act gives his finest
portrayal as well. He has a little
too much strength for the seven
teenth-century conventions of love
at first sight (on which much of his
action is based) to be believable,
but where his lines are strong
enough his performance is good,
and unlike a few of the other play
ers he possesses a strong voice and
enunciates well.
Feeling for Part
Duane Heath imparts dignity and
a sense of position to his perform
ance of Baptista, but neither is
his voice as well modulated as Mr.
El let's nor is his pronunciat ion as
clear, and these faults impair a
performance which shows good
feeling for the part.
Edward Marion presents a vary
ing performance of Gremio, who
wavers occasionally from senility to
vigor. His best scene is that in

which he bargains with Baptista for
the hand of Bianca.
Gordon Kennell as the Pedant
who substitutes for Lucentio's la
ther slightly ov-T-accenLuates voice
peculiarities in his first scgne though
his action here is good, and in his
second appearance his poses and
his voice equally substantiate his
performance. Once again Mr. Phil
brick's direction and the introduc
tion of lively action arc praisewor
thy. Particularly to the comic and
more typed characters the action
lends validity.
Single Set Excellent
An admirably adaptable single s?t
similar to the one used in Paul
Robeson's performance of ' Othello"
is used as background for the entire
production; yet the changes which
are rung on this single set are
integrated into the whole well
enough, and the variations striking,
so that the single basic set docs not
make the scene monotonous, nor
does it soem that the entire action
takes place in the same spot. The
sole exception to the general excel
lence of the adaptations of this one
background is in the outdoor scene,
one retains the impression
that the sceno is really an interior,
in part because the drapes are left
at the doors. However, the action in
this scene is so excellent that the
dcfect in the set is incidental and
docs not detract from it materially.
