# Cards Tackle Tigers, Dons; Given Almost Even Chance for Victories
## 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
With victory No. 1 for the week already behind them, Stanford's cagers resume action on the
Pavilion boards in a split weekend doubleheadsr when they tangle with the College of Pacific
Tigers this p.m. and University of San Francisco tomorrow night.
Time for the main event in both instances is 8 p.m. The "B's" open hostilities on both
nights, meeting Moffat Field's JVs tonight, and Buchanan Hall of the intramurals tomorrow.
For the first time this season Stanford will enter a weekend game on the long end of the
odds, COP appearing even less effective now than did the Big Reds in the beginning of the
season.
In cold unemotional figures, COP has the better record of the two, but breaking the figures

down brings to light a flock ol dis
crepancies that the record as a whole
Lends to conceal. The Tigers have
won seven games, holding victories
jver Nevada, 41-39 in an overlimt?
brawl, Chico State and Cal Ag ies,
among others. In turn, however,
.hey have bowed to Nevada, 43-32,
Cal, 43-26, St. Mary's Pre-Flight, St.
Mary's, Chico State, and S. J\ State.
All of which gives Stanford a pre
jame edge of some dozen points over
.he fast, scrappy little visitors.
COP has two men who can really
play basketball: Frankie Boyle and
Frankie Burkett.starting guard and
forward, respectively. At center is
six-foot three-inch Stan Reames,
while the remaining positions will
he filled by forward John Guil
fole and guard Charlie Cooke.
Chris Kjeldsen coaches the Tigers.
The USF Dons are in a slightly
stronger position, due to a more bal
anced squad. The Dons started out.
like a house afire, but alas, they soon
ran out of kindling to burn and
have since been colder than Encina
soup. The Dons play in the North
ern California Basketball league, a
better-than-average combine of in
dependent Bay Area clubs, but have
had only 50-50 luck in their games,
The Saturday night visitors opened
their season by wumphing such out
fits as Ft. Mason. S.F. Marine, San
Bruno Navy (twice), Treasure Is
land, 56-30, Coast Guard Air Station,
and Alameda NAS, 45-39. At that,
point the Dons fell apart and pro
ceeded to absorb lacings at the hand 3
of Fleet City, 60-43, Hamilton Field,
40-34, Santa Clara. 46-35, Pre-Flight,
43-34, and Cal, 38-32.
Coached by William R. "Tiny"
Bussenius, the Dons are a young,
small, fast, extremely versatile
squad. The Cards should not en
ter the fray on any worse odds
than even money.
The lineup for the Cards tonight
will be the same as it has been for
the past three games, with a little
luck in combating injuries. The
plague has descended on Forwards
Tom Hood and Gene Martin, al
though both are tentatively listed as
starters.

Hood has been !aid low with a
slight attack of flu, but will prob
alily ready up by game time. Mar
tin injured his arm in the last play
of Wednesday's game, and has
since been carrying it around in a
sling. In the event that either of
the two is unable to play, Jack
Meredith will start.
Tom Murphy, who has improved
tremendously in the last three games
both in shooting and under the back
board, will start at center. Captain
Bill Christianson and Tom Redman
will open at, the guards.
(Incidentally, this "plague" is no
respecter of position, what with
Coach Everett Dean ready to take to
his sickbed with influenza at the
drop of his doctor's hat.)


HIGHPOINT MAN in Wednesday's victory over the Del Monte Navy
team, forward Gene Martin will he among the starting five in tonight's

game with C.O.P.
With victory No. 1 for the week already behind them, Stanford's cagers resume action on the
Pavilion boards in a split weekend doubleheadsr when they tangle with the College of Pacific
Tigers this p.m. and University of San Francisco tomorrow night.
Time for the main event in both instances is 8 p.m. The "B's" open hostilities on both
nights, meeting Moffat Field's JVs tonight, and Buchanan Hall of the intramurals tomorrow.
For the first time this season Stanford will enter a weekend game on the long end of the
odds, COP appearing even less effective now than did the Big Reds in the beginning of the
season.
In cold unemotional figures, COP has the better record of the two, but breaking the figures

down brings to light a flock ol dis
crepancies that the record as a whole
Lends to conceal. The Tigers have
won seven games, holding victories
jver Nevada, 41-39 in an overlimt?
brawl, Chico State and Cal Ag ies,
among others. In turn, however,
.hey have bowed to Nevada, 43-32,
Cal, 43-26, St. Mary's Pre-Flight, St.
Mary's, Chico State, and S. J\ State.
All of which gives Stanford a pre
jame edge of some dozen points over
.he fast, scrappy little visitors.
COP has two men who can really
play basketball: Frankie Boyle and
Frankie Burkett.starting guard and
forward, respectively. At center is
six-foot three-inch Stan Reames,
while the remaining positions will
he filled by forward John Guil
fole and guard Charlie Cooke.

The USF Dons are in a slightly

better-than-average combine of in

had only 50-50 luck in their games,
The Saturday night visitors opened
their season by wumphing such out
fits as Ft. Mason. S.F. Marine, San
Bruno Navy (twice), Treasure Is
land, 56-30, Coast Guard Air Station,
and Alameda NAS, 45-39. At that,
