# Lake, Boathouse Opening Herald Farm Sun Times
## 
### MELLON SHELTON 
Beginning at 1 this afternoon,
Lake Lagunita will be open to all
students who dare brave the chilly
waters for a swim. In conjunction
with the opening of "the Lake," as
it is known to Farm students, will
be the extension of Boathouse privi
leges to all students.
Long the high spot of spring
quarter sun times, Stanford's
famed red and white Boathouse
has always been a favorite with
students either as a jumping-off
place for swimmers, or as a spot
where sun-mad Indians can ac
quire that Stanford tan.
The Boathouse, on the Roble side
of Lake Lagunita, is a landmark for
pieknickers and golfers returning
from the hills, and a must-see for
tourists visiting the Farm. In addi
tion to sporting two large floats at
water level, the Boathouse has an
additional sun deck topside, dress
ing rooms, and a canoe storeroom.
In the lake itself are two more floats.
The Boathouse has its rules, how
ever, and they were released re
cently by Student Manager B. J.
Calfee. They are:
1. No one except Stanford stu
dents shall he allowed on the Boat
house dcck or in Lagunita.
2. No swimming or canoeing
when life guards are not on duty.
There shall he no swimming
beyond the rafts at any time.
4. Canoes and boats should not

be overloaded.
5. No non-swimmer shall be al
lowed in the canoes.
0. No one shall change places in
a canoe or boat off-shore.
7. No running on the Boathouse
deck.
8. All living groups are warned
to lock all canoes to racks, and
keep their paddles in lockers pro
vided. The A.S.S.U. cannot lie re
sponsible for the misuse of ca
noes that are not kept locked.
!). Do not leave valuables in
the dressing rooms or in the Boat
house office.
Lifeguards are on duty during
Boathouse hours, which arc 1 to 6 |
p.m. weekdays, and 10 a.m. to 6 ;
p.m. Saturdays and Sundays. All
students, the lifeguards live at the |
Boathouse the year around.
Besides its service as an ideal
place to soak in California sun
shine, the Boathouse is also the
scene of Stanford's annua] Big
Game rally, the Junior Water Car
nival, and various barbecues held
at the nearby Barbecue Pit.
The lake, itself, is dry from about
June to December each year, and ,
begins to fill up with the first winter
rains. A belief long held by Farm j
students was that the phenomenon '
of the lake's gradual filling was due j
entirely to a not-so-sunny Califor- \
nia winter. In reality, it is filled with j
fresh water let in from Scarsville j
Dam. The rains only help.
