# To Skid and Lisa
## 
### 
Perhaps at no other time is a Daily editor so
aware of the organization and the people he has
worked with than the day he sits down to type
out his traditional last edit to the incoming edi
tor of the next volume. Traditionally, too, an
edit is written to the losing candidate in the
elections for editor; but this quarter there was
no loser, and you, Skid, were nominated and
elected by a unanimous staff decision.
To you, Lisa, goes the post of managing edi
tor, a job which has less of the glory or glam
our, more of the hard plugging work that goes
into the daily assigning of stories, the continual
remembering and control of so many details
that are vital to the production of "The Peninsu
la's Only Morning Newspaper." You will find
that when policies are discussed and formulat
ed, or when difficult decisions must be made,
you may be the person to whom Skid will turn.
Your past staff and Edit Board work, always
done with precision, understanding, and warm
interest, is a sound basis for your new job.
Having worked with Skid, I know just how im
portant the managing editor is to the editor and
to the entire staff.
I think you know, Skid, what you will find
here when you take over the keys and the
swivel chair. As editor you will hold an impor
tant position in campus life, for the Daily can
be a force for the good or detriment of a uni
versity that is now facing the tremendous prob
lems relating to conversion from war to
peace. Your knowledge and thoughts on Stan
ford's wartime tradition and the present situa
tion, coupled with an increase in the Daily's
ability to present news and opinion of all
groups, can build a strong foundation for the
future.
Without question, I knew that you will com
bat any attempts to restrict what the Daily prints,
and that you v/ill reserve the right to comment
on foreign affairs, and fight against the trend to
ward isolationist thought and action (at Stanford
it's called the "Ivory Tower") that, sadly
enough, appears inevitable in the "post-war
era."
I think you know, too, Skid, what the Daily
means to me, after working with you and the
staff through these quarters. You know the
associates who have always put the good of
the staff and the paper before thought of them
selves . . . the back shop, the biz staff . . . staff
members of previous volumes . . . night editors
and H.C.E.'s through cub reporters, who have
sacrificed grade points, missed meals, vaca
tions, and Sunday afternoons to stay in the dirty
little shack and "pound out more copy, write 2
thirty-six" . . . —You and Lisa know what it
means to have those people believing in you
and willing to work with you. This is the time,
then, to say "30," and "thanks"—to you and to
every staff member, for Volume 108, and for the
chance to stay with all of you through Volume
109. —Helen

means to have those people believing in you
and willing to work with you. This is the time,
then, to say "30," and "thanks"—to you and to
every staff member, for Volume 108, and for the
chance to stay with all of you through Volume
109. —Helen
Perhaps at no other time is a Daily editor so
aware of the organization and the people he has
worked with than the day he sits down to type
out his traditional last edit to the incoming edi
tor of the next volume. Traditionally, too, an
edit is written to the losing candidate in the
elections for editor; but this quarter there was
no loser, and you, Skid, were nominated and
elected by a unanimous staff decision.
To you, Lisa, goes the post of managing edi
tor, a job which has less of the glory or glam
our, more of the hard plugging work that goes
into the daily assigning of stories, the continual
remembering and control of so many details
that are vital to the production of "The Peninsu
la's Only Morning Newspaper." You will find
that when policies are discussed and formulat
ed, or when difficult decisions must be made,
you may be the person to whom Skid will turn.
Your past staff and Edit Board work, always
done with precision, understanding, and warm
interest, is a sound basis for your new job.
Having worked with Skid, I know just how im
portant the managing editor is to the editor and
to the entire staff.
I think you know, Skid, what you will find
here when you take over the keys and the
swivel chair. As editor you will hold an impor
tant position in campus life, for the Daily can
be a force for the good or detriment of a uni
versity that is now facing the tremendous prob
lems relating to conversion from war to
peace. Your knowledge and thoughts on Stan
ford's wartime tradition and the present situa
tion, coupled with an increase in the Daily's
ability to present news and opinion of all
groups, can build a strong foundation for the
future.
Without question, I knew that you will com
bat any attempts to restrict what the Daily prints,
and that you v/ill reserve the right to comment
on foreign affairs, and fight against the trend to
ward isolationist thought and action (at Stanford
it's called the "Ivory Tower") that, sadly
enough, appears inevitable in the "post-war
era."
I think you know, too, Skid, what the Daily
means to me, after working with you and the
staff through these quarters. You know the
associates who have always put the good of
the staff and the paper before thought of them
selves . . . the back shop, the biz staff . . . staff
members of previous volumes . . . night editors
and H.C.E.'s through cub reporters, who have
sacrificed grade points, missed meals, vaca
tions, and Sunday afternoons to stay in the dirty
little shack and "pound out more copy, write 2
thirty-six" . . . —You and Lisa know what it
means to have those people believing in you
and willing to work with you. This is the time,
