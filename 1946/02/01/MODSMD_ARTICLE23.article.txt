# Bull Session
## 
### CATHRYN OWEN 
Buck up—the boathouse is opening, the fac
ulty has been permanently disabled by their
past week's blue book capers, Cleveland's be
ing cozy again, and from now on you'll have
Bull Session, pre-war style, five.times a week.
I might explain what this is all about—these
last few Dailies full of Daily publicity and fare
well tears dripping from everytning but the
want ads. Not that this has anything to do
with the Daily's original mission of providing
indigestion with the Cellar coffee every morn
ing, but the Daily stops for a breather every
once in a while and calls it a new volume. Thi3
is Volume 108. Monday, it won't look much
different, but it will be Volume 109.
Now this isn't an established fact—Publica
tions Council will probably flatly deny it—but
one of the main reasons for starting a new vol

ume is that mercy killings of columnists are
socially unacceptable. Or shall we just say,
there's a lav/ agin' 'em.
Of course, the columnists themselves don't
exactly frown on this practice of ending it all
by the volume system. It just sort of heartens
them. You know, it gives them faith just when
they think that they don't have the strength to
dodge one more Acme bottle. They start count
ing on their several feet—"ls more Sessions
until the last issue, then I can spend six inches
saying goodbye."
Then the last issue comes, and by then
they're so weary and confused on the sound
ness of the mercy killing theory, that they
can't even make a simple word like g-o-o-d-b-y-e
stretch out to six inches.
Soooo, they tell what happens to all retired
Bull Sessioners. The first week of retirement,
they catch up on all back correspondence. Us
ually they just send out mimeographed letters,
stating that libel really isn't libel when you
really didn't know that that thing you were
talking about actually existed.
Then they either quietly collapse, or go into
the Daily profession of writing Bulletin Board
notices eight hours a day.
Six inches —goodber!
