# HISTORY -1946

### ELLIOT EPSTEEN 
The basis of a column in any paper, and es
pecially in a campus paper, should be to pro
voke discussion. The articles appearing in the
last two issues seem to have done that.
Yet the answer to the stated interpretation
seems to have a few fallacies. Mr. George
Brunn, who wrote the editorial entitled "Rus
sian Repercussion" and who is an excellent
writer of firm and honest convictions, stated,
for instance, that the industrial development
that this column had called inefficient had
bridged a 60-year gap in 25 years.
He wrote, "Russia in 1917 had about the
same industrial development as Germany in
1880. By 1942, the two countries were nearly
equal."
NAZI VICTORIES
Still, a look at the war maps published during
the beginning of the Russian campaign makes
these figures seem doubtful. Germany over
ran an area twice the size of her own country.
She did not do that with superiority in man
power, certainly. It had to be overwhelming
power in the basis of modern warfare, mechan
ized equipment and the factories to make it.
As for the statement that Russia won Stalin
grad without the benefits of lend-lease, this is
also wrong by the facts. Tass, the Soviet news
agency, was constantly sending out dispatches
on the work of jeep borne battalions and tank
busting airocobras. At least one armored brig
ade equipped with American tanks was located
by the Russians at the field.
And, as for the necessity of lend-lease to
Russia, Stalin himself said at the Teheran con
ference, "without America's great productive
capacity, we wouldn't have won."
IVAN AGAIN
As for the statement that "so far, we have
not the slightest indication that 'Ivan' is' op
posed to his government's planning," read the
dispatches of a few months ago in any news
paper on the stunned expressions with which
Soviet soldiers view the standard of living of
the rest of the world, and look at the frantic
series of feature article in Pravda on why
wanting a standing of living including smoking
jackets and private bathrooms is immoral in a
Soviet state.
It seems that the Russian soldier is indeed
demanding more, and Stalin has to supply it.
Mr. Brunn admits that Russian industry is
wrecked, but that is a reason for imports of new
tools to rebuild it and expand it; not, as Mr.
Brunn thinks, a reason why Stalin will try to
avoid importing.
NAME-CALLING
Mr. Brunn wrote that, "In today's (yester
day's) column, Epsteen deplores Russian power
politics. We, too, have little sympathy with it.
But we believe that name-calling does not lead
to an adequate solution."
This column does not deplore Russian politi
cal moves for moral reasons, but because they
are defeating Stalin's own ends, and might
bring war. Stalin probably has sense enough
to realize that he has to import a gigantic ma
chine tool industry quickly in order to make
goods to prevent a revolution.
You can't import without exports. Stalin is
getting his stuff to export out of his neighbors,
but, in pursuing that policy, he needs to have a
gigantic army. Power politics is the using of
power, and modern power is very expensive.
But if there reaches a time when Stalin can't
keep his big army and increase his standards
of living too, he will have to either step down or
get his people rich by banditry. That is why
the present Russian situation is dangerous, and
why we must show Russia that, "We will help
you get the things you need to live better, but
we demand that you keep to your borders, and
if you do, we will demobilize with you and do
the same."
