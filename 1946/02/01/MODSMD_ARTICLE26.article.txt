The Angels Lean
I Monday night in the City of the
■ Angels, Downbeat Magazine pre-
I sented its Award Winners Concert,
| which honored some of the musi
i cians that were accorded an "Os-
I ::ar" in the Downbeat popularity
j poll.
The concert was presented through j
; the sponsorship of Norman Gran/-,
| who has been heading coast jazz
sessions for several years. Golden
Gaters will remember Mr. Granz for
the recent get-together that he spon- j
sored at the Civic Auditorium fea
turing Coleman Hawkins, Roy El- i
I dridge, and Mead Lux Lewis.
Downbeat Concert
The Downbeat concert featured |
■ many of the star musicians that are I
! now engaged in Los Angeles, for the |
' city has more real music now than 1
| ever before.
Just to give you an idea of who i
i and what is providing the entertain
ment in the form of jazz for the
southern city's populace, look at this
list!!! Ait Tatum, Stan Kenton, Ed
die Heywood, Andre Previn, Kid
Ory, Benny Goodman, Peggy Lee,
Joe Turner, Barney Bigard, Bob
Crosby, Jo Jones, Gerald Wilson,
I and Errol Garner are all kicking it
1 around in Los Angeles.
Now, add to this list the luminaries
j that were present at the concert, and j
one really has proof that finally there 1
is a city that can rival New York j
; when it comes to the "real jazz."
Gillespie Influence
The first group started the Phil- 1
harmonic Auditorium jumping with 1
1 three "ever - greens" — "Lady Be i
Good," "I Can't Get Started," and ,
"After You've Gone." The person
| nel was in perfect coordination, and I
| the "Dizzy" influence was quite
i prominent. Arnold Ross, Harry |
| James' youthful pianist, was in fine
j form; Lee Young, Lester's brother, j
was on drums; Billy Hadnott, a
strictly L.A. musician, was on bass; j
A 1 Killian from the Charlie Barnet
crew, on trumpet; Lester Young on !
j tenor; Howard McGhee, playing his
I "Dizzyish" trumpet, and Willie |
Smith with his wonderful alto. Anita 1
O'Day was scheduled to appear to :
! sing a few numbers, hut did not ar- !
! rive. This kind of thing is always !
frequent at a Granz concert.
Krupa Jazz
The second set was on the com- j
| mercial side, and therefore produced
j far less good music. The artists were
the Gene Krupa Jazz Trio featuring ;
Charlie Venturo, Downbeat winner,
on tenor. Teddy Napolean was the
j pianist and was in such a deep
groove that he couldn't even be seen
j next to the "Drummin' Man," who
j is a show in himself, and Mr. Ven
' luro. The numbers performed were
; of the highest quality being "Stomp-
I in' at the Savoy," "Body and Soul"

and "Dark Eyes."
The auditorium then went mad as
"royalty" appeared upon the scene.
It was the King Cole trio playing
"Sweet Lorraine" and receiving theii
awards. The Pied Pipers were also
given their award at the same time.
Mel Powell on Piano
The best was the last as can easily
be seen by the musicians who
jammed during this set. Mel Powell, ;
who was selected by Downbeat read
ers as the pianist of the year; Charlie
Venturo, the Krupa sideman; Wil
lie Smith, who also won an award;
Dizzy Gillespie, with his frantic
trumpet; and Lester Young, playing
his first civilian stand since his days
luring Charlie "Bird" Parker have
loists.
The rhythm was the same as in
the first group, and this time Helen
Humes, the programed thrush, made
her appearance as scheduled. She
sang the ever-popular "If I Could Be
With You" and her famous blue
"Beba Ba Luba." The other tunes
chosen were "The Man I Love,
"Crazy Rhythm," and "Lover, Come
Back to Me."
Goodman Clarinetless
Although this session had most of
the faults that others in the past
have had, it certainly produced some
fine music. Even more of interest
was the appearance of some of the
finest artists on the swing scene.
The most disappointing factor was
the presence of Benny Goodman
without his clarinet. Maybe San
Francisco will be next in line lor
some real music!

Off the Record
Dizzy Gillespie and his combo fea
after his stay at the Paramount in
decided to leave Los Ar.geles and
head east when their engagement
runs out on the 3rd. Dizzy was not
too well received by the public al
though the professionals packed the
"supper club" every night. . . . The
Woodchopper, Woody Herman, will
soon join the ranks of the vaca
tioners taking a well-deserved rest
after his stay at the Paramunt in
New York. . . . Neal Hefti, Mr. Fran
ces Wayne, has left the Herman
Herd. Could that mean that "Miss"
Wayne is soon planning to depart
also? . . . Stan Kenton and the King
Cole Trio are planning a summer
air-show together. We certainly are
in hopes that the deal comes
through! . . . Kid Ory, the ancient
angel from the Land of Dreams, and
his boys now have an air-shot over
NBC beginning January 10. . . .
Tony Pastor has left Victor and has
signed with Cosmo Recording Co.
It's getting so Victor is now making
"square" discs instead of the normal
"oval" ones. . . . Well, that's all the
musical notes for this week, so until
we modulate once again—we leave
you with this thought — Seeev

frequent at a Granz concert.
Krupa Jazz
The second set was on the com- j
| mercial side, and therefore produced
j far less good music. The artists were
the Gene Krupa Jazz Trio featuring ;
Charlie Venturo, Downbeat winner,
on tenor. Teddy Napolean was the
j pianist and was in such a deep
groove that he couldn't even be seen
j next to the "Drummin' Man," who
j is a show in himself, and Mr. Ven
' luro. The numbers performed were
; of the highest quality being "Stomp-
I in' at the Savoy," "Body and Soul"

and "Dark Eyes."
The auditorium then went mad as
"royalty" appeared upon the scene.
It was the King Cole trio playing
"Sweet Lorraine" and receiving theii
awards. The Pied Pipers were also
given their award at the same time.
Mel Powell on Piano
The best was the last as can easily
be seen by the musicians who
jammed during this set. Mel Powell, ;
who was selected by Downbeat read
ers as the pianist of the year; Charlie
Venturo, the Krupa sideman; Wil
lie Smith, who also won an award;
Dizzy Gillespie, with his frantic
trumpet; and Lester Young, playing
his first civilian stand since his days
luring Charlie "Bird" Parker have
loists.
The rhythm was the same as in
the first group, and this time Helen
Humes, the programed thrush, made
her appearance as scheduled. She
sang the ever-popular "If I Could Be
With You" and her famous blue
"Beba Ba Luba." The other tunes
chosen were "The Man I Love,
"Crazy Rhythm," and "Lover, Come
Back to Me."
Goodman Clarinetless
Although this session had most of
the faults that others in the past
have had, it certainly produced some
fine music. Even more of interest
was the appearance of some of the
finest artists on the swing scene.
The most disappointing factor was
the presence of Benny Goodman
without his clarinet. Maybe San
Francisco will be next in line lor
some real music!

The Angels Lean
I Monday night in the City of the
■ Angels, Downbeat Magazine pre-
I sented its Award Winners Concert,
| which honored some of the musi
i cians that were accorded an "Os-
I ::ar" in the Downbeat popularity
j poll.
The concert was presented through j
; the sponsorship of Norman Gran/-,
| who has been heading coast jazz
sessions for several years. Golden
Gaters will remember Mr. Granz for
the recent get-together that he spon- j
sored at the Civic Auditorium fea
turing Coleman Hawkins, Roy El- i
I dridge, and Mead Lux Lewis.
Downbeat Concert
The Downbeat concert featured |
■ many of the star musicians that are I
! now engaged in Los Angeles, for the |
' city has more real music now than 1
| ever before.
Just to give you an idea of who i
i and what is providing the entertain
ment in the form of jazz for the
southern city's populace, look at this
list!!! Ait Tatum, Stan Kenton, Ed
die Heywood, Andre Previn, Kid
Ory, Benny Goodman, Peggy Lee,
Joe Turner, Barney Bigard, Bob
Crosby, Jo Jones, Gerald Wilson,
I and Errol Garner are all kicking it
1 around in Los Angeles.
Now, add to this list the luminaries
j that were present at the concert, and j
one really has proof that finally there 1
is a city that can rival New York j
; when it comes to the "real jazz."
Gillespie Influence
The first group started the Phil- 1
harmonic Auditorium jumping with 1
1 three "ever - greens" — "Lady Be i
Good," "I Can't Get Started," and ,
"After You've Gone." The person
| nel was in perfect coordination, and I
| the "Dizzy" influence was quite
i prominent. Arnold Ross, Harry |
| James' youthful pianist, was in fine
j form; Lee Young, Lester's brother, j
was on drums; Billy Hadnott, a
strictly L.A. musician, was on bass; j
A 1 Killian from the Charlie Barnet
crew, on trumpet; Lester Young on !
j tenor; Howard McGhee, playing his
I "Dizzyish" trumpet, and Willie |
Smith with his wonderful alto. Anita 1
O'Day was scheduled to appear to :
! sing a few numbers, hut did not ar- !
! rive. This kind of thing is always !
frequent at a Granz concert.
Krupa Jazz
The second set was on the com- j
| mercial side, and therefore produced
j far less good music. The artists were
the Gene Krupa Jazz Trio featuring ;
Charlie Venturo, Downbeat winner,
on tenor. Teddy Napolean was the
j pianist and was in such a deep
groove that he couldn't even be seen
j next to the "Drummin' Man," who
j is a show in himself, and Mr. Ven
' luro. The numbers performed were
; of the highest quality being "Stomp-
I in' at the Savoy," "Body and Soul"

and "Dark Eyes."
The auditorium then went mad as
"royalty" appeared upon the scene.
It was the King Cole trio playing
"Sweet Lorraine" and receiving theii
awards. The Pied Pipers were also
given their award at the same time.
Mel Powell on Piano
The best was the last as can easily
be seen by the musicians who
jammed during this set. Mel Powell, ;
who was selected by Downbeat read
ers as the pianist of the year; Charlie
Venturo, the Krupa sideman; Wil
lie Smith, who also won an award;
Dizzy Gillespie, with his frantic
trumpet; and Lester Young, playing
his first civilian stand since his days
luring Charlie "Bird" Parker have
loists.
The rhythm was the same as in
the first group, and this time Helen
Humes, the programed thrush, made
her appearance as scheduled. She
sang the ever-popular "If I Could Be
With You" and her famous blue
"Beba Ba Luba." The other tunes
chosen were "The Man I Love,
"Crazy Rhythm," and "Lover, Come
Back to Me."
Goodman Clarinetless
Although this session had most of
the faults that others in the past
have had, it certainly produced some
fine music. Even more of interest
was the appearance of some of the
finest artists on the swing scene.
The most disappointing factor was
the presence of Benny Goodman
without his clarinet. Maybe San
Francisco will be next in line lor
some real music!
