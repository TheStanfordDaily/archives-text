## 
### BRUCE MITCHELL 
Handling the incoming periodicals
and serials is the job of the period
ical room of the main library. The
room checks in about 30,000 different
copies of 3,000 different publications
each year.
Material is collected by the - li
brary through gifts, exchanges, and
subscriptions. Twice as many pe
riodicals are collected by gifts and
exchanges as through subscriptions
by the library itself.
Foreign Publications
Stanford exchanges periodicals
with all the large universities in the
United States and with many others
in foreign countries. Files held in
Europe for the University during the
war are being received now. Many
have been received from France
while the trade between the Scandi
navian countries and Stanford has
been practically resumed.
Several of the editions from
France that have been published
after the liberation of that country
have changed their titles because of
their compelled collaboration with
the Nazis during the occupation.
Most of the scientific journals con
tinued their publication during the
war although fewer copies were is
sued.
Recent Gift
Among the recent gilts to the
periodical room of the library is the
collection of Herman Knoche, a
Stanford graduate who died last year
and willed his library to Stanford.
As he was a botanist his periodicals
are largely about that subject.
The periodical room was built es
pecially to suit periodicals when the
library was built in 1919. The cur
rent numbers of the most used pe
riodicals are kept in alcoves es
pecially constructed for that pur
pose. Back copies are placed in the
drawers beneath the alcoves. As the
volumes are completed they are
bound in the University Press and

then are placed in the stacks adja
-1 cent to the room.
| Serials Catalogued
The periodical room subscribes to
; all those magazines which are listed
in the Readers Guide. The serials
in the large libraries throughout the
United States and Canada are cata
logued in the "'Union List of Serials"
| which may be found either in the
' periodical or in the reference room,
j The periodical room is under the
| supervision of the reference room
which is in charge of Willard Youngs.
It is the central checking bureau for
I all the periodicals in the various
i libraries on campus with the excep

exchanges as through subscriptions
by the library itself.
Foreign Publications
Stanford exchanges periodicals
with all the large universities in the
United States and with many others
in foreign countries. Files held in
Europe for the University during the
war are being received now. Many
have been received from France
while the trade between the Scandi
navian countries and Stanford has
been practically resumed.
Several of the editions from
France that have been published
after the liberation of that country
have changed their titles because of
their compelled collaboration with
the Nazis during the occupation.
Most of the scientific journals con
tinued their publication during the
war although fewer copies were is
sued.
Recent Gift
Among the recent gilts to the
periodical room of the library is the
collection of Herman Knoche, a
Stanford graduate who died last year
and willed his library to Stanford.
As he was a botanist his periodicals
are largely about that subject.
The periodical room was built es
pecially to suit periodicals when the
library was built in 1919. The cur
rent numbers of the most used pe
riodicals are kept in alcoves es
pecially constructed for that pur
pose. Back copies are placed in the
drawers beneath the alcoves. As the
volumes are completed they are
bound in the University Press and

then are placed in the stacks adja
