# Transfers to Draw with Academic Class Says Housing Com; Other Rules Listed
## 
### 
Housing Committee yesterday de
cided that transfers \£ill draw for
rooms just as they have always done,
by drawing with their academic
class. The decision was made upon
the suggestion that transfers who
have been at Stanford only one or
two quarters not be* given prefer
ence over sophomores who have
been here five or six quarters. The
committee decided to favor the num
ber of quarters a student has left
at Stanford rather than those she
has already spent here.
The suggestion that women who
will be first quarter juniors spring
quarter be allowed to draw this
spring with either their junior aca
demic class or their sophomore social
class was passed by the committee.
Hereafter this group will draw with
its academic class. The concession
was made because last year these
women were not permitted to draw
with their sophomore academic
class.
When two women of different
classes draw together, they will draw
with the lower class. All of these
decisions will be subject to the ap
proval of Women's Conference Mon
day.
The question of whether Hous
ing Committee should he an elec
tive or appointive body was not
decided. The following is Article
VII of the Women's Conference
constitution which sets up Hous
ing Committee as it now is:
1. Purpose. The Housing Com
mittee shall he a standing commit
tee of Women's Conference to
work with the University Admin
istration in deciding policies and
program concerning women's
housing and in helping to carry
them out. Its minutes must he

approved by the Conference.
2. Membership. The Housing
Committee shall consist of the
chairman of Housing Committee,
the president of Women's Confer
ence, and two women from each
residence area.
.'{. Appointment. The chairmen
and members of this committee
shall lie appointed during spring
quarter to serve for the following
year. They shall lie appointed by
the Conference Advisory Hoard in
conjunction with the outgoing
chairman, after recommendations
have been made by the Confer
ence. In making appointments,
due regard should be taken for
class representation and for car
ry-over from the previous com
mittee. The freshmen members
shall be appointed during the filth
week of fall quarter.
Mary Lesnett, stating that she rep
resented a large group of sophomore
women, said that there is much un
rest among the sophomores this year.
Most of the sophomores, she said,
would like to live in a small house,
but there is only room for a few ol
them to live there.
Therefore, she suggested a plan
whereby all sophomores would live
in a large dormitory. Small houses
would be only for juniors or seniors.
Then, she said, all of the sophomores
would be able to live in a small
house two years instead of just a
few for three years. Transfers
live with the sophomores if they
wished, or in whatever small house
there is room.
Housing Committee members felt

that this plan would destroy house
spirit and unity, and that students'
acquaintance with women outside of
their class would be limited.
The plan will be presented at
Women's Conference Monday and
taken back to house meetings Mon
day nitfht for discussion.
The committee feels that there
would not be unrest if students
would move into a house with the
idea of staying there, and would
put spirit into a house.

Mary Lesnett, stating that she rep
resented a large group of sophomore
women, said that there is much un
rest among the sophomores this year.
Most of the sophomores, she said,
would like to live in a small house,
but there is only room for a few ol
them to live there.
Therefore, she suggested a plan
whereby all sophomores would live
in a large dormitory. Small houses
would be only for juniors or seniors.
Then, she said, all of the sophomores
would be able to live in a small
house two years instead of just a
few for three years. Transfers
live with the sophomores if they
wished, or in whatever small house
there is room.
Housing Committee members felt

that this plan would destroy house
spirit and unity, and that students'
acquaintance with women outside of
their class would be limited.
The plan will be presented at
Women's Conference Monday and
taken back to house meetings Mon
day nitfht for discussion.
The committee feels that there
would not be unrest if students
would move into a house with the
idea of staying there, and would
put spirit into a house.
Housing Committee yesterday de
cided that transfers \£ill draw for
rooms just as they have always done,
by drawing with their academic
class. The decision was made upon
the suggestion that transfers who
have been at Stanford only one or
two quarters not be* given prefer
ence over sophomores who have
been here five or six quarters. The
committee decided to favor the num
ber of quarters a student has left
at Stanford rather than those she
has already spent here.
The suggestion that women who
will be first quarter juniors spring
quarter be allowed to draw this
spring with either their junior aca
demic class or their sophomore social
class was passed by the committee.
Hereafter this group will draw with
its academic class. The concession
was made because last year these
women were not permitted to draw
with their sophomore academic
class.
When two women of different
classes draw together, they will draw
with the lower class. All of these
decisions will be subject to the ap
proval of Women's Conference Mon
day.
