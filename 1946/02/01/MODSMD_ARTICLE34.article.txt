(This is the second in a series of
articles on the persons for whom
Stanford's former sorority houses
have been re-named.)
Lathrop House is named for Jane
Lathrop Stanford, co-founder, with
Leland Stanford, of the University.
Perhaps even more than her hus
band, Jane Stanford was the founder
of Stanford University. After Mr.
Stanford's death in 1893 when the
new university was threatened with
extinction because of financial diffi
culties and lack of encouragement,
Mrs. Stanford stood fast and against
the advice of her business advisers
and friends kept Stanford open.
She was born Jane Eliza Lathrop
in Albany, New York, in 1828. On
September 31, 1850, she was married
to Leland Stanford, a young man of
Albany who was reading to become
a lawyer. They lived in Port Wash
ington, Wisconsin, for some years,
but. after a fire had destroyed Mr.
Stanford's library of law books they
decided to leave and he went to
California. Later they made their
home in California, at first in Placer
County and later in Sacramento and
San Francisco, with a summer resi
dence on the estate known as Palo
Alto, which later became the campus.
Founder Was Governor
Mr. Stanford was "war governor"
of California in the sixties and later
United States Senator. With his
townsmen of Sacramento, Hunting
ton, Hopkins, and Crocker, he con
structed the first trans-continental
railway, the Central Pacific. Later
from this was built up the whole
Southern Pacific system.
The Stanfords' only son, Leland,
Jr., was born May 14, 18G8, and died
in Florence in 1884. After his death
and under the inspiration of the
educational ideals derived from
their friend Louis Agassiz, they de
cided on the plan of the University,
to be dedicated to the memory of
their son.
"The children of California
shall be our children" was the
expression of their purpose.
The first two years of Stanford
history were the hopeful experiment
of Leland Stanford; but the next
seven years were recorded in the
hopes and fears of his wife.
After Mr. Stanford's death the
estate, which was intended to be
given gradually in its entirety to
the University, fell into the hands of
the courts. The will was in probate,
the debts of the estate had to be
paid and the panic of 1893 was ap
proaching.
Could Stanford Survive?
Dr. David Starr Jordan told of
those days in this way:
"Mrs. Stanford had much to plan

and much to consider. From every
point of view of worldly wisdom it
was clearly necessary to close the
University until the estate was set
tled and in her hands. Her own
fortune was the estate itself. Out
side of a collection of her jewels
given by her husband, she had prac
tically nothing of her own save the
community estate." This could not
be hers until all the debts had been
paid which amounted to eight mil
lion dollars.
Dr. Jordan continued :"Mrs. Stan
ford called me to her house to say
that the die was cast. She was going
ahead with the University. She
would turn over to us whatever she
could get. We must come down to
bedrock on expenses, but with the
help of the Lord and the memory of
her husband the University must go
ahead and develop its character in
the hope of better times ahead."
Red for Victory
Tliis complication was not enough,
but to add to the difficulties the
United States government brought
suit for fifteen millions for the pur
pose of tying up everything in the
Stanford estate until the debt of the
Central Pacific Railway should be
paid.
The suit was brought to trial in
San Francisco where the decision
was against the government. It was
appealed to the Supreme Court of
the United States where, at her re
quest to President Cleveland, the
case was speedily brought to trial
and was declared in favor of Mrs.
Stanford. The campus post office was
painted cardinal red on this occa
sion.
From Gems to Books
This was the end of the worst
days of Mrs. Stanford's hopes for
Stanford, but there were still seri
ous problems until the estate should
come into her hands. She went to
London to sell the jewels her hus
band had given her, but returned
with little profit.
Later, when the University was
going well she sold them to create a
permanent fund for the purchase of
books for the Library.
Of her connection with the oth
er people of the early Stanford
days, Dr. Jordan has said that
"While matters inside the faculty

and the details of instruction were
left to those supposed to be ex
perts in these lines, for this was
her husband's wish, she had al
ways before Iter his purposes.
'What would Mr. Stanford do un
der these conditions?' was always
her first question."
"To outside suggestions she
would reply 'I will never concern
myself with the religion, the poli
tics or the love affairs of any pro
fessor in Stanord University,' and
this resolution she kept."
As the estate came into her hands
she transferred it to the Board of
Trustees, of which she became the
president. Later in her life she left
for a trip around the world in order
to give the Board of Trustees abso
lute freedom in taking up their re
sponsibilities.
Upon her death in Honolulu in
1905, Dr. Jordan said:
"No one outside the University
can understand the difficulties in
her way in the final establishment
of the University and her patient
deeds of self-sacrifice can he
known only to those who saw them
from day to day. Some day the
world may understand a part of
this. It will then know her for the
wisest as well as the most gener
ous friend of learning in our
time."

Dr. David Starr Jordan told of
those days in this way:
"Mrs. Stanford had much to plan

and much to consider. From every
point of view of worldly wisdom it
was clearly necessary to close the
University until the estate was set
tled and in her hands. Her own
fortune was the estate itself. Out
side of a collection of her jewels
given by her husband, she had prac
tically nothing of her own save the
community estate." This could not
be hers until all the debts had been
paid which amounted to eight mil
lion dollars.
Dr. Jordan continued :"Mrs. Stan
ford called me to her house to say
that the die was cast. She was going
ahead with the University. She
would turn over to us whatever she
could get. We must come down to
bedrock on expenses, but with the
help of the Lord and the memory of
her husband the University must go
ahead and develop its character in
the hope of better times ahead."

Tliis complication was not enough,
but to add to the difficulties the
United States government brought
suit for fifteen millions for the pur
pose of tying up everything in the
Stanford estate until the debt of the
Central Pacific Railway should be
paid.
The suit was brought to trial in
San Francisco where the decision
was against the government. It was
appealed to the Supreme Court of
the United States where, at her re
quest to President Cleveland, the
case was speedily brought to trial
and was declared in favor of Mrs.
Stanford. The campus post office was
painted cardinal red on this occa
sion.
From Gems to Books
This was the end of the worst
days of Mrs. Stanford's hopes for
Stanford, but there were still seri
ous problems until the estate should
come into her hands. She went to
London to sell the jewels her hus
band had given her, but returned
with little profit.
Later, when the University was
going well she sold them to create a
permanent fund for the purchase of
books for the Library.
Of her connection with the oth
er people of the early Stanford
days, Dr. Jordan has said that
"While matters inside the faculty

and the details of instruction were
left to those supposed to be ex
perts in these lines, for this was
her husband's wish, she had al
ways before Iter his purposes.
'What would Mr. Stanford do un
der these conditions?' was always
her first question."
"To outside suggestions she
would reply 'I will never concern
myself with the religion, the poli
tics or the love affairs of any pro
fessor in Stanord University,' and
this resolution she kept."
As the estate came into her hands
she transferred it to the Board of
Trustees, of which she became the
president. Later in her life she left
for a trip around the world in order
to give the Board of Trustees abso
lute freedom in taking up their re
sponsibilities.
Upon her death in Honolulu in
1905, Dr. Jordan said:
"No one outside the University
can understand the difficulties in
her way in the final establishment
of the University and her patient
deeds of self-sacrifice can he
known only to those who saw them
from day to day. Some day the
world may understand a part of
this. It will then know her for the
wisest as well as the most gener
ous friend of learning in our
time."

Lathrop House is named for Jane
Lathrop Stanford, co-founder, with
Leland Stanford, of the University.
Perhaps even more than her hus
band, Jane Stanford was the founder
of Stanford University. After Mr.
Stanford's death in 1893 when the
new university was threatened with
extinction because of financial diffi
culties and lack of encouragement,
Mrs. Stanford stood fast and against
the advice of her business advisers
and friends kept Stanford open.
She was born Jane Eliza Lathrop
in Albany, New York, in 1828. On
September 31, 1850, she was married
to Leland Stanford, a young man of
Albany who was reading to become
a lawyer. They lived in Port Wash
ington, Wisconsin, for some years,
but. after a fire had destroyed Mr.
Stanford's library of law books they
decided to leave and he went to
California. Later they made their
home in California, at first in Placer
County and later in Sacramento and
San Francisco, with a summer resi
dence on the estate known as Palo
Alto, which later became the campus.
Founder Was Governor
Mr. Stanford was "war governor"
of California in the sixties and later
United States Senator. With his
townsmen of Sacramento, Hunting
ton, Hopkins, and Crocker, he con
structed the first trans-continental
railway, the Central Pacific. Later
from this was built up the whole
Southern Pacific system.
The Stanfords' only son, Leland,
Jr., was born May 14, 18G8, and died
in Florence in 1884. After his death
and under the inspiration of the
educational ideals derived from
their friend Louis Agassiz, they de
cided on the plan of the University,
to be dedicated to the memory of
their son.
"The children of California
shall be our children" was the
expression of their purpose.
The first two years of Stanford
history were the hopeful experiment
of Leland Stanford; but the next
seven years were recorded in the
hopes and fears of his wife.
After Mr. Stanford's death the
estate, which was intended to be
given gradually in its entirety to
the University, fell into the hands of
the courts. The will was in probate,
the debts of the estate had to be
paid and the panic of 1893 was ap

As the estate came into her hands
she transferred it to the Board of

for a trip around the world in order
to give the Board of Trustees abso

Upon her death in Honolulu in
1905, Dr. Jordan said:
"No one outside the University
can understand the difficulties in
her way in the final establishment
of the University and her patient
deeds of self-sacrifice can he
known only to those who saw them
from day to day. Some day the
world may understand a part of
this. It will then know her for the

time."

Lathrop House is named for Jane
Lathrop Stanford, co-founder, with
Leland Stanford, of the University.
Perhaps even more than her hus
band, Jane Stanford was the founder
of Stanford University. After Mr.
Stanford's death in 1893 when the
new university was threatened with
extinction because of financial diffi
culties and lack of encouragement,
Mrs. Stanford stood fast and against
the advice of her business advisers
and friends kept Stanford open.
She was born Jane Eliza Lathrop
in Albany, New York, in 1828. On
September 31, 1850, she was married
to Leland Stanford, a young man of
Albany who was reading to become
a lawyer. They lived in Port Wash
ington, Wisconsin, for some years,
but. after a fire had destroyed Mr.
Stanford's library of law books they
decided to leave and he went to
California. Later they made their
home in California, at first in Placer
County and later in Sacramento and
San Francisco, with a summer resi
dence on the estate known as Palo
Alto, which later became the campus.
Founder Was Governor
Mr. Stanford was "war governor"
of California in the sixties and later
United States Senator. With his
townsmen of Sacramento, Hunting
ton, Hopkins, and Crocker, he con
structed the first trans-continental
railway, the Central Pacific. Later
from this was built up the whole
Southern Pacific system.
The Stanfords' only son, Leland,
Jr., was born May 14, 18G8, and died
in Florence in 1884. After his death
and under the inspiration of the
educational ideals derived from
their friend Louis Agassiz, they de
cided on the plan of the University,
to be dedicated to the memory of
their son.
"The children of California
shall be our children" was the
expression of their purpose.
The first two years of Stanford
history were the hopeful experiment
of Leland Stanford; but the next
seven years were recorded in the
hopes and fears of his wife.
After Mr. Stanford's death the
estate, which was intended to be
given gradually in its entirety to
the University, fell into the hands of
the courts. The will was in probate,
the debts of the estate had to be
paid and the panic of 1893 was ap
proaching.
Could Stanford Survive?
Dr. David Starr Jordan told of
those days in this way:
"Mrs. Stanford had much to plan

and much to consider. From every
point of view of worldly wisdom it
was clearly necessary to close the
University until the estate was set
tled and in her hands. Her own
fortune was the estate itself. Out
side of a collection of her jewels
given by her husband, she had prac
tically nothing of her own save the
community estate." This could not
be hers until all the debts had been
paid which amounted to eight mil
lion dollars.
Dr. Jordan continued :"Mrs. Stan
ford called me to her house to say
that the die was cast. She was going
ahead with the University. She
would turn over to us whatever she
could get. We must come down to
bedrock on expenses, but with the
help of the Lord and the memory of
her husband the University must go
ahead and develop its character in
the hope of better times ahead."
Red for Victory
Tliis complication was not enough,
but to add to the difficulties the
United States government brought
suit for fifteen millions for the pur
pose of tying up everything in the
Stanford estate until the debt of the
Central Pacific Railway should be
paid.
The suit was brought to trial in
San Francisco where the decision
was against the government. It was
appealed to the Supreme Court of
the United States where, at her re
quest to President Cleveland, the
case was speedily brought to trial
and was declared in favor of Mrs.
Stanford. The campus post office was
painted cardinal red on this occa
sion.
From Gems to Books
This was the end of the worst
days of Mrs. Stanford's hopes for
Stanford, but there were still seri
ous problems until the estate should
come into her hands. She went to
London to sell the jewels her hus
band had given her, but returned
with little profit.
Later, when the University was
going well she sold them to create a
permanent fund for the purchase of
books for the Library.
Of her connection with the oth
er people of the early Stanford
days, Dr. Jordan has said that
"While matters inside the faculty

and the details of instruction were
left to those supposed to be ex
perts in these lines, for this was
her husband's wish, she had al
ways before Iter his purposes.
'What would Mr. Stanford do un
der these conditions?' was always
her first question."
"To outside suggestions she
would reply 'I will never concern
myself with the religion, the poli
tics or the love affairs of any pro
fessor in Stanord University,' and
this resolution she kept."
As the estate came into her hands
she transferred it to the Board of
Trustees, of which she became the
president. Later in her life she left
