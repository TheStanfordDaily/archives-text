## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 (UP).—
President Truman told Congress to
day that final lend- lease settlements
are being negotiated with most re
cipient nations, pointing the way to
ending the operation by June 30.
He submitted the 21st lend-lease
report, covering the third quarter
of 1945, which showed that aid ex
tended during that period came to
$1,895,000,000. This makes a grand
total of $40,040,000,000 sincc lend
lease began in March, 1941, com
pared with reverse lend-lease of
$0,256,871,000 and payments al
ready received of about $1,000,000,-
000.
The report was compiled by the
foreign liquidation commission of
the State Department. It outlined
the termination of lend-lease by
Mr. Truman a week after Japan
surrendered and said that, in spite
>1 this, certain forms of lend-lease
vvere continued to help return
American troops to the United
States, disarm and repatriate Japa
lese troops in China, and avoid fi
lancial difficulties for both the Uni
ed States and nations receiving aid.
Phis lend-lease will be paid for in
ull, however, it said.
Mr. Truman said that fuller fig
ires on termination would be given
n future reports. He noted that
Gngland, which was the largest sin
;le recipient of lend-lease aid with
130,000,000,000, had already made a
inal settlement.
The report showed that lend
ease in the war against Germany
mounted to $27,700,000,000, but that
nuch of this was later used against
apan. Of this, Great Britain re
eived almost $14,000,000,000, and
he Soviet Union about $9,500,000,-
00. All told, the Soviet Union re
eived nearly $11,000,000,000.
