WASHINGTON. Jan. 31 (UP).â€”
President Truman said today that
federal seizure of the strike-bound
steel industry is not now under con
templation and declined to say
whether he saw any possibility of a
break in the stalemated controversy.

] He bluntly rejected a suggestion
by Henry Ford II that price controls
be dropped immediately on all prod
ucts related to the production of
{ automobiles and parts, saying this
could not be done without a wild
! inflation.
