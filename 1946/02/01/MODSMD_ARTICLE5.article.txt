# House Tackles Strikes

### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 31 (UP).—
The House today voted, 2.18 to 114,
to consider one of the most far
reaching anti-strike bills ever intro
duced—a measure which would pe
nalize both unions and employers for
contract violations and give legal
backing to presidentially-appointed
mediation boards.
