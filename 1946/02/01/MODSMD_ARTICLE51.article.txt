# 'Citizens First, Veterans Second'â€”Fifty Farm Students Join Palo Alto A.V.C.
## 
### 
Fifty Stanford students are now
active in the recently organized
Palo Alto chapter of the American
Veterans' Committee, according to
Bud Burdick, chapter chairman.
Together with about 20 Palo Alto
veterans, they have been meeting
in the Community Center, to dis
cuss and take stands on various is
sues of concern to veterans.
However, their concept of veter
ans' affairs seems to be quite broad.
"We wish to emphasize," says Bur
dick, "that we are citizens first and
veterans second. We wish to or
ganize on a broader basis than ex
isting veteran groups."
At their last meeting members
discussed the proposals now before
Congress to establish a Fair Em
ployment Practices Commission.
The chapter endorsed the bill and
sent telegrams to the two Senators

from California and the state's rep
resentatives in the House, advocat
ing action on the measure.
Better America for All
The group will meet again at 8
p.m. Wednesday at the Palo Alto
Community Center. All veterans
are invited to attend.
A.V.C. was founded to give vet
erans a progressive organization,
Burdick says. "We don't want to
be another pressure group concen
trating on bonus fights, parades, and
conventions."
"We know that our problems are
not very different from those of ci
vilians. We kijow that a better
America must mean a better Amer
ica for" all, not merely for special
groups."
Overseas Origin
Burdick, who fs leading the local
group, graduated from Stanford in

1941, served three and a half years
in the Navy, and returned this
quarter to do graduate work in po
litical science.
Reviewiry* the history of the or
ganization, Burdick explained that
it dates back to 1943. It started as a
correspondence group of service
men. Charles Bolte, national chair
man, fought with the British in
North Africa and lost a leg at El
Alamein.
He has recently written a widely
discussed book on the returning
veteran and has been active in or
ganizing A.V.C. on a nation-wide
basis. While attracting little of the
top brass the American Legion
boasts, it now counts among its
members Marine Raider Carlson,
and Bill Mauldin, cartoonist of "Up
Front" fame.
