# First Farm Registrar Tells of Early Days
## 
### JACKIE BOUCHER 
Thinking back over her many
years at Stanford since she came
here with her husband, Dr. O. L.
Elliott, the first registrar here, Mrs.
Ellen Coit Elliott has many tales to
tell of the campus in its earliest
days.
The Elliotts came to California
from New York the summer before
Stanford was opened in 1891. "The
campus as such was hardly recog
nizable," she said, "for only Encina
and the buildings of the Inner Quad
were built—and they weren't fin
shed."
Vo Paly
The Elliotts lived in Menlo, for
there was no luwn of Palo Alto at
ill, except for the surveyors' marks,
ihe street posts, and the unpaved
itreets. "The whole town has
?rown up since the University was
built," she explained.
Asked if all this was not some
what discouraging to them and to
the new faculty which come in that
summer, Mrs. Elliott said no, be
cause "they were young. No one
was over 30 except Dr. Jordan and
Dr. Branner—and they were 'old'
at 40," she laughed.
Faculty Equaled 15
Since not many students were ex
pected that first year, the faculty
numbered only 15, but the Univer
sity kept growing and more and
more were needed. Dr. Elliott im
mediately assumed his position as
registrar after school started, but his
orignal job was that of secretary to
Dr. Jordan.
In addition to Encina and the In
ner Quad, ten faculty houses were
built along Alvarado, and after two
months of rain the need of a board
sidewalk was imperative, she
umiled.
"Old" Koble Built
The "old" Roble was built soon
after the University started, and
was originally scheduled to be
built of stone. However, the stone
on the campus was needed for other
buildings and it was made of ce
ment. The first Roble is the pres
ent site of Sequoia Hall.
Menlo and Mayfield consisted
mainly of saloons and all shopping
for food and clothing had to be done

in San Francisco, she reminisced.
No \utos
Autos did not invade the campus
for 12 or 15 years, Mrs. Elliott said,
but the efficiency of the car was
recognized during the earthquake,
when the railroads were demolished
and cars were needed to take mail
and telegrams as far away as Sacra
mento to be sent out.
"But automobiles weren't as im
portant then as they are now, and
very few persons had them," she
said. Instead, bicycles were the fad.
The high-wheeled ones had just
gone out of fashion. They were
never used universally anyway,
"because they were too skittish,"
she laughed. Faculty and students
alike used the bicycle for transpor
tation.
Becomes Emeritus
After 35 years at Stanford, in 1925,
Dr. Elliott became an emeritus pro
fessor, and soon after began work
on his book relating to the first 25
years of the University. On the
50th anniversary of Stanford, Mrs.
Elliott also wrote a book. Hers is
the story of her life until coming
to Stanford and of her later life
in connection with Stanford. Her
book is called "It Happened This
Way."
Mrs. Elliott is now a great grand
mother and many of her family still
live on the campus. Of the original
faculty she knew there are only two
left, but she still remembers the en
thusiasm of this first group for the
project of Stanford and the "won
derful leadership of Dr. Jordan,"

Becomes Emeritus
After 35 years at Stanford, in 1925,
Dr. Elliott became an emeritus pro
fessor, and soon after began work
on his book relating to the first 25
years of the University. On the
50th anniversary of Stanford, Mrs.
Elliott also wrote a book. Hers is
the story of her life until coming
to Stanford and of her later life
in connection with Stanford. Her
book is called "It Happened This
Way."
Mrs. Elliott is now a great grand
mother and many of her family still
live on the campus. Of the original
faculty she knew there are only two
left, but she still remembers the en
thusiasm of this first group for the
project of Stanford and the "won
derful leadership of Dr. Jordan,"
Thinking back over her many
years at Stanford since she came
here with her husband, Dr. O. L.
Elliott, the first registrar here, Mrs.
Ellen Coit Elliott has many tales to
tell of the campus in its earliest
days.
The Elliotts came to California
from New York the summer before
Stanford was opened in 1891. "The
campus as such was hardly recog
nizable," she said, "for only Encina
and the buildings of the Inner Quad
were built—and they weren't fin
shed."
Vo Paly
The Elliotts lived in Menlo, for
there was no luwn of Palo Alto at
ill, except for the surveyors' marks,
ihe street posts, and the unpaved
itreets. "The whole town has
?rown up since the University was
built," she explained.
Asked if all this was not some
what discouraging to them and to
the new faculty which come in that
summer, Mrs. Elliott said no, be
cause "they were young. No one
was over 30 except Dr. Jordan and
Dr. Branner—and they were 'old'
at 40," she laughed.
Faculty Equaled 15
Since not many students were ex
pected that first year, the faculty
numbered only 15, but the Univer
sity kept growing and more and
more were needed. Dr. Elliott im
mediately assumed his position as
registrar after school started, but his
orignal job was that of secretary to
Dr. Jordan.
In addition to Encina and the In
ner Quad, ten faculty houses were
built along Alvarado, and after two
months of rain the need of a board
sidewalk was imperative, she
umiled.
"Old" Koble Built
The "old" Roble was built soon
after the University started, and
was originally scheduled to be
built of stone. However, the stone
on the campus was needed for other
buildings and it was made of ce
ment. The first Roble is the pres
ent site of Sequoia Hall.
Menlo and Mayfield consisted
mainly of saloons and all shopping
for food and clothing had to be done

in San Francisco, she reminisced.
No \utos
Autos did not invade the campus
for 12 or 15 years, Mrs. Elliott said,
but the efficiency of the car was
recognized during the earthquake,
when the railroads were demolished
and cars were needed to take mail
and telegrams as far away as Sacra
mento to be sent out.
"But automobiles weren't as im
portant then as they are now, and
very few persons had them," she
said. Instead, bicycles were the fad.
The high-wheeled ones had just
gone out of fashion. They were
never used universally anyway,
"because they were too skittish,"
she laughed. Faculty and students
alike used the bicycle for transpor
tation.
