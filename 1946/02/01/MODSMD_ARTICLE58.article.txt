# Dr. Greene Explains Standards to Women
## 
### MARY ELLEN AYRES 
Dr. Theodore Greene, acting pro
fessor of Humanities, carried his
feminine audience through a well
developed outline of the basis, test
ing, and modification of standards as
the first speaker of the Y.W.C.A.
discussion committee.
"The mature person makes reflec
tive commitments," Dr. Greene
stressed in the climax of his in
formal talk. "He acts aware that he
is a human being who can make
judgments but can never find cer
tain truth. The mature person
stands on the shoulders of the past
in making his judgments."
About 'Standards'
Dr. Greene explained that stand
ards basically are a combination of
corporate and individual factors. He
outlined the corporate factors as
family background, social level,
amusements, church and school, and
literature. These corporate factors
are modified by individual adapta
tion: The temperament of the per
son and the homogeneity or con

1 fllct in the individual's background.
"Most young people are very con
ventional," said Dr. Greene. "It is
extremely rare to find a person who
critically evaluates his own basic
! standards."
Crisis in Belief
A radical departure in a person's
life may precipitate evaluation of
beliefs, Dr. Greene told his audience.
Conflicts between standards and un
derlying intellectual curiosity were
i given as equally important precipi
tants of critical thinking.
To test moral, religious, or artistic
standards, Dr. Greene suggested that
the first step is a great sense of hu
mility. "You have to, in effect, 'sit
at the feet' of religious and moral
I teachers."
As a second step, he suggested that
the individual seek people and in
stitutions from which they can find
| understanding. "This requires a
kind of faith," he explained. Dr.
Greene continued, "People change
their standards from taking clues
from other people and institutions
and testing them in their own expe
oeriences."
No Father
Touching on the present turn from
religion, Dr. Greene observed, 'In
our present democracy, 'all men are
j brothers,' but they have no father.
We try to retain the traditional con
cept of the dignity of man without
religious anchorage."
"The question today, is whether
i or not we can maintain a secular so
{ oiety and abandon the religious
background."
