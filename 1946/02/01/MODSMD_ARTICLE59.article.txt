# NRO Alters Wardrobe

What happened to Stanford's sail
ors?
Those strange men on Quad yes
terday were no strangers, but our
own NROTC lads in new plumage.
An interview with Commander
Wilfong, Executive Officer of the
NKOTC unit, produced the follow
ing facts. The uniform we saw yes
terday is that one designated as the
"B" or "Baker uniform" for the
Farm unit. It consists of blue flannel
shirt, blue trousers (without bell
bottoms), black tie, blue belt, and
black shoes and stockings. The new
shirt is paid for by the students
while the trousers are part of the
dress NROTC uniform.
The new collar insignia with
the gold and silver bars or gold
leaves indicate NROTC officers
within the battalion, who are
freshly appointed every quarter.
Tlie remainder of the insignia
have an anchor as a background.
This uniform, together with the
new khaki uniform, is authorized
issue at present for only the NROTC
groups. Comdr. Wilfong stated that
"We were glad to see these uniforms
come in as they will enable us to pick
out quickly our own men from other
ships company and regular Navy
men in the area."
The present clothing shortage
was given as the reason for the
new uniforms' not appearing
sooner. The old style uniform with
the bell bottomed trousers, close
litting jersey, and white hat will
still be worn on occasions. The
question of what uniform will be
worn on what day rests largely on
the laundry' facilities said Cnidr.
Wilfong.
Salty, old line navy men may shed
a sentimental tear for the old bell
hop's uniform but this writer feels
sure that enlisted navy men will
heave a general sigh of relief when
it is universally replaced.
