## 
### GEORGE BRUNN 
"This court is now in session!"
Maybe you have never looked at
Stanford as America's 49th state, but
these words will open hearings be
fore the Supreme Court of the State
of Stanford.
No, the Farm has not seceded
from the Union, it's only the legal
eagles resuming their war-inter
rupted tradition of "moot courts."
Bus Accident Appeal
They will stand before judges,
plead their cases, and receive ver
dicts. For simplicity's sake they are
starting with appeal cases, that in
volve only the judges and attorneys,
but they are looking forward to
trials with all the trimmings, in
cluding juries and witnesses.
The court will open its doors Feb
ruary 11 to hear an appeal of a bus
company. A woman injured in a bus
accident had sued the company and
had won a $4,000 award from a low
er court. In its appeal the company
will attempt to prove that it has not
been guilty of negligence.
Murder, It Says
Lucille Athearn, Pauline Davis,
John Nelson, and Russell Mayes—
all third-year law students — will
present the case, with Arthur Men
delson, San Francisco attorney, act
ing as Presiding Justice, aided by
Associate Justices Norman Baldwin
and Dave Robinson.
The following week the court will
hear another appeal, with two at
torneys (both third-year legal
eagles) presenting a criminal case
involving attempted murder.
The best four of the six lawyers
will oppose each other in a final trial
spring quarter. Prizes are tradi
tionally awarded to the winner.
Practically Combat
Plans are also under way for a
series of trials throughout next
quarter with second-year students
officiating.
"Moot Courts" are to law students
what combat training is to the in
fantryman. They simulate, as close
ly as possible, actual conditions, and
are designed to familiarize the stu
dents with court procedure, give
them practice in presenting a case
on their feet, and in organizing a
complete brief.
The defense rests.
