Stanford this week-end draws a |
bye in regular basketball confer- i
ence play, and instead takes on two I
independents. Friday night the Col- j
lege of Pacificers travel over to the j
Farm from Stockton to hook up !
with the locals, and on Saturday j
night the University of San Fran- ,
cisco will vie for high honors in a |
hoop contest on local grounds.
Both opponents ought to be ;
dumped without too much trouble j
by the Cardinal men of the hard- j
wood. While Stanford has yet to |
hit the win column in conference
play, the team has steadily im- i
proved throughout the season, and \
if injuries quit plaguing the team
the season shouldn't end with a zero
in the win side of the P.C.C. ledger.
Neither of this week's opponents
have had spectacular success this
season. The only game C.O.P. shone
in was against U. of Nevada, whom j
they beat, 41-;<9, in an overtime af- !
fair. But the next night, the Keeno- j
Renos came back and promptly set ;
C.O.P. on their heels.
Dons Not Great
As for the Dons of U.S.F. (who ■
are, incidentally, screaming because j
their beloved team name of Dons
has been stolen by those naughty ;
professionals, the Los Angeles foot- j
ball team in the All-American cir
cuit), nothing outstanding can be
said. Coming back to the basketball j
wars after a few years of hiberna
tion, they are in the same type of
vessel that Stanford is in this sea
son, only more so.
These two games will offer good j
competition for Stanford, and
should get them set for their jaunt
to Los Angeles for the next week
end, when they engage U.C.L.A. in
a return engagement in the West
wood pym.
After consulting the ouija board, j
several astronomers, two or three
slide-rule jugglers, and Limited
Larceny MacPhail, spokesman for i
the Horse and Handbook Set, who
also offers advice in the basketball i
picking game, we are able to ex- j
ciusively announce that Stanford
will win by 13 points on Friday, and j
by 8 points on Saturday.
News 'I"rum Philly
In the mailbag the other day was j
a letter from a Stanford enthusiast j
way back in Philadelphia. He was
anxious to hear how athletics arc |
doing on the Farm, and in particu- |
lar, how Everett Dean's basketball
charges are faring this season.
If people on the other side of the
country are interested in how Stan
ford is doing in the sports world
and wish they were here to watch j
the teams compete, there certainly j
is no excuse for students on the J
campus to fail to support the bas- j
ketbail quintet.
Our school was very fortunate in j
being able to line up such a favor
able schedule in which so many !
games arc played at home. This is i
certainly no time for those who ■
clamored loudest for the return of
sports to fail to root for the home j
icam.
Yes—we know that there are a j
lot. of other things to do besides Go
ing to basketball games, especially j
when the team isn't winning. |
Shakespeare's shrew is being given j
the once-over by campus thespians.
there arc a lot of parties to go to,
and I wouldn't miss the concert for j
the world. Some of the more des- |
peratc even remark that they j
should study. (What a perfectly |
wretched >bought.)
Bui despite all these other activi- j
ties, try and squeeze in at least one
game over the week-end. As fel- ;
low-students of the basketball play
ers, yo'.i owe it to them to come over
to the Pavilion and yell your lungs
out. What's the difference if you're
hoarse for the next six months? i
Probably everyone will be happy i

not to hear your cheery little voice
"or a iVhilo.
In the final analysis, sports are
maintained at colleges for the
benefit of the students — ln>th
players and spectators. If players
let the school down, there will he
no team. II the spectaotrs let the
team down, the same could hap
pen.
Don't gel me wrong. I'm not try-

ing to set an alarm going that sports
at Stanford are going to be dropped.
I'm just saying what could happen,
and what has happened at other
:;ehools.
