# Divot Diggers, Pros Play Farm Course
## 
### MARTHA SCHWIMLEY 
Back in the "golden year" of 1928, I
when a game called golf was gaining '
enthusiastic followers every day,
Stanford University decided to join i
the rest of the nation by building a I
golf course. The Administration
never regretted this decision, for on
the Farm's links many Stanford stu

dents became famous golfers.
In 19151 the University acquired an â– 
amateur golf champion, Eddie |
Twiggs, as coach. It was Twiggs j
who coached Lawson Little, Arthur |
Doering, Bud Brownell, and Sandy j
Tatuni into national intercollegiate
championships. It is still Twiggs 1
who, year, is hoping to build the i
Farm's golf squad into another j
championship team.
Digging Divots
A typical day on Stanford's beau
tiful course will find a group of be
ginners from Mrs. Cain's class for
girls wildly digging divots as they
try to cover the first hole in a flat 28
strokes. These girls look up, amazed
and envious, as a ball whizzes by
Ihem and some visitors stride pro-

fcssionally on to the next tec.
The Farm golf course is well
known for its beauty and for its
view of the campus from some of the
holes. The course is also known for
its numerous hazards, traps, and
troublesome creeks. Many a begin
ning golfer has lost his precious pre
war balls in one of those crceks dur
ing the past, few years.
Stanford Links Tough
Eddie Twiggs, who has seen golf
links throughout the nation, stated
that he "had never seen one as
tough" as the Stanford course. In
spite of the difficulty of the Stanford
golf course, people come from all
over the Peninsula to try their luck
on it. Twiggs accepts this fact as
being natural. According to him,
the Farm links are the "best in the
country."
During the war, the number of
players who visited the Farm links
shrank a great deal because of the
lack of transportation facilities. Now,
however, Twiggs staled, the "oldtim
ers" are coming back. It will be six
months, though, before the prewar
number of caddies return.
May Resume Tournaments
Before 1942, Stanford held an an
nual Invitational Golf Tournament.
All the finest champions of Northern
California and those visiting from
the East were invited to enter.
Twiggs hopes to begin this tradition
soon again although no schedule has
been arranged yet.
The Intercollegiate Conference
Tournament was set to be played on
Stanford's course for the first time
in 1942, but was postponed because
of the war. Twiggs' Varsity Squads
have traveled to Washington, Ver
mont, Kentucky, lowa, Illinois, and
Indiana for this tournament. In Ihe
four years from 19.'58 to 1942 the
Farm's team won the intercollegiate
national championship four times.
Good Talent Now
Twiggs announced that when the
war came Stanford had enough golf
talent to win tournaments for the
next three years. He added that he
has good talent again now. Frank
MeCann, who won the championship
in 1942, has returned to campus from
the Air Corps. Several other ex
ceptional golfers have come back to
the Farm.
The Stanford course is managed
by the Board of Athletic Control.
E. W. Van Gorder is superintend
ent of the links.
