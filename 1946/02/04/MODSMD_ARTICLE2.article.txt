Commission Ineffective?
Also at the meeting tomorrow
night, a letter addressed to the UNO
I atomic commission in London wiJl
bo submitted for the group's ap
proval. This letter, drafted by
Charlie Clark, Carol Newton, Jinx
Voegeli, and Arthur Buran, will ex
press the opinion that the commis

ticularly with regard to its inspec
tion powers.
The SAAC was informally started
j last November 28 following an all
j campus forum on the atomic bomb.
I In ensuing weeks the group grew
: rapidly, although it was not able to
i bold public meetings. On January 9,
the Association was unanimously
recognized by Executive Committee
I as an independent unchartered or
• ganization.

tacted every college in California
; and many others throughout Ore
gon, Washington and the rest of the
| nation.
I Plans are now under way for a
; "town-hall" meeting for the discus
sion of atomic control, to be held
some time this quarter.
