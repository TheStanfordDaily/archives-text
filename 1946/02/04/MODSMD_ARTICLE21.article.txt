# Walk-outs in Cellar Mount to New High
## 
### 
Cellar ' walk-outs" have increased this quarter to an extent that has
never before occurred on the Stanford campus, according to B. J. Calfee
student manager. The total sum for the 28 days of winter quarter hit the

$218 mark.
A close checkup on Cellar customers will be enforced,
Miss Calfee said, and any person wVio is caught leavim;
without paying for his check will be subject to the se
verest penalty.
In eight days alone the money lost on unpaid checks
amounted to $60.40. On one day, Jan. 23, $16.41 was ac
countable to walkouts. The situation necessitated a
better system of checking, which will be carried out by
Cellar employees from now on.
The majority of walkouts occurred during the be
tween-meal periods in the morning and afternoon, when
the counter trade is heaviest.

LITTLE DISHONESTIES—A BIG DISHONOR
(Editorial)
When you find a disregard for honesty and citizens' responsi
bilities such as the latest reports of Cellar walkouts indicate, you
wonder how the offenders have justified themselves for their
; actions.
Did they forget that the Fundamental Standard applies to
all phases of campus life . . .that in our A.S.S.U. Constitution
the standard states that failure to show respect for order, moral
ity, personal honor, and the rights of others is "sufficient cause
for removal from the University"?
Did they forget that the Fundamental Standard also says that
"Business integrity shall be reguired in the fulfillment of agree
ments "and in the prompt payment of bills by individuals . . ."?
Perhaps, in the best laugh-it-off manner, they forgot that when
small dishonesties grow so numerous that a policing system is
reguired in that midmorning haven, the Cellar, all Stanford stu
dents become dangerously close to the point where we shall
have to relinguish pride in our reputation for honor and relia
bility.
This is the time to stop laughing, and consider.
