# The 						UNO—Just An Infant?
## 
### 
V/e're tired of the newspaper columnists
and the "opinion" magazine writers who in
sist upon referring to the UNO as "the town
mealing of the world" or as "a baby taking
its first steps."
These labels • for the organization may
seem apt, at present, but they certainly do
not take into consideration the fact that upon
the UNO rests all hope of permanent peace
and eventual establishment of world govern
ment.
Some columnists fondly allude to the As
sembly and the Security Council as proto
types of a town meeting, as if it should be
reassuring to note that procedures thus far
have assumed the characteristics of a gath
ering of tov/nspeople where much is dis
cussed, names are called, but few conclu
sions are reached and no action is taken.
The idea that UNO is in its infancy—and
must be pampered, indulged, and seldom
called to account for ineffectuality—is also
dangerous. We played around with that one
before, in terms of the League of Nations,
and it is time that we recognize that the ma
chinery we set up for peace must be used,
and afforded opportunity for growth, rather
than "sheltered" from the impact of the
vital and touchy issues which it should be
considering.
With this in mind, it is disturbing to note
that at the first demand for action, the United
Nations Security Council backed down. Last
weak Iran's chief delegate, S. H. Taquizadeh,
a.%i' \d that the UNO investigate "a number of
interventions in Iranian affairs by Soviet au
thorities." He did so under the Charter rul
ing (which the United States fought for at
San Francisco) that permits any nation to
bring such a subject up for discussion.
Taquizadeh claimed that Russia is foment

ing revolution in Iran; Andrei Vishinsky,
the Soviet Vice Commissar of Foreign Af
fairs, countered by saying that Iran's charges
had been "raised by a government no longer
in power," a statement from which we may
draw the conclusion that Russia has no
qualms against discounting Taquidez' gov
ernment, if not openly kindling revolution
against it.
What lends even more seriousness to the
problem is the fact that armaments and
troops are involved: Iran claimed that the
U.S.S.R. should have removed her troops six
months after the end of the European war,
while the Soviet charged that her troops
should remain in Iran until March 2, six
months after the war with Japan was won.
Within two days after the dispute had been
placed upon its docket, the UNO bowed to
the demand of Vishinsky, removed the So
viet-Iranian discussion from its formal agen
da, and referred it back to the two parties
for direct negatiotions. It is our contention
that Russia, perhaps unwittingly, made a
grave mistake in forcing through this recom
mendation, and that the Security Council
made an even graver one in not accepting
full responsibility for this first small-nation
vs. large-nation dispute. The final decision
could not have inspired much confidence
from nations net included in the Big Three
category, who hoped to find the UNO a
willing mediator.
So with these developments in mind, it
seems indeed pitiful that certain members
of the press should continue to act as if
"everything's great: our baby UNO is just
learning to walk," when they should be
working to make clear how imperative it is
that UNO does not toddle, but takes imme
diate strides towards real world leadership.

vital and touchy issues which it should be
considering.
With this in mind, it is disturbing to note
that at the first demand for action, the United
Nations Security Council backed down. Last
weak Iran's chief delegate, S. H. Taquizadeh,
a.%i' \d that the UNO investigate "a number of
interventions in Iranian affairs by Soviet au
thorities." He did so under the Charter rul
ing (which the United States fought for at
San Francisco) that permits any nation to
bring such a subject up for discussion.
Taquizadeh claimed that Russia is foment

ing revolution in Iran; Andrei Vishinsky,
the Soviet Vice Commissar of Foreign Af
fairs, countered by saying that Iran's charges
had been "raised by a government no longer
in power," a statement from which we may
draw the conclusion that Russia has no
qualms against discounting Taquidez' gov
ernment, if not openly kindling revolution
against it.
What lends even more seriousness to the
problem is the fact that armaments and
troops are involved: Iran claimed that the
U.S.S.R. should have removed her troops six
months after the end of the European war,
while the Soviet charged that her troops
should remain in Iran until March 2, six
months after the war with Japan was won.
Within two days after the dispute had been
placed upon its docket, the UNO bowed to
the demand of Vishinsky, removed the So
viet-Iranian discussion from its formal agen
da, and referred it back to the two parties
for direct negatiotions. It is our contention
that Russia, perhaps unwittingly, made a
grave mistake in forcing through this recom
mendation, and that the Security Council
made an even graver one in not accepting
full responsibility for this first small-nation
vs. large-nation dispute. The final decision
could not have inspired much confidence
from nations net included in the Big Three
category, who hoped to find the UNO a
willing mediator.
So with these developments in mind, it
seems indeed pitiful that certain members
of the press should continue to act as if
"everything's great: our baby UNO is just
learning to walk," when they should be
working to make clear how imperative it is
that UNO does not toddle, but takes imme
diate strides towards real world leadership.
V/e're tired of the newspaper columnists
and the "opinion" magazine writers who in
sist upon referring to the UNO as "the town
mealing of the world" or as "a baby taking
its first steps."
These labels • for the organization may
seem apt, at present, but they certainly do
not take into consideration the fact that upon
the UNO rests all hope of permanent peace
and eventual establishment of world govern
ment.
Some columnists fondly allude to the As
sembly and the Security Council as proto
types of a town meeting, as if it should be
reassuring to note that procedures thus far
have assumed the characteristics of a gath
ering of tov/nspeople where much is dis
cussed, names are called, but few conclu
sions are reached and no action is taken.
The idea that UNO is in its infancy—and
must be pampered, indulged, and seldom
called to account for ineffectuality—is also
dangerous. We played around with that one
before, in terms of the League of Nations,
and it is time that we recognize that the ma
chinery we set up for peace must be used,
and afforded opportunity for growth, rather
than "sheltered" from the impact of the
vital and touchy issues which it should be
considering.
