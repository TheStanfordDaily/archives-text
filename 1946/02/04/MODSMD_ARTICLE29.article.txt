So that Stanford students may know the
requirements for the officers to be elected
February 20, the Daily will run stories
throughout this week outlining the duties al
lotted to position holders on Women's Coun
cil, Men's Council, as vice-chairman of
Women's Conference and head or assistant
yell-leader. Inserted in the stories will be
quotations from students experienced in
these positions, list the qualifications neces
sary to them. Day-by-day resumes the fol
lowing week will inform Stanford citizens
as to who has announced his intention to
run by turning in a petition to Election Com
mittee.
These stories are being published as a
service to the students, in the belief that
knowledge of the offices and the persons
contending for them is more important than
pre-election "let's-all-vote" ballyhoo for The
Uninformed. We hope that persons who de
sire to become office-holders will only run
if they are qualified and genuinely interested
in serving in these positions. We hope that
students who recognize in others the ability

to fulfill well the required duties will take it
upon themselves to circulate petitions for
them. And in the week before elections, we
hope that readers will take more than a
passive interest in who is running; that they
will make it their individual responsibility
to fill out the ballot with candidates wisely
selected.
The success or failure of the self-govern
ment accorded to the student body by fac
ulty and administration springs upward from
a hierarchy of nominators and nominees, of
winners and of voters. Reiteration of elec
tion schedules and unfilled ballots to the
Stanford community in general through Daily
news stories alone cannot bring home at all
clearly the responsibility of the individual
student to the election system. First he must
understand the philosophy prompting them:
upon each student rests the obligation to
nominate and vote for, with intelligence and
a knowledge of the candidates and their
place in the governmental machinery, the
leaders of government and the policy-mak
ers of the ASSU.—BMV
