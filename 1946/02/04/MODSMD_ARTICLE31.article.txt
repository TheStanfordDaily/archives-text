SHE LOVES HER VITAMINS

To the Editor:
Hurrah, hurrah! At last someone has got
ten up courage to say what has long needed
expression. I refer to the Jan. 21 editorial
"Scuttlebutt" which I read with great pleas
ure while eating my late breakfast of "watery
orange juice, dry toast, and warmed-over
coffee."

Breakfast is the most important meal of the
day, and any dietician would agree that
cereal is essential to a diet. Board of $123 is
not hay and it should be enough to provide
horse fodder (Oh, but I love my vitamins!)
for us poor late breakfasters.
Actions still speak louder than words!
