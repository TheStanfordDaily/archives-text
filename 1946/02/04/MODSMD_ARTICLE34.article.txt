# What Makes Roble Run? Many Wonder, Few Know; Here's the Inside Story
## 
### JEAN BURNET 
Even the 255 giris who live in
Roble ITall don't know the inner |
workings of the huge monster in (
which they live. Not many girls !
have .stopped to count the 31 hath
tubs or the 11 telephones; and, al- j
though some have asked, "What's I
under A wing?" few of them know !
that seven or eight women who 1
work in the kitchen live there.
A similar question is often asked
by the inhabitants of C wing as '
they trudge along the connecting j
corridor commonly called "Tresid- j
der's Hike," and most of them are |
disappointed to find that there is no j
basement under that wing.
Mysterious Kitchen
To most girjs the "kitchen is a I
wonderful and mysterious thing. |
Wonderful because it turns out
those delicious Wednesday and
Sunday night dinners, and myste

, rious because they sometimes won- i
I der exactly what they are eating. |
Few food - gulpers stop to think i
| about who cooks the food and who j
! washes the dishes; their chief worry j
is drinking that last drop of coffee
before the hasher snatches the cup
j away.
If a Roble-dweller took a tour
through the kitchen, she'd probably
be surprised to find that there is a
chief cook and his assistant, a spe-
I rial salad-maker and her helper,
besides a jjotwasher and a porter.
Seven Maidens
"Someone must riave cleaned my !
room —I can't write my name in the
[ dust on the floor any more!" Yes,
| there are seven maids who clean the
halls, the lobby, and wash the rings
I out of the bathtubs—all 31 of them
—besides cleaning the girls' rooms
as often as possible. These maids
have no rest between quarters, ei

ther, beeouse that's the time of
housecleaning and repairing at Ro
ble. The hundreds of glass curtains
are cleaned at least once a year, too.
The basement under B wing is
well known for its popular Hole and
clubroom, but the laundry room,
equipped with its washtubs, steam
driers, hair - washing basins, and
hair drier, isn't neglected by any
means. Clean-minded girls can be
seen struggling with their laundry
in the hard suds-less water, wash
ing their hair, or ironing at almost
all hours of the day and night.
One of the most popular spots of
the Hall is the sun-dock which
overlooks the lake. The sun-bath
ing season ends late and begins
early for the sun-suit set. The
sun-deck adjoins a pleasant, quiet
room with not so pleasant a conno
tation, the library. When a girl's
roommate gathers some of her pals
I together for a bridge panic and
plays Harry James' records on the
phonograph, she can seek refuge
in the libe to study for that bio
test.

There are few girls who don't
, know the nurse, the hall director,
112 and her assistant personally, and
there are many Stanford roughs
! who are aware, to say the least, of
i the night assistant. Parents have
j turned over their puzling offspring
to these four women, who find it a
full-time night and day job. A
voice well known to the campus is
that of the switchboard operator
who pushes buttons which produce
| buzzes upstairs which in turn pro
! duce feminine squeals of anticipa-
I iion.
The casual glance of the visitor
' sees only the comfortable furniture
I in the main lobby and the two
j smaller ones, or perhaps the pan-
I eled walls of the dining rooms, and
he probably doesn't realize the
work involved in smoothly co-ordi
nating the sprawling ivy - covered
building known as Roble Hall.

Mysterious Kitchen
To most girjs the "kitchen is a I
wonderful and mysterious thing. |
Wonderful because it turns out
those delicious Wednesday and
Sunday night dinners, and myste

, rious because they sometimes won- i
I der exactly what they are eating. |
Few food - gulpers stop to think i
| about who cooks the food and who j
! washes the dishes; their chief worry j
is drinking that last drop of coffee
before the hasher snatches the cup
j away.
If a Roble-dweller took a tour
through the kitchen, she'd probably
be surprised to find that there is a
chief cook and his assistant, a spe-
I rial salad-maker and her helper,
besides a jjotwasher and a porter.
Seven Maidens
"Someone must riave cleaned my !
room —I can't write my name in the
[ dust on the floor any more!" Yes,
| there are seven maids who clean the
halls, the lobby, and wash the rings
I out of the bathtubs—all 31 of them
—besides cleaning the girls' rooms
as often as possible. These maids
have no rest between quarters, ei

ther, beeouse that's the time of
housecleaning and repairing at Ro
ble. The hundreds of glass curtains
are cleaned at least once a year, too.
The basement under B wing is
well known for its popular Hole and
clubroom, but the laundry room,
equipped with its washtubs, steam
driers, hair - washing basins, and
hair drier, isn't neglected by any
means. Clean-minded girls can be
seen struggling with their laundry
in the hard suds-less water, wash
ing their hair, or ironing at almost
all hours of the day and night.
One of the most popular spots of
the Hall is the sun-dock which
overlooks the lake. The sun-bath
ing season ends late and begins
early for the sun-suit set. The
sun-deck adjoins a pleasant, quiet
room with not so pleasant a conno
tation, the library. When a girl's
roommate gathers some of her pals
I together for a bridge panic and
plays Harry James' records on the
phonograph, she can seek refuge
in the libe to study for that bio
test.

There are few girls who don't
, know the nurse, the hall director,
112 and her assistant personally, and
there are many Stanford roughs
! who are aware, to say the least, of
i the night assistant. Parents have
j turned over their puzling offspring
to these four women, who find it a
full-time night and day job. A
voice well known to the campus is
that of the switchboard operator
who pushes buttons which produce
| buzzes upstairs which in turn pro
! duce feminine squeals of anticipa-
I iion.
The casual glance of the visitor
' sees only the comfortable furniture
I in the main lobby and the two
j smaller ones, or perhaps the pan-
I eled walls of the dining rooms, and
he probably doesn't realize the
work involved in smoothly co-ordi
nating the sprawling ivy - covered
building known as Roble Hall.
Even the 255 giris who live in
Roble ITall don't know the inner |
workings of the huge monster in (
which they live. Not many girls !
have .stopped to count the 31 hath
tubs or the 11 telephones; and, al- j
though some have asked, "What's I
under A wing?" few of them know !
that seven or eight women who 1
work in the kitchen live there.
A similar question is often asked
by the inhabitants of C wing as '
they trudge along the connecting j
corridor commonly called "Tresid- j
der's Hike," and most of them are |
disappointed to find that there is no j
basement under that wing.
