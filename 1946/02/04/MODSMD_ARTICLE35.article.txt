# 'The Long Voyage Home' Interprets Grim Actions
## 
### 
It is this reviewer's sincere hope
that you were fortunate enough to
see "The Long Voyage Home,*'
which ended its run last Saturday
at the Varsity. For this adaptation
of four of Eugene O'Neill's plays of
the sea will always mark one of the
milestones in motion picture his
tory. Few pictures have evoked so
much comment; very few pictures
will ever give such a thoughtful in
terpretation to the actions of a
group of grim, serious people as
they battle the equally earnest ele
ments of nature.
It is the men of "The Long Voyage
Home" that give the story its in
tense character, the men who drift
from one rusty tramp steamer to
another and from one unfriendly
land to the next. Each of these men
in forsaking the land has tried to
leave with him his bundle of mem
ories. Some have been successful
in severing all ties; others live in a
world of remembrance and longing.
Academy-Award Direction
Under the Academy-A ward direc
tion of John Ford. "The Long Voy
age Home" gives most of its cast
'heir greatest acting opportunities.
Thomas Mitchell as the bull-head
ed, irresponsible Drisc; John Wayne
as the giant Swede, Olie; lan Hun
ter as the obsessed Smitty; Barry
Fitzgerald in his first major role;

j each of them presents a well-de
f fined characterization that you will
| long remember.
The settings, even though they be
in dismal surroundings, are memor
able: the dingy forecastle of an ob
solete tramp steamer; a low English
bar with its doped drinks and the
women who live upstairs; and a de
serted waterfront at dawn with a
; melancholy accordion playing "Har
bor Lights" as one or two seamen
i straggle back from their last night
i on shore. This is the stuff of which
"The Long Voyage Home" is made,
i "Powerful Story"
"Perhaps this picture was dis
i tasteful to you; maybe you thought
it was too arty; but in any event
i you will have been witness to a
S powerful story of the never-chang
| ing sea and its men, some of whom
j come and go, some of whom live and
die, and others for whom the Long
: Voyage never ends.
Current attraction at the Varsity
; is the rowdy comedy of college life,
j "The Male Animal," full of pretty
coeds, ex - football players, and
1 party-time. Also showing is "Fly
ing Down to Rio," the first Fred As
j taire-Ginger Rogers musical that
was made long before this reviewer
j was even knee high to a bar stool.â€”
