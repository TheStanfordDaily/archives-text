### 
NEW YORK. Feb. 3 (UP).—Navy
stood tonight as the lone major un
defeated college basketball team,
but the Middies still were not re
garded as probable national cham
pions as lofig as lowa, Oklahoma A.
& M., Notre Dame. Kentucky, New
York University and Indiana main
tain their impressive—if imperfect—
pace.
Navy's 62 to 41 victory over Co
lumbia Saturday was the seventh
straight for Annapolis, but their
comparatively few games, plus the
fact that not all those wins came
over high-grade opposition, vkept
the Middies from achieving pre
eminence.
lowa bounded back into cham
pionship contention with an easy
08 to 36 conquest of helpless Chi
cago, usually known as king of the
Big Ten underground because of
long monopoly of the Cellar. The
Hawkeyes now lead the Western
Conference with a six-won-and
one-lost mark, with Indiana idle
last week-end, in second place with
a six and two record.
Indiana holds the only victory
Scored this soason over lowa, and
itself has lost only to Minnesota and
Purdue.
Minnesota, for a while favored to
supplant lowa as Big Ten champ,
took an amazing 65 to 40 shellack
ing from Purdue and dropped to
fourth place in the Big Ten.
Notre Dame sufTered its fust loss
in 14 games last Saturday, falling
before Northwestern at Chicago, 56
to 55.
