# SIDELINE SLANTS
## 
### ART LEVINSON Daily Sports Editor 
This slants marks number one in ;
J series No. 109. After checking |
: through Daily files, we find that j
j Sideline Slants goes back a long
way. Back to 1932, to be exact. Not
; one for radical moves, this writer
| can see no valid reason for now giv
; ing up the good name of Sideline
j Slants as a column title.
First sports editor to turn out !
slants copy was Millard Brown.
Through the years the column has
j been in most capable mittens. This
; writer will do his best to keep up
I the good record that Slants has
1 made through the years.
Score Point Difference
For two Saturdays in a row there
I has been a discrepancy between the
men who kept the score at the bas
! ketball games in the local Pavilion.
A week ago, when USC was making
its presence known in this here ter
ritory, the official score book read,
when the final gun blew, 55-40. Be
fore the scribes sent their stories to
the city papers, they took a look at
! the official scorebook, and raised a
j howl, when they noticed a differ
i ence.
Harry Borba, who writes for the
j Examiner—and was editor of the
Daily back in '22—compared his
book with the official one, and found
that he chalked up one free throw
for Tom Hood in the second half,
which made his score read, 55-41.
Smiley Farkas, who is Farm corre
! spondent for the Chronicle, also
! shrieked out when he saw what the
official book read. Side glancing at
Borba's book, he also noticed that
the disputed free throw Tom Hood
made—or didn't make—was the is-
I sue at stake.
Licbendorfer Disagrees
Then down trotted Don Licben
dorfer, Stanford's director of pub
licity, to check the score with his
own editing, before he went on the
radio to report statistics to radio
listeners of the game. The free i
1 throw dispute now read three-to- J

one, with the official scorer tagging
behind.
Over on the other side of the Pa
vilion, the Daily correspondent was
innocently keeping score, and also
reached the total of 41 for Stanford,
which made the decision pretty un
animous, but in a basketball game,
it's the official score book t hat
counts, not the sideline point chalk
ers. What were the sports writers
going to do? One point might spell
the difference between a job. Tak
ing the situation into their own
hands, they—in unison—decided to
send in their stories with the score
of 55-41, completely snubbing the
head scoreman.
Now all of this might sound a lit
tle silly. All this fuss over one small
point. If the game had been real
close, it might mean the difference
between victory and defeat, but
what the heck, a 14 or 15-point mar
gin doesn't amount to anything. Or
does it?
The Bookies Called It Close
Monday morning a lot of phone
calls began pouring in to Don Lie
bendorfer's office at the B.A.C. want
ing to know what the real score of
the game was. Liebendorfer, who
is a plenty sharp fellow, began to
wonder what the devil was coming
off. Why were all these people try
ing to find out the score? Then the
story began coming in bit by bit.
The assembled version goes some
thing like this. Gentlemen in the
city who earn their livelihood by
engaging in curbstone betting, or in
the more gutteral vernacular, oper
ate bookies (yes, we know that they
are illegal) had given 14Vfe points on
the game. So you can see why all
the phone calling took place. When
it begins to hit the pocketbook, peo
ple begin checking the records.
Another Episode
That was the little story on the
game a week ago. Now for the story
this last Saturday night, which is al
most an exact replica of last week's
proceedings. When the gun went
off ending the game, all the sports
scribes—the same ones as the pre
vious Saturday p.m.—plus Don Lie
bendorfer had the following total
written in their score books: 49-39.
Making the routine check with the
official scorer, once again a dispute
arose. The official book read, 50-39.
This time the argued point concerned
Peters, a USF performer. The head
scoreman apparently saw Peters
score a free point during the game
which no one else saw. This time
the press men decided to take it
easy and sent their stories in read
ing, 50-39, but really knowing that
was the wrong score.
It doesn't make a lot of difference
on point, as was previously men
tioned, but still it's nice to have ev
erybody agree on the score. On both
occasions, as it appears from this
corner, the official scorer wasn't
quite official enough in his tabulat
ing. . . . Positutely and absitevely.

men who kept the score at the bas
! ketball games in the local Pavilion.
A week ago, when USC was making
its presence known in this here ter
ritory, the official score book read,
when the final gun blew, 55-40. Be
fore the scribes sent their stories to
the city papers, they took a look at
! the official scorebook, and raised a
j howl, when they noticed a differ
i ence.
Harry Borba, who writes for the
j Examiner—and was editor of the
Daily back in '22—compared his
book with the official one, and found
that he chalked up one free throw
for Tom Hood in the second half,
which made his score read, 55-41.
Smiley Farkas, who is Farm corre
! spondent for the Chronicle, also
! shrieked out when he saw what the
official book read. Side glancing at
Borba's book, he also noticed that
the disputed free throw Tom Hood
made—or didn't make—was the is-
I sue at stake.
Licbendorfer Disagrees
Then down trotted Don Licben
dorfer, Stanford's director of pub
licity, to check the score with his
own editing, before he went on the
radio to report statistics to radio
listeners of the game. The free i
1 throw dispute now read three-to- J

one, with the official scorer tagging
behind.
Over on the other side of the Pa
vilion, the Daily correspondent was
innocently keeping score, and also
reached the total of 41 for Stanford,
which made the decision pretty un
animous, but in a basketball game,
it's the official score book t hat
counts, not the sideline point chalk
ers. What were the sports writers
going to do? One point might spell
the difference between a job. Tak
ing the situation into their own
hands, they—in unison—decided to
send in their stories with the score
of 55-41, completely snubbing the
head scoreman.
Now all of this might sound a lit
tle silly. All this fuss over one small
point. If the game had been real
close, it might mean the difference
between victory and defeat, but
what the heck, a 14 or 15-point mar
gin doesn't amount to anything. Or
does it?
The Bookies Called It Close
Monday morning a lot of phone
calls began pouring in to Don Lie
bendorfer's office at the B.A.C. want
ing to know what the real score of
the game was. Liebendorfer, who
is a plenty sharp fellow, began to
wonder what the devil was coming
off. Why were all these people try
ing to find out the score? Then the
story began coming in bit by bit.
The assembled version goes some
thing like this. Gentlemen in the
city who earn their livelihood by
engaging in curbstone betting, or in
the more gutteral vernacular, oper
ate bookies (yes, we know that they
are illegal) had given 14Vfe points on
the game. So you can see why all
the phone calling took place. When
it begins to hit the pocketbook, peo
ple begin checking the records.
Another Episode
That was the little story on the
game a week ago. Now for the story
this last Saturday night, which is al
most an exact replica of last week's
proceedings. When the gun went
off ending the game, all the sports
scribes—the same ones as the pre
vious Saturday p.m.—plus Don Lie
bendorfer had the following total
written in their score books: 49-39.
Making the routine check with the
official scorer, once again a dispute
arose. The official book read, 50-39.
This time the argued point concerned
Peters, a USF performer. The head
scoreman apparently saw Peters
score a free point during the game
which no one else saw. This time
the press men decided to take it
easy and sent their stories in read
ing, 50-39, but really knowing that
was the wrong score.
It doesn't make a lot of difference
on point, as was previously men
tioned, but still it's nice to have ev
erybody agree on the score. On both
occasions, as it appears from this
corner, the official scorer wasn't
quite official enough in his tabulat
ing. . . . Positutely and absitevely.
This slants marks number one in ;
J series No. 109. After checking |
: through Daily files, we find that j
j Sideline Slants goes back a long
way. Back to 1932, to be exact. Not
; one for radical moves, this writer
| can see no valid reason for now giv
; ing up the good name of Sideline
j Slants as a column title.
First sports editor to turn out !
slants copy was Millard Brown.
Through the years the column has
j been in most capable mittens. This
; writer will do his best to keep up
I the good record that Slants has
1 made through the years.

Smiley Farkas, who is Farm corre
! spondent for the Chronicle, also
! shrieked out when he saw what the
official book read. Side glancing at
Borba's book, he also noticed that
the disputed free throw Tom Hood
made—or didn't make—was the is-
I sue at stake.
Licbendorfer Disagrees
Then down trotted Don Licben
dorfer, Stanford's director of pub
licity, to check the score with his
own editing, before he went on the
radio to report statistics to radio
listeners of the game. The free i
1 throw dispute now read three-to- J

one, with the official scorer tagging
behind.
Over on the other side of the Pa
vilion, the Daily correspondent was
innocently keeping score, and also
reached the total of 41 for Stanford,
which made the decision pretty un
animous, but in a basketball game,
it's the official score book t hat
counts, not the sideline point chalk
ers. What were the sports writers
going to do? One point might spell
the difference between a job. Tak
ing the situation into their own
hands, they—in unison—decided to
send in their stories with the score
of 55-41, completely snubbing the
head scoreman.
Now all of this might sound a lit
tle silly. All this fuss over one small
point. If the game had been real
close, it might mean the difference
between victory and defeat, but
what the heck, a 14 or 15-point mar
gin doesn't amount to anything. Or
does it?
The Bookies Called It Close
Monday morning a lot of phone
calls began pouring in to Don Lie
bendorfer's office at the B.A.C. want
ing to know what the real score of
the game was. Liebendorfer, who
is a plenty sharp fellow, began to
wonder what the devil was coming
off. Why were all these people try
ing to find out the score? Then the
story began coming in bit by bit.
The assembled version goes some
thing like this. Gentlemen in the
city who earn their livelihood by
engaging in curbstone betting, or in
the more gutteral vernacular, oper
ate bookies (yes, we know that they
are illegal) had given 14Vfe points on
the game. So you can see why all
the phone calling took place. When
it begins to hit the pocketbook, peo
ple begin checking the records.
Another Episode
That was the little story on the
game a week ago. Now for the story
this last Saturday night, which is al
most an exact replica of last week's
proceedings. When the gun went
off ending the game, all the sports
scribes—the same ones as the pre
vious Saturday p.m.—plus Don Lie
bendorfer had the following total
written in their score books: 49-39.
Making the routine check with the
official scorer, once again a dispute
arose. The official book read, 50-39.
This time the argued point concerned
Peters, a USF performer. The head
scoreman apparently saw Peters
score a free point during the game
which no one else saw. This time
the press men decided to take it
easy and sent their stories in read
ing, 50-39, but really knowing that
was the wrong score.
It doesn't make a lot of difference
on point, as was previously men
tioned, but still it's nice to have ev
erybody agree on the score. On both
occasions, as it appears from this
corner, the official scorer wasn't
quite official enough in his tabulat
ing. . . . Positutely and absitevely.
This slants marks number one in ;
J series No. 109. After checking |
: through Daily files, we find that j
j Sideline Slants goes back a long
way. Back to 1932, to be exact. Not
; one for radical moves, this writer
| can see no valid reason for now giv
; ing up the good name of Sideline
j Slants as a column title.
First sports editor to turn out !
slants copy was Millard Brown.
Through the years the column has
j been in most capable mittens. This
; writer will do his best to keep up
I the good record that Slants has
1 made through the years.
Score Point Difference
For two Saturdays in a row there
I has been a discrepancy between the
men who kept the score at the bas
! ketball games in the local Pavilion.
A week ago, when USC was making
its presence known in this here ter
ritory, the official score book read,
when the final gun blew, 55-40. Be
fore the scribes sent their stories to
the city papers, they took a look at
! the official scorebook, and raised a
j howl, when they noticed a differ
i ence.
Harry Borba, who writes for the
j Examiner—and was editor of the
Daily back in '22—compared his
book with the official one, and found
that he chalked up one free throw
for Tom Hood in the second half,
which made his score read, 55-41.
