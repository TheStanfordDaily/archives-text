## 
### 
The Indian varsity basketball
squad split a couple of games with
non-conference opponents last week
end. On Friday night they staved
off a late rally by the College of
Pacific Tigers to win, 34-32, but on
Saturday they fell before the Uni
versity of San Francisco, 49-39.
The Cards opened against the
Tigers as two- or three-point fav
vorites, hilt found themselves he
hind 4-0 on baskets by forward
Jerry Haines. However, with
Gene Martin, Bill Christiansen,
and Tom Rodman hitting the
hemp consistently, Stanford rolled
lip IS points while holding the Ti
gers to a mere field goal to take
an IX-() lead.
At this point the shorter Bengals
began to hit their long shots, and
pulled up to a half-time margin of
18-15.
Haines cut the score to 18-17 at
the start of the second half, but the
Big Red pull?d away again until
they thought they had a fairly safe
26-18 lead. Tom Murphy sank a
field goal, and followed it up with
the first Stanford free throw of the
game to give the Indians a 31-22
lead.
Tigers Get Going
At this point the Tigers really
warmed up, and with little Frank
Burkett leading the way they near
ly pulled the game out of the fire.
Bill Christiansen led the Stanford
scorers for the night with 9 points:
He was followed by Rodman with 8,
and Martin with 6. Haines led the
Tigers with 11 points, followed
closely by Burkett with 9.
Second Game
Pre-game dope on the Saturday
night game gave the Dons a slight

advantage. After almost 10 minutes
of play the score was deadlocked at
4-4. However, after that the scor
ing came fast and furiously.
The Dons' big center, Hal Bev
eridge. hit nine quick points, and
San Francisco led, 16-9. At this
point the Stanford forward, Gene
Martin, went on a scoring rampage
that netted him 10 straight points
and gave the Indians a 20-16 lead.
At halftime the Cardinals led, 22-19.
Indians Lead
In the second lead Martin and
Tom Hood hit the basket to in
crease the lead to 27-20, but from
that point on the game was entirely
dominated by the Dons. U.S.F. look
the lead at 31-29. but Stanford
forged back into the lead for the
last time, 34-33.
Forward Don Giesen poured in 14
points in the second half, to lead the
Dons. After Tom Murphy left the
game and Martin was forced out on
fouls, the big city boys began to
pile up the score. In the last seven
minutes of play the Dons took near
ly every rebound.
The one bright spot for Stan
ford was the work of Gene Mar
with 17 points, 12 of which came
in the first half. Of his nine foul
shots he made good seven for an
excellent average.

The Indian varsity basketball
squad split a couple of games with
non-conference opponents last week
end. On Friday night they staved
off a late rally by the College of
Pacific Tigers to win, 34-32, but on
Saturday they fell before the Uni
versity of San Francisco, 49-39.
The Cards opened against the
Tigers as two- or three-point fav
vorites, hilt found themselves he
hind 4-0 on baskets by forward
Jerry Haines. However, with
Gene Martin, Bill Christiansen,
and Tom Rodman hitting the
hemp consistently, Stanford rolled
lip IS points while holding the Ti
gers to a mere field goal to take
an IX-() lead.
At this point the shorter Bengals
began to hit their long shots, and
pulled up to a half-time margin of
18-15.
Haines cut the score to 18-17 at
the start of the second half, but the
Big Red pull?d away again until
they thought they had a fairly safe
26-18 lead. Tom Murphy sank a
field goal, and followed it up with
the first Stanford free throw of the
game to give the Indians a 31-22
lead.
Tigers Get Going
At this point the Tigers really
warmed up, and with little Frank
Burkett leading the way they near
ly pulled the game out of the fire.
Bill Christiansen led the Stanford
scorers for the night with 9 points:
He was followed by Rodman with 8,
and Martin with 6. Haines led the
Tigers with 11 points, followed
closely by Burkett with 9.
Second Game
Pre-game dope on the Saturday
night game gave the Dons a slight

advantage. After almost 10 minutes
of play the score was deadlocked at
4-4. However, after that the scor
ing came fast and furiously.
The Dons' big center, Hal Bev
eridge. hit nine quick points, and
San Francisco led, 16-9. At this
point the Stanford forward, Gene
Martin, went on a scoring rampage
that netted him 10 straight points
and gave the Indians a 20-16 lead.
At halftime the Cardinals led, 22-19.
Indians Lead
In the second lead Martin and
Tom Hood hit the basket to in
crease the lead to 27-20, but from
that point on the game was entirely
dominated by the Dons. U.S.F. look
the lead at 31-29. but Stanford
forged back into the lead for the
last time, 34-33.
Forward Don Giesen poured in 14
points in the second half, to lead the
Dons. After Tom Murphy left the
game and Martin was forced out on
fouls, the big city boys began to
pile up the score. In the last seven
minutes of play the Dons took near
ly every rebound.
The one bright spot for Stan
ford was the work of Gene Mar
with 17 points, 12 of which came
in the first half. Of his nine foul
shots he made good seven for an
excellent average.

The Indian varsity basketball
squad split a couple of games with
non-conference opponents last week
end. On Friday night they staved
off a late rally by the College of
Pacific Tigers to win, 34-32, but on
Saturday they fell before the Uni
versity of San Francisco, 49-39.
The Cards opened against the
Tigers as two- or three-point fav
vorites, hilt found themselves he
hind 4-0 on baskets by forward
Jerry Haines. However, with
Gene Martin, Bill Christiansen,
and Tom Rodman hitting the
hemp consistently, Stanford rolled
lip IS points while holding the Ti
gers to a mere field goal to take
an IX-() lead.
At this point the shorter Bengals
began to hit their long shots, and
pulled up to a half-time margin of
18-15.
Haines cut the score to 18-17 at
the start of the second half, but the
Big Red pull?d away again until
they thought they had a fairly safe
26-18 lead. Tom Murphy sank a
field goal, and followed it up with
the first Stanford free throw of the
game to give the Indians a 31-22
lead.
Tigers Get Going
At this point the Tigers really
warmed up, and with little Frank
Burkett leading the way they near
ly pulled the game out of the fire.
Bill Christiansen led the Stanford
scorers for the night with 9 points:
He was followed by Rodman with 8,
and Martin with 6. Haines led the
Tigers with 11 points, followed
closely by Burkett with 9.
Second Game
Pre-game dope on the Saturday
night game gave the Dons a slight

advantage. After almost 10 minutes
of play the score was deadlocked at
4-4. However, after that the scor
ing came fast and furiously.
The Dons' big center, Hal Bev
eridge. hit nine quick points, and
San Francisco led, 16-9. At this
point the Stanford forward, Gene
Martin, went on a scoring rampage
that netted him 10 straight points
and gave the Indians a 20-16 lead.
At halftime the Cardinals led, 22-19.
Indians Lead
In the second lead Martin and
Tom Hood hit the basket to in
crease the lead to 27-20, but from
that point on the game was entirely
dominated by the Dons. U.S.F. look
the lead at 31-29. but Stanford
forged back into the lead for the
last time, 34-33.
Forward Don Giesen poured in 14
points in the second half, to lead the
Dons. After Tom Murphy left the
game and Martin was forced out on
fouls, the big city boys began to
pile up the score. In the last seven
minutes of play the Dons took near
ly every rebound.
The one bright spot for Stan
ford was the work of Gene Mar
with 17 points, 12 of which came
in the first half. Of his nine foul
shots he made good seven for an
excellent average.
