"The fellows on the ski team now
have enough interest so that we'll
have the best team in the West next
year," Captain Raleigh Andrews of
the ski team says.
Bob Fisher, an Eastern skier who
did some of his undergraduate work
at Williams, will join the ski team
next year, and Bobby Blatt and
Boots Blatt will be back to bolster
the squad.
The Blatt brothers were Stanford
ski stars before the war and Bobby
has long been recognized as one of
the finest collegiate skiers ever seen
in the West.
Skiing is not yet recognized as a
minor sport at Stanford. All the
activities of the ski team are un
der the direction of the Ski Club
and are "done by their spontaneous
enthusiasm," Andrews said.
As to this year's team, many of
the fellows have shown outstand
ing promise, Andrews added.
"Curt Lindley, Dick Williams, and
Jerry Rosenthal are beginning to
show a great deal of promise and
have a lot of enthusiasm," Andrews
said.
Also on the team is Ted Holcomb,
who was on the ski team at Stan
ford before, and Bob Elliott who
