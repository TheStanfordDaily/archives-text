# Student Tells of Escape From Germans in Poland
## 
### GLORIA BERNERO 
Alexander Kaminski, a Stanford
student now enrolled in the School
of Physical Sciences, was 13 when
the war broke out in Poland in 1939.
The Russians came in from the
West and his father was taken to a
Soviet concentration camp. During
the next two months of Soviet oc
cupation Alexander and his mother
plotted to leave the country. At
that time the Polish train conduc
tors who had been retained by the
Russians were being considerably
underpaid. It was sometimes pos
sible to buy their help in getting
out of Poland.
Meanwhile the Germans invaded
from the West, and a line of demar
cation was formed between German
and Soviet occupation. In Novem
ber, two months after the Russians
had come into Poland, Alex and his
mother managed to cross over the
line into German - occupied War
saw.
One House Standing
Luckily they had owned some
property there, and according to
Alex, it was a happy moment when

j they found one of their houses still
j standing among the rubble that was
Warsaw, and discovered that his
father had arrived three days be
fore, having left the concentration
camp in an exchange of Russian
and German prisoners.
German - occupied Warsaw was
I not pleasant. Every violation of
j the rules was punishable by death
in any guise. Usually it was by
shooting on sight. One could al
most be condemned for the mere
j act of living.
Schools Closed
Schools were closed and study in
i groups was forbidden. The pos-
I session of arms and radios, the tear-
I ing down of posters which the Ger-
I mans displayed in vast numbers
was punishable by death. Anyone
seen on the streets after 8 at night
was shot on sight. The smuggling
of food and currency was particu
j larly discouraged by the Germans.
! Without it many Poles starved.
| German movies monopolized local
j theaters and were consistently boy
i cotted by the Poles. The only re
| maining recreation was 'hat of con-
I vening in some home, telling sto
j ries (singing was unwise), and
| drinking coffee or whatever was
j obtainable.
Alex lived next to a park which
| had been taken over by the Ges
j tapo. He soon grew accustomed to
i the sound of guns at regular hours
J reporting the death of Polish "crim
| inals."
j Executions Inevitable
"Just as you in America accept
' as inevitable the number of deaths
j by automobiles," Alex said, "so we
J grew to accept as inevitable the
daily executions of the people of
| Warsaw, since almost no one was
j innocent of violating the German
! made laws."
Even he, a boy of 14, was not in
nocent. Upon arriving in Warsaw,
the Keminskis established contact
with friends and Alex was soon en
j gaged in smuggling food with oth

ers of his age. The Germans had
issued food cards which were hard
ly adequate. The Poles were al
lowed 250 grams of bread a day, and
the only food items to be bought
without cards were vanilla, pepper,
and mustard.
Constant llope
"No," admitted Alex, "it wasn't
much fun, but we were not alone,
and there was always the hope that
it would soon be over. I and my
parents were fortunate."
At the end of three months the
Kaminskis moved to Belgrad, the
capital of Yugoslavia. This was
brought about with the help of Al
exander's uncle, a professor of
mathematics who was acquainted
with the Yugoslavian consul.
Alex related one incident with
particular enjoyment. On the way
to Yugoslavia the family was com
pelled to stop in Vienna for several
hours. Since they had no food cards
they were refused food all over the
city. Back at the station restaurant
they insisted that they were trav
elers, and the headwaiter finally
consented to serve them, but only
one dish. The Germans were eating
only one dish per meal and every
one else was doing the same. The
Kaminskis accepted and the dish
was brought.
"Boiled Grass"
"It looked like boiled grass," said
Alex, "and even in our starved
condition we couldn't eat it."
A Gestapo officer was observing
them. When he learned that they
were travelers, there ensued a few
minutes of excited whispering be
tween the headwaiter and the offi
cer, followed by profuse apologies
delivered by the latter in the most
humble Nazi manner.
"We were served the best meal
we had eaten in months," added
Alex. "Naturally, the Germans
couldn't think of travelers leaving
German territory with a bad im
pression!"
Six peaceful months were spent
in Yugoslavia, ended by the rumors
that it was becoming unsafe for
Polish refugees to remain. Taking
no chances, the Kaminskis left.
Rumors Everywhere
"Those nasty rumors followed us
everywhere," said Alex ruefully,
"and everywhere we were forced
to pay numerous special taxes and
fees for obscure purposes which we
could never understand.
The family went from Yugoslavia
to Istanbul, Jerusalem, Bagdad,
towns along the coast of Arabia, and
finally to Bombay, India, where by
sheer luck they obtained passage to
America. No one had dared to
dream of passage to America.
"When I got off the boat at San
Pedro, California," Alex looked pen
sive, "I saw a string of pearls lying
on the pavement. I don't think they
were real, but I thought that truly
America must be a wonderful coun
try if there were pearls to be found
in the streets."
