# Local Group Entertains With 'Philadephia Story'
## 
### CAMILLA RYALL 
"Philadelphia Story," Philip Bar
ry's fast-moving comedy which was
j performed over the weekend by a
i group of local artists, and which
will be seen again next weekend at
the Palo Alto Community Theater,
affords a delightful and entertaining
I evening.
"Oh Suds!" introduces Barbara
Musto as Tracy Lord, the Philadel
phia socialite, who has married, di
; vorced, and who plans to remarry,
i In the first act, Miss Musto stands
1 as a poor substitute for Katherine
Hepburn. However, the lines in
j the drunken second act and in the
I sympathetic third act help her in
leaving a favorable impression by
} the time the curtain falls.
Good Characterization
Professor Richard Ogg' of the
: Chemistry Department gives a good
! characterization of George Kott
j ridge, the hysterical and jerky sui
tor, who leaves Tracy on the wed
! ding day. Mrs. Ogg is very attrac
j tive, both in her acting and in her
j looks, as the understanding pho
; iographer.
Walter Palance as Dexter Haven
j is definitely one of the strongest
| characterizations in the Flay. He is
I very much at ease on the stage from
J the minute he walks on and says,
I "Hello, you sweet thing," until he
J walks smilingly out of the third act.
| Palance does a fine job with a mis
j cast part. He is very much needed
j and does not appear often enough.
Sister Steals Show
The little sister as portrayed by
Barbara Brooke steals the snow
with her precocious understanding
j of her sister's affairs. Mrs. Rose
! Mary Hay, as the suburban mother,

and Louis Jefferys as the female
pinching Uncle Willie play signifi
cant parts in adding to the play's
onjoyability.
Will iam Little as Mike Connor,
the reporter who is dissatisfied with
his assignment, gives a weak por
trayal; however, the scene in which
he gets drunk is very well done.
David Manning acts the typical
playboy as Tracy's brother, Alexan
der Lord, and Cliff Gififin as Seth
Lord, the father, is not a definite or
a convincing character.
In spite of small shortcomings,
â€¢'The Philadelphia Story" is well
produced and the audience leaves
the beautiful little theater in a gay
and good humor.
