# Standards Low, Says ASSU Head
## Conference Votes On Late Leaves, Housing Decisions 
### 
Bob Kennedy, A.S.S.U. president,
i spoke to Women's Conference num
| bcrs yesterday on standards of per
. sonal conduct on the campus which,
ihe believes, have fallen consider
ably.
Dances and social functions are
'getting out of line," he said, citing
' the "blackout firesides" of the men's
j halls and conduct of students
j sprawling on the lawn in front of
j the library and in Union Court.
Representatives to Meet
Kennedy will meet with repre
j sentatives of the men's halls and
j talk to them about the problem, but
i he feels that it is chiefly up to the
j women to correct the situation.
Conference voted to give a non
: quota late leave Friday, Feb. 22, to
women who do not have Saturday
classes. Thursday, Feb. 21, will be
' a non-quota night.
Decisions Passed
Housing Committee's three deci
sions were passed by Conference
members. They are:
1. There will be no discriminatory
policy toward transfers. They will
draw with their academic class.
2. Students who are first-quarter
juniors this spring quarter may
j draw either with their junior aca
demic class or their sophomore so
cial class. Hereafter they will draw
width their academic class.
3. When students of two different,
classes draw in pairs, the lower
class preference will be given to
both of ihem.
: Conference members felt that the
plan suggested at Housing Commit-
I tec Thursday, of having all sopho
; mores live together in one dormi-
I tory and then have small houses
J only for juniors and seniors, would
! destroy house unity and spirit and
I would isolate the members of each
: class. Women were to discuss this
j in their houses last night.
