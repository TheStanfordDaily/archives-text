i Seeking a solution to post-war
j problems faced by universities all
; over the nation, a committee of eight
Stanford and six University of Cali
| fornia professors has sent an appeal
j to more than 100 renowned scholars
j in this country.
The committee sees this as a dan
gerous period for universities, in
! volving grave problems of keeping
j educational freedom, thwarting in
| fluences of outside pressures, and
| maintenance of a wise administra
i tion.
Fundamental Ideals
{ Concerning the appeal, Marion D.
j Kirkwood, professor of law at Stan
j ford, said that the chief purpose of
J the committee was to restate the
| fundamental ideals and principles of
j universities, and were not to rc
j fleet conditions prevalent on the
| Stanford or University of California
j campuses.
The resolution advocates three
j main ideas:
j One, that the university is prc
: eminently a company of scholars. It
i attracts teachers and students of the
j highest possible ability and of un
| questioned devotion to the search
! for truth and the dissemination of
j knowledge.
Complete Freedom
The scond point stated complete
i freedom in the acquisition of knowl
| edge by all students, and the third
reiterated that "the true university
affords a maximum of opportunity
for scholarly endeavor. It achieves
this objective through effective and
! continuing cooperation between its
| scholars and its administrators."
This means that administration
! should be the servant of scholarship,
not the master, according to the
committee. Professors should not
| direct policies determined by out
| side forces.
