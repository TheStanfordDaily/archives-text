# ASSU To Vote Feb. 20; Court Election Today
## Farm Will Select Officers, Vote on New Constitution 
### 
Stanford students will vote on the revised A.S.S.U.
constitution proposed last spring and will elect three
members to Men's Council, two members to Women's
Council, a head yell leader, and two assistant yell
leaders at the winter quarter election to be held Wed-

nesday, Feb. 20, announced Bob
Ayres, publicity chairman for Elcc-
I don Board.
Th» revised constitution has been
i on a trial basis since it was tenta
tively accepted by Excom and stu
dents last spring. Probably the most
I debatable issue, according to Ayres,
I is the new system of area repre-
I sentation as opposed to the former
system of class representation.
! Class vs. Area
Under the earlier system of class
representation two Excom repre
sentatives were elected by classes.
Critics claimed that too often many
or all representatives came from
only one or two sections of the
campus, thus making the link be
tween students and representatives
weak and inadequate.
Under the system of area repre
: sentation, representatives are elect -
; ed by given living group areas, with
1 each representative responsible to
j house presidents and each house
president responsible to the stu-
I dents.in his living group.
Excom and students hoped by this
| system to insure closer contact be
tween legislative activities and the
i campus at large.
Whether or not this new consti
tution has provided closer contact
will be discussed by student leaders
and the Daily in future articles.
Yell Positions Open
Ayres wished to stress that any
men still interested in trying out for
assistant yell leader should contact
Bill Lippincott, acting head yell
leader. Two tryoutees for assistant
yell leader will be chosen to act as
assistants to Lippincott at the games
this weekend.
Before the war the two assistant
yell leaders were elected by the
student body from six tryoutees
each winter quarter. The head yell
leader was elected from the two
previous assistants.
During the war this was not fol
lowed, and this election will be the
first since 1942 in which assistants
j have been elected.
Petitions for the offices of Men's
and Women's Councils may be ob
' tained at the A.S.S.U. office Thurs-
I day, Feb. 14. All declinations must
| be in on the day before the elec
i tion, Feb. 19.

Under the earlier system of class
representation two Excom repre
sentatives were elected by classes.
Critics claimed that too often many
or all representatives came from
only one or two sections of the
campus, thus making the link be
tween students and representatives
weak and inadequate.
Under the system of area repre
: sentation, representatives are elect -
; ed by given living group areas, with
1 each representative responsible to
j house presidents and each house
president responsible to the stu-
I dents.in his living group.
Excom and students hoped by this
| system to insure closer contact be
tween legislative activities and the
i campus at large.
Whether or not this new consti
tution has provided closer contact
will be discussed by student leaders
and the Daily in future articles.
Yell Positions Open
Ayres wished to stress that any
men still interested in trying out for
assistant yell leader should contact
Bill Lippincott, acting head yell
leader. Two tryoutees for assistant
yell leader will be chosen to act as
assistants to Lippincott at the games
this weekend.
Before the war the two assistant
yell leaders were elected by the
student body from six tryoutees
each winter quarter. The head yell
leader was elected from the two
previous assistants.
During the war this was not fol
lowed, and this election will be the
first since 1942 in which assistants
j have been elected.

Stanford students will vote on the revised A.S.S.U.
constitution proposed last spring and will elect three
members to Men's Council, two members to Women's
Council, a head yell leader, and two assistant yell
leaders at the winter quarter election to be held Wed-

nesday, Feb. 20, announced Bob
Ayres, publicity chairman for Elcc-
I don Board.
Th» revised constitution has been
i on a trial basis since it was tenta
tively accepted by Excom and stu
dents last spring. Probably the most
I debatable issue, according to Ayres,
I is the new system of area repre-
I sentation as opposed to the former
system of class representation.
