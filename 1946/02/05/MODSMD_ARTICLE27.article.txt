# Congratulations!
## 
### 
Every once in a while an organization ap
pears on campus that makes a distinctive
contribution to Stanford life —a contribution
that works for the betterment of Stanford stu
denis and their social, recreational, and intel
lectual opportunities.
This time we're shouting about the Stan
ford Symphony Forum, reorganized early
this quarter after several years of inactivity.
Under a handicap because of that factor,
chairmen and forum members have gone
ahead to secure half-price tickets for Stan
ford students to the current Friday afternoon
San Francisco symphony series. Plans in
clude a large meeting before each symphony

where Farm concert-goers can gather to dis
cuss the program, the guest artist, and other
musical facts pertinent to each symphony.
In addition, the forum presented last week
a bang-up lecture-recital by concert pianist
Maxim Schapiro, who proved a success
which the forum hopes to duplicate at more
guest artist appearances this quarter.
Membership in the forum carries no pre
requisites, and forum meetings are open to
all interested Stanford students. We think
there are many Stanford students wjio
would be and are interested, and we are sure
that they will agree with us when we say
"Congratulations!" to the returning Stanford
Symphony Forum.—M.S.
