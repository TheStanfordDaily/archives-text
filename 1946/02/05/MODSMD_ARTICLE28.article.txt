A GRIPE ABOUT GRIPES
To the Editor:
I've stood about all I can as far as a cer
tain attitude goes. The peak was reached
last week in your letters to the editor column
when someone criticized the treatment ..he
had gotten at Stanford.
In the first place, a great lot of the new
students are assuming the attitude that Stan
ford owes thern something. Surely it's true;
you can- get a lot out of Stanford. But you
get out of it what you put into it. We who
have been at Stanford before believe that
Stanford offers us something that we can't
find somewhere else. That's why we came
here.
This tradition stuff may not mean anything
to others, but it means something to us.
Fifty years of students helped create those
traditions and we were left with the heritage
to carry them on.
We carried them successfully through the

war despite increased enrollment and ob
vious difficulties. As long as newcomers
chose Stanford, don't you think they could
at least observe the traditions that have
helped to make Stanford a great university?
After you've been here awhile, you be
come conscious of somthing elusively called
"the Stanford way of life." This term em
bodies many things that have always meant
a lot to Stanford students: the Honor Code,
the "hello" tradition, and most important,
"the Stanford Family." With the increased
enrollment, are we losing "the Stanford way
of life?"
Many of you who have just registered
have gone to other schools before. Your
main thought is to finish your education as
fast as you can. But you will leave here
with a Stanford degree; it should entail ac
cepting the Stanford standards and trying to
observe the things about the University that
so many students have cherished.
