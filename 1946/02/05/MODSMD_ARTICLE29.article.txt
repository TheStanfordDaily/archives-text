Our new track coach has the distinction of hav
ing done something better than anyone else has ever
done it on our planet. More specifically he nego
tiated 200 meters around a turn without aid of a
mechanical contrivance or artificial stimulant in 20.9
seconds back in 1937. Not only that but he's got 12
lei tors in his last name which is some kind of a

new indoor record.

This may come as a blow in some quarters—win

solved to take no heed of characters appearing in
Dick Tracy in the coming months, no matter how
spine-tingling their deeds are, unless of course
