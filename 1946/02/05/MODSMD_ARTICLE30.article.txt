### ELLIOTT EPSTEEN ELLIOT EPSTEEN 
The Case-Halleck bill is drawing a lot of support
in Congress, and a lot of fire from labor unions. The
CIO-PAC is definitely against it, but it was this or
ganization that indirectly inspired it.
The Political Action Committee has been too
ruthless in its treatment of non-conformist con
gressmen. High-paid propagandists who will work
for anybody providing the price is right are ordered
to undermine anybody if he does not follow the PAC
line on every thing.
Congressmen don't like this. When'they returned
to their constituents and found discontent over the
strike situation, they reflected, informed opinion
claims. They figured they could take a swipe at
the CIO, using the present abominable labor situa
tion as an excuse.
Bill as Mechanism
The Case-Halleck bill is the mechanism for the
swipe. It is limited by its nature to nationwide
strikes. The AFL, by its *ery organization, could
not participate in such a move.
Yet the bill itself is not particularly drastic. It
will make companies and unions subject to court
action if they violate contracts. It will cause a .'5O
- cooling off period before a strike, prevent union
boycotts, violence on picket lines, and foreman's
unions.
l ! nion Objections
The CfO is making a very definite objection. It
is that the whole thing is an "insidiously drawn
piece of strike busting legislation designed to break
unions by constant harassment with law suits."
This is stupid. A national union (and they are
the only ones affected) which can pay its leader
$50,000 a year certainly has enough treasury to
face a law suit or a group of them. Besides, most
unions keep lawyers on retainer, and could face a

flock of suits without too much trouble.
But there are quite a few other objections which
are much more reasonable.
Spirit of Bill
First and foremost is the spirit in which the bill
was drawn. Its mild terms might be a good serv
ice this time; they might make the CIO a little less
ruthless in its political activities. But if the spirit of
gunning for ;i labor union continues, it will provide
the factionalism which all good statesmanship
should try to avoid.
Secondly, it is dangerous to fix the unions to
their present contractual obligations because the
future is up in the air. We do not know what in
creased productivity is going to do to the labor
force, but we do know if we will or won't be caught
in a much worse inflation next year.
II unions are to be fixed to their contracts, those
should he made very flexible and renegotiated, if
we expect the law to last.
I.W'al SI l ikes Important
'Ihirdly, the local unions, which are not included,
can all continue with their strikes. Every major
metropolitan city has small labor organizations
which are out. Groups of local strikes paralyze
more, and cost more, than most of the publicized
national strikes.
Fourthly, the features of violence and secondary
boycotts have been prohibited often before, and the
laws stopping them stand on many state statutes.
Yet they are ineffective, because merely outlawing
deep-set strife never really stops it.
The basis for labor peace in the future is a real
has is for equity established by law, or a system of
arbitration that is guaranteed to be fair and honest.
If we get either one of these, we can outlaw the
strike legitimately. Bills such (he the Case-Halleck
bill can put the lid on temporarily, but it does not
seem that they will work indefinitely.
