# 'Spellbound’ Casts Spell; Rated Climactical, Nearly Convincing
## 
### 
"Spellbound" casts a slightly wavering spell over the Stanford Theater
this week, but it is good entertainment. One disappointment is that Greg
ory Pock and Ingrid Bergman, plus razor, as seen on the billboards from
here to San Francisco, must have been the daydream of an artist who
had to catch a train before he could see all of the movie.
"Spellbound" is one series of climaxes after another, with Ingrid

Bergman as a psychiatrist and
j Gregory Peck as her amnesia
' guilt complex patient. Miss Berg
man manages to he much more
sure of Peck's innocence than the
audience, which makes for good
| suspense. Of course she's already
read the script, so she knows,
j Dali takes some very interesting
1 liberties with Freud in the dream
I sequence. Gregory Peck's subcon
scious is a great mass of eyes,
wheels, and bare halls. It's very
convenient that he dreams the
whole thing up in one night.
"Spellbound" handles a very
difficult theme in an almost con
vincing manner. It shortens the
whole process of psychiatry, hut
it manages to make it reasonably
believable and thoroughly dra
matic. Of course it leaves the
I audience analyzing everybody in
terms of guilt complexes.
The actual murderer is pretty
j much the "butler" in the mystery.
! He is the last person anyone sus
pects, but the audience and Miss
: Bergman manage to tie in suspect
ing him. Particularly good is the
! suicide scene, in which the gun
| slowly points at the audience (and
1 the victim) and then explodes.
"Spellbound" will influence a
I night's dream ... it's a good show,
