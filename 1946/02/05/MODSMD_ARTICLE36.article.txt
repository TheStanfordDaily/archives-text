# Owens Tells Union Story
## 
### HELEN PINKERTON 
The hurly-burly heap of offices
j and pigeonhole rooms on top of the
. Cellar (with a residence and dining
j hall attached) is the Stanford Un
ion.
According to William B. Owens,
J professor of law and chairman of
the executive committee of the Un
ion Board of Governors, the Union
[ has never been satisfactory because
; it is crowded and because it is built
|in two separate units neither of
| which is complete in itself.
Old and New Unions
The entire Union consists of the
j "Old" Union, containing the Cellar,
| the cigar counter, the barber shop,
the Nitery, and the various offices
of the Associated Students; and the
j "New Union," which includes the
main Union dining hall and the Un
ion Residence for women.
The Union is directed by the ex
ecutive committee of the Union
Board' of Governors for the Univer
sity. Profits at present go toward
I the payment of the debt for the
construction of the Memorial Hall.
Profits have averaged approxi
mately $17,000, yearly, and at that
rate the Memorial Hall debt should
be paid off in five or six years, Mr.
Owens r.tated.
Union Center
A campaign was begun around
1914 to build*a Union center, Mr.
j Owens said. Originally membership
I was to be limited to those who had
purchased life memberships. Some
money was made in this way but
| the bulk of the fund was contrib-
I uted by former President Herbert
I Hoover.
The Union was first constructed
;on 14 different levels, which ac
j counts for the awkward levels of
| the floors today. It has been re
| modeled many times since.
When the Old Union became too
! crowded due to the growth of the
: University, the New Union was
i built as the gift of an anonymous
| lonor.
Board Created
About 1920 the Administration
created the Union Board of Gov
j ernors to supervise the Union af-
I fairs. Members of it are the Dean
! of Students, the University business
| manager, a faculty member, the
student body president, the student
manager, and one other student ap
j pointed by the Executive Commit
tee. .
By 1930 the Union cleared its debt
| which had amounted to over $100,-
| 000 for the Now Union equipment
j and remodeling of the Old. The
i basement of the Old Union was
remodeled for $40,000 and the Un
! ion-operated lunch counter was in
! stalled in place of the former pri
! vately owned restaurant.
Reduced Theater Debt
At the time when the Union was
out of debt a movement was in
progress for the building of a thea
ter. Money had already been col
lected for a war memorial of some
kind, and when a memorial theater
was decided upon it was agreed that
the profits from the Union should
oo toward paying the theater debt.
This, with the dollar fee collected
from each student's tuilion. has re
; dueed the theater debt to about
"j 120.000.
Mr. Owens said that it has al
ways been the purpose of the ex
cutive committee to gather all the
headquarters of student activities
into one center for convenience.
"Now that they are all there, we are
too crowded," he concluded.
