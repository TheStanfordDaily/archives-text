By Former Stanfordite
"Music on a Quiet Theme," by
William Bergsma, a former Stanford
student (1933-40) follows no acad
emic form, and promises to be one
of the highlights of the program.
Pierre Monteux, famed in this
country and in Europe for his sym
phonic interpretations of modern
composers, last appeared at Stanford
April 10, 1939, when he conducted
the San Francisco Symphony or
chestra with Isaac Stern, 19-ycar
old violinist, as the soloist.
