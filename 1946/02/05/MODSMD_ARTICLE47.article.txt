# Stanford Cagers' Hopes Rise for U.C.L.A. Series
## 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
Stanford's chances for a Conference basketball victory go on the block
this weekend when the Indians take to the road for a two-day sojourn at
Los Angeles and a brace of conflicts with hte Uclan Bruins.
The Bruins last week entertained their Berkeley cousins and from the
results posted, would .just as soon had Cal miss its train, the Bruin show-

ing being that bad.
Belter Last Week
The Farm did a little better over
the weekend, holding oft' a tough
College of Pacific quintet in the
closing minutes after twice having
the Bengals on the ropes for a Fri
day victory, and then failing to
make the same trick pay off Satur
day night when they bowed to a
cagey University of San Francisco
combine.
The Bruin did much worse in the
family brawl, Cal chasing U.C.L.A.
off the floor the first night with a
50-37 shellacking, and then club
bing the docile Bruin for a 49-25
triumph the second.
The Cards came through the
weekend in fairly excellent shape,
only one more player acquiring a
swatch of adhesive tape. Jack
Wood, substitute guard, was re
moved from the floor near the end
of the Saturday game with a
sprained ankle, but will be back in
shape for the Bruin series this
weekend, plus a little tape.
Great improvement
The Indians have been coming
along splendidly in the past few
weeks, showing more improvement
in the past two games than was
thought possible by those who ob
served them in the beginning of
the season.
Putting together the last half of
the first half and the first half of
the last half Saturday night for
their best performance of the season
to date, the Farmhands showed
their ability to come through when
the pressure is on, but jeopardized
their staying ability by doing so.
One triumph or even two tri
umphs this weekend are not exactly
in the class of outright upsets, de
spite the poor showing tile team
made when U.C.L.A. played up here
last month. The Tribe has steadily
improved, whereas the Bruin has
been going downhill at a fairly
steady clip since then.
The Cards will take tilings easy
for the remainder of the week, fol
lowing a scrimmage last night and
another tonight, and will leave
Thursday night on the Lark.
