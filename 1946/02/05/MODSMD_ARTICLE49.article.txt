# 'Our Worries Never Cease’

### 
NEW YORK. Feb. 4 (UP).—The
misgivings that baseball managers
felt when their stars marched off to
war found a counterpart tonight in
their apprehension over the condi
tion ofg the G. I. Joes coming back
to the diamond.
For that reason, those with rost
ers seemingly overloaded with tal
ent were reluctant to part with even
a third-string utility man. The ques
tion uppermost in the minds of all
is: Has Joe McGlurk, that terrific
.357 pre-war hitler, developed a
hitch in his swing? or can Phil
Phaultless, the 22-game winner,
still make his curve bend like a
freight train coming around the
mountain?
The war has v/orked strange ef
fects on men in every walk of life,
in attitude, in growth and in physi
cal adaptability. For the white-col
lar workers, it was a chance to
toughen up; for the athletes it was
murderous to the muscle tone and
co-ordination of mind and body
that they had put in so many years
to develop for sport.
And more tangible misfortune be
fell many a ball-player during his
trek to the wars and back home
again. Battle casualties were ex
tremely rare, but the strain of mili
tary service, training camp acci
dents and over-exertion took their
toll in other forms.
