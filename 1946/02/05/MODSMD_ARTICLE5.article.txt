# Atomic Group Hears Spalding
## 
### 
Merrill Spalding, professor of his
tory. addressed the Student Associ
ation for Atomic Control last night.
He discussed the problems facing
the UNO, particularly with regard to
the control of atomic energy.
Dr. Spalding began his talk by
minimizing national sovereignty as
it stands today. He stated that it is
possible to resist it by a small mi
nority, which was exemplified by
the Catholics when they resisted the
religious policies of Bismarck's Ger
man state.
International Cooperation
The bringing about of interna
tional cooperation is very important.
One of the chief difficulties which
lies in its way is the problem of in
spection. Dr. Spalding favored the
inspection of the manufacturing of
atomic power rather than inspection
in the laboratories.
He said that the inspection of lab
oratories would be pushing the mat
ter too far because there may be a
number of secrets which a govern
ment would want to keep, such as
other methods of warfare. This in
spection might affect the much
needed cooperation between certain
nations.
The United Nations must pay par
ticular caution with regard to un
necessary discrimination. With
Germany and Japan reasserting
themselves, a new balance of power
will come into being. The UNO must
take advantage of building up and
strengthening the liberal powers in
the two nations. The militaristic
passion particularly among the youth
must be wiped out.
Russian Feeling Must Go
The prevalent uncharitable feel
ing toward Russia has to be erased,
said Dr. Spalding. The Russian de
sire for peace is very real. The Rus
sians arc not going to plunge into
war if possible, and they are ready
to devote 20 or 30 years to the es
tablishment of peace machinery as
set up by the UNO. With that spirit
from Russia there is a pretty good
chance of cooperation in the world.
The ideals and principles for which
the UNO appear to be responsible
bust be held in perspective by all
persons. The vital interest of the
UNO' at the present moment must
be the spirit of cooperation, he con
cluded.
