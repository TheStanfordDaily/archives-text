PITTSBURGH, Feb. 4 (UP).—Clark D. Chaughnessy, former Stanford
coach, resigned as football coach at the University of Pittsburgh, Chancel
lor Rufus H. Fitzgerald announced tonight.
Shaughnessy revealed that he has accepted an offer to return to the
University oi Maryland as head coach. Fitzgrald made no announcement

of a successor to the ' T master.
"Coach of Year" for 11)41
Shaughnessy, named "coach of the
year" in 1941 after he had coached
his Stanford University team to vic
tory in the Rose Bowl, resigned his
Pitt position after rejecting an offer
which would have permitted him to
remain as head coach if he severed
his pro football connections.
Shaughnessy acts as an advisory
coach with the Washington Red
skins.
Succeeds Paul Bryant
The smiling coach, who played a
major part in revitalizing college
and professional football with his
emphasis on the *'T" formation, will
succeed Paul (Bear) Bryant as Ter
rapin coach. He had coached at
Maryland before coming to Pitt in
1943.
The resignation climaxed growing
discontent with the Shaughnessy re
gime which reached its peak last
week when three angry assistant
football coaches told Athletic Direc
tor Jimmy Hagan they did not care
"to continue next fall if Clark
Shaughnessy is back as head coach."
Students Asked Resignation
Five months earlier, after Pitt was
beaten by Notre Dame 39-9, a group
of students circulated a petition de
manding Shaughnessy's resignation.
Tension ran high, but subsided when
the team gave Shaughnessy a vote
of confidence.
Shaughnessy's assistants — Bobby
Hoel, Charles (Doc) Hartwig, and
Stan Olenn, submitted their resigna
tions last Nov. 8, but were persuaded
to remain until the end of the 1945
season.
In a statement to newspapermen,
they said they quit
1. Because we just don't want to
work with him.
2. He has no interest in our uni
versity.
3. His inconsistency and insin
cerity.
4. His impersonal attitude toward
the players.
5. His method of teaching.
