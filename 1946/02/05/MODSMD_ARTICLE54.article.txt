# Swim Squad Will Win PCC Says Coach
## 
### 
Here is some good news for win
starved Farm rooters. Yesterday in
a loud and cl&ar voice Coach Tom
Haynie stated: "I don't see how we
can miss copping the P.C.C. swim- j
ming championsnip."
Although the swim schedule has 1
not as yet been released we can an
nounce that our team will meet the '
Olympic Club, U.C.L.A., U. V)f C., j
San Jose State, U.S.C., and probably
an outfit representing Treasure Is- |
land. Hall' of these'meets will be
held at Stanford and the other halt ;
away from the home pool.
Season >n Spring
The major portion of the compe- J
tition will take place in the spring
quarter but one or two of the en
gagements will be held this quar
t?r. The swimmers rfeally look j
strong this season so if you enjoy
watching our Indian athletes come
out on top in varsity competition
you will want to see our swimmers
when they go into action. All the
meets will be announced when they
come up so that you will be sure not
to miss vhem.
The boys Coach Haynie is ex- i
pecting to chalk up the wins arc |
working out every day in great |
form. He said that there was plenty
of room for new tryoutees though, i
especially divers.
One Excellent Diver
We do have one line diver repre
senting us now. John Kroener is
being counted on for firsts in his i
event. Jim Armstrong, of Palo Alto,
is the outstanding performer in the |
middle distances. Boone, lowa, has
sent us Bob Anderson, a freshman
who specializes in the 40- to 100-
yard free-style sprints. Anderson
now holds the interscholastic rec
ords for these distances.
Also starring in the sprints are
Ray Pvule and Clint Eastman, both
old-timers on the Stanford squad.
And our best breaststrokers are
Harry Borcher, Whittier, and Don
Hestor. The latter hails from Los
Angeles and is in the navy program
here.
After the dearth of first-rate teams
carrying Stanford colors recently,
the swimmers will be looked to to
throw some fear of Stanford prow
ess into the hearts of the majority
of our opponents. And they should
get the backing up they deserve
for these activities from the campus
sports fans.
