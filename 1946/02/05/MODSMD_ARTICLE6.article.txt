# Light Snow Falls Behind University
## 
### 
Was it really cold? Or are those
blankets too thin for sleeping porch
inhabitants?
ThÂ« weather report says it. was
really cold and that those Cannon
blankets are probably just as good
as they were last fall.
The weather yesterday morning
registered 33.5 degrees here. Snow
flurries were reported over the
weekend on mountains back of the
University and on the Mt. Hamilton
range east of San Jose.
Five inches of snow was reported
on the Skyline Boulevard and more
snow was reported at La Honda
and King's Mountain.
