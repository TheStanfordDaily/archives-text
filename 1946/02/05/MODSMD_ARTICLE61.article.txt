SEWARD. Alaska, Feb. 4 (UP).—
Hundreds of panic-chilled passen
gers clung to the decks of the
stricken 5,746 - ton passenger liner
Yukon in the glare of searchlights
from rescue ships tonight, praying
for rescue from oil-coated, heaving
North Pacific seas.
Broken almost in half on jagged
rocks at the base of towering John
ston* "s Glacier 48 miles east of here,
the battered Yukon was reported
cracking up and in danger of sliding
clown into 250 fathoms of water,
along with its crew of 124 and 371
passengers.
Blizzards Abate
Six rescue ships, including two
Coast Guard cutters, rode out heav
ing icy seas nearby attempting to
close in to start rescue operations.
Squalling blizzards, which drove
the Yukon on the rocks this morn
ing, abated slowly as the storm cen
ter, classified by the Weather Bu
reau as "intense," moved slowly ot
the east of the scene.
Stern Almost Torn DIT
Skippers of rescue craft circling
the broken Yukon said the vessel's
stern, almost torn off by the initial
impact, was tilted downward into
the sea at an angle of 20 degrees,
according to the 13th Naval Dis
trict.
Crewmen of the Onondaga volun
teered to man a powerboat to trans
fer endangered Yukon passengers
and crew to the Coast Guard cutter.
Naval spokesmen said three other
craft, the S.S. Zalinski, North Ha
ven, and the Patrol Boat 107. had
arrived on the scene to assist in
operations.
Passengers Sale
Last message from the Yukon's
master, Capt. Christian E. Trond
sen, was that the vessel was "break
ing up fore and aft" and that "all
passengers arc accounted fo|."
The Onondago sighted the Yukon
at 3 p.m. after ploughing through
log and mountainous seas from
Cordova, Alaska, in answer to the
SOS. The Onondago reported the
bay was still exposed to the storm
and that it was standing by.
A message from the Yukon to the
Onondago reported "visibility of 0
to 3 feet, snow and fog, waves 16 to
22 feet high with icy spray and no
change expected in 24 hours."
