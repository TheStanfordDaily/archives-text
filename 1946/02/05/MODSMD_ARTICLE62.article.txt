LONDON, Feb. 4 (UP). â€”The
steering committee of the United
Nations General Assembly agreed
tonight to postpone until Sept. 3
the next meeting of the Assembly,
which is scheduled to be held at
UNO's permanent headquarters in
the United States.
The recommendation for the next
meeting is expected to be made to
the committee Wednesday and
probably will be adopted Thurs
day. It will call for the meeting to
be held on the first Tuesday after
Sept. 2.
The postponement was agreed to
in principle after General Assembly
President Paul-Henri Spaak of Bel
gium pointed out that spring and
summer would bring many inter
national meetings, including the Eu
ropean peace conference. A special
session can be called if urgent UNO
problems arise, Spaak said. The
second meeting had been earlier
scheduled for April.
