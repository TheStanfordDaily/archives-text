# Bowles Asks Truman to Set Price Policy
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 (UP).—
, Price Chief Chester Bowles today
j carried his fight on price control di
| rect to the Whit? House, asking
President Truman to establish a
i new basic policy to govern price
j increases necessary to settle wage
| Jisputes.
One .source said the White House
j probably would make an announce
j ment tomorrow or Wednesday on
the price situation. The OPA was
j understood to be drafting a memo
randum in connection with the an
| nounccment, presumably dealing
j with the proposed new wage-price
""ormuia.
! Steel Increase
Bowles reportedly is now con
i vinced that the stalemated steel
dispute makes it imperative for the
j government to decide on a new
I formula that would permit price in
: creases in the steel and other in
{ dust l ies to compensate for wage
| hikes.
This would represent a retreat by
Bowles from his previous stand on
I the price issue. But he was rcpre-
I sented as feeling that a new formula
( that could be applied uniformly to
■ all industries would be preferable
i to what he terms the present "play
i ing -by - ear" method of handling
j wage-price adjustments piecemeal.
May Resign
It was understood that he prob
ably would resign if the Adminis
; tration followed a method of grant
ing price increases to the business
men who put the greatest pressure
on Congress and the OPA.
He conferred for .45 minutes with
Mr. Truman, but declined afterward
to give details. As for reports that
he was considering resigning, he
said he still was working for the
government and noted that "the
pay is good—the working conditions
| are lousy."
Second Conference
It was Bowles' second conference
in three days with the President.
I whose immediate goal is settlement
of the steel strike, now in its third
} week.
Earlier, Mr. Truman conferred
with Secretary of Labor Lewis B.
Schwellenbach, CIO President Phil
ip Murray, and John R. Steelman,
White House labor expert. Schwel
lenbach and Murray had no direct
comment on their discussion with
the President.
