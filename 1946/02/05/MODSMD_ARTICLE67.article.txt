# Strike Control Bill in House
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 (UP).â€”
The House today rejected an attempt
to kill the drastic Case strike-control
bill, but turned thumbs down on
1 proposals which would have made it
j even more severe.
In a hectic five-hour session in
which normal parliamentary proce
dure was ignored, the chamber vot
ed down, 130 to 42, a motion by
Rep. Emanuel Celler (D.. N. Y.) that
it abandon consideration of the Case
measure. He proposed that this be
achieved by eliminating the enact
j ing clause of the labor committee's
j watered-down version of President
Truman's fact-finding proposal.
This would have killed both bills
| automatically.
Rejected Two Proposals
The chamber then turned to con
: sideration of amendments and
[ promptly rejected:
1. Proposal by Rep. Walter G. An
drews, (R., N. Y.), to compel labor
unions to incorporate and submit
; annual financial statements to the
j government.
2. A proposal by Rep. Joseph
O'Hara (R., Minn.), to permit em
ployers to discharge workers who
refuse to report on the job during
i the proposed 30-day, pre-strike
j "cooling off" period.
Adams Offers Substitute
The House look under advisement
; a new substitute offered by Rep.
Sherman Adams (R., N. Y.), which
i is more in line with a bill now pend
! ing in the Senate.
It would strengthen the concilia
tion and mediation services, set up
voluntary arbitration machinery and
: authorize the president to establish
fact-finding boards in serious labor
disputes. Unlike the president's
1 original proposal, however, it would
not give such boards subpoena pow
! ers and would not impose a "cool
[ ing off" period.
