# Cressey Proposes UNO Geographical Committee

### MARY VIRGINIA POND 
A planning commission stalled with geographers who understand na
tions in the light of their resources and population potentials is the recom
mendation of Dr. George B. Cressey, visiting professor of geography at
Stanford, for the United Nations Organization.
Applying the information gained from geography to international re-

lations, Mr. Cressey pointed out
that geographers are able to look
at such nations as China or Russia
and evaluate their future roles in
the international scene.
Basic Factors
A nation's potential resources and
population number and distribution
are the basic factors in the geogra
pher's appraisal. "In other words,"
Mr. Cressey asserted, "we want to
know how much of what is where,
! and secondly, why do people do
what they do where they do it?"
Mr. Cressey explained that geog
raphers view a country from two
different anglesr—the social or eco
nomic and the natural or physical.
In respect to Ihe physical aspect
of geography, Mr. Cressey stated
that knowledge of the topography,
climate, and natural resources of a
nation is important . "Hence the
geographer is concerned with the
soil, the forests, and particularly the
j mineral resources of a country," he
j :aid.
"Big Five" Minerals
The minerals coal, oil, iron, cop
per. and sulphur are the "Big Five"
for any nation, Mr. Cressey de
clared. "If a nation doesn't have
these five minerals they are under
a definite handicap," he added, "and
| then they must import them."
In regard to the social or eco
nomic aspcct of geography, Mr.
Cressey stated it was necessary to
understand the people and their
characteristics. The energies, abili
ties, occupations, cultural back
ground, and distribution of a popu
lation are influential factors the ge
ographer studies.
Traveled Extensively
Mr. Cressey has traveled exten
sively through China, Soviet Asia,
Tibet. India, Japan, Java, and the
Philippines. "The first requirement
i for world citizenship is understand
| ing of global geography," he said,
I"and the first lesson of geography is
interdependence."
He added that geographers are
international relationists. They are
concerned with different parts of
the world, with the planning and
structure of the face of the earth,
he r>aid.
"We can't have intelligent good
will without understanding," he
contended. "We can't have intelli
gent understanding without geogra
phy. Geography is a catholic sub
ject with broad implications. It is
concerned with everything that
gives personality to the face of the
earth."

the international scene.
Basic Factors
A nation's potential resources and
population number and distribution
are the basic factors in the geogra
pher's appraisal. "In other words,"
Mr. Cressey asserted, "we want to
know how much of what is where,
! and secondly, why do people do
what they do where they do it?"
Mr. Cressey explained that geog
raphers view a country from two
different anglesr—the social or eco
nomic and the natural or physical.
In respect to Ihe physical aspect
of geography, Mr. Cressey stated
that knowledge of the topography,
climate, and natural resources of a
nation is important . "Hence the
geographer is concerned with the
soil, the forests, and particularly the
j mineral resources of a country," he
j :aid.
"Big Five" Minerals
The minerals coal, oil, iron, cop
per. and sulphur are the "Big Five"
for any nation, Mr. Cressey de
clared. "If a nation doesn't have
these five minerals they are under
a definite handicap," he added, "and
| then they must import them."
In regard to the social or eco
nomic aspcct of geography, Mr.
Cressey stated it was necessary to
understand the people and their
characteristics. The energies, abili
ties, occupations, cultural back
ground, and distribution of a popu
lation are influential factors the ge
ographer studies.
Traveled Extensively
Mr. Cressey has traveled exten
sively through China, Soviet Asia,
Tibet. India, Japan, Java, and the
Philippines. "The first requirement
i for world citizenship is understand
| ing of global geography," he said,
I"and the first lesson of geography is
interdependence."
He added that geographers are
international relationists. They are
concerned with different parts of
the world, with the planning and
structure of the face of the earth,
he r>aid.
"We can't have intelligent good
will without understanding," he
contended. "We can't have intelli
gent understanding without geogra
phy. Geography is a catholic sub
ject with broad implications. It is
concerned with everything that
gives personality to the face of the
earth."
A planning commission stalled with geographers who understand na
tions in the light of their resources and population potentials is the recom
mendation of Dr. George B. Cressey, visiting professor of geography at
Stanford, for the United Nations Organization.
Applying the information gained from geography to international re-

lations, Mr. Cressey pointed out
that geographers are able to look
at such nations as China or Russia
and evaluate their future roles in
the international scene.
