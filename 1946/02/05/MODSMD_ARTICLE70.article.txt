# Freshman Learns Meaning of Hate
## 
### 
Sidelight on Freshman Hate Day
was the tale of one unwary frosh
lad who offered a canoe ride to an
upper division woman at the Boat
house premiere.
She was dressed for swimming;
he was bundled in cold weather
clothes.
The temptation was too much.
She cried. "I hate men," and tipped
over the canoe.
