# Debate Topics Given
## 
### 
Stanford's Joffre squad refused to
commit themselves yesterday on the
University of California's topic sug
gestions for the annual Joffre de
bate.
Squad .members discussed the Cal
proposals today, but maintained
that they needed more time to reach
a definite decision.
California's three suggestions, re
ceived Monday by Leland T. Cha
pin, Farm debate coach, included:
1. Collectivism and a planned
economy;
2. Will the French Republic
live again?—political trends and
the possibilities of the new con
stitution;
3. French foreign policy since
San Francisco.
The Joffre squad has definitely
rejected the first of these, and may
submit a fourth topic as counter
proposal. This subject would be
"Political Trends Since Liberation."
According to U.C. Coach Jacobus
ten Brock, Cal favors the last of its
suggestions — French foreign policy
since San Francisco. For the past
few years the Joffre Debate has em
phasized foreign policy.
After both universities have
agreed on a general subject, a
specific question will be formu
[ la ted. Participants in the Joffre
Debate will not know this ques
'■ tion until an hour l>eforc the con-
I test.
J Debate Society members now in
training for the Joffre are Pat Car
son, debate manager; Carol New
ton. former debate manager; Frank
Creede, Bob Vallier, John Menzel,
Ward Hower, Ait Jaffe, and Rod
Rogaway.
Of these two will be selected by
Mr. Chapin for the contest.
