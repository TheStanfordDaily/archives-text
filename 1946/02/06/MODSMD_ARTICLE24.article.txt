# 'New World' Influence of Asiatic Russia Discussed at Series In Czech Diplomat
## 
### 
The influence of the '"new world"
which is being built in Asiatic Rus
sia was declared by last night's
Tuesday Evening Series speaker,
J Dr. Stefan Osusky, to be one of the
"great questions of the future."
I Our Problem
: As his main point, Dr. Osusky,
former Czech diplomat, contended
that it is the duty of the peoples of
Western civilization to see that our
heritage of the individual man's
free will is not discarded by the
; new civilization in the making.
There has been a fusion of the
traditional Northern man—mystical
I and vigorous—and the traditional
| Southern man —skilled and intellec
tual— in Russia today with the
movement of millions of peasants
j from the Ukraine and other Greater
| Russian areas to Oriental Russia.
' Dr. Osusky quoted the arguments
| of the Grand Inquisitor concerning
man's conscience in "The Brothers
Karamazov" by Dostoievsky as il-
I lustrative of the "spiritual drama of
the individual" and pointed out the

effect that the loss' of conscience
would have upon nations.
Industrial Shift
In a careful description of the
shift of industrial Russia to east of
the Ural Mountains, Dr. Osusky
compared thr colonization of this
area to the colonization of America
during the period of the 13 colonies
and to the shift to the West in the
nineteenth century.
He related how in 1927 Joseph
Stalin sent a Soviet oil man to Cali
fornia and Alaska to learn methods
of mining and then assigned him to
producing gold in Asiatic Russia.
He realized that this groat land
relatively unsettled and possessing
groat resources—could become to
Russian industrial life what tho
West had become to the United
States.
A period of settlement followed
the opening of the area. In 1929,
when many peasants objected to a
land plan then in operation, Stalin
saw the opportunity to send the I

recalcitrant peasants to Asiatic ,
Russia. "These strong, Slavic peas- !
ants form the backbone of the world J
being made in Asiatic Russia," Dr.
Osusky said. "These with several
thousand nomads."
It was Lenin's idea to build the j
industries where the raw materials !
were, and his successor saw that it j
was done and a lai-ge part of the j
budget allotted to the development
of the industries there. The shift of j
the industrial centers from the Do- |
netz, Leningrad, and Moscow areas j
to east of the Urals was strength- i
ened by the war. Dr. Osusky I
pointed out that the newly inde
pendent state of Out.'r Mongolia
between China and Russia would
undoubtedly be under Russian in
'luence.
Movement for Unity
Dr. Osusky stated that the new I
Russian movement for a com- j
mon spiritual unity superior to race i
and language developed apart from |
and rose above the two previous j
movements begun early in the nine- J
teenth century, which were the J
tendency to emulate Western Eu- I
rope and the opposite, to admire
Oriental ways.
The "Westernizers," such men as
Bakunin and Turgenev, wanted
Russia to imitate Western ways, but
not to go the same road politically
and socially, while the proponents
of the East, such as Dostoievsky,
considered the West gi'eedy, selfish,
and materialistic and admired the
wisdom of the Orientals.
Vlasaryk's Studies
Jan Masaryk, Czech statesman
and scholar of Russian history,
studied the question of whether
Russia was more of the East or of
the West and pointed out the differ
ences of opinion among the Rus
sians.
Dr. Osusky said that it was not
until after the Revolution and in
192G that the first general plan for
the future of Russia was proposed
by the government.
Russia as a Unit
He claimed that Russia was a
geographical, climatic, and anlhro
poiogica! unit and maintained that
common tendencies, such as those
in language, were more important
than common origins. For such a
unity a new system was required
and so the Bolshevik revolution had
been inevitable.

Industrial Shift
In a careful description of the
shift of industrial Russia to east of
the Ural Mountains, Dr. Osusky
compared thr colonization of this
area to the colonization of America
during the period of the 13 colonies
and to the shift to the West in the
nineteenth century.
He related how in 1927 Joseph
Stalin sent a Soviet oil man to Cali
fornia and Alaska to learn methods
of mining and then assigned him to
producing gold in Asiatic Russia.
He realized that this groat land
relatively unsettled and possessing
groat resources—could become to
Russian industrial life what tho
West had become to the United
States.
A period of settlement followed
the opening of the area. In 1929,
when many peasants objected to a
land plan then in operation, Stalin
saw the opportunity to send the I

Osusky said. "These with several

It was Lenin's idea to build the j
industries where the raw materials !
were, and his successor saw that it j

of the industries there. The shift of j
the industrial centers from the Do- |
netz, Leningrad, and Moscow areas j
to east of the Urals was strength- i
ened by the war. Dr. Osusky I
pointed out that the newly inde
pendent state of Out.'r Mongolia
between China and Russia would
undoubtedly be under Russian in
'luence.
Movement for Unity
Dr. Osusky stated that the new I
Russian movement for a com- j
mon spiritual unity superior to race i
and language developed apart from |
and rose above the two previous j
movements begun early in the nine- J
teenth century, which were the J
tendency to emulate Western Eu- I
rope and the opposite, to admire
Oriental ways.
The "Westernizers," such men as
Bakunin and Turgenev, wanted
Russia to imitate Western ways, but
not to go the same road politically
and socially, while the proponents
of the East, such as Dostoievsky,
considered the West gi'eedy, selfish,
and materialistic and admired the
wisdom of the Orientals.

Jan Masaryk, Czech statesman
and scholar of Russian history,
studied the question of whether
Russia was more of the East or of

Dr. Osusky said that it was not
until after the Revolution and in
192G that the first general plan for
the future of Russia was proposed
by the government.

common tendencies, such as those
in language, were more important
than common origins. For such a
unity a new system was required
and so the Bolshevik revolution had

In a careful description of the
shift of industrial Russia to east of
the Ural Mountains, Dr. Osusky
compared thr colonization of this
area to the colonization of America
during the period of the 13 colonies
and to the shift to the West in the
nineteenth century.
He related how in 1927 Joseph
Stalin sent a Soviet oil man to Cali
fornia and Alaska to learn methods
of mining and then assigned him to
producing gold in Asiatic Russia.
He realized that this groat land
relatively unsettled and possessing
groat resources—could become to
Russian industrial life what tho
West had become to the United
States.
A period of settlement followed
the opening of the area. In 1929,
when many peasants objected to a
land plan then in operation, Stalin
saw the opportunity to send the I

recalcitrant peasants to Asiatic ,
Russia. "These strong, Slavic peas- !
ants form the backbone of the world J
being made in Asiatic Russia," Dr.
Osusky said. "These with several
thousand nomads."
It was Lenin's idea to build the j
industries where the raw materials !
were, and his successor saw that it j
was done and a lai-ge part of the j
budget allotted to the development
of the industries there. The shift of j
the industrial centers from the Do- |
netz, Leningrad, and Moscow areas j
to east of the Urals was strength- i
ened by the war. Dr. Osusky I
pointed out that the newly inde
pendent state of Out.'r Mongolia
between China and Russia would
undoubtedly be under Russian in
'luence.
Movement for Unity
Dr. Osusky stated that the new I
Russian movement for a com- j
mon spiritual unity superior to race i
and language developed apart from |
and rose above the two previous j
movements begun early in the nine- J
teenth century, which were the J
tendency to emulate Western Eu- I
rope and the opposite, to admire
Oriental ways.
The "Westernizers," such men as
Bakunin and Turgenev, wanted
Russia to imitate Western ways, but
not to go the same road politically
and socially, while the proponents
of the East, such as Dostoievsky,
considered the West gi'eedy, selfish,
and materialistic and admired the
wisdom of the Orientals.
Vlasaryk's Studies
Jan Masaryk, Czech statesman
and scholar of Russian history,
studied the question of whether
Russia was more of the East or of
the West and pointed out the differ
ences of opinion among the Rus
sians.
Dr. Osusky said that it was not
until after the Revolution and in
192G that the first general plan for
the future of Russia was proposed
by the government.
Russia as a Unit
He claimed that Russia was a
geographical, climatic, and anlhro
poiogica! unit and maintained that
common tendencies, such as those
in language, were more important
than common origins. For such a
unity a new system was required
and so the Bolshevik revolution had
been inevitable.
Dr. Osusky, former Czech ambas
sador to France and chairman of
the Supervisory Committee of the
League of Nations, was introduced
by Herbert Jan Popper, professor of
music and director of the Opera
Workshop.—Pinkerton
