# 'New World' Influence of Asiatic Russia Discussed at Series In Czech Diplomat
## 
### 
The influence of the '"new world"
which is being built in Asiatic Rus
sia was declared by last night's
Tuesday Evening Series speaker,
J Dr. Stefan Osusky, to be one of the
"great questions of the future."
I Our Problem
: As his main point, Dr. Osusky,
former Czech diplomat, contended
that it is the duty of the peoples of
Western civilization to see that our
heritage of the individual man's
free will is not discarded by the
; new civilization in the making.
There has been a fusion of the
traditional Northern man—mystical
I and vigorous—and the traditional
| Southern man —skilled and intellec

movement of millions of peasants
j from the Ukraine and other Greater

' Dr. Osusky quoted the arguments
| of the Grand Inquisitor concerning
man's conscience in "The Brothers
Karamazov" by Dostoievsky as il-
I lustrative of the "spiritual drama of
the individual" and pointed out the

effect that the loss' of conscience
would have upon nations.
Industrial Shift
In a careful description of the
shift of industrial Russia to east of
the Ural Mountains, Dr. Osusky
compared thr colonization of this
area to the colonization of America
during the period of the 13 colonies
and to the shift to the West in the
nineteenth century.
He related how in 1927 Joseph
Stalin sent a Soviet oil man to Cali
fornia and Alaska to learn methods
of mining and then assigned him to
producing gold in Asiatic Russia.
He realized that this groat land
relatively unsettled and possessing
groat resources—could become to
Russian industrial life what tho
West had become to the United
States.
A period of settlement followed
the opening of the area. In 1929,
when many peasants objected to a
land plan then in operation, Stalin
saw the opportunity to send the I

spoke at last night's Tuesday
Evening Series.
