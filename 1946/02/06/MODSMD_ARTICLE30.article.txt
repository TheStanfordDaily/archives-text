# Gathering of the Tribe
## 
### 
One of (he most obvious of community
needs, that of an assembly at which all of
its members can gather, has been neglected
and shoved into the closet for so long a time
now that v/e feel it's a last chance to drag
out and resuscitate the abandoned, near
dead idea for all-University assemblies.
Since the beginning of the quarter Excom
has made efforts-—pretty feeble., we think—
to schedule an assembly; however, the last
report v/e heard on it was that the Commit
tee on Public Exercises would not consent
to cancel classes for a meeting in Memorial
Hall because the auditorium's capacity, 1,700,
would only accommodate 40 per cent of the

student body.
The suggestion was made that our next
assembly be held in Fiost Memorial Am
phitheater, and it is on this suggestion
that we hope Excom will act tomorrow.
Freshmen have been wondering why they
haven't had an opportunity to see the ASSU
en masse, to hear from their student body
chiefs and from their University president,
and to join in the Farm's yells, songs, and
hymns. Former students need a chance to
present issues, such as elections, the new
Constitution, and social conduct, before a
gathering of the entire Indian tribe.
Excom, what's your answer?
