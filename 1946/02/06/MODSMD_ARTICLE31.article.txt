About social conduct ... a cheer to ASSU
President Bob Kennedy and Vice-President
Charmian Kolar for conscientiously bringing
the subject out into the light from the dark
est corners of firesides where it was at its
worst.
Now that we've faced it, however, it's up to
men and women to establish good standards,

together. If in the past it has been said that
the responsibility rests mainly upon the
women, we say now that it is a joint respon
sibility and can only be carried out by a mu
tual understanding between Stanford men
and women.
Let's not indulge in blame-shoving when
it's a fifty-fifty world, but provide the solu
tion together.
