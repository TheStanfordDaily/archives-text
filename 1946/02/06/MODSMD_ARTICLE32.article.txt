Does your franchise get enough exercise?
Dc you practice the democracy our forefath
ers fought so hard to give to us? You have
a chance here at Stanford to participate in
one of the purest democracies since Pericles.
Tomorrow night at 7:30 the A.S.S.U.
Executive Committee holds its weekly meet
ing at the Old Union. The meeting is
open to the students, but no one is appar
ently inteiested enough in their own govern
ing body to appear.
The only persons not 'on Excom to attend
in recent months have been a lady of the
fourth estate and an occasional pressure
group. We're not asking for an overflow
crowd like the 300 that showed up one night
in '42 when they tried to make rugby a major
sport, but we do think it would be a healthy
sign if the members of this student commu
nity would share a little interest in their gov
ernment.
If you don't like the way things are being
run around here, don't get R.A.'d at your
R.A., come to Excom.

Last Sunday one of the girls in our corri
dor melted down five pounds of snow she
had scraped off the foothills and washed
her hair' with it.
One of the major cigarette companies has
hired a public relations attache here at
L.3.J.U. His principal job is to get publicity
for his weed by means other than advertis
ing, a difficult task at best. He asked us to
give his product a little word, but since the

Daily's policy is not to attempt to force any
commercial materials on the readers in the
editorial columns, this is not so easily done.
However, we think we've struck on a solu
tion that won't pollute you all, and at the
same time will allow him to send back con
crete evidence of his labors to his bosses,
and thereby collect his paycheck and stay in
school.
Here's the dodge. All readers will please
not read the following word. Chesterfield.

You'll all be happy to learn that Jim Pol
lard, former Farm basketball star, is leading
scorer in the American Basketball League. He
has scored 158 points in 10 games for a
highly respectable average of 15.8 counters
per encounter, playing for the seventh-place
San Diego Dons.
When Jim went into the service in '42 he
still had a year of eligibility left here. He
dropped down to the Farm last month to in
guire into the possibilities of returning for
his degree, and might possibly be back to
perform at our new Pavilion next winter.
Stanford is pretty well represented in the
A.B.L. Art "Stork" Stoefen, of the Luisetti
era, is with the L.A. Shamrocks, and Bill
Cowden, defensive star of our 1942 national
championship team, is with Dardie's Dandies
playing out of San Francisco. Five more
Farm alumni are with the Olympic Club team
now, which although not a member of the
league, plays egually good ball. They are
Don Burness, Ed Voss, Fred Linari, Jack
Heald, and Dave Brown.
