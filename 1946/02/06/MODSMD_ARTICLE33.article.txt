### ELLIOTT EPSTEEN 
The steel strike is-splitting Washington. Presi
dent Truman is getting different advice from dif
ferent, advisers, and is trying to reconcile the dif
ferences of his major bureaucrats.
Reconversion Director Snyder wants to settle
the steel strike by increasing prices and wages.
Chester Bowles, head of OPA, is against anything
but Â©very limited price increase.
President Truman has ordered the two to settle
their differences.
THEORY & PRACTICE
In theory, Chester Bowles is probably right. The
fabricators say that they cannot absorb a price in
crease and stay in business. Steel is essential to all
industries, in varying degree, so everything will
reflect a price rise forced on the fabricators.
To increase wages in the sfeel mills by raising
prices is to put money in one pocket of the worker
and rob it out of the other.
Yet the steel strike moves on. Canneries in
Texas, tractor factories in Now York, and other
establishments throughout the country are shutting
down and laying off men.
The government apparently feels that a seizure
of the mills might seem a little high-handed to too
many people. If the Administration took over steel,
it would control the heart of American industry,

and this might cause too much congressional reac
tion.
So the idea is to settle the strike as quickly as
possible and on any terms that both sides will
accept. That might be why the government favors
Mr. Snyder's stand.
FACT FINDING
Still, fact-finding boards have not gone to work.
It is true that the smaller mills are operating at a
loss. Still, the workers are on a difficult standard
of living. They want more money, and they will
have to get it or they won't go back.
However, fact-finding might still be useful. The
small operators claim to be in the red, and the big
ones maintain that they only break even by dis
tributing the profits of allied' industries which they
control.
However, the big mills, under the new corporate
tax law. could get a rebate of what they need from
previous taxes until the market lets them make a
profit.
It must further be remembered that the indus
try, by going below the President's suggested wage
compromise by only a few cents, could have figured
that it would take the strikers one week to make
back what they'd lose in one day of striking.
A seizure accompanied by the work of an im
paitial fact-finding board might still reveal some
very interesting things.
