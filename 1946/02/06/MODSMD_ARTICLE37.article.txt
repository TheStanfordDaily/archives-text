Mr. Gruliow has been representa
tive in Moscow for the American
Society for Russian Relief for the
! past two years. He was chosen in
1943 by that organization to visit the
Soviet Union to see how quickly
j supplies wore arriving there.
Reports received from Mr. Gru
liow in Moscow indicated that sup
i plies are reaching Russian families
within a few weeks after leaving
this area. **
In checking on distribution of
â–  supplies and the degree to which
they are meeting the needs of the
Russian people, he reported the
need is not in any way lessened in
spite of the war's end. Mr. Gruliow
also feels that the rehabilitation
1 problem in devastated areas is as
! great as ever.
