### ART LEVINSON 
For basketball-starved fans, the closest place this week-end
to take in a couple of noop contests is at Berkeley, where Cal
hooks up with the invading team from Los Angeles, ze Trojans of
SC fame. This series will probably decide who is going to cap
ture the PCC.
Both teams are now tied for the top slot with seven wins and
one defeat apiece. In their last series in the Angel City, the two
teams split the series, which accounts for one loss by each. After
this series for the two teams, Cal has only Stanford to meet to
complete the season, and USC takes on their cross-town rivals,
UCLA, in their final windup of conference campaigning. At the
present, it isn't too likely for either Stanford or UCLA to pull an
upset, as much as we hate to admit it.
WOLFE SHINES FOR CAL
Friday and Saturday's games over at Berkeley will feature
Andy Wolfe for Cal, and Bobby Kloppenburg for USC. These
two men are in a one-two position for high scoring honors, and
this weekend's games should decide who takes the mythical
trophy for high-point man.
Our own Indians travel south to engage the Bruins in a two
game series in Los Angeles. Westwood has steadily been on the
decline, and this writer looks forward to seeing Stanford win
ning at least one game, if not the series.
The progress of the Cardinals have been directly opposite
that of the Bruins. Starting out with an inexperienced sguad,
Stanford has been on the up-grade ever since. After each game,
a little more basketball savvy is tucked away by Everett Dean's
men, and gradually they Jiave become to resemble a college
quintet.
UCLA, on the other hand, started out early with a couple of
stars, but have fizzled out like Alka-Seltzer does—and like UCLA
teams do invariably in most sports. First to go v/as Arnold, and
then—via the injury route —Chuck Stewart.
If all goes well, the Daily will have a reporter at the games
in Los Angeles, so all you dear children can read all about the
games in your Monday morning Daily over that delicious cup of
coffee at the Cellar.
Now for a little history on Wilbur Johns, the UCLA basket
ball mentor. During his collegiate days, he v/as awarded four
letters in basketball—the frosh ruling being non-existent at that
time. In '25 he was captain of the team, and during his collegiate
days, he played on a team that won 36 out of 40 conference
games, which, we might add, isn't too bad.
Following the traditional sheepskin ceremonies, he was ap
pointed assistant varsity cage coach under Caddy Works. He
held that job until 1940, when he was appointed head coach.
The record book shows 18 wins and 37 losses since his reign as
head mentor. But for UCLA, that isn't a bad record at all. Pretty
good, in fact.
