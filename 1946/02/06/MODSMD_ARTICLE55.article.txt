# Schedule Looms For Rugby Team
## 
### 
There is a movement afoot to
popularize the game of rugby on the
Stanford campus. A team has al
ready been organized under the di
rection of Coach Pete Kmetovic, the
former great back of Indian football
glory days.
A definite schedule of games is
expected to be announced through
the athletic office this week. The
rugby team will probably have con
tests with teams representing Menlo
Park, the University of California,
the Olympic Club, and Petaluma.
Everybody Is Eligible
This sport, which is apparently
the most informal and purely ama
teur in the collegiate world, is open
to anyone registered in school. That
includes freshmen, graduate stu
dents. and part-time students. No
letters are earned, and not much
glory is obtained for participating.
Rugby enthusiasts play simply for
the sheer joy the game affords.
A few of the outstanding drib
blers and tacklers who are getting
their "kicks" these afternoons are
Bob Silva. Ray Chapat, and Harvey
Beinhart. They are expected to
sparkplug the squad until March 9,
when the season officially ends.
Working under the assumption
that you aren't acquainted with the
facts of rugby life, we have investi
gated and discovered three main
differences between it and the more
popular game of football:
A Few Rules
1. After a stoppage of play both
teams have equal chance of obtain
ing possession of the ball when it is
put back into play.
2. There is no forward passing in
,-ugby.
3. In rugby the ball is advanced

by dribbling it along the ground by
j the use of the feet.
4. All the players in a rugby
I game must be behind the ball;
i 0
I therefore there is no such thing as
running interference when advanc
} ing downfield and a man has really
i got to be shifty to break into the
' open.
5. There are no substitutions al
lowed for players who are thrown
out of the game on fouls.
6. A complete rugby team boasts
15 members.
7. Points are scored by making a
| "try" (same as touchdown), conver
| sioris after a try, dropped goals,
| penalty goals, and goals scored from
j fair catches.
; After players learn the funda-
I mentals of the game they are pretty
much on their own as the speed of
the game precludes any chance to
j work set plays.
