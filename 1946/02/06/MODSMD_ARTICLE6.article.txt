## 
### 
Dr. Donald B. Tresidder will ad
dress the joint seminar of the
Schools of Biological and Physical
Sciences on "Some Aspects of the
Problem of Federal Aid to Scientific
Research" this afternoon at 4:15 in
room 4 n <o of Jordan Hall.
At the present time there are sev
eral bills before Congress dealing
with this subject. One of these bills,
the framework of which was drawn
from the Vannevar Bush report on
"Science, the Endless Frontier," is
that of Senator Magnuson of Wash
'ngton.
Purpose of the bill is to carry
over to peacetime the advantages
of a national research program
which was carried out by the Of
fice of Scientific Research and
Development during the war.
Sole difference among the bills is
the method in. which the program
will be carried out. Many scientists
fear political pressure might enter
into the program and the govern
ment might interfere with the uni
versities in their scientific pro
grams.
Main support of the program
stems from the fact that with gov
ernment aid long-range research
will be able to be undertaken
whereas in the past projects only
lasted a year because of the lack
of certain money to insure their
completion.
