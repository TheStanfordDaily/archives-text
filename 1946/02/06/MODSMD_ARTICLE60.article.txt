# Encina Stops Lincoln Squad In Close Game
## 
### 
Intramural basketball play last
nijfht was marked by a close and
a one-sided contest as all games
came out according to predictions.
Lincoln succumbed to Encina 1W
in the last seconds of play by a
score of 24 to 23. The Encina quin
tet managed to stave off a last min
ute rally to pull out the win. Sparked
by Chuck Evans, who dropped 14
points to take scoring honors, the
winners outfought the Row boys,
particularly unde* the bucket. Fair
of Lincoln provided the most of his
team's points with 13 and acquitted
himself nicely on the floor.
In the lirst Pavilion game, the
Zcta Psi squad had an easy time
with Pierce Hall, coasting to a IS
to 12 win. Frank Mc€ann and Ed
Stanim topped the frat boys with
17 and 12 points respectively.
Stanrm looked a little more dainty
than in his football days, sinking
several from the pivot spot with
out the use of body contact.
The Pierce team was held to one
field goal in the second half.
The Legal Eagles showed that they
were still eager to repeat last year's
league - winning ways as they
trounced a fighting but inadequate
Jefferson five. Ken Husby and John
Hartvwell shone for the lawyers,
netting 9 and 7 points. But Jeff
made the • winners struggle, tying
the score at 10 to 10 before the halt
time gong. Wallis and Palance with
7 points each led the hall team.
In the second gym game, the Phi
Psis, rebounding from their deb
acle last week, trimmed Fillmore
27 to IS. Isut Coach Tom Hood's
charges almost gave the game
away. Leading 27 to 7 at half
time, the fiats slowed down and
were outscorcd 11 to 7 in the sec
ond half.
Ken Herrick and Luke Pitts
starred for the winners. Herrick
dropped 14 points and Pitts 8. Both
played outstanding lloor games,
working well in the floating zone
that their team used.
The intramural season is now
well under way, each team having
played two or three games. As yet,
no outstanding basketball players
have risen above their teammates.
But the flavor of the games has rad
ically changed since the beginning
of the season when every game was
a close, low-scored one. Lately,
some of the games have featured
frequent scoring. Whether this trend
away from the defense and toward
the offense will continue is not
certain, but the teams with the hot
scorers will be the ones to fear from
now until the close of the league

scorers will be the ones to fear from
now until the close of the league
Intramural basketball play last
nijfht was marked by a close and
a one-sided contest as all games
came out according to predictions.
Lincoln succumbed to Encina 1W
in the last seconds of play by a
score of 24 to 23. The Encina quin
tet managed to stave off a last min
ute rally to pull out the win. Sparked
by Chuck Evans, who dropped 14
points to take scoring honors, the
winners outfought the Row boys,
particularly unde* the bucket. Fair
of Lincoln provided the most of his
team's points with 13 and acquitted
himself nicely on the floor.
In the lirst Pavilion game, the
Zcta Psi squad had an easy time
with Pierce Hall, coasting to a IS
to 12 win. Frank Mc€ann and Ed
Stanim topped the frat boys with
17 and 12 points respectively.
Stanrm looked a little more dainty
than in his football days, sinking
several from the pivot spot with
out the use of body contact.
The Pierce team was held to one
field goal in the second half.
The Legal Eagles showed that they
were still eager to repeat last year's
league - winning ways as they
trounced a fighting but inadequate
Jefferson five. Ken Husby and John
Hartvwell shone for the lawyers,
netting 9 and 7 points. But Jeff
made the • winners struggle, tying
the score at 10 to 10 before the halt
time gong. Wallis and Palance with
7 points each led the hall team.
In the second gym game, the Phi
Psis, rebounding from their deb
acle last week, trimmed Fillmore
27 to IS. Isut Coach Tom Hood's
charges almost gave the game
away. Leading 27 to 7 at half
time, the fiats slowed down and
were outscorcd 11 to 7 in the sec
ond half.
Ken Herrick and Luke Pitts
starred for the winners. Herrick
dropped 14 points and Pitts 8. Both
played outstanding lloor games,
working well in the floating zone
that their team used.
The intramural season is now
well under way, each team having
played two or three games. As yet,
no outstanding basketball players
have risen above their teammates.
But the flavor of the games has rad
ically changed since the beginning
of the season when every game was
a close, low-scored one. Lately,
some of the games have featured
frequent scoring. Whether this trend
away from the defense and toward
the offense will continue is not
certain, but the teams with the hot
scorers will be the ones to fear from
now until the close of the league
