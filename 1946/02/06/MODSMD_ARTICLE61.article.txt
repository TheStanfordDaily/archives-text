# PCC Chances Poor For Stanford Quintet
## 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
Stanford's chances for a confer
| -Â»nce triumph skidded to a new low
j today when it was learned that Jim
: Hill, stellar forward mainstay until
! last week, had decided to leave
I .school for the remainder of the
; quarter.
Hill Returns to Texas
Acting on the advice of his pro
i fessors following a two-week ab
| sence from school due to an injury
I incurred against U.C.L.A. several
! weeks ago and his separation from
the Navy last week. Hill planned to
| return to Texas next week with his
j wife.
Hill was advised that it would be
I almost impossible to satisfactorily
| make up the work he had missed.
| and that he should drop out of
| school for the quarter rather than
take the chance of failing. The
young Texan, however, planned to
return to the Farm for th? 1946 fall
quarter.
Dismal Outlook
The loss of llill practically
sewed up Stanford's most dismal
season in years in conference bas
ketball. Unless (lie Indians, " now
more than ever but a Thin Red
i Line, can rise to overcome the
loss of the speedy, steady floor
work and excellent shooting of
the six-foot former sailor, U.C.-
i L.A. seems due for two more vic
tories this week-end in Los An
geles.
I Hill was absent from the linkup
for the Southern Cal seri?s, and it is
I quite possible that his presence
could .have salvaged at least one of
those contests from the Trojans,
j Both games, and particularly the

first, were closer than the actual
scores implied. The score in the
first game was 48-36. the tally in
field goals being 18 to 15, and three
field goals is not too much to ex
uect from a player ol Hill's caliber,
who tallied 17 points in one game
against the sam; team earlier this
reason.
Two other items have come to
light to plague the Indians in their
efforts for at least one P.C.C. tri
umph this season. First, that Capt.
Bill Christiansen adds a bad cold
which accounts for his poor show
ing against U.S.F. Saturday- to his
collection of bruises, bumps, sprains,
and aches. The other is that Jack
Wood, a better than average guard,
is still troubled by a sprained ankle
that caused him to be removed mid
way in the Saturday game, and
failed to turn up for practice Mon
day night.
However, according to Coach Ev
erett Dean, the slick up-eourt man
was due out last night and is still
listed on the traveling roster for
the U.C.L.A. series.
