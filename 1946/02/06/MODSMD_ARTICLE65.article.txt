# New Crisis Threatens In Greece
## 
### 
LONDON. Feb. 5 (UP).—Delegates
of the big powers, abandoning their
policy of open-door diplomacy in
face of a major crisis, met secretly
in a back room of the United Nations
Security Council chamber tonight in
a desperate attempt to find a solu
tion of the British-Russian dispute
on the presence of British troops in
Greece.
They conferred for two hours—
and failed to reach agreement.
While the backroom conferences
still were in progress, Security
Council President Norman J. O. Ma
kin'adjourned the meeting until to
morrow night and delegates left the
council chamber.
Tlu> Council met at 9:05 p.m.
after a day of futile attempts to
find a compromise which would
shelve Russia's complaint that the
British troops were a threat to
peace. Makin offered the sugges
ton that the dispute be ended with
a statement by him that in (he
general view there was no threat.
Polish delegate Zygmund Modze
lewski asked and obtained a recess
while he tried to put over a compro
mise of his own. He read the pro
posal to British foreign secretary
Ernest Bevin, who turned it down
cold.
