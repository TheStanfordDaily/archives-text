# Records of Contemporary Poets at Weekly Reading
## 
### 
Phonograph recordings of con
temporary poets reading their own
poems, played at the weekly poetry
reading yesterday afternoon, raised
the question as to whether poets
were the best readers of their own
works.
The first recording played was the
long narrative poem, "Death of the
Hired Man," by Robert Frost. Edna
St. Vincent Mil lay over-dramatized
her "Ballad of the Harp-Weaver."
According to Prof. James Work,
who played the recordings, this rec
ord was the only one in her album
that was very well read. T. S. Eliot
(who reads much like Mr. Winters
of the English Department or Mr.
Cunningham, formerly of the de
partment) read his "The Hollow
Men."
Selections from "Making of the
New World" were read by Archi
bald MacLeish. Two of the "fres
coes" read were "Wild West" and
"Empire Builders," which describe
the making of America, in five pan
els. •
E. E. Cummings, who, according
to Mr. Work, is easier to understand
when he reads his own poetry, read
one of his few poems with a title,
"Poem, or Beauty Hurts Mr. Vinal."

This is a clever poem, and even if
it isn't understood is enjoyable.
From"The People, Yes" Carl
Sandburg read "Prejudice," which
is concerned with the color red. In
conclusion a mechanically poor re
cording of Vachel Lindsay reading
"The Congo" was played. Although
the words could not always be dis
tinguished, the strange rhythm of
the poem was easily noted.
For those who wished to stay af
ter 5 p.m. Mr. Work read two other
poems by Cummings, "In Spring"
and the short "Buffalo Bill," and
"Gerontion" by Eliot.—Barlow
