# Campus Has 6-Day Wait Till Chappie
## 
### 
There are just six more shopping
days till Chappie Day.
This issue of the Chaparral will
mark the first time in the annals
of college humor magazines that
the February edition of the pub
lication has not featured Valen
tine's Day. This startling new de
parture is just another "first" in
that long list of achievements
chalked up by the local chapter
of Hammer and Coffin.
Editor-in-chief Bob Reiser, al
ready deep in the preparation of the
March number, was not readily
available for a statement. However,
he did send the following word
down through his secretary; "This
year February has neither 28 nor
29 â€”it has 36; 36 big pages dedi
cated to the enjoyment of laugh
ter."
"I'm sure we'll lose money," Bus
iness Manager Boris Wolper was
quoted as saying. "I can't see how
anyone could offer so much reading
pleasure for only 25 cents and still
show a profit, but we'll try."
