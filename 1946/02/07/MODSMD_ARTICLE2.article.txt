# Russia, Britain Agree on Greece As UNO Overcomes First Crisis
## Vishinsky Uses Stettinius Plan In Breaking Three-Day Deadlock 
### 
LONDON, Feb. 6 (UP).â€”Russia tonight withdrew her charge
that British troops in Greece threatened peace and the United
Nations Security Council thus overcame the first great crisis of
its brief career.
Russian Vice-Foreign Commissar Andrei I. Vishinsky broke

a dangerous three-day deadlock, in
the Council when he offered a com
promise based on a proposal United
States Chief Delegate Edward R.
Stettinius, Jr., had made Tuesday
night.
Vishinsky Backs Down
Backing down completely from
the stand he had taken against Brit
ish policy in Greece, Vishinsky pro
posed :
1. The Council would take no
formal action and would pass no
formal resolution on the Greek dis
pute.
2. Norman J. O. Makin, Austra
lian President of the Council, would
make a statement on Greece incor
porating previous declarations by
the United States, Britain, Russia,
Greece, France, China, the Neth
erlands, and Egypt.
Bevin Takes Back Demand
Bevin in turn backed down from
his demand that the Council give
Britain a straight vote of guilty or
not guilty on the Russian charges.
On the basis of VLshinsky's pro
posal, the Council formally closed
the Greek dispute which had threat
ened to cripple the infant UNO.
Stettinius in accepting the Russian
proopsal said:
"I wish to make it clear that my
remarks of several days ago stand."
These remarks were that British
troops in Greece did not endanger
peace. Likewise, Greece. France,
China, and Egypt had backed Brit
ain in its Greek policy.
Moscow Instructions
Vishinsky apparently received in
structions from Moscow authoriz
ing him to change his stand. He had
threatened to invoke Russia's veto
power in the Security Council to
prevent a vote on any solution
which did not mention a British
promise to withdraw troops from
Greece as soon as possible.
