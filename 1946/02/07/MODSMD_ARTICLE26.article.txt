i Fight to keep our col-ors high
I And prove to them our powers.
We're behind you Stanford men,
so—
Go it all the way. FIGHT!
And when the hat-tic's won
We'll cheer the red and white.
(Original music accompanied the
i song, by Burton Wilner, '47, and

(Tune: "How You Going to Keep
Them Down on the Farm?")
1 How are you gfring to keep us
on the Farm
After we've scalped U.C.?
How arc you goin' to keep us
away from Berkeley,
Paintin' the town, tearin' it
down?
How's the Golden Bear going to
keep his ground?
That's a mystery.
We have seen the Berkeley coeds
draggin' around.
But the Stanford cuties are a
thing of renown.
How arc you goin' to keep us
down on the Farm
After we've scalped U.C.?
