# Monteux, S.F. Symphony Win Farm Audience In Performance of Prokofieff, Other Moderns
## 
### TED HOFFMAN 
Pic* vrc Monteux again proved
himself to be one of the finest in
terpreters of modern composers last
night. He has a certain apprecia
tion and understanding of music
written since the turn of the cen
tury that few American conductors
possess, and he ably demonstrated
it in the program of the San Fran
cisco Symphony at Memorial Hall.
Maestro Monteux immediately
won the favor of the audience be
cause of his genial and likable per
sonality, and quickly gained its re
spect by his superb musicianship.
Opened with Dvorak
The program began with Dvorak's
"Roman Carnival," which was the
oldest selection presented. This
work is so familiar that little needs
to be said about it except that it
was performed with great zest.
The finesse and brilliance dis
played by Monteux in his handling
of the "Classical Symphony"
brought out clearly the undeniable,
but very likable ,air of sarcasm that
permeates this inimitable Proko
fieff work. He demonstrated the
clarity and vigor of ProkofiefT's
short symphony so well that the
Stokowski - Philadelphia recorded
version seems inferior by compari
son.
Anxiously awaited was the third
piece, by a Stanford graduate, Wil
liam Bergsma. Called "Music on a

Quiet Theme," it was a very satis
fying work. The theme itself had a
broad appeal, and fine craftsman
ship and imagination were dis
played in the ensuing variation,
which eventually achieved a splen
did climax. Especially noteworthy
was the mature orchestration.
If Bergsma, who is now only 25,
continues to develop, there is no
doubt that he will be one of the
best American composers. He seems
to have escaped the most dangerous
pitfall of many young composers,
that is, an excessive, self-conscious
use of dissonant harmonies.
Ibrrt "Movie Muscic"
Most of the audience was very
enthusiastic about "Escales (Ports
of Call)" by Ibert, but the best
thing that might be said about it is
that it was good movie music. The
"Tunis-Ncfta" movement had all
the hackneyed earmarks of "mys
terious Eastern music," and despite
its finished orchestration and suit
able themes, it is not the type of
music some of us would want to
hear again. "Valencia" sounded
suspiciously like the "Rhapsodie
Espagole" of Chabrier in spots.
The Chausson symphony just
misses being truly great music. It
is very pleasing, at times inspiring,
but lacks that ability to create a
lasting efToct which seems vital to
a monumental work.
A word must be said in favor

jof the orchestra itself. Their musi
cianship was practically flawless,
I their response to Monteux's baton
admirable. It ranks with the five
I or six best orchestras in the United
States.

written since the turn of the cen
tury that few American conductors
possess, and he ably demonstrated
it in the program of the San Fran
cisco Symphony at Memorial Hall.
Maestro Monteux immediately
won the favor of the audience be
cause of his genial and likable per
sonality, and quickly gained its re
spect by his superb musicianship.
Opened with Dvorak
The program began with Dvorak's
"Roman Carnival," which was the
oldest selection presented. This
work is so familiar that little needs
to be said about it except that it
was performed with great zest.
The finesse and brilliance dis
played by Monteux in his handling
of the "Classical Symphony"
brought out clearly the undeniable,
but very likable ,air of sarcasm that
permeates this inimitable Proko
fieff work. He demonstrated the
clarity and vigor of ProkofiefT's
short symphony so well that the
Stokowski - Philadelphia recorded
version seems inferior by compari
son.
Anxiously awaited was the third
piece, by a Stanford graduate, Wil
liam Bergsma. Called "Music on a

Quiet Theme," it was a very satis
fying work. The theme itself had a
broad appeal, and fine craftsman
ship and imagination were dis
played in the ensuing variation,
which eventually achieved a splen
did climax. Especially noteworthy
was the mature orchestration.
If Bergsma, who is now only 25,
continues to develop, there is no
doubt that he will be one of the
best American composers. He seems
to have escaped the most dangerous
pitfall of many young composers,
that is, an excessive, self-conscious
use of dissonant harmonies.
Ibrrt "Movie Muscic"
Most of the audience was very
enthusiastic about "Escales (Ports
of Call)" by Ibert, but the best
thing that might be said about it is
that it was good movie music. The
"Tunis-Ncfta" movement had all
the hackneyed earmarks of "mys
terious Eastern music," and despite
its finished orchestration and suit
able themes, it is not the type of
music some of us would want to
hear again. "Valencia" sounded
suspiciously like the "Rhapsodie
Espagole" of Chabrier in spots.
The Chausson symphony just
misses being truly great music. It
is very pleasing, at times inspiring,
but lacks that ability to create a
lasting efToct which seems vital to
a monumental work.
A word must be said in favor

jof the orchestra itself. Their musi
cianship was practically flawless,
I their response to Monteux's baton
admirable. It ranks with the five
I or six best orchestras in the United
States.
Pic* vrc Monteux again proved
himself to be one of the finest in
terpreters of modern composers last
night. He has a certain apprecia
tion and understanding of music
written since the turn of the cen
tury that few American conductors
possess, and he ably demonstrated
it in the program of the San Fran
cisco Symphony at Memorial Hall.
