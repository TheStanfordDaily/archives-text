# Communism for France?
## 
### 
In regarding the recent political trends in
France the "irrevocable" au revoir of de
Gaulle, conflict over the French constitution,
and the rise to theoretical power of compro
mise candidate Felix Gouin—one can well
question not whether the trend is good or
bad, but whether it is not inevitable. And
upon further thought the question might well
arise will today's nominal "socialism" re
solve itself into practical communism.
De Gaulle has passed from f he scene much
as did Chu^hill —he was a man to direct a
nation at war, to give grit and glory to its
fighters and conduct foreign relations proud
ly and uncompromisingly. With the return
to "peace" and the expectancy of the French
that the food-and-fuel situation would inevi
tably be looking up, de Gaulle alarmingly
emphasized national defense to display a
French brand of power politics.
But the people of France needed more than
political recognition, and turned to the left
wing Socialist and Communist groups in
their government who were promising to
break the black market, to restore transpor
tation facilities, and to bring coal and food
into French homes. De Gaulle was unable
to head a government that opposed him in
questions of cabinet representation and con
stitutional change, and so he resigned.
Communists in France are now the best
organized of all the parties, and although
party leaders undoubtedly receive their or
ders from Moscow, their prestige has in
creased tremendously through their demon
stration of loyalty to France during the war
and their ability now to "get things done" in
answer to the people's wants. The French
man has an avowed fear of communism, but
may be hoodwinked into support of its
French counterpart by its subtle "boring from
within," by cooperating with the party un
der the guise of such organizations as the
Front Nationale, and through its domination
of such coalition groups as the present cab
inet. For today's cabinet, though tri-partite,
is under Communist control.
The Communist proposal that Thorez be

come president on the resignation of de
Gaulle was greeted with much protest from
the conservative MRP, but it was not too
great a sacrifice for the Communists to back
down and place Socialist Gouin at the head.
Their negotiations for aid from other nations
had more hope of success if not under the
name of "Communist"; and direct Communist
coup would lead France to be isolated dip
lomatically from England and America and
to ally her openly with Moscow, who could
provide them little. The Communists are
now figuratively holding the same bag which
was too heavy for de Gaulle—they want the
coal in the Ruhr and an import of foodstuffs,
they want oil and transportation resumption.
Unless they come through with an answer to
the French problem they will fail too.
However the Communists are laying the
groundwork for control of the government
in their proposals for the constitution—they
are asking a strong legislature and a com
parative weak executive. France's multi
party system has in the past demonstrated it
self to be ineffectual: nearly every three
months there would be a new prime minister
and cabinet to replace one that could not
gain supporters. To perpetuate this system
would be to disperse any hope for a unified
and powerful central government; either a
two-party system or a strong executive
branch would be able to actually hold the
govcernment together. It would seem that
the Communists know this and by maintain
ing this form of government would be sub
jecting a system or representation to dis
credit and laying the way for a strongly
backed party coup.
The main hope is in the backers of com
munism themselves. If they—and they will
all claim loyalty first to France and not to an
international ideal—wish to divert a pure
Communist movement in the interests of a
strong nation, they probably can. But if the
rank-and-file Communists are not awake, or
if the body of them are convinced of the ad
visability for an alliance with the USSR, the
show could be over in a few years. BMV

questions of cabinet representation and con

Communists in France are now the best
organized of all the parties, and although
party leaders undoubtedly receive their or
ders from Moscow, their prestige has in
creased tremendously through their demon
stration of loyalty to France during the war
and their ability now to "get things done" in
answer to the people's wants. The French
man has an avowed fear of communism, but
may be hoodwinked into support of its
French counterpart by its subtle "boring from
within," by cooperating with the party un
der the guise of such organizations as the
Front Nationale, and through its domination
of such coalition groups as the present cab
inet. For today's cabinet, though tri-partite,
is under Communist control.
The Communist proposal that Thorez be

come president on the resignation of de
Gaulle was greeted with much protest from
the conservative MRP, but it was not too
great a sacrifice for the Communists to back
down and place Socialist Gouin at the head.
Their negotiations for aid from other nations
had more hope of success if not under the
name of "Communist"; and direct Communist
coup would lead France to be isolated dip
lomatically from England and America and
to ally her openly with Moscow, who could
provide them little. The Communists are
now figuratively holding the same bag which
was too heavy for de Gaulle—they want the
coal in the Ruhr and an import of foodstuffs,
they want oil and transportation resumption.
Unless they come through with an answer to
the French problem they will fail too.
However the Communists are laying the
groundwork for control of the government
in their proposals for the constitution—they
are asking a strong legislature and a com
parative weak executive. France's multi
party system has in the past demonstrated it
self to be ineffectual: nearly every three
months there would be a new prime minister
and cabinet to replace one that could not
gain supporters. To perpetuate this system
would be to disperse any hope for a unified
and powerful central government; either a
two-party system or a strong executive
branch would be able to actually hold the
govcernment together. It would seem that
the Communists know this and by maintain
ing this form of government would be sub
jecting a system or representation to dis
credit and laying the way for a strongly
backed party coup.
The main hope is in the backers of com
munism themselves. If they—and they will
all claim loyalty first to France and not to an
international ideal—wish to divert a pure
Communist movement in the interests of a
strong nation, they probably can. But if the
rank-and-file Communists are not awake, or
if the body of them are convinced of the ad
visability for an alliance with the USSR, the
show could be over in a few years. BMV
