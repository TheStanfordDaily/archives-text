# The 						Veteran Takes Stock
## 
### 
Stanford veterans and faculty members on
Veterans' Committee will get together to
night at 7:30 in Cubberley Auditorium to
swap ideas and hold an open bull session on
various phases of Farm life.
The Committee promises a well-rounded
dispersal of information; and we'll take our
chances on the vets for coming through with

questions and constructive criticism to pro
vide a strong, intelligent discussion; for by
now they've had half a quarter in which to
observe Stanford, spot their place in cam
pus affairs, and formulate personal opinions.
We think tonight's meeting should have
results which are something unusual in the
way of interest to the whole campus, as well
as to our veterans.
