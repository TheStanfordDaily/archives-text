In an attempt to save several hours of "your
study time, we sacrificed last evening to determine
the results of this latest running of the Plus-Minus
Derby. With Bawlout in one hand, fine-tooth comb
in the other and slide rule between clenched teeth
we arrived at the following decisions:
.Jacobs comma Audrey Madelyn at 165 plus .108
•re t.s the horseshoe of forget-me-nots around her
neck for first place.'
We attempted to contact the young lady in
order to be first to congratulate her and aLso to
obtain an exclusive interview before the wire serv
ices picked up the story. However, she lives in
Blngme and we were unable to get the O.K. of the
business manager and Publications Council to put
the call through.
Undaunted, however, we put in a reverse-

charged call to Miss Jacqueline Canfield at Ber
trand Russell House. With a record of 132 plus
250 she deserves the shot of benzadrine for honor
able mention.
At 1:15 this morning the correct call was finally
put through and the yawning interviewee wrapped
herself around the other end of the wire. Using
our best summa-cum-laude vocab we parried with
her as follows:
He (minus three): "Howja do it?"
She (plus two five six): "By not mentally mas
ticaling the Student Directory and calling parties
on the ameche in the wee small, thank you."
The winners on the other end of the scale posed
a difficult problem. We were undecided between
an inexperienced - but - on - the - way 0 - 28 and a
hardy-perennial 210-84. Compromised by calling
both with no results.
• One was out at a movie. The other, just out.
