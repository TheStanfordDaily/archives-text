# HISTORYâ€”1946

### ELLIOTT EPSTEEN 
The Chinese civil war has theoretically come to
an end. The negotiations did not favor either party,
which is good, but they also did not help the Chi
nese people much.
There will be a theoretically unified army, and
a unicameral parliament whose members will be
nominated by the President. The membership is
split up among the parties with the Kuomingtang
holding a majority.
However, both the Communists and the Nation
alists control different sections of the country.
China is still split, although now merely at peace
with herself.
CHINESE SPLIT
Moreover, it is still probable that both sides will
keep a watchful eye on each other. Chiang prom
ise) co-operation with the left in 1928. Stalin an
nounced this triumphantly to the Communist party
congress in that year. When the delegates walked
out onto the streets, they picked up papers saying
that Chiang had launched a surprise attack on
Shanghai, lining up and shooting the trade union
ists and the Communist workers.
On the other side, when Chiang was launching
I lis campaign against the warlords before the 1928
schism, the Communist armies marched with him.

They shot up the foreign embassies at Nanking, in
order to make an awful lot of trouble for their
supposed commander.
TOTALITARIAN REGIMES
Also both the Nationalists and the Communists
are strictly disciplined, totalitarian regimes. When
Sun Yat-sen did a half-turn left in the twenties be
cause the imperialist states were isolating China,
Stalin sent M. Borodin, a former school teacher in
Chicago who went home to Russia when the revo
lution came, to organize the Kuomingtang on Com
munist lines.
He soon developed a highly centralized, tightly
.controlled party, and each side soon used his or
ganization mechanism.
FUTURE
It seems that Chiang and the Communists have
signed little more than an armistice. Both sides
will probably vise their organization and arms to
continue the maneuvering for power.
The Chinese people are caught in the middle.
The progressive parties in the middle, who have
been above the sordidness of Chinese politics, are
still negligible factors working for reform rather
than control. Really, what seems to be actually
coming about is nothing more than a breather for
both sides.
