) It's not the general policy of
J Slants to go around pickin' bones
j with other newspapers, but a col
| umn appeared ip the San Francisco
I News the other night by Bud Spen
| cer that—we think—deserves a little
| rebuttal.
Mr. Spencer—who was an out
standing track star at Stanford dur
ing his college days—gave pro foot
ball a hearty pat on the back when
he statpd that there was no reason
(.hat football players should be col
lege graduates in order to play in
the big-time pro circuit. That it
was the private business of every
person what he wanted to do, and
that no college should attempt to
prevent a student from earning a
living, whether it be picking or
anges at Anaheim or playing pro
fessional football for the Buffalo
Zipperoes, or whatever you call 'em.
In the first place, Mr. Spencer
overlooks a big fact. In football,
where there is direct physical
contact, could IS- and 19-vear

olds play in games throughout the
season against older and more
mature men? The quick answer
to that one is always the reference
to the College All-Stars versus
National League champions in
! Chicago every fall.
j In return, the answer to that is
; the fact that—in normal years—that
! game represents college seniors;
| men who have had two or three
i years of college ball behind them;
men who are ready to take part in
I pro ball themselves. Besides, that
is only one game. Could the same |
aggregation keep up that kind of
play for 11 or 12 weeks straight?
Men direct from high school sure
ly need a little seasoning before
jumping into competition with
Bronco Nagurskis, Sid Luckmans,
I Frankie Alberts, and Bruno Ban
duccis. Would Mr. Spencer permit
his son to play in such competition
just after he finished high school?
(He is kind enough to let the fel
: lows receive then high school sheep
skins.)
Point number two. It is to the
direct benefit of pro teams to let i
men go through colleges before j
signing them up. As long as pro
loops don't have a Well-developed
farm system to hand out the more
inexperienced hands, colleges pro
vide a beautiful stop-gap. He
sides totin' the pigskin for dear
old alma mater, a little book
learnin', which doesn't hurt any- :
one, is thrown in besides. When
a football player graduates from
college, he is a seasoned and ma- |
ture man, ready to mix it up j
with all comers, whether they be !
a mammoth from Texas State or
a scatback from the University of
Maine.
If the pro clubs had junior cir
cuits that took into consideration
age and experience, the tale we are
relatin' wouldn't be worth a hoot
in Hades, but at the present, the
professional outfits don't have a
"'minor league system."
And instead of developing play
ers at the team's expense, they get ;
an experienced man from college J
who has enough on the ball to [
step right in and play football. |
high-class football that costs the •
team owners nothing besides a
little patience waiting for the j
players to complete their four- j
year tenure at a university.
Under this seiup everybody should
be happy. Colleges can make a go
of football. Club owners get de
veloped men. And the players in
most instances are provided with
an athletic scholarship while at
college. If this plan is followed by
all pro leagues, then nobody has a
legitimate gripe coming.
Is that a satisfactory answer to
the B. Spencer type? If not, let's
hear from you.
