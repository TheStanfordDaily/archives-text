## Indian Quintet To Travel South 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
The hopes of Stanford's basket
mall team, which yesterday skidded
to rock-bottom, today seemed in
clined to remain there, pending the
appearance of what would be at
least a minor miracle to lift them
out of the doldrums.
Yesterday, Jim Hill left school,
and today Coach Everett Dean
crossed another name from the
traveling roster, and placed a ques
tion mark aft?r another.
11 Go to Los Angeles
That left no more than 11 players
due to take the trip to Los Angeles
on the Daylight this morning, and
quite possibly only tenâ€”and not the
ten best either.
Jack Wood, a smart, fast, smooth
workinb ball-handler on the back
court and the most effective sub
stitute for the regular guards, was
crossed off the travel roster when
his sprained ankle, suffered in the
U.S.F. game Saturday, failed to re
spond properly to treatment.
What might possibly be construed
as having more importance on the
chances of the team down south
against the Uclans is the condition
of regular guard Tom Rodman, who
missed practice Tuesday night, be
ing laid in bed with a nasty case
of the flu.
Martin Might Shift
In the event that Rodman does
not make the trip, or is incapable
of playing against the Bruins, Coach
Dean will shift Gene Martin from
his regular forward spot to guard.
However, Martin will be shifted
only in case of extreme emergency,
which appears to be imminent.
The shifting of Martin appears to

| be the lesser of two evils, for the
j Indians possess enough effective
' subs for the up-court positions.
However, the move would handicap
: the Tribe by placing two compara
! tively short men at guard, and also
remove Martin from the close-up
i spot where he recently found his
j shooting eye.
Hood at Forward
In the event that Martin is shifted
: to guard, Jack Meredith will team
up with Tom Hood at the forward
j spots, and Capt. Bill Christiansen,
still under the weather with a bad
cold, will hold down the other guard
slot. At center it will be either Tom
Murphy or Bill O'Brien, probably
| the former.
The players making the trip will
be Martin, Hood, Meredith, Murphy,
O'Brien, Christiansen, Rodman, Max
King, Amby Rosehill. George Sloat,
and Ed Lefcourt, besides Coach
Dean and the trainer.
