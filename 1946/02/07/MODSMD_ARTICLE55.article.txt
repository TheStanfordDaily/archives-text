## 
### 
Stanford veterans, whose education here was interrupted by the war,
and who are now in need of funds to continue their studies here, may
apply for the Stanford Scholarship Fund with Miss Olivia Byler, scholar
ship secretary, at her ofliee in the Ad Building, A.S.S.U. President Bob
Kennedy announced yesterday.
Formerly known as Dimes for Diplomas, the Stanford Scholarshio Fund

was established in 1943 as an A.S.-
S.U. project. Money for the fund
comes from campus drives, 30 per
cent of the proceeds going to the
fund, Kennedy said.
Four awards under the fund have
already been given this year, he
added, and applications made this
quarter will be decided upon early
next quarter. Amounts in each
award vary, and are determined by
the needs pf the applicant.
The Committee on Scholarships
will call for applications early each
quarter, but needy Stanford veter
ans may apply at any time.
"The awards are given in accord
ance with the provisions of the
Scholarship Fund, and are given to
needy Stanford veterans whose
records show that they deserve to
continue their education and will
be of value to their country by so
doing," Kennedy concluded.
