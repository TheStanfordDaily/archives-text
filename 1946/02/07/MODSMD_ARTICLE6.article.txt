Lower Lounge of the Women's
â–  Clubhouse.
This is the second in the winter

Mr. White will tell why the Mor

rection of Brigham Young. The
i Mormons were the first Anglo-Sax -
j ons to use irrigation! in the United
States, according to the speaker.
"There Ls no place where geogra
j phy and history are so intimately
! combined as in Utah," said Mr.

many times. In history the Mor

j and I will explain how geography
took possession of the people who
J lived there."
Mr. White will also contrast Utah,
\ an agricultural state, and Nevada, a
j mining state.
