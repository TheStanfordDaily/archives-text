Hang your Arrow Ties on
the wrong side of your bed!
When you wake up on the grouch side some A.M.
. . . with a tough day of textbook-tussling ahead
. . . don't reach for your Luger. Relax. Put on a
bright Arrow Tie!
Nothing like a splash of that tasteful-but-terrific
Arrow pattern to cheer you up. And the ease with
which you tie a perfect knot in it is soothing, sir,
definitely soothing.
Your dealer has plenty of Arrow l ies, in colors
and patterns that please.
