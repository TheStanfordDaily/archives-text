# Weekend Brings Tyler, Sadie Hawkins Dances
## Stanford Sadies Out To Trap Their Men 
### JOAN WONDER 
Once again Sadie Hawkins Day comes to the
Farm, and with it the chance of the year for
Stanford gals to take advantage of that new
ratio and track down their Li'l Abners for the

quarter's biggest dance.
Tradition has made this a "back
ward" dance ever since the distant
days of the real Sadie Hawkins,
who, being on the rude, crude, and
unattractive side, had to have a

running start in
order to snare
her man. We
Stanford women,
it is true, are in
need of no such
advantage, but
for some strange
reason the tradi
tion has persist
ed and on this
one night each

Farm Daisy Mae must trap her man,
call for him, and maybe even pro
vide him with a Dogpatch corsage
of skunkweed and carrots.
Award to Be Given
Competition for the surprise !
award for the most originally cos- ]
turned couple is expected to be j

in keeping with the backwoods j

theme will be
the music, sup
plied by Art
Weidner and his
modern rhythm
ensemble.

be greeted by a
Pavilion hung
