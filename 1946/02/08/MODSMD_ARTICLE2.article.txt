President Bob Kennedy at a meet
ing yesterday afternoon that a few
of the halls were giving the whole

the great majority of the firesides
and dances given by men's living
groups were in good taste and in
keeping with acceptable social stand
ards.
Believing the effect of additional
rules to be harmful rather than ben
eficial, the men decided to take the
problem back to their groups, and
to take positive action themselves if
the halls in violation persisted in
their objectionable practices, Ken

"This is a very good example of
how Stanford students can get to
gether to solve their own problems
through their student government,"
Kennedy said.
