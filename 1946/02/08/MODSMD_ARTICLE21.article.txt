# Strike-Control Bill Passed; Europe Must Be Fed—Truman
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 (UP).—
j The House today passed, 258 to 155,
j a far - reaching strike - control bill
which makes both labor and man
agement liable to penalties for vio
lating contracts, bans strike vio
lence, and sets up a national medi
ation board.
Spurred by widespread work
I stoppages, a strong Republican -
| Southern Democratic coalition beat
j down all attempts to soften the
| measure.
i The bill was sponsored by Repre
sentative Francis Case, R., S.D., as
a substitute for the House Labor
Committee's diluted version of
President Truman's fact - fuiding
measure. It is perhaps the most re
strictive anti-strike legislation ever
passed and is designed primarily to
curb stoppages in industries involv
ing the national welfare.
Pro-laborites look to the Senate
j to emasculate it or water it down,
j The Senate Education and Labor
Committee is considering much
milder legislation and there is not
I much sentiment in the chamber for
I hasty action.
