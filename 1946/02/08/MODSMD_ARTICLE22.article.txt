## 
### 
PALO ALTO. Feb. 7 (UP).—
Stanford University officials sought
a way tonight to remove a heavy
coating of tar which was sprayed
over the entrance to the Hoover Li
brary and the pillars and pavement
of Memorial Court by unknown
persons last night.
Police Chief Gordon Davis said
the tar had been applied in such a
way as to read "Cal," "U.C.," and
"Bears." He said he did not believe
students of the University of Cali
fornia were the culprits since no
athletic contest between the two
schools is scheduled at this time.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 (UP).— I
President Truman said loday thai !
the millions facing starvation in !
war-torn countries of Europe and
Asia must be fed even if it is neces
sary lo restore meat rationing in the
United States.
He told his news conference that
he did not think a return to meat
rationing would be necessary. But,
he added, if such a step is needed
to prevent 10.000,000 to 15,000,000
people in other lands from starving,
it should be taken.
He said the food situation is even
more critical in many parls of the
Orient than in the worst areas of
Eu rope.
