# Veterans Hear Dim View Of Housing; Air Troubles
## 
### 
Housing prospects for veterans
are not very bright, according to a
speech by Donald B. Tresidder, Uni
versity president, before a veterans'
forum last night.
"We have no money to spend on
temporary housing,'' Dr. Tresid
der told a large audience of ex
servicemen and their wives. "The
Board of Trustees cannot spend
restricted endowment on housing
which does not have a financial
return."
While there are no possibilities to
acquire additional housing in the im
mediate future, the University irj
now attempting to acquire a sub
stantial part of Dibble Hospital for
the students. According to what Dr.
Tresidder termed "rumors," Dibble
may be evacuated by the middle of
summer.
The Administration has also ap
plied for quonset huts in Tan
foran, about 20 miles from cam
pus. These will probably not lie
available for a few months. They
are on leased land and may have
to be removed if the owner de
mands use of the land.
A project at Interdalo School, ca
pable of supplying 15 apartments, is
at present hampered by water diffi
culties.
Explaining why the University
cannot avail itself of housing units,
transported to campus by the
government free of chargc, D<\
Tresidder said that the Adminis
tration would have to supply
roads, lighting installments, and
sewage. This would cost about
.$5OO per unit.
Rent for these units would be de
termined by the government and
based on a percentage of the vet
eran's income. The University would
be required to remove the units
within two years.
Under these circumstances. Dr.
Tresidder explained, housing of
this kind cannot he used, al
though Washington has assi r ncd
100 units to the University, for
which it did not apply, and which
it has no authority to install.
Summarizing the situation, the
president said: "I do not know how
we can do more than we have done
or are attempting to do."
In a spirited question period stu
dents inquired about a number of
points long on their minds.
Dissatisfaction was expressed with
present lower division requirements.
H. Donald Winbigler, registrar,
stated that the requirements will
stand as they are now. However,
they will be modified in individual
cases.
Students should consult with
