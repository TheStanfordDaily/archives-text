# Veterans Hear Dim View Of Housing; Air Troubles
## 
### 
Housing prospects for veterans
are not very bright, according to a
speech by Donald B. Tresidder, Uni
versity president, before a veterans'
forum last night.
"We have no money to spend on
temporary housing,'' Dr. Tresid
der told a large audience of ex
servicemen and their wives. "The
Board of Trustees cannot spend
restricted endowment on housing
which does not have a financial
return."
While there are no possibilities to
acquire additional housing in the im
mediate future, the University irj
now attempting to acquire a sub
stantial part of Dibble Hospital for
the students. According to what Dr.
Tresidder termed "rumors," Dibble
may be evacuated by the middle of
summer.
The Administration has also ap
plied for quonset huts in Tan
foran, about 20 miles from cam
pus. These will probably not lie
available for a few months. They
are on leased land and may have
to be removed if the owner de
mands use of the land.
A project at Interdalo School, ca
pable of supplying 15 apartments, is
at present hampered by water diffi
culties.
Explaining why the University
cannot avail itself of housing units,
transported to campus by the
government free of chargc, D<\
Tresidder said that the Adminis
tration would have to supply
roads, lighting installments, and
sewage. This would cost about
.$5OO per unit.
Rent for these units would be de
termined by the government and
based on a percentage of the vet
eran's income. The University would
be required to remove the units
within two years.
Under these circumstances. Dr.
Tresidder explained, housing of
this kind cannot he used, al
though Washington has assi r ncd
100 units to the University, for
which it did not apply, and which
it has no authority to install.
Summarizing the situation, the
president said: "I do not know how
we can do more than we have done
or are attempting to do."
In a spirited question period stu
dents inquired about a number of
points long on their minds.
Dissatisfaction was expressed with
present lower division requirements.
H. Donald Winbigler, registrar,
stated that the requirements will
stand as they are now. However,
they will be modified in individual
cases.
Students should consult with
their advisers—counseling is also
offered to upper division veterans
—and work out the proper peti
tion. While the existing program
will not be changed as such, flexi
bility in its application to indi
viduals will be maintained.
A specified complaint concerned
the physical training requirement.
"After a few years in the Army
where we had lots of PT, why must
we take some more here?" a veteran
wanted to know. This matter is now
in the hands of the faculty, accord
ing to Mr. Winbigler.
Other students inquired why
Cellar prices are substantially
higher than those of town restau
rants, at no superiority of quality,

and why Encina food is substan
tially worse than that of other
halls, while costing only little less.
Dr. Tresidder promised to look
into the Cellar situation. Concern
ing Encina he pointed out that the
1 dining-hall there is operated by an
| outsider, and that the University
| cannot at present resume control.
! One student suggested spot checks
of the food there by officials.
Another matter brought up was
alleged discrimination against vet
erans' wives. Loudly applauded
were inquirers from (he floor who
wished to know why their wives
had to pay $1.20 at basketball
games, and why University rules
prevented their wives from using
the boatliouse.

In a spirited question period stu
dents inquired about a number of
points long on their minds.
Dissatisfaction was expressed with
present lower division requirements.
H. Donald Winbigler, registrar,
stated that the requirements will
stand as they are now. However,
they will be modified in individual
cases.
Students should consult with
their advisers—counseling is also
offered to upper division veterans
—and work out the proper peti
tion. While the existing program
will not be changed as such, flexi
bility in its application to indi
viduals will be maintained.
A specified complaint concerned
the physical training requirement.
"After a few years in the Army
where we had lots of PT, why must
we take some more here?" a veteran
wanted to know. This matter is now
in the hands of the faculty, accord
ing to Mr. Winbigler.
Other students inquired why
Cellar prices are substantially
higher than those of town restau
rants, at no superiority of quality,

and why Encina food is substan
tially worse than that of other
halls, while costing only little less.
Dr. Tresidder promised to look
into the Cellar situation. Concern
ing Encina he pointed out that the
1 dining-hall there is operated by an
| outsider, and that the University
| cannot at present resume control.
! One student suggested spot checks
of the food there by officials.
Another matter brought up was
alleged discrimination against vet
erans' wives. Loudly applauded
were inquirers from (he floor who
wished to know why their wives
had to pay $1.20 at basketball
games, and why University rules
prevented their wives from using
the boatliouse.
Housing prospects for veterans
are not very bright, according to a
speech by Donald B. Tresidder, Uni
versity president, before a veterans'
forum last night.
"We have no money to spend on
temporary housing,'' Dr. Tresid
der told a large audience of ex
servicemen and their wives. "The
Board of Trustees cannot spend
restricted endowment on housing
which does not have a financial
return."
While there are no possibilities to
acquire additional housing in the im
mediate future, the University irj
now attempting to acquire a sub
stantial part of Dibble Hospital for
the students. According to what Dr.
Tresidder termed "rumors," Dibble
may be evacuated by the middle of
summer.
The Administration has also ap
plied for quonset huts in Tan
foran, about 20 miles from cam
pus. These will probably not lie
available for a few months. They
are on leased land and may have
to be removed if the owner de
mands use of the land.
A project at Interdalo School, ca
pable of supplying 15 apartments, is
at present hampered by water diffi
culties.
Explaining why the University
cannot avail itself of housing units,
transported to campus by the
government free of chargc, D<\
Tresidder said that the Adminis
tration would have to supply
roads, lighting installments, and
sewage. This would cost about
.$5OO per unit.
Rent for these units would be de
termined by the government and
based on a percentage of the vet
eran's income. The University would
be required to remove the units
within two years.
Under these circumstances. Dr.
Tresidder explained, housing of
this kind cannot he used, al
though Washington has assi r ncd
100 units to the University, for
which it did not apply, and which
it has no authority to install.
Summarizing the situation, the
president said: "I do not know how
