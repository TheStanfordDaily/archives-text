Next to the "Bawlout," the small booklet
entitled "Report of the Students' Organiza
tion Fund" is obviously one of the most fas
cine ting of the University-published pam
phlet or so we discovered the other day
wrilo thumbing through it to find an answer
to a number of veterans' letters which the
Daily I as received concerning prices and
profits of the Stanford Union.
Rrcognizing that the Union is organized
on a p ofit basis, we nevertheless were rather
si'rpr.. :d to read that the net income over
expenditures for the year ended Aug. 31.
1945 amounted to $40,743.30, with a large por
tion of the Union's total income coming from
?>- \er. to the public and from refectory meals
- primarily student purchases. This money
is distributed as payment on the Stanford
University Memorial Hall note, and as interest
for 1944-45 on the Memorial Hall note not
covered by the "Theater Dollar," a fee for
paying the debt that is deducted from each
student's tuition.
'Note: Building of the Memorial Hall was a
stud: it-sponsored project; the A.S.S.U., how

ever, does not have control over the theater's
use.)
Approximately $120,000 is owed on the
Memorial Hall. At the present rate of Union
profit the debt, therefore, can be paid off in
three or four years —six at the most—for
Union excess income has not dropped below
$21,000 for as far back as 1940.
All this adds up to just one point: with the
great number of students now enrolled in
Stanford under the GI bill, who are at the
same time fighting high living costs outside,
we see no reason why payment on the Me
morial Hall debt cannot be stretched over a
longer period of time and Union profits be
absorbed by a price decrease on products
and service purchased by students.
We recognize that the Union, under ex
tremely crowded conditions, is doing a diffi
cult job of serving good food at prices com
paring favorably to those in Palo Alto. The
situation is such, however, that, in the inter
est of the Stanford veteran and his family,
this seems to be the one time v/hen the short
rather than the long-range plan is preferable
and expedient.—H.D.
