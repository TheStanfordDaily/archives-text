Ni,; to he considered griping, this letter is de
sign d to clarify an issue of principle. Is student
government merely an idealistic term or an actual
entity?
. i.'i house meetings actually worthless when
an . can dominate our decisions?
lor weeks now, we've read complaints con
cerning lack of interest in our student government
Excom. But how can anyone have
faith in an institution which is powerless when
oppo-ed by an R.A. or Dean of Women without
further discussion?
To .<et down to the facts of a particular case, I
found that, as social chairman, I would have to go
thiouJi the following process to have full ac
c lam* ol a party for our easa. First, steering
eommiK.ee would have to talk it over thoroughly;
then the RA., who is responsible to the Dean of
Women, would have to approve the whole idea
before it was brought up at casa meeting. Next,
Excom would have to accept the date for it.
Another problem was introduced when dormi
tory heads refused to recognize the fact that wom
en's dorms should be on an equal basis with the
Row houses; so long as they are all a part of the
sam< classes, these girls should be allowed ihe
same benefits.
Wt thought college would be a step away from
hi h school, where our teachers may have tended
to enforce their rule upon us. We felt we were well
prepared to express ourselves freely when we
cme to Stanford. We ought to take on responsi
biliiies and rely on our own initiative, because we
ne. <i to learn to cope with all kinds of situation.
Ton often, we have seen our friends rely upon the
h \Y )men holding key positions around the
campus.
Obviously, this is no training for the "outside
wi rid." Many of us are lagging pitifully in using
ou>' imagination and taking action on our ideas.
W are not making ourselves aware of the mistakes

in our living groups, which could be so easily cor
rected if we would only assert ourselves.
Each of us should demand the freedom we de
serve, realizing that it is up to us to carry out our
decisions. Let us get rid of all these unnecessary
and senseless restrictions, and make Stanford live
up to all its fine ideals. —Micky Finn
