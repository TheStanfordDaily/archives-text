To the Editor:
Last Monday Bob Kennedy, A.S.S.U. president,
told Women's Conference that the standards of
personal conduct on campus have fallen off. On
Tuesday night Kennedy's statement appeared on
the front page of the Palo Alto Times, and on Wed
nesday the San Francisco Examiner took it from
there. Now the story is exaggerated to such a
point that anyone reading the Examiner may have
a false impression of our University.
The main issue of the problem seems to be the
"firesides." As it is known around campus, certain
complaints have reached the administration that
improper "goings-on" highlight the campus fire
sides. This could be, but if any girl has a complaint
to make about any of the men, it should be made
against them, not the firesides in general.
The great majority of people here on campus
behave themselves with credit at Stanford socials.
Maybe there is a problem about the dark movie
houses in Palo Alto too. Who knows? So far we
haven't heard of one yet. Perhaps Victorian stand
ards prevail only on campus.
It is to be hoped that no more unfavorable pub
licity will be printed in the local press about Stan
ford conduct. It is exaggerated enough now without
the Examiner's elaborating on it.

well covered without providing more material
for the Examiner's columns. In (he vernacular:
'nuf said.)
