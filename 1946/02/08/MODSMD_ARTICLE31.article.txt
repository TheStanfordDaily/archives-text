No, that is not a black-out party they have in
the Reserve Book Room each evening. The lights
ju;:t aren't very strong.
And the fellow who had his watch out on the
desk in the R.B.R. the other night wasn't worried
."bout the time. He was reading by the light of
the luminous dial.

It certainly is a relief to go to a school where
the dances aren't all cluttered up with name bands.
It Art Weidnor is good enough for Sequoia Hi«h
School, he's good enough for us.
How could you enjoy yourself at a dance like
Ihe U.C.L.A. mid-winter prom this week-end,
where you have to listen to Freddie Martin, Jan
Garber, Skinnay Ennis, and Jack Barrows?

At the end of chapter four the stage coach had
rolled over the clifT and was plummeting down into
the chasm with Pearl White trapped inside with
a process server. Meanwhile Lon Chaney, Jr., and
Noah Beery, Jr., were bound hand and foot in the
hideout of the russlers, who were out rassling. The
fuse was getting shorter and shorter, but there was
a large mouse eating away at the dynamite, so he
might be able to save them. The bad Indians had
the good Indians trapped inside a cigar store, and
they wooden let 'em out.
If the rest of you Indians want to help get Pearl
and the boys out of the path of sure death, or a fate
worse than, come over to Memorial Hall at 7:30
Sunday night for Chaps. 5 and 6 of "Overland
Mail."
Be sure to bring 20 cents and enough money
for an ice cream cone after the serial.
