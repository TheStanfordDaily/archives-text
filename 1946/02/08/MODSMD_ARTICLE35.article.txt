i told British officials after his May, |
| 1941, parachute landing in Scotland j
; that the United States wanted Brit- '
| ain to stay in the war until she was 1
j destroyed so America could annex
Canada and inherit the British Em- i
pire, a British prosecutor told the I

day.
Lt. Col. Mervyn Griffith-Jones, [

the delayed case against Hess with !
the story of the bill of goods he !
tried to sell Britain after his sur- I
prise arrival.
