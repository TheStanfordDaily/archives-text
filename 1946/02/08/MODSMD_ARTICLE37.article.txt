# White Tells Salt Lake Limitations
## 
### 
The Salt Lake Basin made an
ideal spot for a small settlement
such as the Mormons established
there, but it is now showing serious
limitations, C. Langdon White, pro
fessor of geography, said yesterday
afternoon when he spoke on "This
Is the Place: The Geographer Looks
at the Salt Lake Oasis."
Mr. White's talk, held in the
Lower Lounge of the Women's
Clubhouse, was the second of the
winter quarter series of the Sym
posium on American Studies spon
sored by the Humanities Depart
ment.

In describing Utah's limited re
sources the speaker pointed out that
Utah has an extremely high birth
rate, is not an industrial state, and
that only 10 per cent of the land
can ever be used for agriculture.
"Brigham Young believed that no
one should own more land than he
could cultivate well, and no one
should be a tenant," said Mr. White.
Pie then described the tier system
by which Brigham Young allotted
plots of land ranging from 1 '/•> acres
to GO acres to his settlers according
to their occupation. As a result of
this the average farm in Utah today
is only 37 acres, and the Depart
ment. of Agriculture has stated that
this is not sufficient to maintain the
American standard of living.
Many Emigrate
"Between 1920 and 1930 Utah lost
over 43.000 people from emigra
tion," stated the speaker. "The
problem is serious for Utah."
Preceding his talk Mr. White
gave a brief resume of the history
of the founding of the settlement
from the time 15,000 persecuted
Mormons traveled west to find iso
lation and peace in 1847 up to 1857
when they had explored and
mapped and cultivated all of the ar
able land in Utah, and hud extended
their colony 350 miles north and
: outh.
Tells Seagull Story
Mr. White verified the story of
the seagulls which flew in from the
islands of the Great Salt Lake and
ate the crickets which were devour
ing the crops of the Mormons dur
ing their first year. This made it
possible for the settlers to live

through the first winter.
"There is a monument to the sea
gull now in Salt Lake City, and the
bird is sacred in the state," said the
geographer.
"There could be no more beau
tiful or lasting monument to Brig
ham Young than the city he so
carefully planned and built. A lot
of credit must be given to him and
his followers who created from the
barren waste, by hard work and in
telligent co-operation, a veritable
garden of a valley."—Margie Han

ing the crops of the Mormons dur
ing their first year. This made it
possible for the settlers to live

through the first winter.
"There is a monument to the sea
gull now in Salt Lake City, and the
bird is sacred in the state," said the
geographer.
"There could be no more beau
tiful or lasting monument to Brig
ham Young than the city he so
carefully planned and built. A lot
of credit must be given to him and

The Salt Lake Basin made an
ideal spot for a small settlement
such as the Mormons established
there, but it is now showing serious
limitations, C. Langdon White, pro
fessor of geography, said yesterday
afternoon when he spoke on "This
Is the Place: The Geographer Looks
at the Salt Lake Oasis."
Mr. White's talk, held in the
Lower Lounge of the Women's
Clubhouse, was the second of the
winter quarter series of the Sym
posium on American Studies spon
sored by the Humanities Depart
ment.

In describing Utah's limited re
sources the speaker pointed out that
Utah has an extremely high birth
rate, is not an industrial state, and
that only 10 per cent of the land
can ever be used for agriculture.
"Brigham Young believed that no
one should own more land than he
could cultivate well, and no one
should be a tenant," said Mr. White.
Pie then described the tier system
by which Brigham Young allotted
plots of land ranging from 1 '/•> acres
to GO acres to his settlers according
to their occupation. As a result of
this the average farm in Utah today
is only 37 acres, and the Depart
ment. of Agriculture has stated that
this is not sufficient to maintain the
American standard of living.
Many Emigrate
"Between 1920 and 1930 Utah lost
over 43.000 people from emigra
tion," stated the speaker. "The
problem is serious for Utah."
Preceding his talk Mr. White
gave a brief resume of the history
of the founding of the settlement
from the time 15,000 persecuted
Mormons traveled west to find iso
lation and peace in 1847 up to 1857
when they had explored and
mapped and cultivated all of the ar
able land in Utah, and hud extended
their colony 350 miles north and
: outh.
Tells Seagull Story
Mr. White verified the story of
the seagulls which flew in from the
islands of the Great Salt Lake and
ate the crickets which were devour
ing the crops of the Mormons dur
ing their first year. This made it
possible for the settlers to live

through the first winter.
"There is a monument to the sea
gull now in Salt Lake City, and the
