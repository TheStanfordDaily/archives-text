# Hunt Schedules Meeting To Resume Gymnastics
## 
### STU MILLAR 
Anxious to get the gymnastics
team back on the road to an official
position on the campus, Coach Er
nest Hunt has called a meeting of
all prospective gym team members
for next Tuesday at 5 p.m. in the
Board of Athletic Control building.
Men with experience in the rope
climb, parallel bars, horses, rings,
and tumbling will particularly de
light Coach Hunt, who is hoping to
put the Farm on a par with Eastern
universities where gymnastics is a
minor sport conducted in a major
way.
Meet with Cal
A meet has been tentatively
scheduled against Cal in March.
11' the turnout is great enough next
Tuesday, other events will be put
on the calendar and letters might
be awarded.
At the moment, Coach Hunt has
a nucleus of about three men around

whom he plans to build the team.
They are L. G. Ainsworth, J. W.
Stewart, and Ward Chennell.
Chennell Looks Good
Chennell, who specializes in the
parallels and still rings, is con
sidered an outstanding prospect by
the coach. Although Stanford isn't
planning to send men to the na
tionals, Chennell, if he continues
present development, would make
a worthy representative.
Ainsworth, who climbs the rope
in quick time, and Stewart, who is
such an all-around man that Coach
Hunt calls him "the one-man cir
cus," buoy Card hopes for a win
against the Bears in some depart
ment.
"But men who can help us greatly
might be hiding somewhere on
campus," added Coach Hunt. Post
graduate students are eligible for
this sport which has no grade or
other requirements attached to it.
