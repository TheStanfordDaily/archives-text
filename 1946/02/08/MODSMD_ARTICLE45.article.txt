## The 						Stanford Daily Stanford To Meet UCLA Tonight 
### ART LEVINSON 
EN ROUTE TO LOS ANGELES—
Stanford opens a two-game series
against U.C.LA. tonight in the
West wood gym. The Indians ar
rived in Los Angeles last night and
went through a slight workout, fa
miliarizing themselves with the
Bruin hardwoods.
Still able to be taken for prac
tical salesmen of the Bauer and
Black Adhesive Tape Company, all
the Cardinals made the journey
south with the exception of Tom
Murphy, starting center, who got
an articifial sunburn from a lamp.
(He should have waited for some
of this Southern California sun
shine. This writer hasn't quite hit
tile borders of Los Angeles County

| yet, so this sunshine is just a ru
mor.)
O'Brien tSarts
At the starting center position
will be elongated Bill O'Brien, who
I —previous to his entry in the Army
—did his book learnin' at the U.C.-
L.A. campus. Backing him up is
Max King, who played high school
j basketball in Los Angeles.
At the guard position at the sound
of the whistle will be Bill Christian-
I sen, who despite numerous injuries
j during the season, has been playing
: most of the time. At the other
! guard post will be Tom Rodman.
| who was a doubtful starter at the
| beginning of the week but he
snapped out of the flux long enough
j to play basketball over the week
| end.
Martin at Forward
Over at forward will be Gene
| Martin, whose fine play has been
| noticed by everyone. Last Satur
i day night, he scored 17 points
| against the U.S.F. team. Paired up
i with Martin is Tom Hood, a scrappy
1 little player.
Opposing the Stanford five will
j be Lewis, a converted guard at
| center; George Englund and Owen
1 Stewart at the forward spots; and
| Jeeter Miller and Chuck Clustka at
j the guard positions.
Starting the season off strong,
U.C.L.A. has been steadily on the
decline ever since, mainly due to
j player losses. First to go was Bob
Arnold, a stellar player. Then Dick
; Hough went to the sidelines, and
! only recently Chuck Stewart broke
j a leg, which put him out of basket
j ball competition for the rest of
I ihe reason.
| Clustka Stars
The remaining star of U.C.L.A. is
1 Chuck Clustka, who played a scrap
| py game on his previous trip to the
! Farm.
While the games at Berkeley
should decide the conference win
ner, this series between Stanford
and U.C.L.A. should decide who is
—or isn't—going to occupy the low
spot on the conference totem pole.
' Right now Stanford is sitting in that
I unenviable spot, but if the Cards
are able to take both games, then
there will be a tie for fourth place,
jor as we prefer to say, for third
position.
