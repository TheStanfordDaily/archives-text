Well, we see that Clark D. Shaughnessy has once again got
the wanderlust, and is on his way back to the University of
Maryland. Shaughnessy, for those who aie new on the Farm,
was head football coach here in 1940 and 1941. He left here for
a reason unknown to this scribe, and to many others, for the Uni
versity of Maryland, where he turned out a good team, winning
seven games and losing only two.
After a season there he once again pulled stakes, and went
to the University of Pittsburgh, and in his three years there had
a rather poor record, losing 17 games and winning only 10. And
now he is once again going to be head coach at Maryland.
WHY DID HE LEAVE STANFORD?
It has always been a mystery why Shaughnessy left Stanford
for Maryland. In his two seasons here he raised the football
team up from the cellar position of the Pacific Coast Conference
and put them in the Rose Bowl. For this feat, which was no less
than a miracle, he was made "Coach of the Year," and in the '41
season the team pretty near repeated as the West's Rose Bowl
representatives. After these two seasons, which any coach would
be proud of, he just got up and left the Farm.
After one season at Maryland he left for Pitt. Again it seems
without reason. At Pitt Clark had some trouble. His players went
on strike, and his assistant coaches refused to work under him
for another season. Still Pitt was willing to keep him if he sev
ered all his connections with pro football. But Shaughnessy had
his mind made up and is on his way back to Maryland.
HOW LONG WILL HE STAY?
We wonder just how long Shaughnessy will stay there. This
writer among others would be more than glad to hear from any
one who knows why Clark D. pulled stakes here at Stanford.
The little "green" room at the Daily Shack, where the sports
department hangs its hat, will be minus its Sports Editor, Art
Levinson, over the weekend. Art is going south to cover the
Stanford-UCLA basketball game.
It has been the policy of the sports staff to give "on-the-scene"
reports of all the basketball games this season, and to date it has
fulfilled its policy. The report of Friday and Saturday night games
will be in the Daily for your reading bright and early Monday
morning.
