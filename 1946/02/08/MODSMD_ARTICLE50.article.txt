# Indian Mat Team in Far Western Championships
## 
### 
The Stanford wrestling team will
get its first big test on Saturday
night. They are competing in the
Far Western Amateur Wrestling
Championships which are being held
in the Oakland Y.M.C.A. The men
who compete in this meet will not
be allowed to take part in the in
tramural tournament.

Also competing in the meet will
be teams representing the Alameda
Army Air Base. University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley, San Jose State,
the San Francisco and Berkeley
Y.M.C.A.'s, Mare Island, and the
Stockton "Y."

Coach Mumby, who leads our
j squad, is not expecting any sensa-
I tional victories from our men. This
j can be easily explained by pointing
j out that the tournament will mark
the initial try at real competition
| for no less than 12 of our athletes.
They are hoping to gain some much
needed experience for their trouble
l and the venture will be deemed a
success if no broken bones result.

Three of our boys do stand an
outside chance, though. Vernon
' Jones, who was state champion of
' Illinois high schools, will be able
to take care of himself even in this
I league. And Oscar Thompson will
be back trying to better the mark
of third place he made last year.
Dan Winston, who has showed up
well in practice sessions, might

come through with some wins too.
Tiny Mosher will be our heavy
weight entry. Richard Nissen will
go in at 191 pounds. Our other com
petitors listed are Lowel Napper,
Leroy Gaskin, Jim Keirfess, George
Bevier, Willard Walker, and David
Henninger.
