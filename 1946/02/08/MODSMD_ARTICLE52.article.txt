# Tresidder Urges Federal Aid in Scientific Research
## 
### 
In an address to the joint seminar
of the Schools of Biological and
Physical Sciences Wednesday on
"Some Aspects of the Problem of
Federal Aid to Scientific Research,"
Dr. Donald B. Tresidder gave a
picture of the compromises that
have been reached in the many
talks that led to the formulation of
the bills now before Congress on
government financed scientific re
search.
Stating that nations probably
would not withhold use of the
atomic bomb, Dr. Tresidder said
that the government aim would be

! to control research in findings of
: military import, but not to stifle
j other research.
MacMahon Kill
The MacMahon Bill now before
Congress is the compromise bill
reached by scientists and lawmak
ers. Since the bill proposes that
there be a commission set up to
make rules for use of uranium and
research in nuclear fission, and to
request appropriations from Con
gress, the problem was whether the
commission be held responsible to
the President or to an organization
! like the Academy of Sciences. As
! the bill is stated now, the commis
sion would be chosen by the Presi
dent from a list submitted to him by
I a group of scientists. In this com
| mission, Dr. Tresidder said, the
| members would hold office for three
i years and would be eligible for re
| election only after another three
j years intervenes.
Covers Many Fields
The fields the government will

cover are biological, medical, phys
ical, and mathematical sciences. In
these fields there would be a large
number of scholarships and fellow
ships. Students to receive these
benefits would be chosen by na
tional examinations formulated by
the commission. Although every
region would be represented, the
winners would have free choice as
to fheir college.
Another of the powers of the
commission proposed by the Mac-
Mahon Bill, Dr. Tresidder said, was
the control of appropriated money,
some to be given to the states for
state - supported institutions and
some to be given to private institu
tions as Stanford and Harvard at
the discretion of the committee.
Dr. Tresidder remarked that
many problems are still to be
worked out and their satisfactory
conclusion is largely speculation.—

Covers Many Fields
The fields the government will

cover are biological, medical, phys
ical, and mathematical sciences. In
these fields there would be a large
number of scholarships and fellow
ships. Students to receive these
benefits would be chosen by na
tional examinations formulated by
the commission. Although every
region would be represented, the
winners would have free choice as
to fheir college.
Another of the powers of the
commission proposed by the Mac-
Mahon Bill, Dr. Tresidder said, was
the control of appropriated money,
some to be given to the states for
state - supported institutions and
some to be given to private institu
tions as Stanford and Harvard at
the discretion of the committee.
Dr. Tresidder remarked that
many problems are still to be
worked out and their satisfactory
conclusion is largely speculation.—
