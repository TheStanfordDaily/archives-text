# Students to Vote on Area Representation Feb. 20
## 
### 
A need felt for more complete
representation on Excom caused the
Committee on Constitutional Revi
sion last spring to suggest a sys
tem of area representation to re
place the old system of class rep
resentation.
The new constitution, with the
area representation clause, will go
up for student vote in the winter
quarter election on Wednesday,
Feb. 20, announced Carl Burke,
Election Board chairman.
Representation along class lines
was formed by two representa
tives on Excom elected by each
of the upper three classes. The
breakdown of comprehensive class
units because of the quarter sys
tem seemed to the Committee a
serious defect, and it was sug
gested that a system based on liv
ing groups might better guaran
tee close contact between the leg
islative activities and the campus
at large.
Representatives under the area
plan are elected by specified living
units; each representative is re
sponsible to the house presidents in
his living group, and each house
president is responsible in turn to
the members of his house.
By such representation each

area has its representatives and
each area is more easily able to
inform Excom of general student
opinion.
This eliminates the danger of
having all or many Excom repre
sentatives from one or two sections
of campus as it was last spring
I when five of Excom's six members
J came from the Row and two men
j lived off-campus.
