Hkke is news that marks another step
ahead in the fight against t. b.—
news about free tests and new x-ray
equipment.
As a means of locating possibly one
and a half million undetected cases of
tuberculosis, the U. S. Public Health
Service plans to offer chest x-ray tests
to nearly every American during the
next five years. This survey is made
possible through the use of new equip
ment which produces chest x-rays on
small film, thus permitting mass exami
nations at reduced cost.
The development of the new film and
the special fluoroscopic screen was not
accomplished overnight. Organic chem
ists, physical chemists, physicists, and
other technically trained men were re
quired to make exhaustive studies be
fore the problem was solved. Special
sensitizers had to be found. Phosphors
and activators had to be formulated for
the screen. Both screen and film had to
be of ultra-fine grain, and the spectral
emission of the screen had to be adjusted
to the spectral sensitivity of the film.
Men of Du Pont are proud of their
part in the development of this new aid
to medical science. The fact that their
efforts helped to contribute a new bene
fit to society is a heart-warming in
spiration.

for more and better food
"Eating"—somebody has remarked —
"is a habit." It certainly is! Men,
women and children all have a firm,
fixed habit of eating . .. so enough food
must be grown for them to eat.
Du Pont chemists, plant pathologists,
entomologists and engineers have helped
the farmer to increase the nation's
food supply through their never-ending
search for better ways of protecting
crops. The development of new fungi
cides is a typical example.
Du Pont men were faced with the
problem of finding chemicals to be used
in treating fungus diseases of plants,

under conditions in which the use of
copper and sulfur proved harmful. After
long and intensive research they found
the answer in the suits and organic de
rivatives of dithiocarbamie acid—such
as the iron and zinc salts of dimethyldi
thiocarhamic acid, and tetramethyl
thiuramdisulfide.
Agriculturists now know Du Font's
iron salt of dimethyldithiocarbamio
ac id as "Fermate," and the zinc salt of
the same acid as "Zerlate." These fungi
cides are products of Du Pont research
—research that is helping the farmer to
bigger crops of better quality.

Now —Faster Dry Cleaning
Two Du Pont products — "Perclene"
perchlorethylene and "Triclene" tri
chlorethylene—have made dry cleaning
quick and safe. These fluids clean clot lies
speedily, so that delicate garments need
remain in the machine only a few min
utes. They leave no telltale cleaning
odor.

Hkke is news that marks another step
ahead in the fight against t. b.—
news about free tests and new x-ray
equipment.
As a means of locating possibly one
and a half million undetected cases of
tuberculosis, the U. S. Public Health
Service plans to offer chest x-ray tests
to nearly every American during the
next five years. This survey is made
possible through the use of new equip
ment which produces chest x-rays on
small film, thus permitting mass exami
nations at reduced cost.
The development of the new film and
the special fluoroscopic screen was not
accomplished overnight. Organic chem
ists, physical chemists, physicists, and
other technically trained men were re
quired to make exhaustive studies be
fore the problem was solved. Special
sensitizers had to be found. Phosphors
and activators had to be formulated for
the screen. Both screen and film had to
be of ultra-fine grain, and the spectral
emission of the screen had to be adjusted
to the spectral sensitivity of the film.
Men of Du Pont are proud of their
part in the development of this new aid
to medical science. The fact that their
efforts helped to contribute a new bene
fit to society is a heart-warming in
spiration.

Chemical Pest Control
for more and better food
"Eating"—somebody has remarked —
"is a habit." It certainly is! Men,
women and children all have a firm,
fixed habit of eating . .. so enough food
must be grown for them to eat.
Du Pont chemists, plant pathologists,
entomologists and engineers have helped
the farmer to increase the nation's
food supply through their never-ending
search for better ways of protecting
crops. The development of new fungi
cides is a typical example.
Du Pont men were faced with the
problem of finding chemicals to be used
in treating fungus diseases of plants,

under conditions in which the use of
copper and sulfur proved harmful. After
long and intensive research they found
the answer in the suits and organic de
rivatives of dithiocarbamie acid—such
as the iron and zinc salts of dimethyldi
thiocarhamic acid, and tetramethyl
thiuramdisulfide.
Agriculturists now know Du Font's
iron salt of dimethyldithiocarbamio
ac id as "Fermate," and the zinc salt of
the same acid as "Zerlate." These fungi
cides are products of Du Pont research
—research that is helping the farmer to
bigger crops of better quality.

Now —Faster Dry Cleaning
Two Du Pont products — "Perclene"
perchlorethylene and "Triclene" tri
chlorethylene—have made dry cleaning
quick and safe. These fluids clean clot lies
speedily, so that delicate garments need
remain in the machine only a few min
utes. They leave no telltale cleaning
odor.
