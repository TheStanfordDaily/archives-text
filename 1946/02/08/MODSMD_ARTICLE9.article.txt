# Women's Conference to Vote on Housing Poll Consisting of Constructive Criticism
## 
### 
Discussion of recent proposals for !
| a housing poll and the making of
| Housing Committee an elective: body
j were continued yesterday at a meet
! in# of the committee, and will be I
j submitted, with suggestions, to j
Women's Conference for voting.
The poll was proposed at a pre- 1
1 vious housing meeting by several j
I sophomore women, who felt that an !
! accurate tabulation should be had |
{of contentment with the present
[ housing program. Following discus- j
j sion, the committee concluded that !
] the poll could be valuable only if |
the questions consisted of construc- !
tive criticisms and suggestions. I
Marylou McClure, chairman of the
committee, appointed a committee J
for the composing of constructive !
points that might be included in the j
poll.

Would Remain Appointive
Concerning the question of wheth
er or not Housing Committee should
be an elective or appointive body, I
(he committee once more advocated
retaining it as an appointive body, !
but made suggestions for reorgan- I
izing terms of office.
Since the main argument for mak

j ing Housing Committee an elective
; body is that women will have great -
j er confidence in their representatives
J and would prevent the group from
J becoming static, it was suggested
j that turn-over in the committee be
! more rapid. One suggestion was
j that one-half of the group be ap
| pointed in mid-winter, that the other
j half be appointed at the end of
| spring quarter, and that the fresh
| man representatives be appointed at
; the beginning of fall quarter. Thus
; the continuity of the group would
be maintained, yet it would be ex
; posed to fresh attitudes.
| Against an Elected Body
One of the committee's main ob
! jections to making the body elec
tive was that it is a sub-committee
of Women's Conference and all con
-1 fcrence sub-committees are ap
pointive. Complications would come
j Ih rough putting Housing Committee
on the same level as Conference,
since Conference has to approve all
i of the Committee's measures.
Another objection was that,
through making the Committee elec
tive, it might attract representa
tives interested in it as an activity,
I rather than interested in the orig
inal purpose. It was pointed out
that the work of Housing Committee
is highly technical.
New Social Programs
In addition to the above discus
i sion, the possibility for improving
the social program for freshmen and
transfers was discussed. It was sug
! gested that when women visit the
houses, they spend more time in
getting acquainted and less in tour
j ing a house. More informal enter
j tainment in the form of after-dinner
coffees or parties after basketball
j games is also urged.

Marylou McClure, chairman of the
committee, appointed a committee J
for the composing of constructive !
points that might be included in the j
poll.

Would Remain Appointive
Concerning the question of wheth
er or not Housing Committee should
be an elective or appointive body, I
(he committee once more advocated
retaining it as an appointive body, !
but made suggestions for reorgan- I
izing terms of office.
Since the main argument for mak

j ing Housing Committee an elective
; body is that women will have great -
j er confidence in their representatives
J and would prevent the group from
J becoming static, it was suggested
j that turn-over in the committee be
! more rapid. One suggestion was
j that one-half of the group be ap
| pointed in mid-winter, that the other
j half be appointed at the end of
| spring quarter, and that the fresh
| man representatives be appointed at
; the beginning of fall quarter. Thus
; the continuity of the group would
be maintained, yet it would be ex
; posed to fresh attitudes.
| Against an Elected Body
One of the committee's main ob
! jections to making the body elec
tive was that it is a sub-committee
of Women's Conference and all con
-1 fcrence sub-committees are ap
pointive. Complications would come
j Ih rough putting Housing Committee
on the same level as Conference,
since Conference has to approve all
i of the Committee's measures.
Another objection was that,
through making the Committee elec
tive, it might attract representa
tives interested in it as an activity,
I rather than interested in the orig
inal purpose. It was pointed out
that the work of Housing Committee
is highly technical.
New Social Programs
In addition to the above discus
i sion, the possibility for improving
the social program for freshmen and
transfers was discussed. It was sug
! gested that when women visit the
houses, they spend more time in
getting acquainted and less in tour
j ing a house. More informal enter
j tainment in the form of after-dinner
coffees or parties after basketball
j games is also urged.
