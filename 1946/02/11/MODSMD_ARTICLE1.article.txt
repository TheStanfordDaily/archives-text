# A.S.S.U., Roble, Conference Plan Nomination, Election
## 
### 
Petitions for offices on Men's and
Women's Council and the Stanford
Athletic Board may be obtained
Thursday at the A.S.S.U. office, an
nounced Carl Burke, Election Board
chairman.
There are two vacancies on Wom
en's Council, three vacancies on
Men's Council, and one vacancy on
the Athletic Board to be filled at the
February 20 elections, according to
Burke.
Yell Leaders Elected
Two assistant yell leaders and the
head yell leader will be elected. Ac
cording to the constitution the two
assistant yell leaders are elected
from six tryoutees each winter
quarter, while the head yell leader
is elected from the two previous
assistants.
During the war this ruling was
waived, but now it will again be
followed.
Bill Lippincott is the only as
sistant running for head yell leader,
and he has been appointed acting
head by Cardinals.
Any men who have not yet tried
out for assistant yell leader and
who are interested may contact
Lippincott.
Vote on Constitution
Also up for student vote in the
election is the new constitution
adopted last spring on a trial basis.
Probably the most controversial
point of the new constitution is the
old system of class representation
on Excom as opposed to the present
system of area representation.
Under class representation two
representatives on Excom were
elected from each of the upper
three classes — sophomore, junior,
and senior. This plan did not guar
antee adequate representation, and
a plan was suggested whereby rep
resentatives would be elected on the
basis of living groups. Thus each
living group area would have a
representative reporting to house
presidents, and the student body at
large would have assurance of de
pendable knowledge of campus leg
islative activities.

Nominating Committee will meet
tomorrow from 3 to 6 p.m. in the
! Excom room to hear interviews for
\ positions for which only women can

! tion for their nomination.
The purpose of the committee is j

] ball, Joyce Klcger, and Helene Sha

I Barbara Bradley.

Petitions for offices on Men's and
Women's Council and the Stanford
Athletic Board may be obtained
Thursday at the A.S.S.U. office, an
nounced Carl Burke, Election Board
chairman.
There are two vacancies on Wom
en's Council, three vacancies on
Men's Council, and one vacancy on
the Athletic Board to be filled at the
February 20 elections, according to
Burke.
Yell Leaders Elected
Two assistant yell leaders and the
head yell leader will be elected. Ac
cording to the constitution the two
assistant yell leaders are elected
from six tryoutees each winter
quarter, while the head yell leader
is elected from the two previous
assistants.
During the war this ruling was
waived, but now it will again be
followed.
Bill Lippincott is the only as
sistant running for head yell leader,
and he has been appointed acting
head by Cardinals.
Any men who have not yet tried
out for assistant yell leader and
who are interested may contact
Lippincott.
Vote on Constitution
Also up for student vote in the
election is the new constitution
adopted last spring on a trial basis.
Probably the most controversial
point of the new constitution is the
old system of class representation
on Excom as opposed to the present
system of area representation.
Under class representation two
representatives on Excom were
elected from each of the upper
three classes — sophomore, junior,
and senior. This plan did not guar
antee adequate representation, and
a plan was suggested whereby rep
resentatives would be elected on the
basis of living groups. Thus each
living group area would have a
representative reporting to house
presidents, and the student body at
large would have assurance of de
pendable knowledge of campus leg
islative activities.
