# Thin Red Line9 Takes it on Chin In Westwood Doable-Header Murder
## 
### ART LEVINSON 
WESTWOOD GYM. —Set 'cm up
in another line, Emmaline, our fair
Indians dropped another set of bas
ketball games to the Bruins of the
University of California Los An
geles annex. Friday night we were
trounced to the tune of 39 to 20. The
next night the Indians suffered at 47
to 20 defeat.
Friday night's game wasn't so bad
—from the Farm perspective—so
let's say a few words about that
game. Starling on a fairly decent
footing, the Cards kept pace with
the Uclans the first few minutes.
Mel Stoner, portly little guard from
the south, then started hooping the
bucket and we fell behind, and it
kept getting "worser and worser,"
Half-time score read 24 to 11 in our
disfavor.
Couldn't Catch Up
In the second half we didn't fare
so badly, but still didn't have the
power to overtake the usual weak
sisters of the conference, or to come

even close. Bill O'Brien, elongated
center who started in the place of
Tom Murphy, led the reservation
lads with eight points. Jack Meri
deth was next, with six points.
For UCLA, Stoner was high-point
man with II points. The trio of
Clustka, Michaels, and Lewis were
next with eight points.
From bad to worse department.
Saturday night edition. This writer
prefers to keep Saturday night's
story to a minimum, for—to put it
mildly—Stanford didn't quite make
her best showing on Saturday.
Started Oul Kvcn
Starting out 0-0, the score soon—
all too soon —jumped way up in fa
vor of Westwood. By half-time the
scoreboard had the dismal look of
20-8. Guess who was ahead? In
fact, the last eight minutes of the
initial half saw no addition to the
Stanford score ledger whatsoever.
Not even a free throw.
While all this was going on, Clust
ka was ringing the UCLA bucket.
The frosh was hot. Stanford tried to

: break up the tight Bruin defense by
| repeated long shots, which all failed
i to hit the scoring mark. Since we
wern't throwing horseshoes, near
hits didn't mean a darn thing.
The second halt went by for 10
minutes without a Stanford score.
By this time some of the fans started
! gazing at a few of the UCLA co-eds
who arrived at the game in formals.
| (Saturday night was the dance ma
rathon night in Bruin social cir
cles.)
But lo and behold, we caught up
i with the law of averages, or some
thing, and pretty soon we started
making points, too. In the last 10
minutes of play, the Cards plucked
; away 12 points; more points than we
made in the first 30 minutes.
High-point man for the game was
Chuck Clustka, who made 18 points,
to run up his conference average to
108 markers. On the Stanford side,
i Bill Christianson led the Indians
with 6 points. Tom Murphy flew to
| L.A. Saturday afternoon, but didn't
i play much in the game. Oh yes—
I the weather was nice down south.

i to hit the scoring mark. Since we
wern't throwing horseshoes, near
hits didn't mean a darn thing.
The second halt went by for 10
minutes without a Stanford score.

But lo and behold, we caught up
i with the law of averages, or some
thing, and pretty soon we started
making points, too. In the last 10
minutes of play, the Cards plucked
; away 12 points; more points than we
made in the first 30 minutes.
High-point man for the game was
Chuck Clustka, who made 18 points,
to run up his conference average to
108 markers. On the Stanford side,
i Bill Christianson led the Indians
with 6 points. Tom Murphy flew to

i play much in the game. Oh yes—
I the weather was nice down south.
WESTWOOD GYM. —Set 'cm up
in another line, Emmaline, our fair
Indians dropped another set of bas
ketball games to the Bruins of the
University of California Los An
geles annex. Friday night we were
trounced to the tune of 39 to 20. The
next night the Indians suffered at 47
to 20 defeat.
Friday night's game wasn't so bad
—from the Farm perspective—so
let's say a few words about that
game. Starling on a fairly decent
footing, the Cards kept pace with
the Uclans the first few minutes.
Mel Stoner, portly little guard from
the south, then started hooping the
bucket and we fell behind, and it
kept getting "worser and worser,"
Half-time score read 24 to 11 in our
disfavor.
Couldn't Catch Up
In the second half we didn't fare
so badly, but still didn't have the
power to overtake the usual weak
sisters of the conference, or to come

even close. Bill O'Brien, elongated
center who started in the place of
Tom Murphy, led the reservation
lads with eight points. Jack Meri
deth was next, with six points.
For UCLA, Stoner was high-point
man with II points. The trio of
Clustka, Michaels, and Lewis were
next with eight points.
From bad to worse department.
Saturday night edition. This writer
prefers to keep Saturday night's
story to a minimum, for—to put it
mildly—Stanford didn't quite make
her best showing on Saturday.
