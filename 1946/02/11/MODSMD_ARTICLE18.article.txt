At Denver the Farm team will
engage in two different types of
contests. The first will be a regular
tourney on the question "Resolved:
That the policy of the United States
should be directed toward the es
tablishment of free trade among the
nations of the world."
Though lacking recent tourna
ment experience, the team will be
wel prepared on the question. De
bate Society has been working on it
since last fall and has had an intra
mural tourney on it.
Problem Solving
The second will be the problem
solving, discussion type of debate
in which, according to Mr. Chapin,
emphasis is placed on the ability of
the indiivdual speaker to define and
analyze the problem and to present
one of a number of possible solu
tions.
In this contest participants are
rated on an individual rather than
a team basis. Typical issues to be
taken up in this "discussion pro
gression" arc "Should the United
States continue its policy of re
ciprocal trade agreements in its
trade relations with other nations
of the world?" and, referring to
problems of international trade:
"What, as a citizen, will be my
personal program to put into effect
the necessary solutions."
Alumni Entertain
The Stanford Alumni of Denver

luncheon during their stay there,
according to an announcement by
Neal E. Van Sooy, Alumni Secre
