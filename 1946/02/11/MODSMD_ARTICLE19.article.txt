# Cardinal Band Reorganized
## 
### 
Ted C. Tatgenhorst, recently ap
pointed band director, has an
nounced that Stanford now has the
nucleus of a band that may be the
basic of a large organization to be
formed at the beginning of the au
tumn quarter.
This present band is composed of
formed members of the general or
chestra playing brass, woodwind,
and percussion instruments. The
general orchestra has been split into
two groups, one forming the band
and the string section forming a
small chamber orchstra. .
Mr. Tatgenhorst, graduate of Ohio
State University and candidate at
Stanford for the Master's degree in
music and education, has stated that
this present band will not be a
marching organization, and the chief
work this quarter will be to learn
the best known marches and fight
songs.
Band rehearsals will be held Mon
days at 7:15 p.m. in the Choir room
of the Memorial Church. Positions
are still open for brass and wood
wind instruments, and new mem
bers will be welcomed.
