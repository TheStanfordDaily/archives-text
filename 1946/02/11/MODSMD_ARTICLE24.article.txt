# The
						"Why" of Appointing Housing Com
## 
### 
Today Women's Conference will be
asked by Housing Committee to vote on
whether or not the committee should be an
elective body, or, as it has been in the past,
a group appointed under the joint consider
ation of the president of Conference, the
president of the committee, and the heads of
various living units.
Our main objective is to have in office a
committee that will be effective, fair-mind«d,
and interested in the far-reaching problems
that ore involved in any question that affects
so many phases of every-day life.
To bring this about, we suggest that the
plan which Housing Committee will submit
to Conference . . . one which sustains the
principle ot appointment, but allows for a 50
per cent change in membership every half
year ... is the best solution.
Housing Committee was organized as an
advisory body under Conference (originally
it was proposed by the administration to get
student opinion on the situation) and has
continued as a small group of persons partic
ularly concerned with women's housing, and
chosen for their interest and lack of prej
udice.
The dangers of changing such a group to
an elective status seem to us to line up as
follows:
1. Persons are sometimes chosen for an

elective office, not for their qualifications,
but for their pre-established activity "name,"
or social popularity.
2. Housing Committee may be looked upon
not as an unpublicized advisory body of
women, devoting thought to the complicated
procedures and background of plans seri
ously worked out to establish what seems
most desirable to most Stanford women over
the longest period of time, but as a means to
an end—an activity for "activity's" sake, a
post to be filled whether or not one has the
interest and capability that are essential.
3. From a practical, legalistic standpoint,
Housing Committee as it now stands is sub
ject to the decisions of an elective body,
Women's Conference, which is comprised of
the presidents of all women's residences. It
would seem unnecessary, and therefore unde
sirable to place another elective body, which
by definition would get its sovereignty and
right foi decision directly from its constitu
ents, under a conference which supposedly
represents Stanford women as a whole. If
Conference is the lively, truly representative
group it should be, election of its subsidiary
organizations is needless.
The appeal of "election" is always strong,
but sometimes it is not practical. We think,
in the case of Housing Committee, that it
does not hold water.
