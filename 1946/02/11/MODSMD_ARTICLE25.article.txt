# China Takes a Long Step
## 
### 
Pe.haps the most significant piece of his
tory being made today is in China. For that
nation, by compromising on almost uncom
promisable issues and by working hard to
briing unity to a divided nation, has taken
the first positive step toward peace'~and re
construction in this chaotic postwar world.
China faces problems unique to a nation
in her position as a world power. Long dis
united, and split for two decades by a series
of internal wars, her agrarian economy
(forced to support a poverty-stricken popu
lation of nearly a half-billion), now in a worse
position because of her long war with Japan,
China's move toward unity and reconstruc
tion must be considered as a model for other
nations, less handicapped, to follow.
Through her all-party Political Consultation
Conference, China's party leaders met to ap
prove unanimously the formation of a coali
tion government, a democratic constitution,
and a National Assembly. Under this ar
rangement, Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang,
long the top party of China, would be re
duced in power. Though still a majority par
ty, it would have to co-operate with lesser
parties to achieve the unity, democracy, and

economic strength that are China's present
aims.
Much credit i'or immediate organization of
a democratic government must go to former
U.S. Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall.
By exerting U.S. State Department and pub
lic opinion pressure for a unified China, and
by his sympathy and understanding for the
problems of China, he has seemed a real
friend to the Chinese and an able representa
tive of the people of Ainerica.
The final aims of both political factions
of China are, perhaps, the same. Combined,
the Communist and Nationalist factions will
be able to realize their goals to an extent
impossible in a divided country. At present,
immediate action must be taken on material
reconstruction, building of an industrial econ
omy, and public health. With the under
standing and aid of friendly nations such as
the United States, China can fulfill her aims.
But it will take many years, and much un
selfish, co-operative effort on the part of all
concerned to realize China's rise, both eco
nomically and otherwise, to the position she
richly deserves in the community of na
tions.â€”M. S.
