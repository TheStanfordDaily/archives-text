A "PRO" FAN SPEAKS UP
Sideline Slants Thursday took a crack at a
recent column by Bud Spencer in the San
Francisco News.
Columnist Levinson attempts to solve the
p*'o vs. college football problem by stating
that 18 and 19-year-olds should not be al
lowed to play against olderand more mature
men such as those found in current pro loops;
also that university non-graduates should be
barred from pro football.
Has the columnist spectated any pro games
of late? If so I'm surprised that he feels that
some rule or regulation should be invoked to
eliminate "other than university graduates."
If not, I might mention a few of my personal
observations from seeing the Detroit Lions
play 10 or 12 home games in the past two
years. The Lions, who are certainly not the
exception, had a line last year that averaged

220 pounds, a backfield doing 205. The aver
age player age was 26 or 27. These boys
are not ordinary former college football play
ers. They were signed because (1) they were
college "stars", (2) they are plenty big and
rugged, and (3) because they have three or
four years' experience beyond the high
school level.
I will take my hat off to any 18 or 19-
year-old, 180-pounder that can crack an
organization like that. Many current pro
players do not sport college diplomas and it
would be a serious injustice to bar them from
the game. College football has a lot of color,
organized student activity and "do-or-die-for
alma-mater" spirit of the players that will
keep the game alive in spite of the seeming
success of the professional game.
