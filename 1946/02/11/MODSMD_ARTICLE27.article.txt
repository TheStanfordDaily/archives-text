### H.D. THOREAU 
How many of you noticed that the Axe
wasn't in its showcase this morning?

We all read with gladness in our hearts
that John Bunn, former dean of men at a
great Western University, has been hired as
head basketball coach by another great
Western school, Springfield College.
If you prefer to listen to the ball games on
the radio that's your business, but then again
it would be a nice gesture if you would come
out this week-end and attend the Cal games,
Friday there and Saturday here. If we win

both games we cinch fourth place. If we
lose both games we cinch fourth place.
It will be easier for you to get student
rooters' tickets at the B.A.C. today and to
morrow than it will be to try to sneak in
disguised as a crate of Cracker-Jack the night
of the game.

And if you are a man and you want to
live within the bounds of the Farm next
quarter, it would be wise to drop over to
Mr. Sharp's office in Encina this week and
leave a sawbuck as a token of your good in
tentions. Telegraphic reservations not ac
cepted.
