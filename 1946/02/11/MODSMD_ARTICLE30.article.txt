# Our Stanford Rough, He's Pretty Smooth
## 
### BOB PECK 
Who is the S(anford "rough"?
. . . He's the guy who beats his
brains out for Marchie Schwartz in
spring practice and scores a touch
down against Idaho in the opening
game of the season.
. . . He's the guy who never
studies, and after you've crammed
all night long, tops you by fifteen
points in the Eeon I midterm.
. . . He's the guy who lounges
around the Cellar and smokes his
way through his 10 o'clock Poly
Sci class. Ami he's the guy who
picks up a date without any
(rouble.
. . . He's flat broke a lot of the
time and once or twice he's, made his
date pay the bill. But he almost al
ways sends flowers or candy if he
gets her a lockout.
. . . He's always waiting for a let
ter from home with a check enclosed
and he likes to hear from his Mom.
He doesn't write many letters and
wonders why he doesn't hear from
that girl in Kansas City.
. . . He lives in McKinley or
Cleveland or the Firehouse and
he can't understand why firesides
should be well lighted.
. . . He likes to see movies in Paly,

particularly on week nights, and he
damns Dick Powell for having mar
ried June Allyson. There's sure to
be a gal on campus that has more
on the ball than Allyson, but where
is she?
. . . He's equally at home at the
top of the Mark or on the beach at
Carmel. He likes to ski and cuts all
his Friday classes to get in a few
extra hours at Badger Pass.
. . . He's the tfuy who's out for
track and works his head off to get
under 10 seconds in the 100-yard
dash. But he won't get under 10
seconds, not until the ISijj Meet
against California. Funny how
much better you do under a little
pressure. *
. . . He's the guy who's on the
Daily now and wants to get a job
with United Press later. He'll be
assigned to the Chinese civil war
and will write back that the Daily
was never like this.
. . . And he's the guy who would
love to see Stanford win all its foot
ball games next fall—and he won
ders who he'll get a date with for
the Palladium after the game.
. . . He likes the salami sand
wiches that "Mom" Rossotti makes
and he wishes he could win a pair
of nylons at Auten's.
. . . His room's in pretty much of
a mess but he'll clean it up tomor
row. Tomorrow, though, is some
times a week or two away.
. . . He pals around with other
roughs and they think he's a pretty
good guy. His car usually runs and
he likes to go double date.
. . . He can't understand that
Women's Conference is all about
the wonders why he has to cat at
Encina.
. . . He's pretty darn proud of
Stanford and likes to recall the time
they went to the Rose Bowl three
years in a row.
. . . He's a swell guy when you get
to know him. He has some smooth
edges but most of him is pretty
rough—and he's proud of it.
