# Men to Discuss Glee Club Revival
## 
### 
Any men interested in reviving
Stanford's male glee club should at
tend a meeting tomorrow night at
7:15 in the Lounge Room of the
Women's Clubhouse.
Such a glee club has not existed
at Stanford for nearly 20 years. The
group of men who are sponsoring the
meeting feel that a glee club would
be a rallying point for school spirit
and for learning the words and tunes
to school songs. They point out that
Stanford has no album recording of
the Alma Mater and official songs.
Herbert Jan Popper, associate pro
fessor of music, and Joel Carter, as
sistant director of choir will advise
the meeting. Any type of voice is
welcome, but tenors are especially
needed.
