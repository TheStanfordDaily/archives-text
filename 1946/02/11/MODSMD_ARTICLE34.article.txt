# Powerful Portrayal Given 'Lost Weekend' by Milland
## 
### 
THE LOST WEEKEND—Now play
ing at (he Stanford Theater
"The Lost Weekend," Paramount's
study in dipsomania, is a powerful
portrayal of a four-day binge that
l?ft this reviewer in a near state
of exhaustion. Whether you were
weaned on a bottle of Old Grand
dad, or have never indulged in any
thing stronger than Dad's Old-Fash
ioned Root Bear, "The Lost Week
end" will make you think about any
future elbow - bending. Especially
with regard to the stuff they call
rye.
There've been so many jokes
about this picture (in Herb Caen's
column and elsewhere) that you
probably know the picture's vital

statistics already. Adapted from
Charles Jackson's book and under
the direction of Billy Wilder, "The
Lost Weekend" is just one great
drunk, complete with delirium tre
mens (or in the vernacular of the
Bayshore, the D.T.'s;. One great big
drunk full of bats and little mice
that crawl through the walls. The
kind of drunk you hear about but
hope you'll never go through,
.Milland Marvelous as Alcoholic
Ray Milland is already an odds
on favorite to receive the Academy
Award for his master job as the al
coholic. His performance is both re
strained and compelling, especially
those touching scenes in the neigh
borhood bar when he relates his
past. Jane Wyman and Philip Ter
ry, in supporting roles, seems a
little pale by comparison.
Many of the scenes are almost
pathetic in their frankness: Mil
land, broke and drunk, trying to
snatch a lady's purse in a bar and
being caught; the tortuous night in
an alcoholic ward of a hospital; and
Milland's experience of seeing a bat
sucking blood from a mouse. All
of these contribute to the picture's
nightmarish qualities.
Boulevard of Broken Bottles
Maybe you'll laugh at some of
Milland's antics; maybe you'll wish
you could laugh; maybe you'll be
like the campus wag who boasted
that he went two hours without a
drink after seeing the picture. Just
don't join the W.C.T.U.
In any event,"The Lost Week
end" is fondly dedicated to the
Bayshore, Palo Alto's boulevard of
broken bottles.
Sad Second Feature
The second feature, "Allotment
Wives," is another of those "expose '
headaches—this time dealing with
the worldly women who marry two
or three men in order to get their
allotment checks. With a run-down
plot and ca.st (headed by Paul Kelly
and Kay Francis), "Allotment
Wives" leaves a bad taste in your
mouth.—Dick Bower

broken bottles.
Sad Second Feature
The second feature, "Allotment
Wives," is another of those "expose '
headaches—this time dealing with
the worldly women who marry two
or three men in order to get their
allotment checks. With a run-down
plot and ca.st (headed by Paul Kelly
and Kay Francis), "Allotment
Wives" leaves a bad taste in your
mouth.—Dick Bower
THE LOST WEEKEND—Now play
ing at (he Stanford Theater
"The Lost Weekend," Paramount's
study in dipsomania, is a powerful
portrayal of a four-day binge that
l?ft this reviewer in a near state
of exhaustion. Whether you were
weaned on a bottle of Old Grand
dad, or have never indulged in any
thing stronger than Dad's Old-Fash
ioned Root Bear, "The Lost Week
end" will make you think about any
future elbow - bending. Especially
with regard to the stuff they call
rye.
There've been so many jokes
about this picture (in Herb Caen's
column and elsewhere) that you
probably know the picture's vital

statistics already. Adapted from
Charles Jackson's book and under
the direction of Billy Wilder, "The
Lost Weekend" is just one great
drunk, complete with delirium tre
mens (or in the vernacular of the
Bayshore, the D.T.'s;. One great big
drunk full of bats and little mice
that crawl through the walls. The
kind of drunk you hear about but
hope you'll never go through,
.Milland Marvelous as Alcoholic
Ray Milland is already an odds
on favorite to receive the Academy
Award for his master job as the al
coholic. His performance is both re
strained and compelling, especially
those touching scenes in the neigh
borhood bar when he relates his
past. Jane Wyman and Philip Ter
ry, in supporting roles, seems a
little pale by comparison.
Many of the scenes are almost
pathetic in their frankness: Mil
land, broke and drunk, trying to
snatch a lady's purse in a bar and
being caught; the tortuous night in
an alcoholic ward of a hospital; and
Milland's experience of seeing a bat
sucking blood from a mouse. All
of these contribute to the picture's
nightmarish qualities.
Boulevard of Broken Bottles
Maybe you'll laugh at some of
Milland's antics; maybe you'll wish
you could laugh; maybe you'll be
like the campus wag who boasted
that he went two hours without a
drink after seeing the picture. Just
don't join the W.C.T.U.
In any event,"The Lost Week
end" is fondly dedicated to the
Bayshore, Palo Alto's boulevard of
broken bottles.
