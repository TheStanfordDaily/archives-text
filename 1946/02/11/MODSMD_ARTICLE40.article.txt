# Indian Sluggers Lose Opener to Ramblers
## 
### 
Stanford's rugby team dropped
its first gime Â«>f the season to the
Menlo Ramblers by a score of 3
to 0 on the Farm's rugby field last
Saturday afternoon, but Card
Coach Pete Xmetovic is far from
discouraged with his squad's play.
The Ramblers pulled the game
out only in the last seconds of play
when they scored on a free kick at
goal after a Stanford off-side. But
the Red team consistently outplayed
the visitors throughout the whole

contest, missing two goals by less
than a i'oot.
Stanford superiority was shown
clearly in the crum in which the
Card team, led by Ric Supple and
Dave Johnson, pushed Menlo
around convincingly. Ray DurhaVn
added a highlight to the game with
his outstanding booting. Bob Ab
rams also earned Kmetovic's praise
for his play in the first half. He
whs unable to continue after sus
taining a shoulder injury.
"The team really did better
than I (bought they would," said
Kmetovic after the game. "With
only three days of practice they
did a fine jolt and should keep
improving for the rest of the sea
son."
The ruggers will shoot for their
initial victory next Saturday against
the Petaluma American Legion team
which they will meet on the home
field. Climax of the season will be
a game with Cal at Cal.
