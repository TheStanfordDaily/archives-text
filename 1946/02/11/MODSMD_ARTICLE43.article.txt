## SLANTING SIDELINES 
### KEN ROTENBURG 
Away back in your grandad's
hey-day, around the turn of the
century, Mr. Garnett Young came
to California to settle down. He
became a prominent manufactur
er in the Bay Area and on the
Peninsula. In 1935 Mr. Young re
tired from active business life in
order that he might devote all of
his time to his hobby. And there
by hangs a tale.
To call Mr. Young's interest in
track a hobby is the grossest sort of
understatement. With him it's an
obsession. He is undisputed holder
of the Amateur Open Free Style
Kibitzing Championship for any
and all weight classes. To back up
the claims that have been made for
him, his associates point proudly to
ihe record.
Since 1901 Mr. Young has not
missed an important track meet
held on the Pacific Coast. This fact
alone would seem to b" enough to
qualify him for the title of All-
American Track Nut which the Palo
Alio Times hung on him a few years
back. But here is the real clincher.
Day in and day out since 1935 he
lias been hanging around the Stan
lord track squad. He has seen
sprinters, hurdlers, pole vaulters,
shot putters, distance runners, and
coaches come and go.
Some time back he bought him
self a stop watch and began tim
ing the track aspirants in their
daily efforts at training sessions
and marking the results in a little
black notebook he carries for the
purpose.
This practice has been carried on
down through the years and former
Coaches Templeton and Ellington
and our present Coach Weiershau
ser have found it extremely help
ful. The boys on the team frequent
ly consult Mr. Young's statistics
when they want to find out how
they're improving from week to
week, or how they did on a certain
day, or what the best time for a
given distance some particular for
mer Stanford man made.
And these useful bits of infor
mation are always regarded as
impeccably accurate and authori
tative. In fact, Mr. Young be
came such a smooth operator with
a stop-watch that late in the '30's
he was qualified to be an official
"clocker" for the A.A.U. and

| works in (hat capacity at many of
the big meets on the coast.
Something that we feel should be
mentioned at this point is the fact
that Mr. Young lived 17 years in
! Berkeley 'but when the time came
I for him to adopt a team it was the
Stanford Indians lie chose. It may
I be argued that he was too busy with
the affairs of his business to hover
over the Bear track men at that
| time, but this we regard as mere
begem* of question. The fact
remains that after 17 years of living
1 near the Cal campus he came to
I Stanford to pursue his labor of
| love.
The most recent contribution to
Stanford's lore our soft-spoken sub
j ject made was an arduous compila
tion of all exceptional performances
made by Cardinal spikemen. The
purpose of this research project was
to record not only the marks of
! Stanford winners in open meets but
to list fine records made in inter
, class competition, and special match
i races arranged by the coaches. You
can also find the usually forgotten
men who run second even though
they are breaking a former world's
record while doing so.
In order to track down such
hopelessly obscure material Mr.
Young had to spend months por
ing over old copies of the New
, York Times, the Palo Alto times,
the Stanford Daily, and the year
hook. lie hopes that his findings
i when printed will make a valu
able addition to the Stanford ar
chives.
When queried about this un-
I bounded and intensive enthusiasm
for track he mildly stated, "I think

He's got me thinking. Maybe I'm

Away back in your grandad's
hey-day, around the turn of the
century, Mr. Garnett Young came
to California to settle down. He
became a prominent manufactur
er in the Bay Area and on the
Peninsula. In 1935 Mr. Young re
tired from active business life in
order that he might devote all of
his time to his hobby. And there
by hangs a tale.
To call Mr. Young's interest in
track a hobby is the grossest sort of
understatement. With him it's an
obsession. He is undisputed holder
of the Amateur Open Free Style
Kibitzing Championship for any
and all weight classes. To back up
the claims that have been made for
him, his associates point proudly to
ihe record.
Since 1901 Mr. Young has not
missed an important track meet
held on the Pacific Coast. This fact
alone would seem to b" enough to
qualify him for the title of All-
American Track Nut which the Palo
Alio Times hung on him a few years
back. But here is the real clincher.
Day in and day out since 1935 he
lias been hanging around the Stan
lord track squad. He has seen
sprinters, hurdlers, pole vaulters,
shot putters, distance runners, and
coaches come and go.
Some time back he bought him
self a stop watch and began tim
ing the track aspirants in their
daily efforts at training sessions
and marking the results in a little
black notebook he carries for the
purpose.
This practice has been carried on
down through the years and former
Coaches Templeton and Ellington
and our present Coach Weiershau
ser have found it extremely help
ful. The boys on the team frequent
ly consult Mr. Young's statistics
when they want to find out how
they're improving from week to
week, or how they did on a certain
day, or what the best time for a
given distance some particular for
mer Stanford man made.
And these useful bits of infor
mation are always regarded as
impeccably accurate and authori
tative. In fact, Mr. Young be
came such a smooth operator with
a stop-watch that late in the '30's
he was qualified to be an official
"clocker" for the A.A.U. and

| works in (hat capacity at many of
the big meets on the coast.
Something that we feel should be
mentioned at this point is the fact
that Mr. Young lived 17 years in
! Berkeley 'but when the time came
I for him to adopt a team it was the
Stanford Indians lie chose. It may
I be argued that he was too busy with
the affairs of his business to hover
over the Bear track men at that
| time, but this we regard as mere
begem* of question. The fact
remains that after 17 years of living
1 near the Cal campus he came to
I Stanford to pursue his labor of
| love.
The most recent contribution to
Stanford's lore our soft-spoken sub
j ject made was an arduous compila
tion of all exceptional performances
made by Cardinal spikemen. The
purpose of this research project was
to record not only the marks of
! Stanford winners in open meets but
to list fine records made in inter
, class competition, and special match
i races arranged by the coaches. You
can also find the usually forgotten
men who run second even though
they are breaking a former world's
record while doing so.
In order to track down such
hopelessly obscure material Mr.
Young had to spend months por
