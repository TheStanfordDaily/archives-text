# Grapplers Sign Today

### 
All those interested in intra
mural wrestling should contact
Ted Mumby, wrestling coach, be
fore 4 p.m. this afternoon, if they
wish to compete in the matches.
Since the eliminations begin to
night, all entries must be in this
afternoon.
As is the case in all other intra
mural sports, the varsity boys will
be ineligible, so it will give the in
experienced fellows a much evener
chance. The boys will battle it out
all week, with the finals set for next
Thursday night.
The championships this year will
be conducted on the team basis.
Each group may enter two wrestlers
in each weight division. Winning an
elimination match by a fall gives the
victorious team one point. A first
place in the finals gives the winner
five points, a first place in the semi
finals wins three points, and a win
in the quarter-finals nets one point.
There will be nine different
weight classifications which gives
everyone a chance to wrestle
someone his own weight. The di
visions will run from 121 pounds
or under to the heavyweight class.
Jii between these two divisions will
be at the weights 12iS, 13G, 145. 155,
105, 175, and 1!)1 pounds. This way
everyone will get a chance to grap
ple regardless of weight.
Wrestlers will weigh in in front
of the gym storeroom between 4 and
5 p.m. this afternoon. The matches
will extend for seven and one-half
minutes, but will be split up into
three periods allowing ample rest
between matches.
For further details of the rules and
regulations for this tourney, Coach
Harry Wolter, director of intramural
athletics, will provide the answers.
So, if you like to wrestle, don't pick
on your roommate, but come on out
for the intramural wrestling
matches.
