# Bears Dump Trojans Twice, Widen Conference Margin
## 
### 
The California Bears are vir
tually in as far as the Southern Di
vision of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence is concerned, as they knocked
off their only contender, the USC
Trojans, in a pair of games
Berkeley last weekend. The Bears
took the series opener 42-35 and
then came right back to swamp
1 Troy Saturday night, 51-35.
The only thing that could possibly
I happen to keep the Bears out of the
1 championship would be a double vic
! Tory by the Trojans over UCLA cou
; pled with a double loss by Cal to
the lowly Stanford quintet. This
would tie the Bears and the Tro-
I jans.
Friday night, the Bears started
| right from the opening whistle, hold
ing an 11 to 3 lead after five min
utes of play. But the Troys rallied
to close (he half-time gap to 19-18.
In the second half, (he Bears
pulled away, and there was no
doubt about the outcome of the
game. They held a 42-32 lead with
two minutes left. Cal's sensational
i southpaw, Andy Wolfe, was hijjh
point man for the game with 15.
but was off his shooting, sinking
only <> of 32 shots. Bob Webster
led the Trojans with 9 points.
The Saturday night game started
I off in the same way, as California
grabbed early leads of 9-2 and 18-9
j before the visitors started hitting
the bucket. S.C. then scored 13
points in a row to take a 22 to 18
lead'. Nichols and LaFaille then
traded baskets to make the half
i time score 24-20.
The Bears wasted little time in
the second half and soon took the
lead. Shanley's and Michel's bas
kets were the only ones collected
by USC in the second half. Only

free throws kepi them in the game.
But Cal. with hut five minutes left
piled up the shore.
