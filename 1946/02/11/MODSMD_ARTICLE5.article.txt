That has held throughout the yeai>s.
In this land we will stand
As the mightiest of all —^
Sing and shout—ring it out!—
That the Golden Bear shall fall.
So let's sound the drum (dum)
And stamp our feet (stamp)
As wo shout HOORAAAAY!
We're the team to beat—
So you Indians attack and we all
shall back
Every man of Stanford's Red.

California, Here We Come!
(Sung to the tune, "California, Here

California, here we come!
Get back where you .started from!
The Cardinals will smash ya!
Right from the gun;
The Red Skins will bash ya!
Till Golden Bears are on the run!
<
And,
Stanford Red will win the game!
Sorry, Berkeley, that you came.
You can have your Sather Gate,
CALIFORNIA, HERE WE COME!

(Original lyrics by "Miss Nuss
baum.")

Roll on! (dum-dum-dum-dum,
dum-dum-dum-dum)
Forge ahead, Stanford Red,
As we back you with our cheers,
Fighting higher with a fire
That has held throughout the yeai>s.
In this land we will stand
As the mightiest of all —^
Sing and shout—ring it out!—
That the Golden Bear shall fall.
So let's sound the drum (dum)
And stamp our feet (stamp)
As wo shout HOORAAAAY!
We're the team to beat—
So you Indians attack and we all
shall back
Every man of Stanford's Red.
(Original tune and lyrics by
Bob Coate.)
