snag last Friday when only one
of the three scheduled fights on
the card was contested. Two of
the bouts were forfeited, Bob
Starrs being the only fighter to
actually punch his way to a vic

In a thrilling, although one-sided,
fight. Bob Starrs defeated Gene
Dird via the T.K.O. route. Starrs
was the taller of the two contestants
and had a considerable advantage
in reach over Bird. In addition,
Starrs was definitely the more ex
perienced fighter of the two, and
he possesses a power-laden right
hand. Despite his speed, Bird could
not keep Starrs from moving in
close. 'I? *

on Bird's face. Midwav in the
