# Chappie Layout Exposed By 'Hole' Inside Story
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
They may not have the polished
decorations of Esquire's office, the
trim appearance of Vogue's head
quarters, or the brisk efficiency
noted in Life's editorial rooms, but
the two cubbyholes in the Univer
sity Press Building are home to the
members of Stanford's humor mag
azine, the Chaparral.
The "Chappie's" headquarters are
divided into a small hole in the
wall, the business office, and a hole
that made good, the editorial room.
Crowded into the business office
along with desks, typewriters, and
other articles are Stan Shpetner and
Boris Wolper, Chappie's co-manag
ing editors, along with numerous
female members of the business
staff. Covers of past Chappies lin
ing the wall lend further coolr to
the headquarters of Shpetner, Wol

per, and Harem, Inc.
Interior Decorations
A tiny hallway decorated by car
toons and telephone numbers leads
from the business office into the
green room of the editorial staff.
Over the doorway a sign warns the
venturer, "Look out for falling
bricks." Hideous faces and witty
jokes cover the walls of the office.
One of the most noticeable carica
tures is the picture of a brawny
Neanderthal man commenting
"Heah? And what's wrong with
Cal?" On the ceiling, an ambitious
Chappie member has carefully
scratched the ceiling prices of the
Daily, the Quad, and the Chaparral.
On top of a green bookcase
filled with impressive books of
statistics and coke bottles rests a
coffin, the symbol of the Chappie's
honorary humor society, Hammer
and Coffin. Although the coffin is
padlocked, both Editor Bob Rei
ser and Art Editor A 1 Larson con
tend that in the padded box rests
the sacred hammer. This hammer
dates back to 1900 and already
two handles have been added to
the original one. On these han
dles are engraved the names of
the editors of each Chappie vol
ume.
Props used in drawing the covers
of the Chappie are placed on a shelf
above the bookcase. At one time
the original "Esky" from Esquire
held the prominent position, but
now a beer mug has replaced the
famous puppet. The "Old Boy," a
red jester used last year on the
Chappie's covers, has become the
office's favorite puppet. The editor
of the Chappie is now referred to
as the "Old Boy" and the staff are
called the "old boys."
Pin-Up Board
A pin-up board covers almost one
entire wall of the room. Glamorous
photos of Chappie queens, letters of
commendation, and a picture of the
Chappie staff of 1921-22 are pinned
np. A letter from Fog Murray, the
well-known cartoonist, demanding
that the Chappie send back a cut
that they borrowed, is also proudly
displayed.
Not to be outdone during the
war, the Chappie posted their
own "honor roll" â€” The Honor
Roll of Junior Birdmen of Amer
ica with the motto "Sic Semper
Avis" (thus always the bird).
Every time a member of the staff
tours the local beer parlors, a star
is added to his name signifying
one mission. After ten missions
he becomes a command pilot. The
highest award is a purple bird
that signifies that the receiver is
either a physical wreck or has re
tired to a sanitarium.
Larson recalled the "good old
days when men were running all
the Farm's publications." Then,
Chappie members used to throw
water bags down on the Daily staff
as they passed into the Shack. The
bombardment became so bad the
Daily members were forced to come
through the Corporation Yard. A
momentary truce existed when Uni
versity Press members came to and
"rom work.
Added Attractions
A small art studio complete with
brushes and paints rests near the
files of the humor magazines of
every college. Reiser and Larson
commented that although sevei-al
other college magazines attempted
to do a take-off on Life and Es

quire, the Chappie's attempt was
recognized as the most successful.
"But if one really wants a one
sentence description of the Stan
ford Chaparral," Larson remarked,
"just say that it's underpaid, un
derstaffed, and underwomancd."
