BAGLEY FIELD, Va., Feb. 10
(UP). —Aircraft capable of flying
1,000 miles an hour will be developed
within three years, officials of the
national advisory committee for
aeronautics predicted tonight.
They revealed they are exploring
the possibility of making laboratory
tests with small models at a speed
of 4,200 (cq) miles an hour and said
they could not guess at the ultimate
speed aircraft and guided missiles
will attain.
NACA opened its aeronautical re
search laboratories to inspection for
the first time since 1939, giving avia
