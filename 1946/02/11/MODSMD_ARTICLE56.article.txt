Inside Ihe university gates thou
sands of Egyptian students, armed
with clubs, canes, and stones, for
tified themselves in college build
ings and prepared either for attack
or siege. They captured one hos
tage, a district police commissioner, I
who was held under guard.
There had been no actual fighting,
as in yesterday's battle between po
lice and students protesting Great
Britain's attitude toward the An
fjlo-Egyptian treaty, but the senior
police officer in the area said Pre
mier Nokrashy was determined to
end the rioting.

grily denounced Nokrashy as a
"British traitor" and a "bloody
butcher." They demanded his im
mediate resignation.
