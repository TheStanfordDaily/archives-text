fered 70.000,000 Indonesians "transition" status as a commonwealth with

Clark Kerr and Maberlcy E. Denning, political adviser to Adm. Lord
Louis IVlountbatten, who is in command of British forces in the South
east Asia theater.
Van IVlook said in a statement outlining the Dutch offer:
"Recognizing the right to self-determination for citizens of this coun
try, the proposals embody a clear and workable way to democratic
liberty.
"A period of transition is necessary in order to restore the shattered
economy of this country and in order to consummate the work of nation
building. Its prolongation will be subject to agreement between the
Netherlands and Indonesia, or, failing such agreement, a decision by an
impartial third party.
"At the end of this period Indonesia will be completely free to decide
its political future."
