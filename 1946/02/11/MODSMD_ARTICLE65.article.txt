# Atomic Control Must Come Now or Never, Warns Clark
## 
### CAM RYALL 
In discussing the present situa
' tion of world affairs with particular
■ regard to the control of atomic en
j ergy, Charlie Clark, president of
the Student Association for Atomic
j Control, and Carol Newton, vice

president, both expressed their
opinion that the time for strong in
ternational co-operation is now, and
not in a year or two.
"We have little time, even less
than two years, to give the secret
of the atomic bomb to an interna
tional group," said Clark. There
can be no haphazard agreements.
Unless attained now, co-operation
will be on a national basis rather
than on the desired international
basis.
Miss Newton emphasized the
great destructive power of the
bomb. She told of Mr. De Seversky,
who has tried to minimize the dan
ger, but who has admitted that "the
total death, destruction, and horror
in Hiroshima were as great as re
ported." She also noted that prog
ress in atomic physics has been rap
id and that even today the bomb is
only in its infancy.
Atomic Beginning
In 18H9 Mendelyeev, Russian sci
entist, stated the periodic law. This
suggested that an atom might be
an orderly arrangement of some
more fundamental particles. Only
50 years ago nothing was known
about the internal structures of the
atom. At that time the discovery of
X-rays by the German Roentgen
and the subsequent discovery of
radioactivity by the Frenchman
Becquerel are often said to have
marked the beginning of atomic
physics.
Following this, research by men
of many nations revealed the
knowledge of the structure of the
atom that underlies the atom bomb.
Only 14 years ago the neutron, the
firing pin of the atom bomb, was
discovered, and in 1939 the discov
ery of uranium fission was made.
Need for Inspection
The only way to stop research on
war-like uses of atomic energy,
said Miss Newton, is to have an in
ternational inspection force that is
authorized to enter any country,
any laboratory. National sovereign
ty will not necessarily need to suf
fer so long as the nation in question
refrains from illegal use of atomic
energy.
Continuing with the discussion,
Clark and Miss Newton both agreed
that although there have been

j hopeful steps toward ultimate in
ternational control, those steps have
j been far from adequate. Up until I
now many people have been left I
kwith a dangerous sense of false se
j curity.
"I fail to see where the present
UNO commission would be able to
! stop wilful atomic armament by any
nation today," said Miss Newton.
American Backing
The two officers of the Student
Association for Atomic Control j
urged the co-operation of every- !
one. They said that if the U.S. rep- i
resentatives at the UNO knew that
Americans backed them, they
would feel free to act more deci
sively.
Individually, a person should
keep well informed on all steps
being taken concerning the control
of atomic energy. It is the duty and
the privilege of citizens to make
wishes known to their representa
tives through correspondence, both
direct and indirect.
Student Opportunity
Students on campus should take
advantage of the organization set up
to interest them in the importance
I of atomic energy. The organization
I sponsors discussions with compe- i
tent speakers and offers opportu
nities to reach others by sending I
speakers from among themselves,
"There is much work to be done
and everyone's help and co-opera- [
, lion will be needed for its accom
plishment. Although we cannot
hope to solve this great problem, we !
can help somewhat in our capacity
as college students," said Miss New-
I ton.

Continuing with the discussion,
Clark and Miss Newton both agreed
that although there have been

j hopeful steps toward ultimate in
ternational control, those steps have
j been far from adequate. Up until I
now many people have been left I
kwith a dangerous sense of false se
j curity.
"I fail to see where the present
UNO commission would be able to
! stop wilful atomic armament by any
nation today," said Miss Newton.
American Backing
The two officers of the Student
Association for Atomic Control j
urged the co-operation of every- !
one. They said that if the U.S. rep- i
resentatives at the UNO knew that
Americans backed them, they
would feel free to act more deci
sively.
Individually, a person should
keep well informed on all steps
being taken concerning the control
of atomic energy. It is the duty and
the privilege of citizens to make
wishes known to their representa
tives through correspondence, both
direct and indirect.
Student Opportunity
Students on campus should take
advantage of the organization set up
to interest them in the importance
I of atomic energy. The organization
I sponsors discussions with compe- i
tent speakers and offers opportu
nities to reach others by sending I
speakers from among themselves,
"There is much work to be done
and everyone's help and co-opera- [
, lion will be needed for its accom
plishment. Although we cannot
hope to solve this great problem, we !
can help somewhat in our capacity
as college students," said Miss New-
I ton.
In discussing the present situa
' tion of world affairs with particular
■ regard to the control of atomic en
j ergy, Charlie Clark, president of
the Student Association for Atomic
j Control, and Carol Newton, vice

president, both expressed their
opinion that the time for strong in
ternational co-operation is now, and
not in a year or two.
"We have little time, even less
than two years, to give the secret
of the atomic bomb to an interna
tional group," said Clark. There
can be no haphazard agreements.
Unless attained now, co-operation
will be on a national basis rather
than on the desired international
basis.
Miss Newton emphasized the
great destructive power of the
bomb. She told of Mr. De Seversky,
who has tried to minimize the dan
ger, but who has admitted that "the
total death, destruction, and horror
in Hiroshima were as great as re
ported." She also noted that prog
ress in atomic physics has been rap
id and that even today the bomb is
only in its infancy.
Atomic Beginning
In 18H9 Mendelyeev, Russian sci
entist, stated the periodic law. This
suggested that an atom might be
an orderly arrangement of some
more fundamental particles. Only
50 years ago nothing was known
about the internal structures of the
atom. At that time the discovery of
X-rays by the German Roentgen
and the subsequent discovery of
radioactivity by the Frenchman
Becquerel are often said to have
marked the beginning of atomic
physics.
Following this, research by men
of many nations revealed the
knowledge of the structure of the
atom that underlies the atom bomb.
Only 14 years ago the neutron, the
firing pin of the atom bomb, was
discovered, and in 1939 the discov
ery of uranium fission was made.
Need for Inspection
The only way to stop research on
war-like uses of atomic energy,
said Miss Newton, is to have an in
ternational inspection force that is
authorized to enter any country,
any laboratory. National sovereign
ty will not necessarily need to suf
fer so long as the nation in question
refrains from illegal use of atomic
energy.
