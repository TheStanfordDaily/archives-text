DETROIT Feb. 10 (UP).-Gen
eral Motors Corporation's surprise
I settlement with the CIO United
! Electrical Workers, providing an
IBV2 cents an hour wage increase,
tonight set a pattern for a similar
offer to its 175.000 striking CIO
United Auto Workers.
Auto workers' leaders expected
the company to propose a settle
ment at IBV2 cents as a result of
the electrical workers' agreement,
but UAW President R. J. Thomas
and Walter P. Reuther, vice-presi
dent in charge of the GM division,
1 said they would refuse.
General Motors followed a similar
strategy in the' early days of the
auto workers' strike, offering an in
crease of 13Va cents to its 25,000
UEW members and then to the
UAW. Both proposals were turned
down by the unions.
