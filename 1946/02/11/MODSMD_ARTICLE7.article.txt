LONDON, Feb. 10 (UP), â€”Russian Chief Delegate Andrei I. Visliin
sky, charging that the present situation in the Netherlands East Indies
was a spark which might start another world war, demanded today that
the United Nations Security Council send an on-the-spot five-power
commission to investigate.
The United States. Great Britain, the Netherlands, and China
would be the investigating powers.
Warning that the situation in Indonesia might lead to World War 111.
Vishinsky said:
"I give that warning for the most serious consideration of the Coun
cil."
For two and a half hours Vishinsky attacked the British and Dutch
position point by point. Like Manuilski he did not demand the with
drawal of British troops and admitted they were there legitimately. But
he attacked vigorously the activities of the troops and asserted they vio
lated their instructions from Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur.
British troops. Vishinsky charged, failed to disarm Japanese troops
as directed, used Japanese troops to "restore order," and suppressed
legitimate aspirations of 0!) per cent of the Indonesian people for inde
pendence.
Britain and Holland in opposing any investigation said that it would
violate Dutch sovereignty and interfere in Dutch internal affairs.
