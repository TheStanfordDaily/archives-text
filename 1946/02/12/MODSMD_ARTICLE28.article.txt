# Constitution Clean-Up
## 
### 
For better and more efficient government,
a now Constitution goes before A.S.S.U. vot
ers a week from Wednesday for their ap
proval.
Realizing that most students have only
headline-acquaintance with the revised parts
of the new Constitution, the Daily will pub
lish news-stories and editorials throughout
the week to make these revisions clear to the
voters.
Th ;■ main proposal concerns how we will
set up Executive Committee; what kind of
representation is the most effective for a
university such as Stanford.
Last spring Excom and the student body
(by a 90 per cent vote pro, 10 per cent con)
put their approval on the proposal that the
following election of Excom be based on an
area representation plan. Now this plan has
been incorporated into the new Constitution
and stands as the largest change and the one
most deserving of careful consideration.
Today we will look over the history of elec
tions when Excom was divided into class or
Upper and Lower Division representatives,
elections in which it was discovered, after
the smoke had cleared, that the members of
L'xcom weren't representing anybody.
Voters, faced with a list of candidates from
their scholastic class, too often had to vote
merely on recollections of their days in En
cina or Roble, or on the number of times
they ' t ad seen a candidate's name mentioned

in the newspaper. And as a result, Excom
would become lopsided, with one side of
the campus well represented and another
area completely without contact with any
person who held a seat at Excom's oak table
every Wednesday night. The principal or
gan of student government was thus handi
capped by an unintentional narrowness in
viewpoint.
It was because of this provision that mem
bers be chosen by classes, that a situation
could develop such as last year's, when six
members of Excom lived on the Row, and
two lived off-campus.
Since classes did not seem to be active
channels of student opinion which would in
sure adequate representation, it was conclud
ed that the strong existing organizations on
campus could be put to logical use as units
for A.S.S.U. government as a whole . . . the
living groups. It was on this basis that the
whole system of area representation ... a
system which resembles the relationship of
citizen-to-state congressmen-to-the nation . . .
was originated and will be presented for your
final approval.
That's a brief history telling the back
ground of a rusty class representation system
on Excom which called for the new, area rep
resentation plan which is included in our
constitutional clean-up. Later in the week
we will consider the present pattern of the
plan, and the place it can take in revitalizing
student government.

campus could be put to logical use as units
for A.S.S.U. government as a whole . . . the
living groups. It was on this basis that the
whole system of area representation ... a
system which resembles the relationship of
citizen-to-state congressmen-to-the nation . . .
was originated and will be presented for your
final approval.
That's a brief history telling the back
ground of a rusty class representation system
on Excom which called for the new, area rep
resentation plan which is included in our
constitutional clean-up. Later in the week
we will consider the present pattern of the
plan, and the place it can take in revitalizing
student government.
For better and more efficient government,
a now Constitution goes before A.S.S.U. vot
ers a week from Wednesday for their ap
proval.
Realizing that most students have only
headline-acquaintance with the revised parts
of the new Constitution, the Daily will pub
lish news-stories and editorials throughout
the week to make these revisions clear to the
voters.
Th ;■ main proposal concerns how we will
set up Executive Committee; what kind of
representation is the most effective for a
university such as Stanford.
Last spring Excom and the student body
(by a 90 per cent vote pro, 10 per cent con)
put their approval on the proposal that the
following election of Excom be based on an
area representation plan. Now this plan has
been incorporated into the new Constitution
and stands as the largest change and the one
most deserving of careful consideration.
Today we will look over the history of elec
tions when Excom was divided into class or
Upper and Lower Division representatives,
elections in which it was discovered, after
the smoke had cleared, that the members of
L'xcom weren't representing anybody.
Voters, faced with a list of candidates from
their scholastic class, too often had to vote
merely on recollections of their days in En
cina or Roble, or on the number of times
they ' t ad seen a candidate's name mentioned

in the newspaper. And as a result, Excom
would become lopsided, with one side of
the campus well represented and another
area completely without contact with any
person who held a seat at Excom's oak table
every Wednesday night. The principal or
gan of student government was thus handi
capped by an unintentional narrowness in
viewpoint.
It was because of this provision that mem
bers be chosen by classes, that a situation
could develop such as last year's, when six
members of Excom lived on the Row, and
two lived off-campus.
Since classes did not seem to be active
channels of student opinion which would in
sure adequate representation, it was conclud
ed that the strong existing organizations on
campus could be put to logical use as units
for A.S.S.U. government as a whole . . . the
living groups. It was on this basis that the
whole system of area representation ... a

citizen-to-state congressmen-to-the nation . . .
