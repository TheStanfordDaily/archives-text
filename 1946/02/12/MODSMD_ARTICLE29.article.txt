To the Editor:
We in the Chappie office would like to thank the
Daily for th? nice little story they put on the back
page of yesterday's issue. We notice, however, that
it said that the editor Ls now called the "Old Boy,"
named after the puppet that Barney McClure made
in 1939 which we happen to have around the place.
It may interest someone to know that the char

acter of the Old Boy was created in 1899 by Bris
tow Adams, and the editor has always been known
as such. The fact that some of the other "Chappies"
(staff members) are also referred to as Old Boys
is because there are now three ex-editors on the
staff. This whole situation seems to have confused
h— out of somebody. Wo hope this clears it up.
Nice try, though.
