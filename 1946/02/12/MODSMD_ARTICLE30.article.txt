A new intramural record was established last
Tuesday night when "Chickery-chick" was ren
dered 15 consecutive times in the Cellar arenaT The

but someone was kind enough to render the plug
out of the wall.

At 3 a.m. tomorrow we are starting a petition
to force our leaders to change the name of the
Music Listening Room from"The Music Listening
Room" to "The Music Listening To Room."
That verb "listening" sounds pretty intransitive
to us, thei-eby making "music" rather indirect. In
that case it must be "listening to." It isn't the
music that's listening. We're the one that's listen
ing, and you're listening tooâ€”or are you?

Articlo in yesterday's Daily says Wim'n's Con
f'r'nce was holding a meeting in order to elect five
wim'n to serve on Nominating Committee.
Now just a minute, girls. Aren't we rushing
into this thing a little too fast? We suggest that you
appoint a committee to consider nominees, five of
whom could be elected to serve on Nominating
Committee. Or you might elect a body to consider
nppoi'itees for the Committee to Consider Nomi
nees for Election to Nominating Committee. Then
again-
Well, anyway, let us not lose sight of our demo
cratic processes.
