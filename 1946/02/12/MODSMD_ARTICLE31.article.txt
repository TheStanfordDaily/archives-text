# HISTORY—1946
## 
### ELLIOTT EPSTEEN 
Stalin made a speech. In it, he said that the
reason the war was fought was that capitalistic
states aro always fighting each other over raw ma
le rials and export markets.
He warned Russia that it always had to be pre
pared against the ramifications of this vice. He
was not so blunt as some of his underlings, who
have been shouting "Russia is still encircled, com
rades," but it is not doubtful that they would not
hav':* spoken without his okay.
He opened a new five-year plan, which he stated
would aim at increasing production of steel, pig
iron, and oil by 300 per cent, and would raise coal
output by 300 million tons. If the figures are
reached, Russian production will be about up to
America's in 1944.
II" also promised to cut the cost of manufac
turing goods to give everybody a higher standard
of living.
FOUR STEPS
There are four steps that Stalin might possibly
use to effect the latter.
1. Decentralize the bureaucracy so that plant
managers can spend more time running their fac
tories instead of fighting minor appropriations out
with the boys tip in Politburo.
2. Feed the workers a little better and don't
work them so long, so they can produce more with
greater efficiency.
3. Stop shooting priceless engineers because
they disagree with the politicians in Moscow, and
especially the big bos» in the Kremlin. Even the
'"sun of socialism" might be wrong sometimes
about factory problems being handled a thousand
miles away from him.
4. Admit that five-year plans might be wrong
now and then. Don't run the bearings off machine
tools in the name of production. Workers have to
be docked to pay for government inefficiency when
this happens, and it is a pet vice.
WAR
Stalin's remarks about war and raw materials

seem wrong by the facts. Some of the countries
in Europe with the highest standards of living have
the fewest raw materials. The United Kingdom
only has a little more than equal trading rights
with her Empire. Holland, the Scandinavian states,
and Switzerland have little in the way of resources.
11 is just as easy for states like these to import
what they need and fabricate the materials into
exportable goods as to buy what is needed in some
distant part, of their own country, if it were there.
TOTALITARIANISM AS WAR CAUSE
It seems more likely that wars for raw materials
aro caused by demagogues who make their people
slaves to armament schedules. They put their na
tional capital into non-exportable gods, and can't
buy materials abroad, so they have to conquer
them.
Also, it is certainly not to be expected that so
callcd statesmen who rise to power by gangsterism,
whose political opposition winds up in Dachaus,
Belsens, and Siberian salt mines, will play the
international game by the Queensbury rules.
Recent news from the Balkans, from Manchuria,
and from Iran shows that Stalin is practicing the
vice of stretching out for raw materials more than
any of the capitalistic nations. Despite the fact
that the Fascists chose to place themselves on the
right, and Stalin purloined and corrupted a move
ment genuinely on the left, th? political tactics he
used are not too different from those of his late
totalitarian brothers.
SOLD WAR
Stalin didn't mention that we have such a thing
as the atom bomb; and he does not say that if we
were really out for his scalp we could have dropped
one on Moscow the same day we hit Hiroshima.
Still, he is committing his nation to greater ar
maments and more of a preparatory effort. Could
it possibly be that he is trying to sell his nation a
war with the Western states as a last weapon if his
banditry goes one step to far?
