# San Franciscans Shout Acclaim for 'Oklahoma!'
## 
### 
"Oklahoma!" is a difficult show to
review. Criticism is much easier
to write than praise. But there's
nothing to Criticize in "Oklahoma!"
The entire nation has acclaimed the
Rodgers-Hammerstein musical, and
theatre-goers who failed to enjoy
the show are few and far between.
San Francisco added its applause
to "Oklahoma!" .Thursday night
when the Chicago company opened
in the Bay city. Fans who climbed
down Mason street from the Fair
mont Hotel and wound their way
down through the Chinese shops on
Grant street to the Geary Theatre
found their walk not in the least bit
worthless.
American Tradition
"Oklahoma!" has already become
an American tradition and taken its
place beside "Show Boat," "The New
Moon," and "Roberta." Fifty years
from now small groups like the
Stanlord Players will be reviving
"Oklahoma!" and we will sit back
and recall the good old days when we
saw the show and had to rush down
to Third and Townsend to catch the
12:30 train back to the Farm.
Richard Rodgers and Oscar Ham
merstein II have permanently es
tablished themselves as the top mu
sical writers in the nation today with
"Oklahoma!" After the completion
of the Lynn Riggs book, they went
to work on "Carous'el" and turned
out. another hit. Making the local
rounds is their latest effort, "State
Fair," and the songs from the Twen
tieth-Century-Fox picture are still
crowding the air waves.
Many Melodious Songs
Part of the score of "Oklahoma!"
is too well known to reiterate. Not
as well known, but equally as me
lodious, are "Many a New Day, - '
"Kansas City," "Out of My Dreams,"
"I Cain't Say No," and"The Farmer
and the Cowhand." The last num
ber is the liveliest in the show and
the one the majority of the fans
come out of the theatre humming.
Very unorthodox in staging and
script, "Oklahoma!" makes liberal
use of modernistic sets and new stage
technique. Also used to excellent
advantage is modern interpretative
ballet. The height of the ballet
domes in the "Out of My Dreams"
scene. Agnes DeMille, who became
nationally known for her choreog
raphy in "One Touch of Venus,"
has done superlative work with the
ballet in "Oklahoma." In fact the
ballet and the music carry the en
tire show.
"Jud" Makes Hit
"Pore Jud Is Daid!" made a hit
with the opening night audience
and the song was interrupted with
frequent applause. Satirically pre
sented, the scene has the hero. Cur
ly, trying to talk Jud into commit
ting suicide.
The plot of the musical is feeble
in spite of having been adopted
from Lynn Riggs novel, "Green
Grow the Lilacs." But the weakness
of the plot is barely noticeable since
there is so much that is good about
the production. The setting is laid in
the closing decades of the nine
teenth century when Oklahoma was
still a frontier.
Zip and Pep
The best thing about the San
Francisco production is the zip and
pep that the cast diffuses to the
audience. Even the dancers in the
production look like they're enjoy
ing the whole thing. After viewing

some of the tired, unenthusiastic
performers in this Fall's productions,
the cast of "Oklahoma!" is a wel
come relief. Some of them look like
they might have had a little good
food and a night's rest under their
belt; unusual for stage performers.
Word from the Geary comes back
to us that tickets for "Oklahoma!"
are hard to get. From all prospects,
the show will hang the S.R.O. sign
out as long as it wants to stay in
the fog. The St. James Theatre in
New York reports that the show,
which has been running there three
years, is still virtually a 365-day sell
out. Better get your tickets soon.

"Oklahoma!" is a difficult show to
review. Criticism is much easier
to write than praise. But there's
nothing to Criticize in "Oklahoma!"
The entire nation has acclaimed the
Rodgers-Hammerstein musical, and
theatre-goers who failed to enjoy
the show are few and far between.
San Francisco added its applause
to "Oklahoma!" .Thursday night
when the Chicago company opened
in the Bay city. Fans who climbed
down Mason street from the Fair
mont Hotel and wound their way
down through the Chinese shops on
Grant street to the Geary Theatre
found their walk not in the least bit
worthless.
American Tradition
"Oklahoma!" has already become
an American tradition and taken its
place beside "Show Boat," "The New
Moon," and "Roberta." Fifty years
from now small groups like the
Stanlord Players will be reviving
"Oklahoma!" and we will sit back
and recall the good old days when we
saw the show and had to rush down
to Third and Townsend to catch the
12:30 train back to the Farm.
Richard Rodgers and Oscar Ham
merstein II have permanently es
tablished themselves as the top mu
sical writers in the nation today with
"Oklahoma!" After the completion
of the Lynn Riggs book, they went
to work on "Carous'el" and turned
out. another hit. Making the local
rounds is their latest effort, "State
Fair," and the songs from the Twen
tieth-Century-Fox picture are still
crowding the air waves.
Many Melodious Songs
Part of the score of "Oklahoma!"
is too well known to reiterate. Not
as well known, but equally as me
lodious, are "Many a New Day, - '
"Kansas City," "Out of My Dreams,"
"I Cain't Say No," and"The Farmer
and the Cowhand." The last num
ber is the liveliest in the show and
the one the majority of the fans
come out of the theatre humming.
Very unorthodox in staging and
script, "Oklahoma!" makes liberal
use of modernistic sets and new stage
technique. Also used to excellent
advantage is modern interpretative
ballet. The height of the ballet
domes in the "Out of My Dreams"
scene. Agnes DeMille, who became
nationally known for her choreog
raphy in "One Touch of Venus,"
has done superlative work with the
ballet in "Oklahoma." In fact the
ballet and the music carry the en
tire show.
"Jud" Makes Hit
"Pore Jud Is Daid!" made a hit
with the opening night audience
and the song was interrupted with
frequent applause. Satirically pre
sented, the scene has the hero. Cur
ly, trying to talk Jud into commit
ting suicide.
The plot of the musical is feeble
in spite of having been adopted
from Lynn Riggs novel, "Green
Grow the Lilacs." But the weakness
of the plot is barely noticeable since
there is so much that is good about
the production. The setting is laid in
the closing decades of the nine
teenth century when Oklahoma was
still a frontier.
Zip and Pep
The best thing about the San
Francisco production is the zip and
pep that the cast diffuses to the
audience. Even the dancers in the
production look like they're enjoy
ing the whole thing. After viewing

some of the tired, unenthusiastic
performers in this Fall's productions,
the cast of "Oklahoma!" is a wel
come relief. Some of them look like
they might have had a little good
food and a night's rest under their
belt; unusual for stage performers.
Word from the Geary comes back
to us that tickets for "Oklahoma!"
are hard to get. From all prospects,
the show will hang the S.R.O. sign
out as long as it wants to stay in
the fog. The St. James Theatre in
New York reports that the show,
which has been running there three
years, is still virtually a 365-day sell
out. Better get your tickets soon.
