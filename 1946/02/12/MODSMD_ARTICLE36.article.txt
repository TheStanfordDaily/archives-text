# Engineers Plan Newark Field Trip
## 
### 
The Stanford branch of Ihe Amer
ican Institute of Electrical Engi
neers will make a field trip to the
Newark substation of the Pacific-
Gas and Electric Company Saturday
afternoon. The group will meet at
Engineering corner at 1:15.
The Newark substation is one of
the largest in the world. It supplies
electric power to a large portion of
the Bay Area, with distribution to
San Francisco, San Jose, the Penin
sula, and to points as far south as
Salinas. Transmission lines, with
line voltages of 220.000 volts, bring
power to Newark from the hydro
electric generating installations
such as Hetch-Hetchy. Newark then
transforms the 220,000 volts to 110,-
000 volts, for distribution to such
locations as San Jose, and to 60,000
volts for other areas, such as Palo
Alto.
The distance to Newark is about
20 miles. Those desiring to make
the trip should meet at the Engi
neering corner at 1 p.m. with their
cars, if available. All engineering
students and faculty are invited to
make this trip.
