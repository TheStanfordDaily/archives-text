Stanford's last basketball series
for the '46 edition of P.C.C. play
comes up this weekend against the
traditional rivals from across the
bay, the Cal Bears. The Golden
Bears are expected — unless they
slip on a box of cracker crumbs— [
to win the conference champion- !
ship in fine style by handing the
locals the drubbing of their life.
Miracle Could Help
If you believe in miracles, reaf
firm your faith, for that's about the
only way there's a chance to romp
to victory this weekend. Cal, this
season, has come up with one of
the strongest teams in their hoop
history, while Stanford has pro
duced one of the weakest basket
ball squads in many a moon.
Friday night will see the two !
squads facing each other over at
Berkeley, and the next night's en
gagement will be performed at the
Stanford Pavilion. Tickets are on
sale at the B.A.C. for both nights. '
So hurry, hurry.
Envious of Gym
Taking a gander at the U.C.LA. ;
gym Saturday night made us a little !
envious. Their basketball court is ;
replete with all the fancies that j
should go with a good hardwood j
pavilion. A good press section, a
dandy broadcasting coop, and an J
electrically operated scoreboard are
just some of the features of the
Westwood gym.
The thought of comparing the j
Westwood gym with the Trojans', '
their crosstown rivals' hoop home. :
brings forth laughs. U.S.C. has al
ways depended on Shrine Audito
rium for their play, and conse
quently their court is no larger than
a soda-cracker box. Even our home
stomping ground is a heck of a lot
better place than U.S.C.'s. But then, j
most things at Stanford rate above j
those at U.S.C.

Stanford men of the squared cir
cle come up against each other
Thursday night in the University
boxing and wrestling tournament.
This showing of the Stanford glad
iators should offer a good preview of
what luck thp Cards should en
counter this season in intercolle
giate competition. Experience of
any sort is a minus quantity around
here, but what school possesses any
Joe Louises or Joe Savoldis?
This show always atti'acts a lot of
outsiders, so students planning on
attending tho tourney — and who
isn't? — should flash their student
body cards early to the gateman,
so a "Mike Jacobs $100 seat" can
be had.

From the Oregon Emerald—the
blessed tabloid that originates from
Eugene — comes the news that a
group of businessmen are planning
to erect a $600,000 bangtail oval in
the city of the roses. This will be
good news for all those frustrated
turf addicts in the Northwest, which
has long been minus a pony palace
with the exception of the plant in
Seattle.
There's a dog - racing establish
ment in Portland, but apparently
the solid citizens up north don't
feel that the canine marathons are
a sufficient outlet for gambling pur
poses. Dog racing sounds pretty
novel to the uninitiated, but the
sport—so we are told—has a solid
record in American annals. Right

now there is a petition being cir
culated in this fair state to put dog
racing on a legit basis. Plenty of
dough is behind the move, so the
story further goes.
With four race tracks already in
operation in the state, you'd think
that would be enough gambling, but
apparently not. Gambling, which
ran into the billions last year, is
no small affair ... $0 on Paper Bow
io win.
