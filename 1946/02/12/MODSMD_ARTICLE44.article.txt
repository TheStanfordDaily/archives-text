## The
						Stanford Daily Indians Play Bears Next 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
The Indians draw their toughest
assignment of thy season this week
i end when they collide with the Pa
cific Coast Conference Southern Di
' vision title-bound California Bears
in 'a two-day set-to at Berkeley
i Friday and here Saturday.
Following their double triumph in
; the crucial series against Southern
Cal last weekend at Berkeley, Cal
j needs but one more victory to nail
the bunting mathematically speak
| ing to the bulkhead, and would like
nothing better than to do so and
beat Stanford at the same time.
| Ocvrwhelmed Trojans
Against the team that is reputed
ly much better its second night than
its first, the Bears very effectively
hobbled the Horse Saturday nick
j with a veritable whirlwind of sec
ond-half activity that physically
overwhelmed the Trojans and left !
them dazed, shocked, and shattered.
Giving the devil his due, Cal ac
tually swept Troy off its feet in
both games and proved without .
much doubt that it is THE team in
i the Southern Division; and although j
there is not much doubt as to the I
| actual outcome of this week's brace !
of games other than the final score, :
| it is too much to hope for magna- !
nimity on the part of Coach "Nibs" j
I Price and cohorts.
The Indians turned in last week- j
end what was probably their worst I
showing in Conference basketball ,
! when the Uclans all but chased \
them out of Westwood. After that i
performance, the Indians are due '
to improve. It is a question, though, I
whether the Big Red will improve \
enough to throw more than an oc- j
casional scare into the Bear.
Chances Almost Zero
There is no one in his right mind ,
who is overly optimistic about the j
J Cardinals' chances in this series.
[But the inevitable diehards — in
clude me in—will not throw in the
i towel until 9:30 Saturday night.
First of all, Cal will not be at the
same peak this weekend that it was
j last; secondly, the Bear will spend
most of this week boning up for
next week's exams at Berkeley;
thirdly, the Blue and Gold will re
gard these versions of "Big Game"
as a cinch; fourth, the Indians may
; bounce higher than is expected;
! fifth, the Tribe is willing to commit
j anything up to and including mur-
I der to prevent Cal from boasting ,
|of having tripped the Cards four i
straight times in basketball; and last j
j but not least. Cal has equaled the !
| scrappiness of the Indians but once j
j this season.
