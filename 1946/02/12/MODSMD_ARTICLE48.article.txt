# JV's Primed To Play Cal
## 
### 
Fordy Anderson will prime his
Junior Varsity squad this week for
the struggle of the season. Stan
ford J.V.'s will meet -the California
I Blues twice in a return engage
-1 ment next weekend. The Blues took
' both of the early season games by
i close margins.
In preparation for the encoun
' ters, the squad journeyed up to
Menlo J.C. last weekend to take a
| close win. Led by Ed Culin and
Put Taylor, thÂ» Card quintet just
j managed to breeze by the opposi
| tion by two points; the score was
| 41 to 39.
The locals for the first time played
team ball all the way. They have
I always had the natural ability but
| have failed to win at times because
: of failure to capitalize on their op
' portunities.
Playing before a crowd that was
j entirely minus Stanford rooters, the
j team did an iron-man job. Only six
men played and four of those went
the whole route.
j .The, six were Pat Taylor, Bob Ha-
I gopian, Ed Culin. John Muir, Brew-
I ster Anns, and Fred Loomis.
