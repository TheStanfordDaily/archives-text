# New Gallery Exhibit Presents Chinese, Japanese Art Forms
## 
### 
In connection with the newly-organized program of Asiatic studies, an
exhibit of Asiatic art will open today at the Thomas Wclton Stanford Art
Gallery. The show includes principally Chinese and Japanese works, but
two modern Balinese figures are on display.
Buddha Collection
The material was loaned by the Gump Gallery at 250 Post street, San

Francisco, and the University of
California. Two pieces for the Lev
entritt Collection of the Stanford
Gallery are in the exhibition.
One of these is a large reclining
Buddha of wood made during the
period of the Sung dynasty. It was
originally covered with bright tem
pera color, but long exposure to
weather has removed all traces of it.
The other is a terra cotta polychrome
Buddha head which shows the usual
placid expression associated with
Buddhas.
Embroidery in Art
Two typical Chinese silk panels in
which embroidery rather than pig
ment is the medium of expression
show the variety of oriental art.
These panels, made during the Chiew
Lung period, have the traditional
flower and birds as subject.
An unusual bronze globe on an
ornate pedestal which appears to be
a map of the heavens is covered with
drawings of constellations and Chi
nese characters. It is over 100 years
old and was produced under the in
fluence of the Jesuit priests who
opened missions in China.
Ink on Silk
One of the pictures loaned by the
Gump Collection is a large ancestral
portrait of a civil official painted in
violet tones on silk cloth during the
Ming Dynasty. It shows technique
of intricate drawing used even in the
design of the fabrics of the robe.
Three other large panels show the
typical Chinese painting done in ink
on silk cloth. The backgrounds are
natural color and the design is
painted in the somber tones usually
associated with Chinese art.
Japanese Carvings
A stucco head painted with tem
pera which is on display was mod
eled during the Yuan dynasty be
tween 1280 and 1368.
There are two Japanese carvings
in the gi'oup loaned by Gump's. One
of them, a small Shinto shrine of
carved lacquered wood containing
two miniature gods is over 150 years
old. The other is a polychrome wood
figure of a woman carved about 1735
which show great detail.
Lecture on Japanese Art
Twelve representative examples
of Japanese prints by some of the
foremost artists of that country were
loaned for this exhibit by the Uni
versity of California. Each of these
is made by the wood block method,
as many as five or six blocks
being made for the various colors
in each print. George Harris, acting
director of the gallery, said that
these prints show one of the most
sophisticated forms of graphic art.
A painting on silk of a snowstorm
in Yosemite by a modern Japanese
artist, Chiura Obata, is also being
shown. Mr. Obata, a member of the
faculty of the University of Califor
nia, will give a lecture and dem
onstration of Oriental art in the
Stanford Gallery on Friday after
noon, March 1 at 2.
