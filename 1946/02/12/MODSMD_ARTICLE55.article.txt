j FRANKFURT, Feb. 11 (UP).—
Heavily armed Third Army detach-
I ments, apparently responding to
I complaints that reactionary Polish
| and Yugoslav forces were being
; nourished in the American occupa
tion zone, have raided Polish and
Yugoslav camps "to show that the
United States will not tolerate the
formation of military organizations"
in its area, the Third Army an
nounced tonight,
Cavalry squadrons containing a
high proportion of armor struck
"with complete surprise" at the
Luitpold barracks near Munich
where Yugoslavs are concentrated
and the Langwasser barracks near
Neurnberg where big Polish guard
announced in a statement which
read almost like a wartime coin
j munique.
j Raiders Seek Documents
It was said officially that the
raiders were seeking documents of
| either the exiled Polish regime or
i the so-ealled royal Yugoslav army
| which might disclose plans to form
armed units among displaced per
j sons.
The raids came after newspaper
j stories that Russians, Poles, and
| Yugoslavs complained that in the
j American zone there were being
j formed organizations which might
| be the nucleus of a "counter-revo
j lutionary force" in Central Europe.
A Yugoslav mission to the Ameri
can zone had complained that at
Langwasser there were numerous
supporters of Marshal Draja Mi
khailovitch, Yugoslav leader whom
supporters of Marshal Tito accuse
of pro-German activities during the
I war.

(It was announced in Washington
j Feb. 8 that the War Department or
j dered Gen. Joseph T. McNarncy,
[ American commander, to dismiss
j about 700 Yugoslavs serving his
forces because of a Yugoslav com
plaint.
(At the same time Secretary of
State James F. Byrnes said that
about 20,000 Polish civilians were

j quoted army reports that they were
not organized and were not carry
