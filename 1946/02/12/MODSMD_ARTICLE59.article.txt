# National Geographic Will Use Color Photography of Student
## 
### JEAN BURNET 
Imagine Abraham Lincoln's crag
gy features set in sandstone and
profded against a cloudless Nevada
sky.
This impressing scene was photo
graphed by Lawton Kline, Stanford
graduate student, and will appear
in the National Geographic maga
zine. The peculiar rock formation
which shapes the almost perfect
profile of the immortal President is
on the shore of Pyramid Lake near
Reno.
An author, gathering material for
an article on Nevada, heard of
Kline's photographs and picked out
possibilities for illustrating his ar
ticle. "I was fortunate," explained
Kline, "because it is almost impos
sible to sell pictures to that maga
zine unless they are in connection
with a definite story." He pointed
out, however, that some magazines
will buy miscellaneous pictures.
Landscape Specialist
The original picture was taken in
color, but will be published in black
and white. Kline, who specializes
in landscape photography, has done
nothing but color work since 1940,
taking his initial Kodachrome pic
tures at the World's Fair in San
Francisco.
Shutter-snapping has been a life
long hobby with Kline, a Spanish
major, and still it looks as though
it has no chance of becoming his
profession. He had no training or
instruction, but gained his knowl

edge through reading" and experi
mentation.
No Under-Water Pictures
"I have never taken any pictures
under water or perched atop a flag
polo, although I have had to lie flat
on my back to achieve a desired
angle," admitted Kline. "Trying to
take a picture directly into the sun,
shielding the lens and still not
blocking out the subject, is also a
difficult situation. Another problem
is focusing the lens on an object in
the foreground and still keeping the
background sharp."
Before the Stanford student step
ped into the little-known field of
color photography, he did some
black and white portrait studies,
but he believes that, while figures
improve his landscape scenes, peo
ple are generally more interested
in landscape shots than in portraits
of people they don't know.
Kline has found that nature very
rarely combines inharmonious col
ors. He recalled a tree with brick
red leaves which he framed in his
finder against a blue sky. While
there is not the stark contrast found
in black and white prints, there are
many startling combinations to be
reproduced on color film.
Prefers Sunshine States
Most of his scenes have been
snapped in California, Arizona, Ne
vada, and Mexico. Because in color
photography it is important to have
clear bright colors and no shadows,
the sunshine states are the most
desirable settings for his pictures.
Because Kline is now devoting
himself exclusively to Kodachrome,
he doesn't have a darkroom of his
own, for the Eastman Kodak Com
pany processes all color film. This
process is secret, mainly because it
might not be safe to entrust the
delicate undertaking and poisonous
chemicals to y amateur enthusiasts.
Indefinite Plans
Kline's plans for the future, in
connection with his absorbing hob
by, arc indefinite. He plans to keep
on with his color work, and also to
continue with his interrupted black
and white studies.
At present he doesn't see how lie
can combine his hobby and his cho
sen field of Spanish unless he were
to write a book and illustrate it
himself. Never having marketed or
exhibited his pictures in the past, he
has not made future plans in that
direction. "Having sold one pic
ture, however," confessed Lawton
Kline, "I wouldn't mind selling an
other."

Imagine Abraham Lincoln's crag
gy features set in sandstone and
profded against a cloudless Nevada
sky.
This impressing scene was photo
graphed by Lawton Kline, Stanford
graduate student, and will appear
in the National Geographic maga
zine. The peculiar rock formation
which shapes the almost perfect
profile of the immortal President is
on the shore of Pyramid Lake near
Reno.
An author, gathering material for
an article on Nevada, heard of
Kline's photographs and picked out
possibilities for illustrating his ar
ticle. "I was fortunate," explained
Kline, "because it is almost impos
sible to sell pictures to that maga
zine unless they are in connection
with a definite story." He pointed
out, however, that some magazines
will buy miscellaneous pictures.
Landscape Specialist
The original picture was taken in
color, but will be published in black
and white. Kline, who specializes
in landscape photography, has done
nothing but color work since 1940,
taking his initial Kodachrome pic
tures at the World's Fair in San
Francisco.
Shutter-snapping has been a life
long hobby with Kline, a Spanish
major, and still it looks as though
it has no chance of becoming his
profession. He had no training or
instruction, but gained his knowl

edge through reading" and experi
mentation.
No Under-Water Pictures
"I have never taken any pictures
under water or perched atop a flag
polo, although I have had to lie flat
on my back to achieve a desired
angle," admitted Kline. "Trying to
take a picture directly into the sun,
shielding the lens and still not
blocking out the subject, is also a
difficult situation. Another problem
is focusing the lens on an object in
the foreground and still keeping the
background sharp."
Before the Stanford student step
ped into the little-known field of
color photography, he did some
black and white portrait studies,
but he believes that, while figures
improve his landscape scenes, peo
ple are generally more interested
in landscape shots than in portraits
of people they don't know.
Kline has found that nature very
rarely combines inharmonious col
ors. He recalled a tree with brick
red leaves which he framed in his
finder against a blue sky. While
there is not the stark contrast found
in black and white prints, there are
many startling combinations to be
reproduced on color film.
Prefers Sunshine States
Most of his scenes have been
snapped in California, Arizona, Ne
vada, and Mexico. Because in color
photography it is important to have
clear bright colors and no shadows,
the sunshine states are the most
desirable settings for his pictures.
Because Kline is now devoting
himself exclusively to Kodachrome,
he doesn't have a darkroom of his
own, for the Eastman Kodak Com
pany processes all color film. This
process is secret, mainly because it
might not be safe to entrust the
delicate undertaking and poisonous
chemicals to y amateur enthusiasts.
Indefinite Plans
Kline's plans for the future, in
connection with his absorbing hob
by, arc indefinite. He plans to keep
on with his color work, and also to
continue with his interrupted black
and white studies.
At present he doesn't see how lie
can combine his hobby and his cho
sen field of Spanish unless he were
to write a book and illustrate it
himself. Never having marketed or
exhibited his pictures in the past, he
has not made future plans in that
direction. "Having sold one pic
ture, however," confessed Lawton
