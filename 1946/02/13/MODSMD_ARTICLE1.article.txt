"Buy a cone, buy a cone, buy a
! cone," that's the line seniors will
, take tomorrow night at (5:30 when
the ice cream wagon will tour the
| campus,
The idea lor the sale was orig
inated by the seniors last year. The
j old Pi Phi wagon, "The Black
â–  Maria," doubled as an ice cream cart,
| with Joe Sher as super salesman.
Candy Wagon
This year they will use a gaudily
decorated wagon furnished by Hill
and Dale Riding Academy. This
year, Tom Ashley, senior president,

guarantees enough cones to go
around. There will be 1,500 cones
and a choice of vanilla or chocolate
flavors. The ice cream comes from
the Peninsula Creamery.
Proceeds from the sale will go to
the Senior Fund. Seniors are hop
ing to make enough from the sale
to get a big name band for the Se
nior Ball in June which precedes
commencement.

the cones. Members include Tom
Ashley, president; Chris DeLap,
