# STRIKES IN MAJOR CITIES
## 
### 
The nation's first, third, and tenth
largest cities—New York, Philadel
phia, and Pittsburgh — were dis

rupted by strikes today.
Business was closed in New York
and so were theaters, bars, and all
places of public assembly. Trans
portation was curtailed drastically
and thousands of homes were un
healed because of the nine - day
strike of 3,500 tugboat operators.
