# HOUSING UNITS GRANTED
## Stanford Obtains Family Units, Announces Friday Assembly 
### 
The critical housing shortage which has faced Stanford's
married veterans for a quarter and a half took its first major hur
dle yesterday when a "100-family" portion of the former Navy
housing at Tanforan was awarded to the University by the Fed
eral Public Housing Administration.

Stanford's long-standing applica
j tion to the Twelfth Naval Dis
j trict for reconverted military hous-
I ing available to civilian use resulted
in what the wire releases termed as
a grant, of "as many of the 179
single-story barrack-type buildings
as needed to fill their 100-family
allocation." These buildings are
i presumed to bo Quonset huts, since
| Stanford specifically applied for
j them, Information Director Oren
i Stephens said upon receiving word
; of the development late last night.
The units will be available to
I Stanford some time after March
1, since the Navy is planning to
evacuate by that time. University
officials were unable to give fur
ther details last night.
; Bus Service
The huts are grouped in a village
within Tanforan, which it is hoped
will be granted to the University
in its entirety. If so, according to
Mr. Stephens, it will be operated
as a complete Stanford living unit.
Bus service will probably be op
erated by the University if com
mercial service is unsatisfactory.
Property on which the Quonset
j huts are located has been leased
in the past by the Navy from the
Mills estate and Stanford's ability
to get the huts will depend on
whether it can renew the lease.
Apply for Accommodations
Student veterans at Stanford will
! apply to the Office of the Dean of
! Students for accommodations; fur-
I ther information on the available
| housing will be obtained from the
I FHPA and arrangements will be
j made for registration of students af
ter that. Announcement will be
made in the Daily.
The huts were described as
consisting of two apartments
each, with a living room, two bed
rooms, kitchenette, and bath with
shower. Each kitchen is supplied
with an electric four-burner cook
ing range, and an ice-box, which
is not electric.
"Simple—Attratcive"
The present furnishing of the huts
jis simple but attractive; Director

Stanford students will flock en masse to Memorial Hall Friday
morning at 11 for winter quarter's first all-University assembly,
the Committee of Public Exercises announced yesterday. Classes
will be excused.
Sponsored by the Public Exercises Committee, and planned

by a special program committee, the
assembly will be built around the
address of Mr. Herman Phle er en
titled, "Military Government and
the Nuremberg Trials."
Mf. Phleger is a member of Stan
ford's Board of Trustees, and has
recently served in Germany as the
deputy chief of the Legal Division
of the United States group of the
Control Council for Germany, lie
went to Germany in July of last
year, and returned shortly after New
Year's Day.
He will be introduced by Univer
sity President Donald B. Tresidder.
Friday's assembly was planned to
satisfy a need felt by many students
.or tne entire student body to get to
gether informally in the name of
the University. Further details of
the program will be released tomor
row by the program committee, ac
cording to Dean of Students John
Stainaker.
