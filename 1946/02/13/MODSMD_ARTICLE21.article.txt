# Interfraternity Council Abolishes 'Hell Week'
## 
### 
"Hell Week" for Stanford's fraternity chapters was abolished last
night by action of the Interfraternity Council.
Actually the body, representing the 25 social fratertiities on campus,
reaffirmed a declaration made in 1944 stating that "only formal ritual
initiations will be performed," amending it so that this regulation will
be in force in normal times, rather than just for the war years as it
originally stated.
This regulation follows a general trend throughout the country to
ward more cautious rushing and pledging activities on the part of fra
ternities.
The declaration was passed unanimously after a lengthy discussion
in which most of the representatives present indicated that they and
their houses were in favor of doing away with the informal pledging
period which has come to he called "Hell Week."
During the discussion Council President Ed Luce stressed the fact
that in order to he effective the regulation would have to he self-en
forced, and therefore the original action must come from a voluntary
and unanimous decision on (he part of all concerned.
