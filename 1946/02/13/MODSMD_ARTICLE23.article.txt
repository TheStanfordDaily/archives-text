In "Crime ami
Punishment," Raskalnikov said as
he knell before Son.va that "he
knelt before all suffering human
ity." That this is the greatest,
deepest note in our dav, that "hu
manity" is the most important
word in art today, was empha
sized by Alfred Mirovitch, Rus
sian-born pianist - composer and
educator, at the Tuesday Evening
Series last night in Memorial
Hall.
Illustrating his lecture, "The
Deeply 'Human' in Russia's Music
arid Letters," with quotations from
books and letters of Dostoievsky
and Tolstoi, Mr. Mirovitch conclud
ed with piano selections of Mous
sorgsky, Shostakovich, Scriabin,
and Bach.
Mr. Mirovitch stressed that "the
greatest in art is for the service
of mankind — "such geniuses as
Shakespeare, Dostoievsky, Bee
thoven. Bach, and Rembrandt are
humanitarians. They arc con
cerned with "freedom, justice, and
a better life for all."
Tolstoi expressed this thought
well, Mr. Mirovitch said. The au
thor of "War and Peac"" whs op
posed to the idea of "art for art's
sake," which conflicted with Ger
man philosophy. German philoso
phy. Mr. Mirovitch stated, sepa
rated art and life. Where art ex
ists in the everyday life, totalitari
anism cannot begin.
The formation of the United
States was the first stop toward a
collective culture in which each
state retained its individual cul
ture: the USSR was the next: ami
the final step will be the organi
zation of humanity as a whole.

Mirovitrh.
"Never before has music entered
the people's lives so much and be
come so much a necessity as il has
become in the United States," said
Mr. Mirovitch, who has toured the
v/orld as a concert artist.
The pianist concluded with two
Shostakoviteh preludes, an etude

a performance of "The Oxcart"
