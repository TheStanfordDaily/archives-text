# To Be a Man...or a Nation
## 
### 
Somebody's moaning on campus. It's the
person who thinks that he's going to be cut
short somewhere along the line by President
Truman's nine-point program of food-saving
measures to expedite the shipping of produce
to a hungry Europe.
How will it hit this person? He might have
trouble later on getting certain beverages, if
he tried; and he might miss out on bread with
his mfeals once in a while. The President's
progiarn, you see, included these points:
1. A vigorous government campaign for
food conservation, especially of bread.
2. Discontinuance of the use of wheat in
the direct production of alcohol and beer.
Beginning March 13 the use of other grains
for the production of beverage alcohol will
be limited to five days' consumption a month.
3. The white flour extraction rate â€”mean-

ing the guantity of flour produced in a given
amount of wheat - will be increased to 80 per
cent, from 72 per cent. The increase (and our
friend is probably wincing at this final blow)
will mean that the bread will be darker.
How will the program affect the countries
of Europe? It will probably be received as
partial proof that the United States is ready to
assume the burdens of the peace that are so
closely related to the origins of war, burdens
which v/e are bound by national conscience
to carry, as long as there is a fellow-country
in desperate need of our help.
"To be a man, is, precisely, to be responsi
ble. It is to feel shame at the sight of what
seems to be unmerited misery. ... It is to
feel, when setting one's stone, that one is
contributing to the building of the world."
St. Exupery.
