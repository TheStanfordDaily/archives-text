Men of the NROTC no doubt will spend
this evening holding back the usual respira
tory processes while Excom deliberates over
Women's Conference minutes in which the
Navy unit was granted permission to choose
a Queen for their Naval Ball Feb. 21.
If Excom passes on Conference minutes,
we hope that they will place definite restric
tions on the number of "gueens" to be

crowned per year. One, perhaps strictly a
Navy affair, would be plenty.
It's just that it might get confusing, or
even dull, to see the campus overrun with
royalty. Queen of the Cleanup Committee
Chairmen; Queen of the I - Still - Owe - My-
Board-and-Roorn-Club; Queens of All Two-
Headed Women on Campus; Queen of
Queens, Emeritus—obviously we had better
not let this thing go to our uncrowned heads!
