### H. D. THOREAU 
Since this is National Give-Your-Dear-Old-
Mc 'her - A - Break - And-Write-Her A Valentine-
Letier Week, we have run off the following
form letter which you may clip out and send
home:
Dear Mother:
Thanks for the check. Well, I've got to
study now so I'll have to close this letter
shortly.
Oh, yes, you can send the next check any
time now.
Mot much has happened since my last let
ter in October, but I might tell you that I
passed several courses last quarter.
We have Intercollegiate Athletics on the
Farm again. So far they have been inter
collegiate, but not very athletic. It is lots of
fun, however, to go to the games and call the
players bums, and laugh when they drop the
ball.
We had a Sadie Hawkins dance last week
end. That is a dance where someone with a
dirty mop on his head wins a pair of nylon
stockings. The dance was held at the same
place that the basketball games are usually
held, but the floor was too crowded to have a
game Saturday night. Also it was too dark,
but that's another story.
Tv/o good movies, "The Lost Week-end
and "Spellbound" have been at the local
theater. Naturally I haven't seen them, but

I hear that they were quite well done, par
ticularly the part where—oh.
Have gotten most of my midterms back
and although I have been studying quite
hard, the professors seem to look at things
with a different point of view than I do. I am
sure that next quarter will be different
though. Anyway, I always say it's not the
grade you get but what you remember out
of the course that counts, lust the other day
I heard a name mentioned that I learned all
about in my first quarter of Western Civ—
Herod or Herodious or Herodotus or some
thing like that.
Have spent several afternoons doing re
search work back in the hills on the subject
of malt beverages.
Oh yes, happy Valentine's Day. I was go
ing to send you some candy, but after we ate
the first layer it didn't look very good, so we
ate the rest.
Well, don't work too hard, but if you have
time after you get home from the sweat shop,
you might knit me some socks—that is if
you've got all my washing and ironing done.
And don't forget that check.
Love,

That's enough to warm the cockles of any
mother's heart. If you like our service, we'll
have another letter in next quarter with a lit
tle more emphasis on the money angle.
