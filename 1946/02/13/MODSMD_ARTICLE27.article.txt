# HISTORY-1946

### BY ELLIOTT EPSTEEN 
The stock market took a sharp drop down
wards last week. Trading was very light,
and the reason given was that government
stabilization policies didn't make many peo
ple think that business was going to be so
good for awhile, after all.
This should not come to anybody as a
surprise. Previously, the stock market was
enjoying an upward curve that surpassed
1929'5. Maybe it will again.
ARTIFICIAL BUBBLE
There is an awful lot of money circulating
in America today, and there is not much that
can be bought with it. A lot of persons were
probably reasoning that the increased de
mand is going to cause a boom, and that
money played on the ticker will multiply
rapidly. When there really are things to
buy, many persons might have reasoned,
stocks can be sold and a lot of bright fellows
will be a lot better off than they might have
expected to be.
But the business picture did not support
the optimistic trend of the Wall Street curve.
The government has been raising raw mate
rial prices to increase wages in mines and
cotton mills for a long time. It hopes the
fabricators could absorb the cost.
Now the workers in the fabricating plants

are on strike for higher pay, and the govern
ment is still freezing prices. That was too
much.
FUTURE OUTLOOK
The downward thrust is sharply reversed,
and there is enough surplus capital in the
country to keep it going up. But what hap
pened should be a warning to some people.
First of all, a lot of small insurance com
panies and other institutions handling others'
money were reasoning that the country was
on the gravy train.
They speculated while their safest policy
was to work for enough interest to handle
their volume of business. They might know
better now.
While the stock curve climbed, every day
one could read in the newspaper that plants
were closing because raw materials cost too
much and price ceilings were too low. This
is the stupidity of the situation.
Secondly, a lot of people playing the ticker
were simply increasing the velocity of money
in a very inflated society already. Perhaps
now they will realize that their paper gains
were based more on wishful thinking than on
a sound business trend.
And, if Congress is willing to act, it might
curb by legislation a lot of speculation, and
insulate the situation until a real boom comes.
