# Moule Muffs Midterms; Mateo Mounties March
## 
### 
Perhaps there's a trace of hu
mor in the midterm situation af
ter all.
Malcolm Moule, Western Civ
instructor, had his car stolen at
Santa Cruz Saturday, and in it. in
an incriminating pile, were the
109 midterms he'd given his Civ
class!
The San Mateo police, informed
of the car theft and the treasure
it held, yesterday called Mr.
Moule to assure him that their
sleuthing had produced encour
aging results. The car was still
missing, they said, hut they'd
found the MIDTERMS!
