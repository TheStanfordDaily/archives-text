# Women Sign Up for Open House Sunday
## 
### 
Freshman and transfer women
should sign up in their corridors this
week to attend the open houses in all
other women's living groups Sunday
from 2:30 to 5 p.m., according to Joan
Bailey, Social Committee chairman.
It has been requested by Social
Committee that women attend all the
groups they sign up for, because
some groups have reported that ei
ther fewer or more women attend
than have been signed up.
Lagunita will be considered as one
unit for. the open houses, but in room
drawing, each casa will be considered
individually.
Group A, Madrono, Elm, Haw
thorne, Lathrop, Storey, Mariposa,
and Manzanita, will entertain Group
3, Casa Ventura, Casita, all new off
campus women, and new residents of
Branner.
Group B, Russell, Roth, Hurlburt.
Jordan, Cubberley, Chalet, and Du
rand, will entertain Group 1, Roblc
A and B wings; and Group C, Union
Residence, the Oaks, Granada, Olivo,
Adelfa. Magnolia, Eucalypto, and Na
ranja, will entertain Group 2, Roble
C and center wings.
It would be helpful if some groups
of girls would start at the top of 'he
Row and work down so that conges
tion in the upper Row houses late in
the afternoon could be avoided, Miss
Bailey stressed.
The purpose of the open houses
is primarily to meet the women in
the houses, although new women are
invited to tour the houses if they
wish.
