# Card Aquatics Arrange Meet

### 
Here is an event for you to mark
down on your calendar as a "must
see" item. Our promising swimming
team is going to meet the Olympic
Club here in the Farm pool on Sat
urday, March 9.
The Olympic Club can generally
bo counted on to give the college
boys who are just out for a little
practice a terrific tussle. Their main
trouble is not being able to stay in
shape or do any intensive training.
However, they have been managing
to do better than just get by in re
cent competition against us.
Coach Tom Haynie has high
hopes for a win in the team's first
try. He was willing to be quoted as
predicting wins for Bob Anderson,
the team's free-style flash sprinter,
and Harry Borcher, the king pin of
the current backstrokers. He also

went out on the limb for Don Hes
tor, the stalwart breaststroker who
is expected to give the Olympic
Club entry a lot of competition.
The other boys who will probably
see service in this meet are: Free
stylers: Jim Anderson. Willard Dell,
Raj' Rule, Howard Tayne, Len
Sperry, and Hays Rodenbaum.
Breaststroker: Klaas 80l (that's not
a missprint). Backstroker: Bernard
Briskin. Corky Schriber will do the
diving.
Most of these boys are freshmen,
and if they live up to their poten
tialities we can expect some cham
pionships in a few years.
