## The 						Stanford Daily N. Y. U. Upsets Irish In Basketball Race 
### 
Three teams stole the spotlight in
the national basketball picture last
week, when they came through with
outstanding upsets. New York Uni
| versity, North Carolina, and Bowling
j Green of Ohio were the three teams
that came through in fine style.
New York became the top ranking
| team in the East when they polished
off Notre Dame, 62-58. Saturday
night in Madison Square Garden. It
was the 13th win in 14 starts for the
Violets, while the loss was Notre
Dame's second in 16 games.
Navy Stopped
North Carolina put an end to the
' eight-game winning streak of the
Navy Saturday night, when they de
feated the Middies 51-49. It was the
j first loss of the season for Navy, and
places the Tarheels even with Duke
for Southern Conference supremacy.
Little Bowling Green became one
j of the country's top teams when they
defeated the powerful Oklahoma Ag
gies, 48-37. Only the night before
the Aggies had gotten revenge on
DuPauw, who had given them their
; only previous defeat earlier in the
season. Oklahoma A. & M. was con
sidered the top team in the coun
try and was favored to retain its
N.C.A.A. title, which they won last
j year.
All through the country conference
! races are coming to an end, and the
top teams are beginning to think
ahead to the N.C.AA. and New York
Invitational tournaments next month.
Dartmouth Tops in Ivy League
Dartmouth has the inside track in
Ivy League play and can cinch the
race with a win over Columbia this
Saturday. The Indians have won the
conference seven out of the last eight
years. Yale completed their season
last week with a 58-45 win over Holy
Cross . The win gave them a 14 and 1
i record for the season.
In the South Duke has a half-game
, margin over North Carolina in league
j standings, although their over - all
i record is not as bright. In the South
eastern Conference standings Ken
® tucky and Louisiana State lead the

pack with five wins and no losses
apiece.

right behind them with a 7-2 record.
Baylor Leads Southwestern
Baylor's Bears, with 1!) victories
and only 2 losses, jumped into the
Southwestern Conference leadership
a half game ahead of the Arkansas

back to eight wins and two losses as
compared with eight wins and one
loss for Baylor.
In Big Six Conference play the
Kansas Jayhawks were again un
defeated after six games. Their only
loss this season was a non-confer
ence game to Oklahoma A. & M. The
Aggies are far and away the top team
in the 'Missouri Valley League.

country is in the Big Seven Confer
ence where four teams, Brigham
Young, Colorado, Utah, and Wyo
ming, are all tied with a 5-2 record.

tion's top team earlier in the season,
but have been beaten by Utah and

i record for the season.
In the South Duke has a half-game
, margin over North Carolina in league
j standings, although their over - all

Kansas Jayhawks were again un
defeated after six games. Their only

j Green of Ohio were the three teams
that came through in fine style.

for Southern Conference supremacy.
Little Bowling Green became one
j of the country's top teams when they
defeated the powerful Oklahoma Ag
gies, 48-37. Only the night before
the Aggies had gotten revenge on
DuPauw, who had given them their
; only previous defeat earlier in the
season. Oklahoma A. & M. was con
sidered the top team in the coun
try and was favored to retain its
N.C.A.A. title, which they won last
