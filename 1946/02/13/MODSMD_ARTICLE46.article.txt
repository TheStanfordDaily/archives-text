# Cards Face Final Series
## 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
Stanford gets its big chance of the
season this weekend when the con
ference tail-enders deploy Friday
night at Berkeley and Saturday
i night in the Pavilion against the
apparent Southern Division cham
pion California Bears.
By big chance, we mean that
| more pronounced underdogs have
gathered together all their re
, sources for one last crack that
succeeded against better teams
than the present edition of the
Bear is now or ever will be.
The Indians still have one whole
| card left alter seeing themselves
! trumped virtually every time they
i made a play. There is no substitute
for experience, and it is the lack of
â–  said experience that has caused the
two strikes on them, and left them
| standing at the plate wondering
| where that third fast one came
' roin.
|
Taken as a whole, the Farm has
not played an outstanding brand
of ball this season on the court.
! It might even be said that it has
! been undistinguished in its exe
j cution of fundamentals, particu
larly in the category of lobbing
the ball at the hoop. The Indians
] have no "deadeyes" such as the
other conference clubs do, and as
! a result suffer in the department
\ of scoring.
, But that does not prevent the
| Injuns from pitching the sphere at
the circle as often as does the op
; position, and as in the case of mak
ing ham and eggs, to throw the ball
one must first have it.
And so in this otherwise dis
mal season, the one excuse given
" for continuing to beat the Indian
tom-tom is that they never have
stopped fighting no matter what
i the score was or how far behind
they were. It is this performance
of sheer scrap on the part of the
Indians tiiat has kept the season
from being a complete flop.
And where you find men still ca
j pable of fighting, you find men still
j capable of winning; not that we are
| trying to tell anyone that the In
j diuns will win either Friday or Sat
i uiiday, but stranger things have oc
curred in the cockeyed realm of
j sports. This is still very much the
day of the upset and there is noth
| ing that is less of a cinch than a
\ traditional ball game, be it a major
! sport or ping-pong.
