# Nimitz Still Undefeated
## 
### 
The undefeated Nimitz cage
squad held onto undisputed pos
session of first place in League I of
the intramural program last night
by giving a 34-10 lacing to Fillmore.
The entire Nimitz team seemed to
he on fire as scoring honors were
almost evenly divided among four
of the Navy men; Moser led the
parade with seven points while
three of his teammates followed
with six. Milton took top honors for
the losers with six of Fillmore's ten
points to his credit.
In a much closer game, Encina
1W shaded the Pierce five, 22-17.
Trailing 11-10 at halftime, the En
cina boys came from behind to take
the game and third place in League
V. Evans for Encina and Linn for
Pierce tied for high point man,
each bucketing nine points.
The Phi Psi's moved into a tie
for second place in League I by
virtue of a forfeiture from Johnson,
their scheduled opponents. The
Johnson boys, by failing to show
up, dropped well out of the race
for the League I title.
The evening's play saw no great
changes in any of the leagues'
standings; Nimitz, the only first

place team to see action, came
through with colors flying to main
tain first place in League I and an
undefeated record.
