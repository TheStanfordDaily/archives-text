# Redwoods Women Given Preference
## 
### 
Housing Committee yesterday de
cided to give women in Redwoods
preference over their class in room
drawing along with the sponsors
who are moving to a different resi
dence from which they came.
The committee also decided to
extend an invitation to all new
women in Redwoods to attend the
open houses Sunday. These deci
sions were necessitated by the com
plete shrinking of Redwoods at the
end of this quarter, so that it can
be turned back to the men.
