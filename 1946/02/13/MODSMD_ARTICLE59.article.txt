# Walt Whitman Poetry Read
## 
### 
Alfred Grommon, assistant pro
fessor of education and English,
read yesterday afternoon from the
poetry of Walt Whitman, who is
often talked about, but seldom road.
Mr. Grommon began by reading
a short poem entitled "Facing West
ward from California Shores," and
then "Tears." After the short poems,
he read the long symphonic "Out
of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking,"
which deals with the meaning of
Jove.
In conclusion, Mr. Grommon read
Whitman's lengthy masterpiece,
"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard
Bloom'd." This poem was written
about Lincoln in the year of his as
sassination, and represents many of
Whitman's ideals. Both of Whit
man's long poems are symphonic
trilogies.
