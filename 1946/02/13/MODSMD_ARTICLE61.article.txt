Over 100 persons turned out to
hear Frank Goulette and his Fire
water Five play "hot jazz" and
"deep blues" songs at the meeting
of (he Hot Jazz Society Monday in
the Nitery.
Starting the evening with six
players, the band gradually in
creased with the arrival of capipus
musicians who brought their own
instruments to join in the jazz ses
sion. Among the unexpected play
ers were Fran Case on the piano
and Bee Bowman, who sang two
blues numbers.
After the regular program, the
players held their own jam session.
The band is planning another live
jazz show, to be presented by the
Hot Jazz Society in about three
weeks.
