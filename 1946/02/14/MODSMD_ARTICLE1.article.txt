# Ickes Leaves Cabinet; Argentine Break Near
## Interior Secretary Warns Against Political Perjury 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 (UP). — Harold L.
Ickes resigned as secretary of Interior today
and then climaxed a caustic exchange of let
ters with President Truman by telling the na
tion tonight that he could not stay in the Tru
man cabinet and still retain '"my

....... A...i ivk.j.. » iij
self-respect."
The outspoken Ickes, who gave
the lie to President Truman and
told him he would not serve under
him again, urged in a radio speech
that the U. S. attorney general j
"assign one of his ablest lawyers" j
to investigate the denial of Fdwin
W. Pauley, made under oath, that ;
he tried to influence the govern
ment in the tidelands oil case.
Ickes* resignation was prompted
by his opposition to the President's
choice of Pauley, California oil man
and former Democratic national j
treasurer, to be undersecretary of )
Navy.
Earlier in the day, the 71-year-old 1
"curmudgeon" had told a press con
ference that" I do not care to stay
in an administration where I am
expected to commit perjury for the j
sake of the party." His talk with !
newsmen came after he had sent a
3,500-word letter of resignation to !
the White House, emphasizing in \
blunt language his break from Mr. i
Truman's official family.
Assistant Secretary of Interior
Oscar L. Chapman will run the de
partment until Mr. Truman names j
a permanent successor.
Carrying his light to the nation j
by radio (ARC network) Ickes
reiterated tonight that Pauley did
not tell "the truth" before the
committee.
Ickes also told the radio audience j
that scarcely an hour before he tes
tified, he was told by Mr. Truman
"of course you will have to tell the
truth but be as gentle as you can :
with Ed Pauley."
"In the light of succeeding cir- i
cuinstances," Ickes said, "I may !
be permitted to doubt whether the j
President was not speaking in a I
Pickwickian sense when he told
me to tell the truth."
Restating that doubt later in his !
radio speech, he went on to say that j
he told the truth, yet the President
"was unwilling to see me" there- j
after and invited him to leave the j
cabinet Friday—instead of on March
31, as he had suggested.
