choose a queen to reign over its
hall. Excom decided with its ap
proval of Women's Conference
minutes. Doug Crawford. NRO,
argued that queens arc a Navy
tradition, and one always reigns
over the annual Annapolis "Ring"

was limited to the Navy unit only.
The Frosh Pictorial, a booklet
containing individual pictures of
each member of the freshman class,
will be published by the Quad, and
will appear early next fall. Excom
felt that, the Quad was the organ
ization best able to handle this job,
and working on the Pictorial will
greatly ease Quad production next
year, according to Ann Lilicnthal,
Quad business manager.
Excom approved a budget of
$54(i for the spring quarter Keg

was also passed. Other subjects
approved by Excom last night
were
(1) Purchase of an Invisible Pass

pus dances. Featuring a "special
fluorescent stamp pad ink," the sys
tem involves stamping each dancer
on the back of the hand. The stamp,
ordinarily invisible, appears in
flowing numbers when a black
light is focused on it. This will pre
vent couples from coming to dances
without purchasing tickets.

ized Hiking Club as an independent,
unchartered organization.
