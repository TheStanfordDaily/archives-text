### 
Lockouts, violations of the Fun
damental Standard, and other situ
ations requiring action by Men's
and Women's Council occur fre
quently and subsequent complaints
concerning the decisions of these
two judicial bodies run rampant,
according to Carl Burke, Election
Board chairman.
It seems strange, then, that
often the only time an active in
terest in Council is manifested by
the student body is when actual
cases arise, rather than when
student opinion can have the most
effect—at election time, he added.

neering corners nomination blanks

Stanford Athletic Board (formerly
the 8.A.C.) may also be obtained at

Also up for student vote in the
election is the new constitution
adopted last spring on a trial basis.
The new constitution has al
tered the earlier system of class
representation on Excom
to one of area representation.
Under class representation two
representatives on Excom were
selected from each of the upper
three classes. Under area repre
sentation designated living group
areas elect their representative
who is responsible to each living
group president who is, in turn,
responsible to the members of his
house.
Another change incorporated into
the new constitution gives the
power of administrative boards to
the formerly subsidiary organiza
tions of Women's Conference, Pub
lications Council, Activities Coun
cil, Dramatic Council, Debate Coun
cil, and Women's Athletic Associa
tion.
This gives these organizations the
power to make rules for themselves
rather than having to rely on Ex
com for their laws. Excom reserves
the right to veto any rules made by
an administrative board with the
consent of two-thirds of its mem
bers.

who is responsible to each living
group president who is, in turn,
responsible to the members of his

the new constitution gives the
power of administrative boards to
the formerly subsidiary organiza
tions of Women's Conference, Pub

tion.
