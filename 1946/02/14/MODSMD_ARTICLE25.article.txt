# For Better Representation
## 
### 
It's a changing world, a changing Stanford,
and V/ednesday we will be given the voters'
privilege cf deciding whether or not we want
to change our representation on Excom, chief
arm of student government, from the old, and
perhaps defunct, class plan to a system based
upon campus areas, which is incorporated in
ih j new ASSU Constitution.
By adopting the area plan, we will be taking
a forward step toward insuring that every
Stanford studont can, if he wants, assume a
sp " .king role in our government. We will be
utilising the most stable and continuous or
ganizations, those of the living groups, in a
new and constructive pattern.
Let's consider why the living group has
been chosen as the unit that best affords rep
resentation. First, it is in our residences that
we get the chance to exchange opinions when
and where we feel like it. It's the logical place
to get together and talk about issues concern
ing the campus, along with the particular

problems of the residence â€”the place where
ideas about student affairs can originate and
where Excom can send back for discussion
the various items on its agenda.
How will it be carried out? There is a di
rect channel for action between the voters as
a whole and Excom.
Your Excom area representative can meet
with the intermediary organizations, such as
Row Excom, Lagunita Excom (and when they
are actively functioning, Interfraternity Coun
cil and Interhall Council), which are com
posed of the president of each residence
v/ithin that particular area. The presidents
can carry information about our student gov
ernment back to their houses, where each
individual student will be able to express
his views.
Surely, this system makes for better rep
resentation, and for the ultimate goal of af
fording students the opportunity to take a
more active part in ASSU government.
