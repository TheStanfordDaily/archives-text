THE MISSINO SOCIAL CHAIRMEN
Perhaps it is not generally known, but there are
social chairmen on this campus. Now that a new
era nd a new ratio has descended upon Stanford
nr. w • going to throw out our lod friends or are we
goiriK t i see to it that they will, through more co
operation and organization, do a bettpr job for us?
Many of us have heard complaints from the
men's halls that the organization is not functioning.
To tell the truth, if something does not happen
prfiiy soon it will be completely extinct. The social
chairmen on campus have potentially a job with
endless opportunity for activity and real service.
The fault of the present system is mainly that
many houses on campus have no standard proce
dures or interested people designated as social
chairmen. As long as each living group has the
system, however, we might as well give it a fair
trial; or if no one is interested, let's forget, hte whole
thing.
W< are here to do a job but without cooperation,
v/e mi; lit as well resign.
Lagunita Social Chairman
HOW ABOUT THAT?
Dear Editor:
Would you please suggest to the firehouse that

they observe the national tradition by taking down
the Stars and Stripes at sundown instead ol leaving
it up all night long:
I have telephoned twice within the short period
of a week and absolutely NOTHING whatsoever
has been done concerning the matter . . . the flag
still remains up all night.
Everyone else seems to conform to that particular
American tradition without disobedience, why can't
they? It is a sheer matter of respect for the flag of
our country.
I would appreciate your bringing this to their
attention very much. Thank you.
8.8.
(Editorial note: Thank you, 8.8. It's about time
someone got off the dime about that flag, or we
won't deserve to have one.)
