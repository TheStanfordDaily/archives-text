### ELLIOTT EPSTEEN 
There is a possibility that a lot of industrial
strife and the trend from boom to bust could
be eliminated if the country adopted one
standard wage system.
Fifty thousand workers are now being
paid in fifty-two weekly installments. The
companies calculate a production schedule
for each department. They pay each worker
for his share in it in fifty-two weekly install
ments. Over-production brings a bonus, and,
if a department underproduces, it owes the
company so much work.
At present, it is impossible to calculate
very accurately the sales in a coming year
because not too many people know how
much money they are going to make. The

miscalculations produce more layoffs, and a
greater margin of error in the original cal
culations themselves.
NEW SYSTEM ADVANTAGE
Eut, under the other system, every indus
trial and farm worker would know what he
was going to make at the beginning of the
year, and could figure out what he wanted.
The plants could accurately calculate what
they were going to produce.
Since the economy of the country is in
terlocking, it seems that statistical correla
tions between expected worker income and
expected small-businessman and profes
sional income could be calculated.
Also, in the plants now covered by this
system, there is no industrial strife.
