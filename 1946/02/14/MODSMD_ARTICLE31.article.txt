The Record Is Sfl Delightful
This record week was marked by
the release of another new Woody
Herman platter. This time it's "Let
It Snow" backed by "Everybody
Knew but Me," and these two num
bers, although not extraordinary,
are very well taken care of by the
thundering herd. Both sides feature
vocal choruses by the old Wood~
chopper himself, and "Let It Snow"
is graced with a very pleasant cho
rus by the. number one trombonist
in the nation, Bill Harris. Played on
a valve trombone, Bill's chorus is
not as exciting as some of his pre
vious efforts, but, nevertheless, he
demonstrates his superiority on his
instrument. Both numbers also
contain solos by ace tenorman Flip
Phillips, who is in his usual mellow
groove.
To High Ilcaven, Yet
This is the record of the hour,
jof the year, of the century! This
j disc will mark a turning point in
I jazz. Be sure not to miss Sammy
Kaye's "I Didn't Mean a Word I
Said." The label on the record says
, "Vocal by Billy Williams. Recita
tion by Sammy Kaye." This had us
stumped until somewhere among
the grooves, the awful truth came
out! Mr. Kaye recites the lyrics of
! the song as one would recite a
| poem. He sounds like a cross be
| tween one of the Ink Spots and
Ted Lewis.
We are sure that Harold Adamson
and Jimmy McHugh, who wrote the
words and music, do not appreciate
the swinging and swaying band's
efforts to put their tune down in
musical history. To make matters
worse, Billy Williams, who takes
the vocal, sounds like a fugitive
from Bob Nolan and the Sons of the
j Pioneers.
The reverse is not quite as bad.
, In fact, it is a cute little song that is
j ruthlessly tortured by Billy Wil
liams and then by the band. "At
lanta Ga." (pronounced "Atlanta
G.A."), written by Sunny Skylar, is
the name of this Kaye victim. Mar
ring the record even more is the
appearance of a horrible muted
trumpet solo near the beginning of
! the side. This will probably be the
largest selling record Sammy Kaye
| has had in years.
Why Didn't You Do Right?
Knowing the capabilities of Ben
ny Goodman, his last few discs have
been very disappointing, and his
latest is no exception. "Give Me
the Simple Life" and"I Wish I
Could Tell You" comprise his new
est offering to the listening public.
Featuring Liza Morrow on the lyr
ics of both numbers, the sides are
adequate but very unexciting. The
lack of good material handicaps the
artists, but this could be remedied
by Mr. Clarinet keeping his eye
more on the jazz public's wants and
less on his own pocketbook.
Miss Morrow, although possess
ing good potentialities, still needs
much polish to get her into the class
of other more popular band thrush
es. BG has an uninspired solo on
each number, but the side picks up
with the presence of a lively alto
solo. The ensemble work is good
throughout both surfaces, but some
how the whole thing leaves us flat.
[ Holiday for Swing—and Erskine
One of the few Victor artists left,
: Erskine Hawkins is getting a very
j big play by that company. His ncw
' est recording, "Holiday for Swing"
j and"I Guess I'll Have to Get Along
j Without You," proves that Victor
1 still has some talent left under its
wing. The first offering is an ordi
nary jump tune highlighting a bad
| riff, a very good arrangement, a
bad screeching trumpet by Huw
' kins himself, and the appearance
of a fine tenor solo. The ensemble
really rocks and makes this side
enjoyable.
Turning the record over we find
a number that sounds very similar
to "I'll Buy That Dream" and is
marked "by the appearance of Do
lores Brown on vocal. Miss Brown
has a lot of quality in her voice, but
she needs more experience in
phrasing and interpretation. The
Twentieth Century Gabriel (Erskine
Hawkins to his more intimates) has
another solo trumpet spot on this
side, and this time he plays in a
much lower register to the enjoy
ment of all, even though he does
sound like Harry James. The same
tenor featured on "Holiday for
Swing" appears on this, but he
seems very uninspired and spirit
less.
A Word to the Wise
The new music magazine "Note."
i This magazine is edited by the
t noted jazz critic and former editor
| of the "Capitol," Dave Dexter, Jr.,

who attempts, and very success
fully, to keep the musical views of
the magazine liberal and Tree from
a definite policy toward jazz. The
material is good and the presenta
tation is good, and it will take its
place with Metronome, Esquire, and
Downbeat as one of the best jazz
magazines in the nation. Note es
pecially the article in this month's
issue by George Fraizer.

musical history. To make matters
worse, Billy Williams, who takes
the vocal, sounds like a fugitive
from Bob Nolan and the Sons of the
j Pioneers.
The reverse is not quite as bad.
, In fact, it is a cute little song that is
j ruthlessly tortured by Billy Wil
liams and then by the band. "At
lanta Ga." (pronounced "Atlanta
G.A."), written by Sunny Skylar, is
the name of this Kaye victim. Mar
ring the record even more is the
appearance of a horrible muted
trumpet solo near the beginning of
! the side. This will probably be the
largest selling record Sammy Kaye
| has had in years.
Why Didn't You Do Right?
Knowing the capabilities of Ben
ny Goodman, his last few discs have
been very disappointing, and his
latest is no exception. "Give Me
the Simple Life" and"I Wish I
Could Tell You" comprise his new
est offering to the listening public.
Featuring Liza Morrow on the lyr
ics of both numbers, the sides are
adequate but very unexciting. The
lack of good material handicaps the
artists, but this could be remedied
by Mr. Clarinet keeping his eye
more on the jazz public's wants and
less on his own pocketbook.
Miss Morrow, although possess
ing good potentialities, still needs
much polish to get her into the class
of other more popular band thrush
es. BG has an uninspired solo on
each number, but the side picks up
with the presence of a lively alto
solo. The ensemble work is good
throughout both surfaces, but some
how the whole thing leaves us flat.
[ Holiday for Swing—and Erskine
One of the few Victor artists left,
: Erskine Hawkins is getting a very
j big play by that company. His ncw
' est recording, "Holiday for Swing"
j and"I Guess I'll Have to Get Along
j Without You," proves that Victor
1 still has some talent left under its
wing. The first offering is an ordi
nary jump tune highlighting a bad
| riff, a very good arrangement, a
bad screeching trumpet by Huw
' kins himself, and the appearance
of a fine tenor solo. The ensemble
really rocks and makes this side
enjoyable.
Turning the record over we find
a number that sounds very similar
to "I'll Buy That Dream" and is
marked "by the appearance of Do
lores Brown on vocal. Miss Brown
has a lot of quality in her voice, but
she needs more experience in
phrasing and interpretation. The
Twentieth Century Gabriel (Erskine
Hawkins to his more intimates) has
another solo trumpet spot on this
side, and this time he plays in a
much lower register to the enjoy
ment of all, even though he does
sound like Harry James. The same
tenor featured on "Holiday for
Swing" appears on this, but he
seems very uninspired and spirit
less.
A Word to the Wise
The new music magazine "Note."
i This magazine is edited by the
t noted jazz critic and former editor
| of the "Capitol," Dave Dexter, Jr.,

who attempts, and very success
fully, to keep the musical views of
the magazine liberal and Tree from
a definite policy toward jazz. The
material is good and the presenta
tation is good, and it will take its
place with Metronome, Esquire, and
Downbeat as one of the best jazz
magazines in the nation. Note es
pecially the article in this month's
issue by George Fraizer.
The Record Is Sfl Delightful
This record week was marked by
the release of another new Woody
Herman platter. This time it's "Let
It Snow" backed by "Everybody
Knew but Me," and these two num
bers, although not extraordinary,
are very well taken care of by the
thundering herd. Both sides feature
vocal choruses by the old Wood~
chopper himself, and "Let It Snow"
is graced with a very pleasant cho
rus by the. number one trombonist
in the nation, Bill Harris. Played on
a valve trombone, Bill's chorus is
not as exciting as some of his pre
vious efforts, but, nevertheless, he
demonstrates his superiority on his
instrument. Both numbers also
contain solos by ace tenorman Flip
Phillips, who is in his usual mellow
groove.
To High Ilcaven, Yet
This is the record of the hour,
jof the year, of the century! This
j disc will mark a turning point in
I jazz. Be sure not to miss Sammy
Kaye's "I Didn't Mean a Word I
Said." The label on the record says
, "Vocal by Billy Williams. Recita
tion by Sammy Kaye." This had us
stumped until somewhere among
the grooves, the awful truth came
out! Mr. Kaye recites the lyrics of
! the song as one would recite a
| poem. He sounds like a cross be
| tween one of the Ink Spots and
Ted Lewis.
We are sure that Harold Adamson
and Jimmy McHugh, who wrote the
words and music, do not appreciate
the swinging and swaying band's
efforts to put their tune down in
musical history. To make matters
worse, Billy Williams, who takes
the vocal, sounds like a fugitive

[ Holiday for Swing—and Erskine
One of the few Victor artists left,
: Erskine Hawkins is getting a very
j big play by that company. His ncw
' est recording, "Holiday for Swing"
j and"I Guess I'll Have to Get Along
j Without You," proves that Victor
1 still has some talent left under its
wing. The first offering is an ordi
nary jump tune highlighting a bad
| riff, a very good arrangement, a
bad screeching trumpet by Huw
' kins himself, and the appearance
of a fine tenor solo. The ensemble
really rocks and makes this side
enjoyable.
Turning the record over we find
a number that sounds very similar
to "I'll Buy That Dream" and is
marked "by the appearance of Do
lores Brown on vocal. Miss Brown
has a lot of quality in her voice, but
she needs more experience in
phrasing and interpretation. The
Twentieth Century Gabriel (Erskine
Hawkins to his more intimates) has
another solo trumpet spot on this
side, and this time he plays in a
much lower register to the enjoy
ment of all, even though he does
sound like Harry James. The same
tenor featured on "Holiday for
Swing" appears on this, but he
seems very uninspired and spirit
less.
A Word to the Wise
The new music magazine "Note."
i This magazine is edited by the
t noted jazz critic and former editor
| of the "Capitol," Dave Dexter, Jr.,

who attempts, and very success
fully, to keep the musical views of
the magazine liberal and Tree from
a definite policy toward jazz. The
material is good and the presenta
tation is good, and it will take its
place with Metronome, Esquire, and
Downbeat as one of the best jazz
magazines in the nation. Note es
pecially the article in this month's
issue by George Fraizer.
The Record Is Sfl Delightful
This record week was marked by
the release of another new Woody
Herman platter. This time it's "Let
It Snow" backed by "Everybody
Knew but Me," and these two num
bers, although not extraordinary,
are very well taken care of by the
thundering herd. Both sides feature
vocal choruses by the old Wood~
chopper himself, and "Let It Snow"
is graced with a very pleasant cho
rus by the. number one trombonist
in the nation, Bill Harris. Played on
a valve trombone, Bill's chorus is
not as exciting as some of his pre
vious efforts, but, nevertheless, he
demonstrates his superiority on his
instrument. Both numbers also
contain solos by ace tenorman Flip
Phillips, who is in his usual mellow
groove.
To High Ilcaven, Yet
This is the record of the hour,
jof the year, of the century! This
j disc will mark a turning point in
I jazz. Be sure not to miss Sammy
Kaye's "I Didn't Mean a Word I
Said." The label on the record says
, "Vocal by Billy Williams. Recita
tion by Sammy Kaye." This had us
stumped until somewhere among
the grooves, the awful truth came
out! Mr. Kaye recites the lyrics of
! the song as one would recite a
| poem. He sounds like a cross be
| tween one of the Ink Spots and
Ted Lewis.
We are sure that Harold Adamson
and Jimmy McHugh, who wrote the
words and music, do not appreciate
the swinging and swaying band's
efforts to put their tune down in
musical history. To make matters
worse, Billy Williams, who takes
the vocal, sounds like a fugitive
from Bob Nolan and the Sons of the
j Pioneers.
The reverse is not quite as bad.
, In fact, it is a cute little song that is
j ruthlessly tortured by Billy Wil
liams and then by the band. "At
lanta Ga." (pronounced "Atlanta
G.A."), written by Sunny Skylar, is
the name of this Kaye victim. Mar
ring the record even more is the
appearance of a horrible muted
trumpet solo near the beginning of
! the side. This will probably be the
largest selling record Sammy Kaye
| has had in years.
Why Didn't You Do Right?
Knowing the capabilities of Ben
ny Goodman, his last few discs have
been very disappointing, and his
latest is no exception. "Give Me
the Simple Life" and"I Wish I
Could Tell You" comprise his new
est offering to the listening public.
Featuring Liza Morrow on the lyr
ics of both numbers, the sides are
adequate but very unexciting. The
lack of good material handicaps the
artists, but this could be remedied
by Mr. Clarinet keeping his eye
more on the jazz public's wants and
less on his own pocketbook.
Miss Morrow, although possess
ing good potentialities, still needs
much polish to get her into the class
of other more popular band thrush
es. BG has an uninspired solo on
each number, but the side picks up
with the presence of a lively alto
solo. The ensemble work is good
throughout both surfaces, but some
how the whole thing leaves us flat.
