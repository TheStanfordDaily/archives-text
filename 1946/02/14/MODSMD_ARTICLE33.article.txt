# Interfraternity Council To Meet with Tresidder
## 
### 
Dr. Tresidder has invited the In
terfraternity Council to meet with
him at his house at 7:30 Monday
evening to discuss the problems
which have arisen in the plans to
turn the fraternity houses back to
the local chapters next autumn
quarter, it was announced in the
Interfraternity Council meeting on
Tuesday night.
Ed Luce, Council president, in
explaining the meeting to the rep
resentatives, stated that Dr. Tres
idder had asked that any other
fraternity men who were interested
also be invited to attend Monday
night's discussion.
Supervision Main Concern
Main concern of the meeting will
be the matter of supervision for the
houses next year â€” whether it

should be through house mothers,
j or through an interfraternity "com
missioner" appointed jointly by
| (he University and Interfraternity
Board. The latter plan has been
j formulated by an advisory commit
j tee appointed by Ihe Interfraternity
I Board for the purpose of investi
gating such possibilities. It is pat
terned after a successful similar
. plan used at Dartmouth.
Dr. Tresidder has planned Mon
day's meeting in order that he may
hear the student viewpoint before
he takes the matter before the
Board of Trustees late this month.
Meeting Places Set
The Council voted to assess each
: fraternity at the rate of one dollar
per active member to form a fund
; on which to run the Council and
Board.
Luce announced that Mr. Sharp
has opened the dining rooms of the
former Deke and Phi Kap houses
to all fraternities who wish to use
them for house meetings, and re
quested that if possible all chap
ters use either of these locations or
private homes for their meetings,
since meetings in the other men's
residences were causing complaints
from the other occupants.
