## 
### 
Underdogs at odds that are any
where from 50 to 500 to 1, Stanford's
cagers take to the Berkeley court
tomorrow night with not much
more thJn a prayer and more than
their share of scrap in an attempt
to halt California's southern divi
sion title-bound Bears.
In an attempt to bolster the sag
ping Indians, Coach Everett Dean
has juddgled his reserves, bringing
up from the junior varsity forward
John Muir who will probably team
up with Jack Meredith to spell reg
ular up-court men Gene Martin and
Tom Hood.
Maj'tin and Hood have been as
signed starting berths at for
ward, while either Tom Murphy or
Bill O'Brien will handle the start

ing pivot position, and Capt. Bill
Christiansen and Tom Rodman will
start at the backcourt spots.
California's lineup has been set
for some 20-odd games this season,
with Andy Wolfe and Merv Lafaille
at forwards, Jim Smith at center,
and Jim Wray and Bob Hogeboom
at the guards.
The Indians lay off today, follow
ing two sharp scrimmages Tuesday
and Wednesday, and are reportedly
in top shape for their week-end set
to with the hot Beais.
The Bears, with a nine and one
conference record, need but one
more triumph to sew up the title
and are overwhelmingly favored to
hand the Redskins their 11th and
12th circuit losses.
