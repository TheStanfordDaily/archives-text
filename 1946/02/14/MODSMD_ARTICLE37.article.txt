Assistant Spcits Editor
The letter which is reprinted in this column was received at
the Daily Shack yesterday. From the handwriting itt was with
out doubt written by some "woman."
Editor, Stanford Daily:
Why waste money sending our Sports Editor down to Los
Angeles, when the best he can do is come back and write an
article like the one on the front page of yesterday's Daily? (Mon
day's Editionâ€”Ed.) There will probably be plenty of other ;
papers panning our team without our doing it. If we can't even
stand behind our own team, the Stanford players really have no
reason for trying to win a game for us. If Mr. Levinson can do
r othing else, he can at least give us the facts, omitting such
"cute" remarks as "Since we weren't throwing horseshoes, near
hits didn't mean a darn thing."
(signed) A Disgusted Indian"
It is the belief of this scribe that the "disgusted Indian"
knows little about the finer arts of newspaper printing, and is
definitely talking through her bonnet. In the first place, Art
Levinson did not say anything against the Stanford team di-'
rectly, but rather presented the facts accurately with a bit of
humor thrown in to liven up the story a little.
THREE ALTERNATIVES
Art had three possible ways to write the article. He could
have written it with excuses, explanations, and apologies to why
tire team didn't do better, but this would have been a falsifica
tion of the facts, and would have given the readers a distorted
picture of the game and the team.
Secondly, he could have given the straight facts which would :
not have been as complimentary to the team, or interesting in
themselves since no one likes to read about other people's vic
tories, and furthermore facts can became very boring unless you
ere a statistician.
The third possibility is the one Art used to write the article.
He attempted to make the best out of a situation which was not
too good, and strike a compromise between objective reporting i
and pleasing the reading public.
FORTUNATE OUR OWN WRITER COVERED IT
The "disgusted Indian" is very correct about other papers ;
panning our team. The other papers, especially those of Los
Angeles, really laid into the team, till you wondered whether
v.ou had a team or not. It was guite fortunate that one of our own |
writers could cover the game, instead of having to use a United
Press article, which would not have been very complimentary. !
We of the sports staff have supported the basketball team j
from the beginning, and we will keep on supporting it as long as
they continue to play. I think it would be rather difficult to find
a Daily this quarter which does not have a story on the basket- |
ball team, and these articles by no means panned the Stanford
?guad and the fighting spirit they have had all quarter.
MISINTERPRETATION
Before we close our "defense" it might be well to say some- !
thing about the quote in Art's story that appeared in the "dis- |
ousted Indian" letter. I was very much surprised that such a !
sparkling gem of humor, v/hich so seldom appears in the Daily,
should be so grossly misinterpreted. It seems quite obvious to
this writer that the Sports Editor is complimenting; not tearing
down, the team. He is implying by this bit of humor that the |
Card team made a lot of shots at the basket, and the oSfense was
but their eye was not guite accurate enough.
We sincerely hope that other students did not interpret the
article in the same light that the "disgusted Indian gal" did.
