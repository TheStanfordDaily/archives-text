# Strikes' End Is Indicated
## 
### 
NEW YORK. Feb. 13 (UP).—The
nation's major strike troubles were j
: clearing tonight in the face of grow
j ing indications that very soon, per
i haps in weeks, industry will be
j humming again—making peacetime |
| products for the starved domestic j
j market.
Most optimistic of developments
I was today's statement of Iron Age,
j authoritative trade paper of the
i steel industry, that a settlement of I
I hte steel strike was all but signed,
sealed, and delivered and the 750,000
j steel workers would be back at their |
! jobs if not by the end of this week.
; then the early part of next.
New York City's crippling tug j
j boat strike, which had reduced the j
i fuel supplies of its more than 7,000,- !
| 000 people to a dangerous low, has j
I ended. Negotiators of union and op- i
j erators conferred and both sides j
agreed to arbitration.
In the key automobile industry, j
General Motors was only one cent
away from a wage settlement with 1
the United Automobile Workers j
' (CIO), the union of its striking 175,-
000 car makers. There seemed no ,
j doubt that a settlement of the steel
; strike will end this strike too, the
; first in the ClO's battle for increased
peacetime wage scales.
