# Roughs Form Glee Club
## 
### 
For the first time in 20 years,
Stanford will have a men's glee
club. Enough musically minded
roughs appeared at the meeting
Tuesday night to form the nucleus
of an excellent organization, ac
cording to Aver ill Mix, new steer
ing committee chairman.
At the meeting, the club was
organized and plans for the possi
bility of appearances on the cam
pus and elsewhere were dis
cussed. A steering committee was
appointed consisting of Averill
Mix, chairman, Charles Is. McVay
IV. Marshall Iljcltc. Harlan La
ner, and Itonahl White.
Joel Carter, assistant director of
choir, will direct the group, and Dr.
Herbert Jan Popper, associate pro
cessor of music, will advise. The
repertoire of the club will consist
chiefly of Stanford songs, light clas
sics, and modern popular music ar
ranged for men's chorus.
It is hoped that the club will be
able to expand beyond its present
size. All men with or without ex
perience, including N.R.O.T.C.
students, who are interested in
joining the organization are urged
to appear at the first rehearsal of
the club Tuesday from i to (J
p.in. at a place to be announced
later.
This rehearsal time may be
changed in the future, and any in
terested man who is unable to at
tend at that time is requested to get
in touch with any member of the
steering committee.
