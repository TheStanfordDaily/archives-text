# Vet Housing Plans Still Indefinite
## 
### 
More specific information from |
the FHPA was not available last !
night to define the "single - story j
barracks type buildings" at Tan
foran which according to wire re
leases have been turned over to
Stanford to alleviate its housing
problem for married veterans.
Whether the housing is the Quon
set huts Stanford originally applied
for, and with what conditions the
housing will be turned over to
Stanford, were questions still up
permost in the minds of University
officials who were still hopeful that
their housing problem, campus "bo
gey" for a quarter and a half, was
over.
Reports would indicate that suf- j
ficient housing for 100 veterans and j
families would be available some |
time after March 1 when the Navy I
I quits Tanforan. Another obstacle
I which officials will have to face is
j the leasing of the land from the
j Mills Estate on which the housing
j now stands.
j The Quorvset huts were described
as consisting of two apartments
each, with a living room, kitchen
ette, and bath with shower, simply
but attractively furnished.
Assuming the housing to be the
Quonset huts, University officials
could not remember seeing any j
â–  "single - story barrack - type build
' ings" on their inspection tour last j
j quarter of Tanforan.
