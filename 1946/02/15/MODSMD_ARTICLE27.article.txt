# To Help Ourselves
## 
### 
Th 9 formal agreement for the United
Statos' three and three-quarter billion dol
lar loan to the United Kingdom set forth its
purposes as follows:
To facilitate purchases by the United King
dom of goods and services from the United
Stoics; to assist the United Kingdom to meet
transitional postwar deficits in its current
ba\ 'ce of payments; to help the United
Kingdom to maintain adequate reserves of
gold and dollars; and to assist the United
Kiii jdcm to assume the obligations of multi
lateral trade.
No amount of griping in the United States
about "there goes money that WE need," or
in Britain about the restrictions placed upon
disposal of the funds in trade, can nullify the
plain facts that our lean will accomplish
these things for Britain.
What many perhaps neglect to consider
are the further worldwide benefits of such
a loan—the chance it has given to the United
States to advance the aims of the Bretton
Woods agreement and to prevent an eco
nomically divided world.
We are taking $3,750,000,000 worth of risk
that our loan will keep the United Kingdom
industrially and, in consequence, politically
strong. Because the question of strong dip
lomatic alliances in a newly-created world of
"equal nations" is a touchy one, we can NOT
ignore the importance of a strong democratic
ally against totalitarian encroachments, and
in aiding the establishment of democracy in
trau. ition governments abroad.
Vve are bolstering the English economy—
preventing domestically the most drastic ra
tioning of food and clothing ever known to
the nation, and giving her the dollar sources
with which to buy from abroad the goods she
needs immediately.
But the benefit to us? Obviously, affording
means to England for increased production
and a large volume of trade indirectly bene
iits us. Not alone a competitor in world
markets, England is one of the principal na

tions with whom we trade. And her trade
with other nations gives them the purchas
ing power by which she can, in turn, pur
chase from us.
Further, with England on the verge of eco
nomic chaos, as she had been until receiving
our six-year grant, she would almost cer
tainly turn to a rigidly controlled economy,
functioning externally on bilateral trade
agreements that would badly twist the nat
ural world economy.
Markets that normally and most expedient
ly belong to one nation will be awarded to
whatever other nation is prepared to prom
ise reciprocal markets, perhaps crippling the
trade channels and curtailing the production
of other "innocent" nations.
By the policy agreement that went with
our loan, England has argeed to turn in the
other direction and steer, as far as possible,
clear of pre-arranged trade quotas and goods
exchange.
In line of commercial policy, the United
Kingdom agreed to the reduction in use of
British preferential tariffs; the collaboration
in reduction of trade barriers generally, in
curbing the restrictive practices of cartels—a
large concession for a pro-cartel nation—and
in respect to certain principles governing
international commodity agreements (such
as sugar, wheat, and coffee agreements to
which we are now a member).
Clearly, our aims have not been neglected
in what might seem to be a sympathy loan.
Indeed, it should not be thought of as a
sympathy loan; for restrictions placed on
the use of the money, according to British
economists, will severely hinder Britain's
economic and trade recovery by limiting
the means she would like to use. This fact
is causing acceptance of the loan a bitter
pill for many Britons to swallow. It is up to
the United States to support Great Britain
on her road to recovery, and to give proof of
our support through open, honest, and dem
ocratic policies.—B.M.V.
