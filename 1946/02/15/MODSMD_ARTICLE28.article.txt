# HISTORY—1946
## 
### ELLIOTT EPSTEEN 
It is very unfortunate that Secretary Ickes
was forced to resign. He has a quality that is
very odd in politicians—honesty. Although
he has personal enemies by the score, no
body questioned his integrity.
Ife is also a good administrator, and his
years in the Department of the Interior were
very creditable. Yet he was unpopular.
Alaska wants to make the date of his resigna
tion a territorial holiday.
BATTLER
Mr. Ickes has the qualities necessary to go
much higher in politics than he did. He is
thoroughly trustworthy, and always siding
with the people. He is highly intelligent,
and has a sharp bitter wit that always attracts
attention.
Yet he has forever put national interests
above party interests, and even above his
own. In the early days of his law practice,
ho took civil liberties cases for nothing and
spent a lot of valuable time teaching Ameri
c -.nization to immigrants. In his rise in poli
tics, he fought mafty losing battles that he
knew could not be won, and v/ould make
him unpopular, because he thought that the
side he had chosen was right.
ENEMIES
And, too, he fought too hard. Many poli
ticians did not consider his battle expedient.
His last great fight, over the western tide
lands dispute, put him out of office.
It seems that California claimed a lot of
oil deposits off the coast but within the three
mile limit, and sold them to oil magnates.
Ickes thought that these deposits were being
handled wastefully, and tried to get federal
control over them by claiming the tidelands
as federal property.
Mr. Edwin Pauley, treasurer of the Demo
cratic party, thought this wasn't very good
politics. He suggested that he might get
three hundred thousand dollars in campaign
contributions from California oil men if Ickes
forgot about the tidelands.

Said Ickes: "This is one of the rawest
de*als that I've ever heard."
PAULEY APPOINTMENT
Then Pauley was to be appointed Undersec
retary of the Navy. Mr. Ickes was asked
about this proposition of Pauley's when Ickes
was before the Senate Naval Affairs Commit
tee. He told the truth.
The President sided with Pauley, and Ickes
quit.
FUTURE
It seems that Ickes will be vocal in what ho
thinks is wrong with the Truman adminis
tration. At the next Democratic convention,
Truman can get a renomination if he wants it,
since he will be the President in office then;
and if he doesn't, he will control enough
votes to make whatever slate goes before
the voters a thoroughly Truman one.
It is vaguely possible that the New Dealers
might split off from the Democratic party
sooner or later, and form a third party. But
they would split not only the Democrats but
organized labor and the New Deal's whole j
subsidiary political machinery.
The only winners might be the Republi
cans; and Ickes, who fought for Theodore
Roosevelt on the Bull Moose ticket, has sense
ft |
enough to realize that a new third party
would gum up everything.
REPUBLICANS
Ickas is a Republican of long standing, and
he might make a rapprochement with them.
But it is doubtful that he would do this
through sheer spite. He is thoroughly com
mitted to the New Deal policies; and unless
the Republicans thoroughly overhauled their
party, Ickes will probably stick with Truman |
& Co.
As far as his personal influence is con
cerned, it is doubtful that it will be used
against the Truman version of the New Deal.
But his implication of scandal, made in the
heat of anger and sharp disappointment,
might be extremely useful political capital.

sooner or later, and form a third party. But
they would split not only the Democrats but
organized labor and the New Deal's whole j
subsidiary political machinery.
The only winners might be the Republi
cans; and Ickes, who fought for Theodore
Roosevelt on the Bull Moose ticket, has sense
ft |
enough to realize that a new third party
would gum up everything.
REPUBLICANS
Ickas is a Republican of long standing, and
he might make a rapprochement with them.
But it is doubtful that he would do this
through sheer spite. He is thoroughly com
mitted to the New Deal policies; and unless
the Republicans thoroughly overhauled their
party, Ickes will probably stick with Truman |
& Co.
As far as his personal influence is con
cerned, it is doubtful that it will be used
against the Truman version of the New Deal.
But his implication of scandal, made in the
heat of anger and sharp disappointment,
might be extremely useful political capital.
It is very unfortunate that Secretary Ickes
was forced to resign. He has a quality that is
very odd in politicians—honesty. Although
he has personal enemies by the score, no
body questioned his integrity.
Ife is also a good administrator, and his
years in the Department of the Interior were
very creditable. Yet he was unpopular.
Alaska wants to make the date of his resigna
tion a territorial holiday.
BATTLER
Mr. Ickes has the qualities necessary to go
much higher in politics than he did. He is
thoroughly trustworthy, and always siding
with the people. He is highly intelligent,
and has a sharp bitter wit that always attracts
attention.
Yet he has forever put national interests
above party interests, and even above his
own. In the early days of his law practice,
ho took civil liberties cases for nothing and
spent a lot of valuable time teaching Ameri
c -.nization to immigrants. In his rise in poli
tics, he fought mafty losing battles that he
knew could not be won, and v/ould make
him unpopular, because he thought that the
side he had chosen was right.
ENEMIES
And, too, he fought too hard. Many poli
ticians did not consider his battle expedient.
His last great fight, over the western tide
lands dispute, put him out of office.
It seems that California claimed a lot of
oil deposits off the coast but within the three
mile limit, and sold them to oil magnates.
Ickes thought that these deposits were being
handled wastefully, and tried to get federal
control over them by claiming the tidelands
as federal property.
Mr. Edwin Pauley, treasurer of the Demo
cratic party, thought this wasn't very good
politics. He suggested that he might get
three hundred thousand dollars in campaign
contributions from California oil men if Ickes
forgot about the tidelands.

Said Ickes: "This is one of the rawest
de*als that I've ever heard."
PAULEY APPOINTMENT
Then Pauley was to be appointed Undersec
retary of the Navy. Mr. Ickes was asked
about this proposition of Pauley's when Ickes
was before the Senate Naval Affairs Commit
tee. He told the truth.
The President sided with Pauley, and Ickes
quit.
FUTURE
It seems that Ickes will be vocal in what ho
thinks is wrong with the Truman adminis
tration. At the next Democratic convention,
Truman can get a renomination if he wants it,
since he will be the President in office then;
and if he doesn't, he will control enough
votes to make whatever slate goes before
the voters a thoroughly Truman one.
It is vaguely possible that the New Dealers
might split off from the Democratic party
sooner or later, and form a third party. But
they would split not only the Democrats but
organized labor and the New Deal's whole j
subsidiary political machinery.
The only winners might be the Republi
