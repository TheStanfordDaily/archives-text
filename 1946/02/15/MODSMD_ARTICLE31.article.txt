# Truman Seeks New Secretary; Pauley Worried
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 (UP).â€”
President Truman today began
searching for a successor to Secre
tary of Interior Harold L. Ickes, who
leaves the cabinet tomorrow after a
political blowup that rocked the ad
ministration.
All evidence pointed to the selec
tion of a westerner to succeed Ickes.
One immediate effect apparently
was to place in graver jeopardy the
chances of Edwin W. Pauley being
confirmed as Undersecretary of the
Navy. Pauley's chances were none
too bright after Ickes told the Sen
ate Naval Affairs Committee last
week that the California oil man
and former Democratic national
treasurer had promised heavy con
tributions to Democratic coffers by
oil men if Ickes would drop a fed
eral suit for title to oil tidelands.
