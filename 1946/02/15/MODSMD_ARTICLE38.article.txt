LONDON, Feb. 14 (UP). - The
United Nations Security Council
bogged down in a dispute over pro
cedure today when it took up a de
mand by Syria and Lebanon that
French and British troops leave
their territory. As a result, the
Council failed in its attempt to
clean up all business tonight, and
adjourned until tomorrow.
