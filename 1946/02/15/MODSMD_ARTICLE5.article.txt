# Bears Need One Win for Title; Indians Still in Fighting Spirit
## 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
Like so much grist for the mill, Stanford's baskctballers will be
fed into the grinding maw of the Pacific Coast Conference Southern
Division title-playing California Bears tonight at Berkeley and Sat
urday night at the Pavilion.
Or will they?
On the basis of the record, it appears that seldom have ever two

♦ more unequally matched squads
i faccd each other across the boards.
Consequently, from here on in, the
| conference record for the two
clubs (Cal. 9-1, Stanford 0-10)
I will be disregarded.
By all that's right and holy, Cali
fornia is favored by about 500 to 1, or
' is it. 1,000 to 1, to nail the division
bunting to the mast atop the Berke
ley gym tonight, and no questions
asked, either.
The Bears need only one more win
to sew up the pennant, and there is
: nothing the cohorts of Nibs Price
I like better than winning a title, un
| less it is beating Stanford.
Contrary to popular opinion,
based on Cal's outstanding per
formances against Southern Cal.
the only other "good" team in the
Southern division, the Blue and
Gold is far from being a world
beater.
To draw a parallel between now
! and what happened almost to the
i day ten years ago shows that the
| Indians are still very much in the
j ball game and will be there until
about 9:30 tomorrow night.
Feb. 14, 19:16. a squad of red
shirted Indians who numbered
, "Hank" Luisctti, Art Stocfen, Jack
Caldcrwood, Howie Turner, and
Dinty Moore among its members
, went up to Berkeley favored by
some outlandish odds or other to
whip a Cal squad that was not
much better than Stanford is this
year.
To this day nobody knows what
inspired the Bears to rise to such
unprecedented heights that it. not
| only beat what was the best cage
1 squad ever to come out of the West,
| but to set a new record for decisive
victories in the Conference, winning
by a mere G3-P»0.
If Cal could do that to Luisetli's
team, there is no reasoji why Stan
ford could not do that to Andy Wolfe
! and Co., who are a good ball club in
anybody's book, but cannot, by any
, stretch of ridiculous imagination, be
i considered in the same class with the
j 19.'5G-.'JB Farm crew.
According to Coaches Everett
Dean and Fordy Anderson, the
Injuns arc in the best shape they
have been in all season, which
augers well for the Cardinals. Un
fortunately, so is Cal.
The Blue and Gold will start the
same lineup they have used in all
but two games this season: namely,
: Wolfe and Mcrv Lafaille at forward,
Jim Smith at center, and Jim Wray
; and Bob Hogcboom at guard. Asked
j whether or not he would start his
j Big Five for what appears to be a
'cinch" game, Cal Coach "Nibs"
Price replied: "Who else have I got?"
j Anybody know the names of any
1 of Cal's other players?

The Blue and Gold will start the
