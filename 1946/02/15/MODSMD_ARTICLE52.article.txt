### STU MILLAR 
Before an enthusiastic audience
that nearly filled the Pavilion 12
boxers and wrestlers won Stanford
University intramural crowns in
their fcspectnve weight divisions
last night. â€¢
Winners of the boxing tourney
were Tom Kunibe, lightweight;
Ben Wagner, junior welterweight;
John McClure, middleweight;
Yank Levin, light - heavy; and
Sam Streeter, heavyweight.
Mai Mynd?rse and Wilbur Altus
fought to a draw in the senior wel
terweight event.
Grapplers who came out on top
were Jim Johnston, Chris Gavras,
Andy Valenzuela, Bill Iloyt, Dick
Phillips, Bob Hildreth, and Roy
Gaskin.
With each pair wrestling three
2'^-minute rounds, Coach Ted
Mumhy was able to keep two
matches going 011 simultaneously,
speeding the action considerably.
Only three of the victors were
able to register clean-cut wins by
pinning their opponents. They
were Johnston, who pinned Bob
Calvert in the 128-lb. class; Gas
kin. who finished Tom Ilara in
the third round in the heavy
weight match, and Valenzuela,
who pinned Bob Wallace a few
seconds after the opening bell in
the 145-lb. class.
Bill Hoyt showed much finesse in
overcoming Earl Scott to win Coach

i Mumby's praise. He may move up
to the intercollegiate squad soon.
! Other runners-up were A 1 Walker,
! Hal Ward, and Diek Clark.
In the first boxing bout, Tom Ku
nibe was able to overcome Buz
i Lobdell's longer reach with his fak
ing and feinting to register a deci
| sion. Both of these men were box
i ers and spent the majority of the
three rounds looking for openings.
1 Kunibe was responsible for the only
knockdown of the evening, flooring
I Lobdell in the second round.
Compactly built lien Wagner
j charged Bob Staars from rope to
j rope to win a clean-cut victory.
Counter - punching nicely, Wag
! ner often was inside Staars' lead
1 to land some nice blows in close.
In the only draw of the card, Mai
Mynderse and Wilbur Altus ex-
I changed flurries of blows in an
evenly matched fight. Myndcrsc
had the edge in experience, but Al
tus kept punching with a sharp,
straight light to keep his adversary
j worried at all times.
John McClure and Howard
1 Lunceford started slugging at the
opening bell and provided an in
teresting bout until referee Jake Ir
win was forced to stop the fight bc
-1 cause of Lunceford's cut lip and
i bloody nose. McClure was probably
! ahead on points at the close of the
: fight, always getting the best of the
j numerous exchanges.
Yank Levin, clearly superior to
his buddy and long-time friend,
Ted Hopkins, managed to punch
his way to an easy decision. Tak
ing advantage of Hopkins' poor
foot-work. Levin cleverly landed
at will.
Sam Streeter outboxed Bill
! Brown in the heavyweight event to
win a unanimous decision.
