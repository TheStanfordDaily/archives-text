Tonight's the night. Stanford's cage quintet Greyhounds over to Berke
ley to battle it out with the championship-bound Berkeley Blue and Gold.
The following night the boys do a repeat in the Stanford Pavilion.
If Stanford wins either game of the twin bill, it will be the upset ot all
upsets. It will be a bigger upset than the U.C.L.A. football victory over
St. Mary's last fall, or the U.S.C. defeat at the hands of the San Diego
N.T.S. In fact if we win they'll be talking about it in Slants come 25 years
from now.
Which leads us to the point that an applecart upset is very possible. 1
Those Cal characters are 110 bunch of super-humans being fed Atom
Crackers, which makes them invincible before all oncomers. They, too,
can bite the bitter dust of defeat. And before the play-oils are over, they
probably will bow to a northern division team.
Psychologically, the Golden Bear is ripe for defeat. Cocky after putting
U.S.C. in its place last weekend, the Strawberry Canyon lads probably
feel that playing Stanford will be a mere formality. They could be wrong. .
It wouldn't mark the first time that Cal has been upset, or that Stanford
has sprung the upset.
So don't write off the two-game series as a completely lost cause. This
writer has a sneaking suspicion that Stanford might fool everybody with j
their hoop play this weekend against California. The crystal ball is a I
little hazy on the scores of the two games, so any forthright predictions
from this scribbler won't mean a thing, but we do venture to say that the
games will be close, and that the Cards will raise more than one scare ;
in the faces of all those millions and millions of Cal students.

Before any Stanfordites start having rosy visions of going to the Rose
Bowl next season and then trotting out a victory war dance after the game
in the Cocoanut Grove to the tune of "Come Join the Band," here's a
curt little note.
That pleasant little item that appeared in Will Connally's column ear
lier in the week about a gang of El TOlO players planning on coming to
Stanford is without solid foundation.
It is true that several months ago, a group of El Toro football toters
had signified their intentions of enrolling at Stanford to play football and
study Western Civ. but they promptly dropped their collegiate plans
when a professional offer came their way. So most of them signed on the
dotted line for pro teams. I
So it looks like Marchie Schwartz is going to have to start from scratch ;
in building up a football team for next season. No grid luminaries roam j
the campus at the present, and if they want to play football, they 11 have
to start rollin' in pretty soon.

Now that I've squashed all gridiron expectations for next fall, here's a
little more favorable news to local Indians. Stanford's basketball plight
will not develop into a hangover for next season. A few pre-war stars
are planning on returning to*4he Farm, come the dofiing ol the uniform.
Howie Dallmar, who played sensational basketball at the University of
Penn while a naval cadet, is expected in "these here territories' around
the turn of the new year.
Also coming back—so the scuttlebutt goes —is Jim Pollard, second
best turned out at Stanford. (He is topped only by Hank Luisetti.)
All those shenanigans down at the two universities down south,
who have been panning hell out of Stanford, had better reserve a special
seat down in the ground with all the rodents. The day of reckoning is
coming.

The U.P. ticker tape informs us that the bangtail oval down at
' Calientc is putting up a $10,000 purse in a couple of Sundays. That, s
! good news. The purses down at the Tiajuana plant have been so low
lately that reconverted work horses have been running. That's cer
tainly a paradox from the years of old, when Agua Caliente claimed the
finest nags in the nation; purses were tops; when sterling silver was used
in the clubhouse; and where gambling figures run into the oh-so-many
figures. . '
