# 'Bell' Men Hold Match
## 
### 
An informal exhibition of the most
formal sport of them all will be given i
by Stanford gymnasts and members j
of the Olympic Club on next Wed
nesday, Feb. 20.
Mr. Illing, who will be leading the
featured Olympic men, is a former
holder of National Amateur Athletic
Union championships in rope climb
ing and rings. All the performers
have won many honors and are some
of the most experienced and best in
ihe West.
Special Events
The demonstrations, in which both
the Clubbers and our Indians will
lake part, will include these events:
horizontal bars, rings, sidehorse, par
allel bars, and longhorse.
Our boys, most of whom haven't
ever competed in competitive meets,
will meet the University of Califor
nia at Berkeley on March !). After
evaluating their performance they
will probably decide to enter the sec
tional meet of the A.A.U. around the
middle of April.
Hunt's Hopes
The fellows who arc now the chief
hopes of Coach Hunt are Lawrence
Ainsworth, Jerry Stewart, Ward
Chennell, and Don Scott. Other men
who have been showing fast im
provement are Bill Van Dorn, whose
brother scored the greatest number
of points of any Cardinal in Stan
ford's last meet with the U. of C., and
Robert Lee Paul.
Coach Hunt would welcome any
new members to his team who have
any previous experience. The squad
now has scores of aspirants who are
willing but too new at the sport to
start taking first places for quite
some time yet. So says our coach,
"Any of you fellows who have been
at the game for a few years and
aren't going out for football or base
ball come on out and give us a hand
in building up our gymnastics team.
