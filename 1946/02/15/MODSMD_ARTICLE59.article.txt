# Indian Wrestlers Grapple with Cal
## 
### LARRY MADURO 
Stanford wrestlers will invade the
Berkeley campus this Saturday,
marking the first time that Bear
and Indian grapplers have tangled
since 1929.
'Ibis will be Stanford's first
dual meet of the season, and from
present indications it should be
the forerunner of the return of
winning ways to Stanford.
Stanford holds a definite edge in i
three of the matches. Vein Jones has 1
developed into a very promising
wrestler, and should experience little I
difficulty in registering a victory in j
the 136-lb. division.
Dan Winston, champion of the 155-
1 b. division in the recently held Far
Western Open Championships, and
and generally considered to be one
of the best wrestling prospects to ap
pear on the Farm in recent years,
should breeze to an easy victory.
En the 105 - lb. class, Oscar
Thompson, the half-nelson virtuoso
of the squad, should emerge victo
rious in relatively easy fashion. He
is one of the more experienced
wrestlers on the team and has dis
played fine form in practice bouts.
In the 121-lb. class, David Hcnni
j gan will represent Stanford against

Bub Hopkins. Both of these boys
were eliminated in tlie first round of
the Far Western Open Champion
ships, but Hopkins appeared to be the
more experienced and of the
two, and he should gain the nod in
this match.
The remainder of the matches 011
the card appear to be toss-ups.
Willard Walkur. by virtue of bis
steady improvement, will be the
Indian representative in the 128-lb.
class. Jim Kerfers will compete in
the 145-lb. class. Lowell Nappcr,
who has proven in his recent bouts
that he is very rugged, will partici
pate in the 175 - lb. event.
Either Diek Nissen or John Moser
j will grunt and groan in the heavy
i weight event. These four bouts
should prove to be close and hard-
I fought contests.
Coach Mumby is satisfied with the
progress and condition of his wres
j tiers, and he bolieves that this match
j with California will help elevate
j wrestling to a prominent role in the
j Stanford athletic picture.

three of the matches. Vein Jones has 1
developed into a very promising
wrestler, and should experience little I
difficulty in registering a victory in j
the 136-lb. division.
Dan Winston, champion of the 155-
1 b. division in the recently held Far
Western Open Championships, and
and generally considered to be one
of the best wrestling prospects to ap
pear on the Farm in recent years,
should breeze to an easy victory.
En the 105 - lb. class, Oscar
Thompson, the half-nelson virtuoso
of the squad, should emerge victo
rious in relatively easy fashion. He
is one of the more experienced
wrestlers on the team and has dis
played fine form in practice bouts.
In the 121-lb. class, David Hcnni
j gan will represent Stanford against

Bub Hopkins. Both of these boys
were eliminated in tlie first round of
the Far Western Open Champion
ships, but Hopkins appeared to be the
more experienced and of the
two, and he should gain the nod in
this match.
The remainder of the matches 011
the card appear to be toss-ups.
Willard Walkur. by virtue of bis
steady improvement, will be the
Indian representative in the 128-lb.
class. Jim Kerfers will compete in
the 145-lb. class. Lowell Nappcr,
who has proven in his recent bouts
that he is very rugged, will partici
pate in the 175 - lb. event.
Either Diek Nissen or John Moser
j will grunt and groan in the heavy
i weight event. These four bouts
should prove to be close and hard-
I fought contests.
Coach Mumby is satisfied with the
progress and condition of his wres
j tiers, and he bolieves that this match
j with California will help elevate
j wrestling to a prominent role in the
j Stanford athletic picture.
