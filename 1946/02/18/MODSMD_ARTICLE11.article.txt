CHUNGKING, Feb. 17 (UP).â€”China's civil war has broken out anew
: in southern Manchuria and American-equipped Nationalist armies drove
20 miles in one day to seize (he important rail town of Liaochung, 50 miles
j southwest of Mukden, after brief Communist resistance, it was officially
| confirmed today.
Spearheads of Lt. Gen. Tu Li-ming's now Sixth and the veteran Thir-

tecnth armies, in what was termed
by official sources as an "expansion
of the sphere of occupation," cap
lured the town after taking Panshan
and Taian, 95 and 70 miles south
west of the Communist-held rail
junction of Mukden in Jchol prov
ince.
The reports were confirmed by
the official Central Daily News and
Nationalist headquarters in Chung
king, after the Communists charged
Central Government forces were
pushing forward into Manchuria.
Nationalists in Chungking inter
preted the capture of Liaoehung as
removing a constant Communist
threat to Gen. Tu's right flank and
said "his onward pushing can be
expected to continue until all the
important rail lines arc in his
hands."
The Communist New China Daily
reported today that the new Chi
nese First Army, American-trained
units of Burma fame, were concen
trating in Hongkong for transporta
tion by the U.S. Navy to Manchuria.
Lt. Gen. Albert C. Wcdemeyer,
American commander in the Chi
na theater, already has requested
U.S. naval transport for Nation
alist troops with the approval of
Gen. George C. Marshall.
