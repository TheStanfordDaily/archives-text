# Majority of Veterans at Farm Desire Fewer Lower Division Requirements
## Feel They Must Make Up Lost Time; Stress Need for Individual Attention 
### DOUG WOODWORTH 
(Editorial note: This is the first in a series of articles deal
ing with veterans' opinions of Stanford life and their sugges
tions for its betterment.)

Fifteen hundred veterans in Stanford's classrooms! What
do they think of the scholastic set-up on the Farm? Very few
of them were here before the war. The impressions they gather
now will determine their attitude throughout college.
Few of these men were attracted to Stanford merely by the

► prosp?ctive social advantages of be
ing a "Stanford man." Most of them
were drawn by Stanford's widely
advertised academic excellence.
Now that they're here, are they
happy with the educational oppor
j tunitics offered them?
More Special Training?
It's hard to try to answer such a
question about the whole veteran
| group. But broadly speaking they
i are divided into two groups, the
j satisfied and the dissatisfied.
The latter are apparently in the
majority right now. They had
expected to find specialized tech
nical training and personalized
attention by the faculty, both in
structors and advisers. They find
instead specialized training de
layed till the upper division or
graduate level, and individual at
tention reduced to a minimum,
i The Lost Years
The men are not just crabbing.
They have reasons that seem ade
quate to them. They spy it's all
i very well for the humanists and so
, eial scientists to sample a little of
i everything for two years, but the
prospective engineers, physicists,
I and chemists can't alTord to dabble
around. They need all the tech
nical training they can get, so "why
should they have to fool with liberal
| arts requirements?"
A former navy flyer, back from
four years in uniform, expressed a
widespread sentiment, "We've been
! away too long already." The vet
j erans who want fewer requirements
feel that they have to make up lost
! time, not waste more of it.
' The Other Side
This aspect of the scholastic
program was very heavily criti
cized by veterans. Some, liow
j ever, departed from this general
i trend of opinion. One feels that
he, and the other servicemen.
| actually were fighting for an im
j proved world, cynicism notwith
standing. He thinks t lint veterans
should take advantage of their
extensive educational opportuni
ties to become better world citi
zens.
The group that holds this view
i maintains that a general education
in Ihc liberal arts is the prime re-
I quircmcni for membership in a de
! mocracy, and therefore for entrance
| into any vocation at all. They be
lieve that Stanford is right in cm
| phasizing a balanced education
above an intensively specialized
one.
Relaxed Requirements
Almost all of them believe that
in cases of exceptional injustice the
; lower division requirements should
be relaxed.
The lack of individual attention is
; more generally understood, if not
enjoyed. The men had heard of the
close student-faculty relations, and
j of the opportunities for consulta
■ tion. for which Stanford is well
j known. Most of them, though dis
j appointed, recognize that the fac
ulty is strained to its limit by the
[ increased registration, and that nor
j mal conditions cannot yet return.
Guidance Needed
They probably miss this indi
vidual attention most in the field
i of guidance. Long absence from
school makes them unfamiliar
I with the procedure of selecting
curricula. Yet they commented
that the advisers assigned to them
wcr generally inexperienced and
unprepared to counsel them ade
quately.
In th" elementary introduction
courses they find themselves in
classes of one or two hundred.
Many of them feel lost when the
only contact they have with the in
structor is a distant glimpse of him
across the vast expanses of an au
ditorium. would like more
opportunity to meet in small class
sections.
Looking Ahead
The standout feature of this
"veteran opinion' is that it isn't
peculiar to veterans. Any una
nimity ol opinion they havi seems
due to their being a little older, a

little more mature, not to their
being veterans.
