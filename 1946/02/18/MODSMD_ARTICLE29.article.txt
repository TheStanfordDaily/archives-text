# To Get Out of the Fog

You can't expect anyone to vote on some
thing about which they know less than the
proverbial bag of peanuts. In fact, the whole
idea of voting on the new A.S.S.U. Constitu
tion this Wednesday becomes a farce, if no
body takes the time or stirs up enough inter
est to find out what lies behind the ballot
saving "Mark Your Choice."
T ;day the back page of the Daily is devot
ed to the proposed Constitution. We have
included passages from the old Constitution
in order that you may see what the main
differences are between the two.
The principal suggested change is to the
new form of area representation on Excom.
La ;t spring a committee appointed by Excom
worked out a plan whereby the campus
would be divided into areas and one person
would be elected by the residents to repre
sent their particular area; and by a referen
dum the campus voted to adopt the plan un
til it could be formally passed.
If you will read and compare the plan
with the old system of class representation,
you can see where the change will set up
an actual channel of thought between Excom
and the individual student. It goes something
like this:
Perhaps your Exccm representative has
been askod to get the opinion of his area

on a certain subject, say "the application of
the Honor Code to social regulations." He or
she can go to the next meeting of the inter
mediary organization of his area Union
Excom, Interhall Council, Roble Senators, or
whatever it may be, and put the question
before the presidents or representatives of
each living unit. The presidents can carry
it back to house meetings, where anyone
who has an opinion, be it gripe, huzzah, or
constructive suggestion, may express it free
ly. A reverse process provides the channel
for any expressed opinion to get back to
Excom, where it could be heard, instead of
floating in the vague aura of complaint-with
out initiative where it may die a natural death.
The kind of a situation in v/hich ideas are
eventually stifled from lack of action is the
kind that we found when we had class rep
resentation. In this type of resident Univer
sity, it is through the residence that we can
take part in our government, not through
comparatively weak class organization.
There you have it. Look over the Consti
tution cn which your student government
v/ill rest, and see if you agree with us that
it is a remodeling job which was long over
due, and which ought to give us ample op
portunity to be more active members of the
A.S.S.U.
