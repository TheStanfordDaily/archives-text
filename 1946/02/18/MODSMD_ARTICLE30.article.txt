NOT ANY OLD STAR
Sing your praises of the "Ivory Towers of Edu
cation." If this is a sample, I have had enough of
them. Tit. is not meant as a personal affront to
Stanford, howevt r, for it is conceivable that I
would fit less well into many universities.
Al any rate, after five years of non-school life—
in (hat Outside World which we supposedly are
preparing to improve I find the present academic
atmosphere superficial and unrealistic.
Past experience persuades us that the struc
tu" of life is built by daily, consistent, and de
cis"'' actions. The entire effect of a great man
< 112 history s ons from his own brief life-span. It,
in turn, is I ut an aggregate of minute progres
sions of the good, through the better, to the best.
Other this way to self-improvement, there
seemed to have been none. The same is still true
today. We can only change to something better
liy our volitional response to the good when ex
posed to it by reality around us.
In fact, we can only hold a man responsible to
that to which he has been exposed. To the degree
ho fails to respond, he is not moral; and to the de
gree he refuses to accept responsibility for his
response, he is not himself. He is not himself be
cause he permits things outside of him to take
precedence in his life. To individuals like him we
nui t say, "Man, if you cannot free yourself and
make what is now your outward life to be your real
life, can you intelligently expect to change your
neighbor and the world?" Response connotes re
sponsibility, and responsibility implies morality.
We .are only as free as we have the courage to be.
Also, reality demands a resuonse in kind. If
talking doesn't move those about me to talk, I
must try something else. Talking in a university
i' like breathing—everyone docs it. Whether you
breathe in a fast, slow, regular, or irregular way
doesn't really matter. Stop breathing, however,
and we become immediately disturbed. And so
it is with our talk.
This does not mean that I want somebody to
jump when I pull the strings. I want resistance to
thrt pull. I want to know there is something on the
other end of the strings. Twice before I have writ
ten what I thought in this column. The lack of re
sponse from those words caused me to wonder. I

wondered whether I had acted at all, for-action
which effects no change is not only action but only
motion. If, in order to find response, I must alter
my conduct, I shall do so. There is no other course.
No living person enjoys the society of a cemetery.
Either wo must revive the "dead" or, failing that,
admit our inability to do so, and call it quits. Yet,
as a memb 'r of the Stanford group which desires,
like myself, to understand the actions of those
about them, I shall try from now to the end of the
quarter, in this letter and succeeding letters, to
clarify such an appraisal.
As a veteran, I am wondering what to do with
the now ideas derived from my experience in Ihe
service.
One of those ideas is that our present-day
education is too unlifclikc and materialistic. The
STATUS QUO —an appeal to things as they are,
TRADITION—an appeal to things as they have
been, and PROFESSIONALISM—an appeal to
the existing rules of the game, determine too
much of our thinking. Because these attitudes
are negative in outlook (hey make us unrecep
tive to changes which might be for the better.
Furthermore, present-day university education
is materialistic because it refuses to acknowledge
the realitv of, and give guidance in, the non-mate
rial world of values. Material facts are not every
thing. And since we cannot possibly know all there
is to be known, we must have some basis by which
to discern the "dollar" facts from the "ten-cent"
details. We want understanding. Certainly if our
universities want to insist on disproving old be
liefs with their facts—a service which in its place
is progressive—they should also assume responsi
bilities! n rebuilding a structure of life compatible
with those facts.
We talk about the apparent neutrality of sci
ence, and then assume that scientists likewise are
neutral. That is wrong. They can only pretend
to be neutral. Surely the atomic bomb and hun
dreds of excited physicists proved that. But go
ahead, universities, pretend to deal impersonally
with your facts. However, at some time those
devastating words of Emerson will come to our
minds: "What you are speaks so loudly I cannot
hear what you say."

Sing your praises of the "Ivory Towers of Edu
cation." If this is a sample, I have had enough of
them. Tit. is not meant as a personal affront to
Stanford, howevt r, for it is conceivable that I
would fit less well into many universities.
Al any rate, after five years of non-school life—
in (hat Outside World which we supposedly are
preparing to improve I find the present academic
atmosphere superficial and unrealistic.
Past experience persuades us that the struc
tu" of life is built by daily, consistent, and de
cis"'' actions. The entire effect of a great man
< 112 history s ons from his own brief life-span. It,
in turn, is I ut an aggregate of minute progres
sions of the good, through the better, to the best.
Other this way to self-improvement, there
seemed to have been none. The same is still true
today. We can only change to something better
liy our volitional response to the good when ex
posed to it by reality around us.
In fact, we can only hold a man responsible to
that to which he has been exposed. To the degree
ho fails to respond, he is not moral; and to the de
gree he refuses to accept responsibility for his
response, he is not himself. He is not himself be
cause he permits things outside of him to take
precedence in his life. To individuals like him we
nui t say, "Man, if you cannot free yourself and
make what is now your outward life to be your real
life, can you intelligently expect to change your
neighbor and the world?" Response connotes re
sponsibility, and responsibility implies morality.
We .are only as free as we have the courage to be.
Also, reality demands a resuonse in kind. If
talking doesn't move those about me to talk, I
must try something else. Talking in a university
i' like breathing—everyone docs it. Whether you
breathe in a fast, slow, regular, or irregular way
doesn't really matter. Stop breathing, however,
and we become immediately disturbed. And so
it is with our talk.
This does not mean that I want somebody to
jump when I pull the strings. I want resistance to
thrt pull. I want to know there is something on the
other end of the strings. Twice before I have writ
ten what I thought in this column. The lack of re
sponse from those words caused me to wonder. I

wondered whether I had acted at all, for-action
which effects no change is not only action but only
motion. If, in order to find response, I must alter
my conduct, I shall do so. There is no other course.
No living person enjoys the society of a cemetery.
Either wo must revive the "dead" or, failing that,
admit our inability to do so, and call it quits. Yet,
as a memb 'r of the Stanford group which desires,
like myself, to understand the actions of those
about them, I shall try from now to the end of the
quarter, in this letter and succeeding letters, to
clarify such an appraisal.
As a veteran, I am wondering what to do with
the now ideas derived from my experience in Ihe
service.
One of those ideas is that our present-day
education is too unlifclikc and materialistic. The
STATUS QUO —an appeal to things as they are,
TRADITION—an appeal to things as they have
been, and PROFESSIONALISM—an appeal to
the existing rules of the game, determine too
much of our thinking. Because these attitudes
are negative in outlook (hey make us unrecep
tive to changes which might be for the better.
Furthermore, present-day university education
is materialistic because it refuses to acknowledge
the realitv of, and give guidance in, the non-mate
rial world of values. Material facts are not every
thing. And since we cannot possibly know all there
is to be known, we must have some basis by which
to discern the "dollar" facts from the "ten-cent"
details. We want understanding. Certainly if our
universities want to insist on disproving old be
liefs with their facts—a service which in its place
is progressive—they should also assume responsi
bilities! n rebuilding a structure of life compatible
with those facts.
We talk about the apparent neutrality of sci
ence, and then assume that scientists likewise are
neutral. That is wrong. They can only pretend
to be neutral. Surely the atomic bomb and hun
dreds of excited physicists proved that. But go
ahead, universities, pretend to deal impersonally
with your facts. However, at some time those
devastating words of Emerson will come to our
minds: "What you are speaks so loudly I cannot
hear what you say."

NOT ANY OLD STAR
Sing your praises of the "Ivory Towers of Edu
cation." If this is a sample, I have had enough of
them. Tit. is not meant as a personal affront to
Stanford, howevt r, for it is conceivable that I
would fit less well into many universities.
Al any rate, after five years of non-school life—
in (hat Outside World which we supposedly are
preparing to improve I find the present academic
atmosphere superficial and unrealistic.
Past experience persuades us that the struc
tu" of life is built by daily, consistent, and de
cis"'' actions. The entire effect of a great man
< 112 history s ons from his own brief life-span. It,
in turn, is I ut an aggregate of minute progres
sions of the good, through the better, to the best.
Other this way to self-improvement, there
seemed to have been none. The same is still true
today. We can only change to something better
liy our volitional response to the good when ex
posed to it by reality around us.
In fact, we can only hold a man responsible to
that to which he has been exposed. To the degree
ho fails to respond, he is not moral; and to the de
gree he refuses to accept responsibility for his
response, he is not himself. He is not himself be
cause he permits things outside of him to take
precedence in his life. To individuals like him we
nui t say, "Man, if you cannot free yourself and
make what is now your outward life to be your real
life, can you intelligently expect to change your
neighbor and the world?" Response connotes re
sponsibility, and responsibility implies morality.
We .are only as free as we have the courage to be.
Also, reality demands a resuonse in kind. If
talking doesn't move those about me to talk, I
must try something else. Talking in a university
i' like breathing—everyone docs it. Whether you
breathe in a fast, slow, regular, or irregular way
doesn't really matter. Stop breathing, however,
and we become immediately disturbed. And so
it is with our talk.
This does not mean that I want somebody to
jump when I pull the strings. I want resistance to
thrt pull. I want to know there is something on the
other end of the strings. Twice before I have writ
ten what I thought in this column. The lack of re
sponse from those words caused me to wonder. I

wondered whether I had acted at all, for-action
which effects no change is not only action but only
motion. If, in order to find response, I must alter
my conduct, I shall do so. There is no other course.
No living person enjoys the society of a cemetery.
Either wo must revive the "dead" or, failing that,
admit our inability to do so, and call it quits. Yet,
as a memb 'r of the Stanford group which desires,
like myself, to understand the actions of those
about them, I shall try from now to the end of the
quarter, in this letter and succeeding letters, to
clarify such an appraisal.
As a veteran, I am wondering what to do with
the now ideas derived from my experience in Ihe
service.
One of those ideas is that our present-day
education is too unlifclikc and materialistic. The
STATUS QUO —an appeal to things as they are,
TRADITION—an appeal to things as they have
been, and PROFESSIONALISM—an appeal to
the existing rules of the game, determine too
much of our thinking. Because these attitudes
are negative in outlook (hey make us unrecep
tive to changes which might be for the better.
Furthermore, present-day university education
is materialistic because it refuses to acknowledge
the realitv of, and give guidance in, the non-mate
rial world of values. Material facts are not every
thing. And since we cannot possibly know all there
is to be known, we must have some basis by which
to discern the "dollar" facts from the "ten-cent"
details. We want understanding. Certainly if our
universities want to insist on disproving old be
liefs with their facts—a service which in its place
is progressive—they should also assume responsi
bilities! n rebuilding a structure of life compatible
with those facts.
We talk about the apparent neutrality of sci
ence, and then assume that scientists likewise are
neutral. That is wrong. They can only pretend
to be neutral. Surely the atomic bomb and hun
dreds of excited physicists proved that. But go
ahead, universities, pretend to deal impersonally
with your facts. However, at some time those
devastating words of Emerson will come to our
minds: "What you are speaks so loudly I cannot
hear what you say."
