Winner of the cashmere waffle iron for the
DeVotie Award of the week during this past seven
day peiiod is "Jesse James" Farrell, astigmatic ref
eree in the weekend's basketball series with the
East Bay Dead End Kids.
Farrell won the award by his diligent wrong
guessing both Friday and Saturday evenings. Out
ol 57 possible decisions, he called 49 wrong, chalk
ing up a new high in Bay Area whistle tooting.
The judges, who were situated throughout the
week, turned in the following votes:
Farrell, lfiß; Lou McGarrity, 51; the hashers of
the Chalet, 47; Freddie McGuire, 45; "Buzzy New
ion. 15; Inez Burns, 7; Ray Milland, 2.,
McGarrity, America's unsung indoor trombone
champion, with and without Benny Goodman for
the past six years, presented the finest example of
the "dirty sliphorn" treatment heard in Santa
Clara County since Miff Mole's concert tour in '27,
at the Sanhos Civic Friday night.
The hashers went all out Thursday eve to
make the boys of Encina 3 feel at home when they
went up to the Chalet for an exchange dinner
oi almost dinner, Practical jokes were had by all.
The Encina men were so grateful for the con
sideration shown them that they dispatched the
following telegraphic "Ode to Chalet" the following
morning:
Your cuisine Ires delicious, your bashers all 100
vicious
Were Cupids trained on Stanford's famed "T";

Your conversation's witty, sprinkled with the
latest ditties—
The Mercer calls it "personality"—
With chaste "Montana eights" you entertained
vour dates.
(Yes. lights were on . , . oh. Sahib Kennedy.)
't hanks again, 'twas really great; we enjoyed our
tete-a-tete.
We remain sincerely yours, Encina three.
McGuire, in his undying devotion to the Farm,
makes a bi-wcokly pilgrimage here from Los An
geles in a hydromatic land yacht. He has also
gained the distinction of being "the most vestigial
member of the human race." Anyone able to give
three concrete reasons for his existence will get
our latest sanforized monkey-wrench.
A late flash that just came in:
RENO, FEB. 17. IF ALL THE SKIS (NOR
WEGIAN PRONUNCIATION) AT THE NE
VADA WINTER CARNIVAL WERE LAID END
TO END WE WOULDN'T BE A BIT SUR
PRISED.
"Fuzzy" Newton, balding scrum half on the
Olympic Club rugby fifteen, spent Saturday after
noon tolling our Farm ruggers how to play the
game. The uncalled-for tutoring won undying
gratitude plus numerous well-turned epithets from
the ITindians.
Presentations of all awards will be made at the
DeVotie kick-off luncheon tomorrow at the Los
Gatos Athletic and Chicken a la King Club.
