II Countries
Citizens of 11 nations, among them
India, China. Scotland, Switzerland,
Colombia, Poland, U.S., Panama,
Chile, Turkey, and England, sat
around many tables in the dining
Â»oom and living room of the comfor
table Thomas home.
Taskebabi was the meat dish and
consisted of leg of lamb, green pep
per, egg plant, onions, and in one of
the chef's own words, "the all-im
portant touch ol salt." Together with
the meat was served palav. It is rice

Vltisic Heard
Following the meal, amidst smoke
and hushed accents, music was heard.
Instead of an eight-tone scale there
is a 24-note scale. The largest-sized
orchestra in Turkey ranges from 27
to 29 musical instruments and the
smallest lrom about 15 to 17. The
music exemplifies pain and love, for
the musicians feel that this is the

] only thing important in this world.
Captain Ismail Guralp gave a talk
! on his country. He said the Moslem
: religion has always been an impor
j tant factor in the building up of the
; Turkish civilization, which did not
really begin to get cultured until the
army was defeated at the siege of
Vienna, and it continued on a fairly
peaceful level until 1919. On Au
gust 30, 1923, Turkey established
herself as a republic.
I Talk About Turkey
With the present administration
democracy is important in Turkey.
The people elect (heir president in
directly through electors. Education
is free, including grammar school,
high school, and university. Liter
acy is very high. Now, Captain Gu
ralp continued, everyone in Turkey
can at least read a newspaper.
The social life is more restricted
than in America. The women par
ticularly are not allowed as great a
freedom. They may go out alone
with members of the opposite sex
only if they are engaged, and then
only with their parents' consent.
Morals in Turkey
Alcoholic drinks are looked upon
with much disfavor, and marriage is
for keeps. Captain Guralp smiled,
saying that a man has to make a very
serious decision when he thinks of
marriage. Art and music are very
I much appreciated by the Turks. The
j classical music of Europe is well re
|reived.
I Evety Turk is a Moslem; however,
I not everyone is an orthodox one.
i Many people see a need for modifi
j cation of their religion. Up until now
there has been no government inter
ference concerning it.
Swisher Talk
Following the talk, John Menzel,

president of the International Club,
introduced one of the guests of hon
or, Major Swisher of the United
States Marine Corps.
Major Swisher expressed his grate
fulness to be back in the United
States, and hopes soon to return to !
his previous position as college pro- |
fessor.
Swisher's Interest
He said that he had been inter- \
ested in international clubs all his j
life. He was president of the first !
club of that kind in Washington, D.C.
Major Swisher said that it was very
gratifying to se*> that military men
iike the Turkish cooks were able to
come over to this country and see the
American way ol life.
Major Swisher commented that the ;
problems of the international future
are very grave, and it is groups like !
the International Club, where good- j
will and affability exist, lh;it will aid
in helping a greater understanding !
among the various peoples of the
world.
