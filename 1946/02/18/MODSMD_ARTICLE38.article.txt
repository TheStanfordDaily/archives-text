Another season of basketball has
into the books for posterity.
For Stanford the season wasn't as
unprofitable as the annals might
show. Starting out with an inexpe
rienced squad, Everett Dean molded
a team that, by the end of the sea
son, was able to play Cal, the con
ference champs, on an even basis
most of the game.
Experience was* what the squad
lacked most, and now that the
team has a little of that all-im
portant item tucked under its
belt, next season won't see Stan
ford in such a. bad light. And
with a few pre - war luminaries
returning Quad way, the Indian
representatives of the hardwood
will put our school back in the
basketball limelight that it once
possessed. The day is coming!
It is tradition that all journaliis
tic publications put forth their se
lection of all-coast, or some sort of
"all" team, at the end of each sports
season. So here's tlie Daily's se
lection for All - Southern Duvision
basketball team.
Forward — Merv LaFaille. A
three-year veteran at Cal, and the
captain his last season, his heads-up
playing puts him on the first five.
To the Daily sports stall, he over
shadows his teammate, Andy Wolfe,
although the Andrew lad has high
scoring honors for the season.
Forward—Chuck Clustka. Only
a fresh at U.C.L.A., Clustka has
played consistently good basket
ball on an otherwise mediocre
team. The remark that he is only "
a freshman makes no difference
in bis department. We think his
aggressive play outrates Wolfe
at Cal and Bobby Kloppenluirg,
U.S.C. ace.
Center — Jack Nichols. An all
coast man last season. Nichols has
not played the brand of basketball
he has in the past, but still th»re is
no one to challenge his football on
the top pedestal. Jim Smith at Cal
has played fair ball at times. So has
our own Tom Murphy, but neither
approaches Nichols.
Guard Bob Hogeboom. No scor
ing wizard, Bob has played a good
defensive game for California the
whole season. He is rated one of
the best men on defense in the
league.
Guard—Tom Shanley. Playing
for C.S.C.. Shanley — at times —
has run up high scores. Also his
defensive game and team play
have been sharp throughout the
season.
As anybody can see, the confer
ence is top-heavy with good for
wards, but lacks guards of any im
portance. As basketball players,
Kloppenburg, Wolfe, Webster, and
Martin all outrank the first two
guards picked, but it happens that
this quartet is composed oP for
wards, and it is hard to say how
they would fare at another position.
On the second team. Jim Smith
of Cal gets the center post. For
ward spots go to Kloppenburg

and Wolfe. Guard positions are
awarded to ISifl Christiansen and
Gene Martin, who played some
games at the beginning of the
season at that post.
All complaints and criticisms
should be directed to the Sports
Stall, care of the Daily. We'd be
glad to see what other people think
about this basketball situation.

No—it's not true that the Daily
is going to send a correspondent to
cover the San Francisco Seals train
ing camp over Honolulu way. The
sports staff must study, too.

most of the game.
Experience was* what the squad
lacked most, and now that the
team has a little of that all-im
portant item tucked under its
belt, next season won't see Stan
ford in such a. bad light. And
with a few pre - war luminaries
returning Quad way, the Indian
representatives of the hardwood
will put our school back in the
basketball limelight that it once
possessed. The day is coming!
It is tradition that all journaliis
tic publications put forth their se
lection of all-coast, or some sort of
"all" team, at the end of each sports
season. So here's tlie Daily's se
lection for All - Southern Duvision
basketball team.
Forward — Merv LaFaille. A
three-year veteran at Cal, and the
captain his last season, his heads-up
playing puts him on the first five.
To the Daily sports stall, he over
shadows his teammate, Andy Wolfe,
although the Andrew lad has high
scoring honors for the season.
Forward—Chuck Clustka. Only
a fresh at U.C.L.A., Clustka has
played consistently good basket
ball on an otherwise mediocre
team. The remark that he is only "
a freshman makes no difference
in bis department. We think his
aggressive play outrates Wolfe
at Cal and Bobby Kloppenluirg,
U.S.C. ace.
Center — Jack Nichols. An all
coast man last season. Nichols has
not played the brand of basketball
he has in the past, but still th»re is
no one to challenge his football on
the top pedestal. Jim Smith at Cal
has played fair ball at times. So has
our own Tom Murphy, but neither
approaches Nichols.
Guard Bob Hogeboom. No scor
ing wizard, Bob has played a good
defensive game for California the
whole season. He is rated one of
the best men on defense in the
league.
Guard—Tom Shanley. Playing
for C.S.C.. Shanley — at times —
has run up high scores. Also his
defensive game and team play
have been sharp throughout the
season.
As anybody can see, the confer
ence is top-heavy with good for
wards, but lacks guards of any im
portance. As basketball players,
Kloppenburg, Wolfe, Webster, and
Martin all outrank the first two
guards picked, but it happens that
this quartet is composed oP for
wards, and it is hard to say how
they would fare at another position.
On the second team. Jim Smith
of Cal gets the center post. For
ward spots go to Kloppenburg

and Wolfe. Guard positions are
awarded to ISifl Christiansen and
Gene Martin, who played some
games at the beginning of the
season at that post.
All complaints and criticisms
should be directed to the Sports
Stall, care of the Daily. We'd be
glad to see what other people think
about this basketball situation.

No—it's not true that the Daily
is going to send a correspondent to
cover the San Francisco Seals train
ing camp over Honolulu way. The
sports staff must study, too.

Another season of basketball has
into the books for posterity.
For Stanford the season wasn't as
unprofitable as the annals might
show. Starting out with an inexpe
rienced squad, Everett Dean molded
a team that, by the end of the sea
son, was able to play Cal, the con
ference champs, on an even basis
most of the game.
