# JV's Smash Blues Twice
## 
### 
Bothered by the constant changes
in the roster, the inexperience of
his men, and, of course, injuries,
Fordy Anderson finally whipped
his junior varsity squad into a well
organized squad and they reacted
with two weekend wins over the
Cal Blues. The scores were 39 to 35
and 39 to 34.
After stalling the season rather
slowly, the Farm J.V.'s have
charged hack in a finish compar
able to anything of Skipper Gar
rison's to make the season a defi
nite success.
The Farm five had to fight back
from a one-point half-time deficit
to convincingly win the Friday
clash. The four-point margin by no
means shows the superiority of the
team on that night. Brewster Arms,
who was high point man for the
game with 17 points, and Bob Hago
pian, who dropped 14, sparked the
Indian offensive, but it was out
standing teamwork which carried
the team to the victory . Only six
men entered the game, and Arms.
Culin. Hagopian, and Taylor played
40-minute ball.
Saturday night it was again the
high - percentage shooting of
Arms and Ilagopian which piled
up (he score and it was again the
blanket-like defensive work of
the team which held the ordina
rily high-powered Cal offensive
to a minimum.
Arms scored 14 points to take
honors again; Hggopian, 10. Also
shining for the locals was Ed Culin,
whose consistent play in the key
and off the backboards gave the In
dians many an extra shot.
These two wins definitely place
the junior varsity in the black so
far as the season statistics go. It
has now won ten games and lost

six. a record which is entirely due j
to the coaching job of Fordy Ander- j
son. Its worth is hardly estimable.
