A. In General.
1. Students arc expected to show
both within and without the Uni

rality. personal honor, and the rights
of others as is demanded of good
citizens. Failure to do this will be
sufficient cause for removal from
the University.

maintained within the University.
To this end we commend and will
uphold the University authorities in
prohibition of excessive expendi
tures and other excesses on the part
of students, and the formation or
growth of any organization, custom
or social function, that tends to the
development of exclusive or undem
ocratic castes within the University,
and to exclude from the institution
anyone whose conduct is inconsist
ent with the spirit expressed by the
founders.
3. Business integrity shall be re
quired in the fulfillment of agree
ments and in the prompt payment
of bills by individuals, by classes and
by all student organizations.

the rules of the Library by taking
without permission from the Library
or by injuring, any book, pamphlet
or other document belonging to its
collection.

such regulations under power grant
ed in Article 111 as may from time to
time be necessary to enforce fully
the letter and spirit of Scction A,
including such basic men's and
women's social regulations as may
be required.
B. Honor Code.
1. The Honor Code is an undertak
ing of the students, individually and
collectively, that they will conform
to the letter and the spirit of the
Fundamental Standard, particularly
in the following respects:
a) That they will not give nor re
ceive aid in examinations; that they
will not give nor receive unpermit
ted aid in class work, in the prep
aration of reports, or in any other
work that is to be' used by the in
structor as the basis of grading.
b) That they will do their share
and take an active part, in seeing to
it that others as well as themselves

Honor Code.

ARTICLE X
STUDENT CONTROL
Scction 1. The Fundamental Stand
ard.
A. In General.
1. Students arc expected to show
both within and without the Uni
versity such respect for order, mo
rality. personal honor, and the rights
of others as is demanded of good
citizens. Failure to do this will be
sufficient cause for removal from
the University.
2. A spirit of equality must lie
maintained within the University.
To this end we commend and will
uphold the University authorities in
prohibition of excessive expendi
tures and other excesses on the part
of students, and the formation or
growth of any organization, custom
or social function, that tends to the
development of exclusive or undem
ocratic castes within the University,
and to exclude from the institution
anyone whose conduct is inconsist
ent with the spirit expressed by the
founders.
3. Business integrity shall be re
quired in the fulfillment of agree
ments and in the prompt payment
of bills by individuals, by classes and
by all student organizations.
4. The students will not violate
the rules of the Library by taking
without permission from the Library
or by injuring, any book, pamphlet
or other document belonging to its
collection.
5. Executive Committee shall make
such regulations under power grant
ed in Article 111 as may from time to
time be necessary to enforce fully
the letter and spirit of Scction A,
including such basic men's and
women's social regulations as may
be required.
B. Honor Code.
1. The Honor Code is an undertak
ing of the students, individually and
collectively, that they will conform
to the letter and the spirit of the
Fundamental Standard, particularly
in the following respects:
a) That they will not give nor re
ceive aid in examinations; that they
will not give nor receive unpermit
ted aid in class work, in the prep
aration of reports, or in any other
work that is to be' used by the in
structor as the basis of grading.
b) That they will do their share
and take an active part, in seeing to
it that others as well as themselves
obey the spirit and the letter of the
Honor Code.

A. In General.
1. Students arc expected to show
both within and without the Uni

rality. personal honor, and the rights
of others as is demanded of good
citizens. Failure to do this will be
sufficient cause for removal from
the University.

maintained within the University.
To this end we commend and will
uphold the University authorities in
prohibition of excessive expendi
tures and other excesses on the part
of students, and the formation or
growth of any organization, custom
or social function, that tends to the
development of exclusive or undem
ocratic castes within the University,
and to exclude from the institution
anyone whose conduct is inconsist
ent with the spirit expressed by the
founders.
3. Business integrity shall be re
quired in the fulfillment of agree
ments and in the prompt payment
of bills by individuals, by classes and
by all student organizations.

the rules of the Library by taking
without permission from the Library
or by injuring, any book, pamphlet
or other document belonging to its
collection.
5. Executive Committee shall make
such regulations under power grant
ed in Article 111 as may from time to
time be necessary to enforce fully
the letter and spirit of Scction A,
including such basic men's and
women's social regulations as may
be required.
B. Honor Code.
1. The Honor Code is an undertak
ing of the students, individually and
collectively, that they will conform
to the letter and the spirit of the
Fundamental Standard, particularly
in the following respects:
a) That they will not give nor re
ceive aid in examinations; that they
will not give nor receive unpermit
ted aid in class work, in the prep
aration of reports, or in any other
work that is to be' used by the in
structor as the basis of grading.
b) That they will do their share
and take an active part, in seeing to
it that others as well as themselves
obey the spirit and the letter of the
Honor Code.

ard.
A. In General.
1. Students arc expected to show
both within and without the Uni
versity such respect for order, mo
rality. personal honor, and the rights
of others as is demanded of good
citizens. Failure to do this will be
sufficient cause for removal from
the University.
2. A spirit of equality must lie
maintained within the University.
To this end we commend and will
uphold the University authorities in
prohibition of excessive expendi
tures and other excesses on the part
of students, and the formation or
growth of any organization, custom
or social function, that tends to the
development of exclusive or undem
ocratic castes within the University,
and to exclude from the institution
anyone whose conduct is inconsist
ent with the spirit expressed by the
founders.
3. Business integrity shall be re
quired in the fulfillment of agree
ments and in the prompt payment
of bills by individuals, by classes and
by all student organizations.

the rules of the Library by taking
without permission from the Library
or by injuring, any book, pamphlet
or other document belonging to its
collection.
5. Executive Committee shall make
such regulations under power grant
ed in Article 111 as may from time to
time be necessary to enforce fully
the letter and spirit of Scction A,
including such basic men's and
women's social regulations as may
be required.
B. Honor Code.
1. The Honor Code is an undertak
ing of the students, individually and
collectively, that they will conform
to the letter and the spirit of the
Fundamental Standard, particularly
in the following respects:
a) That they will not give nor re
ceive aid in examinations; that they
will not give nor receive unpermit
ted aid in class work, in the prep
aration of reports, or in any other
work that is to be' used by the in
structor as the basis of grading.
b) That they will do their share
and take an active part, in seeing to
it that others as well as themselves
obey the spirit and the letter of the
Honor Code.

A. In General.
1. Students arc expected to show
both within and without the Uni
versity such respect for order, mo
rality. personal honor, and the rights
of others as is demanded of good
citizens. Failure to do this will be
sufficient cause for removal from
the University.

maintained within the University.
To this end we commend and will
uphold the University authorities in
prohibition of excessive expendi
tures and other excesses on the part
of students, and the formation or
growth of any organization, custom
or social function, that tends to the
development of exclusive or undem
ocratic castes within the University,
and to exclude from the institution
anyone whose conduct is inconsist
ent with the spirit expressed by the
founders.
3. Business integrity shall be re
quired in the fulfillment of agree
ments and in the prompt payment
of bills by individuals, by classes and
by all student organizations.

the rules of the Library by taking
without permission from the Library
or by injuring, any book, pamphlet
or other document belonging to its
collection.
5. Executive Committee shall make
such regulations under power grant
ed in Article 111 as may from time to
time be necessary to enforce fully
the letter and spirit of Scction A,
including such basic men's and
women's social regulations as may
be required.
B. Honor Code.
1. The Honor Code is an undertak
ing of the students, individually and
collectively, that they will conform
to the letter and the spirit of the
Fundamental Standard, particularly
in the following respects:
a) That they will not give nor re
ceive aid in examinations; that they
will not give nor receive unpermit
ted aid in class work, in the prep
aration of reports, or in any other
work that is to be' used by the in
structor as the basis of grading.
b) That they will do their share
and take an active part, in seeing to
