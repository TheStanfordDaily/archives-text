Jap General Masaharu Homma took stand at his war crimes trial in Manila in effort to beat death penalty,
then heard his wife describe him as a "peace-loving: man of whom I am proud." Convicted of
charges that he ordered "Bataan Death March," he appealed sentence before firing squad to U. S. Su

Tomovuki Yamar;hita.
