Bill Lippincott, appointed acting
head yell leader by Cardinals, is
'he only nominee for the oflice of
head yell leader. Carl Data and
Ken Lettich are running for the two
assistant yell leader positions.
Student vote in the election will
also determine whether the new
constitution adopted last spring
on a trial basis will be ratified in
its entirety, whether the old con
stitution will again be valid, or
whether the new constitution will
be ratified without the area rep
resentation clause.

According to the area representa
tion plan, representatives on Exeom
are elected on the basis of living
group areas. The representatives
are responsible to house presidents
through intermediary organizations
such as Row, Union, and Lagunita
Excom and the house presidents are
directly responsible to the students
in their living groups. By this sys
tem each living group has an op
portunity to actively take part in
the legislative decisions made by
Excom.
According to the class repre
sentation plan, two representa
tives on Excom are elected by
each of the upper three classesâ€”
sophomore, junior, and senior. It
was found that often too main of

the representatives came from
one or two sections of campus,
thus decreasing student action on
and knowledge of pertinent cam
pus problems.
Another chance in the new con
stitution j'ives (he power of admin
istrative boards to the formerly
subsidiary organizations of Wom
en's Conference, Publications Coun
cil, Activities Council, Dramatic
Council, Debate Council, and Wom
en's Athletic Association. They aro
now able to make rules for them
selves without having to rely on
Excom. Excom still has the power,
however, to veto any rules made
by an administrative board with th<;
consent of two-thirds of Excom
members.
