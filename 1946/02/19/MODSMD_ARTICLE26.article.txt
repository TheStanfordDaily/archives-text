# Answer to Nothing
## THE 						CASE BILL 
### 
The House's answer to the demand of the
American public for some action to halt the
current wave of strikes—the Case Bill—is
now awaiting Senate consideration, and la
bor is loud in its denunciation of what it
terms "an assault on union rights and work
ers' liberties," "a bill designed to break
strikes, destroy the unions," etc. . . .
Despite the battle of the bill's opponents
to ease the harshness of the original provi
sions, the major points, all hostile from la
boi':i viewpoint, include:
1. Creation of a Federal mediation board
empowered to intervene in major labor dis
putes and enforce a 30-day cooling-off period
while it acts.
2. Use of injunctions to enforce the cool
ing-off period arid prevent violence or inter
ference wilh movement of perishable goods.
3. Authori2ation of civil suits against eith
er side in cases involving contract violation.
4. Curbing of jurisdictional disputes by
outlawing boycotts.
5. Banning of violent picketing, with vio
lators made liable to court injunctions and
loss of bargaining rights under the National

Labor Relations Act.
Today, however, with tension alleviated
on at least some major strike fronts, the Case
Bill's chance for Senate approval are even
slimmer than they were known to be be
fore. Again, there may be some phases of
the bill, such as the virtual prohibition to
foremen of the right to organize, that would
very probably be judged unconstitutional.
The House action, then, on this drastic piece
of labor legislation may be considered not
so much as the writing of a new labor law,
but as the belief that one should he written.
A bill so hostile to labor's view, even though
watered down, cannot constructively curb
strikes nor legislate labor into greater respon
sibility, the goals for the future which labor
itself, by its demonstration of "strength" and
ability to snarl up the entire national econ
omy, has proved to the public to be essential.
The Case Bill as passed by the House
seems to show that the "representatives" are
cupping their ears to hear the "voice of the
public," remembering always that 1946 is an
election year. Meanwhile, intelligent labor
legislation still demands to be written. — H.D.
