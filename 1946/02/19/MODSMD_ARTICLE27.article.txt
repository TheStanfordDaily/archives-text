(Ed'torial note: The following letter is con
fintu'd from yesterday's column.)
Well-meaning people like the Stanfords plan
universities, such as this one, because they have
scales of values- in their lives. Thoy put a building
like the Memorial Church in the center of the
Quad. Status Quo and Tradition would "say" that
it is still ri"ht there—in the center of Stanford
University. But, my idea of realism is not satisfied
with that. To occupy the central position in this
University, the values symbolized in Memorial
Church must be a dynamic permeating influence in
the lives of its students and faculty. And yet, I
don't mean to plug for the Memorial Church.
I mean to decry indifference to values, and to
denounce the transported parasitic existence which
charact i i:.os the lives of spiritually contented peo
ple who are indifferent to me and others around
them.
If we here at Stanford could banish that atti
tude of indifference from our campus, a number
of chancres would result. More interest would be
demonstrated in student government, the Honor
Code would lie more secure, the Cellar check
situation would be alleviated, control of the
atomic bomb would appear possible, and our
thinking about a future world government would
get somewhere.
If we are seeking only a trade school training
the situation is different. However, some of us still
tyant to know how we can become more efficient
m.«J more effective as free moral agents; and be
lieve that some guidance in these "things" is the
responsibility of those who teach.
But already I hear it "explained" that all this

cannot bo helped. That we arc in a vicious circle
of social organization. I am sorry to hear this, and,
to an extent, I can appreciate it. Because 1 love
freedom I am sorry to hear about any forms of
restraint upon the free spirit of my fellowmen.
However, before I get too far into a situation such
as that, 1 will stop, admit my mistake gracefully,
and seek to correct it. If I must choose between the
present business of our society and the understand
ing of a simpler one, 1 shall choose understanding.
In our pronouncements about life, liberty, and
(lie pursuit of happiness we courageously affirm
(hal government exists for man and not man for
government. Surely, our position in relation to
society is the same. Either I am a slave to an
other man or '"thing," or I am free to give my life
to whatever cause I choose. For all of us the slo
gan. "Hitch your wagon to a star," has a certain
appeal. However, with a scale of values at
work in our lives we will add: "Not any old star."
In other words, my thoughts turn to leaving
Stanford because I demand from life a sufficient
response—to these ideas and from those about me—
to guarantee that it is real. I don't find it here.
Regardless of whether it is favorable or not, every
one desires response from about him. And
genuine people prefer genuine response. 1 don't
mind anyone telling me I am crazy if he does so
sincerely.
Nevertheless, v/ith a "few" more facts, and soon,
professionalized education will "know it all." Sure
ly, students can't talk. Why! Until we get a degree
or two, we wonder if we can even think.
But, be that as it may, we students still get ideas.

responsibility of those who teach.
But already I hear it "explained" that all this

cannot bo helped. That we arc in a vicious circle
of social organization. I am sorry to hear this, and,
to an extent, I can appreciate it. Because 1 love
freedom I am sorry to hear about any forms of
restraint upon the free spirit of my fellowmen.
However, before I get too far into a situation such
as that, 1 will stop, admit my mistake gracefully,
and seek to correct it. If I must choose between the
present business of our society and the understand
ing of a simpler one, 1 shall choose understanding.
In our pronouncements about life, liberty, and
(lie pursuit of happiness we courageously affirm
(hal government exists for man and not man for
government. Surely, our position in relation to
society is the same. Either I am a slave to an
other man or '"thing," or I am free to give my life
to whatever cause I choose. For all of us the slo
gan. "Hitch your wagon to a star," has a certain
appeal. However, with a scale of values at
work in our lives we will add: "Not any old star."
In other words, my thoughts turn to leaving
Stanford because I demand from life a sufficient
response—to these ideas and from those about me—
to guarantee that it is real. I don't find it here.
Regardless of whether it is favorable or not, every
one desires response from about him. And
genuine people prefer genuine response. 1 don't
mind anyone telling me I am crazy if he does so
sincerely.
Nevertheless, v/ith a "few" more facts, and soon,
professionalized education will "know it all." Sure
ly, students can't talk. Why! Until we get a degree
or two, we wonder if we can even think.
But, be that as it may, we students still get ideas.

(Ed'torial note: The following letter is con
fintu'd from yesterday's column.)
Well-meaning people like the Stanfords plan
universities, such as this one, because they have
scales of values- in their lives. Thoy put a building
like the Memorial Church in the center of the
Quad. Status Quo and Tradition would "say" that
it is still ri"ht there—in the center of Stanford
University. But, my idea of realism is not satisfied
with that. To occupy the central position in this
University, the values symbolized in Memorial
Church must be a dynamic permeating influence in
the lives of its students and faculty. And yet, I
don't mean to plug for the Memorial Church.
I mean to decry indifference to values, and to
denounce the transported parasitic existence which
charact i i:.os the lives of spiritually contented peo
ple who are indifferent to me and others around
them.
If we here at Stanford could banish that atti
tude of indifference from our campus, a number
of chancres would result. More interest would be
demonstrated in student government, the Honor
Code would lie more secure, the Cellar check
situation would be alleviated, control of the
atomic bomb would appear possible, and our
thinking about a future world government would
get somewhere.
If we are seeking only a trade school training
the situation is different. However, some of us still
tyant to know how we can become more efficient
m.«J more effective as free moral agents; and be
lieve that some guidance in these "things" is the
responsibility of those who teach.
