# HISTORY â€”1946

### ELLIOTT EPSTEEN 
When Mr. Phleger spoke to the campus last
Friday, he showed more than a great experience in
Germany. He revealed very definite powers of ob
servation and analysis. What ho said shows what
might bo the big problem of the occupation of
Germany.
Vividly, lie described the horrible conditions.
"Germans," he related, "are not planning the
next war. They are only planning what they will
eat tonight.
"In Berlin, there is a dead body in most front
yards. Transportation is paralyzed. The subways
are filled with water and dead bodies."
EFFECT
This is having its definite effect on the people of
Germany. This moss is coincident with the occu
pation. There is evidence that the Germans are
blaming it on us.
A recent magazine article quoted one German
soldier as saying, "First you blast my home to
rubble. Then you kill my buddies at the front.
Finally I come home and find mv job blown to
bits and mv girl friend living with an American
ofiicer for the food he'll give her. You can't expect
me to learn to love you Americans too quickly."
It is quii.o possible that the rancor will be so
great that, when we get out of Germany, a reaction
will sweep away everything that we have built

and put t.hc Nazis back in power.
NUERNBERG
On the other side of the picture is the Nuern
berg trial. This 'is the pictorial evidence of what
we are trying to build. We are trying to show the
Germans that it was their leaders who were re
sponsible for what happened to their cities, that
the best way to avoid its recurring when Germany
is rebuilt is to get a different kind of leadership.
Mr. Phleger showed how fair the trial of the
German leadership is, and how painstakingly the
evidence was accumulated.
NUERNBERG REACTION
Yel, here, the fact that Dr. Mansfeldt possibly
had a sweetheart, and that Mrs. M. blew her brains
out, got more publicity than Nuernberg ever
thought of getting. In Germany, it is quite pos
sible that a shift in the food rationing schedule
would relegate the trials to the last thing read.
It seems that we might not be able to do any
thing with Germany until the country is built up
again. We must, come to the Germans, not as de
stroyers, but as rebuilders, and, by taking the lat
ter role, relegate the Na/.i leadership to the former
one.
The battle in Germany now is behind the scenes,
hut it is the very real otic of the concepts of Nuern
berg versus the awful mess that the country is in.
