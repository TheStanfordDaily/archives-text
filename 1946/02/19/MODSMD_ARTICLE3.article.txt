# Controls Till '47—OPA
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 18 (UP).—
OPA officials told Congress today
that controls on everything except
rents may be lifted in 1947, but that
they must be kept until then to
avert a disastrous inflationary ex
plosion.
Chester Bowles, who is retiring as
price chief to become economicsta
bilizer, warned repeatedly that in
flationary pressures have reached
such dangerous heights that the na
tion's entire economic future is at
stake. He told the House Banking
Committee that it is imperative to
extend price controls without de
lay.
Kent Control
Zenas L. Potter, congressional ad
viser to Bowles, told the committee
that OPA anticipates "all controls
but rents can be eliminated in 1947."
But pressures on rents will endure
so long, he said, that Congress will
have to transfer rent control to
other agencies or to the states.
When that time comes, he said,
there will be no further need for
OPA.
Bowles read a long statement to
the committee. Later, he was ex
cused to attend a White House con
ference. He will resume the testi
mony tomorrow.
Congress Must Act
He told the House Banking Com
mittee that if disaster is to be avert
ed, Congress must act without delay
to:
1. Extend price control for one
year beyond the present June 30
expiration date.
2. Establish price ceilings on both
old and new homes to stop real es
tate inflation which otherwise will
wreck the construction industry.
3. Continue food subsidies beyond
July 1. Otherwise, control of "the
present inflationary dangers will
become impossible."
