# Area Plan---Con By ASSU Head
## 
### 
Open Letter to the Associated Stu- |
dents:
On Wednesday you are asked to j
go to the polls to decide which of j
two constitutions you want to be I
governed by.
All of the publicity presented in
the Daily has been biased in favor
of the new constitution and its area I
representation plan for electing j
members on Excom.
Favors Old Method
I am going on record as favoring
the new constitution with the ex
j ception of the area representation
plan. 1 am in favor of going back
to our old established method of
electing Excom members on a non- j
organizational, class basis.
The Executive Committee is the
legislative and administrative body
of the Associated Students and, as
such, should represent all elements
of the student population to whom
it is responsible for its actions. The
decisions of Excom should be guided
by one principle: a consideration j
of (he well-being of the University
as a whole.
War-time Necessity
The area plan whereby represen
! tatives were selected from within
' geographic boundaries, was a war
time necessity because of the in
stability of the class system. Stu
dents took heavy courses in order to
graduate in a hurry and, in general,
everyone's class status was indeter
minable.
Next school year Stanford will
return to a "state of normalcy" I
(whatever that is) and the ma
jority of students will adopt the
standard four-year period of time
I to complete their courses. 1 sin
cerely believe that we should re
turn to the class system of elect- !
ing l<!xcom members because the j
area plan, which has been on a |
trial basis for a quarter, has proved 1
to be inellicient. My arguments
are as follows:
1. Duplication of women repre- I
senlatives.
Every president of a women's liv- !
ing group is represented on Worn- j
en's Conference. The President of
j Women's Conference is an ex-oflicio
member of Excom and perfectly ca
pable of presenting the ideas and
criticisms of every women's living 112
group. Yet at the present Excom, !
selected on the area representation
plan, there are five women whose
living groups are represented
through Women's Conference Presi
dent.
2. Members elected under the i
i Area Plan fail to represent their area j
because of the constant changes in j
residence.
Three members of the present Ex- I
corn, chosen under the area plan, no |
longer reside in the area from which I
I they were originally elected. Is it !
fair to ask a duly elected member
to resign just because his residence j
is changed? I don't think so. If j
they were forced to resign, a spe- !
cial A.S.S.U. election would have j
to be called with all its added ex- j
pense and trouble. Under the old '
class system which I am advocating, j
a member of Excom could continue j
! to represent the student body in
general and still have the privilege j
| of changing his residence when- j
{ ever he thinks such a chance would J

be beneficial to his personal happi
ness and well-being.
3. Under Hie Area Plan the
views of members of the Excom
are restricted to the opinions of
their separate areas, which may be
in contrast to the future good of
Stanford, and they would tend to
ward a submission to pressure
from their separate groups without
considering the whole Stanford
picture.
4. The principal advantage of
having members selected from
classes is that they do not have
any special organizational body to
.represent—only that of the student
body as a whole. Under this plan
of representation on Excom there
is better chance for members of
(he highest governing body to
maintain a broader outlook in
their judgment. If special infor
mation is needed from a living
group or organization, their rep
resentative can be called before
Excom at any time.
New Constitution
For the reasons cited above I urge
each of you to go to the polls on
Wednesday and vote to adopt the
proposed new constitution — with
the exception of Article V, Section
4 which sets up the area representa
tion plan and insert in its stead Ar
ticle 11, Section 2 of the old consti
tution which is Stanford's tried and
proven method of selecting members
of Excom on a class basis.

of the new constitution and its area I
representation plan for electing j
members on Excom.
Favors Old Method
I am going on record as favoring
the new constitution with the ex
j ception of the area representation
plan. 1 am in favor of going back
to our old established method of
electing Excom members on a non- j
organizational, class basis.
The Executive Committee is the
legislative and administrative body
of the Associated Students and, as
such, should represent all elements
of the student population to whom
it is responsible for its actions. The
decisions of Excom should be guided
by one principle: a consideration j
of (he well-being of the University
as a whole.
War-time Necessity
The area plan whereby represen
! tatives were selected from within
' geographic boundaries, was a war
time necessity because of the in
stability of the class system. Stu
dents took heavy courses in order to
graduate in a hurry and, in general,
everyone's class status was indeter
minable.
Next school year Stanford will
return to a "state of normalcy" I
(whatever that is) and the ma
jority of students will adopt the
standard four-year period of time
I to complete their courses. 1 sin
cerely believe that we should re
turn to the class system of elect- !
ing l<!xcom members because the j
area plan, which has been on a |
trial basis for a quarter, has proved 1
to be inellicient. My arguments
are as follows:
1. Duplication of women repre- I
senlatives.
Every president of a women's liv- !
ing group is represented on Worn- j
en's Conference. The President of
j Women's Conference is an ex-oflicio
member of Excom and perfectly ca
pable of presenting the ideas and
criticisms of every women's living 112
group. Yet at the present Excom, !
selected on the area representation
plan, there are five women whose
living groups are represented
through Women's Conference Presi
dent.
2. Members elected under the i
i Area Plan fail to represent their area j
because of the constant changes in j
residence.
Three members of the present Ex- I
corn, chosen under the area plan, no |
longer reside in the area from which I
I they were originally elected. Is it !
fair to ask a duly elected member
to resign just because his residence j
is changed? I don't think so. If j
they were forced to resign, a spe- !
cial A.S.S.U. election would have j
to be called with all its added ex- j
pense and trouble. Under the old '
class system which I am advocating, j
a member of Excom could continue j
! to represent the student body in
general and still have the privilege j
| of changing his residence when- j
{ ever he thinks such a chance would J

be beneficial to his personal happi
ness and well-being.
3. Under Hie Area Plan the
views of members of the Excom
are restricted to the opinions of
their separate areas, which may be
in contrast to the future good of
Stanford, and they would tend to
ward a submission to pressure
from their separate groups without
considering the whole Stanford
picture.
4. The principal advantage of
having members selected from
classes is that they do not have
any special organizational body to
.represent—only that of the student
body as a whole. Under this plan
of representation on Excom there
is better chance for members of
(he highest governing body to
maintain a broader outlook in
their judgment. If special infor
mation is needed from a living
group or organization, their rep
resentative can be called before
Excom at any time.

plan. 1 am in favor of going back
to our old established method of
electing Excom members on a non- j
organizational, class basis.
The Executive Committee is the
legislative and administrative body
of the Associated Students and, as
such, should represent all elements
of the student population to whom
it is responsible for its actions. The
decisions of Excom should be guided
by one principle: a consideration j
of (he well-being of the University
as a whole.
War-time Necessity
The area plan whereby represen
! tatives were selected from within
' geographic boundaries, was a war
time necessity because of the in
stability of the class system. Stu
dents took heavy courses in order to
graduate in a hurry and, in general,
everyone's class status was indeter
minable.
Next school year Stanford will
return to a "state of normalcy" I
(whatever that is) and the ma
jority of students will adopt the
standard four-year period of time
I to complete their courses. 1 sin
cerely believe that we should re
turn to the class system of elect- !
ing l<!xcom members because the j
area plan, which has been on a |
trial basis for a quarter, has proved 1
to be inellicient. My arguments
are as follows:
1. Duplication of women repre- I
senlatives.
Every president of a women's liv- !
ing group is represented on Worn- j
en's Conference. The President of
j Women's Conference is an ex-oflicio
member of Excom and perfectly ca
pable of presenting the ideas and
criticisms of every women's living 112
group. Yet at the present Excom, !
selected on the area representation
plan, there are five women whose
living groups are represented
through Women's Conference Presi
dent.
2. Members elected under the i
i Area Plan fail to represent their area j
because of the constant changes in j
residence.
Three members of the present Ex- I
corn, chosen under the area plan, no |
longer reside in the area from which I
I they were originally elected. Is it !
fair to ask a duly elected member
to resign just because his residence j
is changed? I don't think so. If j
they were forced to resign, a spe- !
cial A.S.S.U. election would have j
to be called with all its added ex- j
pense and trouble. Under the old '
class system which I am advocating, j
a member of Excom could continue j
! to represent the student body in
general and still have the privilege j
| of changing his residence when- j
{ ever he thinks such a chance would J

be beneficial to his personal happi
ness and well-being.
3. Under Hie Area Plan the
views of members of the Excom
are restricted to the opinions of
their separate areas, which may be
in contrast to the future good of
Stanford, and they would tend to
ward a submission to pressure
from their separate groups without
considering the whole Stanford
picture.
4. The principal advantage of
having members selected from
classes is that they do not have
any special organizational body to
.represent—only that of the student
body as a whole. Under this plan
of representation on Excom there
is better chance for members of
(he highest governing body to
maintain a broader outlook in
their judgment. If special infor
mation is needed from a living
group or organization, their rep
resentative can be called before
Excom at any time.
New Constitution
For the reasons cited above I urge
each of you to go to the polls on
Wednesday and vote to adopt the
proposed new constitution — with
the exception of Article V, Section
4 which sets up the area representa
tion plan and insert in its stead Ar
ticle 11, Section 2 of the old consti
tution which is Stanford's tried and
proven method of selecting members
of Excom on a class basis.
Bob Kennedy,
President, A.S.S.U.
