Liberal Education
The following excerpts are taken
J from the speeches given by various
j faculty members at the afternoon
' panel discussions and section meet
ings.
Theodore M. Greene, visiting pro
fessor ol' the school of Humanities,
"Stanlord and Liberal Education:
"... A privately endowed univer
sity like Stanford ought to be able
to offer its students a far better lib
eral education than any tax-sup
ported institution. Its responsibility
is correspondingly great, for liberal
education is today the chief creative
force in our society, the chief pro

tection against political slavery and
irresponsibility, and the only formal
preparation for a rich and happy
liie." •
Cloth Discusses Atom
Felix M. Keesing, professor of an
thropology, "Racial Tensions": ". . .
Anthropologists and other scholars
are in general optimistic in regard
to man's capacity to achieve 'One
World'—if he has the will to do it.
Racial prejudice arises not from in
born human nature but from social
strains and stresses which are at
tained by educational and other
neans "
Felix Bloch, professor of physics,
"From the Core of the Atom to the
Atomic Bomb": ". . . Stanford has
the distinguished honor of belong
ing to the very few dozens of insti
tutions in the world where basic
research on the properties of neu
trons was carried out during the
years preceding World War 11.
"It was here that the magnetic
properties of neutrons were discov
ered and further investigated by a
small group of scientists, working
with a small cyclotron, and it was
this same group which did some of
the early and highly secret work
for the Manhattan Project, first at
Stanford and later at Los Alamos."
Labor and Management
Paul Eliel, professor of industrial
relations, "Self-Control for Labor
;ind Management": ". . . The pres
ent confused governmental policies
militate against a return to volun
tary procedures and a restoration
of self-control.
"These policies cause one side or
the other to hope that intervention
by the government in labor disputes
will pive a better break than could
be obtained through a determined
effort to settle by negotiation, con
ciliation, or arbitration. There must
be a return to genuine collective
bargaining before we can hope for
a real improvement in the character
and quality of our industrial rela
tions."
Oil Resources Discussed
A. I. Levorsen, professor of geol
ogy, "What Are Our Petroleum Re
sources?": ". . . . The high taxes,
low prices, restrictions, and regu
lations of the war years have driven
many wildcatters from the business.
The result, whether due to exhaus
tion of our resources or insufficient
effort for their discovery, has been
a decline in discovery rate which
is alarming.
"Geologically there seems good
reason to believe there is yet much
unexplored ground favorable for the
accumulation of oil and gas pools

which, unless it is more aggressive
ly prospected, will never develop a
reserve because it will not be dis
covered."
