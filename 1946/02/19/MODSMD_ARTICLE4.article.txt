DFTROIT. Feb. 18 (UP).â€”Gen

Auto Workers made little headway
in a three-hour conference tonight
in efforts to end their wage-security

GM strike.
Federal Labor Mediator James F.
Dewey, announcing that both GM
President C. E. Wilson and UAW
Chief R. J. Thomas again would be
present when talks were resumed at
2:30 p.m. tomorrow, said "that there
is a great deal of negotiating to be
done."
"Both sides are drawing up a list
of all things which must be done,"
the federal labor ace said. "We are
doing this in an effort to clear the
decks."
