# Northern Champ Still Undecided
## Idaho, Oregon State Still Mold Lead In Northern Division Conference 
### 
The University of Idaho Vandals and the Oregon State College Beavers
are tied for the lead of the Northern Division of the Coast Conference after
the seventh week of play. Both teams have a record of nine victories and
four losses, and have three games left to play in the regular schedule.
The Vandals retained their tie last weekend when they defeated the
Washington Huskies in a pair of games at Seattle, 51-48 and 40-38. These
wins gave the Vandals three out of four from Washington for the season,
and marked the first time in history that they had taken two straight games
from the Huskies on the latters' home court.
In Corvallis last Friday and Saturday nights the Beavers took two easy
wins from Washington State, 63-43 and 54-33. The Cougars, fresh from
two grueling games with Oregon, were, no match for the Beavers.
Idaho has been the surprise of the league this year. The Vandals were
lightly regarded at the opening of the seaso, after losing four of their first
five games. However, since then they have come like a house afire, and
won eight in a row.
The Vandals have about the best five-man team in the country. There
is no outstanding player among them. This is borne out in the fact that of
the lop ten men in the conference scoring ladder, five of them are from
Idaho. The forwards, Del Mortensen and Ray Quinn, are both tall and
expert shots. Center Jack Phoenix is the tallest man on the court at 6 ft.
9 in., which makes him a very valuable backboard man. Len Pyne and
Bill Carbaugh at guards hold the team together and are probably the two
most important players.
The Beavers are led bv their 6 ft. B'v in. center, Red Rocha. who fin
ished second among division scorers last season. He is a tower of strength

on the backboard, and has a beau
tiful pivot shot. At forwards are
Ted Heningsen and Erland Ander
son and at guards are Captain Bcr
nie McGrath and CliiT Crandall.
Glenn Warren, (5 ft. G in. forward,
was injured recently and will prob-

ably be out for the rest of the sea- j
son. His play on the backboard will
be sorely missed.
The University of Oregon, the
only other team with a chance at
the title, seem to have found them- j
selves at last. The defending !
champs with a six and five record i
will have to win all of their games I
to stand a chance for the title. Their I
standouts are Dick Wilkins and j
Captain Bob Hamilton.
Washington State, despite the re
turn of Gale Bishop from the army. I
has failed to live up to expccta- j
tions. Bishop scored 52 points in |
two games aaginst Oregon last
week, but otherwise has not looked I
very good.
Idaho does not see any action this !
week, but will meet the U. of O. in !
a pair of games in Moscow next j
Monday and Tuesday. This Friday j
and Saturday O.S.C. meets Wash- I
ington at Seattle, and Oregon trav
els to the Pallouse country to meet
Washington State. Alter these j
games, only a game between W.S.C. |
and Idaho at Moscow and one be- i
tween Oregon and Oregon State at
Corvallis on March 2 remain to be j
played.
