Stanford didn't come out so bad
ly over the weekend with Cal as
you might think. Basketball grab
bed the limelight, and that record
shows a double loss to the Golden
Bear, although the Indians showed
better in those two games than any
other time this season.
In two less - publicized sports.
Stanford emerged victorious. Car
dinal net men downed the wrestlers
of A.S.U.C., and Stanford's rifie
team beat Cal's trigger men.
The rifle team defeat suffered by
Cal was the first in a long time.
Stanford's team is composed of Har
ry Varner, Gene Hardin, Bob Cook,
Vern Braughton, Nelson Shoup, B.
K. White, and John Peterson.
Word comes from Archie Sam
Romani, famous track star of a few
years back, that the long-dreamed
of four-minute mile will be run in
the near future.
Romani, who always ran close to
Glen Cunningham, claims that the
dream mile will be accomplished by
psychology as much as by physical
endurance.
The runner, according to Romani.
should concentrate on the 1,500-
meter record and forget the mile.
Then, as he crosses the 1.500-meter
stripe, he should switch his thoughts
to the mile and continue struggling
on that long, hard extra trail of 119
yards, 2 feet, and 2 inches that will
bring him to the mile ribbon.
If Romani is right, our track
coach ought to get in touch with the
psychology department and see if
there is any hidden cinderpath ma
terial around. Maybe the fellow
studying environmental factors as
contrasted with inheritance is wast
ing his time, if he can zip off a four
minute mile.

Turning the telescope ahead 12
months finds the basketball situa
tion a lot rosier than was predicted
in Slants last week. From various
and sundry come the reports that a
number of former Stanford players
are heading back to the Farm as
soon as they are able to don the
ieans. Among them are Morley
Thompson, crack player who played
on the local independent team last
year; Dave Berlin, Stanford guard
before he entered the service, and
a star with the Norfolk naval five
last season; Davy Davidson, mem

ber of the '43 frosh squad, and sec
ond highest scorer in the Rocky
Mountain League while a naval ca
det at Colorado. Besides the above
mentioned, Howie Dallmar is sure
to return. Jim Pollard's status as a
Cardinal is not known yet.
Stanford's place in the standings
next season should be exactly the
reverse of this year's spot. Namely,
Stanford should win the conference
iitle.

Joe Louis's statement that he has
some sort of atomic punch cooked
up for Billy Conn reminds us of the
time Lou Nova, California's contri
bution to fistiana, had the cosmic
punch to use on Louis. And what
happened? Conn had to go through
all the yogi motions he ever knew
to stand up as long as he did to the
Brown Bomber's onslaught. If Mr.
Joseph Louis Barrows sticks to his
good old-fashioned right jab, he
should have no trouble at all with
Conn, come next June.

As basketball makes its exit in
the sportscope for another season,
baseball and track make their en
trance. Stanford fields teams in
both of these sports, but how they
will fare against oncomers is an
other story. In somewhat the same
spot as basketball, Harry Wolter,
baseball coach, and Jack Weiers
hauser, track mentor, hope that the
Red and Whites will be able to
stand up against any competition.
By The way) if there are any stu
dents interested in securing a man
agerial post with the baseball and
track teams, hop over to the B.A.C.
post haste for a talk with the coach
es. It's a good deal.
The jobs mean traveling with the
team, a Block S, and lots of fun.
These positions were always hotly
fought for before the war.

Turning the telescope ahead 12

Thompson, crack player who played

before he entered the service, and

Joe Louis's statement that he has
some sort of atomic punch cooked
up for Billy Conn reminds us of the
time Lou Nova, California's contri

punch to use on Louis. And what
happened? Conn had to go through
all the yogi motions he ever knew
to stand up as long as he did to the
Brown Bomber's onslaught. If Mr.

good old-fashioned right jab, he
should have no trouble at all with
Conn, come next June.

Stanford didn't come out so bad
ly over the weekend with Cal as
you might think. Basketball grab
bed the limelight, and that record
shows a double loss to the Golden
Bear, although the Indians showed
better in those two games than any
other time this season.
In two less - publicized sports.
Stanford emerged victorious. Car
dinal net men downed the wrestlers
of A.S.U.C., and Stanford's rifie
team beat Cal's trigger men.
The rifle team defeat suffered by
Cal was the first in a long time.
Stanford's team is composed of Har
ry Varner, Gene Hardin, Bob Cook,
Vern Braughton, Nelson Shoup, B.
K. White, and John Peterson.
Word comes from Archie Sam
Romani, famous track star of a few
years back, that the long-dreamed
of four-minute mile will be run in
the near future.
Romani, who always ran close to
Glen Cunningham, claims that the
dream mile will be accomplished by
psychology as much as by physical
endurance.
The runner, according to Romani.
should concentrate on the 1,500-
meter record and forget the mile.
Then, as he crosses the 1.500-meter
stripe, he should switch his thoughts
to the mile and continue struggling
on that long, hard extra trail of 119
yards, 2 feet, and 2 inches that will
bring him to the mile ribbon.
If Romani is right, our track
coach ought to get in touch with the
psychology department and see if
there is any hidden cinderpath ma
terial around. Maybe the fellow
studying environmental factors as
contrasted with inheritance is wast
ing his time, if he can zip off a four

As basketball makes its exit in
the sportscope for another season,
baseball and track make their en
trance. Stanford fields teams in
both of these sports, but how they
will fare against oncomers is an
other story. In somewhat the same
spot as basketball, Harry Wolter,
baseball coach, and Jack Weiers
hauser, track mentor, hope that the
Red and Whites will be able to
stand up against any competition.
By The way) if there are any stu
dents interested in securing a man
agerial post with the baseball and
track teams, hop over to the B.A.C.
post haste for a talk with the coach
es. It's a good deal.
The jobs mean traveling with the
team, a Block S, and lots of fun.
These positions were always hotly
fought for before the war.
