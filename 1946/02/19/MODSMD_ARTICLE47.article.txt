# Swim Team Meets Navy
## 
### 
The Stanford swimming team, the
boys who are being counted on to
re-introduce Injun teams back to
their winning ways, are preparing
for the opening of their season with
several practice meets.
It has been previously announced
that our boys will meet the Olym
pic Club on March 9. This date has
been moved up to March 2.
They have also agreed to take on
a team of stellar navy swimmers
stationed at Treasure Island. The
Indians are going to race the serv
ice team on Wednesday, Feb. 20.
The top performer for the navy is
Hagen, a breast-stroker who used
to do all right in Southern Califor
nia even against our own Hester.
However, of late Hester has been
improving rapidly and has chalked
up very fast records in practice ses
sions. This will be the race of the
night. The other boys on our squad
shouldn't have too much trouble
with the navy in their respective
events. After all, Treasure Island
teams labor under the handicaps of
shipping orders, demobilization, and
lack of really intensive training
routines. These things combine to
keep their teams from maintaining
a peak of efficiency.
The list of the boys our team will
carry over to the island is as fol
lows: Free-style—Anderson, Arm
strong, Bell, Sperry, Rule, and East
man. Breast - strokers — 801, Bor
cher, and Hester. Back-strokers—
Borchers and Briskin. Diving —
Shreiber.
The outcome of this match is
looked upon as an indication of how
the squad will fare in conference
competition come spring quarter.
The results which will be in Friday
should give us a rough idea.
