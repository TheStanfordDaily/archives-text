# Unseen Backstage Work Supports Farm Dramas
## 
### CAM RYALL 
The curtain rings down, and the
first one-act play is over. The lights
go on. The audience turns to its
neighbor and says, "a good show,
well-done!"
Behind the scenes, hands and feet
move swiftly to change sets and to
place the carefully prepared props
in their correct places. It is not only
the good acting, but also the weeks
of backstage work that make the
play a success.
Actor Interprets
When an actor comes onto the

stage he not only portrays his part
but he is also the speaker for the
playwright, the direct®]', the elec
trician, and at times the prompter.
He is one of many who have worked
for the applause.
Nearly everyone knows that the
Memorial Hall has two theatres, but
comparatively few people know of
the "Green Room," where the cast
can relax between entrances, and
await their cues. The legends of the
makeup room are rarely told and
only the stage addicts call Mrs. John
Lievsay, director of costumes and
makeup, "Mrs. L."
Backstage "Alive"
When visitipg backstage one al
ways knows when a play is in pro
duction for the halls in the back of
the theatre are alive with tired and
yet eager people. Turning a comer
one may be accosted by someone
who is faintly familiar, and who
calls out to you. Later your best
friend complains of your coldness,
and you learn that he was experi
menting wi,th a new beard.
After a while steps are made to
ward a door, on which is marked
"backstage entrance." Inside it is
very dark, and having stumbled over
some chairs one will see that there
arc also huge ropes, ladders, pianos,
artificial trees and a further weird
assortment of props. An electrician
may be fixing the sound track.
Back outside, nametags arc on the
six dressing room doors and ciga
rette smoke curls over a group of
silent people. The director calls out
that the rehearsal is about to begin.
Weeks of work follow each other,
and when the final curtain call is
taken, the applause echoes for the
students, the teachers, the actors
and the crews.
