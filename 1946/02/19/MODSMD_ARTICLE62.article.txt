# Farm Playwrights Show Skills in Novelty One-Acts
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
Well-written plays, lacking the
amateur flavor that usually denotes
college productions, supplemented
by novel and effective staging high
lighted Ram's Head's annual pres
entation of "One-Acts" Friday night
in the Little Theater.
Each of the three plays was dis
tinctly individualistic, giving the
audience a balanced diet of humor
and drama. The shortness of the
plays, however, did not allow many
of the players the opportunity to
show their true acting ability.
Varnardo Notable
Norman Varnardo as the kindly,
childish Jonathon of "St. Jonathon
Jones" turned in a notable perform
ance. His expressive gestures and
slow articulate voice, indicative of
the character, contributed much to
the part. However, it was ten-year
old David Neilsen, Jr., in his role
of little Thaddeus who completely
charmed the audience. Reminiscent
of the Tom Sawyer type, David
handled his part with the assured
ness of an adult actor.
Thaddeus' boyish, unquestioning
belief that Jonathon was wearing a
halo was very appealing. Varnardo
as the simple backyard philosopher
was. in many ways, the grown-up
edition of David having the same
interests, the same thoughts as the
small boy. Jane Saulsbery, portray
ing Jonathon's domineering, shrew
ish wife gave meaning to her sup
porting role.
Unusual Set
The unusual set of "St. Jonathon
Jones" was very striking. Before
the curtain rose a painted scene of
the house and garden was flashed
on a screen. The set itself was
done with a minimum of scenery,
comparable to the New York pro
duction of "Qur Town."
"A Character Study," a fantasy of
an author whose characters are a
counterpart of himself and his loves,
was written in the sophisticated,
smart repartee oft modern drama, a
decided and pleasing contrast to the
first one-act. Each role and coun
ter-role was fairly equal in quality

and tone, all of the roles being very
brief. Jon Hadley as the playwright i
torn between two women and his
counterpart Bill Melton gave con
vincing performances, but the au- !
dience's attention was riveted to ,
Joan Woodruff, wkose vivid cos- |
turning lent emphasis to her fine |
portrayal of the "wrong woman." j
Although Carmen GenshefT ade- '
quatcly handled the smaller coun- i
ter-role of Janice, Miss Woodruff's }
role gave her a greater opportunity*
to display her talents.
Ingenues Sincere
Newcomers Kathryn Manfrin and
Ruth Fisher, cast as the two inge
nues of the play, handled their roles
with sincere feeling, while a fine |
character portrayal and comic re
lief was supplied by Irene Griffin as 1
the maid.
Bold, realistic drama was the key- j
note of "A Bridge Goes Two Ways." j
The play was set to leave the audi- j
ence with a single vivid impression j
of coldness and reality. Bob Blum's ,
portrayal of the soldier to whom to- j
morrow meant a new life had de
cided depth, but it was Mary Cogs- |
well as the Girl who turned in one j
of the best performances of the one- â– 
acts. Her every motion plus the '
harshness of her voice clearly dei
picted her character. Most effective j
was the ingenious atmosphere of
fog and waves which played up the
melancholy mood of the act.
Director Merits Praise
Janice Swan, over-all director of 1
the play, merits much praise for |
giving Stanford audiences one of j
the finest one-act productions in !
many seasons.
Sharing honors with Miss Swan ;
are Pat Neilsen, Murray Stirton, I
and Lorna Robertson, the individ- \

Uiil directors, and the three play
wrights, Bill Melton, Jean Byei's,
and Robert Thompson. Marie Jo
McGervey, technical director, de
serves special mention for letting
the public have a taste of the new,
the different in modern staging.
