Chairman Brien McMahon, D.,
Conn., of the Senate Atomic Energy
Committee, said tonight that he has
received tis.su ranee from Secretary
of War Robert P. Patterson that no
atomic secrets have been divulged
through public committee hearings.
McMahon issued a statement re
futing charges from army atomic
sources that committee hearings
have been one of several leaks by
means of which heretofore secret
atomic information has been re
vealed.
He said that Patterson and Maj.
Gen. Leslie R. Groves, chief of the
army's Manhattan Project, have
"assured me that they do not know
of such disclosures," and added that
"there have been none."
Groves asserted earlier that there
have been more leaks on the atomic
bomb during the past four months
than occurred in the years it was
being developed.
At the same time Secretary of
State James F. Byrnes denied re
ports that the State Department had
asked the Federal Bureau of Inves
