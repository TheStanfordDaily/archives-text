# VOTE FOR ASSU, CONSTITUTION TODAY
## Vote Yes on No. 1 
### 
We strongly urge that today, when you go to the polls, you
vote for No. 1, RATIFICATION OF NEW CONSTITUTION, which
includes the area representation plan for Executive Committee.
We are convinced that the only way we can hope to have a
student government that is alert and responsive to the needs of
the majority is through area representation. These are our rea
sons:
1. It will ensure a fair distribution of members, each actively
interested in the affairs of the campus as a whole. With the old
class representation system, the vote too often resulted in an
Excom block of members from one area, leaving the rest of the
campus in a "blackout" of inadequate representation.
2. It provides an actual channel through which the opinion of
the student body may get to Excom, and through which Excom's
decisions may be explained and called to each student's atten
tion. This direct line is established when your representative at
tends meetings of the intermediary organization composed of
the presidents of living groups in your area, and the presidents
carry to and from house meetings the latest developments in
campus affairs.
Without reservation, we endorse the area representation
plan. It is strong enough, flexible enough, and broad enough to
give us the kind of student government we want â€”an active and
progressive form of democracy.
