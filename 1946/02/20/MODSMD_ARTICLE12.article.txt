# Area Plan Pro, Con Told

### 
CON
The following points have been formulated as arguments against the
new area representation clause in the new constitution and for the class
representation clauso in the old constitution:
Now that the war is over class lines will again become definite and
the class will function as a strong and influential factor in campus life.

Under area representation there
is duplication of women represen
tatives on Excom since the presi
dent of Women's Conference is an
ex-officio member and supposedly
represents all house presidents.
Students elected to Excom by
areas sometimes change their resi
dence before their term expires,
thus making them representative of
groups in which they do not live.
Members of specific living areas
tend to belong to pressure groups
which limit Excom to opinions of
separate sections when general
campus opinion is needed.
Under class representation mem
bers of living groups do not have to
be Excom members in order to pre
sent their ideas to Excom—they
may appear before the legislative
group at any time.
Under area representation no
more than one representative may
ever come from a single living
group, which may exclude really
valuable students from election to
Excom.
Class representation on Excom is
formed by each of the upper three
classes — sophomore, junior, and
senior — electing two representa
tives. •

PRO
The following arguments are offered in rebuttal to the points favoring
class representation on Excom as opposed to area representation:
Even before the war, under the class representation system many
Excom members lived in only one, or two, sections of campus and two
members lived off-campus. Class ties were weak and often the ma-

jority of students were without any
direct contact with their legislative
body at all.
There Ls no duplication of wom
en representative on Excom since
the president of Women's Confer
ence is ex-officio and does not have
a vote. She has an honorary po
sition with no actual power and no
actual results of her work to pre
sent before house presidents.
Examples of area representatives
to Excom changing residence be
fore their term expires and thus
representative of groups in which
they do not live have occurred in
frequently, and those examples are
direct results of the current housing
problem. As soon as this problem
has been remedied, situations like
Sequoia's being closed will not
arise.
Members of specific living areas
certainly represent no more strong
pressure groups than do those mem
bers of classes. The principal dif
ference is that living group mem
bers can speak with authority con
cerning the wishes of their con
stituents, while the class represen
tatives necessarily may represent
only a limited section of their class.
Situations seldom arose under the
class plan where students of their
own volition went before Excom
and voiccd their "beefs." Student
inertia is notorious, and it takes a
certain amount of prodding and
real interest before an unconcerned
student will take time out to go to
Excom.
With the requirement that a liv
ing group may have only one mem
ber elected to Excom, a security is
offered that only the best student
from each group will gain member
ship; rather than four or five mem
bers from one section of campus
winning election merely because of
social standing.
Transfers and new freshmen do
not have the opportunity to meet
and know all able class members as
well as they are able to meet and
know fellow students in their liv
ing groups. Under class represen
tation the freshman class was not
represented at all.
Area representation is formed by
specific living group areas electing
a representative to Excom who is
responsible to the students in his
residence. Area reprcsentatives-at
large arc elected to insure general
representation.

inertia is notorious, and it takes a
certain amount of prodding and
real interest before an unconcerned
student will take time out to go to
Excom.
With the requirement that a liv
ing group may have only one mem
ber elected to Excom, a security is
offered that only the best student
from each group will gain member
ship; rather than four or five mem
bers from one section of campus
winning election merely because of
social standing.
Transfers and new freshmen do
not have the opportunity to meet

know fellow students in their liv
ing groups. Under class represen
tation the freshman class was not
represented at all.
Area representation is formed by
specific living group areas electing
a representative to Excom who is
responsible to the students in his

representation.
CON
The following points have been formulated as arguments against the
new area representation clause in the new constitution and for the class
representation clauso in the old constitution:
Now that the war is over class lines will again become definite and
the class will function as a strong and influential factor in campus life.

Under area representation there
is duplication of women represen
tatives on Excom since the presi
dent of Women's Conference is an
ex-officio member and supposedly
represents all house presidents.
Students elected to Excom by
areas sometimes change their resi
dence before their term expires,
thus making them representative of
groups in which they do not live.
Members of specific living areas
tend to belong to pressure groups
which limit Excom to opinions of
separate sections when general
campus opinion is needed.
Under class representation mem
bers of living groups do not have to
be Excom members in order to pre
sent their ideas to Excom—they
may appear before the legislative
group at any time.
Under area representation no
more than one representative may
ever come from a single living
group, which may exclude really
valuable students from election to
Excom.
Class representation on Excom is
formed by each of the upper three
classes — sophomore, junior, and
senior — electing two representa
tives. •

PRO
The following arguments are offered in rebuttal to the points favoring
class representation on Excom as opposed to area representation:
Even before the war, under the class representation system many
Excom members lived in only one, or two, sections of campus and two
members lived off-campus. Class ties were weak and often the ma-

jority of students were without any
direct contact with their legislative
body at all.
There Ls no duplication of wom
en representative on Excom since
the president of Women's Confer
ence is ex-officio and does not have
a vote. She has an honorary po
sition with no actual power and no
actual results of her work to pre
sent before house presidents.
Examples of area representatives
to Excom changing residence be
fore their term expires and thus
representative of groups in which
they do not live have occurred in
frequently, and those examples are
direct results of the current housing
problem. As soon as this problem
has been remedied, situations like
Sequoia's being closed will not
arise.
Members of specific living areas
certainly represent no more strong
pressure groups than do those mem
bers of classes. The principal dif
ference is that living group mem
bers can speak with authority con
cerning the wishes of their con
stituents, while the class represen
tatives necessarily may represent
only a limited section of their class.
Situations seldom arose under the
class plan where students of their
