# Yes, Area Representation
## WE'RE NOT BIASED, WE'RE ENTHUSIASTIC 
### 
Since this is our last chance to explain a
little more fully why we endorse Excom area
representation for the campus, we'd like to
back it up with a few theories on student
government.
The first is that student government is not
only a "good deal," but essential to the edu
cation of any person who wants to be an
active citizen of the United States or of the
world. But there is very little percentage in
having a government which is run by a se
lect few, and seldom touches upon the con
sciousness of the ordinary citizen.
What v/e are flatly stating is that our stu
dent government at Stanford has been to
most of us something so remote that we have
let it run downhill into a regular rut of iner
tia. Under class representation we had a
chance to go to Excom every Wednesday, but
hardly anyone took the time or the initiative.
Under area representation we have the
opportunity to find through house meetings
the opinion of the majority. It gives Excom
the chance to legislate on a democratic ba
sis, rather than on isolated cases or on a rep
resentative's guess as to the policies desired
by his constituents.
The second idea is that Excom must be
made up of intelligent persons seriously in
terested in making student government
something more than a routine affair. We

frankly feel that before the area representa
tion plan was established, Excom was all too
often a group which was not only restricted
to one part of the campus, but politically in
effective. We think the cause for this inef
fectiveness lay in choosing representatives
by class.
Persons were often elected to office simply
because they had been socially popular in
their freshman year, or had the combined
support of pressure groups.
Lastly, the argument that area representa
tion falls down because there may be more
than one person in a certain area who is ex
ceptional and who should be on Excom, is
as illogical as saying that class representa
tion is at fault because there are more than
two persons from each class who should
have office. The point is to decide which
system will contribute most to effective stu
dent government, and the arguments seem
to line up in favor of the area plan.
We are not biased in our endorsement of
the new system. We studied both plans,
compared, "talked it over" with proponents
of both, and reached our decision without
bias, but with a great enthusiasm for the
possibilities that area representation has
within its structure. Your vote today and
enthusiasm tomorrow can make those possi
bilities certainties.

bilities certainties.
Since this is our last chance to explain a
little more fully why we endorse Excom area
representation for the campus, we'd like to
back it up with a few theories on student
government.
The first is that student government is not
only a "good deal," but essential to the edu
cation of any person who wants to be an
active citizen of the United States or of the
world. But there is very little percentage in
having a government which is run by a se
lect few, and seldom touches upon the con
sciousness of the ordinary citizen.
What v/e are flatly stating is that our stu
dent government at Stanford has been to
most of us something so remote that we have
let it run downhill into a regular rut of iner
tia. Under class representation we had a
chance to go to Excom every Wednesday, but
hardly anyone took the time or the initiative.
Under area representation we have the
opportunity to find through house meetings
the opinion of the majority. It gives Excom
the chance to legislate on a democratic ba
sis, rather than on isolated cases or on a rep
resentative's guess as to the policies desired
by his constituents.
The second idea is that Excom must be
made up of intelligent persons seriously in
terested in making student government
something more than a routine affair. We

frankly feel that before the area representa
tion plan was established, Excom was all too
often a group which was not only restricted
to one part of the campus, but politically in
effective. We think the cause for this inef
fectiveness lay in choosing representatives
by class.
Persons were often elected to office simply
because they had been socially popular in
their freshman year, or had the combined
support of pressure groups.
Lastly, the argument that area representa
tion falls down because there may be more
than one person in a certain area who is ex
ceptional and who should be on Excom, is
as illogical as saying that class representa
tion is at fault because there are more than
two persons from each class who should
have office. The point is to decide which
system will contribute most to effective stu
dent government, and the arguments seem
to line up in favor of the area plan.
We are not biased in our endorsement of
the new system. We studied both plans,
compared, "talked it over" with proponents
of both, and reached our decision without
bias, but with a great enthusiasm for the
possibilities that area representation has
within its structure. Your vote today and
enthusiasm tomorrow can make those possi
bilities certainties.
