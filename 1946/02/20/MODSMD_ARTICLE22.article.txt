A ROSE IS A ROSE
To the Editor:
Mubba-hubba, Yoiks, talley-ho, and away, a rose
i l rose is a rose is a rose, Gertrude Stein. Once
upon a Midnight, Dearie, Picasso, pistachio, and
Regal Pale. Cripes, we're reeling with culture!
Ain't it. wonderful to be academic! Our friend, now
writing Fascination with own Words Dept. in Cam
pus Opinion (continued this time, yet!) deplores the
lack of response he's been getting from readers on
his dissertations ol' Man, as a Social Enigma, or
something. He may have something there. He
probably has a lot. He pleads for "understanding."
Buddy, I'm all for it. Try deleting about 78 per
cent <,112 your theses, and maybe somebody will both
er to reÂ«-.d more than the first two sentences. The
majority of us get enough of that sort, of thing in
our required reading.

SMOKE 'EM, POKE 'EM
Have you smoked your cigarette on Quad lately?
Or have you noticed. There are no cigaretle ma
chines yet, nor SMOKE HERE signs, but
(here is no longer a tradition of "no smoking on
Quad." Everybody does.
People used to come from far nnd near to behold
the 13th Marvel of the world, the modern generation
upholding an ancient tradition at Stanford. But
now it is gone.
I guess we were just unlucky. This generation is
too weak. We can't take it. Our parents were better
than we are. We have no pride, we don't care, we
have no consciences, we smoke on Quad.
Sincerely,
Smorce 'em, Poke 'em
(L. C. Brown)
