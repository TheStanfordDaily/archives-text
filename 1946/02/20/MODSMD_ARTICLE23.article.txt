Do you enjoy your classes?
We'll tell you why you don't.
You are a slave to your notebook. You sit in
' !:• . and copy every word the professor says for 50
minutes, never taking your eyes or pen off the page.
At the end of the period you feel as though you
had bv en through an hour-long mental beating, and
yet you haven't the slightest idea of what was said.
in most college courses this is not necessary. You
con sit and listen to the professor, intermittently
noting any particular fact or exact wording which
you wish to keep intact. At the same time you can
absorb what is being said and actually enjoy the
lecture. The majority of your instructors speak
rapidly enough to keep your attention, if you are
thinking about what they are saying.
When examination time comes, you are not
forced to read over the entire lectures for a period
of several weeks, or a quarter. You already have
that in your mind. You merely refresh your memo

ry on the precise data which your notes contain.
To this simple plan we owe our phenomenal
scholastic success and soaring Bawlout average.

Understand that the sponsors of the Spring Quar
ter Reg Dance have contracted for the KQW staff
band to play for their dance the evening of Reg Day,
April 1.
They said something about the ork having 16
or GO pieces and a lush feminine vocalist. They shut
the door before we could hear the name.

Too bad the Sophomores were forced to hire Ted
Fioßito for 1200 skins when they could have gotten
Duke Ellington for only twice that amount. Would
you rather hear Fioßito play for four hours or the
Duke play for two?

Did anyone read Article 111, Section 12 of the
proposed new Constitution? Very interesting.
