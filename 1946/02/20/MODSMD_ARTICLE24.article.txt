### ELLIOTT EPSTEEN 
With Azerbaijan a lait accompli, there might be
two other areas of Russian expansion. The first is
Manchuria, where trouble is already developing,
and the second is eastern Turkey, and especially
Kars and Adrahan.
A large demand on Turkey, including the Black
Sea coast and the oil deposits there, would mean
war. Russia has little chance of getting her fists on
the Dardanelles as things .stand now.
But Kars and Adrahan have caused some dispute.
These are two provinces on the Russo-Turkish
border that have been Turkish most of the time,
but were ceded to Russia at the end of the Russo-
Turkish war in 1877-78.
H)I!> Settlement
'I he Turkish government has been releasing its
side of the story here through its embassy, and this
column was fortunate enough to obtain one of its
informative documents through Mr. Sorvet Duran,
a Turkish student.
'I he basic Russian case which has'not been put
forth officially but which was propounded in the
tightly controlled Moscow press, is that, first, Kars
and Adrahan were taken from the Soviet by force
in fi)J9, and Russia wants them back, and secondly,
they would make a good national home for Ar
menians.
However, Kars and Adrahan were actually hand
ed over after a plebiscite in which the inhabitants
voted overwhelmingly to go with Turkey, and there
is not a single Armenian in either of the provinces.
Dispute Significance
Vet this dispute, which is causing Turkey to keep

her arms ready for anything, developed at the time
of (he Moscow Conference.
The provinces are strategically of little use, and
have little in the way of natural resources. It is
quite possible that Russian demands were simply
"bargaining talk" here.
Manchuria
But Manchuria is an entirely different situation.
Russia has been trying to incorporate it for years.
In fact, the Russo-Japanese war was entirely over
a sphere of influence in this region.
Russia first neutralized it in the 19U0's by taking
over Mongolia on its flank. Now she is demanding
half control of Manchurian industry, and Chinese
Communists are fighting to hold the rich northern
half of the province.
The fate of Manchuria is very definitely lined up
with our national defense. If Russia were to try a
trans-Pacific attack against us any time in the fu
ture, Vladivostock, being her best, developed Pacific
port, would have to be the basis of her effort. With
Manchuria in friendly hands, the use of Vladivo
stock would be very dangerous for Russia, but with
it thoroughly out of our control north of the
southern tip of the Maritime provinces, things
would be different.
It is for this reason that our statesmen should,
and are, worrying more about who has military
control of Manchuria than about Russia's Turkish
and Mediterranean claims.
It also seems we should work hard for a compro
mise that gives China military control of Man
churia, and Russia some economic advantages there.

But Kars and Adrahan have caused some dispute.
These are two provinces on the Russo-Turkish
border that have been Turkish most of the time,
but were ceded to Russia at the end of the Russo-
Turkish war in 1877-78.
H)I!> Settlement
'I he Turkish government has been releasing its
side of the story here through its embassy, and this
column was fortunate enough to obtain one of its
informative documents through Mr. Sorvet Duran,
a Turkish student.
'I he basic Russian case which has'not been put
forth officially but which was propounded in the
tightly controlled Moscow press, is that, first, Kars
and Adrahan were taken from the Soviet by force
in fi)J9, and Russia wants them back, and secondly,
they would make a good national home for Ar
menians.
However, Kars and Adrahan were actually hand
ed over after a plebiscite in which the inhabitants
voted overwhelmingly to go with Turkey, and there
is not a single Armenian in either of the provinces.
Dispute Significance
Vet this dispute, which is causing Turkey to keep

her arms ready for anything, developed at the time
of (he Moscow Conference.
The provinces are strategically of little use, and
have little in the way of natural resources. It is
quite possible that Russian demands were simply
"bargaining talk" here.
Manchuria
But Manchuria is an entirely different situation.
Russia has been trying to incorporate it for years.
In fact, the Russo-Japanese war was entirely over
a sphere of influence in this region.
Russia first neutralized it in the 19U0's by taking
over Mongolia on its flank. Now she is demanding
half control of Manchurian industry, and Chinese
Communists are fighting to hold the rich northern
half of the province.
The fate of Manchuria is very definitely lined up
with our national defense. If Russia were to try a
trans-Pacific attack against us any time in the fu
ture, Vladivostock, being her best, developed Pacific
port, would have to be the basis of her effort. With
Manchuria in friendly hands, the use of Vladivo
stock would be very dangerous for Russia, but with
it thoroughly out of our control north of the
southern tip of the Maritime provinces, things
would be different.
It is for this reason that our statesmen should,
and are, worrying more about who has military
control of Manchuria than about Russia's Turkish
and Mediterranean claims.
It also seems we should work hard for a compro
mise that gives China military control of Man
churia, and Russia some economic advantages there.
With Azerbaijan a lait accompli, there might be
two other areas of Russian expansion. The first is
Manchuria, where trouble is already developing,
and the second is eastern Turkey, and especially
Kars and Adrahan.
A large demand on Turkey, including the Black
Sea coast and the oil deposits there, would mean
war. Russia has little chance of getting her fists on
the Dardanelles as things .stand now.
