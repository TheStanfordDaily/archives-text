# Vote for Area Representation Plan---Say 5 Excom Members
## 
### 
Open letter to the Associated Stu
dents:
Today we strongly urge you to
vote lor the new A.S.S.U. consti
tution in its entirely, including
area representation.
In answer to Boh Kennedy's
letter in yesterday's Daily, we
agree with Mr. Kennedy that the
decisions of Excom should he
guided hy v a consideration of the
well-heing of the University as
a whole." This can he obtained
much more effectively by repre
sentative government with estab
lished channels for public opin
ion. Since we have compact liv
ing groups which are organized
mediums of expression, why not
take advantage of them? In this
way, the opinions of people from
all over campus can be brought
together to help form policies of
the A.S.S.U.
1. In the area plan we do not
believe that there is an unneces
sary duplication of women rep
resentatives. This plan provides
more direct contact between Ex
com and the students. The area
Excom member reaches the stu
dents through the house president
or individually. Whereas, through
the hierarchy of student to house
president to Women's Conference
chairman to Excom, the report
loses accuracy, force, and mean
ing.
2. When the campus returns to
a "state of normalcy," there will
he few changes of residence dur
ing the year. We feel that Ken
nedy has put unnecessary empha
sis on members moving out of
their areas.
'A. The class representative has

no practical means of finding out
the opinions of his constituents;
therefore, this representative bas
es his vote in Excom purely on
his own opinions and perhaps
those of his immediate friends.
But, through regular meetings,
the members of the area may ex
press their ideas to their repre
sentative.
4. The fact that (he Excom
member knows the opinions of
his area does not mean that he
will lose sight of the well-being
of Stanford as a "hole. This
added knowledge will only help
Excom to determine public opin
ion, not restrict the member's out
look and judgment.
5. Under the old constitution
there were no freshman repre
sentatives on Excom. Freshmen
are a vital part of the student
body and should be given a
chance to take an active part in
student government. There is a
freshman man and a freshman
woman elected each fall quarter
under the area plan.
(>. Voting within your area you
know your candidates personally.
7. The tendency in the past un
der the old plan has been that a
large number of Excom members
came from one small area of the
campus. The new constitution is
a guarantee against this.
For the above reasons we again
urge you to vote for No. 1, RATI
FICATION OF TIIE NEW CON
STITUTION with area represen
tation.

the opinions of his constituents;
therefore, this representative bas
es his vote in Excom purely on
his own opinions and perhaps
those of his immediate friends.
But, through regular meetings,
the members of the area may ex
press their ideas to their repre
sentative.
4. The fact that (he Excom
member knows the opinions of
his area does not mean that he
will lose sight of the well-being
of Stanford as a "hole. This
added knowledge will only help
Excom to determine public opin
ion, not restrict the member's out
look and judgment.
5. Under the old constitution
there were no freshman repre
sentatives on Excom. Freshmen
are a vital part of the student
body and should be given a
chance to take an active part in
student government. There is a
freshman man and a freshman
woman elected each fall quarter
under the area plan.
(>. Voting within your area you
know your candidates personally.
7. The tendency in the past un
der the old plan has been that a
large number of Excom members
came from one small area of the
campus. The new constitution is
a guarantee against this.
For the above reasons we again
urge you to vote for No. 1, RATI
FICATION OF TIIE NEW CON
STITUTION with area represen
tation.

Open letter to the Associated Stu
dents:
Today we strongly urge you to
vote lor the new A.S.S.U. consti
tution in its entirely, including
area representation.
In answer to Boh Kennedy's
letter in yesterday's Daily, we
agree with Mr. Kennedy that the
decisions of Excom should he
guided hy v a consideration of the
well-heing of the University as
a whole." This can he obtained
much more effectively by repre
sentative government with estab
lished channels for public opin
ion. Since we have compact liv
ing groups which are organized
mediums of expression, why not
take advantage of them? In this
way, the opinions of people from
all over campus can be brought
together to help form policies of
the A.S.S.U.
1. In the area plan we do not
believe that there is an unneces
sary duplication of women rep
resentatives. This plan provides
more direct contact between Ex
com and the students. The area
Excom member reaches the stu
dents through the house president
or individually. Whereas, through
the hierarchy of student to house
president to Women's Conference
chairman to Excom, the report
loses accuracy, force, and mean
ing.
2. When the campus returns to
a "state of normalcy," there will
he few changes of residence dur
ing the year. We feel that Ken
nedy has put unnecessary empha
sis on members moving out of
their areas.
'A. The class representative has

no practical means of finding out
the opinions of his constituents;
therefore, this representative bas
es his vote in Excom purely on
his own opinions and perhaps
those of his immediate friends.
But, through regular meetings,
the members of the area may ex
press their ideas to their repre
