# Powell Gets Praise For First Come-Back
## 
### 
MURDER, MY SWEET—now play
ing at the Menlo Theater
It is not often that we foam at the
! mouth in praise of a Hollywood
: commodity. Such is the case, how
| ever, with Dick Powell's first corne
| back film, "Murder, My Sweet,"
adapted from Raymond Chandler's
i bone-crushing novel, "Farewell, My
I Lovely."
| Violent View of Humanity
i "Murder, My Sweet" is a pene
! trating glance at a vicious, violent
part of humanity that has seldom
been screened before. In fact, it's
just about the ultimate in the blood
sex-and-rum school of cinemaking.
With a cast of almost incredibly
i tough characters, the film effective
ly pierces through any veneer of
decency that these individuals arc
supposed to possess.
The story, a complicated one
j al)out private detective, fake psy
j chiatjists, and sinuous women, takes
| place in that mecca of the famous,
I near-famous, and infamous, Los
Angeles. Dick Powell as the embit
i tered private detective, Philip Mar
j lowe, and Claire Trevor as a satiny
I Scotch drinker who almost wiggles
| her way into Powell's affections
I have no trouble in generating
i enough action to keep the party go
j ing at a fast clip.
Powell's Dope Dream
Mention should be made of Pow
ell's remarkable dope dream that
! far surpasses anything Ray Milland

ever had to go through. Instead of
bats and mice Powell sees a doctor
with a long hypodermic needle
chasing him.
If you didn't catch it the first time
around, stumble up Menlo Way to
night or tomorrow and see the new
vitamized Dick Powell. No longer is
he petting in the park or crooning
"Did You Ever See a Dream Walk
ing?" as he did back in the "Gold
Diggers of 1933" days.

full Of chiselers and penny-ante
crooks. It's about time for the Palo
Alto League of Decency to have
a vice crackdown.— Dick Bower

Powell's Dope Dream
Mention should be made of Pow
ell's remarkable dope dream that
! far surpasses anything Ray Milland

ever had to go through. Instead of
bats and mice Powell sees a doctor
with a long hypodermic needle
chasing him.
If you didn't catch it the first time
around, stumble up Menlo Way to
night or tomorrow and see the new
vitamized Dick Powell. No longer is
he petting in the park or crooning
"Did You Ever See a Dream Walk
ing?" as he did back in the "Gold
Diggers of 1933" days.
