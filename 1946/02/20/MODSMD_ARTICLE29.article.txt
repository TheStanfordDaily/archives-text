# Sensabaugh Reads Poetry of Housman
## 
### 
Reading chiefly from"The Shrop
shire Lad," George Sensabaugh, as
sociate professor of English, chose
selections from A. E. Housman that
showed the open and arrogant irony
of the English poet and scholar at
the poetry reading yesterday.
Housman drew upon classic writ
ers, much as the Cavalier poets did. I
Throughout Housman's work there i
is an exactness in threads of irony,
loneliness, and love for old places.
From"The Shropshire Lad" Mr. !
Sensabaugh read "1887"; "Loveliest J
of trees, the cherry now"; "The Re- !
cruit," on homesickness for Ludlow, }
Housman's home town; "Oh see how
thick the goldcup flowers"; "When
smoke stood up from Ludlow"; "On J
moonlit heath and lonesome bank." j
"When 1 was one and twenty";
"There passed the careless people,"
about the loneliness and homesick- |
ness so often felt by Housman; "To 1
an Athlete Dying Young," on the j
here today, gone tomorrow theme; ;
"Bredon Hill," on futile love.
Housman's cynical philosophy was

evident in the following two poems,
"The lads in the hundreds to Ludlow
come for the fair" and "Along the
field as we came by." In "Is my team
plowing?" there is a feeling of un
easiness, and"The New Mistress"
has a touch of patriotism.
Mr. Sensabaugh continued read
ing more of the short poems—"White
in the moon the long road lies"; "As
through the wild green hills of
Wyre"; "In my own shire, if I was
sad"; "The Merry Guide"; and"The
Immortal Part," all on loneliness
and the love of old place and na
ture.
There is cynical reminiscing in
"Think no more, lad, laugh, be
jolly"; and more loneliness in "Loi
tering with a vacant eye," in which
Housman talks to a statue. "The
True Lover," "Terrance, this is stu
pid stuff," and "There was a king
reigned in the East," were the last
three poems from"The Shropshire
Lad."
From "Last Poems" Mr. Sensa
baugh read "The Lancer"; '.'The laws
of God, the laws of man," which
shows Housman's individualism; and
the complex philosophic "Hell Gate."

Housman's home town; "Oh see how
thick the goldcup flowers"; "When
smoke stood up from Ludlow"; "On J
moonlit heath and lonesome bank." j
"When 1 was one and twenty";
"There passed the careless people,"
about the loneliness and homesick- |
ness so often felt by Housman; "To 1
an Athlete Dying Young," on the j
here today, gone tomorrow theme; ;
"Bredon Hill," on futile love.
Housman's cynical philosophy was

evident in the following two poems,
"The lads in the hundreds to Ludlow
come for the fair" and "Along the
field as we came by." In "Is my team
plowing?" there is a feeling of un
easiness, and"The New Mistress"
has a touch of patriotism.
Mr. Sensabaugh continued read
ing more of the short poems—"White
in the moon the long road lies"; "As
through the wild green hills of
Wyre"; "In my own shire, if I was
sad"; "The Merry Guide"; and"The
Immortal Part," all on loneliness
and the love of old place and na
ture.
There is cynical reminiscing in
"Think no more, lad, laugh, be
jolly"; and more loneliness in "Loi
tering with a vacant eye," in which
Housman talks to a statue. "The
True Lover," "Terrance, this is stu
pid stuff," and "There was a king
reigned in the East," were the last
three poems from"The Shropshire
Lad."
From "Last Poems" Mr. Sensa
baugh read "The Lancer"; '.'The laws
of God, the laws of man," which
shows Housman's individualism; and
the complex philosophic "Hell Gate."

Reading chiefly from"The Shrop
shire Lad," George Sensabaugh, as
sociate professor of English, chose
selections from A. E. Housman that
showed the open and arrogant irony
of the English poet and scholar at
the poetry reading yesterday.
Housman drew upon classic writ
ers, much as the Cavalier poets did. I
Throughout Housman's work there i
is an exactness in threads of irony,
loneliness, and love for old places.
