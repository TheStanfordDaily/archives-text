(Editor's note: This is the first
in a series of articles analyzing
the professional baseball scene.)
The trek has started!
Pro baseball stars, and once again
we can use that term without hesi
tation—are heading south and west
to start annual spring training for
what appears to be one of the out
standing seasons in the history of
the diamond sport.
Men of undoubted class are
starting the fight for positions
which, during the war period,
were filled by men past their
prime or unseasoned youngsters.
The quality of baseball that can
be expected this summer will be
so high that it is impossible to
compare it to that of the past five
years.
Add this to the fact that sports is
now rising to the zenith of its great
est boom and it will be obvious why

fans will jam ball parks from coast
to coast—even in poor baseball cit
ies like Philadelphia and St. Louis
—to watch the national pastime.
Everything appears to be similar
to post-war years in this first real
spring training season in half a dec
ade. The big names and camps are
in the warm climes of Florida.
Georgia, and California. But there
is one extremely noticeable differ
ence. It is not the bushers, the rank
outsiders, the hopefuls, who have
been leading the way to the camps
while the established stars remain
at home to dicker for a slightly
larger salary.
It's the important ones. No longer
are the .300 hitters and sharp field
ers holding out. The Joe DiMag
«ios and Hank Greenbergs are lead
ing the way to the south, anxious to
get into uniform and start the long
arduous road back to condition.
The ones who don't have to worry
about competition have to think of
their jobs. And don't think that the
free trip south isn't enticing.
Most ball clubs have reported
over 90 per cent of the contracts
have been returned . . . signed.
Few managers are worrying
about hold-outs this year. Men
like Billy Southworth and Joe
McCarthy are in a position to po
litely thumb their noses at any
player who thinks he's worth
more than the club offered him.
Top-flight players are departing
to the minors because they could
n't stand the terrific competition.
Witness what the lineup of the
San Francisco Seals might in
clude. Cliff Melton, only last
year a N.Y. Giant mainstay on the
mound, Joe Hoover, first - string
shortstop for a major part of the
season with the world-champion
Detroit Tigers, they are both in
hot competition for first - string
positions.
And not even brilliant performers
like Snuffy Stirnweiss and Joe
Gordon are certain of their posts,
for they will have to fight for the
keystone position on the N.Y. Yan
kee nine.
