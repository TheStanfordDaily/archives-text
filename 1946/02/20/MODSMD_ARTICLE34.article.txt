Since St. Mary's College—over Moraga Valley way—de
cided to return to baseball this season, numerous stories have
come out that Herman Wedermeyer, the football dynamo of
last fall, is even a better baseball player than he is a football
toter. Which would have to make him pretty good in the horse
hide business, for he is no slouch in the pigskin business. That
is agreed upon.
Johnny Vergez, former pilot for the Oakland professional club, j
has been signed to handle the collegiates hit and run depart
ment at the St. Mary's school. No championship team awaits !
him, but still he ought to develop a good team, even if Weder
meyer is the only player of any repute on the squad.
In the past, St. Mary's has been in the baseball conference
consisting of Stanford, UCLA, USC, Cal, and Santa Clara. No
definite schedule has been posted yet, nor is it known definitely
whether the outsiders, Santa Clara and St. Mary's, will' come ,
back into the fold again. Bift in all probability, the Farm will
have occasion to see the colorful Herman W. go through the I
baseball paces, if only it is a non-conference game.
No athlete has been heralded so much as Wedermeyer has
in the past year. His football ability is known to all. Pretty
soon we'll find out if his baseball prowess is as great as some j
claim. Besides that, he is reputed to be an excellent boxer; in
fact he debated last fall on whether to return to school, or to
turn to pro boxing as a means of livelihood.
Not since the hey-day of Jim Thorpe has there been such
"tub-thumping" for an athlete. In our opinion, however, it will
be a plenty long time before Thorpe's records are equaled. Not '
that the Hawaiian Herrn might not equal them, but we rather
doubt it.
Thorpe's exploits are well-known, so we won't go into them
at this time. We can't think of one sport that Indian Jim didn't
excel in. (We haven't checked on tiddley winks, though.)
California, which won the southern division of me PCC
basketball play, is now waiting to take on the winner of the '
northern division. Up north, at the present, there is a scramble j
for the top spot between Oregon State and Idaho. Either team j
ought to drub California without much trouble.
We would go so far as to say that even WSC, which cur
rently employs bottom place, could lick Califonia. Nftrthern
basketball is that good this season.
To let you in on a secret, we're rootin' for Idaho to take'
the conference lead up north. That school hasn't won any ;
sort of title in a millenium, and it's about time they came through. !
Then we can go up to Berkeley and watch the Vandals hand j
those urban sophisticates the beating of their life. Won't Nibs
Price work up a good case of nervous exasperation that night?
