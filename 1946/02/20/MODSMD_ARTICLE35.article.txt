## Card Five Ends Season 
### 
Stanford's Indians ring down the
curtain on the basketball season at
the Pavilion Friday night when
they play host to the University of
Santa Clara Broncos at the Pavilion.
One other game after Friday re
mains on the Indians' slate, next
Wednesday night at the S.F. Civic
Auditorium, when they deploy
against the University of San Fran
cisco Dons.
Thus comes to a close the most
dismal season, within the memory
of any student now in school, a
season that saw a brand new Car
dinal club take to the floor with
enough fight for any two teams
its size, hut not much else.
The Injuns will probably go
against the Broncs as slight under
dogs, largely because of the two
decisions the Santa Clarans hold
over the Dons, a team that tripped
the Indians earlier this season.
The Broncos also hold title to
what is probably the biggest up
set on the Pacific slope this sea
son. a ,'IK-.'{7 nod over Fleet City's
power - laden Bluejackets two
weeks ago. Fleet City proved it
was a fluke by soundly and
roundly shellacking (he Broncs
last Friday.
The Indians came through their
weekend series with the best per
formance they put on all season
against Cal's Southern Division
champion Bears in good shape.
They worked out last night and
again tonight and will taper off to
morrow before meeting the Bruins.
