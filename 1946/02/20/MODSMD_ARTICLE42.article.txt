# Inter-Class Races Feature Marathon
## 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
The lid blows off Stanford's 194 ft
track season, unofficially and in
formally, next Friday afternoon
when the Farm revives the Irish
marathon and interclass track meet
at Angell Field.
The last interclass meet was held
14 years ago, yesterday, and con
tained just about everything a le
gitimate track meet did, and in
cluded a lot of things that weren't
part of run of the mine track meets.
Practically all the track and field
events, everything from the 100-
ytfrd dash to the mile run and from
the shot put to the high jump, were
included in the program that came
to the untimely end on Feb. 19, 1932,
This year, however, the program
has been thinn?d down to the point
where the track and field events
have largely been eliminated, but
all the extra and added attractions
have been retained.
The piece de resistance for the
coming meet, however, will still be
the "Irish" marathon, which dates
from the earliest days of the Farm.
The term "Irish" stems from the
fact that the event used to take
place on St. Patrick's Day.the 17th
of March. When the track season
backed up to the beginning of
spring quarter, the interclass meet
moved into the winter term.
In the old days, the event was
featured by 24 men from each class
who ran 440 yards each, and was
open to all male students, including
the varsity. This year the event is
still open to all male students, in
cluding the varsity, but the dis
tance to be run has been cut to 220
yards for each man.
Two furlongs was considered

about twice as far as the average
out-of-shape student could run and
still hold onto his lunch, hence the
shortened distance.
Other events that were featured
in the traditional meet were spe
cialty races such as the three-leg
ged dash, the sack run, the back
ward sprint, the one-legged race, a
steeplechase stomp, and an obstacle
chase.
While plans for the coming meet
are still in the formative state, most
of the listed races will be included,
and it is probable that a number of
specialties not mentioned will be
included in the agenda.
Track Coach Jack Weiershauser
is in charge of the meet and will
announce team captains in the next
daj' or so.

The lid blows off Stanford's 194 ft
track season, unofficially and in
formally, next Friday afternoon
when the Farm revives the Irish
marathon and interclass track meet
at Angell Field.
The last interclass meet was held
14 years ago, yesterday, and con
tained just about everything a le
gitimate track meet did, and in
cluded a lot of things that weren't
part of run of the mine track meets.
Practically all the track and field
events, everything from the 100-
ytfrd dash to the mile run and from
the shot put to the high jump, were
included in the program that came
to the untimely end on Feb. 19, 1932,
This year, however, the program
has been thinn?d down to the point
where the track and field events
have largely been eliminated, but
all the extra and added attractions
have been retained.
The piece de resistance for the
coming meet, however, will still be
the "Irish" marathon, which dates
from the earliest days of the Farm.
The term "Irish" stems from the
fact that the event used to take
place on St. Patrick's Day.the 17th
of March. When the track season
backed up to the beginning of
spring quarter, the interclass meet
moved into the winter term.
In the old days, the event was
featured by 24 men from each class
who ran 440 yards each, and was
open to all male students, including
the varsity. This year the event is
still open to all male students, in
cluding the varsity, but the dis
tance to be run has been cut to 220
yards for each man.
Two furlongs was considered

about twice as far as the average
out-of-shape student could run and
still hold onto his lunch, hence the
shortened distance.
Other events that were featured
in the traditional meet were spe
cialty races such as the three-leg
ged dash, the sack run, the back
ward sprint, the one-legged race, a
steeplechase stomp, and an obstacle
chase.
While plans for the coming meet
are still in the formative state, most
of the listed races will be included,
and it is probable that a number of
specialties not mentioned will be
included in the agenda.
