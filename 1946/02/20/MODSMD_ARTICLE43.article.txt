### GEORGE ECKSTEIN LARRY FRANKLEY 
Black, Brown, and Beige
One of the most important musi
cal events of the year took place
last week with the appearance in
the stores of Duke Ellington's mas
terpiece, "Black, Brown, and
Beige." Issued by Victor Records,
this "tone parallel to the American
Negro" is presented in the form of
four 12 - inch sides, and it is
abridged considerably from the ori
ginal work as presented last year in
Carnegie Hall.
Lift That Bale!
The first part is called the "Work
Song," which describes the Negro in
his first phase of American life. His
working in the cotton fields, in road
gangs, and struggle for survival are
all described by the orchestra with
fine solos by Harry Carney on bari
tone and Joe "Tricky Sam" Nanton
on trombone.
Johnny Gets Religion
The second part is entitled "Come
Sunday," and it is a description of
the Negro's religious and spiritual
life. Opening with Ray Nance on
violin, it follows through with a
long, beautiful, and prayerful solo
by Johnny Hodges on his expres
sive alto. The movement closes as

[ quietly as the church service that it
describes. These first two parts com
pose the "Black" of the B, B, and B.
The Blues Ain't Nuthin'—Much!
The "Brown" of the composition
describes the Blues and is quite ap
propriately entitled "Blues." It fea
tures Joya Sherrill singing "The
Blues Ain't Nuthin'," followed by
A 1 Sears' tenor. This solo, by the
way, is one of the most noteworthy
items in the album. The number
portrays the blues pattern and form,
and it is an expression of melan
choly, which is in reality what the
Blues is supposed to represent. The
rest of the "Brown" is the feeling
that the Duke has for the Negro's
participation in various wars and
historical events. It opens with a
"West Indian Dance," which is a
rhumba-like number in tribute to
the extensive West Indian influence
on the Negro, and the migration of
a great number of Negroes from the
Bahamas, Puerto Rico, and Jamaica.
This dance features Ellington on
piano, Taft Jordan on trumpet, and
"Tricky Sam" playing trom in uni
son with two trumpets. The second
dance describes the Emancipation
Proclamation which freed the Ne
gro, and it is a vigorous expression
of liberation. Rex Stewart and Nan
ton proclaim the exuberance felt by
the youth while a baritone and ten
or duet close the movement de
scribing the emotions felt by an
aged Negro couple when they are
suddenly told. "You are free!"
Last and Least
The '"Beige" is denoted by a short
portion at the end of the last side.
Called "Sugar Hill Penthouse," this
dreamy number is highlighted by
Harry Carney's clarinet leading the
reed section. The "Beige" is sup
posed to represent the Negro's po
sition during the interval between
the two wars and up to the present
time. It is so short on record, be
cause the actual composition had
to be cut more than 50 per cent be
fore Victor would cut it. Originally
45 minutes long, B, B, and B now
lasts approximately 18 minutes.
Is It Jazz?
After listening to the composition
once or twice, we were struck by
its beauty and expressive quality—
but there is one catch! Is this jazz?
Surely it is Duke's feeling toward
the problem, but do the men who
play it feel the same way? Did El
lington direct the solos? If he did,
can this be classified as jazz? Of
course, one's definition of jazz plays
a considerable part in this decision,
but it is generally agreed that jazz
is an individual expression, and also
the part that spontaneity plays can
not be overlooked. How can Joya
Sherrill sing the real Blues when
she does not feel blue at the time?
Perhaps we are going astray, but
this is a very involved topic. John
ny Hodges' solo was perhaps the
most individual in that to us it more
clearly expresses his own feelings
rather than the Duke's.
Frankly Confused
This album most certainly puts
jazz in a tangible position, but, per
haps, this is not meant for jazz.
Above all jazz must be an individ
ual and spontaneous expression.
Therefore, this "Black, Brown, and
Beige" presents a considerable
problem as to whether this is what
jazz is supposed to be, or whether
Duke has branched out from the
original idea and is off on a tan
gent. Quite frankly, we are con
fused! How about some ideas from
you?
