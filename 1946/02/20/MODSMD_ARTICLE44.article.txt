| Recent events in China prompted
| the United States House Naval Af
| fairs Committee on Feb. 11 to in
j troduce legislation proposing the
j lending to China of part of our
| navy, principally battleships and de
stroyer escorts, according to Mur
! ray N. Wortzel, Stanford senior, who
j spoke before the Chinese Affairs
Discussion Group Monday after
noon. The purpose of this transfer
of naval power is to facilitate the
demobilization of the Chinese army.
In presenting a digest of recent
; current events in China, Mr. Wort
i zel also pointed out that on Feb. 10
| eastern Inner Mongolia was de
clared to be independent of China.
The freedom of Outer Mongolia had
already been recognized by Chiang
Kai-shek, leader of China's leading
i party, the Kuomintang.
He also said that while agree
j ments have been made to restore
; communications in Northern and
Central China, to remove mines, re
[ build war-devastated roads and re-
J store postal service, the situation in
] Manchuria is still unimproved. One
| of the Manchurian newspapers re
cently launched an attack on Rus
sian policy in China. Soviet troops
!in Manchuria were expected to
j leave Feb. 1, but now it appears
that they will not leave until June
1. Mr. Wortzel said that Russian
i demands on China are for Sino-So
| viet economic co-operation in Man
churia, the right of Russians to es
tablish domiciles, to travel and to
'buy property in Manchuria, and the
j right to control inland navigation.
Following Mr. WortzeFs news di
gest, C. Margaret Carter spoke on
| "China's 1936 Draft Constitution."
The history of the constitution
' can be traced back to 1895, but it
: was not until 1905 that a special
commission was sent to the United
j States and Europe to study various
political systems.
In 1928 the Program of Political
J Tutelage incorporated the ideas of
the political constitution of Nine
teen Articles proposed in 1911. This
was an attempt to put these articles
into actual practice and evolve a
workable constitution. In 1932 it

was proposed that the Legislative
Yuan, or branch, of the Chinese
government start immediately to
take measures for the preparation
of a draft constitution.
Miss Carter continued, saying that
the ideas which the Yuan worked
out were adopted in 1934 and re
leased for public criticism. After
receiving 281 critical dissertations,
the final draft constitution, consist
ing of 107 articles and eight chap
ters, was published by the National
Government on May 5, 1936.
The 1936 constitution provided for
freedom of speech, religion, writing,
publication, and the right of assem
bly. The government is divided into
the Legislative Yuan, the Execu
tive Yuan, the Control Yuan, and
Judicial Yuan, and the Examination
Yuan. The president of China holds
office for a term of six years and
may be re-elected.
A permanent constitution will be
adopted May 5, 1946, following the
adoption of amendments that have
been suggested for the revision of
the draft constitution. Some of the
suggestions were that the Legisla
tive and Control Yuans be organized
similarly to the House and Senate
of the United States government
and that only the Legislative Yuan
be given the power to introduce
bills.
Miss Carter stated that the pur
pose underlying the revisions of the
constitution is to work the govern
ment into a more democratic form.
Following the speakers was a
short question period.
