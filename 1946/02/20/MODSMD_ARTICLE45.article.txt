# Library of Congress-- No Subject Neglected
## 
### 
Lewis Hanke. educator and author, told his Tuesday Evening Series
audience last night that the Library of Congress has a future because it has
a present and a past. Thomas Jefferson, president when the library was
formed by a $5,000 appropriation to buy books, stressed the importance
of a source of information for congressmen savinu, "There is no subject to

which a member of Congress may
not have an occasion to refer."
Since that time, the library has
grown to the size of 8,000,000 vol
umes, 15,000,000 films, pictures, and
pamphlets, 1,500 employees, 400 miles
of steel shelves, and an annual budg
et of $5,000,000. The success and
growth of the library has been ac
complished not only by the support
of Congress, but also by the leader
ship of strong libraries, the speaker
stated.
There are three aspects of the de
velopment of the library, Dr. Hanke
explained:
They include its development with
respect to Congress, what it. will
mean to the nation, and the role it
may play in international affairs.
Congressmen, Dr. Hanke pointed
out, are under constant pressure by
groups of all types of experts. A
congressman may have to make
statements or speeches on practically
any subject. The Library of Con
gress provides a bureau of experts to
provide the needed information in
concise, usable form. These experts
are professors or other experts with
wide knowledge and experience.
There is now an adviser on foreign
affairs, taxation, law, and labor.
If this service division of the Li
brary gets the funds it needs, experts
will be provided to advise and in
form congressmen on each of the
fundamental committees in Con
gress. These experts are well known
for their unbiased reports to both
parties. Another little-known serv
ice of the national library, Hanke
stated, is the facilities that are made
available to the adult blind in this
country. Any blind person can get a
list of recordings, which will enable
them to profit from all types of lit
erature available to them upon ap
plication.
One of the future developments
which is being worked out is the
expansion of film collection. The Li
brary is adding to the collection
which now includes 7,000,000 feet of
captured German, Italian, and Jap
anese film, pictures which are rep
resentative of American thought and
idea. "One can easily sec," stated
Hanke, "how valuable this material
will be to future historians."
There is a bill before Congress
now for appropriations to build a
special film building.
