### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 19 (UP).â€”
The House Blinking Committee to
day decided to summon Henry Ford
11, young president of the Ford Mo
tor Compnny, to present his views
on price controls after Price Ad
ministrator Chester Bowles charged
that he had demanded an "outra
geous increase" of 55 per cent in
car prices.
Bowles, making his second ap
pearance at hearings on extension
of the price act beyond June 30,
said Ford had made many "irre
sponsible statements" and the in
crease he asked for "should ex
plain why he is so eager to get rid
of price control."
