# 'Daily' News Bias Alleged
## 
### 
A.S.S.U. President Bob Kennedy
charged the Daily with biased re
porting on the constitution vote at
Excom last night, saying it has been
prejudiced, since last fall quarter,
in favor of area representation.
"News stories should be confined
to the reporting of facts, and prej
udices of reporters should be ex
cluded," he said. Opinions of mem
bers of Editorial Board belong in
the edit columns, and in their place
arc the responsibility of the news
paper, he added.
He and many other students felt
that yesterday's issue of the Daily
was unfair, since the "ears" read
"Vote Yes on Number 1," the edi
torial favoring the area plan was
placed in a central spot on page
one, and the "pro" story was longer
and more complete than the "con"
story. No "cons" whatever were
presented until his letter was
printed in Tuesday's paper, he said.
Editor Nada Skid more replied
that editorial policy always and
necessarily must affect the news
columns of the paper, through the
number of inches given to certain
stories, the position they hold on the
page, and the size of the headline
they are given. The paper's charter
reads, "The editor shall have entire
control of the editorial policies of
the Stanford Daily."
Daily members present felt that
it was the duty of any newspaper
to study controversial issues, come
to a decision as to which side is
better, and present that decision to
its readers.
Barbara Soaver recommended that
future Excoms take it upon them
selves to educate the campus on
important issues, and if they wish
to take a definite stand to present
their case in a forum or in talks at
living groups.
The Union Board of Directors,
upon completing a survey of prices
in Palo Alto establishments com
parable to the Cellar, asked that a
similar student study be made to
satisfy any feeling that prices at the
Cellar are too high. Excom mem
bers will inquire in their areas if
any students wish to continue the
survey, to compare quantity, qual
ity, and prices of foods.
Date of the Rise Stevens concert
will be changed to June 3, Monday
of dead week, according to Excom's
vote. The concert, for which many
students have already paid in their
season tickets, would otherwise
have been canceled.
11. D. Thoreau was appointed edi
tor of the Frosh Bible, which will
be revised to represent campus con
ditions in '46.
