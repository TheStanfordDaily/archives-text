LONDON, Feb. 20 (UP).—Harold"
MacMillan, veteran Conservaitve
diplomat, asserted in the House of
Commons today that the American-
British-Russian alliance had fallen
apart and that relations of the Big
Three powers were "greally—even
alarmingly—strained."
Unless good relations are restored
between Russia and the Western
Aliies, MacMillan said, Germany
will logically bccome again a men
ace to the peace of the world.
Demanding resumption of direct
negotiations along the lines of the
wartime conferences of President
Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and
Marshal Josef Stalin, MacMillan
said that if present disagreement
between the eastern and western
7.011 cs in Germany were not ended:
"Germany, now cast down, de
spised and shunned like an unclean
thing, will oncc more be courted by
each of two groups and from a
starving outcast she will become the
pampered pet of Europe, selling her
favors to the highest bidding.

LONDON, Feb. 20 (UP).—Russia
admitted tonight that members of
its military start had obtained secret
information in Canada, including
data on atomic energy and radar,
but said the information was of no
value. She charged that Canada's
attitude in the matter was anti-So
viet and "incompatible with normal
relations."
Moscow radio, broadcasting a
statement which it said had been
handed to the Canadian diplomatic
representative there, said that Col.
Nicolai Zabotin, Russian military
attache in Ottawa, had been re
called because some members of his
staff were involved.
Russia's statement, angry in tone
throughout, charged that there was
an "unbridled" campaign against
Russia in the Canadian press and on
the Canadian radio, and that the
Canadian government encouraged
the campaign.
