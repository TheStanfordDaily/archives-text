# Brotherhood, You Say

One week in 1946—the week of Washing
ton's Eirthday —has been set aside for the
observance of National Brotherhood, seven
days in which the National Conference of
Christians and Jews are campaigning for
abolition of race, religious, and war-fostered
prejudice.
The newspapers have carried charming
photographs of Negro and white schoolchil
dren playing together, posters and radio
talks have depicted "teamwork" of all peo
ples in this, our postwar world of controlled
peace and good will.
Yet newscasters and press wires carry
other stories of segregation of Mexican stu

dents in California schoolrooms, of the de
nial of a room in San Francisco to a man who
was a Filipino, of a group of Negro minis
ters who feel compelled to protest the prej
udice of Senator Bilbo on the Fair Employ
ment Bill.
And so one week is not enough. One
week presents an ironic display of another
group—perhaps a minority, too — that is
bravely fighting for an ideal that as yet does
not exist. Only a year round practice of
"tolerance" and a one-by-one conversion of
American citizens will effect the spirit of in
ternational teamwork on which our peace
must be founded.—BMV
