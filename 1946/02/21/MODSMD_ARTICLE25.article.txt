### H.D. TUOREAU 
Am instructor was trying to emphasize a point
by bringing in a practical example. He was using a
situation in the Army Air Forces (rah) at a con
trol tower where men are plotting locations and
courses. lie came to a point where he wished to
mention the action taken by one of the plotters but
rouH not bring the correct nomenclature to mind:
"One of these . . . ah . . . erah . .
A small but helpful voice from the proverbial
rear of the classroom queried, "Soldiers?"

We have it on the word of M. A. Edwards, the
editor, that the 194(5 Quad will definitely come out
in '4(i an 1 probably in June of that year. He stated
thai while th" idea of having the yearbook come
out in November of the following school year was
novel, it wasn't a stable tradition to establish,
* * *
In 1942 we didn't have any ants. Perhaps during
ihe war years when registration was down the
University decided to let in a certain number of
ants to fill up the living groups.
If that was the case, we feel that things are
back to normal now and the school shovdd ask
the ants to leave. Either that or make them all
move to Encina.
Quoting Ihe Stanford Daily, February If), page
three:
"Bishop scored 52 points in two games against
On con last week, but otherwise has not looked
very £ood."
There's a tall blond fellow who's only scored 4
points all season, but he's awfully good-looking.

Quoting the Stanford Daily, February 20, page
one, column one:
"Debaters Win West Tourney." "Farm Is Un
defeated." ". . . the final standings read . . . Stan
ford, third." "Stanford ranked second ..."
Yes, but how did Stanford's debaters come out?

We would like to pause here to mention that
