housing
The full story of the housing shortage is coming
out more and more.
The reasons given at the beginning of the pres
sure for more housing are only part of it. True,
there has been a gigantic increase in the number
of families, and, true, there have been no new
houses during the war. But there is more to it.
I I YIBKR CEILINGS
Lumber being sent abroad has no ceiling price,
and there is a terrific demand for it there. Lum
ber sold here is under rigid price control. Because
of this condition, most of our wood is going into the
export market instead of into new American homes.
The remedy is obvious.
But also, the prices on raw materials for hous
ing are not in line with the price ceilings on the
finished product and its parts. For instance, floor
board ceilings are lower than the cost of the lum
ber to make them, so no floorboards are being
milled.
Yet, if we increased price ceilings on housing,
it would cost too much to be a solution to many
people.
Politicians don't seem inclined to force a cut in
lumbermen's wages. That would help, but it could
mean an organized pressure group that is too badly
ruffled.
SUBSIDIES
One possible way out would be government
subsidies for housing. But this would mean more
government credits in a market bloated with them,
and more inflation.
Also, passing it would be a confession by the
government of failure in the house price ceiling
program.
Indeed, one of the faults of the housing situa
tion is that it is necessarily mixed up in politics.
Perhaps the cost could be cut down somewhat,

though, if building methods were more mechanized.
This doesn't mean prefabrication, which is still
in the experimental stage, and has quite a lot of
kinks in it yet.
But, d ul 'ing the depression, the housing unions
have forced the building industry to stick to ar
chaic, slow, and expensive production methods in
order to keep more people employed.
RESTRICTIONS
These restrictions should be lifted. They do not
work at any time.
During prosperity, people tend to buy more
houses. The cheaper the houses, the more people
who buy them, and the net effect is high employ
ment of building tradesmen.
During a depression, people cut their housing
costs as much as possible. They rent cheap rooms
and double up with other people. If the labor cost
of house building is high, the effect becomes even
worse, and while more laborers are employed on
individual jobs, the overall construction employ
ment picture is the same.
The housing situation has extreme drawbacks
and kinks. There are a few obvious things that
could be done ,but there are economic ramifications
that might be unpleasant to any overall solution
of the picture.
The cost of plenty of low-price housing will be
great to the government and the whole people, but
very definitely one of the things holding up a solu
tion is preoccupation and vacillation by the govern
ment.
Right now. Congress, through subsidy legisla
tion and restrictions on the building unions, can do
something, and it is the only body that can. Per
haps the best way to speed housing is to become
very active in your correspondence with your Con
gressman.

I I YIBKR CEILINGS
Lumber being sent abroad has no ceiling price,
and there is a terrific demand for it there. Lum
ber sold here is under rigid price control. Because
of this condition, most of our wood is going into the
export market instead of into new American homes.
The remedy is obvious.
But also, the prices on raw materials for hous
ing are not in line with the price ceilings on the
finished product and its parts. For instance, floor
board ceilings are lower than the cost of the lum
ber to make them, so no floorboards are being
milled.
Yet, if we increased price ceilings on housing,
it would cost too much to be a solution to many
people.
Politicians don't seem inclined to force a cut in
lumbermen's wages. That would help, but it could
mean an organized pressure group that is too badly
ruffled.
SUBSIDIES
One possible way out would be government
subsidies for housing. But this would mean more
government credits in a market bloated with them,
and more inflation.
Also, passing it would be a confession by the
government of failure in the house price ceiling
program.
Indeed, one of the faults of the housing situa
tion is that it is necessarily mixed up in politics.
Perhaps the cost could be cut down somewhat,

though, if building methods were more mechanized.
This doesn't mean prefabrication, which is still
in the experimental stage, and has quite a lot of
kinks in it yet.
But, d ul 'ing the depression, the housing unions
have forced the building industry to stick to ar
chaic, slow, and expensive production methods in
order to keep more people employed.
RESTRICTIONS
These restrictions should be lifted. They do not
work at any time.
During prosperity, people tend to buy more
houses. The cheaper the houses, the more people
who buy them, and the net effect is high employ
ment of building tradesmen.
During a depression, people cut their housing
costs as much as possible. They rent cheap rooms
and double up with other people. If the labor cost
of house building is high, the effect becomes even
worse, and while more laborers are employed on
individual jobs, the overall construction employ
ment picture is the same.
The housing situation has extreme drawbacks
and kinks. There are a few obvious things that
could be done ,but there are economic ramifications
that might be unpleasant to any overall solution
of the picture.
The cost of plenty of low-price housing will be
great to the government and the whole people, but
very definitely one of the things holding up a solu
tion is preoccupation and vacillation by the govern
ment.
Right now. Congress, through subsidy legisla
tion and restrictions on the building unions, can do
something, and it is the only body that can. Per
haps the best way to speed housing is to become
very active in your correspondence with your Con
gressman.
housing
The full story of the housing shortage is coming
out more and more.
The reasons given at the beginning of the pres
sure for more housing are only part of it. True,
there has been a gigantic increase in the number
of families, and, true, there have been no new
houses during the war. But there is more to it.
