# Vocom Speakers Stress Positions in Social Field
## 
### 
Many positions are open and will
b? in the future in the field of so
cial work, according to Miss Mary
Duran, a psychiatric social worker,
who spoke at the Vocom meeting
last night.
The subject of the meeting was
"You Can Help in Social Work." All
of the four speakers agreed that so
cial workers are not well paid. A
person must enter the field because
he wants to do the work and not
because of the financial benefits.
Psychiatry . . .
Miss Duran, who is from the'
Child Guidance Clinic in San Fran
cisco, outlined her duties and the
requirements for entrance into the
field of psychiatric social workers.
The requirements are: graduation
from an approved college and a
year's experience in a clinic.
This type of social worker has
the most opportunities and the best
pay. The work is particularly ex
citing and interesting, because the
work is done jointly in a clinic. The
worker is responsible for collecting
material about the patients, being
an expert as to the recreational and
vocational resources of the commu
nity, and working directly with the
persons close to the patient.
. . . and Delinquency
The second speaker of the eve
ning was Mrs. Rogaway, who is a
welfare officer in the Palo Alto Po
lice Department. Her work con
sists mostly of the prevention and
treatment of juvenile delinquency.
Prevention is achieved through
work with various community or
ganizations such as the Boy and
Girl Scouts. I
There are many openings for
workers in the probation cases. The
preparations for entrance into this
field are: an interest in people, the
ability to get along with people,
training, and experience. The
worker must discover the causes of
delinquency and figure out reme
dies.
Welfare Work
The last speaker, was Mr. Hugh
Hinman, a former Stanford student.
Last year he worked in Germany
on welfare relief of the German
population and repatriation of dis
placed persons. lie emphasized the

need for welfare work here in the !
United iSates.
Mr. Hinman is now a public as
sistance worker in the Santa Clara
County Welfare Department. The
requirements for entrance into this
position are: a college education
with a major in social sciences, one
year of graduate work, and one
year of work in the field. The du
ties consist of checking on the
claims and status of people apply
ing for relief.
Fellowships
About half of the work is clerical !
work in the o/Tice and the other j
half is work in the field checking |
on cases.
In the discussion after the speech
es Miss Duran spoke of the great
field for women psychiatrists, and
she emphasized the fact that many
fellowships are available for psy
chiatrists and psychiatric social
workers.
