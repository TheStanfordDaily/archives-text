# Forum Hears Debate on UNO Atomic Control Commission
## 
### 
Charlie Clark, president of the j
Stanford Student Association for
"Atomic Control, opened the town
hall meeting last night by introduc
ing Paul Kirkpatrick, professor of
physics.
Dr. Kirkpatrick gave a short j
speech on the importance of having
control of the atomic bomb. This
control is hard and a difficult prob
lem, He said, which must be solved.
The subject of the debate was the
question, "Is the present. UNO atom
ic Control Commission the best
working solution for the control of
atomic energy?" Eugene Stalcy, lec
turer in international trade, and
Bob Vallier, returned veteran and
member of the debate team, upheld
the affirmative side. Samuel D.
Thurman, associate professor of law,
and Wallace McCali, recent winner
at the Denver tournament, spoke
for the negative.
There arc two big problems which j
must be solved in the world of to- |
day, declared Mr. Stalcy. The first j
is the control of atomic energy; the
second is the economic and politi
cal problem involved in that control.

The UNO commission was set up
for the following reasons: (1) basic
security, (2) control of armaments,
(3) effective safeguards by way of
inspection. Members of the Security
Council and Canada arc represented.
The negative stated that the atomic
commission was ineffective as it now
exists because of the force of the
veto power. At present it docs not
even have a working solution be
cause the committee has no power.
Mr. Thurman summarized the two
cases by saying that the only salva
tion of the world is to have a world
government. The drawing line rests
between the perfectionists and the
realists. The perfectionists, said Mr.
Thurman, are those who say that
there must be an immediate common
government. The realists are those
who agree but who say that this
achievement must come about in
slow steps.
An all-campus poll, directed by
Ed Ornitz, will be made on Wednes
day, Feb. 26, in order to get the stu
dents' opinions regarding the control
of atomic energy.
