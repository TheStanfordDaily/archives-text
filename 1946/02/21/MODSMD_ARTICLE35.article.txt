Basketball' makes its last appearance in the Pavilion this Fri
day night when Everett Dean's cagers meet the visiting hoop
men from Santa Clara. Our last game is next Wednesday night,
when the team goes up to San Francisco to play the USF Dons
in a return engagement.
Friday's game is strictly a toss-up, with Stanford possibly
having the edge. The Broncos' record is better than Stanford,
but then they haven't run into the competition the Indians have.
George Barsi's lads (he's the Santa Clara basketball coach)
have about the same story to tell as have Dean's basketball
sguad. Starting out from scratch, without any lettermen, the team
has crept along, getting better as more experience was tucked
under their belts. Their basketball chances, like ours, lie more
in the future than this season.
This year the cornerstone was laid, so to speak. Next year the
edifice will be constructed.
As has been mentioned before, Stanford ought to produce
one of the finest basketball teams in its history. And that's say
ing a lot, for some mighty fine teams have been turned out at
the Farm.
Without any hesitation, this writer goes on record as saying
that Stanford will win the southern division basketball crown.
We'll also hazard a guess that UCLA will wind up in second
place; USC in third place; and Cal in the bottom slot.
The Bruins will have Chuck Clustka back, along with Don
Barksdale, who's considered one of the finest hoopsters on the
coast. Those two should form a good nucleus for a good team,
despite the fact that UCLA has the reputation for turning out
mediocre outfits in basketball. (And you can add all other sports
to that list, also, if you wish.)
USC always shows up with something pretty good in the
way of athletics. Kloppenburg will be around, if the Army
doesn't nab him. Jack Nichols, lanky center, disappears from the
Trojan campus, but there ought to be somebody around to fill
his spot.
Cal loses Merv LaFaille, who in the opinion of the sports
staff of the Daily, is a better player than Andy Wolfe, who takes
high point honors this season for the southern half of the confer
ence. Andrew W. returns to the sguad, and a few of the other
first-string men will be out there dribbling for Nibs Price, but all
other teams ought to outrank them next season.

first-string men will be out there dribbling for Nibs Price, but all
other teams ought to outrank them next season.
Basketball' makes its last appearance in the Pavilion this Fri
day night when Everett Dean's cagers meet the visiting hoop
men from Santa Clara. Our last game is next Wednesday night,
when the team goes up to San Francisco to play the USF Dons
in a return engagement.
Friday's game is strictly a toss-up, with Stanford possibly
having the edge. The Broncos' record is better than Stanford,
but then they haven't run into the competition the Indians have.
George Barsi's lads (he's the Santa Clara basketball coach)
have about the same story to tell as have Dean's basketball
sguad. Starting out from scratch, without any lettermen, the team
has crept along, getting better as more experience was tucked
under their belts. Their basketball chances, like ours, lie more
in the future than this season.
This year the cornerstone was laid, so to speak. Next year the
edifice will be constructed.
As has been mentioned before, Stanford ought to produce
one of the finest basketball teams in its history. And that's say
ing a lot, for some mighty fine teams have been turned out at
the Farm.
Without any hesitation, this writer goes on record as saying
that Stanford will win the southern division basketball crown.
We'll also hazard a guess that UCLA will wind up in second
place; USC in third place; and Cal in the bottom slot.
The Bruins will have Chuck Clustka back, along with Don
Barksdale, who's considered one of the finest hoopsters on the
coast. Those two should form a good nucleus for a good team,
despite the fact that UCLA has the reputation for turning out
mediocre outfits in basketball. (And you can add all other sports
to that list, also, if you wish.)
USC always shows up with something pretty good in the
way of athletics. Kloppenburg will be around, if the Army
doesn't nab him. Jack Nichols, lanky center, disappears from the
Trojan campus, but there ought to be somebody around to fill
his spot.
Cal loses Merv LaFaille, who in the opinion of the sports
staff of the Daily, is a better player than Andy Wolfe, who takes
high point honors this season for the southern half of the confer
ence. Andrew W. returns to the sguad, and a few of the other
first-string men will be out there dribbling for Nibs Price, but all
other teams ought to outrank them next season.
