# Farm Opposes Olympic Club
## 
### 
In its initial appearance of the
year, the Stanford gymnasts held
an informal get-together with the
Olympic Club from up San Fran
cisco way last night in the appara
tus room of the Encina gym. While
in no way comparing with the ex
perienced Winged "O" outfit, the
Redmen looked good in their first
start.
With a large crowd on hand, the
musclemen from both squads went
through the paces on the varied ap
paratus. Starting with the high bar,
the squads continued with their
routines on the rings, parallel bars,
side horse, and long horse.
Several men showed to advantage
on the high bars. Warren Stewart
of the Stantford ensemble looked
particularly flashy. Of course the
veterans of the Olympic Club all
performed on a high caliber. Espe
cially drawing a nice applause from
those assembled were John Gard
ner and Harry Jozifek, who pre
sented very smooth maneuvers.
On the rings, Bob Ainsworth, a
local product, showed championship
caliber throughout his work. Show
ing nice dislocations and inlocations
(terms used in special manipula
tions on the rings), Ainsworth
promises to be one of the bulwarks
of the Stanford Redmen. Of course
the Olympic men performed nicely
too. The star performer was Rudy
Illing, who garnered the bunting on
the flying rings from 1918 to 1938 in
A.A.U. Pacific Association compe
tition. Stewart also did some nice
overhead somersaults off the rings.
Working on the tricky side horse,
Don Paul and Bill Van Dorn
showed to good advantage. In an
event that demands smooth hand
dexterity, the San Franciscans tu
tored the Redmen in the fine art of
body movement. Once aagin Harry
Jozifek, John Gardner, and Rudy
Illing starred on the horse activities.
In the last event of the evening
festivities, the Atlasmen showed
their wares on the parallel bars.
Don Beverforden, Olympic Clubber
who was 1930 champion U.S.C. par
allel man, put on a fine exhibition.
Ward Chennel. Warren Stewart, and
Bill Van Dorn looked like fine po
tentialities in this strong - armed
event.
Undoubtedly the Stanford squad
gained valuable information and
experiences in this informal meet
ing and should develop into a squad
ready to venture in the intercolle
giate gymnastic wars.
