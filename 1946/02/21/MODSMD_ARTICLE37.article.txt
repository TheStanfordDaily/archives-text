SAN FRANCISCO. Feb. 20 (UP).
| — Decision of the International
Olympic Committee to eliminate
! the Germans and Japanese from
i competition in the 1948 games in
London apparently isn't going to
meet with much approval from the
men who participate and work in
this worldwide sports meet.
This department called upon
three widely known experts —
men who have either competed
or coached in the Olympic Gaines
—and came away with the unani
mous opinion that the defeated
nations should he allowed to en
ter.
"It looks as if the brass hats on
! the Olympic Committee have boot
!ed another one," says Emerson
(Bud) Spencer, sports editor of the
San Francisco News, one - time
holder of the world's record for the
I 400 - meter run and a member of
the 1928 U.S. Olympic team.
"The Olympic Games were
formed to increase understanding
! among nations, and I can't see how
this effort will be further enhanced
by our leaving out the Germans and
I Japanese."
Brutus K. Hamilton, track coach
at the University of California and
just out of the navy after a long
i hitch, is even more emphatic.
"If the 'guys who were going to
compete in the Olympics were
diplomats and politicians," opines
Hamilton, "then I'd say keep 'em
off the field or we'd have another
! major league squabble for sure."
Hamilton, who should know be
\ cause he did more than his share
of the fighting, said there were no
persons quite so willing to cancel a
quarrel as the young men who took
j part in the last one.
"And these same young men
will be wearing the gyni suits in
London" lie emnhasi/ed. "If it
were left to a vote of the athletes
who participate in the Olympics,
Japan and Germany would be al
lowed to compete."
Dink Templeton, former coach at
Stanford and (incidentally) Bud
| Spencer's track mentor, is of the
same opinion.
"Bring back the international
sports competition. There isn't go
ing to be a war caused by letting
the Germans or Japanese compete
j in the Olympics.
"As a matter of fact," says Dink,
"there is no better way to learn to
, understand each other than to corn
| pete in sports.
"I believe the Olympic heads are
; making a mistake by taking the at
! titude that wo should ban the late
enemy from international athletics."
