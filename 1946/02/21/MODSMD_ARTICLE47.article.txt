### SMILEY FARKAS 
Basketball at the Pavilion grinds
to a halt tomorrow night when the !
Stanford Indians turn in their final |
performance of the season on the :
Farm against Santa Clara's Bron- i
cos.
The finale for "4(! for Coach Ev
erett Dean and the Injuns will j
he staged on a foreign field Wed
nesday night when they invade
San Francisco to clash with the
U.S.F. Dons at the Civic Audi- !
toriuni.
Despite the bleakness of the Car
dinal record for the year, Coach
Dean si ill harbors hopes, and right
fully so, of winding up the cam
paign with what would be a blaze
of glory for the Indians.
The Santa Clara record is not
much better than that of the lo
cals. the Broncs having won six
and lost five. Teams beaten in
clude San Bruno Navy, Athens
Club, and $.F. Marines: losses be
ing administered by Cal. MolVett
Fjeld, Olympic Club, and St. Ma
ry's.
Top man for the small fast Bron
cos is George Nichols, a stocky for
ward with 89 points. Nichols teams
up with Bill Ahern, who has tallied
68 points so far this season.
Holding down center spot will
be (>-ft.-l Ivan Holm, the team's
only letterman who has tallied 59
points, and is considered a whiz
on the backboard. Holm was
originally a guard, but was moved
up by Coach George Barsi to take
advantage of his experience.
At the guard spots are Ed Fen
nelly, a misplaced forward and ex
cellent courtman with 41 points to
his credit, and Tom Guerin, strong
man under the basket, who has

been hampered by an injury since
the first Fleet City contest.
The Indians will counter with
their revised lineup, dene Mar
tin and Johnny Muir at forwards,
Tom Murphy at center, and Tom
Rodman and Hill Christiansen at
the guards.
The "B's" of Fordy Anderson,
who thumped Cal's Blues soundly
twice over the weekend, tangle in
the opener at 6:15 with the Santa
Clara "B" squad.
