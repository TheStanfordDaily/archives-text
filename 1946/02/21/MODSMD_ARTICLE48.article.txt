"Words, Ravic thought. Sweet
words. Gentle deceptive balm. Help,
love, to belong together, to come
back again — words, sweet words.
Nothing but words. How many
words existed for this simple, wild,
cruel attraction of two bodies!
"What a rainbow of imagina
tion, lies, sentiment, and self-de
ception enclosed it! There he
stood on this farewell night, there
lie stood, calm, in the dark, and
he let this rain of sweet words
trickle over him, words that
meant nothing but farewell, fare
well, farewell.
Arc We Lost?
"When one talked about it, it
was already lost. The God of
Love had a bloodstained forehead.

lie did not know anything about
words."
This is the new Remarque taIk-

ing. Sadder, wis
er than the
Remarque who
wrote "All Qui
et on the West
ern Front." The
disillusioned ro
mantic, too bit
ter to laugh, too
wise ta cry.

"I believe we are lost," he char
acterized the generation of the first
World War in "All Quiet."
Between Two Wars
What happened to the lost gen
eration? With their ideals de
stroyed. with their dreams buried
in the trenches, with "nothing to
look backward to with pride and
nothing to look forward to with
hope," what became of these men?
A gap of twenty years. In 1938 we
see Ravic, 40, physician, fugitive
from German concentration camps,
living in Paris under an assumed
name. He has no papers; he cannot
legally work. He performs ghost
operations for surgeons, he is em
ployed as doctor in a bordello.
Never Say Die
In spite of a war and in spite
of the Gestapo, he doesn't quit,
lie lias no fancy idealistic ration
alizations to justify his existence,
lie lias no complicated philosophy,
he has perhaps little more than a
will to live, to love, to keep on
drinking calvados. to keep going
even though he knows that the
goal is nowhere.
There is a world of difference be
tween, say, Chekhov's sensitive in
tellectuals who quit when they find
there is no solution, and Remarque's
Ravic, who keeps going, who knows
that his head is "bloody but un
bowed," who is neither proud of it,
nor ashamed, who, with a breaking
heart, shrugs his shoulders and
says "e'est la vie" because he knows

there is no other way.
Man—Mode! IJKW
As Iluic Westlius and Kat and
Ludwig were symbols of the lost
generation, Ravic is a symbol, but
of a larger nature. Ravic is the
twentieth century man—lost and
courageous, not yet mastered by
machines, but no longer master
ing them.
To summarize the plot here would
merely make it sound cheap. Su
perficial characterization might be
"A Novel of Love and Revenge"—
a trite and meaningless phrase. It is
Remarque's skill that keeps it above
other novels with similar plots.
Precision and Art
He has lost none of the somewhat
journalistic ability that made "All
Quiet" and"The Road Back" so
readable. He remains one of the
few writers who can blend cold
surgical precision with artistic
painting to achieve an effect of real
ity and abstraction, of the individ
ual and the universal, that is rare
ly found.
He has somewhat reduced the
generalizing in which he indulged
in "All Quiet." He is no longer so
willing to interrupt the story for
special comments; his philosophiz
ing now fits into the story.
Bacchus to Freud
Morosow, night-club doorman,
ex - Czarist colonel, tells Ravic,
half - seriously, half - flippantly,
"Drink, be quiet and live, you
murderer with scalpel. See what
has become of us. As far as I
know, only the old Greeks had
gods- of drinking and (he joy of
life: Bacchus and Dionysus.
"Instead of that we have Freud,
inferiority complexes and the psy
choanalysis. We're afraid of the too
great words in love and not afraid of
much too great words in politics.
A sorry generation!"
Alcohol en Masse
Remarque's style is not faultless.

j He places an amazing emphasis on
drinking, using impressive French
, names, presumably to achieve local
color. Vodka, pernod, calvados and
half a dozen other concoctions occur
page after page.
Ravic seems to consume consid
| crable quantities of alcohol without
I even becoming tipsy.
Hitchcock-Hemingway
The revenge part of the story
lias all the skill of a Hitchcock
production. It produces the rare
literary result where one sympa-
I thizes entirely with the criminol.
Most readers will like this part.
Opinions on the love story are
j bound to be far less unanimous,
j They will depend largely on per
| sonal taste. Admirers of Heming
j way will be quite impressed; others
; will feal that Joan Madou is some
! what unreal compared to the other
characters of "Arch of Triumph."
Fade-out
The entire story takes place un
der the shadows of the Arch. At
the end, war is declared and Ravic
is sent to an internment camp as
he had known he would be:
"The car drove along the Avc
j nue Wagram and turned into the
: Place de l'Etoile. There was no
| light anywhere. The square was
l nothing hut darkness. It was so
dark that one could not even sec
! the Arc de Triomphc."
: Thumbs Up!
It is a pleasure to note that there
are still some novelists who have
| not succumbed to writing Holly-
I wood grade B scenarios. No studio
| will pay fantastic sums for the film
I rights. It is not a pretty story, but
it is strong and alive.
Remarque avoids the artless
! spice of "Forever Amber," the
J superficial glibness of du Mauricr,
j and Steinbeck's artificial pathos,
| to write a novel that is powerful,
| meaningful, and enjoyable. —

Between Two Wars
What happened to the lost gen
eration? With their ideals de
stroyed. with their dreams buried
in the trenches, with "nothing to
look backward to with pride and
nothing to look forward to with
hope," what became of these men?
A gap of twenty years. In 1938 we
see Ravic, 40, physician, fugitive
from German concentration camps,
living in Paris under an assumed
name. He has no papers; he cannot
legally work. He performs ghost
operations for surgeons, he is em
ployed as doctor in a bordello.
Never Say Die
In spite of a war and in spite
of the Gestapo, he doesn't quit,
lie lias no fancy idealistic ration
alizations to justify his existence,
lie lias no complicated philosophy,
he has perhaps little more than a
will to live, to love, to keep on
drinking calvados. to keep going
even though he knows that the
goal is nowhere.
There is a world of difference be
tween, say, Chekhov's sensitive in
tellectuals who quit when they find
there is no solution, and Remarque's
Ravic, who keeps going, who knows
that his head is "bloody but un
bowed," who is neither proud of it,
nor ashamed, who, with a breaking
heart, shrugs his shoulders and
says "e'est la vie" because he knows

there is no other way.
Man—Mode! IJKW
As Iluic Westlius and Kat and
Ludwig were symbols of the lost
generation, Ravic is a symbol, but
of a larger nature. Ravic is the
twentieth century man—lost and
courageous, not yet mastered by
machines, but no longer master
ing them.
To summarize the plot here would
merely make it sound cheap. Su
perficial characterization might be
"A Novel of Love and Revenge"—
a trite and meaningless phrase. It is
Remarque's skill that keeps it above
other novels with similar plots.
Precision and Art
He has lost none of the somewhat
journalistic ability that made "All
Quiet" and"The Road Back" so
readable. He remains one of the
few writers who can blend cold
surgical precision with artistic
painting to achieve an effect of real
ity and abstraction, of the individ
ual and the universal, that is rare
ly found.
He has somewhat reduced the
generalizing in which he indulged
in "All Quiet." He is no longer so
willing to interrupt the story for
special comments; his philosophiz
ing now fits into the story.
Bacchus to Freud
Morosow, night-club doorman,
ex - Czarist colonel, tells Ravic,
half - seriously, half - flippantly,
"Drink, be quiet and live, you
murderer with scalpel. See what
has become of us. As far as I
know, only the old Greeks had
gods- of drinking and (he joy of
life: Bacchus and Dionysus.
"Instead of that we have Freud,
inferiority complexes and the psy
choanalysis. We're afraid of the too
great words in love and not afraid of
much too great words in politics.
A sorry generation!"
Alcohol en Masse
Remarque's style is not faultless.

j He places an amazing emphasis on
drinking, using impressive French
, names, presumably to achieve local
color. Vodka, pernod, calvados and
half a dozen other concoctions occur
page after page.
Ravic seems to consume consid

I even becoming tipsy.

The revenge part of the story

| sonal taste. Admirers of Heming
j way will be quite impressed; others

Fade-out
The entire story takes place un
der the shadows of the Arch. At
the end, war is declared and Ravic
is sent to an internment camp as
he had known he would be:
"The car drove along the Avc

Between Two Wars
What happened to the lost gen
eration? With their ideals de
stroyed. with their dreams buried
in the trenches, with "nothing to
look backward to with pride and
nothing to look forward to with
hope," what became of these men?
A gap of twenty years. In 1938 we
see Ravic, 40, physician, fugitive
from German concentration camps,
living in Paris under an assumed
name. He has no papers; he cannot
legally work. He performs ghost
operations for surgeons, he is em
ployed as doctor in a bordello.
Never Say Die
In spite of a war and in spite
of the Gestapo, he doesn't quit,
lie lias no fancy idealistic ration
alizations to justify his existence,
lie lias no complicated philosophy,
he has perhaps little more than a
will to live, to love, to keep on
drinking calvados. to keep going
even though he knows that the
goal is nowhere.
There is a world of difference be
tween, say, Chekhov's sensitive in
tellectuals who quit when they find
there is no solution, and Remarque's
Ravic, who keeps going, who knows
that his head is "bloody but un
bowed," who is neither proud of it,
nor ashamed, who, with a breaking
heart, shrugs his shoulders and
says "e'est la vie" because he knows

there is no other way.
Man—Mode! IJKW
As Iluic Westlius and Kat and
Ludwig were symbols of the lost
generation, Ravic is a symbol, but
of a larger nature. Ravic is the
twentieth century man—lost and
courageous, not yet mastered by
machines, but no longer master
ing them.
To summarize the plot here would
merely make it sound cheap. Su
perficial characterization might be
"A Novel of Love and Revenge"—
a trite and meaningless phrase. It is
Remarque's skill that keeps it above
other novels with similar plots.
Precision and Art
He has lost none of the somewhat
journalistic ability that made "All
Quiet" and"The Road Back" so
readable. He remains one of the
few writers who can blend cold
surgical precision with artistic
painting to achieve an effect of real
ity and abstraction, of the individ
ual and the universal, that is rare
ly found.
He has somewhat reduced the
generalizing in which he indulged
in "All Quiet." He is no longer so
willing to interrupt the story for
special comments; his philosophiz
ing now fits into the story.
Bacchus to Freud
Morosow, night-club doorman,
ex - Czarist colonel, tells Ravic,
half - seriously, half - flippantly,
"Drink, be quiet and live, you
murderer with scalpel. See what
has become of us. As far as I
know, only the old Greeks had
gods- of drinking and (he joy of
life: Bacchus and Dionysus.
"Instead of that we have Freud,
inferiority complexes and the psy
choanalysis. We're afraid of the too
great words in love and not afraid of
much too great words in politics.
A sorry generation!"
Alcohol en Masse
Remarque's style is not faultless.

j He places an amazing emphasis on
drinking, using impressive French
, names, presumably to achieve local
color. Vodka, pernod, calvados and
half a dozen other concoctions occur
page after page.
Ravic seems to consume consid
| crable quantities of alcohol without
I even becoming tipsy.
Hitchcock-Hemingway
The revenge part of the story
lias all the skill of a Hitchcock
production. It produces the rare
literary result where one sympa-
I thizes entirely with the criminol.

j They will depend largely on per
| sonal taste. Admirers of Heming
j way will be quite impressed; others

! what unreal compared to the other
characters of "Arch of Triumph."
Fade-out
The entire story takes place un
der the shadows of the Arch. At
the end, war is declared and Ravic
is sent to an internment camp as
he had known he would be:
"The car drove along the Avc
j nue Wagram and turned into the
