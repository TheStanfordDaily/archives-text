# THE 						RED CROSS BATTLE GOES ON!
## 
### 
From war into what, God grant, will
be enduring peace, the Red Cross
must carry on. The first year following
cessation of hostilities in World War
11, the Red Cross peacetime job keeps
its overtones of war. American sol
diers still overseas, or convalescing in
a U.S. hospital, or back home read
justing to civilian life — these are
prime concerns of the people's Red
Cross. Facing, too, the constant task
of helping the American public com
bat disasters and the problems of
community health, the Red Cross has a
great challenge before it in 1946 and
1947. The dual task of service to the
armed forces and to hungry civilians
overseas is combined with assistance
to Americans at home. Being a good
American is being a good neighbor
. . . to those in our community and to
nations less fortunate than ourselves.
Your contribution to this year's vital
Red Cross Fund Campaign will help
us all to be better neighbors.
