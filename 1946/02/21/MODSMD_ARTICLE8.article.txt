# Farm Veterans Laud Mature Level of Honor Code, But Decry Injustice of Mere Halfway Observation
## 
### ART CARFAGNI 
(Editorial note: This is the sec
ond in a series of articles dealing
with veterans' opinions of Stan
ford life and their suggestions for
its betterment.)

In reccnt days, much talk con
cerning the usefulness and applica
tion of the Stanford Honor Code
has been heard about the campus,
so much so that the Daily has con
ducted an informal survey for the
purpose of determining what stu
dents do think about the Honor
Code as it now stands.
(localise the largest new ele
ment 011 campus is the great
number of rc-civtlianized men,
the survey was limited to them,
including both returning veter
ans and those coming to Stanford
for the first time.
To the question, "What do you
think of the Honor Code as prac
ticed at Stanford today?" the fol

\ lowing varieties of answers were
given:
The great majority of those
questioned emphatically favored
the theory of the Honor Code, al
though some skepticism was ex
pressed as to its practice.
Breaking this down further, most
I of the men questioned felt that the
i Honor Code was designed to treat
them as mature persons, which col
, lege students supposedly arc, rather
j than as children who require the
I attentions of a governess-like proc
j tor to see that they conform.
As one of the students put it.
"It appeals to the decent side of
the human character rather than
' the petty and narrow."
Another veteran, a returning
I Stanford student who had been
! away since early 1942. felt that '"the
Honor Code is really Stanford in
i action; destroy that, and you have
| destroyed the spirit that is Stan-

| ford."
As for the other side of the |dc
lure, the main argument was not
with the Honor Code itself, hut in
regard to its practice here on the j
campus. The most typical re
mark seemed to he, "Yes, while I j
think the idea of an honor code is
fine, it's too idealistic, and it does
, not always work at Stanford "
Many students felt that there
I cannot be "semi-observance," that |
all or none of the students must ad- |
here to it, for it would not be fair i
S to those who follow the precepts of
I an honor code to compete with
| those persons who openly violate it.
I It seems that the situation would
: best be explained hy the song "All '
or Nothin'."
When questioned as to what, if
anything, could he substituted for
the Honor Code, the majority felt
that supervised examinations as
are practiced at California would

he (lie only alternative, although
some hinted hopefully that if
perhaps all teachers gave "open
book" tests (here "on Id he no
need for either system. The best
answer to that question came
from the first-quarter freshman
who pleadingly put forth the idea
that if tests were abolished com
pletely, once and for all, there
would he no problem.
In summing up all of this, it seems
that although most veterans are in
favor of the Honor Code, an equally
large number are dissatisfied with
the way it is being carried out, and
to them it seems this failure may
undermine the entire concept of the
Honor Code. In cfTcct. it is up to
each student to make the Honor
Code effective. No matter how de
sirable an idea is, if not carried out
correctly, it is of no value at all—
so it is with the Honor Code.

To the question, "What do you

The great majority of those
questioned emphatically favored
the theory of the Honor Code, al
though some skepticism was ex
pressed as to its practice.

I of the men questioned felt that the
i Honor Code was designed to treat
them as mature persons, which col

j than as children who require the
I attentions of a governess-like proc
j tor to see that they conform.
As one of the students put it.
"It appeals to the decent side of
the human character rather than
' the petty and narrow."
Another veteran, a returning
I Stanford student who had been

Honor Code is really Stanford in
i action; destroy that, and you have
| destroyed the spirit that is Stan-

As for the other side of the |dc
lure, the main argument was not
with the Honor Code itself, hut in
regard to its practice here on the j
campus. The most typical re
mark seemed to he, "Yes, while I j
think the idea of an honor code is
fine, it's too idealistic, and it does

In summing up all of this, it seems
that although most veterans are in
