It's the wear-everywhere casual that
you can't do without. It's all wool and *
warm for frosty 8 o'clock mornings.
It's lined in slippery salin and comes
equipped with shoulder straps for easy
sliding over your favorite suit. It's
equally at home on Quad or in the City.
And it comes in lovely cloud-drift col
ors . . . blue, grey, gold, green, blond.
