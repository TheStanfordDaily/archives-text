# FARM RED CROSS DRIVE STARTS TODAY
## Red Cross Drive Begins Today with $3,000 Quota; Variety Keynoted Stanford Red Cross Contribution 
### 
Stanford's American Red Cross Drive for 1946 begins today
with a quota of $3,000 for the Farm to collect. Nancy Banning,
chairman of the drive, has announced that collections will last
one week only.
It is hoped that each Stanford student will contribute $2 to

the Red Cross, but, according to
Miss Banning, any amount will be
aeccpted gratefully. Representatives
have been chosen from every cam
pus living group to collect for the
drive. Off - campus students may
contribute at one of the two booths
which will bo placed on Quad Tues
day.
Any Farm student who contrib
utes to the Red Cross in Palo Alto
is requested to ask that his contri
bution be credited to Stanford.
Red Cross Still Has Obligation
Although the war is over, the
American Red Cross still has many
obligations and duties to perform,
according to Miss Banning. To the
thousands of servicemen still over
seas, the Red Cross recreational
clubs are a welcome diversion to
bored, lonely occupation troops,
stated Mrs. Dare Stark McMullin,
public information director of the
Palo Alto chapter of the Red Cross.
Field directors overseas provide
counsel for servicemen's personal
problems.
Palo Alto's chapter is still on a
war footing, according to Mrs. Mc-

The day-to-day jobs of folding surgical dressings and knitting
afghans were part of Stanford's contribution to the Red Cross
as were the yearly all-out drives and the spectacular exhibitions.
When Bill Tilden, Frankie Kovacs, Virginia Woolfenden, and
i Patricia Caning Todd put on an exhibition tennis match on the

Stanford varsity courts in 1944, two
thousand dollars was raised for the
Red Cross Arts and Skills program,
financing the buying of craft ma
terials for hospitalized soldiers. Til
den auctioned autographs on ten
nis racquets and balls.
Drives Often Oversubscribed
The yearly drives held in Febru
ary, as is this year's, have usually
during the war had quotas of $3,000,
which were filled and sometimes
oversubscribed. Since 1943 they
have been chairmanned by women
—Miriam King, 1943; Cheri Martin,
1944; Charmian Kolar, 1945; and
Nancy Banning, 1946.
Work for the drives has included
collecting from living groups, main
taining booths on campus, making
posters and window displays, and
newspaper publicity.
Blood Doning Boosted
From day to day in the Daily and
in the living groups during the war,
blood doning was plugged as one
of the best ways Stanford men and
women could help the men on the
fighting front, through the Red

from Miss Enid Hutchinson, Superintendent of Nursing at the Palo
Alto Hospital. On the right is Mrs. Marian Peterson, R.N., instructor.
