## 
### 
Palo Alto Red Cross is starting a
I new training course for Nurses'
! Aides, to serve in the Palo Alto Hos-
I pital. The course will take six weeks,
mornings, three of the weeks in the
hospital itself. Graduates of the
class may ehoosc their own hours of
service thereafter. The class will
start as soon as the registration is
filled. Women interested may make
an appointment by telephoning Red
Cross, 22144.
Palo Alto Hospital, always crowd
! cd and without the advantage of bc
j ing a nurse-training institution,
j serves not only the town but Stan-
I ford students and residents as well.
In the present nursing shortage, it
I has been and must still be obliged to
rely on the volunteer nurses' aides,
and war conditions in the nursing
supply are not over in California
J anywhere.
Red Cross asks that any wives of
veterans with free time enroll in the
! class, and any who are already in
I possession of a Nurses Aide certifi
j cate report in to the chapter at the
i same telephone number.
