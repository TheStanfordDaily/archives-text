# Motor Corps Seeks Women
## 
### 
Wives of veteran Stanford students
who arc not attending college them
selves, and who have some leisure
time during the day, are invited by
the ltieal Red Cross chapter in Palo
Alto, whose membership includes
the Stanford campus, to join its Red
Cross Motor Corps. The Corps has
its own chapter station wagons;
corps members arc the drivers, so
that car-ownership is not required.
Drivers must be 18 or over, have a
driver's license, character references
and a doctor's certificate of adequate
physical health. Requirements of a
motor mechanics' and a first aid
course can be worked ofT while the
driver is in service. Classes of these
arc given when enough candidates
are ready.
Motor corps work, which has not
slacked oft for the local chapter, in
cludes chapter errands around town,
transportation of Red Cross workers
to Dibble General Hospital, service
to MofTett Field, trips to San Fran
cisco, sometimes to the docks, driv
ing Home Service volunteers on
their calls to servicemen's families,
and no deskwork. Convenient hours
can be arranged for each volunteer
driver.
Red Cross suggests to the new
comer wives that besides the op
portunity of satisfying service still
at war pitch, Motor Corps work of
fers a chance of making many local
friends and learning the country
side as well.
Anyone interest should call Red
Cross headquarters, 22144. and ask
for the Motor Corps desk.
