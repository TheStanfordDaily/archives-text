CAIRO, Feb. 24 (UP).â€”Egyptian
students have called a nation-wide
general strike for tomorrow to com

Thursday's rioting and authorities
immediately adopted special secur
ity measures to avoid more blood

so that "imperialists will feel the
people's condemnation of their
shameful challenge on unarmed
demonstrators."
