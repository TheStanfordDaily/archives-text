# Field Director Tells Leyte Experiences
## 
### CATHRYN OWEN 
Everything from seeing that a
soldier has a cigarette when he's
brought in to an emergency battle
station, to looking for a toothbrush
factory on Leyte 10 days after the
invasion—these are the duties of a
Red Cross field director. Charles
Scott, back at Stanford instructing

in history after serving as a field
director in the South Pacific for 18
months, says that it's difficult to
boil the duties of his position down
to anything more specific than that.
"Technically," he continued, "I
suppose you could broadly clas
sify Red Cross overseas work as
a channel between the CJI and
home, and the means for provid
ing the GI in combat with every
thing not included in ammunition,
food, and clothing."
After one day of fighting, the sol
dier is stripped of all personal be
longings, Mr. Scott pointed out.
"For instance," he illustrated, "the
toothbrush shortage on Leyte." Ten
days after the invasion of Leyte, the
general in charge of the division is
sued an order for immediate de
livery of 7,000 toothbrushes.
"We realized that they were us
ing quite a number of those brushes
for cleaning their guns," he said,
"but after a certain length of time,
a man just has to clean his teeth."
So, Scott and stall dug up—all but
literally—7,ooo toothbrushes.
Another shortage which hit
Leyte was the cigarette shortage.
On the surface this didn't seem
like such a crucial matter, since
the Red Cross had a good supply
of smoking tobacco. The crucial
part of the story is that there
were 25,000 men and 10 dozen
pipes.
Mr. Scott's wife, living in Palo
Alto, heard of the situation and or
ganized a search for pipes. The re
sult was that. Bay Area corncobs
were well represented on Leyte.
"Red Cross does this sort of
work during combat," Mr. Scott
pointed out, "and while in com
bat areas, in addition to trying to
provide wounded men with a few
little things that really count."
When a wounded man comes into
a battle station, Red Cross work
ers see that he has a cigarette,
something cold to drink if he's
hot, or something warm to drink
if he's cold.
Mr. Scott had started training
with the 96th Infantry Division in
the United States three years ago,
went through the invasions of Leyte
and Okinawa with them, and to the
Philippines, where the end of the
war caught up with the division, for
rehabilitation. He returned to Stan
ford near the end of December.
At all points of operations, Red
Cross workers were providing
some type of recreation. "1 was
a little surprised to find myself
running a movie on the boat,"
said Mr, Scott.
"The wartime job of the Red
Cross is rather obvious," he stal
ed, "but their post-war work is a
little more obscure. Red Cross's
activities with veterans and fami
lies will be tremendous. This will
go on for months and years.
' "As for Red Cross recreational
work," he continued, "it's just be
ginning. Morale service is far more
important after the fighting's over.
The ocupation troops are the ones
that will need recreation."

work during combat," Mr. Scott
pointed out, "and while in com
bat areas, in addition to trying to
provide wounded men with a few
little things that really count."
When a wounded man comes into
a battle station, Red Cross work
ers see that he has a cigarette,
something cold to drink if he's
hot, or something warm to drink
if he's cold.
Mr. Scott had started training
with the 96th Infantry Division in
the United States three years ago,
went through the invasions of Leyte
and Okinawa with them, and to the
Philippines, where the end of the
war caught up with the division, for
rehabilitation. He returned to Stan
ford near the end of December.
At all points of operations, Red
Cross workers were providing
some type of recreation. "1 was
a little surprised to find myself
running a movie on the boat,"
said Mr, Scott.
"The wartime job of the Red
Cross is rather obvious," he stal
ed, "but their post-war work is a
little more obscure. Red Cross's
activities with veterans and fami
lies will be tremendous. This will
go on for months and years.
' "As for Red Cross recreational
work," he continued, "it's just be
ginning. Morale service is far more
important after the fighting's over.
The ocupation troops are the ones
that will need recreation."
Everything from seeing that a
soldier has a cigarette when he's
brought in to an emergency battle
station, to looking for a toothbrush
factory on Leyte 10 days after the
invasion—these are the duties of a
Red Cross field director. Charles
Scott, back at Stanford instructing

in history after serving as a field
director in the South Pacific for 18
months, says that it's difficult to
boil the duties of his position down
to anything more specific than that.
"Technically," he continued, "I
suppose you could broadly clas
sify Red Cross overseas work as
a channel between the CJI and
home, and the means for provid
ing the GI in combat with every
thing not included in ammunition,
food, and clothing."
After one day of fighting, the sol
dier is stripped of all personal be
longings, Mr. Scott pointed out.
"For instance," he illustrated, "the
toothbrush shortage on Leyte." Ten
days after the invasion of Leyte, the
general in charge of the division is
sued an order for immediate de
livery of 7,000 toothbrushes.
"We realized that they were us
ing quite a number of those brushes
for cleaning their guns," he said,
"but after a certain length of time,
a man just has to clean his teeth."
So, Scott and stall dug up—all but
literally—7,ooo toothbrushes.
Another shortage which hit
Leyte was the cigarette shortage.
On the surface this didn't seem
like such a crucial matter, since
the Red Cross had a good supply
of smoking tobacco. The crucial
part of the story is that there
were 25,000 men and 10 dozen
pipes.
Mr. Scott's wife, living in Palo
Alto, heard of the situation and or
ganized a search for pipes. The re
sult was that. Bay Area corncobs
were well represented on Leyte.

work during combat," Mr. Scott
pointed out, "and while in com
bat areas, in addition to trying to
provide wounded men with a few
