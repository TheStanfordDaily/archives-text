(We are sorry for this interruption of several
days. Yet, until my entire ease has been presented,
I feel it is impractical to answer any questions the
first part may have provoked. I continue then to
decry indifference, and to show how I believe pres
ent day education will never "come to grips" with
lift's realities with an apparent absence of attitude
toward life. RKJ.) .
Materialism may be good for a balanced diet, but
alone it can never give us a balanced life. Likewise,
a hungry man is first a materialist, but when fed he
will experience new desires.
M> sticism Inadequate
Nor is the opposite extreme of pure mysticism
adequate. A blind faith- maintained by a consist
ent isolation trom material reality—will also leave
us unsatisfied. We need both depth and breadth in
the".structure" of our lives.
Living is a dynamic process. To retain stabil
ity a id effectiveness in it, we must, somewhere,
ssc.'.e a dynamic balance in these two dimen
sions. With our outside material facts, our inner
salves must have understanding and harmony
through their own inner attitudes of motivation.
The Middle Ages experienced the shortcomings
of monaslicism. Today the other extreme is in de
mand; but, eventually, the world will see that more
is desired than fine foods, automobiles, and repre
sentative government. In our time, with all our
facts, we must also have attitudes of judgment re
garding the facts.
Attitudes Force Action
Genuine living, or action, is an attitude "in mo
tion," which will have a permanent "force" com
parable to the "mass" of facts you move with.
Knowledge is the mass, and attitudes are the energy
contained in it. Consequently, the course of action
we take in lile will be determined by the attitudes
we have toward living. Thus, a statement of princi
ples by a person or group is only a proposed direc
tion of action. However, the reality, or true exist
ence, of those principles can only be demonstrated
in one way—by action.
Where now does the "thing" called faith came

in? What is it for?
Faith in others is the assumption that tomorrow
your fellow men will act in much the same pattern
as they did today. However, before you discover
this in others or understand it, you must first have
experience in it yourself.
We All Change
In the morning we arise with the convenient as
sumption that we are the same. But, we are not.
Because we live, we change. Physically we have
changed while we slept. But, regardless of that,
past experience has shown that the extent of that
change is not excessive. When we awake we can
still "find" ourselves. In fact, we have found that
what tlie professors told us (wo days ago still made
sense at yesterday's class, and we generously as
sume that the same thing will be possible today.
To find reasons for having faith in ourselves is
wisely desiring to "Know thyself." For each of
us, the reality that "I am" is easier to know than
that of "You are." Moreover, that of "You are"
is easier to know than that of "He is." Why
shouldn't that he so?
The reality of the Earth is easier to know than
that of Mars, not simply because it is physically
nearer, but because for its proximity we have had
more experiences with it, A wife in the States and
her husband on the other side of the globe can be
"closer" to one another than the people with whom
they temporarily live.
Disagreement Profitable
That is our purpose in trying to know people.
Reading this as a third person you may tell your
self, "Whoever wrote this is on (or off) the beam."
However, if through knowing me, our relationship
became that of second person, your reaction would
be somewhat different. You would say, "He is fur
ther on (or off) the beam than I thought he was."
Finally, to people who like action, disagreement
is not only interesting but profitable. To them in
difference is incomprehensible. It is important then,
however, whether or not those who differ proceed
intelligently to solve their differences.

Materialism may be good for a balanced diet, but

M> sticism Inadequate
Nor is the opposite extreme of pure mysticism

us unsatisfied. We need both depth and breadth in
the".structure" of our lives.
Living is a dynamic process. To retain stabil
ity a id effectiveness in it, we must, somewhere,
ssc.'.e a dynamic balance in these two dimen
sions. With our outside material facts, our inner
salves must have understanding and harmony
through their own inner attitudes of motivation.
The Middle Ages experienced the shortcomings
of monaslicism. Today the other extreme is in de
mand; but, eventually, the world will see that more
is desired than fine foods, automobiles, and repre

facts, we must also have attitudes of judgment re
garding the facts.
Attitudes Force Action
Genuine living, or action, is an attitude "in mo
tion," which will have a permanent "force" com
parable to the "mass" of facts you move with.
Knowledge is the mass, and attitudes are the energy
contained in it. Consequently, the course of action
we take in lile will be determined by the attitudes
we have toward living. Thus, a statement of princi
ples by a person or group is only a proposed direc
tion of action. However, the reality, or true exist
ence, of those principles can only be demonstrated
in one way—by action.
Where now does the "thing" called faith came

in? What is it for?
Faith in others is the assumption that tomorrow
your fellow men will act in much the same pattern
as they did today. However, before you discover
this in others or understand it, you must first have
experience in it yourself.
We All Change
In the morning we arise with the convenient as
sumption that we are the same. But, we are not.
Because we live, we change. Physically we have
changed while we slept. But, regardless of that,
past experience has shown that the extent of that
change is not excessive. When we awake we can
still "find" ourselves. In fact, we have found that
what tlie professors told us (wo days ago still made
sense at yesterday's class, and we generously as
sume that the same thing will be possible today.
To find reasons for having faith in ourselves is
wisely desiring to "Know thyself." For each of
us, the reality that "I am" is easier to know than
that of "You are." Moreover, that of "You are"
is easier to know than that of "He is." Why
shouldn't that he so?
The reality of the Earth is easier to know than
that of Mars, not simply because it is physically
nearer, but because for its proximity we have had
more experiences with it, A wife in the States and
her husband on the other side of the globe can be
"closer" to one another than the people with whom
they temporarily live.
Disagreement Profitable
That is our purpose in trying to know people.
