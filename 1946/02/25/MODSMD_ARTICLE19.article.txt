# BULL SESSION
## 
### H. D. THOREAU 
If you are out in the Cactus Gardens some eve
ning this week (typing a term paper) and you are
startled by a flash bulb, don't worry. It won't be
Peek-a-boo Pennington. It will probably be Ed
McLellan, the Stanford University Press's fine
fotog, taking a shot of the C.G. by moonlight which
is to be run on the cover of the Alumni Review in
a forthcoming issue.
* * *
Our San Quentin News exchange editor tells us
that last week's News ran the following statement
by F. W. A. Cording, Superintendent of the San
Quentin Ranch, in the right "ear."
"Our first aim at San Quentin's ranch is to help
a man find himself."
Most of them would probably rather find the
gate.
The left "ear" presents still another angle on the
lost and found dept.:
"In God's green fields, a man may find his soul."
This second statement is by Henry David Tho
reau, transcendentalist, who may or may not be
connected with the institution. They don't say.
+ * *
Anyone who staged on the reservation this past
holiday weekend may obtain a vicarious vacation
for only 50 cents, since the new magazine "Holiday"
is on sale at the Cellar. Or you might take your
h'df-dollar and ride to Palo Alto and back on the
omnibus 2 1 £ times.

This week's Satevepost has a neat cartoon by
Roy Williams. He is also a contributor to the New
Yorker and the Chaparral. Roy, who works for
Walt Disney, Inc., gives us stuff that's too' sophisti
cated for other audiences.
Collie Small, the fellow we've been telling you
about, has another article appearing in this week's
Post. Title: "They Major in Tennis at Rollins."
Small was in these parts recently collecting ma
terial for an opus on San Francisco. He dropped
down the peninsula, but apparently paid his only
social call to a soda-fountain operator down the
highway named Lee.
* * *
A new source has been found fur obtaining pure
water on campus: Cellar orange juice . . honest,
there's a girl down the corridor who goes all the

way to San Jose to buy the lemons with which she
surreptitiously rinses her syrupy blond hair . . .
if the University wanted to wash the windows in
the Journalism Building for the first time since
Bastille Day, 1939 (150 th anniversary), we're sure
Dr. Bush wouldn't object too strongly . . . crate up
all of your ants and send them to U.S. Army
Weather Station on Baffin Island, Canada. They
run races with them and their stables are getting
low.
* * *
Let it be known that this column was not pre
vented from expressing any anti-area-representa
tion sentiments prior to the election. It is our policy
to lock the barn only ;ifter the milk has been
spilled.
We do, however, predict that in 1947 or '48 when
ihose well-worn "normal times" return and when
there is a more stable and better informed elec
torate russian to the poles, this catastrophe will be
repealed. •
When students begin their college years to
gether in Encina and Roble fidgeting through the
same Jolly-ups and four years later fidget through
the Commencement orations together, they are
going to again want as much class distinction as
possible.
If men students are again split by "Hall"
and "How" distinctions, it will again be desirable
not to widen the gap farther by having separate
elections and representation. In the past, no mut
ter where you lived during your last three years
here, you always had friends in your class in the
other living units. One reason the University has
always provided freshman dorms is to acquaint the
incoming students with their fellows and give them
a certain class spirit.
"Naturally you "war babies" with your acceler
ated and uncertain progress through these hallowed
halls would have no feeling for this, but to think
that (108 of you had the nerve to perpetrate this
injustice on the classes of '50, '51, '52 in
finity, is to think that the Stanford students of to
day lack the consideration and forethought that
should be part of the make-up of the educated
ladies and gentlemen this institution strives to foist
on society.
Now aren't you sorry you voted wrong?

Let it be known that this column was not pre

to lock the barn only ;ifter the milk has been

there is a more stable and better informed elec

When students begin their college years to
gether in Encina and Roble fidgeting through the
same Jolly-ups and four years later fidget through
the Commencement orations together, they are
going to again want as much class distinction as
possible.
If men students are again split by "Hall"
and "How" distinctions, it will again be desirable
not to widen the gap farther by having separate
elections and representation. In the past, no mut
ter where you lived during your last three years
here, you always had friends in your class in the
other living units. One reason the University has
always provided freshman dorms is to acquaint the
incoming students with their fellows and give them
a certain class spirit.
"Naturally you "war babies" with your acceler
ated and uncertain progress through these hallowed
halls would have no feeling for this, but to think
that (108 of you had the nerve to perpetrate this
injustice on the classes of '50, '51, '52 in
finity, is to think that the Stanford students of to
day lack the consideration and forethought that
should be part of the make-up of the educated
ladies and gentlemen this institution strives to foist
on society.
Now aren't you sorry you voted wrong?
If you are out in the Cactus Gardens some eve

startled by a flash bulb, don't worry. It won't be
Peek-a-boo Pennington. It will probably be Ed

Our San Quentin News exchange editor tells us
that last week's News ran the following statement
by F. W. A. Cording, Superintendent of the San
Quentin Ranch, in the right "ear."
"Our first aim at San Quentin's ranch is to help
a man find himself."
Most of them would probably rather find the
gate.
The left "ear" presents still another angle on the
lost and found dept.:
"In God's green fields, a man may find his soul."
This second statement is by Henry David Tho

run races with them and their stables are getting

Let it be known that this column was not pre
vented from expressing any anti-area-representa
tion sentiments prior to the election. It is our policy
to lock the barn only ;ifter the milk has been
spilled.
We do, however, predict that in 1947 or '48 when
ihose well-worn "normal times" return and when
there is a more stable and better informed elec
torate russian to the poles, this catastrophe will be
repealed. •
When students begin their college years to
gether in Encina and Roble fidgeting through the
same Jolly-ups and four years later fidget through
the Commencement orations together, they are
going to again want as much class distinction as
possible.
If men students are again split by "Hall"
and "How" distinctions, it will again be desirable
not to widen the gap farther by having separate
elections and representation. In the past, no mut
ter where you lived during your last three years
here, you always had friends in your class in the
other living units. One reason the University has
always provided freshman dorms is to acquaint the
incoming students with their fellows and give them
a certain class spirit.
"Naturally you "war babies" with your acceler
ated and uncertain progress through these hallowed
halls would have no feeling for this, but to think
that (108 of you had the nerve to perpetrate this
injustice on the classes of '50, '51, '52 in
finity, is to think that the Stanford students of to
day lack the consideration and forethought that
should be part of the make-up of the educated
ladies and gentlemen this institution strives to foist
on society.
Now aren't you sorry you voted wrong?
