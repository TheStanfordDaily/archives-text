# Red Cross Aide Tells Oversea Adventures
## 
### 
"It's not your feet that get tired with an 8:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.
day, seven days a week," reports Louise Shoup, '29 and a Red
Cross overseas staff aide '43, '44, '45. ' Field boots and wool
socks are swell, even when the mud comes over them. It's that
Red Cross smile all day. Our unit wore combat uniform, our

hospital colonel insisted on our |
steel helmets (mine usually slid
over my face), and lipstick and
smiles were the only things that j
made us look human."
Louise, looking like a fifth-year j
Stanford student, still able to smile, [
and back at home on the campus
for a short rest before seeing some
more world, has packed in several
careers already. Teaching in Gin-
Ling College in China, in Geneva, J
at Stanford, she thinks the Red
Cross years taught her the most. !
Two years' Nurses' Aiding made her
choose hospital work overseas.
"I had a hard time getting in," :
she reports. "They thought I had
too much education, no commit- j
nity singing, no group games, no
handicrafts. I have all those now.
And of course we never had life j
so tough as the elubmobile girls, !
or the girls in the evacuation hos
pitals—those were something."
Her matter - of - fact adventures j
sound like something to a civilian.
Something pretty rugged. Training
included the military nurses' in
filtration course, where they shoot !
over you and you fall fiat on your
face. "I still remember jumping into ,
a ditch on top of a nurse, who felt |
badly anyway, what with shots and |
things."
A troop-ship with 12 in a two- J
room cabin, stepping over shift- j
sleeping G.l.'s in every corridor, the I
ship seven times over-filled, six !
weeks' pneumonia in London, the '
hospital shaking nightly in air raids
with the ack-ack guns in Hyde Park j
helping the shakes, sweating it out
in the lovely Gloucester country- i
side, 500 people — 60 doctors, 90
nurses, 1400 bed capacity, and 5 Red ]
Cross girls waiting for casualties i
who came in floods at Christmas j
time, the Channel crossing in July j
after D-day are some of the scenes I
she remembers.
"We never knew where we
were going. In New York we
thought it was Africa and our
musical instruments and our
medicines went there—and on the
boat going over we went around
with one accordion and got peo
ple singing and put on shows. In
France we climbed off the LS'r
in the dark on Omaha lieach
and slept in a rainy field without
blankets, near the front lines, we
soon found out."
Normandy was already a wreck.
