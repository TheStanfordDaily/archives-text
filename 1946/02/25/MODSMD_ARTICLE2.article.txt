# Red Cross Aide Tells Oversea Adventures
## 
### 
"It's not your feet that get tired with an 8:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.
day, seven days a week," reports Louise Shoup, '29 and a Red
Cross overseas staff aide '43, '44, '45. ' Field boots and wool
socks are swell, even when the mud comes over them. It's that
Red Cross smile all day. Our unit wore combat uniform, our

hospital colonel insisted on our |
steel helmets (mine usually slid
over my face), and lipstick and
smiles were the only things that j
made us look human."
Louise, looking like a fifth-year j
Stanford student, still able to smile, [
and back at home on the campus
for a short rest before seeing some
more world, has packed in several
careers already. Teaching in Gin-
Ling College in China, in Geneva, J
at Stanford, she thinks the Red
Cross years taught her the most. !
Two years' Nurses' Aiding made her
choose hospital work overseas.
"I had a hard time getting in," :
she reports. "They thought I had
too much education, no commit- j
nity singing, no group games, no
handicrafts. I have all those now.
And of course we never had life j
so tough as the elubmobile girls, !
or the girls in the evacuation hos
pitals—those were something."
Her matter - of - fact adventures j
sound like something to a civilian.
Something pretty rugged. Training
included the military nurses' in
filtration course, where they shoot !
over you and you fall fiat on your
face. "I still remember jumping into ,
a ditch on top of a nurse, who felt |
badly anyway, what with shots and |
things."
A troop-ship with 12 in a two- J
room cabin, stepping over shift- j
sleeping G.l.'s in every corridor, the I
ship seven times over-filled, six !
weeks' pneumonia in London, the '
hospital shaking nightly in air raids
with the ack-ack guns in Hyde Park j
helping the shakes, sweating it out
in the lovely Gloucester country- i
side, 500 people — 60 doctors, 90
nurses, 1400 bed capacity, and 5 Red ]
Cross girls waiting for casualties i
who came in floods at Christmas j
time, the Channel crossing in July j
after D-day are some of the scenes I
she remembers.
"We never knew where we
were going. In New York we
thought it was Africa and our
musical instruments and our
medicines went there—and on the
boat going over we went around
with one accordion and got peo
ple singing and put on shows. In
France we climbed off the LS'r
in the dark on Omaha lieach
and slept in a rainy field without
blankets, near the front lines, we
soon found out."
Normandy was already a wreck.
From Le Haye de Puis, from a field
near St. Lo, by trucks, on a train
that once mad" 2(> miles a day, they
made their way to a small town -a
railway center really in Lorraine,
"Of course (he Germans strafed
that all the time, hut not our hos
pital," she said calmly. The Hat
tie V»f the Bulge was on, and their
first hospital was really an evac
uation center. The men came in
on litters from hattle stations,
were set down in the dripping
tents in the mud and flown out
.'5OO at a time. The Red Cross
girls gave them gum and com
forts (every day they ran out of
supplies), and singing and just
talk, wrote their letters, untangled
their family problems with cables
home, got them emergency fur
loughs in vital cases—"even the
colonels had to come to us for
that"—and sped them off to safer
hospitals.
When they moved into old French
barracks, where the Germans had
removed all the plumbing, yanked

out all the electric wires, and gen
erally shot out the place, they re
ciprocated by "scrounging" for fu
niture in deserted German houses
and headquarters. (They were very
close to Met/.)
"Some real pal brought us one of
Goering's tea-sets for our quarters,'
Louise remembers. "It cheered us
a lot—the men, too, when we told
them."
Scrounging helped with their
supplies. "When we ran out of
stationery, we cut up rolls of Ger
man wallpaper with razor blades
—blue, pink, any color. They
made lovely letters."
Once the girls went up them
selves in a wild-riding jeep to find
something for their men, com
plained of the speed, and were told
the Germans wouldn't shoot and a
fast vehicle, a bad target, wasted
ammunition. They'd thought the
shooting was American until then.
"My education wasn't a total
loss." says Louise. "I did remember
some high-school French, about 500
$/ords, all simple." On its strength
they lent her for five days to a Har
vard medical outfit that had lost its
high-school French, doctoring the
French women and children who
had b°en hurt in shelling.
"You could tell them they
wouldn't • lose their arm. or that
their children were all right, and
you could comfort the children.
They were all so brave." But a
huge bearded Russian in their
own hospital—hack broken from
escape from a German prison—
defeated everyone.
"Till we found he loved flowers—
we hunt?d everywhere for him. The
day he left I rushed out with a
bunch and we stuck them around
his neck in the top of his cast. He
loved it."
G.l.'s ih the hospital were won
derful to the French and Belgians.
They'd have the girls hunt up fel
low-nationals for them. They'd take
them to the recreation hall, talking

loudly in American. "Now you
wait here while I go there to the PX
and I'll come back and get you.
In return, Louise gathered up
1 ISO small French children at
Christmas, who sang and danced
in all the wards, and had a G.I.
given Christmas in the hall, with
G.l. candy and fun.
"We developed several orches
tras among the ambulant men,"
Louise remembers. "We were pret
ty dead by night, but we had dances
for the enlisted men —the hospital
workers—boots and all. It was the
hardest work we did, but they rated
it."
Keeping wounded Americans in
touch with their families, in cheer,
mental relief, once a clay in a good
laugh, was the most important Red
Cross work overseas, thinks Lou
ise. Her Red Cross unit of five, from
St. Louis, New York, Washington,
lowa, and California (as she doesn't
tell you), was rated its "strong unit"
by Paris headquarters. "The men
themselves told us that it was the
clubs they could go to on leave. Red
Cross is keeping those up now for
the troops—thank God for it."—Mc-
Mullin

.'5OO at a time. The Red Cross
girls gave them gum and com
forts (every day they ran out of
supplies), and singing and just
talk, wrote their letters, untangled
their family problems with cables
home, got them emergency fur
loughs in vital cases—"even the
colonels had to come to us for
that"—and sped them off to safer
hospitals.
When they moved into old French
barracks, where the Germans had
removed all the plumbing, yanked

out all the electric wires, and gen
erally shot out the place, they re
ciprocated by "scrounging" for fu
niture in deserted German houses
and headquarters. (They were very
close to Met/.)
"Some real pal brought us one of
Goering's tea-sets for our quarters,'
Louise remembers. "It cheered us
a lot—the men, too, when we told
them."
Scrounging helped with their
supplies. "When we ran out of
stationery, we cut up rolls of Ger
man wallpaper with razor blades
—blue, pink, any color. They
made lovely letters."
Once the girls went up them
selves in a wild-riding jeep to find
something for their men, com
plained of the speed, and were told
the Germans wouldn't shoot and a
fast vehicle, a bad target, wasted
ammunition. They'd thought the
shooting was American until then.
"My education wasn't a total
loss." says Louise. "I did remember
some high-school French, about 500
$/ords, all simple." On its strength
they lent her for five days to a Har
vard medical outfit that had lost its
high-school French, doctoring the
French women and children who
had b°en hurt in shelling.
"You could tell them they
wouldn't • lose their arm. or that
their children were all right, and
you could comfort the children.
They were all so brave." But a
huge bearded Russian in their
own hospital—hack broken from
escape from a German prison—
defeated everyone.
"Till we found he loved flowers—
we hunt?d everywhere for him. The
day he left I rushed out with a
bunch and we stuck them around
his neck in the top of his cast. He
loved it."
G.l.'s ih the hospital were won
derful to the French and Belgians.
They'd have the girls hunt up fel
low-nationals for them. They'd take
them to the recreation hall, talking

loudly in American. "Now you
wait here while I go there to the PX
and I'll come back and get you.
In return, Louise gathered up
1 ISO small French children at
Christmas, who sang and danced
in all the wards, and had a G.I.
given Christmas in the hall, with
G.l. candy and fun.
"We developed several orches
tras among the ambulant men,"
Louise remembers. "We were pret
ty dead by night, but we had dances
for the enlisted men —the hospital
workers—boots and all. It was the
hardest work we did, but they rated
it."
Keeping wounded Americans in
touch with their families, in cheer,
mental relief, once a clay in a good
laugh, was the most important Red
Cross work overseas, thinks Lou
ise. Her Red Cross unit of five, from
St. Louis, New York, Washington,
lowa, and California (as she doesn't
tell you), was rated its "strong unit"
by Paris headquarters. "The men
themselves told us that it was the
clubs they could go to on leave. Red
Cross is keeping those up now for
the troops—thank God for it."—Mc-

"It's not your feet that get tired with an 8:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.

socks are swell, even when the mud comes over them. It's that
Red Cross smile all day. Our unit wore combat uniform, our

"It's not your feet that get tired with an 8:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.
day, seven days a week," reports Louise Shoup, '29 and a Red
Cross overseas staff aide '43, '44, '45. ' Field boots and wool
socks are swell, even when the mud comes over them. It's that
Red Cross smile all day. Our unit wore combat uniform, our

hospital colonel insisted on our |
steel helmets (mine usually slid
over my face), and lipstick and
smiles were the only things that j
made us look human."
Louise, looking like a fifth-year j
Stanford student, still able to smile, [
and back at home on the campus
for a short rest before seeing some
more world, has packed in several
careers already. Teaching in Gin-
Ling College in China, in Geneva, J
at Stanford, she thinks the Red
Cross years taught her the most. !
Two years' Nurses' Aiding made her
choose hospital work overseas.
"I had a hard time getting in," :
she reports. "They thought I had
too much education, no commit- j
nity singing, no group games, no
handicrafts. I have all those now.
And of course we never had life j
so tough as the elubmobile girls, !
or the girls in the evacuation hos
pitals—those were something."
Her matter - of - fact adventures j
sound like something to a civilian.
Something pretty rugged. Training
included the military nurses' in
filtration course, where they shoot !
over you and you fall fiat on your
face. "I still remember jumping into ,
a ditch on top of a nurse, who felt |
badly anyway, what with shots and |
things."
A troop-ship with 12 in a two- J
room cabin, stepping over shift- j
sleeping G.l.'s in every corridor, the I

nurses, 1400 bed capacity, and 5 Red ]
Cross girls waiting for casualties i
who came in floods at Christmas j
time, the Channel crossing in July j
after D-day are some of the scenes I
she remembers.
"We never knew where we
were going. In New York we
thought it was Africa and our
musical instruments and our
medicines went there—and on the
boat going over we went around
with one accordion and got peo
ple singing and put on shows. In
France we climbed off the LS'r
in the dark on Omaha lieach
and slept in a rainy field without
blankets, near the front lines, we
soon found out."
Normandy was already a wreck.
From Le Haye de Puis, from a field
near St. Lo, by trucks, on a train
that once mad" 2(> miles a day, they
made their way to a small town -a
railway center really in Lorraine,
"Of course (he Germans strafed
that all the time, hut not our hos
pital," she said calmly. The Hat
tie V»f the Bulge was on, and their
first hospital was really an evac
uation center. The men came in
on litters from hattle stations,
were set down in the dripping
tents in the mud and flown out
.'5OO at a time. The Red Cross
girls gave them gum and com
forts (every day they ran out of
supplies), and singing and just
talk, wrote their letters, untangled
their family problems with cables
home, got them emergency fur
loughs in vital cases—"even the
colonels had to come to us for
that"—and sped them off to safer
hospitals.
When they moved into old French
barracks, where the Germans had
removed all the plumbing, yanked

out all the electric wires, and gen
erally shot out the place, they re
ciprocated by "scrounging" for fu
niture in deserted German houses
and headquarters. (They were very
close to Met/.)
"Some real pal brought us one of
Goering's tea-sets for our quarters,'
Louise remembers. "It cheered us
a lot—the men, too, when we told
them."
Scrounging helped with their
supplies. "When we ran out of
stationery, we cut up rolls of Ger
man wallpaper with razor blades
—blue, pink, any color. They
made lovely letters."
Once the girls went up them
selves in a wild-riding jeep to find
something for their men, com
plained of the speed, and were told
the Germans wouldn't shoot and a
fast vehicle, a bad target, wasted
ammunition. They'd thought the
shooting was American until then.
"My education wasn't a total
loss." says Louise. "I did remember
some high-school French, about 500
$/ords, all simple." On its strength
they lent her for five days to a Har
vard medical outfit that had lost its
high-school French, doctoring the
French women and children who
had b°en hurt in shelling.
"You could tell them they
wouldn't • lose their arm. or that
their children were all right, and
you could comfort the children.
They were all so brave." But a
huge bearded Russian in their
own hospital—hack broken from
escape from a German prison—
defeated everyone.
"Till we found he loved flowers—
we hunt?d everywhere for him. The
day he left I rushed out with a
bunch and we stuck them around
his neck in the top of his cast. He
loved it."
G.l.'s ih the hospital were won
derful to the French and Belgians.
They'd have the girls hunt up fel
low-nationals for them. They'd take
them to the recreation hall, talking

loudly in American. "Now you
wait here while I go there to the PX
and I'll come back and get you.
In return, Louise gathered up
1 ISO small French children at
Christmas, who sang and danced
in all the wards, and had a G.I.
given Christmas in the hall, with
G.l. candy and fun.
"We developed several orches
tras among the ambulant men,"
Louise remembers. "We were pret
ty dead by night, but we had dances
for the enlisted men —the hospital
workers—boots and all. It was the
hardest work we did, but they rated
it."
Keeping wounded Americans in
touch with their families, in cheer,
mental relief, once a clay in a good
laugh, was the most important Red
Cross work overseas, thinks Lou
ise. Her Red Cross unit of five, from
St. Louis, New York, Washington,

that all the time, hut not our hos
pital," she said calmly. The Hat
tie V»f the Bulge was on, and their
first hospital was really an evac
uation center. The men came in
on litters from hattle stations,
were set down in the dripping
tents in the mud and flown out
.'5OO at a time. The Red Cross
girls gave them gum and com
forts (every day they ran out of
supplies), and singing and just
talk, wrote their letters, untangled
their family problems with cables
home, got them emergency fur
loughs in vital cases—"even the
colonels had to come to us for
that"—and sped them off to safer
hospitals.
When they moved into old French
barracks, where the Germans had
removed all the plumbing, yanked

out all the electric wires, and gen
erally shot out the place, they re
ciprocated by "scrounging" for fu
niture in deserted German houses
and headquarters. (They were very
close to Met/.)
"Some real pal brought us one of
Goering's tea-sets for our quarters,'
Louise remembers. "It cheered us
a lot—the men, too, when we told
them."
Scrounging helped with their
supplies. "When we ran out of
stationery, we cut up rolls of Ger
man wallpaper with razor blades
—blue, pink, any color. They
made lovely letters."
Once the girls went up them
selves in a wild-riding jeep to find
something for their men, com
plained of the speed, and were told
the Germans wouldn't shoot and a
fast vehicle, a bad target, wasted
ammunition. They'd thought the
shooting was American until then.
"My education wasn't a total
loss." says Louise. "I did remember
some high-school French, about 500
$/ords, all simple." On its strength
they lent her for five days to a Har
vard medical outfit that had lost its
high-school French, doctoring the
French women and children who
had b°en hurt in shelling.
"You could tell them they
wouldn't • lose their arm. or that
their children were all right, and
you could comfort the children.
They were all so brave." But a
huge bearded Russian in their
own hospital—hack broken from
escape from a German prison—
defeated everyone.
"Till we found he loved flowers—
we hunt?d everywhere for him. The
day he left I rushed out with a
bunch and we stuck them around
his neck in the top of his cast. He
loved it."
G.l.'s ih the hospital were won
derful to the French and Belgians.
They'd have the girls hunt up fel
low-nationals for them. They'd take
them to the recreation hall, talking

loudly in American. "Now you
wait here while I go there to the PX
and I'll come back and get you.
In return, Louise gathered up
1 ISO small French children at
Christmas, who sang and danced
in all the wards, and had a G.I.
given Christmas in the hall, with
G.l. candy and fun.
"We developed several orches
tras among the ambulant men,"
Louise remembers. "We were pret
ty dead by night, but we had dances
for the enlisted men —the hospital
workers—boots and all. It was the
hardest work we did, but they rated
it."
Keeping wounded Americans in
touch with their families, in cheer,
mental relief, once a clay in a good
laugh, was the most important Red
Cross work overseas, thinks Lou
ise. Her Red Cross unit of five, from
St. Louis, New York, Washington,
lowa, and California (as she doesn't
tell you), was rated its "strong unit"
by Paris headquarters. "The men
themselves told us that it was the
clubs they could go to on leave. Red
Cross is keeping those up now for
the troops—thank God for it."—Mc-
Mullin
"It's not your feet that get tired with an 8:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.
day, seven days a week," reports Louise Shoup, '29 and a Red
Cross overseas staff aide '43, '44, '45. ' Field boots and wool
socks are swell, even when the mud comes over them. It's that
Red Cross smile all day. Our unit wore combat uniform, our

hospital colonel insisted on our |
steel helmets (mine usually slid
over my face), and lipstick and
smiles were the only things that j
made us look human."
Louise, looking like a fifth-year j
Stanford student, still able to smile, [
and back at home on the campus
for a short rest before seeing some
more world, has packed in several
careers already. Teaching in Gin-
Ling College in China, in Geneva, J
at Stanford, she thinks the Red
Cross years taught her the most. !
Two years' Nurses' Aiding made her
choose hospital work overseas.
"I had a hard time getting in," :
she reports. "They thought I had
too much education, no commit- j
nity singing, no group games, no
handicrafts. I have all those now.
And of course we never had life j
so tough as the elubmobile girls, !
or the girls in the evacuation hos
pitals—those were something."
Her matter - of - fact adventures j
sound like something to a civilian.
Something pretty rugged. Training
included the military nurses' in
filtration course, where they shoot !
over you and you fall fiat on your
face. "I still remember jumping into ,
a ditch on top of a nurse, who felt |
badly anyway, what with shots and |
things."
A troop-ship with 12 in a two- J
room cabin, stepping over shift- j
sleeping G.l.'s in every corridor, the I
ship seven times over-filled, six !
weeks' pneumonia in London, the '
hospital shaking nightly in air raids
with the ack-ack guns in Hyde Park j
helping the shakes, sweating it out
in the lovely Gloucester country- i
side, 500 people — 60 doctors, 90
nurses, 1400 bed capacity, and 5 Red ]
Cross girls waiting for casualties i
who came in floods at Christmas j
time, the Channel crossing in July j
after D-day are some of the scenes I
she remembers.
"We never knew where we
were going. In New York we
thought it was Africa and our
musical instruments and our
medicines went there—and on the
boat going over we went around
with one accordion and got peo
ple singing and put on shows. In
France we climbed off the LS'r
in the dark on Omaha lieach
and slept in a rainy field without
blankets, near the front lines, we
soon found out."
Normandy was already a wreck.
From Le Haye de Puis, from a field
near St. Lo, by trucks, on a train
that once mad" 2(> miles a day, they
made their way to a small town -a
railway center really in Lorraine,
"Of course (he Germans strafed
