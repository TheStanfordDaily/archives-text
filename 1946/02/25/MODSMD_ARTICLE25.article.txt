## 
### 
JERUSALEM, Feb. 24 (UP).â€”
Members of the Jewish Resistance"
Movement took over the modern
citv of Tel Aviv for six hours today
as 50.000 agitated Jews attended the
funeral of four raiders killed early
Friday in an unsuccessful attack
against the British.
Not a single British soldier was in
evidence in the city as one-third of
the population marched through the
streets in a mile-long funeral cor
tege honoring the dead Jews, who
were shot down when they attacked
a British police mobile force at Sa
rona, a German colony near Tel
Aviv.
The city's mass demonstration of
solidarity with resistance groups
surprised even the best - informed
observers and caused the immediate
recall of high government officials
from weekend resorts. Immediate
consultations were scheduled and
the army and police were ordered
to stand by throughout Palestine.
Some sources predicted that a ma
jor crisis was at hand.
