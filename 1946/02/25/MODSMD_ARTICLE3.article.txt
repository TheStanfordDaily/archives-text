# Grads, Seniors: Sign for Jobs
## 
### 
Graduate students and seniors
are urged to register now with the
Appointment Service which Stan
ford University maintains to assist
students and alumni in finding suit
able employment, Director Robert
N. Bush has announced.
"Whether or not you expect to
be looking for a position after
completing your studies," Dr.
Bush said in a letter now being
mailed to seniors and graduate
students, "this office can be of
service in assembling, for per
manent file, a set of confidential
recommendations from your pro
lessors."
He pointed out that many alumni,
who did not register, now find it
very difficult to establish records
"because those who once knew
them are no longer here, or remem
ber them only vaguely."
"Working in close co-operation
with the departments and schools
of the University," he said, "the
Appointment Scrvice maintains
wide contacts with employers,
many of whom come directly to
the campus in search of univer
sity-trained persons. Thus, the
Appointment Service is in a posi-.
lion to notify those registered
concerning employment opportu
nities."
Dr. Bush said he was particularly
anxious for all seniors and graduate
students to fill out and return the
postal card enclosed with the let
ters, which will give the Appoint
ment Scrvice an indication of the
number to be available for employ
ment in the various fields.
The Appointment Service is lo
cated in room 164, Ad Building.
