### 
Bids for the Sophomore Cotillion
will go on sale today at 1 p.m. at
the A.S.S.U. office for $5 a bid, Pres
ident Bob Stephens announced.
"Stairway to the Stars" is the
theme of the annual formal dance
to be held March 2 in the Pavilion.
Ted Fioßito and his orchestra will
supply the music for the Cotillion.
Sophomores are advised to get
their tickets early as there will
only be (>OO bids sold and the sale
will be opened to the entire cam
pus.
Fioßito and his orchestra recently
completed a tour of the Eastern
hotels and finished a successful en
gagement at the Meadowbrook in
Culver City, outside of Los Angeles.
Featuring stylized piano playing,
Fioßito has been known for his

sweet and soft music, according to
Stephens.
"While the dance will be for
mal, we want to stress the point
that suits are equally as suitable
for the occasion as tuxedos," Ste
phens said. "Many of the fellows
arc planning to wear suits, which
will be perfectly acceptable for
the evening," he added.
Sophomores have refused to dis
close the decorations they are plan
ning to use because of the novel
ideas they are working on.
Co-chairmen for the dance are
"Balis" Wilbur and Mike Min
chin. The two chairmen are
working under the direction of
the Soph Excom headed by Ste
phens and Secretary Marky Cleek.
Committee chairmen for the dance
are Barbara Carter, Bob Blum, Bill
Blaisdell, Anne Carter, Joan Bailey,
Bob Peck, Betty Callander, Breezy
Rosenthal, B. J. Fitger, Nancy
Sharp, Allen Burgi, Ed Hall, Dana
Fore, and Bob Ayres.
