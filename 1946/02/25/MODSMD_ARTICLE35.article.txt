# 'Y' Works with Red Cross in War Activity Program
## 
### JEAN BURNET 
Under the consistent leadership of
Nancy Banning, War Activities
chairman of the YWCA, Stanford
women have cooperated with the
Red Cross in providing entertain
ment for the patients at Dibble and
Veterans' Hospitals during the war
period.
In 1943 Miss Banning organized a
program to train USO junior hos
tesses. This series included four lec
tures concerning the problems fac
ing the average veteran, the psycho
logical aspect, the social adjustments
that have to be made, and the rela
tionship with married and engaged
men.
After the girls had attended these
lectures and had received a specified
number of hours of training, they
were issued cards which enabled
them ti serve in USO's throughout
the country. This program, which
was given whenever the need was
evident, was offered on the average
of every other quarter. Forty girls
turned out the first time, and 100
the second and third.
Entertain Veterans
At the outbreak of war, the YWCA
started first aid classes and other
necessary activities, but these duties
were delegated to the newly-formed
War Board, with which the "Y" co
operated.
Last quarter the girls entertained
World War II patients at the Vet
erans' Hospital once a month by
talking to them, playing cards with
them, and by accompanying group
singing on the piano. The girls were
also welcomed by the boys in the
wards who were unable to be up.
The "Y" asked the Red Cross to take
part in this program by furnishing
the transportation.
Recreation
On Christmas Eve 25 Stanford
women were hostesses, serving re
freshments after the Christmas show
at the hospital. On Jan. 23, 14 girls,
under the chairmanship of Miss
Banning helped the boys enjoy a
"Truth or Consequences" party fea
turing games, dancing, and singing.
Both of these parties were given for
the boys by the Red Cross.
In October and November of last
year 25 girls went to two dances
held at the Veterans' Hospital for
125 patients from this war. The "Y"
furnished the favors for these af
fairs, carrying out the Halloween
theme in October, while the No
vember decorations consisted of ser
pentine and crazy hats.
Dinner Dancer t
At Christmas and Thanksgiving

the YWCA brightened the hospitals
by painting bright posters.
One of the most successful forms
of entertainment turned out to be
the dinner dances held at Allied
Arts by the Red Cross for the blind
men at Dibble. Some of the houses
on campus later entertained these
boys themselves.
At present, although the demand
for girls to entertain patients has
lessened somewhat, Miss Banning
has a list of girls who are interested
in helping when a call comes in.
Summing up the experience of
serving in war activities, Miss Ban
ning speaks for all her helpers when
she says,"The girls have found that
it has been pleasure rather than
work, and they feel that they have j
received as much, or more, than they !
have given."
