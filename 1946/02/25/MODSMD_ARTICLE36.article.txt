# First Spar Tells Her Experiences
## 
### BETTY TALBOT 
On of the first anniversary of
Pearl Harbor three years ago, Doro
thy Tuttle became the first Spar in
the history of the Coast Guard.
"When I first put my uniform
on," explained Miss Tuttle, now a
student at Stanford, "I was stopped
everywhere by people who won
dered what branch of service I was
in. No one had ever seen a uni
form like mine."
Originally Chose Waves
The Waves had been her original
choice, but when she went to the
recruiting office to take her oath,
the officer asked her if she had ever
thought of the Spars, a newly-or
ganized branch of service, with as
yet no recruits.
Miss Tuttle agreed to join, not
knowing that she would be the first
member. It wasn't until reporters
and photographers besieged her with
questions that she found that she
was the first Spar.
Called lip Promptly
Although she was told that she
would not have to report for duty
for two months, the director of the
Spars, Lieutenant Commander Doro
thy C. Stratton called her in a few
days and asked her to come to the
office the following Saturday.
Not used to the military manner
of obeying without question, Miss
Tuttle replied, "Oh, but I have an
engagement. Could I make it Mon
day".'"
Orders Are Orders
Miss Stratton agreed however, and
when the new recruit appeared she
was asked to start working the next
day as Miss Stratton's secretary.
"But I have to work tomorrow,"

Miss Tuttle objected, still not real
izing that an older in the service is
an order.
"You're in the service now," the
director replied; "report tomorrow."
The two Spars were eventually
joined by a third, their executive
| officer. "Those pioneering days were
Ihe hardest," Miss Tuttle said, "but
it was interesting to watch the office
grow."
Boot Camp in the Biltmore
Although she had been appointed
yeoman third class, she was finally
sent to boot camp eight months af
ter joining the Spars. She went to
the Coast Guard training school at
Palm Beach, Florida, where she
lived at the Biltmore Hotel.
"It was a very peculiar situation,"
Miss Tuttle commented, "being there
with civilian girls, and trying to act
as much like the other girls as pos
sible, and once in a while getting
into trouble for it."
Californians Volunteered
While she was there, she became
platoon leader and later company
commander. "There were eight girls
there from California, and whenever
I wanted volunteers for a particular
job, all I had to do was mention Cali
fornia, and the Californians would
be right there ready to work."
When she had finished her train
ing, Miss Tuttle was ordered to Se
attle, her home town, where she
served as a storekeeper and as edi
tor of "Spar Soundings," the news
paper for Spars in Seattle.
Back to Florida
Palm Beach again became her ad
dress when she was sent to O.C.S.
After four months she was commis
sioned as ensign from the Pay and
Supply School, and returned to Se
attle as excutive officer and later
district property officer.
The hurricane season was in full
force when she was in Florida. Once
Miss Tuttle and the other cadets had
to keep an all night vigil during a
particularly bad one.
Feasted on K-Rations
"The gas mains were broken," she
added, "so the stoves wouldn't work.
We had to eat K-rations and I can
certainly sympathize with the men
overseas, because they weren't very
good."
When the war was over, Miss Tut
tle was eligible for discharge but
she stayed on for several months.
She came to Stanford this quarter
on inactive duty and was discharged
last month.
