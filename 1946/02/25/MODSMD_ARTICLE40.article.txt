# Greene Tells College Religious Problems
## 
### 
The main problem of religious life for people working at a university
is the reconciliation of religious faith with intellectual honesty, was the
opinion of Theodore M. Greene, visiting professor of humanities, when
he spoke last Tuesday night at Chapel Board meeting.
Enumerating some of the facets of this unit of faith and intellectual

I honesty, he said:
| 1 Genuine religious faith is
tolerant. It is never limited to
one sect or creed to the complete
, exclusion of all others. '
2) Faith comes out of genuine
need, not wishful thinking. If the
need is great, the search for an
honest faith will be sincere and
not self-righteous.
"Religion must be either diaboli
cally serious or angelically serious.
It is either the greatest hoax in the
world or the profoundest answer to
man's deepest need," Dr. Greene
continued.
"However, only those who seek
God will find Him. lie can't he
found through indifference or
neglect or if the need for Him is
not felt. To try to prove the ex
istence of God to a non-believer
is like trying to prove the exist
ence of human love to those who
have no need for it."
3) Faith must be based on evi
dence. This evidence can only be
the numbers of religious experi
ences which are observable even by
those who have not experienced it
themselves. The Christian religion
points to Christ as a unique being
in religious experience. In so far as
we accept his authority, we are
Christians.
Science itself depends on the
verified experience of others as
being authoritative. As scientists
accept each other's testimony, so
may we accept the authority of
those who have had genuine reli
gious experiences.
4) Religious faith is honest if
based on prayer, observance, disci
pline, thought, and action. "Our re
ligious life has lost its guts," Dr.
Greene said. "We expect to take
years of conscientious effort in pre
paring for a career in medicine or
law, and yet we grow weary of our
religious search after one unthink
ing hour in church a week.
!>) Faith will express itself in
humility and not in pride. We
dogmatically judge those who
vary our own beliefs and somc-
I times condemn even our own
' souls. We forget to leave judg-
I inrnt to God.
