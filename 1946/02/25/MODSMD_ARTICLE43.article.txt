# Stanford Grad Describes Red Cross Work in Natal
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
A glamorous picture of a dashing
Red Cross girl by the soldier's side
in the heat of battle has many times
overshadowed the equally necessary,
but not as widely publicized role of
Red Cross workers in non-eomba
tant areas. Such a task, as providing
recreation and amusement for rest
less, homesick soldiers stationed at
an air base at Natal, Brazil, fell to
Jane Harrington, a resident of Palo
Alto and a 1941 Stanford graduate.
After serving at the Presidio in
San Francisco and with the State
Department in Washington, Miss
Harrington joined the Red Cross
in 1045 and took her training
course as a staff assistant in the
nation's capital. Because of her
ability to speak Portuguese, the
native tongue of Brazil, she was
ordered to that South American
country.
Made First Flight
"The plane trip from Miami to Na
tal was all very exciting for me,
the first trip by air I had ever made,"
remarked Miss Harrington. The Red
Cross recruit caused quite a furor
during the night when she mistook
the exhaust from the plane for a
fire.
Miss Harrington and 25 other Red
Cross volunteers found Natal, the
hop-off point for European flights,
lacking in the color and pageantry
of other Brazilian towns. It was hot,
humid, and unclean.
Amused 10,000 Men *
It was the job of the Red Cross
volunteers, however, to provide
recreation for the 10.000 men as
signed to the air base. Amuse
ments took the form of picnics,
dances, swimming and birthday
parties. "And, of course, the Red
Cross' proverbial do nuts and cof
fee did much to make the men feel
a little nearer to home," Miss Har
rington stated.
The Red Cross workers served in
every capacity from sympathetic
listeners to judges in quiz shows and
baby contests. According to Miss
Harrington, their most important job
was just being there to talk to the
boys, letting them know that Red
Cross was right there with them.
Announced Radio Shows
The air base had many of the fea
tures of a well-organized commu
nity. Each night the Red Cross put

on a radio show of requested musi
cal numbers, Miss Harrington serv- !
ing as a part-time announcer. This
theatre of operations had its own |
newspaper, glee club, and even pro
duced its own musical show, the
score being written by one of Miss
Harrington's co-workers.
The living quarters for the Red
Cross girls and civilian women
workers were quite satisfactory," !
Miss Harrington commented.
"Our only complaint was that
there was no hot water." She ex
plained that even this difficulty
did not trouble them because one
didn't notice the cold being only
0 degrees from the equator.
Proud of Day Rooms
The pride of the Red Cross work
ers in Natal were the two day
rooms, one for the enlisted person
nel, the other for officers. The com
mander of the base, being especially
partial to the interests of the en
listed men, even turned over the offi
cers' room to be used for a club for
the enlisted personnel. The women
quickly commandeered potted palms
and wicker furniture and made cur
tains and upholstery for the new
club."It was a little disappoint
ing," laughingly admitted Miss Har
rington, "to see all the men at the
opening of the elub sitting around in
oily fatigues."
Blonde, attractive Miss Harring
ton remarked that she now knew
that too many dates were as had
as too few. The Red Cross girls
had to be very careful about dat
ing by showing no preference be
tween enlisted men and officers,
and by trying to include as many
men and girls as possible on a
date.
Required at Dances
The Red Cross girls were further
compelled to attend every dance
that was given on the base. "We
don't mind it at all," admitted Miss
Harrington, "until an Air Force band

moved into the area and there was
a dance everv night."
One of Miss Harrington's most in
teresting experiences was a visit to
the Brazilian penal colony, an is
land 230 miles ofT the coast. The
soldiers stationed on the island de
lighted in telling the Red Cross girls
of the horrors of the colony. "This
impressed us particularly at night
when we found out that the door of
our barracks would not lock," said
Miss Harrington. Many of the pris
oners bring their families to the is
land with them, earn wages by
working, and are sometimes able to
purchase their release.
The town of Natal itself offered
very little in the way of amuse
ments, except for drinking and
shopping, according to Miss Har
rington. Shopping was particu
larly popular because of the sup
ply of silk stockings. Men would
often bashfully ask the Red Cross
girls just what size stocking their
mother or girl friend would take.
Many of the boys received letters
from girls they had never met re
questing stockings.
Just "One of the Boys"
"All we Red Cross girls were quite
toughened down there," remarked
Miss Harrington. "The fact that we
were women was soon forgotten; the
boys literally made us 'one of the
boys.' "
But no matter how tired the Red
Cross girls were, they always
thought that there was something a
little more they could do for the
boys. It was a life they had not only
grown accustomed to, but loved.
"Red Cross became so much a part
of you," remarked Miss Harrington,
"that you felt guilty when you wena
to sleep."

that was given on the base. "We
don't mind it at all," admitted Miss
Harrington, "until an Air Force band

moved into the area and there was
a dance everv night."
One of Miss Harrington's most in
teresting experiences was a visit to
the Brazilian penal colony, an is
land 230 miles ofT the coast. The
soldiers stationed on the island de
lighted in telling the Red Cross girls
of the horrors of the colony. "This
impressed us particularly at night
when we found out that the door of
our barracks would not lock," said
Miss Harrington. Many of the pris
oners bring their families to the is
land with them, earn wages by
working, and are sometimes able to
purchase their release.
The town of Natal itself offered
very little in the way of amuse
ments, except for drinking and
shopping, according to Miss Har
rington. Shopping was particu
larly popular because of the sup
ply of silk stockings. Men would
often bashfully ask the Red Cross
girls just what size stocking their
mother or girl friend would take.
Many of the boys received letters
from girls they had never met re
questing stockings.
Just "One of the Boys"
"All we Red Cross girls were quite
toughened down there," remarked
Miss Harrington. "The fact that we
were women was soon forgotten; the
boys literally made us 'one of the
boys.' "
But no matter how tired the Red
Cross girls were, they always
thought that there was something a
little more they could do for the
boys. It was a life they had not only
grown accustomed to, but loved.
"Red Cross became so much a part
of you," remarked Miss Harrington,
"that you felt guilty when you wena
to sleep."
A glamorous picture of a dashing
Red Cross girl by the soldier's side
in the heat of battle has many times
overshadowed the equally necessary,
but not as widely publicized role of
Red Cross workers in non-eomba
tant areas. Such a task, as providing
recreation and amusement for rest
less, homesick soldiers stationed at
an air base at Natal, Brazil, fell to
Jane Harrington, a resident of Palo
Alto and a 1941 Stanford graduate.
After serving at the Presidio in
San Francisco and with the State
Department in Washington, Miss
Harrington joined the Red Cross
in 1045 and took her training
course as a staff assistant in the
nation's capital. Because of her
ability to speak Portuguese, the
native tongue of Brazil, she was
ordered to that South American
country.
Made First Flight
"The plane trip from Miami to Na
tal was all very exciting for me,
the first trip by air I had ever made,"
remarked Miss Harrington. The Red
Cross recruit caused quite a furor
during the night when she mistook
the exhaust from the plane for a
fire.
Miss Harrington and 25 other Red
Cross volunteers found Natal, the
hop-off point for European flights,
lacking in the color and pageantry
of other Brazilian towns. It was hot,
humid, and unclean.
Amused 10,000 Men *
It was the job of the Red Cross
volunteers, however, to provide
recreation for the 10.000 men as
signed to the air base. Amuse
ments took the form of picnics,
dances, swimming and birthday
parties. "And, of course, the Red
Cross' proverbial do nuts and cof
fee did much to make the men feel
a little nearer to home," Miss Har
rington stated.
The Red Cross workers served in
every capacity from sympathetic
listeners to judges in quiz shows and
baby contests. According to Miss
Harrington, their most important job
was just being there to talk to the
boys, letting them know that Red
Cross was right there with them.
Announced Radio Shows
The air base had many of the fea
tures of a well-organized commu
nity. Each night the Red Cross put

on a radio show of requested musi
cal numbers, Miss Harrington serv- !
ing as a part-time announcer. This
theatre of operations had its own |
newspaper, glee club, and even pro
duced its own musical show, the
score being written by one of Miss
Harrington's co-workers.
The living quarters for the Red
Cross girls and civilian women
workers were quite satisfactory," !
Miss Harrington commented.
"Our only complaint was that
there was no hot water." She ex
plained that even this difficulty
did not trouble them because one
didn't notice the cold being only
0 degrees from the equator.
Proud of Day Rooms
The pride of the Red Cross work
ers in Natal were the two day
rooms, one for the enlisted person
nel, the other for officers. The com
mander of the base, being especially
partial to the interests of the en
listed men, even turned over the offi
cers' room to be used for a club for
the enlisted personnel. The women
quickly commandeered potted palms
and wicker furniture and made cur
tains and upholstery for the new
club."It was a little disappoint
ing," laughingly admitted Miss Har
rington, "to see all the men at the
opening of the elub sitting around in
oily fatigues."
Blonde, attractive Miss Harring
ton remarked that she now knew
that too many dates were as had
as too few. The Red Cross girls
had to be very careful about dat
ing by showing no preference be
tween enlisted men and officers,
and by trying to include as many
men and girls as possible on a
date.

The Red Cross girls were further
compelled to attend every dance

nity. Each night the Red Cross put

on a radio show of requested musi
cal numbers, Miss Harrington serv- !
ing as a part-time announcer. This
theatre of operations had its own |
newspaper, glee club, and even pro
duced its own musical show, the
score being written by one of Miss
Harrington's co-workers.
The living quarters for the Red
Cross girls and civilian women
workers were quite satisfactory," !
Miss Harrington commented.
"Our only complaint was that
there was no hot water." She ex
plained that even this difficulty
did not trouble them because one
didn't notice the cold being only
0 degrees from the equator.
Proud of Day Rooms
The pride of the Red Cross work
ers in Natal were the two day
rooms, one for the enlisted person
nel, the other for officers. The com
mander of the base, being especially
partial to the interests of the en
listed men, even turned over the offi
cers' room to be used for a club for
the enlisted personnel. The women
quickly commandeered potted palms
and wicker furniture and made cur
tains and upholstery for the new
club."It was a little disappoint
ing," laughingly admitted Miss Har
rington, "to see all the men at the
opening of the elub sitting around in
oily fatigues."
Blonde, attractive Miss Harring
ton remarked that she now knew
that too many dates were as had
as too few. The Red Cross girls
had to be very careful about dat
ing by showing no preference be
tween enlisted men and officers,
and by trying to include as many
men and girls as possible on a
date.
Required at Dances
The Red Cross girls were further
compelled to attend every dance
that was given on the base. "We
don't mind it at all," admitted Miss
Harrington, "until an Air Force band

moved into the area and there was
a dance everv night."
One of Miss Harrington's most in
teresting experiences was a visit to
the Brazilian penal colony, an is
land 230 miles ofT the coast. The
soldiers stationed on the island de
lighted in telling the Red Cross girls
of the horrors of the colony. "This
impressed us particularly at night
when we found out that the door of
our barracks would not lock," said
Miss Harrington. Many of the pris
oners bring their families to the is
land with them, earn wages by
working, and are sometimes able to
purchase their release.
The town of Natal itself offered
very little in the way of amuse
ments, except for drinking and
shopping, according to Miss Har
rington. Shopping was particu
larly popular because of the sup
ply of silk stockings. Men would
often bashfully ask the Red Cross
girls just what size stocking their
mother or girl friend would take.
Many of the boys received letters
from girls they had never met re
questing stockings.
Just "One of the Boys"
"All we Red Cross girls were quite
toughened down there," remarked
Miss Harrington. "The fact that we
were women was soon forgotten; the
boys literally made us 'one of the
boys.' "
But no matter how tired the Red
Cross girls were, they always
thought that there was something a
little more they could do for the
boys. It was a life they had not only
grown accustomed to, but loved.
"Red Cross became so much a part
of you," remarked Miss Harrington,
"that you felt guilty when you wena
to sleep."
A glamorous picture of a dashing
Red Cross girl by the soldier's side
in the heat of battle has many times
overshadowed the equally necessary,
but not as widely publicized role of
Red Cross workers in non-eomba
tant areas. Such a task, as providing
recreation and amusement for rest
less, homesick soldiers stationed at
an air base at Natal, Brazil, fell to
Jane Harrington, a resident of Palo
Alto and a 1941 Stanford graduate.
After serving at the Presidio in
San Francisco and with the State
Department in Washington, Miss
Harrington joined the Red Cross
in 1045 and took her training
course as a staff assistant in the
nation's capital. Because of her
ability to speak Portuguese, the
native tongue of Brazil, she was
ordered to that South American
country.
Made First Flight
"The plane trip from Miami to Na
tal was all very exciting for me,
the first trip by air I had ever made,"
remarked Miss Harrington. The Red
Cross recruit caused quite a furor
during the night when she mistook
the exhaust from the plane for a
fire.
Miss Harrington and 25 other Red
Cross volunteers found Natal, the
hop-off point for European flights,
lacking in the color and pageantry
of other Brazilian towns. It was hot,
humid, and unclean.
Amused 10,000 Men *
It was the job of the Red Cross
volunteers, however, to provide
recreation for the 10.000 men as
signed to the air base. Amuse
ments took the form of picnics,
dances, swimming and birthday
parties. "And, of course, the Red
Cross' proverbial do nuts and cof
fee did much to make the men feel
a little nearer to home," Miss Har
rington stated.
The Red Cross workers served in
every capacity from sympathetic
listeners to judges in quiz shows and
baby contests. According to Miss
Harrington, their most important job
was just being there to talk to the
boys, letting them know that Red
Cross was right there with them.

nity. Each night the Red Cross put
