basketball encounter last Friday
night in the Pavilion. Using a fast
break, and employing some of the
best ball-handling seen in this court
this season, the Broncos were never
in doubt of victory. The issue was
how close we would come.
Starling out fast, the 18-mile
awuy college ran lip a !)-() lead be
fore most fans got comfortably
seated. Stanford whittled down
the score a little, but the half-time
marker showed Santa Clara ahead
by a 31) to 15 margin.
The second half started out with
Stanford scoring four consecutive
points, and the faint possibility of a

victory appeared, but that hazy vis- |
ion soon disappeared when the San- .
ta boys started hitting the bucket |
with accuracy plus.
Leading the opposition attack was
Dave Mariani, a diminutive forward,
but plenty clever with the ball. He j
scored 14 points. Tied for second
place honors were Ahem and Holm,
who both scored 10 points apiece.
Leading the Stanford parade of
scorers were John Muir, Tom Mur- '
phy, and Bill O'Brien, who all col
! lected six points. Bill Christianson
J didn't play, as he was declared in- J
