Friday night rang down the cur
tain on local basketball. Only one
more game is on the roster for the
Cards, and that game will be played
in San Francisco Wednesday night
against the USF Dons, who whipped
the locals in a previous hook-up.
Well sprinkled with former prep
stars in Ihe bay area, George
Barsi's Broncos showed up well in
putting down the Indians in their
last home appearance for the sea
son. Handling the ball extremely
well, the only thing lacking by
the opponents was height, but
since that is one department that
coaches have no control over, the
broncos will have to be content
with the team as it is.
It was rather difficult explaining
to one spectator why there were
more Santa Clara students at the
game than Indian rooters. There
weren't THAT many Farm colleg
iates celebrating Washington's birth
day out of town.

There are two topics that are pres
ently undergoing a battering in re
gard to the Olympic Games, which
will be held in London in '48. the
election year.
One thorny issue is whether to
allow Soviet athletes to compete
or not because of the financial bo
nuses given them by the state for
showing off their athletic prowess
to the home-town folks. Olympic
competitors are supposed to be
all of the simon - pure variety,
meaning they never accept more
than a slice of bread to chew on
before the big race.
But everyone knows that ama
teurs are not so amateurish as might
be expected. There are a number
of ways that are used to get around
being called an out-and-out profes
sional. "Traveling expense" ac
counts is one way. Another way is
to conspicuously show off some ath
letic goods that by fortuitous cir
cumstance are placed in the hands of
the innocent lad who plays some
game for the mere love of it all.
If the above is the situation in the
U.S., it's hardly fair to look disdain
fully on the Russians, who merely
make public all the bookkeeping that
is done. Of course it might be hard
to draw the line between a pro ath
lete and an amateur athlete in Rus
sia.
If the up-and-coming Moscov
ite is given a howl of borsch for
his afternoon performance in the
stadium, he could he called an
amateur, without any hoodwinks,
but if a couple bottles of vodka
and some caviar were given him
to take to Momma and Poppa,
would he then be a professional?
You see the complications.
But seriously, this writer hopes
that Soviet athletes are allowed to
participate in the Olympics. The
events would have more of an in
ternational scope; competition would
be keener, and goodwill would be
cemented among athletes of the
whole world.
Russian officials should he ad
vised of the desirability of keep
ing the Olympics on strictly an
amateur basis, and that point
should be kept in mind when giv
ing bonuses to their athletes here
after. If these bonuses don't turn

into regular pay checks, Russians
shouldn't be barred from competi
tion.
Knotty issue number two is
whether to allow German and Japa
nese performers to compete in the
games. The point that those two
countries were defeated in the war,
and that they should be taught their
place before they are allowed to
compete wilh "civilized men" is
brought up.
To this writer, that is so much
hog-wash, and nothing more. If
"what side you fought on in the
war" is to be the governing stand
ards for entrance into the Olympic
panics, what about Italian athletes?
Despite their apathetic showing in
the war, they did fight on the Axis
side. And what about Finnish ath
letes? No mention of them is made,
yet they fought against the Allies.
And Spanish athletes? You can't
count that country as a bona fide
contributor to the Axis defeat.
No, we feel that German and
Japanese ought to be allowed to
compete in the Olympics. Nothing
could be gained not letting them
compete. Yet. the possibilities of
letting them participate are great.
The same case as that advanced
for letting the Russians compete
could be advanced for Germans
and Japanese* keener competi-*
tion, good will feelings, and finer
athletes are just a few of the
points.
There are too many other fields in
which to impress them of their de
feat. Athletics doesn't have to be
one of them. If we had lost the war,
we could have been sure of an
"Axis-field" of athletes only. Let's
not pull a reversal with the boots
on our feet.
It won't benecessary for Henry
Benjamin (Hank) Greenberg to
worry about such petty financial dif
ficulties as to whether he should hold
out for $65,000 instead of inking the
contract for $60,000. Milyuns and
milyuns face him now, with his
marriage into the Gimbel family.
