Other schools besides Stanford
are preparing for their spring sports
season. At U.C.L.A., 50 track aspi
rants have turned out to Coach
Harry Trotter, who announced their
track season is scheduled to get un
der way on March 1(5.
U.C.L.A. is in the same predica
ment that most other schools are in
this season: lack of seasoned mate
rial. Of the hall a hundred men
who donned the spiked shoes, only
| two can sport varsity letters from
I the previous season. Frosh and
transfers are being depended on to
J pull the squad through this year.
The two leltermen are hurdler
I)on Nelson and discus heaver
Johnny Rdwards. Captain of the
i squad is Stan Cerro, a lift man,
who was named to captain the
| team in '42. hut was ushered into
the armv before he had a chance
! to show his cinder path wares.

K*?n Solid, the grid convert, is
Wgstwood's big sprint hope, al
though he is being pushed by Bill
Zuke. former Midwestern decathlon
man, who can hit 10 flat and 2i
seconds in the dashes, 49 feet in the
shot put. 145 feet in tho discus, and
six feet in the high jump.
"U. of C."—Los Angeles annex
—is hoping that Sgt. Don Barks
dale is released from the Army in
time to get in shape for the track
marathons this spring. Barksdale
high-jumps at the good figure of
(! feet 7, broad-uimps over 24 feet,
and speeds through the century
yard dash in 10 seconds.
The rest of the squad is rounded
out by inexperienced men, but out
of the lot Coach "Trot" expects to
find a few stars —or at least he
hopes so.
