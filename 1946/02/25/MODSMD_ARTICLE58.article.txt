# Joe E. Brown Relates Tours
## 
### MARTHA SCHWIMLEY 
In an atmosphere of grease paint
and stage props, Joe E. Brown, the
man with the big mouth and big
heart, talked with real earnestness
last week about the "American boys
who fought for us." Seated in his
dressing room at the Geary Theater,
San Francisco, Brown related his ex
periences overseas.
The famous comedian spent the
past four years entertaining service
men in the combat zones of the
South Pacific, and the China-Bur
ma-India area. He now makes em
phatic statements about what he

Kr.iv,', and what the American people
can do about it.
Visited Hospitals
Biown visited many hospitals in
his long journeys overseas. He
talked to men who were wounded
mentally as well as physically, and
he saw the need for psychological
help to hasten their recovery.
The Red Cross is supplying the
proper treatment for those boys, he
said. The organization's workers are
teaching the wounded servicemen
the art of craft, to occupy their
minds. Many of the boys will be
able to develop this crafts work into
a financial help or even a career, |
stated Brown.
Trained Red Cross
The comedian emphasized the no- !
cessity of recruiting the right kind !
of person to work with the conva
lescent servicemen—a person who is
trained to calm a battle-fatigued
mind. The Red Cross supplies these
people and must go on supplying
them.
"This is the duty that we owe the
boys—to see that they are taken care
of until they can take care of them- <
selves." Brown does a great deal of
thinking and talking about the
American boy. He has helped thou
sands of American boys in the front
lines forget the war for a few min
utes. He is now working to prevent
the American people from forgetting
the war a second.
Bark to Normal
Officially the war is not over, said
Brown, yet already people have
turned their minds to thoughts of
normalcy and life in the good old
way. The boys who are ill or handi
capped, the boys who are still over
seas, must face a new way of life.
The Red Cross can help them in
peacetime as well as during war.
Red Cross overseas canteens and
clubs save American servicemen
from boredom and are a decent in
fluence on the boys, declared Brown.
He laughingly told an incident that
happened to him in North Africa.
Camelburger for Lunch
The entertainer had finished a
group of shows, and was rushing
with his companions to catch a plane
that was to take them 1,100 miles
away to another American base.
Brown had not eaten in nine hours,
and on his way to the plane he
caught sight of a tiny hut—a Red
Cross club. He insisted on going in
to get some food. The hamburger
which the Red Cross worker gave
him "'tasted better than anything I
had ever eaten." He found out later
that he had consumed a camelbur
ger—a delicacy of North Africa.
Service Tours
Brown traveled alone on most of
his four trips to the western bases,
but he took four boys with him on i
his last tour, which covered the !

•
Philippines. His rules for entertain
ment were that it be funny, no
preaching, and that it be clean. Be
sides touring China, Burma, and In
dia, he stopped in 28 different coun
[ tries including (he South American
states, Algeria, Morocco, and Egypt.
A Joe E. Brown act that received
some of the loudest laughs overseas
was a baseball pantomime. Brown,
j an ex-player for the New York Yan
! kees, was giving this performance
j on a small Philippine island. During
J the show, a group of servicemen in
| vestigating the shrill laughter com
[ ing from a tree in back of the audi
| ence, discovered a Jap soldier sitting
I there enjoying the performance as
j much as any of the Yanks,
j "Harvey"
He informed his captors that he
had sneaked across the lines to see
i the great Joe E. Later, Brown dis
covered that a great many Japs
laughed louder at the baseball act
than the Americans.
The large-mouthed comedian, who
! is now starring in San Francisco's
production of "Harvey," has a strong
faith in American boys and often
j expresses his gratitude to the vet
| erans of World War 11. He stresses
j the fact that these boys must not
be forgotten, and helping the Red
Cross is one way to continue help
ing them, Joe E. Brown, entertainer
and patriot, summed up his' ideas
when he said, "Give the American
boy a chance to be right and he will
not be wrong."
