(Editorial)
Just because the surrender has been signed with Ger
many and Japan don't think that any one of us can let up
in our support of the Red Cross and its far-flung activities.
As firm proof that the Red Cross itself hasn't let up, we
offer this story, heard yesterday about a Red Cross "post-,
war" worker.
Shortly after V-J Day she and one other girl were
flown into Okinawa. With helmets, flashlights, and K
rations to live by, with supply depots frugally stocked
and distantly placed to work with, the girls began their
job. In a few months, she saw the island gain a rest cen
ter and a club, supplying movies and shows and relaxa
tion for war-weary Gl's. She recounted in letters many
dawn-to-dawn contributions, necessary in fulfilling her
job with the Red Cross "at his side."
On Christmas Day, at 29 years of age, she died and
was buried on Okinawa. Her citation listed the cause of
her death: overwork.â€”B. M. V.and M. S.
