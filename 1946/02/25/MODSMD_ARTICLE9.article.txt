# YOU Are the Red Cross
## 
### 
Dear Stanford People:
Your Red Cross is glad you're back. We thought we'd
never see anything nicer than the soldiers on the Stan
ford swimming bleachers, Saturday after V-J Day, sprawl
ing in khaki in the sun, but with a new I'm-a-human-be
ing-again look on their faces.
But it's nicer to see you packing books instead of ma
chine guns, being lectured at instead of briefed, thumbing
a ride to the movies instead of climbing into a plane or a
jeep. We thought we'd never hear anything more glorious
than the siren wailing and roaring on V-J Day from the top
of the Tower.
You're back and safe, and Red Cross would like to build
every one of you a house, digest all your courses for you,
and ask your worst professors to a lovely, mellowing din
ner before exams. And not ask you to contribute to a
Red Cross Drive. Not any one of you, returned veteran,
would-be veteran, veteran of the home front.
But we do ask you, because you're the Red Cross your
selves—and Americans. You've won the war, you're
what it's all for, but you aren't through either. Not while
one man is not home yet, or is in the hogpital, or has vet
eran-troubles that no red tape can solve but that the Red
Cross can cut. You want those troopships met in San
Francisco and New York by Red Cross women with hot
coffee and milk and doughnuts. (We know they are, for
Palo Alto women help do it.)
You want the men, blinded in one eye, to be taught to
drive again by Motor Corps women. You want Red Cross
women to help the men in hospital beds make things
with their hands—not important things—fishing flies,
leather gadgets, drawings, model planes, ash trays—but
vitally important nevertheless for mending muscles, and
for morale. You want the man immobilized between opera
tions to have his letters written for him, his shopping done,
books read to him. You want the man with his face
burned and scarred and being remade to have a Red
Cross woman drop in and talk to him, till he gets used to
people looking at him. You want a man already sick, and
sicker with worry over his family's health or money, to
have some kind and effective woman take it in hand, write,
wire or cable and get him a home report from another
woman just like her in some other chapter.
There's a Palo Alto kid, just 18, in Germany now—a
bright kid, with a Stanford scholarship and some high
school track records in his pocket. He writes his mother
in the Palo Alto Red Cross that he'd lose his mind if it
weren't for the Red Cross Club in his town. Almost noth
ing to do, no trouble with passes—and no place to go.
Nothing to buy to eat —the Germans want to hang on to
what they have; movies are cold and dirty and in Ger
man anyway. A place to dance, to lounge in, to write in,
to get non-Army food, to talk in, makes him feel like an
American. For kids like him, for men you know who have
got through the war and are still taking it, you want to
keep the Red Cross Clubs overseas; keep clubmobiles
with their music, magazines and books; keep tours and
trips and fishing expeditions going; keep recreation and
home-service going; keep home close to them.
In your Red Cross drive, 1946, you're shooting at your
full wartime quota, your own choice. You don't know
what a cheer that is to us, your working Red Cross, who
know, too, that the war's not over. You'll make it. Put
one hand in your pocket, and one in your heart.

There's a Palo Alto kid, just 18, in Germany now—a
bright kid, with a Stanford scholarship and some high
school track records in his pocket. He writes his mother
in the Palo Alto Red Cross that he'd lose his mind if it
weren't for the Red Cross Club in his town. Almost noth
ing to do, no trouble with passes—and no place to go.
Nothing to buy to eat —the Germans want to hang on to
what they have; movies are cold and dirty and in Ger
man anyway. A place to dance, to lounge in, to write in,
to get non-Army food, to talk in, makes him feel like an
American. For kids like him, for men you know who have
got through the war and are still taking it, you want to
keep the Red Cross Clubs overseas; keep clubmobiles
with their music, magazines and books; keep tours and
trips and fishing expeditions going; keep recreation and
home-service going; keep home close to them.
In your Red Cross drive, 1946, you're shooting at your
full wartime quota, your own choice. You don't know
what a cheer that is to us, your working Red Cross, who
know, too, that the war's not over. You'll make it. Put
one hand in your pocket, and one in your heart.

Dear Stanford People:
Your Red Cross is glad you're back. We thought we'd
never see anything nicer than the soldiers on the Stan
ford swimming bleachers, Saturday after V-J Day, sprawl
ing in khaki in the sun, but with a new I'm-a-human-be
ing-again look on their faces.
But it's nicer to see you packing books instead of ma
chine guns, being lectured at instead of briefed, thumbing
a ride to the movies instead of climbing into a plane or a
jeep. We thought we'd never hear anything more glorious
than the siren wailing and roaring on V-J Day from the top
of the Tower.
You're back and safe, and Red Cross would like to build
every one of you a house, digest all your courses for you,
and ask your worst professors to a lovely, mellowing din
ner before exams. And not ask you to contribute to a
Red Cross Drive. Not any one of you, returned veteran,
would-be veteran, veteran of the home front.
But we do ask you, because you're the Red Cross your
selves—and Americans. You've won the war, you're
what it's all for, but you aren't through either. Not while
one man is not home yet, or is in the hogpital, or has vet
eran-troubles that no red tape can solve but that the Red
Cross can cut. You want those troopships met in San
Francisco and New York by Red Cross women with hot
coffee and milk and doughnuts. (We know they are, for
Palo Alto women help do it.)
You want the men, blinded in one eye, to be taught to
drive again by Motor Corps women. You want Red Cross
women to help the men in hospital beds make things
with their hands—not important things—fishing flies,
leather gadgets, drawings, model planes, ash trays—but
vitally important nevertheless for mending muscles, and
for morale. You want the man immobilized between opera
tions to have his letters written for him, his shopping done,
books read to him. You want the man with his face
burned and scarred and being remade to have a Red
Cross woman drop in and talk to him, till he gets used to
people looking at him. You want a man already sick, and
sicker with worry over his family's health or money, to
have some kind and effective woman take it in hand, write,
wire or cable and get him a home report from another
woman just like her in some other chapter.
