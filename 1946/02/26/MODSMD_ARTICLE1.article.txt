# Tuesday Series To Hear Sonata Recital Tonight
## 
### 
Two celebrated' musicians, Alex
ander Schneider, violinist, and
Ralph Kirkpatrick, harpsichordist,
return to Stanford for a concert to
night at 7:30 in the auditorium of
Memorial Hall.
The recital of sonatas is part.of
the regular Tuesday Evening Series
and will be open to the public free
of charge.
The two artists, who appeared at
Stanford in August, 1944, while on
a transcontinental tour, long have
been noted for their performances
of chamber music. Schneider was,
until recently, a member of the
Budapest Quartet, and Kirkpatrick,
both in solo recital and ensemble
programs, is recognized as Ameri
ca's most eminent harpsichordist.
To Play Bach, Mozart Sonatas
Colaboration of these two men
has made it possible, almost for the
first time, to hear some of the finest
eighteenth - century music in the
peculiarly sensitive and lively col
ors in which it was conceived, and
which have never been set forth
adequately by the modern piano.
Two compositions by Mozart. So
nata in F Major and Sonata in D
Major, and Sonata in E Minor by
Bach will be presented during the
recital, in addition to Five Sonatas
for Harpsichord by Scarlatti.
Have Won Great Acclaim
Schneider and Kirkpatrick have
received enthusiastic acclaim on
their national tours. Here are some
typical press comments:
"Kirkpatrick and Schneider know
the business of sonata playing as
very few such teams have known
it in my time. The foremost char
acteristic of their playing is its ut
ter transparency and clarity. Their
textures and rhythms are flawless,
and every phase is carefully chis

clcd to its most perfect proportions.
All in all, they are not to be
missed."—Alfred Frankenstein, San
Francisco Chronicle
More Press Comments
"They produced one of the hap
piest musical evenings this critic
has spent in a long time."—Noel
Straus, New York Times
". . . one of the season's major
events . . . the rare emotional de
lineation, the admiral attacks, the
extraordinary rhythmic life, the
perfect unanimity of last night's
artists." — Arthur V. Berger, New
York Sun
"This was a concert to remember.
Everything about it, which includes
the program, the instruments, the
performers, and the integration of
all these factors into a musical real
ity of unimpeachable artistic qual
ity, was memorable." — Rudolph
Elie, Jr., Boston Herald
. . exquisiteness and perfection
rarely encountered in this fallible
world. Certainly theirs is a unique
combination, not to be missed."—
