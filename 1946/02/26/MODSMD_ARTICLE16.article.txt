# Court Limits Martial Law

WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 (UP).—
The Supreme Court ruled today
that martial Jaw does not give mili
tary authorities the right to usurp
the functions of civil courts —even
in wartime.
It held, in effect, that suspension
of the writ of habeas corpus in Ha
waii in 1944 was illegal.*
6-2 Decision Given
It so ruled in ordering the army
to set free two civilian residents in
Hawaii who were tried and con
victed by military tribunals for of
fenses normally under civil juris
diction.
Martial law in Hawaii was lifted
after V-J Day.
The high court's G-to-2 decision
was written by Justice Hugo L.
Black, who said that Congress, in
authorizing martial law under the
organic act for the government of
Hawaii, "did not wish to exceed the
boundaries between military and
civilian power."
Martial Law Misinterpreted
"The phrase 'martial law' . . .
while intended to authorize the
military to act vigorously for the
maintenance of an orderly civil
government and for the defense of
the island against actual or threat
ened rebellion or invasion, was not
intended to authorize the supplant
ing of courts by military tribunals,"
Black wrote.
He held that the American sys
tem of government "clearly is the
antithesis of total military rule and
the founders of this country arc not
likely to have contemplated com
plete military dominance within the
limits of a territory made part of
this country and not recently taken
from the enemy."
