Somebody seems to have found a whole
school of red herring to drag across the paths
of international relations.
The Canadian international spy episode
has been brought to light and treated by the
press with great relish. Persons who have
rif;ver grown up digest happily the scanty
facts padded with a lot of colorful newspaper
hints of melodrama. And it is hard to force
ourselves to realize that we cannot judge the
importance or significance of the spy devel
op..:;.us on the basis of the limited infirma
tion 011 the subject which we can give.
It's a universal tendency to snap up the
news, however incomplete it is, hastily, and
sometimes unconsciously, so that we may

use it for our own ends. The Moscow press
has had a field day interpreting the Canadian
investigation as a pressure deal, contrived by
British Foreign Secretary Bavin and Canada's
Prime Minister MacKenzie King, to take the
spotlight off what Moscow described as Bev
in's defeat in the recent UNO debates. Prav
da commented, "King's game is doomed to
failure."
It doesn't hurt to watch out for those red
herring. They come in the size of a small
diplomatic event, dressed to look like a big
one, or a big event, dressed to look like a
small one. Whatever the size, the persons
who throw them out would like nothing bet
ter than for you to mistake them to be the
cnly fish in the sea.
