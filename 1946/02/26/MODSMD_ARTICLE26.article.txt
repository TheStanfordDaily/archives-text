# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
To tho Editor:
The By-laws of the Associated Students con
cerning Publications Council provide that "the
Stanford Daily shall be the official publication of
ili > Associated Students of Stanford University."
(Art. IV, Sec. 1, a.)
The main purpose of such a publication, it seems
to us, is to present adequate information concerning
campus affairs so that students may form their own
conclusions after reading facts fairly presenting
both sides oi any issue.
Although the students working on the Daily
have every right to their own opinions, they have
an obligation to the student body to give an un

biased presentation of any given situation. No such
impartial approach lias been presented in the Daily
concerning the current vote on the Constitution.
Editorials may favor one side of an issue, for it is
the editor's prerogative to express his opinion on
this matter; however, title space (flag) should not
be used to carry such instructions as "Vote Yes on
No. 1 Today."
Sincerely,
Joan McDonough K. J. Supple
Charmian Kolar Marie Wagner
