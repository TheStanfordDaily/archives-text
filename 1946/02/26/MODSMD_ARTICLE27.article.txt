Have you noticed that new hand lotion and skin
invigo rator—Atomic Balm?
The makers of Atom Balm, as it is known in the
trade, are at present dickering with the Stanford
Student Asso iation for Atomic Control, attempt
ing to get the- S.A.A.C. to endorse their concoction.
They le'l that with the influence and support
of i«• Atomic Group behind them there are no
bound., to what might be done with Atom Balm.
Some unofficial research has been done on the
e!h Ms of Atomic Balm when taken internally, and
the reports indicate that it has quite a kick. With
the right sort of publicity it might replace Vitalis
as the on-cumou"! stimulant.

Don't know whether the architect who fathered

the Library was a reader of John Buchan or not,
but there are 39 steps leading up to the second
floor. All right, count 'em yourself.

Have noticed that when the sun is just right
the glare from the captain's bars on the shoulders
of one of our classmates hits our prof right in the
eyes.
We think it would be gentlemanly of this erst
while officer if he would either take his uniform
off during class hours or sit in the back of the room
where the glitter won't distract the other students.
Naturally we don't mind seeing an occasional
pair of combat boots, or suntan pants, or A-2 jacket
sported "on Quad," but the whole uniform complete
with blouse and victory medal makes us want to
throw one—a salute, that is.
