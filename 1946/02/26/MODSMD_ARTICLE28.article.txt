# HISTORY â€” 1946

### ELLIOTT EPSTEEN 
This is the time of the great atom bomb race.
Tht recent Canadian trouble shows that. The un
lortunate thing about the whole situation Ls that
th? wrong people might come in right behind us.
The world has two roads to security, through
1 jiking on everybody being too afraid of atoms to
t trouble, and by hoping against hope for the
UNO to work.
While the first road is perilous and desperately
uncertain, the second has demonstrated itself to be
not much better. The charming debating society
which now sits in London seems to have dedicated
itself to the policy of pigeonholing disputes rather
than settling them, and to preserving its muster roll
rather than doing what it was organized to do.
HOPE
For a state that has atom bombs, there is some
hope that nobody will destroy its industry for fear
of retaliation. The ruin of steel mills, oil fields, and
machine shops by an atomic war certainly isn't go
ing to make a nation richer, or in a better strategic
position.
But what about a nation that doesn't have atom
bombs to strike back with?
ATOMIC AGGRESSION
Now. if Russia got the atom bomb before China
did, what would prevent her from dumping one
on each Chinese industrial city, and telling us, "If
you want an atomic war, you can do something
about it." Our politicians seem frightened half out
of their wits by a bombless Russia. What would
they do in that situation?
Or, what is to prevent Franco from blowing up
Paris, or Peron from destroying Rio de Janeiro, if
they got the bombs ahead of their neighbors?
WRONG NATIONS HAVE LEAD
A democracy, which is run by the people, who
have some reasonable facsimile of a code of ethics
; nd quite a few inhibitions, would be a safe place
for an atom bomb. It is difficult to conceive of
France, Belgium, Switzerland, Uruguay, or the

Scandinavian states using the atom bomb except
in their own defense.

But a dictatorship, run by ruthless, unscrupu
lous, and even stupid tyrants, is a different story.
If they got the secret before their neighbors there
is no telling how many people might be killed.
Unfortunately, the dictators have a slight edge
in the race.
TOTALITARIAN STATES
Russia has a lot of technical minds in her own
right, and a great deal of hydroelectric power and
raw materials. She is importing German technical
minds, which were not far from the secret them
selves.
Franco has large but undeveloped uranium
fields in his country, and a lot of German labora
tories set up wliere they would be safe front* our
bombs. More German technicians have come to
him in hopes of being safe from Allied justice.
Peron, who probably also has a lot of German
technicians, controls a country that is far ahead
of its neighbors industrially. If any nation in South
America gets the atom bomb in the next few years,
the odds are that it will be Argentina.
SOLUTION
By keeping the atom bomb from those who need
it and by probably being afraid to use it them
selves, our so-called statesmen might be sealing
the doom of millions of human beings.
If the bomb is turned over to the UNO, it will
be give to an arguing, babbling, inert mass that
will produce a lot of high-sounding compromises,
but no action in case of trouble.
True, a UNO with the bomb might be a UNO
with teeth, but with rival national self-interests
operative, it would also be an organization with no
jaw muscles to use them.
It seems that our duty to humanity right now
could best be served by giving bombs, plans for
them, and factories to build them to highly ad
vanced democratic and peaceful nations which, in
the next few years, might certainly need them.
