# 40 Singers Selected For Chorus of 'Magic Flute'
## 
### 
Mozart's opera "The Magic' Flute"
will be presented by the Stanford
Players in association with the Di
vision of Music March 7, 8, and 9,

ruses ever to be assembled on the
stage of the Memorial Hall, if stu
dent turnout is at all indicative.
Over one hundred students tried
out lor positions in the chorus and
from these Dr. Jan Popper, direc
tor of the production, selected forty
singers.
The chorus has been holding
regular rehearsals all this quarter

and has now begun the work of
staging (he numbers. The cho
rus in 'The Magic Flute" has a
very important contribution to
make to the opera because (hey
have two important numbers to
sing at the climax of each of the
two acts. In addition, (he men's
chorus sings the famous chorus
of the priests.
Comic Opera
In spite of the semi-religious set
ting of "The Magic Flute," it is a
comic Opera, telling the story of the
trials and tests to which Tamino
and Papageno must submit to join
the order of Isis and Osiris. One of
these tests is that they must prom
ise not to speak to anyone, espe
cially women. This leads to some
of the comic as well as to some of
tho serious situations upon which
the opera is based.
