# Hargrove Film Reviewer Hopes for Series' Finish
## 
### 
WHAT NEXT, CORPORAL lIAR
GROVE? — Now playing at the
Stanford Theater.
There's probably nothing . you'd
rather see less at this date than a !
war - time comedy full of stupid I
corporals and bull-headed sergeants |
hurling orders/and soldierly exple
tives at on« 3 another. Such is the |
situation that prevails, however, in I
M-G-M's "What Next, Corporal !

Hargrove?"—the second and I hope
last in the series.
This time Hargrove (Robert
Walker), an acting corporal, is
wandering around in France during
the invasion. After a couple of
slapsticky reels during which he
becomes entangled with a petite
French mademoiselle (whos? ac
ccnt is about as genuine as Hilde
garde's), Hargrove is assigned to
the occupation forces, where he
promptly goes A.W.O.L. to the de
light of certain elements of the
audience.
Lacks Unified Plot
"What Next. Corporal Hargrove?"
—as you've probably gathered by
now—lacks a unified plot and much
of its purported humor is painfully
strained. It's a pretty sickening ex
perience, saved only in isolated in
stances by Keenan Wynn's con
mannish antics.
The companion feature, "She
Went to the Races,'' will be ol in
terest to those of you who are fas
cinated by the financial aspect of
horse-racing. The film deals with
the efforts of a group of colege pro
fessors to beat the races • scientifi
cally, as these esteemed scholars
must raise $20,000 to save one of
their colleagues from losing his job.
All Ends Happily
The good professors pore over the
dope sheet and finally devise a
"system." In the meantime, Fran
ces Gifford and James Craig carry
on a limpid, morning-after romance
that culminates with the pair put
ting their life-savings on the right
horse. As a result the professors
get their $20,000, Miss Gift'ord and
Mr. Craig get married, and you get
left holding a theater-ticket stub
that's worth absolutely nothing.—

—as you've probably gathered by
now—lacks a unified plot and much
of its purported humor is painfully
strained. It's a pretty sickening ex
perience, saved only in isolated in
stances by Keenan Wynn's con
mannish antics.
The companion feature, "She
Went to the Races,'' will be ol in
terest to those of you who are fas
cinated by the financial aspect of
horse-racing. The film deals with
the efforts of a group of colege pro
fessors to beat the races • scientifi
cally, as these esteemed scholars
must raise $20,000 to save one of
their colleagues from losing his job.
All Ends Happily
The good professors pore over the
dope sheet and finally devise a
"system." In the meantime, Fran
ces Gifford and James Craig carry
on a limpid, morning-after romance
that culminates with the pair put
ting their life-savings on the right
horse. As a result the professors
get their $20,000, Miss Gift'ord and
Mr. Craig get married, and you get
left holding a theater-ticket stub
that's worth absolutely nothing.—
