# Youngest Vet Studies Law
## 
### 
Stanford's candidate for the
youngest veteran university grad
uate student in the nation is 20-
year-old Jordan N. Peekham of San
Francisco.
Peekham, now in his second
quarter of study in the Graduate
School of Law, must have had to
move along rapidly to get through
four years of undergraduate work
and take time out to serve in the
army. Here is how it was done:
Medical Discharge
Peekham, while a student at
I Stanford, enlisted in the army be
> fore his 18th birthday in 1943. He
, went to the Presidio of Mont?rey
i for induction July 5, 1943, after
completing his sophomore year. His
| army career proved to be a "sum
j tner vacation" for him because he
was given a medical discharge on
Sopt. 24. 1943. before completing in
l tiantry basic training at Camp Rob
: erts, Calif.
He returned to Stanford just in
time to start his junior year at the
end of September, 1943, and gradu
i ated with an A.B. degree in pre
law in June, 1545.
No GI Fights
Young Peekham has to foot his
I own education bill, unlike most vet
erans those days. He only served 82
j days and fails by eight days to
â–  qualify for the benefits of the GI
1 Bill of Rights.
