# Farkas Traces History Of Farm Track Mentors
## 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
Those' of us who have been read
ing sports pages for the past 20
years or so may have noticed, but
probably didn't, a curious trend in
the realm of field and fack.
In these two decades, the West
Coast has successfully launched an
invasion on the track world, and
even more successfully maintained
its domination over runners, throw
ers, and jumpers from the rest of
the national domain and the world.
Western Schools Dominate
With not more than two or
three exceptions at most, three
Western schools have placed with
the first four teams in either the
1.C.4-A. or N.C.A.A. (the "World
Series" of track). Of those three
schools, California. Southern Cal
(N.C.A.A. champs for the past
nine ye«rs). and Stanford, we are
currently concerned with the
Farm.
Here at Stanford, track has had
a long and noble career, and as is
the case with noble things, an often
stormy one. Off and on, track has
been an integral part of the Uni
versity since 1893, and almost as
often as not, the teams turned out
in the spring of the year found they
were lacking a cOach.
No Coach First Year «
Such was the case when the first
scanty-clad athletes turned out in
1893. No coach. Instead of sending
a posse of Indians out into the
bush to drum up a suitable mentor,
the track squad took the burden on
itself and three trackmen were
named an "Executive Track Com
mittee" with full charge of the
team. J. E. Reynolds, Scott Cal
houn, a high-jumper, and quarter
miler R. E. Maynard master-minded
the Indians that year.
By '94 a coach was available in
the person of W. M. Hunter, who
was also in charge in '95. In '96
Coach Hunter was gone, and the
team struggled on minus a men
tor of any sort. However, the
next year J. F. King was ap
pointed to the post. He was suc
ceeded the next season by Bill
McLcod. who in turn gave way
to J. L. Bcrnhard in '99. Bern
hard was a performer with the
coathless '96 squad.
At the turn oi* the century Dr. W.
H. Murphy took over at the helm
and stayed on for two terms in of
fice, and was succeeded by the first
of the Farm's "coach this year and
trainer next and so on" personages
in E. W. Moulton, who was ad
dressed by and answered to the
chummy title of "Dad." Dad Moul
ton set an early Stanford record for
coaching when he retained his po
sition for 11 years, from '02 to '13.
In 1914 the string of tenure of
office on Dad Moulton's term ran
out and he was replaced by E. P.
Campbell, better known as "Cap."
Cap was ably assisted by having as
his trainer one H. W. Maloney, of
whom more later.
Moulton Returns
Cap hung on for a brace of years,
and in 1916 Dad Moulton took over
again as head man, having for his
trainer one Dr. Lloyd R. Reynolds,
now an alumnus member of the
Stanford Athletic Council.
During 1917 and '18, as was the
case in the past three years, ath
letics were played down at Stan
ford, it being believed that sports
have no place in warfare. But
athletics were not completely

shunted aside in the light of much
more seriuus events. In 1917, R.
L. (Dink) Templetou. a graduate
student who had been a jumper
and hurdler, handled the reins
for what few students the Farm
could muster.
In 1918, the situation was even
worse, but a couple of students
moved in and took over to salvage
what they could from the season.
The two students were M. J. (Jud)
House and R. L. (Dink) Templeton.
Another student took over in
1919, one F. S. Murray* who was
a very good hurdler and sprinter.
Murray, better known today as
Feg Murray, the cartoonist, was
assisted by Bob Evans, who had
coached the 191!) football squad.
By 1920 a head coach was again
appointed, Harry Maloney, who had
been trainer under Cap Campbell,
taking over as mentor. For trainer
that year the Indians had (hold
yoiJr hats) Dad Moulton. A curious
situation, to say the least.
Templeton Moves In to Stay
The two old-timers stuck around
for only one year, for in 1921 iDnk
Templeton moved in to stay, and
stay Dink did until he resigned in
1939. Dink, who has been repeat
edly referred to as the world's
greatest track coach by quite a few
eminent sports writers and other
authoritative experts and by the
rest as being on a par with South
ern Cal's "Coach of Champions"
Dean Cromwell, produced the first
of Stanford's modern great track
teams, which came home with four
1.C.A.A.A.A., three of those in a
row.
In 1938 W. B. Ellington joined
the coaching stall as Dink's as
sistant, and was appointed head
coach to finish out the season.
Bill's assistant that year was
present Head Coach Jack Weicrs
liauser, a Farm great who had
graduated two years previously.
Pitch Johnson Takes Over
Ellington was relieved in 1940
when Franklin P. (Pitch) Johnson
was appointed to the helm. Pitch
coached the squad up until sports
were canceled in 1943, and resigned
last year, when Jack was appointed.
And there stands the coaching
staff of one of the schools that
moved the balance of track power
to the West Coast 20 years ago, and
have kept it there ever since ex
cept for one or two occasions when
an Eastern team shows up loaded
down with talent as did Pittsburgh
when Long John Woodruff burned
up the Stadium cinders, or Ohio
State in the heyday of Jesse Owens.
But as a rule, the title is strictly a
Pacific Slope monopoly.

ing sports pages for the past 20
years or so may have noticed, but
probably didn't, a curious trend in
the realm of field and fack.
In these two decades, the West
Coast has successfully launched an
invasion on the track world, and
even more successfully maintained
its domination over runners, throw
ers, and jumpers from the rest of
the national domain and the world.
Western Schools Dominate
With not more than two or
three exceptions at most, three
Western schools have placed with
the first four teams in either the
1.C.4-A. or N.C.A.A. (the "World
Series" of track). Of those three
schools, California. Southern Cal
(N.C.A.A. champs for the past
nine ye«rs). and Stanford, we are
currently concerned with the
Farm.
Here at Stanford, track has had
a long and noble career, and as is
the case with noble things, an often
stormy one. Off and on, track has
been an integral part of the Uni
versity since 1893, and almost as
often as not, the teams turned out
in the spring of the year found they
were lacking a cOach.
No Coach First Year «
Such was the case when the first
scanty-clad athletes turned out in
1893. No coach. Instead of sending
a posse of Indians out into the
bush to drum up a suitable mentor,
the track squad took the burden on
itself and three trackmen were
named an "Executive Track Com
mittee" with full charge of the
team. J. E. Reynolds, Scott Cal
houn, a high-jumper, and quarter
miler R. E. Maynard master-minded
the Indians that year.
By '94 a coach was available in
the person of W. M. Hunter, who
was also in charge in '95. In '96
Coach Hunter was gone, and the
team struggled on minus a men
tor of any sort. However, the
next year J. F. King was ap
pointed to the post. He was suc
ceeded the next season by Bill
McLcod. who in turn gave way
to J. L. Bcrnhard in '99. Bern
hard was a performer with the
coathless '96 squad.
At the turn oi* the century Dr. W.
H. Murphy took over at the helm
and stayed on for two terms in of
fice, and was succeeded by the first
of the Farm's "coach this year and
trainer next and so on" personages
in E. W. Moulton, who was ad
dressed by and answered to the
chummy title of "Dad." Dad Moul
ton set an early Stanford record for
coaching when he retained his po
sition for 11 years, from '02 to '13.
In 1914 the string of tenure of
office on Dad Moulton's term ran
out and he was replaced by E. P.
Campbell, better known as "Cap."
Cap was ably assisted by having as
his trainer one H. W. Maloney, of
whom more later.
Moulton Returns
Cap hung on for a brace of years,
and in 1916 Dad Moulton took over
again as head man, having for his
trainer one Dr. Lloyd R. Reynolds,
now an alumnus member of the
Stanford Athletic Council.
During 1917 and '18, as was the
case in the past three years, ath
letics were played down at Stan
ford, it being believed that sports
have no place in warfare. But
athletics were not completely

shunted aside in the light of much
more seriuus events. In 1917, R.
L. (Dink) Templetou. a graduate
student who had been a jumper
and hurdler, handled the reins
for what few students the Farm
could muster.
In 1918, the situation was even
worse, but a couple of students
moved in and took over to salvage
what they could from the season.
The two students were M. J. (Jud)
House and R. L. (Dink) Templeton.
Another student took over in
1919, one F. S. Murray* who was
a very good hurdler and sprinter.
Murray, better known today as
Feg Murray, the cartoonist, was
assisted by Bob Evans, who had
coached the 191!) football squad.
By 1920 a head coach was again
appointed, Harry Maloney, who had
been trainer under Cap Campbell,
taking over as mentor. For trainer
that year the Indians had (hold
yoiJr hats) Dad Moulton. A curious
situation, to say the least.
Templeton Moves In to Stay
The two old-timers stuck around
for only one year, for in 1921 iDnk
Templeton moved in to stay, and
stay Dink did until he resigned in
1939. Dink, who has been repeat
edly referred to as the world's
greatest track coach by quite a few
eminent sports writers and other
authoritative experts and by the
rest as being on a par with South
ern Cal's "Coach of Champions"
Dean Cromwell, produced the first
of Stanford's modern great track
teams, which came home with four
1.C.A.A.A.A., three of those in a
row.
In 1938 W. B. Ellington joined
the coaching stall as Dink's as
sistant, and was appointed head
coach to finish out the season.
Bill's assistant that year was
present Head Coach Jack Weicrs
liauser, a Farm great who had
graduated two years previously.
Pitch Johnson Takes Over
Ellington was relieved in 1940
when Franklin P. (Pitch) Johnson
was appointed to the helm. Pitch
coached the squad up until sports
were canceled in 1943, and resigned
last year, when Jack was appointed.
And there stands the coaching
staff of one of the schools that
moved the balance of track power
to the West Coast 20 years ago, and
have kept it there ever since ex
cept for one or two occasions when
an Eastern team shows up loaded
down with talent as did Pittsburgh
when Long John Woodruff burned
up the Stadium cinders, or Ohio
State in the heyday of Jesse Owens.
But as a rule, the title is strictly a
Pacific Slope monopoly.

years or so may have noticed, but
probably didn't, a curious trend in
the realm of field and fack.
In these two decades, the West
Coast has successfully launched an
invasion on the track world, and
even more successfully maintained
its domination over runners, throw
ers, and jumpers from the rest of
the national domain and the world.
Western Schools Dominate
With not more than two or
three exceptions at most, three
Western schools have placed with
the first four teams in either the
1.C.4-A. or N.C.A.A. (the "World
Series" of track). Of those three
schools, California. Southern Cal
(N.C.A.A. champs for the past
nine ye«rs). and Stanford, we are
currently concerned with the
Farm.
Here at Stanford, track has had
a long and noble career, and as is
the case with noble things, an often
stormy one. Off and on, track has
been an integral part of the Uni
versity since 1893, and almost as
often as not, the teams turned out
in the spring of the year found they
were lacking a cOach.
No Coach First Year «
Such was the case when the first
scanty-clad athletes turned out in
1893. No coach. Instead of sending
a posse of Indians out into the
bush to drum up a suitable mentor,
the track squad took the burden on
itself and three trackmen were
named an "Executive Track Com
mittee" with full charge of the
team. J. E. Reynolds, Scott Cal
houn, a high-jumper, and quarter
miler R. E. Maynard master-minded
the Indians that year.
By '94 a coach was available in
the person of W. M. Hunter, who
was also in charge in '95. In '96
Coach Hunter was gone, and the
team struggled on minus a men
tor of any sort. However, the
next year J. F. King was ap
pointed to the post. He was suc
ceeded the next season by Bill
McLcod. who in turn gave way
to J. L. Bcrnhard in '99. Bern
hard was a performer with the
coathless '96 squad.
At the turn oi* the century Dr. W.
H. Murphy took over at the helm
and stayed on for two terms in of
fice, and was succeeded by the first
of the Farm's "coach this year and
trainer next and so on" personages
in E. W. Moulton, who was ad
dressed by and answered to the
chummy title of "Dad." Dad Moul
ton set an early Stanford record for
coaching when he retained his po
sition for 11 years, from '02 to '13.
In 1914 the string of tenure of
office on Dad Moulton's term ran
out and he was replaced by E. P.
Campbell, better known as "Cap."
Cap was ably assisted by having as
his trainer one H. W. Maloney, of
whom more later.
Moulton Returns
Cap hung on for a brace of years,
and in 1916 Dad Moulton took over
again as head man, having for his
trainer one Dr. Lloyd R. Reynolds,
now an alumnus member of the
Stanford Athletic Council.
During 1917 and '18, as was the
case in the past three years, ath
letics were played down at Stan
ford, it being believed that sports
have no place in warfare. But
athletics were not completely

shunted aside in the light of much
more seriuus events. In 1917, R.
L. (Dink) Templetou. a graduate
student who had been a jumper
and hurdler, handled the reins
for what few students the Farm
could muster.
In 1918, the situation was even
worse, but a couple of students
moved in and took over to salvage
what they could from the season.
The two students were M. J. (Jud)
House and R. L. (Dink) Templeton.
Another student took over in
1919, one F. S. Murray* who was
a very good hurdler and sprinter.
Murray, better known today as
Feg Murray, the cartoonist, was
assisted by Bob Evans, who had
coached the 191!) football squad.
By 1920 a head coach was again
appointed, Harry Maloney, who had
been trainer under Cap Campbell,
taking over as mentor. For trainer
that year the Indians had (hold
yoiJr hats) Dad Moulton. A curious
situation, to say the least.
Templeton Moves In to Stay
The two old-timers stuck around
for only one year, for in 1921 iDnk
Templeton moved in to stay, and
stay Dink did until he resigned in
1939. Dink, who has been repeat
edly referred to as the world's
greatest track coach by quite a few
eminent sports writers and other
authoritative experts and by the
rest as being on a par with South
ern Cal's "Coach of Champions"
Dean Cromwell, produced the first
of Stanford's modern great track
teams, which came home with four
1.C.A.A.A.A., three of those in a
row.
In 1938 W. B. Ellington joined
the coaching stall as Dink's as
sistant, and was appointed head
coach to finish out the season.
Bill's assistant that year was
present Head Coach Jack Weicrs
liauser, a Farm great who had
graduated two years previously.
Pitch Johnson Takes Over
Ellington was relieved in 1940
when Franklin P. (Pitch) Johnson
was appointed to the helm. Pitch
coached the squad up until sports
were canceled in 1943, and resigned
last year, when Jack was appointed.
And there stands the coaching
staff of one of the schools that
moved the balance of track power
to the West Coast 20 years ago, and
have kept it there ever since ex
cept for one or two occasions when
an Eastern team shows up loaded
down with talent as did Pittsburgh
when Long John Woodruff burned
up the Stadium cinders, or Ohio
State in the heyday of Jesse Owens.
But as a rule, the title is strictly a
Pacific Slope monopoly.
