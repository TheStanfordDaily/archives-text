# Vandals Lead Coast League
## 
### 
The University of Idaho, senti
mental favorite with a large major- j
ity of Pacific Coast Conference bas
ketball fans, today held a command
ing position in the Northern PCC j
race.
Last night Idaho defeated the
University of Oregon, 50-46, he
fore a capacity crowd on the Van
dais' home court. The win moved
the Vandals a half-game ahead, of
Oregon State in conference stand
ings. In last night's game at Mos
cow. Wilkins of the University of ,
Oregon was high point man with
15 points.
Idaho has two more games left on
its schedule, one with Oregon to
night and one with W.S.C. on Sat
urday. Oregon State meets Oregon
in another finale, also on Saturday.
Trampled on by foes for many
years, usually hapless Idaho needs
ojily to win its two remaining
games to cinch the Northern PCC
title.
Oregon State College, the only
other team with a mathematical
chance at the title, split two games
with Washington over the weekend
to break a tie with Idaho for the
leadership.
Best Team
The Idaho Vandels now have
about the best five-man team in the
country. This is borne out by the
fact that five Idaho boys occupy
positions among the ten leading
scorers in the conference.
The two forwards, Grant Morten
sen and Fred Quinn, are both tall
and excellent shots. Holding down
the center slot is Jack Phoenix who
towers over the court at a height of
6 ft. 9 ins. Leh Pyne and Bill Car
baugh at guards hold the team to
gether and go to make up a well
balanced five.
Surprise Team
Idaho has been a big surprise in
the conference this year. The Van
dals have come along fast since los
ing four of their first five conference
games. Idaho has had most of its
trouble with OSC whom they do not
meet again this season.
If the Vandals win the confer
ence, they will have in their hands
their first title since 1923. The con
ference winner will invade Berke
ley the weekend of March 3 to play
California for the Pacific Coast title.

Oregon State in conference stand
ings. In last night's game at Mos
cow. Wilkins of the University of ,
Oregon was high point man with
15 points.
Idaho has two more games left on
its schedule, one with Oregon to
night and one with W.S.C. on Sat
urday. Oregon State meets Oregon
in another finale, also on Saturday.
Trampled on by foes for many
years, usually hapless Idaho needs
ojily to win its two remaining
games to cinch the Northern PCC
title.
Oregon State College, the only
other team with a mathematical
chance at the title, split two games
with Washington over the weekend
to break a tie with Idaho for the
leadership.
Best Team
The Idaho Vandels now have
about the best five-man team in the
country. This is borne out by the
fact that five Idaho boys occupy
positions among the ten leading
scorers in the conference.
The two forwards, Grant Morten
sen and Fred Quinn, are both tall
and excellent shots. Holding down
the center slot is Jack Phoenix who
towers over the court at a height of
6 ft. 9 ins. Leh Pyne and Bill Car
baugh at guards hold the team to
gether and go to make up a well
balanced five.
Surprise Team
Idaho has been a big surprise in
the conference this year. The Van
dals have come along fast since los
ing four of their first five conference
games. Idaho has had most of its
trouble with OSC whom they do not
meet again this season.
If the Vandals win the confer
ence, they will have in their hands
their first title since 1923. The con
ference winner will invade Berke
ley the weekend of March 3 to play
California for the Pacific Coast title.
