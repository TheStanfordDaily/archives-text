# Cardinal Gymnast Team Meets Bears, March 9
## 
### 
By KEN ROTENBERC.
Gymnastics, the sport which is
growing very popular around this
campus, is going to take Ihe spot
light again in a few weeks. Coach
Hunt, who mentors the team and is
the activity's biggest booster, had to
admit to at least mild surprise at
the crowd that turned up for the
informal meet that we had with the
Olympic Club last week.
The sports news fans will be
disappointed to learn that the
next meet will be held at Berke
ley on March !>. However, that
is a Saturday and if you can't
live without watching tumblers
and rope climbers, you can follow
the squad over.
Real Competition
This meet will be the first real
competition Stanford has been in
for four years. Our team is made
up of both freshmen and varsity,
since most of the participants are
freshmen.
The boys, who will take part in
the meet against Cal are: Van Dorn,

Robert Paul, Ainsworth, Chennell,
and Stuart. We have also some
good reports on Brimmer, who it
said to be the fastest - improving
man on the team. Bob Cooper is
another new man at the sport but
is coming along well.
Best Bet
Van Dorn, who has just been
released from the navy, is our
best bet to win some events
again*! the Bruins.
