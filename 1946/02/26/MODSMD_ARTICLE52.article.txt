## 
### 
Subjects discussed at Women's
Confcrcncc yesterday were:
1. Housing poll and appoint
ment procedure.
2. Keeping the halls open until
1:30 Saturday nights.
!5. Method of awarding the
scholarship cup.
Women's Conference passed ques
tions for a Housing poll to be taken
by all women students on campus
probably during the first part of
spring quarter. The poll will in
clude questions asking for opinions
on the entire housing program and
ways to improve it. Women will
give their name, living group, and
class, so that Housing Committee
may contact them about their sug
gestions.
Housing Committee Meets
Living unit excoms will meet to
day to suggest people from their
units to serve on Housing Commit
tee. Conference Advisory Board
will go over the suggestions tomor
row and appoint four new members
who will serve from the beginning
of spring quarter until the middle
of next winter quarter. The mem
bers will be appointed according to
living group unit and class.
Housing Committee will meet to
day to elect a new chairman to
serve spring quarter. Those eligible
are Phyllis Sutherland, Catie Owen,
and Joan Bailey.
Saturday Open Hours
Conference members discussed
the problem of keeping living
groups open until 1:30 on Saturday
nights. Beaty O'Hair, Patty Patten,
and Charmian Kolar have been dis
cussing the problem with Dean
Stalnaker, Dean Yost, and Miss
Doyle.
The administration and the wom
en students both feel that the houses
need to be kept open between 12
and 1:30 on Saturdays, or some
place such as the Nitery or Wom
en's Clubhouse should be kept open
between those hours, it was stated
in Conference.
Supervision Neccssary
Conference does not feel that
having a central place open would
solve the problem. However, to
keep the living groups open, there
must be supervision.
It was suggested that someone be
hired to supervise the five Union
Unit houses which have no one on
duty Saturday nights. Since house
mothers of the Row houses have of
fered to stay up and supervise, and
other houses have night assistants
who are on duty anyway, Confer
ence thought the problem might be
solved in this way. The issues will
be discussed again next week.
Scholarship Award
In awarding the Conference
scholarship cup for this quarter, it
was suggested that the award be
made on the living group member
ship as it is this quarter窶馬ot as it
is at the beginning of spring quar
ter. This plan will entail more
work, but Conference feels it can
be worked out.

Saturday Open Hours
Conference members discussed
the problem of keeping living
groups open until 1:30 on Saturday
nights. Beaty O'Hair, Patty Patten,
and Charmian Kolar have been dis
cussing the problem with Dean
Stalnaker, Dean Yost, and Miss
Doyle.
The administration and the wom
en students both feel that the houses
need to be kept open between 12
and 1:30 on Saturdays, or some
place such as the Nitery or Wom
en's Clubhouse should be kept open
between those hours, it was stated
in Conference.
Supervision Neccssary
Conference does not feel that
having a central place open would
solve the problem. However, to
keep the living groups open, there
must be supervision.
It was suggested that someone be
hired to supervise the five Union
Unit houses which have no one on
duty Saturday nights. Since house
mothers of the Row houses have of
fered to stay up and supervise, and
other houses have night assistants
who are on duty anyway, Confer
ence thought the problem might be
solved in this way. The issues will
be discussed again next week.
Scholarship Award
In awarding the Conference
scholarship cup for this quarter, it
was suggested that the award be
made on the living group member

be worked out.
