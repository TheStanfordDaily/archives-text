# Cards Clash with Dons In Bucket Finale Tonight
## 
### SMILEY FAKKAS 
The curtain rings down, again, on ;
basketball at the Farm tonight when !
the Indians tangle with the Univer- i
sity of San Francisco Dons in the
Pavilion. Game time is 8 p.m., and
there will be NO preliminary game.
The game was originally scheduled
for the S. F. Civic Auditorium, but
due to a conflict in dates was shifted
to the Farm, it was revealed late
yesterday afternoon.
Indians Improving
Both squads collided a month ago I
in the Pavilion, with the Dons tak
ing away a 49-39 triumph after j
Stanford had led most of the way. j
The visitors, however, have lost
strength consistently since then,'
while the Indians have reportedly
improved.
Coach Everett Dean will start his i
first string of last week, with Gene |
Martin and Johnny Muir at for
wards, Tom Murphy at center, and
Tom Rodman and Jack Wood at
guards.
S.F.U. Loses (iiesen
"Tiny" Bussenius' squad has lost |
the services of forward Don Giesen ;
to the Army. Giesen tallied 19 points !
against the Indians in the previous \
game.
Another casualty is center Bili
Flaherty, reportedly dropped out of
school. And still another is center |
Hai Bcveridge (13 points against thr j
locals) who was injured. However,
the Dons will be considerably
buoyed up by the return of Boh
Desmond, rated the best player on
the squad.
Two B's Move Up
The Indians, also, have a couple !
of additions to the squad, Coach j

Dean moving up center Ed Culin
and guard Bob Hagopian from the
hotter than a firecracker "B" team.
A stiff workout Monday and a
light one yesterday seemed to have
eliminated most of the cfTects of the
long weekend fiasco and brought
from Coach Dean the admission that
the team "looked good."
