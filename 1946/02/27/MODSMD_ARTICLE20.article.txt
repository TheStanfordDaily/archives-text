$19 to the Rod Cross Drive at the
booths on Quad yesterday. Miss
Banning has requested that any off
campus student who gives a dona
tion to the Red Cross in Palo A 11«»
ask that the contribution be cred
ited to Stanford.
A graph drawn by Dana Fore
show how the Red Cross Drive is
proceeding from day to day. The
graph must he up to the $3,000
mark by (he end of the drive,
stated Miss Banning.
Thousands of servicemen still
overseas are receiving benefits from
the Red Cross in the form of rec
reational clubs. These men are go
ing through a boredom that is
more nerve-wracking than waiting
to fight, according to Mrs. Dare
Stark McMullin, publicity director
of Palo Alto's chapter of the Red
Cross. The clubs give the armed
forces amusement to relieve the
monotony.
The Red Cross is also helping
returned veterans and their fami
lies in ease of dire need. Red
Cross field directors arc still
overseas to contact families of
service men in (lie states in emer
gencies and to help the men with
personal problems.
Although the war is over, stated
Mrs. McMullin, the need for the
Red Cross is as great as ever. Stan
ford students can further the build -
ing of the peace by backing this
drive and fulfilling the quota, she;
added.


NANCY BANNING, chairman
of the Red Cross Drive.
