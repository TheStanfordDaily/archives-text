# It Should Be Simple

... for Conference to work out an arrange
ment whereby all women's residences on
campus are kept open until 1:30 every Satur
day night.
Here is one of the small problems over
which hours of talk are wasted each week
while nobody reaches a conclusion. It is a
prime example of the way we procrastinate,
hesitate to state a decision, and almost enjoy
the lengthy and tortuous trails of indirect rea
soninq we follow on oui Yellow Brick Road
to nowhere.
Both the administration and students have
agreed that it would bp an improved policy
to change the closing hours, because it will
provide a long-needed "place to go" in the
hours between 12 o'clock dance close-up

time and the last minutes of women's 1:30
late leaves.
As the situation now stands, Row houses
with house mothers and other halls with
regular night matrons can be kept open with
out difficulty. Five small Union houses will
have to hire graduate students to act as night
matrons on Saturday nights, or find a simi
lar solution, and the problem will be set
tled.
Conference referred the closing hours pol
icy back to women's houses for more discus
sion. but as usual, it isn't discussion that's
necessary, it's action. Once and for all, let's
quit tieing ourselves up into knots of red
tape, and attempt to solve a simple problem,
simply.
