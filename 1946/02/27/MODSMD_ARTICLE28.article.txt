# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
Another form of "explanation" is the expression:
"Yes . . . but what can we do?" To realists, and for
two reasons, those words cannot qualify as a re
. | on e to an appeal for values.
1 irst, this is not a question of "What?" or "How
much?" I am pleading for a difference in depth—
that is, of quality, not quantity. In other words,
"Do you want to do something?" If we used the
"Yes, but . . expression with emphasis on the
what instead of on the can it would be different.
!■ 'i-ondly, lor the present, we have had enough
of appearances. Every student on campus looks dil —
lei ( ut. But do we act sufficiently different to con
vince that we are free to clo what we want with our
livi ■:;?
I oui laboratories we demand experimental evi
<i i to verify our facts. And an author in physics
w'i'i has not proved what he holds to be true in his
texi has not paid a sufficient price to be 1 heard. Why
don't we maintain the same experimental attitude
in our lives in the outside world? Our realism
ought to permeate our entire living.
As a realist, in my understanding of the word, I
am asking you to demonstrate your depth. If you
are honestly asking yourself, "What can I do?" you
will also develop the courage to ask someone else.
The doing of something, even as small as that, will
put you "on your way." At that point you are no
longer indifferent; for action conceives insight, and
insight, like affection, grows with expression.
But here is the insurmountable barrier of the
"concrete-bound" minds. They are looking for a
book, the reading of which will make them into a
better person. To the extent of our experience with
"things" spiritual, however, we know the picture
isn't as simple as that. To improve our appearance
is one thing; but to improve our inner spirit is quite
anoiher. The latter can only come by example or
inspiration, and must always be done by ourselves.
Any "fool" knows he cannot improve the self he
was yesterday. And, to the extent he knows that,

he is other than foolish. However, far too many
people believe I hey are unable to improve them
selves today. It is that desire of self-improvement
which moved me to write thi.4 letter.
Therefore, I say, moment by moment respond to
life as it comes. There is no other way than this, by
which we can become our best possible selves to
morrow. For whatever we lose on today's "ac
count," will also be lost on tomorrow's. When there
comes that point in life called "death," everything
which has gone before will "strike" only one bal
ance. Either we have done more, by then, of what
we call good or of that called bad. When you claim
to be free you are' assuming, from then on, respon
sibility for that balance. However, if, and in those
moments when, you don't claim to be free, common
sense advises us to discount your company and
affection.
For two quarters I have been on Stanford's cam
pus. Because I have been so little changed in that
time, and found those about me to be so unrecep
tive to change, I have begun to wonder whether
Stanford University and 1 have ever "met." Of
course, I don't mean as social animals. That part of
reality is, comparatively speaking, easily estab
lished. I mean as students—as independent, free
minds and hearts.
1 don't want popularity or the praises of men. I
want commitment. I want "bounce" in life. For an
action I want a reaction. And, in reality, I believe
every member of the Stanford group wants the
same. The question then is, whether or not you
want it strongly enough to do something about it.
All of us wish to be somebody don't we? Yet, I
hold, the biggest "thing" you and I can ever be is
ourselves. No other person is so well equipped for
that. And, by our failing to be that, the world is
forever losing something it might have had. So, in
the ever present now, take a position and be your
self. Shed "your" neutrality—for .it really isn't
yours—and begin to live.
