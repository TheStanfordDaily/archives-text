We were all happy to hear that Miracle Kin
"won all driving" in the second at Santa Anita last
Saturday. Miracle Kin is owned by Virginia Har
j.ei, Stanford '45.
Virginia was fortunate enough to get a jockey
named Johnny Adams to ride Miracle Kin, and
was even more fortunate in having a couple of
bobs on the nag's nose, for it paid $10.00, $8.10,
and $5.40.
Quoting the Otis Chart: "Miracle Kin, under a
liglil hold to a stretch turn, where he started up
on tiie outside, continued in determined fashion
after straightening up in the stretch and wearing
down the leaders, drew away."
Virginia, incidentally, is no relation to T. W.

It seems that Bertrand Russell House has an

agreement with the boys at the neighboring halls
to leave their cars parked in front of Russell in
exchange for one free meal a week. This gives
the old brown shack the appearance of being a
real "wheel house."

First of a long line of great athletes to trek
Farm-ward in this glorious post-war period is Bob
Anderson, broad-shouldered lowan, who is pur
ported to have swum the 100 in 52 Hal, whatever
that means.
While on the subject of athletic prospects, a
local sports statistician has already figured out that
the not-so-thin Red Line for next fall will average
208 pounds from end to end.
With Phil Bengtson, Charley "Chuck" Taylor,
and Vic Lindskog to coach these lads in the liner
points of line play, even we could look good in
the backfi"ld.
