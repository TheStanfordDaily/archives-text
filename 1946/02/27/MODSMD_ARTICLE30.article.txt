### ELLIOTT EPSTEEN 
On Monday, the Chinese Nationalists and the
Communists signed a pact that lumped their armies.
Together, they now total almost four million men.
According to the agreement, they will be gradually
demobilized until the sum is eight hundred thou
sand.
This and other moves toward peace in China
sound lovely, but are they worth anything?
MANCHURIA
Guns are roaring in Manchuria now. The story
of that province is the key of Asia. Who controls
it wili determine whether or not Russia dominates
Asia or whether that continent is somewhat bal
anced. It is both actually and potentially the rich
est part of China.
Realizing this, Chiang moved to control Man
churia as soon as possible. When the Japanese
Kwantung Army was beaten, he detached every
possible man to set in there before the Communists
did.
CHIANG STRONGER
At first he had only about 155,000 men, but the
Communists mustered only a few units of the
Eighth Route Army and some guerrillas.
The Reds fought a delaying action from Shan
haikwan to Mukd-n, and the Russians played their

part by stalling Ihe Nationalists as much as pos
sible. Were it not for the atom bomb, the Russian
part might have been much greater.
ARMISTICE
Mukden was reached and the armistice, calling
for a military status quo, was signed. By this time,
Chiang had two field armies in Manchuria, totaling
200,000 men.
Now the peace is signed, and all of a sudden the
negligible Communist armies in Manchuria have
grown to 300,000, armed with Kwantung Army
equipment that the Russians took from the Japs.
The whole thing, in fact, might suggest to the
cynical that the highly publicized peace negotia
tions were only a stall for time.
BATTLE
Now the Nationalists and the Communists are
slugging it out on a 45-mile front. The Communists
lire attacking northwest of Mukden, probably try
ing to cut the Nationalist overland escape arteries,
and especially the Mukden-Tientsin rail line.
It does not seem that irresponsible elements
could have caused such large battles. It is to be
hoped that the present dispute can be patched up.
But all that can be said now is that peace would be
so wonderful for China, if it were only true.
