"HOW TO BE A CIVILIAN," by
Morion Thompson. Doubleday &
Company, $2.00
So, you wanna be a civilian?
Brother, you have a tough job ahead
of you.
I used to think there's nothing

more to it than
getting your dis
charge and don
ning your civ
vies. Little did
I know. Noth
ing as simple as
that! Not if you
judge by all the
articles and the

uriieifh uiiu uie
books telling the *poor, bewildered
GI how to "adjust."
From All Angles
There must be almost as many
articles and books as there are
guys getting discharged.
These literary masterpieces at
tack the problem from all angles
psychological, social, economic, and
who knows what. On the whole
they fall into two classes: the high
brow and the lowbrow.
Morton "Joe-the-Wounded-Ten -
nis-Player" Thompson's contribu
tion definitely belongs to the latter.
How Much?
It is a fund of vital information.
Thus it is essential for you (who
are about to become a human be
ing again) to learn that:
"It is not unusual to find on the
streets and in public places any
number of pretty girls. These girls
have not been liberated. It is gross
ly improper to approach them at a
gallop, screaming, 'How much?'
"Always first ask them, 'Isn't
this a lovely day?' or 'Have you
ever been in Milwaukee?' Then
ask them how much."
Don't Scream
You are warned that when visit
ing friends "odd trinkets, silverware,
and other objects belong to the host
and not the Army," and that:
''When leaving a restaurant or
the home of a friend, you will
look in vain for your hat und coat.
It has been put in a closet for you
or checked. Just ask for it. Don't
start screaming right away, 'Some
son of a b stole my outfit!'"
Civilian Language
You learn about everything from

civilian clothing to how to get in
bed with your wife. You even have
your vocabulary readjusted in a
chapter on "how to talk civilian."
Sample:
Civilian (il
To whom do you You bucking for
think you are a fat lip?
speaking?
Go back. Treer, Ho!
Give your name. Sow NofT!
Public school Orientation

k ids
Also Makes Sense
While people rarely learn any
thing from books handing out ad
vice, (his one has the advantage of
being amusing. It also makes quite
a bit of sense.
You may know already that a j
bathtub "is like when you take a j
shower, only you lie down like in
a foxhole except you can turn the
water off," but it is worth while to
listen when Thompson prescribes:
Be Bitter
"Keep your bitterness. Use it to
advantage. . . . You have learned
to fight as a team. Keep lighting
that way. That's something civil
ians know little or nothing about, i
That's something you tan teach
them, a dowry you will bring to !
theni out of war. It is something
that makes sense when you try to i
figure out what the hell it was all
about and what the hell you got
out of it."
A full-time civilian may have
some trouble with the language and
ideas of the book. But the veteran
should find it funny and interesting.
A Satire
Particularly enjoyable is Thomp
son's satire of army doctors—the
kind that stayed in the States. In
telling you how to "hit the book"
as a civilian, he pulls no punches.
Another good piece of satire
deals with civilian religion. If
you want to lead a 100 per cent
American life, don't read the Bi
ble, read the ads that tell you
everything from birth to grave.
Even if you are perfectly happy
as an ex-GI and have no problems
of readjustment, "How to Be a Ci
vilian" will provide .you with a
couple of hours of enjoyable read
ing.

Be Bitter
"Keep your bitterness. Use it to
advantage. . . . You have learned
to fight as a team. Keep lighting
that way. That's something civil
ians know little or nothing about, i
That's something you tan teach
them, a dowry you will bring to !
theni out of war. It is something
that makes sense when you try to i
figure out what the hell it was all
about and what the hell you got
out of it."
A full-time civilian may have
some trouble with the language and
ideas of the book. But the veteran
should find it funny and interesting.
A Satire
Particularly enjoyable is Thomp
son's satire of army doctors—the
kind that stayed in the States. In
telling you how to "hit the book"
as a civilian, he pulls no punches.
Another good piece of satire
deals with civilian religion. If
you want to lead a 100 per cent
American life, don't read the Bi
ble, read the ads that tell you
everything from birth to grave.
Even if you are perfectly happy
as an ex-GI and have no problems
of readjustment, "How to Be a Ci
vilian" will provide .you with a
couple of hours of enjoyable read
ing.

"HOW TO BE A CIVILIAN," by
Morion Thompson. Doubleday &
Company, $2.00
So, you wanna be a civilian?
Brother, you have a tough job ahead
of you.
I used to think there's nothing

more to it than
getting your dis
charge and don
ning your civ
vies. Little did
I know. Noth
ing as simple as
that! Not if you
judge by all the
articles and the

uriieifh uiiu uie
books telling the *poor, bewildered
GI how to "adjust."
From All Angles
There must be almost as many
articles and books as there are
guys getting discharged.
These literary masterpieces at
tack the problem from all angles
psychological, social, economic, and
who knows what. On the whole
they fall into two classes: the high
brow and the lowbrow.
Morton "Joe-the-Wounded-Ten -
nis-Player" Thompson's contribu
tion definitely belongs to the latter.
How Much?
It is a fund of vital information.
Thus it is essential for you (who
are about to become a human be
ing again) to learn that:
"It is not unusual to find on the
streets and in public places any
number of pretty girls. These girls
have not been liberated. It is gross
ly improper to approach them at a
gallop, screaming, 'How much?'
"Always first ask them, 'Isn't
this a lovely day?' or 'Have you
ever been in Milwaukee?' Then
ask them how much."
Don't Scream
You are warned that when visit
ing friends "odd trinkets, silverware,
and other objects belong to the host
and not the Army," and that:
''When leaving a restaurant or
the home of a friend, you will
look in vain for your hat und coat.
It has been put in a closet for you
or checked. Just ask for it. Don't
start screaming right away, 'Some
son of a b stole my outfit!'"
Civilian Language
You learn about everything from

civilian clothing to how to get in
bed with your wife. You even have
your vocabulary readjusted in a
chapter on "how to talk civilian."
Sample:

While people rarely learn any
