# 'China Sky' Rated Weak, Unrealistic, and Outdated
## 
### 
"China Sky," which opened yes
terday at Mayfield Theater, is one
of the better reasons why J. Arthur
Rank's British pictures may get a

firm grasp on the
American thea
ter market.
R-K-O's adap
tation of Pearl
Buck's book is
now out - dated
and in fact was
not even suitable
war-time enter
tainment. It has
the worst quali-

ties of a rip
roaring Western together with the
patriotic rah-rah of an Air Corp en
listment film. If you're a movie fan,
you've undoubtedly suffered through
many like "China Sky."

Scott's Impeccable
This picture of China's war effort
has Randolph Scott, at all times
looking like a Texas ranch-owner,
as an American doctor in an ob
scure Chinese province. For the
most part Mr. Scott is immaculately
dressed (despite the constant bomb
ings) and he seems to have some
good rye available at the right
times.
At the picture's start Scott is re
turning from a trip to the "states,"
as the picture's sophisticates would
say, with a brand new American
wife and a spoilt one at that. Ellen
Drew portrays the young wife with
her usual brand of acting. Her
makeup leads the audience to be
lieve that she is stepping into the
cocktail lounge at the Biltmore in
stead of into a cave to escape Japa
nese bombings.
Triangle Trouble
Complications of the usual tri
angle sort arise when Miss Drew
suspects her husband of carrying on
with a pretty American nurse in
the hospital. The nursa is played
by Ruth Warrick, who has proved
before that she can really act, and
suffers through this picture looking
like she wonders what it's all about.
The audience wonders, at times,
too.

After the triangle has been neatly
accomplished, the war starts in all
of its "horrible fury." The hospital
is bombed incessantly. Here, a
fourth ingredient is injected into
the plot when Anthony Quinn, as a
Chinese bandit, comes riding down
into the obscure Chinese town.
Quinn, who looks at times like Ru
dolph Valentino, looks like nothing
in this picture.—Peck

you've undoubtedly suffered through
many like "China Sky."

Scott's Impeccable
This picture of China's war effort
has Randolph Scott, at all times
looking like a Texas ranch-owner,
as an American doctor in an ob
scure Chinese province. For the
most part Mr. Scott is immaculately
dressed (despite the constant bomb
ings) and he seems to have some
good rye available at the right
times.
At the picture's start Scott is re
turning from a trip to the "states,"
as the picture's sophisticates would
say, with a brand new American
wife and a spoilt one at that. Ellen
Drew portrays the young wife with
her usual brand of acting. Her
makeup leads the audience to be
lieve that she is stepping into the
cocktail lounge at the Biltmore in
stead of into a cave to escape Japa
nese bombings.
Triangle Trouble
Complications of the usual tri
angle sort arise when Miss Drew
suspects her husband of carrying on
with a pretty American nurse in
the hospital. The nursa is played
by Ruth Warrick, who has proved
before that she can really act, and
suffers through this picture looking
like she wonders what it's all about.
The audience wonders, at times,
too.

After the triangle has been neatly
accomplished, the war starts in all
of its "horrible fury." The hospital
is bombed incessantly. Here, a
fourth ingredient is injected into
the plot when Anthony Quinn, as a
Chinese bandit, comes riding down
into the obscure Chinese town.
Quinn, who looks at times like Ru
dolph Valentino, looks like nothing
in this picture.—Peck
