Tonight marks the definite close
of the Stanford basketball schedule.
The Indians, under revised plans,
take on the U.S.F. Dons in the Stan
lord Pavilion at the stroke of eight
bells. U.S.F. is favored to win, but
don't plunk too many chips on the
table in that expectation. There is
a chance the Farm basketballers
will puJl an upset, we hope.

The Northern Division is enjoy
ing one of the hottest basketball
races in many a moon. Currently at
the top is Idaho, which in itself is
a rarity, as the Moscow crew has
not won the crown since 1923, which
is before the time of most Cardinal
residents.
Right on the Vandals' heels is Or
egoo State, with only a half-game
difference between first and second
place. If Idaho wins their remain
ing two games, then they're "in."

j But if they should lose one game,
• : and Oregon State should grab their
final tilt, then the tables would be
, reversed, and the Beavers would be
! entitled to play California for the
j conference play-off.

An item that is of particular
significance to assistant sports ed
itor A 1 Sciaroni and myself is a
U.P. ticker note that Camp Beale
defeated Camp Stoneman in the
first round of the Ninth Service
Command basketball tournament.
Before the tournament is over,
both of us might be in the nutt
ing galleries for Camp Beale. if
you know what I mean.

It is most heartening to look over
! the baseball news that has been
j coming in daily,-since the opening
of the spring training camps. Men
1 worthy of handling the ball and bat
are once again around, and most of
the war-time "babies" are being
| thrown down into minor circuits, or
given outright releases.
Pacific Coast baseball last season
often approached the ludicrous. Er
rors, wild pitches, missed balls, and
poor hitting was the rule rather
than the exception with most teams.
The situation was so bad at
times that fans, instead of prop
erly booing and demanding re
bates on their tickets, just
laughed the whole thing off. often
remarking, "C'est la guerre."

From the New York Herald-Trib
j une comes the release that they are
going to select an All-East and All-
West collegiate basketball team to
play in Madison Square Garden on
j March 30, for a special children's
I fund. They want college students
to help select these teams, so put on
j your thinking caps, for in a few
! days we'll have a ballot in the
Daily to write your selection of the
best ten players west of the Alle
ghenies.
