# The 						Umpire's Verdict
## 
### Bv STU MILLAR 
It's not exactly a tradition, but a
glance at the records will suffice to
show that few managers in the ma
jor leagues have won a pennant
their first year in the big time.
Bucky Harris did it . . . Bill
Terry did it. And maybe a few
others passed us by. It's an aw
ful lot to ask any new man on the
job to react to such terrific pres
sure with all the right answers

and choices necessary to guide a
pennant-winner. But almost ev
: cry baseball fan in the nation
probably expects Eddie Dyer,
new manager of the Cardinals, to
do it.
: He certainly has all the material.
I A pitching staff which is capable
| of developing into one of the great
| est of all time works out daily un
j der his command at St. Petersburg,
| Florida.
An infield that is two deep at
almost every position and a hard
hitting outfield will back up the
mound corps. In fact, poor Eddie
is spending most of his time try
| ing to weed out the "trash" like
Walker Cooper, whom he sold to
the New York Giants for a $175,-
000 chunk.
Dyer will no doubt continue to
! follow the policy of selling the es
j tablished old-timers like Cooper for
! huge sums and put his hopes on the
i younger men who came, are com
ing, and vyill come from the tre
mendously efficient Card farm sys
tem. The new ones like promising
A 1 "Red" Shoendienst will carry
! the brunt of the burden in the Red
birds' quest of the National League
| flag-
A list of all the tryouts for the
St. Louis pitching brigade would
take up a few inches in itself.
Some of the names might not be
I well known, but if they are good
i enough to he training with the
Cards this year, they are prob
ably good enough for most ma
jor teams.
Our choice for the eventual satel
lite of the staff is Johnny Beazley.
! Against the toughest of horsehide
! competition a few years back, Beaz
ley made good in a big way. And,
according to all the reports that
come in on the U.P. ticker, this
should be his year. He has the
ability, poise, and confidence neces
sary to a 20-game winner. He is
! young and strong; he can pitch
J often if needed.
But with hurlers like Ernie
White, Ted Wilks, Max Lanier,
Charlie Barrett. Alpha Bra/.le,
and Howie Pollett around, it is
unlikely that he will have to
> strain.
Pollett is another returning war
J veteran. Although he has been
j away from the majors, he has
pitched outstanding ball in the
| service to merit Dyer's considera-
I tion for a top spot on the staff.
