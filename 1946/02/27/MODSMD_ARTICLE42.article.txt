# Nimitz Swamps Johnson Squad
## 
### 
The undefeated Nimitz team
maintained its perfect record in
League I last night by swamping
the hapless Johnson five, 38-12. The
Navy quintet was never in trouble,
leading at halftime by a 13-3 score.
In the second half both teams
picked up in scoring, but nothing
the Johnson men could do ever
threatened the Nimitz squad. As
usual, Shoup led the victors, this
time scoring 17 points. Moser fol
lowed with 11 and Helbush paced
the losers with seven.
Encina Downs Phi Psi's
In the best game of the evening,
Encina IE edged out the Phi Psi's,
28-25. Trailing 20-7 at halftime,
the Phi Psi's narrowed the margin
to three points, but could never
quite close it. Campbell of Encina
turned in the best performance of
the game with 13 points to his credit
in addition to sparkling defensive
play. Ericson, also of Encina, fol
lowed closely with 10 points.
Although Fillmore's Brown led
both teams with 10 points, his ef
forts failed to save his team from a
31-18 shellacking at the hands of
the Legal Eagles. The first half was
close, ending with the lawyers on
the long end of a 16-12 score, but
plenty of reserves helped the Eagles
to an easy victory. Luce led the
victors with eight points and Supple
tallied with six.
