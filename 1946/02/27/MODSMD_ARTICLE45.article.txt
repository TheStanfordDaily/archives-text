# BAC Plans Marathons For Friday
## 
### 
Tentative plans for the gala re
vival of Stanford's traditional Irish
marathon and interclass meet card
ed for Friday afternoon were re
leased today by Indian Track Coach
Jack Weiershauser.
Last marathon and interclass
meet was held 14 years ago, and the
revival was instigated by thje B.A.C.
to cause a competitive renascence
between the classes again and re
vive the flagging school spirit be
fore the spring quarter begins.
Track Meet â€¢
Another step in the same direc
tion will be made next week when
the B.A.C. puts on the intramural
track meet at Angell Field, but
more of that later.
Four team captains and colors for
the classes were appointed and
picked, and the classes divided up
according to units completed. Ted
Off will lead the green frosh,
George Grimes the yellow sophs,
Don Lowe the white juniors, and
Ed Luce the red seniors.
All students with 45 units or less
are classified as frosh, 46 to 90 as
sophs, 91 to 135 as juniors, and 136
on up (including grad students) as
seniors.
Contact Captains
All male students who are inter
ested in pi'opagating the honor of
their class are urged to contait the
team captains (residences available
in the bawlout). Points scored in
this meet will be added to the grand
total for interclass athletic activities
and the winning class will be pre
sented with a trophy at the end of
the spring quarter.
A special handicap race has been
added to the program, and will start
the festivities at 4 p.m. at An
gell Field. The event is a three
quarter (three - lap) race with
George Grimes, Mushy Girard,
Johnny Fulton, and Frank Ganahl
starting from scratch, and Don
Lowe, Dick Azeltine, Carl Schro
der, and Bob McLean with a han
dicap.

two-man three-legged race, with
entries restricted to two teams per
class; a 100-yard backward race,
with three entries per class; a 400-
vard heel-and-toe walk, which is
