ence baseball competition.
Although it is still too early to
| size up the potential strength of the
baseball squad, several players have
I looked promising in the preliminary
| batting and fielding drills which
| Coach Wolter has conducted,
j McGraw Leads
Frank McGraw. who has been
consistently smashing out long line
| drives all over the outfield pastures,
| is the leading candidate for the
| catching chores.
Carl Hellinger, who played on
i the varsity for two years before
I entering the army, has loomed as a
1 dangerous batting threat.
Pitching Strong
The pitching staff is the strong
est department on the team. Phil
j Wolf has already unveiled a hop-
I ping fast ball and a slick wide-
J breaking curve and his two years
lon the varsity squad have given
him the necessary poise. Dick Flat
i land, star of the frosh team in pre
j war years, is back, and he has ably
! demonstrated that he possesses his
former â™¦flectiveness.
