Although severely hampered by
Japanese interference, the Red
Cross did manage to get two ship
loads of food packages through to
civilian internees in the Philippine
Islands, according to Stanford stu
dent and Santo Tomas veteran Bet
ty Silen.
"Our Red Cross food stocks in
Manila were looted by Jup troops
and Filipinos shortly after the city
was taken," Miss Silen recalled,
"and left us high and dry—besides
giving rise to Manila's black mar
ket."
First Food Arrived
First additional Red Cross food

came through during the winter of
1942-43. she said, to be followed by
another shipment about a year
later.

"It was really welcome," Miss Si
len declared. Each internee re
ceived a five-pound package con

taining dehydrated vegetables, tin
ned butter and meat, chocolate, cof
fee, tea, and other food.
Well Planned
"They were beautifully packed
and thoughtfully planned to include
a well - balanced supply of food.
What's more, they stretched out —
although they didn't quite last the
three and a half years we were in
camp," she added.
Red Cross workers came in with
the army when the Philippines
were liberated last year, Miss Silen
said.
"They wonted in very close co
operation with the army, their main
problem being to supply clothes to
Filipinos. Food—our problem—was
provided by the army."
Welcomed News
But most welcome of all Red
Cross contributions to civilian in
ternees, Miss Silen declared, was a
small news sheet supplied with the
food packages.
"Of course, they were doctored to
pass Jap censorship," she said.
"They could contain no political or
war news. But their stories on lat
est movies, fashions, sports events,
and other 'harmless' news really did
more than anything to keep us in
touch with life in the States."
