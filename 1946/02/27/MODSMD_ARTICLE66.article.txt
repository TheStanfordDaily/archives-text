# Mozart Termed Duo Concert Best
## 
### 
Fine co-ordination, baalnccd em
phasis ot strength, and a precise
and restrained technique made the
Mozart selections memorable duo
performances at last night's con
cert by Ralph Kirkpatrick, harpsi
chordist, and Alexander Schneider,
violinist, in Memorial Hall.
The final the Sonata in
D Major by Mozart, was perhaps
the best choice on the program for
the couple. Mr. Kirkpatrick's ex
cellent technique was not overshad
owed by a more vivid part for the
violin, as it was in the Bach Sonata
in E Minor. The Bach Sonata was
not as pleasing because Mr. Schnei
der's tone was not adequate to sus
tain the importance of his part.
But the vividness and spirit of his
playing in the Allegro con Spirito
of the Mozart sonata and his deli
cacy in the Andante Cantabile were
ideal accompaniment for Mr. Kirk
patrick's nimble and entirely beau
tiful interpretation of the entirely
beautiful Mozart work.
Mr. Kirkpatrick in the Five So
natas for Harpsichord by Scar
latti demonstrated his ability to
make his instrument, despite its
restricted range and tone, com
mand a concert stage. A surface
simplicity and firm brilliance in
the Scarlatti sonatas was the re
sult of Mr. Kirkpatrick's careful
execution and studied balance of
tone.
The first selection on the pro
gram, the Mozart Sonata in F Ma
jor, immediately won the audience
with the qualities most prominent
throughout the evening — excellent
co-ordination and deftness of tech
nique.
Schneider and Kirkpatrick have
been praised for their "transpar
ency and clarity," and for their
"rare emotional delineation." If
these phrases have any meaning

at all. (lie one most obvious at
last night's concert was "clarity";
this was almost always main
tained. We should like very much
to hear more of Schneider and
Kirkpatrick at Stanford.
