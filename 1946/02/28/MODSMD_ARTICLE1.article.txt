### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 (UP).—
The United States has advised Brit
ain and France that it favors oust
ing the Francisco Franco regime in
Spain and creating a temporary
government that would permit the
Spanish people freely to choose
their own form of ruje, authorita
tive sources said today.
Its note reportedly opposes for
eign intervention, however, and
states that it is anxious that any
change - over be made without
touching off another Spanish civil
war.
Hence, il was implied, the United
States feels that the temporary or
"caretaker" government which re
places Franco must be based on the
most stable elements in Spain. It
was intimated that such a regime
even might have representation of
the Spanish army, the judiciary,
and other elements — provided it
also includes Spanish political ex
iles.
The United States would want the
interim government to agree to re
lease political prisoners and permit
free entry into Spain of political ex
iles.
The State Department later con
firmed that a note had been sent "in
regard to the situation in Spanish,"
but it declined to reveal details.
London dispatches reported that
the United States proposed that
Britain and France join it in de
nouncing the Franco regime and
"recommend" a caretaker govern
ment to succeed it.
