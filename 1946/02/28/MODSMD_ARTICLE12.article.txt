(Editorial note: This is the third

ford life and their suggestions for
its betterment. Today's article
will consider the social phase of
Stanford.)
By CEDRIC COWING
Veterans generally agree that the
"open house" or "jolly-up" is a
good method of meeting new friends
at Stanford. They approve that
phase of the Farm's social program.
However, reflecting the mature
thinking brought on by war ex
periences, ex-G.l.'s looked with
some disdain on the young fresh
men and their "Hate Day." John
F. Doyle, ex-infantryman and
new freshman, indicated that af
ter traipsing over two or three
continents haggard and unshaven,
he intended to make good use of
the shaving facilities available.
Freshman activity was character
ized as "juvenile" by Mr. Doyle and
he suggests "Seev-Lieb" be de
moted to the status of a high-school
senior.

112 Another Army man adopted a ;
more far-sighted view; he pointed !
J to the 25-year-old freshman as only !
| a temporary situation. In four or
five years, he said, everybody will |
j will once again be dominated by j
teen-agers. "Why should wc con- j
demn what we enjoyed so much at
17?" he asks,
"I don't care about name j
hands," was a typical remark, j
There's usually so much noise at !
the dances one can hardly hear

the hand anyway. Besides, lots
of fellows can't dance to a fast
tempo. Five-dollar bids for Ted
FioKito — outrageous, fantastic,
j unwarranted; I wouldn't even pay
1 that for Spade Cooley!"
The prospect of fraternities re
turning to the campus social life
j drew a mixed response from ex
j G.l.'s. Many who obviously wished
to remain anonymous used such
phrases as "breeding group for po
-1 litical cliques," "alumni-dominated

snobs," and "needless waste of
money" to describe frats. "We
came here to study," they said.
Others like George Mullin, ex-Air
Force lieutenant, held that there
was much fellowship to be gained
from fraternity life, and that asso
ciations made in this manner would
be invaluable in later life. "I've al
ways thought that frat dances and
activities add an essential gaiety to
campus life."
By far the largest group of ex
servicemen, however, have found
little time to crawl from their En
cina wigwams to any big pow
wows. Study habits must be re
acquired; skull facilities, reac
tivated. Much can be forgotten
in three or four years. Speaking
for this "eager beaver" group is
Dick Keep, who savs. "I don't
want people to think I'm anti
social or anything, but competi
tion for Med School is stiff and it
has been a long time since I pe
rused ye oldc text. Hut I do like
what I've seen of Stanford social
life."
