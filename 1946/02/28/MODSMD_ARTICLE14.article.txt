### MARTHA SCHWIMLEY 
One and a half million American
men are still overseas with the oc
cupational foi'ces. Have Stanford
students forgotten thorn? There are
172,000 servicemen lying wounded
in hospitals. Is the post-war Farm
life causing students to forget them
also?
Stanford is conducting its first
peacetime Red Cross Drive in four
years. During the war this Univer
sity always went over its quota in
these drives. This year the bark
to - normal, post - war Stanford is
falling down in its obligations to
the American men who won the
war for us and those who are help
ing to preserve the peace for us,
according to the chairmen of the
drive.
Last Days
Today and tomorrow arc the last
days of the Farm's Red Cross Drive.
Up to !> p.m. yesterday, Stanford
students had contributed $794.23 to
a drive which has a quota of $3,000.
The Farm has an enrollment this
quarter of almost 4,400. According
to Nancy Banning, the drive ehair

man, every student is not expected
to contribute the requested $2, but
every student who can contribute
anything is urged to give up some
amount to an organization which is
badly needed throughout the world.

Merle Beuttel, the treasurer of
the Red Cross Drive, has announced
that two men's halls have turned
in contributions: Buchanan and
Lincoln. Cubberlcy and Storey

Miss Bcuttel has requested that
all living group solicitors turn in
any donations they have received

President Tresidder says in
connection with the Red Cross
Drive:
"Victory did not end the work
of the American Red Cross. Again
the organization requires the full
est possible support from all of
us if it is to maintain its in
valuable services to the men in
the armed forces, in the hospitals,
and to (he veterans readjusting to
civilian life. Continuation of an
adequate Red Cross program
overseas will help to solve the
morale problem that has ham
pered the effectiveness of our ar
mies of occupation. Here at home
the Red Cross has many urgent
calls for assistance. We can and
must 'Keep the Red Cross by His
Side'â€”whether he is in an army
of occupation, in training camp,
in the hospital, or already hack in
civilian life."
