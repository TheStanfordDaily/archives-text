# Education Talk Tonight By Brazilian
## 
### 
"Education as a Bulwark for In
ternational Law" will be the sub
ject of a lecture by Dr. Jorge Ame
ricano, president of the University
of Sao Paulo, Brazil, tonight at 7:30
in Cubberley Auditorium. The pub
lic is invited lo attend the lecture.
Dr. Americano is one of Latin
America's most distinguished law
yers, and is the founder of the
Foundation for University Re
search, which is comparable to
the Rockefeller Foundation in the
United States. He is now touring
American universities as guest of
the State Department, gaining
ideas to be incorporated into the
campus planned for the Univer
sity of Sao Paido.
The new plan for Sao Paulo is
one of many being drawn up in
South America. Until now all
South American universities were
like those in France, where the var
ious departments and schools are
scattered all over a town rather
than being concentrated in one lo
cality.
The city of Sao Paulo is now en
joying a rapid industrial growth,
and many new institutions have
been planned, of which the univer
sity is the most important. A simi
lar plan for a university in Rio de
Janeiro is being drawn up.
Both the Rio de Janeiro and
Sao Paulo plans are spectacular.
The former is to join the two
small islands in the bay of Rio,
making a large, fiat island, where
the university can be built, while
in Sao Paulo the plan is to make
use of Â« large stretch of rolling
land some distance from the coast.
The site is not so spectacular, but
the layout is an ambitious ex
ample of rational planning. The
university at Sao Paulo is very
very likely to be completed before
that in Rio de Janeiro, because
of (lie methodical planning so
characteristic of (he Paulists.
Because of the industrial devel
opment of Sao Paulo, the univer
sity will have a strong industrial
school, but all faculties will he
represented.
Adjacent to the proposed site of
the Sao Paulo University is the
famous Butantan snake farm
which enjoys a wide reputation
in South America as a source of
serums for fighting tropical dis
eases, and which is (be center of
research on serums.
After Dr. Americano's lecture in
Cubberley Auditorium tonight, he
will talk in Portuguese to the Stan
ford students of Portuguese on the
subject of education in Brazil. He
will be a guest at the Philological
Association meeting this afternoon.
