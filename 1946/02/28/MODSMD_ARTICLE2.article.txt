# Airline Head Flays Pauley

### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 (UP).â€”
President William A. Patterson of
United Airlines testified today that
Edwin W. Pauley and other repre
sentatives of the Democratic Na
tional Committee tried to get him to
make what he considered illegal
contributions during the 1944 presi
dential campaign.
He told the Senate Naval Affairs
Committee, however, that Pauley
made no direct suggestion to him
which he considered improper. But,
he said, he felt that a proposal by
George Killion, now Democratic na
tional treasurer, definitely was out
of line.
He testified that he talked with
Killion on the telephone about Kil
lion's proposal that he help raise
$35,000 for the party. When he re
fused, he said, Pauley came in on
the tail-end of the conversation to
suggest that he "think this over
twice before making your decision."
Patterson testified that a week
after his refusal to contribute, the
Civil Aeronautics Board overruled
a favorable examiner's report and
rejected United Air Lines' applica
tion for a Denver-Chicago route.
