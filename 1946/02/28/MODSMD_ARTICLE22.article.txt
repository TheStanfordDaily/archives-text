# A 						Civic Housing Bureau
## 
### 
Probably no group is more encouraged to
see the news that the Palo Alto City Council
will be asked to establish an official city
housing bureau, than some of Stanford's 600
married veterans.
The Council, if it is cognizant of the vet
erans' problem, will pass this first centralized
attempt to assist persons to locate rooms,
apartments, and homes in adjacent areas.
The project was developed by the Palo Alto
Veterans Employment and Service Council,
and announced early in the week.
E ides the obvious improvements that the
plan can make upon previous makeshift and
scattered attempts to find housing, it also
may have double-effectiveness because of
governmental backing and subseguent sup
port by any citizens of Palo Alto who have

been reluctant in the past to entrust their
homes and rooms to housing agencies. By
these means much more housing space
should actually be brought into circulation.
Personnel to operate the service would be
volunteers, particularly from the AWVS, re
lieving the city of the duty of manning the
office. Since Stanford would benefit directly
from the plan, the Farm should be represent
ed on the list of volunteers needed to make
it workable. Of interest, along this line, is the
fact that the original motion was made by
David Faville, professor of marketing and
chairman of our own Veterans' Committee.
Civic government, in action, is a rare but
satisfying thing to note. We take cheer from
this example of the community cooperation
of Palo Alto and Stanford.
