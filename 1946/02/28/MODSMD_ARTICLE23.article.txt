To Stanford Students:
'I he puipose of this statement is to familiarize
students with stricter enforcement of the Funda
ment.tl Standard, and more specifically, the Honor
Code.
The Councils for student control realize that
for the most part violations of these codes for stu
dent conduct have not been given the maximum
possible penalty—expulsion—during the war. How
evt ■, the time has come to revitalize these integral
paj t of Stanford student life.
We, representing the Student Councils, want
to take this opportunity to acquaint the student
body with the fact that in the future, as a general
rule, the penalty for violation of the Honor Code

will be expulsion and those of the Fundamental
Standard will be increased proportionately.
Stanford has long been known as the originator
of the Honor Code. It' is the hope of Men's and
Women's Councils that by revitalizing the Funda
mental Standard generally (and this includes the
llonor Code, which is a specific part of the Funda
mental Standard pertaining to academic matters
only), Stanford may continue to be known as the
institution which- assures all students a full meas
ure of individual responsibility and freedom.
