### H.D. THOREAU 
Pumor: Harry Truman may run for Governor
of Missouri in 1948.

The seven-day trudge around campus l>ehind
14 - pound sledge-hammers has begun for four
pled'.'Ts of Hammer & Coffin, Boris Wolper, Stan
Shp-'iner, Al Larson, and Bob Symons ("y" like in
Smythe). The purpose of this ritual is to make the
initiates conscious of the gravity of joining H & C.
By the end of the week the boys are quite con
scious of yravity at any rate.
You can co-operate with the honorary honor
society by hiding the pledges' hammers as often as
possible. This gives a member a chance to catch
the neophyte sans hammer, and mark up one
brown mark against him.
Five brown marks make a black mark, and one
black mark means that the pledge must walk
around in a coffin for a week. Of course during
winter quarter many of us walk around coughin'.
* * #
Will Rogers, Jr., Stanford grad and ex-Con
gressman from California, will speak to the Palo
Alto chapter of the A.V.C. March 6 in an open
meeting which should prove very interesting. Our

opinion is that if one feels the need for joining a
veterans' group, the A.V.C. is by far the least
offensive.
* * *
Note to basketball players: Don't hang up your
knee pads yet. Although our last scheduled game
was completed last evening, there is still a chance
for further competition.
The New York Herald-Tribune is sponsoring a
charity East-West basketball game to be played in
Madison Square Garden in New York, March 30.
It is patterned after the Shrine East-West football
classic in Frisco each New Year's Day.
Each college student is allowed to vote for ten
cagers from his section, the ten men receiving
the highest count to be given an all-expense-paid
trip to Gotham.
* * *
At 4 p>.m. Friday an old Farm tradition, the
Irish Marathon, is being renewed. Each class props
up two dozen men who run successive furlongs in
relay fashion, the team completing the stipulated
distance first getting Cinderella's glass track shoe.
Tear yourself away from the books and trip out
to Angell Field.

You can co-operate with the honorary honor
society by hiding the pledges' hammers as often as
possible. This gives a member a chance to catch
the neophyte sans hammer, and mark up one
brown mark against him.
Five brown marks make a black mark, and one
black mark means that the pledge must walk
around in a coffin for a week. Of course during
winter quarter many of us walk around coughin'.

Will Rogers, Jr., Stanford grad and ex-Con
gressman from California, will speak to the Palo
Alto chapter of the A.V.C. March 6 in an open

veterans' group, the A.V.C. is by far the least
offensive.

Note to basketball players: Don't hang up your
knee pads yet. Although our last scheduled game
was completed last evening, there is still a chance
for further competition.
The New York Herald-Tribune is sponsoring a
charity East-West basketball game to be played in
Madison Square Garden in New York, March 30.
It is patterned after the Shrine East-West football
classic in Frisco each New Year's Day.
Each college student is allowed to vote for ten
cagers from his section, the ten men receiving
the highest count to be given an all-expense-paid
trip to Gotham.

At 4 p>.m. Friday an old Farm tradition, the
Irish Marathon, is being renewed. Each class props
up two dozen men who run successive furlongs in
relay fashion, the team completing the stipulated
distance first getting Cinderella's glass track shoe.
Tear yourself away from the books and trip out
to Angell Field.
