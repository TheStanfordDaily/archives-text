# HISTORY—1946
## 
### ELLIOTT EPSTEEN 
The full story of the inflationary pressure today
is told by the fact that we have 210 billion dollars
in money and credit in operation now, and less
goods than we did in 1929, while, in 1939, we had
only some 65 billion dollars loose in the country.
The great amount of excess purchasing power
is the best possible reason why we should continue
OPA. If we did not, the limited supply of goods
and services would soon skyrocket in price.
PRODUCTION?
Complete production is not the answer. With
this much excess, we would soon multiply our pro
ductive powers until we would be back where we
were in 1930, and, in the meantime, savings would
he wiped away by the inflation necessary to give
that production lull reign. That is the reason why
the National Association of Manufacturers' argu
ment to end controls i.s not sound.
IS OPA A SUCCESS?
But is economic stabilization, as if is constituted
now, a success? It is true that the lid is on the
economic situation to a certain extent. The infla
tion in existence now is nothing compared to what
it could be.
But inflations mount gradually at first. The
beginning symptoms are rising prices and develop
ing shortages, and then, at the end, the blowup
comes sharply and suddenly.
The government and the OPA are not holding
down anything. They are increasing prices and
wages, and accomplishing nothing but cutting down
production due to an unrealistically low height of
the latter, so th»re will be nothing to prevent them
from backing up too far.
INFLATION PROBLEM
The real problem of inflation -now i.s the easy

money system which we have now.
During a depression, the policy of a government
should be to create cheap and expanded capital
sources to bring the supply of money up to the
supply of goods. The New Deal did this. During a
war, a government has to increase this process in
order to finance its military operations. This was
done too.
However, during an inflationary period, this
money should be taxed out. of existence and steril
ized. The easy money systems of preceding times
are then not only usless, but dangerous.
POLITICAL VICE
Yet enforced long-term government loans at low
interest rates become a vice. A political system
becomes huilt up around them. It is hard to break.
Higher taxes, less unemployment relief, and less
subsidies are a hard thing to put through; yet,
without them, there can be no real solution to in
flation, because thore will always be too much
credit and too many leaks.
For instance, if we ended the jobless pay bill
now, we could recruit a lot of men into necessary,
productive jobs and decrease (he cost of labor.
This would increase production and cut prices,
and it would help the people at first affected by
helping the whole country.
We could double and triple taxes to take more
money out of circulation, and put in stringent laws
on capital reserves needed in banks as well as
taxing stock transfers highly. This would alienate
everybody, but it would also remedy the situation.
The real inflationary problem is that the present
government is built on inflation, and doesn't have
quite the courage to explain that what seems a
robbery at first is actually a much-needed eco
nomic medicine.
