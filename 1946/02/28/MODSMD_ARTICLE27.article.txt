# ON THE DISCS
## 
### LARRY FRANKLEY GEORGE ECKSTEIN 
Once again the small aggregation
of music lovers — featuring dark
glasses and black overcoats with
collars pulled up around their necks
and more resembling elfs than crit
ics (what are we saying—that's us)
—pick up their pencils and paper
and head for the local platter shop
penguin style. Weaving in and out
among the sun bathers, we finally
reach our destination —the Hot Jazz
Society of Lower University Avenue
where the Elite Meet to Beat their
Feet.
Through the din produced by the
Duke's "Black, Brown, and Beige,"
Robinski's "Moan in Q Sharp," and
Sammy Kaye's beating his brains
out on "I Didn't Mean All the Things
1 Said" all playing at onqe, come the.
refiains of the new Coleman Haw
kins' Quartet recording of "Night
and Day." With Teddy Wilson at
the piano and the "Hawk" really
winding up a couple of choruses, the
Keynote Recording Co. has done a
fine job in cutting these artists.
Incidentally, Keynote and Sunset
Records are now available in Palo
Alto. For those not familiar with the
Sunset label, we might mention that
from their studios have been issued
outstanding records featuring such
musicians as Charlie Shavers, Nat
Cole alias "Sammy Smaltz," Buddy
Rich, Andre Previn, and Les Paul.
No Flaw Shaw
That "Temperamental" Gentleman
of Swing, Artie Shaw, has come up
with a new and really great Gra
mercy Five disc. The tunes (if they
can be classified as such) are "Mys
terioso," a title which fits the mood
perfectly, and "Hop, Skip, and
Jump," and it does—jump, that is.
Featuring the trumpet of Roy El
dridge, the piano ol' Dodo Marma
rosa, and, of course, the clarinet of
Mr. Shaw, both sides are full of
snappy little riffs and good solos.
Since Artie has given up the use of
the harpsichord in his Five, this disc
is the nearest thing to the Goodman
Sextet platters since Benny himself
turned the classics out.
Shore Sure
Dinah Shore, the gal with the well
developed "personality," has just re
leased her first Columbia disc ten
derly entitled "Here I Go Again."
It's another one of those romantic
ballads that doesn't take too long to
reach the top of the juke-box pa

rade. The other side has to do with
something about Hies in the pie or
pass the apples, Aunt Dowdy—
"Shoo Fly Pie and Apple Pan
Dowdy."
It seems that we can't get by a
week without having something to
gripe about and this week the Decca
Recording Co. has really provided
the "beef of the week"..!!!
We were mildly overjoyed at the
sight, of Lionel Hampton's newest
disc, "Slide, Hamp, Slide" and "Hey!
Ba Ba Re Bop" (spelled backwards
it's "Pob Er Ab Ab! Yeh!") but our
joy soon was ended with the play
ing of the first side. Everything
started out great with Arnette
Cobbs' tenor taking the lead, but
then as we progressed to what we
think was meant to be a vibes solo
by "Pops," we were sharply deaf
ened by the surface noise which
promptly made us run from the
booth, holding our head, and
screaming that even Guy "I've Gotta
Support My Family, Don't I"
wouldn't do a thing like lhat to us.
After we had reassured ourselves,
we grabbed a stack of the Hampton
platters and proceeded to test them
all. Right in the middle of the rec
ord the surface is so poor that you
can't tell whether you are listening
to Lionel Hampton or a sound effect
recording of The Charge of The
Light Brigade. Seriously, it is really
disgraceful for a company of Decca's
stature to issue a bisquit such as
this. Onions of the week to Mr.
Jack Kapp, president of Decca.

and head for the local platter shop
penguin style. Weaving in and out
among the sun bathers, we finally
reach our destination —the Hot Jazz
Society of Lower University Avenue
where the Elite Meet to Beat their
Feet.
Through the din produced by the
Duke's "Black, Brown, and Beige,"
Robinski's "Moan in Q Sharp," and
Sammy Kaye's beating his brains
out on "I Didn't Mean All the Things
1 Said" all playing at onqe, come the.
refiains of the new Coleman Haw
kins' Quartet recording of "Night
and Day." With Teddy Wilson at
the piano and the "Hawk" really
winding up a couple of choruses, the
Keynote Recording Co. has done a
fine job in cutting these artists.
Incidentally, Keynote and Sunset
Records are now available in Palo
Alto. For those not familiar with the
Sunset label, we might mention that
from their studios have been issued
outstanding records featuring such
musicians as Charlie Shavers, Nat
Cole alias "Sammy Smaltz," Buddy
Rich, Andre Previn, and Les Paul.
No Flaw Shaw
That "Temperamental" Gentleman
of Swing, Artie Shaw, has come up
with a new and really great Gra
mercy Five disc. The tunes (if they
can be classified as such) are "Mys
terioso," a title which fits the mood
perfectly, and "Hop, Skip, and
Jump," and it does—jump, that is.
Featuring the trumpet of Roy El
dridge, the piano ol' Dodo Marma
rosa, and, of course, the clarinet of
Mr. Shaw, both sides are full of
snappy little riffs and good solos.
Since Artie has given up the use of
the harpsichord in his Five, this disc
is the nearest thing to the Goodman
Sextet platters since Benny himself
turned the classics out.
Shore Sure
Dinah Shore, the gal with the well
developed "personality," has just re
leased her first Columbia disc ten
derly entitled "Here I Go Again."
It's another one of those romantic
ballads that doesn't take too long to
reach the top of the juke-box pa

rade. The other side has to do with
something about Hies in the pie or
pass the apples, Aunt Dowdy—
"Shoo Fly Pie and Apple Pan
Dowdy."
It seems that we can't get by a
week without having something to
gripe about and this week the Decca
Recording Co. has really provided
the "beef of the week"..!!!
We were mildly overjoyed at the
sight, of Lionel Hampton's newest
disc, "Slide, Hamp, Slide" and "Hey!
Ba Ba Re Bop" (spelled backwards
it's "Pob Er Ab Ab! Yeh!") but our
joy soon was ended with the play
ing of the first side. Everything
started out great with Arnette
Cobbs' tenor taking the lead, but
then as we progressed to what we
think was meant to be a vibes solo
by "Pops," we were sharply deaf
ened by the surface noise which
promptly made us run from the
booth, holding our head, and
screaming that even Guy "I've Gotta
Support My Family, Don't I"
wouldn't do a thing like lhat to us.
After we had reassured ourselves,
we grabbed a stack of the Hampton
platters and proceeded to test them
all. Right in the middle of the rec
ord the surface is so poor that you
can't tell whether you are listening
to Lionel Hampton or a sound effect
recording of The Charge of The
Light Brigade. Seriously, it is really
disgraceful for a company of Decca's
stature to issue a bisquit such as
this. Onions of the week to Mr.
Jack Kapp, president of Decca.
Once again the small aggregation
of music lovers — featuring dark
glasses and black overcoats with
collars pulled up around their necks
and more resembling elfs than crit
ics (what are we saying—that's us)
