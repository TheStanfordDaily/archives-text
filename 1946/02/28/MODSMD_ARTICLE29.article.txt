# 'Bells of Saint Mary's' Lacks Charm Of Previous Crosby, McCrary Movie
## 
### 
Academy Award winners aVe
found in abundance these days at
the Stanford Theater as Ingrid
Bergman and Bing Crosby go
through their paces for Leo McCa
rey's "Bells of St. Mary's."
Crosby and McCarey were the
team that took the Academy Award
for "Going My Way" last year. An
elderly Irish gentleman, Barry Fitz
gerald, helped immeasurably in that
production.
Lacks First Play's Charm
In "St. Mary's," Fitzgerald is re
. placed in the script by Ingrid Berg
man. A very nice substitution to
| say the least, but somehow the
j charm of "Going My Way" is par
; tially lost. Possibly it is because
McCarey's first production within
the cloisters was a novelty. Now,
with a first hit behind him, McCa
rey has attempted to duplicate his
feat. His duplication was too per
fect. "The Bells of St. Mary's" fol
lows too closely the pattern set by
"Going My Way." The plot has a
few new twists (principally, the
scene is laid in a school run by
nuns instead of in a church) but
j throughout the picture you get the
I feeling that you've seen all this
somewhere before.
Song Overrated
Crosby, looking years older than
he has in other productions, re
stricts himself to warbling two
songs. "Aren't You Glad You're
You?" comes in for a lot of unwar
ranted attention throughout the
movie.
Ingrid Bergman, who has had a
variety of roles in her brief Holly
wood career ranging from a Span

■ ish native to a woman psychiatrist, I
does well by her role of Sister Ben- j
edict in "St. Mary's." Her restrained
performance of a difficult role is
executed beautifully.
McCarey Direction Skilled
Leo McCarev's direction is subtle
j and always in good taste. There is !
| nothing in the movie that either
; Catholics or Protestants should ob
ject to. All in all, "Bells of St. Ma

ry's" is good entertainment. As
other reviewers might say, "take
the children with you."—Bob Peck

McCarey Direction Skilled
Leo McCarev's direction is subtle
j and always in good taste. There is !
| nothing in the movie that either
; Catholics or Protestants should ob
ject to. All in all, "Bells of St. Ma

ry's" is good entertainment. As
other reviewers might say, "take
the children with you."—Bob Peck
