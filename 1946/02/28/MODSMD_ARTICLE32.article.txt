A two-way tie exists at the moment in the final running of the North
ern Division basketball schedule. Tuesday night Idaho dropped a 43-40
contest to Oregon, which dropped them to a tie with Oregon State. Both
teams have one game apiece left this season. Idaho takes on W.S.C. in
their home pavilion in Moscow, Potatoeland, and Oregon entertains their
Corvallis rivals, 0.5.C., in the Eugene hardwoods.
It both teams »»in. or lose, then a play-oIT will be necessary between
the Vandals and the Cougars. Any other combination of defeats or vic
tories will place one team in the definite lead, and thereby give the
right to play California, Southern Division winners, for conference title
honors.
The games with California will be played at Berkeley on March 8 and
9. If there are Stanford campus dwellers who have the urge to attend
either of the games, they had better —post haste—contact the Cal ticket
office for ducats.

From Jack Friel. basketball mentor at W.S.C., roines his selection of
an all-opponent northern team. The Cougar mentor selected Len Pyne,
Idaho, and Bob Hamilton, Oregon, for the guard positions; elongated
Red Rocha of Oregon State for center; and Dick Wilkins, Oregon, and
Fred Quinn. Idaho, at the forward posts. An impressive team, to say
the least. And putting on such notables as Gayle Bishop and Vince
Hanson, both of W.S.C., on the team, you would really have a potent
aggregation.

It will be very interesting to see the results from the Tony Lupien
baseball decision. Lupien covered the first sack position for the lowly
Phillies before he donned the khakies. But while in the service, the
Phillies, who are on a rebuilding campaign—so they say—obtained Frank
McCormick from Cincinnati to play first base, and sold Lupien down the
river to the Hollywood Stars.
Anthony L., now out of the service, raised a howl when informed of
i his demotion to minor league baseball, and stated that under Selective
' Service regulations he should be given his old job back, and that if then
he didn't prove his worth, he could be gotten rid of; but that it was illegal
to peddle him out of the majors before he was even given a chance. (My
! gosh, what a long sentence!)
This department doesn't care to hazard a guess on what the ruling
| will be from Selective Service. (They do some of the gosh-darnedest
I things.) If they rule that Lupien should be given a chance to compete for
I his former job with McCormick, we doubt if Lupien will make out better
than second in the race. If, on the other hand, they say that it was legal
for the Phillies to sell him to Hollywood, then Lupien can at least have
dreams of the possibility that he might have beaten Frank out for the job.
But we can't see why Tony should complain too much. Playing for
Hollywood isn't so bad. The weather is nice down south. The food is okay.
He can have the afternoons to 101 l on the Santa Monica sands. The pay
probably will be satisfactory. No, we think Lupien should have thought it
over twice before he moaned.

score. All you have to do now is to glance over a few columns, compare

The score: Stanford, 42; U.S.F., 39.

Since this column is being ejected from the Underwood before game
time tonight at the Pavilion, we would like to make a prediction on the
score. All you have to do now is to glance over a few columns, compare
scores, and then laugh at this writer for such lousy prognosticating.
The score: Stanford, 42; U.S.F., 39.

M o _the story that a six-day bike race around the Quad between Roble

to squash any reports to the contrary.
A two-way tie exists at the moment in the final running of the North
ern Division basketball schedule. Tuesday night Idaho dropped a 43-40
contest to Oregon, which dropped them to a tie with Oregon State. Both
teams have one game apiece left this season. Idaho takes on W.S.C. in
their home pavilion in Moscow, Potatoeland, and Oregon entertains their
Corvallis rivals, 0.5.C., in the Eugene hardwoods.
It both teams »»in. or lose, then a play-oIT will be necessary between
the Vandals and the Cougars. Any other combination of defeats or vic
tories will place one team in the definite lead, and thereby give the
right to play California, Southern Division winners, for conference title
honors.
The games with California will be played at Berkeley on March 8 and
9. If there are Stanford campus dwellers who have the urge to attend
either of the games, they had better —post haste—contact the Cal ticket
office for ducats.

From Jack Friel. basketball mentor at W.S.C., roines his selection of
an all-opponent northern team. The Cougar mentor selected Len Pyne,
Idaho, and Bob Hamilton, Oregon, for the guard positions; elongated
Red Rocha of Oregon State for center; and Dick Wilkins, Oregon, and
Fred Quinn. Idaho, at the forward posts. An impressive team, to say
the least. And putting on such notables as Gayle Bishop and Vince
Hanson, both of W.S.C., on the team, you would really have a potent

It will be very interesting to see the results from the Tony Lupien
baseball decision. Lupien covered the first sack position for the lowly
Phillies before he donned the khakies. But while in the service, the
Phillies, who are on a rebuilding campaign—so they say—obtained Frank
McCormick from Cincinnati to play first base, and sold Lupien down the
river to the Hollywood Stars.
Anthony L., now out of the service, raised a howl when informed of
i his demotion to minor league baseball, and stated that under Selective
' Service regulations he should be given his old job back, and that if then
he didn't prove his worth, he could be gotten rid of; but that it was illegal
to peddle him out of the majors before he was even given a chance. (My
! gosh, what a long sentence!)
This department doesn't care to hazard a guess on what the ruling
| will be from Selective Service. (They do some of the gosh-darnedest
I things.) If they rule that Lupien should be given a chance to compete for
I his former job with McCormick, we doubt if Lupien will make out better
than second in the race. If, on the other hand, they say that it was legal
for the Phillies to sell him to Hollywood, then Lupien can at least have
dreams of the possibility that he might have beaten Frank out for the job.
