Editor's note)

In a little office in the B,A,C.
Building is a piece of paper tacked
to the bulkhead. The paper in it
self is meaningless, but on it is re
corded a large portion of the glory
that was Stanford's.
The marks on the paper are the
J world's records that Stanford men
j set in track and sport, from 1904
on and in events ranging from
| the shot put to the two-mile re
lay.
In 1904, Norman Dole set the
sports world on its ear by being the
first man ever to pole-vault over an
"unattainable" 12 feet. Dole used
a spruce pole to vault to 12 feet, 1
and 8/25 inches in the Pacific Coast
| Championships and Olympic Games
tryouts at Berkeley.
Dole had cleared 12 feet several
times earlier that year in prac
tice, but that was the first time
he had done it in competition.
According to the Dippy of April

j 25, '04. Dole took several tries at
12 feet 4, but was pursued by bad
luck. Once his pole broke under
him. and though he went over, the
bar toppled to the ground. At any
rate. Dole's record stayed on the
books for four years.
Six years after Dole broke the
world's record, another Stanford
man, Leland S. Scott, posted a new
mark in the Berkeley Relay Carni
val. Scott was the first man to uti
lize the "whip" of the bamboo pole,
which was just coming into use at
that time, and at his third try for a
new world's mark went over at 12
feet 10 7 /r inches.
Scott's record stood for two years,
at which time Stanford's supremacy
in vaulting came to an end.
A man whose back yard was too
small to try the accepted method of
high jumping started one of the
most virulent and vitriolic contro
versies that the track world had
ever known. And it also awakened
the rest of the sports world that
the West was a factor to be reck
oned with in track and field.
George Horine was the Stanford
ite's name, and it was he who de
veloped the Western roll style of
jumping. Up .until that time all
jumpers jumped an Eastern scis
sors, or variations of it, as did Mike
Sweeney of the New York Athletic
Club when he set the record of (>
feet 5% inches in 189(5.
But the scissors required a
lengthy takc-oIT, and Horine was
required to adapt another style
suitable to the small yard he did
his practicing in. But the rules at
the time demanded that a man's
feet go over the bar and his head
he higher than his feet. Horine s
method of jumping completely
disregarded the rules, and the
| fight was on.
