# Cardinal Quintet Tops Dons, 33-29
## 
### STU MILIAR 
Stanford's varsity basketball team
finished the season in a blaze last
night to defeat a weakened Uni
versity of San Francisco quintet by
a score of 33 to 29 in the Pavilion.
Top man for the Cardinal five
and for the evening was IJill O'-
Brien, six-foot six-inch pivot man
who scored four buckets and a
free throw for nine points. Com
bining accuracy with the finesse
he has had in many previous
games, O'Brien probably meant
the difference between victory
and defeat for the Indians.
Five other men split rupper-up
honors. Fahey, Desmond, and Gib
son of the Dons, and Rodman and
Murphy of the Cards, all scored
seven markers.
The visitors' average was one of
the lowest in the Pavilion all sea
son; although the Dons pierced the
Stanford man-to-man defense eas
ily, their shots from close in and
the circle rolled out again and
again. The Dons made only five
gift shots all evening, although the
Farm five committed 15 personal
fouls and a couple of technicals.
Coach Everett I)ean helped the
backboard strength of the locals
considerably by playing O'Brien
and Tom Murphy, another six
and-a-half-footer, at the same
time. Murphy played offensive
forward and defensive guard in
order to get the maximum num
ber of rebounds; he was instru
mental in the 10-point surge in
the second half but had to leave
the game a short time afterward
tin personal fouls.
Tom Rodman also helped the In
dians greatly w"ith his aggressive
backboard play and good guarding.
Shining for San Francisco were
Desmond and Gibson. Desmond,
playing for the first time this sea
son on ani njured foot in an attempt
to make up for the loss of Giesan,
U.S.F. star in a mid-season game,
showed as much class as anyone on
the floor. Gibson gave his guards
a hard time all evening with some

tricky ball handling.

fouls and a couple of technicals.
Coach Everett I)ean helped the
backboard strength of the locals
considerably by playing O'Brien
and Tom Murphy, another six
and-a-half-footer, at the same
time. Murphy played offensive
forward and defensive guard in
order to get the maximum num
ber of rebounds; he was instru
mental in the 10-point surge in
the second half but had to leave
the game a short time afterward
tin personal fouls.
Tom Rodman also helped the In
dians greatly w"ith his aggressive
backboard play and good guarding.
Shining for San Francisco were
Desmond and Gibson. Desmond,
playing for the first time this sea
son on ani njured foot in an attempt
to make up for the loss of Giesan,
U.S.F. star in a mid-season game,
showed as much class as anyone on
the floor. Gibson gave his guards
a hard time all evening with some

tricky ball handling.

Stanford's varsity basketball team
finished the season in a blaze last
night to defeat a weakened Uni
versity of San Francisco quintet by
a score of 33 to 29 in the Pavilion.
Top man for the Cardinal five
and for the evening was IJill O'-
Brien, six-foot six-inch pivot man
who scored four buckets and a
free throw for nine points. Com
bining accuracy with the finesse
he has had in many previous
games, O'Brien probably meant
the difference between victory
and defeat for the Indians.
Five other men split rupper-up
honors. Fahey, Desmond, and Gib
son of the Dons, and Rodman and
Murphy of the Cards, all scored
seven markers.
The visitors' average was one of
the lowest in the Pavilion all sea
son; although the Dons pierced the
Stanford man-to-man defense eas
ily, their shots from close in and
the circle rolled out again and
again. The Dons made only five
gift shots all evening, although the
Farm five committed 15 personal
fouls and a couple of technicals.
