# Farm Law Student Cited For Films of Enemy Sub
## 
### JEAN BURNET 
Ducking down under the net on
the bottom ol the life raft as it
slithered into a gully formed by
mountainous swells, the young
American naval officer reloaded his
camera and prepared to take more
close-up shots of the submarine
which had just laid his troop trans
port in its watery grave.
The miniature camera, in its wa
terproof case, was concealed under
his belt and covered by a kapok life
jacket. When the next swell brought
the sub and the raft side by side,
the alert eye of the camera focused
on the star of the* dramatic scene,
the triumphant German skipper,
dressed in white doeskin boots and
jacket and black Jantzen swimming
trunks, as he stood on the rolling
deck of his submarine. The spe
cially prepared film carefully re
corded every detail.
Germans Unaware
The star was perfectly natural,
being complete unaware, as were
the two watchful machine-gunners
who flanked him, that every time
the heavy swells of the running sea
tossed the tiny raft and the long
slim sub together, they were having
their pictures taken. They did not
notice how the other survivors on
the raft ducked down to clear the
way for exposures that were to tell
experts that this submarine was a
squadron leader of a new wolf pack
which was menacing Allied ship
ping in the critical months of 1942.
The American transport, carrying
men and supplies to the Marines on

| Guadalcanal, was hit by two tor
! pedoes on a sunny spring day in
1942. A young officer, Lt. (j.g.)
Malcolm MeLeod, now a Stanford
| law student, rushed to his quarters
! to get his special miniature camera
before abandoning ship.
Talks with German
Shortly the victorious enemy sub
drew alongside his life raft and
ordered him aboard for question
ing. Before his 20-minute inter
view with the German skipper he
was searched, but not thoroughly,
for his camera and a loaded .45
were overlooked. While he was
being questioned by the English
speaking officer of the German
navy, the stern of the fast-sinking
transport 500 yards away sub
merged, shooting the bow straight
up in the air and sending the spare
anchor crashing down the deck and
into the deckhouse with a terrifying
roar. Everyone turned to look at
the ship as it sank beneath the wa
ters of the Caribbean Sea, and the
German said quietly with his Ox
ford accent, "I am sorry to sink
such a fine ship, but this is war."
The lieutenant, well trained in
j the art of taking pictures incon
spicuously, was returned to his life
raft where, on succeeding swells,
he took 60 shots of the submarine
and its crew. The undertaking was
one which called for daring and
vigilance, because one wrong move
might pull the triggers of the mur
derous machine - guns. The effi
ciency with which he rolled and
reloaded the film had to be timed
to the split second, because his
only protection for the process was
I the wall of water which periodically
I separated him from the keen eyes
of the sub crew.
MeLeod Photographed
The Germans, too, had a flair for
i picture-taking. The skipper gen-

I erously offered MeLeod a carton of
! cigarettes, which he extended to
j him. When the American reached

i out his hand to accept them, the
: skipper shook his hand while movie
| and still shots were taken by the
! members of the crew for propa
! ganda purposes. MeLeod later had
the weak "tobacco" analyzed and
| found that it was made of wood.
After the sub left the scene of its
crime, the 180 survivors spent the
next eight days on their rafts be
! fore they were picked up by a Co
! lombian schooner. "The crew were
j very generous with their food,"
I pointed out MeLeod, "but they
j failed to ration it, and within two
j hours there wasn't a scrap of food
j aboard ship. Consequently, we all
! starved for three days until we
put into port!"
Films Developed
Anxiously, the lieutenant devel
oped the five rolls of 120 film in a
| Navy laboratory in Panama. He
was not disappointed, for each one
| of the pictures, which were taken
I while he was knee-deep in water
j and under terrific strain, was cor
| rectly exposed. These pictures,
which merited him Gallantly in
Action citations from the Secretary
of the Navy and other Navy De
partment officials, were the first to
be taken of the new type of wolf
pack submarine.
Besides serving as gunnery offi
cer aboard five different ships, Me-
Leod, who was a lieutenant com
mander when he received his dis
charge from the Navy, acted as aide
to the naval attache in South Af
rica. It was there, in Johannesburg,
that he got his special German
camera, a Zeiss Super Ikonta B,
which was to add almost 5.000 pho
tographs to his complete pictorial
record of life in the Navy.
Battle Pictures
He took pictures on widely scat
tered battlefronts including Algiers,
Tunis, Australia, Borneo, New Zea
land, Korea, China, Japan, and the
Philippines. The action - packed
shots of the capture of Manila from
the Japanese and the air - borne
landings on Corregidor are also in
his collection.
This Stanford student has always
taken pictures, specializing in ac
tion shots of sporting events in his
pre-war college days. He received
photographic training at George

cellent, practical, and adaptable to
any situation."

Besides serving as gunnery offi

to the naval attache in South Af

that he got his special German
camera, a Zeiss Super Ikonta B,
which was to add almost 5.000 pho
tographs to his complete pictorial
record of life in the Navy.

He took pictures on widely scat
tered battlefronts including Algiers,
Tunis, Australia, Borneo, New Zea
land, Korea, China, Japan, and the
Philippines. The action - packed
shots of the capture of Manila from
the Japanese and the air - borne
landings on Corregidor are also in
his collection.
This Stanford student has always

Ducking down under the net on
the bottom ol the life raft as it
slithered into a gully formed by
mountainous swells, the young
American naval officer reloaded his
camera and prepared to take more
close-up shots of the submarine
which had just laid his troop trans
port in its watery grave.
The miniature camera, in its wa
terproof case, was concealed under
his belt and covered by a kapok life
jacket. When the next swell brought
the sub and the raft side by side,
the alert eye of the camera focused
on the star of the* dramatic scene,
the triumphant German skipper,
dressed in white doeskin boots and
jacket and black Jantzen swimming
trunks, as he stood on the rolling
deck of his submarine. The spe
cially prepared film carefully re
corded every detail.
Germans Unaware
The star was perfectly natural,
being complete unaware, as were
the two watchful machine-gunners
who flanked him, that every time
the heavy swells of the running sea
tossed the tiny raft and the long
slim sub together, they were having
their pictures taken. They did not
notice how the other survivors on
the raft ducked down to clear the
way for exposures that were to tell
experts that this submarine was a
squadron leader of a new wolf pack
which was menacing Allied ship
ping in the critical months of 1942.
The American transport, carrying

Talks with German
Shortly the victorious enemy sub
drew alongside his life raft and
ordered him aboard for question
ing. Before his 20-minute inter
view with the German skipper he
was searched, but not thoroughly,
for his camera and a loaded .45
were overlooked. While he was
being questioned by the English
speaking officer of the German
navy, the stern of the fast-sinking
transport 500 yards away sub
merged, shooting the bow straight
up in the air and sending the spare
anchor crashing down the deck and
into the deckhouse with a terrifying
roar. Everyone turned to look at
the ship as it sank beneath the wa
ters of the Caribbean Sea, and the
German said quietly with his Ox
ford accent, "I am sorry to sink
such a fine ship, but this is war."
The lieutenant, well trained in
j the art of taking pictures incon
spicuously, was returned to his life
raft where, on succeeding swells,
he took 60 shots of the submarine
and its crew. The undertaking was
one which called for daring and
vigilance, because one wrong move
might pull the triggers of the mur
derous machine - guns. The effi
ciency with which he rolled and
reloaded the film had to be timed
to the split second, because his
only protection for the process was
I the wall of water which periodically
I separated him from the keen eyes
of the sub crew.

Germans Unaware
The star was perfectly natural,
being complete unaware, as were
the two watchful machine-gunners
who flanked him, that every time
the heavy swells of the running sea
tossed the tiny raft and the long
slim sub together, they were having
their pictures taken. They did not
notice how the other survivors on
the raft ducked down to clear the
way for exposures that were to tell
experts that this submarine was a
squadron leader of a new wolf pack
which was menacing Allied ship
ping in the critical months of 1942.
The American transport, carrying
men and supplies to the Marines on

| Guadalcanal, was hit by two tor
! pedoes on a sunny spring day in
1942. A young officer, Lt. (j.g.)
Malcolm MeLeod, now a Stanford
| law student, rushed to his quarters
! to get his special miniature camera
before abandoning ship.
Talks with German
Shortly the victorious enemy sub
drew alongside his life raft and
ordered him aboard for question
ing. Before his 20-minute inter
view with the German skipper he
was searched, but not thoroughly,
for his camera and a loaded .45
were overlooked. While he was
being questioned by the English
speaking officer of the German
navy, the stern of the fast-sinking
transport 500 yards away sub
merged, shooting the bow straight
up in the air and sending the spare
anchor crashing down the deck and
into the deckhouse with a terrifying
roar. Everyone turned to look at
the ship as it sank beneath the wa
ters of the Caribbean Sea, and the
German said quietly with his Ox
ford accent, "I am sorry to sink
such a fine ship, but this is war."
The lieutenant, well trained in
j the art of taking pictures incon
spicuously, was returned to his life
raft where, on succeeding swells,
he took 60 shots of the submarine
and its crew. The undertaking was
one which called for daring and
vigilance, because one wrong move
might pull the triggers of the mur
derous machine - guns. The effi
ciency with which he rolled and
reloaded the film had to be timed
to the split second, because his
only protection for the process was
I the wall of water which periodically
I separated him from the keen eyes
of the sub crew.
MeLeod Photographed
The Germans, too, had a flair for
i picture-taking. The skipper gen-

I erously offered MeLeod a carton of
! cigarettes, which he extended to
j him. When the American reached

i out his hand to accept them, the
: skipper shook his hand while movie
| and still shots were taken by the
! members of the crew for propa
! ganda purposes. MeLeod later had
the weak "tobacco" analyzed and
| found that it was made of wood.
After the sub left the scene of its
crime, the 180 survivors spent the
next eight days on their rafts be
! fore they were picked up by a Co
! lombian schooner. "The crew were
j very generous with their food,"
I pointed out MeLeod, "but they
j failed to ration it, and within two
j hours there wasn't a scrap of food
j aboard ship. Consequently, we all
! starved for three days until we
put into port!"
Films Developed
Anxiously, the lieutenant devel
oped the five rolls of 120 film in a
| Navy laboratory in Panama. He
was not disappointed, for each one
| of the pictures, which were taken
I while he was knee-deep in water
j and under terrific strain, was cor
| rectly exposed. These pictures,
which merited him Gallantly in
Action citations from the Secretary
of the Navy and other Navy De
partment officials, were the first to
be taken of the new type of wolf
pack submarine.
Besides serving as gunnery offi
cer aboard five different ships, Me-
Leod, who was a lieutenant com
mander when he received his dis
charge from the Navy, acted as aide
to the naval attache in South Af
rica. It was there, in Johannesburg,
that he got his special German
camera, a Zeiss Super Ikonta B,
which was to add almost 5.000 pho
tographs to his complete pictorial
record of life in the Navy.
Battle Pictures
He took pictures on widely scat
tered battlefronts including Algiers,
Tunis, Australia, Borneo, New Zea
land, Korea, China, Japan, and the
Philippines. The action - packed
shots of the capture of Manila from
the Japanese and the air - borne
landings on Corregidor are also in
his collection.
This Stanford student has always
taken pictures, specializing in ac
tion shots of sporting events in his
pre-war college days. He received
photographic training at George
town University in Washington,
D.C., and he makes the statement,
"Navy photographic training is ex
cellent, practical, and adaptable to
any situation."
Ducking down under the net on
the bottom ol the life raft as it
slithered into a gully formed by
mountainous swells, the young
American naval officer reloaded his
camera and prepared to take more
close-up shots of the submarine
which had just laid his troop trans
port in its watery grave.
The miniature camera, in its wa
terproof case, was concealed under
his belt and covered by a kapok life
jacket. When the next swell brought
the sub and the raft side by side,
the alert eye of the camera focused
on the star of the* dramatic scene,
the triumphant German skipper,
dressed in white doeskin boots and
jacket and black Jantzen swimming
trunks, as he stood on the rolling
deck of his submarine. The spe
cially prepared film carefully re
