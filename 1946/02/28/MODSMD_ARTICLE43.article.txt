# Aesthetes To Discuss Role of Art
## 
### 
Believing that art plays an impor
tant role in every aspect of society,
the American Society for Aesthetics
has chosen "Art and Society" as the
general theme for a meeting Satur
day at 2:30 in the Lower Lounge of
the Women's Clubhouse. This na
tional society brings together peo
ple with interests in art theory and
interpretation, including art histor
ians, philosophers, art critics, and
artists.
Four Men on Art
Four men will read papers dealing
with different aspects of the central
theme, and discussion from the floor
will follow. Helmut Hungerland,
president of the Pacific Division of
the American Society for Aesthet
ics, will present "The Social Basis
of Art Criticism." Dr. Arturo Tor
res-Rioseco will discuss the "Real
ism in Literature" chiefly in con
nection with Latin America, which
he knows from actual experience,
as the society's initial meeting at
Stanford.
Jeffery Smith, assistant professor
of humanities and philosophy at
Stanford, will explain "Art as a
Force in History," his thesis being
that the life of art plays a creative
role in the course of history com
parable to that of politics and eco
nomics, and is not merely an expres
sion of social and economic forces as
it is often interpreted to be.
Mendelowitz to Speak
Daniel Mendelowitz, associate pro
fessor of art at Stanford, will speak
on "Creative Painting as Research in
Socially Functional Form," dealing
with the creative artist as one whose
discoveries, like those of a research
er in other fields, may be taken up
by others and may be given prac
tical or social application.
All those who are interested in the
different aspects of art and its inter
pretation are invited to attend this
meeting.
