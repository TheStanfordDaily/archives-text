# Gump's Loan Chinese Art
## 
### 
Four large Chinese panel paint
ings have been added to the ex
hibit of Oriental art now showing
at the Stanford Art Gallery. The
hangings were loaned by Gump's
Gallery in San Francisco, which
also furnished some of the other
pictures in the exhibition.
One of these silk panels shows a
smiling Buddha seated on an ornate
pedestal. It was painted by Kuan
yim during the Ming Dynasty.
Bright colors, unusual in Chinese
paintings, are used in it.
"Taoist Paradise" shows the
Chinese idea of showing the spirit
rather than the mere representa
tion of the subject. In it men and
women can be seen floating around
on fluffy clouds. This picture was
painted by Kuan llsu, a native of
llua-Tung, Kangsu. lie was a
bachelor and lived during the
reign of the sixth emperor of the
Ming dynasty about 1436.
AÂ»portrait in somber colors of a
seated ancestor, which was painted
during the Ming dynasty is another
addition. "Palace in the Mountains"
by Cho-Chan of Peking is much
newer than the other panels includ
ed in the show. It was painted dur
ing the Ch'ing dynasty between 1041
and 1912.
Sunday is the last day that the
showing of Oriental art will be on
display. Sculpture and carvings as
well as paintings are included.
