# Snyder Says Keep Price Controls On

### 
WASIIINGTON, Feb. 27 (UP).â€”
Reconversion Chief John M. Snyder
today urged Congress to extend
price controls another year to help
"keep our economic house in or
der" until production begins catch- j
ing up with demand.
Snyder told the House Banking
Committee that this did not mean
that "wo arc determined on rigid
and inflexible" price controls. He
said government policy was suffi
ciently elastic to permit price in
creases when they are shown to be
necessary.
At the same time, he said that
runaway inflation is a very real
threat. This is particularly true, he
said, because inflation feeds upon
itself.
"The assumption that prices are j
going up gives business an irresis
tible motive to withhold finished j
goods from the market in expec- I
tation of higher prices and profits," {
he said.
As a result, he said, people rush j
to buy what goods are available in j
the belief that prices are going up,
resulting in buying pressure which j
would "accentuate the already
strong demand for goods and serv- j
ices."
Snyder said it had not been de- !
termined how many shortages were i
due to the withholding of goods
from the market. But he said it
was "a practice that adds an artifi
cial scarcity to the very real short
age of goods that already exists."
