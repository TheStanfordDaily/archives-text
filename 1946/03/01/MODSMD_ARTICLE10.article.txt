Continues Battle
The Red Cross is still continuing
its battle against poverty, sickness,
and disaster even though the war
is over. Miss Banning has stated
that from the 4,400 students regis
tered at Stanford this quarter it
should be relatively easy to collect
$3,000 for an organization which is
helping to protect the peace. She
urges everyone on campus to con
tribute some amount to the Red
Cross today.
Needs Support
"The Red Cross needs Stanford's
support as well as the support of
the rest of the nation," continued
Miss Banning. She added that the
organization is,still helping Ameri
can men overseas â€” Stanford must
not forget these men now that the
war has ended.
Veterans here on campus and all
over the United States are receiving
benefits from the Red Cross. As
part of our obligation to these men,
we must not fail in this peacetime
drive.
