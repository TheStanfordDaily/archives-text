NEW YORK, Feb. 28 (UP).â€”Sec
retary of State James F. Byrnes to
night tacitly warned the Soviet Un
ion against removing property from
Manchuria as reparations and said
that to insure world peace the
United States "must make it clear
in advance that we do intend to
act to prevent aggression."
"No power has a right to help it
self to alleged enemy properties in
liberated or ex-satellite countries
before a reparation settlement has
been agreed upon by the Allies,"
Byrnes said in a speech at the
Overseas Press Club dinner here.
"We have not and will not agree
to any one power deciding for it
self what it will take from these
countries."
Although Byrnes did not mention
Russia by name in that passage of
his speech, it appeared that he re
ferred to reports that the Red Army,
has shipped machinery out of Man
churia by way of collecting Japa
nese reparations.
Byrnes' statement'also served as
denial of a remark by the Soviet
commander in Mukden, Manchuria,
who was quoted as saying that the
Big Three had agreed to the Rus
sian removal of Manchurian prop
erty.
"I am convinced that there is no
room for war between any of the
great powers," Byrnes told his au
dience.
