### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 (UP).—
Edwin W. Pauley flatly refused to
yield to pressure from Senate Dem
ocratic leaders today and told the
Senate Naval Affairs Committee
that he "cannot now consider" a
suggestion that he request President
Truman to withdraw his nomina
tion to be Undersecretary of the
Navy.
In a statement which he waited
nearly two days to deliver, Pauley
said, "I intend to stay in this and
vindicate my character—because I
know that I am right."
"My record, my character, and
my integrity have been, and still
are being, smeared by scurrilous
and unwarranted attacks," he as
serted.
His statement was in direct re
sponse to a suggestion two days ago
by Sen. Leverett Saltonstall, R.,
Mass., that he withdraw with as
surance from the committee that his
name will be cleared of various
charges made during hearings into
his qualifications.
