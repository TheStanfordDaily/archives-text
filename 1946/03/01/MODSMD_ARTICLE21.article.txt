' What is the Red Cross ever going to do
for rne?" seems to be the most common re
action to the plea for donations on the Stan
ford campus.
If those who expected to get something out
of the Red Cross were the only givers, there
would have been more than a hundred thou
sand prisoners of war, myself among them,
in Germany spending their imprisonment in
abject misery. The Red Cross, you see, could
not survive on the donations of only those
who expected to receive benefit from it.
True, the food parcels sent to us "guests of
the Reich" were paid foi by the U.S. govern
ment. But the channel through which those
parcels arrived was created and could only
have been created by such an organization.
That channel was not just an American Red
Cross product, but the unified effort of the
International Red Cross. We were supplied
by the British and Canadian Red Cross so
cieties also, and they by our Red Cross.
The two most common complaints heard
from the armed forces were the refusal of
emergency loans by the Red Cross to service
men going home on furlough, and the occa
sional sale of what was usually given to the
boys free. However I know of many con
crete examples of failure to repay the loans.
Three gunners on my bomber crew pur
por/jly didn't repay the loans, v/hen they

found out that they couldn't be caught. They
soon became the most grateful debtors to
their victims.
My answer to the occasional weakness in
the management of the Red Cross is that it
is a volunteer organization run by us. Just
as we can volunteer to help run our govern
ment by election, so can we volunteer *o
work for the Red Cross. Just as we write (or
should v/rite) to our congressmen, so we can
write to those who run the Red Cross. We
are the Red Cross, as we are the United
States government.
If San Francisco were hit by another earth
guake, what would be one of the first organ
izations to come to the relief of the crippled
sections? What was the great relief factor of
the devastating floods of the Mississippi and
other rivers? Anyone who can answer these
questions and not be glad to support the an
swer with hard cash, has a calloused con
science.
I hope I never find myself in such straits
again that I need charity, whether as a pris
oner, or refugee, or loanee. But I will, and 1
hope you will, continue to back the Red
Cross, content with the thought that we'll be
giving some unfortunate person—who may
be Chinese, Dutch, German, Russian, or
American—a lift when he needs it most, or
a little comfort when he appreciates it most.
Bob Wallis.
