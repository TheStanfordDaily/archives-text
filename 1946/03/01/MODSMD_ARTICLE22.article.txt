### STAN SHPETNER BY H.D. THOREAU 
(Written into the contract of every columnist
is a clause specifying at least one guest column
per month. This is done not only for the benefit
oi the writer, hut to give the readers a change
of sentence structure.
Since we had to sweep the hedge and clip the
the gutters at Rutherford B. Hayes liall yester
day afternoon, we thought that this would be a
line opportunity to unleash one of our string of
gho't writers, Stan Shpetner, and let him have
at v ali for a dav.
Mr. Shpetner Ca very musical name) needs no
introduction h"t is none the less to he intro
duced here and now.
Readers, Mr. Shpetner. Mr. Shpetner, the
Readers.)

Let A.S.S.U. stone-throwers Kennedy, Kolar,
McDonough, Call'ee, and their dutiful pebble-toss
ing assistants, check their own glass house.
Me dear old mother used to say, 'Bud, if you
want to be treated like a man, why not act like a
man?'
If A.S.S.U.-ites want to be treated as if they
can handle their student government without Daily
"bias," let them show it.
Check these points: On Feb. 19 between 4 and 5
p.m. A.S.S.U. President. Kennedy talked to the
women of the Union living groups. Allegedly
speaking as A.S.S.U. president, Kennedy was sup
posedly giving a pre-election orientation talk. If
you can find 15 women who heard the talk and
will testify that it was not as "biased" a talk as was
ever given, we will eat the minutes of the next
44 Excom meetings. Arid mighty poor for the
digestion they are.
Point 2: Stanford has 4,379 registered students.
A.S.S.U.-er Kennedy held an election. On the
question of constitution, 847 voted. "Backer of the
principle of non-bias" Kennedy went to great
lengths to arrange the election. He had law pro

lessor Thurman help write the referendum. It was
written (with all credit to Mr. Thurman) in first
rate legal style. We defy anyone to figure which
box was to be checked to get which effect.
Said "non-bias" Kennedy's henchwomen in a
letter to the Daily, "Editorials may favor one side
of an issue . . . however the title space (flag) should
not be used . . Is it not tacit admission that the
A.S.S.U. so weakly holds the interest of the stu
dent body that a few words on the Daily's flag
could throw the election?
Will one of the big women on campus who
are so excited on "Daily news bias" tell us some
thing? Just how in the name of Heaven, Hades,
arid the Coca-Cola Bottling Company was the
voter supposed to make an intelligent choice in
the elections?
Are we supposed to intuitively know each can
didate's good and bad points? That must be the
case, for A.S.S.U. made no move at all to give
the voters a chance to even see whose the names
were and what color sweaters they wore— let alone
if they could talk English. Or do A.S.S.U.-ers now
in office like the 847 votes out of 4,379? Does that
spell a student government that has the interest and
backing of the student body?
We have mentioned all these points in connec
tion with the "news bias" claim of the A.S.S.U.-ers
because we wish to point out the weakness, the
unrepresentativeness,and the confusion of the stu
dent government. Before attempting a philosophi
cal tirade 011 the rights of the Student Newspaper,
let the A.S.S.U.-ers learn their own business—get
it running the way it should, and then we'll be glad
to take them on on the question of the newspaper
business.
