# HISTORY—1946

### ELLIOTT EPSTEEN 
The United States is issuing a blue book on
Spain, and it is already moving to oust the Franco
reyime. Such a development is great cau.se for
rejoicing in the whole civilized world, including
Spain itself.
But the method of doing so is badly planned.
W - are trying to put through economic boycotts.
Spain can produce little itself, thanks t.o three
years of drought and blunders of the Falange, and
if her import markets were cut, there would un
doubtedly be an explosion.
Usually most dictators, no matter how detestable
they are personally, will tend to make a compro
mise lather than fight if the whole civilian mass
of their population is determined and against them.
The wording of our note on Spain shows that we
would accept a coalition between the republic and
the present army.
COMPROMISE
The Spanish generals in back of Franco might
take this loophole out. They might get rid of
Franco on the condition that they keep their power,
and then strike later to institute another military
dictatorship under a kinder name than Fascist.
Indeed, no Spanish republic will last very long
if the reactionary military group in the country
keeps control of the guns.
FIGHT
Hut what if the Spanish people refuse to make
any deal at all? The Franco regime must know

that the unspeakable atrocities it has perpetrated
and the tyrannical regime it has enforced would
bring its members quick death if they ever let go
the reins of power.
They might try lo fight, and it would be a fairly
well-armed military against a starved, unarmed,
and desperate people. The only result of our half
way policy would be the slaughter of millions of
innocent Spaniards.
ARMY PROBLRWS
W«' must realize that there can bo no real peace
in Spain so long as the old army is in power. It is
not necessary, as it can be replaced by the well
trained and intelligent staffs that grew up in the
Loyalist forces during the civil war.
We must also realize that the army will not
really step down without a tight, and that if we
want to get rid of what Franco stands for as well
as the man himself, we have to arm and mechanize
the Loyalist refugees so that the Republican side
will have a chance of winning.
It seems our actions against Franco were pre
mature. It we had organized the Spanish refugee
leaders and properly equipped the Spanish Re
publican army, we could have had a good chance
to expect a clear cut decision out of our present
moves in Spain. By not doing so, we have simply
made a bad situation worse, and have added to,
rather than terminated, the sufferings of the brave
and patient Spanish people.
