# Recorder's Office Handles Student Vital Statistics
## 
### JACKIE BOUCHER 
Back in a corner office of the Ad
ministration Building is a small
group of workers who take care of
a vital issue for every Stanford
student — both here and after his
graduation. The sign over the door
says "Recorder's Office," and it is
here that grades are posted and
filed in a series of alphabetiezd
processes.
Recorder is Miss Florine Mcin
tosh and her assistant is Mrs. Dor
othy Wood. Their work starts at
the beginning of the quarter, when
the "leg" books are brought in and
study list subjects are copied on
white office cards.
Ozalid Process
After professors' end-quarter re
ports come in, grades are copied
from white cards to "blues" (trans
parent blue paper) to be photo
graphed in an ammonia process
called ozalid, Miss Mcintosh ex
plained.
Several copies are made for lower
division women —one each lor the
dean, adviser, and the student her
self. Upper division students' cop
ies are sent to the department, while
the navy students' go to headquar
ters here and the veterans' to the
Veterans Administration.
"It is especially hard when there
is only one week between quarters,"
Miss Mcintosh explained, "for the
cards all must be alphabetized and
grade sheets mailed to students who
have requested them. Although one
person's grades may be printed in
a night, the 14,000 separate grade
sheets which will have to be run
through this quarter take several
nights, she explained.
Similarity of Names
Students' incoming transcripts

are received here too, as well as !
candidates for A.B. degrees.
Two of the biggest headaches of
the office are the similarity of names
of students—there are two men and '
two women with exactly the same i
names — and students who don't
write plainly on their study lists, i
"Deciphering 13,000 hieroglyphics
or guessing at courses and numbers
that don't coincide isn't easy," she j
smiled.
Between 50 and 00 signed tran- I
scripts are sent out each day to
students who request them for new ;
schools, jobs, or personal use. Que- i
ries from companies and university !
organizations are constantly com
ing ui. "However," she stressed, j
"we do not show any person's tran- i
script without his consent."
Record Cards Kept
Several other workers assist Miss j
Mcintosh and Mrs. Wood with tak
ing care of Stanford transcripts, i
filling in the credits and data on
new incoming students, and copy
ing.
In the front office of the Ad !
Building there are files brimfull of j
record cards of every student who
ever attended Stanford, and there
are many more filed downstairs.
"'We never throw anything away'
is our motto," Miss Mcintosh said.

here that grades are posted and
filed in a series of alphabetiezd
processes.
Recorder is Miss Florine Mcin
tosh and her assistant is Mrs. Dor
othy Wood. Their work starts at
the beginning of the quarter, when
the "leg" books are brought in and
study list subjects are copied on
white office cards.
Ozalid Process
After professors' end-quarter re
ports come in, grades are copied
from white cards to "blues" (trans
parent blue paper) to be photo
graphed in an ammonia process
called ozalid, Miss Mcintosh ex
plained.
Several copies are made for lower
division women —one each lor the
dean, adviser, and the student her
self. Upper division students' cop
ies are sent to the department, while
the navy students' go to headquar
ters here and the veterans' to the
Veterans Administration.
"It is especially hard when there
is only one week between quarters,"
Miss Mcintosh explained, "for the
cards all must be alphabetized and
grade sheets mailed to students who
have requested them. Although one
person's grades may be printed in
a night, the 14,000 separate grade
sheets which will have to be run
through this quarter take several
nights, she explained.
Similarity of Names
Students' incoming transcripts

are received here too, as well as !
candidates for A.B. degrees.
Two of the biggest headaches of
the office are the similarity of names
of students—there are two men and '
two women with exactly the same i
names — and students who don't
write plainly on their study lists, i
"Deciphering 13,000 hieroglyphics
or guessing at courses and numbers
that don't coincide isn't easy," she j
smiled.
Between 50 and 00 signed tran- I
scripts are sent out each day to
students who request them for new ;
schools, jobs, or personal use. Que- i
ries from companies and university !
organizations are constantly com
ing ui. "However," she stressed, j
"we do not show any person's tran- i
script without his consent."
Record Cards Kept
Several other workers assist Miss j
Mcintosh and Mrs. Wood with tak
ing care of Stanford transcripts, i
filling in the credits and data on
new incoming students, and copy
ing.
In the front office of the Ad !
Building there are files brimfull of j
record cards of every student who
ever attended Stanford, and there
are many more filed downstairs.
"'We never throw anything away'
is our motto," Miss Mcintosh said.

ministration Building is a small
group of workers who take care of
a vital issue for every Stanford
