# 'Magic Flute' Set to Run Next Week
## 
### 
'The Magic Flute," to be pre
sented March 7, 8, and 9 in the
Memorial Auditorium, was written
in Vienna in 1791 and is Mozart's
last stage work. The libretto has
generally been considered one of
the most absurd specimens of oper
atic literature.
Emanuel Schikaneder, Viennese
impressario and comedian, with the
help of one of his chorus singers,
Carl Ludwig Gieside, succeeded in
throwing together various romantic
motives that would respond to the
demands of the popular theater of
the day. There were to be scenic
effects of a startling kind, with
plenty of colored fire, processions,
and other spectacular exhibitions of
the theater machinery.
Mozart was impeded by never
having seen the libretto in its en
tirety. He was forced to set it in
disconnected episodes. In the midst
of its composition the authors, for
some unknown reason, decided to
change the wicked magician to a
good priest and the fairy to an evil
queen.
The characters have an allegorical
significance to portray the ideals of
Freemasonry: Sai*astro was the
glorification of a prominent Aus
trian Freemason, Ignaz von Born;
Tamino stood for the good Emperor
Joseph 11, who rescued Pamina (the
Austrian people) from the evil in
fluences of the Queen of the Night
(Empress Maria). Through such
Masonic symbolism it was .safe to
express treasonable sentiments.
For Mozart the diverse elements
provided him with inspiration for
such variety. Symbolism, farce
comedy, nobility, hatred, and love
all follow on the stage.
