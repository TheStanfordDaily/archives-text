# Northern Hoop Play Ends This Weekend
## 
### PHIL STEINMETZ 
With Oregon State College and
the University of Idaho tied for the
top spot, the Northern Division
teams play their last two games of
the season tomorrow night. The
Beavers entertain Oregon at Cor
vallis, and Idaho meets Washington
State on the Vandals' home court.
It both leaders conic out vic
torious. the two teams will he
forced to play off the tie next
weekend in a two out of three
scries. This would tnove the Coast
championship series at Berkeley
back to March 15 and Hi, which

incidcntly is during dead week
here.
The Beaver-Webfoot game will
probably find Oregon a slight un
derdog, because they have just re
turned from the tiresome Inland
Empire trip. Oregon, however,
would like nothing better than to
knock their ancient rivals out of the
title and even up the Civil War
series.
At Moscow the Vandals will be no
better than even money to beat the
Cougars. If Gale Bishop were able
to play, WSC would undoubtedly be
the favorite. The great Cougar for
ward has signed a professional base
ball contract, and will leave imme
diately for the training camp of the
Boston Braves. This will be a great
boost to the Vandals.' who have al
ready defeated the Cougars three
times this year.
In four games against Oregon
recently, Bishop poured 10!) points
through the net for an average of
over 27 points per game! These
were enough to put him in the in
dividual scoring leadership with
185 points, one more than the
Beaver's Bed Kocha, despite the
fact that he missed his team's first
five games.
Strange as it may seem, the North
ern Division champ this year might
not be the best college team in the
Northwest. The University of Mon
tana, a team that was kicked out of
the Conference several years ago be
cause of their consistently weak
teams, have held their own in four
games with Idaho this vear and have
a very impressive record. Also, the
University of British Columbia holds
wins over three division teams, and
has cleaned up in their own North
west Conference. This is the first
year of major basketball for the
Thunderbirds.

Boston Braves. This will be a great
boost to the Vandals.' who have al
ready defeated the Cougars three
times this year.
In four games against Oregon
recently, Bishop poured 10!) points
through the net for an average of
over 27 points per game! These
were enough to put him in the in
dividual scoring leadership with
185 points, one more than the
Beaver's Bed Kocha, despite the
fact that he missed his team's first
five games.
Strange as it may seem, the North
ern Division champ this year might
not be the best college team in the
Northwest. The University of Mon
tana, a team that was kicked out of
the Conference several years ago be
cause of their consistently weak
teams, have held their own in four
games with Idaho this vear and have
a very impressive record. Also, the
University of British Columbia holds
wins over three division teams, and
has cleaned up in their own North
west Conference. This is the first
year of major basketball for the
Thunderbirds.
