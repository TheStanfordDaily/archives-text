# Firewater Five Now 'Peninsula Ramblers'
## 
### 
The Firewater Five, all seven
of (hem, announce that they have
outgrown their name. They will
henceforth he known as the Pe
ninsula Ramhlers.
The Dixieland hand, which be
gan as Frank Goulctte and his
Firewat'er Five, began to grow
shortly after its formation. Natu
rally, there wasn't enough lire
water to go around.
At the junior rally, the Five
sat in two chairs and played very,
very softly. Even the juniors
could count them, and they didn't
add up to live.
So if you hear a hand stomping
it out with two-beat jazz, it's the
Peninsula Ramblers, Goulcttc an
nounces.
