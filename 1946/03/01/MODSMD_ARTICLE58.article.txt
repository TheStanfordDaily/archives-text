# Artist Needs Specialization, Says Farmer

### 
Art as a career is just as spe- ;
cialized as medicine or any other
profession, Edward M. Farmer, as
sociate professor of graphic art, re- i
minded art enthusiasts last night at j
the Vocom lecture.
"It's discouraging to go through
a university like Stanford, taking
the required 65 units of art to
receive an art degree," he said,
and then find that you're not pre
pared to specialize in any branch
of the field." At least a year, two
years, or even three years at an
art school arc essential after |
graduation from college, accord
ing to Mr. Farmer.
When questioned as to the ap- j
proximate length of time needed to
become a fairly successful portrait
painter, Mr. Farmer outlined what
might be called "a typical 10-year
road to success." Before he began j
his outline, he warned, "Don't be
discouraged by the 10-year part of
the proposition. That's approxi- j
mately the length of time from col- i
lege entrance that it takes a medi- j
cal or any other professional man
to establish any sort of a practice at |
all."
The first step in Mr. Farmer's j
sample case is finishing a four
year art course in a regular uni
versity. "During this time," he
pointed out, "you should be mak
ing mostly A's and B's in your
art courses and have a true pas
sion for painting."
Mr. Farmer stated that the av-»
eragc portrait artist will prob
ably start out by selling his first
works at near $50. "It's hard to
say what he'll earn from then on,"
he continued, "though I might es
timate that a fairly good portrait
artist's fees will increase approx
imately $100 a year."

Helen Green Cross of the Stanford
Museum, who emphasized oppor
tunities for women in professional
