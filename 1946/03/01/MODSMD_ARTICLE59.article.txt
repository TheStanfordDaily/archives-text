# Men's Housing Acute; Waiting List Formed
## 
### 
Despite the opening of another
men's hall and the using of all
available space in present halls, the
men's housing shortage on campus
has become so acute as to necessi
tate the forming of a waiting list of
returning Stanford veterans who
need rooms, according to Stanley L. j
Sharp. Director of Men's Rcsiden.ce. ;
Applications for rooms have
exceeded the vacancies which are
expected next quarter and the
waiting list, which at present in- i
eludes approximately 50 names, j
is growing on an average of seven
names a day. Most of the men
on the waiting list are former
Stanford students returning from
the services.
The Redwoods, former Sigma Chi
house, is being taken over for men j
next quarter and will be renamed j
Garfield.
Negotiations arc in progress to
obtain housing units at Tanforan
and Dibble, according to Dean
John IVI. Stalnaker, but no definite
information is possible due to the
uncertainty of government plans. [
If the units at Tanforan are re
leased, it is possible that they can j
be used for next quarter. Dibble, ;
however, will not be released by the !
army until July and would not be j
available until fall quarter.
