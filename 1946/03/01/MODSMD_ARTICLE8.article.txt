# Spring Ratio Tendency For Women's Housing
## 
### 
Housing Committee yesterday
decided Co establish a tendency
toward a ratio system in the liv
ing groups for next ouarter in
proportion to the number of peo
ple in each class drawing for resi
dence changes.
Any woman student with a pri
ority—sponsors returning to their
former living group and former
sorority members coming back to
their old house—will be placed
first. Then the ratio system will
operate.
The committee decided to have
the housing poll ready for distri
bution at the beginning of next
quarter.
