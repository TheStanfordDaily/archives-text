# Terman to Give Lecture On Electronic Warfare
## F.E. TERMAN 
### 
Dr. F. E. Tcrman, dean of the
School of Engineering, will speak
on "Electronic Warfare" Wednes
day, March G, at 7:30 p.m. in the
Cubberley Auditorium.
Dr. Tcrman will discuss one
phase of the scientific activity that
occurred in the research laborato
ries of this country during the war
years. The specific activity that Dr.
Tcrman organized and directed was
the Radio Research Laboratory at
Harvard University, which pro
duced practically all of the radar
countermeasures used by our
armed forces.
Itadar Laboratory
The purpose of this particular
laboratory was to devise measures
and means to nullify enemy radar.
Some of the results of the efforts
were a 75 per cent reduction in the
effectiveness of German anti-air
craft fire, confusion of the Germans
on D-Day by radar countermeas
ures which feinted much of their
strength out of position, and com
pulsion of the Germans and Japs to
discontinue using their radar in
the latter stages of the war so as
not to disclose their own positions.
The two general types of coun
termeasures developed by Terman
and his staff were aluminum foil
strips of "tuned" lengths and elec
tronic detectors and jammers.
Illustrated Talk
Dr. Terman will illustrate his talk
with slides and a sound film "Ra
dar Countermeasures," which was
produced during the war for the
purpose of explaining countormoas
ure developments to high staff offi
cers in the armed forces.
Dr. Terman is being presented by
the Stanford Branch of the Ameri
can Institute of' Electrical Engi
neers. All engineering faculty and
students arc invited to attend.


. . . will discuss electronic war
fare Wednesday.
