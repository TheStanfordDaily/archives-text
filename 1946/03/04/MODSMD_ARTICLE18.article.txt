# 'Flute' Score â€”It's Tough
## 
### 
The most difficult orchestration j
ever played by the Stanford orches- j
j tra will be included in Mozart's op- i
j era, "The Magic Flute" to be pre- !
j sented on March 7, 8 and 9, accord- j
! ing to Herbert Jan Popper, musical J
j director of the production.
It is a known fact that Mozart's
I music looks easy, sounds easy, and
I yet is very difficult to play. The
difficulty lies in the fact that all
j the little signs and phrases have
to be very definitely observed.
The teamwork has to be carried
on to (he utmost for the score is
j very transparent, little brass being
used.
The brunt of the entire orchestra
| lion lies with the string section. The '
violinists include Elizabeth Kincade !
(concert mistress), Marion Arnold,
Anita Barrett, Barbara Bjornstrom, |
Elwyn Bugge, Sarni Cameron, Ruth
j Gumbrecht, Helen Hallawcll, Nor
| man MeKown, Fred Sleator, Eliza
i both Smith, and Joyce Slallfort.
.
The entire orchestra is coin
] posed of the finest players avail
able. Among them are included
the following students, oIT-campus
j musicians, and faculty members:
Violas: Jessie Applegarth, Edith
Roller, Lew Lewis, Leonard Olson,
j Cellos: Charles I'risbic, Virginia
I Slavich. Rass: Alice Lunden.
Flutes: Esther Marozik, Helen
j Bryner. Oboes: Beth Childs, Anna
Larson. Clarinets: Helen M. Bct
j tini, Joanne Hunnicut. Bassoons:
Barbara Welch, Eldren Garni.
French horn: William Bubkc. Trum
; pets: Harold Riddle, Denver R.
GrofT. Trombones: Donald Gault,
| Howard Martin, Douglas Crary.
jlimpani, Marty Rasor.
The hell arias as played off-stage
by Mozart himself in the Viennese
productions will be played by
Peggy Bradford, on the clocken
spiel. Mrs. Bailer, who plays the
viola, is the wife of Albert Bailer,
concert accompanist to Yehudi
Mcnhuin.
Dr. Popper particularly wishes to
commend Elwyn Bugge. assistant
professor of physical education, and
leader of the second violins, and Mrs.
Marozik. Mr. Bugge has played with
the orchestra in every nuisic produc
| tion since the "Bartered BridtJ" in
1939. Mrs. Marozik comes in every
I rehearsal from Redwood City. She
plays the flute aria solo in thq first
finale, and according to Dr. Popper
I is excellent.
The good will of the audience
is asked by the directors in watch
ing the "Magic Flute," for they
should realize that while it is a
comic opera it also has its serious
religious aspects. Mozart is re
membered as saying "I have writ
ten a magic opera, and if we make
a fiasco I cannot help it."

The hell arias as played off-stage
by Mozart himself in the Viennese
productions will be played by
Peggy Bradford, on the clocken
spiel. Mrs. Bailer, who plays the
viola, is the wife of Albert Bailer,
concert accompanist to Yehudi
Mcnhuin.
Dr. Popper particularly wishes to
commend Elwyn Bugge. assistant
professor of physical education, and
leader of the second violins, and Mrs.
Marozik. Mr. Bugge has played with
the orchestra in every nuisic produc
| tion since the "Bartered BridtJ" in
1939. Mrs. Marozik comes in every
I rehearsal from Redwood City. She
plays the flute aria solo in thq first
finale, and according to Dr. Popper
I is excellent.
The good will of the audience
is asked by the directors in watch
ing the "Magic Flute," for they
should realize that while it is a
comic opera it also has its serious
religious aspects. Mozart is re
membered as saying "I have writ
ten a magic opera, and if we make
a fiasco I cannot help it."
The most difficult orchestration j
ever played by the Stanford orches- j
j tra will be included in Mozart's op- i
j era, "The Magic Flute" to be pre- !
j sented on March 7, 8 and 9, accord- j
! ing to Herbert Jan Popper, musical J
j director of the production.
It is a known fact that Mozart's
I music looks easy, sounds easy, and
I yet is very difficult to play. The
difficulty lies in the fact that all
j the little signs and phrases have
to be very definitely observed.
The teamwork has to be carried
on to (he utmost for the score is
j very transparent, little brass being
used.
The brunt of the entire orchestra
| lion lies with the string section. The '
violinists include Elizabeth Kincade !
(concert mistress), Marion Arnold,
Anita Barrett, Barbara Bjornstrom, |
Elwyn Bugge, Sarni Cameron, Ruth
j Gumbrecht, Helen Hallawcll, Nor
| man MeKown, Fred Sleator, Eliza
i both Smith, and Joyce Slallfort.
