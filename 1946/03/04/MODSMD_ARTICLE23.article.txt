# The 						Aftermath of Indecision
## 
### 
In about the most clear-cut and specific
statement that has been made by the United
States in recent weeks, the State Department
announced Friday that it had warned Russia
some time ago against taking Japanese in
dustrial equipment from Manchuria, and had
received no answer.
j-at even' at the time that the announce
ment was made, and while Secretary of State
Byrnes was saying in a dinner address that
"we must make it plain that the United States
intends to defend the United Nations char
ter," a certain deadline came and passed
with heavy finality. That deadline was
March 1, the date when the Big Three had
agreed that all foreign troops would be with
drawn from Iran. The United States has al

ready taken out her troops; the British were
to be on their way out Saturday.
From Russia came a declaration that her
troops would begin a partial withdrawal, but
that they would be kept in "disturbed areas"
until the "clearance of the situation."
This means that at just about the time when
we are beginning to back up some of our
agreements, we are faced with one more dip
lomatic I-dare-you move and another deci
sion to make as to whether we will protest or
accept this latest development.
Perhaps we will recognize now some of
the indirect and dangerous results of UNO's
policy of tabling, referring back to the parties
involved, or merely making an official "note"
of the disputes which are actually key pieces
in the puzzle of maintaining world peace.
