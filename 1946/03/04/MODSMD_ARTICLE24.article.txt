# Let's Hash It Over...
## 
### 
V/e were greatly grieved the other day.
We heard confirmation again of the report
that rules regarding the hashers in some of
the women's residences on the Row were
strict enough to be breaking down that grand
old institution, the hasher's spirit!
One of the attributes of living in a small
house always seemed to us to be the in
formal friendships stirred up between the
hashing crew and the women whose soup
'n salad they served. Brother hasher had a
' c cial role on campus, not only as the owner

of a long, white-clad arm attached to a tray
ful of food, but as the guy who showed the
women what the other half of the Stanford
population was doing and thinking.
So we're grieved to think that a favorite
though unpublicized Stanford way of life
may be having a rough time of it. Perhaps
if house mothers, house presidents, and head
hashers got together and talked it over (you
can use this editorial for an excuse) the sit
uation could be clarified and the harassed
hasher would be a thing of the past.
