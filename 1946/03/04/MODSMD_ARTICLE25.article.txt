To the Editor:
We are getting frantic. It's about these
Russians. They are getting out of hand.
Right after the war is over, they increase all
the dirty, unscrupulous, and stupid remarks
in their newspapers about us. This is bad.
Why are they doing it?
Mr. Epsteen says they are increasing their
armed forces. We are willing to bet that
those unscrupulous, STINKING GANG
STERS are conscripting new soldiers into
their army right now, even though it is sup
posed to be peace time now. We don't un
derstand this! What is it all about? This
proves by the facts that they must be getting
ready to come over here next year and wipe
us out. This is alarming!
Oar good friend and advisor, Mr. Epsteeii,
also says that those stinkers want to make
their country powerful. Why should those
STUPID GANGSTERS want to do this? AND,
to do it, our friend and advisor says those
king ROTTEN GANGSTERS are push
ing around little weak countries or nationali
ties against their will. This is making a rot
ter, stinking joke out of why we cleaned
government latrines foi 4.825 years. Only
stupid, unscrupulous RUTHLESS GANG
STERS would do a rotten thing like imposing
themselves on weak little groups of people
like the Iranians. That is what they call
those people, isn't it?
Yesterday in the Sunday newspapers, Mr.
Hearst told us something. And he is another
big man in this country who knows an <:iwful
let. One of his writers said that those ruth
less, stupid, UNSCRUPULOUS GANGSTERS
are using Japs for their army. Our friend

(that's the one who owns all the papers)
figures, we figure, that this just shows one
thing by the facts. Those rotten CORRUPTED
GANGSTERS are just like the stinking, rot
ten fascists, because they use Jap soldiers.
This in turn proves by the facts that they
are a stinking, rotten country of gangsters.
We think it's just about time to do something
about these stinking, rotten gangsters.
Our good friend and advisor (the one who
doesn't own all papers) seemed to say the
other day that the Canadian trouble shows
that things are getting more rotten and more
gangsterish all the time. This is bad!
We will even bet (even odds) that sooner
or later those stinking, unscrupulous DEM
AGOGUE GANGSTERS will find how to
make the atom bomb and then start storing
them all over, in caves and everywhere else.
This v/ill prove by the facts that those stink
ing, MAD, DRUNKEN GANGSTERS are get
ting ready to wipe us out. Because why else
would they do such a rotten, stinking thing?
We were awfully confused about the world
until we got put straight by our two good
trusted advisors (the one who owns the pa
pers and the one who doesn't own the pa
pers). We now know by the facts that we
have got to wipe those stinking, rotten SA
DISTIC GANGSTERS off the face of the map
to keep the way of life we fought for. We
want our two good trusted friends to go to
Washington FAST and get the other BIG
men in this country to do this immediately,
or it will bo too late.

like the Iranians. That is what they call
those people, isn't it?
Yesterday in the Sunday newspapers, Mr.
Hearst told us something. And he is another
big man in this country who knows an <:iwful
let. One of his writers said that those ruth
less, stupid, UNSCRUPULOUS GANGSTERS
are using Japs for their army. Our friend

(that's the one who owns all the papers)
figures, we figure, that this just shows one
thing by the facts. Those rotten CORRUPTED
GANGSTERS are just like the stinking, rot
ten fascists, because they use Jap soldiers.
This in turn proves by the facts that they
are a stinking, rotten country of gangsters.
We think it's just about time to do something
about these stinking, rotten gangsters.
Our good friend and advisor (the one who
doesn't own all papers) seemed to say the
other day that the Canadian trouble shows
that things are getting more rotten and more
gangsterish all the time. This is bad!
We will even bet (even odds) that sooner
or later those stinking, unscrupulous DEM
AGOGUE GANGSTERS will find how to
make the atom bomb and then start storing
them all over, in caves and everywhere else.
This v/ill prove by the facts that those stink
ing, MAD, DRUNKEN GANGSTERS are get
ting ready to wipe us out. Because why else
would they do such a rotten, stinking thing?
We were awfully confused about the world
until we got put straight by our two good
trusted advisors (the one who owns the pa
pers and the one who doesn't own the pa
pers). We now know by the facts that we
have got to wipe those stinking, rotten SA
DISTIC GANGSTERS off the face of the map
to keep the way of life we fought for. We
want our two good trusted friends to go to
Washington FAST and get the other BIG
men in this country to do this immediately,
or it will bo too late.

To the Editor:
We are getting frantic. It's about these
Russians. They are getting out of hand.
Right after the war is over, they increase all
the dirty, unscrupulous, and stupid remarks
in their newspapers about us. This is bad.
Why are they doing it?
Mr. Epsteen says they are increasing their
armed forces. We are willing to bet that
those unscrupulous, STINKING GANG
STERS are conscripting new soldiers into
their army right now, even though it is sup
posed to be peace time now. We don't un
derstand this! What is it all about? This
proves by the facts that they must be getting
ready to come over here next year and wipe
us out. This is alarming!
Oar good friend and advisor, Mr. Epsteeii,
also says that those stinkers want to make
their country powerful. Why should those
STUPID GANGSTERS want to do this? AND,
to do it, our friend and advisor says those
king ROTTEN GANGSTERS are push
ing around little weak countries or nationali
ties against their will. This is making a rot
ter, stinking joke out of why we cleaned
government latrines foi 4.825 years. Only
stupid, unscrupulous RUTHLESS GANG
STERS would do a rotten thing like imposing
themselves on weak little groups of people
like the Iranians. That is what they call
those people, isn't it?
