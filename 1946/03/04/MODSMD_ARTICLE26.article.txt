### H.D. THOREAU 
From Five Points in Redwood City to tho
north limits of Leland Stanford, along U.S.
Highway 101, "El Camino Real," there are
by actual count 21 libation lounges, exclud
ing real estate offices that sell beer.
One would think that this would be some
kind of a record, but no. State records show
that there is one stretch of highway even
more thickly populated with bistros.
It is a desolate piece of road from the
south bounds of Leland Stanford to Moun
tain View. We sent a field worker out Friday
afternoon to take a count. As yet he has not
returned, which in itself should testify to the
density of the region. When he comes in,
however, we will extract the figure from
him and print it in another Daily exclusive.
Although this concentration of activities
might be just a coincidence or a product of

the fine climate in Redwood City, our opinion
is that in some small way we here at Leland
Stanford might have had something to do
with this remarkable growth.
It makes us feel proud to know that we
attend an institution which is the focal point
of culture in the region.
A lady on Emerson street reports having
seen a troll in the Palo Alto underpass last
Tuesday night. The description she gave
authorities put the troll at around 3 feet 7
inches, with sandy mane, laughing eyes,
and an Ingersoll watch.
To the couple playing hop-scotch in front
of the Library last week:
They don't mind you using their court, but
they ask that you refrain from using books
from the R.B.R. for lagging purposes.
