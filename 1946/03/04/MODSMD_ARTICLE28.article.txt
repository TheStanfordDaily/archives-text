# Housing Segregation Means Better Race Relations--Stegner
## 
### MARY VIRGINIA POND 
Speaking before Stanford stu
dents last Thursday afternoon. Mr.
Wallace Stegner, well-known au
thority on race relations in the
United States and acting professor
of at Stanford, stated that
racial discrimination in the United
States can he improved if housing
segregation is eliminated in Amer
ican cities.
Housing Is Main Problem
Mr. Stegner asserted the hous
ing problem is more of a problem
because of racial discrimination
rather than getting jobs. Once the
housing situation is taken care of,
social and educational conditions
can be eased, he said.
Mr. Stegner pointed out that once
;t Negro family, for example, moves
into a "white" residential district and
some of the former residents leave,
the real ''state offices "can put the
pinch on" and resell the homes at
higher prices to other Negro (ami
lies.
Higher Prices to Negroes
The real estate offices can sell to
the Ne'gro for a higher price than
they can sell to the white,.and what
applies to the Negro applies to other
minorities.
The New York residential dis
trict of Westchester County Park
way Gardens was cited by Mr.
Stegner as an example of what
happens when a Negro family pur
chases property in a "white" dis
trict.
Parkway Gardens as Example
Parkway Gardens was an upper
middle class suburban hillside com
munity. When a Negro family moved
in, the angry citizens at first threat
ened the newcomers, and eventually
six families of whites moved out pf
Ihe district.
The homes left vacant were resold
at higher prices to other Negroes, and
a few years ago the ratio of black
and white in the community was
about 50-50. Mr. Stegner stated.
No Discrimination
In interviewing the white resi

dents, Mr. Stegner said that no one
objected to the Negroes as a race.
The residents, both black and
white, drove each other downtown
to work, exchanged pickle recipes,
and talked over the fence as in any
! average neighborhood.
"Parkway Gardens is probably the
! only community of its kind," Mr.
Stegner declared. "All it takes is an
accidental stoppage of fear to pre
vent the first step toward discrimi
! nation —segregation."
t Newspaper Publicity Good
Mr. Stegner also mentioned there-
I cent case of the Negro doctor who
! moved into the Berkeley Claremont
! district. He added that the publicity
j being given the case by such papers
as the San Francisco Chronicle and
I the San Francisco News was a hope
ful sign. "A few years ago there
j would have been no publicity, no
protests," he said.
"The final test," Mr. Stegner
stated, "is 'What if it happens to
j me?' Many people don't want to
J face that test. All we need is the
attitude that we don't care what
color our neighbors are as long as
they are decent people."
Break Down Slums
"The whole thing comes down to
! guaranteeing people places to live, to
i breaking down the slums —usually
racial slums—to taking the roof off
: the 'black belts' in cities."
When you look behind the closed
| doors in San Francisco's Chinatown,
| Mr. Stegner pointed out, you see 25,-
000 people liivng in an area of a few
j blocks. The tuberculosis rate and
| the death rate are several times as
high as in any other part of the city.
Opportunities Better in North
Army tests showed that oppor
tunities for Negroes in the North
are better than in the South, Mr.
Stegner slated. When restrictions
arc taken oil', the opportunities to
rise in intelligence, society, and ed
ucational standards follow inevi-
I tahly.
"Society is like a geyser," Mr.
! Stegner added. "Its members will
I rise unless a lid is clamped on. In

that case an explosion will follow j
eventually if enough heat and pres
sure are applied from below."
Job Security Needed
In regard to the employment prob- I
lem, Mr. Stegner asserted that bills i
like the FEPC should be passed on a
slate as well as on a national scale.
"Those who swing the mops and
brooms have the lowest wages and
the least protection," he said. The
FEPC. on the other hand, prevents
discrimination in hiring and firing,
gives security and a chance to rise in
.society.
Solutions for the future which
will aid in abolishing tliscrimina- !
tion among racial minorities of all j
types, as named by Mr. Stegner, |
lie among the work of liberal j
groups in the Southern states, j
among the Negroes themselves, I
and in the healing of the political
breach between the North and the
South.
Solution Gradual Process
Eventual solution is a slop-by-step
process. Educational improvements
in the South, the dropping of the
poll tax in several states, and an ex
pected Supreme Court ruling making
restrictive covenants illegal are
hopeful indications.
"Prejudice is quite frequently ac
tivated and stirred up as was the case
with the Japanese-Americans in Cal
ifornia," Mr. Stegner pointed out.
"It often is profitable big business."
"The eventual solution is to
make prejudice and discrimination
unfashionable," Mr. Stegner de
clared. "When we pass through j
this stage of gaining prestige and
distinction by riding on someone
else's shoulders, discrimination can
be ended."

breach between the North and the
South.
Solution Gradual Process
Eventual solution is a slop-by-step
process. Educational improvements
in the South, the dropping of the
poll tax in several states, and an ex
pected Supreme Court ruling making
restrictive covenants illegal are
hopeful indications.
"Prejudice is quite frequently ac
tivated and stirred up as was the case
with the Japanese-Americans in Cal
ifornia," Mr. Stegner pointed out.
"It often is profitable big business."
"The eventual solution is to
make prejudice and discrimination
unfashionable," Mr. Stegner de
clared. "When we pass through j
this stage of gaining prestige and
distinction by riding on someone
else's shoulders, discrimination can
be ended."
Speaking before Stanford stu
dents last Thursday afternoon. Mr.
Wallace Stegner, well-known au
thority on race relations in the
United States and acting professor
of at Stanford, stated that
racial discrimination in the United
States can he improved if housing
segregation is eliminated in Amer
ican cities.
Housing Is Main Problem
Mr. Stegner asserted the hous
ing problem is more of a problem
because of racial discrimination
rather than getting jobs. Once the
housing situation is taken care of,
social and educational conditions
can be eased, he said.
Mr. Stegner pointed out that once
;t Negro family, for example, moves
into a "white" residential district and
some of the former residents leave,
the real ''state offices "can put the
pinch on" and resell the homes at
higher prices to other Negro (ami
lies.
Higher Prices to Negroes
The real estate offices can sell to
the Ne'gro for a higher price than
they can sell to the white,.and what
applies to the Negro applies to other
minorities.
The New York residential dis
trict of Westchester County Park
way Gardens was cited by Mr.
Stegner as an example of what
happens when a Negro family pur
chases property in a "white" dis
trict.
Parkway Gardens as Example
Parkway Gardens was an upper
middle class suburban hillside com
munity. When a Negro family moved
in, the angry citizens at first threat
ened the newcomers, and eventually
six families of whites moved out pf
Ihe district.
The homes left vacant were resold
at higher prices to other Negroes, and
a few years ago the ratio of black
and white in the community was
about 50-50. Mr. Stegner stated.
No Discrimination
In interviewing the white resi

dents, Mr. Stegner said that no one
objected to the Negroes as a race.
The residents, both black and
white, drove each other downtown
to work, exchanged pickle recipes,
and talked over the fence as in any
! average neighborhood.
"Parkway Gardens is probably the
! only community of its kind," Mr.
Stegner declared. "All it takes is an
accidental stoppage of fear to pre
vent the first step toward discrimi
! nation —segregation."
t Newspaper Publicity Good
Mr. Stegner also mentioned there-
I cent case of the Negro doctor who
! moved into the Berkeley Claremont
! district. He added that the publicity
j being given the case by such papers
as the San Francisco Chronicle and
I the San Francisco News was a hope
ful sign. "A few years ago there
j would have been no publicity, no
protests," he said.
"The final test," Mr. Stegner
stated, "is 'What if it happens to
j me?' Many people don't want to
J face that test. All we need is the
attitude that we don't care what
color our neighbors are as long as
they are decent people."
Break Down Slums
"The whole thing comes down to
! guaranteeing people places to live, to
i breaking down the slums —usually
racial slums—to taking the roof off
: the 'black belts' in cities."
When you look behind the closed
| doors in San Francisco's Chinatown,
| Mr. Stegner pointed out, you see 25,-
000 people liivng in an area of a few
j blocks. The tuberculosis rate and
| the death rate are several times as
high as in any other part of the city.
Opportunities Better in North
Army tests showed that oppor
tunities for Negroes in the North
are better than in the South, Mr.
Stegner slated. When restrictions
arc taken oil', the opportunities to
rise in intelligence, society, and ed
ucational standards follow inevi-
I tahly.
"Society is like a geyser," Mr.
! Stegner added. "Its members will
I rise unless a lid is clamped on. In

that case an explosion will follow j
eventually if enough heat and pres
sure are applied from below."
Job Security Needed
In regard to the employment prob- I
lem, Mr. Stegner asserted that bills i
like the FEPC should be passed on a
slate as well as on a national scale.
"Those who swing the mops and
brooms have the lowest wages and
the least protection," he said. The
FEPC. on the other hand, prevents
discrimination in hiring and firing,
gives security and a chance to rise in
.society.
Solutions for the future which
will aid in abolishing tliscrimina- !
tion among racial minorities of all j
types, as named by Mr. Stegner, |
lie among the work of liberal j
groups in the Southern states, j
among the Negroes themselves, I
and in the healing of the political
breach between the North and the
South.

Job Security Needed
In regard to the employment prob- I
lem, Mr. Stegner asserted that bills i
like the FEPC should be passed on a
slate as well as on a national scale.
"Those who swing the mops and
brooms have the lowest wages and
the least protection," he said. The
FEPC. on the other hand, prevents
discrimination in hiring and firing,
gives security and a chance to rise in
.society.
Solutions for the future which
will aid in abolishing tliscrimina- !
tion among racial minorities of all j
types, as named by Mr. Stegner, |
lie among the work of liberal j
groups in the Southern states, j
among the Negroes themselves, I
and in the healing of the political
breach between the North and the
South.
Solution Gradual Process
Eventual solution is a slop-by-step
process. Educational improvements
in the South, the dropping of the
poll tax in several states, and an ex
pected Supreme Court ruling making
restrictive covenants illegal are
hopeful indications.
"Prejudice is quite frequently ac
tivated and stirred up as was the case
with the Japanese-Americans in Cal
ifornia," Mr. Stegner pointed out.
"It often is profitable big business."
"The eventual solution is to
make prejudice and discrimination
unfashionable," Mr. Stegner de
clared. "When we pass through j
this stage of gaining prestige and
distinction by riding on someone
else's shoulders, discrimination can
be ended."
Speaking before Stanford stu
dents last Thursday afternoon. Mr.
Wallace Stegner, well-known au
thority on race relations in the
United States and acting professor
of at Stanford, stated that
racial discrimination in the United
States can he improved if housing
segregation is eliminated in Amer
ican cities.
Housing Is Main Problem
Mr. Stegner asserted the hous
ing problem is more of a problem
because of racial discrimination
rather than getting jobs. Once the
housing situation is taken care of,
social and educational conditions
can be eased, he said.
Mr. Stegner pointed out that once
;t Negro family, for example, moves
into a "white" residential district and
some of the former residents leave,
the real ''state offices "can put the
pinch on" and resell the homes at
higher prices to other Negro (ami
lies.
Higher Prices to Negroes
The real estate offices can sell to
the Ne'gro for a higher price than
they can sell to the white,.and what
applies to the Negro applies to other
minorities.
The New York residential dis
trict of Westchester County Park
way Gardens was cited by Mr.
Stegner as an example of what
happens when a Negro family pur
chases property in a "white" dis
trict.
Parkway Gardens as Example
Parkway Gardens was an upper
middle class suburban hillside com
munity. When a Negro family moved
in, the angry citizens at first threat
ened the newcomers, and eventually
six families of whites moved out pf
Ihe district.
The homes left vacant were resold
at higher prices to other Negroes, and
a few years ago the ratio of black
and white in the community was
about 50-50. Mr. Stegner stated.
No Discrimination
In interviewing the white resi

dents, Mr. Stegner said that no one
objected to the Negroes as a race.
The residents, both black and
white, drove each other downtown
to work, exchanged pickle recipes,
and talked over the fence as in any
! average neighborhood.
"Parkway Gardens is probably the
! only community of its kind," Mr.
Stegner declared. "All it takes is an
accidental stoppage of fear to pre
vent the first step toward discrimi
! nation —segregation."
t Newspaper Publicity Good
Mr. Stegner also mentioned there-
I cent case of the Negro doctor who
! moved into the Berkeley Claremont
! district. He added that the publicity
j being given the case by such papers
as the San Francisco Chronicle and
I the San Francisco News was a hope
ful sign. "A few years ago there
j would have been no publicity, no
protests," he said.
"The final test," Mr. Stegner
stated, "is 'What if it happens to
j me?' Many people don't want to
J face that test. All we need is the
attitude that we don't care what
color our neighbors are as long as
they are decent people."
Break Down Slums
"The whole thing comes down to
! guaranteeing people places to live, to
i breaking down the slums —usually
racial slums—to taking the roof off
: the 'black belts' in cities."
When you look behind the closed
| doors in San Francisco's Chinatown,
| Mr. Stegner pointed out, you see 25,-
000 people liivng in an area of a few
j blocks. The tuberculosis rate and
| the death rate are several times as
high as in any other part of the city.
Opportunities Better in North
Army tests showed that oppor
tunities for Negroes in the North
are better than in the South, Mr.
Stegner slated. When restrictions
arc taken oil', the opportunities to
rise in intelligence, society, and ed
ucational standards follow inevi-
I tahly.
"Society is like a geyser," Mr.
! Stegner added. "Its members will
I rise unless a lid is clamped on. In

that case an explosion will follow j
eventually if enough heat and pres
sure are applied from below."
Job Security Needed
