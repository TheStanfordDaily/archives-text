# Visiting Chinese Flyers Call for US Cooperation

### MARION MORROW 
There's not much difference be
tween the people of the Chinese
nation and those of the United
States, according to six Chinese Air
Force engineers who visited the
campus yesterday and who believe
there would he no dilliculty in the
two nations understanding each
other if propaganda were decreased
and the people could talk to each
other.
The .six officers were: Capt. Huang
Hsueh Chang, Kwangsi; Lt. L-. K.
Wu, Shanghai; Lt. Fan Jinn Shiou,
Shanghai; Lt. C. C. Yang, Canton; Lt.
S. Y. Chan, Canton; and Capt. S. H.
Hu, Shanghai. In Texas for the last
year taking ground crew courses,
they are now waiting in San Fran
cisco to be shipped back home to
serve in the Nationalist army.
Capt. Chang said he had found that
Americans, like the Chinese, appre
ciated humor, enjoyed their families,
and liked sports.
Of enursc, he laughed, one differ
envo is lti.it Americans love beef
steak so much, while the Chinese are
quite fond of fried chicken, and that
the Americans have a Chinese dish

I called "chop suey" which has never
| been heard of in China.
The main surprise in the United
States for him, however, was the
well - developed communication,
' railroad, and industrial systems
which could he found everywhere.
These developments are particular
ly hoped for by China, he stressed.
| since for the last ten years the
I cities and factories have been so
completely destroyed by the cn
' emj.
He said he received a letter from
, his father last week (the first in two
| years) which told him of the com-
J plete destruction of his home town
j in the province of Kwangsi.
The ten-year struggle has natu
| rally made the Chinese tired and an
' gry, but Capt. Chang believes that
j more than anything else they wish
| to have peace, and that if China does
! not have pcace, the whole world will
j not have peace.
Every country has trouble,
speculated Capt. Chang, even the
United States, and China is no ex
ception. Rut certainly Chiang Kai
shek can lead the Chinese to a
unity, peace and secure place in
I the world, he emphasized.

! not have pcace, the whole world will
j not have peace.
Every country has trouble,
speculated Capt. Chang, even the
United States, and China is no ex
ception. Rut certainly Chiang Kai
shek can lead the Chinese to a
unity, peace and secure place in
I the world, he emphasized.
There's not much difference be
tween the people of the Chinese
nation and those of the United
States, according to six Chinese Air
Force engineers who visited the
campus yesterday and who believe
there would he no dilliculty in the
two nations understanding each
other if propaganda were decreased
and the people could talk to each
other.
The .six officers were: Capt. Huang
Hsueh Chang, Kwangsi; Lt. L-. K.
Wu, Shanghai; Lt. Fan Jinn Shiou,
Shanghai; Lt. C. C. Yang, Canton; Lt.
S. Y. Chan, Canton; and Capt. S. H.
Hu, Shanghai. In Texas for the last
year taking ground crew courses,
they are now waiting in San Fran
cisco to be shipped back home to
serve in the Nationalist army.
Capt. Chang said he had found that
Americans, like the Chinese, appre
ciated humor, enjoyed their families,
and liked sports.
Of enursc, he laughed, one differ
envo is lti.it Americans love beef
steak so much, while the Chinese are
quite fond of fried chicken, and that
the Americans have a Chinese dish

I called "chop suey" which has never
| been heard of in China.
The main surprise in the United
States for him, however, was the
well - developed communication,
' railroad, and industrial systems
which could he found everywhere.
These developments are particular
ly hoped for by China, he stressed.
| since for the last ten years the
I cities and factories have been so
completely destroyed by the cn
' emj.
He said he received a letter from
, his father last week (the first in two
| years) which told him of the com-
J plete destruction of his home town
j in the province of Kwangsi.
The ten-year struggle has natu
| rally made the Chinese tired and an
' gry, but Capt. Chang believes that
j more than anything else they wish
| to have peace, and that if China does
! not have pcace, the whole world will
j not have peace.

speculated Capt. Chang, even the
