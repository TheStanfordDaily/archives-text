# Betty Hutton Sings, Dances, Cavorts in Film, 'Stork Club'
## 
### 
"I'm Just a Square in the Social
Circle who threw that fly in my
soup!" -To wit, Betty Button, who
cavorts all over the screen at the
Varsity ihese days in "Stork Club."
indefatigable Miss Hutton covers
more celluloid in the picture than
Abbott and Costello could do to
gether.
I* it/gerald, DeFore Featured
Loosely centered around Sherman
Billingslev's celebrity - filled Stork
Cluh in Gotham, the Paramount mu
sical also features Barry Fitzgerald
unci pudgy Don DeFore. DeFore, last
seen as an Air Corps flier in "You
Came Along," turns up as the Ma
rine who is the object of Miss Hut
ton's cavortings in "Stork Club."
Fitzgerald is seen as an eccentric
millionaire who anonymously gives
away money to a hat-check girl
(Miss Hutton) at the Stork Club.
When the hat-check girl's fiance

(DeFore) gets back from overseas, he
suspects the worst, and complications
arise of a typically Hollywood vari
j ety. In case you're worried, Hutton
1 and DeFore get together before she
| collapses from pure physical strain.
Athletic Singing by Hutton
Miss Hutton knocks herself out on
several songs including Hoagy Car
! Michael's "Doctor, Lawyer, Indian
Chief' and does very nicely by them.
Possibly it's better she wasn't given
more songs to sing, because after ev
| ery one she looks as if she's ready for
a stretch in Hollywood's Good Sa
maritan Hospital.
Also on the Varsity screen is some
more scatterbrained nonsense, "Hold
That Blonde!" starring Hutton's old
movie pal, Eddie Bracken, with Ver
onica Lak'\ It's light down the alley
for you who are slap-happy over
midterms and worried about the ad
vent of finals.â€”Bub Peck
