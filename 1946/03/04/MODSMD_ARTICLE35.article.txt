# Indian Natators Swamp Olympics in Upset Victory
## 
### 
Youth paid off against experience
in the Encina pool Saturday after
noon when the Stanford natators
turned back the Olympic Club by
a count of 42 to 33.
The young Indian tankers held
the "O" squad to hut three first
places as they swept the dashes
and relays, with freshman Boh
Anderson setting the pace for the
Cardinal.
Anderson set a new Stanford and
Freshman record in the 100-yard
freestyle dash when he negotiated
the course in 52 seconds flat and
showed plenty of promise for lower
ing that mark in the near future.
The young sorrel-headed Indian
also turned in a 53.5 for his 100
in the medley relay, and then
went on to whip OC's Fred Taoli
in the last leg of the 4(M)-ysml re
lay which provided the Indians
with their victory.
With the count at 35-33 at the
start of the last event, Orville Rule
and Slint Eastman provided the In
dians with a ten-foot lead at the
halfway mark. Cashen made up the
difference for the Clubbers in the
third leg and provided Taoli with a
short edge at the start of the final
dash.
But Anderson churned his way
into the lead before the first lap was
completed, and went on to win by
about 12 feet to give the Indians the
big seven points they needed to win.
Taoli was Hie big noise for the
Olympics, as he turned in two tri
umphs easily in the 220 and 110
freestyle races, and but for An
derson's performance would have
given the Winged "O" the meet.
The Indian medley team of Harry
Borchers, Don Hester and Anderson
had things pretty much their own
way, Anderson winding up a full lap
ahead of Smith of the Club. Time
was 3:05.2.
Taoli and Cashen teamed up in
the 220 to give the Club a one-two
finish, Taoli holding a lap lead over
his teammate as he turned in a
2:15.8.
The Indian duo Len Sperry and
Eastman turned the same trick in
the 50-yard freestyle, Eastman bat
tling it out with Taft of the Club
lor second. Sperry's time was 24.5.
In the diving, it was all Olympic

Club as their team of McCormack
and Marino racked lip 110.4 and
1015.6 points apiece to about half
that for tlie embryonic Cardinal
divers, 'lhe two visitors turned
in an excellent performance on
the 3-meter board that had the
fans alternately gasping and ap
plauding.
Bo re hers had little trouble in tak
ing (he 150-yard backstroke, leading
all the way and winning by better
than five yards in 1:4(5. Herster held
an even more impressive edge in the
200-yard breaststroke which he won
in 2:34.4. Klass Bols placed second
tor Stanford, after fighting oft' (he
last lap surge of the Olympics' Ar
iegiani.
