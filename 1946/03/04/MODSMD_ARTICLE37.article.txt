Breaking into I lie win column for
the first time in three games, Stan
ford's rugby squad convincingly
thumped an overmatched Petaluma
squad by a score of 8-3 on the Farm
rugby turf last Saturday.
Spearheaded by the running of
Don Lipelt and A 1 Miller and the
booting of Hal Bernard, the Card
ruggers out-roughed and out-ma
neuvered the visitors throughout
the contest.
The losers took the lead at the
beginning of the game on a 20-
yard run by Jim Murray, but Al
Miller raced to a score just before
the end of the first period to even
the count.
The game remained scoreless un
til Lipelt broke it up with a 50-yard
sprint through the Petaluma de
fense. Durham kicked conversion
to settle the issue for the Indian
rooters who went home happy
three minutes later.
Coach Kmetovie was well satis
fied with the performances of his
men. Many of them played the full
game, but all came out with noth
ing more than minor bruises.
With the team in top shape, hopes
for beating California when the two
aggregations meet next weekend at
Berkeley are good. The team has
improved consistently since the
season began. At first the men,
many of whom had never played
rugby before, were un-co-ordi
nated in their offense.
Cal has had a slightly better rec
ord of wins and losses this season.
