The Stanford wrestling team lost

decision for 13 points. Willard
Walker at 12K lbs. and Vein
Jones at 136 lbs. won by falls
for Stanford, while Doug Sncll
garnered three points in the 155-
Ib. division.
The jayvees did a little better, as
(hoy scored 21 points to 24 for
the Cadets. Allan Walker, Winston
Mumby, and John Mosher won by
falls for th",B'.s, while Bob Wallace
and John Mosher, coming back for
rpore, won by decisions.
The junior varsity would prob
ably have won had not Doug Snell
been shifted to (he varsity at the
last minute. The highlight of this
match was the exceptional work of
Mosher in winning both the 192-lb.
and heavyweight divisions.
Jones was in fine style as he
won his bout. In ihe Far Western
meet last week, he was called
down too quickly, but be came
back nicely last night. Willard
also looked very well, as did Cap
tain Oscar Thompson, who put up
a great fight against the Far
Western champ, Bob Roemer.
Coach Ted Mumby was very "well
pleased with the matches, and has
high hopes lor next Friday night's
matches with the California grap
olers.
