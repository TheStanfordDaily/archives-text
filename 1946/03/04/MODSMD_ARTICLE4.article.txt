iMADKIt), March (UP).—Car
dinal Spclhnan of New York con
ferred privately with Spanish For
eign Minister Martin Art a. jo to
day during a brief visit to Madrid
on his way home from Rome.
The Cardinal left for Lisbon at
7:20 p.m. after a visit of a little
more than three hours instead of
the overnight stay he originally
intended to make.

in Paris, Washington, and London.
| These three major moves are ex
: pected:
i Expected Moves
1. Simultaneous publication in
the three capitals of a joint declara
i tion inviting the Spanish people to
establish a republican regime them
| selves. The declaration undoubted
j ly will promise the new regime im
{ mediate recognition and support.
2- I'll Miration of a United
States government white book on
Franco's collaboration with the
Axis.
3. Preparation of detailed plans,
at France's request, for placing
the whole Spanish question be
fore the UNO Security Council.
Although the French government
I decided at once to go along with
| the United States and Britain in
i signing the declaration received
I yesterday, there was every indica
tion that it had fallen short of sat-
I isfying Communist demands for a
; complete breach with Franco.
Giral Disappointed
The declaration also was said to
be a disappointment to the exile
Spanish republican government of
Jose Giral y Periera, which had
; hopes of receiving full recognition
| from the Western powers.
Giral's cabinet already has a
j pretty complete version of the dec
laration and sources close to the
exiled republican leader made no
secret of their disappointment that
the document offered them no spe
cific support. Giral postponed until
Tuesday a scheduled meeting of his
cabinet to examine the official text.
