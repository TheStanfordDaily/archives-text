# Card Baseballers Will Meet Gaels
## COACH WOLTER 
### STU MILLAR 
Preparing for their season opener
against the St. Mary's nine tomorrow
at (lie Sunken Damond, Harry Wol
ter's baseballers split up into the
Reds and Whites last Friday to put
on a regulation intra-squad contest.
After the Whi(es iced (he siugfest
by a score of 11-8, Wolter named

I his tentative starting lineup against
I the Herman-Wedemeyer-led Gaels.
Pitching will he I'hil Wolf. With
! a few years of varsity experience
behind him, Wolf should prove
J one of the more competent mem
bers of the green nine. In Fri
j day's game he hurled only two in
nings as a warm-up and his fast
ball found the plate well.
j The Cardinal infield will consist
I of Morgan Miller at first, Tom How
j ard at second, Maurice Peters at
j short, and Larry Prato at third,
j Of this quartet, Howard is the
most experienced. Small and fast.
| he covers the keystone area well.
! Also a sharp hitter. Howard got
two clean singles in the Friday
(ontest. The other half of what
Welters hopes will be a success
ful double play duo, Peters, got
three hits in the practice tilt, one
a double to right field. Miller, the
initial sacker, is a converted third
sacker who may well fill the bill.
Prato is a hustling man at the hot
corner who can be looked for to
field and throw well this season. As
j an alternate to these four, Ray Win-
I terhalter will be Wolter's first
I choice. Just a freshman, Winter
halter has one of the strongest of the
' infield arms on the squad.
Carl Kellenberger is the best
of the Farm's outfield trio. A first
| stringer on Wolter's prewar nines,
he provides most of what class
there is on the team. He hits and
(kids equally well. Because of his
fine batting Friday, Jim Wicker
sham has been given the center
patch position. He collected two
hits in (wo trips to the plate. Jim
Donley completes the list of outer
| gardeners.
Dick Ahlquist will "probably wear
j the pads and mask behind the plate
to receive Wolf tomorrow. Ahlquist
! has been moved up to the first string
position because of the ineligibility
' of Frank McGraw, one of the best
j catchers ever to work out on the
I sunken diamond. McGraw entered
I without a high school diploma and
| is currently on probation.
Other men whom Coach Wolter
might use in the contest are Eg
gleston, Ashley and Hall, out
i fielder, infielder and receiver re
spectively. Palisoul will be on
! hand if Wolf needs any relief,
j Diek Flatland, another one of
| Wolter's pitching hopes, has been
declared ineligible also.
But Stanford's main hopes will
rest on the shoulders of Wolf,
j Howard, and Kellenberger. They
are the nucleus of a team that is
anxious to represent the school
well this spring.
"I don't think I've often had 35
| or 40 youngsters so eager to play
j baseball," said Coach Wolter after
| the practice game.

enced squad will face the St.

sacker who may well fill the bill.
Prato is a hustling man at the hot

field and throw well this season. As
j an alternate to these four, Ray Win-
I terhalter will be Wolter's first
I choice. Just a freshman, Winter
halter has one of the strongest of the
' infield arms on the squad.
Carl Kellenberger is the best
of the Farm's outfield trio. A first
| stringer on Wolter's prewar nines,
he provides most of what class
there is on the team. He hits and
(kids equally well. Because of his
fine batting Friday, Jim Wicker
sham has been given the center
patch position. He collected two
hits in (wo trips to the plate. Jim
Donley completes the list of outer
| gardeners.
Dick Ahlquist will "probably wear

position because of the ineligibility
' of Frank McGraw, one of the best
j catchers ever to work out on the
I sunken diamond. McGraw entered
