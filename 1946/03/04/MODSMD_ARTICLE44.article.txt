Just like a fairy tale. That's the
; way Idaho slid into the ownership
of the Northern Division conference
title. Going into the final game with
i a tie with the Corvallis Beavers,
Idaho whipped WSC 37 to 35, while
over at Eugene. Oregon handed
down the CSC squad a 42 to 41 de
| feat in an overtime game.
This marks the first time in 23
years that Idaho has made claim
to the northern title. Always a
"weak sister" of the league, the
tables were reversed in this year's
basketball race. With such stal
warts as Fred Quinn and Len
Pyne holding down starting berths
I on the Idaho team, the squad has
gone through the season with live
conference defeats. Their string
of victories, however, shouldn't
run out against the Golden Bear
this weekend. This writer confi
j dently predicts a double sweep
for Idaho this week. Any dissent -
i ers?

Now comes the Daily selection
i for the All-Coast basketball team.
| Now this selection represents deep
thought and meditation. We would
like to say, though, that Phil Stein
metz, our northern division basket
i ball editor, was mainly responsible
for the choices, and all complaints
and brickbats should be thrown to
wards Pierce Hall, where Phil is
| spending the winter.
| GALE BISHOP, WSC, forward.
1 MERV LA FAILLE, CAL. forward.
I RED ROCHA. OSC, center.
! LEN PYNE, IDAHO, guard.
808 HAMILTON, OREGON, guard.
