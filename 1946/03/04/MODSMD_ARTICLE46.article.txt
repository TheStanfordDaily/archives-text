# Powerful Freshman Squad Wins Marathon Renewal
## 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
If performance has any bearing on
what to expect in the future, then
the Freshman class has figuratively
served notice on the rest of the Uni
versity that they are a power to be i
reckoned with in th" realm of sports.
Friday afternoon at Angell field
the Stanford track season was
ushered in, quietly and almost
unnoticed by most of the Farm,
when the Frosh swept four out of
live events in the first renewal of
the Interclass meet and Irish Ma
rathon in 14 years.
Despite the added attraction of a
special handicap 1320-yard race fea
turing Johnny Fulton and Mushy I
Girard, former Farm track "greats," !
a mere handful of rooters turned out 1
—who through no fault of their own
were outnumbered twice over by the
performers—adding another footnote j
to the sad decline of the "Spirit of j
Stanford."
Fulton breezed home in the handi- j
cap, winning by 40 yards over var- j
sity ace George Grimes, Girard and
Frank Ganahl, negotiating the three- 112
quarters of a mile in 3:09.
The Marathon turned out to be
a field day for the Frosh as their
16-man team breezed into an early
lead, and despite the efforts of !
grads—in behalf of the Seniors— i
Pete Knietovic, Vic Lindskog and
Chuck Taylor (three good men
when they're in shape) held an al- j
most 200-yard lead over the Sen
iors and Sophomores. The latter !
two battled it out on fairly even 1
terms throughout the race, first J
one and then the other edging into 1
minute leads, with the Seniors
nailing second by a whisker. The
Juniors failed to enter a team.
The time was 0:33. I
The Frosh picked up enough points J
in the opening events to cinch the !
title by merely entering a team in J
the Marathon, racking up 22 points
before the relay was run and a lotal
of 32. The Sophomore class edged
the Seniors (and grads) for second
place by 17 to 13. The Juniors tai

lied one point.
(«enc Martin and Dave DeSwarle
teamed up in the three-legged rare
with Al Reynolds and Aubrey De
\ ine giving the Frosh a one-two
finish in the 100-yard romp. The
Sophomore duets of Joe Connolly
and Al Larson and Al Holuhar and
Dun Jones took third and fourth.
Time was 13.7.
Van Johns provided the Frosh
with their second triumph when he
took the 100-yard backward dash in
14.8. Ernest Webb of the Sophs was
second, and Seniors Jack MeCorkle
and Ric Supple third and (fourth.
The only race the green Frosh
failed to take a first in was the
440-yard heel-and-toe walk which
was won by Al Holuhar of the
Sophs. Punch (»reen of the Frosh
was second. Supple of the Seniors
third, and John Alton of tiie
Frosh fourth. Time was 72.4.
The 100-yard eight-man shuttle
hurdle relay race w*is probably the
most spectacular event of the day
in the matter of excitement. The
first two laps were fairly even, but
the Seniors forged ahead for the
middle half of the race, before suc
cumbing to the onslaught of the
Frosh, who barely made it home in
front of the upperclassmen. Time
was 1:42.4.
