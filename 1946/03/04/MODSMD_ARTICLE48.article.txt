# ON THE DISCS
## 
### BY GEORGE ECKSTEIN LARRY FRANKLEY 
Musical Notes
Ted Fioßito graced the Sopho
more Cotillion with his presence
Saturday night, and he* showed up
a little better than expected. Fea
turing danceable music, the Fio-
Rito outfit was benefited by the
number of good songs they played.
Although very much on the
square side, there were several
good instrumentalists in the
group. These were Don Manning
on drums, Nick Bardcs on the
frantic trumpet solos, and Carlos
Triplani on tenor and vocals.
The band will break up this week
after which the members will dis
perse, and Fioßito will reorganize.
Capitol is following the other
disc companies in featuring double
features. They will, however, do
better work than the others,
and they are reuniting Ella Mae
Morse with Freddy Slack and are
joining Johnny Mercer with Coo
tie Williams. . . .
Drummer Ralph Collier with
Stan Kenton has been replaced by

| Charlie Perry, and trumpeter Chico
} Alvarez has rejoined the Kenton
Krew after several years' absence. . . .
Johnny Bothwell, former Raeburn
; tenor man, is rehearsing his new
band in New York. . . . Cozy Cole is
| reported to have joined the Benny
J Goodman band on drums.
Sherwood Sharp
Orchids this week go to Bobby
Sherwood and his tip and coming
orchestra lor (heir newest Capitol
release. The side that merits your
attention is the famous Duke El
lington composition, "Cottontail,"
i which, besides a brief amount of
ensemble work, features solo work
by the band's best artists.
Sherwood's high-note trumpet is
very evident, and Joe McAnarney's
| clarinet solo is one of the record's
j high spots. The ''end" is reached with
| the chorus by Herbie Haymer and his
j tenor. Both his tone and his ideas
I are wonderful!
The reverse is a commercial pop
sung by Bobby and entitled "Snap
Your Fingers." It is one of those
"here today, gone tomorrow" dit
ties about which little can be said
Our bats are off to Capitol for some
of the best recording by any com
pany in months.
After Decca's recent atrocities, it
! was very gratifying to play a record
j that didn't sound as though it was
I recorded in one of Mr. Kaiser's ship
yards. .
Hops. Skips, and Jumps
'J hat "Temperamental" Gentle
man of Swing, Artie Shaw, has
come up with a new and really
! great Gramcrcy Five disc. The
| tunes are "Mysterioso," a title
which fits the mood perfectly, and
"Hop, Skip, and Jump," and it does
—jump, that is.
Featuring the trumpet of Roy El
dridge, the piano of Dodo Marmaroso,
and, of course, the clarinet of Mr.
Shaw, both sides are full of snappy
little riffs and good solos. Since Artie
! has given up the use of a harpsi

chord in his Five, this disc is the
nearest thing to the Goodman Sextet
platters since Benny himself turned
the classics out.
Here We Go Again
For those of you—and we arc
sure there are some—who appreci
ate the finer tortures in life, may
we suggest the newest Dccca re
cording of "The Coconut Song"
done by ah up-and-going band,
Guy ("Makes You Want to Sit This
One Out Music") Lombardo.
Not only is this recording catchy
in its sagging rhythm (accomplished
by the use of two one-armed oboe
players), but also the lyrics aren't
very good.
The Lombardo Trio, featuring
from right to left Mom and Pop
Lombardo and a representative
from the local musicians' union,
give anecdotes on how to solve
your troubles. We don't want to
appear as though we're trying to
sway your judgment, but if you
buy this record, you're out of your
mind.

The other side of the record is
filled by "Tak? Care," featuring a
trumpet solo (muted, of course) and
a vocal solo by Dun Rodney. Rodney
must either be engaged to one of the
Lombardo sisters or be one of Guy's
creditors.
Mr. and Mrs. Music
Peggy Lee and her guitarist hus
band, Dave Barbour, have released
another hit for Capitol. This time
it's "I Can See It Your Way, Baby"
and"I Don't Know Enough About
You." Both sides are ballads ren
dered flawlessly by Mrs. Barbour,
and Mr. Lee's guitar and orches
tra are outstanding. Featuring
counterpoint harmony, the band
has little chance to display itself,
but the few grooves it does get are
accounted for very well.
Peggy's voice and phrasing are
wonderful. We don't want to appear
overly emotional, but as you listen
to the record, you feel as though she
is leaning on your shoulder singing
or whispering into your ear. And
that's what we like about the South.

After Decca's recent atrocities, it
! was very gratifying to play a record
j that didn't sound as though it was
I recorded in one of Mr. Kaiser's ship
yards. .
Hops. Skips, and Jumps
'J hat "Temperamental" Gentle
man of Swing, Artie Shaw, has
come up with a new and really
! great Gramcrcy Five disc. The
| tunes are "Mysterioso," a title
which fits the mood perfectly, and
"Hop, Skip, and Jump," and it does
—jump, that is.
Featuring the trumpet of Roy El
dridge, the piano of Dodo Marmaroso,
and, of course, the clarinet of Mr.
Shaw, both sides are full of snappy
little riffs and good solos. Since Artie
! has given up the use of a harpsi

chord in his Five, this disc is the
nearest thing to the Goodman Sextet
platters since Benny himself turned
the classics out.
Here We Go Again
For those of you—and we arc
sure there are some—who appreci
ate the finer tortures in life, may
we suggest the newest Dccca re
cording of "The Coconut Song"
done by ah up-and-going band,
Guy ("Makes You Want to Sit This
One Out Music") Lombardo.
Not only is this recording catchy
in its sagging rhythm (accomplished
by the use of two one-armed oboe
players), but also the lyrics aren't
very good.
The Lombardo Trio, featuring
from right to left Mom and Pop
Lombardo and a representative
from the local musicians' union,
give anecdotes on how to solve
your troubles. We don't want to
appear as though we're trying to
sway your judgment, but if you
buy this record, you're out of your
mind.

The other side of the record is
filled by "Tak? Care," featuring a
trumpet solo (muted, of course) and
a vocal solo by Dun Rodney. Rodney
must either be engaged to one of the
Lombardo sisters or be one of Guy's
creditors.
Mr. and Mrs. Music
Peggy Lee and her guitarist hus
band, Dave Barbour, have released
another hit for Capitol. This time
it's "I Can See It Your Way, Baby"
and"I Don't Know Enough About
You." Both sides are ballads ren
dered flawlessly by Mrs. Barbour,
and Mr. Lee's guitar and orches
tra are outstanding. Featuring
counterpoint harmony, the band
has little chance to display itself,
but the few grooves it does get are
accounted for very well.
Peggy's voice and phrasing are
wonderful. We don't want to appear
overly emotional, but as you listen
to the record, you feel as though she
is leaning on your shoulder singing
or whispering into your ear. And
that's what we like about the South.
Musical Notes
Ted Fioßito graced the Sopho
more Cotillion with his presence
Saturday night, and he* showed up
a little better than expected. Fea
turing danceable music, the Fio-
Rito outfit was benefited by the
number of good songs they played.
Although very much on the
square side, there were several
good instrumentalists in the
group. These were Don Manning
on drums, Nick Bardcs on the
frantic trumpet solos, and Carlos
Triplani on tenor and vocals.
The band will break up this week
after which the members will dis
perse, and Fioßito will reorganize.
Capitol is following the other
disc companies in featuring double
features. They will, however, do
better work than the others,
and they are reuniting Ella Mae
Morse with Freddy Slack and are
joining Johnny Mercer with Coo
tie Williams. . . .
Drummer Ralph Collier with
Stan Kenton has been replaced by

| Charlie Perry, and trumpeter Chico
} Alvarez has rejoined the Kenton
Krew after several years' absence. . . .
Johnny Bothwell, former Raeburn
; tenor man, is rehearsing his new
band in New York. . . . Cozy Cole is

J Goodman band on drums.
Sherwood Sharp

Sherwood and his tip and coming
orchestra lor (heir newest Capitol
release. The side that merits your
attention is the famous Duke El
lington composition, "Cottontail,"
i which, besides a brief amount of
ensemble work, features solo work
by the band's best artists.
Sherwood's high-note trumpet is
very evident, and Joe McAnarney's

j high spots. The ''end" is reached with

sway your judgment, but if you
buy this record, you're out of your
mind.

The other side of the record is
filled by "Tak? Care," featuring a
trumpet solo (muted, of course) and
a vocal solo by Dun Rodney. Rodney
must either be engaged to one of the
Lombardo sisters or be one of Guy's
creditors.
Mr. and Mrs. Music
Peggy Lee and her guitarist hus
band, Dave Barbour, have released
another hit for Capitol. This time
it's "I Can See It Your Way, Baby"
and"I Don't Know Enough About
You." Both sides are ballads ren
dered flawlessly by Mrs. Barbour,
and Mr. Lee's guitar and orches
tra are outstanding. Featuring
counterpoint harmony, the band
has little chance to display itself,
but the few grooves it does get are
accounted for very well.
Peggy's voice and phrasing are
wonderful. We don't want to appear
overly emotional, but as you listen
to the record, you feel as though she
is leaning on your shoulder singing
or whispering into your ear. And
that's what we like about the South.
Musical Notes
Ted Fioßito graced the Sopho
more Cotillion with his presence
Saturday night, and he* showed up
a little better than expected. Fea
turing danceable music, the Fio-
Rito outfit was benefited by the
number of good songs they played.
Although very much on the
square side, there were several
good instrumentalists in the
group. These were Don Manning
on drums, Nick Bardcs on the
frantic trumpet solos, and Carlos
Triplani on tenor and vocals.
The band will break up this week
after which the members will dis
perse, and Fioßito will reorganize.
Capitol is following the other
disc companies in featuring double
features. They will, however, do
better work than the others,
and they are reuniting Ella Mae
Morse with Freddy Slack and are
joining Johnny Mercer with Coo
tie Williams. . . .
Drummer Ralph Collier with
Stan Kenton has been replaced by

| Charlie Perry, and trumpeter Chico
} Alvarez has rejoined the Kenton
Krew after several years' absence. . . .
Johnny Bothwell, former Raeburn
; tenor man, is rehearsing his new
band in New York. . . . Cozy Cole is
| reported to have joined the Benny
J Goodman band on drums.
Sherwood Sharp
Orchids this week go to Bobby
Sherwood and his tip and coming
orchestra lor (heir newest Capitol
release. The side that merits your
attention is the famous Duke El
lington composition, "Cottontail,"
i which, besides a brief amount of
ensemble work, features solo work
by the band's best artists.
Sherwood's high-note trumpet is
very evident, and Joe McAnarney's
| clarinet solo is one of the record's
j high spots. The ''end" is reached with
| the chorus by Herbie Haymer and his
j tenor. Both his tone and his ideas
I are wonderful!
The reverse is a commercial pop
sung by Bobby and entitled "Snap
Your Fingers." It is one of those
"here today, gone tomorrow" dit
ties about which little can be said
Our bats are off to Capitol for some
of the best recording by any com
pany in months.
After Decca's recent atrocities, it
! was very gratifying to play a record
j that didn't sound as though it was
I recorded in one of Mr. Kaiser's ship
yards. .
Hops. Skips, and Jumps
'J hat "Temperamental" Gentle
man of Swing, Artie Shaw, has
come up with a new and really
! great Gramcrcy Five disc. The
| tunes are "Mysterioso," a title
which fits the mood perfectly, and
"Hop, Skip, and Jump," and it does
—jump, that is.
Featuring the trumpet of Roy El
dridge, the piano of Dodo Marmaroso,
and, of course, the clarinet of Mr.
Shaw, both sides are full of snappy
little riffs and good solos. Since Artie
! has given up the use of a harpsi

chord in his Five, this disc is the
nearest thing to the Goodman Sextet
platters since Benny himself turned
the classics out.
Here We Go Again
For those of you—and we arc
sure there are some—who appreci
ate the finer tortures in life, may
we suggest the newest Dccca re
cording of "The Coconut Song"
done by ah up-and-going band,
Guy ("Makes You Want to Sit This
One Out Music") Lombardo.
Not only is this recording catchy
in its sagging rhythm (accomplished
by the use of two one-armed oboe
players), but also the lyrics aren't
very good.
The Lombardo Trio, featuring
from right to left Mom and Pop
Lombardo and a representative
from the local musicians' union,
give anecdotes on how to solve
your troubles. We don't want to
appear as though we're trying to
sway your judgment, but if you
buy this record, you're out of your
mind.
