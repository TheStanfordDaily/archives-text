# POSTWAR MARDI GRAS
## 
### 
NEW ORLEANS, March 3 (UP).
â€”Momus, God of Mockery and Re
buke, rode through the streets of
New Orleans tonight atop a throned
float as tens of thousands of persons
cheered the opening parade of the
first postwar Mardi Gras.
Preceded and surrounded by jig
ging Negroes carrying gasoline
torches, the 15 floats of the Krewe
of Momus trudged slowly from their
den to start the long trek down
fashionable St. Charles avenue into
Canal street where the bulk of the
crowds had been waiting for hours.
