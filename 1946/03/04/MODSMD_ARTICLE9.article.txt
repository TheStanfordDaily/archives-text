# Red Cross Will Extend Drive; Quota Nearly Met
## 
### 
Stanford's Red Cross Drive will
continue through the first part of
this week, according to the drive
chairman, Nancy Banning. Friday's
donations amounted to almost $1,-
490, which leaves $400 yet to go in
the $3,000 quota.
Student Co-operation Good
Miss Banning stated that in past
years the Farm Red Cross Drive
has been run for two weeks, and
that the student body has co-op
erated very well to come so close
to the quota this year in one week.
One of the reasons for the exten
sion of the drive is that the N.R.0.-
T.C. at Toyon will not be able to
turn in its donations until Tues
day.
The drive chairman urges every
Stanford student to contribute to
the Red Cross in the next two

clays. The peacetime Red Cross
needs every American's backing,
she added.
Collections to Continue
Living group representatives are
urged to turn in all the contribu
tions can collect as soon as
possible. Merle Beuttel, treasurer
of the drive, will continue to use
room 13 of the Old Union as an
office. Her hours will be from 3:30
to 5 p.m. for the remaining days of
the drive.
According to Miss Beuttel, the
majority of the men's halls on cam
pus have not turned in any Red
Cross donations. She asks that the
solicitors from the men's living
groups collect from the students in
their halls and report to her.
I Booths will be placed on Quad
again today for the ofT-campus stu
dents.
