John M. Stalnaker, Dean of Stu
dents, discussed the problem of
keeping the living groups open un-

I til 1:30 on Saturday nights with
Conference members. Since all the
j women on campus want their liv
ing groups to stay open between 12
1 and 1:30, the University adminis
' tration will propose some solution
before the end of the quarter, he
! said.
! Trial Basis
Keeping the houses open would
have to be on a trial basis all along,
he said. Whether or not supervi
sion is absolutely nceessary has not
( been decided. "Wc want a system
that wili work over a long period
j of time," he said, "and one that will
not create more problems of con
; duet."
Beaty O'Hair, general chairman
!of Circus Night, reported that
$100.05 was made on general ad
j mission tickets. The concessions
i made $270, but expenses have to be
i deducted from this sum. Proceeds
