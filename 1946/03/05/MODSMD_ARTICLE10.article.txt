## 
### 
• The talk by Will Rogers, Jr., to
morrow evening will be open to the j
public, and there will be no ad- j
mission charge.
Those points were emphasized ]
yesterday by Bud Burdick, chair
man of the Palo Alto - Stanford
Chapter of the American Veterans' i
Committee, which is sponsoring the |
speech.
"There has been som misunder- j
standing about the meeting," Mr. j
Burdick said. "Many students evi- !
dently think that the meeting is for !
veterans only. I want to empha- j
size that all Stanford students and i
faculty members are invited." • |
The speech will be delivered in
the Palo Alto High School audito- j
rium, beginning at 8 p.m.

Mr. Rogers, who recently re- \
turned to the United States after 1
recovering from wounds received J
while serving with the Army in j
Europe, will talk on the subject, !
"World Co-operation versus Peacc- i
time Conscription." A Stanford j
graduate and former California |
Congressman, he has already been ;
mentioned as a contender for the '
Democratic nomination for United (
States Senator or Governor.
Mr. Burdick. in announcing that j
the meeting will not be restricted
to veterans, explained! that the ;
American Veterans' Committee is j
founded on a program of helping
the veteran become an informed
and active member of his commu- j
nity, rather than setting the veter
ans apart as a group. ,

"Veterans who expect their or
ganization to stage public raids on
the treasury, 'or to demand indis
criminate favors for veterans only,
should not join the AVC," Mr. Bur
dick said. "Also, the AVC will not
give its members fancy uniforms or
drum and bugle corps."
Instead of these things, he ex
plained, the AVC hopes to continue
the fight "for a more democratic
and prosperous America and a more
stable world." It thinks it can do
this by a program of "citizens first,
veterans second."
Open to All Veterans
The AVC is open to any World
War II veteran who was honorably
discharged from the Army, Navy,
Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or
Merchant Marine. Its inclusion of
Merchant Marine seamen in its
ranks has aroused considerable
controversy, with other veterans'
outfits contending that this dis
qualified the AVC as a genuine
veterans' organization.
However, when the national AVC
chairman, Charles Bolte, Jr., sug
gested to thd membership recently
that merchant seamen be dropped
from the rolls, the more than 30,000
members throughout the U.S. voted
the proposal down.

that merchant seamen be dropped
from the rolls, the more than 30,000
members throughout the U.S. voted
the proposal down.
The Palo Alto-Stanford chapter
of AVC organized in January
of this year. Members of the chap
ter will be present at the meeting
tomorrow night to talk to any vet
erans interested in joining the or
ganization, Mr. Burdick said.
• The talk by Will Rogers, Jr., to
morrow evening will be open to the j
public, and there will be no ad- j
mission charge.
Those points were emphasized ]
yesterday by Bud Burdick, chair
man of the Palo Alto - Stanford
Chapter of the American Veterans' i
Committee, which is sponsoring the |
speech.
"There has been som misunder- j
standing about the meeting," Mr. j
Burdick said. "Many students evi- !
dently think that the meeting is for !
veterans only. I want to empha- j
size that all Stanford students and i
faculty members are invited." • |
The speech will be delivered in
the Palo Alto High School audito- j
rium, beginning at 8 p.m.
Recently Returned
Mr. Rogers, who recently re- \
turned to the United States after 1
recovering from wounds received J
while serving with the Army in j
Europe, will talk on the subject, !
"World Co-operation versus Peacc- i
time Conscription." A Stanford j
graduate and former California |
Congressman, he has already been ;
mentioned as a contender for the '
Democratic nomination for United (
States Senator or Governor.
Mr. Burdick. in announcing that j
the meeting will not be restricted
to veterans, explained! that the ;
American Veterans' Committee is j
founded on a program of helping
the veteran become an informed
and active member of his commu- j
nity, rather than setting the veter
ans apart as a group. ,

Stresses Citizens First
"Veterans who expect their or
ganization to stage public raids on
the treasury, 'or to demand indis
criminate favors for veterans only,
should not join the AVC," Mr. Bur
dick said. "Also, the AVC will not
give its members fancy uniforms or
drum and bugle corps."
Instead of these things, he ex
plained, the AVC hopes to continue
the fight "for a more democratic
and prosperous America and a more
stable world." It thinks it can do
this by a program of "citizens first,
veterans second."
Open to All Veterans
The AVC is open to any World
War II veteran who was honorably
discharged from the Army, Navy,
Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or
Merchant Marine. Its inclusion of
Merchant Marine seamen in its
ranks has aroused considerable
controversy, with other veterans'
outfits contending that this dis
qualified the AVC as a genuine
veterans' organization.
However, when the national AVC
chairman, Charles Bolte, Jr., sug
gested to thd membership recently
that merchant seamen be dropped
from the rolls, the more than 30,000
members throughout the U.S. voted
the proposal down.
