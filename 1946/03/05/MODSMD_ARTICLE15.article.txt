Stanford students may have t<
chance to get first-hand infor
mation on the 1 DIG gubernatorial
elections and on the California
tidclands controversy when At
torney General Robert W. Ken
ny will discuss his personal ob
servations in politics this after

Prominent in polities for a num
: ber of years, Kenny aided in the
' election of Edwin W. Pauley as
! national committeeman from Cali
! fornia in the 3944 Democratic con-
I vent ion in Chicago. He also helped ;
; Pauley spearhead President Tru
i man's nomination for the vice-prcs- j
] idency.
Hie resultant split in the state
Democratic party between the
pro-Wallace faction and the pro-
Truman group may again come
to the fore in the state guberna

Pauly maintained their control in
the stormy Chicago convention,
the division of the partv may re

j represented California in the tide- i
lands ownership controversy with
j the federal government. It is be
l lieved that this issue may also have
! bearing on the coming elections.

will run on the Democratic ticket

himself declared he is "not in the
race as yet."
The Attorney General's choice
for Democratic Senator is Will
Rogers, Jr., an announced candi
date for the United States Senate,

Republicans in the meantime
think that Kenny's delay is designed
as an act of the Democrats to keep
the public wondering about the
prospective Kenny candidacy.
