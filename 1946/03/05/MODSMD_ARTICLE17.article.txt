# Terman Talks On Electronics Tomorrow 7:30
## 
### 
"Electronic Warfare" will be the
topic of Dr. F. E. Tcrman's lecture
to be given tomorrow evening at
7:30 in Cubberley Auditorium.
Dr. Terman, dean of the School
of Engineering, will illustrate his
talk with slides and a sound film
"Radar Countermeasures," which
was produced during the war for the
purpose of explaining countermeas
ure developments to high stall offi
cers in the armed forces.
Dr. Terman organized and di
rected the Itadio Research Lab
oratory at Harvard University
which produced practically all of
the radar countermeasures. Some
of the results of the efforts were a
75 per cent reduction in the ef
fectiveness of German anti-air
craft fire, German confusion on
D-Day by radar countermeasures
which feinted much of their
strength out of position, and com
pulsion of the Germans and Japs
to discontinue using their radar
in the latter stages of the war so
as not to disclose their own posi
tions.
The two general types of counter
measures developed by Terman and
his staff were aluminum foil strips
of "tuned" lengths and electronic
detectors and jammers.
Ail engineering faculty and stu
dents arc invited tn attend the lec
