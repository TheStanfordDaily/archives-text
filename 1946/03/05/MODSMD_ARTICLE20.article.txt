### 
Service men in hospitals who
look to the Red Cross for the large
or small "extras" that keep a man
interested in his future, or enter
tained during his pain, have made
two requests of the local Red Cross
chapter. Red Cross, since it is no
more than the organized helpful
ness of the community, asks every
one who can to send in the articles
the men want.
They want road maps for plan
ning trips for their, first outings as
civilians. Or they want to plan out
the best way to drive themselves
home. Road maps arc still war
scarcities. Anyone who can turn
some in will lighten weary hours
for a man not yet a veteran.
They also want foreign stamps,
rarer American stamps, and can
celed stamps on the envelopes they
come on. Stamp - collecting and
stamp-swapping will) other addicts
make up one of the possible "big
games" of convalescence.
These articles may be brought to
the Daily shack at any time during
the day. A box will be placed in
(lie managing editor's office where
the donations can be placed.
Maps and stamps can also be
mailed in or left with the local Red
