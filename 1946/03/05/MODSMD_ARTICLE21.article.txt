WASHINGTON, March 4 (UP).—
A bill to extend the draft six months
heylond its present expiration date
of May 15, but to limit inductees to
physically fit men between 21 and
25, was introduced today by Chair
man Andrew J. May (D., Ky.) of
the House Military Affairs Commit
tee.
The proposal would rob selective
service of its greatest manpower pool
—the 18-year-olds. Men from 18
through 25 now are subject to call.
