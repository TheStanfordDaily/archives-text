# Speculation on Spain
## 
### 
The "white paper" indictment of Generalis
simo Francisco Franco and his Axis-collabora
tor government published by our state de
partment yesterday gave to the Spanish peo
ple their first positive indication as to where
they stand in the garbled diplomatic struc
tures of a world "newly cleansed of Fascism."
After a week of hooded conferences in the
wake of the French demand for an open break
with Spain's Communist-killers and wartime
back slabbers, the United States, France and
Britain compromised as to the stiffness of the
pro] o::ed action, and relayed final decision on
the issue to the Spanish people, promising
that if Franco were ousted peacefully they
would recognize any interim government
granting political freedoms to all.
Yet where the popular move would orig
inate was an international question. Promise
of no inte: ierence in Spanish internal affairs,
and intimated diplomatic isolation for the
country if Franco remained as ruler, were the
only cues for action contained in the declara
tion.
Republican movements of statesmen out
side of Spain have, to our knowledge, no or
ganized support within, although conserva
tive leaders Martinez-Barrio and Giral are
hovering in Paris awaiting an invitation to
move in. Despite the fact that the pro-Russian
faction of the extra-Spain Republicans, led by
Negiin, is a "decisioned" minority, the out
break of civil war might lead to the estab
lishment of a radical republic which would
extend Russian sway in the Western Medi
terranean, a move greatlly feared by Brit

ain and the U.S.
Royalists within Spain itself, remembering
the ways of peace, are fairly strong under
the Duke of Alba and in the army, but Franco
has effectively stepped upon them in the past
weeks. A monarchy strong enough to bal
ance and rise above the factions within the
nation would projpably be the most satisfac
tory form of government for its people. But
whence will be royalists rise?
What we may look for immediately is a
strengthening of absolutist support as a re
sult of Allied firing, much as has resulted in
Argentina from election estimates. Franco
has a strong (though not conclusively strong)
hold on the Spanish government, and with
the advantage of a head-start on the Allied
declaration, has upped his position consider
ably in the last few weeks. However he has
yet to meet the problems of food shortages,
strikes in the north, and inflation which are
plaguing his people.
If there is response to the three-power ex
hortation to the Spanish people, the next
issue will be whether civil war can be avert
ed. Moroccan divisions that fought under
Franco in the last civil war are being im
ported, according to reports, and troops are
collecting along the French border.
When and IF—a resistance move be
gins, the three powers which backed the
Generalissimo's overthrow must also take
the responsibility of backing whatever pop
ular government emerges and announcing
its presence for international negotiations by
admission into the UNO.— BMV
