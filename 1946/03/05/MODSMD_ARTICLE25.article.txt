# BULL SESSION
## 
### H.D. THOREAU 
Had dinner last Friday night with two celebri
ties, Pierre I fuss, INS cot respondent, and Fulton
Lewi:; Junior, MBS commentator.
Full' n Lewis Junior and ourselves had quite a
chat, a complete transcript of which follows:
"More w.it 1?" queried Fulton Lewis Junior.
"No thanks, Mr. Junior," we averred.
Later on in the evening we found out that his
last name is actually Lewis and not Junior. He
seemed quite impressed with us, but then he has
that air with everyone.
When the waitress refilled his coffee cup, he
almost fell out of tho chair beaming on her and
thanking her profusely. In his lecture to "his broth
i rs" in Sigma Delta Chi and the members of the
San Francisco Press Club, lie seemed more than
happy to explain anything to them that their little
hearts desired.
Mi. Muss, on the other hand, lacked the smooth
exterior possessed by his fellow speaker, but was
able to give some very interesting sidelights on
tlie Nuremberg trials. He has been covering the
war crime trials for the past several months and
will he covering them again in a few short weeks
until their close late in the sutnnu r.
Jilts.-;' parents live i*i Palo Alto, all of which
gives a rather neighborly feeling.
Coiner, time now for the announcing of this
week's winner of the Noble Leslie DeVotie Award
of the Week.
Prefacing ibis announcement it might be well
10 it fresh your memories as to who Noble Les
lie- was. He was ihc first casually of the Civil
War. Apparently he was quite inebriated when
he tried to board the troopship in Mobile and fell
011 the gangplank into the water and drowned.
Several years previously, however, he had founded
what was later to become America's largest social
fraternity. So much for the preface.
The voting litis week was as follows:
1) Si nator Bilbo 144
2) Fulton Lewis Junior 142
3) Junior, class track team 3(5

4) Stan Sehpettier, columnist .... 17
5) Daily Filler Filler 3
(i) Etc 2
Mr. Bilbo's work in squelching the F.E.P.C. in
tho upper House puts him in a class by himself this
week.
Mi 1 . Jun . . . cr Lewis' work is familiar to us
all. IJ is main supporter for first place this week
was Thomas Swain Barclay, long-time admirer of
Fulton Lewis Junior.
The junior class track team amassed the total
of one point in the intcrclass meet last Friday. It's
not easy to be so consistently poor.
Mr. Shpetner needs no introduction. He is
LD 93 dot 30 plus 27. 63f! Alvarado-2059.
The Daily Filler Man did a fine job last week,
including items telling us that Wyoming was the
4-1 tli state in the Union; fresh strawberries are rich
in vitamin C; the first all-steel ice skates were in
vented in 1850; the hawthorn is the state flower of
Missouri; world headquarters of the International
Travel Association are in Los Angeles; and vote
yes on number 1.
Where would we he without you, Mr. Filler
Man?

Here is the beginning of what was probably a
very funny story:
When Wiilly McCall and Pat Carson went to
Denver to n present Leland Stanford in the West
ern Debate Championships, the alumni ofliee/ real
izing that hotels would be very crowded, the
Denver alumni chapter requesting that they find
rooms for the Stanford debaters, Wally McCall
and Pat Carson.
When Mr. McC. and Miss C. detrained in the
Mile-High City they found that one room at the
Denver Athletic Club had been reserved for thern.
