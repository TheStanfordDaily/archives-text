### ELLIOTT EPSTEEN 
The fact that Russian troops are staying in
Azerbaijan shows some interesting things.
First of all, the so-called democratic "people's
ii volution" was either a fiction or not the whole
: lory. Secondly, a drive on Turkey is possible.
If Russia only wanted to liberate Azerbaijan,
lie could conduct a plebiscite under UNO control,
and, if the people were for the revolution, the
autonomous republic idea would win out.
Wri lIDRAWAL'S ADVANTAGES
She could withdraw fiom the province. If the
Teheran government attacked it she could light
ihe Persians with the sympathy of the world in
back of her instead of them.
As for economic and strategic concessions, her
help to the new government would put it in her
debt, and, even if it t was truly independent, it
would give her reasonable concessions out of gratl
l ude.
STAYING S MEANING
Out she is not moving out, and this shows that
hei policy requires her staying.
Firs! of all. it is highly possible and even
probable that the inhabitants of Azerbaijan have
as much use for the "autonomous government"
as the French had for Laval and company, and
the Red Army is required to stay to keep the
people in line.
Secondly, there is the possibility, and for those
who might misunderstand me. only the possibility,
of Russia using the count!y as a base for a further
territorial grab.
As a map will show, this could be a further
lunge into Iran, now that the British are pulling
out according to their part of the agreement that

brought about the occupation, or a strike across
the Turkish frontier.
If a new move is likely, it will probably come
against Turkey.
'I he reasons are thai, first of all, a wholesale
capture of Iran would menace Suez as well as
llritisli oil possessions in that country, and would
probably cause a war on the spot.
Secondly, it would make the Arab League,
which M<i cow is trying to cultivate, a little afraid
for the safety of the Arab states that adjoin Iran.
(Persians are not Arabs themselves, though.)
Third, Russia could make somewhat of a case
for control of the Dardanelles, but not for further
Iranian moves.
PROOF
The proof that this might be the alternative is
in Russian dispositions in Iran. II the Red Army
intended to keep on going, it would be strengthen
ing its Tabriz garrison, because foreign control of
Tabriz makes defense of Teheran impossible.
Instead, she is reported falling back from Tabriz
to high ground in the north.
The front of the Azerbaijan "Republic" has
been set along a good defensive position. The left
is behind a river, with its tributaries branching out
to the south and splitting up any offensive organ
ized against that llank. The right is on very high
ground.
'I lie whole position would be an excellent
cover for a pivot toward Turkey, and could be
held lightly, allowing the maximum possible
force to be employed against the Turks. That is
whv the situation is menacing for the immediate
future, but still, considering England's interests
.1 Turkey, trouble is only a possibility.
