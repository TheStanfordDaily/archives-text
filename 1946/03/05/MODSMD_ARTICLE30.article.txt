### MARY VIRGINIA POND 
The fact that nationalism is not i
dead or obsolete among the lesser I
powers of the world was brought out i
in three speeches by student repre
sentatives of China, Turkey, and ;
Greece when they appeared before j
members of Stanford's International |
Club Sunday evening at 7:30.
Man Chiang Niu ot China, Zafer j
S, Pamir of Turkey, and Chris SioCos
of Greece, all attending Stanford, !
pointed out that nationalism was nec- |
essary as a constructive force in the !
policy <il each of their governments. '
Man Chiang Niu is a student of
biology 011 the Farm. ISe is not a
student of politics, be asserted,'
but he added, "Politicians in China
arc the same as politicians in the
United Stales or in any other
country. The only thing that im- \
pressed me most is that Ameri
cans and citizens from other coun
tries always ask if China is a very
democratic state."
In answering this question Chiang
said it was necessary to know some
thing about ihe social and political
ideas of the Chinese Republic as in
corporated in the Three Main Prin
ciples of Sun Yat Sen. China's first
president. Those principles are na
tionalism, democracy, and liveli- 1
hood or socialism.
Chiang pointed out that before the !
Republic was established 35 years '
ago, 4,000 years of Empire had left '
the whole country suffering. "The !
people were poor, unset fled, and op
pressed by outside nations," Chiang
explained.
If (be country was to survive, if
the people were to wake up and
have a united, modern, and pros
perous country, nationalism was
necessary, Chiang declared. "In
China nationalism stands for cos
mopolitanism—'one people nail
ed as one country.'"
Chinese socialism or livelihood
stands for bitter living conditions
for a greater number of people, for
national government enterprises,
and for the redistribution of the
great land estates among the people"'
to work on.
In regard to Chinese political par
ties Chiang said although then; were
four political parlies, the Kuomin
tang and Communist were the larg
est parlies.
"Itoth parties have a common
ideal—a democratic state," Chiang
said. "They are divided on the
measures to accomplish that pur
pose. The two groups co-operated
until IO2X when on the death of
Sun Yat Sen, they split, having
no common leader to hold them
together.
"Under a united front against the
common enemy they worked togeth
er again in 1037." he explained. "The
Communists fought recently because
they wanted more strength and seats 112
in the government. Now China will !
have no civil war because the Com
munists have what they wanted."
Zafer Pamir, Stanford engineering i
student from Turkey, pointed out '
thai nationalism in "one way or an- j
other and With varying degrees is i
manifest in every country."
Under the leadership of Kemil

Atalurk, Turkey lias strivcd to
build herself lip socially and po
litically. "The Turks thought they
could beneiit by becoming a mem
ber of Western Civilization which
has made such great strides," Pa
mir asserted. "Therefore Turkey
desired to keep the friendship of
all countries and they have at-
I tempted to keep that policy con
sistently."
At the next meeting ol' the UNO
| in New York, Pamir contended, the
■ question of Russia's rights to the
' Dardanelles will come up. "Turkey
j may be asked to relinquish her rights
J lo this waterway, but she doesn't be
i lievc that she should be the only
{ country to relinquish rights to wa
terways."
C hris Siocos, student from Ath
ens, Greece, declared that nation
i alism in Greece was of no inter
est because "in an industrial age
llje smaller nations can hardly
wage warfare."
"It would be better to discuss na
| tionalism in regard (o England, the
United States, and Russia who are
I the only nations in the world in a
position lo wage large scale wars
thai is reality," he said. "They're the
! only potential war-makers."
Siocos pointed out that the last
| war waged between the smaller na
| tions was the so-called Greco-Turk
| isli war following World War I. Since
! then, contrary to what many believe,
the Greeks and the Turks have been
on very friendly terms, Siocos stated.
Siocos also emphasized the fact
j that Greek students take more inter
l <\st in politics than American stu
dents. "Greek university students
lake a leading part in society as far
as politics are concerned," he
claimed. "They are organized and
i have spokesmen and will revert lo
! more violent means if tli'y feel it is
necessary to gain their ends."
Siocos cited the example of a
group of Greek students, of which
he was one, striking against (heir
university because they did not
approve of the way one of their
instructors was teaching philoso
; phy. "University students in
Greece are called academic citi
zens," Siocos explained.

"What nationalism or national
sovereignty means for a country lits
in with the philosophic trends of
that country," Siocos asserted. "Ag
gressive nationalism is stretching a
concept which is essentially a con
structive part of any nation and is
necessary for the welfare ol that
nation."
