Baseball grabs the limelight this
afternoon, when Harry Wolter's
diamondeers play host to the John
ny Vergez-led St. Mary's nine. This
game marks the initial contest of
the season for both squads, and is
rated strictly a toss-up in the
books.
The locals are paced by Phil
Wolf, a flinger with some varsity
experience behind him. The rest of
the team lacks experience in the
collegiate brand of baseball. But so
does St. Mary's.
Farm chances surely wouldn't
be hurt any if some Cardinal col
legiatcs would bide the texts
under the desk for a few hours
and bobble over to the Sunken

Diamond to take in the horsebide
contest. Admission will be free
for nolhin' . . . What can you
lose?

Coach Sam Barry — also the

ten Icttcrmcn on the diamond
squad. All Samuel B. has to do
now is decide which nine are the
best players. Isn't that a nasty
chore?
Starting out with the moundmen,
a whole crew of pitchers are avail-
I able. Jack Nichols, Bob Webster
j (both hoop men), Tom Nicoloff,

regular mound duty.
The infield is also sporting big
! Trojan men. At second base is Torn
Phelps; at third, Dick Baugh holds
down the spot; Bobby Jones is also
! available for shortstop duty. Over
at first base, a battle royal is tak
ing place between Bay Wolochow
and Bill Spaeder.
Catching chores will probably go
to Don Palmer, who held down the
spot in '44. when the S.C.-ers grab
bed All-Coast honors. In the or

man last season. Also on hand are
about seven more catchers, and a
