# Farm, Gaels Bat Today
## 
### STU MILLAR 
Stanford's 1940 edition of a Harry
Wolter baseball team will trot out i
to their positions at 2:30 this after
noon to op?n the Farm baseball
season against St. Mary's College on
the Sunken Diamond.
Phil Wolf, polished right-hander,
and Dick Ahlquist, catchcr, will
be the Stanford battery.
Not much is known about the i
Gaels except that they are led by
Herman Wedemeyer of football
fame. lie is supposed to be as
good on the diamond as on the
football turf and several big
league talent scouts have been
sniffing about IVloraga. Johnny
Verge/, well-known Coast League
horsebide veteran, will coach the
visitors.
This is his first fling at coaching. ;
But whatever inexperience he has j
will be more than overshadowed by j
his ..seasoned squad.
On the other hand, Stanford will
field one of its greenest nines in !
history. Only Wolf, Carl Kellen- !
berger, hard-hitting fly-hawk, and
Tom Howard, second baseman, can 1
be classed as experienced. But
Wolter, Farm baseball coach, is an 1
old hand at the trade. He has de
veloped many outstanding players
during his career.
All of his ability and knowledge
of strategy will be needed this af
ternoon if the Card combine is to
come out on top.
Other members of the Stanford
starting team are Morgan Miller,
first sacker: Larry I'rato, third
baseman; Maurice Peters, short
stop; Jim Wickcrsham, center
fielder; and Jim Dooley, right
fielder.
Coach Wolter has had little to say
about the team's chances this year.
He-is happy with the spirit and ea
gerness shown by all the men out
for the squad, but he knows that
more than fight will be needed to
defeat some of the classy Coast
Conference aggregations that Stan
ford will face this spring.
Today's game is the test. If many
of the players prove themselves,
they will gain the poise and con
fidence that are necessary to be
outstanding baseballmen.
