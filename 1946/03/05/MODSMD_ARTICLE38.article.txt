# The 						Umpire's Verdict
## 
### JOHN SABIN 
March 29 is the red-letter day for
Pacific Coast League baseball clubs.
On that day the 180-gamc schedule
for 194G gets under way. With spring
training going full blast, hardly a
coast manager has failed to express
hopes for his team's pennant chances.
Of local interest are the pros
pects for the San Francisco Seals.
This year the Seals are training
in the Hawaiian Islands. Whether
the various diversions offered in
the Islands will prove to be an
aid or a detriment to the Seals'
pennant hopes is yet to be seen,
but it is certain that the club man
aged by veteran Frank "Lefty"
O'Doul will be tough competition
for any title aspirant.
Greatest blow to the 1946 Seals
is the loss of thirty-game winner |
Bob Joyce who has gone on to the
majors. Joyce led all Pacific Coast 1
League pitchers last year and his
absence will be sorely felt by the I
Seals. Lefty O'Doul is counting on
the influx of returning veterans in
training camp to bolster last year's
fourth-place team. The Seals' .al
ways confident boss has, as usual, I
predicted that his team will be at or
near the top, fighting for that cher
! ished bit of bunting.
At the same time, Lefty O'Doul
has called the Los Angeles Angels
the team to beat for 1!J4(». Ac
tually, Los Angeles is always the
team to beat. The Angels start
with the cards stacked in their fa
vor for one reason—money. No
matter bow poor a team they field,
the Angels arc always assured of
paid customers; they can't miss
with a city that large. Another
reason for their usual success is
that the Angels arc owned by one
of the richest teams in big-time
baseball, the Chicago Cubs, al
ways obliging about farming out
promising players and leaving
them with the farm club through
out the season. This all spells
plenty of the green stuff, and.
coupled with the fact that (he
Angels have over sixty players
returning from the armed forces.
Bill Sweeney's boys seem to stand
Ihe best chance to wind up on top
this year.
Nevertheless, don't count last
j year's pennant-winning Portland
Beavers out of the race. Marvin
i Owen's surprise team of 1945 seems
| sure to end at least in the first divi
; sion this year despite the loss of the
core of its pitching and infield staff.
General Manager Bill Klepper

is a shrewd baseball trader from
way back, and you can bcl that he
look more than peanuts in ex
change for Johnny O'Neal, Lefty
M'ossor, Don Pulford, Roy lliser,
and others who went to the majors
at (he end of last season. One ad
dition to the team will probably
be "Kewpie" Dick Barrett who,
for several years won at least
twfenty games per season for Se
attle before going to Philadelphia.
Barrett is still haggling over a
contract, but will almost certainly
be signed. It is still a question
whether the gaps in the lineup
can be filled. If they are, watch
out for the Beavers!
Always a pennant threat are the '
Seattle Rainiers. The Raihiers have j
the newest ball park on the coast
and plenty of money in the form of J
Emil Sick who graduated from Stan
ford some years back and made his !
fortune the easy way—in the beer
business. Manager Bill Skifl has not
had a second division team in nearly
ten years, and, just a short while
back, won three championships in
a row. The success of the Seattle
entries can be accredited to two
factors: manager Skid and Mr.
Sick's money. Both will be in there
fighting for the Suds.
The only other club which is
rated to be a threat this year is
the Sacramento Solons. Last year's
Solons had the best hitting in the
league and might have copped the
pennant with a little pitching.
Some of the batting is gone this
year, principally second baseman
Gene Ilandley, and this should
keep the Solons down, unless they
run across some pitchers.
Two teams which stand only an
outside chance are the San Diego
Padres and the Oakland Acorns.
Either may prove surprising. Both
are fortunate in their managers: San
Diego's Pepper Martin, "the wild
hoss of the Osage" was a top flight
player for the St. Louis Cardinals
a few years back and knows his
baseball. Casey Stengel of the Oaks

is another of those loud and fighting
managers like Bill Sweeney of the
Angels and Leo Durocher of the
Brooklyn Dodgers.
Unless all the dopesters are up
set in their predictions, the Holly
wood Stars will again occupy the
cellar. It's simply a problem of no
money and 110 players.
With the exception of the Stars,
any Coast League team might come
up with a winner this year. The war
brought new interest and new wealth
\ to the Coast League, and with it a
bid for major league status. The
! chances of the Pacific Coast for a
I major league next year will depend
on the brand of ball played and the
i attendance. Coast League owners
' are hopeful of both. A close race
I among strong teams this year might
I do the trick; prospects seem bright
for such a race in 1946.
