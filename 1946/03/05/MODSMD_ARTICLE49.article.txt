### 
"Lagunita Lake cannot he rccommcndcd as a swimming hole," is the
reply of Dr. Luckctt, the University Health Ofliccr, to inquiries con
cerning the sanitary qualities of the lake water.
It does not meet the standards established by the State Board of
Health, or recommended l»y the L'.S. Public Health Scrvice, for swim
| ming pool water. Laboratory tests show that the water is contaminated
with intestinal bacteria. These probably come for the most part from
the stable and horse lot at the edge of the lake. But a recent inspection
indicates that some of these bacteria may come from toilets on the ceek
and diversion canal.
The threat of possible' infection is always present, and cldorination
would not be practicable. Or. Luckett advises against swimming there ]
so long as there arc perfectly safe pools available on the campus for
mixed swimming.
