# Box Office Receipts Show Farm Prefers Sordid Entertainment

### BOB PECK 
Murder, jealousy, drink, and
faithlessness are tops on the roster
of the Stanford Theatre's patronage
in Palo Alto â€” seemingly proving
that the studios in Hollywood or the
students at Stanford are addicted
to the more sordid side of Screen en
tertainment. An examination of the
theatre's receipts lists murder as its
biggest attraction, being listed twice
in the top five pictures of the past
year.
'"Spellbound" was the top gross
picture of the year's period. Dealing
with murder and a very attractive
woman psychiatrist, Alfred Hitch
cock's thriller packed the fans into
the Stanford Theatre for a solid
week breaking all previous box of
fice records there.
Tierney Second
Second on the list was a surprise
hit, "Leave Her to Heaven," starring
Gene Tierney. Panned by a major
ity of critics and named by one New

York reviewer as one of the 10
worst of the year, Ben Ames Wil
liams' story of a jealous woman
topped all records except that of
"Spellbound."
Third on the box oflice list was
Academy Award favorite, "The Lost
Weekend.'' Playing for a week, "The
Lost Weekend" attracted a multi
tude of Stanford students who
fllocked to see Ray Milland go
through various stages of alcohol
ism finally to be cured by a "desire
to give it up."
Rhapsody Fourth
"Rhapsody in Blue," the musical
life of George Gershwin, was fourth
in total receipts, slightly disproving
the theory that Stanford students al
ways see pictures of the sordid na
ture.
Faithlessness and another case of
murder enter into "Mildred Pierce,"
fifth in popularity with the Farm
during the past year. Adapted from
James M. Cain's novel of Glendale
and Los Angeles during the first part
of the Roosevelt administration,
"Mildred Pierce" gave Joan Craw
ford her best role in 18 years of
movie making.
War Pics Flop
War pictures were the biggest flops
of the year, the lone exception being
John Ford's "They Were Expend
able." Biggest box office disaster of
the year was "Back to Bataan," an
ill-timed R-K-G release.
Currently playing at the Stanford
is a hold-over attraction, "The Bells
of St. Mary's," which is expected to
net a high gross when the receipts
are figured up. Coming is "The
Harvey Girls" with Judy Garland.
Van's a Favorite
Van Johnson comes close to top
ping the list as far as male stars go
in correlation with the box oflice re
ceipts. His "Thrill of a Romance"
and "Weekend at the Waldorf" were
big hits with Farm audiences. Brown
pointed out, though, that M-G-M is
smart enough to surround Johnson
with good co-stars in his pictures so
its hard to judge how many of the
fans are actually drawn into the
theatre by Johnson.
One of the big surprises of the
box office receipts was J. Arthur
Rank's "Blithe Spirit." Starting out
as a second feature on the billing,
"Blithe Spirit" was promptly placed
on the top side of the schedule.
Without star drawing power, "Blithe
Spirit" carried its co-feature into
the upper brackets.
