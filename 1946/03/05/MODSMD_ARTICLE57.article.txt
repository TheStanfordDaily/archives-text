### 
WASHINGTON, March 4 (UP).- j
The United Stales revealed to the
world tonight that after the fall j
of France Spanish Generalissimo
Francisco Franco plotted with Adolf ,
Hitler to put Spain in the war on
the side of the Axis by stabbing
Britain in the back at Gibraltar.
This was revealed as the United i
States, Great Britain, and France j
issued their declaration calling for [
the "peaceful" ousting of Franco
and establishment of an interim j
government.
Franco Won't Quit
But 24 hours before the three
power declaration was issued, it
was learned, Franco served notice ■
on the United States that he would
not quit under threats of pressure
by any power or combination of j
powers.
It was learned that Franco's note i
was delivered to the State Depart
ment in anticipation of the three- j
power declaration which had been
expected since late last week. The
note was said to make "crystal i
clear that in Franco's views Spain
was capable of looking after her
own affairs and of choosing her own
type of government.
Planned in 1940
Franco's price for entering the i
war was to have been African "liv- I
ing space" for Spain — most of ]
Northwestern Africa, now being S
held by France, as well as incor
poration of Gibraltar into Spain.
The intrigue, hatched in the dark
days of 1940 after Dunkirk and af- ;
ter Italy's earlier stab in the back j
of France, was released in 15,000 j
words of documents captured from i
the Germans and now released by j
the State Department to prove j
Franco's often-denied colaboration |
with the Axis.
