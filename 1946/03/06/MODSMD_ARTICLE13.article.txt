' lion with the Division of Music, will
! begin its three-day run tomorrow
night at 8:15 in the Memorial Au
] litorium.
To highlight the performances
I there will be 14 scene changes un
j der the direction of Jack Sollcrs.
| These sets have been worked out
i in authentic Egyptian detail with
the "Book of the Dead" as the
source.
According to F. Cowles Strick
land, professor of speech and
drama and stage director of the
present production, "The Magic
Flute" lias a reputation for being
over - staged in answer to high
J comedy demands. In the Stan
, ford production, however, there
! has been a strict attempt for sim
! plification of the original script.
The climax of the opera comes
when Tamino and Pamina enter the
caves to meet the final tests of fire
and water. The impressions of ac-
I tual fire and water are effected by
original lighting against a white
' backdrop. The entire production
i includes 38 light changes.
Together with the Egyptian sets
arc several fantastic creations
which bring out the moods of the
particular scenes. The carved
stone effect is obtained by apply
ing scene paint with sponges as
well as brushes, and by painting
in strict distinctions of light and
j dark shades.
Working with Mr. Sollers on
I lighting is George C. Smedburg.
