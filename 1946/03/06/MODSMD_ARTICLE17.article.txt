general topic for the traditional
Joffre debate between the Univer

Ornitz and Falk recommended
a system of inspection including
a powerful international police
force and random inspection of
factories, free international ex
change of scientific information,
and an international geological
board determining the radioactive
elements that can be used in the
manufacture of the bomb.
Cal speakers Beatrice Challiss and
Clark Macer stressed the inherent
weaknesses of the United Nations.

ties of inspection and the failure of
UNO in its recent meetings to solve
any of the conflicts before it..
We should keep the bomb, the
California representatives main
tained, until we have evidence of
trust and cooperation between na
tions along with the proper
changes in the UNO Charter. If
we turn the bomb over to the Se
curity Council war will be en
couraged for controls cannot be
effective against any country that
does not want to obey, leaving us
at the mercy of aggressors.

ensic scene concerns the selection

the two universities will be held
some time in May.
Secondly, Stanford and UC op
posed each other for the first time
in ten months in a non-decision
freshman debate yesterday after
noon.
Lee Falk and Ed Ornitz, speaking
for Stanford, advocated UNO pos
session of atomic bomb secrets on
the grounds that nationalistic con
trol of the bomb will lead to war,
(hat in such a war no practical de
fense will be possible, and that the
UNO is the only existing means to
control atomic energy.
Ornitz and Falk recommended
a system of inspection including
a powerful international police
force and random inspection of
factories, free international ex
change of scientific information,
and an international geological
board determining the radioactive
elements that can be used in the
manufacture of the bomb.
Cal speakers Beatrice Challiss and
Clark Macer stressed the inherent
weaknesses of the United Nations.
Pointing to the veto and d(ynestic
affairs clauses in the UNO charter,
Miss Glial lis ami Macer held effec
tive UNO control impossible.
They also emphasized the difficul
ties of inspection and the failure of
UNO in its recent meetings to solve
any of the conflicts before it..
We should keep the bomb, the
California representatives main
tained, until we have evidence of
trust and cooperation between na
tions along with the proper
changes in the UNO Charter. If
we turn the bomb over to the Se
curity Council war will be en
couraged for controls cannot be
effective against any country that
does not want to obey, leaving us
at the mercy of aggressors.
The last development on the for
ensic scene concerns the selection
of a Stanford team to engage in a
return contest with UC ?it Berkeley
today. Dick Philips and Jack Jones
were selected yesterday after an
elimination debate against Bob Ben
nett and Ronald KU-in.
Three events of major importance
to Stanford debating occurred yes
terday.
Most significant in the long run is
flic decision reached by Leland T.
Chapin, coach of Farm debaters, and
Jacobus ten Block, Cal coach, on a
general topic for the traditional
Joffre debate between the Univer
sity of California and Stanford.
"The Influence of Franco in the
World Today" is the subject se
lected by the two coaches. A
specific question will be framed
from this topic and given to Joffre
participants an hour before the
contest. The 52nd clash between
the two universities will be held
some time in May.
