The problem of controlling a postwar, de
feated Japanese nation seemed almost in
surmountable only a few short months ago.
Today, with the exception of passing attention
to war criminal trials, the American people
and the world have all but forgotten the dif
ficulties entailed in the current reconstruc
tion and administration of Japan.
It is something we should not forget.
Even though Japan's progress in the last few
months has been something that exceeds the
wildest hopes and dreams of the average
Am :rican, it is our responsibiilty—as a gov
erning nation to keep informed on what
goes on in that country.
Certainly, developments so far have been
more than encouraging. General Mac A
rthur, taking on an almost superhuman job
when he was appointed to administer the
islands, has outshone his record in war by
his actions in peace. He deserves full credit
for the state of the Japanese nation today.
Among drastic and hitherto never-before
seen reforms he has instituted under the
broad conditions of the Potsdam Declara
tion have been:
1. Complete disarmament of Japan; aboli
tion of her war industries; arrest of her war
leaders and of highly dangerous leaders of
her fanatic secret societies;
2. T>astic reduction of the land tax, long
the perpetual wolf-at-the-door for Japan's
poverty-stricken peasantry;
3. Extension of suffrage to Japanese wom
anhood; plus a ban on the long-standing
practice of selling Japanese women into
slavery;
4. Abolition of the secret police including
a thorough reform of the police system now
under way;
5. Wiping out of the enormous economic
holdings of the Zaibatsu, Japan's industrial
giants. Her entire economic production was
con .rolled by the few family corporations
that make up this group;
6. Elimination of State Shinto, the fanati
cal politico-religion through which the Japa
nese government spread its propaganda to
every person in the nation;
7. Encouragement of labor organization,

already well under way. There have been
some 200 strikes in Japan, mostly quiet, all
partly successful, since the war ended;
8. Encouragement of all political parties
not conflicting with the terms of the Pots
dam Declaration;
9. Sweeping governmental refctrms, in
cluding a new constitution, in which the em
peror is reduced in pov/er. This change,
most radical in the constitution, takes awa '
the emperor's former prerogative by which
his word was l'aw above and beyond the lim
its and provisions of the constitution.
10. Guarantee of the right to free speech, a
free press, and free religion.
Certainly these changes could not have
been made nor carried through as they have
been if the Japanese had fought the peace as
they fought the war. Credit for at least a
docile attitude on the part of the average
Japanese toward his conquerors must go to
the Emperor; for one word from him advo
cating resistance to the Americans would
have prevented much of the good work al
ready accomplished. One word even now
might undo much of General Mac Arthur's
work. Indications show that, in spite of Jap
acceptance of Mac Arthur decrees, and in
spite of the Emperor's legal reduction from
a god-man to a mere man, the Japanese peo
ple still revere the Emperor and the Imperial
family as something superior to them that
must be preserved at all costs.
Flow long this idea will persist is a mat
ter of guesswork. On the debit side is the
fact that Hirohito increased in stature in the
eyes of many Japanese following V-J Day. On
the credit side can be counted the several
thousand liberal, socialist, and communist
elements in the country who are already
campaigning for a coalition government of
liberal elements, and who look with a dis
approving eye on the Imperial institution.
Over all this stands the nmerican military
government before whose uncompromising
eye each Japanese action must pass for hard
gained approval. It is an understanding gov
ernment, nevertheless, for Mac Arthur be
lieves that the only way the Japanese can
learn democracy is to earn it. And his job is
to help them learn.—M.S.
