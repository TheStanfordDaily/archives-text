### ELLIOTT EPSTEEN 
The British labor government is not having
good times. It promised better relations with
Russia, and it is getting worse. It promised
better times and living conditions, yet food
rationing is more strict than ever before, and,
in an effort to get credit, Britain is exporting
all of its goods and yanking them away from
the home market.
Trouble in the British colonial administra
tion is also causing a lot of worry in London.
LABOR LEADERS UNSKILLED
The unfortunate trouble of the labor gov
ernment is that its administrators are not an
skilled as the more practiced Tory leaders.
While the cabinet might stand for more pro
gressive measures than its conservative
predecessors did, the men in it are not so
adept at handling their own particular jobs.

British labor has accomplished much in
nationalizing certain fields of transport and
industry that could be handled more effi
ciently under government control. These
will probably stay nationalized, no matter
what happens in the future.
But labor, although it controls most of the
seats, got about a two million lead in the
popular vote. Tightening of controls in Eng
land, some of which is necessary and some
of which is the cause of neophyte manage
ment, might have lessened that now.
The possibility, in a short while, of a co
alition government is not probable, becauso
labor does not control so many seats.
But, if times don't improve, this period of
power might set the labor party back for
many, many years in the future.
