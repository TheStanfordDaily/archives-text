Poetry by five British and Ameri- |
can poets of the ISflO's was read ;
yesterday by Ernest Marchand, as- !
sistant professor of English, at the
weekly poetry reading.
Stephen Crane was the only |
American poet • from whom Dr.
Marchand read. Poems from j
Crane's "The Black Riders" that !
were read are: "In the desert," j
"God fashioned the ship of the i
world carefully," "I saw a man |
pursuing the horizon," "Think as I

think, said a man," "I stood musing I
in a black world," "If I should cast '
oft' this coat."
Stephen Crane Poem
Other short poems from "War Is
Kind" by Crane were also read:
"Have you ever made a just man?," '
"A slant of sun on dull brown
walls," "A man said to the uni
verse," "There was a land where !
lived no violets," and"The trees in
the garden rained flowers."
The Englishman Eugene Lee
Hamilton was an invalid who pro- I
duced most of his poetry during his
pain. From his "Sonnets of the j
Wingless Hours" Mr. Marchand
read "Eagles of Tiberius," a tribute j
to Beaudelaire, "Seashell Mur- j
murs," "Spring," the light "Obe
ron's Last Council," two sonnets
both called "The Wreck of Heaven,"
and the epilogue to the sonnets.
British Poet
From "Days and Nights" which
the author, Arthur Symons, dedi
cated to Walter Pater, Mr. Mar
chand read "The Opium Smoker,"
"The Nun," "Of Charity," "The

Fisher's Widow," "Javanese Danc
ers," and the prologue to "London
Night" entitled "Before the Cur
tain." From a later volume, "Im
ages of Good and Evil," "The Old
Women" was read.
Five longer poems by Ernest
Dowson were read: "One in Bed
lam," "Cynara," "Exile," "The Ves
per Hour," and "A Last Word." In
