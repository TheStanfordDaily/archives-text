# Journalists Plan Dance
## 
### 
If the Daily Shack and Journal
ism Building seem to be buzzing
with more activity than usual, it's
not because the Chappie has come
out. It's only Sigma Delta Chi and
Theta Sigma Phi men and women
working happily together — making
plans.
The plans are for the spring
quarter Reg Dance, sponsored by
the two honorary journalism fra
ternities and slated to hit the cam
pus on Reg night, Monday, April 1.
Included in the journalists' hopes
for campus entertainment will be
music furnished by Ray Hackett
and his orchestra (16 pieces, yet!)
with blonde Patsy Ortega holding
the vocal spotlight.
In charge of dance arrangements
is H. D. Thoreau, Sigma Delta Chi
president, with Theta Sigma Phi
members taking over the publicity
•eins.
Bids will be on sale at the Ad
Building on Reg Day and at the
door for $2 plus tax. Informality
will be the keynote of the affair,
and "delicious liquid refreshments"
will be served 10 all possessing the
required 10 cents, Thoreau said.
The only things needed to gain
entrance to the dance will be a bid
and a date, he added. "So remem
ber the time: 8:30 to 12; the place:
Pavilion; the dance: spring quarter
Reg Dance."
