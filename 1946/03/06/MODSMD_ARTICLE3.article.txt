# Churchill Attacks Communism
## 
### 
FULTON, Mo., March 5 (UP).â€”ln the presence of the Presi
dent of the United States, and in what appeared to be one of
the most carefully prepared speeches of his career, Winston
Churchill today launched a measured attack upon international
Communism and the postwar policies of Communist Russia.
At the same time, he proposed not only a militarily powerful
United Nations Organization but a military alliance between the
British Commonwealth and Empire and the United States so
close it could lead eventually to common citizenship. The Allies
and not the UNO should remain the custodian of the secrets of
atomic warfare, he specified.
Churchill seemed to divide his solemn rhetoric, which was
of its matchless wartime quality, more or less equally as regards
emphasis among three theses: (1) the affinity of the United States
and Great Britain, not only in common language and similar
democratic institutions and traditions, but in common interests;
(2) the essentiality of a powerful United Nations Organization
to enforce and maintain a hard-won peace; (3) the menace to
democratic institutions and "Christian civilization" represented
in the "expansive and proselytizing tendencies" of Soviet Rus
sia and international Communism.
