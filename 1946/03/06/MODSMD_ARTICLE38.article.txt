Right now the sports horizon is mixed with the start of the baseball
season, and the decline of basketball. Before basketball, however, com
pletely bows out, there remain the N.C.A.A. playoffs in New York the
latter part of the month. This tourney is generally regarded as the "world
series" of the hoop game.
Teams are selected by their geographic position in the United States.
The West Coast representative will be the winner of the California-Idaho
play-offs this weekend that will take place over at the Berkeley basketball
plant.
Scooting directly across the country, Duke looks to be the likely
ambassador of basketball from the South. N.Y.U.'s snappy team is a
cinch to get the Middle Atlantic bid to play at Madison Square. The
Violets have captured their last 17 out of IX games.
The New England representative is still undecided, with both Harvard
and Rhode Island State vieing for New York trip honors. Harvard has
lost only one game this season, and R.I.S. has dropped two tilts. Ohio
State, which won the honor last season, is scheduled to play under the
banner of the North Central area.
In the Missouri Valley, Oklahoma A. & M. and the Kansas Jayhawkers
will meet in a play-off to decide who treks East for the big games. Baylor,
winner of the Southwest Conference, will represent that area in N.Y., N.Y.
Wyoming is the favorite to carry the Rocky Mountain colors back Eiist.

In the mail bag today was an envelope from the War Department,
marked "Official Business." Inside wasn't what we thought it was, though,
and this writer sighed deeply, glad that civilian days are not over yet.
But what was sent was the Ardee N»ws, the semi-official weekly news
paper of the A.A.F. in the European Theater. This paper is published at
Furstenfeldbruck, Bavaria. (There are supposed to be two dots over the
"u" in Fursten —etc., but how the devil can we use those marks on this
writing machine?)
Looking at the members of the staff, we found the name of Gordon
Levy, who was sports editor of this publication last winter. Quite a
difference for "Fl Gordo," changing from the Daily to this paper, but
we're sure he's doing a swell job on the A.A.F. newspaper.

Spring football practice opens next quarter, according to Marchie
Schwartz, head football man on the Farm. He urges all students (male,
that is) to sign up for practice that have a desire to tote the pigskin for
the Red and White.
Just because you weren't mentioned as All-American caliber when ,
you performed on your high school team doesn't mean you're not of
college caliber. Some of the best college players ever turned out never
got closer to a football than a newsreel on the Army-Navy game before
they got to college.

Baseball history is being made at Sanford, Florida, where the Brooklyn
club and their farm affiliates are working out. Two Negroes, the first
signed in organized baseball, are under contract, and are going through
the paces with the other baseball players.
One player is v<pry well known to West Coast fans. He is Jackie Robin
son. who starred brilliantly at U.C.L.A. in football, basketball, track, and
baseball. The other player signed was John Wright, a pitcher.
