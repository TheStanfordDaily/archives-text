### 
CHICAGO, March 5 (UP). — Two of the largest railroad
brotherhoods in the United States will strike most of the nation's
railroads at 6 a.m. Monday, union officials reported tonight as
the government worked frantically to stave off a threatened
nationwide telephone walkout.
The strike call was reported by local officials to have been
sent out by the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen and the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, although no comment was
forthcoming from the heads of the two unions. BRT President
A. F. Whitney was not at his headguarters or home and BLE
President Alvaney Johnston said he would not comment until
noon' tomorrow.
It was expected the Railway Labor Disputes Act would be
immediately called into operation and an emergency fact-find
ing panel set up by President Truman. Under the act, strikes
usually are held in abeyance at least 30 days pending a report
by the panel.
Strikes by the two dissident brotherhoods would tie up
virtually all rail operations from coast to coast and from Canada
to Mexico. Some 300,000 trainmen and 75,000 engineers would
be affected. Only operations continuing would be by small lines
which were not included in the nationwide contract negotiations.
