# Cardinals Smash Gael Nine 11 to 3
## 
### STU MILLAR 
Starting right off with a run in j
the first inning, Stanford's varsity j
baseball nine steadily amassed a ]
commanding lead over the St. j
Mary's Gaels to take yesterday af- j
ternoon's clash on the Farm Sunken
Diamond bv the lopsided score of i
11 to 3.
Giving pitcher Phil Wolf error
less support for his sterling seven
inning stint, the Card horsehiders
did not make a mistake until the
eighth inning. And it didn't make
any difference then, for the eager
Stanford team had batted around
the inning before, six men crossing ;
the plate in the process.
But to Wolf go the Laurels for
the day. Fast Phil, keeping the
ball on the inside corner with
excellent control hurling, allowed
no runs and one hit for the seven
innings while piling up a total of
eight strikeouts.
The Gaels touched Lefty Palisoul
for their only scores in the eighth
frame when Kellenberger's error on
Galvin's double, Wedemeyer's ho
mer, a free pass, and Stanford's (of
St. Mary's, that is) double to right
scored three.
Carl Kellenberger led the nine
hit Farm attack with two singles
and a long two-base blow to left
center. Hick Ahlquist aided the
cause with a single and a double, I
but Larry Prato collected Stan
ford's longest hit when he j
smashed a triple out in the big J
seventh, a blow which incidental- j
ly accounted for two of Prato's J
three runs batted in.
Harry Wolter, Stanford coach,
was, of course, pleased with the
way his men reacted to actual game
conditions. But all he would say
was, "I'm satisfied." And so were
the few hundred fans who sat
through most of the two hour and
forty minute contest either to take j
a look at "Wedey" or to cheer on
the Stanford nine.

Starting right off with a run in j
the first inning, Stanford's varsity j
baseball nine steadily amassed a ]
commanding lead over the St. j
Mary's Gaels to take yesterday af- j
ternoon's clash on the Farm Sunken
Diamond bv the lopsided score of i
11 to 3.
Giving pitcher Phil Wolf error
less support for his sterling seven
inning stint, the Card horsehiders
did not make a mistake until the
eighth inning. And it didn't make
any difference then, for the eager
Stanford team had batted around
the inning before, six men crossing ;
the plate in the process.
But to Wolf go the Laurels for
the day. Fast Phil, keeping the
ball on the inside corner with
excellent control hurling, allowed
no runs and one hit for the seven
innings while piling up a total of
eight strikeouts.
The Gaels touched Lefty Palisoul
for their only scores in the eighth
frame when Kellenberger's error on
Galvin's double, Wedemeyer's ho
mer, a free pass, and Stanford's (of
St. Mary's, that is) double to right
scored three.
Carl Kellenberger led the nine
hit Farm attack with two singles
and a long two-base blow to left
center. Hick Ahlquist aided the
cause with a single and a double, I
but Larry Prato collected Stan
ford's longest hit when he j
smashed a triple out in the big J
seventh, a blow which incidental- j
ly accounted for two of Prato's J
three runs batted in.
Harry Wolter, Stanford coach,
was, of course, pleased with the
way his men reacted to actual game

was, "I'm satisfied." And so were

Starting right off with a run in j
the first inning, Stanford's varsity j
baseball nine steadily amassed a ]
commanding lead over the St. j
Mary's Gaels to take yesterday af- j
ternoon's clash on the Farm Sunken
Diamond bv the lopsided score of i
11 to 3.
Giving pitcher Phil Wolf error
less support for his sterling seven
inning stint, the Card horsehiders
did not make a mistake until the
eighth inning. And it didn't make
any difference then, for the eager
Stanford team had batted around
the inning before, six men crossing ;
the plate in the process.
But to Wolf go the Laurels for
the day. Fast Phil, keeping the
ball on the inside corner with
excellent control hurling, allowed
no runs and one hit for the seven
innings while piling up a total of
eight strikeouts.
The Gaels touched Lefty Palisoul
for their only scores in the eighth
frame when Kellenberger's error on
Galvin's double, Wedemeyer's ho
mer, a free pass, and Stanford's (of
St. Mary's, that is) double to right
scored three.
Carl Kellenberger led the nine
hit Farm attack with two singles
and a long two-base blow to left
center. Hick Ahlquist aided the
cause with a single and a double, I
but Larry Prato collected Stan
ford's longest hit when he j
smashed a triple out in the big J
seventh, a blow which incidental- j
ly accounted for two of Prato's J
three runs batted in.
Harry Wolter, Stanford coach,
was, of course, pleased with the
way his men reacted to actual game
conditions. But all he would say
was, "I'm satisfied." And so were
the few hundred fans who sat
through most of the two hour and
forty minute contest either to take j
a look at "Wedey" or to cheer on
the Stanford nine.
