TYLER HALL (Special to the
Daily).â€”Hoff has just announced
that Sigma Nu's will play Sig
ma Chi's in a basketball game
tonight for a keg of "buttermilk."
IlofV, who is public relations
agent for the Sigma Nu's, confi
dently predicted that his team
would overwhelm the opposition
with a barrage of baskets, the like
of which has never been seen.
In fact, Hoff likes to compare
the Sigma Nu basketball live with
the Kansas City Smokies, K.C.'s
representative in the A.A.U. cir
cuit.
