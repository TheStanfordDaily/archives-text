Mentioning the importance to the
Orient of the Philippines' inde
pendence, which will become a fact
July 4 of this year, William V. Ward
showed his Tuesday Series audi
ence last night the colored fdms he
took of the island archipelago be
fore the war.
Mr. Ward's program—lecture and
film—hung together by the thread
of the undeniable beauty of the
scenes he photographed—the half
familiar piercing blue skies, spar
kling bays, and omnipresent palms.
The Ward-styled "Pearl of the
Orient" is similar to California in
much of its topography, although
Mr. Ward gave the impression
that the Philippine waterfalls,
crater lakes, flowers, and stand
ard of living are not quite up to
the California waterfalls, crater
lakes, flowers, and standard of
living.
Manila is a very "modern" city
with its gay neon lights and busy
traffic. The Americans, "the top
layer" of the Philippines' three lay

ers of civilization, brought ''.sanita
tion and education." Also appar
ently aiding the modernization of
Manila were the American artillery
which destroyed an ancient wall
and leveled the famous flame trees
of Manila, and the American air
force which blasted a Spanish
church which the Japanese were
using as an ammunition dump, in
the liberation of the city.
Bored with bis ollice job in Ma
nila. Mr. Ward, Stanford '.'l4, took
a steamer south through the is
lands to Zamhoanga where "the
monkeys have no tails" accord
ing to a former resident of the
Philippines now attending Stan
ford. In Zamhoanga on Mindanao
Mr. Ward found the scenery more
colorful than anywhere else he
visited—orchids, mariposas, Chi
nese lotus, and water lilies grow
profusely around the huts of the
primitive Moros.
One of the oldest features of the
Philippines and the most interesting
and unusual photographically were
the acres of rice terraces, 2,000
years old, cultivated by the natives
of Baguio.
Albert W. C. T. Herre, curator
of ichthyology, who introduced Mr.
Ward, announced that the last in
the winter quarter Tuesday Series
will be a talk next week on the
American University at Shriven
ham, England, by Willis Johnson
and Douglas Whitaker of the Bio

Mentioning the importance to the
Orient of the Philippines' inde
pendence, which will become a fact
July 4 of this year, William V. Ward
showed his Tuesday Series audi
ence last night the colored fdms he
took of the island archipelago be
fore the war.
Mr. Ward's program—lecture and
film—hung together by the thread
of the undeniable beauty of the
scenes he photographed—the half
familiar piercing blue skies, spar
kling bays, and omnipresent palms.
The Ward-styled "Pearl of the
Orient" is similar to California in
much of its topography, although
Mr. Ward gave the impression
that the Philippine waterfalls,
crater lakes, flowers, and stand
ard of living are not quite up to
the California waterfalls, crater
lakes, flowers, and standard of
living.
Manila is a very "modern" city
with its gay neon lights and busy
traffic. The Americans, "the top
layer" of the Philippines' three lay

ers of civilization, brought ''.sanita
tion and education." Also appar
ently aiding the modernization of
Manila were the American artillery
which destroyed an ancient wall
and leveled the famous flame trees
of Manila, and the American air
force which blasted a Spanish
church which the Japanese were
using as an ammunition dump, in
the liberation of the city.
Bored with bis ollice job in Ma
nila. Mr. Ward, Stanford '.'l4, took
a steamer south through the is
lands to Zamhoanga where "the
monkeys have no tails" accord
ing to a former resident of the
Philippines now attending Stan
ford. In Zamhoanga on Mindanao
Mr. Ward found the scenery more
colorful than anywhere else he
visited—orchids, mariposas, Chi
nese lotus, and water lilies grow
profusely around the huts of the
primitive Moros.
