### 
WASHINGTON, March 5 (UP).â€”
The Spanish government repudi-
I atcd the tri-power appeal to over
throw the Franco regime before it
ever was made. Secretary of State
James F. Byrnes disclosed today.
Observers believed the repudiation
; opened the way for France to bring
! the issue before the UNO Security
! Council.
The government of Generalissimo
Francisco Franco delivered a note
to the United States Sunday in
1 which it said, "Spain repudiates any
' foreign pressure put upon her,"
i Byrnes revealed.
Spain told the other nations to
mind their own business 24 hours
before they made their direct ap
peal to the Spanish people to over
throw the Franco dictatorship.
Barring unexpected develop
| ment.s, France probably will go
through with her plan to give the
J Franco matter a UNO airing.
