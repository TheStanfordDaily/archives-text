# Electronics Talk Tonight
## 
### 
Dr. F. E. Terman, dean of the
School of Engineering, will give a
talk this evening on "Electronic
Warfare" at 7:30 in Cubberley Au
ditorium.
The lecture will be illustrated by
slides and a sound film, "Radar
Countermeasures," which was pro
duced during the war for the pur
pose of explaining countermeasure
developments to high staff officers
in the armed forces.
Dr. Terman organized and di
rected the Radio Research Labora
tory at Harvard University which
produced practically all the radar
coujitermeasures. Some of the re
sults of the efforts were a 75 per
cent reduction in the effectiveness
of German anti-aircraft fire, Ger
man confusion on D-Day by ra
dar countermeasures which feinted
much of their strength out of posi
tion, and compulsion of the Ger
mans and Japs to discontinue using
their radar in latter stages of the
war.
