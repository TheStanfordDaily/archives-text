"Students of Chinese ancestry at
the University of California, Stan
ford. and the University of Wash
ington protest the Russian occupa
tion of Manchuria," said Martha
Tway, Stanford graduate student, at
the meeting of the Chinese AfTairs
Discussion Group Monday.
A group of students of Chinese
ancestry from these three univrsi
ties have prepared a public state
ment of their views and have sent
copies of this statement to Ciiine.se
ancestry from these three universi
ties; to the Central News Agency in
Chungking; to "Ta Kung Pao," an
important liberal-independent Chi
nese newspaper in Shanghai; and
to the Chinese government.
"Six months have passed since
the Japanese surrender," said
Miss Twa.v. "hut the Northeastern
Provinces (Manchuria) arc still
occupied by Russian forces. The
Russians are reported to have set
up more electrical installations in
this region, almost all the factory

machinery and equipment has
been taken over by the Russians,
and the railroads arc controlled
by them and cannot he used by
Chinese authorities."
Miss Tway pointed out that plun
j der and murder cases have been rc
j ported committed by Russians, val
ueless military currency is being
I circulated by them, and that five
1 Chinese officials were recently
j murdered while on their way to in-
I spect the Fushan coal mines in the
I Russian-garrisoned area.
Miss Tway continued that ac
cording to this declaration, these
students are pledged to support
the present patriotic movement of
the Chinese students in Chung
king by making the following rc
' quests:
1. Russia must strictly observe
the Sino-Soviet agreement; any un- 1
reasonable demand beyond the pro
visions of the treaty will be re
jected.
2. Immediate withdrawal of Rus
sian forces from the Northeastern
Provinces of China.
3. Machinery and other materials
looted by the Russians in the i
Northeastern Provinces should be j
immediately handed back in toto, or I
recompensated in value.
4. An internationally organized j
Inquiry Mission should be sent to I
the Northeastern Provinces to in
vestigate the details of the atroci
ties and persecution by the Rus
sians and to mete out proper and
effective punishment to the guilty
individuals.
Miss Tway, continuing her news
digest, mentioned a public state
ment made by Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek on February 25 in

which he told the Chinese public
that China has no desire to sacrifice
her sovereignty in Manchuria.
"While the Chinese officials are op
timistic about a satisfactory con
clusion to the Manehurian situa
tion," Miss Tway added, "the Chi
nese civilians are pessimistic."
Nine foreign correspondents,
allowed for the first time to enter
Manehuria on February 18, were
permitted to question Mukden's
Russian commandant. Major Gen
eral Andrei Kovtoun-Stankevitch.
Said Miss Tway, ''Their most re
vealing bits of information on
Manchuria are answers to their
questions thrown at the General's
interpreter:
"Q. 'When do you plan to evacu
ate?'
*'A. "The General says, if he is
ordered to evacuate he will evacu
ate.'
"Q. 'Does Russia consider Man
churian industry war booty?'
"A. 'The General says according
to the decision of the Big Three we
could not. leave it to her, so it hap
pens that sonic has been taken out.'
"Q. 'What Big Three decision?'
"A. 'The General says Yalta or
Berlin—it might be cither.'
"Q. 'Were the machines taken to
Russia?'
"A. 'The General says perhaps.'"
The Chinese News Service, which
furnishes the Discussion Group
with information on current affairs,
stated that the present Manchurian
situation is not an internal prob
lem alone. To solve it, they indi
cated, the diplomatic situation must
first of all be qualified and clarified.
Chinese sovereignty must first be
restored.
