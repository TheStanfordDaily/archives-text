# No Draft---Rogers

### VIC MINAHAN 
"If the United States Army re
j forms itself and becomes truly dem
ocratic, there will be no need for
peacetime conscription."
With those words Will Rogers,
Jr., European war veteran and
candidate for United States Sena
tor, last night took his place in the
opposition to the Administration's
compulsory military training plan.
Speaking before an audience of
600 in the Palo Alto High School Au
ditorium, Mr. Rogers scored the
Army for its "caste system" and de
clared that "one college (West Point)
is not enough to supply all the im
portant military leaders of the coun
try."
Suggests Reforms
Basing his suggestions on the as
i sumption that U. S. forces will have
j to stay in Germany at least 25 years
I and Japan at least 50 years, Rogers
j listed reforms which he said were
j necessary to make the Army attrac
j tive to young men in the future.
These reforms included identi
| cal uniforms, quarters and eating
! facilities for officers and men, and
a provision that enlisted men serve
on court martial hoards.
"The idea that a man must be
! forced into the United States Army
1 is a concept that I think is bad," the
speaker stated. "I would like to see
the Army attract young men, and
competc with private industry for
their services. This can only be done

if the Army is truly democratic."
Large Army Unnecessary
Mr. Rogers also expressed his
doubt that the United States will
ever need a large Army again to in
sure its defense. The atomic bomb
and other military innovations have
created a situation where an army
of 100,000 highly trained special
ists may eventually be sufficient, he I
said.
Rogers quoted Dr. Robert Mil- ;
likan, atomic bomb researcher, as
saying that "the nation with the
greatest military power will he
the "nation with the greatest num
ber of college graduates."
In speaking of the need for world
cooperation, Rogers emphasized that
the United States now has more mil
itary power than lias been concen
trated in one nation since the Roman
Empire.
Leadership Responsibility
' This power brings with it respon- I
sibility of world leadership," he said, j
Rogers also stated his opinion
that "if the U. S. and Russia do
not go to war, there will never be j
a third World War."
Rogers' speech was presented by
the Palo Alto-Stanford Chapter of
the American Veterans Committee.
Mr. Rogers announced that he was a
member of AVC, and that he be
lieved it is "unquestionably going to
be the outstanding veterans outfit
from this war."
