curb on the right of workers to
strike in utilities which affect pub

Bcirnc said "nothing short of a
miracle" could forestall the walkout.

if AT&T considered all pending wage
disputes as a single case and agreed
to apply any wage pattern devel
oped to all disputes "subject only to
local variations."

hope for a compromise settlement, j
The walkout, involves 250,000
workers and will blackout all long

gradually to newswires, radio broarl- |
casting hookups and mechanized ,
equipment such as local dial phones. I
