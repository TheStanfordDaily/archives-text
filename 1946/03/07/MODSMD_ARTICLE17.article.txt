## 
### 
TOKYO, March 6 (UP). —Gen.

for submission to the Japanese peo
ple a new democratic constitution
which would outlaw war, reduce
the Emperor to the status of a cere
monial figurehead, and abolish Ja
pan's feudal governmental system.
Japan would maintain no military
forces.
The proposed constitution was
drafted by Premier Kijuro Shi
dehara's Japanese cabinet and in
directly sponsored by Emperor
Hirohito. It was given Mac A
rthur's "full approval" as a "new
and enlightened" instrument plac
ing sovereignty "squarely in the
hands of (he people."
The draft constitution would for
ever abolish Japan's right to go to
war, renounce the use of force in
international disputes, and forbid
maintenance of any armed forces.
It would strip Hirohito of the
vast powers under which he ruled
wartime Japan, leaving him only
! "a symbol of the people's unity"
; and "severing for all time the
I shackles of feudalism" the su-
J preme Allied commander said in
his announcement.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Wataru
Narahashi said the revised consti
i tution would be submitted for ap
| proval to the new Diet after the
April 10 elections in which the Jap
| anese people, voting on a basis of
universal suffrage, will choose rep
resentatives to their first postwar
parliament. Diet debate on the con
stitution was expec ted to begin May
10.
Under the proposed constitu
tion the Diet would have com
plete control of the governmental
purse strings, and would he able
I to topple any cabinet with a vote
of "no confidence"—a prerogative
denied the old Diet.
Supreme judicial power would
{ reside in the people, since the ap
pointment of Supreme Court judges
would have to be ratified by the
electorate at the first general elec
tion following their appointment,
and again after a lapse of 10 years.
Masujiro Okana, vice-minister of
the imperial household department,
described as "utterly without foun
dation" the recurrence of rumors
that Hirohito plans to abdicate.

TOKYO, March 6 (UP). —Gen.
Douglas Mac Arthur today approved
for submission to the Japanese peo
ple a new democratic constitution
which would outlaw war, reduce
the Emperor to the status of a cere
monial figurehead, and abolish Ja
pan's feudal governmental system.
Japan would maintain no military
forces.
The proposed constitution was
drafted by Premier Kijuro Shi
dehara's Japanese cabinet and in
directly sponsored by Emperor
Hirohito. It was given Mac A
rthur's "full approval" as a "new
and enlightened" instrument plac
ing sovereignty "squarely in the
hands of (he people."
The draft constitution would for
ever abolish Japan's right to go to
war, renounce the use of force in
international disputes, and forbid
maintenance of any armed forces.
It would strip Hirohito of the
vast powers under which he ruled
wartime Japan, leaving him only
! "a symbol of the people's unity"
; and "severing for all time the
I shackles of feudalism" the su-
J preme Allied commander said in
his announcement.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Wataru
Narahashi said the revised consti
i tution would be submitted for ap
| proval to the new Diet after the
April 10 elections in which the Jap
| anese people, voting on a basis of
universal suffrage, will choose rep
resentatives to their first postwar
parliament. Diet debate on the con
stitution was expec ted to begin May
10.
Under the proposed constitu
tion the Diet would have com
plete control of the governmental
purse strings, and would he able
I to topple any cabinet with a vote
of "no confidence"—a prerogative
denied the old Diet.
Supreme judicial power would
{ reside in the people, since the ap
pointment of Supreme Court judges
would have to be ratified by the
electorate at the first general elec
tion following their appointment,
and again after a lapse of 10 years.
Masujiro Okana, vice-minister of
the imperial household department,
described as "utterly without foun
dation" the recurrence of rumors
that Hirohito plans to abdicate.
