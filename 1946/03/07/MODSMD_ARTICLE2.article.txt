# Yacht Races For Spring Approved
## 
### 
Yacht racing on Lake Lagunita
spring quarter for Palo Alto boats
was okayed at Excom's final win
ter quarter meeting last night, in
answer to the request of the Palo
Alio Yacht Club which customarily
holds its races in the harbor.
The Student Association for
Atomic Control enlarged its plat
form to support the founding of a
world federation, believing, from
its study of the bomb, that adequate
control can only be achieved
through a government above na
tional sovereignty. Excom approved
the constitutional change.
No formal requirement for pa
trons iÂ»t firesides was the reported
wish of the students to their Ex
com representatives, as resident as
sistants were considered competent
chaperons. Excom agreed that any
move for additional supervision
should come from the students
themselves, and no further action
was taken.
A Sports Committee co-ordinat
ing the men's and women's physical
education departments was sug
gested by Student Manager B. J.
Calfee for Excom approval. Such
a committee, she explained, would
spread the faculty responsibility
and department expense for spon
sorship of student athletic clubs.
Rugby, which in 1943 became a
major sport, was relegated to the
ranks of minor teams by Excom
action, wilh the award of Circle
Block S to its players instead of the
coveted Block S.
