# Showdown Approaches
## 
### 
At last the United States has joined Great
Britain in demanding a showdown with Rus
sia on two guestions weighing heavily on the
diplomatic balance scale.
Secretary of State James F. Byrnes an
nounced that the State Department has sent
two messages to Moscow: one referring to
the. continued presence of Soviet troops in
Iran after the March 2 withdrawal dead line;
ih- other to Russian troops and activities in
Manchuria, for which the Chinese foreign
miiiJilei said Tuesday the USSR had given
his government no satisfactory reason.
Besides cleaning up some remnants of
Axis backyards—Aigentina, Spain—the Big
Three have finally come around to facing the
facts that there are messes in their own front
yards that have to be dealt with using the
came measure of firmness and responsibility.
Whether a pseudo-solution of those prob
lems will be made through power deals, or
an honest approach to them will be made

through the proper channels of the UNO, re
mains to be seen.
Our move in demanding answers from the
Soviet Union may be the first in a series that
will result in a stronger United States policy
in the UNO Security Council meetings, tak
ing the place of our former and often indefi
nite actions as an intermediary.
The plain facts are that we cannot with
conscience ignore any of the claims of the
small peoples that come before us; whether
they be of nationalists demanding independ
ence, or of a country reporting infringement
on its rights by another. We have come this
far along the road to permanent peace hold
ing our ideals as banners while aping the
compromises of the League of Nations.
We are now committed to a new kind of
rugged diplomacy, which must be bolstered
by a powerful UNO, if it is to work. And it
must be made to work, for we know what
may loom in a future that has lost the peace.
