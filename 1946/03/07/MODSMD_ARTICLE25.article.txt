# CAMPUS OPINION

To (he Editor and die Stanford "Family":
Do you know why many girls came to Stan
ford? Their parents took into account not only the
curriculum but the fact that their children would
be in good hands. Why there were excellent living
conditions and a "well-regulated" system of lock
out . Yes, Stanford does take care of its women.
As a splendid example there are the house
roc lings held a few nights ago; there girls were
warned for the umpteenth time since the four years
many of us have been here, not to travel alone
any place out of the way on campus at any time,
isn't it about time to recognize that a very
serious condition exists on campus, and that it is
time to do something more than just helpfully
warn the girls? For •instance, this campus is
shamefully lighted, and it could be much better
policed, with a larger stall". After all, aren't the
police to protect th*» rights of the private citizen?
One and sometimes two policemen on the ram
liii.'f . widespread Farm are not humanly capable
of Ik ing everywhere at once.
'i lie Administration would seem to have the
power to ask for a stronger policing of the cam
pus; the students, if this plea gets no results, could
inform their parents and attempt to get some pres
sure applied through the alumni and the mothers'

clubs. This is not an exaggerated proposition; if
there were a crime wave in Palo Alto, you can
be sure that the policing of that city would be
strengthened.
Closely allied with this is the fact that Lagu
nita is the only women's dorm on campus where
a girl can wait anywhere from live to twenty
minutes late at night for the door to be opened,
while the night matron is making her rounds,
checking doors and windows. What good does it
do for a person to be warned about dangerous
persons if she is forced to stand outside for that
length of time, and when no one could possibly
save her if she were absolutely alone—which is
often the case?
It would seem logical that the "protective de
partment" of Stanford would see that Lagunita had
an extra night assistant and that the campus was
more than adequately policed during this emer
gency,
After all, it would be better to take preventive
measures now than to wait until a really serious
"accident" occurred, and Stanford's name was
dragged through the mud for gross negligence of
the welfare of its students.
Sincerely,
Lois Williams
