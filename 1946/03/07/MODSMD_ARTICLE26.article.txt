### H.D. THOREAU 
Contrary to rumors, Ingrid Bergman did not
come down to Leland Stanford with the St. Mary's
baseball team Tuesday afternoon. None of the
belles travel with the horsehiders.

Jn connection with the spring quarter Reg
Dance, we'd like you to hear what "The Jazz Rec
ord Book" has to say about Bobby Hackett:
"Ever since being dubbed 'Another Young
Man with a Horn,' Bobby Hackett's talent has
been compared to Bix, the fans forgetting that
( tis Ferguson began that particular title with
the word Another. For outside of an admira
tion which impelled Hackett to work for a clear
mellow tone, and to employ lead-in notes to
phrases, as Bix used to do. the comparison ends.
Kix's forte was imagination. Hackett's is inven
tiveness."
We hope you haven't forgotten Otis.
But seriously, fans, Hackett is one of the finest

eorn?tists extant. Although he has done some re
cording with his own band, Hackett's best-known
work is with Eddie Condon's Windy City Seven
with George Brunies, Pee Wee Russell, Bud Free
man, Jess Stacy, Condon, Artie Shapiro, and
George Wettling.
Now these men were not able to make the Reg
Dance date, but it will be a fine affair anyhow.

All of you who remember the newsboy's right
shoulder on the cover of the Jrune 1942 Chapar
ral will want to study the cover on next week's
issue very carefully.
If the rest of you will hold the magazine under
a violet lamp similar to the one the cops use to
keep people from crashing dances, you will see
what we refer to.
The Chappie, incidentally, this year should do
quite well in the proposed Esquire First Annual
College Humor Magazine Contest.
