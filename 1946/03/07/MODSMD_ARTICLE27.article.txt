### ELLIOTT EPSTEEN 
Former Prime Minister Winston Churchill pro
posed an alliance between Britain and America,
lio said a lot cjf other things, but, in essence, he
seemed to think that the solution to our relations
with Russia was to have more guns than they do.
If America lapses into isolation and disarma
ment, Russia will have the international field to
herself. The Russians have not exactly shown
themselves inclined to use their military power
with very much respect for weaker hut disagre
ahle countries, so Britain and her neighbors, per
haps out of fear, would probably ally, and the
road to World War 111 would be well traversed.
ALLIANCE
Yet, if Britain and America were to stand to
gether and have a firm policy, Russia would face
more than she could cope with.
If we were to tell Stalin that he could do what
he pleased within the ethnographic "limits of the
Soviet Union, he would not attack us, because
he would most certainly be trading large and im
portant power for disaster and nothing.
The atomic bomb would accentuate rather than
endanger this effect if it were distributed through
out the worlil. On this point, we must disagree
with Mr. Churchill.
ATOM AGGRESSION USELESS
No aggressor would attack another nation if he

thought all he would get out of it was a pile of
rubble and a burnt-out space where his industrial
centers had been. Nobody would shoot first in
imagined self-defense if he thought everything he
wai fighting to preserve would be blown to pieces.
Power politics is not something negative, but
dynamically positive. Each player is first out Co
preserve what lie can, and second, to commit as
much robbery as he can get away with at a profit.
This has been international relations since time
immemorial, and there is nothing that is hap
pening in the UNO to make anybody think it has
changed.
LAST ROBBER
The only big robber baron in operation now is
named Joe Stalin. We might be able to reason with
him, to limit production of atom bombs and ban
conscription. We have nothing to lose by trying.
But if our overtures fail, if reason is useless,
then the only tiling we can do is approach the
problem from a standpoint of stop lobbing or lose
everything. The first way is the preferable one,
but only by the second can we stop a third world
war if the first fails.
Mr. Churchill was right on his idea of military
alliance, but that, right now, is an extreme step.
Yet, if everything else tried to preserve peace fails,
the fact must be faced that the step must be taken.
