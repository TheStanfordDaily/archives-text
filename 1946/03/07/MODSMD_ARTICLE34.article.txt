The Farm squad has achieved a
won 1 lost 2 record thus far. They
dropped their first two games to
teams representing the Olympic Club
and Menlo. However, in their last
contest the boys looked much better

fast material-
The Cards knocked off a sharp
Petaluma club, sparked by several
members of the football team who
