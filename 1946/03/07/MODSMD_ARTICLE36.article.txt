It was a pleasure the other after
noon to watch Stanford pound out a
victory over St. Mary's, in their ini
tial baseball contest of the season.
More wins like that will once again
bring Stanford up to their proper
stature in the sports horizon.
Pitcher Phil Wolf looked partic
ularly good for tlu- Indians. His
effective control, plus his coolness,
went a long way to bring home
victory Tuesday afternoon.
Another baseball game is sched
uled this Saturday afternoon at 2:30
against the San Mateo Independ
ents. The game will be played in
the Sunken Diamond. Admission is
zero cents.

Apparently Tony Lupien heeded
our advice of last wee I#, when we
said he would he a heck of a lot
better off reporting to the Holly
wood Stars, instead of bickering
with the Phillies about the legal
ity of his sale to the J'acific Coast
team. The UP ticker informs us
that Mr. Lupien is still protest
ing the whole deal, hut will head
West, and play baseball this sea
son with the not-so-bright Stars
of Hollywood.

Connie Mack's Philadelphia A's
went through a nine-inning squad
workout, with the scoring ending,
0-0. This game confirmed Mr.
Mack's suspicions that he would
have a weak-hitting team this sea
son.
Pat Mullin, a heavy Detroit Tiger
swatter before he hurt his shoulder
in 1941, is apparently back in shape
again, for he has been whipping the
pellet around with great vigor in
spring training, and might land a
regular spot on the World Series
champions of last season.
Rivalry for the first base position
on the St. Louis Cardinals is so
heated, that last year's regular, Ray
Sanders, has refused to pose for pic
tures with rookie Dick Sisler.

A ping pong tournament be
tween Tyler Hall and Toyon was
played a few nights ago. It is the
sad duty of this reporter to re
port that Tyler went down to ig
noble defeat, although the Hill
toppers fought valiantly. Tyler
players, who are obviously unable
to practice more because of heavy
studying, did show sparks of great
playing, and before long, the boys
will be able to whip all oncomers.
Captain of the team. Noble I).
Barry, looked particularly fine in
his matches, thank you.

Our basketball writer made a mis
take in yesterday's Daily, when he
stated the Sigma Nu-Sigma Chi
basketball game would be played
last night. Hoff, in a burst of out
rage. phoned this office, and the talk
was so heated, the telephone receiv
er almost melted. But pretty soon
Hoff cooled down, and after a little
persuasion, he decided to call off the
law suit for $100,000. Hoff, however,
would like it to be known to all that
the game will be played Saturday
morning. (The game will not be
broadcast nationally.)

Connie Mack's Philadelphia A's
went through a nine-inning squad
workout, with the scoring ending,
0-0. This game confirmed Mr.
Mack's suspicions that he would
have a weak-hitting team this sea
son.
Pat Mullin, a heavy Detroit Tiger
swatter before he hurt his shoulder
in 1941, is apparently back in shape
again, for he has been whipping the
pellet around with great vigor in
spring training, and might land a
regular spot on the World Series
champions of last season.
Rivalry for the first base position
on the St. Louis Cardinals is so
heated, that last year's regular, Ray
Sanders, has refused to pose for pic
tures with rookie Dick Sisler.

A ping pong tournament be
tween Tyler Hall and Toyon was
played a few nights ago. It is the
sad duty of this reporter to re
port that Tyler went down to ig
noble defeat, although the Hill
toppers fought valiantly. Tyler
players, who are obviously unable
to practice more because of heavy
studying, did show sparks of great
playing, and before long, the boys
will be able to whip all oncomers.
Captain of the team. Noble I).
Barry, looked particularly fine in
his matches, thank you.

Our basketball writer made a mis
take in yesterday's Daily, when he
stated the Sigma Nu-Sigma Chi
basketball game would be played
last night. Hoff, in a burst of out
rage. phoned this office, and the talk
was so heated, the telephone receiv
er almost melted. But pretty soon
Hoff cooled down, and after a little
persuasion, he decided to call off the
law suit for $100,000. Hoff, however,
would like it to be known to all that
the game will be played Saturday
morning. (The game will not be
broadcast nationally.)
It was a pleasure the other after
noon to watch Stanford pound out a
victory over St. Mary's, in their ini
tial baseball contest of the season.
More wins like that will once again
bring Stanford up to their proper
stature in the sports horizon.
Pitcher Phil Wolf looked partic
ularly good for tlu- Indians. His
effective control, plus his coolness,
went a long way to bring home
victory Tuesday afternoon.
Another baseball game is sched
uled this Saturday afternoon at 2:30
against the San Mateo Independ
ents. The game will be played in
the Sunken Diamond. Admission is
zero cents.

our advice of last wee I#, when we
said he would he a heck of a lot
better off reporting to the Holly

with the Phillies about the legal

team. The UP ticker informs us
that Mr. Lupien is still protest
