# Cardinal Baseballers To Meet San Mateo
## 
### STU MILLAR 
San Mateo's Independents, a team
of no little merit, will face Harry
Wolter's baseballers on the Sunken
Diamond this Saturday afternoon at
2:30 p.m. Admission to the contest
will be free.
The Independents won their Bay
Region winter league champion
ship and should obviously be in

condition. Mostly composed of
young, hustling, sand-lotters, San
Mateo will provide the Card nine's
last competition until spring vaca
tion when it will journey south to
meet UCLA and L'SC in ollicial
league competition.
The schedule listed today does not
include the rest of the games Stan
ford will play this spring, for they
are not league contests. At least
one more with St. Mary's and a pair
with Santa Clara are on the fire for
the month of April.
The horsehide picture has cleared
considerably now that the Indians
have taken their first early season
game from St. Mary's since 1937. Of
course there are still obvious weak
nesses in the roster.
A few additions to the squad can
he expected after spring registra
tion, hut, according to advance in
formation, there are no prospective
hurlers entering. Right now the
only pitcher who is definite start
ing material is Phil Wolf. Dick
Flatland, who has been working
out with the team, is ineligible.
Next best flinger is Lefty Palisoul
who gave up three runs in his two
inning St. Mary's job. Although he
has improved since he came out,
Palisoul still does not measure up
to the caliber of competition that
Stanford will face in the next few
months. Ray Winterhalter will be
tried on the mound in the next few
days and will be shifted there if he
shows any potential ability.
But someone will have to come
up; the Indians are scheduled to
play four games in five days down
south in a few weeks. And Wolf
isn't that kind of an iron-man. At
the moment the infield is the
strongest part of the Stanford
team. It functioned errorlcssly
against the Gaels. Miller, under
the supervision of Ray Hammet,
is developing quickly at first.
Howard and Peters work well as a
keystone combination. Larry Pra
to is a sure bet to stick on the
hot corner.
A few changes are planned in the
outfield. Carl Kellenberger will be
moved to center field because of his
speed and Jim Wickersham will shift
to left. George Sloat will be giving
Jim Dooley stiff competition for the
right field berth.
