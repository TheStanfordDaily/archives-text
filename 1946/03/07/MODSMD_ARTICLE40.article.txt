# Farm Gymnasts Take On Bears
## 
### "MUSSLES" PASCOE 
The Stanford gymnastics men open
the intercollegiate season when they
; make their debut against the Golden
Bears from up Berkeley way. Pos
sessing only a small nucleus of
stars the local boys will be hard
pressed to walk away with the meet
because of the lack of reserve ma
teriel but should take the bunting
| in several of the events.
The confab will start at 2 p.m. this
Saturday in the Berkeley apparatus
I room. With the Pacific Coast play
' offs in casaba ball being played that
! night, there should be added incen
tive to watch the Redmen perform
against the friendly enemies.
Coach Hunt's muscle men will be
led by Carl Van Dorn, a one-man
I virtuoso. Van Dorn will perform in
the rope climb, parallel bars, tum
| bline. horizontal bar, and the all
around event. Van Dorn has a time
of 7 seconds flat for the rope climb
which should bring home the bacon
for the Indians in that event.
Other star performers are Larry
; Ainsworth and Warren Stewart.
Ainsworth cavorts on the rings and
1 has shown great ability and promise
; up to date and should do all right
| for himself. Strongman Stewart will
! perform on the parallel and horizon
; tal bars, on the still rings, and in
the free exercise event. Stewart
I should also pick up some points for
| the Redmen.
, Another potential point winner is
! Johnny Brimer, who works out in
i the tumbling event. Just recently
; having joined the squad. Brimer has
looked good with his varied rou
tines. Also joining with Brimer in
1 this event are Beck, Cooper, Scott,
and the fore-mentioned Van Dorn.
Don Paul will lend his talents to
the squad, performing in the side
; horse and long horse. Teammate
Bob Chennell will combine with Paul
I in these events to give Stanford a
good representation on these appara
tuses.
Another Stanford aspirant is
I Chennell, who will work out on the
parallel and horizontal bars and the
still rings, in addition to his per
) formance on the horses.
In spite of their showing in the
| informal get-together with the
Olympic Club, don't count this small
I group of gymnasts out in this tradi
! tional clash. If things go l ight they
! may very well upset the apple cart.
