# 'Topper' Film Ends Series
## 
### 
Featured on the final Farm Films
program of the winter quarter this
Sunday is "Topper Takes a Trip,"
the cinema adaptation of Thorne
Smith's novel about a couple of
part-time extra - terrestrial spirits
who make a habit of bedeviling
Topper, a mere mortal. The movie
stars are Constance Bennett and
Roland Young.
Patty Whittemore, chairman of
the series, has announced that, in
order not to cause any more lost
sleep than is absolutely necessary
during spring vacation, the con
cluding chapters of the current
cliff-hanger, "Overland Mail." will
be shown.
The place is Memorial Hal! at
7:30 Sunday night. Admission is
20 cents to Stanford students, fac
ulty, and staff.
