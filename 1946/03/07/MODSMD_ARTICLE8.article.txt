Opera Thought Kiddle
Of "The Magic Flute," Warren
| D. Allen, professor of music, says
that "the opera will seem very
l strange to all but a few people in
(his community. For many years
| it was a riddle, even to critics of
alleged ability. Since the Metro
politan Opera Company has given
its blessing to a good Fnglish ver
! sion, however, the story and li
i brctto are very much clcarcr."
Dr. Allen continues to say that
| "there never has been any confu
sion over the music: the songs are
so tuneful, the choruses so impos
j ing, the ensembles so witty, the
! dance music so lilting, that the op
era has lived in spite of the seem
-1 ing 'hodgepodge' of characters and
I book."

Opera Thought Kiddle
Of "The Magic Flute," Warren
| D. Allen, professor of music, says
that "the opera will seem very
l strange to all but a few people in
(his community. For many years
| it was a riddle, even to critics of
alleged ability. Since the Metro
politan Opera Company has given
its blessing to a good Fnglish ver
! sion, however, the story and li
i brctto are very much clcarcr."
Dr. Allen continues to say that
| "there never has been any confu
sion over the music: the songs are
so tuneful, the choruses so impos
j ing, the ensembles so witty, the
! dance music so lilting, that the op
era has lived in spite of the seem
-1 ing 'hodgepodge' of characters and
I book."
