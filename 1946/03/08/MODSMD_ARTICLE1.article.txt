# "Magic Flute" Rated Success
## 
### 
"The Magic Flute" opened its ttfree-day run last night, and may be
stamped at once as an unqualified success. This production, probablry the
most ambitious ever attempted in the Auditorium since its construction,
had to struggle under the burden of one of the worst librettos ever written,
and yet it sent an amazed and thoroughly satisfied audience streaming out
after a satisfying number of curtain calls for the deserving principals.

► The entire cast was free from the
i affliction of operatic singers, that
i of twisting the mouth into bizarre
j shapes; the result was that every
i one, and I mean everyone, could be
j clearly understood, even in the bal-
I cony. Will wonders never cease!
One of the main advantages of
I this clear diction was that it at last
■ revealed the vintage of some of
Bob Hope's favorite wheezes (i.e.,
"These women couldn't be beauti
ful. If they were, why would they
wear those veils?"). Of course,
jokes of 1791 can't always be fresh,
but some of the topics, wine and
women in particular, got the same
pleasantly hammy ribbing that
they get now, and Joel Carter, as
Papagcno, was a better comic than
the Gaieties had.
Dr. Popper of course deserves the
lion's share of credit, but some
members of the cast come in for
special comment. Joseph Tissier, as
Tamino, sang a frequently dull role
with a pleasant, unafTected voice
and unpretentious gestures. Lois
Hartzell, who played Pamina, pos
sesses a fine voice, but only two sets
of facial expressions: ecstasy and
anguish. Inasmuch as she is re
quired only to sing most of the
time, nothing is lost.
The plot is too complicated and
pointless to be even outlined here,
but members of the cast are re
quired to "fake" various instru
ments at times. Papageno made the
most of this, stopping the show with
his little glockenspiel "solo" (by
P p 55.V Bradford). The best single
line was when he leaned over to the
audience, raised his glockenspiel,
and announced in a hoarse whis
per: "Now, with variations!"
The part of Sarastro is wonderfully
handled by Ray Ilammett (who
scored against Cal in 1942 for the
Stanford Red, and looks it), and who
has, in addition to a fine bass voice,
enough dignity in his appearance to
scare the living daylights out of ev
eryone within ten feet from him,
which is, come to think of it, what he
is supposed to do.
As closing words, let me point out
that the Stanford production is prob
ably unique in that the men who
carry spears look as if they could
use them, and the maids, who are
supposed to be young and lithe, arc,
contrary to all operatic tradition,
young and lithe. Arias by Pamina
and the Queen of the Night (Evelyn
Corvello) were well carried out,
with conviction and clarity, but sing
ing honors of the evening went
to Ted Uppman, who distinguished
himself by his bearing and a truly
remarkable bass-baritone in the part
of the High Priest. His solo alone is
worth the price of admission.—Novi

has, in addition to a fine bass voice,
enough dignity in his appearance to
scare the living daylights out of ev
eryone within ten feet from him,
which is, come to think of it, what he
is supposed to do.
As closing words, let me point out
that the Stanford production is prob
ably unique in that the men who
carry spears look as if they could
use them, and the maids, who are
supposed to be young and lithe, arc,
contrary to all operatic tradition,
young and lithe. Arias by Pamina
and the Queen of the Night (Evelyn
Corvello) were well carried out,
with conviction and clarity, but sing
ing honors of the evening went
to Ted Uppman, who distinguished
himself by his bearing and a truly
remarkable bass-baritone in the part
of the High Priest. His solo alone is
worth the price of admission.—Novi

"The Magic Flute" opened its ttfree-day run last night, and may be
stamped at once as an unqualified success. This production, probablry the
most ambitious ever attempted in the Auditorium since its construction,
had to struggle under the burden of one of the worst librettos ever written,
and yet it sent an amazed and thoroughly satisfied audience streaming out
after a satisfying number of curtain calls for the deserving principals.

► The entire cast was free from the
i affliction of operatic singers, that
i of twisting the mouth into bizarre
j shapes; the result was that every
i one, and I mean everyone, could be
j clearly understood, even in the bal-
I cony. Will wonders never cease!
One of the main advantages of
I this clear diction was that it at last
■ revealed the vintage of some of
Bob Hope's favorite wheezes (i.e.,
"These women couldn't be beauti
ful. If they were, why would they
wear those veils?"). Of course,
jokes of 1791 can't always be fresh,
but some of the topics, wine and
women in particular, got the same
pleasantly hammy ribbing that
they get now, and Joel Carter, as
Papagcno, was a better comic than
the Gaieties had.
Dr. Popper of course deserves the
lion's share of credit, but some
members of the cast come in for
special comment. Joseph Tissier, as
Tamino, sang a frequently dull role
with a pleasant, unafTected voice
and unpretentious gestures. Lois
Hartzell, who played Pamina, pos
sesses a fine voice, but only two sets
of facial expressions: ecstasy and
anguish. Inasmuch as she is re
quired only to sing most of the
time, nothing is lost.
The plot is too complicated and
pointless to be even outlined here,
but members of the cast are re
quired to "fake" various instru
ments at times. Papageno made the
most of this, stopping the show with
his little glockenspiel "solo" (by
P p 55.V Bradford). The best single
line was when he leaned over to the
audience, raised his glockenspiel,
and announced in a hoarse whis
per: "Now, with variations!"
The part of Sarastro is wonderfully
handled by Ray Ilammett (who
scored against Cal in 1942 for the
Stanford Red, and looks it), and who
has, in addition to a fine bass voice,
enough dignity in his appearance to
scare the living daylights out of ev
eryone within ten feet from him,
