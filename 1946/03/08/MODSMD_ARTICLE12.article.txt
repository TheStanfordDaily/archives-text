Pierre Luboshutfc, a Russian, and !
bis wife, Genia NemenofT, a Pari- j
sian of Russian parentage, have
done much to swell the recent pop- |
ularity of duo-pianists. Last season
they attracted widr attention with
a new concerto written for them by !
Bohuslav Martinu, the Czech com I
poser.
Although each of these artists j
was a well-known soloist, as a team j
they have combined technical unity
with artistic freedom to produce a j
performance of orchestral richness j
which some critics have termed !
"unexcelled."
