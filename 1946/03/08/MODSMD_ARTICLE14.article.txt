# Atom Group Backs World Government
## 
### 
In a series of sweeping changes
Stanford's former Student Associa
tion for Atomic Control has become
a movement backing world govern
ment.
Still under the leadership of
Charlie Clarke, the group, now ten
tatively known as Student Commit
tee for World Federation, took these
steps because an overwhelming ma
jority of its members felt that then
can be no adequate control of tin
atomic bomb without government
on a world scale.
Series of Debates
Culminating a series of debates
on this issue, the world federation
faction won a decisive victory Mon
day when S.A.A.C. members voted
to endorse an amendment proposed
by Arthur Berman.
This amendment, which reviscn
the preamble to the S.A.A.C. con -
stitution, states in effect that the
group will join the growing move -
ment for world government.
Association Slogan
With the slogan "No control with
out power, no power without law,
no law without government," a
membership drive is planned be
ginning next, quarter.
Excom has already OK'd the new
group. It voted unanimously la:-.'.
Wednesday to approve the proposed
amendment.
"We are not a group of idealistic
dreamers with our heads in the
clouds," says Clark. "We will con
tinue to fight for effective measures
of atomic control in Congress—such
as the McMahon Bill—and we will
give our full support to practical
steps leading to world federation
Included among the organiza
tion's plans are an all-campus poll
