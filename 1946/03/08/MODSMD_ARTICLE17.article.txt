# After Ten Weeks...
## 
### 
Comes the last Daily of the quarter, we
liio to look back through the many pages of
newspaper type to see what trends of the
campus and the outside world were reflected
there: not as an indulgence in sentimental
backtracking, but in the hope that a few
guides may be found for the future.
Winter quarter saw a record enrollment
of 4,335, a jump of 600 over autumn quarter,
and that bugaboo of veteran adjustment
(which we often suspected of being, in the
mai ~ home front exaggeration) seemed to
resolve iiself into two problems.
for many of the veterans, who want and
need to get their college education packed
into a short time, some Lower Division re
quirements seemed preity stiff. But taking
into consideration the fact that adjustments
can be made, through the administration,
to lighten a heavy requirement load when
feasible, and the fact that the present re
quired courses are only a small step toward
a liberal education, we think that in the long
run the veterans are getting a square deal
in this respect.
Adequate housing facilities are still de
finitely not available, and we urge that the
adi imistration does not slacken its efforts
to j lieve the shortage. Placing "first things
first," we designate the housing situation as
the problem that must be given continual
and top consideration in the next months,
when it is apt to assume even larger propor
tions with the return of more ex-servicemen.
The vote on the new ASSU Constitution

raised the question of how we could best
achieve an active, rather than lethargic, stu
dent government. By a vote of four to one,
we chose area representation on Excom as a
basis on which to build that kind of govern
ment.
Now we can be content with forgetting the
whole thing, or we can expend the effort
necessary to make it work. We will be dis
appointed if "the ordinary way" is chosen
again this year, v/hen the opportunity to re
vitalize our governmental institutions is with
in easy stretching distance.
As for trends of student thought, we are
hopeful that the future will hold a redoubling
of interest in the national and international
issues that are in danger of seeming remote,
from the rarefied atmosphere of a university.
In a quarter that happened at the same
time that 51 nations were gathering at the
first assembly of the UNO, and the world
moved unsteadily on its peace journey, we
commended organizations on campus such
as the International Club, the S.A.A.C.. and
the Chinese Affairs Discussion Croup, which
contribute in small but important ways to
the understanding and maturity of the cam
pus as a whole. Their contributions are the
best balance we have against the shallow
and transitory glory of some phases of col
lege life.
So we close the files on winter quarter,
1946. Looking back is only valuable if it
makes tomorrow's path of action a little more
clear.

(which we often suspected of being, in the
mai ~ home front exaggeration) seemed to
resolve iiself into two problems.
for many of the veterans, who want and
need to get their college education packed
into a short time, some Lower Division re
quirements seemed preity stiff. But taking
into consideration the fact that adjustments
can be made, through the administration,
to lighten a heavy requirement load when
feasible, and the fact that the present re
quired courses are only a small step toward
a liberal education, we think that in the long
run the veterans are getting a square deal
in this respect.
Adequate housing facilities are still de
finitely not available, and we urge that the
adi imistration does not slacken its efforts
to j lieve the shortage. Placing "first things
first," we designate the housing situation as
the problem that must be given continual
and top consideration in the next months,
when it is apt to assume even larger propor
tions with the return of more ex-servicemen.
The vote on the new ASSU Constitution

raised the question of how we could best
achieve an active, rather than lethargic, stu
dent government. By a vote of four to one,
we chose area representation on Excom as a
basis on which to build that kind of govern
ment.
Now we can be content with forgetting the
whole thing, or we can expend the effort
necessary to make it work. We will be dis
appointed if "the ordinary way" is chosen
again this year, v/hen the opportunity to re
vitalize our governmental institutions is with
in easy stretching distance.
As for trends of student thought, we are
hopeful that the future will hold a redoubling
of interest in the national and international
issues that are in danger of seeming remote,
from the rarefied atmosphere of a university.
In a quarter that happened at the same
time that 51 nations were gathering at the
first assembly of the UNO, and the world
moved unsteadily on its peace journey, we
commended organizations on campus such
as the International Club, the S.A.A.C.. and
the Chinese Affairs Discussion Croup, which
contribute in small but important ways to
the understanding and maturity of the cam
pus as a whole. Their contributions are the
best balance we have against the shallow
and transitory glory of some phases of col
lege life.
So we close the files on winter quarter,
1946. Looking back is only valuable if it
makes tomorrow's path of action a little more
clear.
Comes the last Daily of the quarter, we
liio to look back through the many pages of
newspaper type to see what trends of the
campus and the outside world were reflected
there: not as an indulgence in sentimental
backtracking, but in the hope that a few
guides may be found for the future.
Winter quarter saw a record enrollment
of 4,335, a jump of 600 over autumn quarter,
and that bugaboo of veteran adjustment
(which we often suspected of being, in the
