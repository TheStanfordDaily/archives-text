Editor, Stanford Daily:
Six men admitted lor observation.
Eleven treated for stomach and intestinal dis
orders.
Tlu.t is Palo Alto Hospital's record on Stanford
men during the twelve-hour period from 9 p.m.
Wednesday to 9 a.m. Thursday morning. Without a
doubt most, if not all, of these men were diners at
Etr-ina Commons during the previous days.
But the record does not stop there. Literally doz
ens of students at Encina Hall have suffered intense
intestinal disorders sufficient to prevent their at
tending classes.
This simply means that there is most probably
something wrong with (1) the food served at En
cina Commons or (2) the sanitary conditions of the
Encina kitchen.
Now the apparent problem is the safety of our
health. A few weeks ago an official check was made
( 112 sanitary conditions at Encina Commons. They
were found unsatisfactory and dangerous.
What steps have been taken to improve the sani
tary conditions in the kitchen? What steps are
being taken as a result of the latest outbreak?
What is the position of the public Health Service
in this matter? These are questions which vitally
concern us.
We would like an answer.
(Signed by 30 diners at Encina Commons.)
Open letter to the students of Stanford University:
As you go about your work, attend classes, laugh
and sing on Saturday night, cram for exams on
Sunday, pause for a moment and ask yourselves
this question—how long will it last? Can we deny
what every newspaper headline tells us each day,
that the world is drifting toward another war? if
war comes again it will not be just another war.
Everything we cherish, our cities, our houses,
everything will be wrecked in such a cataclysm as
the world has never seen. This is the cold hard
reality of the atomic age. Our scientists, educators,
and statesmen all warn—only a revolution in
political thinking can save our civilization.
We go about our work, sit back, let nature lake
its course and sigh: "what can WE do?" Have
we forgotten so soon what our friends who per
ished in this past war have dene; have we for
gotten the stinking jungles, the mangled bodies,
the broken lives; have we forgotten? We CAN
do something. We can understand what causes
war, we can think, discuss, work—just as hard
as we did during the war—to win the peace!
We, in an institution of learning, cannot stand by

and watch the twilight of civilization and do noth
ing. If there is no longer any security to be found
in armies and navies, let us say so. If power poli
tics and interregional alliance can't prevent war,
let us say .so. If national sovereignty in an atomic
age represents a threat to the life of every person
everywhere, let us say so. And the time has come
for us to say so!
This week the Student Association for Atomic
Control became the Student Committee for World
Federation. Its policy, as now expressed in its
constitution, is .. to aid in every possible way,
the growing movement for the establishment of a
Federal World Organization responsible directly
to the people . . . having jurisdiction over only
those affairs which transcend national boundaries
and threaten world peace, such as the manufac
ture of atomic weapons." We do not believe that
overnight the world will clamor for a world gov
ernment, a government which they must respect
above their national governments. The question
is not how hard it will be to get a system of law
and government. The question is how can we
do without it? Shall we just say the world is not
ready for it and do nothing? llow then do we
ever expect to get ready for it?
To say that it won't work before we even try
to get started is to deny that the United States
was formed out of conflicting sovereign states,
that it is composed today of caste-conscious states
and democratic stales, to deny that Switzerland
where four languages are spoken has a working
federal system and to deny the existence of law
and government in every community in the world
where interests conflict.
This is a world crisis -to laugh it off is to make a
mockery of the death of millions everywhere who
were promised that out of the hell they were en
during would come an enlightened world. We plead
for student support, especially veterans whose sac
rifices made victory possible. Join with us in this
movement that has begun all over the world—to
build a new world society out of the ashes and
shattered atoms of the old. If we really want peace,
we have to work for it.
If everyone convinces just one person, we have
gone a long way toward our goal. Time is grow
ing short. The atomic armament race that has
already begun must be stopped. Remember the
screams of dying men are alike in all languages.
Work with us before war comes again. IT IS
LATER THAN YOU THINK.

ever expect to get ready for it?
To say that it won't work before we even try
to get started is to deny that the United States
was formed out of conflicting sovereign states,
that it is composed today of caste-conscious states
and democratic stales, to deny that Switzerland
where four languages are spoken has a working
federal system and to deny the existence of law
and government in every community in the world
where interests conflict.
This is a world crisis -to laugh it off is to make a
mockery of the death of millions everywhere who
were promised that out of the hell they were en
during would come an enlightened world. We plead
for student support, especially veterans whose sac
rifices made victory possible. Join with us in this
movement that has begun all over the world—to
build a new world society out of the ashes and
shattered atoms of the old. If we really want peace,
we have to work for it.
If everyone convinces just one person, we have
gone a long way toward our goal. Time is grow
ing short. The atomic armament race that has
already begun must be stopped. Remember the
screams of dying men are alike in all languages.
Work with us before war comes again. IT IS
LATER THAN YOU THINK.

Six men admitted lor observation.

orders.
Tlu.t is Palo Alto Hospital's record on Stanford
men during the twelve-hour period from 9 p.m.
Wednesday to 9 a.m. Thursday morning. Without a
doubt most, if not all, of these men were diners at
Etr-ina Commons during the previous days.
But the record does not stop there. Literally doz
ens of students at Encina Hall have suffered intense
intestinal disorders sufficient to prevent their at
tending classes.
This simply means that there is most probably
something wrong with (1) the food served at En
cina Commons or (2) the sanitary conditions of the
Encina kitchen.
Now the apparent problem is the safety of our
health. A few weeks ago an official check was made
( 112 sanitary conditions at Encina Commons. They
were found unsatisfactory and dangerous.
What steps have been taken to improve the sani
tary conditions in the kitchen? What steps are
being taken as a result of the latest outbreak?
What is the position of the public Health Service
in this matter? These are questions which vitally
concern us.
We would like an answer.

As you go about your work, attend classes, laugh
and sing on Saturday night, cram for exams on
Sunday, pause for a moment and ask yourselves
this question—how long will it last? Can we deny
what every newspaper headline tells us each day,
that the world is drifting toward another war? if
war comes again it will not be just another war.
Everything we cherish, our cities, our houses,
everything will be wrecked in such a cataclysm as
the world has never seen. This is the cold hard
reality of the atomic age. Our scientists, educators,
and statesmen all warn—only a revolution in
political thinking can save our civilization.
We go about our work, sit back, let nature lake
its course and sigh: "what can WE do?" Have
we forgotten so soon what our friends who per
ished in this past war have dene; have we for
gotten the stinking jungles, the mangled bodies,
the broken lives; have we forgotten? We CAN
do something. We can understand what causes
war, we can think, discuss, work—just as hard
as we did during the war—to win the peace!
We, in an institution of learning, cannot stand by

and watch the twilight of civilization and do noth
ing. If there is no longer any security to be found
in armies and navies, let us say so. If power poli
tics and interregional alliance can't prevent war,
let us say .so. If national sovereignty in an atomic
age represents a threat to the life of every person
everywhere, let us say so. And the time has come
for us to say so!
This week the Student Association for Atomic
Control became the Student Committee for World
Federation. Its policy, as now expressed in its

the growing movement for the establishment of a
Federal World Organization responsible directly
to the people . . . having jurisdiction over only
those affairs which transcend national boundaries
and threaten world peace, such as the manufac
ture of atomic weapons." We do not believe that
overnight the world will clamor for a world gov

above their national governments. The question

war, we can think, discuss, work—just as hard
as we did during the war—to win the peace!
We, in an institution of learning, cannot stand by

and watch the twilight of civilization and do noth
ing. If there is no longer any security to be found
in armies and navies, let us say so. If power poli
tics and interregional alliance can't prevent war,
let us say .so. If national sovereignty in an atomic
age represents a threat to the life of every person
everywhere, let us say so. And the time has come
for us to say so!
This week the Student Association for Atomic
Control became the Student Committee for World
Federation. Its policy, as now expressed in its
constitution, is .. to aid in every possible way,
the growing movement for the establishment of a
Federal World Organization responsible directly
to the people . . . having jurisdiction over only
those affairs which transcend national boundaries
and threaten world peace, such as the manufac
ture of atomic weapons." We do not believe that
overnight the world will clamor for a world gov
ernment, a government which they must respect
above their national governments. The question
is not how hard it will be to get a system of law
and government. The question is how can we
do without it? Shall we just say the world is not
ready for it and do nothing? llow then do we
ever expect to get ready for it?
To say that it won't work before we even try
to get started is to deny that the United States
was formed out of conflicting sovereign states,
that it is composed today of caste-conscious states
and democratic stales, to deny that Switzerland
where four languages are spoken has a working
federal system and to deny the existence of law
and government in every community in the world
where interests conflict.
This is a world crisis -to laugh it off is to make a
mockery of the death of millions everywhere who
were promised that out of the hell they were en
during would come an enlightened world. We plead
for student support, especially veterans whose sac
rifices made victory possible. Join with us in this
movement that has begun all over the world—to
build a new world society out of the ashes and
shattered atoms of the old. If we really want peace,
we have to work for it.
If everyone convinces just one person, we have
gone a long way toward our goal. Time is grow
ing short. The atomic armament race that has
already begun must be stopped. Remember the
screams of dying men are alike in all languages.
Work with us before war comes again. IT IS
LATER THAN YOU THINK.

Editor, Stanford Daily:
Six men admitted lor observation.
Eleven treated for stomach and intestinal dis
orders.
Tlu.t is Palo Alto Hospital's record on Stanford
men during the twelve-hour period from 9 p.m.
Wednesday to 9 a.m. Thursday morning. Without a
doubt most, if not all, of these men were diners at
Etr-ina Commons during the previous days.
But the record does not stop there. Literally doz
ens of students at Encina Hall have suffered intense
intestinal disorders sufficient to prevent their at
tending classes.
This simply means that there is most probably
something wrong with (1) the food served at En
cina Commons or (2) the sanitary conditions of the
Encina kitchen.
Now the apparent problem is the safety of our
health. A few weeks ago an official check was made
( 112 sanitary conditions at Encina Commons. They
were found unsatisfactory and dangerous.
What steps have been taken to improve the sani
tary conditions in the kitchen? What steps are
being taken as a result of the latest outbreak?
What is the position of the public Health Service
in this matter? These are questions which vitally
concern us.
We would like an answer.
(Signed by 30 diners at Encina Commons.)
Open letter to the students of Stanford University:
As you go about your work, attend classes, laugh
and sing on Saturday night, cram for exams on
Sunday, pause for a moment and ask yourselves
this question—how long will it last? Can we deny
what every newspaper headline tells us each day,
that the world is drifting toward another war? if
war comes again it will not be just another war.
Everything we cherish, our cities, our houses,
everything will be wrecked in such a cataclysm as
the world has never seen. This is the cold hard
reality of the atomic age. Our scientists, educators,
and statesmen all warn—only a revolution in
political thinking can save our civilization.
We go about our work, sit back, let nature lake
its course and sigh: "what can WE do?" Have
we forgotten so soon what our friends who per
ished in this past war have dene; have we for
gotten the stinking jungles, the mangled bodies,
the broken lives; have we forgotten? We CAN
do something. We can understand what causes
war, we can think, discuss, work—just as hard
as we did during the war—to win the peace!
We, in an institution of learning, cannot stand by

and watch the twilight of civilization and do noth
ing. If there is no longer any security to be found
