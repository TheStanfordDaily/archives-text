We agree with you wholeheartedly, Lois Williams.
A girl just isn't safe around here any more. Not
only should there be a cop every fifty feet, a light
under every tree, and a battery of women to answer
the door at Lagunita, but there should be a moat
and a highly-charged fence around the Farm, and
ai 8 p.m. we will pull up the draw bridge (with
the troll under it) and turn on the current. Never
let it be said that we are striving for an ivory tower.
However, if all this is instituted the $143 will per
force be jacked up to $193, and the few of you who
aren't on the GI bill will have to throw in the
trowel. So we have a cheaper method. Include in

the lower division requirements for all co-eds
three quarters, not necessarily consecutive, ol I
Physical Education WB9, Jiu-jitsu, Elementary tech
niques of, dhur.

Since this is our last chance to harangue at you
for several weeks, we have compiled a list of "got
to's" between now and matriculation day:
1) Naturally topping the list is the Spring Reg
Dance. Let's all turn out and show Ray and Patsy
how happy we are to see them.
2) Trip down to Mem Aud Sunday night and see
"Topper Takes a Trip," and chapters penultimate
and ultimate of "Overland Male."
3) Ingredients: Leavening, Flour, Salt, Malt and
Shortening. Net weight: 1 oz. or over.
4) Don't forget Pierre Luboshutz and Fob Ne
menoft Monday night.
5) Next Quarter's time schedules tomorrow.
6) Baseball games over holidays down South:
March 26 and 27 against Southern Branch at West
wood; and March 29 and 30 at Bovard against the
terrible Trojans.
6) Let's not tip the glass when we pour Mother
another water at home.
7) Grade envelopes addressed home after March
27—or would you rather not?
