Never again in human progress
will we have a richness of material
of different cultures, said Felix M.
Keesing, professor of anthropology,
when he spoke yesterday afternoon
on "Anthropology in the United
States: Some Current Trends and
Problems."
Mr. Keesing's talk was the last
of the winter quarter series of the
Symposium on American Studies,
sponsored by the Department of
Humanities.
"Up until recently ljumans have
isolated themselves and developed
then particular cultures, but in our
generation, with faster communica
tion and transportation systems, no
one can be isolated," said Mr. Kee
sing.
That is the reason so many stu
dents of ethnology, a branch of an
thropology dealing with cultures,
have felt the urgent need of imme
diately recording descriptively the
vanishing human cultures through
out the world, the speaker ex
plained.
"The war increased the studies
in the field of applied anthropol
ogy," said the speaker. "Anthro
pologists are now concerned with
answering questions such as 'How
do people respond to stimuli?' 'Why
do they resist change?' 'Can you
control their behavior?'"
