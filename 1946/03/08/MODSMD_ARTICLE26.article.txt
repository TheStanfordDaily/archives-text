# Oldsters Win From Nimitz
## 
### 
The intramural basketball play
offs were narrowed to three teams
i last night at the expense of previ
i ously undefeated Nimitz and once
| beaten Buchanan.
The highly touted Nimitz team,
1 champions of League V. were never
; able to overcome the early lead ta
ken by the Oldsters. After tying
the score at four-all, the Oldsters
jumped to a 12-5 lead and main
tained it with little difficulty
throughout the game. The Oldsters
were led by Weller who scored 15
; points as his teammates took a 35-
27 victory. Star of the game, how
ever, was Ollie Shoup, who scored
1(5 points for Nimitz and turned in
an excellent performance on the
floor.
Oldster Teamwork Effective
1 It was fast, well - co-ordinated
teamwork that gftve victory to the
Oldsters. The combination of Wel
ler, Clelland, and Zemanek was just
too much lor the Navy boys, whose
| plays were good, but completely
; outclassed by the Oldsters.
Moser and Dabney gave nice sup-
I port for high - scorer Shoup, but
, their efforts were futile when it
| came to defense against the fast of
fense of the Oldsters. By the time
Weller was taken out on fouls, the
j damage was done; to overcome the
j Oldster lead was impossible.
Dclts Defeat Buchanan
In the other game, Delta Tau
| Delta defeated a fighting Buchanan
I team, 33-21. Buchanan's big trouble
i was fouls. By the end of the game
| there were not enough men left on
j the Buchanan roster to make up a
lull team. The 12-point margin of
the Delts was exactly equal to the
free throws that were sunk by
them. The Buchanan boys were
made nearly ineffective by the loss
of three first - stringers — Erlich,
Melendy, and Bloch.
Lambie High-Point Man
j Pacing the victors was Gordon
Covell with 13 points, but high
point man was Tom Lambie of Bu
chanan with 14. Instrumental in
j the Delt victory were Tom Howard
i and Thor Petersen, former football
| quarterback. Nice performances for
! Buchanan were turned in by John
!ny Erlich, who fouled out about
! midway through the game, and Bob
Bloch, whose guarding held down
the Delt lead until he was removed
on fouls near the end.
Last night's games leave the
! Delts, the Oldsters, and Encina Cel
lar still in the intramural playoffs.

27 victory. Star of the game, how
ever, was Ollie Shoup, who scored
1(5 points for Nimitz and turned in
an excellent performance on the
floor.
Oldster Teamwork Effective
1 It was fast, well - co-ordinated
teamwork that gftve victory to the
Oldsters. The combination of Wel
ler, Clelland, and Zemanek was just
too much lor the Navy boys, whose
| plays were good, but completely
; outclassed by the Oldsters.
Moser and Dabney gave nice sup-
I port for high - scorer Shoup, but
, their efforts were futile when it
| came to defense against the fast of
fense of the Oldsters. By the time
Weller was taken out on fouls, the
j damage was done; to overcome the
j Oldster lead was impossible.
Dclts Defeat Buchanan
In the other game, Delta Tau
| Delta defeated a fighting Buchanan
I team, 33-21. Buchanan's big trouble
i was fouls. By the end of the game
| there were not enough men left on
j the Buchanan roster to make up a
lull team. The 12-point margin of
the Delts was exactly equal to the
free throws that were sunk by
them. The Buchanan boys were
made nearly ineffective by the loss
of three first - stringers — Erlich,
Melendy, and Bloch.
Lambie High-Point Man
j Pacing the victors was Gordon
Covell with 13 points, but high
point man was Tom Lambie of Bu
chanan with 14. Instrumental in
j the Delt victory were Tom Howard
i and Thor Petersen, former football
| quarterback. Nice performances for
! Buchanan were turned in by John
!ny Erlich, who fouled out about
! midway through the game, and Bob
Bloch, whose guarding held down
the Delt lead until he was removed
on fouls near the end.
Last night's games leave the
! Delts, the Oldsters, and Encina Cel
lar still in the intramural playoffs.
The intramural basketball play
offs were narrowed to three teams
i last night at the expense of previ
i ously undefeated Nimitz and once
| beaten Buchanan.
The highly touted Nimitz team,
1 champions of League V. were never
; able to overcome the early lead ta
ken by the Oldsters. After tying
the score at four-all, the Oldsters
jumped to a 12-5 lead and main
tained it with little difficulty
throughout the game. The Oldsters
were led by Weller who scored 15
; points as his teammates took a 35-
27 victory. Star of the game, how
ever, was Ollie Shoup, who scored
1(5 points for Nimitz and turned in
