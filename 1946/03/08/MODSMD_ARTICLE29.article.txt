### ART LEVINSON 
Our little man informs us that
this is "30" for the quarter. Tradi
tion dictates to us that we should be
very sentimental about it all, and
that tears should be splattering the
Underwood, but for some reason
we aren't able to fit ourselves into
that mood.
Maybe the thought of heading for
the beach as soon as those wretched
finals are over keeps us in a jovial
mood. After conducting a rather in
formal poll among Cardinal colle
giates, we find that most everybody
is going to soak up some sun dur
ing those 240 hours of freedom.

Yesterday Slants made men
tion of a ping pong tournament
between Toyon and Tyler. To he
truthful, a very slanted account
of the tourney appeared in the
Daily. But in no way was any
personal maliciousness intended.
This writer merely wished to be
kidding about the whole affair,
since the tourney represented no
life-and-death stakes.
By the same token, members of
(lie Sigma Chi fraternity could be
mad for not printing "both sides"
of the story in regard to their
basketball game with Sigma Nu.
But the whole thing is taken as a
joke, and nothing more.
This writer never realized that
any of the N.R.O. fellows would
take so seriously the entire affair.
We hope that all misunderstand
ings are cleared up. Come on
over to the Daily and we'll smoke
the peace pipe, just like good
Injuns.
A number of people have spoken
to us about the write-up of the
Stanford-St. Mary's baseball con
test last Tuesday afternoon in the
Chronicle. All were rather bitter
at the fact that most of the article
was devoted to the activities of

) Herman Wedemeyer, despite the
I act that the Indians pummeled the
i Gaels by a margin of eight runs.
We heartily agree with the
irate fans. What do Harry Wol
ter's haschallers have to do to
rate a fair break in the Sporting
Green? Have a 25-run lead, be
sides having the pitcher (ling a
no-hit contest?
For our money, Phil Wolfe was
I the outstanding performer, of the
day, yet he got very little mention
i in the story. If the Chronicle does
n't improve its baseball write-ups
of the Stanford games, we are go
! ing to put in & request to Mr. Gun
ther of the Cellar that he stock the
j San Jose Mercury Herald.

One of the less-publicized sports
; activities is the N.R.O.T.C. rifle
j team. Boasting a win over the Cal
sharpshooters, the Stanford .squad
1 now rates tenth in the nation out
of 47 rifle teams. The win over the
Blue and Gold, by the way, was
their first defeat in three years of
I competition.
No more matches have been
; scheduled yet, but it is expected
j that next quarter other rifle en
gagements will be lined up.
* Jjc »J:
i Hoff told us to be sure and tell
, everybody that the SigiYia Nu-Sig
!ma Chi basketball game will be
| played tomorrow morning at 10:30.
j HofT, who also is referred to as
| Frank Hoffman in polite society,
told us that a record - breaking
crowd should be on hand at the
1 gym for the royal tilt for the keg
; of buttermilk.
Also slated for Saturday after
noon is the baseball feat between
; the sports staff and editorial staff.
The sportsters have been following
| rigorous training rules the past few
days, and confidently predict vic

I sunburning. See ya next quarter.

Stanford-St. Mary's baseball con
test last Tuesday afternoon in the
Chronicle. All were rather bitter
at the fact that most of the article
was devoted to the activities of

) Herman Wedemeyer, despite the
I act that the Indians pummeled the
i Gaels by a margin of eight runs.
We heartily agree with the
irate fans. What do Harry Wol
ter's haschallers have to do to
rate a fair break in the Sporting
Green? Have a 25-run lead, be
sides having the pitcher (ling a
no-hit contest?
For our money, Phil Wolfe was
I the outstanding performer, of the
day, yet he got very little mention
i in the story. If the Chronicle does
n't improve its baseball write-ups
of the Stanford games, we are go
! ing to put in & request to Mr. Gun
ther of the Cellar that he stock the
j San Jose Mercury Herald.

One of the less-publicized sports
; activities is the N.R.O.T.C. rifle
j team. Boasting a win over the Cal
sharpshooters, the Stanford .squad
1 now rates tenth in the nation out
of 47 rifle teams. The win over the
Blue and Gold, by the way, was
their first defeat in three years of
I competition.
No more matches have been
; scheduled yet, but it is expected
j that next quarter other rifle en
gagements will be lined up.

i Hoff told us to be sure and tell

!ma Chi basketball game will be
| played tomorrow morning at 10:30.
j HofT, who also is referred to as
| Frank Hoffman in polite society,
told us that a record - breaking
crowd should be on hand at the
1 gym for the royal tilt for the keg
; of buttermilk.
Also slated for Saturday after
noon is the baseball feat between
; the sports staff and editorial staff.
The sportsters have been following
| rigorous training rules the past few
days, and confidently predict vic
: lory over the ed staff. . . . Happy
I sunburning. See ya next quarter.
Our little man informs us that
this is "30" for the quarter. Tradi
tion dictates to us that we should be
very sentimental about it all, and
that tears should be splattering the
Underwood, but for some reason
we aren't able to fit ourselves into
that mood.
Maybe the thought of heading for
the beach as soon as those wretched
finals are over keeps us in a jovial
mood. After conducting a rather in
formal poll among Cardinal colle
giates, we find that most everybody
is going to soak up some sun dur
ing those 240 hours of freedom.

Yesterday Slants made men
tion of a ping pong tournament
between Toyon and Tyler. To he
truthful, a very slanted account
of the tourney appeared in the
Daily. But in no way was any
personal maliciousness intended.
This writer merely wished to be
kidding about the whole affair,
since the tourney represented no
life-and-death stakes.
By the same token, members of
(lie Sigma Chi fraternity could be
mad for not printing "both sides"
of the story in regard to their
basketball game with Sigma Nu.
But the whole thing is taken as a
joke, and nothing more.
This writer never realized that
any of the N.R.O. fellows would
take so seriously the entire affair.
We hope that all misunderstand
ings are cleared up. Come on
over to the Daily and we'll smoke
the peace pipe, just like good
Injuns.
