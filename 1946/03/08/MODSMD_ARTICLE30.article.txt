# Wrestlers Favorites To Beat Cal Tonight
## 
### STU MILLAR 
Led by Captain Oscar Thompson.
Stanford's varsity wrestling team
will engage the California Bears in
the big meet of the season tonight
at 7:30 in the Stanfoi'd Pavilion.
The Stanford grapplers are slight
pre-match favorites to whip the
Bears, but one or two upsets could
conceivably alter the picture con
siderably.
Sports fans will note with inter
est that Stanford Coach Mumby's
two sons, Hugh, who attends Cal,
and Winston, who is a Card, are
scheduled to meet each other in the
175-pound event. While this match
would provide immense human in
terest, it is unlikely to come off be
cause of the refusal of both athletes
to compete against each other.
Stanford's representative in the
121-lb. class will not be decided
upon until weighing-in ceremonies.
If George Wing can make the
weight, he will represent the Farm;
if not, Dave Heninger will.
Tonight will be the first trial of
the new wrestling rules which have
just been instituted by the Confer
ence. Three preliminary matches
with no bearing upon the outcome
of the meet will be held to famil
iarize the participants and specta
tors with the methods.

Most likely to register triumphs
for Stanford are Captain Thompson
in the 165-lb. class, Vern Jones in
Ihe 136-lb. division, and Dan Win
ston in the 155-lb. The odds are
even money if the Mumby versus
Mumby match comes off. Tiny Mo
ther of Stanford, if he gets on top
of Wayne Richards, will probably
stay there. He is in the heavy
weight class.
Other men on the Indian squad
are Willard Walker, 128-pounder,
and Jim Kurfess, 145-pounder. Vic
tories by these grapplers would
practically assure Stanford of win
ning. but Cal is exceptionally strong
in these weight divisions.
