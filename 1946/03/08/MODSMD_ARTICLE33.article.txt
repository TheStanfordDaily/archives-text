# Farm Seeks Second Win In Sunken Diamond
## 
### 
Trying for their second win in as
many games, Stanford's baseball
team will play the Buzzer Sham
rocks on the Sunken Diamond at
2:30 tomorrow afternoon in a prac
tice game.
On the mound for the Indians
will be Lefty Palisoul. Completing
the battery will be Dick Ahlquist.
The Shamrocks, after winning
their Bay Region winter league, are
anxious to start the spring cam
paign with a victory. Most of the
squad members are young but ex
perienced in sand-lot competition.
Harry Wolter is still spending
most of his time teaching his team
fundamentals; although they are
ambitious and hustling, most Stan

ford biill players lack the seasoned
polish necessary to college teams.
The starting line-up for the Stan
ford team is Lefty Palisoul, pitch
ing; Dick Ahlquist. catching; Mor
gan Millet, first base; Tom How
ard, second base; Bob Peters, short
stop; Larry Prato, third base; Jim
Wickersham, left field; Carl Kcl
lenberger. center fieid; and Georg"
Sloat, right fieid.
