# FIFTY YEARS ON QUAD

### 
Young University Builds Tradi
tions While Earthquakes. Autos,
and Women Create Changes
David Starr Jordan, first presi
dent of the University, said to the
entering class, "Our University has
no history to fall back upon. No
tender associations cling ivy-like to
its Ircsh new walls. It is hallowed
by no traditions, and is hampered
by none. Traditions and associa
tions is ours to make."
In 1946, 55 years from the date
of its founding, Stanford Univer
sity has found all these —in pajamc
rinos and proms; the Civ Libe and
the Con Nome; and great men,
some undiscovered, some famous as
Dr. Jordan. Herbert Hoover, Kay
l.yiuan Wilbur.
No sentimental figure of speech
is the campus nickname, the Harm.
Senator Stanford's farm, on which
the University is built, held a repu
tation with hor>e-lovers the world
over as the breeding place of cham
pion trotters, grazing on the land
now assigned to the golf course.
On October I, 1891. the I'"arm be
came Stanford University. Kuild
iug was still going on —the plans
included three Quads, the second
and third at either side of the pres
ent Quad (specified for use as
athletic grounds until tbe addi
tional structures were needed). I'y
the horse-and-buggy loop facing
the Administration Building, the
right and left triangles were set
aside as land for dormitories.
An arboretum, "to contain every
tree that can be made to grow in
this clime" was to have been culti
vated behind Lake Lagunita, the
"reservoir."
A huge arch, dominating the en
trance to Quad, and two giant
brownstone pillars at the end of
I'aim Drive topped with red tile
and cut by arches, could be seen
on opening day. Where the foun
tain now stands in Memorial C ourt
was a statue of the Stan lords. On
the facade of the Church was writ
ten in the words of Jane Lathrop,
"Kreeted to the (ilory ol Cod and
the loving memory of my husband
Leland Stanford.". These land
marks and many others were de
stroyed in 47 seconds by an earth -
quake in 1904, probably the young
University's greatest setback.
The early life of Farmhands was
harassed by problems familiar to
students today: transportation, by
foot, buggy or bicycle; and hous
ing. which was partially solved by
having men live in a one-story
building originally erected for
workmen. Roughs' Day, the Irish
Marathon, and a faculty-senior
baseball game were traditions aban
doned in later years.

in thigh length suits, the lirst anti

wearing dink caps and abiding by
the rule of the paddle.

their names on table tops at the

Isnt tio tradition in the 55 years

Stanford and the three
ot the Stanford I'amilj that have I
come to live here.
Young University Builds Tradi

David Starr Jordan, first presi
dent of the University, said to the
entering class, "Our University has
no history to fall back upon. No
tender associations cling ivy-like to
its Ircsh new walls. It is hallowed
by no traditions, and is hampered
by none. Traditions and associa
tions is ours to make."
In 1946, 55 years from the date
of its founding, Stanford Univer
sity has found all these —in pajamc
rinos and proms; the Civ Libe and
the Con Nome; and great men,
some undiscovered, some famous as
Dr. Jordan. Herbert Hoover, Kay
l.yiuan Wilbur.
No sentimental figure of speech
is the campus nickname, the Harm.
Senator Stanford's farm, on which
the University is built, held a repu
tation with hor>e-lovers the world
over as the breeding place of cham
pion trotters, grazing on the land
now assigned to the golf course.
On October I, 1891. the I'"arm be
came Stanford University. Kuild
iug was still going on —the plans
included three Quads, the second
and third at either side of the pres
ent Quad (specified for use as
athletic grounds until tbe addi
tional structures were needed). I'y
the horse-and-buggy loop facing
the Administration Building, the
right and left triangles were set
aside as land for dormitories.
An arboretum, "to contain every
tree that can be made to grow in
this clime" was to have been culti
vated behind Lake Lagunita, the
"reservoir."
A huge arch, dominating the en
trance to Quad, and two giant
brownstone pillars at the end of
I'aim Drive topped with red tile
and cut by arches, could be seen
on opening day. Where the foun
tain now stands in Memorial C ourt
was a statue of the Stan lords. On
the facade of the Church was writ
ten in the words of Jane Lathrop,
"Kreeted to the (ilory ol Cod and
the loving memory of my husband
Leland Stanford.". These land
marks and many others were de
stroyed in 47 seconds by an earth -
quake in 1904, probably the young
University's greatest setback.
The early life of Farmhands was
harassed by problems familiar to
students today: transportation, by
foot, buggy or bicycle; and hous
ing. which was partially solved by
having men live in a one-story
building originally erected for
workmen. Roughs' Day, the Irish
Marathon, and a faculty-senior
baseball game were traditions aban
doned in later years.
