# A 						New Health Service
## 
### 
A speed-up on plans for a new heallh serv
ice has brought the program to Stanford stu
dents this quarter, as you no doubt gathered
from the additional $5 fee you paid for regis
tration.
The advantages of a complete health pro
gram are well worth the $5; if you consider
what hospital care without charge, 24 hour a
day service, and a larger and more efficient
medical staff would mean to a student when
an "unforeseen event" comes along.
Students who discussed the program in
advance with Administration officials said
that they thought it would be the answer to
the urgent need for better medical facilities;
and they expressed approval of the plans,
whirh correspond to health insurance for:

1. Complete physical examination for all
entering students.
2. Medical and surgical treatment and
care.
3. Appropriate immunizations.
4. laboratory teste, X-ray examinations,
physiotherapy treatments, dressings, splints,
and professional consultations â€” when or
dered by the director of the student health
service.
5. Necessary house calls within ten miles
of the Administration Building.
6. Hospitalizations within certain limita
tions.
Thumbs up on the loss of $5 which means
this gain in health security.
