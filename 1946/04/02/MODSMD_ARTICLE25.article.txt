# Good to See You Back
## 
### 
Another Reg Day brings another influx of
discharged servicemen, among them many
old Stanford students, who have come back
to the Farm to finish up the job of getting
an education. And to them, we want to say
for the whole student body, "It's good to see
yov back."
1 jobably it won't be long before you'll be
seeing college in a pretty different light than
you would have if you had come with the
post-high school glow still fogging up the
horizon, fudging from the men who arrived
back last quarter, to some of you parts of the
old Stanford life will look suspiciously ju
venile and other parts will look more im

portant than they ever did before.
Besides this, you'll no doubt see a lot of
things to criticize with a more mature as
surance. What we're hoping is that you'll
use that maturity to full measure in your
academic and social activities. Think those
criticisms through fairly, but don't be afraid
to gripe when a gripe and a constructive
solution to any problem are needed.
The Daily, independent in policy from
both the administration and student body
executive groups, wants to serve you and
will welcome your comments in its "Campus
Opinion" columns. Stop in at the Shack
and the staff will verify that welcome.
