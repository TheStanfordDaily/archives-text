### H.D. THOREAU 
Shed a tear for the fellow who put in four
years in the army and 38 months overseas,
only to find yesterday when he tried in vain
to register under the G. I. Bill that he had
never signed his enlistment papers and there
fore technically had not been in the service.
He has now received word from his draft
board to appear for a physical preparatory to
serving his year in the forces.
The Alexandria Hotel is located in down
town Los Angeles with car tracks running
by all sides, a boiler factory down the block,
and a pneumatic drill proving ground across
the street.
The Stanford baseball team was quartered
in this cloistered haven during the past week.
Their Murphy beds were not let down from
the walls until 2 and 3 in the morning, and
the roosters quit roosting at 5 a.m.
Consequently the only sleeping time the

boys were able to get was when they took
trips out to Joe E. Brown and Franklin D.
Bovard Fields on the Westwood and Figue
roa campi respectfully.
Occasionally a ball would bounce out in
their direction but they would stay real quiet
and it would go right by.
When the boys get back to their Farm
shacks and their steady training table diet
this quarter, however, things should take on
a different phew.

The Administration Building will be open
all day today for those who would care to
register for spring quarter.
If you are stuck for a four unit course let
us suggest the following: Germanic Lan
guages ClO2, Literaturgeschichte von 1650 bis
zu Goethes Tod. dhr (Morgan, 116) (4). The
only pre-requisite is C9l, Bie Mir Bist du
Schoen, with very few umlauts.
