# HISTORYâ€”1946
## 
### ELLIOTT EPSTEEN 
In 1936, the year of the last Greek election,
only 60 per cent of the electorate went to
the polls. In 1946, despite the fact that the
Communists and other Moscow-supported
groups urged a boycott of the polls, from 65
to 75 per cent of the voters turned up.
Edrly reports give an overwhelming ma
jority to the parties of the right, while those
of the left are getting quite a trouncing.
A ITER ELECTION
Yet the major news in Greece might come
after the election. The left has been proven
in a minority, but previous disturbances
showed that it is an armed and a determined
one. The British Army, Greece's only compe
tent police force, is pledged to pull out after
the election is over, and that leaves the
country in possible danger of civil war.
MOSCOW'S INTEREST
Moscow has a definite interest in Greece.
It is Britain's last Balkan foothold, and planes
and torpedo boats, based in Macedonia and
supplied overland by railroad, could be
much more effective than British based mili
tary establishments in the Aegean, since the
latter would have to depend on a long and
vulnerable sea transport line.
Moreover, Tito, in Jugoslavia, has shown
definite interest in Macedonia. He once said,
"Macedonia belongs in the Jugoslav federa
tion, and the people want to be in it." Both
points are highly debatable, but they could
mean fight.
Pravda too has been rolling the war drums.

Several weeks ago, it was issuing reports
that the Greek army has been provoking
border clashes on the Albanian frontier, an
alleged fact which is confirmed by nobody.
POSSIBILITIES
These combined factors give the possibil
ity of invasion or civil war, or both, in
Greece, shortly after the British pull out. Yet
a possible preventative factor could be the
lessening of Russian pressure in Iran.
Russian statements in regard to that coun
try have not been as tough of late, and the
Soviet seemed to be trying to dodge the
Persian issue in the UNO by withdrawing
troops from Azerbaijan, rather than make a
show of force right now.
AMERICAN REACTION
Since Stalin's latest sorties, there has been
a rising feeling against the Soviet in Amer
ica, and the countries in the UNO which she
does not control have tended to line up
against her somewhat solidly.
Moscow might, at present, be thinking
that she is sacrificing her whole structure
of foreign relations for the sake of a few
scraps of territory, and therefore be inclined
to back down for the present.
There are thus factors acting as a negative
influence on the possibility of trouble in
Greece, and they might very welL predom
inate. But it seems that if a big test of power
between Russia and the western powers ever
begins, Greece will be one of the scenes
of it.
