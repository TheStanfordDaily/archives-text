KKIWCINCi INTERNATIONAL
TENSION

All of us are interested in the
role the U.S. must play in regard to
international affairs. It may be
profitable, therefore, to consider a
practical suggestion made hy news
paper correspondent Frank R. Kent.
He states, "We must get sufficiently
informed to become effectively
indignant about our < indefensible
state of affairs." Those are large
words, but they can he broken
down.
The present state of affairs is,
in a way, justifiable. There is in
the world today a spirit of impa
tience, a natural growth of war.
A physics student might call it a
"tension." And tensions have ex
isted before in history.
Historical tension never stands
still. It is either reduced by rational
action or increased to the explosion
point. The present tension prevails
in a world in which the forces are
not driving toward war because the
nations are sick of war and aware
of its results, and because none of
the nations can see any clear path
to winning a war.
The tension can advance to that
point, however, by creative strokes
of power politics or by letting it
drift, hoping it will cure itself.
In the case of our relations with
Russia, the line of action wc
should follow is that of using pa
tience, whittling down delusions,
suspicions, and hypocrisies, and
finding openings for Russia to
prove that its ambitions are justi
fied and limited. This would re
duce the tension.
It would appear (hat Russia has a
job in cooling off, soft-pedaling co
ercion, and acquiring a sense of
proportion.
While working to reduce the ten
sion it is also imperative that we
"get sufficiently informed" about
current international problems.
This must be done because the peo
ple themselves have such a great
stake in the peaceful solution to the
problems.
In the past, particularly, there
have been great barriers to our be
coming accurately informed of
events. International agreements
have been arrived at in secret ses
sions and any open discussions
have always had the tinge of high
sounding but vague language. In
addition to the difficulty experi
enced by the people in receiving the

| complete truth, publishers and ra
; dio-station owners have not helped
the situation. They have, instead,
proved too conscious of the money
profits derived from their appeals
to an uncritical public — a public
(which has been nurtured on funny,
j books, gossip columns, and singing
commercials.
Currently, the governments are
appealing more directly to the
people, or world opinion, and are
airing their disputes in an open
manner as in the Kevin-Visinsky
discussions a( the London UNO
| session. Hut we still have the
profit - conscious publishers and
radio - station owners reporting
world affairs with a snap and a
punch. Unfortunately, the truth
is often dull and many times not
to our liking. However, we must
he prepared to discern the truth
from the sensational.
Finally, we must look critically at
some of our own habits of thought
which tend to confuse our think
ing. These have included, among
other things, certain bugaboos or
J stereotypes which really indicate
I little more than inflexible and mal
adaptive minds. Some of the most
currently overworked stereotypes
are:
1. That victory in war and mem
bership in the UNO means perma
nent ceace.
2. That whatever a people does
j within its own borders is its own
! business.
3. That the millennium arrives
when raw materials and income are
evenly distributed among nations
; and men, respectively.
4. The most important, that hu
man nature is unchangeable.
In summary, by improving our
own techniques of reasoning and
hy distinguishing the truth from
the sensational in the press and
radio, we can ''become effectively
indignant." We can then bring
| constructive pressure to bear
| upon the press, radio, and gov
i eminent.
This would require a crystalliza
i tion of our interests into a large
pressure group of the majority of
i the people. In this way we could
i secure a foreign policy we want
! and also modify the machinery in
Washington by which the policy is
i to be made effective.
In (he final analysis the respon
sibility for the "state of affairs"
rests squarely on our shoulders.
