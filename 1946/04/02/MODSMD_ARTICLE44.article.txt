Judging from the number of sun-burt seen around, ap
parently Stanford folks absorbed a lot of sun during the 240 hours of
reprieve from collegiate ordeals.
How was the skiing?—The surf down south was just fine, thank you.
A little chilly, though. We saw more than one dash clown the sands to the
water and, when their little toe got wet, scream in anguish, mrying for
an electric heating pad. But it really wasn't that bad. I couldn't sight a
single icicle.

After throwing a lasso into various and sundry spots, the sports staff
is slowly being rounded up. "Hobblin' Al" Sciaroni, assistant sports edi
tor, is back. After a certain number of brickbats and violent curses are
thrown at this writer, Al lakes over Slants. When the coast is clear
again, this ''Underwood pecker" climbs out again, making bis noggin a
target for more punishment.
Also around is Stu Millar, expert in many fields, but especially base
ball. Stu will keep you posted on the activities of the Stanford diamond
eers.
Smiley Erwin Farkas also went through the Reg process for spring
quarter. Cinderpath news will hail from Smiley Erwin. If you happen
to see the name of S.E.F. in the Chronicle, don't think you're seeing
double. S.E.F. is Leiser's right-hand man on the Farm.
Back, also, is John Sabin, who is a little dejected because Portland has
lost a baseball game. He confidently predicted before the season started
that his beloved Beavers would go through the season undefeated.
We're still looking for the rest of the boys. Before too many days pass.
everything will be in fine shape again.

I caught a glimpse of coast baseball last weekend, and noticed an im
provement over the brand of ball performed last season, but the caliber
isn't of major league quality, which was what West Coast moguls
wanted.
It's hard, though, to compare ball this season with that of last. Just so
many clowns ran around in baseball togs last year, claiming they were
competent players, but actually weren't even good sand-lotters. That gang
of players are heading for the Western International League and the Cali
fornia circuit; both leagues in the lower brackets.
If the Pacific Coast Conference really wants to sponsor major league
baseball, they'll have to quit selling their stars to the majors, and also
recruit better talent. Just raising admission prices, which they have
done, won't make the present league a third mutfor league.

The first year is pretty tough. That is the story coming from all Stan
ford mentors. Other schools, with lettermen flocking about, are taking
Stanford in all events. Last quarterj it was basketball. Over vacation,
Harry Wolter's baseball squad took a triple beating in Los Angeles.
The current bright spot is Bob Anderson of the swimming squad. Mr.
A. is in the present process of breaking swimming titles, and before he
is through, his name will beVhalked up with many new records. More
on Anderson later.

If there are any students who have that journalistic urge, they are cor
dially invited to pay the sports office a visit this afternoon. Some spots
are open on the sports staff, and all "Damon Runyons and Tom Meanys"
are especially welcomed. Tea and crumpets will be served.

The first year is pretty tough. That is the story coming from all Stan
ford mentors. Other schools, with lettermen flocking about, are taking
Stanford in all events. Last quarterj it was basketball. Over vacation,
Harry Wolter's baseball squad took a triple beating in Los Angeles.
The current bright spot is Bob Anderson of the swimming squad. Mr.
A. is in the present process of breaking swimming titles, and before he
is through, his name will beVhalked up with many new records. More
on Anderson later.

If there are any students who have that journalistic urge, they are cor
dially invited to pay the sports office a visit this afternoon. Some spots
are open on the sports staff, and all "Damon Runyons and Tom Meanys"
are especially welcomed. Tea and crumpets will be served.
Judging from the number of sun-burt seen around, ap
parently Stanford folks absorbed a lot of sun during the 240 hours of
reprieve from collegiate ordeals.
How was the skiing?—The surf down south was just fine, thank you.
A little chilly, though. We saw more than one dash clown the sands to the
water and, when their little toe got wet, scream in anguish, mrying for
an electric heating pad. But it really wasn't that bad. I couldn't sight a
single icicle.

After throwing a lasso into various and sundry spots, the sports staff
is slowly being rounded up. "Hobblin' Al" Sciaroni, assistant sports edi
tor, is back. After a certain number of brickbats and violent curses are
thrown at this writer, Al lakes over Slants. When the coast is clear
again, this ''Underwood pecker" climbs out again, making bis noggin a
target for more punishment.
Also around is Stu Millar, expert in many fields, but especially base
ball. Stu will keep you posted on the activities of the Stanford diamond
eers.
Smiley Erwin Farkas also went through the Reg process for spring
quarter. Cinderpath news will hail from Smiley Erwin. If you happen
to see the name of S.E.F. in the Chronicle, don't think you're seeing
double. S.E.F. is Leiser's right-hand man on the Farm.
Back, also, is John Sabin, who is a little dejected because Portland has
lost a baseball game. He confidently predicted before the season started
that his beloved Beavers would go through the season undefeated.
We're still looking for the rest of the boys. Before too many days pass.
everything will be in fine shape again.

I caught a glimpse of coast baseball last weekend, and noticed an im
provement over the brand of ball performed last season, but the caliber
isn't of major league quality, which was what West Coast moguls
wanted.
It's hard, though, to compare ball this season with that of last. Just so
many clowns ran around in baseball togs last year, claiming they were
competent players, but actually weren't even good sand-lotters. That gang
of players are heading for the Western International League and the Cali
fornia circuit; both leagues in the lower brackets.
If the Pacific Coast Conference really wants to sponsor major league
baseball, they'll have to quit selling their stars to the majors, and also
recruit better talent. Just raising admission prices, which they have
done, won't make the present league a third mutfor league.
