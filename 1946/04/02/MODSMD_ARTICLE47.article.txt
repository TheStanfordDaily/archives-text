# Bruins, Trojans Smash Indians To Annex Four Straight Games
## 
### 
Stanford's Varsity baseball team
will arrive in Palo Alto today a lit
tle worse for the wear. Reason:
four straight losses to the Bruin and
Trojan nines within a seven-day pe
riod.
The Uclans had their batting eyes
on the afternoon that they lacked
pitching and produced an outstand
ing hurler when the swatters were
missing. As a result, they eked out
a 2 to 1 win in the first game of the
series behind the three-hit pitching
of Joe Heinan and came back the
next afternoon to slam three Farm
hurlers for 16 blows of assorted va
riety and trample the locals 17 to 10.
Pliil Wolf Outstanding
Outstanding for the Farm in the
first contest was Phil Wolf. Although
a little wild for the first few frames,
he settled down to pitch heady and
well-controlled ball. He allowed only
four hits. A tight battle all the way
between the two pitchers, the game
went all nine innings without an er
ror. This is an unusual fact in the
light of the Farm's first ball game
against S.C.
Probably a little nervous after
reading the comments of the Los
Angeles press on the Trojan horse
hiders—class, hitting power, great
fielders, fine pitching and more class
—the Cards were unable to find most
of the balls that were hit to them.
The result was thirteen Stanford er
rors and a 15 to 7 ball game for
Troy. Stanford's hurling staff al
lowed only eight bingles to the op
position but the poor support, par
ticularly by the infield, forfeited any
chance for the game. Sole consola
tion was the five-run splurge by the
Indians in the first inning, momen
tarily catapulting them into the lead

agfainst a team that had dropped
close contents only to such teams as
the St. Louis Browns and Los An
geles Angels.
Play on Wet Field
Rained out for a few days, the sec
ond game of the series was played
yesterday afternoon on a slightly
soggy diamond. Phil Wolf came back
after four full days' rest to battle
Bishop, the Trojan pitcher, for four
teen innings before dropping the tilt
by the score to 5 to 4. Both pitchers
went the route.
Aside from the miserable fielding
of the locals, not too much can be
found wrong with the Stanford nine.
Lack of depth in the pitching staff is
noticeable. After Wolf there is a
sharp drop in quality and even the

quantity is spare. Hitting has been
fine. A real batting star (he also is
a smart receiver and a good target)
has been uncovered in Frank Mc-
Graw.
Estimates
Carl Kellenberger, an experienced
flyhavvk. has yet to find his stride.
His hitting has been consistently
good but his work in the field has
been erratic. Dick Ahlquist and
George Sloat seem destined for the
other two outer garden posts. Ahl
i quist, converted from a catcher, has
| batted well.
The infield combination of Morgan
Miller on first, Tom Howard on sec
-1 ond. Bob Peters at short, and Larry
1 Prato at third could stand much
I sharpening.

I sharpening.
Stanford's Varsity baseball team
will arrive in Palo Alto today a lit
tle worse for the wear. Reason:
four straight losses to the Bruin and
Trojan nines within a seven-day pe
riod.
The Uclans had their batting eyes
on the afternoon that they lacked
pitching and produced an outstand
ing hurler when the swatters were
missing. As a result, they eked out
a 2 to 1 win in the first game of the
series behind the three-hit pitching
of Joe Heinan and came back the
next afternoon to slam three Farm
hurlers for 16 blows of assorted va
riety and trample the locals 17 to 10.
Pliil Wolf Outstanding
Outstanding for the Farm in the
first contest was Phil Wolf. Although
a little wild for the first few frames,
he settled down to pitch heady and
well-controlled ball. He allowed only
four hits. A tight battle all the way
between the two pitchers, the game
went all nine innings without an er
ror. This is an unusual fact in the
light of the Farm's first ball game
against S.C.
Probably a little nervous after
reading the comments of the Los
Angeles press on the Trojan horse
hiders—class, hitting power, great
fielders, fine pitching and more class
—the Cards were unable to find most
of the balls that were hit to them.
The result was thirteen Stanford er
rors and a 15 to 7 ball game for
Troy. Stanford's hurling staff al
lowed only eight bingles to the op
position but the poor support, par
ticularly by the infield, forfeited any
chance for the game. Sole consola
tion was the five-run splurge by the
Indians in the first inning, momen
tarily catapulting them into the lead

agfainst a team that had dropped
close contents only to such teams as
the St. Louis Browns and Los An
geles Angels.
Play on Wet Field
Rained out for a few days, the sec
ond game of the series was played
yesterday afternoon on a slightly
soggy diamond. Phil Wolf came back
after four full days' rest to battle
Bishop, the Trojan pitcher, for four
teen innings before dropping the tilt
by the score to 5 to 4. Both pitchers
went the route.
Aside from the miserable fielding
of the locals, not too much can be
found wrong with the Stanford nine.
Lack of depth in the pitching staff is
noticeable. After Wolf there is a
sharp drop in quality and even the

quantity is spare. Hitting has been
fine. A real batting star (he also is
a smart receiver and a good target)
has been uncovered in Frank Mc-
Graw.
Estimates
Carl Kellenberger, an experienced
flyhavvk. has yet to find his stride.
His hitting has been consistently
good but his work in the field has
been erratic. Dick Ahlquist and
George Sloat seem destined for the
other two outer garden posts. Ahl
i quist, converted from a catcher, has
| batted well.
The infield combination of Morgan
Miller on first, Tom Howard on sec
-1 ond. Bob Peters at short, and Larry
1 Prato at third could stand much
I sharpening.
