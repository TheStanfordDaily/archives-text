â€¢Hobby of Shut-in
Harold H. Fisher, director of the
Hoover Library, and Ralph H. Lutz,
former director, who received the
books in person from Miss Ram
stead, termed them "the finest we
have ever seen."
Miss Ramstead was a Red Cross
nurse who was disabled in France
during World War I. Her collection
started in November, 1936, as the
hobby of a shut-in, who, in the light
of conflicts in China and Spain,
sensed the rumblings of another
world war. Her hobby grew into a
war service, which was climaxed
this week by her "great happiness
in placing the result of many thou
sands of hours of work where it
will be preserved and used in re
search and study."
Almost 150 Volumes
During the nearly 10 years of
work on her books, Miss Ramstead
received double subscriptions to
the Los Angeles Times, Life and
Newsweek magazines. In this way
she insured possible clippings on
both sides of one page. She utilized
a'rticles, photographs, and maps
from those three publications only
in compiling the books.

than 20 pages each, include 34 books
