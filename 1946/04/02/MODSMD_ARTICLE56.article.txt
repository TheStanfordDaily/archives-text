# 'The Three Strangers' Is Philosopher's Holiday

THE THREE STRANGERS — Now
playing at the Stanford Theater
Warner Brothers' "The Three
Strangers" is an unusual film in
that it presents three different plots
joined by an extremely weak con
necting link—a ticket on a race
horse.
Chinese Idol
The story begins as Geraldine
Fitzgerald lures, by rather devious

methods, Poler
Lorre and Sid
ney Greenstrcet
from the streets
up to her apart
ment. There, in
stead of the old
badger game
taking place, sfye
tells them thai
Kwan Yin, an
ancient Chinese
idol, will grant

the three a wish. They decide upon
the winning of fa rich sweepstakes
as their goal.
The individual stories then begin:
Miss Fitzgerald's one of jealousy;
Lorre's of drink; and Greenstreet's
of lust for money. Bizarre things
befall the trio until they are re
united to hear the running of the
sweepstakes.
Characterization
Miss Fitzgerald is a magnetic, vi
vacious personality and does much
to clarify the muddled picture. Pe
ter Lorre, the irresponsible little
drunk who is framed for murder,
proves convmciro'. I wish the same
could be said for Greenscreet, for
his actions are both inconsistent
and confusing.
"The Three Strangers" reveals
flashes of illumination, but more
often the film is garbled by mean
ingless dialogue, fantastic situa
tions, and ludicrous reactions to
these situations. The film could well
have been scripted by a philosophy
major enjoying a busman's holiday,
so much is it glutted by profound
but. hollow generalizations.
"Gertie's Garter"
"Getting Gertie's Garter," billed
as a second feature, is superior to
the main attraction, if only for the
fact that it is racy. Marie Mac Do
nald and Dennis O'Keefe sneak in and
out of each other's bedrooms with
amazing alacrity and carry on an
engaging banter that should prove
offensive to only the more prudish
members of the audience.
The dialogue gets a bit rough in
spots (i.e., "Napoleon gave 'it' to
Josephine," the"IT" never being
classified). You may get tired of
everybody in the cast (which also
includes Barry Sullivan, Binnie

Barnes, and J. Cjutoll Naish)
traipsing in and out of each other's
bedrooms and screaming at each
other, but more likely you will be
mildly surprised at this bit of flufl.
—Oh, yes, we almost forget to men
tion that Miss Mac Donald certainly
deserves her title of "The Body." I
don't know how she does it. —Dick
Bower
