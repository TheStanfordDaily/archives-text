NYLON exists today because of curi
osity—the curiosity of a group of
Du Pont chemists who wanted to know
more about polymerization, that strange
process by which small molecules of a
chemical unite to form larger molecules
with entirely new and different chemi
cal properties.
Du Pont chemists began a study of
polymerization in 1928. They experi
mented with dibasic acids and within
two years had succeeded in forming
polyesters with molecular weights up to
25,000. In the spring of 1930, on remov
ing one of these "superpolymers" from
the molecular still, one of the chemists
noted that it could be drawn out into a
thin strand, like taffy candy. But, un
like taffy, it was not brittle when cooled.
In fact, the cooled strand could be
further drawn out to several times its
former length and when so drawn be
came not only stronger but elastic!
This original ester polymer had a low
melting point and was sensitive to water.
Nevertheless, it suggested that some re
lated type of polymer might produce
libers which would be of practical use
in textiles.
Numerous superpolymers were syn
thesized and tested. Finally, in 1935, a
polyamide was prepared. From it, the
first nylon filaments were made—by
forcing the molten polymer through a
hypodermic needle!
Nylon Polymer Developed
Further experimental work resulted in
the development of a polymer that pos
sessed the desired characteristics. This
material was later christened nylon.
Put the job was not yet done. Re
search chemists—particularly physical
chemists—and chemical engineers were
called upon to devise practical methods
for making the polymer and for spinning
and drawing it into high-quality yarn.
Mechanical engineers were given the
task of designing plant equipment to
carry out the processes. Organic chem
ists were required to develop new dyeing
agents and to find a size to make knitting
possible. At one time or another more
than 230 research men, engineers and
marketing specialists worked on the
giant task of converting this child of
chemical curiosity into a marketable
product.
