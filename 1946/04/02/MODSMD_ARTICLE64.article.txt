# RESEARCH LOWERS PRICE OF SYNTHETIC UREA
## 
### 
Lower prices, as well as new processes,
can result from intensive research. Take
synthetic urea, for example. In 1930,
urea sold for about 80(5 a pound. Great
promise was held for this compound as
an industrial chemical for fertilizer and
plastic use—if an inexpensive manufac
turing process could be found.
By methods then in use, ammonia
and carbon dioxide were heated to
about 150° C., forming urea and water
in equilibrium with the unconverted
original compounds. The yield of urea
was approximately 43%.
Research by Du Pont chemists and
engineers showed that, by adjusting the
proportions of the reactants, raising the
temperature and increasing the pressure,
conversion could be improved materi
ally. But the corrosive mixture resulting
quickly chewed up the best grades of
steel available.
Long investigation by metallurgists,
chemists and chemical engineers finally
produced an autoclave in which the
operation could be carried on a produc
tion basis. Today, Du Pont is able to
sell synthetic urea for less than a

pound. Men of Du Pont: take pride in
the fact that their work has made it
possible to reduce the price of urea
from the "drug" class to a level where it
can be used as a fertilizer bv the farmer.
