# REG RECORDS BROKEN
## New Two-Day Procedure Shortens Waiting Lines 
### 
The new registration procedure
which allows (wo days for registra
tion has succeeded in making pos
sible only a minimum of waiting in
lines, according to John M. Stal
naker, Dean of Students.
Procedural Changes
The greatest change and success
was in the Veterans' registration
procedure. Veterans who were reg
istered winter quarter did not even
have to report to the Dean of Stu
dents Office, according to Shelton L.
Bcatty, assistant to the Dean of Stu
dents on Veterans Records. Their
book requisitions and credit-identifi
cation card were inserted in their
registration book and they could reg
ister immediately.
New veterans were divided into
groups to facilitate the explanation
of registration to them. Group I con
sisted of those men who had their
certificates of Eligibilty in hand;
Group 11, those who had applied but
with no certificates; and Group 111
(a) those with certificates already
turned into the University, and (b)
Vocational Rehabilitation men.
Surprise!
At 9 a.m. there were 400 new vet
erans and old returning veterans
waiting in Room 214, Mr. Beatty
said. "We were worried then," he
said, "but by 10:45 there was no line
and the lines remained small the rest
of the day."
A representative of the Veterans
Administration was in the next room
and cooperated with the University
in registering the men.
Short Lines
Lines for civilian students were
much shorter than before, Dean Stal
naker said. The procedure for pay
ing tuition is practically perfect.
