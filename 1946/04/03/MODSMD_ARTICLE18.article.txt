# Greene Denies Slander Of Western Students
## 
### 
Stating that he had been quoted
completely out of context, Dr. The
odore M. Greene, Stanford's visiting
professor of humanities, yesterday
denied that he had called Western
students "completely illiterate and
inarticulate" in a discussion follow
ing a meeting of the Los Angeles
Town Ilall last week.
Dr. Greene, whose alleged state
ment caused a furor among West
Coast educators, told the Daily in
an exclusive interview yesterday
that he had "never found brighter,
more enthusiastic, and more indus
trious students" than he had on the
West Coast. He pointed out, how
ever, that most Western college
students are "very poorly trained
in high school" and this, he said,
was the idea he had tried to con
vey in Los Angeles.
High Schools Poor
Asked, during the discussion
which followed the Los Angeles
Town Hall meeting last Wednesday
evening, how Western students
compared with the men he had pre
viously taught at Princeton, Dr.
Greene replied that the Western
high schools had simply failed to
teach their students "to read

straight prose accurately and to ex
press themselves in writing cogent
ly." This he considered a "shock
ing weakness" of Western educa
tion. Western students did seem to
him in this respect relatively "il
literate and inarticulate."
Dr. Greene also noted that many
Western students had great diffi
culty in following a careful lecture
and in taking accurate notes.
"In making these statements," he
said, "I fully realize the problem
that Western high schools face, with
most of their students not going on
to college. I also realize that there
are very few preparatory schools on
the West Coast—BUT, the net re
sult is that the average student does
not get the pre-college training
that he does in the East."
More Preparation Needed
Dr. Greene added that in general
he preferred the "democratic high
school to the privileged prep school,
provided the high school offers able
students rigorous pre-college work."
He also stated that literally hun
dreds of teachers on the West Coast
had confirmed his judgment in this
matter and that he had "heard doz
ens of parents complain bitterly on
this score."
Defending Western students, Dr.
Greene nevertheless maintained
that the over-all pre-college work
in the East was superior to that in
the West. He felt strongly that the
West was making real efforts to
make pre-college study worthy of
the high ability of Western stu
dents.

Greene nevertheless maintained
that the over-all pre-college work
in the East was superior to that in
the West. He felt strongly that the
West was making real efforts to
make pre-college study worthy of
the high ability of Western stu
dents.
Stating that he had been quoted
completely out of context, Dr. The
odore M. Greene, Stanford's visiting
professor of humanities, yesterday
denied that he had called Western
students "completely illiterate and
inarticulate" in a discussion follow
ing a meeting of the Los Angeles
Town Ilall last week.
Dr. Greene, whose alleged state
ment caused a furor among West
Coast educators, told the Daily in
an exclusive interview yesterday
that he had "never found brighter,
more enthusiastic, and more indus
trious students" than he had on the
West Coast. He pointed out, how
ever, that most Western college
students are "very poorly trained
in high school" and this, he said,
was the idea he had tried to con
vey in Los Angeles.
High Schools Poor
Asked, during the discussion
which followed the Los Angeles
Town Hall meeting last Wednesday
evening, how Western students
compared with the men he had pre
viously taught at Princeton, Dr.
Greene replied that the Western
high schools had simply failed to
teach their students "to read

straight prose accurately and to ex
press themselves in writing cogent
ly." This he considered a "shock
ing weakness" of Western educa
tion. Western students did seem to
him in this respect relatively "il
literate and inarticulate."
Dr. Greene also noted that many
Western students had great diffi
culty in following a careful lecture
and in taking accurate notes.
"In making these statements," he
said, "I fully realize the problem
that Western high schools face, with
most of their students not going on
to college. I also realize that there
are very few preparatory schools on
the West Coast—BUT, the net re
sult is that the average student does
not get the pre-college training
that he does in the East."
More Preparation Needed
Dr. Greene added that in general
he preferred the "democratic high
school to the privileged prep school,
provided the high school offers able
students rigorous pre-college work."
He also stated that literally hun
dreds of teachers on the West Coast
had confirmed his judgment in this
matter and that he had "heard doz
ens of parents complain bitterly on
this score."
Defending Western students, Dr.
Greene nevertheless maintained
that the over-all pre-college work
in the East was superior to that in
the West. He felt strongly that the
West was making real efforts to
make pre-college study worthy of
the high ability of Western stu
