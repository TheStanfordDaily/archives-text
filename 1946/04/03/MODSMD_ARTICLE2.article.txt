# New Tidal Waves Hammer Alaska; Hawaii Announces Semi-Emergency
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, April 2 (UP).—A new tidal wave, generated by diminishing Aleutian earth
quakes, smashed at the Alaska Peninsula today in the second day of a Pacific Ocean disaster that
wrought havoc throughout the Hawaiian islands and killed at least 141 persons, 30 of whom were
missing and assumed dead.
At least 10,000 were rendered homeless in the Hawaiian group by the fury of mountainous

breakers that inflicted millions of 4
dollars damage on shipping and |
shoreline property. It was feared j
the toll of dead and missing in the i
Hawaii territory and the Aleutians
may exceed 300.

lIILO, T.H., April 2 (UP).—A
state oi semi-emergency was de
clared today on the stricken is
land of Hawaii, hardest hit of the !
territorial group, and the toll of
dead and missing from tidal J
waves which left thousands of
homeless mounted to K5O
throughout the islands.
The Army assumed complete
control of the devastated city of j
Hilo after Gov. Ingram Stainhack
in Honolulu invoked the Hawai
ian defense act and armed mili
tary police were posted at every
intersection to prevent looting of
the broken and twisted establish
ments in this second largest city i
of the islands.

Heavy rollers, four to five feet
above normal tide level, began
striking the Northern California
coastline at minute intervals at 8:15 ]
a.m. PST. The heavy waves and ti- |
dal disturbances disrupted fishing I
operations and caused alerts at vul- |
nerable points along the shore north i
and south of San Francisco.
A huge wall of water hit the
shoreline at Dutch Harbor, site of
a U.S. naval base on Unalaska Is
land in the mid-Aleutians. First
reports did not disclose heavy dam
age. }
Pilots evacuated GO women and
children from the Alaska Peninsula
fishing village of Naknek after a j
Navy pilot radioed from above the i
Bering Sea that a tidal wave was \
sweeping northeastward into Bris-j
tol Bay. Later pilots said waters of l
Bristol Bay, Alaska's salmon fishing ;
center, had receded to record low j
levels.
