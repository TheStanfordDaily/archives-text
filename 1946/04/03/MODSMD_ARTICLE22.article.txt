# Mentor Predicts Industry To Use Atomic Energy Soon

### 
Speaking before the Roosevelt-Willkic Club at the North Palo Alto Li
brary yesterday noon, Paul H. Stanford professor of physics,
stated that atomic energy can be harnessed for non-military uses in peace
time industry within the next ten years.
Mr. Kirkpatrick pointed out that the lieat generated by an atomic reac-

tion could be used in like manner
;ts that produces by existing proc
esses. The speed of the reaction can
be slowed down and the violence
diminished and controlled by using
uranium and plutonium containing
certain impurities.
The speaker wen) on to say that
the probability of harnessing atom
ic energy as a source of automotive
power is remote because the power
unit would be too massive to in
stall, owing in part to the necessity
of shielding it to prevent emission
of radiations harmful to humans.
However, Mr. Kirkpatrick asserted
that for use in stationary power
plants atomic energy has poten
tially great usefulness.
