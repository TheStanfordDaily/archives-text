# Earning Your Board Isn't Easy, Brother
## 
### 
So you want to earn part of your way
through the University? We can tell you
what might happen:
You try to get a hashing j&b, since your
course?, leave you very little free time other
than the meal hours. Down to the Student
Employment office you go, with visions
of a neat little job scraping dishes for Roble
queens, or whatsoever. But no soap, brother,
be duse hashing has become the Occupation
Hardest To Get on campus.
The next move, you think, is to get a
hashing job somewhere off campus for which
ycu get your meals free, and then to have
your University board fee canceled. But
right there is the joker. Every student must
pay his board unless he hashes at a Univer
sity residence. *
It looks as if you're out of luck, out of a
job, out of dough.

Wouldn't it be possible for the Adminis
tration to waive the rule which denies some
students the chance to earn money which
they need to be able to attend Stanford?
We can see why hashing jobs on campus
should be filled first before exceptions are
made; but surely when students cannot work
for their meals here, they should be allowed
to work and eat off campus. At this point
only men for whom there is no room in Uni
versity dining halls can do so and be excused
from paying their board fee.
The small percentage of students who
want and need this change in the rules
would not be likely to upset the dining hall
plans in any residence, particularly when
eating facilites on campus are so much in
demand for men students, off campus, and
graduate students.
That small percentage should be given a
better deal, and soon.
