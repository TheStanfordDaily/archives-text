# Three New Columnists, Yet
## 
### 
Editorial Board of Volume 109 is most
happy to announce that columnists, three in
number, have been added to the list of those
who wear their names on the Daily masthead
and who wear dov/n their own particular
paths to the Daily Shack.
The latest additions to plunk a typewriter
for the Peninsula's Only Morning Newspaper
are Bill Steif, Ralph Hovis, and Stan Shpet
ner.
Bill Steif was formerly a Daily associate
editor and is back with us, taking over His
tory, 1946 on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday
of each week, as well as holding down a
night editor's job.
Ralph Hovis, who will write a series of ten
weekly comments on current events under
the apt title of "It Concerns You," is a grad

uate student in Political Science. Look for his
column next Monday on "Iran—Oil, Water,
and Russia."
"Who Told You?" Stan Shpetner wants to
know. Sample the first offering below of his
new column which will hit the campus Mon
days, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Stan tells
us he's been connected with The Daily Illini
(University of Illinois), the Daily Cardinal
(University of Wisconsin), The Wisconsin
Octopus (Alleged Humor Magazine), The
Stanford Chaparral, and the monthly news
paper of lones Jr. High School, Toled®, Ohio
in capacities ranging from "boy who was
sent out for cokes" to "editor."
And that hardy perennial, "Bull Session"
will be with your Cellar coffee Monday
through Friday, courtesy of H. D. Thoreau.
