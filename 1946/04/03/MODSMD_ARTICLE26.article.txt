### H.D. THOREAU 
Today we will discuss the tidal wave.
One of the boys in the kitchen yesterday
noon said that it was somebody's fault off the
Aleutians. Another boy said that 133 young
buoys in Hilo were lost, and someone else
added that a guy walking along the beach at
Santa Cruz was swept out to sea.
At this point Eula, our cook, suggested that
one of the boys sweep out the kitchen. Eula
added that she had only been over the Bay
Bridge oncei n her life and she wouldn't go
again even if she had to go over it to get to
Heaven —and she wants to go to Heaven
very much.
Still another of the boys bragged that he
had seen one once. This tidal wave was 45
feet high, moved quite rapidly and had a
very steep angle of inclination. We men
tioned that we had seen a wave on Market

street, about 5 feet 6, moving quite rapidly,
but with apparently no inclination at all.
* * *
The citizenry at Carmel have asked Stan
lord and California students not to come
down to their town any more, because the
students are too rowdy.
* * *
Don't despair, boys. The ratio down at
San Jose State is still 4 girls to 1 student. . . .
We would like to become the campus repre
sentative for Ipana tooth paste. Try it. It
tastes better. ... All you horse lovers please
sign up out at the Red Barn if you want to
join the big four-day overland ride down to
Los Angeles next week to see Hatsushimo,
Emperor Hirohito's famous white horse, at
Lt. Dick Ryan's Rodeo and Thrill Circus at
the Coliseum.
