Foist awreday is today nothing but complaints.
What does this joker Stilwell ' know about the
army caste system? We was in the Quartermaster
corp in Philly for two years and I never heard of
Ihc bum. lie says that "enlisted men get better
food tn&n officers."
He also says "I've been wandering around this
man's army for 46 years and I know what I'm talk
ing about." Well, that's enough l'or us. We doubt
that any man who has been in the army for 4(>
years could discuss any subject, and know what
he is talking about.
We saw Elliot "Red Menace - ' Epsteen putting
throe black dogs on the steps of the Woman's Club
house. They may fool you, old boy, but we got it
from the inside. Them dogs are SOVIET RED
AGENTS infiltrating to gain secret maps of the
Salinas lettuce fields.
Wednesday is "ASSU-day."
Although the ASSU president is regarded as
leader of the ASSU the real power rests not with
him, but with the ASSU student manager. Boss of
a one hundred thousand dollar business, the man
ager controls everything from the purchase of fresh
paint for the Gaieties to buying postage stamps for
the CHAPARRAL.
The manager is not chosen by the students nor by
their elected representatives, but by Mr. Al Mas
tors. Although Mi-. Masters no longer is callcd
Graduate Manager he still handles the work of

that office. We are not questioning his ability to
pick an able ASSU manager.
What rankles the seat of our tweed trousers is
that so many Stanford students think that their
elected representatives run their student life. (That
is, those that bother to vote.)
Either the administration should run things—
and they no doubt can handle the situation —or they
should let the student government be built up to
what it appears to be.
What difference does it make who runs the stu
dent affairs as long as they get run? We ask our
selves the question, and like a flash back comes the
answer. Not a bit of difference, Harold. Not a bit.
But the student who is taught to harbor a dull
and apathetic political mind, where student affairs
are concerned, will carry on the feeling to the larger
community and won't even know enough to put on
lead shorts when they start tossing radio activity
around.
BY THE WAY ZIP. What difference does it make
if you did tout "Pea Soup." You gotta bet on em
before they pay off.
We don't blame the Daily Night Editor for head
lining "REG RECORDS BROKEN" and then giving
the tidal wave story about three inches. Although
the tidal toll already has reached 300 the editor was
just following the policy her boss had set down.
And the boss set it down because it is for the reader.
And at Stanford we don't recognize nuttin', unless
it happens AT LEAST as near as Palm drive.

Wednesday is "ASSU-day."
Although the ASSU president is regarded as
leader of the ASSU the real power rests not with
him, but with the ASSU student manager. Boss of
a one hundred thousand dollar business, the man
ager controls everything from the purchase of fresh
paint for the Gaieties to buying postage stamps for
the CHAPARRAL.
The manager is not chosen by the students nor by
their elected representatives, but by Mr. Al Mas
tors. Although Mi-. Masters no longer is callcd
Graduate Manager he still handles the work of

that office. We are not questioning his ability to
pick an able ASSU manager.
What rankles the seat of our tweed trousers is
that so many Stanford students think that their
elected representatives run their student life. (That
is, those that bother to vote.)
Either the administration should run things—
and they no doubt can handle the situation —or they
should let the student government be built up to
what it appears to be.
What difference does it make who runs the stu
dent affairs as long as they get run? We ask our
selves the question, and like a flash back comes the
answer. Not a bit of difference, Harold. Not a bit.
But the student who is taught to harbor a dull
and apathetic political mind, where student affairs
are concerned, will carry on the feeling to the larger
community and won't even know enough to put on
lead shorts when they start tossing radio activity
around.
BY THE WAY ZIP. What difference does it make
if you did tout "Pea Soup." You gotta bet on em
before they pay off.
We don't blame the Daily Night Editor for head
lining "REG RECORDS BROKEN" and then giving
the tidal wave story about three inches. Although
the tidal toll already has reached 300 the editor was
just following the policy her boss had set down.
And the boss set it down because it is for the reader.
And at Stanford we don't recognize nuttin', unless
it happens AT LEAST as near as Palm drive.
Foist awreday is today nothing but complaints.
What does this joker Stilwell ' know about the
army caste system? We was in the Quartermaster
corp in Philly for two years and I never heard of
Ihc bum. lie says that "enlisted men get better
food tn&n officers."
He also says "I've been wandering around this
man's army for 46 years and I know what I'm talk
ing about." Well, that's enough l'or us. We doubt
that any man who has been in the army for 4(>
years could discuss any subject, and know what
he is talking about.
