### 
"The True Glory," a film which
told the story of the allied prepara
tion, invasion, and campaign in Eu
rope, opened the spring quarter
Tuesday Evening Series last night in
Memorial Auditorium.
Prepared and filmed through the
War Department and the Office of
War Information, "The True Glory"
represents one of the fine documen
tary movies of World War If.
Begins with Preparation
The story behind "The True Glory"
begins with the preparation for the
invasion and campaign. The prep
aration is the work of armies from
all countries, their leaders, the Brit
ish people working in the factories,
of the American and British navies,
the air forces, and research workers.
The channel tides, the weather, and
even the sands on the beaches of
France are tested in readiness for the
big push on D-Day.
Moved by Train
The armies are moved up by train
and truck and loaded on the ships,
then the wait, and finally the day
when 80,000 ships are massed off the
shores of Normandy. The invasion is
on. The beachheads are secured, but
the campaign waits until all the
beachheads are united in a 45-mile
front.
The rest of the film is the por
trayal of the actual action of Brit
ish, American, Canadian, Czech,
French, Polish, and other troops of
the United Nations as together they
drove across France, Belgium, the
Netherlands, and Germany until the
fall of Berlin and the union with the
Russian troops.
I lard sh ips En tonn te red
The hardships encountered in the
capture of Cherbourg, Caen, Saint
Lo, Mortain, Paris, and Brussels are
shown vividly. In Metz the cam
paign bogs down as the troops run
out of gas. At Arnheim the air
borne troops fight a losing battle in
an attempt to outflank the Sieg
fried Line.
Then follow the difficulties of the
winter campaign, the battle of the
"bulge", the crossing of the Rhine,
and finally the troops cross the
Rhine "without getting their feet wet
at the courtesy of the 9th Army Di
vision."
See Damage Done
Throughout the film one sees the
damage done to European cities, the
people who waited for the day of
liberation, the welcomes for the vic
torious troops, the surrendering of
the German troops, the conditions of
the prisoners in the war camps and
the imported slave laborers.
At all times it is clear that the
campaign could not have been suc
cessfully completed without the co
operation of all the United Nations,
their troops, navies, and air forces,
their leaders and supplies. In the
background of the film the voices of
the men and women of all the na
tions who worked to win the cam
paign portrayed that need to work
together both for war and peace.â€”
