TEHRAN. April 2 (UP). â€”The
first Russian forces actually to
leave Iran have crossed the border
into the Soviet Union from their
garrison post at Meshed, 400 miles
cast of Tehran, the Iranian govern
ment announced today.
The government announcement,
which coincided with a similar one
by official British sources, said the
Russians crossed the frontier into
the Soviet Turkoman republic at
Quchan and were headed for Ash
qhabad, in Russian territory 125
miles northwest of Meshed.
Other Russian troops formerly
stationed at Shahrud, 200 miles
northeast of Tehran, embarked on
transports at the southeastern Cas
pian Sea port of Bandar Shah, the
announcement said.
Three transports recently seen at
the Caspian port of Pahlevi also
reportedly steamed off, carrying
troops from Kazvin into Russian
waters to the north.
These were the first reports from
any source that Soviet troops oc
cupying Iran actually had left the
country in keeping with the Mos
cow evacuation announcement, al
though previous reports had told of
movements and preparations to de
part.
It was announced that 200 Rus
sian soldiers remained behind in
Meshed to pack remaining Russian
stores, but that the main Russian
garrison had gone.
