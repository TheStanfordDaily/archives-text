# Truman Bill Compromise
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 2 (UP).â€”
Administration leaders and Senate
opponents of President Truman's
national minimum wage bill today
reached virtual agreement on rais
ing minimum wages from the pres
ent 40 cents an hour to GO cents.
The increase would mark a par
tial defeat for Mr. Truman, who
asked that the floor be raised to G5
cents immediately, to 70 cents with
in two years, and* to 75 cents two
years later.
Opposing Senate groups failed to
agree on whether the present law
should be broadened to cover 3,500,-
000 additional workers, principally
chain store employees. About 20,-
000,000 workers are now covered by
the 40-cent law.
Conferees Agree
The conferees agreed that they
would let the Senate vote on an
amendment to strike out 'the ex
tended coverage before bringing up
a vote on the compromise w;\ge
scale.
Sen. Allen J. Ellender, D., La.,
said he would offer tomorrow a
compromise fixing the wage at GO
cents an hour effective nine months
after the bill becomes law. He pre
viously had sponsored with Sen.
Joseph H. Ball, R., Minn., a grad
uated scale starting at 55 cents, in
creasing to 60 cents at the end of
18 months.
Compromise Reached
The compromise was reached in
an effort to defeat a previously
adopted amendment by Sen. Rich
ard B. Russell, D., Ga., which would
require the government to include
farm labor costs in computing farm
parity prices. Administration offi
cials said it would put the cost of
living out of bounds.
President Truman warned the
House before it approved the pro
viso that he would veto the bill if
it is retained.
