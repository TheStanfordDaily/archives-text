# Union Calls Mass Meet
## 
### 
DETROIT, April 2 (UP).â€”Union
leaders of striking Detroit transit
workers announced today a mass
meeting of the 5,200 operators has
been called for tomorrow.
The officials refused to disclose i
whether the workers would be asked j
to end the two-day citywide transit
tie-up immediately but said there I
was nothing in the call to prevent a j
return to work vote No time or
place for the meeting was an- j
nounced. j
James McGinnity, organizer for !
the international union, said the
meeting had been called partly at
the request of some of the striking
operators and partly as a "morale
builder." He said "we really haven't
got anything new to offer the boys." j
Mayor Edward J. Jeffries, Jr., who
has been acting as spokesman for the
municipally-owned transit system, !
warned the strikers previously that j
the only offer the city would make
was arbitration of the union's de- j
mands for an 18-cent hourly pay !
boost and would offer that only when !
the men went back to work.
Jeffries, sticking grimly to his "no
work, no-negotiations" policy, turned
down a proposal offered earlier to
day by the international officers. Un
der it, workers would have accepted |
a 15-cent hourly pay boost with re- j
maining wage issues to be arbi- 1
trated.
