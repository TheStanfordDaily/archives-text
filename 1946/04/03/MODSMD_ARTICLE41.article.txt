# Showers Plague League Openers
## 
### 
Chief topic of conversation in
Pacific Coast League baseball circles
following last • weekend's curtain
raiser seems to avoid the actual
standings and concentrates upon
the March rains which plagued the
Coasters. Inaugural days found two
bailiwicks handing out rain checks,
saddening indeed for ambitious
owners who had envisioned the
fans knocking down fences to view
their darlings. No !c,ss than four
contests were postponed by the in
clement weather.
Seals Like Islands
Meanwhile Lefty O'Doul's sun
tanned Seals testified to the won
ders of Hawaiian conditioning by
sneaking into first place with a
spotless record over the three-game
stretch. The easy manner by which
the San Francisco entry subdued
the Seattle Rainiers amazed even
the most rabid Seal fans and served
as a warning to the favored Los
Angeles club. But the sketchy pres
ent standings mean little in evalu
ating the teams, as P.C.L. managers
jugyle their squads in search of a
winning combination. The Angels
continue to hold top billing as the

"team most likely to succeed" as a
direct result of Chicago Cub back
ing, but Portland and San Fran
cisco are expected 'to press the
Southerners right down to the wire.
Stanza number two in the '46
scramble unfolds this week with
Oakland opening at home against
Portland while the Seals journey to
San Diego. Attention will be cen
tered upon Los Angeles, where the
Seattle Rainiers will attempt to sal
vage their prestige against the An
gels. The Sacramento and Holly
wood game rounds out the schedule
at the home of the Stars. —Bullock
