The current squabble between
Joe Pasquel's Mexican Baseball
League and the two pro leagues in
the United States has furnished ex
cellent material for sports scrib
blers throughout the country, so I
can't see any reason for not wasting
some paragraphs on the stitched
:ipricot subject that has reached
proportions of international gran
deur.
Bay Area writers, notably Pres
cott Sullivan and Will Connally,
have taken up the cudgels for the
Mexican league, saying they don't
blame baseball performers for
going south of the Rio Grande,
if it means more to their bank
account. Athletes' playing days
are limited, and it's either grab
bing the peaches when they are
ripe, or watching the fruit rot
away on the branches.
The only catch to the whole affair
with Senor Pasquel is that nobody
really knows how strong his fi
nances are. Or rather, if he is in
earnest about shelling out the as
tronomical figures he has offered to
American players. As an example,
Theodore Williams was offered
$500,000 for five years' service to
our southern neighbors, but appar
ently Ted was frightened away by
such high figures, or he thought the
deal was too fishy to look into more
seriously.
Fly in Whitfield's
The fly in Whitfield's Ointment
(U.S.P.) is precisely whether Som
brero Jose is not a fly-by-night
promoter, or whether he plans to
stay in the baseball business on a
strictly legitimate basis.
A few of the writers have de
picted American horsehide men
as slaves, tied by chains to the
dictates of a cruel and hard mas
ter. Reactionary conditions are
at their worst. But the baseball
player's plight isn't quite that
bad. Some clubs, particularly the
Cardinal chain, are known to be
particularly stingy with their
pennies, but even a Redbird play
er doesn't have to go through the
bread-line routine.
The average pay of a major leag

uer, we'd say, is around $4,500, and
that is no figure to laugh at. Many
an eight-hours-a-day toiler would
gladly exchange his job with a
baseball player.
Pasquel Owns All
But back to the dispute between
American and Mexican baseball.
Even if Pasquel's salary offers
would be lived up to, his league
doesn't rate comparably with Uni
ted States circuits. All eight teams
in the league are owned by J.P. and
his brothers. That is one thing that
is never allowed in this country,
one man owning more than one
team. As a result of this ownership
monopoly, players can be juggled
around from squad to squad, and
the game loses its true competitive
spirit, which has the game the
American national pastime.
Secondly, American ball is run
purely from a business viewpoint.
That is, owners operate with the
idea of making money. Teams
are bought and sold strictly from
an investment viewpoint. It's dif
ferent south of the border. Pas
quel accumulated a fortune from
various business enterprises, and
is sinking money into baseball
more as a diversion than anything
else. That's okay, if you can't find
anything else to do with your
money, but on a long-run basis,
baseball will not benefit.
A Real World Series?
So, if the Mexican league cleans
house, so to speak, and is put on a
good running basis, there is no rea
son why American players should
not play in the southern league, and
likewise, why Mexicans should not
play in American baseball. Thus
the words "World Series" will be
something more than just 11 letters.
Till then, American players should
be wary of going south to play base
ball. Hank Greenberg will have to
be satisfied with his $65,000 per
annum he draws from Detroit.
