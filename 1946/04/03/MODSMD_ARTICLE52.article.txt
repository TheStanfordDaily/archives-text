HONOLULU, April 2 (UP).—
Navy physicist Norman J. Holter
predicted today that the atomic
. bomb tests at Bikini Atoll would
not set off a series of tidal waves
| similar to those which struck in the
Pacific basin because the bombs do
I not possess sufficient energy to
compete with an earthquake.
Any waves created by the atomic
explosion probably would not be
detected outside a limited area.
