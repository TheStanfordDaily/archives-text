I For heroic achievement against
the enemy during the Okinawa bat
tle, the Bronze Star Medal was
! awarded on March 19 to First Lieu
j tenant John L. Mensinger of Mo
â–  desto, Calif., who was graduated
; from Stanford in 1940.
At Locust Hill on Okinawa last
May, Lt. Mensinger's company had (
i gained their objective and was pre
i paring to dig in when the Japs ral
j lied the remnants of three compa
| nies and launched a fierce counter
| attack. In spite of concentrated en
; emy knee mortar, machine gun, and
; sniper fire, Mensinger led his pla
| toon forward, crawling from one
point of cover to the next. Moving
forward, he spotted a well - con
cealed enemy machine gun in a
j cave entrance. He then ordered his
; men to set up cover fire on the cave
! as he maneuvered near enough to
1 lob a hand grenade. His heroic ac
| tion saved the lives of fellow in-
I fantrymen and enabled them to hold
| their objective.
H? has arso received the Purple
Heart Medal for a wound sustained
while serving in the Ryukyus cam
| paign. A veteran also of the Leyte
Island campaign, he is now a com
pany commander in the Hourglass
Division's 31st Regiment.
