### CONNIE McGILLICUDDY 
Brunette, vivacious Elizabeth
Crandall, returning director of La
gunita, said yesterday afternoon that
she was glad to be "in quarters"
again after her three and a half years
in the Waves.
Declaring that she needed on
"orientation" course like the return
ing veterans to bring her up to date
on Stanford life, the ex-commander
smiled and said later that Stanford
hadn't changed fundamentally in
spite of the war.
Stanford Hasn't Changed
"Stanford doesn't seem a bit dif
ferent," she said, "I see it through
the same eyes I had when 1 left and
it looks just right to me."
Miss Crandall was Lagunita's di
rector from 19.38 to 1941, leaving for
navy service as soon as the bill cre
ating the Waves was passed.
Rising from lieutenant to com
mander, she was the officer in charge
of the Naval Reserve Midshipman
School at Northampton, Massachu
setts.
After a year she went to New
York where she became district di
rector of the Women's Reserve. The
WAVES were a wonderful group of
women," Miss Crandall asserted. "I
was very proud of them."
In her work in both Northampton
and New York, Miss Crandall met
many Stanford women graduates.
"It always made me feel good to
see them," she said. "They made
outstanding contributions."
Supervises Housing, Welfare
On the staff of the commandant of
the New York district, which includ
ed New York, Connecticut, and part
of New Jersey, she was responsible
for inspecting ail activities to which
members of the Women's Reserve
were assigned and for advising on all
administrative policies concerning
the assignment, housing, and wel
fare of the WAVES in the district.
In the New York district were
12,000 women, 0000 of which were
enlisted women at Hunter College,
the United States Naval Training
Station for Women Reserves. The
other 6000 were on duty relieving
men as gunnery instructors, on link
trainers, in control towers, radio
rooms, receiving stations, the fleet
post office, and the training centers.

Commenting on the navy lingo

| that colored the talk when she was
in service, Miss Crandall said that
she substituted "deck" for floor quite
easily and thought "scuttlebut,"
meaning gossip, a useful word, but

rebelled at turning the walls into
"bulkheads" and stairways into "lad-
ders."
Born in St. Paul, Minnesota, Miss
Crandall spent her childhood in
Pennsylvania, did her undergraduate
work at Western Reserve University
in Cleveland, Ohio, and her graduate
work at Stanford University. In her
educational work in civilian and
navy life, she has seen much of the
United States.
Sees Lagunita's First Year
At the Western Reserve Univer
sity she majored in English and his-
tory. After a period of teaching
school, she came to Stanford to do
her graduate work in education.
While here, she served as resident
asistant in Magnolia the first year
Lagunita was open.
From Stanford she taught at Ven
tura Junior College and then went
to the southern branch of the Uni
versity of Idaho where she was Dean
of Women.
Spends Year in Labrador
Mementos of an unusual expe-
rience are the tiny figurines decorat
ing Miss Crandall's desk. The ivory
walrus, polar bear, eskimo, fox, and
husky dog were collected in Labra-
dor her first year out of college when
she joined the Grenfell Medical Mis-
sion to help at the medical stations
established by Sir Walter Grenfell.
Recalls Lagunita Parties
In 1938 Miss Crandall came back
to Lagunita. Olivo and Granada
casas had just been added and La-
gunita was beginning to build its
traditions. Reminiscing a bit, she
told of the street dance given in
front of Lagunita to celebrate the
paving of Santa Teresa.
Other functions she recalled were
the dances given in the Lagunita
Dining Hall, with the Inner Court
ablaze with lights and tables with
gay beach umbrellas decorating the
lawn and patios.

Sees Lagunita's First Year
At the Western Reserve Univer

her graduate work in education.
While here, she served as resident

Recalls Lagunita Parties
In 1938 Miss Crandall came back
to Lagunita. Olivo and Granada

Other functions she recalled were
the dances given in the Lagunita
Dining Hall, with the Inner Court
ablaze with lights and tables with
gay beach umbrellas decorating the

Declaring that she needed on
"orientation" course like the return

on Stanford life, the ex-commander
smiled and said later that Stanford
hadn't changed fundamentally in
spite of the war.
Stanford Hasn't Changed
"Stanford doesn't seem a bit dif
ferent," she said, "I see it through
the same eyes I had when 1 left and
it looks just right to me."
Miss Crandall was Lagunita's di

navy service as soon as the bill cre
ating the Waves was passed.
Rising from lieutenant to com
mander, she was the officer in charge
of the Naval Reserve Midshipman
School at Northampton, Massachu
setts.
After a year she went to New
York where she became district di
rector of the Women's Reserve. The
WAVES were a wonderful group of
women," Miss Crandall asserted. "I
was very proud of them."
In her work in both Northampton
and New York, Miss Crandall met
many Stanford women graduates.
"It always made me feel good to
see them," she said. "They made
outstanding contributions."
Supervises Housing, Welfare

for inspecting ail activities to which
members of the Women's Reserve

the assignment, housing, and wel
fare of the WAVES in the district.
In the New York district were
12,000 women, 0000 of which were
