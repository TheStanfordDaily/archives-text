WASHINGTON. April 2 (UP).â€”
The new Republican national chair
man, Rep. B. Carroll Reece of Ten
nessee, took a long look tonight at
intra-party criticism stemming from
his election and said he didn't be
lieve party unity was in danger.
Borrowed from Congress by the
national committee Monday to
guide the party's destinies in this
election year, he told his first press
conference today "not by any
means" did he believe present
party splits spell disunity.
He was referring to criticism of his
election voiced by Harold E. Stassen,
36-year-old former Republican gov
ernor of Minnesota, and Sen. Wayne
Morse (R., Ore.), one of the minor
ity's most liberal members.
Stassen's opposition has not
caused any right. Recce asserted.
Of Morse's charge that the com
mittee's meeting was "a grand
flop.'' Recce said.
"That's just one man's opinion."
His lack of pessimism was bol
stered in part by the good wishes of
the House, of which he has been a
member for 12 years.
Reece reiterated his determination
to quit his house seat and devote full
time to his new post, but he has not
decided just when he will resign. It
will be some time before the year's
end, he said, and meantime he pre
fers not to draw a salary from the
party.
Newsmen asked Reece's reaction to
the Stassen statement that he did
not approve of Reece's voting record,
and that he intended to fight out
their differences in party councils.
"As I understand it." Recce said,
"he did not approve all my record.
I don't know anyone who has been
in Congress 25 years whose record
I would wholly approve, not even
my own.
"But in any event, the chairman
doesn't set the policies of the party.
Nor does he select candidates. He
just organizes for victory."
Reece professed no knowledge of
the critical statement from Senator
Morse, who asserted that "the meet
ing of the Republican national com
mittee last night was a grand flop.
If the program which its leaders an
nounced is to constitute Republican
policy during the next two years, the
Republican national committee will
re-elect Harry Truman in spite of
everything he is doing to defeat him
self."
