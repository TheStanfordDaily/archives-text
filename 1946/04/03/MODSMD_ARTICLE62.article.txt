# Subcommittee Returns 'Heart' to Housing Bill
## 
### 
| WASHINGTON, April 2 (UP).—A
! Senate banking subcommittee today
pointed the way for a bitter Senate-
House battle over the administra
tion's housing program by restoring

to the veterans emergency housing
bill $(500,000,000 in materials sub
sidies turned down by the House'.
It also wrote back in provisions
for price ceilings on existing homes
and building lots as requested by
President Truman and Housing Ex
pediter Wilson W. Wyatt. Mr. Tru
man had said that House failure to
include these provisions had "cut the
heart" out of his program to build
2,700,000 dwellings.
The subcommittee also approved
Wyatt's request for authority to
guarantee markets for new-type
construction materials and 75 to
100 per cent of the prefabricated
houses he turns out.
The bill now goes to the full Sen
ate Banking Committee, whose act
ing chairman, Alben W. Barkley (D.,
Ky.), said he believed the changes
would be retained. Wyatt said he
expects the Senate to "sell" the ma
terials subsidies to the House.
Mr. Truman's top economic ad
visers opened war on the House
version with blistering charges
that pressure groups, and speci
fically real estate interests, had
"intimidated" the House into vot
ing against the subsides and ceil
ings on old homes. The revisions
were engineered by a powerful
Republican - Conservative Demo
crat coalition, bringing suggestions
from Secretary of Commerce
Ilenry A. Wallace that the Demo
crats he "purged."
The Senate committee apparently
is going along with the President,
raising the prospect that the final
congressional version may be de
layed for months as House and Sen
ate conferees wrangle over a com
promise.
House Republican opposition to
most of the provisions centered
around assertions that they would
give Wyatt too much power.
As the bill now stands, it would
1. —Grant $600,000,000 in materials
subsidies to spur production of
building supplies.
2.—Put price ccilings on both
new and existing homes and on
building lots. The ceiling on old
homes and lots would be the price
of their first resale after passage
of the law.
3.—Provide for a government
guarantee of a market for prefabri
cated houses and new-type building
materials.
4.—lncrease government authority
to insure home mortgages by $1 bil
lion.
5. —Place ceilings on building ma
terials.

subsidies to spur production of
building supplies.
2.—Put price ccilings on both
new and existing homes and on

homes and lots would be the price
of their first resale after passage
of the law.
3.—Provide for a government

to insure home mortgages by $1 bil

| WASHINGTON, April 2 (UP).—A
! Senate banking subcommittee today
pointed the way for a bitter Senate-
House battle over the administra
tion's housing program by restoring

to the veterans emergency housing
bill $(500,000,000 in materials sub
sidies turned down by the House'.
It also wrote back in provisions
for price ceilings on existing homes
and building lots as requested by
President Truman and Housing Ex
pediter Wilson W. Wyatt. Mr. Tru
man had said that House failure to
include these provisions had "cut the
heart" out of his program to build
2,700,000 dwellings.
The subcommittee also approved
Wyatt's request for authority to
guarantee markets for new-type
construction materials and 75 to
100 per cent of the prefabricated
houses he turns out.
The bill now goes to the full Sen
ate Banking Committee, whose act
ing chairman, Alben W. Barkley (D.,
Ky.), said he believed the changes
would be retained. Wyatt said he
expects the Senate to "sell" the ma
terials subsidies to the House.
Mr. Truman's top economic ad
visers opened war on the House
version with blistering charges
that pressure groups, and speci
fically real estate interests, had
"intimidated" the House into vot
ing against the subsides and ceil
ings on old homes. The revisions
were engineered by a powerful
Republican - Conservative Demo
crat coalition, bringing suggestions

Ilenry A. Wallace that the Demo
crats he "purged."
