# European Universities Report Enrollment Gain
## 
### MARY VIRGINIA POND 
While Stanford is witnessing a
greater enrollment of students, old !
and new, including several hundred
veterans returning to resume inter
rupted studies, the reopened uni
versities in the liberated lands of
Europe and Asia are experiencing |
matched unprecedented enroll
ments.
According to World Student
Service Fund headquarters, to
which Stanford students contrib
uted in last fall's War Fund Drive,
100,000 students have applied for
admission into reopened universi
ties in Poland. In Austria the uni- !
versities report an enrollment of j

7,500 more than the pre-war 20,500.
Undergo Hardships
In the meantiiriy both students
and faculty members are undergo
ing hardships and privations in the
way of classroom facilities, supplies,
food, and lodgings.
Stanford students hear the tradi
tional complaints about "Encina
food" and difficulties in housing. In
Austria ration cards for students at
Graz supply them with 1200 calo
ries, at Innsbruck with 1500.
In Vienna however, three-fourths
of the people were living on 7<>o
calorics until UNIIRA began send
ing food supplies this winter. Tu
berculosis increases steadily among
the undernourished students.
An acute housing problem faces
the £000 students attending classes
in the University of Warsaw. Cel
lars, huts, and dugouts in a ravaged
city congested with nearly 400,000
persons without food, fuel, or warm
clothing provide living quarters and
classrooms.
Few Professors
Despite the heavy enrollments,
the number of professors has been
reduced considerably by the elimi
nation of pro-Nazi teachers. In
Warsaw more than 60 per cent of
the professors lost their lives.
In the meantime European and

Asiatic students have been partially
aided by funds submitted by Amer
ican and British students to the
World Student Service Fund and to
the European Student Relief Fund.
With the aid of American students
through WSSF, more than 11.. r >(K)
parcels of books were sent to Pol
ish prisoners of war in Fiance.
One thousand Polish student ref
ugees in Switzerland were able to
carry on their studies in either Pol
ish university camps or in Swiss
universities through the material
intervention of ESRF, the Swiss
government, universities, and stu
dents.
Want Felowship
"The hunger for fellowship with
American and English students is
tcrriffic," according to Dr. Douglas
B. Steere, professor of philosophy at
Haverford College, who toured Po
land for WSSF.
Great numbers are learning Eng
lish. This hunger for a resumed
and intensified student fellowship is
universal among the students of
Europe who have been isolated for
so long.
WSSF funds are aiding Chinese
students returning to the coastal
cities after the evacuation of their
colleges to the interior of China
during the Japanese occupation.
Heidelberg University, Germany's
most famous and colorful univer
sity, has been reopened within the
American occupation zone.
