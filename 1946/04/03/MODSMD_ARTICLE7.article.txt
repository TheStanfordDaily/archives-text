# Senators Support Civilian Control Over Atomic Power
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. April 2 (UP). â€”The Senate Atomic Energy Committee
reversed its stand for military control today and adopted unanimously a
substitute amendment sharply restricting Army-Navy influence on atomic
policy.
The switch, which committee spokesmen said would insure full civil-

inn authority over the cosmic force
as requested by President Truman,
came in the wake of a flood of pro
tests from prominent laymen and
scientists.
Sen. Arthur 11. Vandonberg, R.,
Mich., leader of an earlier commit
tee drive to give the Army and
Navy review powers over all atomic
decisions, offered the compromise
in an effort to avoid a fight when
the bill reaches the Senate floor.
It was accepted without dissent as
a substitute to his original pro-mil
itary amendment to the control bill
drafted by Chairman Brien McMa
hon, D., Conn.
The comniittcc also approved
another Vandenberg amendment
stating 111 at atomic legislation will
be subject to revision from time
to time because of the many "un
known factors" involved.
The vote paved the way for
speedy committee approval. Mc-
Mahon predicted it would be re
ported out this week.
Dr. T. R. Hogness, chairman of
the advisory committee of Chicago
atomic scientists, told newsmen he
believed the compromise bill would
be acceptable to most scientists.
But he said many civilian ex
perts were fearful of proposals for
fines and jnil sentences for viola
tions of atomic securitv regula
tions issued by the civilian com
mission. He suggested that Con
gress provide the regulations and
penalties specifically, pointing out
that many scientists were quitting
atomic projects because they
Icared confused interpretation of
the security rules.
