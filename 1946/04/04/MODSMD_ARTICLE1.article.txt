NEW YORK, April 3 (UP). —The worst crisis in the United Nations' brief history was solved to
night when authoritative sources revealed that Security Council members and Iran will accept Rus
sian assurances that Red Army troops are being withdrawn unconditionally from Iran.
Iranian Ambassador Hussein Ala is prepared to accept the Soviet statement at face value.
American and British delegates, leaders of the fight in the Iranian case, consider Russia's letter

The crisis in UNO is over. But

So relieved were delegates at the
prospective end of 10 days of stead

TEHRAN, Thursday, April 1
(UP). — The evacuation of Red
Army troops from Iran is "pro
ceeding according to plan." Gen.
M. 11. F irouz. Iranian Undersec
retary of Politics, said today.
Firouz confirmed that the first
contingent of Soviet troops has
crossed the border, and that the
Russians were also preparing to
leave Tabriz and other Azerbai
jan garrisons.

dicated and it was understood that
Ala himself had informed the UNO
that Russia's reply was satisfactory.
The dramatic turn of events was a
personal victory for Secretary of
State James F. Byrnes who led the
fight in behalf of the small nations at
the price of a Russian council boy
cott—broken today when Russia sent
its reply, even though chief delegate
Andrei A. Gromyko did not attend
the council meeting.
Stalemate Believed Broken
The precedents were believed set
that (1) no nation can be prevented
from appealing to the council, (2)
that no nation can keep the council
from proceeding with a case, and (3)
that no nation can dictate to the
council.
Confidence that the stalemate was
broken was emphasized by two
points: 1
I.—That Russia's reply said no
conditions were attached to its troop
withdrawal and that the withdrawals
had no connection with negotiations
for oil concessions or Azerbaijan au
tonomy.
2.—Omission of the previous Rus
sian statement that "unforeseen cir
cumstances" might stop the with
drawal.
Today's meeting lasted 32 min
utes. It was the shortest the Coun
cil ever held. It opened tense and
anxious. It ended, with an adjourn
ment until 11 a.m. tomorrow, on a
note of hope that the dangerous
Russo - Iranian crisis was all but
over — provided Russia withdrew
her troops unconditionally by May 6.
The result was a clear victory
for Secretary of State James F.
Byrnes in his battle for the right of
small nations to lie heard against
great ones.
UNO Secretary General Trygve
Lie received Russia's reply at 9:10
a.m., two hours and three minutes
before the Council met at 11:13.
Iran's was received at 0:15.
Developments at the meeting
were:
1. Council President Quo Tai-chi
read the letters from Gromyko and
Iranian Ambassador Hussein Ala
replying to the Council request for
information on their dispute by the
11 a.m. deadline.
2. Byrnes said he would like to
study the replies and asked Ala,
who was at the Council table, if he
had any suggestions on Council ac
tion.
3. Ala said that if Russia prom
ised the Council flatly to withdraw
its troops unconditionally by May
6 Iran was willing not to press its
complaint "at this time . . . pro
vided, of course, that these matters
remain on the agenda . . . for con
sideration at any time."
Only three men spoke at today's
meeting—Quo, Ala, and Byrnes.
It looked as if things had been re
hearsed.

Juan D. Peron, above, have con
