# Managerial Jobs Open; Men Needed
## 
### 
Managers are needed in all major
and minor intercollegiate sports and
men students who are interested
are urged to sign up at once, ac
cording to Alfred R. Masters, Di
rector of Physical Education and
Athletics. Tryouts will be conduct
ed and those who wish to partici
pate should report to Miss Eunice
DuPrau, office manager for the
Stanford Athletic Council, at the
Athletic Department, for an inter
view.
There are openings in basketball,
track, baseball, tennis, boxing, golf,
swimming, and other sports.
Masters points out that there are
many advantages in being a sports
manager. Managers travel with
their teams and have an opportu
nity to gain valuable business expe
rienceâ€”handling money, train res
ervations, , hotel accommodations
and schedule arrangements with
other schools. In addition, manag
ers receive awards, the. senior man
ager receiving a Block or Circle
"S," depending on the sport with
which he is affiliated.
"Many of our former sports man
agers have told us that, the expe
rience which they received here
was a tremendous advantage to
them after they left the Univer
sity," the Athletic Director stated.
"The managerial jobs offer an es
pecially fine opportunity to those
men who arc interested in athletics
but do not have the ability to make
varsity squads. We can use every
man who is interested and I hope
we will have a big turnout."
