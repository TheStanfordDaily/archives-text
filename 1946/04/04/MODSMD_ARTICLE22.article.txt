# His Final Gift
## 
### 
To chemistry students struggling with dis
tillation, extraction, fractionation, and similar
problems in the preparation of organic com
pounds, Dr. Francis William Bergstrom was
both an inspiration as a scientist and a will
ing helper as professor of chemistry.
iii his 21 years on our campus, he became
a familiar figure to many members of the
Stanford family, particularly to those who
looked at chemistry through his eyes and
discovered it to be very understandable and
enjoyable.
Dr. Bergstrom made distinguished contrib
utions to scientific research in his special

field of the chemistry of nitrogen com
pounds; and during the war he v/as engaged
in research on anti-malaria compounds. At
one time he served as associate editor of
the Journal of Organic Chemistry.
As a final addition to the list of both mate
rial and intangible gifts whijch he made to the
University, Dr. Bergstrom made the Stanford
chemistry department sole beneficiary of his
estate, which is valued at $10,000.
As a person who most truly had the inter
ests of his students and associates in science
constantly at heart, Dr. Bergstrom will be
remembered best.
