To the Editor:
Letters to the editor are neither my mania
nor my recreation, but it has always been my
inclination to express myself on subjects
which concern me profoundly. And to this
end I have taken the liberty of addressing a
communication to you on the death of my
beloved friend and teacher, Charles Vincent
Taylor.
I have had the privilege of being touched
by the life and spirit of Charles Vincent Tay
lor as a student, a research assistant, a teach
ing assistant, and as a candidate for higher
degrees, and 1 know that whtever hppens to
the flesh and blood of the man, I conserve in
my own heart and mind some of the life and
spirit that was his.
1 can recall right now a statement he

made to me that will be in my mind when I
have forgotten forever the lines of the An
dria, the Law of Mass Action, or the nomen
clature of the Ciliates: "We cannot always
complete the tasks which we set ourselves
in science, but we can feel that we have con
tributed a little to human advancement by
leaving something behind us for others to
complete."
Charles Vincent Taylor is great in the Stan
ford tradition, the tradition of the Branners,
the Wilburs, the Termans, the Morenos, and
the other fine families that have made Stan
ford great, a university of high degree. I am
proud to acknowledge my spiritual debt to
him. Respectfully,
