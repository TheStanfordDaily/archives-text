Another old Stanford tradition is the an
nual spring quarter Shaggy Dog Story con
test.
It has always been within the domain of
the author of Bull Session to publicize, judge,
and award prizes in this contest, and this
year is no exception.
Before going further, we'll run through
the old original Shaggy Dog Story for the
benefit of you come-latelys:
A woman living in Deviledham-on-the-Rye,
Middlesex, England, owned a large shaggy
dog of which she was most fond. She liked
the dog very much. She was attached to the
dog.
She took the dog with her on a trip to
America. While touring one of the great
Western States she lost the dog. She was
heartbroken and panic stricken.
She advertised in all the great western
newspapers, but to no avail, finally with
broken heart and stricken panic she returned

to her home in the U.K.
Quite a spell later a resident of one of the
great Western states came upon a great
shaggy dog sitting under a Pistachio tree
reading Keats. His mind lashed back to an
advertisement he'd seen some time previous
pleading for the return of a great shaggy
dog in return for a reward of six pounds and
other considerations.
Shortening the story by some 15 minutes,
this citizen took the great shaggy dog all the
way to Mincedham and finally located the
party of the first part.
Leaving the shaggy dog in the tonneau
chewing pistachio nuts, the citizen ap
proached the house, massaged the bell, and
presently was explaining to the woman that
he had come for the reward, since he had
found her great shaggy dog.
She asked him to bring the dog in, which
he promptly did. Upon seeing the dog, the
woman exclaimed:
"Oh, no! Land sakes, not that shaggy!"
