# HISTORY—1946
## 
### BILL STEIF 
Harry Truman came through with a snap
py-sounding statement yesterday afternoon.
The President, speaking soberly but confi
dently, said the United States is over the "re
conversion hump" and embarking upon the
greatest boom in its history.
This sounded just fine to us and we are a
little tired of the voices of doom which in re
cent months have been firing broadsides at
our self confidence. At the same time, how
ever, the President gualified his confidence
by saying that we could easily move straight
into "economic choas" if strikes and inflation
go unchecked. That sounded quite familiar
to us and we think the President is right—
you just can't doubt it—but the big question
is how are strikes and inflation going to be
checked.
Well, the House Banking Committee sup
plied one answer yesterday afternoon when
it voted 23-3 to continue the O.P.A. until
June 30, 1947. The committee came up with
what seems to us to be an ideal compromise
between pro-O.P.A. and anti-O.P.A. factions
when it recommended that Mr. Truman be
required monthly to determine what controls
can be lifted during the next fifteen months.
This means that there will be a gradual loos
ening of price control until the middle of 1947
by which time it is to be hoped that the
U.S.A.'s production situation will be so much
improved that we can do without price con
trols.
The one drawback to the whole plan is
that the President is under compulsion to

certify when any scarce item becomes
abundant —even though the price of the item
may soar when the control is lifted. On the
other hand, it is pretty hard to see how prices
of abundant materials can go up. At least
that's what they say in Econ 1 and at N.A.M.
headquarters.
Back in Detroit the automobile manufactur
ers are still having plenty of trouble gearing
their production to high speed.
Ford, saying that its plants are consuming
steel faster than stocks can be replaced, is
laying off 35,000 of its 90,000 production
workers starting today. Ford officials say
that the lay-off will last only a week but that
it will probably cost the public about 20,000
cars and trucks since Ford is now turning
out approximately 3,500 units a day.
Meanwhile, thousands of UAW men are
still idle in the sprawling General Motors
Empire. Disputes over local plant issues are
still holding up production, though there are
signs that these snarls should soon be
straightened out. His nibs, Walter Reuther,
is back in the automobile capitol trying to
untangle those small messes right now.
And Hudson Motor Co., amongst the
"small" manufacturers, closed its shop last
Saturday because of steel shortages and has
no idea as yet when it will reopen.
It's still a tough pull, Mr. Truman, and,
though your optimism sounds good, we
want to see more material rolling off the
production lines before we jump into the
canyon of lavish self-adulation.
