CHUNGKING, April 3 (UP).â€”A
Chinese government spokesman an
nounced today that Soviet forces
soon would withdraw from the
Yellow Sea port of Dairen and that
they would complete the evacua
tion of Changchun, capital of Man
churia, during the next few days.
The spokesman said the Russians
had not yet answered Chungking's
request for an evacuation schedule,
but that Moscow previously had
given assurances troops would be
withdrawn from Dairen in con
formance with the 1945 Sino-Soviet
treaty which makes Dairen an open
port under Chinese administration
control.
Unofficial but usually reliable
sources said Lt. Gen. Tung Yuan
ping, liaison officer at Soviet head
quarters in Manchuria, had re
ceived notice from the Russian
chief-of-staff that Soviet forces
would withdraw from Changchun
before April 13 and from all of
Manchuria, including Dairen, by
April 30.
Dairen is 20 milos east of Port
Arthur, which is to be a joint Sino-
Soviet base, according to the treaty,
but now is completely in the hands
of Russian forces.
The spokesman also announced
that Minister of War Chen Cheng
will replace Gen. Chang Chili
chung on the Peiping executive
headquarters military committee
which was scheduled to meet today
to discuss sending more cease-fire
teams to Manchuria. It was believed
Chen would not attend the meeting
becalise of ill health.
Chinese Central News Agency
reported today that Communists
have occupied Mengiston, southern
suburb of Changchun, and have
clashed with the government's
Peace Preservation Corps, which
had constructed defense installa
tions around the city.
