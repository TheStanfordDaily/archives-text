A preview of Stanford gridiron might for '46 will be seen next week,
when Marehie Schwartz opens up the spring practice session. A number of
former Cardinal pigskin men, mostly from the '42 squad, have returned to
school this quarter, and the fact that probably more men who have had
football experience will be around by next fall, gives impetus to the hopes
that Stanford will field a successful team next autumn.
The only herring in the barrel, however, is that all other schools are
blessed with talented football men. Cal has had a 12(1-man turnout for
football, and both the southern schools—USC and UCLA—have had
turnouts in about the same proportion.
And not to be discounted are the schools up north. Oregon, with Jake
Leicht, ought to be strong. Washington State, which finished second last
season, will be back strong.
If football follows the pattern of sports this year on the Farm, the
squad will not be very strong. Jumping into competition after a three
year layofi' isn't the easiest thing to do. Look at last quarter's basketball
record, and that point is proven.
But don't forget one thing. The basketball team, and the present base
ball squad, was composed of men largely without any previous varsity
experience. That will not be the case with football. The squad will be
made up of veterans, who have merely been out of competition for several
years. That's a lot different.
From the Chicago Daily News comes an interesting tidbit. Ted
Ilusiitg, noted sports announcer, in an interview with the sports stall',
expressed bis opinion that the greatest football player, to bis mind, is
Marehie Schwartz, present coach at Stanford.
Marehie Schwartz played for Knute Rockne and Husky Anderson at
Notre Dame at the turn ol the thirties. Husing's comment represents a
pretty cool appraisal, for Husing has seen the best of them perform.
Managerial positions on Stanlord athletic teams are now open. These
jobs not only represent a chance to travel with the team, but mean a let
ter, a Block S or a Circle S, depending on the sport —definitely good busi
ness experience.
These posts have always been highly contested for in the past. Stu
dents are passing up an excellent opportunity when they don't seek the
managerial positions that are open.
We have it on good advice (hat Block to Block, a snappy little nag
spending the spring season at Bay Meadows, is due to pull a terrific up
set. Our sources, whici. prefer not to be named, arc pooling odd pennies
and nickels for a big splurge on the pony.
