# Bob Anderson Wins National 50-Yard Pool Championship
## 
### LARRY MADURO 
Assuming an early lead which he '
never relinquished, Bob Anderson, j
Stanford's highly-touted swimmer, I
churned through the water in con- |
vincing fashion to win the Rational
Intercollegiate 50-yard championship j
last week. Anderson, by virtue of I
his impressive victory, has been i
named on the A.A.U. All-American
Swimming Team, and is number 1
50-yard swimmer in the United
States today.
Anderson attempted to annex two
national crowns in one day, a pro
digious feat, when he entered the
100-yard dash,, and it appears that
had he not just finished the grueling
50-yard event his dream would have
been materialized.
He led for 75 yards, but the tir
ing effects of bis previous event |
took their toll, and he soon found
himself overtaken. He finished in
.sixth place, but so close was the
finish, which was proclaimed as !
the most exciting in recent years,
that there was less than a yard
difference between first and third
place. Anderson had to take a
plane right after his last exam in
order that he be in the East in i

time for the championships.

The Indians should annex the
Coast Conference swimming cham
pionship with relative ease. The
squad looked so impressive that
Coach Haynie, who was formerly
coach of the perennially powerful
Michigan swimming team, declared
today, "In my opinion, with the ex
ception of Ohio State there is no
swimming team in the United States
that can defeat Stanford."
A survey of Stanford's swimming
team points to the fact that Coach
Haynie has based his claim of
Stanford's greatness in the swim
ming world upon a solid founda
tion. The team, led by Captain
Clinton Eastman, is loaded with
talent.
Besides Anderson, there are a
large number of crack swimmers.
Don Hester, who swims the 200-yard
breaststroke, has navigated this
event in under 2:30, and the Inter
collegiate Championship time for this
event is 2:2G.
Harry Borchers is the outstand
ing Indian in the backstroke.
Borchers turned in a very credit
able 1:46 for the 150-yard back
stroke to cop this event by three
lengths in the recent Olympic Club
meet. Dick Narver, who swam the
220- and the 100-yard freestyle for
Stanford before he entered the
service, shows terrific promise. As
soon as he rounds into top shape,
Indian rooters will be able to see
one of the top swimmers in the
U.S. in action here on the Farm.
James Armstrong has emerged as
the top Indian in the 20- and 440-
yard races. His performances so far
indicate that he will experience lit
tle trouble winning in Coast League
competition.
With returning letterman Paul
Ageler, and Martin Vitorifek. excel
lent breast stroker from Hawaii,
plus Don Hester competing in the
breast stroke event, Stanford may
win first, second, and third place in
this race at the Pacific Coast Confer
ence meet.

Assuming an early lead which he '
never relinquished, Bob Anderson, j
Stanford's highly-touted swimmer, I
churned through the water in con- |
vincing fashion to win the Rational
Intercollegiate 50-yard championship j
last week. Anderson, by virtue of I
his impressive victory, has been i
named on the A.A.U. All-American
Swimming Team, and is number 1
50-yard swimmer in the United
States today.
Anderson attempted to annex two
national crowns in one day, a pro
digious feat, when he entered the
100-yard dash,, and it appears that
had he not just finished the grueling
50-yard event his dream would have
been materialized.
He led for 75 yards, but the tir
ing effects of bis previous event |
took their toll, and he soon found
himself overtaken. He finished in
.sixth place, but so close was the
finish, which was proclaimed as !
the most exciting in recent years,
that there was less than a yard
difference between first and third
place. Anderson had to take a
plane right after his last exam in
order that he be in the East in i

time for the championships.

The Indians should annex the
Coast Conference swimming cham
pionship with relative ease. The
squad looked so impressive that
Coach Haynie, who was formerly
coach of the perennially powerful
Michigan swimming team, declared
today, "In my opinion, with the ex
ception of Ohio State there is no
swimming team in the United States
that can defeat Stanford."
A survey of Stanford's swimming
team points to the fact that Coach
Haynie has based his claim of
Stanford's greatness in the swim
ming world upon a solid founda
tion. The team, led by Captain
Clinton Eastman, is loaded with
talent.
Besides Anderson, there are a
large number of crack swimmers.
Don Hester, who swims the 200-yard
breaststroke, has navigated this
event in under 2:30, and the Inter
collegiate Championship time for this
event is 2:2G.
Harry Borchers is the outstand
ing Indian in the backstroke.
Borchers turned in a very credit
able 1:46 for the 150-yard back
stroke to cop this event by three
lengths in the recent Olympic Club
meet. Dick Narver, who swam the
220- and the 100-yard freestyle for
Stanford before he entered the
service, shows terrific promise. As
soon as he rounds into top shape,
Indian rooters will be able to see
one of the top swimmers in the
U.S. in action here on the Farm.
James Armstrong has emerged as
the top Indian in the 20- and 440-
yard races. His performances so far
indicate that he will experience lit
tle trouble winning in Coast League
competition.
With returning letterman Paul
Ageler, and Martin Vitorifek. excel
lent breast stroker from Hawaii,
plus Don Hester competing in the
breast stroke event, Stanford may
win first, second, and third place in
this race at the Pacific Coast Confer
ence meet.
