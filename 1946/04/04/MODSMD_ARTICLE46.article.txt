# Injuries Rack Stanford Nine
## 
### STU MILLAR 
Coach Harry Wolter donned uni
form and picked up a bat yesterday
to send his squad through a stiff,
two-hour workout. Spending most
of the time on fundamentals, he hit
flies to the outer gardeners and then
sent what infielders there were
through an intensive grounder ses
sion.
The horsehidc men/or was se
verely handicapped by the absence
of many first string men. Three
fourths of the starting infield for
the quartet of games down south
were not at practice and the other
man, Larry Prato, third sacker,
was bothered by a sore hand.
Bob Peters took the day off so that
his spiked knee would have time to
heal properly. He was wounded in
the second inning of the first UCLA
game, but came back to play the
three following games on the sore
leg.
Morgan Miller, first baseman,
was reportedly in San Diego visit
ing his parents, although no one
was positive of his whereabouts.
He is expected at practice this af
ternoon.
Tom Howard, starting second base
man, was absent from his keystone
position. And as if this wasn't
enough bad news, Dick Ahlquist,
who has started both at catcher and
right field this season, turned up
with a sprained ankle.
On the black side of the ledger,
Larry Wolf, who just entered
school, came out for the first time.
He is the brother of Phil Wolf,
classiest of the Farm hurling staff.
Also a pitcher, he should
strengthen Wolter's mound corps
considerably, for he is reported to
be just about as good as his
brother.
Meanwhile, two men took advan
tage of the regulars' absence to show
up exceptionally well in practice.
They are Lloyd Merriman and Don
Gabrelson. Both are left-handed
and can double in the outfield and
at first.
Stanford's baseball record for the
season now stands at two wins and
four losses. After taking the first
two games on the slate, the locals
dropped a quartet of conference
games to the S.C. and U.C.L.A.
nines down south. They will at
tempt to hit the winning stride this
Saturday afternoon when they
play a nonconferencc game with
San Francisco University.

was bothered by a sore hand.
Bob Peters took the day off so that
his spiked knee would have time to
heal properly. He was wounded in
the second inning of the first UCLA
game, but came back to play the
three following games on the sore
leg.
Morgan Miller, first baseman,
was reportedly in San Diego visit
ing his parents, although no one
was positive of his whereabouts.
He is expected at practice this af
ternoon.
Tom Howard, starting second base
man, was absent from his keystone
position. And as if this wasn't
enough bad news, Dick Ahlquist,
who has started both at catcher and
right field this season, turned up
with a sprained ankle.
On the black side of the ledger,
Larry Wolf, who just entered
school, came out for the first time.
He is the brother of Phil Wolf,
classiest of the Farm hurling staff.
Also a pitcher, he should
strengthen Wolter's mound corps
considerably, for he is reported to
be just about as good as his
brother.
Meanwhile, two men took advan
tage of the regulars' absence to show
up exceptionally well in practice.
They are Lloyd Merriman and Don
Gabrelson. Both are left-handed
and can double in the outfield and
at first.
Stanford's baseball record for the
season now stands at two wins and
four losses. After taking the first
two games on the slate, the locals
dropped a quartet of conference
games to the S.C. and U.C.L.A.
nines down south. They will at
tempt to hit the winning stride this
Saturday afternoon when they
play a nonconferencc game with
San Francisco University.
