Reminiscing in the Daily Shack
about Stanford's athletics of the
past, one can't help but wonder If
Stanford will ever return to its pre
war standards.
Recent University policies gov
erning entrance requirements have
made us skeptical—maybe unduly
so—but looking at the current bas
ketball and baseball records one
becomes easily discouraged.
Stanford has always had high en
trance examinations but leniency
has often been shown to outstanding
athletes. In this day of commercial
athletics a school without good ath
letics can't hope to keep in big-time
sports. The University of Chicago,
Carnegie Tech, Pittsburgh, and New
York U. have all taken steps toward
minimizing athletics in those schools.
President Donald B. Tresidder has
said that athletics will not be de
emphasized at Stanford. But any
way you look at it, the Indians will
have a long hard pull before they
can smell the Pasadena roses.
Alumni and students have been
voicing fears that the Indians will
never return to big-time athletics.
They point out the fact that Jim
Pollard, outstanding basketball
star at Stanford in '42, may enter
U.S.C. next fall.
Other reports drift in concerning
athletes who will not be admitted to
Stanford and who are heading for
Southern California or Oregon or
Nevada. We admire the University's
stand in not turning Stanford into a
midwestern football school buj we
hope the Administration will not
raise the entrance requirements to
an extent that we have to sit on
hard basketball seats watching Stan
ford lose 12 straight conference bas
ketball games.
Where are all the Dud DeGroots,
Bobby Graysons, Leo Ferkos, and
Hampton Pools of thi era? Stan
ford could use them right about
now.
There aren't many Stanford fans
who want to see the Indians drop
USC and California off their sched
ule to tussle with College of Pacific,
Menlo J. C., and Pomona. That's
what Carnegie Tech has had to do.
