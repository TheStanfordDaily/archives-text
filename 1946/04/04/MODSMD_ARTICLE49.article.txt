# Softball Play Starts Soon
## 
### "TEX" ROTENBURG 
Sign-ups for the Softball tourna
ment are proceeding at a slow rate, i
Coach Bugge, who is in charge of the ]
program, has announced that com
petition will begin next week.
So far only three teams have
tossed their ball caps on the diamond
by signing up their squads on the
; gym bulletin board. Sigma Nu, an
Encina organization, and an off-cam
pus nine, are the early-bird entries
and all of them boast crushing
| power.
However, a flood of talented
clubs made up of odicially recog
nized living groups is expected to
join the softhall league and give
these more eager outfits a battle.
Those planning on entering should
do so as soon as possible so that
adequate time may be found for
making up a schedule.
Since it is hoped that the first
| games will be played on Thursday, a
week from today, there is still a
; great deal of work to do.
There is still a call from the gym
! for men to umpire the contests. So
I any of you fellows who are inter
| ested in making a buck short of
going to work for a living have the
! opportunity of a lifetime staring you
in the face. For sticking your neck
out and calling the high and low
| ones you will "earn" the once grand
and glorious sum of $1. Applicants
j with poorer vision than 20/100 need
not apply.
