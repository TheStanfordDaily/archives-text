# Truman Warns of Strikes as Railmen Get Pay Jump; Coal Fight Continues
## President Sees Inflation Boom 
### 
WASHINGTON, April .5 (UP).
â€”America is over the reconver
sion hump and embarking on the
biggest boom in its history, Pres
ident Truman said today, then
listed inflation and strikes as th
two main threats to prosperity.
His soberly confident statement,
given at a press conference, came
during his comment on an economic
report issued by Reconversion Di
rector John W. Snyder.
The President bailed Snyder's
report on economic progress of
the first three months of l!)4(i as
proof that the United States "is
coming out of its war years as a
strong and healthy nation."
But both Mr. Truman and Snyder
mixed their optimism with a sober
note of warning that the nation is
entering a "boom-or-bust" era
which could easily end in "eco
nomic chaos" if strikes and infla
tion go unchecked.
Strikes such as the soft coal
stoppage or the lifting of the anti
inflation controls, the President
said, could deliver a knockout
blow to the progress made so far.
He and Snyder expressed strong
support for extension of the exist
ing price control and stabilization
laws which will expire June 30 un
less renewed by Congress.
Without extension, the Presi
dent said, "progress wil be turned
into economic chaos. Likewise,
protracted work stoppages in any
one of a number of important
fields, for instance in the coal in
dustry, could seriously delay our
progress."
He defended the Administration's
wage - stabilization program, citing
Ihe current record production as
proof that the policy was not im
peding reconversion, as has been
charged.
