# Excom Hires Student Cop
## 
### 
Excom last night docided to hire
a student policeman to look in on
| all firesides on Friday and Satur
| day nights as a solution to the prob
! lorn of social conduct that has been
j reported at firesides.
This solution was considered
j more desirable than that of re- 1
j quiring patrons to be present at
| firesides. Excom members agreed
j that good conduct must come
from the students themselves; but
since there arc student policemen
at all dances on campus, they
voted to extend the service to
j firesides.
Merle Bcuttel was elected Drives*
I Committee chairman for the suc
| ceeding school year upon the resig
| nation of Marie Wagner, present
chairman.
Fred Bremenkamp, seventh dis-
I trict at large representative on Ex
j com, has resigned as he is now in
| the Army. An election for a new
i member representing residents of
| all men's Row houses to replace
j Bremenkamp for the rest of this
j year will be held soon, probably
j early next week, according to Bob
j Kennedy, A.S.S.U. president.
Bob liicscr, Chaparral editor,
asked that the Chappie be al
lowed to return to its pre-war
schedule of an issue every month
, (three each quarter). Due to an
enlarged editorial staff, this is
possible, Itiescr said. During the
war the Chappie has put out only
| one or two issues per quarter.
| Excom approved the remiest.
j which is subject to Administra
tion approval.
Kennedy announced that the Ad
j ministration denied the Palo Alto
Yacht Club's request to hold yacht
| races on Lake Lagunita this spring.
