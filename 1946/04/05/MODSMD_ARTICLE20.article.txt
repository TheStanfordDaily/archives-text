ROME, April 4 (UP).—'The Pope,
praising the United Stales for its
leadership in the fight against devas
tating postwar starvation, today
urged equal relief for victor and
vanquished alike and asked Latin
America to boost its world food con
tributions by instituting rationing.
In a radio address to the world
Ihe Pontiff called for concerted ac
tion to alleviate a famine which
threatens 500,000,000 persons with
"incomparably vaster carnage"
than the war itself, and asserted
that failure may doom all hopes
for a lasting peace.
He urged people of the richer na
tions to work ceaselessly to increase
food shipments to famine areas,
"avoiding inconsiderate or unjustifi
able cessation of work," and attacked
women who hoard food or "enrich
themselves by illicit speculation or
vile forms of trade" on the black
market.
The food crisis can be overcome
only if "tranquility and public order
arc maintained," the Pope declared,
warning-against "that delusion which
drives hungry mobs to revolt and
pillage."
