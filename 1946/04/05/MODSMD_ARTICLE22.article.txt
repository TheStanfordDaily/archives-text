# Iranian How Shelved; Soviets Drop Boycott
## Home Troops Reported Reoccupying Second City; British Mission Refused 
### 
TEHRAN, April 4 (UP). â€”A British diplomatic
source said today that Iranian army troops have re
occupied Karaj, 25 miles northwest of Tehran, but that
the Iranians arc keeping a safe distance between
themselves and the withdrawing Russians to avoid

any friction.
Karaj is only the second Soviet
evacuated garrison city reported
reoccupied by Iranian forces in the
11 days since Moscow announced
that the Soviet withdrawal from
Iran had started.
The first city was Meshed, 400
miles east of Tehran. About 200
Russian troops still are packing
supplies there, according to an of
ficial Iranian report last Tuesday,
but the Iranian garrison has moved
back into its barracks and is re
suming its duties.
British Mission Refused
The British parliamentary in
quiry mission dispatched to Iran to
investigate the Russian withdrawal
announcement has been refused
permission to enter Soviet - occu
pied Azerbaijan and will leave Iran
for Cairo on April 10.
The two-man mission, composed
of Laborite Michacl Foot and Con
servative Brigadier A. H. Head,
surveyed the Tehran area and now
is investigating conditions in Isfa
han, 224 miles south of Tehran, the
capital of Isfahan province.
Meanwhile, government spokes
man Prince MozafTar Firouz an
nounced to correspondents yester
day the contents of Iran's answer to
the United Nations questionnaire,
but refused to answer questions
about exact negotiations going on
between Russia and Iran.
Iranian Premier Absent
He confirmed Iran's stand that
there was no mention made of "un
foreseen" circumstances in the So
viet note to Iran regarding evacu
ation of troops.
Premier Ahmad Ghavam es-Sul
tanch was not present at the press
conference, but Firouz spoke in a
low voice and said the aged Pre
mier was resting in an adjoining
room.
Firouz said the negotiations be
gun in Moscow last month by Gha
vam to bring about "a complete set
tlement of all outstanding ques
tions between Iran and Russia are
being continued in Tehran."
Informed political circles believe
these negotiations, being carried on
between Ghavam and Aussian Am
bassador Ivan Sadchikov, cover
these four points:
1. Azerbaijan.
2. Oil concessions.
Fisheries in the southern
Caspian Sea.
4. A Russian railway company
operating in northern Iran.
Firouz admitted that Iranian au
thorities still are unable to enter
Azerbaijan and that "Premier" Jaa
far Pishcvari of the autonomous
Azerbaijan stale has made no eflort
to establish relations with the Teh
ran government.
