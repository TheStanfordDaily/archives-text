tice of Igor Gouzcnko who, while
serving as cipher clerk in its embassy
here, turned against his country and
delivered information concerning a
Russian spy ring to Canadian au
thorities.
The embassy issued a statement
denouncing Gouzcnko as a thief.
His "statements are completely ficti
tious and deserve no credit." it said.
It made no mention of the secret
documents which Gouzcnko smug
gled from the military attache's of
fice and turned over to the Canadian
government, nor of the fact that un
der generally accepted views. Soviet
Russia must consider him a traitor.
The statement said he had stolen
money from the embassy and is in

case of his return to the USSR."
As a result of Gouzenko's revela
tions, a royal commission has been
investigating the Soviet spy ring for
weeks and 13 Canadians await trial
