## 
### 
NEW YORK, April 4 (UP).—The United Nations
Security Council turned its gravest crisis into a tri
umph for its infant charter today and paved the way
for Russian return to its meetings by shelving Iranian
| discussions until May 6, new deadline for complete

'Soviet evacuation of Iran.
Australia, lone dissenter at a
happy and historic meeting, re
frained from voting on the resolu
tion for postponement of discussion
i and reserved the right to raise the
j Iranian question at any time on the
ground that the Council failed to
face the real issues in the crisis.
But afterward Chief Australian
. Delegate Col. W. R. Hodgson said:
"I am happy the way it turned
| out."
Byrnes Hero of Victory
At a meeting of world importance
! the Council adopted by nine votes —
I Australia refraining — a resolution
!by Secretary of State James F.
! Byrnes, hero of this victory for the
rights of small nations, providing:
1. Adjournment of Iranian dis
cussions until May 6 at which time
| Russia and Iran are asked to report
j whether Russia has completed her
evacuation of Iran—unconditional-
I ly
2. If Russia, Iran, or any Security
| Council member reports develop
ments which delay or threaten to
delay prompt Russian withdrawal
the Council shall consider such re
ports as the first item on its pro-
I gram.
Council Adjourns
The Council adjourned until 3
j p.m. Tuesday and delegates went off
| to a harmony luncheon at which
Russian Chief Delegate Andrei A.
Gromyko, his eight - day Council
boycott ended, was present. Tues
day he is to take his seat at the
Council table.
Iranian Delegate Hussejn Ala ac
- cepted the Council's solution of the
crisis with the important reserva
tion that the Russians take with
| them all their equipment and not
leave it for the rebels in Azerbaijan
jprovince.
Delegates were in a gay mood
when they met at 11:09 a.m. Ira
nian Ala, smiling at the victory his
country had won, was invited to the
I table and Byrnes offered his reso
i lution at once.
j "The result is that the United
: Nations is truly a center for har
■ monizing the actions of nations in
j the attainment of common ends."
Hodgson alone was glum. After
he made his dissenting speech he
j sat hunched in his chair, his arms
folded, his face grim and flushed. A
couple of times he turned abruptly
to make some comment to Byrnes,
on his right.
Ala Addresses Council
Ala, addressing the Council,
pointed out that Iran's acceptance
of the Council solution was based
I on the unconditional withdrawal of
the Red Army and the fact that the
Russo-Iranian case remains on the
Council program.
But he added:
"As soon as these troops and their
equipment arc removed from Iran
and the country returns to normal
I am confident that my government
will be prepared to deal with all
i questions of legitimate interest
which affect its relations with its
I northern neighbor in a spirit of
s understanding and friendliness.
". . . It is our hope that it will
j be unnecessary for us to come again
J before you but if that should prove
j necessary we shall come with full
] faith and confidence."
Delegates Support Byrnes
After Byrnes introduced his cri
sis-smashing resolution delegate
; after delegate rose to support and
I thank him — Egypt, Brazil, Great
Britain. Poland — Russia's lone
Council supporter — Mexico, and
France. It looked as if it would be
unanimous. But then Hodgson rose.
