# Why Not Teach Photography?
## 
### 
Since the founding of Stanford, photog
raphy has been climbing steadily toward
prominence as a profession and as a hobby.
Fifty years ago it would have been termed
"pli mb foolishness" to teach photography at
a college. Now, however, a photographic
collide would be a valuable contribution to
Stanford's much boasted liberal education.
Now the wartime shortages are less acute,
and amateurs everywhere (including Stan
ford) are dusting off their cameras with pent
up eagerness to make more and better pic
tures.
There is a catch to the term "better pic
tures." Some camera owners have a natural
talent for using their equipment effectively.
But self-teaching is a slow and laborious
process for most. Practically every amateur
who is interested in photography would be
interested in a course coordinated to teach its
fundamentals.
Stanford boasts of its "well-rounded" edu
cation, but it has given little recognition to
photography. There are several darkrooms
on campus. Both the Quad and Daily have
facilities available for their student photog
raphers; Lagunita Court has a darkroom
which has been closed during the war years.
These darkrooms do not begin to solve the
problem; they offer only a tantalizing
glimpse of the facilities which Stanford might
install. They are available to a limited num

ber of students, most of whom are profes
sionals who have already had some formal
training in photography.
Ten thousand dollars was recently grant
ed to the California School of Fine Arts for
the establishment of a Department of Pho
tography. This was done with the primary
intention of training students who wished to
become professional photographers.
We do not suggest that Stanford try to imi
tate such highly specialized training. There
is no reason for us to establish a complete
new department. But Stanford should be
able to offer at least one course in the funda
mentals of photography. It could be includ
ed in the Department of Graphic Art.
With a few units work the average student
could become better acquainted with his
camera than he could with many years of
muddling through. He could study the fun
damental camera mechanism in class and
take pictures on field trips or campus assign
ments. He could learn the use of filters and
flash bulbs and have laboratory practice "in
developing and printing and enlarging.
Students come to college because it offers
training far more advanced than the average
high school can give them. However, many
high schools have had better facilities than
Stanford in the photographic field. It need
not continue so in the future. Encouragement
of photography is a challenge which can be
met. L.E.

Ten thousand dollars was recently grant

We do not suggest that Stanford try to imi

is no reason for us to establish a complete
new department. But Stanford should be
able to offer at least one course in the funda
mentals of photography. It could be includ

With a few units work the average student
could become better acquainted with his

take pictures on field trips or campus assign

flash bulbs and have laboratory practice "in
developing and printing and enlarging.
Students come to college because it offers
training far more advanced than the average

Fifty years ago it would have been termed
"pli mb foolishness" to teach photography at
a college. Now, however, a photographic

Stanford's much boasted liberal education.
Now the wartime shortages are less acute,

up eagerness to make more and better pic

There is a catch to the term "better pic

talent for using their equipment effectively.
But self-teaching is a slow and laborious
process for most. Practically every amateur
who is interested in photography would be
interested in a course coordinated to teach its
fundamentals.
Stanford boasts of its "well-rounded" edu

photography. There are several darkrooms
