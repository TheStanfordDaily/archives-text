No laughs. This is da straight dope.
Mr. H. D. Thoreau of the above "Bull Session"
Thoreaus had occasion last quarter to mention the
American Veterans' Committee in his column.
Said he, "Our opinion is that if one feels the need
for joining a veterans' group, the A.V.C. is by far
the least offensive."
Night before last we stopped at the coke ma
chine near the Nitery and much against our will
a friend pulled us into the first campus meeting of
the A.V.C.
For a little over an hour we heard Vic Mina
han and Jack Briggs explain the A.V.C'., its aims,
and organization. We are very sorry that Mr.
Thoreau didn't attend the meeting. For if he
had. we feel sure that his left-handed compli
ment of last quarter would have made even his
evil old soul blush with shame.
We frankly don't like the American Legion, its
beer-bust aims, and its degradation into a league
of "remember the time at Camp Shanks when
we . . ." We are skeptical of any and all organiza
tions that go out to save the world in one easy
lesson.
But after last nights meeting (and subsequent
investigation) we feel that the A.V.C. is well on the
way. Saving the world is a pretty big order. But
if you want confidence in the much-bellowed,
little- followed, old-fashioned American democ
racy, run by the people, then Oscar me boy come
wit me next Wednesday night.
We are not trying to sell the A.V.C. to you.
OH NO? No, we're not. You can't sell a man

the feeling that pervades the A.V.C. Either he
got it or he don't.
However, we feel that there are many men
who are of the same mind that we were before
we stopped in at the meeting. Sure it might slip
into nothing but a social group. Sure it is hard
to exert pressure on the government, sure, sure,
sure. It sounds so trite and worn, so dog-eared
and simple to babble, "Do you want your son
to go up through Italy with another 45th division
or into Leyte with the 96th?" But listen, Joe, do
you or don't you?
Don't do me any favors, Mac. I hate women.
I hate kids. I hale everybody and as soon as I get
my degree I'm going to jump ofen the Bay Bridge.
But if you are interested in sticking around for
a while or having your kid have a civilian life
from start to finish, then it is up to you.
Someone is going to purport to speak for the
veterans. There will he over !2,000,000 veterans
in a few years. The college men are the logical
contenders for the heavyweight crown and the
crown lies heavy on their head. If you want to
tilt it off and let some other guy worry about it—
don't forget—you muffed it, Mac.
To the men who are urgently interested in
making their two to five years of service really
count for something: We ask you to go to one—
just one—A.V.C. meeting. To just stand on the
side lines and predict failure is the quickest way
to insure failure. Next Wednesday night the A.V.C.
will hold its second meeting in the Nitery. Give
them one chance.
No laughs. This is da straight dope.

into nothing but a social group. Sure it is hard
to exert pressure on the government, sure, sure,
sure. It sounds so trite and worn, so dog-eared
and simple to babble, "Do you want your son
to go up through Italy with another 45th division
or into Leyte with the 96th?" But listen, Joe, do
you or don't you?
Don't do me any favors, Mac. I hate women.
I hate kids. I hale everybody and as soon as I get
my degree I'm going to jump ofen the Bay Bridge.
But if you are interested in sticking around for
a while or having your kid have a civilian life
from start to finish, then it is up to you.
Someone is going to purport to speak for the
veterans. There will he over !2,000,000 veterans
in a few years. The college men are the logical
contenders for the heavyweight crown and the
crown lies heavy on their head. If you want to
tilt it off and let some other guy worry about it—
don't forget—you muffed it, Mac.
To the men who are urgently interested in
making their two to five years of service really
count for something: We ask you to go to one—
just one—A.V.C. meeting. To just stand on the
side lines and predict failure is the quickest way
to insure failure. Next Wednesday night the A.V.C.
will hold its second meeting in the Nitery. Give
them one chance.
No laughs. This is da straight dope.
Mr. H. D. Thoreau of the above "Bull Session"
Thoreaus had occasion last quarter to mention the
American Veterans' Committee in his column.
Said he, "Our opinion is that if one feels the need
for joining a veterans' group, the A.V.C. is by far
the least offensive."
Night before last we stopped at the coke ma
chine near the Nitery and much against our will
a friend pulled us into the first campus meeting of
the A.V.C.
For a little over an hour we heard Vic Mina
han and Jack Briggs explain the A.V.C'., its aims,
and organization. We are very sorry that Mr.
Thoreau didn't attend the meeting. For if he
had. we feel sure that his left-handed compli
ment of last quarter would have made even his
evil old soul blush with shame.
We frankly don't like the American Legion, its
beer-bust aims, and its degradation into a league
of "remember the time at Camp Shanks when
we . . ." We are skeptical of any and all organiza
tions that go out to save the world in one easy
lesson.
But after last nights meeting (and subsequent
investigation) we feel that the A.V.C. is well on the
way. Saving the world is a pretty big order. But
if you want confidence in the much-bellowed,
little- followed, old-fashioned American democ
racy, run by the people, then Oscar me boy come
wit me next Wednesday night.
We are not trying to sell the A.V.C. to you.
OH NO? No, we're not. You can't sell a man

the feeling that pervades the A.V.C. Either he
got it or he don't.
However, we feel that there are many men
who are of the same mind that we were before
we stopped in at the meeting. Sure it might slip
into nothing but a social group. Sure it is hard
to exert pressure on the government, sure, sure,
sure. It sounds so trite and worn, so dog-eared
