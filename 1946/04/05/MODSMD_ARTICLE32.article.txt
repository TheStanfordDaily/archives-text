### BILL STEIF 
Over in England at Lichfield we note that the
courtmartials of nine enlisted men and a half-dozen
officers accused of complicity in beating G.I. pris
oners at the Lichfield Guardhouse drag on.
Yesterday came the news that the defense coun
sel for the 15 accused men had challenged the
jurisdiction of th i ? Lichfield courtmartial on the
ground that Maj. Gen. .John T. Lewis had tried to
"railroad" the nine enlisted men.
The chief legal ace for the defendants accused
Lewis of offering to shorten the sentences of the
G.l.'s if they would agree not to implicate their
immediate commanding officers. And for this rea
son the defendants' lawyer, Frank A. Johnson,
wants the trial removed from Europo to some spot
where a fair and impartial hearing can be had.
The whole business is further complicated by
the fact that Gen. Lewis is European Western Base
Section Commandvr and theoretically has nothing
«'tt. all to do with the trial. Instead, a certain Col.
Claude M. Thiele, who is C.O. of all American
troops in the United Kingdom according to our
scorecard, is the officially appointed authority for
the court. But the defense lawyer, Johnson, says
that Thiele is just "a puppet of Gen. Lewis whose
command has usurped the power of the London
command in regard to these trials."
This melange of half-facts, criminations, and
recriminations seems to support lawyer Johnson's
assertion that "something smells."
And it further seems to support his contention

that the trial needs to be moved from the fetid
and fouled area of Lichfield to new and fresh
grounds.
This whole case has not received, in our opin
ion, as much publicity as it should get. Only the
Chicago Sun, of the half-dozen or so newspapers
we have managed to peruse with fair regularity
during the last four months, has consistently car
ried material concerning Lichfield.
We think that this is an important case because
it reveals how ineptly the Army's politicians act.
We think it is important because it turns a glaring
spotlight upon the Army's antiquated and often
unjust courtmartial system. We think it is impor
tant because it strips down the differences between
officers and enlisted men —brutality is a common
denominator among all men.
We may be wrong about what we have said in
the preceding paragraph. There are a lot of things
we don't know about this Lichfield sadism. But
we do think that moving the trial to this side of
the Atlantic and giving it the coverage it warrants
may somehow help to renovate a few men's atti
tudes about our Army. Lots of people have already
jumped on the so-called "brass"; there's no trick
to that and, in fact, one has occasionally to sympa
thize with the honest m°n in the Army who are
trying to do an honest job. The trouble is that
honesty in astigmatic men doesn't mean much.
The Lichfield trial should restore 20-20 vision
to some chaos.
