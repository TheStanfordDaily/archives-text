### LARRY FRANKLEY GEORGE ECKSTEIN 
As San Francisco offers nothing
to the jazz public except Lu Wat
te rs and his Yerba Buena Jazz
Band, we will endeavor to discuss
briefly (?) the musical happenings
in the nation's second most hep
town—Los Angeles.
The best kicks in town come
from the guitar of Arv Garrison,
who is featured with the Vivian
Garry Trio playing nightly at the
Suzie Q in Hollywood, and young
pianist, Andre Previn—the find of
the year. The Vivian Garry Trio
is from New York where they
have just finished a very suc
cessful stand.
Garrison has played the "box"
for a number of years and has
learned most of his artistry from
the records of Django Reinhardt,
although his style certainly is not
an imitation. Although Arv is THE
attraction, Vivian Garry (Mrs. Gar
rison) is the bass-"man" and sings
in a very pleasing manner. Watch
this trio to replace a better-known
trio at a famous Sunset Strip nit
ery.
The most exciting session we
attended was Previn's sitting in
with Garrison and his "better"
half, which had everyone raving
with enthusiasm as the two musi
cians complement each other per
fectly. It looks as if some disc
dates will he in store for Arv and
Andre.
Previn has been spending most of
his time in the recording studio,
and his latest triumph is an album
of Ellington compositions for Eddie
Laguna's Sunset label. It is a six
sided album with five trio sides and
one solo. The trio was composed of
Red Callender, who is causing plen
ty of comment around town with
his big-tonecl bass work, and Irv
ing Ashbee, who is playing guitar
with the Erldie Beal Trio and who
iust recently turned down a job
with the Duke. Look for this album
in a few weeks—the best this year.
Also featured at the Suzie-Q is
the modern Debussy, Errol Gar
ner (is he kidding?). Now play
ing less of his drag style, which
caused the New York critics to
elect him as the New Star pian
ist of the year and caused us no
end of discomfort and displeas
ure, Garner is really proving his
genius. The thing that makes him
great is that he is not another
Tatum, Cole, or Wilson, but that
he is Garner for better or worse.
His renditions of such standards
as "Embraceahle You." "Sweet
Lorraine," and "Nighl and Day"
can certainly he classified as
great.
Playing with Garner, Garrison,
and Garry is Graves—Joe, that is.
Graves is the trumpeter that Ray

Bauduc, former Bob-cat drummer,
brought from New Orleans for his
newly formed quintet. Although
Joe often gets off with a little too
much volume, his ideas and tech
nique are fine, and if he stays away
from the Gillespie school, he is des
tined for the top. Bauduc's out
fit is one of those typical comhos
that one will find in most of the
Hollywood nightspots although Bau
duc's drums and Graves' trumpet
lift the band out of the mediocre
class.
Nat Cole, Oscar Moore, and
Johnny Miller are still packing
them in at the Troc with Spike
Jones driving them away in the
next room. The Cole Trio is still
the best, but could it he that Os
car is unhappy? His guitar cer
tainly sounds that way!
Of course, the biggest success in
town is being enjoyed by the maes
tro (oreeny) himself, Slim Gaillard
of "Cement Mixer" fame. Slim with
Harry the Hipster and Milton De-
Lugg (don't ask us how an accor
dion got into Berg's after Dizzy,
Heywood, and Hawkins) make
Billy Berg's the biggest commercial
success since Guy Lombardo re
corded with Hildegarde.
Manone is in town with his
Dixieland outfit opening the Tom-
Tom on Sunset. Manone is still
good music, hut his hand isn't up
to his usual par. There is an
other Boh Zurke playing inter
mission piano, and we don't even
know his name. * * * Jimmy Hig
soh and his Teen-Agers are still
jobbing around town and playing
their fancy, oft-times overdone
arrangements.
George Handy, Boyd Raeburn
and Vivian Garry arranger, is now
the rage of Musicdom with his
weird scorings. His conception of
jazz music is great, but if he doesn't
keep a little on the sane side with
his music, it cannot survive. * * *
Benny Carter is playing wonder
fully at the Trianon, a ballroom in
Southgate.
The big news is that Art Tatum
is coming to Berg's in the sum
mer, and Woody Herman and his
Herd are scheduled for the Ca
sino Gardens in July.

that one will find in most of the
Hollywood nightspots although Bau
duc's drums and Graves' trumpet
lift the band out of the mediocre
class.
Nat Cole, Oscar Moore, and
Johnny Miller are still packing
them in at the Troc with Spike
Jones driving them away in the
next room. The Cole Trio is still
the best, but could it he that Os
car is unhappy? His guitar cer
tainly sounds that way!
Of course, the biggest success in
town is being enjoyed by the maes
tro (oreeny) himself, Slim Gaillard
of "Cement Mixer" fame. Slim with
Harry the Hipster and Milton De-
Lugg (don't ask us how an accor
dion got into Berg's after Dizzy,
Heywood, and Hawkins) make
Billy Berg's the biggest commercial
success since Guy Lombardo re
corded with Hildegarde.
Manone is in town with his
Dixieland outfit opening the Tom-
Tom on Sunset. Manone is still
good music, hut his hand isn't up
to his usual par. There is an
other Boh Zurke playing inter
mission piano, and we don't even
know his name. * * * Jimmy Hig
soh and his Teen-Agers are still
jobbing around town and playing
their fancy, oft-times overdone
arrangements.
George Handy, Boyd Raeburn
and Vivian Garry arranger, is now
the rage of Musicdom with his
weird scorings. His conception of
jazz music is great, but if he doesn't
keep a little on the sane side with
his music, it cannot survive. * * *
Benny Carter is playing wonder
fully at the Trianon, a ballroom in
Southgate.
The big news is that Art Tatum
is coming to Berg's in the sum
mer, and Woody Herman and his
Herd are scheduled for the Ca
sino Gardens in July.
As San Francisco offers nothing
to the jazz public except Lu Wat
te rs and his Yerba Buena Jazz
Band, we will endeavor to discuss
briefly (?) the musical happenings
in the nation's second most hep
town—Los Angeles.
The best kicks in town come
from the guitar of Arv Garrison,
who is featured with the Vivian
Garry Trio playing nightly at the
Suzie Q in Hollywood, and young
pianist, Andre Previn—the find of
the year. The Vivian Garry Trio
is from New York where they
have just finished a very suc
cessful stand.
Garrison has played the "box"
for a number of years and has
learned most of his artistry from
the records of Django Reinhardt,
although his style certainly is not
an imitation. Although Arv is THE
attraction, Vivian Garry (Mrs. Gar
rison) is the bass-"man" and sings
in a very pleasing manner. Watch
this trio to replace a better-known
trio at a famous Sunset Strip nit
ery.
The most exciting session we
attended was Previn's sitting in
with Garrison and his "better"
half, which had everyone raving
with enthusiasm as the two musi
cians complement each other per
fectly. It looks as if some disc
dates will he in store for Arv and
Andre.
Previn has been spending most of
his time in the recording studio,
and his latest triumph is an album
of Ellington compositions for Eddie
Laguna's Sunset label. It is a six
sided album with five trio sides and
one solo. The trio was composed of
Red Callender, who is causing plen
ty of comment around town with
his big-tonecl bass work, and Irv
ing Ashbee, who is playing guitar
with the Erldie Beal Trio and who
iust recently turned down a job
with the Duke. Look for this album
in a few weeks—the best this year.
Also featured at the Suzie-Q is
the modern Debussy, Errol Gar
ner (is he kidding?). Now play
ing less of his drag style, which
caused the New York critics to
elect him as the New Star pian
ist of the year and caused us no
end of discomfort and displeas
ure, Garner is really proving his
genius. The thing that makes him
great is that he is not another
Tatum, Cole, or Wilson, but that
he is Garner for better or worse.
His renditions of such standards
as "Embraceahle You." "Sweet
Lorraine," and "Nighl and Day"
can certainly he classified as
great.
Playing with Garner, Garrison,
and Garry is Graves—Joe, that is.
Graves is the trumpeter that Ray

Bauduc, former Bob-cat drummer,
brought from New Orleans for his
newly formed quintet. Although
Joe often gets off with a little too
much volume, his ideas and tech
nique are fine, and if he stays away
from the Gillespie school, he is des
tined for the top. Bauduc's out
fit is one of those typical comhos
that one will find in most of the
Hollywood nightspots although Bau

with enthusiasm as the two musi
cians complement each other per
fectly. It looks as if some disc
dates will he in store for Arv and
Andre.
Previn has been spending most of
his time in the recording studio,
and his latest triumph is an album
of Ellington compositions for Eddie
Laguna's Sunset label. It is a six
sided album with five trio sides and
one solo. The trio was composed of
Red Callender, who is causing plen
ty of comment around town with
his big-tonecl bass work, and Irv
ing Ashbee, who is playing guitar
with the Erldie Beal Trio and who
iust recently turned down a job
with the Duke. Look for this album
in a few weeks—the best this year.
Also featured at the Suzie-Q is
the modern Debussy, Errol Gar
ner (is he kidding?). Now play
ing less of his drag style, which
caused the New York critics to
elect him as the New Star pian
ist of the year and caused us no
end of discomfort and displeas
ure, Garner is really proving his
genius. The thing that makes him
great is that he is not another
Tatum, Cole, or Wilson, but that
he is Garner for better or worse.
His renditions of such standards
as "Embraceahle You." "Sweet
Lorraine," and "Nighl and Day"
can certainly he classified as
great.
Playing with Garner, Garrison,
and Garry is Graves—Joe, that is.
Graves is the trumpeter that Ray

Bauduc, former Bob-cat drummer,
brought from New Orleans for his
newly formed quintet. Although
Joe often gets off with a little too
much volume, his ideas and tech
nique are fine, and if he stays away
from the Gillespie school, he is des
tined for the top. Bauduc's out
fit is one of those typical comhos
that one will find in most of the
Hollywood nightspots although Bau
duc's drums and Graves' trumpet
lift the band out of the mediocre
class.
Nat Cole, Oscar Moore, and
Johnny Miller are still packing
them in at the Troc with Spike
Jones driving them away in the
next room. The Cole Trio is still
the best, but could it he that Os
car is unhappy? His guitar cer
tainly sounds that way!
Of course, the biggest success in
town is being enjoyed by the maes
tro (oreeny) himself, Slim Gaillard
of "Cement Mixer" fame. Slim with
Harry the Hipster and Milton De-
Lugg (don't ask us how an accor
dion got into Berg's after Dizzy,
Heywood, and Hawkins) make
Billy Berg's the biggest commercial
success since Guy Lombardo re
corded with Hildegarde.
Manone is in town with his
Dixieland outfit opening the Tom-
Tom on Sunset. Manone is still
good music, hut his hand isn't up
to his usual par. There is an
other Boh Zurke playing inter
mission piano, and we don't even
know his name. * * * Jimmy Hig
soh and his Teen-Agers are still
jobbing around town and playing
their fancy, oft-times overdone
arrangements.
George Handy, Boyd Raeburn
and Vivian Garry arranger, is now
the rage of Musicdom with his
weird scorings. His conception of
jazz music is great, but if he doesn't
keep a little on the sane side with
his music, it cannot survive. * * *
Benny Carter is playing wonder
fully at the Trianon, a ballroom in
Southgate.
The big news is that Art Tatum
is coming to Berg's in the sum
mer, and Woody Herman and his
Herd are scheduled for the Ca
sino Gardens in July.
As San Francisco offers nothing
to the jazz public except Lu Wat
te rs and his Yerba Buena Jazz
Band, we will endeavor to discuss
briefly (?) the musical happenings
in the nation's second most hep
town—Los Angeles.
The best kicks in town come
from the guitar of Arv Garrison,
who is featured with the Vivian
Garry Trio playing nightly at the
Suzie Q in Hollywood, and young
pianist, Andre Previn—the find of
the year. The Vivian Garry Trio
is from New York where they
have just finished a very suc
cessful stand.
Garrison has played the "box"
for a number of years and has
learned most of his artistry from
the records of Django Reinhardt,
although his style certainly is not
an imitation. Although Arv is THE
attraction, Vivian Garry (Mrs. Gar
rison) is the bass-"man" and sings
in a very pleasing manner. Watch
this trio to replace a better-known
trio at a famous Sunset Strip nit
ery.
The most exciting session we
attended was Previn's sitting in
with Garrison and his "better"
half, which had everyone raving
with enthusiasm as the two musi
cians complement each other per
fectly. It looks as if some disc
dates will he in store for Arv and
Andre.
