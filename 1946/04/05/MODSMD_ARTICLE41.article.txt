U.C.L.A. and U.S.C. are at it again. The hair-pulling this time is caused
by statements made by Hert Furth, Westwood sports ed, who accuses the
cross-town hacks, the Trojans, of using backhanded practices in securing
athletes for the U.S.C. plant.
Lucien Gandolfo, who puts out patter called Gaudy Gabs over S.C.
way, retorts that U.C.L.A. engages in the same nasty business of lower
scholastic requirements in order to permit athletes, who are not of the
highest intellectual caliber, to enter college. "Lucy" then goes on to say
the only reason athletes come to Troy is because of superior coaches.
That statement calls for a good old-fashioned horse-laugh.
The whole scrap smacks of two thieves, both trying to alibi their way
out of a bank robbery job they pulled. U.S.C. is notorious for their attitude
toward athletes. Nor do they hit a brick wall when brains happen to be
a minus quality of the prospective student. "Dumb athletes at U.S.C." is
a common trademark, only outranked in fame by such common household
words as "There's a Ford in your future."
What promoted Furth of Bruin fame to cast invectives Trojan way
was the report that Jim Pollard, ace basket bailer, is 'planning on en
rolling at the liufus Von Kleinsmed U.. and will perform for Sam Barry's
basketball five next season.
Elongated Pollard attended Stanford a few years ago, but left for the
armed services. After his discharge, he played in the A.A.U. circuit with
the San Diego Dons. He won high honors, made all-league team, while
performing lor Dr. William Rice's San Diegans.
A number of stories have been in circulation that Pollard was going to
go to U.S.C., and even the story goes, he planned on going to Kansas State.
As the matter now stands, Jim Pollard hasn't decided what his future
plans are to be. He wants to return to Stanford, but he was minus a
considerable amount, so his return to the Farm depends on scholastic
records.

U.S.C. would probably accept Pollard, but he would have to make up
his work to a "C" average, which would take about two semesters.
Furth comnlaincd that U.S.C. 'vould he accepting a student who
dunked out of Stanford. Furth is wrong in stating that Pollard flunked
out of Stanford, hut he does have the right idea when he says that U.S.C.
is pretty "lenient" in regard to entrance of athletes.
The only part of Gandolfo's reply that makes sense is that U.C.L.A.
is no innocent babe in the game of getting athletes. That school's recent
effort to obtain Buddy Young is a too recent affair to forget.

Mr. Bob Peck, normally a very calm fellow, is all worked up in a dither
about the sports outlook at Stanford. Gloomily predicting the day when
we will meet Marin J.C. in basketball, and Willows Hi in football, Mr.
Peck, who hails from New York, hopes Stanford will be a little more
lenient in regard to the policy of admitting athletes to the Farm.
But Senor Roberto's one fault is gauging his predictions by per
formance this year. Stanford's dismal performance this year hasn't been
because of high scholastic requirements, but because there was a lack of
experienced men to play on the teams, notably basketball, and now
baseball.
A number of hardwood men plan on attending Stanford as
soon as they are released from the armed services. Howie Dallmar, Dave
Berlin, Ken Davidson, and Morley Thompson are just a few of the high
caliber men who plan on coming back to Stanford. And the records don't
have to be dropped an iota to let any of these men attend the Red and
White University.
The football perspective isn't as dismal as Mr. Peck might have some
people believe, either. A goodly portion of the highly successful '42 frosh
squad is back, and others will be back by next fall. And again, the rec
ords haven't been hoodwinked at.
The primary function of a university is education. If the athletic pro
gram can be fitted in without tampering with scholastic marks, fine. If
it can't, then athletics should be relegated to a secondary role.
But this is no time for crocodile tears. Stanford will fare all right.
They have done so in the past. Don't worry too much, Mr. Peck. You
might even be an Indian rooter at the Rose Bowl nexi year. Who knows?
