# Visitors Fresh from Victory Over Santa Clara Baseballers
## 
### 
San Francisco University's Dons
I will risk their perfect season record
j of two wins and no losses on the
| Sunken Diamond tomorrow after
; noon at 2:30 when they engage Harry
I Wolter's patched up Stanford outfit.
The visitors eked out a victory
over St. Mary's in the first tilt
of the season by a score of 7 to (i.
Santa Clara next succumbed to the
| Dons, going down 5 to 2. Ed Gar
! cia was the big noise in both wins,
taking credit for the Gael win by
his six-bit eight-inning stint. lie
came back to limit the Bronco bat
ters to a meager four blows as he
went the lull route. A right-hand
| er, he figures to give the Farm
stick me n a nice assortment to look
over.
Most of the team's experience is
centered on two boys who are both
from the same town in Wisconsin.
i They are Ed Granitz, shortstop, and
| Paul Schramka, who cavorts in the
I center meadow. Both had the dis
tinction of playing in the Esquire
Ail-American boys ball game at the
Polo Grounds last year. Schramka
leads the Dons in batting with a
hefty .375 mark. Granitz is close
with a neat .300 average.
Fred Shew, a footballer in the
fall season is the distance hitter of
the visiting crowd. Although he
owns a meek .222 average the mus
j cle man is capable of blasting the
pill a long way if he connects.
In comparison to the locals, San
Francisco will start a smooth field
ing nine. Only two errors have been
charged to them in 18 innings of
! play-

On the local front, Card coach
Wolter isn't sure who he'll open with
I tomorrow. If Larry Prato's hand is
in good enough shape, he'll be on the
j hot corner. And either Bob Peters,
j who is still troubled with a spike
gash on his knee or Ray Winterhal
j ter, who has been fielding excellent
| ly in recent practices will get the
nod in the short field. Tom Howard
; will probably be on second, but Bob
j Rosburg is figuring close to the top.
Lloyd Merriman is a good bet to
, crack the first string for the first time
1 this season at the initial sack.
Carl Kelenberger and George
i Sloat are set for the two outfield
i slots and either Jim Wiekersham
or Don Gabrelson will start at the
i third post.
Frank McGraw, Stanford's major
i candidate for the all-coast com
bination, will be behind the plate
j as usual.
Phil Wolf and Dick Flatland are
two likely hurling choices and it is
a possibility that the two will share
the mound duties.
