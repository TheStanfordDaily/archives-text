You'll meet one James McClure, one

the special photo contest sponsored
jointly by Cap and Gown and the
Stanford Press.

Any student now attending Stan
ford, with or without professional
experience, may compete. Photo
graphs wanted are pictures of cam

spots such as Yosemite and Carmel,
large scale student activities, and un
usual action shots.
Prizes of $25 and $10 will be
awarded to the two best photos. Only

the Stanford Press. The photos will
be used as illustrations for the calen
dar to be printed next fall.
