# CAMPUS OPINION

(OK OFF-CAMPUS OPINION)
Since when are students of Stan
ford University Schools of Nursing
and Medicine in San Francisco dif
ferent from Students of Stanford
University Schools of Nursing and
Medicine on the campus?
Docs 45 miles of Bayshore
Highway change the familiar stu
dent of cords or plaid skirts into
some anonymous apparition the
moment he or she dons a uniform
or lab coat? Should privileges and
courtesies be allotted students
on the campus and on their re
turn to said campus be suddenly
withdrawn juM because these
men and women have a slightly
more specialized course of study
in a different locality?
The writers of this letter are stu
dent nurses and we are peeved
about an indignity that occurred to
one of our colleagues. She was not
enrolled in Stanford University on
the campus for her pre-nursing, but

| is now in the A.S.S.U. by virtue of
i her enrollment in the School of
I Nursing. Foi» one of her rare (be
j lieve me!) days off, she anticipated
| a trip to the campus for some ca
j noeing and swimming at the boat
i house and to show it off to her fi
ance. (She feels like part of the
Stanford Family.)
And, ever so politely, she ap
proached one of our Big Burly
Boathouse Boys to ask the whys
and wherefores of obtaining a ca
noe. Thusly seeing her lack of fa
miliarity with procedures, the Boy
took her for a stranger, and rightly
so, and refused.
BUT, the big blow came when
she drew out her Cadet Nurse
Corps card with Stanford Uni
versity School of Nursing printed
on it in large black letters; when
he asked if she was from San
Francisco, she said yes—so with
a flippant shrug he answered.
"Sorry, the boathouse facilities
are available only to students on
campus."
We, writing this letter, were cam
pus students and have, among us,
been down almost weekly to enjoy
every privilege and facility which
we used to enjoy—twice as much,
probably, as you campus students
because we haven't it at our finger
tips. For us who work hard for it
all week, it is a breath of fresh air
and the vision of lush countryside
gratefully appreciated after the
long days of four walls, a ceiling, a
floor, paved streets, and cramped
buildings.
We are tired of being an isolated
contingent of Stanford students. We
think we are doing a decent enough
piece of work and that we deserve a
little relaxation once in a while, not
to mention the permission to visit
siblings enrolled there.
Incidentally, all of our names—
like yours—are in the Bawlout; see
for yourselves!

P.S. Granted that the canoes in
question are owned specifically, ]
does anyone know where a few j
poor nurses and doctors can pur
chase one cheap?
(Editorial note: The writers
have a point. The Boathouse
should be theirs, just as much as
hours. How many of us carry the
heavy schedule that those gals
and their brother docs do?
Incidentally, at Exconi night
before last the question of what
to do with a couple of extra ca
noes came up. How about that,
Calf? Here are the customers!)


TO FILM BOMB TESTS—Planes lined up on deck of U.S. carrier Shangri-La, at Norfolk, Va„ that
will carry photographic and scientific equipment to record the action of the atomic bomb blast at Bikini
Atoll in the Pacific. Some of the planes will be pilotless and operated by remote control from other ships.

one of our colleagues. She was not
enrolled in Stanford University on
the campus for her pre-nursing, but

| is now in the A.S.S.U. by virtue of
i her enrollment in the School of
I Nursing. Foi» one of her rare (be
j lieve me!) days off, she anticipated
| a trip to the campus for some ca
j noeing and swimming at the boat
i house and to show it off to her fi
ance. (She feels like part of the
Stanford Family.)
And, ever so politely, she ap
proached one of our Big Burly
Boathouse Boys to ask the whys
and wherefores of obtaining a ca
noe. Thusly seeing her lack of fa
miliarity with procedures, the Boy
took her for a stranger, and rightly
so, and refused.
BUT, the big blow came when
she drew out her Cadet Nurse
Corps card with Stanford Uni
versity School of Nursing printed
on it in large black letters; when
he asked if she was from San
Francisco, she said yes—so with
a flippant shrug he answered.
"Sorry, the boathouse facilities
are available only to students on
campus."
We, writing this letter, were cam
pus students and have, among us,
been down almost weekly to enjoy
every privilege and facility which
we used to enjoy—twice as much,
probably, as you campus students
because we haven't it at our finger
tips. For us who work hard for it
all week, it is a breath of fresh air
and the vision of lush countryside
gratefully appreciated after the
long days of four walls, a ceiling, a
floor, paved streets, and cramped
buildings.
We are tired of being an isolated
contingent of Stanford students. We
think we are doing a decent enough
piece of work and that we deserve a
little relaxation once in a while, not
to mention the permission to visit
siblings enrolled there.
Incidentally, all of our names—
like yours—are in the Bawlout; see
for yourselves!
