# Housing Jam Stalemated; Navy Keeps Quonset Huts
## 
### 
Stanford's housing plans have taken a temporary slump with news
that the Navy has decided not to release the 37 Quonset huts at Tanforan
for which Stanford had applied to relieve its present critical housing
shortage.
Each Quonset hut was to have been divided into two apartments to

accommodate returned veterans.
Residents in the huts would have
had to commpute to the Farm, some
25 miles distant.
In lieu of the Quonset huts, the
University is negotiating with Navy
officials for the use of 100 family
units at Tanforan to house married
veterans, provided that the appli
cation will not prejudice its ap
plication to use Dibble Hospital if
and when it is released by the
Army.
The family units contemplated
are presently being used as bar
racks and would require sufficient
repairs to bring them up to Uni
versity housing standards. They
would be divided into family apart
ments.
Stanford's chief hope in its efforts
to relieve the housing situation,
however, lies at present in the pos
sible use of Dibble Hospital as
housing for single and married vet
erans. As yet there has been no
definite word from Army authori
ties as to when Dibble might be va
cated for University use.
