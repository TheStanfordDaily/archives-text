# Fraternities Offer Plan For Adviser
## Co-ordinator Asked As Possible Alternate For Housemothers 
### H.D. THOREAU 
A proposal that an inierfraternity
adviser be employed to provide bet
ter supervision for Stanford's Greek
letter men when their houses reopen
in September has been presented to
Dr. Trcsidder for study by the In
terfraternity Council and Board of
Control.
The plan was formulated and sub
mitted as an alternative to sugges
tions that housemothers or paid
proctors be employed to "insure fra
ternity conduct commensurate with
the high standards expected of Stan
ford men."
The fraternity houses, now oper
ated by the University as the presi
dent halls, will be returned to the
various chapters in June, leaving
three months in which to renovate
the houses before the fraternity men
move in at the beginning of next
autumn quarter.
The proposal, officially titled "Sug
gested Guidance Program for Un
dergraduate Chapters of Stanford
Fraternities," is patterned after the
successful "coordinator" plans in ef
fect at Dartmouth and U.C.L.A.
It points out that Interfraternity
Board already has sufficient author
ity to permit it to maintain in the
fraternity organizations "any degree
of discipline required by the uni
versity administration."
It was suggested that the proposed
advisor serve as head of a House
Affairs Committee under the Board,
and that he be paid entirely or in
part by the fraternities.
His responsibilities would be:
I. To coordinate all fraternity
affairs in the matters of conduct
