# Fraternities Offer Plan For Adviser
## Co-ordinator Asked As Possible Alternate For Housemothers 
### H.D. THOREAU 
A proposal that an inierfraternity
adviser be employed to provide bet
ter supervision for Stanford's Greek
letter men when their houses reopen
in September has been presented to
Dr. Trcsidder for study by the In
terfraternity Council and Board of
Control.
The plan was formulated and sub
mitted as an alternative to sugges
tions that housemothers or paid
proctors be employed to "insure fra
ternity conduct commensurate with
the high standards expected of Stan
ford men."
The fraternity houses, now oper
ated by the University as the presi
dent halls, will be returned to the
various chapters in June, leaving
three months in which to renovate
the houses before the fraternity men
move in at the beginning of next
autumn quarter.
The proposal, officially titled "Sug
gested Guidance Program for Un
dergraduate Chapters of Stanford
Fraternities," is patterned after the
successful "coordinator" plans in ef
fect at Dartmouth and U.C.L.A.
It points out that Interfraternity
Board already has sufficient author
ity to permit it to maintain in the
fraternity organizations "any degree
of discipline required by the uni
versity administration."
It was suggested that the proposed
advisor serve as head of a House
Affairs Committee under the Board,
and that he be paid entirely or in
part by the fraternities.
His responsibilities would be:
I. To coordinate all fraternity
affairs in the matters of conduct
and discipline, except formulation
of policy.
2. To advise the Hoard in form
ulation of policy concerning con
duct and discipline.
D. To provide continuity of guid
ance of undergraduate interfrater
nity organizations and chapter of
ficers from year to year.
4. To receive all complaints and
reports of infractions of rules and
misconduct from all sources that
concern fraternities as organiza
tions, take action on routine mat
ters ol this nature and in the case
of major incidents make recom
mendations to the Board for ac
tion, subject to review and veto
at all times by the President of the
University,
He would in addition be an ex
ofTicio advisory member of all com
mittees set up by intei'fraternity
council.
Gradual Changes Successful
The suggestion concludes with the
statement: "The experience of the
Interfraternity Board is that grad
ual changes are more apt to be suc
cessful than abrupt shifts. Convinc
ing of the students and getting their
hearty cooperation are invaluable
for the success of any plan. It is
well realized that no plan as set up
on paper will work perfectly and
that adjustments will have to be
made.
"It is also realized that lessons in
student government learned by stu
dents and student leaders, valuable
as they may be to the students in
volved, are frequently lost to the
chapters and the fraternities as a
whole as the students graduate.
Therefore, some program of pre
serving continuity of experience
gained is invaluable."
Housemother Proposed
The administration had insisted
that steps be taken to provide better
supervision for undergraduate chap
ters with regard to living standards
and living habits, and had suggested
the employment of housemothers.
This was objected to by the frater
nity groups as entailing both per
sonnel problems and rearrangement
of the houses to provide living quar
ters for a woman.
Dr. Tresidder has been working
with the Council and Board during
the past several months in an effort
to find the best solution to the prob
lem lacing the fraternities.

ated by the University as the presi
dent halls, will be returned to the
various chapters in June, leaving
three months in which to renovate
the houses before the fraternity men
move in at the beginning of next
autumn quarter.
The proposal, officially titled "Sug
gested Guidance Program for Un
dergraduate Chapters of Stanford
Fraternities," is patterned after the
successful "coordinator" plans in ef
fect at Dartmouth and U.C.L.A.
It points out that Interfraternity
Board already has sufficient author
ity to permit it to maintain in the
fraternity organizations "any degree
of discipline required by the uni
versity administration."
It was suggested that the proposed
advisor serve as head of a House
Affairs Committee under the Board,
and that he be paid entirely or in
part by the fraternities.
His responsibilities would be:
I. To coordinate all fraternity
affairs in the matters of conduct
and discipline, except formulation
of policy.
2. To advise the Hoard in form
ulation of policy concerning con
duct and discipline.
D. To provide continuity of guid
ance of undergraduate interfrater
nity organizations and chapter of
ficers from year to year.
4. To receive all complaints and
reports of infractions of rules and
misconduct from all sources that
concern fraternities as organiza
tions, take action on routine mat
ters ol this nature and in the case
of major incidents make recom
mendations to the Board for ac
tion, subject to review and veto
at all times by the President of the
University,
He would in addition be an ex
ofTicio advisory member of all com
mittees set up by intei'fraternity
council.
Gradual Changes Successful
The suggestion concludes with the
statement: "The experience of the
Interfraternity Board is that grad
ual changes are more apt to be suc
cessful than abrupt shifts. Convinc
ing of the students and getting their
hearty cooperation are invaluable
for the success of any plan. It is
well realized that no plan as set up
on paper will work perfectly and
that adjustments will have to be
made.
"It is also realized that lessons in
student government learned by stu
dents and student leaders, valuable
as they may be to the students in
volved, are frequently lost to the
chapters and the fraternities as a
whole as the students graduate.
Therefore, some program of pre
serving continuity of experience
gained is invaluable."
Housemother Proposed
The administration had insisted
that steps be taken to provide better
supervision for undergraduate chap
ters with regard to living standards
and living habits, and had suggested
the employment of housemothers.
This was objected to by the frater
nity groups as entailing both per
sonnel problems and rearrangement
of the houses to provide living quar
ters for a woman.
Dr. Tresidder has been working
with the Council and Board during
the past several months in an effort
to find the best solution to the prob
lem lacing the fraternities.

adviser be employed to provide bet
ter supervision for Stanford's Greek

Control.
The plan was formulated and sub

the high standards expected of Stan
