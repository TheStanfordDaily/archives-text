### BILL STEIF 
Stanford's "Big Red Machine," a
i little rusty from four years of war
| lime disuse, rolls out to the football
! practice field at 3 p.m. today for its
i first sprint; session since 1943.
With the total turn-out expected
to approximate 100 men, Coach
Marchie Schwartz plans to Ret a
line-up in this vilal spring preview
on what kind of a team he can field
for Stanford's re-entry into Big-
Time football next fall.
Marchie, chief of the Farm's last
j Pacific Coast Confidence title con
tender in 1942, said yesterday, "Un-
I til we get out in the field we just
I can't tell what our prospects are."
Other than to say, "We'll be in
there scrapping," the head ciridman
j refused to make any predictions as
I to the caliber of football the In
j dians will display next autumn.
He contented himself with point
j ing out that Stanford has a nucleus
i of grid veterans back but that any
j one who comes out has a chance to
make the team because there are m>
i many unknown quantities in this
j spring's turn-out.
In addition to Schwartz, former
Notre Dame star. Phil Bengtson.
1 Chuck Taylor. Vic Lindskog, Flay

Hammett, Ed Stamm, and Pete
Kmetovic make up the Farm's
coaching staff.
