# Big Red Machine Rolls After 3 Years in Shed
## 
### BILL STEIF 
Stanford's "Big Red Machine," a
i little rusty from four years of war
| lime disuse, rolls out to the football
! practice field at 3 p.m. today for its
i first sprint; session since 1943.
With the total turn-out expected
to approximate 100 men, Coach
Marchie Schwartz plans to Ret a
line-up in this vilal spring preview
on what kind of a team he can field
for Stanford's re-entry into Big-
Time football next fall.
Marchie, chief of the Farm's last
j Pacific Coast Confidence title con
tender in 1942, said yesterday, "Un-
I til we get out in the field we just
I can't tell what our prospects are."
Other than to say, "We'll be in
there scrapping," the head ciridman
j refused to make any predictions as
I to the caliber of football the In
j dians will display next autumn.
He contented himself with point
j ing out that Stanford has a nucleus
i of grid veterans back but that any
j one who comes out has a chance to
make the team because there are m>
i many unknown quantities in this
j spring's turn-out.
In addition to Schwartz, former
Notre Dame star. Phil Bengtson.
1 Chuck Taylor. Vic Lindskog, Flay

Hammett, Ed Stamm, and Pete
Kmetovic make up the Farm's
coaching staff.
Bengtson. an all-Big-Ten end at
Minnesota in the early 19305, is


MARCIIIK SCHWARTZ
head line coach and will be
Schwartz's chief assistant. Each of
the other coaches will handle his
college grid specialty.
Taylor, Ail-American on Stan
ford's 1942 squad, will guide the
guards. Lindskog, an iron man
while playing on the Indians' 1940
Rose Bowl team, will instruct the
centers and the ends on defense,
j Hammett, quarterback in 1942, will
! coach the quarterback candidates
while Ed Stamm, Stanford stalwart
at tackle for three years, will han
dle prospective tackles. Pete Kmet
ovic, speedster who sparked the
Farm's undefeated 1940 squad to a
Rose Bowl victory, will instruct
halfbacks in the intricacies of the
T-formation's "man in motion."
Biggest Problem
Schwartz, who was head coach at
| Creighton College before coming to
i Stanford with Clark Shaughnessy
| in 1940, believes that his biggest
j problem will be devloping quarter
backs. So far he knows of only one
| experienced man, Frankie Forbes,
| who will be out today, though there
is one man, Harry "Red" Knight,
stationed at Stanford with the
Navy, who Marchie hopes will live
up to the quarterback reputation
he acquired in Texas.
j With Fred Boensch and Jim Cox,
| giant tackles who played on Stan
j ford's first string in 1942, as the nu
cleus for his line, Marchie expects
i to field a forward wall that will
j match any in the conference.
Plenty of Time
i The coming six weeks of spring
training, Marchie feels, will give
time to see what kind of a ball club
can be produced for Stanford's first
normal schedule in four years.
Under any circumstances, one
! thing is sure. The weeds that have
1 flourished in and around the Farm's
90.000-seat stadium will soon be
j trampled by the shoes of thousands
of people. Next Sept. 28 a football
j game is scheduled with Idaho. And
j Stanford will be there.
