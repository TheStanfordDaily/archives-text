gigantic Japanese underground or
ganization operating in the home is
land and Korea, it was revealed here
today.
Meanwhile, Allied authorities said
an investigation would he; made to
ascertain why the Japanese govern
ment had not listed these assets as
required by directives issued by
Gen. Mac Arthur.
Lieut. E. V. Nielsen, of the 32nd
Military Government Company, who
located the treasured which had been
hidden for future use in building a
"greater Japan," said the finding of
the first cache may be only the start.
He said investigations were being
rushed in an effort to find the men
icsponsible for dumping the valuable
bars in the bay and who arc be
lieved to be part of a vast secret, or
ganization.
Results expected shortly
Neilsen said he expected his inves

in two or three days. He said one of
the results may be the discovery that
the men who dumped the bars in the
ocean were connected with the weal

ness—who is being held in secrecy
to prevent any attempts against his
life. The witness is one of the labor

the two billion dollar fortune into
Tokyo Bay.
