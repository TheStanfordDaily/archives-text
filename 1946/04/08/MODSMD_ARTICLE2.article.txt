# Students Serenade Farm President
## 
### 
By the light of a sliver moon, one '
hundred Stanfordites marched the ,
circuitous route last night at 8 p.m. !
to serenade "Uncle Don"â€”President
Donald B. Tresidder, on his birthday, i
Just which birthday it was, he didn't j
reveal to the crowd of students who j
emerged from the darkness to sing ;
"You're a Jolly Good Fellow" and
"Happy Birthday, Uncle Don."
Guests at the Tresiddcr's birthday
supper were surprised when an al- j
most endless stream of Stanfordites j
streamed into the house. They had
been invited in by the butler, but j
left orderly when it became apparent j
the residency was only large enough \
for part of the crowd.
Outside on the porch, Stanford's
president pleaded against making a ;
speech, claiming "it's my birthday
and no time for a speech." He lis
tened solemnly as the impromptu
chorus sang Stanford battle songs
and hymns.
With "happy birthday Uncle Don" j
as parting words, the chorus con
gratulated President Tresidder.
Guyla Runyon led the singing.
