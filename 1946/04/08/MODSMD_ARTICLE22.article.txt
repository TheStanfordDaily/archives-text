## 
### 
NEW YORK, April 7 (UP).—Russian chief delegate Andrei A.
Gromylco has delivered to the UN Security Council a letter de
nouncing it3 decision in the Iranian crisis and demanding imme
diate removal of the Iranian question from its program, Russia
; announced tonight.
The letter, which Russia said was delivered Saturday night,

► confronted the Security Council
with the threat of a grave new dis
pute because its acceptance would be
an implicit admission that Russia
had been right, and the council
wrong, in the entire situation which
caused Gromyko's boycott of Iranian
discussions.
Gromyko charged:
i 1. —The council decision of Thurs
day, shelving the Iranian case and
asking both countries to confirm on
May 6 that Russian troops had been
; withdrawn by that deadline, was
j "incorrect and illegal, being contrary
, to the charter of the UN."
2.—Russia informed the council

An analysis of the Russo-
Iranian situation will be found
on Page 2 today.

I March 26, when Iranian discussions
started, (hat Russia was withdrawing
troops from Iran by agreement and
1 that hence there was no basis for
I discussion.
'•).—The council insisted on con
tinuing discussion. Russia and Iran
then formally announced an agree
; ment. Russia was thus shown to be
correct and its was proved that the
council's action in putting Iran on
i the program was "entirely without
! foundation."
4. —It is obvious that, in view of
! Russian statements, there never was
| any threat to international peace and
security in the Iranian question and
hence there is no ground for further
I discussion.
