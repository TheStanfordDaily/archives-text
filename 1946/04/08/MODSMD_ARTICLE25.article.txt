# Housing—A Plea for Action
## 
### 
Just what is the story on housing?
Without doubt housing is the worry that is
fin t on the minds of a lot of us, and when
you hear it expressed repeatedly you realise
just how important and bitter an issue it has
become.
It's uncle;standable that in a nationwide
rhor age of housing facilities, an area such as
a University campus would be hit even
harder than most sections. Losing sight of
thai fact is possible, when we start to investi
gate nd to get honestly concerned over the
situation right here at Stanford. But keeping
it in mind, let's review the facts:
First of all, the Administration has been
frank to admit the problem and to inform
students of attempts to solve it. We have
known in advance of such unlucky efforts as
those to obtain the Tanforan Quonset huts.
Certainly there has been a lot of discussion
t ; me spent; and ceriainly students haven't
been the only ones who have acquired extra
gray hairs wondering how Stanford could
po ;sibly accommodate the great jump in its
population, or- more specifically in the stu
dents' case —wondering whether or not they
would find a place to live so that they could
all nd school at all.

But up to date, outside of tentative plans
which may or may not go through concern
ing Dibble General Hospital, there have
been no concrete results. Although it's risky
to generalize, we feel that we are expressing
the thoughts of the majority of students with
whom we have come in contact, by asking
that the whole problem be reconsidered in
the light of how urgently students have come
to feel about it. "Something is better than
nothing," seems to be the sincere opinion of
many who have been • hit hardest by the
shortage.
Failure to find a way to at least partially
relieve the situation would have farther
reaching effects than just temporary setbacks
for the persons most directly concerned. We
think it would be a reflection on the Univer
sity that could not be ignored.
That's why, after considering as best we
can the difficulties involved, we urge a re
newed and much more vigorous effort to pro
vide a solution. That's why we are convinced
that it is not only in the best interests of stu
dents today, but of Stanford's reputation of
tomorrow that action with positive result is
taken as soon as possible.
