# Tryouts for the Daily
## 
### 
Anyone walking down Quad, or trying to
gei. a seat in an Econ class, or standing in
lino at the Cellar, can see that "It Ain't the
Same Ola Farm"—from what it v/as one or
two years ago, and it's our guess that a great
many campus institutions will have to hustle
to keep pace with 4,800 students and a new
"ratio."
The Daily is no exception, and the ma
chinery which has been set up to insure
campus-wide news coverage, the Daily try
oulej period, will start rolling today at 4 in
the Journalism Building. Stanford men and

women interested in working on the Edito
rial Staff are asked to attend. Appointments
will be made at the end of the two-week
period.
The Daily is in a privileged and impor
tant position in campus affairs. Free from
censorship or pressures which restrict out
side papers, it can be, through reporting of
campus news and presentation of opinion
on local and world subjects, a cohesive and
constructive force. With a large and repre
sentative staff, the Daily can carry out this
purpose.—H.D.
