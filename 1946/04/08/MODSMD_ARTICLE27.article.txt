Open letter to the Stanford University Adminis
tration:
Gent lemen:
In regard to the housing situation for married
V t; : ;ms. Not only have you failed to get results,
but you have passed up chance after chance to get
them.
Every worthwhile University in the country (in
c: iding many non-state schools which are also
fi.ced with the same endowment problems that you
< i.nfilain of) has moved heaven and earth and has
1 iduced. You continue to smile and be personable
: m;I hold "spirited question periods" that do nothing
but hide your failure.
Washington assigned 100 housing units to the
University. FREE. It was said that the University
could not accept them because ihey did not have
the $500 needed to install each house. That is an
asiiiine excuse. Men, paying no more than they
< ilher pay in Palo Alto, or would pay if they could
;»«l a house would jump at the chance to take
these units. Their rent would pay oft' the instal
lation charges long before the large group of mar
ried veterans finish school.
You say that the "original charter" doesn't allow
students to build houses on University property.
Nonsense; The original plans said that the Univer
sity could only invest in certain types of securities.

You wanted to invest in other types that changing
times had made a better investment. You went to
court. You were able to get Judge James (1936) to
change that. You let in more than 500 women.
You shift and answer queries like a bunch of
British diplomats. Talking much but answering
nothing. The "no water at lnterdale, rumors of
Dibble. Navy keeps Tanforan . . excuses are not
tilings that a man can live in.
Who are the Supermen of the nation's other
schools who get houses for their students?
You want to keep yourselves strong and you
won't "waste" strength en these temporary cri
ses. You won't go out on a limb tor a housing
shortage that will disappear in n few years. You
argue that il is not advisable for an institution
like Stanford lo engage in a program of short
duration and small return. You hope to sweat out
the crisis by moving an inch when a mile is
needed.
You were protected for four years by men who
performed many actions that, were certainly not
advisable for them in the long run. Yet you refuse
to pay these men for protecting you.
Two years ago it was "nothing is too good for our
hoys." Well, we can't say you have gone back on
your word. "Nothing" is just what, you have deliv
ered.

Washington assigned 100 housing units to the

You say that the "original charter" doesn't allow
students to build houses on University property.
Nonsense; The original plans said that the Univer
sity could only invest in certain types of securities.

You wanted to invest in other types that changing
times had made a better investment. You went to
court. You were able to get Judge James (1936) to
change that. You let in more than 500 women.
You shift and answer queries like a bunch of
British diplomats. Talking much but answering
nothing. The "no water at lnterdale, rumors of
Dibble. Navy keeps Tanforan . . excuses are not
tilings that a man can live in.
Who are the Supermen of the nation's other
schools who get houses for their students?
You want to keep yourselves strong and you
won't "waste" strength en these temporary cri

shortage that will disappear in n few years. You
argue that il is not advisable for an institution
like Stanford lo engage in a program of short
duration and small return. You hope to sweat out
the crisis by moving an inch when a mile is
needed.
You were protected for four years by men who
performed many actions that, were certainly not
advisable for them in the long run. Yet you refuse
to pay these men for protecting you.
Two years ago it was "nothing is too good for our

your word. "Nothing" is just what, you have deliv
