# BULL SESSION
## 
### H.D. THOREAU 
Every columnist worthy of the name devotes his
first, effort to thanking his predecessor for the swell
: • ndofT, to mentioning what a swell column his
predecessor wrote, and to gushing on about how it
sure is swell to be able to sit down and talk to all
you swell people five days a week over your mush.
Many columns and several gray hairs later he is
not so happy to be able to speak to you so often,
but lie is happy to wish his successor all the best,
; nd to mention that his successor is probably the
best if not one of the best men he can think of to
lake over the job.
Since we neglec ted to follow this ritual in our in
augural last February, and since we'll probably be
o overwhelmed with emotion come June that we
won't be able to see the keys of the linotype ma
chine, it has been our plan to combine these two
{.■ems into one and run it sometimes during the vol
ume when everything else was pretty stale.
That time is upon us. So here it is:
Well, Stan, thanks a million. Wo sure enjoyed
reading you last quarter, and were very flattered
by "them kind words" (hah hah) about us in your
final piece.

Following in your footsteps will be a big assign
ment, but we'll give it all we've got.
We are glad to have this opportunity to visit with
both of you readers (hah, hah), and we hope to give
you what you want to read—within limits of course
(hah, hah).
We are going to in the ensuing days tell you how
to run your life, explain to you the problems ot
this world, and give you something with which to
wipe spilled mush oft the table (hah, hah).
Anyway, it's going to be fun. Here we go!
That time has finally come. Yes, this is our "30 '
column. Before going further we might say a few
words about the origin of the term "30' which is
used by us journalists (hah, hah) when we want to
end it all (hah, hah).
In the old days when a telegrapher finished send
ing a dispatch, he would tup out "30" which in
Morse code means "time out for a beer backwards.
But. seriously, kids, it's really been swell writing
this column for you all. The old typewriter and
ourselves have really enjoyed it.
Following us in this space will be Paul Bearer.
Paul is a great guy and a simply wonderful writer,
and we know you'll all like him.
Take it away, Paul!
