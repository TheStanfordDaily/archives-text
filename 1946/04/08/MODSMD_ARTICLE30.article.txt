## Iran: Oil, Water, and Russia 
### RALPH HOVIS 
Presumably because of the "situ
ation in Iran" the Shisk Kebab has
been selling at a faster pace than
usual at Omar Khayyam's, the
Stanford Main Libe has been ad
vertising Persian art and poetry,
City of Paris has been selling a lot
of Persian rugs, and Stanford wom
en have been caught talking more
frequently with some of our distin
guished Iranian students. One in
particular is a daughter of a petro
leum technologist for Standard Oil.
We might do well to look at the
more serious facts of the Iranian
problem. It would seem that Iran
has been made a symbol of certain
principles and interests involving
the three great powers. The ele
ments of this problem might include
the pol'tical position of Iran as a
"friendiy government" to Russia,
the economic attraction of its oil
concessions to the three big powers,
(he geographical position it occu
pies both as a West-to-East corri
dor for Britain and North-to-South
passage for Russia to the Persian
Gulf, and finally, the signature of
Russia to the 1942 treaty between
Britain, Iran, and Russia. The trea
ty called for evacuation of troops
of the occupants by March 2, 1946,
The violation of this treaty by Rus
sia brought the issue to the Secu
rity Council agenda two weeks ago.
Russia Feels Circled
liy (iuoilaiistie States
Let us look at the interests of
the big powers concerned in the
dispute. Russia claims that "she
entertains no imperialistic ambi
tions of expansion." Russia consid
ers herself "encircled by a war
breeding monopoly capitalism." She
desires to "safeguard herself by
trying to establish in her neighbor
ing countries governments which
will be loyal to Russia."
Narrowed down to the Middle
East, trade rivalry problems be
tween Britain and Russia have been
a constant source of embarrassment
through the years for the small
countries of the Middle East areas.
In regard to Iran, one of the roots
of the dispute seems to be the con
test for economic supremacy there.
Another may be the Russian desire
for political dominance so that they
may secure a road south to the
Persian Gulf. Radio Moscow has
accused the Iranian government of
being reactionary and conspiring to
cause trouble between Russia and
other great powers for their own
ends. Russia asserts that this has
been done by negotiation with
American and British oil companies
for concessions and the refusal of
the same to Russia.
Russia Wants Friends
—One Way or Another
On the other side of the issue,
Britain replies that nothing is "con
trary to the United Nations Char
ter in the Soviet desire for safe
guarding itself by establishing in its
neighboring countries the govern
ments which will be loyal to the
USSR." But Britain goes on to ask,
"Can Russia's neighbors have a loy
al feeling toward the USSR when
their governments are imposed by
force, maintained by police tyran
ny, and used to deny basic civil
,'reedom?"
Iran has suggested—and it seems
to be in process now—that she
would be willing to negotiate oil
concessions provided that Russian
troops leave her soil. Britain has
agreed to the suggestion to give
Russia oil concessions provided that
they are equal to those given to the
other nations. The United States
has been ready to negotiate con
cretely with Russia over many more
objectives than Iranian oil—includ
ing Soviet access to the North Sea
via the Kiel Canal, and interna
tionalization of the Dardanelles —
but we have not been ready to ne
gotiate over the sovereignty of the
United Nations members.
Russia's pattern of diplomacy ef
fected since the end of World War
II should be recognized because it
seems to be a continuation of the
pattern relied upon under Czarist
Russia. Actions of Russia continue
to suggest that the Kremlin men
tality doubts its chances of obtain
ing its purposes through negotia
tions, and therefore appears to be
lieve that it can get farther by sur
prise moves involving the technique
of the "accomplished fact." This
technique seems to have been ap
plied to Iran and it was made all
the worse because Western minds
were left guessing all over the place
as to the limits of Russian purposes.
Old Habits Motivate
Present Russian Acts
Behind this technique we can find
that Russia has behaved this way
back to the time of the Napoleonic
period. There had been pressure on
Scandinavia, Poland, and the Bal
kans. Russian agents had been in
India ,and Russia had clashed with
Britain in Persia. In a way, then,
the present policy may follow from
habit.
The Stalinist regime became na
tionalist icj and attempted to recap
ture for "Mother Russia" the bulk
of the territories lost in the humil
iating treaty of Brest-Litovsk. This
has been the case with sections of
Poland, the Baltic states, and the
Balkans. We have, then, a recap
ture motive with the habit policy.
The next motive derives from
devastation of so much of old Rus
sia during World War 11. Russia is
lesperately in need of goods and

resources. Stalinist Russia has
merely looted its border countries
out of a need which neither we nor
Britain have experienced. This mo
tive leads to the last one, that of
achievement of real internal pros
perity. That requires a long period
of austerity at home. But such a
condition is never popular in any
country, even in self - disciplined
Britain. So the Kremlin has em
ployed the classic device called
"foreign menace" to justify external
policy. That, of course, requires
doing as well as saying. The old
reason of habit, the recapture pol
icy, the methods of loot, and the
use of the slogan for home con
sumption are quite enough to ex
plain why Russian diplomacy has
been pursuing a course at odds with
Western ideas.
Bear Treads Thin Ice
—Kill Doesn't Slij>
The question remains whether a
long - range aggressive purpose
should be added to the list. Only
those in Moscow could answer that.
What we do know is that the only

firm and formalized Russian policy
is that of "charging all that the
traffic will bear." The Kremlin
takes what it can get wherever the
picking is easy, but retains enough
flexibility to pull back whenever it
encounters firm opposition such as
that illustrated by the stand of the
U.N. last week, in allowing Iran to
be heard at a time when Russia did
not want it to be heard.
U.S. Hands Fate
To Security Council
This seems to be the concept be
hind the Byrnes-Truman approach
to Russia. Our cards seem to be in
the basket of the U.N. and future
issues will certainly be brought to
the Security Council, especially
those of small nations. Immediately
ahead lie the Dardanelles issue, the
elections in Greece, the peace trea
ties, the status of Trieste, and the
Albanian question. Certainly these
will be additional tests in which the
diplomacies of Russia and the U.N.
will come face to face.
