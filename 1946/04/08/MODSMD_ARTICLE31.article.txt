WASHINGTON. April 7 (UP).—
j The National Labor Relations Board
| tonight announced that it has
j granted bargaining rights to super
j visory employees in labor union
auxiliaries.
The announcement came as the
j pattern of a nationwide drive for
i unionization of foremen began to
| emerge from petitions filed with the
I NLRB by American Federation of
| Labor, Congress of Industrial Or
-1 ganizations, and independent un
| ions.
By another 2-1 vote, the NLRB
! ordered a collective bargaining
; election at California Packing Cor
; poration, Yakima, Wash., for super
i visory employees in the Fruit and
i Vegetable Packers and Warehouse
* men's Union, which is an auxiliary
I of the local Teamsters' Union
! (AFL).
The board said it had decidcd in

the Packard Motor Car Company
and Jones &. Laughlyin Steel Cor
poration cases that foremen may
unionize in independent or rank
and-file labor organizations.
"By the same reasoning, the
board cannot refuse 1o entertain a
petition filed by a supervicory aux
iliary of the local union which rep
resents the company's non-super
visory employees, the situation in
the prosent case," the board ruled.
It said "there is no merit" in the
company argument that the union
is not a labor organization within
the meaning of the Labor Relations
Act because it is an auxiliary of a
rank and file union. "The union is
clearly a labor organization" within
the definition of the act, it added.
