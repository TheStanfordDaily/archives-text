# Campus Links Play to Start
## 
### 
The All-University golf cham
pionships open today with the qual
ifying rounds.
These will be played twice a
week to narrow the field of entrants
down to 16 so that match play may
begin for the championship. All
members of the varsity golf team are
entered, and the tournament is ex
acted to bring to the front those
who will star for Stanford in the
coming golf season which opens on
April 20 with San Jose State.
The varsity men have been turn
ing in weekly scores to determine
which members will represent
Stanford on its six-man team. Four
men, according to Coach Eddie
Twiggs, appear certain to- have
cinched spots on the varsity entry
against San Jose State. These are
Tom Lambie, Frank McCann, Bob
Cardinal, and Jack Schuler.
Performances are not up to the
pre-war teams which took four na
tional championships in seven years,
but Coach Twiggs is confident that
his team will beat any Pacific Coast
opposition. The San Jose State
match will be the first test of Stan
ford strength.
Of the non-varsity men entered
in the All-University tournament,
George Traphagen seems the most
promising. Coach Twiggs is im
pressed with his record to date, but
is making no bets a.s to who will
wind up on top.
