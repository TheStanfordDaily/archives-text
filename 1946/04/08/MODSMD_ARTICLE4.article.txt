## Doctor Millard, Hack From Japan, Reports 
### JAMES JOSEPH 
Back at Stanford alter a month in
Japan under State Department aus
pices, Professor Ernest R. Hilgard,
head of the Psychology Depart
ment, declares that "if Japan can
weather her almost overwhelming
economic difficulties," he sees "no
phychological hazards to democratic
education in Japan."
Dr. Hilgard was one of 27 lead
ing educators invited by General
Mac Arthur through the State De
partment to visit Japan and make
recommendations for the post
emergency education of the Japa
nese people. The committee's full
rport, handed the general before
they boarded planes Monday for
the United States, is expected to be
released soon. The psychology pro
fessor states no startling criticisms
were made in the report.
Approve Army Education System
The visiting educators thought
that the Japanese were co-operat
ing fully with the United tSates.
Humiliated as are the Japanese, Dr.
Hilgard found no signs of resent
ment toward U.S. military or civil
authorities.
In explaining their mission to Ja
pan, the psychologist revealed ap
proval of the present emergency
educational program as conducted
by the Army's Civilian Informa
tion and Education section. The
committee's job was to map long
range, pcace educational formulas
to go into effect after the present
emergency.
Japanese Itave Good Teachers
Japanese educators, their inter
preters, and the visiting American
committee sat down to conferences
in Tokyo. Most of the schools vis
ited were in the Tokyo area.
Dr. Hilgard says the Japanese
have "good teachers and are im
proving their teacher education."
He adds ihat. "some of the Japanese
schools are very progressive."
Emphasizing their long - range
"education - toward - democracy"
plan, the psychologist says that
American authorities have now de
leted all parts of school tcxt,s deal
ing with "morals" or Stain Shinto
ism. Japanese educators with dem
ocratic leanings arc being picked by
American administrators for lead
ing parts in the Japanese school
system. These activities, points out
Dr. Hilgard, arc the emergency
parts of the educational program.
Dr. Hilgard was one of two Cali
fornia members of the group; the
other was Dr. Frank N. Freeman,
University of California.
