# SFU Topples Card Nine 12-6
## 
### STU MILLAR 
Taking their tool in two big in
nings, the USF Dons defeated a
hard-hitting but loose-fielding Stan
ford nine by a score of 12-6 on the
Sunken Diamond last Saturday.
The visitors hatted completely
around in the second and sixth in
nings to produce five- and seven
run rallies. Aside from these two
outbursts. Stanford's hurlers set
the Dons down without a run and
limited them to two hits.
Phil Wolf opened for the Farm and
showed his usual effectiveness, fan
ning one as he got by the Dons in
order in the first inning. His team
mates came back to give him what
proved to be a short-lived two-run
advantage on Howard's double,
Sloat's safe drag bunt, an infield out
and Frank McGraw's line single to
center.
But four hits, three of which
were of the cheap variety, an error
and three walks gave the Dons a
convincing three-run margin. The
Cards, however, kept hacking in the
last half of the frame to come up
with another tally on an error, free
pass, and Sloat's double.
Palisoul went to the mound for
the Cards in the third and distin
guished himself by retiring the
side on three straight strikeouts.
Play continued scorclessly until
the sixth when Palisoul grew wild
and the Dons teed off. Three
walks, an error by the shortstop,
two bingles, three stolen bases, and
a triple by Gran it z with the bases
loaded, who then stole home ac
counted for seven tallies and
clinched the game for the San
Franciscans.
The Indians retaliated with a lone
run in the sixth and another pair in
the seventh but they meant little to
the final outcome. Coach Harry Wol
ter started a slightly altered lineup
with Naviran on first, Winterhalter
at short, and Merriman in right field.
01 the three, Merriman proved the
most promising, for, in addition to
fielding nicely in the right pasture
and later at the initial sack, he poled
a tremendous four-base blast to
deep left center with Ahlquist on
first to produce the two Stanford
tallies in the seventh.
Also heartening to the Stanford
cause was the performance of
Larry Wolfe, who pitched the last
two innings for the locals. He
didn't allow a ball out of the in
field in his hitless effort. Coach
Wolter will count heavily upon
him in the coming league contests.
Short stops: Frank "Penguin" Mc-
Graw. Stanford s backstop, threw his
hip out in the third and might be
lost for the Santa Clara tilt this
Wednesday. . . . S.F.U.'s third base
coach practically drowned out the
stands singlehandedly. . . . Merriman
almost beat Dick Ahlquist to the
plate when he hit his homer. . . .
Shramka of the Dons showed a great
arm when he robbed Gahrelson of
extra bases on his long drive to right
center. . . .Bob Peters, most injured
man on the Stanford nine, did it
again yesterday. He came up with
another limp in the eighth, but Con
nie Jarvis allowed the gritty second
sacker and shortstop to remain in
the game. . . . Kellenberger's nice
slide on a force out at second in the
fifth messed up a sure double play.

SCORE BY INNINGS:
Stanford 210 001 200— (i 10 5
U.S.F 050 007 000—12 9 2
Taking their tool in two big in
nings, the USF Dons defeated a
hard-hitting but loose-fielding Stan
ford nine by a score of 12-6 on the
Sunken Diamond last Saturday.
The visitors hatted completely
around in the second and sixth in
nings to produce five- and seven
run rallies. Aside from these two
outbursts. Stanford's hurlers set
the Dons down without a run and
limited them to two hits.
Phil Wolf opened for the Farm and
showed his usual effectiveness, fan
ning one as he got by the Dons in
order in the first inning. His team
mates came back to give him what
proved to be a short-lived two-run
advantage on Howard's double,
Sloat's safe drag bunt, an infield out
and Frank McGraw's line single to
center.
But four hits, three of which
were of the cheap variety, an error
and three walks gave the Dons a
convincing three-run margin. The
Cards, however, kept hacking in the
last half of the frame to come up
with another tally on an error, free
pass, and Sloat's double.
Palisoul went to the mound for
the Cards in the third and distin
guished himself by retiring the
side on three straight strikeouts.
Play continued scorclessly until
the sixth when Palisoul grew wild
and the Dons teed off. Three
walks, an error by the shortstop,
two bingles, three stolen bases, and
a triple by Gran it z with the bases
loaded, who then stole home ac
counted for seven tallies and
clinched the game for the San
Franciscans.
The Indians retaliated with a lone
run in the sixth and another pair in
the seventh but they meant little to
the final outcome. Coach Harry Wol
ter started a slightly altered lineup
with Naviran on first, Winterhalter
at short, and Merriman in right field.
01 the three, Merriman proved the
most promising, for, in addition to
fielding nicely in the right pasture
and later at the initial sack, he poled
a tremendous four-base blast to
deep left center with Ahlquist on
first to produce the two Stanford
tallies in the seventh.
Also heartening to the Stanford
cause was the performance of
Larry Wolfe, who pitched the last
two innings for the locals. He
didn't allow a ball out of the in
field in his hitless effort. Coach
Wolter will count heavily upon
him in the coming league contests.
Short stops: Frank "Penguin" Mc-
Graw. Stanford s backstop, threw his
hip out in the third and might be
lost for the Santa Clara tilt this
Wednesday. . . . S.F.U.'s third base
coach practically drowned out the
stands singlehandedly. . . . Merriman
almost beat Dick Ahlquist to the
plate when he hit his homer. . . .
Shramka of the Dons showed a great
arm when he robbed Gahrelson of
extra bases on his long drive to right
center. . . .Bob Peters, most injured
man on the Stanford nine, did it
again yesterday. He came up with
another limp in the eighth, but Con
nie Jarvis allowed the gritty second
sacker and shortstop to remain in
the game. . . . Kellenberger's nice
slide on a force out at second in the
fifth messed up a sure double play.
