Marchie Schwartz and his host of assistants will catch their first
glimpse of the first post-war grid machine this afternoon when about 100
students don their football moleskins. No immediate predictions can be
made with any surety on gridiron success for next fall.
Some impressive names dot the list of sign-ups for football, but there
are still a good portion of outstanding Farm gridders in the armed serv
ices, and it is problematical whether they will lie released in time for
football next autumn. Don Zappetini. Buck Fawcett, and Bill Hachtcn
are just a few of the names that haven't returned to school yet.
Other conference schools have been going through spring practice
paces for about three weeks already. California, under new Coach Frank
Wickhorst, is mentoring about 110 prospective candidates for the Blue and
Gold eleven.
Jeff Cravath. at the U.S.C. plant, is handling about the same number
of men. Among returned stars are Mickey IVlcCardlc. Jim llardy, and
John Ferraro. plus a goodly portion from last season's Rose Bowl squad,
are also vying for top spots on the Trojan football team.
Bert Laßrucherie is conducting spring training at U.C.L.A. He has a
number of pre-war stars back, too. So you can see, it's pretty hard to line
up anything on football yet. All schools are carrying stars ol pre-war
status. More are to return, so all gridiron prognostications will have to
wait till next fall.

On the wetk-end sports ledger, Stanford wound up with a 50-50 aver
age. The tennis swatters whipped C.O.P. in Stockton, 5-4, on Saturday
afternoon, while at the Sunken Diamond the baseball squad took a 12-0
beating from the University of San Francisco.
In the tennis matches, Arnold Beisser showed up particularly well for
the Farm squad, and he is looked to as a stalwart on the team.

Bobbie Brown, former Stanford baseball star, who rcoei\ ed $35,000
for signing lip with the New York Yankees, is expected to he tanned
out to one of the Yank clubs for further seasoning.
Phil Rizutto, regular shortstop, is back from the war, and will probably
hold down the regular spot.
But apparently the club saw great prospects for Brown, or they
wouldn't have shelled out the fancy dough they did for him.
Coach Harry Wolters says that Brown is one of tin* finest players
that have ever performed for a Stanford nine, and looks to Brown mak
ing good in the big circuit.

The right field wall in the Sunken Diamond has seen a ball travel
over it onTy once. Kenny Washington, playing lor U.C.L.A.. performed the
feat of hitting a home run over that lence a tew years back.
