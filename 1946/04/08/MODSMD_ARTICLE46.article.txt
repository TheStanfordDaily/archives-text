In Friday's issue of The Daily, the
Sports Editor disagreed with an ar
ticle I had written in the previous Is
sue of The Daily dealing with sports
at Stanford.
In the original article I had ex
pressed the fears of students,
alumni, and Stanford fans that
possibly Stanford would have dif
ficulty becoming a major athletic
power again.
These fears were based on the as
sumption that with increased appli
cations for enrollment, the scholastic
requirements for entrance would
naturally be raised. If the require
ments were raised, and no leniency
showed to athletes, Stanford would
probably not be able to maintain a
big-time athletic program.
The Administration, as I reiter
ated in the previous article, is to
be commended for not turning
Stanford into a midwestem foot
ball college. USC in the soutli is
infamous for high-powered ath
letics. There's the old joke about
"all an athlete has to do to be able
to enter USC is to read his num
ber on his gym locker."
Stanford's administration deserves
praise for not lowering the standards
to this commercial extent, but it-is
a recognized fact that outstanding
athletes are not able to devote too
much time to studies. Instead they
are devoting extra time to athletics
for the good of the school. This
should be realized. Many colleges
make allowances for it. Let's hope
Stanford will not turn its back on
this and refuse to realize that good
football teams are made up of good
athletes.
Stanford will have to pull hard to
get back on top. There are few who
want to see football abolished at
Stanford. The Big Game. Pajama
rino, and rallies still should be part
of our college life.
Athletics are important in more
ways than many people realize.
The alumni is brought into con
tact with the University through
athletics. They are infinitely inter
ested in their alma mater's sports.
