# Stanford Music Council Plans Farm Spring Recital Series
## 
### 
As the latest move in providing a
full-time music program for the
campus, the Stanford Music Council
lias announced that a series of re
citals by Farm students has been or
ganized for this quarter. Including
vocal artists as well as instrumental -

ists, the details of the recitals will
be made known in the near future
through the pages of The Daily.
First organized at the beginning of
winter quarter, 1945, the Council
composed of representatives from
each major music group on campus,
drew up a constitution and thus be
came officially recognized by Excom.
Its purpose was then and is today to
act as a coordinating body of musical
activities which had previously been
carried on independently by such
groups as Cardinals and Ram's
Head.
As its first major project, the
young organization began the com
pilation of Stanford songs for inclu
sion in a songbook which "would be
of use to students and of value in
promoting that intangible, "school
spirit." Though faced by a confusing
copyright situation and publishing
difficulties, the Council nevertheless
persevered and the result was the
40-pagc booklet containing 22 songs
which appeared last fall, and was re
ceived by the student body with ap
probation—and purchases.
Since then the Council has en
gaged in such diverse activities as
providing a chorus for the alumni
luncheon held last quarter, making
pianos and practice rooms available
to those desiring their use, sponsor
ing symphony forums last quarter
and this, in conjunction with the
Bay Area Symphony Forum, whose
membership is made up of represen
tatives from colleges in the bay area.
