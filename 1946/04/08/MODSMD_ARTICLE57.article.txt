# World Government Needed for Peace
## 
### 
Harold C. Urcy, eminent atomic
scientist and Nobel prize winner,
told a crowd-packed San Francisco
auditorium Friday night that world
government must be achieved to
preserve world peace.
Scientific discoveries would have
made the world situation hazardous
even without atomic bombs. "The
atomic bomb is not the straw that
breaks the camel's back," "he con
tinued, "it is the last ton of straws."
After his address, Professor Urey
told Charlie Clark and Art Bur
man, members of the Student Com
mittee for World Federation, that
such a group as theirs could and
should exert influence in awaken
ing the people to the need for law
and government above the natural
states, as the only means to security
in an atomic age.
