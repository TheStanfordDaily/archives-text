THE BANDIT OF SIIERWOOI) FOREST—Now playing at the Stanford
Theater
Columbia's "The Bundit of Sherwood Forest" is easy on the eyes, but
an insult to anyone not still believing in fairy talcs. Purportedly a story
of Robin Hood's son, the film gives Cornel Wilde another chance to demon
strate why he's Hollywood's lop candidate for roles requiring a minimum

of acting and a maximum of good
looks.
Not being a history major, this

reviewer cannot
vouch for the
picture's histor
ical authentici
ty. But the cas
ual observer is
forced to admit
that it all sounds
a little absurd
when a domi
neering regent
can banish Eng
land's queen and

boy king and give instructions to
the lords as a schoolteacher does
to a class.
Wilde Is Wild
Even more ridiculous is the sin
gle-handed clean-up of this situa
tion by Cornel Wilde, who rides a
milk-white steed and looks like
Prince Valiant of the Hearst funny
papers. And when he open his
mouth Cornel sounds like the frus
trated male lead of a high school
olay.
Anita Louise, looking surprising
ly healthy, returns to the screen as
Wilde's lover. The rest of the cast
rattle their swords menacingly and
try to keep straight faces. We must
not forget the film's climax when
our hero and the regent engage in
a duel of the outcome of which
there isn't much doubt.
One Way to Love
The nightcap of the doublehead
er, "One Way to Love," concerns
the attempts of a pair of radio
scripters to write and sell a thriller
called "The Green Scorpion."
Possibly it's becaus of Willard
Parker and Chester Morris's con
tinual mugging about "Mother's
Home-made Pies"; maybe it's be
cause Hugh Herbert is an eccentric
millionaire who buys martinis just
to eat the olives; perhaps it's just
the general carefreeness of a whole
trainload of characters that stumble
into the wrong berths and do all the
other things you've never seen done
on a train. In any event, "One
Way to Love" is an ingenious little
film that should keep you happy.—
