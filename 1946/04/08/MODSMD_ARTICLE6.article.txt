# Economists Ask Added Price Control
## Inflation Predicted For Coming Year, 'Worse Than 1918' 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 7 (UP).—
President Truman's lop economic
advisors warned tonight that there
is danger of an "explosive inflation"
but predicted that it will pass by
the middle of J947 if Congress acts
promptly on legislation to keep
prices and rents in line.
In what amounted to an urgent,
last-minute plea for quick renewal
of price control authority, they as
serted that "the next few months
will be more dangerous and diffi
cult" than the runaway inflation
days following World War I.
Over in Year
But, they said, if the nation is
prepared 1o face "the critical
months in the same spirit in which
we faced the war cmcrgency and if
necessary legislation is passed, we
believe that the last major stum
bling block will be behind us."
The report was prepared by Eco
nomic Stabilizer Chester Bowles,
OPA Chief Paul Porter, Civilian
Production Administrator John D.
Small, Secrtary of Agriculture Clin
ton P. Anderson, and Wage Stabili
zation Board Director W. Willard
Wirtz.
'Hold the Line'
They reported to Mr. Truman on
the nation's economic health dur
ing the three years since the late
President Roosevelt first, issued his
"hold the line" order on April 8,
1943. They reported that, although
consumers' prices jumped 31 per
cent between August, 1939, and
February, 1946, only 3.4 per cent
of the increase occurred after the
order was issued.
They blasted "pressure" groups
who would do away with all or
most controls immediately and re
iterated again and again that Con
gress can delay no longer in adopt
ing President Truman's economic
"must" legislation.
