Well-thumbed copies of Black
wood, Culbertson, and Hoyle are
scattered around Lagunita rooms
today as bridge fiends shuffle decks
for the all-Court bridge tourna
ment starting this week. Jane De
ben is in charge of the tournament.
Lagunita's birthday dinner is
scheduled for Thursday
Guests were invited to an old-fash
ioned "dinner on the Farm" by in
vitations in the shape of a red barn.
Proper attire will be jeans and
plaid shirts or cotton dresses. In
charge of the affair will be Connie
Jones.
Also on Lagunita's schedule will
be an open house sponsored by
Casa Eucalypto Friday night, of
which Noelle Seitz is general chair
man.
Last week's activities included a
serenade for Miss Elizabeth Cran
dall, Lagunita's new director, Tues
day, an after-dinner collee for Miss
Crandall Wednesday, and an open
house sponsored by Casa Adelfa
Friday night.
