# New Poetry Series Brains Tomorrow
## 
### 
Margery Bailey, associate profes
sor of English, will begin this quar
ter's poetry series at 4:15 p.m. to
morrow in the recently redecorated
Briggs Room with readings of
translations from early Celtic po
ems.
The poems are translations from
collections made in old monasteries.
Some of the verses were written in
the margins of the translations by
the monks themselves. The poems
arc all untitled.
