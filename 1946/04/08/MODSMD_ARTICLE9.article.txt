Ta Bin (Steve) Chin, 8, was tired. •
For nearly six months he had walked with other Chinese refugees
who fled Japanese bombs in Kweilin. He had walked 1,000 miles seeking
peace.
And he found his goal at a U.S. Army airfield—the famous Flying
Tiger 23rd Fighter Group—with Cpl. Lewis Jew, a Stanford student of
Chinese descent who had been at the Farm in 1943 under the ASTP
program.
Today this same lad, healthy and well because of the kindness of
Cpl. Jew and his fellow soldiers, is living with his benefactor at his home
in Palo Alto.
When Cpl. Jew and buddies picked him up near their base at Loping,
he was dirty, wretched and emaciated from the hardships of his flight
from war. He was nothing more than a tiny beggar and he told his story
as he asked the men at the airfield for work so he could eat:
"Japanese fight Kweilin. I no stay Kweilin. I go Loping."
The servicemen liked his spirit and they took hiin in, fed him, and
clothed him. Soon he became the mascot of the outfit, flew six mis
sions with his friends and traveled approximately 10,000 miles with the
Flying Tigers by air, on foot, and in Army trucks.
He knew something of America from his school books. He saw

movies at the airfield. The men there told him about their country and
he wanted to go back with them.
When (he Tigers sailed for the U.S., Steve mysteriously appeared
on board ship, the first stowaway to hoard a troopship headed for the
Promised Land.
When the ship docked at Tacoma in the first week of January, Steve
was placed in detention home by immigration authorities. Cpl. Jew
waived his discharge rights to stay and guide his "adopted" son through
the red tape that barred his entry into the country so he could take him
home.
After sweating out two and a half months of wondering whether he
would be allowed to keep Chin, Cpl. Jew was given charge of the boy.
He has enrolled him at Addison School and is working toward legal
adoption.
Technically Chin is the ward of Mr. Der-Shing Liang, Chinese vice
consul in Seattle, who may withdraw him from the custody of the Jew

j family and return him to China
j if he is recalled to his home coun
! try.
| Immigration officials are now
! investigating to determine whe
ther the boy's parents were actu
ally killed. If this is so, Cpl. Jew,
now just plain Lewis, if you
please, may be able to legalize
his residence in the U.S. outside
the Chinese quota for 1946.
Lewis and his little friend are
: often on the campus. Of Stan
ford, the 8-year-old says, "Ting
hao," which in Chinese means ex
cellent.

J on his English. He practices by
means of a home recorder, listen
j ing to himself pronounce words
j in English and comparing them
i to t.he manner in which they are
j spoken on records made by mem

Steve is usually attired in his
