LONDON. April 8 (UP).â€”One of
the greatest problems in world his
tory officially came under the Uni
ted Nations' wing today, as the
U.N.'s special committee on refu
gees and displaced persons opened
a five-week session in Westminster
Churchhouse.
Sir George Rendel of the British
Foreign Office appealed to repre
sentatives of 20 nations, including
the United States and the Soviet
Union, to tacklc the refugee prob
lem "practically, quickly, and fi
nally."
Rendel said the only hope for
people who have been too uprooted
to return to their home countries
was to resettle them, and he urged
formation of an international body
for the job.
