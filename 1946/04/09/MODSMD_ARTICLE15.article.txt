# Byrnes Will Fight Russian Demand; Reds, Iran Map Economic Terms
## 
### 
NEW YORK, April 8 (UP). —A new, direct clash between the
United States and Russia was threatened imminently tonight
when Secretary of State James F. Byrnes indicated that he defi
nitely opposed a Russian demand that the United Nations Se
curity Council take the Iranian question off its program.

J.
Can't Drop Iran Dispute
Council delegates were working
out their policy toward Russia's de
mand which if accepted would be a
confession that the council violated
the U.N. charter by merely discuss
ing Iran—when Byrnes said in
Washington that this country stood
pat on its position.
This position is that the council
cannot drop the Iranian dispute un
til both Russia and Iran have sub
mitted reports to the council May f>
whether Red Army troops have com
pletely evacuated Iran.
Discuss Threat of Big Three Crisis
Preparing for a formal meeting at
3 p.m. tomorrow delegates discussed
the Russian blast in secret hotel
X'ocn conferences.
Copies of the letter in which Rus
sian Chief Delegate Andrei A. Gro
myko demanded that the Iran ques
tion be dropped were circulated to
delegates today, some 18 hours after
Moscow radio broadcast it.
Gromyko Letter
The official text, issued by the U.N.
secretariat, showed only minor dif
ferences in phrasing from the ver
sion broadcast by Moscow.
A U.N. spokesman said the Presi
dent Quo Tai-Chi of the council and
U.N. Secretary General Trygve Lie
decided the letter was not urgent
and should take the normal course
unless Gromyko objected.
Normally such communications lie
on the council table three days be
fore they arc considered. Gromyko
might demand earlier consideration
on the grounds of urgency. Howev
er, his boycott on discussions of Iran
does not expire until Wednesday.
Paris Conference
Byrnes in Washington said that
Britain and Russia had accepted his
proposal for a meeting of the Big
Four foreign ministers in Paris, April
5, precedent to the Paris Peace Con
ference set for May 1.
Byrnes admitted that the Paris
Conference would probably be post
poned because Allied representatives
have failed to agree on treaty drafts.
Unwilling to Withdraw
But the confercnce will mean a
vitally important get-together of the
United States, British, Russian and
French foreign secretaries and they
will be able to discuss Iran and all
other questions.
American circles here said that the
United States and Britain are most
unwilling to withdraw from their
position on Iran. Byrnes has won a
victory of world importance for the
right of small nations to be heard
against great ones. If he knockled
down to Russia now, he might turn
victory into defeat and weaken the
prestige and authority of the council.

LONDON, April 8 (UP).—Moscow radio disclosed tonight that
Russia and Iran are about to conduct economic negotiations fol
lowing up the Iranian concessions of vast oil interests to the
Soviet Union.
The disclosure v/as made in a letter by Iranian Premier

Ahmad Ghavam Es-Sultaneh to
Russian Foreign Mininster Vinches -
lav Molotov.
It followed by a few hours a
broadcast, of an editorial in Pravda,
official newspaper organ of the Rus
sian Communist Party, heatedly at
tacking United Nations policy in the
Iranian dispute and seeking to jus
ti+'v Russia's own course.
"Complete Understanding"
Tne editorial as broadcast failed
completely to mention the fact that
the Red Army failed to leave Iran by
March 2 as promised by treaty.
unavam's letter to Molotov said
that Russo-Iranian negotiations re
sulted in complete mutual under
standing and that the "precious
achievement" opened "a new era of
mutual understanding."
Probable Negotiations
"I hope that as the result of writ
ten and oral conversations in Mos
cow and by the kind cooperation of
your excellency the economic rela
tions will be negotiated equally suc
cessfully to the advantage of both
countries. "
No hint of the nature of economic
negotiations was given but diplo
matic quarters here believed they
should include:
I.—A Russian bid to build rail
roads in Iran, especially for trans
portation of oil in the new conces
sion.
2.—Fishing rights in Iranian wa
ters of the Caspian Sea.
—The right to open hanks and
other financial institutions in Iran.
