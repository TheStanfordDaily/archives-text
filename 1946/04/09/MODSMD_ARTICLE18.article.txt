# Casa Olivo Wins Cup
## 
### 
Casa Olivo received the women's
scholarship cup yesterday at Wom
en's Conference when Dean Mary
Yost congratulated the women on
campus for rewarding work of real
merit and encouraging good schol
arship with the award.
Ventura was second on the list,
Roble third, and Jordan fourth.
Scholarship Situation
Dean Yost discussed the scholar
ship situation, saying that the 109
girls now on academic probation
are far too many since this only af
fects lower division. Beginning next
fall, however, the Scholarship Com
mittee has decided to extend aca
demic probation to upper division
students as well.
Many of these students on pro
bation, Dean Yost continued, have
been on for anywhere from five to
nine quarters. Some are on one
quarter, off the next, and back on
again. It is possible to have one
bad quarter accidentally, believes
Dean Yost, but a chronic proba
tionist cannot blame it on anyone or
anything else.
5,000 Applicants
When there are 5,000 applicants
for entrance into Stanford for next
year, and 400 applications coming
in during a week. Dean Yost thinks
it is time for the spring quarter
country club vogue to be deferred
to a serious attitude toward work.
It is not fair for so many prospec
tive students to be held out of col
lege for the benefit of students who
do not appreciate the advantages,
she thought.
The remaining houses in order of
their rating were: Naranja, Euca
lypto, Durand, Oaks, Hawthorne,
Russell, Union, Storey, Magnolia.
Klahoya, Granada, Adclfa, Roth,
Branncr, Guthrie, Cubbcrlcy, Hurl
burl, Lathrop, Mariposa, Madrono,
Elm, and Manzanita.
