### 
TOKYO, April 8 (UP).-Angry
representatives of Japan's Popular
Front political parties, led by Com
munist. chief Kyaichi Tokuda,
mauled Premier Kijuro Shidehara
today at the climax of a conference
in which left wing elements de
manded his resignation.
Cabinet secretaries rushed into
the pushing and shoving crowd,
surrounded Shidehara, and cased
him from the conference room
unharmed. It was the second
consecutive day of political vio
lence directed against Shidehara
and orc'MTcd almost on the eve
of Wednesday's historic free elec
tion.
Sunday, 20,000 left wing Japanese
and Korean demonstrators hurled
rocks at Shidehara's home and de
manded his resignation in the
sharpest show of political fervor
since the restoration of free speech
and assembly in Japan. The riot

was quelled only after the arrival of
armed American military police.
After the outbreak a 26-man
delegation, led by Tokuda, called
on the Premier to formally pre
sent a request for bis resignation.
Failing immediately to sec him,
today's meeting was arranged.
At the half-hour stormy confer
ence the left wing leaders ques
tioned Shidehara on the food short
age and the problems of farmers
and laborers. To the annoyance of
his questioners the Premier merely
listened and did not reply.
When the request for his resigna
tion was made Shidehara stood up
and started to leave the room.
"You cannot leave here," some
one shouted. "We're not through
yet." Members of the group
rushed the Premier and shoved
him around until cabinet secre
taries ran into the room and,
forming a human wedge, got him
away unhurt.
