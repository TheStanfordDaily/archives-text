"One of the greatest problems in world
history officially came under the United
Nations' wing today, as the UN's special
committee on refugees and displaced per
sons opened a five-week session in West
minster Churchhouse."—United Press dis
patch, April 8.
For the 75G,000 Jews in European D.P.
camps, most desolate of the dead-end roads
of tho world, the announcement that the
United Nations have actually begun work
on their problem holds hope. Strangers in
maiiy of the countries to which they returned
after the bitter years of war, Jewish D.P.'s
have found it difficult to make a living, and
even more difficult to erase the hatreds fos
tered by the Axis regime
Inevitably their thoughts have turned back
to as their patriarchal homeland. A
poll taken under UNRRA auspices—at the
request of the Anglo-American Committee of
Inquiry on Palestine resulted in more than

Thee thtory, PAGE 1 . . .

18,700 of 19,000 answering "Palestine," for
their first choice in emigration. Their con
viction is that nowhere in the world can they
find toleration and respect.
Pitiable and shameful as it is that the D.P.'s
fellow citizens have caused this attitude, the
only decent course that can be followed now
is to turn full and unselfish attention to
them.
If the only hope for these persons who
have been "too uprooted to return to their
home countries" is to resettle them, the UN
committee must act immediately to fulfill it;
before the D.P.'s become a people without a
future.
Despite Arah nationalism, the immense
problems of tiansportation and resettle
ment, and the self-interest of more secure
and powerful groups, the UN committee is
laced with a situation in which it will have
to consider first the plight of a desperate
people.
