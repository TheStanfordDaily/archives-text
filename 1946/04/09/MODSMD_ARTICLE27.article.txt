BOATHOUSE BLURS
T<> tin Editors:
Im reply to the slightly misinformed off-campus
oj ii.'on aired in the "Dippy" edition of April 5 we
led that both (he editor and the author of that bit
of Campus Opinion should have the straight word.
The tale of the meeting between the nurse ant!
cur "Bitf Burly Lifeguard" (5' 7", 150 lit.) has been
just a bit distorted. The guard did not say that
the nurse couldn't use the Boathouse facilities,
but only that she could not use a canoe, as the
nurses do not have any stored here.

This is surely not showing preference for those
living on campus, for a great number of the on
campus living groups do not own canoes and there
fore are not able to use any.
If the students of the School of' Nursing and Medi
cine in San Francisco wish to buy a canoe and store
it at the Boathouse, we shall be very happy to have
them paddle it around the Lake to their hearts'
content.
The "Big Burly" Boathouse Boys.
(Editorial note: Wo would he glad to negotiate a
truce!)
