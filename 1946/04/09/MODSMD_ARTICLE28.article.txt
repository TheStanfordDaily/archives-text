The Stanford Bookstore has placed the "Naval
Officer's Guide" on the "Sports and Hobbies" shelf,
sandwiched between "It's Fun to Make It Yourself"
and "Riddle-de-Quiz" by Helen Fisher, the Have
Some Fun Lady.

"Saratoga Trunk" which will be showing at the
local flicker palace soon was world premiered in
December of 1244 for the "troops" in Europe.
We saw it at the Paramount L'Opera in Rheims,
France, in the midst of the usual gay premiere
crowd. A large number of the men were attired in
* ::y olive drab, while their escorts wore smart olive
drab suits.
The special service officer forgot to get any extra
I'm < so the flleig lights weren't functioning, but
the crowd was well lit and didn't notice the differ
ence.

Two prominent San Francisco morning papers last
wet k enrolled Jim Pollard, Stanford's prewar bas
ketball all-American, in two more universities
around the country.

On Thursday he was going to Kansas State and
on Sunday he was headed for Oklahoma A.&M.
Both of these rumors were well-founded and came
from the usual authoritative sources.
There is still a large faction who will swear up
and down on a stack of check books that Long Jim
is still slated for the University of Southern Cali
fornia.
Readers, shove all that guff aside and hear this*.
If Mr. Pollard ever matriculates anywhere again it
will be at old L.S.J.U. Although he realizes that he
would have to do a couple of quarters' work before
becoming eligible here, he still wants to get his
degree from Stanford.

We have a communication from Miss ZaZa Hay
moncl of ihe Haymond Booking Agency, 450 Geary
street, S.F., telling us of all kinds of entertainment
goodies she can offer us.
Her orchestras feature "a commercial brand of
music â€”smart arrangements on the sweet side, with
jumpers in between."
She also has to offer "strolling trios (Hawaiian
and Spanish) snappy small combinations and girl
units."
If any of you boys are going to have a fireside in
the future and would like a strolling girl unit with
jumpers in between, don't forget ZaZa.
