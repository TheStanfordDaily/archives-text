### Hy BILL STEIF 
Hussein Ala, Iranian representative to the United
Na! ions Council, threw a big "victory" cocktail
party at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel the night before
last. The "victory" consisted of the Council's strong
: upport given to Iran last, week, during the queru
lous debate on the Iranian question.
Today, however, Ala finds his position not near
ly so powerful as it was a week ago, for all the
time the little man from the Middle East was ar
guing in last week's Council meeting that his
country could not negotiate with (he Soviet while
Russian troops remained in Iran, Iran was con
ducting negotiations.
This kind of double-dealing (v/e almost said Ori
< ntal double-dealing, which is a poor sort of name
tailing) has, we think, an enervating effect upon
the Council and upon our faith in the Council. It
wa;i up to Iran, we suspect, to refuse to negotiate
with the Soviet in this particular case. We certainly
aren't trying to whitewash Russia and we realize
that it was probably very hard to avoid dealing
with the Russians with thousands of Red troops in
Iran.
But we do think that when a man gets up in
the highest and, to us. most precious assembly in
(he world he should either speak the truth or not
speak at all. One thing, at least, we must say for
the Russians. They certainly do speak their
minds. As long as our boy, James Byrnes, con
tinues to do the same thing—and yesterday he
sounded off and indicated tha( he definitely op
posed a Soviet demand tha( (he Security Council
(ae (he Iranian problem off its program—we feel
that the Council can manage to secure our peace.
It's the snide, little dishonesties that worry us.

From Washington conies news that Carl Vinson,
chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee,
yesterday introduced a bill to suspend the dralt for
six months. During the six-month selective service
moratorium the Army and Navy would put on a
huge recruiting drive, the main lure being a real
hike in service pay.
The raise would set the base pay of a private at
$100 a month with graduated increases running all
the way up' the line. The smallest increase would
be a 30 per cent boost for Master Sergeants.
This came right on top of General Eisenhower's
warning that anti-conscription legislators were
"gambling" with national security.
One of (he more interesting sidelights of Vin
son's proposal is (hat the six months run from
May 15, the date the present draft law expires,
till November 15, shortly after the next congres
sional elections. That, so far as we can see, defi
nitely indicates that selective service has become
a political football.
General Eisenhower may be right about contin
uing the draft. We certainly were in no position
during our hitch with Uncle Sam to become an
authority on the problem.
More important at this moment, we think, would
be some kind of a full report on just what we can
and cannot do with the.atomic bomb, which (let's
face it) has the potentialities of several thousand
18-year-old rookies.
Yestciday a report came in to the effect that the
United States is spending over a million dollars a
day for the manufacture and improvement of atomic
bombs. Maybe we ought to draft physicists and
structural engineers rather than high school kids.
