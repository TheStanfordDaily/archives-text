# Communist Editorial Attacks Chiang Policy

### 
CHUNGKING. April 8 (UP).—
An editorial written by Communist
headquarters at Yenan and pub
lished here today attacked Gener
alissimo Chiang Kai-shek so vio
lently that some observers believed
it would end the truce between
government and Communist fac
tions.
The editorial said government ac
tions and Chiang's '"lust for slaugh
ter" have nullified cease-fire agree
ments.
Couched in what the Chinese
consider rude terms—and certainly
the most vitriolic phrases since the
Communist-Government truce last
January — the editorial appeared
April G in the Yenan Emancipation
Daily and was reprinted today by

j Communist papers throughout Chi
na'
I A Communist spokesman said to
night that the editorial was not de
i signed to rupture Communist-Gov
j ernment accords, but "to fix the
blame for recurrence of civil war
| where it belongs."
The editorial, commenting on
Chiang's recent speech before the
People's Political Council, said, "He
< tore up the Northeast (Manchuria)
cease-fire agreement by declaring
that large-scale civil war would
| reign throughout the country and
ihe tore up Political Consultative
i Council resolutions by his renewed
| declaration of a dictatorship, in con
j stitutional form, through the Na-
I tional Assembly."
