# Americans Cain Opportunities At Experimental English School
## 
### HELEN PINKERTON 
Shrivenham American University
in England was a unique experi
ment in American college history.
Designed to accommodate high
point Army men in Europe await
ing redeployment after V-E Day,
Shrivenham offered its 4,000 stu
dents an opportunity to pick up
the threads of civilian life in an at
mosphere of quiet yet stimulating
activity.
Good Attitude
Clifford Weigle, Stanford associ
ate professor of journalism, who
taught at Shrivenham for both of
its eight - week terms, found that
the students in general showed a
good attitude and more diligence
than the average American college
student.
Mr. Weigle, Douglas M. Wliita
ker, professor of biology, and Willis
Hugh Johnson, professor of biology,
were Stanford faculty members who
served on the Shrivenham faculty.
"The weeks at Shrivenham,"
Mr. Weigle said, "gave its stu
dents an advantage in returning
to college life when they were
discharged." They also could re
ceive credit in any American
university for work taken at the
temporary university.
In Heart of England
Located on a former British es
tate in the heart of literary England
18 miles from Oxford, Shrivenham
offered in addition to a curriculum
in liberal and fine arts, agriculture,
education, engineering, journalism,
science, and commerce, opportunity

to visit the famous historical and
| literary points in southern Eng
j land.
Shrivenham was intended to do
more than merely occupy the
time of the men waiting to go
home. No expense was spared by
the Army in making it comfor
table and convenient for its stu
dents and iti every way as similar
| as possible to an American cam
pus. The buildings were leased
from the English government and
! remodeled extensively.
Faculty Selection
The faculty of about 200 were se-
J lected from 80 American colleges
j and universities. The students
I were selected on a quota system
| from the Army in Europe.
In addition to carrying an aca-
J demie program of three daily
classes, the students at S.A.U.
| printed a weekly paper, the "Shri
! venham Post," ran a radio station,
| AFN-SAU, produced plays, and
had an active sports calendar.
News by "Post"
The "Post," which published 17
j issues under the supervision of the
j journalism section, covered all the
I campus events, the chief news in
! terest usually being who and how
j many students were leaving for
home. An eight-page well-illus
j trated paper, the "Post" gave its
I workers training in all phases of
newspaper production.
Much leisure time was used for
| sightseeing and getting to know
I the English countryside and its
! inhabitants. Those interested in

dramatics could either act in the j
plays pur on by the drama classes
or enjoy attending them, and the
| English-produced plays at nearby
Stratford and Oxford.
Dancing, Too
Dances were also part of student |
! recreation, but the ratio was dis- j
j cournging—one woman to a hun
dred men. About a quarter of the j
students were married.
Sports competition was offered
running from regular physical
training to team work in the
major sports. Baseball, football,
basketball, and boxing teams met
competition from English and Ca- j
nadiaii groups and Army divi- j
sums on the Continent.
Almost a Big Game
A "Big Game" spirit was aroused
for a football game with the other
American Army univeisity at Biar
i ritz, France, Mr. Weigle said, but
! somehow it failed to come off. Top !
players from American University '
j teams played on the SA.U. team as 1
Ion'? as they remained there.
In its final issue the "Post" said ;
that "No one denied SA.U. was a j
fine thing, but that the big trip i
west was even better."
Closed After V-J Day
After the Japanese surrender, j
when transportation facilities bo
| came available, Shrivenham was j
] closed in December 1945.
Released from his duties, Mr.
Weigle made a lecture tour of Eu
! rope, conferring with the staffs of
Army papers in the Seventh Army I
area. He resumed his position at J
Stanford this quarter.

Shrivenham was intended to do
more than merely occupy the
time of the men waiting to go
home. No expense was spared by
the Army in making it comfor
table and convenient for its stu

| as possible to an American cam
pus. The buildings were leased
from the English government and
! remodeled extensively.
Faculty Selection
The faculty of about 200 were se-
J lected from 80 American colleges
j and universities. The students
I were selected on a quota system
| from the Army in Europe.
In addition to carrying an aca-
J demie program of three daily
classes, the students at S.A.U.
| printed a weekly paper, the "Shri
! venham Post," ran a radio station,
| AFN-SAU, produced plays, and
had an active sports calendar.
News by "Post"
The "Post," which published 17
j issues under the supervision of the
j journalism section, covered all the
I campus events, the chief news in
! terest usually being who and how
j many students were leaving for
home. An eight-page well-illus
j trated paper, the "Post" gave its
I workers training in all phases of
newspaper production.
Much leisure time was used for
| sightseeing and getting to know
I the English countryside and its
! inhabitants. Those interested in

dramatics could either act in the j
plays pur on by the drama classes
or enjoy attending them, and the
| English-produced plays at nearby
Stratford and Oxford.
Dancing, Too
Dances were also part of student |
! recreation, but the ratio was dis- j
j cournging—one woman to a hun
dred men. About a quarter of the j
students were married.
Sports competition was offered
running from regular physical
training to team work in the
major sports. Baseball, football,
basketball, and boxing teams met
competition from English and Ca- j
nadiaii groups and Army divi- j
sums on the Continent.
Almost a Big Game
A "Big Game" spirit was aroused
for a football game with the other
American Army univeisity at Biar
i ritz, France, Mr. Weigle said, but
! somehow it failed to come off. Top !
players from American University '
j teams played on the SA.U. team as 1
Ion'? as they remained there.
In its final issue the "Post" said ;
that "No one denied SA.U. was a j
fine thing, but that the big trip i
west was even better."
Closed After V-J Day
After the Japanese surrender, j
when transportation facilities bo
| came available, Shrivenham was j
] closed in December 1945.
Released from his duties, Mr.
Weigle made a lecture tour of Eu

Army papers in the Seventh Army I
area. He resumed his position at J
Stanford this quarter.
Shrivenham American University
in England was a unique experi

dramatics could either act in the j
plays pur on by the drama classes
or enjoy attending them, and the
| English-produced plays at nearby
Stratford and Oxford.
Dancing, Too
Dances were also part of student |
! recreation, but the ratio was dis- j
j cournging—one woman to a hun
dred men. About a quarter of the j
students were married.
Sports competition was offered
running from regular physical
training to team work in the
major sports. Baseball, football,
basketball, and boxing teams met
competition from English and Ca- j
nadiaii groups and Army divi- j
sums on the Continent.
Almost a Big Game
A "Big Game" spirit was aroused
for a football game with the other
American Army univeisity at Biar
i ritz, France, Mr. Weigle said, but
! somehow it failed to come off. Top !
players from American University '
j teams played on the SA.U. team as 1
Ion'? as they remained there.
In its final issue the "Post" said ;
that "No one denied SA.U. was a j
fine thing, but that the big trip i
west was even better."
Closed After V-J Day
After the Japanese surrender, j
when transportation facilities bo
| came available, Shrivenham was j
] closed in December 1945.
Released from his duties, Mr.
Weigle made a lecture tour of Eu
! rope, conferring with the staffs of
Army papers in the Seventh Army I
area. He resumed his position at J
Stanford this quarter.
