### BETTY BARLOW 
At the left of the entrance to the
reference room in the main libe a
series of exhibits are being shown
describing the history of Stanford
and its founders, including photo
graphs and books on Ihe first foot
ball game between Stanford and
Cal.
The game was played on March
19, 185)2. on the old Street
grounds in San Francisco, and the
final score was Stanford 14, Cali
fornia 10.
If for no other reason, this first
game would be famous because of
(he amusing fact that when the
time came for the game to begin, it
was discovered that neither team
had remembered to take along a
football.
On exhibition is a book, "The
Games of California and Stanford,"
by Jack Shcehan, Stanford '95, and
Louis Honig, Cal '95, which was
published in 1900 and gives ac
counts of the Stanford-Cal football
games through the '90's.
Five-Car Special
For several weeks before the day
of the first game there was much
excitement on both campuses. The
Daily Palo Alto announced that "a
five-car special train would pull
light up in front of the Quad" on
the spur track laid to bring con

struction supplies to the University.
Roble girls made decorations of
flags and red bunting for the train,
and the "five-car special" made a
gay trip to San Francisco.
The first official student yell,
I adopted in January 1892 before the
; "big game," was:
Rah! Rah! Rah!
Rah! Rah! Rah!
Rah! Rah!
Stanford
First Farm Team
Then as now the Farm team
; worked under great handicaps.
It was surprising that the young
University even fielded a team
its first year. Stanford has been
receiving a lot of attention and
Cal was determined to take it
down some. The Cal team was
heavier, but Stanford men gave
out with plenty of "interference,"
which was then a new part of
football.
Also exhibited is a picture of the
red silk handkerchief that was
waved at the various Stanford stu
dent-body meetings when the Uni
versity first opened in the autumn
of 1891. When the selection of a
color was under discussion, gold
was finally adopted. In the spring
of '92. after the game had been
I scheduled for March, a special
| meeting was called and, with a
| small number of students in at
j tendance, the action was reversed
| and cardinal was adopted as the
official color.
Tins caused bitter feelings al the
I moment but later, when San Fran
cisco Sunday papers ran the
screaming headlines "Cardinal Tri
umphs O'er Gold and Blue," the
color controversy was settled for
ever.
