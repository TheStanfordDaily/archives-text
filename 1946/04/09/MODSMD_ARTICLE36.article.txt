# Cinderpath Meet Slated Saturday
## Coach Weiershauser Announces That Intramural Track Meets Start Today 
### 
The Stanford track season gets its
official sendoff this weekend when
the Indian scanty-clads play host to
a trio of junior colleges lumped to
gether as one team Saturday after
noon, but meeting tomorrow between
the intramural squads has a prior,
if somewhat unofficial precedence.
This afternoon at 4:15 at Angell
Field,, Coach Jack Weiershauser will
sign up all men from the frats, liv
ing groups, and dorm corridors who
are interested in competing in the
sprints and hurdles.
In the event that more than six
men sign for either the 100 or 200,
or high and low hurdles, preliminary
heats will be held, the cinder path
being incapable of supporting more
than that number in a straight run.
All men reporting this afternoon are
asked to bring their running clothes
in the event heats are to be held.
Finals on Wednesday
On Wednesday afternoon, the
finals of all events run, jumped or
thrown in regular collegiate meets
will be run off. Only exceptions are
that the two-mile run has been elim
inated, and the mile relay cut down
to a less exhausting 880 (4 men run
ning 220 yards apiece).
Four places will be awarded in all
events, counting five-three-two-one,
which means that just about every
body will have some opportunity to

| score and thereby add a bit of glory
j to their hall, frat, or corridor.
Varsity men will be allowed to
j participate in the meet, with one
| stipulation. Any man previously
winning a varsity letter, at this or
â–  any other school, will not be permit
fited to enter. Only men affected by
the ruling are Ed Luce, Martin Ad
{ derson and Bill Larson.
Optimism for Saturday
Concerning the dual meet this
weekend, a bit of optimism seems
1 light in place about here, for if Men
lo,.San Mateo and SFJCs can do no
better than was done Saturday
| against Cal, the Big Red will start
off with a victory.
Not that the Indian squad men
tored by Jack Weiershauser is made
of Olympic team caliber, but avail
able talent is considerably better on
the Farm than at the three junior
colleges combined. Marin, Modesto,
an San Francisco J.C.'s did none
too well against the California Blue
and Gold last Saturday, with no per
formance being worthy of any men
tion.
That doesn't say much for the
Bears either. Brutus Hamilton, track
coach at Cal, has only an average
collection of track men on hand, and
none but the most inveterate Berke
leyite would be so rash as to claim
that Cal has more than just a so-so
crew of scanty-clads.
