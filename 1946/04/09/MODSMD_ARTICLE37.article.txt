Stanford's lone victors in sports
last weekend—the tennis team, face
; heavy schedule this week. On
Wednesday afternoon, Coach Bug
le's swatters take on the invading
Broncos from Santa Clara. The last
time we faced the Santa Clarans
was in a basketball game last quar
ter, in which the Farm went down
to inglorious defeat. The tennis
team is out to redeem the colors of
the Red and White.
Three days later, on Saturday, the
Naval Training Station team from
Treasure Island scoots down to the
Farm to play the local netters.
Stanford students are cordially
invfted to attend both matches.
Let's hope the attendance is better
than at the baseball game last Sat
urday.
Arnie Beisser was the surprise

j man in Saturday's matches in
| Stockton. A No. 1 man on the
! squad, he came up even better than
expected in his matches.

The Daily Trojan, which ema-
I nates from the Vermont Boule
! vard extension school often
called U.S.C., has gnawed even
deeper in its rat hole. The beef
this time from Slants is the sim
ply infantile article that appeared
in their paper on the first base
ball game with Tommy Troian.
Brushing aside all decenty, scribe
Rob Smith lambasted the Indians'
performance with downright in
j suiting remarks.
j Mr. Smith further shed tears be
! cause he felt that Stanford should
! n't be allowed to compete against
| such high-class teams as U.S.C.
Do?s Mr. Smith wish to suggest
that U.S.C. join the Pacific Coast
. Baseball League—thereby recqgniz
j ing their own pro stalus.

j Athletic managers are still need
-1 cd on the campus for varsity sports.
; The football post, one of the best
| jobs of all, is wide open. So are
j swimming, track, and baseball.
Men who take the positions be
come full members of the squad,
making all trips and earning l a
letter. Besides that, valuable
business experience is gained
from handling the accounts of the
| team when on the road.
In previous years, manager spots
have been keenly fought for. With
| Stanford on the reconversion track.
I these jobs are now open. Don't pass
j up a good opportunity.

Broncos from Santa Clara. The last
time we faced the Santa Clarans
was in a basketball game last quar
ter, in which the Farm went down
to inglorious defeat. The tennis
team is out to redeem the colors of
the Red and White.
Three days later, on Saturday, the
Naval Training Station team from
Treasure Island scoots down to the
Farm to play the local netters.
Stanford students are cordially
invfted to attend both matches.
Let's hope the attendance is better
than at the baseball game last Sat
