# Six-Month Draft Suspension Proposed by New House Bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 8 (UP).—
Chairman Carl Vinson, D., Ga., ol
the House Naval Affairs Committee
today introduced a bill to suspend
the draft for six months in favor of
a high-pay recruiting drive, despite
Gen. Dwight E. Eisenhower's stern
warning that anti-conscription leg
islators were "gambling" with the
national security.
Vinson, one of the most influen
tial members of the Lower House,
voiced a growing sentiment on both
sides of the Capitol against out
light extension of the Selective
Service law beyond its May 15 ex
piration date.
His bill proposes that the status
of conscription be frozen from May
15 to Nov. 15, during which time
the armed forces would conduct an

intensive recruiting drive to bring
in volunteers at pay rates averag
ing 30 to 100 per cent over the pres
ent scales.
"If, by the end of that period, the
required numbers of enlisted per
sonnel have not been obtained,"
Vinson told the House, "the bill
provides that the President shall
declare that a national emergency
exists, and shall invoke the draft
for one year until Nov. 15. 1947.
His bill was introduced a few
hours after Eisenhower went before
the Senate Military Affairs Com
mittee in a last-minute bid to win
support for the extension, which
President Truman has called the
keystone of his national security
program. •
