The postwar edition of the Big
Reds romped out to practice, eager
to learn football a la Schwartz. With
a nucleus for next season's varsity
at hand,' Stanford is once again as
sured of a niche on the pigskin map
of the nation.
'I ho onening session of the 150-
day spring season was confined to
calisthenics to loosen lip the mus
cles, some passing and punting
drills to uncork tight joints. Also
a few stock T-formation plays by
eleven men combinations to liven
up brain cells on the fundamentals
of football.
The afternoon started off pleasant
ly enough as the liveried Indians
went through their football paces,
bringing more than a glow of
warmth to the hearts of a handful of
spectators and newspaper scribes,
for King Football, while away from
the Farm for a forced exile of three
long years, has been far from forgot
ten.
Yesterday's practice was a far cry
from the last spring session held in
1943, when men were disappearing
as fast as flour goes through a sieve.
Now the war is over, and the players
are flocking back to the campus to
resume their interrupted careers.
Midway through the workout, a
breeze came up out of the north,
and brought with it more than a
tinge of autumnish zephyrs and
ciiills. The wind made it difficult
for the punters to do much with
their boots in the way of aiming,
so Coach Schwartz broke the
squad into teams for the purpose
of keeping the "leather eggs" with
in the enclosed field.
The second practice session is
skedded for this afternoon, and de
spite the unqualified dulllness of
spring football, if there is anything
that sounds sweeter than a football
being booted by a man clad in white
linen pants and jersey, we haven't
heard it.
