# Haynie Sees Great Season
## 
### 
"Our swimming team should
whip USC and UCLA when we
meet them April 1!) and 20 respect
ively." Coach Tom Haynie asserted
yesterday. He admitted that he
didn't know at first hand any of
their material, but from their rec
ords to date he predicted an easy
victory for the Farm swimmers.
He stated, "We have a very prom
ising squad which should swamp our
southern competitors."
The team will carry ten men to
the meet. The tentative list includes
the following team aspirants: Free
style: Armstrong, Rule, Anderson,
Eastman, and Sterry; back stroke:
Briskin and Borchers; breast stroke:
Hestor.
Four more breast strokers who are
aiming for a place on the squad are
801, Eigler, Vitousek, and Carpenter.
These fellows are at present point
ing toward some competition among
themselves which will determine
who gets the nod from Coach Hay
nie.
Armstrong is Stanford's repre
sentative in the middle distance
event doing the 400-yard stint.
Anderson competes in the 50 and
100-yard dash has beenn showing
the most flash in recent meets.
Rule shares the 220-yard event
with Armstrong and is being
counted on to capture some points
for us in the coming meet.
