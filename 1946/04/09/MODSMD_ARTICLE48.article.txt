# The
						Umpire's Verdict
## 
### 
After the first complete week of j
play, Pacific Coast baseball fans find
the San Francisco Seals leading the j
loop with the envious record of eight
wins and only two defeats. "Lefty"
O'Doul's hard-hitting Seals found
little trouble in drubbing the hap
games to two.
The big question for the Seals
is whether or not their pitching
will hold out. Compared with clubs
like Portland and Seattle, Seal
pitching seems below par, but,
with Jennings. Taormina. and Fain
in the lineup, it appears that good
pitching is not a necessity.
The surprise series of the week
was the Oakland Acorns' upset of
the Portland Beavers, five games to
two. Marv Owen's crippled infield,
in which the only regular still play
ing is first-sacker Larry Barton,
made too many errors and too few
hits for the Beavers to do much bet
ter. Beaver pitching was the bright
spot of the series from the Portland
side.
This week will see Portland at
[ San Francisco. If Manager Owen
can get his infield in better shape,
this should be the hottest series to
date. These are probably the top
clubs of the league: the Beavers
! are the defending champions and
the Seals are the current favorites
for this year's pennant.
| As for the other clubs, the Oak
j land Acorns and the Seattle Rainiers
j are the biggest surprises. The Oaks
are currently in second place, and
| this seems far better than they are
; capable of; the next few weeks will
probably see a rapid fall in Acorn
j stock.
Bill Skiff's Rainiers have got off
J to an even worse start than their
i Northwest compatriots, the PortUnd
I Beavers. Seattle can boast of good
| pitching and fair hitting, and they
) should rise quickly above their pres-
I ent lowly position.
Hollywood has at last come out
of the doldrums. The Stars are a
completely made over club this
year. Buck Fawcett's boys stand a
good chance of making the first
division this year.
j Los Angeles is currently riding
I high, with victories over Seattle and
i Sacramento. About San Diego and
j Sacramento, the less said the better,
j These teams should be last in what
j may be the PCL's last year as a
| minor league.
