Final preparations for a greatly
enlarged Softball Intrmaural League
were b'eing completed today by
Coach Elwyn Bugge, who an
nounced that the entry list for the
annual event will be closed this
evening. Late entrants are request
ed to "sign up" in the Men's Gym
nasium in order that the schedule
can be drawn up for Thursday's
inaugural games.
Mr. Bugge also urged all soft
ball-minded students who live off
campus to contact him at once in
order to organize an independent
aggregation. Tentative plans for
organization have been drawn up
as a result of numerous requests for
such a team.
Thus far 12 teams have expressed
a desire to participate in the intra
mural tournament, with three of
the group representing F.ncina Hall.
Intramural regulations are very
definite concerning eligibility of
different organizations. All living
groups and fraternities may com
pete, with the added provision that
the freshman hall be divided as to
floors and wings.
Games will be played on Tues
days and Thursdays at 4:30 p.m.,
with th 1 ? initial pairing scheduled
for April 11.
Possibility of a softball "world
series" was furthered by the an
nouncement that the Navy will op
erate its own eight-team league. A
playoff between the two winners,
civilian and service, looms as a cli
max to the league season.
