## Ashley Out, but Peters, Ahlquist Return to Indian Baseball Lineup 
### STU MILLAR 
So that they could watch the open
ing day of spring football practice
I and in hopes that a layoff might be
| the needed cure to iose-itis," Harry
| Wolter gave his base bailers the day
off yesterday.
The team's next game is with
Santa Clara on the Sunken Dia
mond tomorrow. It will he the
first of a two-game home and
home series between the Broncos
and the Cards.
Little has been heard on the Farm
I about the potentiality of the Santa
Clara nine. But a few days after
S.F.U. downed the Farm horsehiders,
they performed the same trick
I against the Broncos.
| Sneaking of the Dons, the Stan
j foids will have a chance to return
i the compliment the "Sfus" paid them
i last Saturday; they will journey up
to the city for a rematch on May 18.
At any rate, the locals should he

till with one exception. Tom Ash
ley. steady-fielding utihty infield
ei, has been forced to drop from
the baseball scene. But Dick Ahl
j quist should be fully recovered
from a sore ankle received when
he tripped in a hole on the "well
kept 1 " Southern California diamond
down south. Boh Piters will be
almost completely whole after be
ing hit by one ailment after an
other. And perhaps the sore flip
pers of Bill McGovern and Dick
Flatiand will take a little use.
Wolter hasn't announced a dexinite
