# World Movement of 'Y' Told by Stanford Women
## 
### VIRGINIA SCHULTZ 
A more emphatic manifestation of
the international and all-inclusive
qualities of the Y.W.C.A. was the
result of the 17th annual conven
tion held in Atlantic City, N.J., from
March 2 to 8, declared Guyhi Run
yan and Eleanor Brill, Stanford's
representatives at the recent meet
ing.
At a special foreign division
meeting, women from India,
Egypt, England, the Philippine
Islands, Holland. China, Korea,
Belgium. France and Brazil
spoke of the ' Y" groups in their
countries, illustrating how world
wide the movement is.
War Experiences
The president of the world "Y,"
Miss Ruth Rauss, of England, told
of the spiritual deepening which
has resulted from war-time expe
riences in Europe. In Estonia the
"Y" had to go underground and
later into exile in Sweden, as it did
in several other countries. Russian
"Y" work has been discontinued,
but five branches have been set up
in the British zone of Germany.
"It's hard to feel a common
Ixiihl and meet on a common
ground." commented Miss Brill
on the foreign "Y" situation,
"with people who have gone
through so much. They are all so
anxious to set things right and
would have done anything for

their cause. It's the kind of spirit
which united us in war, hut is
lacking and hard to find now."
Need Leadership
All the women emphasized the
need for forceful leadership from
I this country and for facilities in
| which the "Y" eould meet. Miss
; Kui Ming of China said that their
staff, suffering badly from war
nerves, needs rest. As Miss Brill
said, "They know the needs but
don't have the facilities. It's a tre
mendous job for interested young
j persons to help put the people on
their feet again."
The significant value of an or
ganization like the "Y" was illus
trated by Miss Priobola Mangat-
Rai of India when she depicted
the "Y" as the one roof in India
under which Moslems, Hindus,
and Christians can meet on equal
and friendly terms. Although not
a "Y" worker herself, she repre
sented the organization as the one
group aide to bridge the gulf of
ill-feeling between the various
religious groups.
