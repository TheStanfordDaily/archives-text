# Smith to Talk To Engineers
## 
### 
Walter C. Smith of the General
Electric Company will speak to
morrow evening before the newly
! formed joint student chapter of the
American Institute of Electrical En
j gineering and the Institute of Radio
| Engineering.
Mr. Smith's topic will be "New
Electrical Horizons," and he will
I describe forthcoming postwar uses
|of electricity resulting from war
j time developments. The talk will
be given in room 268 of the Engi
nering Building at 7:30.
Subjects Mr. Smith will discuss
will include new magnetic alloys,
electroeoated materials, insulations,
and the silicones, one of which is
! the so-called '"bouncing putty," or
! silicone rubber. He will also dis
| cuss industrial electronics, high
voltage X-rays, the electron micro-
I scope, and present trends in tele
| vision.
The presentation will mark the
i first meeting of the new combined
| group at Stanford representing the
j two national electrical engineering
! organizations. All interested per
j sons are invited, and applications
| for new membership will be ac
' cepted at the meeting.

find out about the "Y" program. !
Th situation there is somewhat dif
ferent in that there is a state reli
! gion and consequently a stress on
I the religious side which does not i
I appear in other countries.
The most difficult problem the
Lowlands are encountering, sum- j
marized Miss Brill, is in deter
mining their attitude toward the
Germans and their own "Quis
lings." German thoughts and [
ways have infiltrated the country |
just in the process of fighting
them, so that liberation has pro
duced many problems previously
hidden.
j Syrian Position
Like other countries, Holland i
does not have the centers in which ;
j to bring women together, observed j
| the representative, and the "Y" ]
| feels a definite responsibility to
j ward the young girls who have be
come socially unbalanced because
of war confusion.
Although there was no mate
rial destruction in Syria, Miss
I Zurayk said her country's need |
was to rebuild toward national
: solidarity. With the emancipation
1 of women there is a resulting mi
gration to the city with its con
current problems of industriali
zation. Syria's spokesman de
plored the lack of rural work in
her country as well as all over
; the world, pointing out that the \
I Syrian "Y" owned only one i
building in which to carry out
its work.
All Faiths Unite .
The East is in a period of transi- j
tion, described Miss Aida Gindy of
j Egypt, now studying social service
!at Bryn Mawr. There the "Y" is j
j encouraging girls to follow their !
bents and skills and helping indus- j
| trial groups to learn their status
and rights.
Miss Brill stressed that if the
"Y" was to be a world movement,
it must make it possible for all
groups. Christians, Moslems, Hin
dus, and those of other faiths, to
meet on a common ground. By
( having no creed except the reso
lution to abide by Christian prin
ciples, the "\ r " is able to become

Walter C. Smith of the General

Mr. Smith's topic will be "New

I describe forthcoming postwar uses

be given in room 268 of the Engi

Subjects Mr. Smith will discuss
will include new magnetic alloys,
electroeoated materials, insulations,
and the silicones, one of which is
! the so-called '"bouncing putty," or
! silicone rubber. He will also dis
| cuss industrial electronics, high
voltage X-rays, the electron micro-
I scope, and present trends in tele

The presentation will mark the
