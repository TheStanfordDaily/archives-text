# International Club Representatives Advocate World Federation of Nations to Replace U.N.
## 
### MARY VIRGINIA POND 
A heated debate on the prospect
of a federal world government to
replace the now existing U.N. was
the highlight of Sunday night's
meeting of International Club at the
home of Mr. and Mrs. Edwin J.
Thomas in Palo Alto.
Charlie Clark, president of the
Student Committee for World Fed
eration, and Art Berman from the
same organization led the discus
sion with a presentation of the
problem of living in an atomic age
and the need for a federal world
government with ascendancy over
the rule of separate nation-states
in world politics.
berman began ihc discussion
by pointing out the fact that man
has at last been able to convert
matter into energy capable of ex
ploding and producing untold
damage to cities and populations.
"Man-made atomic explosion on
July lfi, 1945, in the deserts of
New Mexico was the greatest
single event of our lifetime," Ber
man said.
He added that the war ended as
it began—with fear, nor did the A
bomb do away with a problem that
has always existed—war. "Techni
cal advances," Berman stated, "have
brought the world closer together.
One thousand years of history have
been compressed into a fraction of
a second."
According to Berman the concept
of the sovereignty of a nation-state
of war for the United States lay not
in the hands of Congress but in the
control of Tokyo in December 1941.
The atom bomb makes law
above nations imperative. We
will get world government either
by conquest and force or by the

| voluntary action hacked hv the
peoples of the world," Herman
! asserted.
"There is no more room in this
j world for nations doing as they
I please, jockeying for positions of
' power, or for exploiting other peo
j pies for their own selfish interests,"
j Berman contended. "India and In
| donesia are everyone's problems."
Berman pointed out that though
j there are differences among the na
j tions and peoples of the world, it is
j because of these differences, not in
! spile of them, that world govern
ment is necessary. "We can pre
serve nationality and still rid our
selves of the evils of nationalism,"
he contended. "People who think
we can live in the old way of play
ing the game of power politics are
] the true idealists of today."
In regard to the potency of the
| atomic bomb, Berman emphasized
i that today's bomb is incredibly
larger, that it is only five per cent
efficient, and that only one per
cent of a few pounds of matter
has been converted into energy,
and yet the damage that can be
; done is well known.
j Clark devoted his discussion to
I explaining the basic fundamentals
| of world federalism and describing
j the activities of the Student Fed
' eralists, a comparatively young or
i ganization in the United States
campaigning among high school and
i college students for federal world
I government.
Asserting that both I he League of
; Nations and the present U.N. are
I based upon the sovereignty of the
nation, Clark stated that the basic
j principle of world federation is that
I the sovereignty resides in the indi
| vidual as a citizen of one world.
"Federal world government,"
Clark added, "demands a written
constitution defining powers and
limitations of this government, an

executive, judicial, and most im
portant a legislative system to
enact laws that will bind nations."
According to Clark there have
been steps taken in the United
States in the promotion of world
federation by several state legisla
tures through the adoption of a
resolution requesting Congressmen
to support and vote for a resolution
approving the principle of world
federation.
That resolution also requests the
President to initiate the procedure
necessary to formulate a constitu
tion for world federation which
shall be submitted to each nation
for its ratification. That resolution
has already been introduced into
Congress, Clark said, but needs a
sufficient majority backing of Amer
icans to get action on the proposi
tion.
Stating that peoples of different
races, creeds, and faiths can live
together harmoniously under law,
Clark said that Capt. Harold E.
Stassen and Ernest Bcvin of
Great Britain had declared their
support of federal world govern
ment.
Clark stated that the Student
Federalists, which was first organ
ized in Scarsdale, New York, has
since spread to 25 states, and from
an original membership of seven
students has expanded to include
several thousand members.
The Student Federalists' pur
pose calls for the stimulation of
thinking, education and prepara
tion for leadership, and for tak
ing action whenever possible for
the promotion of federal world
government.
Clark concluded by asserting that
world government is a political, fact
and "only now can world sover
eignty destroy national sovereignty
while still having the power to pre
serve national identity."
