Opposition to tlr,* increasing dis

and passed at the seventeenth na- j
tional convention of the "Y." Stan- 1
ford was represented at the meet
! ing in Atlantic City, N.J., from
j March 2 to 8 by Eleanor Brill,
; Guyla Runyan, and "Miss Pat'" Da- i
vidson, the "Y" secretary.
Deliberate Flunking
Miss Brill reported, "The conven
tion estimated women would be j
j set back 10 *y cars because of the
situation created by the number of j

veterans flocking into the country's
colleges and crowding out the /
women. For example, the Univer
sity of Texas is purposely trying to
flunk out women."
At the University of Oklahoma
15 girls, ail student leaders and
in their junior or senior year in
pre - medical training, were re
quested to remain out of school
a year or more, thus seriously in
terrupting their education, and
were not provided housing facili
ties because of the great influx of
veterans, stated Miss Kunyan. A
group of alumni, feeling that
these women were much too val
uable to the school to he lost, are
now building and financing a co
operative house in which these
and other women encountering
the same conditions may live and
he allowed to continue their ed
ucation.
Vets vs. Women
"The feeling at the convention,"
continued Miss Brill, "was that
many of the veterans who ordina
rily wouldn't have attended college

| have not been eliminated because j
I of the state universities' policies of
'first come, first served,' with no
j qualifications needed."
No immediate hope for relief
could he foreseen because no new
source of faculty is accessible and
no supply of housing available.
Women are being forced either
into not attending college at all or i
j attending a secondary, inferior j
j school.
j Whither Discrimination?
Miss Brill emphasized the conse- j
quences of the discrimination in the j
decline of inter - education, j
since some state universities will no
longer admit out-of-state people,
I and in decrease of foreign exchange
j students as a result, of the same
plan. She believes, "This is a mis- |
take because exchange students are j
j the best way to create understand- ;
ing and tolerance about our neigh- !
bors as Stanford is doing with its j
| Turkish, Persian, Chinese, and oth- |
j er foreign students."
The "Y" convention adopted a I
| resolution concerning the discrimi- !

nation against women which, ac
cording to "Miss Pat," a member of
the resolutions committee, asked
local organizations to study and be
aware of the present problem re
garding equal educational oppor
tunities for women and men.
Internationalism
Calling the"V" "the most in
ternational tiling possible," Miss
Brill stressed the fact that "the
l Y' has no creed cxcept to carry
out Christian principles. It is in
terested in social and human
problems whatever they may be.
Its purpose is to be a world
movement for everybody."
"The 'Y' is an intcrfaith group,"
pointed out Miss Brill. A New York
priest and a rabbi assured the con
vention that the "Y" policies were
not in conflict with any of their
respective beliefs. "Miss Pat" praised
Miss Brill as the leader of the dis
cussion on the religious, non-sec
tarian position of the "Y."
Reconstruction
At its last main session the con

vention appropriated $2,000,000 for
tin- reconstruction of "Y's" all over
the world. An additional $500,000
; was given to facilitate the spread
j of "Y" work in this country.
Miss Brill commented that
Stanford was fortunate in having
an employed "Y" staff worker
who can work closely and in co
operation with the administration.
Only ,'Â»0 universities have paid
workers like "Miss Pat," and be
cause of this a university admin-
I istration oftentimes will not co
operate with the "Y" group.
! Policies Set
About .'l,OOO delegates attended
I the convention, around 300 repre
| senting students and almost as
I many colleges. Miss Runyan ob
served that strangely the West was
j better represented than the other
sections of the country. The pur
pose of the meeting, the fust in six
years, was to set policies of the na
tional "Y" for the next three years.
I Th trip from Stanford was fi
j nanced by the Y.W.C.A. advisory

board and the "Y" cabinet and in
part by the girls themselves.
Miss Brill was a member of the
ways and means committee which
investigated the general state of af
fairs of the "Y." It was found that
the South and the West were the
most confused and most generally
in need of employed staff workers.
According to Miss Brill, "This il
lustrates the general trend and up
set of communities which has been
toward those sections."
Miss Kunyan was a member of
the group which gave recom
mendations on the criteria for the
selection of national hoard mem
| hers who were elected at the
meeting.
Miss Brill and Miss Runyan both
agreed that attending the conven
tion was a wonderful privilege and
thai it gave them a broad picture
of the "Y," showing what a far
reaching institution it Is. "Miss
! Pat" commended both the girls for
| making outstanding contributions
I to the student assemblies.
