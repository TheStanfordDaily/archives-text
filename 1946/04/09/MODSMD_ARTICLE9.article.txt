WASHINGTON, April 8 (UP).â€” !
: The United States is spending more j
| than $1,000,00 a day to manufacture 1
! and improve atomic bombs and to j
explore new military and civilian
| uses for this cosmic force, a reliable j
I source revealed today.
Practically all of this 8400.000,-
000-a-ycar program, this source
said, is being financed out of the |
President's special war funds, j
which are in effect a blank treas
ury check to be drawn on as Mr. j
Truman sees lit.
It was the first disclosure of the !
i scale on which the United States is
I continuing its atomic project, after I

a secret wartime outlay of more than
2,000,000,000 to develop the first su
per-bombs that blasted Japan into
surrender.
It came at the height of a furi
ous Senate fight over the extent
of the controls to be maintained
on the nation's peacetime atomic
spending, now running at well
over half the wartime rate.
A Senate economy bloc led by Sen.
Harry F. Byrd (D., Va.) succeeded
in winning approval from the atomic
energy committee of several amend
ments designed to crack down on all
forms of "atomic boondoggling" in
the highly secretive program.
