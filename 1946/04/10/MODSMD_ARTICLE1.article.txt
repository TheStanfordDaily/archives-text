CHUNGKING, April 9 UP). — Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek said today that the United Nations
will succeed if the United States continues its present
role of vigorous world leadership.
China stands squarely behind the U.N., Chiang

said in an interview, but the lead
ers of the present Chinese govern
ment are not so naive as to believe
they can sit supinely by and de
pend on the U.N. to preserve peace
without the active support of all
democratic peoples,
The world myst constantly be on
guard to defend democratic insti
tutions, the generalissimo said. He
repeatedly asserted the United
States must continue aggressive
world leadership because it is the
only nation with the power to pre
serve democracy in the fact of any
threat.
The Chungking government is
now holding talks with the Chinese
Communist party in an cflort to
agree on a coalition in which the
Communists would be represented
adequately, and Chiang said he be
lieved such a coalition might be
achieved shortly. He emphasized,
however, that the Communists and
all other parties must devote them
selves solely to the welfare of China
as a whole and not attempt to "bore
from within."
As long qs the United States
maintains its present firm and ada
mant support of the United Nations,
the outlook for peace is excellent,
Chiang believes. In his view, Amer
ican foreign policy at present leaves
little to be desired.

NEW YORK, April 9 (UP). —Russia ended its his
toric boycott of the United Nations Security Council
today at a meeting which started as a love feast and
ended with the threat tof a grave new crisis when Iran
demanded that its dispute with Russia remain on the

Council program.
A second crisis remained in the
I background—Poland's demand that
i all members of the U.N. break re
j lations with Franco Spain.
Iran's letter, sensational in its
I complete unexpectedness, was a rc
! tort to Russia's demand that the
j Council erase the whole Russo-
I Iranian question from its program
j immediately.
; Hussein Ala, Iranian representa
tive, wrote U.N. Secretary General
| Trygve Lie that his government's
position was unchanged. On the
basis of fresh instructions from
Tehran Ala added:
"It is the desire of my govern
j ment that the matters referred by
Iran to the Security Council re
main on its agenda as provided by
the resolution adopted 4 April
| 1916."
News of Iran's letter reached the
j'Council chamUer just before an
| adjournment subject to the call of
Lie—probably Monday after dele
gates have had time to work out
strategy and tactics for another cri
sis stage in Big Three relations.
Russian Chief Delegate Andrei A.
Gromyko ended his boycott when
lie walked into the Council cham
ber at 3:03 p.m. It had lasted 12
days, 21 hours, and 42 minutes.
