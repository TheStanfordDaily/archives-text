# French Oppose Big 3, Want Foreign Affairs Reviewed Openly--Guerard
## 
### 
Stating that in principles the Unit
ed States and France arc one, al
though in force, France is not in our
class, Albert Guerard, professor of
general literature, spoke on "France
Today and Tomorrow" at last night's
program of the Tuesday Evening
Series.
l>oth France and the United
States are founded on the princi
ples of the rights of man. he said.
"Although Americans love France,
they are pursuing a policy inimical
to France. The French are com
mitted to a world organization and
have no faith in the wisdom of the
IJig Three. They want foreign af
fairs conducted scrupulously in
the open."
Some say that since June, 19-10,
France doesn't count, Mr. Guerard
said, but France fell because she
was the most exposed of the democ
racies. England was saved by the
Channel, and the United States by
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. If
England or the United States could
have aided France she would not
have surrendered.
As it was, part of France re
mained in the tight. I'etain and
Laval didn't represent all of
France. "France was down hut

not out." Mr. Guerard continued.
"Iler soil and people were not ex
hausted and will power was left."
On October 21, 1945, France held
its first general elections in nine
years. The Communists, Socialists,
and Radical Socialists (bourgeois
liberals) were represented, the first
two having the largest vote. De-
Gaulle was a strong executive rep
resenting the French people as a
whole. He did not assert his author
ity as agaist the assembly. The pres
ident and parties were in harmony.
"The break between the parties
and DcGaullc came over the size of
the army—the Communists and So
cialists wanted it reduced. So De-
Gaulle resigned with dignity and
without spoiling his record," Mr.
Guerard said.
The new constitution has not
reached its final stage, IV!r. Gue
rard asserted. A single assembly
will control the executive. France
could turn into a one-party dic
tatorship. lull there are three fair
ly evenly-divided parties which
combine differently 011 different
issues. France will have a purely
ornamental figurehead.
"DeGnulle is still working for

greater Franco," Mr. Guerard con
tinued. He wants a well-knit .satis
fied country and a belter standard of
living for all. Agricultural work
ers will decrease. Private industry
could absorb them, but many of them
will work for the state, a position
that means security and dignity for
Frenchmen. France will become
more socialistic and will try to pro
vide a good life for the common man.
Imperialist expansion is disap
proved in France, Mr. Guerard
said. "The French are working
for a French federal union with
their colonies, believing that part
nership is more favorable to prog
ress than nationalism. French rule
in the colonics in the past has
been quite humane. The French
are free from race prejudice and
their method of rule has been na
tive cooperation. The colonics will
have individual self-rule and be
associated with France on terms
of liberty, equality, and frater
nity."
In foreign policy, France does not
want Germany to rearm. She wants
to control the Saar region and have
the Ruhr controlled internationally.

the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. If
England or the United States could
have aided France she would not
have surrendered.
As it was, part of France re
mained in the tight. I'etain and
Laval didn't represent all of
France. "France was down hut

not out." Mr. Guerard continued.
"Iler soil and people were not ex
hausted and will power was left."
On October 21, 1945, France held
its first general elections in nine
years. The Communists, Socialists,
and Radical Socialists (bourgeois
liberals) were represented, the first
two having the largest vote. De-
Gaulle was a strong executive rep
resenting the French people as a
whole. He did not assert his author
ity as agaist the assembly. The pres
ident and parties were in harmony.
"The break between the parties
and DcGaullc came over the size of
the army—the Communists and So
cialists wanted it reduced. So De-
Gaulle resigned with dignity and
without spoiling his record," Mr.
Guerard said.
The new constitution has not
reached its final stage, IV!r. Gue
rard asserted. A single assembly
will control the executive. France
could turn into a one-party dic
tatorship. lull there are three fair
ly evenly-divided parties which
combine differently 011 different
issues. France will have a purely
ornamental figurehead.
"DeGnulle is still working for

greater Franco," Mr. Guerard con
tinued. He wants a well-knit .satis
fied country and a belter standard of
living for all. Agricultural work
ers will decrease. Private industry
could absorb them, but many of them
will work for the state, a position
that means security and dignity for
Frenchmen. France will become
more socialistic and will try to pro
vide a good life for the common man.
Imperialist expansion is disap
proved in France, Mr. Guerard
said. "The French are working
for a French federal union with
their colonies, believing that part
nership is more favorable to prog
ress than nationalism. French rule
in the colonics in the past has
been quite humane. The French
are free from race prejudice and
their method of rule has been na
tive cooperation. The colonics will
have individual self-rule and be
associated with France on terms
of liberty, equality, and frater
nity."
In foreign policy, France does not
want Germany to rearm. She wants
to control the Saar region and have
the Ruhr controlled internationally.

Stating that in principles the Unit
ed States and France arc one, al
though in force, France is not in our
class, Albert Guerard, professor of
general literature, spoke on "France
Today and Tomorrow" at last night's
program of the Tuesday Evening
Series.
l>oth France and the United
States are founded on the princi
ples of the rights of man. he said.
"Although Americans love France,
they are pursuing a policy inimical
to France. The French are com
mitted to a world organization and
have no faith in the wisdom of the
IJig Three. They want foreign af
fairs conducted scrupulously in
the open."
Some say that since June, 19-10,
France doesn't count, Mr. Guerard
said, but France fell because she
was the most exposed of the democ
racies. England was saved by the
Channel, and the United States by
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. If
England or the United States could
have aided France she would not
have surrendered.
