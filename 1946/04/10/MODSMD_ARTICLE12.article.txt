# Academic Rules Changed
## Student, Faculty Sampling Approves Grade Change 
### 
The following opinions were given on the new scholarship regulations
which go into cllect at the end of, summer quarter:
PEGGY (*!ANAHL—The regulations arc a good tiling. Lots of students
work just enough to get by. It is necessary to make room for those who
really want to work, a.s so many want to get into Stanford.

CARL F. BRAND, history profcs-*
sor—ln view of the fact that Stan- j
ford has limited endowment and
that existing facilities are greatly
overcrowded, I believe the move is
wise because it means that the j
Stanford investment will be made
in those most capable of taking ad- j
vantage of it and who will make j
the greatest social return.
CLAIRE THOMAS—I'm in favor
of it. If a student can't keep a "C"
average, he is not a college student.
A student might go minus a lot one
quarter for a special reason, and
this should be taken into considera
tion.
JAMES H. ARMSTRONG —The I
regulations are required because so ;
many wa?it to get into Stanford. It '
is regrettable that these goals have i
to be set for a student body. How
ever, the Administration should be j
commended for giving advance no
tice so that students will have an ■
equal chance to make the grade.
THOMAS S. BARCLAY, profes
sor of political science—l favor the
revised provisions. I believe they
are an improvement over the ex
isting arrangements, especially dur- I
inthe next three or four years. I ■
trust they will be supplemented by I
thorough revision of the existing |
entrance requirements for students |
of all levels.
BILL MOSER—It is good to have j
the sam'J provisions for both upper I
and lower divisions.
LIN MILLER—It's a good thing. I
It will make a person conscious of |
his studies more than his social ac
tivities.
LORRAINE PIELHOP, BARBA
RA CARTER. ILLIE COSTIGAN—
It's a good thing in general and it
is good to have upper and lower di
visions on the same basis.
EDWARD WHITE, lecturer in
history—lt is in order for the Uni
versity to give facilities to those
who can make the best use of them.
But scholarship standings should be
required in any period. It is un
fortunate they were lowered dur
ing the war. It is a move in the di
rection of clarifying the first pur
pose of a university.
FRED VENULETH — I think it's
better just to have regulations fol
lower division.
ALVERA KAHN — Upper division
students should have the same reg
ulations as lower, but probation at
minus 11 is a little harsh.

pose of a university.
FRED VENULETH — I think it's
better just to have regulations fol
lower division.
ALVERA KAHN — Upper division
students should have the same reg
ulations as lower, but probation at
minus 11 is a little harsh.
The following opinions were given on the new scholarship regulations
which go into cllect at the end of, summer quarter:
PEGGY (*!ANAHL—The regulations arc a good tiling. Lots of students
work just enough to get by. It is necessary to make room for those who
really want to work, a.s so many want to get into Stanford.

CARL F. BRAND, history profcs-*

A student might go minus a lot one
quarter for a special reason, and
this should be taken into considera
tion.
JAMES H. ARMSTRONG —The I
regulations are required because so ;
many wa?it to get into Stanford. It '
is regrettable that these goals have i
to be set for a student body. How
ever, the Administration should be j
commended for giving advance no

equal chance to make the grade.
THOMAS S. BARCLAY, profes

revised provisions. I believe they
are an improvement over the ex

inthe next three or four years. I ■
