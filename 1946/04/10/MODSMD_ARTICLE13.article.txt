ation, realizing the grave .signifi
cance of the atomic bomb and
recognizing the imperative need
for prompt, concerted action to
prevent the outbreak of atomic
warfare, do hereby resolve to aid,
in every possible way, the grow

ment of a Federal World Clov
crnmcnt responsible directly to
the people.
World Citizenship Stressed
"It Ls our firm conviction that the
most effective means of preventing
atomic warfare is through a system
of law and government, having ju
risdiction over only those affairs
which transcend national bounda
ries and threaten world peace, such
as the manufacture of atomic weap
ons.
