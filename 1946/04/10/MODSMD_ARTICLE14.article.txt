The new scholarship regulations announced yesterday indi
cate the swing towards higher academic standards which is
coming full circle at Stanford with the return of peacetime
conditions.
What's important about it? It means, simply, that every stu
dent will be reguired to keep a closer check on his grade point
average than he has in the past, and that those who do not will
be suspended or disgualified to make room for others who can
utilize the advantages of the University to a fuller extent.
We've felt for a long time that there was something wrong
with a system which allows an Upper Division student to go as
far minus as 90—there have been such cases—and so the new
provision to extend the same standards to Upper Division and
graduate students that apply to Lower Division students seems
only fair, in view of the many gualified persons on the waiting
hst to enter the University.
For Stanford in general, we see the plan to tighten scholastic
regulations as a necessary step which should raise the sights of
all students to a college degree that actually means something
in academic values.
