The proposition that the postwar era will
he one marked by deliberate discrimination
against women, as set forth by the YWCA
national convention, and the resolution of
the "Y" not to "let 'em get away with it" ap
pears to place a negative emphasis on the
nncinnt problem of womankind's place in the
world.
During the war, women everywhere took
a step up in the ladder of responsibilities.
Today they may have to lake a step down,
became of agreements between employers
and employees when the draft beckoned the
latter, because some men are intrinsically
better qualified to fill specific positions, or
because in a question of equal merit, the man
may be involved in more representative
thoughts, trends, and major issues.

The proffered example of discrimination
—deliberate flunking of women, the request
of the University of Oklahoma that 15 senior
women leave school for a year—are two
which have incurred the righteous wrath of
college women and which will, if repeated
for the pure cause of getting rid of women,
seriously damage the colleges themselves.
No student, no citizen, man or woman, will
stand for objective and unfounded discrim
ination. No woman is going to be "gypped."
Woman's attitude toward any such trend
should be a careful stock-taking of her abili
ties, and a renewed effort to do her best if
she wishes to continue in the competition;
her reward and recognition will be propor
tional to her competence.—BMV.
