"It Should Be Simple," was the title of a
Daily editorial of last quarter devoted to the
question of extending the closing hours of
women's halls on Saturday nights to 1:30,
and yesterday it was finally announced that
the idea was to be put on a trial basis.
Now we're saying that "it should be sim

pie" for Stanford men and women to prove
during this trial period that they are com
pletely capable of conduct that can't be
questioned either by older persons or by
fellow students.
If a fairly-reported trial basis on closing
hours doesn't work out, it's nobody's fault
but our own.
