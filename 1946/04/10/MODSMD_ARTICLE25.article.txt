Kclili r, The Daily:
Th.* situation at the Reserve Book Room, as all
will rarely agree, is appalling. It is obvious that
something must be done about it.
May we suggest as possible remedies:
1. More clerks to issue, put away, and check
books.

2. An auxiliary reserve book room.to lessen l
congestion.
3. At least benches so we can sit in line.
4. More books.
