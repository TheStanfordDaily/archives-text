The girls at Madrono have been practicing kick
the-can of late and are now ready to enter intra
mural competition. Only difficulty they've expe
rienced so far is finding a copy of the National Col
legiate Athletic Association official kick-the-can
rulebook.
A No. 2Va Del Monte peach can has been found
to be the best suited for the game. It is durable, yet
li lit enough for long-distance boots. However, the
r< ( inversion squeeze isn't off yet and No. 2',<2 Del
Mi.nte poach cans are still pretty scarce, so when
you empty any No. 2 1 cans, save them for the
Madrono girls.
Speaking of campus intramural sports, down on
28th ;treet, "The Row" at the Univ. of So. Cal., the
college kiddies spend their afternoons flying kites.
We understand that if you get on the varsity kite
flyers the school will givo you an athletic scholar
ship and a job pruning blossoms off a century plant.

Here is one of the first entries in the annual
Stanford Shaggy Dog Story contest:
A man who has been drinking comes out of a
lounge where they serve drinks at an early hour for
dt inking.

The street is clear except for a milk wagon and
horse parked at the curb. The man turns and heads
down the street only to be halted by the request,
"Got the time, Bub?"
Bub looks around. No one there. Must be his
imagination, so he turns and starts off again. "What
time is it, Doc?" says the voice this time. Doc is
really worried this time. It couldn't have been the
horse, but that's the only living thing on the street.
Sure enough, the horse sounds off again, "Can't
you toll me the time, Mac?" This is astounding,
thinks Mac, so he goes over and engages the talking
horse in some talking repartee.
The horse had led a very interesting life. He was
born a racer, and among other triumphs, had taken
the Kentucky Derby as a three-year-old. But he
lost his speed, and for the past five years had been
bouncing around from one odd job to another; now
here he is pulling a Grade "B" milk wagon.
About this time the milkman comes out of a
nearby alley and climbs into the wagon. The some
what-sobered drunk says to him, "Say, George, do
you know you've got an astounding horse here?"
To which George replies, "Has he been telling
that Kentucky Derby story again?"
