NOTE to ASSU President Kennedy: Wh.*?n Toyon
Club closed its books their equipment was given
over to the ASSU for safe keeping. Among their
j.os'C'ssions were several canoes. Toyon Club will
not op"it again until next September, at the earliest.
And the canoes will stay locked in the Boathouse
until the good Boathouse season is just over. These
canoes could he given to the sailors or to the stu
dent body for their use. All your rules require is
that one or perhaps a couple of the old Toyon Club
( (fleers give the o.k. We'll bet that a couple of them
are either on campus or can be easily located. As
ASSU prexy you could easily do this and give the
sailors a bit more fun in their last quarter at Stan
ford.
TALK about novel betweon-quarter vacations.
One of our boys found a corpse down at Santa
Cruz. Can you top that?
DID you sec that picture of Emperor Hirohito in
Tuesday's Chronicle? Fully clothed, the old boy
was wading in the surf with his family. Someone
ought to tell him. "Ktusu Ga Nai JTo Ga ii Dosu."
English translation—"ltV. better with your shoes
off."
AFTER our Monday whif at the housing situation
at least the University Information office got busy.

Every San Fran newspaper beamed out with "Stan
ford Asks Vet Housing" . . . "Stanford Seeks Army
Hospital" . . . "Dibble Hospital Is Sought by Stan
ford for Student Homes."
As the good book says, "Seek and ye shall find."
ALTHOUGH our bookstore is out of texts lor
several courses one of our Psych Profs has the sit
uation licked. "Hey," he confided to his class, "I'll
bet that you can get the books up at the Cal book
store."
ONE of our newly returned friends wanted to
take Russian. He soon found that the timetable's
A-3 meant third term Russki and he had never had
(irst. How his study card could have been signed
is a mystery that only our advisor system can ex
plain.
CHAPARRAL-- the local gag rag will hit the
stands a week from today. Chappie tosses out a
funny paper issue this time. Complete from Smiling
Jerk to Little Annie Gooney.
The American Veterans' Committee (AVC) will
hold its second campus meeting tonight at 7:30.
Check in at the Nitery (right upstairs of the Cellar)
and :,ec what the boys have to say. All veterans and
their blonde girl friends are invited.
Well, this was a shortie and a quiet one today.

One of our boys found a corpse down at Santa
