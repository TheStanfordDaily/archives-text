# ON THE DISCS
## 
### 
Frim Fram Mess
Les Brown's latest contribution to
the platter parade is on a par with
his other recent releases — disap
pointing. Knowing the capabilities
of this group, it is criminal for Co
lumbia to issue such a disc as "Frim
Fram Sauce" and "In the Moon
Mist." Brown's aggregation has star
instrumentalists and good arrangers,
and why they are not put to better
use on record is a great mystery of
musiedom.
"Frim Fram" is made even more
of a novelty than thought possible
with Butch Stone half-talking, half
warbling the "lyrics." The reverse
is of a little higher quality because
of a Doris Day vocal. Doris was per
haps the most promising of all big
band vocalists until she decided to
leave Les for a movie contract. "In
the Moon Mist," a melody adapted
from a composition by Godard, also
highlights the moving tenor of Ted
Nash.
Holiday Fine, Decca Dense
Decca has issued another Billie
Holiday platter—a follow-up to her
recent success, "Lover Man." This
disc is not destined for the popu
larity that was received by its pred
ecessor, for neither side is up to the
Holiday standard, although she is
still superior to most band thrushes.
One detriment to the record is the
choice of tunes, "Yu'd Better Go
Now" and "No More."
The former has the better singing
of the two and also the beltei back
ing. Bob Haggart's pick-up group,
featuring Billy Butterfield and Will
Bradley, handles the accompani
ment. On the other sire "Lady Day"
has Toots Canumarata and his poor
man's Philharmonic doing the back
ground chores although it is more of
a chore for the listener than for
Toots. As Miss Holiday does her
best work with a small improvising
group, there is no reason why Decca
insists on using these overstuffed or
chestras for accompaniment. Come
on, Mr. Knapp, pel with it!
Herman Herd Slightly Slips
"It's Anybody's Spring" and "Wel
come to My Dream" are the titles of
Woody Herman's newest tunes on
wax. As you can see, the tunes are
like most of the tunes this week
which are disappointing, but the
Herd acquits itself admirably with
this mediocre material. "It's Any
body's Spring" is the belter-buy
side with a nice Woody vocal, an
other fine solo from the tenor of Flip
Phillips, and a few short bars from
Red Norvo. Some of the ensemble
work is good, but near the end of the
record when birds twecp denoting
spring, wo turn away in disgust and
shame. Woody, how could you?
The other side contains a Frances
Wayne vocal in her newly-found
affected manner. Her over-empha
sized note-bending does absolutely
nothing for us, and neither does it
help the band except for one fine
Bill Harris tram solo. In short, noth
ing happens on this side.
Incidentally, we caught the "Eb
ony Concerto" on the air the other
pi"ht. The concerto, as you prob
ably know, was written especially
for Woody by Stavinsky who
was inspired and impressed by the
cower and brilliance of the Herman
band. Although we remained unim
pressed, many of the longhair crit
ics were appreciative of the work.
They admired the precision and en

thusiasm displayed during the work,
and they seemed to admire the com
position, which to us was as weird as
a George Handy nightmare. It was,
however, an historic occasion for
Jazz, and it proves that Jazz is be
ginning to get the recognition it de
serves, although the work was as far
from being Jazz as Guy Lombardo.
And this brings us to the next item.
Sweetest Music This Side of?
Guy Lombardo has released four
new sides. Two of them contain vo
cals by Hild.ogarde, and one of the
tunes is "Onezy, Twozy." Well, what
do you want? A review?
Frankie Sings—But Good
The new Frankie Sinatra album
on Columbia is very welcome, con
taining many familar standards, and
of course, the Voice. Although Axel
Stordahl's arrangements are very
good, it seems to us that a few of
the sides should have been made
with a small accompanying group.
Probably Sinatra's best recent work,
"Lilvbelle," was made with a small
combo headed by Red Nichols, and
this type of group would have been
just as effective as the often times
heavy Stordahl scorings. The tunes,
of course, are wonderful, including
such favorites as "Those Foolish
Things," "Ghost of a Chance," "I
Don't Know Why," "You Go to My
Head," and four other equally
known melodies.
A Word to the Wise
Keep your eyes on the music
stores for the new Benny Goodman
Sextet album. The sextet is the
same that cut the amazing "I Got
Rhythm" a few months ago. It fea
tures Red Norvo, Mel Powell, and
Slam Stewart besides Mr. Clarinet
himself. Such tunes as "Ain't Mis
behavin'," "Just One of Those
Things," and Rachal's Dream" are
included in the set.
