# 'German Cities Ruined,' Johnson Says on Returm
## 
### 
Startling destruction and devas
tation in Germany and the indus
triousness of the Dutch were two
of the conditions particularly no
ticed by Willis H. Johnson, profes
sor of biology, during his recent
stay in Europe.
Mi. Johnson said it is impos
sible for Americans in the United
States to visuali/e the total de
struction of many of the German
towns. While acting as lecturer
and consultant in the small unit
schools set up by the Army in
Germany, Mr. Johnson had a
chance to see the American zone
in Germany.
A city with a population of about
250,000, Frankfurt, where ho vva;
staying, was HO per cent demolished.
Munich, Mannheim, and Wcisbaden
were in the same condition. '1 val
ue the opportunity highly of hav
ing been able to see the situation in
Germany. There is tremendous de
struction and the people are living
like rats. It. is not the way you 1 ik"
to see human beings live," said Mr.
Johnson.
He remarked that the German
people do resent the Americans, but
this is a natural feeling for a con
quered people to have toward vic
tors.
Concerning the American occu
pation of Germany, Mr. Johnson
said America may be doing the best
she can under the circumstances,
such as terrific shortages, but the
Army did wrong in removing the
men who fought the Germans and
replacing them with "green, inex
perienced boys. "It is my opinion
that history will show this was a
mistake," said Mr. Johnson.
Mr. Johnson spent the first six
months of his stay in Europe
teaching at Shrivenham Ameri
can University, set up by the
Army for American soldiers
overseas. The university accom
modated 4,000 students for each
eight-week term. The staff con
sisted of American university
professors representing 14!) Amer
ican institutions.
The staff was excellent and the
students were on the whole better
than the students the professors had
taught in America, according to
Mr. Johnson. The Army had estab
lished one other similar university
at Biarritz, France. Both universi
ties are now closed.
During December Mr. Johnson
was one of 16 professors from Shri
venham to be sent to the Nether

lands at the invitation of the Dutch
government. The Dutch universi
ties had been closed for four years
and the people were very enthu
siastic in reopening their educa
tional system. Since the Dutch
had been so completely cut off from
the world, the professors were
asked to lecture on what was going
on in America.
Mr. Johnson was most interested
and amazed at the ability of both
students and professors of th" Dutch
universities to speak and under
stand English. Mr. Johnson said
that although the Netherlands took
quite a beating and the people were
poor and ill fed. they are very in
dustrious. He also said they were
the most hospitable of any people
he encountered on the continent.
While abroad Mr. Johnson saw
several Stanford men. He saw
Professors Gode, and Goldhamer,
both from the Economics Depart
ment. In Germany he met Pro
fessor Ileffner, who was teaching
at the universitv at Hirritz. In
the Netherlands he saw Profes
sor Szetfo, former head of the

I Mathematics Department, who
i was also lecturing to the Dutch
Universities.
On his return trip Mr. Johnson
left from Le Havre. "This impor
tant harbor hasn't one dock or pier
1 left and the whole eity is leveled,"
said Mr. Johnson. The shipping is
now carried on from floating docks
I improvised by engineers.
Mr. Johnson will giv" an illus
trated talk on his stay in Germany
at the Biology Seminar on April 29.

replacing them with "green, inex
perienced boys. "It is my opinion
that history will show this was a
mistake," said Mr. Johnson.
Mr. Johnson spent the first six
months of his stay in Europe
teaching at Shrivenham Ameri
can University, set up by the
Army for American soldiers
overseas. The university accom
modated 4,000 students for each
eight-week term. The staff con
sisted of American university
professors representing 14!) Amer
ican institutions.
The staff was excellent and the
students were on the whole better
than the students the professors had
taught in America, according to
Mr. Johnson. The Army had estab
lished one other similar university
at Biarritz, France. Both universi
ties are now closed.
During December Mr. Johnson
was one of 16 professors from Shri
venham to be sent to the Nether

lands at the invitation of the Dutch
government. The Dutch universi
ties had been closed for four years
and the people were very enthu
siastic in reopening their educa
tional system. Since the Dutch
had been so completely cut off from
the world, the professors were
asked to lecture on what was going
on in America.
Mr. Johnson was most interested
and amazed at the ability of both
students and professors of th" Dutch
universities to speak and under
stand English. Mr. Johnson said
that although the Netherlands took
quite a beating and the people were
poor and ill fed. they are very in
dustrious. He also said they were
the most hospitable of any people
he encountered on the continent.
While abroad Mr. Johnson saw
several Stanford men. He saw
Professors Gode, and Goldhamer,
both from the Economics Depart
ment. In Germany he met Pro
fessor Ileffner, who was teaching
at the universitv at Hirritz. In
the Netherlands he saw Profes
sor Szetfo, former head of the

I Mathematics Department, who
i was also lecturing to the Dutch
Universities.
On his return trip Mr. Johnson
left from Le Havre. "This impor
tant harbor hasn't one dock or pier
1 left and the whole eity is leveled,"
said Mr. Johnson. The shipping is
now carried on from floating docks
I improvised by engineers.
Mr. Johnson will giv" an illus
trated talk on his stay in Germany
at the Biology Seminar on April 29.
Startling destruction and devas
tation in Germany and the indus
triousness of the Dutch were two
of the conditions particularly no
ticed by Willis H. Johnson, profes
sor of biology, during his recent
stay in Europe.
Mi. Johnson said it is impos
sible for Americans in the United
States to visuali/e the total de
struction of many of the German
towns. While acting as lecturer
and consultant in the small unit
schools set up by the Army in
Germany, Mr. Johnson had a
chance to see the American zone
in Germany.
A city with a population of about
250,000, Frankfurt, where ho vva;
staying, was HO per cent demolished.
Munich, Mannheim, and Wcisbaden
were in the same condition. '1 val
ue the opportunity highly of hav
ing been able to see the situation in
Germany. There is tremendous de
struction and the people are living
like rats. It. is not the way you 1 ik"
to see human beings live," said Mr.
Johnson.
He remarked that the German
people do resent the Americans, but
this is a natural feeling for a con
quered people to have toward vic
tors.
Concerning the American occu
pation of Germany, Mr. Johnson
said America may be doing the best
she can under the circumstances,
such as terrific shortages, but the
Army did wrong in removing the
men who fought the Germans and
replacing them with "green, inex
perienced boys. "It is my opinion
