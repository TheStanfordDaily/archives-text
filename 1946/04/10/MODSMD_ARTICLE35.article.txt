# Indian Nine Meets Santa Clara at 3
## McGraw Is Surprise Hill Nomination By Wolter; Ahlquist Will Backstop 
### 
By STU MILLAR
Stanford's horsehiders will tan
gle with the Santa Clara Broncos
at 3 p.m. today on the Sunken Dia
mond in an effort to win their first
game since the close of last quarter.
Roster Is Revamped
An almost totally different line
up than the one which started
against the two conference oppo
nents down south has been slated
for first-string action against the
Santa Clarans by Harry Wolter,
Farm baseball mentor.
The infield will be composed of
Lloyd Morriman on first, Bob Pe
ters on second, Ray Winterhalter at
short, and Tom Ward on third.
Three of these men didn't even
make the Los Angeles swing with
the team and the other, Peters, has
been shifted from his usual short
stop position.
In the outer gardens, the order
will remain fairly static. George
Sloat and Carl Kellenberger are
definite choices for the left and
center field spots respectively. Wol
ter hasn't picked between Don Ga
brielson, Jim Wickersham, and Earl
Boles for the right meadow job.
Hurler Mac Predicts Victory
Behind the plate will be Dick
Ahlquist, who is at home as a
backstop and outfielder. And com- j
pleting the battery is Penguin Mc-
Graw, who has tired of his former
catching job and wants to try his
hand on the mound. McGraw, con
fident ol victory, has stated for pub
lication that he will "win the game j
on control."
Just in case Mac can't go the
route, Wolter will have Larry Wolf
and Lefty Palisoul in the bull-pen.
As lor the rest of the Card hurling
staff . . . well. Dick Flatland is

I still under doctor's orders and
won't be around for at least a
few more days. Lloyd Mac-Govern
winces when he plays catch. And
Phil Wolfe, the stalwart of the
| staff, has a sore flipper.
Millcry Finally Returned
Besides this, Wolter is fairly hap
ipy about everything. Yesterday
j was the first one in which everyone
! who was on the traveling squad
J was either out for practice or ac
' counted for. Morg Miller, who reg
j istered late, worked out on the in-
I itial sack.
About Santa Clara the latest
word is that they come equipped
with a slugging first baseman. His
name is Kelly and he bats from the
j left side of the plate. He played in
; the Esquire Ail - American ball
j game last year, making the third of
| this species that the Injuns have
faced this year. If he makes as
| much trouble as his ex-teammates,
I Shramka and Granitz of S.F.U.,
then Wolter will have cause for
grief.
''Kelly's" Top Howard's
In preparation for today's tussle,
Wolter scheduled a five - inning
practice contest for yesterday's
workout. The score at the end of
the five frames was reputedly 9
to 5 in favor of "Kelly" Kellenber
ger s squad, but at press time it
was learned that tough Tom How
ard, leader of the losing nine, was 1
wiling a protest to Happy Chan
dler.
About the season so far, the team
is a little disappointed. They lost
two extremely tough ones that
could just as easily have gone the I
other way. As the record stands
now, they have won two and drop
ped five.

nents down south has been slated
for first-string action against the
Santa Clarans by Harry Wolter,
Farm baseball mentor.
The infield will be composed of
Lloyd Morriman on first, Bob Pe
ters on second, Ray Winterhalter at
short, and Tom Ward on third.
Three of these men didn't even
make the Los Angeles swing with
the team and the other, Peters, has
been shifted from his usual short
stop position.
In the outer gardens, the order
will remain fairly static. George
Sloat and Carl Kellenberger are
definite choices for the left and
center field spots respectively. Wol
ter hasn't picked between Don Ga
brielson, Jim Wickersham, and Earl
Boles for the right meadow job.
Hurler Mac Predicts Victory
Behind the plate will be Dick
Ahlquist, who is at home as a
backstop and outfielder. And com- j
pleting the battery is Penguin Mc-
Graw, who has tired of his former
catching job and wants to try his
hand on the mound. McGraw, con
fident ol victory, has stated for pub
lication that he will "win the game j
on control."
Just in case Mac can't go the
route, Wolter will have Larry Wolf
and Lefty Palisoul in the bull-pen.
As lor the rest of the Card hurling
staff . . . well. Dick Flatland is

I still under doctor's orders and
won't be around for at least a
few more days. Lloyd Mac-Govern
winces when he plays catch. And
Phil Wolfe, the stalwart of the
| staff, has a sore flipper.
Millcry Finally Returned
Besides this, Wolter is fairly hap
ipy about everything. Yesterday
j was the first one in which everyone
! who was on the traveling squad
J was either out for practice or ac
' counted for. Morg Miller, who reg
j istered late, worked out on the in-
I itial sack.
About Santa Clara the latest
word is that they come equipped
with a slugging first baseman. His
name is Kelly and he bats from the
j left side of the plate. He played in
; the Esquire Ail - American ball
j game last year, making the third of
| this species that the Injuns have
faced this year. If he makes as
| much trouble as his ex-teammates,
I Shramka and Granitz of S.F.U.,
then Wolter will have cause for
grief.
''Kelly's" Top Howard's
In preparation for today's tussle,
Wolter scheduled a five - inning
practice contest for yesterday's
workout. The score at the end of
the five frames was reputedly 9
to 5 in favor of "Kelly" Kellenber
ger s squad, but at press time it
was learned that tough Tom How
ard, leader of the losing nine, was 1
wiling a protest to Happy Chan
dler.
About the season so far, the team
is a little disappointed. They lost
two extremely tough ones that
could just as easily have gone the I
other way. As the record stands
now, they have won two and drop
ped five.
