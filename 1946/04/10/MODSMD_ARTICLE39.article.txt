A double appearance is made by
Stanford athletic warriors today.
Harry Wolters' baseball nine plays
host to the Santa Clara diamond-
I eers in the Sunken Diamond. The
| Broncos also bring along their ten
nis team to play the Farm court
i men on the Stanford courts. Take
! your choice, today. You're welcome
j at either event.
It the men who throw the
stitched apricot around could
overcome their "jittery-itis," the
i club has fine prospects of finish
ing high this year. The pitching
staff has — on the whole — come
through with line performances:
the hitting cannot be complained
about. Only the fielding remains
to be solved.

One of the Stanford grads who
has made a name for himself in
the coaching world is Dud DeGroot,
current mentor of the Los Angeles
entry in the new American grid
•loop.
He played All-American football
in the late '20's, besides earning a
Phi Beta Kappa key; being regi
mental head of the R.O.T.C. unit;
having the job of student manager;
and nlso being in the glee club.
After he received his sheep
skin from the campus, he went
to San Jose State as football
coach. From there lie moved to
Rochester University, where he
turned ,out some of the finest
football teams in the country in
the smaller school brackets.
From college gridiron coaching
Dud turned to pro play, and was
appointed coach of the Washington
Redsk ins.
Then came the chance to head
the Los Angeles Dons, and he
grabbed the chance to leave the
Washington laundryman, George
Preston Marshall, and his capital
city Redskins.
DeGroot, who is considered one

of the "brainiest" coaches in the
business, disliked Marshall's habit
of coming to the bench and telling
Dud how to direct football strategy.
With Slip Madigan as general
manager of the Los Angeles team,
some people wonder if he won't
have the same trouble there. But
Madigan has stated that he plans
on running the club strictly from
the front office, and that the for
mer Stanford Indian will have
complete charge on the playing
field.

Sports scribes are so generous.
The current magnanimity of some
Bay Area scribblers is extended to
Marchie Schwartz, football coach,
in picking out the starting backfield
i for the Red and White next season.
One writer has chosen Jack Bron
son at quarterback; Lloyd Merri
man and Don Zappatini at half
back; and Billy Agnew at fullback.
That's a fine backfield, but there
I are a few grey hairs on that selec
tion.
First, Don Zappatini is not regis
tered at school now, and the best
; that can be said is that we hope he
will be back in time for football
I next fall. Second, the eligibility
status of Billy Agnew is not known
yet. Billy played a few games for
| Cal last fall, but wasn't registered
at the Blue and Gold plant as a
student. His eligibility will be de
cided by conference officials.
Another backfield combination
chosen by a writer we ran across
was Jackie Bronson at quarterback;
Gene Martin and Lloyd Merriman
at hallback posts; and Billy Agnew
at fullback. That also is a very fine
combination, but it's pretty hard at
such an early date to start picking
starting teams for next fall.
Some hidden material might be
uncorked at practice sessions; some
more men might return from the
aimed services. Any combination of
factors might influence the selec
tion of a starting Indian eleven.
