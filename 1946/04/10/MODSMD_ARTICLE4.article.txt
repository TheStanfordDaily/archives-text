# Committee OK's Draft Extension
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 9 (UP).â€”
The House Military Affairs Com
mittee today approved legislation
extending the draft in limited form
for nine months to Feb. 15, 1947,
with induction of fathers and essen
tial farm workers specifically pro
hibited.
The compromise measure, ex
pected to come before the full
House by Friday, was adopted
after the committee voted down
an amendment to keep conscrip
tion on the books for a full year
but suspending inductions until
Dec. 15 pending the outcome of
a volunteer enlistment drive.
Committee Cnairman Andrew J.
May, D., Ky., said a provision to
boost Army-Navy pay as a spur to
recruiting also was rejected but
that he hoped to have a pay raise
measure ready for consideration
before the weekend.
The measure provides that all
men who have served IK mouths
would be discharged and that fu
ture inductions would be limited
to IS months; bans conscription
of fathers and essential farm
workers; and forbids the Army
and Navy to induct more men
than necessary to fill specific
quotas fixed in the bill.
The committee set the quota for
the Army at 1,070,000 men for July
1, 1946, for the Navy at 558,000, and
the Marine Corps at 108,000.
