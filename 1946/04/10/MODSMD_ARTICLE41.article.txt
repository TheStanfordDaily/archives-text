# League Ends In Geneva
## 
### 
GENEVA. April 9 (UP).â€”China
expressed concern tonight over the
future of American-held Japanese
islands in the Pacific shortly after
the Union ef South Africa also raised
a mandate problem during the final
sessions of the League of Nations.
The Chinese representative, Dr.
Lone Liang, recommended to the
general questions committee of the
league assembly that, following the
dissolution of the league mandates
commission, the mandatory powers
and those administering former ene
my-mandated territories submit an
nual reports to the United Nations
and "submit to inspection by the
United Nations until the trusteeship
council is constituted."
The reference to former enemy
mandated territories was believed
to be pointed to the interest shown
by the United States in the Maria
nas, Marshall, and Carolina Islands.
Earlier, the head of the South Af
rican delegation had told the assem
bly that the Union of South Africa
intended to ask the United Nations
assembly for permission to adminis
ter mandated German Southwest Af
rica as an integral part of the union.
"Meanwhile, the Union will super
vise the mandate as il has in the last
six years." the delegate, Lief Ege
land, told the assembly.
The Argentine delegation which
walked out on yesterday's opening
session when it failed to secure a
vice-presidential post still remained
in self-imposed seclusion. The dele
gates did not attend the morning as
sembly session or the afternoon com
mittee meetings but remained in
their hotel rooms. They refused to
receive the press.
It was pointed out. however, that
even if the delegation should re
main absent during the entire ses
sion it will not alter Argentina's
membership in the league or its ob
ligation thereto. Withdrawal re
quires notice in writing and the res
ignation does not go into effect until
two years later.
