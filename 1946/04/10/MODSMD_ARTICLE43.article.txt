# Stanford Netters To Meet Broncos
## Varsity Tennis Team Seeks Second Triumph in Matches This Afternoon 
### 
Seeking number two scalp in in
tercollegiate competition, the local
Stanford tennis squad clash with
the visiting racqueteers from Santa
Clara today. Emerging from a close
victory over the Tigers from Col
lege of the Pacific, the Redmen will
try to duplicate this feat likewise
on the Broncos.
Little is known of the potentiali
ties of the invading netmen, but
info via the grapevine has it that
they will present plenty of opposi
tion for the Indian netmen.
Leading the Indian power pa
rade will be smooth stroking Ar
nold Biesser, who lived up to ad
vance notices by handily taking
bis initial encounter la&t week.
Hiesser promises to be one of the
main stalwarts of this year's
squad. Rob Rutledge, also win
ner in his first out. will hold
down the second slot for the lo
cals to give the squad a solid
front line.
Captain Dave Basham will tee
off, on the tennis court that is, in
the third position.
Eourth singles will probably be
filled by Grover Miller. Though

Miller dropped his match last
week, be could show real im
provement. Heath Schrocder, who
has quite a reputation falling upon
him because of the prowess of
his brother Ted, former national
champ, will stroke his shots from
position number 5. Filling up the
lower brackets for the Cards will
be Gene Corman in all proba
bility.
Basham and Rutledge will make
up the first Stanford doubles combo.
