# French Take U.S. Proposal

LONDON, April 9 (UP). â€”France
I accepted United States Secretary of
1 State James F. Byrnes' proposal to
| day that the Big Four's Foreign
i Ministers meet in Paris on April 25,
insuring that the meeting will be
| held. Almost simultaneously a Brit
ish Foreign Office spokesman indi
cated that his nation would press
for the conclusion of an Italian
j treaty before all else.
France is principally interested
j in disposing of its Ruhr, Rhineland.
; and Saar problems. It wants those
i areas, to all practical purposes, scp
. arated from Germany, a move to
which Britain is firmly opposed.
France was the last formally to
announce that it had accepted
United States Secretary of State
1 James F. Byrnes' proposal that
Foreign Ministers of the Big Four
j meet in an effort to settle peace
treaties with former Axis satellites
Italy, Finland, Rumania, Hungary,
! and Bulgaria. Russia accepted last
night.
There was little optimism in Brit
| ish foreign circles that the confer
| encc could bring a speedy recon
i ciliation of Soviet, British, and
American views on Italian and Bal
. kan treaties. British Foreign Office
! sourccs said it seemed impossible
that the peace conference could
convene on May 1, the date set by
j Foreign Ministers of the Big Three
in the Moscow agreement.
The primary tasks of the Foreign
Ministers when they meet will be
reconciliation of divergent views
| on: Italian reparations; the future
lof Italy's colonics; the Yugoslav-
Italian border in the Vcnczia Giu
i lia area, and the character of gov
ernments in ex - enemy Balkan
states, particularly Bulgaria.
