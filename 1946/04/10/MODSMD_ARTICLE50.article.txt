### 
The last Concert Series program
j of the year will be held on May 23,
announced Jo Glasson, Concert Se
j ries manager. The program, a con
j cert by Metropolitan Opera star
Rise Stevens, was originally planned
j for a few days earlier, but since
' Miss Stevens has an engagement, in

Memphis, Tenn., on May 20, a new
date had to be arranged.
June (5, in dead week, had been
considered as well as several
other dates, but it was decided to
have the program as soon as it
would be possible for her to reach
the West Coast.
Dr. H. Jan Popper, on leave of
absence from his music teaching
program at Stanford for this quar
ter, was to have been accompanist
for Miss Stevens on her West Coast
tour which will start vVith her -con

enough time for them to practice
together between the Memphis en
gagement and the Stanford pro

be accompanied by her Eastern
pianist.
Miss Glasson said that there are
still a few balcony tickets on sale
in the Concert Scries office. The
tickets sell for $1.20 and SI.BO.
The office is open every afternoon
