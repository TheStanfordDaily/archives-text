## 
### 
George Brunn, John V. Croul,
Robert E. Peck, and Jack Wallace
have been nominated to fill the va
cancy as second men's Row repre
sentative on Excom, Election Board j
Chairman Carl Burke announced {
yesterday.
Any declinations may be made
this morning between 8 and 12 in
the ballot box at the History cor
ner. The election will be held to
morrow from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the
Engineering corner only. All 833 i
men in the 24 President halls in
cluding Tamarack may vote.
The elected representative will
fill the place of Fred Bremenkamp,
who has left school. Bremenkamp
was elected last spring to represent j
the now-vacant Sequoia Hall, which |
he technically represented during j
his term.
"Because of increased men's reg
istration, however, it was felt that
a second men's Row representative
was needed," Burke said. "This is
particularly true of the great num
ber of veterans living on the Row
who, as yet have little contact with
Excom."
The other men's Row representa
tive on Excom is Frank deLislc.
