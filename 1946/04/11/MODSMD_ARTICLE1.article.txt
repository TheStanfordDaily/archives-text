# Senate Committee Votes Atomic Energy Control to Civilians
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 10 (UP).—The Senate Atomic Energy
Committee today voted tentative approval of a bill entrusting
top control over the cosmic force to a five-man civilian commis
sion and providing harsh fines and jail sentences for viola
tions of atomic security.
The committee endorsed the far-reaching control bill unani
mously, but delayed sending it to the Senate floor pending a
last-minute review of its provisions at a final hearing tomorrow.
Chairman Brien McMahon (D., Conn.) indicated that no
changes were expected in the present 'version and he told
newsmen he believed final agreement had been reached.
The committe solved the knotty problem of military juris

diction by authorizing appointment of a military liaison com
mittee to work with the civilian commission on matters affect
ing the national defense. Where their views clash, the mili
tary experts could appeal through the secretaries of War or
Navy to the President for a final decision.
The bill, drafted after months of exhaustive study and com
mittee hearings in which the nation's top scientists partici
pated, would create a five-man civilian commission, appointed
by the President for five-year terms, with control over virtually
all phases of atomic activity.
Commission powers would include the ownership of facili
ties for producing uranium and plutonium and control of the

energy's application through licensing.
The measure also provides for a joint 18-man congressional
committee on atomic energy—nine each from the Senate and
House—to study the work of the commission. In addition, it
would create a special board of technical experts to serve in
an advisory capacity.
The security regulations written into the bill authorize fines
of $20,000 and 20 year jail sentences for persons divulging
atomic secrets with the intention of injuring the United States
or aiding a foreign power.
Lesser penalties are provided for violations of the commis
sions security regulations. It was said the bill would not inter

fere with a normal exchange of technical data amoncj scientists.
McMahon revealed that the civilian commission would be
granted these powers under his bill:
I.—Ownership of all fissionable materials, with authority
to grant supplies to reserch centers and for other purposes
through a licensing system.
2. —Exclusive ownership of facilities for producing fission
able materials.
3.—Hold all patents on processing involving the use of
atomic energy or the production of fissionable materials.
4. —Conduct research and development activities in the
atomic field.

4. —Conduct research and development activities in the
atomic field.
WASHINGTON, April 10 (UP).—The Senate Atomic Energy
Committee today voted tentative approval of a bill entrusting
top control over the cosmic force to a five-man civilian commis
sion and providing harsh fines and jail sentences for viola
tions of atomic security.
The committee endorsed the far-reaching control bill unani
mously, but delayed sending it to the Senate floor pending a
last-minute review of its provisions at a final hearing tomorrow.
Chairman Brien McMahon (D., Conn.) indicated that no
changes were expected in the present 'version and he told
newsmen he believed final agreement had been reached.
The committe solved the knotty problem of military juris

diction by authorizing appointment of a military liaison com
mittee to work with the civilian commission on matters affect
ing the national defense. Where their views clash, the mili
tary experts could appeal through the secretaries of War or
Navy to the President for a final decision.
The bill, drafted after months of exhaustive study and com
mittee hearings in which the nation's top scientists partici
pated, would create a five-man civilian commission, appointed
by the President for five-year terms, with control over virtually
all phases of atomic activity.
Commission powers would include the ownership of facili
ties for producing uranium and plutonium and control of the

energy's application through licensing.
The measure also provides for a joint 18-man congressional
committee on atomic energy—nine each from the Senate and
House—to study the work of the commission. In addition, it
would create a special board of technical experts to serve in
an advisory capacity.
The security regulations written into the bill authorize fines
of $20,000 and 20 year jail sentences for persons divulging
atomic secrets with the intention of injuring the United States
or aiding a foreign power.
Lesser penalties are provided for violations of the commis
sions security regulations. It was said the bill would not inter

fere with a normal exchange of technical data amoncj scientists.
McMahon revealed that the civilian commission would be
granted these powers under his bill:
I.—Ownership of all fissionable materials, with authority
to grant supplies to reserch centers and for other purposes
through a licensing system.
2. —Exclusive ownership of facilities for producing fission
able materials.
3.—Hold all patents on processing involving the use of
atomic energy or the production of fissionable materials.
4. —Conduct research and development activities in the
atomic field.
