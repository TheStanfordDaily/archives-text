# Something New--in the Sun, in the Rain
## 
### 
Playminded Injun maids can take their
choice of lengths this spring!
And the choice ranges, moving up.
from slacks, sailing pants, clam-diggers,
and knickerbockers to pedal pushers,
long shorts, and just plain shorts!
These are all designed to prevent the

eternal rolled up pants but Stanford
women cling to jeans and huge men's
shirts with a persistence that is amazing.
They are the correct attire ior bridge
playing, furtive trips to the P. 0., and
Saturday breakfast as well as bicycling,
Boathouse squatting and dance decorat
ing.
Sailing pants and knickerbockers are
the latest wrinkle. These fit the ankle
and knee respectively and avoid the
droopy look so common in jeans.
Pedal pushers have been dressed up
with matching highnecked tops and bare
midriffs, created in linen and cottons as
well as the darker, heavier materials.
Corduroy shorts in riot colors are
new, so are butch 'shorts, straight and
to the point, like the mens favorite
swimming trunks.
And to top it off broad studded baits,
providing the tucked-in look, sleeveless
sweaters, gay blouses, and our Stanford
"T" shirts are popular.
It's the long lean neat look that's fash
ion right for playtime, but don't look
now! There go the dirty jeans and plaid
shirt.

Since March didn't go out like the
proverbial lamb, and April hasn't yet
been all sunshine and good-tanning
weather, co-eds have been appearing in
rain clothes, porkies cocked at pre
carious angles to cover the "pomp" or
bangs in front while the serviceable
bandana trails in back, bright raincoats,
black or yellow fishermen hats, and
boots, boots, boots. To top it all, this
cold-preventing, weather-protecting ap
parel looks chic.
A few years ago girls would dread
the rainy days because they had to don
the unflattering, ill-fitting raincoats, all
in dull tans or blacks. But now rain
coats are so feminine and good-looking
that girls wear them at the slightest hint
of dark clouds in the sky. Most of the
raincoats are water-repellent rather than
waterproof. They are made of tightly
woven material that has been treated
chemically to repel water. Some of the
most popular materials are satin, poplin,
garbardine, twill, nylon, and taffeta.
Headgear is very important in rainy
weather because women are always

concerned in keeping their hair dry and
curly. The bandana still holds its own
as a last minute resort on a rainy day,
but it is being replaced by the fisher
men hats, hoods attached to the rain
coat, bandana and pork-pie combination,
and the new. water-repellent protectors
made to match the raincoat. These new
hats not only cover the long bobs in
back but they have a visor in front to
keep the entire head dry. Fishermen
hats seen frequently on campus can be
worn with or without the bandana. The
hair can be tucked in and when the chin
strap is fastened the hair is safe from
curl destruction in the wettest of
weather.
Since women should be completely
protected lrom head to foot, fashionable
boots sprang up into the world of rain
wear just before the war and have
proven so practical that they will al
ways be an essential part of the co
ed's vnter wardrobe. Wooden shoes
are worn by some to protect their feet
from the rain and these wooden won
ders can plow through almost any pud
dle and keep the wearer dry.

Playminded Injun maids can take their
choice of lengths this spring!
And the choice ranges, moving up.
from slacks, sailing pants, clam-diggers,
and knickerbockers to pedal pushers,
long shorts, and just plain shorts!
These are all designed to prevent the

eternal rolled up pants but Stanford
women cling to jeans and huge men's
shirts with a persistence that is amazing.
They are the correct attire ior bridge
playing, furtive trips to the P. 0., and
Saturday breakfast as well as bicycling,
Boathouse squatting and dance decorat
ing.
Sailing pants and knickerbockers are
the latest wrinkle. These fit the ankle
and knee respectively and avoid the
droopy look so common in jeans.
Pedal pushers have been dressed up
with matching highnecked tops and bare
midriffs, created in linen and cottons as
well as the darker, heavier materials.
Corduroy shorts in riot colors are
new, so are butch 'shorts, straight and
to the point, like the mens favorite
swimming trunks.
And to top it off broad studded baits,
providing the tucked-in look, sleeveless
sweaters, gay blouses, and our Stanford
"T" shirts are popular.
It's the long lean neat look that's fash
ion right for playtime, but don't look
now! There go the dirty jeans and plaid
shirt.

Since March didn't go out like the
proverbial lamb, and April hasn't yet
been all sunshine and good-tanning
weather, co-eds have been appearing in
rain clothes, porkies cocked at pre
carious angles to cover the "pomp" or
bangs in front while the serviceable
bandana trails in back, bright raincoats,
black or yellow fishermen hats, and
boots, boots, boots. To top it all, this
cold-preventing, weather-protecting ap
parel looks chic.
A few years ago girls would dread
the rainy days because they had to don
the unflattering, ill-fitting raincoats, all
in dull tans or blacks. But now rain
coats are so feminine and good-looking
that girls wear them at the slightest hint
of dark clouds in the sky. Most of the
raincoats are water-repellent rather than
waterproof. They are made of tightly
woven material that has been treated
chemically to repel water. Some of the
most popular materials are satin, poplin,
garbardine, twill, nylon, and taffeta.
Headgear is very important in rainy
weather because women are always

concerned in keeping their hair dry and
curly. The bandana still holds its own
as a last minute resort on a rainy day,
but it is being replaced by the fisher
men hats, hoods attached to the rain
