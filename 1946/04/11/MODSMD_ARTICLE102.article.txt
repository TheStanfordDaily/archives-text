# Jivers Wear Torrid Togs
## 
### ECKSTEIN FRANKLEY 
Feminine Farm fashions seem to be
the keynote of this edition, but we
haven't forgotten the men! Although
men's fashions haven't changed much
since the death of Solomon Levi, there
is something to be said about them. Nat
urally the Stanford "Rough" is careful
about his grooming even if he has to
shave more than once a week.
The favorite masculine apparel is the
sweater, open shirt, and levis. There
are many conventional rules regarding
this wear, however. The sweaters, as
a rule, are red or cardinal as you may
prefer. Many unenlightened Indians
have been seen wandering the campus
wearing a yellow sweater with blue
pants. Oh, the shame of it! The levis
(what is the plural of levi?) should be
worn with a turned-up cuff of not lass
than IV2 inches and not more than 4
inches. This is not one of Mrs. Stan
ford's ruler, but merely adopted custom.
Of course, many men prefer cords to
Levis, because thoy show the dirt more.
Another favorite garment is the re
versible Stanford jacket. This is quite
handy for a Stanford man who does not
like to change clothes or does not have
a large wardrobe. Between classes the
jacket is reversed, and the wearer feeis
like a new man.
Rooter's caps should only be worn at
intercollegiate encounters. These also
are reversible, and they come in two
colors. White and red,, and red and
white. If pants could be made reversi
ble, it would be a great boon to man
kind.
Shoes are usually worn, especially on
Quad. The favorite footwear for the
male homo sapian biped seems to be
saddle shoes. These should never be
worn new, and they should never ap
pear white. The proper way to break
these in is to use them only at night
around Rossatti's creek bed. Mocca
sins are also worn by the "roughs" as
they are very easp to put on in the
morning. They are not quite as color
ful, but they are very practical.
Men's fashions, except for an occa
sional Navy blue uniform, are the same
on campus as they have been for the
last several years. However, even with
the trend to simplicity, Roos Brothers
and Phelps Terkel are still in business.
