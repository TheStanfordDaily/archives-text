# Traffic Violations Down
## 
### 
Gordon Davis, chief of the Stan
ford police department, commented
today that the number of traffic
violations continued its downward
trend, although it was too early to
make a comparison with other
quarters.
"Most of the offenses are park
ing violations. Students who are
late and can't find a space often
just take a chance and stop in a no
parking zone." he said.
Davi.s suggested that the parking
situation could be alleviated it
those who lived near the Quad
would take into consideration the
students living off-campus.
"There arc more cars on the
campus this quarter than at any
other time in the history of the
school, and it would certainly ease
parking congestion if those who did
not have to use cars, left them at
their residences."

Davis revealed that traffic viola
tions were fewer last quarter than
the quarter before, and said that he
hoped that, this decline in offenses
continued.
"It is not to our liking to give
out citations," he continued. "If ev
eryone co-operated and drove like
they should we would not have to
issue any—which is a situation I
would certainly like to see."
The chief pointed out that there
was a limit to the number of cars
that could lie parked around the
Quad and noted that off-campus
students who absolutely have to
drive to school should be given first
consideration.
"However," he concluded, "it is
still a first come, first served situa
tion, but it would help matters in
no small degree if more students,
who could, walked to the Quad."
