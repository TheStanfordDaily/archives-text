# Japanese Women Flock to Polls in First Ballot; Emergency Housing Bill to Ease Shortages
## Vote for Diet Seats Exceeds Expectations BULLETIN 
### 
TOKYO, Thursday, April !1
(UP). — Japanese Communists,
considered weakest in pre-elec
tion estimates of party strength,
emerged as dark horses today as
Japanese authorities began count
ing votes of yesterday's elections
to determine winners of 460 seats
in the new Diet.
TOKYO, April 10 (UP).—Japa
nese women, voting for the first
time, went to the polls in unex
pectedly large numbers today in
the empire's first postwar elections
for members of the Japanese par
liament.
Nearly half of the 21,000.000 eli
gible women voters had flocked to
the polls by noon, many carrying
babies in slings on their backs.
Amazed U.S. Army poll-watching
teams estimated that from 60 to 70
per cent would vote before the polls
closed. Pre-election estimates were
that only 30 to 40 per cent would
exercise their new right.
Kyodo News Agency estimated
that between 65 and 70 per cent of
the total electorate had cast their
votes by 2 p.m.
No Violence
Balloting for 46 members of the
new Diet began at 7 a.m. There
were no reports of violence. Polling
places were set up in schools and
ward offices. Government offices,
schools, and banks wore closed.
Railroads suspended their rush
hour restrictions to bring the voters
out early.
The eligible women voters out
numbered the 1.9,000,000 eligible
men. There was a total of 2,782
candidates for the 466 Diet seats,
including two Buddhist nuns and a
Buddhist priest. Eighty-two women
sought office.
Smallpox and typhus quarantine
of some 3,000 families in Tokyo pre
vented between 8,000 and 10,000
voters from going to the polls.
An odd twist was added to the
election when headquarters of the
Japanese Communist party an
nounced it had received an un
signed note from the "Japanese
Farmers' Suicide Party" saying its
men would arrive in Tokyo next
Sunday at 2 p.m. to "annihilate
all Communists who have made
trouble for Japan." The postscript
added that "Due to transportation
difficulties wc may be a little late."
Most of the candidates were po
litical unknowns, since nearly all of
the prominent politicians have been
blacklisted for having been activc
in the war. The Liberal party was
expected to win 144 of the 466 seats
and have a majority by joining with
the Progressives. Only six Com
munists were expected to win.
