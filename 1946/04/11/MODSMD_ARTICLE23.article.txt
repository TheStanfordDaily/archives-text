-9
istration efforts to put price ceilings
on existing homes and building
lots.

proved a provision granting Hous
ing Expediter Wilson W. Wyatt
$600,000,000 for subsidies to pro
ducers of scarce building materials.

anteed market for prefabricated

ceiling prices on building materials;

erans' housing; and to regulate -or,
if necessary, forbid, export of lum

abroad.

50,000 prefabricated houses to ~<'ll
at an average factory price of $4,000
each. He hopes that 250/100 ready
made homes will be turned out this
year and GOO.OOO in 1947.
