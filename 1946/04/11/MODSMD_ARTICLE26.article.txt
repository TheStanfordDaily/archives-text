Editor, The Daily:
There seems to be an undue amount of commotion
caused by Stanford women on the subject of the
relative decrease in the numberd of women admit
ted by colleges, and the tightening of standards for
those already in college.
Approximately 75 per cent of the male college
students are veterans, whose main object in re
(t"' t'nt; to school is to prepare themselves for en
t . . ■ into the business or professional world.
Probably not more than half of the women stu
dents are studying with any definite idea of fol
lowing a business or professional career upon
graduation.
I 1 il any wonder then that colleges and universi

ties throughout the codntry prefer to admit vet
erans, whose education will be of prtictical value to
them throughout their entire life, than to accept
women students, when only a small percentage of
this group will have any practical use for their edu
cation ten or twenty years after graduation?
Evan T. Pugh
(Editorial note: Concerning admittance require
ments to Stanford, we agree with Mr. Pugh that
they cannot be considered discriminatory. As ex
plained in yesterday's editorial, "Ever Since Eve,"
The Daily feels that the national Y.W.C.A. conven
tion took a negative stand; the question is not of
discrimination. If women are capable in any field,
chances are that they'll get the recognition they
deserve.)
