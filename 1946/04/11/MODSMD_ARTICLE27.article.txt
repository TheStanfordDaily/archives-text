As a member in good standing of the "June Bugs,"
the official June Allyson Fan Club we take excep
tion to the Harvard Lampoon's including pert, pout
ing, petite Miss Allyson among movieland's
"worsts."
ll' any of you would care to join the "June Bugs"
he : uiv to contact us or write to our club president,
Mi: - Gwen Littlefield. Although we are the campus
repr. cn'.ative for the June Allyson Fan Club, you
may deal directly with Gwcn if you mention our
name. 112
We were just another soldier last spring sitting in
a Red Cross Club in Namur, Belgium, when we
happened upon a little note in a movie magazine
which changed the course of our life.
We quote from this article:
"r.Jimi Black, Baltimore, Md.. writes in: HOW
CAN I JOIN A JUNE ALLYSON CLUB? An
swer: Easy! Just drop a note to Gwen Littlefield
!')!)() Shermourne Dr., L.A., Calif. Dues are 75c
(Si this year), and you get pix, snaps, club news
and everything (that's a broad statement). June
nr.f Gwen areg reat friends, and it's one of the
li'-T.t clubs out (out where?)."
That very night we went back to our fox hole and
"dropped a note" to Gwen. And she caught it.
We began getting pix, snaps, club news, and every
thing (they really mean that). Also included in our
fir t consignment was our official membership card,
signed by the honorary president, (and founder
probably), Junie herself.
They can say all they want, to about the USO
shows, letters from home, Red Cross coffee and
doughnuts and continental ladies keeping up the
hoys' morale,'but it was our club neWs that kept
the vpark of civilization and humanity glowing in
oar warrior's breast.
In the latest issue of "June's Journal," the "Bugs"
house organ, we are planning on having a distinc
tive pin for each member to wear, "so that we can

recognize fellow fans and organize theater and
skating parties."
And they gave us a long list of "pen pals" with
v/hich to correspond. We've picked out Diego Man
gawang, 1442 Wieland St. Chicago 10, 111., whose
hobbies are: "taking care of cousins and children,
solving mysteries and crimes, and joining fan clubs."
Incidentally the J.A.F.C. is a member of the As
sociated Fan Clubs of America, the Modern Screen
Fan Club Association, and possibly the N.A.M.
Junie didn't have a very good part in her last
picture so Gwen has suggested that we all write in
to Mr. Louie B. Mayer, care M.G.M., Culver City,
Calif., and tell him to give our girl better parts.
In a personal (mimeographed) letter to all her
admirers, Junie tells us that she is now working on
"Till the Clouds Roll By," the life story of Jerome
Kern. We can hardly wait. Can you?
In our April edition of "June's Journal" they list
a whole page of questions and answers from our
girl. Samples:
Q. What is your favorite form of relaxation?
A. Loafing.
Q. When are you happiest?
A. When I am with Richard (Dick Powell, her
husband and the Lon Chaney of the modern screen.)
Q. What rumor has bothered you most?
A. The one about me and Robert Walker feud
ing. Why, that's absurd. We're the bese of friends.
Q. What is your favorite type of reading?
A. Scientific books and poetry.
Q. Do you do much reading?
A. No.
* * *
Q. Men of the Lampoon, did we of the J.A.F.C.
band together and vote you the "worst" of the col
lege humor magazines?
A. No.
Then in all fairness why don't you admit that
our Janie is not the "worst" actress in Hollywood.
She is merely one of the worst.

A. No.

Q. Men of the Lampoon, did we of the J.A.F.C.
band together and vote you the "worst" of the col
lege humor magazines?
A. No.
Then in all fairness why don't you admit that
our Janie is not the "worst" actress in Hollywood.
She is merely one of the worst.
As a member in good standing of the "June Bugs,"
the official June Allyson Fan Club we take excep
tion to the Harvard Lampoon's including pert, pout
ing, petite Miss Allyson among movieland's
"worsts."
ll' any of you would care to join the "June Bugs"
he : uiv to contact us or write to our club president,
Mi: - Gwen Littlefield. Although we are the campus
repr. cn'.ative for the June Allyson Fan Club, you
may deal directly with Gwcn if you mention our
name. 112
We were just another soldier last spring sitting in
a Red Cross Club in Namur, Belgium, when we
happened upon a little note in a movie magazine
which changed the course of our life.
We quote from this article:
"r.Jimi Black, Baltimore, Md.. writes in: HOW
CAN I JOIN A JUNE ALLYSON CLUB? An
swer: Easy! Just drop a note to Gwen Littlefield
!')!)() Shermourne Dr., L.A., Calif. Dues are 75c
(Si this year), and you get pix, snaps, club news
and everything (that's a broad statement). June
nr.f Gwen areg reat friends, and it's one of the
li'-T.t clubs out (out where?)."
That very night we went back to our fox hole and
"dropped a note" to Gwen. And she caught it.
We began getting pix, snaps, club news, and every
thing (they really mean that). Also included in our
fir t consignment was our official membership card,
signed by the honorary president, (and founder
probably), Junie herself.
They can say all they want, to about the USO
shows, letters from home, Red Cross coffee and
doughnuts and continental ladies keeping up the
hoys' morale,'but it was our club neWs that kept
the vpark of civilization and humanity glowing in
oar warrior's breast.
In the latest issue of "June's Journal," the "Bugs"
house organ, we are planning on having a distinc
tive pin for each member to wear, "so that we can

recognize fellow fans and organize theater and
skating parties."
And they gave us a long list of "pen pals" with
v/hich to correspond. We've picked out Diego Man
gawang, 1442 Wieland St. Chicago 10, 111., whose
hobbies are: "taking care of cousins and children,
solving mysteries and crimes, and joining fan clubs."
Incidentally the J.A.F.C. is a member of the As
sociated Fan Clubs of America, the Modern Screen
Fan Club Association, and possibly the N.A.M.
Junie didn't have a very good part in her last
picture so Gwen has suggested that we all write in
to Mr. Louie B. Mayer, care M.G.M., Culver City,
Calif., and tell him to give our girl better parts.
In a personal (mimeographed) letter to all her
admirers, Junie tells us that she is now working on
"Till the Clouds Roll By," the life story of Jerome
Kern. We can hardly wait. Can you?
In our April edition of "June's Journal" they list
a whole page of questions and answers from our
girl. Samples:
Q. What is your favorite form of relaxation?
A. Loafing.
Q. When are you happiest?
A. When I am with Richard (Dick Powell, her
husband and the Lon Chaney of the modern screen.)
Q. What rumor has bothered you most?
A. The one about me and Robert Walker feud
ing. Why, that's absurd. We're the bese of friends.
Q. What is your favorite type of reading?
A. Scientific books and poetry.
Q. Do you do much reading?
