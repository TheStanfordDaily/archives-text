### BILL STEIF 
Yesterday, just for the record, was the first day
sf spring at Stanford. It wasn't official because
spring officially arrives on March 21, but yesterday
was warm and sunny and delightful—it was, in
short, the kind of a day that several thousand of us
have been looking forward to for three, four, or five
years. This has no significance, we suppose; we
iust wanted to make a note of it in case it didn't
slip into the paper anywhere else.

A step was taken in the Senate the day before
yesterday which eventually may help to provide
a few homes for the many hundreds of married
Stanford students who are now living in dingy
rooms—if they can find and pav for those rooms.
The upper chamber Tuesday afternoon voted
.".'i to 20 to restore a $(>00,000,000 subsidy fund in
the Administration's housing bill.
The bill, designed to provide 2.700,000 homes in
I'ie next two years, should help break the produc
tion bottleneck which seems to be holding up ade
quate large-scale construction of new homes. The
.subsidy will, according to President Truman, en
tourage production of scarce building materials
In a much closer vote, the Administration's
stand that there is a very definite market for
prefabricated homes was upheld by the Senate.
Led by Senator Taft, the Ohio man who in the
last election just squeaked back into Congress
by a couple of thousand ballots, a group of Sen
ate Republicans attempted to eliminate a pro

vision in the housing bill under which the gov
ernment could guarantee a market for prefabri
cated houses.
Housing, as Stanford's President pointed out in
a report a few days ago, may be the returned G.l.'s
only gripe, but, from what we've heard around
campus, it surely is a very real grievance. We feel
certain that there are dozens of young couples
right here on the Farm who would jump at the
opportunity to live in a prefabricated house.
Of course, all this optimistic talk about a sub
sidy for construction men is, we'll admit, quite
premature. l'he Republicans in the Senate, led
by Senator Capehart, the automatic - c hanger
man from Indiana, and Senator Wherry of Ne
braska, made a strong bid even in the predomi
nantly Democratic senior chamber to knock out
the subsidy.
And in the House the subsidy was solidly de
feated.
How the Senate and the House are going to re
solve their differences on the bill, providing (he
Senate passes it in its present form, should be very
interesting.
And meanwhile our friends and their wives
will continue to live in their dingy little rooms—
if they can find them. If we hadn't consumed so
much milk and beef and orange juice in the days
before the war, perhaps we could now be putting
the nation's phone booths to more economical
use.
