Urging all students to sign up for the interclass competition that sig
nifies Olympic Day, Marky Cleek, publicity director, announced that more
contestants are needed to participate in the different events to be held
this Sunday from 2 to 5 p.m. in the Sunken Diamond.
Freshman and sophomore sign-ups for the different activities are near-

ly filled, but junior and senior par-" 1
ticipants are greatly needed. Sen
iors should call Torn Ashley or any
other senior officer to add their
names to the list of contestants.
Juniors, sophomores, and fresh
men must get in touch with Marky
Cleek.
Class Colors
Food will be supplied in quanti
ties on Olympic Day, and can be
obtained at the different booths to
be set up in the Sunken Diamond.
All participants should wear their
colors in some way so that they can
be distinguished, as belonging to a
certain class. Oreen will be worn
by freshmen, yellow by sopho
mores, blue by juniors, red by sen
iors, and purple by faculty mem
bers. Jeans for both men and wom
en will probably be the most famil
iar attire.
Band to Play
All graduate students who wish
to participate should sign up in the
senior class. First - year medical
students will be classed as juniors,
and second-year medicals will com
pete with the seniors.
The newly formed Stanford band
will be present on Sunday to play
between events. Don Bechter,
equipped with a roving microphone,
will be master of ceremonies and
he will announce each event as it
is to take place.
Prizes Offiered
Contests will include a three
legged race, pie - eating contest,
push - ball, and a tandem bicycle
race.
Prizes will be offered to winners
of the races, ranging from dinner
for two at Dinah's and Longbarn to
a gooey banana split at Wilson's.
Support in Bleachers
Those who are not able to sign up
for the various events should come
to the Sunken Diamond on Sunday
anyway, as they will probably be
able to enter some events then, and
give their class support from the
bleachers.
