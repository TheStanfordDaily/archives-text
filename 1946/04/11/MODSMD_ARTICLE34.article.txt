# Schapiro Plays Modernist Music
## 
### 
"All music speaks for itself," said
Maxim Schapiro, New York concert
pianist, before he presented a series
of modern works Wednesday eve
ning at Hurlburt House for about 75
Stanford students and guests.
Mr. Schapiro explained that mod
ern music can best be defined as
being the "music of our day,"and
that it is a break with tradition—a
challenging idiom. He said that love
at first saight in music is an excep
tion, and that modern music is cre
ated through the composer's com
ment on tradition. He explained that
a good criteria for modern stylists is
novelty, unusualness, and invividu
ality.
Mr. Schapiro played the following
selections:
Passagclia, by Piston; six short
pieces by Schoenberg; Fugitive Vis
ions, 10 excerpts, by Prokofieff; Alma
Brazileira, by Villa-lobos; a suite, La
Libertadors, by Dorius Mihaud; and
five etudes of Virgil Thompson.
Mr. Schapiro's mastery of the pia
no was magnificent. Perhaps if one
could spend more time listening to
his interpretations, verbal and mu
sical, of the modem stylists, their
seeming disharmony and mysticism
could be better appreciated.—l.C.
