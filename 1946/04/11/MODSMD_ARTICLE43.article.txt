# Kellenberger injured As Broncs Win. 11-4
## 
### STU MILLAR 
Carl Kellenberger, Stanford's stel
lar slugging outfielder, was declared
finished for the season yesterday af
ternoon as the Santa Clara Broncos
battered the Card nine 11 to 4 on the
Sunken Diamond.
"Kelly" who has borne the brunt
of the burden of holding the team

together, injured himself in the first
inning of the game when he made a
sensational diving catch of a low
twisting line drive. Kellenberger's
injury was diagnosed as a broken
shoulder.
As for the ball game, the less said
the better. The Stanfords kicked
the horsehide around for six errors,
something of a habit for them lately.
It was the sixth straight loss for the
team.

! In addition, the Farm's offense
which is usually good, also proved
| poor. Many possible scoring situa
tions were ruined by poor baserun
ning, particularly on the part of
Tom Ward, thirdbaseman. Ward col
| lected three of the team's seven hits.
[ but failed to score.
Stanford's starting hurler, right
j hander Frank McGraw, went three
| innings before retiring. In that pe
j riod he allowed six runs on six hits,
j striking out three and walking two.
j McGraw was charged with the de
j feat. McGraw, in a statement made
| late in the seventh inning, remarked
j that he was anxious to return to his
i former first string catching position.
Longest hit of the day was by Ma
! riani, who hit a three-bagger to open
' up the big second inning. The other
| hitting star for the Broncs was Gren-
I fell who collected three bingles in
five trips.
Altogether the Broncs batted out
13 hits and made only one error.
They were gleaned from McGraw,
Dick Flatland, and Larry Wolf. But
i there was another Stanford pitcher,
1 Bob Rosburg, making his mound
I debut less than four hours after his !
! eligibility had been cleared up, Bob ;
was on the mound for a three-in- !
I ning stretch. In this period he al
lowed NO hits and faced only nine 1
official batters.
Score by innings:
Stanford 042 000 131—11 13 1 j
Santa Clara ...042 000 131—11 13 1
