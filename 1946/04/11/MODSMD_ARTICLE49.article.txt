# Truman's Friends Ready for Fight
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. April 10 (UP).—
Administration supporters in the
House rallied today for a knock
down fight with what they called
the twin foes of President Tru
man's stabilization program—infla
tion and the farm bloc.
House committees put the finish
ing touches on a bill to extend price
controls for one year until June 30,
1947, and began work on another to
raise the national minimum wage
from .40 to 65 cents an hour.
But both i'acd hard sledding in
and out of committee, with the
added complication that the power
ful farm bloc was threatening open
ly to tack its favorite rider —linking
farm parity prices to industrial
wages—on any or all of the Ad
ministration's pet bills.
President Truman reiterated his
threat to veto any law containing
the farm parity rider, according to
Rep. George E. Outland. D., Calif.,
who conferred with the Chief Ex
ecutive on the minimum wage bill
today.
