Planks and platforms are what
politicians stand upon when up for
and then they go about
their merry way breaking them
with reckless abandon once in of-
I fice. Before this quarter gets too
far along, Slants figures it's about
time to establish a few tenets upon
' which its policy should be governed.
Slants doesn't believe in firing
verbal broadsides or salvos just
! to be at odds with any person.
But when it believes that the ath
letic set-up can be successfully
remedied by a few words, then it
will jump to the opportunity of
speaking.
Slants may at times express ideas
j which don't agree with your opin
! ion. If that's the case, drop a note
to the sports editor. We're more
than glad to hear what campus
j opinion is athletically.
The Stanford Athletic Control
—formerly the B.A.C.—may have
its faults, or what some people
! think are faults, but by and large
it conducts Stanford's athletic
program remarkably well.
There are a number of people in
j athletic circles with whom we'll try
; to co-operate as problems warrant.
1 There's A 1 Masters, director of ath
| letics, and Don Liebendorfer, pub
i licity director, with whom we'll be
I glad to work if they think we can
I smooth over a few wrinkles.
We hope John Stalnaker, Stan
ford representative on the Pa
i cific Coast Conference, will see
lit to let us know of problems
that this school encounters in re
lation with) other conference
} teams.

Major sports are football, bas
ketball, baseball, and track, but
only the grid and cage sports seem
to capture the fancy of students.
It seems to this writer that the
Sunken Diamond, the best college
field on the Coast and perhaps in
j the nation, should be filled game
after game.
Though not possessing a cham
! pionship outfit, Stanford base
! bailers do give a good account of
themselves in every game. Sat
urday a game will be played with
Hamilton Field. Why not show
Harry Wolter's gang that the 5,000
registration figure here is more
than a myth?
