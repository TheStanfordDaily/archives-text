# 'Give Up Sovereignty or Face Obliteration' Says Thurman
## 
### 
Dr. Samuel Thurman, associate professor of law at Stanford, told stu
dents and Palo Alto residents attending last night's meeting of the Student
Committee for World Federation that the next World War, which won't
be recognized as such, will be nothing short of wholesale obliteration.
Addressing the group in room 2 of the Education Building, Mr. Thur-

man asserted "ihe United States ■<
will be the frontline of any future
attack, and the first blow will prob
ably be the last."
Mr. Thurman pointed out that
history has been one long succes
sive pattern in which individuals
have grouped themselves together
for security. Bound l»y internal
laws, they have refused to recog
nize any authority outside their
particular groups.
"History has given no evidence to
note that agreements or treaties be
tween nations have ever prevented
war or brought order," Thurman
said.
"We are content to let the police
man carry the gun in today's so
ciety," Thurman stated, "yet we re
fuse to take that step in interna
tional affairs."
Mr. Thurman stated that in the
past, sovereignty has not afforded
any security, and that December 7,
1941, rendered it obsolete. "As other
countries demand their sovereignty
and security, our security decreases."
"The one chance for future se
curity is to surrender the right to
wage war to a world federated
state to which sovereignty is rele
gated on an international level."
Mr. Thurman asserted. "We will
get such a system either by con
quest or by working through the
present U.N."
Mr. Thurman emphasized the fact
that the present U.N. "is a tremen
dous step forward," and that no real
ist can advocate scrapping what we
already have to start afresh. Al
though the present organization
could handle no real crisis such as
the rise of another Hitler, it can be
highly influential in eliminating so
cial, economic, and political differ
ences.
