# Celt Poems 'Mystical' Bailey
## 
### 
With her usual rapid delivery and
knife - sharp enunciation, Margery
Bailey, mentor of the English De
partment, cowed, regaled, and de
lighted the audience at the poetry
reading Tuesday with translations
from the Celtic.
Miss Bailey prefaced her read
ing in the newly re-decorated
Briggs Room with the remark
that poets in early Ireland were
highly esteemed. They were more
important than the lawyers. A
young man entering the profes
sion spent 20 years or more as
an "apprentice" memorizing the
great traditional poems of Eire.
Miss Bailey's remark that the
early Irish poets mixed their real
ism with mysticism is probably true
of the poetry of most primitive
peoples.
The expression of the Cells as
demonstrated in the poems she
read is direct, colorful, ecstatic in
the love poems, and simple in
construction.
In reading a hermit's song Miss
Bailey commented that the early
Celtic poet was similar to the Eliza
bethan in his strong consciousness
of time's passing. The Celts lived
action-filled, warlike lives.
She read such a variety and
number of selections that only a
few stand out in the memory.
"The Failing Art." a poet's lament
for his decaying skill; "Baby Will
Be Uneasy" and "Eve's Lament,"
both satires on women; and other
satiric, half - philosophic poems
were interesting.
The rhythm in some of the poems
was not easy to follow, but when
the translation was closc to the
original it had a fresh musical qual
ity.
Judging by our meager acquaint
ance with both, we will say that
the Celtic poetry appeal's more so
phisticated but less rich in allusion
than that of the American Indian.
