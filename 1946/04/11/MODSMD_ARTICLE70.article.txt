# Spring Cleaning Time for Farm Fashions
## Fems Rate Farm Men 
### 
Clothes don't exactly make the man,
but what woman wants to shop with her j
eyes closed- 1 that was the general, con- j
cerned attitude of some 30 Stanford
women when interviewed as to what
clothes they would and would not like
to see around Stanford.
The question proved to be so contro- j
versial and negatively tinged, that it
might be less confusing for the "rough" j
who merely "aims to please" to relay
what the Stanford woman likes. Not one
of the women interviewed had any ob
jections to the following for Quad wear j
in fact they rather liked them: sweat- j
ers, preferably V-neck cashmeres, j
though nearly any sweater will do;
slacks, civilian variety or service sun
tans and pinks; and white shirts, under
sweaters or plain with sleeves rolled
just below the elbow.
PLEASE—NO SATIN SHIRTS
Clothes that rated definite "no's" from
all factions were satin shirts, suits on
Quad, suits at any time without ties, V
neck sweaters without shirts, sloppy
moccasins, hats at any time, high school
sweaters, and sport jackets with jeans.
The question o desirability of jeans for
class wear led to modified riots among
the groups of women being interviewed.
A little over half had no objections to
jeans "as long as they aren't too tight
and dirty," another large 'group was
definitely opposed to jeans, and a few
women admitted that they liked them.
Probably the most descriptive reason
for disliking jeans on men came from
one Stanford woman who said, "There
are a few men on campus, I suppose,
who look good in them all the others
look like they're standing on tooth
picks!"
Another admitted that jeans were
made for wear on farms, "but not this '
Farm."
Those who were in favor of jeans said
that they liked them when worn with
plaid shirts —tucked in, white shirts, or
sweaters.
CLEAN CORDS
The question of cords brought a com
parable split in opinion. Approximately
half were indifferent, as long as the
the cords in question were clean, and
the other half just "didn't like 'em." One
woman said that she thought dirty cords
are "disgusting, even though they are
traditional."
T-shirts received approval stamps by
all but a few women who thought that
hey "look like underwear" and should
not be worn on Quad.
Old service clothes were generally
approved —especially gabardine rain
coats. The only women who disap
proved of flight jacket 3 and leather
jackets were those few who "don't like
the smell."
When questioned as to their approval
of men's present general campus wear,
the women gave a rather half-hearted
"OK, if they were a little cleaner and
neater."
There was only one individual who
answered, "Men's clothes? Let em
wear what they want.'

but what woman wants to shop with her j
eyes closed- 1 that was the general, con- j
cerned attitude of some 30 Stanford
women when interviewed as to what
clothes they would and would not like
to see around Stanford.
The question proved to be so contro- j
versial and negatively tinged, that it
might be less confusing for the "rough" j
who merely "aims to please" to relay
what the Stanford woman likes. Not one
of the women interviewed had any ob
jections to the following for Quad wear j
in fact they rather liked them: sweat- j
ers, preferably V-neck cashmeres, j
though nearly any sweater will do;
slacks, civilian variety or service sun
tans and pinks; and white shirts, under
sweaters or plain with sleeves rolled
just below the elbow.
PLEASE—NO SATIN SHIRTS
Clothes that rated definite "no's" from
all factions were satin shirts, suits on
Quad, suits at any time without ties, V
neck sweaters without shirts, sloppy
moccasins, hats at any time, high school
sweaters, and sport jackets with jeans.
The question o desirability of jeans for
class wear led to modified riots among
the groups of women being interviewed.
A little over half had no objections to
jeans "as long as they aren't too tight
and dirty," another large 'group was
definitely opposed to jeans, and a few
women admitted that they liked them.
Probably the most descriptive reason
for disliking jeans on men came from
one Stanford woman who said, "There
are a few men on campus, I suppose,
who look good in them all the others
look like they're standing on tooth
picks!"
Another admitted that jeans were
made for wear on farms, "but not this '
Farm."
Those who were in favor of jeans said
that they liked them when worn with
plaid shirts —tucked in, white shirts, or
sweaters.
CLEAN CORDS
The question of cords brought a com
parable split in opinion. Approximately
half were indifferent, as long as the
the cords in question were clean, and
the other half just "didn't like 'em." One
woman said that she thought dirty cords
are "disgusting, even though they are
traditional."
T-shirts received approval stamps by
all but a few women who thought that
hey "look like underwear" and should
not be worn on Quad.
Old service clothes were generally
approved —especially gabardine rain
coats. The only women who disap
proved of flight jacket 3 and leather
jackets were those few who "don't like
the smell."
When questioned as to their approval
of men's present general campus wear,
the women gave a rather half-hearted
"OK, if they were a little cleaner and
neater."
There was only one individual who
answered, "Men's clothes? Let em
wear what they want.'
