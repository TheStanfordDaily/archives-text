# Clothes Make the Mannikin
## 
### 
There is more to being a successful person
than just having brains, a "stylish" personal
ity, or being a much-heralded activity wom
an or man. The expression that "clothes
make the man" is trite and hackneyed, but
there is more truth in *it than comes to the
surface.
The clothes every woman wears reflect
her personality as perhaps no other mate
rial aspect of her personality can. Their sim
plicity or their fussiness, the choice of color,
style, accessory combinations—and the oc
casions on which they are worn—tell the ob
server what kind of a»person the wearer is.
Stanford women have always enjoyed a
high reputation for their general standard of
good taste in clothes. The now outmoded
requirement of wearing stockings on Quad;
the rules against wearing jeans, slacks, or
shorts past the P. 0.; the taboo on overly
fussy or dressy Quad wear —all were made
or grew up for good reason. The uncon
scious thought behind all such rules has
been that college is a preparation, an intro
duction, to adult life and resoonsibility.

What we are learning in school today is help
ing us to take our places in the world as intel
ligent, clear-thinking adults. And the clothes
we are expected to wear—the standard of
dress we are expected to maintain—help to
give us the taste and poise that must neces
sarily accompany our positions in the future.
This does not mean that Stanford women
must break their bank books to buy the most
stylish, most expensive, or most fashionable
clothes on the market. It means, rather, that
we dress neatly, practice good grooming, and
choose relatively simple, conservative styles
with an eye to how they fit our figures and
augment our personalities.
There is no absolute criterion as to what
"the well-dressed Stanford woman should
wear." The only criterion is the individual
woman herself. We have tried to present this
Fashion Edition with a thought to the many
varied types of women now attending Stan
ford; and have tried to include in the edition
suggestions of wide enough variety to help
each of us to choose our wardrobes with a
thought to the general standards expected of
us as college women.
