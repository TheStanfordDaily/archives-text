# Fashion Is Spinach
## 
### 
Fashion, we've decided, is just so much
spinach.
After two weeks o' preparing today's Fash
ion Edition, we expected to have more en
lightened comments to make about what is
commonly called chic. But we've ended up
with the conclusion that fashion is a way o"
smiling, a china lapel pin, black-for-date
dresses, and a cultivated neatness. Fashion
is you, and what coss with you.
But today's edition taught us more than
that. We discovered a lot of willing souls
who waited Icr tedious hours to be photo

graphed or tramped the city to be posed and
fitted.
We thanked our stars for photographers
who took pictures, developed and printed
them in unbroken succession and didn't
Hindi when we couldn't use their products.
And there were fifteen men and women
on the editoiial staff who added fashion copy
to their regular assignments.
To all of these energetic woikers, we g;vo
thanks, and to you readers we present our
much labored ' Spring Fashions.
â€”The Editors.
