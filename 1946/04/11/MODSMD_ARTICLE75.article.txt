# Men Rate Farm Fems--They'll Do, They Say
## 
### 
Stanford men like their women just
about as they are, as long as they put a
limit on the sloppiness of their clothes.
At least this was the "easy to please"
attitude taken by the majority of men
interviewed in Reg Day lines, the Lel
lar, and thereabouts as to their views
on feminine <vear around Stanford.
One of the most surprising attitudes
discovered through the survey was that
most of the men interviewed had no
objections to sloppy sweaters and bobby
socks for class wear. In fact, they voted
for these articles in favor of dressier
types of apparel for Quad wear.
800 TO SILK STOCKINGS
With a few exceptions, an over-all
return of silk stockings to the campus
was unanimously voted down. This at
titude was supported by veterans who
have attended Stanford under both the
silk stocking and bobby sock regimes.
Said one veteran, whp just returned to
Stanford this quarter after an absence
of three years, "The fact that women
are wearing shoes is amazing in itself."
Veterans also voted that they can see
little change in Stanford women and
their clothes though they're just a lit
tle disappointed in the ratio. A few also
{ commented that the women on campus
now look younger than those who were
' here several years ago.
i DOWN ON DRAPES
As for date dresses, men interviewed
smiled slyly and agreed with nearly
anything that was mentioned. They don't
: object to Quad clothes for movie dates
• in Paly, they like suits for rather sporty
. dates, and dresses for occasions.
Most of the men interviewed were in
j different to drape skirt dresses, though
I several objected strenuously.
Black was voted the most popular

color for dresses, with purple fo - .
blondes and white for brunettes als.'
receiving strong nods of approval. Sev
eral men interviewed stated that they
definitely liked to see their dates wea;
linger nail polish.
Formals and formal dances rated -pre
longed "Mmmmmm's" from most mer.
interviewed. When asked if that mean
that he was ir> favor of having more fo:
mal dances, one man hesitated, "well
no guy likes to get dressed up in a tux
—but the girls sure look good." An
other problem produced by this gues
tion was that of a "rough" who couldn'*
understand "why girls look so good a:
a formal, then you can't even recognize
them the next day on Quad."
BUT THEY'RE COMFORTABLE
Jeans and men's long shirts for worn
en received a negative vote from nearly
every faction. A few men, however,
said that they didn't mind jeans whe.\
worn for appropriate occasions.
In nearly direct opposition to the ma
jority of agreeable, almost indifferent
opinions received in the survey, was
that of one man who plans to go int.?
the business of manufacturing women's
clothing, following graduation. Claim
ing that he had received the informa
tion that women's skirts are getting
longer direct from a clothing manufac
turer, he was guite disturbed about the
whole situation. "They're lowering the
tops and lengthening the skirts that's.
what they're doing," he said.
Again speaking from a professional
standpoint, he stated that Stanford worn
en's clothes are too sloppy, and that silk
stockings and dresses should be stand
ard class wear.
All other men interviewed, however
proved to have definitely non-profes
sional attitudes and to be guite well
pleased with the situation as it stands.
