# About the Cover...

Because it's spring, because sailing
and swimming and out-of-nowhere sun
tans belong with spring at Stanford, we
dedicated the cover of today's fashion
edition to the Boathouse. Grace Camp-
bell, wearing a Roos Brothers' two-piece
pedal-pusher suit, is helping Phil Prince
adjust the sail on Fizz, the sailboat seen
swooping around Lake Lagunita each
afternoon this quarter. Phil is wearing a
green and brown Hawaiian shirt and
khaki pants — adapted from the ensem-
ble which rated highest in men's wear
in spring of '45.
