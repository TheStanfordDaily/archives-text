# Sun 'n Spring! You in Cottons on Quad
## 
### 
Like dark glasses, suntan oil, and
' weekends at Carmel, the cotton parade
striped for victory feminine for the
boys takes over Stanford in spring,
providing a welcome relief from baggy
j sweaters and dark wool skirts that now
look like winter's last gasp.
True, cottons cost more this year. But
they pay off in effect in comfort. Be
sides reminding the approving mascu
i line eye that you are fashion-wise, cot
tons are:
SLIMMING
Stripes are in this year. And they're
; designed to direct the eye vertically,
from your glossy topknot to your ballet
shod underpinnings. They accentuate

the new, longer look in bold blight
colors, in soft pastels.
Hems have come down, to a point mid
way between the ballerina and the half
knee points. This is a boon to co-cds
with bruised knees from a coarse in
Modern Dance.
And in direct contrast to our rainy
day straight-from-shoulders-to-hernstitch
ing low, the cottons are fitted. Sport
ing either a bright bold belt to accent
your solid-color chambrays or a soft
tie on the multicolored cottons the waist
is emphasized.
CLEAN
Cottons don't belong in the parade it
they're not spanking clean, and crisp
a lettuce leaf. And that goes for the
co-ed too. Cottons cry for clean saddle
shoes, shining hair, and a general aura
of soap and water, that is typically
American.
It means logging more ironing board
time 4 but the glad eye from your share
of the 3,000 roughs is well worth it.
COMFORTABLE
Whether its an 8 o'clock, or Cellar
coke date, it's easy to slip into cottons.
They've really done it this time.
They've made 'wrap-around dreams that
don't look like a tired housewife's morn
ing after. They're trim, and they're ap
pearing in a new Mexican horse pi int.
The shirtmaker boasts -a row of gleam
ing buttons to stylize its classic simplic
ity.
Once upon a time the manufacturers
brought out a cotton with two handy
pockets* and co-eds have never forgot
ten it. They're handy for hankies, hands,
and what have you. They're present this
spring in nearly all cottons.
DELECTABLE
Especially the colors: cherry, aqua
foam, melon, jade-green, coral, and
maize; or you may prefer Stanford's own
versions in Union-spinach green. Ro
ble-stucco pink, or chlorinated-water
white.
Necklines are fashion hits necklines
are nip and show, as in popular keyhole
style, and the now-you-see-it-now-you
don't slit neckline. Also popular are the
new rolled turtle, and U lines.
The cap sleeves seems to have ar
; rived; its cool, and it's right with ev
erything. Lantern sleeves are newer
: under the sun. They look like exagger
; ated puffs turned down, and are seen
generally on the storybook cottons with
| full skirts, or the Mexican low shoulder
blouses.
VERSATILE
From the Boathouse, to Quad classes,
from entertaining in the lobby to shop
ping in Paly, cottons are right every
where. They can be dressed down with
bare feet and pigtails, prepared for class
with saddles and a ribbon in your hair;
with ballets and a pretty bracelet they
are right for entertaining, and with white
gloves and your favorite spectators, and
a wisp of a hat they'll take you any
i where.
From Lag, to the Knoll, to Branner,
it's cotton. And now, where's the sun?

spring days on Quad are these
two dresses from Joseph Mag
nin, Palo Alto. On the left,

ple pink fitted cotton with a
round, white pique, scalloped
collar. Dianne Reinle, Dot's
Roble roommate, wears a blue
cotton, with white eyelet top
and cap sleeves.

SPRING MEANS PICNIC TIME, and off to the hills are Con

wearing blue and white houndstooth check pedal pushers,
and Margie Hanson, ready for the sun in a chartreuse and
black skirt and short outfit. Clothes from Roos Bros.

CLEAN
Cottons don't belong in the parade it
they're not spanking clean, and crisp

American.

DELECTABLE

maize; or you may prefer Stanford's own
versions in Union-spinach green. Ro
ble-stucco pink, or chlorinated-water
white.
Necklines are fashion hits necklines
are nip and show, as in popular keyhole

VERSATILE
From the Boathouse, to Quad classes,
from entertaining in the lobby to shop
ping in Paly, cottons are right every

a wisp of a hat they'll take you any

From Lag, to the Knoll, to Branner,
it's cotton. And now, where's the sun?

is emphasized.
CLEAN
Cottons don't belong in the parade it
they're not spanking clean, and crisp
a lettuce leaf. And that goes for the
co-ed too. Cottons cry for clean saddle
shoes, shining hair, and a general aura
of soap and water, that is typically
American.
It means logging more ironing board
time 4 but the glad eye from your share
of the 3,000 roughs is well worth it.
COMFORTABLE
Whether its an 8 o'clock, or Cellar
coke date, it's easy to slip into cottons.
They've really done it this time.
They've made 'wrap-around dreams that
don't look like a tired housewife's morn
ing after. They're trim, and they're ap
pearing in a new Mexican horse pi int.
The shirtmaker boasts -a row of gleam
ing buttons to stylize its classic simplic
ity.
Once upon a time the manufacturers
brought out a cotton with two handy
pockets* and co-eds have never forgot
ten it. They're handy for hankies, hands,
and what have you. They're present this
spring in nearly all cottons.
DELECTABLE
Especially the colors: cherry, aqua
foam, melon, jade-green, coral, and
maize; or you may prefer Stanford's own
versions in Union-spinach green. Ro
ble-stucco pink, or chlorinated-water
white.
Necklines are fashion hits necklines
are nip and show, as in popular keyhole
style, and the now-you-see-it-now-you
don't slit neckline. Also popular are the
new rolled turtle, and U lines.
The cap sleeves seems to have ar
; rived; its cool, and it's right with ev
erything. Lantern sleeves are newer
: under the sun. They look like exagger
; ated puffs turned down, and are seen
generally on the storybook cottons with
| full skirts, or the Mexican low shoulder
blouses.
VERSATILE
From the Boathouse, to Quad classes,
from entertaining in the lobby to shop
ping in Paly, cottons are right every
where. They can be dressed down with
bare feet and pigtails, prepared for class
with saddles and a ribbon in your hair;
with ballets and a pretty bracelet they
are right for entertaining, and with white
gloves and your favorite spectators, and
a wisp of a hat they'll take you any
i where.
From Lag, to the Knoll, to Branner,
it's cotton. And now, where's the sun?
