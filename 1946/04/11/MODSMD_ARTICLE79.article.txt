# Classroom I.Q.---Loud Plaids, Neat Blazers
## 
### 
The basis of any Stanford girl's ward
robe is her Quad clothes, those that she
wears almost every day of the week
for classes, activities, study and play
times, and non-dressy dates. Quad
clothes are designed primarily for com
fort and range from very sloppy sweat
ers and loud plaid skirts to crisp, pastel,
cotton dresses, depending upon the
time of year.
A variety of sweaters is a must in
any girl's wardrobe. V-neck sweaters
in all colors, especially cashmeres, have
been tremendously popular this year.
They are worn over a V-neck blouse or
dickey or an angel-neck blouse, often
with a single strand of pearls or a
locket.
COLOR ON QUAD
Round-neck slipovers and cardigans
are also worn all-year around with
blouses, dickeys, necklaces, or lockets.
Most adaptable of all are cardigans
which may be worn as a wrap over cot
ton dresses on chilly, foggy mornings.
This time of year on Quad there is a
predominance of pastel shades light
greens, pinks, yellows, whites, and
blues. Although cashmeres are hard to
get, they are definitely outstanding in
popularity and neatness.
Plain skirts have been much more
popular this year than last and are
seen a great deal with sweaters to
match. In the winter months girls look
very smart in a dark brown or navy
blue matching sweater and skirt with a
white collar and socks. Pastel outfits of
plain yellow, blue, lavender, and pink
are very popular this spring.
CABARDINES RATE HIGH
Plaid skirts, particularly Scotch plaids
and pastels with lots of pleats, are still
the favorites of many girls. Worn with
blazers or sweaters of one of the colors
in the skirt, they make up an outfit that
Is both colorful and smart. Check shirts
have retained their popularity, and
stiinod ones have been seen a good
deal lately.
For neater Quad clothes, suits in
pjaids, checks, and plain colors are rec
ommended as well as casual dresses.
Especially good-looking are plain col
ered gabardine sport dresses.
Now that spring is here, girls are
beginning to put away their sweaters

and skirts in mothproof bags (we hope)
and don cotton dresses. For more con
servative tastes, plain-colored cham
brays and striped seersuckers are rec
ommended. They are always cool and
neat-looking and very comfortable to
wear.
THE PRICE OF BEAUTY
Plaids and prints in bright and pastel
colors are a rage this year. Cap sleeves
are being featured a great deal. Bright
cotton skirts to be worn with all sorts
of ingenious blouses are very practical
they are also easy to make.
Although spring clothes tend to be
much neater and more feminine than
fall and winter Quad wear, they add a
lot to a girl's laundry problems, and
are therefore much less practical. To
decide which season's clothes you pre
fer, you have to choose between your
femininity and small washings.
At almost all times of year, the Stan
ford co-ed needs a wrap when she
starts out for her 8 o'clock each morn
ing. The gabardine or covert-cloth coat
is ideal for winter and fall and can stand
being caught in the rain. It is also ideal
for wear over suits and sweaters.
Tweeds, checks, and plain colors, par
ticularly brown, beige, red, <frey and
blue are also very suitable.

As soon as spring weather hits the
campus, our heavy practical coats are
discarded for coats of lightweight pastel
campus, heavy practical coats are
shades that definitely increase cleaning
bills. Shorty coats are popular for spring
and suits are excellent because no coat
is needed.
For rainy weather, trench coats and
fitted rain coats in bright reds, greens,
and blues dominate the Quad and prob
ably always will. Individuality can be
shown in one's choice of a rain hat.
No matter what you are wearing or
what the weather is, saddle shoes take
precedence over any othors for Quad
wear. Loafers hit a close second.
Wooden shoes are attractive and prac
tical if one doesnt' own rubber boots for
rainy weather, but they are not very
comfortable.
In the spring, white buck oxfords and
various types of play shoes come into
style to wear with cotton dresses.

For neater Quad clothes, suits in

Now that spring is here, girls are

Plaids and prints in bright and pastel
colors are a rage this year. Cap sleeves
are being featured a great deal. Bright
cotton skirts to be worn with all sorts
of ingenious blouses are very practical
they are also easy to make.
Although spring clothes tend to be
much neater and more feminine than
fall and winter Quad wear, they add a
lot to a girl's laundry problems, and
are therefore much less practical. To
decide which season's clothes you pre

femininity and small washings.
At almost all times of year, the Stan
ford co-ed needs a wrap when she
starts out for her 8 o'clock each morn

is ideal for winter and fall and can stand
being caught in the rain. It is also ideal
for wear over suits and sweaters.
Tweeds, checks, and plain colors, par
ticularly brown, beige, red, <frey and
blue are also very suitable.

As soon as spring weather hits the
campus, our heavy practical coats are
discarded for coats of lightweight pastel
campus, heavy practical coats are
shades that definitely increase cleaning
bills. Shorty coats are popular for spring
and suits are excellent because no coat
is needed.
For rainy weather, trench coats and
fitted rain coats in bright reds, greens,
and blues dominate the Quad and prob
ably always will. Individuality can be
shown in one's choice of a rain hat.
No matter what you are wearing or
what the weather is, saddle shoes take

wear. Loafers hit a close second.
Wooden shoes are attractive and prac

In the spring, white buck oxfords and

The basis of any Stanford girl's ward
robe is her Quad clothes, those that she
wears almost every day of the week
for classes, activities, study and play
times, and non-dressy dates. Quad
clothes are designed primarily for com
fort and range from very sloppy sweat
ers and loud plaid skirts to crisp, pastel,
cotton dresses, depending upon the
time of year.
A variety of sweaters is a must in
any girl's wardrobe. V-neck sweaters
in all colors, especially cashmeres, have
been tremendously popular this year.
They are worn over a V-neck blouse or
dickey or an angel-neck blouse, often
with a single strand of pearls or a
locket.

Round-neck slipovers and cardigans
are also worn all-year around with
blouses, dickeys, necklaces, or lockets.
Most adaptable of all are cardigans
which may be worn as a wrap over cot

This time of year on Quad there is a
predominance of pastel shades light
greens, pinks, yellows, whites, and
blues. Although cashmeres are hard to
get, they are definitely outstanding in
popularity and neatness.
Plain skirts have been much more
popular this year than last and are
seen a great deal with sweaters to
match. In the winter months girls look
very smart in a dark brown or navy
blue matching sweater and skirt with a
white collar and socks. Pastel outfits of
plain yellow, blue, lavender, and pink
are very popular this spring.

shades that definitely increase cleaning
bills. Shorty coats are popular for spring
and suits are excellent because no coat
is needed.
For rainy weather, trench coats and
fitted rain coats in bright reds, greens,
and blues dominate the Quad and prob
ably always will. Individuality can be
shown in one's choice of a rain hat.
No matter what you are wearing or
what the weather is, saddle shoes take
precedence over any othors for Quad
wear. Loafers hit a close second.
Wooden shoes are attractive and prac
tical if one doesnt' own rubber boots for
rainy weather, but they are not very
comfortable.
In the spring, white buck oxfords and
various types of play shoes come into
style to wear with cotton dresses.
