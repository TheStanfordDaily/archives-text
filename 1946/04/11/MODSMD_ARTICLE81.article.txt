# What to Wear With What You Wear
## 
### 
Quad clothes look best with little or
no jewelry. With present-day styles
casual and comfortable, the presence of
jewelry tends to give the outfit a clut
lered-up appearance. However, there
is some simple jewelry that is generally
accepted and approved, and others that
some girls wear to try to show their in
dividuality.
For tops in appearance, they say a
girl ought to have a fraternity pin. But
if a girl isn't offered one, she should get
cne someplace, because a fraternity pin
is the neatest accessory for an everyday
Quad outfit.
A Stanford girl's jewelry box should

[ include a strand of pearls, because it
can be worn with almost anything in
her wardrobe and be in good taste.
; Pearls look neat with sweaters particu
larly if no blouse or dickey is worn,
with a sweater or blouse underneath a
| suit jacket or blazer, and with many
dresses.
Also accepted for Quad wear are
| simple rings friendship rings and gold
bands and rings with sentimental value
! —engagement rings, family rings, and
those given as special gifts. For Quad
wear, nail polish is not recommended.
For wrist wear, watches and I.D.
bracelets are most acceptable.

What Not to Wear —

A lot has been written on what to
wear on Quad, but there are certain j
things that are not acceptable. First on i
this list is jeans, or slacks. They are '
fine for studying at the house, lounging ;
around, or sport wear, but are definitely
! out of place beyond the Post Office.
High heels for Quad wear are also j
frowned upon, probably because they |
look uncomfortable, and the Quad ward
; robe is designed for comfort and cas
ualness. Earrings, too much other jewel
ry, and no shoes with socks or stockings
or suntan are also on the disapproved
list.

Shoe styles haven't changed much
since they had buttons up to the knees,
| but one assurance may be offered to
j those collegiates who want to make sure
i they're wearing 1946 styles shoes are
definitely being worn this year.
SHOES
On Quad, at Dinah's, at work, or while
j enjoying yourself, the vast variety of
| shoe types being worn provides the
well-dressed droop with plenty of op
portunity to buy as many pairs of shoes
for each occasion as he can afford, and
then provides him with plenty of con
: versational material after he gets to the
aforementioned place.

| Shoes as conversational material are
I very valuable, since probably the two
j most important attributes of shoes for
I the past decade (outside of covering the
feet) have been as conversation pieces
and as the buffers of FOOTSIE playing.
Concerning the former, certainly no
social gathering would be complete
j without the usual few minutes of sitting
| around admiring the footwear of every
one else. If the event is in San Fran
! Cisco on Third street, red shoes with
blue bows are quite appropriate. If,
however, you're dancing at -the Mark,
I the tendency during he past few years
has been toward black (or a conserva
tive color with matching accessories)
open-toed, sling pumps. Of course, the
old standby of the spectator pump is
| always good, although not dressy
enough for some occasions.
SABOTS
Shoes as conversation pieces are of
no use at Stanford firesides', since it's
I too dark to see them anyway; so prac-
J tically anything can be worn down to a
burlap bag tied with Stanford Daily
typewriter ribbons.
Perhaps these blackouts are one rea
! son why the highly-approved practice
j of playing "footsie" has come into be
' ing, as this provides a satisfactory way
of appreciating all kinds of shoes.
In the libe, in particular, footsie plav
i ing has become a popular pastime, and
students generally wear saddles (pr«'
| erably clean), white buckskins
| preferably clean), or the newer fad.
j brown loafers (which don't have to be
kept clean, luckily).
ZAPATOS
Recently banned from wear through
overwhelming student opinion were the
j wooden-soled Dutch shoes, formerly
popular during rainy weather. It was
discovered that flat feet and black and
i blue ankles developed from the wear
ing of these shoes: at dances fellows
objected to being stepped on with 135
lbs. of wooden shoes, and at the libe
; the proper atmosphere of footsie playing
: was sadly handicapped by the agon
ized screams of someone who had acci
dentally been kicked above the instep
with said wood.
One of the sternest postulates of Stan
j ford life has been the "keep your shoes
clean" or "Little Leland never did it"
| concept. Several students who have ar
j rived from other schools have proudly
paraded their ten-year dirt-collected sad
dles before the assembled mobs on
Quad at 8 a.m., only to realize too late
I that "cleanliness is next to Western Civ"
' or "Aristotle was never like this."
SCHUHE
During the war saddles were diffi
cult to obtain, and loafers became pret
! ty popular. Now, however, it's encour
j aging to note that "even the boys are
wearing saddles now" and the danger
of the traditional college badge becom
! ing extinct is disappearing.

What Not to Wear —

A lot has been written on what to
wear on Quad, but there are certain j
things that are not acceptable. First on i
this list is jeans, or slacks. They are '
fine for studying at the house, lounging ;
around, or sport wear, but are definitely
! out of place beyond the Post Office.
High heels for Quad wear are also j
frowned upon, probably because they |
look uncomfortable, and the Quad ward
; robe is designed for comfort and cas
ualness. Earrings, too much other jewel
ry, and no shoes with socks or stockings
or suntan are also on the disapproved
list.

Shoe styles haven't changed much
since they had buttons up to the knees,
| but one assurance may be offered to
j those collegiates who want to make sure
i they're wearing 1946 styles shoes are
definitely being worn this year.
SHOES
On Quad, at Dinah's, at work, or while
j enjoying yourself, the vast variety of
| shoe types being worn provides the
well-dressed droop with plenty of op
portunity to buy as many pairs of shoes
for each occasion as he can afford, and
then provides him with plenty of con
: versational material after he gets to the
aforementioned place.

| Shoes as conversational material are
I very valuable, since probably the two
j most important attributes of shoes for
I the past decade (outside of covering the
feet) have been as conversation pieces
and as the buffers of FOOTSIE playing.
Concerning the former, certainly no
social gathering would be complete
j without the usual few minutes of sitting
| around admiring the footwear of every
one else. If the event is in San Fran
! Cisco on Third street, red shoes with
blue bows are quite appropriate. If,
however, you're dancing at -the Mark,
I the tendency during he past few years
has been toward black (or a conserva
tive color with matching accessories)
open-toed, sling pumps. Of course, the
old standby of the spectator pump is
| always good, although not dressy
enough for some occasions.
SABOTS
Shoes as conversation pieces are of
no use at Stanford firesides', since it's
I too dark to see them anyway; so prac-
J tically anything can be worn down to a
burlap bag tied with Stanford Daily
typewriter ribbons.
Perhaps these blackouts are one rea
! son why the highly-approved practice
j of playing "footsie" has come into be
' ing, as this provides a satisfactory way
of appreciating all kinds of shoes.
In the libe, in particular, footsie plav
i ing has become a popular pastime, and
students generally wear saddles (pr«'
| erably clean), white buckskins
| preferably clean), or the newer fad.
j brown loafers (which don't have to be
kept clean, luckily).
ZAPATOS
Recently banned from wear through
overwhelming student opinion were the
j wooden-soled Dutch shoes, formerly
popular during rainy weather. It was
discovered that flat feet and black and
i blue ankles developed from the wear
ing of these shoes: at dances fellows
objected to being stepped on with 135
lbs. of wooden shoes, and at the libe
; the proper atmosphere of footsie playing
: was sadly handicapped by the agon
ized screams of someone who had acci
dentally been kicked above the instep
with said wood.
One of the sternest postulates of Stan
j ford life has been the "keep your shoes
clean" or "Little Leland never did it"
| concept. Several students who have ar
j rived from other schools have proudly
paraded their ten-year dirt-collected sad
dles before the assembled mobs on
Quad at 8 a.m., only to realize too late
I that "cleanliness is next to Western Civ"
' or "Aristotle was never like this."
SCHUHE
During the war saddles were diffi
cult to obtain, and loafers became pret

What Not to Wear —

A lot has been written on what to
wear on Quad, but there are certain j
things that are not acceptable. First on i
this list is jeans, or slacks. They are '
fine for studying at the house, lounging ;
around, or sport wear, but are definitely
! out of place beyond the Post Office.
High heels for Quad wear are also j
frowned upon, probably because they |
look uncomfortable, and the Quad ward
; robe is designed for comfort and cas
ualness. Earrings, too much other jewel
ry, and no shoes with socks or stockings
or suntan are also on the disapproved
list.

Shoe styles haven't changed much
since they had buttons up to the knees,
| but one assurance may be offered to
j those collegiates who want to make sure
i they're wearing 1946 styles shoes are
definitely being worn this year.
SHOES
On Quad, at Dinah's, at work, or while
j enjoying yourself, the vast variety of
| shoe types being worn provides the
well-dressed droop with plenty of op
portunity to buy as many pairs of shoes
for each occasion as he can afford, and
then provides him with plenty of con
: versational material after he gets to the
aforementioned place.

| Shoes as conversational material are
I very valuable, since probably the two
j most important attributes of shoes for
I the past decade (outside of covering the
feet) have been as conversation pieces
and as the buffers of FOOTSIE playing.
Concerning the former, certainly no
social gathering would be complete
j without the usual few minutes of sitting
| around admiring the footwear of every
one else. If the event is in San Fran
! Cisco on Third street, red shoes with
blue bows are quite appropriate. If,
however, you're dancing at -the Mark,
I the tendency during he past few years
has been toward black (or a conserva
tive color with matching accessories)
open-toed, sling pumps. Of course, the
old standby of the spectator pump is
| always good, although not dressy
enough for some occasions.
SABOTS
Shoes as conversation pieces are of
no use at Stanford firesides', since it's
I too dark to see them anyway; so prac-
J tically anything can be worn down to a
burlap bag tied with Stanford Daily
typewriter ribbons.
Perhaps these blackouts are one rea
! son why the highly-approved practice
j of playing "footsie" has come into be
' ing, as this provides a satisfactory way
of appreciating all kinds of shoes.
In the libe, in particular, footsie plav
i ing has become a popular pastime, and
students generally wear saddles (pr«'
| erably clean), white buckskins
| preferably clean), or the newer fad.
j brown loafers (which don't have to be
kept clean, luckily).
ZAPATOS
Recently banned from wear through
overwhelming student opinion were the
j wooden-soled Dutch shoes, formerly
popular during rainy weather. It was
discovered that flat feet and black and
i blue ankles developed from the wear
ing of these shoes: at dances fellows
objected to being stepped on with 135
lbs. of wooden shoes, and at the libe
; the proper atmosphere of footsie playing
: was sadly handicapped by the agon
ized screams of someone who had acci
dentally been kicked above the instep
with said wood.
One of the sternest postulates of Stan
j ford life has been the "keep your shoes
clean" or "Little Leland never did it"
| concept. Several students who have ar
j rived from other schools have proudly
paraded their ten-year dirt-collected sad
dles before the assembled mobs on
Quad at 8 a.m., only to realize too late
I that "cleanliness is next to Western Civ"
' or "Aristotle was never like this."
SCHUHE
During the war saddles were diffi
cult to obtain, and loafers became pret
! ty popular. Now, however, it's encour
j aging to note that "even the boys are
wearing saddles now" and the danger
of the traditional college badge becom
! ing extinct is disappearing.
Quad clothes look best with little or
no jewelry. With present-day styles
casual and comfortable, the presence of
jewelry tends to give the outfit a clut
lered-up appearance. However, there
is some simple jewelry that is generally
accepted and approved, and others that
some girls wear to try to show their in
dividuality.
