# Hair Styles Show Season
## 
### 
Hair styles for the Quad vary with the
season. In the fall, girls have just re
turned from a restful summer vacation
and have good intentions of keeping up
an attractive appearance as well as their
studies throughout the year.
Most girls wear their hair either long
with a loose curl in the ends or a short,
curly feather cut. In the fall, girls put
their hair up every night for several
weeks and it is kept looking curly and
glossy.
After a few weeks, however, the
pressure begins, and with it, the wear
ing of kerchiefs to cover up hair that
should have been washed last night or
put up, at least. This situation con
tinues throughout the winter, and on
rainy days, curly hair is seldom seen.
In the spring, many girls have their
hair cut short so that it will be com
fortably cool and easy to take care of
during the swimming season. Those
who continue to hive long hair, often
braid it and wear bright ribbons around
the pig-tails. Others wind the braids
over the top of their head, a hair style
that is also cool and summery.
Each girl should wear her hair in a
style becoming to her, but the main req
uisite of any head of hair is that it be
neat and clean. For the Quad, hair-dos
should be simple, and decorations in
one s hair should also bo s itnpla.
