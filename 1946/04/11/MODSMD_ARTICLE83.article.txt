# Off to the Boathouse, Up to Yosemite...
## Boathouse Learns to Parleyvoo 
### 
Bathing suits are scantier than ever.
Perhaps the French influence more than
shortages has caused the recent trend.
Two-piece suits seem to be the most
popular this season, and they range
from simple solid colors to gay stripes
and flowered models with rhumba ties
(the little draped skirts that tie in the
front). The boxer two-piece suits pat
terned after men's trunks which were
much in demand last season are even
mor<j popular on campus now.
The one-piece suits seen on sun decks
and at the Boathouse are as varied as
the brief two-piecer. White suits or
those with white backgrounds are fa
vored because of the contrast with even
the slightest tan.
Many of the one-piece suits have bare
midriffs for more sunshine. Among the
newest models are the suits with the
bloomer or diaper effect.
Although cotton yardage is still diffi
cult to find, the majority of the bathing
suits are of cotton. Rayon jersey is also
used for many of the colorful suits.
The material affects the style, and there
fore current fashions have not had the
snugness of prewar bathing suits. Very
recently Lastex suits have been shown
again. Many of the cotton suits are
made of puckerette for a smoothei fit.

Now that gas rationing has ended and
comparatively peaceful times have re
turned it iS easier to go places there
are more cars on campus to go in and
more people to go with, or at least more
people to see you going.
From skiing at Yosemite to sunbath
ing on the deck of the Boathouse, play
clothes rate with importance at this time
of the year.
BREVITY IS THE SOLE . . .
Boathouse fashions are as brief as
possible. Abbreviated sunsuits and dark
glass make up the typical sunbathing at
tire. Straps are lowered by many co-eds
as they attempt to do a little light read
ing or play a few games of bridge on
the Boathouse deck. Although the Lake
is condemned for swimming, it is still
good enough for lots of canoeing.
Every women's hall on campus boasts
of its sun deck or back yard where those
who were able to plan a schedule with
out afternoon classes catch up on their
sleep or gather with their typewriters,
books, and cards for a few hours of leis
ure.
OIL FOR THE GOILS
Johnson's baby oil is favored for an
all-over smooth tan. For those who have
trouble absorbing the sun, two parts
olive oil with one part vinegar are good
to prevent burning or peeling.
On weekends the more fortunate trek
to Santa Cruz, Carmel, or Half Moon
Bay for a day. Sunseekers amuse them
selves on the Boardwalk when the sun
becomes too much for them. All day
picnics along the shore and playing
baseball in the sand are good ways to
deepen a tan.
RAINED ON
Over spring vacation the rain kept
many Stanfordites from acquiring tans
at the beaches (at least in California),
but those who went skiing returned tan
•—and some even peeling. On warm
days at the snow some of the more con
fident skiiers ski in bathing suits for an
all over tan. Either brown skin or no
skin at all.
Getting back on campus, the ever pop
ular white shorts and the so-called clam
diggers or pedal pushers are favored for
tennis, golf, and bike riding.
With 1.9 times two eyes on each little
Indian maid, playtime fashions should
hit an all-time high along with the reg
totals.

ure.
OIL FOR THE GOILS
Johnson's baby oil is favored for an
all-over smooth tan. For those who have
trouble absorbing the sun, two parts
olive oil with one part vinegar are good
to prevent burning or peeling.
On weekends the more fortunate trek
to Santa Cruz, Carmel, or Half Moon
Bay for a day. Sunseekers amuse them
selves on the Boardwalk when the sun
becomes too much for them. All day
picnics along the shore and playing
baseball in the sand are good ways to
deepen a tan.
RAINED ON
Over spring vacation the rain kept
many Stanfordites from acquiring tans
at the beaches (at least in California),
but those who went skiing returned tan
•—and some even peeling. On warm
days at the snow some of the more con
fident skiiers ski in bathing suits for an
all over tan. Either brown skin or no
skin at all.
Getting back on campus, the ever pop
ular white shorts and the so-called clam
diggers or pedal pushers are favored for
tennis, golf, and bike riding.
With 1.9 times two eyes on each little
Indian maid, playtime fashions should
hit an all-time high along with the reg
totals.

popular bathing suit style, Hinks version, at the cardinal and white Boathouss.

Bathing suits are scantier than ever.
Perhaps the French influence more than
shortages has caused the recent trend.
Two-piece suits seem to be the most
popular this season, and they range
from simple solid colors to gay stripes
and flowered models with rhumba ties
(the little draped skirts that tie in the
front). The boxer two-piece suits pat
terned after men's trunks which were
much in demand last season are even
mor<j popular on campus now.
The one-piece suits seen on sun decks
and at the Boathouse are as varied as
the brief two-piecer. White suits or
those with white backgrounds are fa
vored because of the contrast with even
the slightest tan.
Many of the one-piece suits have bare
midriffs for more sunshine. Among the
newest models are the suits with the
bloomer or diaper effect.
Although cotton yardage is still diffi
cult to find, the majority of the bathing
suits are of cotton. Rayon jersey is also
used for many of the colorful suits.
The material affects the style, and there
fore current fashions have not had the
snugness of prewar bathing suits. Very
recently Lastex suits have been shown
again. Many of the cotton suits are
made of puckerette for a smoothei fit.

Now that gas rationing has ended and
comparatively peaceful times have re
turned it iS easier to go places there
are more cars on campus to go in and
more people to go with, or at least more
people to see you going.
From skiing at Yosemite to sunbath
ing on the deck of the Boathouse, play
clothes rate with importance at this time
of the year.
BREVITY IS THE SOLE . . .
Boathouse fashions are as brief as
possible. Abbreviated sunsuits and dark
glass make up the typical sunbathing at
tire. Straps are lowered by many co-eds
as they attempt to do a little light read
ing or play a few games of bridge on
the Boathouse deck. Although the Lake
is condemned for swimming, it is still
good enough for lots of canoeing.
Every women's hall on campus boasts
of its sun deck or back yard where those
who were able to plan a schedule with
out afternoon classes catch up on their
sleep or gather with their typewriters,
books, and cards for a few hours of leis
ure.
