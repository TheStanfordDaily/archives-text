# Play Clothes Accent Brevity, Brightness
## 
### 
Play clothes are accenting brevity and
bright colors this year. Bare shoulders,
bare backs, bare midrifts, and bare legs
are in the front of the fashion picture.
Sun dresses which can be conve
niently covered by boleros and jackets
are increasingly popular and are shown
in a wide variety of styles. A variation
is the single bare shoulder although
most of the dresses are sleeveless and
have bare backs. Bare midrifi dresses
are also being worn in increasing num
bers.
Almost complete sports wardrobas are
being shown in contrasting and match
ing combinations. They contain bras,
blouses, jackets, shorts, pedal pushers,
slackj, skirts or any combination of
them. They provide a great variety of
outfits and for quick changes from Quad
to Boathouse costumes.
Popular for Quad or play wear are
peasant skirts and blousea. Untnual
fabrics -hand woven Guatemalan cot
tons, Indian prints. Chintz diapery goods
are smart and new. Tiers and ruffled

flounces show the definite peasant in
j fluence. The skirts are topped by fluffy
J low-necked blouses. Although tradi-
I tionally white, the blouses are now be
ing worn in black and bright colors.
The Stanford girls will be gayly
I dressed this year whether she spends
' her leisure time at the Boathouse, or at
J the beach.
