You've seen the cars leave the cam
pusâ€”turtle-backs too full to be com
j pletely closed, racks loaded with var
nished, well-worn skis. Chances are
J these cars were off to Yosemite or the
| Sugar Bowl, carrying ski club members
or parties hastily organized for one
! week-end in a wintry locale.
Comfort not glamour is emphasized in
Stanford student's ski outfits this and
every year. The newest innovation in
ski outfits is the army parka a bulky,
| oversized "coverall' win a hood bor
| dered by fur to keep out snow and
; wind.
Farm skiers are appearing on the
slopes of Badger Pass in the usual col
orful ski sweaters, waterproof jackets,
and leather mittens. Head coverings
vary from jacket hoods to woolen stock
t ing caps to the regulation jockey-like sk:
1 hats.
Many Farm students tried their Chris
, ties and stem turns in white "T" shirts
; emblazoned with a red Indian head and
I the word "Stanford." This latest addi
tion to ski fashions was started by a
| local Palo Alto merchant.
, Most ski accessories are designed to
give color to the otherwise drab ski
pants. From red boot laces to bright
woolen mittens and print scarfs, color
appears on the Stanford skiers. Even
the plaid lumberman's shirt is not for
gotten in the ski oufits.
After a hard day's skiing, Farm stu
dents are found shuffling around Yo
semite Lodge or similar resorts in fur
lined slippers shaped like the ankle
high ski boot. During skiing, foot cover
ing consists of two or thiee pairs of
socks and boots.
Stanford's ski fashions are varied and
"picturesque." The number of sweaters
and jackets v/orn on the slopes depends
not on a fashion authority but on the
state of the weather.
