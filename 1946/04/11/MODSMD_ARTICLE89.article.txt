# Bearded 'Roughs' Bow To Civilians of 1946
## 
### 
Note: The bathing suit pictured on
this page seemed as far as possible
from the styles worn fifty years ago by
the first women that roamed the Quad â€” |
in ankle-length skirts and ventured
into the waters at Santa Cruz in their I
version of a daring bathing dress. Thus, 1
by way of comparison, we offer a short
history of Stanford Styles.
In the early days of the Farm Ihe dif
ference between the fashionable male
and the fashionable female was more
discernible than it is today.
IN EARLY TIMES- THE ROUGH
The male ideal was the "ROUGH."
Literally, he was "rough." He aggres
sively cultivated a stubble on his chin.
He stood on engineering corner in filthy ;
cords and once-white socks, and en
joyed his view of the "500" passing
from Quad to Post Office.
He was comfortable on Quad, at
dances, at Beltramo's in a straggling j
shirt and cords that like their owner had
reached their prime. Cords that could
not survive the "stand-in-the-corner- j
alone" test were considered dandyish, j
The proudest and roughest of the !
Roughs were those who could not bend '
in the middle without cracking the cor- j
duroy.
FEELTHY SOCKS
The male trouser always ended in a j
turned up cuff midway between the
knee and the ankle. This space was for- ;
tunately covered by the garterless white
gym socks that were never white.
Bells were definitely not worn. The
Rough cut a slice of curtain cord and
wound it around his cofds or cord might
be used for suspenderb.
The psychological reasons for the
Rough and his behavior cult probably
lie deep in male psychology. But it is
significant to say that he went out with j

the ' 500" early in the 30's.
EXIT THE ROUGH
Slacks prevailed for a time, then gave
way to the pantalon moderne jeans.
! Tho mole-skin jacket was replaced by
the wool sweater and color came into
j the "smooth's" life.
Needless to say, as tho Rough was
determinedly and thoroughly rough, the
| Farm queen at the opposite pole, was
as feminine as fluctuating national styles
would permit her.
QUEENS ARE OBEDIENT
She faithfully slit her skirt and learned
I the two-step in 1914. Her hemline went
| up or down as the rest of the feminine
i nation's did. Or it was uneven as fash
ion decreed in the late 20's. But from
time immemorial she has clung to the
! sweater and skirt for class wear.
She maintained her feminity with the
indispensible hat and long stockings on
Quad. She kept her long hair until in
j the 20's, being a member (a conserva
tive member it is true) of the "flaming
I youth," she bobbed hers.
I LEGENDARY SILK HOSE
Slacks came into being and she wore
j them, but not on Quad. Bobby socks too
v/ere frowned upon except during sum
mer sessions. During the war they oust
ed the scarce long ho3e and became the
j custom for daytime wear.
Sweaters once hanging to the hips,
grew snug, multiplied in colors and
numbers, and fell again to the muf
fling shaggy torso-enveloping garments
of today.
NO DIFFERENCE
Today in spring of 1946 we observe
that the queen is indistinguishable from
the rough, both attired at informal af
fairs such as picnics and in the Daily
Shack in rolled blue jeans, pastel sweat
ers, and saddle shols. Only, the queen
i clings to her shoulder-length hair.
