# Campus Cats Defy 'Esquire' Squares

### GEORGE ECKSTEIN 
Vladimir Phraungue, president of the
musician's local G 7 '8, has recently is
sued an olficial edict regarding the
cress of "hip'' musicians. The ruling
appeared in the latest issue of Metro
beat, and we are publishing it here for
the benefit of any "cats' 'on campus,
"1. Pegged pants are definitely on
the way out. Many top instrumentalists
have remarked that pegged pants make
it difficult to withdraw "reefers" from
the cuffs.
'-2. The latest thing in solid sartorial
perfection are lapel-less coats with brass
buttons. Although you may be mistaken
for the men's room attendant at the
' Top of the Mark," many men at the
top of the trade favor these, especially
in vivid colors. Light blue, yellow, and
passionate red are the largest sellers.

3. Shirts are being worrl buttoned
without ties. It has been noticed the
one prominent musician strangled him
self to death when his tie became tan
gled in his trombone. II ties are to be
worn, bow ties are preferable. Gaily
flowered four-in-hands are also permis
sible but only in rare cases when the
musician has a chest cold.
4. Any musician seen wearing a coat
less than finger-tip length will be run
through with a clarinet. Short coats are
definitely forbidden, because many mu
sicians have trouble hiding from the
management the pint bottles in the back
pockets.
5. Hair will be worn long, as usual,
and it will be curled slightly at the back
of the neck. This ruling, of course, is
waived, in the case of bald instrumen
talists.
