# Khaki to Cords-Reconversion Notes
## 
### 
Male Stanfordltes are not khaki
j whacky by nature. The clothing short
age, G.I. Bill, and durability of Army
j issue have caused the Farm to sprout
with field jackets, khakis, and what the
Air Corps calls A-2 (leather jacket to
; you).
And then there are all the ex-looies
; whose civilian reconversion has not
j yet progressed to the point of discard
ing their green shirts and pinks. How
| ever the civilian touch is still there in a
! flashy necktie or two, and a "Rough's"
| jacket.
