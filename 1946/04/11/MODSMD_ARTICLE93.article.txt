# For Men: No Lapels, No Pockets—No Clothes
## 
### 
"How about a nice sport jacket?"
"Here's a beauty. No lapels, of
course."
"No lapels?"
"Nope."
Sk-i-m-p-y—that's the word most like
ly to succeed in describing men's wear
these days. White shirts, of which there
aren't any, are shorter than they used to
be, one pocket is all you get, and the
material wrinkles easily and looks as if
it would rip if your girl friend gave you
a love-tap with a sharp fingernail.
Speaking of shirts, us roughs have to
be content with the veddy shporty
types, which have long awful awful col
lars and are put out in blobs of color
that would make the spectrum blush.
On the sport coat front, we're slowly
getting back to prewar days. That is,
we are if they have your size. Forty

long? Heh, heh, maybe you could smoke
three packs a day and stunt your
growth, but that's unhealthy, so don't
try it.
Suits? They tell me you go in and
order one tailor-made, to be ready tor
delivery about three months later, 01
was it Christmas that man said?
Shoes? Well, we've saddled that,
haven't we?
But now ties, there's something real
fine. They've got millions of them
around, some we wouldn't put around
our neck. The vogue seems to indicate
the natty knit number in a solid color.
They're making 'em in satin too. That's
sorta zooty but they appear to light up
at night and that's nice when you have
a short circuit.
To coin a coined phrase—there's a
clothing shortage.
