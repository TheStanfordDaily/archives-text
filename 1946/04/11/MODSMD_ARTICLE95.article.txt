# Zany Headgear Back in Spring
## 
### 
Towering, beribboned cocktail hats, I
floppy lace-brimmed hats reappear each
spring, when women with a passion for
fashion try out their most daring ideas,
Cloche hats in the 1929 shape still have
a following this year, and sarcastic re
marks from masculine spectators haven't
been able to discourage feminine fans j
of flower-garden hats.
Old reliables are the sailor, box hat,
and the open-crowned headgear. Come
spring Stanford women, ever practical
minded, are likely to choose one frothy
creation, and thereafter choose reliable,
adaptable hats in a basic solid color.
Veils, long and swishy, or bow-tied
close to the face, ad dan air of feminity
and softness to even the most plain of
hats.
