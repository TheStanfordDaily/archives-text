Outside of the necessary accessories
(purses, shoes, etc.) jewelry is the item
with an A-l priority on the accessory
I list this year. Chokers have come in
i with the high-necked dresses and
j blouses currently popular; and brace-
I lets have gained new importance with
| the arrival of cap sleeves and the rein
statement of long gloves in the fashion
world.
One good pin can prove a blessing by j
dressing up some of the sportiest of !
; suits; while jewelry in the hair, ranging
from simple silver clips to the seguin j
; hair bands now sweeping the country,
offer welcome and interesting relief
! when used with discretion.
Shoe styles have remained relatively
I stable, the shank's mare and ballet slip
! per being the only innovations in the
past year that have gained any degree
of wide popularity. The French plat
form has seen recent popularity, and
colored shoes trimmed with nail heads
' and studs have revived with lifting of
wartime rationing.
Gloves are a must for dress-up occa
! sions, and the revival of elbow- and j
longer-length gloves for afternoon and
: formal evening wear has been received
with wide and, what promises to be en
-1 during, popularity.

Snappy-and-bright is the word for Frankie Brown's Lanz suit,
above. Made of yellow wool, it is trimmed with green and red
felt.
.It's a blue evening, indeed, without an attractive cotton sum
mer formal like the one worn by Tish Tebbe, upper left. It comes
in blue with large, white lines crisscrossing the fabric. The flow
ers trimming the pockets add an extra summery touch to this
Livingston's model.
