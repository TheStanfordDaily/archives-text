# For Drab Rooms: Robleites Redecorate
## 
### 
Two chairs, a desk, a dresser, and a
bed equals a typical dorm room. They're
all the same, but turn that Roble room
ovor to Miss Frosh and quick-like-a-fox
that room will soon develop "swoosh,"
thrifty, personality-plus, smooth, or just
plain livable character traits.
By combining an inventive mind, a
decorative flair, and not a little work
Marge Forkner has transformed her al
lotted space into an attractive example

of "swoosh." the ultra in decoration.
The color scheme, in true Stanford
; spirit, is red and is carried out in a red
string rug, red pillows trimmed with
white upholstery fringe, red bulletin
; boards hung from the molding by wide
i red grosgrain ribbon, and red lamp
; shades with white fringe.
i The round bulletin boards, cut down
from rectangular ones, covered with red
blotter paper and circled with white

fringe, make an attractive background
for snapshots and are also in keeping
with the round mirror. By using two
sets of draperies, one set hung straight
and the other draped across the top to i
form a valance, Marge has dressed up
her full length window.
Sprouting sweet potatoes are favorites 1
for providing that back-to-nature atmos
phere in Roble rooms. A potato sup
ported by needles in a jar of water will

sprout in abonut two weeks. When the
jar is hung from the molding by per
haps a bright ribbon, the fast-growing
shoots can be trained to climb around
the window.
Whether plain or fancy the ever-pres
ent and essential bulletin boards are
loaded with snaps, match books, paper
napkins, programs, bids, remnants of
dance decorations, clippings, and even
rooters caps. Trimmed wkith perky rib

bon or outlined with a ruffle, each pir.
up board lends a spark of individuality
and personality to the room.
"Pash curtains" so dubbed because
Varga girls and pictures from the "Back
Home for Keeps" series adorn them, are
one of the latest products of the inver.
tive female mind. The lass with morj
photographs in folders than she has
room for on her dresser uses her drap
eries for a background for her pin ups
