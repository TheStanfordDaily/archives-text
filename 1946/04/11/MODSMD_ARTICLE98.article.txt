# Painting the Peninsula (Stanford) Red
## 
### 
Susie Stanford is a very wise and
practical girl. Her bawlout average may
not be quite Phi Bete, but her taste in
clothes is above reproach. She can turn
her shopping suit into a date-time bait
with the flick of a taffeta ascot or the
addition of a jeweled giraffe. Susie can
transfer a basic black dress to a Main
bocher creation by attaching a satin pep
lum or adding a bright bolero.
The constant ring of Susie's telephone

is ample reward for her careful selec
tion of date dresses. Whether it's Fred,
j the smooth senior from Tyler, or Joe,
| the Happy-go-lucky frosh at Encina, Su
sie has a dress for all.
Our Stanford girl knows that a date
| on campus or in Paly requires a dress
she can "dress down"; her more elab
i orate date clothes are saved for those
â–  "special" evenings in San Francisco.
When Joe, always making dates the
1 last minute, called at 6 to say that he
| would pick her up at 7:30 for a movie
j and coke in Paly, our Susie, on this
j warm spring evening, slips into a cool
I brown and white linen which does dou
| ble duty in the daytime on Quad. She
i discards her saddles for a pair of shanks

and throws one of the newest "shortie"
coats in forest green with a high col
lar over her shoulders. Her hair is kept
neatly in place by a brown velvet band.
A nippy evening in April finds little
Susie dressing for a fireside at Tyler.
She has donned the gray skirt of her
wool suit and has replaced the jacket
by a cap sleeved jersey blouse in
canary yellow. A black belt scattered
with nailheads hugs her waist and low
heeled black suede shoes are laying
on her bed.
Joe's one-week-in-advance invitation
to the Reg dance has given Susie an
unexpected chance to plan down to de
tail just what would be most effective
and suitable to wear at this all-campus

dance. She knows from previous expe
riences that everything is worn to Reg
dances from bobby socks to black. Su
sie decides wisely that she will strike a
happy medium in simply-cut print dress
with a keyhole neckline and cap
sleeves.
Susie had been planning on her city
date with Fred for the laJit month. Din
ner at the St. Francis, dancing at the
Mark it all sounded wonderful to Su
sie after a quarter of quiet Farm life.
Fred nodded approvingly at her black
crepe with a "V" neckline, a straight
skirt, and a fold around the hips. The
new bracelet sleeves made an appropri
ate background for a huge gold link
bracelet. Her new spring hat was one

oi the new bonnet-cloches of straw hi aid
Though it was the weekend before
finals, Susie couldn't say ' no" when
Joe told her that his patents had given
him two tickets to "Bloomer Girl.' She
slipped into a tan worsted suit with a
neat high collar, rounded shoulders, and
the new popular short jacket. A head
hugging felt casque in biown adopted
from those worn by the Bolivian Indians
matched her brown shoes and purse.
The "piece de resistance" of the
Farm's social life, the Senior Ball, found
our Stanford belle on the arm of Senior
Fred who beamed down admiringly at
the little maid dressed in a white one
demier rayon inspired by fiesta time in
Mexico.
