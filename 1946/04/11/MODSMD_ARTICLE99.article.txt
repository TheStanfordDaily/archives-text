# Tops Down For Spring Formality
## 
### 
Coeods are peeling off their long
winter woolens and hanging them up
in the closet for a long summer's nap.
For as it must to everyone, SPRING has
come to the Stanford woman.
And with peace here with a ven
geance, formals have gone sky-high in
popularity and the cotton tormal has ar
rived with the explosive impact of an
atomic bomb (or a July firecracker).
In spite of the fact that present day
prices on the cotton market are almost
prohibitive where guality is included,
dont be worried cotton formals ARE
available.
PROLETARIAN TREND
Fashions are winking an eye at mod
esty and are cutting the necklines low
er and lower. Cagey in this respect are
peasant blouses worn with long peas
ant skirts gaily bedecked with splashy
flower prints.
On the more restrained peasant side
are solid color pastel skirts trimmed
with dark rick-rack braid or eyelet em
broidery or both. Fluffy and feminine
are the words for these.
Designers have come through with an
answer in cotton for the would-be Si
mone Legreete. Sleek, smart ginghams
and chambrays, sometimes trimmed with
sequins, and other sophisticated styles
give that shmo-o-o-oth look to a cotton
formal.
FABRIC VARIETIES
Chintz flowered, striped, plaid, cir
cled, and jet-propelled is an inspired
fabric for formal skirts. They can't be
beat for that schmurz look that is neat
with a capital R.
Springiest of all are the traditional
dimity and dotted swiss dresses. Fluffy
as a spring cloud, they are perennial
favorites.
Perhaps the most popular of all cot
ton formal fabrics is pique, plain and
eyelet-embroidered, tl comes in a wide
variety of spring colors and retains that
bandbox fresh look for a long time.
DOW AND DOWN THEY GO
Necklines on formals go down. From
the traditional sweetheart to the square
or U-shaped peasant style, they dip.
Still to find their way down in current
popular stylos are the French waist
ilne neckline, and the recent Hollywood
creation by Designer Renie.
Caps sleeves or no sleeves are cur
rent favorites, but large puffed sleeves
are appearing under the Parisian influ
ence.

prices on the cotton market are almost
prohibitive where guality is included,
dont be worried cotton formals ARE
available.
PROLETARIAN TREND
Fashions are winking an eye at mod
esty and are cutting the necklines low
er and lower. Cagey in this respect are
peasant blouses worn with long peas
ant skirts gaily bedecked with splashy
flower prints.
On the more restrained peasant side
are solid color pastel skirts trimmed
with dark rick-rack braid or eyelet em
broidery or both. Fluffy and feminine
are the words for these.
Designers have come through with an
answer in cotton for the would-be Si
mone Legreete. Sleek, smart ginghams
and chambrays, sometimes trimmed with
sequins, and other sophisticated styles
give that shmo-o-o-oth look to a cotton
formal.
FABRIC VARIETIES
Chintz flowered, striped, plaid, cir
cled, and jet-propelled is an inspired
fabric for formal skirts. They can't be
beat for that schmurz look that is neat
with a capital R.
Springiest of all are the traditional
dimity and dotted swiss dresses. Fluffy
as a spring cloud, they are perennial
favorites.
Perhaps the most popular of all cot
ton formal fabrics is pique, plain and
eyelet-embroidered, tl comes in a wide
variety of spring colors and retains that
bandbox fresh look for a long time.
DOW AND DOWN THEY GO
Necklines on formals go down. From
the traditional sweetheart to the square
or U-shaped peasant style, they dip.
Still to find their way down in current
popular stylos are the French waist
ilne neckline, and the recent Hollywood
creation by Designer Renie.
Caps sleeves or no sleeves are cur
rent favorites, but large puffed sleeves
are appearing under the Parisian influ
ence.
