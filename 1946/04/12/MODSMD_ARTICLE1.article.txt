of the atulior's native land in the
recent discussions of the U.N. Se
curity Council. Ka/.emzadeh is

where his father was stationed as
a representative of the Iranian
government to the Soviet Union.

The recent international develop
ments connected with Iran necessi
tate a fuller presentation of the
Iranian case to the public. At the
present time the subject is highly
controversial, but an attempt should
be made to see things as they are
and not to place too much faith in
the distorted picture given by the
majority of commentators.
It is obvious that in order to un
derstand the present-day situation
some knowledge of the past is im
perative. Iran is a country with a
long history and a rich "cultural tra
dition. Zoroastrian influences helped
to shape the moral character of
Christianity. The great Islamic civ
ilization was a blend of the Arabic
religion with Persian culture.
Iran was the country where al
gebra was born. Iran's contri
butions to philosophy, astronomy,
geography, medicine, history, lit
erature, and art are innumerable.
However, in the past three hun
dred years Iran has not kept pace
with the progress of Western na
tions.
State of Stagnation
During the three centuries of the
rule of the Qajar dynasty Iran re
mained in a state of stagnation due
to the incompetence of her kings.
The tyranny of her church-state did
not permit any innovations, and
in the 20th century Iranians found
themselves far behind Europe, par
ticularly in matters of technology.
Since the 17th century the Por
tuguese, Dutch, British, and finally
the Russians began their pressure
on Iran. In 1!)!)7 the latter two al
most succeeded in putting an end
to the independence of that na
tion.
However, the Russian revolution
of 1917 together with the Iranian
revolution changed the picture. In
1925 a commoner, Reza Pahlavi,
became Shah, terminating the in
glorious rule of the Qajars. Since
then Iran was on her way to prog
ress. The country was being in
dustrialized. Railroads were built.
Friendly Relations
Irano - Soviet relations have
been friendly ever since the Rus
sian revolution. Iran was one of
the first nations to recognize the
Soviet government. Russia on the
other hand renounced all claim
on any kind of concessions the
Czarist government might have
obtained from the Qajar rulers of
Iran.
This was consistent with the ear
ly Soviet policy toward small na
tions, a policy which was radically
changed later.
Tries to Be NeutiaT
When World War II began, Iran
did her best to stay neutral. Those
who blame Iran for this attitude
should remember the attitude of
the American people toward the
war before Pearl Harbor. In Au
gust, 1941, the problem of supplying
Russia through Iran came up. It
was also feared that in case of a
German break-through in Egypt or
the Caucasus, Iran would not be
able to protect herself, which would
expose the Allies to a grave danger.
The Iranian government was
asked by Russia and England to ad
mit their troops into Iran. A treaty
was then signed, promising to with
draw all foreign troops from Ira
nian territory in six months after
the termination of war against
Germany and her satellites.
(lives Refugees Break
If, during the war, the U.S.A. be
came the arsenal of democracy,
Iran became the bridge of victory.
No spectacular battles were waged
there, but the work done by Ira
nians contributed more to the final
victory than most people think.
Iranians wh*> suffered economic
hardships (even starvation) still
found it possible to give refuge to
thousands of war victims such as
Poles. The share of Iran in the
effort <>l the United Nations was
recognized by all, including the late
Presid rit Roosevelt, who put his
signature to a document which was
to guarantee the independence and
the territorial integrity of Iran.
Wants Co-operation
Iran has always stood for inter
national co-operation. Her record
at the League of Nations speaks
for itself. Iran, for instance, was
one of the few countries which
never recognized the Italian con
quest of Ethiopia.
No U.N. Action at First
When the present Russo-Iranian
conflict arose, the first thing Iran
did was to appeal to the United
Nations Security Council, which
was at that time meeting in London.
Iran maintained that there had
he"M intervention in her internal
affairs by a foreign power, and that
this constituted both a violation of
an agreement and a threat to peace.
The United Nations proposed to
Iran to negotiate directly with the
U.S.S.R. This meant that the U.N.
was not going to take any action.
Big Powers' Veto
By March 2, 194fÂ», the Soviet
troops did not leave Iran, and once
again the conflict came before the
United Nations. Again no action
was forthcoming. No action could
have been taken anyway, because
of the catchy veto power.
As a matter of fact, only conflicts
between powers other than the Pig
Five are under the jurisdiction of
the U.N., and that much only if one
of the Big Five would not have
special interest in supporting a par
ty to the dispute by vetoing action
upon it. It is apparent that the
whole concept of big powers as
against the small powers is injuri
ous to international good will and
co-operation.
When the Security Council de

cided again to postpone considera
tion of the Iranian case, in 48 hours
Iran made an agreement with the
U.S.S.R. It is obvious that this
agreement is to the disadvantage of
Iran, but what was there to be
done?
World Federation?
Iranians are willing to do all they
can to preserve international good
will and peace. They know only
too well that the world is not safe
for small nations, but hope for the
development of an organization
that would be able really to protect
its members.
It seems that nothing short of a
World Federation could solve the
problems with which our genera
tion is faced. If so, Iran, whose
civilization already belongs to the
whole world, would be the first na
tion to welcome the United States
of the World. ,

The recent international develop

tate a fuller presentation of the
Iranian case to the public. At the
present time the subject is highly
controversial, but an attempt should
be made to see things as they are
and not to place too much faith in
the distorted picture given by the
majority of commentators.
It is obvious that in order to un
derstand the present-day situation
some knowledge of the past is im
perative. Iran is a country with a
long history and a rich "cultural tra
dition. Zoroastrian influences helped
to shape the moral character of
Christianity. The great Islamic civ
ilization was a blend of the Arabic
religion with Persian culture.
Iran was the country where al
gebra was born. Iran's contri
butions to philosophy, astronomy,
geography, medicine, history, lit
erature, and art are innumerable.
However, in the past three hun
dred years Iran has not kept pace
with the progress of Western na
tions.
State of Stagnation
During the three centuries of the
rule of the Qajar dynasty Iran re
mained in a state of stagnation due
to the incompetence of her kings.
The tyranny of her church-state did
not permit any innovations, and
in the 20th century Iranians found
themselves far behind Europe, par
ticularly in matters of technology.
Since the 17th century the Por
tuguese, Dutch, British, and finally
the Russians began their pressure
on Iran. In 1!)!)7 the latter two al
most succeeded in putting an end
to the independence of that na
tion.
However, the Russian revolution
of 1917 together with the Iranian
revolution changed the picture. In
1925 a commoner, Reza Pahlavi,
became Shah, terminating the in
glorious rule of the Qajars. Since
then Iran was on her way to prog
ress. The country was being in
dustrialized. Railroads were built.
Friendly Relations
Irano - Soviet relations have
been friendly ever since the Rus
sian revolution. Iran was one of
the first nations to recognize the
Soviet government. Russia on the
other hand renounced all claim
on any kind of concessions the
Czarist government might have
obtained from the Qajar rulers of
Iran.
This was consistent with the ear
ly Soviet policy toward small na
tions, a policy which was radically
changed later.
Tries to Be NeutiaT
When World War II began, Iran
did her best to stay neutral. Those
who blame Iran for this attitude
should remember the attitude of
the American people toward the
war before Pearl Harbor. In Au
gust, 1941, the problem of supplying
Russia through Iran came up. It
was also feared that in case of a
German break-through in Egypt or
the Caucasus, Iran would not be
able to protect herself, which would
expose the Allies to a grave danger.
The Iranian government was
asked by Russia and England to ad
mit their troops into Iran. A treaty
was then signed, promising to with
draw all foreign troops from Ira
nian territory in six months after
the termination of war against
Germany and her satellites.
(lives Refugees Break
If, during the war, the U.S.A. be
came the arsenal of democracy,
Iran became the bridge of victory.
No spectacular battles were waged
there, but the work done by Ira
nians contributed more to the final
victory than most people think.
Iranians wh*> suffered economic
hardships (even starvation) still
found it possible to give refuge to
thousands of war victims such as
Poles. The share of Iran in the
effort <>l the United Nations was
recognized by all, including the late
Presid rit Roosevelt, who put his
signature to a document which was
to guarantee the independence and
the territorial integrity of Iran.
Wants Co-operation
Iran has always stood for inter
national co-operation. Her record
at the League of Nations speaks
for itself. Iran, for instance, was
one of the few countries which
never recognized the Italian con
quest of Ethiopia.

Russia through Iran came up. It
was also feared that in case of a
German break-through in Egypt or
the Caucasus, Iran would not be
able to protect herself, which would
expose the Allies to a grave danger.
The Iranian government was
asked by Russia and England to ad
mit their troops into Iran. A treaty
was then signed, promising to with
draw all foreign troops from Ira
nian territory in six months after
the termination of war against
Germany and her satellites.

If, during the war, the U.S.A. be

Iran has always stood for inter
national co-operation. Her record

No U.N. Action at First
When the present Russo-Iranian
conflict arose, the first thing Iran
did was to appeal to the United
Nations Security Council, which
was at that time meeting in London.
Iran maintained that there had
he"M intervention in her internal
affairs by a foreign power, and that
this constituted both a violation of
an agreement and a threat to peace.
The United Nations proposed to
Iran to negotiate directly with the
U.S.S.R. This meant that the U.N.
was not going to take any action.
Big Powers' Veto
By March 2, 194fÂ», the Soviet
troops did not leave Iran, and once
again the conflict came before the
United Nations. Again no action
was forthcoming. No action could
have been taken anyway, because
of the catchy veto power.
As a matter of fact, only conflicts
between powers other than the Pig
Five are under the jurisdiction of
the U.N., and that much only if one
of the Big Five would not have
special interest in supporting a par
ty to the dispute by vetoing action
upon it. It is apparent that the
whole concept of big powers as
against the small powers is injuri
ous to international good will and
co-operation.
When the Security Council de

cided again to postpone considera
tion of the Iranian case, in 48 hours
Iran made an agreement with the
U.S.S.R. It is obvious that this
agreement is to the disadvantage of
Iran, but what was there to be
done?
World Federation?
Iranians are willing to do all they
can to preserve international good
will and peace. They know only
too well that the world is not safe
for small nations, but hope for the
development of an organization
that would be able really to protect
its members.
It seems that nothing short of a
World Federation could solve the
problems with which our genera
tion is faced. If so, Iran, whose
civilization already belongs to the
whole world, would be the first na
tion to welcome the United States
of the World. ,

Iranian case to the public. At the

controversial, but an attempt should
be made to see things as they are
and not to place too much faith in
the distorted picture given by the
majority of commentators.
It is obvious that in order to un
derstand the present-day situation
some knowledge of the past is im
perative. Iran is a country with a
long history and a rich "cultural tra
dition. Zoroastrian influences helped
to shape the moral character of
Christianity. The great Islamic civ
ilization was a blend of the Arabic
religion with Persian culture.
Iran was the country where al
gebra was born. Iran's contri
butions to philosophy, astronomy,
geography, medicine, history, lit
erature, and art are innumerable.
However, in the past three hun
dred years Iran has not kept pace
with the progress of Western na
tions.
State of Stagnation
During the three centuries of the
rule of the Qajar dynasty Iran re
mained in a state of stagnation due
to the incompetence of her kings.
The tyranny of her church-state did
not permit any innovations, and
in the 20th century Iranians found
themselves far behind Europe, par
ticularly in matters of technology.
Since the 17th century the Por
tuguese, Dutch, British, and finally
the Russians began their pressure
on Iran. In 1!)!)7 the latter two al
most succeeded in putting an end
to the independence of that na
tion.
However, the Russian revolution
of 1917 together with the Iranian
revolution changed the picture. In
1925 a commoner, Reza Pahlavi,
became Shah, terminating the in
glorious rule of the Qajars. Since
then Iran was on her way to prog
ress. The country was being in
dustrialized. Railroads were built.
Friendly Relations
Irano - Soviet relations have
been friendly ever since the Rus
sian revolution. Iran was one of
the first nations to recognize the
Soviet government. Russia on the
other hand renounced all claim
on any kind of concessions the
Czarist government might have
obtained from the Qajar rulers of
Iran.
This was consistent with the ear
ly Soviet policy toward small na
tions, a policy which was radically
changed later.
Tries to Be NeutiaT
When World War II began, Iran
did her best to stay neutral. Those
who blame Iran for this attitude
should remember the attitude of
the American people toward the
war before Pearl Harbor. In Au

However, in the past three hun
dred years Iran has not kept pace
with the progress of Western na
tions.
State of Stagnation
During the three centuries of the
rule of the Qajar dynasty Iran re
mained in a state of stagnation due
to the incompetence of her kings.
The tyranny of her church-state did
not permit any innovations, and
in the 20th century Iranians found
themselves far behind Europe, par
ticularly in matters of technology.
Since the 17th century the Por
tuguese, Dutch, British, and finally
the Russians began their pressure
on Iran. In 1!)!)7 the latter two al
most succeeded in putting an end
to the independence of that na
tion.
However, the Russian revolution
of 1917 together with the Iranian
revolution changed the picture. In
1925 a commoner, Reza Pahlavi,
became Shah, terminating the in
glorious rule of the Qajars. Since
then Iran was on her way to prog
ress. The country was being in
dustrialized. Railroads were built.
Friendly Relations
Irano - Soviet relations have
been friendly ever since the Rus
sian revolution. Iran was one of
the first nations to recognize the
Soviet government. Russia on the
other hand renounced all claim
on any kind of concessions the
Czarist government might have
obtained from the Qajar rulers of
Iran.
This was consistent with the ear
ly Soviet policy toward small na
tions, a policy which was radically
changed later.
Tries to Be NeutiaT
When World War II began, Iran
did her best to stay neutral. Those
who blame Iran for this attitude
should remember the attitude of
the American people toward the
war before Pearl Harbor. In Au
gust, 1941, the problem of supplying
Russia through Iran came up. It
was also feared that in case of a
German break-through in Egypt or
the Caucasus, Iran would not be
able to protect herself, which would
expose the Allies to a grave danger.
The Iranian government was
asked by Russia and England to ad
mit their troops into Iran. A treaty
was then signed, promising to with
draw all foreign troops from Ira
nian territory in six months after
the termination of war against
Germany and her satellites.
(lives Refugees Break
If, during the war, the U.S.A. be
came the arsenal of democracy,
Iran became the bridge of victory.
No spectacular battles were waged
there, but the work done by Ira
nians contributed more to the final
victory than most people think.
Iranians wh*> suffered economic
hardships (even starvation) still
found it possible to give refuge to
thousands of war victims such as
Poles. The share of Iran in the
effort <>l the United Nations was
recognized by all, including the late
Presid rit Roosevelt, who put his
signature to a document which was
to guarantee the independence and
the territorial integrity of Iran.
Wants Co-operation
Iran has always stood for inter
national co-operation. Her record
at the League of Nations speaks
for itself. Iran, for instance, was
one of the few countries which
never recognized the Italian con
quest of Ethiopia.
No U.N. Action at First
When the present Russo-Iranian
conflict arose, the first thing Iran
did was to appeal to the United
Nations Security Council, which
was at that time meeting in London.
Iran maintained that there had
he"M intervention in her internal
affairs by a foreign power, and that
this constituted both a violation of
an agreement and a threat to peace.
The United Nations proposed to
Iran to negotiate directly with the
U.S.S.R. This meant that the U.N.
was not going to take any action.
Big Powers' Veto
By March 2, 194fÂ», the Soviet
troops did not leave Iran, and once
again the conflict came before the
United Nations. Again no action
was forthcoming. No action could
have been taken anyway, because
of the catchy veto power.
As a matter of fact, only conflicts
between powers other than the Pig
Five are under the jurisdiction of
the U.N., and that much only if one
of the Big Five would not have
special interest in supporting a par
ty to the dispute by vetoing action
upon it. It is apparent that the
whole concept of big powers as
against the small powers is injuri
ous to international good will and
co-operation.
When the Security Council de

cided again to postpone considera
tion of the Iranian case, in 48 hours
Iran made an agreement with the
U.S.S.R. It is obvious that this
agreement is to the disadvantage of
Iran, but what was there to be
done?
World Federation?
Iranians are willing to do all they
can to preserve international good
will and peace. They know only
too well that the world is not safe
for small nations, but hope for the
development of an organization
that would be able really to protect
its members.
It seems that nothing short of a
World Federation could solve the
problems with which our genera
tion is faced. If so, Iran, whose
civilization already belongs to the
whole world, would be the first na
tion to welcome the United States
of the World. ,
