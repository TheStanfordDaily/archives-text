('Hie following article was writ
ten by Firuz Kazcm/adch as a
first-hand account of llie position
of the atulior's native land in the
recent discussions of the U.N. Se
curity Council. Ka/.emzadeh is
fitted to write such an explana
tion not only hy virtue of his be
ing an Iranian citizen hut also
because he received his high
school education in Moscow
where his father was stationed as
a representative of the Iranian
government to the Soviet Union.
For the past two years Kazcmza

ford, majoring in political sci

The recent international develop
ments connected with Iran necessi
tate a fuller presentation of the
Iranian case to the public. At the
present time the subject is highly
controversial, but an attempt should
be made to see things as they are
and not to place too much faith in
the distorted picture given by the
majority of commentators.
It is obvious that in order to un
derstand the present-day situation
some knowledge of the past is im
perative. Iran is a country with a
long history and a rich "cultural tra
dition. Zoroastrian influences helped
to shape the moral character of
Christianity. The great Islamic civ
ilization was a blend of the Arabic
religion with Persian culture.
Iran was the country where al
gebra was born. Iran's contri
butions to philosophy, astronomy,
geography, medicine, history, lit
erature, and art are innumerable.
However, in the past three hun
dred years Iran has not kept pace
with the progress of Western na
tions.
State of Stagnation
During the three centuries of the
rule of the Qajar dynasty Iran re
mained in a state of stagnation due
to the incompetence of her kings.
The tyranny of her church-state did
not permit any innovations, and
in the 20th century Iranians found
themselves far behind Europe, par
ticularly in matters of technology.
Since the 17th century the Por
tuguese, Dutch, British, and finally
the Russians began their pressure
on Iran. In 1!)!)7 the latter two al
most succeeded in putting an end
to the independence of that na
tion.
However, the Russian revolution
of 1917 together with the Iranian
revolution changed the picture. In
1925 a commoner, Reza Pahlavi,
became Shah, terminating the in
glorious rule of the Qajars. Since
then Iran was on her way to prog
ress. The country was being in
dustrialized. Railroads were built.
Friendly Relations
Irano - Soviet relations have
been friendly ever since the Rus
sian revolution. Iran was one of
the first nations to recognize the
Soviet government. Russia on the
other hand renounced all claim
on any kind of concessions the
Czarist government might have
