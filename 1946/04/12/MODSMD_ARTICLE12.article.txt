# Farm Team to Advocate New Labor Board in Stockton Debate
## 
### 
Holding present lalxtr policies
inadequate, a government dispute
settlement board with voluntary
arbitration will be advocated h.y
Wynn Dahlgrcn and Morton Bai
ley, named yesterday as two of
Stanford's representatives in the
Pacific Forensic League contest.
They will enter the discussion
debate, on "What should be done
about labor-management problems
in the United States?" Other mem
bers of the team which will speak
for the Farm in Stockton Monday
and Tuesday include Tom Steege
for extemporaneous speaking and
Ambrose Rosehill. A fifth member
may still be named by Leland T.
Chapin, debate coach.
At the tournament where stu
dents from 15 West Coast colleges
will work toward practical solutions
of labor problems, Bailey and Dahl
gren will stress that there are no
panaceas for the issues at stake in
labor-management relations.
"While most of the difficulties
arc reconcilable through the nor
mal processes of collective bar
gaining, the larger and more

spectacular issues arise out of es- ;
scntial differences between the !
two contending groups. As long >
as labor and management exist j
side by side there will be dis- !
putes."
The Farm team believes that we
have lacked a constructive and j
forthright policy since the end of |
the War Labor Board, and that
President Truman's attempts to set
tle controversies through fact-find
ing boards were unsuccessful be
cause of inconsistency and confu
sion.
"Various industries were con
sidered separately and not as
competitors. This is especially
true in the oil case where the
coal and electrical industries
compete. In other words, there
has been since V-.I Day no over
all continuing policy. '
Favoring the organization of a I
tri-partite Labor Dispute Settle
ment Board along the lines of the !
WLB, Dahlgrcn and Bailey main- i
tain that it should be government
financed, and have the power to
refuse to hear a dispute until every j
other possibility of settlement is I
exhausted.
Arbitration should be volun
tary, because compulsory arbitra- j
tinn without a war-time stimulus
is impossible.
In the long run public opinion j
will be the main factor determining j
success of the board, they believe.
