# Women Vacate Branner; Next Drawing May 6
## 
### 
Because of Hie University's deci- j
sion to shrink Branner completely |
at the end of the quarter so j
that it can be turned back to the I
men, Housing Committee yesterday !
passed the following provision for I
Branner women:
All Branner women who will be ■
upper division students by the end ,
of this quarter and all lower divi- 1
sion students who have lived in j
Branner three quarters will have
preference over their class in room
drawing.
Drawing May 0
Room drawing for fall quarter
| rooms has been tentatively set for
! the week of May 6 to 10, approxi
mately three weeks away. Students |
may draw into Casa Ventura, which
will not be used exclusively for
transfers next year, and Roble will |
be open to approximately 30 to 50 I
women other than freshmen.
Marylou McClure, former Hous
ing Committee chairman, and Phyl
lis Sutherland, present chairman,
will talk to Roble women April 22
| or 24, explaining the mechanics of
! room drawing and reviewing the
j types of living in the various living ;
I groups.
| Housing Committee members feel i
that there should be a class ratio ;
i sy.stem in every living group in j
proportion to the number of women
| in each class in the University, but j
I have not decided how they
will work toward this ideal silua
| tion in the coming room drawing.
| Suggestions Made
One member suggested that the
I ratio of vacancies in each house be
j determined in proportion to the
I number of women in each class
drawing, minor adjustments being
1 made for houses which are ex- j
Iremely ofT-balancc. Another sug
! gestion was that each living group's i
j ratio be as close to the ideal as pos- j
j siblc, taking into account the num- j
i her of students drawing in each
J class. The committee will discuss j
i the ratio again next week.
Miss Sutherland urges all women j
j to turn in their housing polls to j
their house presidents as .soon as
possible, as they will be collected
at Women's Conference Monday.
Unless every student turns one in,
the effectiveness of the poll will be
lost, she said.

men, Housing Committee yesterday !
passed the following provision for I
Branner women:
All Branner women who will be ■
upper division students by the end ,
of this quarter and all lower divi- 1
sion students who have lived in j
Branner three quarters will have
preference over their class in room
drawing.
Drawing May 0
Room drawing for fall quarter
| rooms has been tentatively set for
! the week of May 6 to 10, approxi
mately three weeks away. Students |
may draw into Casa Ventura, which
will not be used exclusively for
transfers next year, and Roble will |
be open to approximately 30 to 50 I
women other than freshmen.
Marylou McClure, former Hous
ing Committee chairman, and Phyl
lis Sutherland, present chairman,
will talk to Roble women April 22
| or 24, explaining the mechanics of
! room drawing and reviewing the
j types of living in the various living ;
I groups.
| Housing Committee members feel i
that there should be a class ratio ;
i sy.stem in every living group in j
proportion to the number of women
| in each class in the University, but j
I have not decided how they
will work toward this ideal silua
| tion in the coming room drawing.
| Suggestions Made
One member suggested that the
I ratio of vacancies in each house be
j determined in proportion to the
I number of women in each class
drawing, minor adjustments being
1 made for houses which are ex- j
Iremely ofT-balancc. Another sug
! gestion was that each living group's i
j ratio be as close to the ideal as pos- j
j siblc, taking into account the num- j
i her of students drawing in each
J class. The committee will discuss j
i the ratio again next week.
Miss Sutherland urges all women j
j to turn in their housing polls to j
their house presidents as .soon as
possible, as they will be collected
at Women's Conference Monday.
Unless every student turns one in,
the effectiveness of the poll will be
lost, she said.
