# About That Assembly...

### 
Because we feel that an all-campus assem
bly held when most stundents will attend —
in the daytime—is more important now than
it lias ever been in the past, we ask that the
Committee on Public Exercise carefully re
consider its refusal of the proposal made
through our ASSU representatives.
Although dismissal of the classes for an
hou; proves difficult for some professors and
interrupts the quarter's schedule, it has been
the custom in the past and we feel it is
nerd d now especially, when a successful
assembly will serve a two-fold purpose:
1) To give push to a student government
that needs it .... to create interest in our
first postwar elections in which top-notch,
sharp representatives should be elected . . .

to provide voters with the information they
need to vote intelligently, a look at the can
didates, and a chance to hear their platforms.
2) To give Stanford students a chance to
get together. The idea of a Stanford Family
is fine on paper, but that kind of tradition has
to be kept alive by just such things as stu
dent assembles, or there's no use in talking
about it.
Now, with so many new students and with
the existing tensions between groups, a
lively, student-organized assembly is in or
der. Nobody wants to yell for the sake of
yelling, but Stanford songs and yelk sound
good to the ears of old and new students
alike, when we've got the fact that we're to
gether again to yell about.
