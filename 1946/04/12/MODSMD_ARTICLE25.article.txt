DEPT. OF SHAGGIER DOGS
Mr. Clancy Thurber, one of our more political
scii jitists, submits the following entry into our
Spring Stanford Shaggy Dog Story Contest:
Arbuthnot walked into Wrydre's room and saw

Wryd playing chess with his clog. Arb has just re
turned from having a quick one, so goes out of the
room to get a breath of fresh air. H comes in
again only to find the dog still playing chess; in
fact it is now in the process of checkmating Wryd.
"Gracious, man," says Arb, "I never saw a dog
that could play chess before. Where did you get
such an intelligent animal?"
"Aw, he's not so smart," says Smith. "1 take
him two out of three games."
THIS IS NO EXAGGERATION
One of the lovelier but more sheltered young
things who arrived at the Farm during the war
was asked the other day whther or not she would
care to accompany the speaker to the Big Came
next fall, to which she replied:
Who's playing?"
