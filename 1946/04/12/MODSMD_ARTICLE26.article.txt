# WHO TOLD YOU?

### STAN SHPETNER 
Take this for what it is worth. We think it is
worth something.
The following is a conversation that, took place be
tween a University employee and a University stu
dent The University employee, dressed in working
clothes picked up the student at the head of Palm
drive.
Worker: Did you fellows read last Monday's
Dippy, WHO TOLD YOU?
Student: You mean Shpetner and Housin?
Worker: Yes, housing (what price glory?)
you know what they made us do the day after
that column was in the paper?
Student: What?
Worker: We had to take a truck and go out to
Interdale School and start getting ready to fix
thai place up for veterans and their wives.
Student: What's Interdale?
Worker: It's a school that Stanford owns. It
hasn't been used for a while.
Student: W 7 hy haven't they fixed it up before
(his?
Worker: The story was that they had no water.
Student: I)o they have water now?
Worker: They had it before and I guess they
are going to have it again.

We phoned a University official who had better
go unnamed if he wants to keep his job. "They've
been working on Interdale for the past six months.
But we just went out there again the past few days.
Who is this?" (The Daily). "Oh, you'd better call
Mr. Brandin, the University business manager." But,
we managed to keep him on the wire a bit longer
and he said, "We got the water working, but we
have no assurance that it will stay in good order."
Evan T. Pugh: We're going to have to bawl you
out. But it's OK, because it is not your fault.
During the last vacation we were sitting on the
Boathouse dock, reading. A friend of ours walked
up and asked us what we were studying. We said,
"not studying, just reading."
'Oh," he said, "reading for pleasure and not as
an intellectual pursuit." Evan, you'd get on well
with that fellow. And that is just the trouble. In
your letter of yesterday, you said (of college wom
en) "only a small percentage of this group will have

any practical use for their education 10 or 20 years
from now."
A lad who has been to college for two years
and is supposed to be doing fairly well lias cer
tainly missed the lioat if he fails to see the con
nection between "reading for pleasure" and "an
intellectual pursuit." Doesn't he consider intel
lectual pursuit a pleasure? We feel that you are
making the same error. A university education
is not only supposed to teach one "how to make a
living" but also to teach one "how to live." "How
to live" is surely as practical as "how to make a
living," although that is not generally recognized.
But as we said, it isn't altogether your fault. You
are not being shown a very good example. Did you
see where the Committee on Public Exercises re
fused to let Excom hold a daytime election assem
bly? They said that it would interfere with the
"academic program." But they added that it would
be all right to hold the assembly in the evening.
That is logic of a rather low order.
In the first place that would mean that the
"academic program" (whatever that is) stops the
minute classes stop. To the Committee on Pub
lic Exercises—our studies after classes are not
part of the "academic program."
In the second place, they fail to realize that teach
ing students to run their government should be as
vital a part of education as learning how to find the
area of a dodecahedron. And that the election as
sembly should be held during the day when stu
dents would be more likely to attend.
There is no third place. But in the fourth place
is the Committee on Public Exercises. They ran
out of the money today. (ASSU president is con
tinuing to hold out for a daytime assembly.)
We find that Kennedy had been trying to get the
Toyon canoes out of hock, before we suggested
that he do so. It is OK with us, Robert. Just as
long as you get them out before winter.
Jus to show that we are not always beating you,
we want to thank you for pointing out to Gloria
Anderson (Excom member who is afraid that the
AVC is a red menace) that, everyone who tries to
advance a worthwhile program is not a "little pink
ish" as she suggested. Heck, Gloria, they might even
be Republicans.
