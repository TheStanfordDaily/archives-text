Footnote to a postwar cultural history of the
United States:
We have heard a lot about people standing in line
for various items in this country, but up till yes
terday we had discounted most of this talk. We
have seen a few short lines in New York and Chi
cago within the last several months, though they
in no wise compared to the huge and hopeless de
pression breadlines we viewed in our Chicago child
hood.
Yesterday afternoon, however, we were bemused -
ly ambling down Market street in San Francisco
when we were brought to an abrupt halt. It seems
lliat at the corner of Market and Seventh there was
a line of people which couldn't decide whether to
continue on across Seventh street or turn Ihe corner
at Seventh and extend on down to Mission.
There were about a half dozen policemen stand
ing at the corner and milling around in the crowd.
The policemen were pleading with the line to make
up its mind.
We looked down Market street and noticed, al
most half-way down the block, that a movie called
Whistle Stop" with George Raft and Mickey
Rooney s ex-wife, Ava Gardner, was playing. "Pub
licity agent sure did a good job," we thought, and
: tarted to walk down Market street's southern gut
ter.
As we walked toward ihe movie palace we saw
that this line extended well past the theatre, and,

leaving our awe of authority in the gutter, we
stepped up to a large, ruddy gendarme and asked
him what all this meant.
He gave us a wry smile and a tired look which
meant that we were just out of it.
Then, as if uttering a magical password, he said
"nylons," and shoved a broad, elderly lady back
into line.
We were convinced at that, point lhat wc had
seen everything.
The line, six abreast, continued all the way down
Market to Sixth with only a brief pause at the spot
where a harried floor-walker at the entrance to the
wonder-store was explaining to several dozen wom
en that the men in the line "might be office-workers
with the day off."
The line, with almost the same density, contin
ued around the corner of Market and Sixth two
thirds of the way to Mission street. There were
women of all sizes, shapes and colors in it and many
of them, together with a sprinkling of men, were
silting on such articles as orange crates, camp stools,
shooting sticks and typewriter tables. We noted
two rocking chairs in line.
A small, dark woman, shortly after asserting her
right to a place in line by knocking us into the
gutter again, muttered to no one in particular,
"some people around here just ain't got no sense
at all."
We crept, away on all fours.

United States:
We have heard a lot about people standing in line
for various items in this country, but up till yes
terday we had discounted most of this talk. We
have seen a few short lines in New York and Chi
cago within the last several months, though they
in no wise compared to the huge and hopeless de
pression breadlines we viewed in our Chicago child
hood.
Yesterday afternoon, however, we were bemused -
ly ambling down Market street in San Francisco
when we were brought to an abrupt halt. It seems
lliat at the corner of Market and Seventh there was
a line of people which couldn't decide whether to
continue on across Seventh street or turn Ihe corner
at Seventh and extend on down to Mission.
There were about a half dozen policemen stand
ing at the corner and milling around in the crowd.
The policemen were pleading with the line to make
up its mind.
We looked down Market street and noticed, al
most half-way down the block, that a movie called
Whistle Stop" with George Raft and Mickey
Rooney s ex-wife, Ava Gardner, was playing. "Pub
licity agent sure did a good job," we thought, and
: tarted to walk down Market street's southern gut
ter.
As we walked toward ihe movie palace we saw
that this line extended well past the theatre, and,

leaving our awe of authority in the gutter, we
stepped up to a large, ruddy gendarme and asked
him what all this meant.
He gave us a wry smile and a tired look which
meant that we were just out of it.
Then, as if uttering a magical password, he said
"nylons," and shoved a broad, elderly lady back
into line.
We were convinced at that, point lhat wc had
seen everything.
The line, six abreast, continued all the way down
Market to Sixth with only a brief pause at the spot
where a harried floor-walker at the entrance to the
wonder-store was explaining to several dozen wom
en that the men in the line "might be office-workers
with the day off."
The line, with almost the same density, contin
ued around the corner of Market and Sixth two
thirds of the way to Mission street. There were
women of all sizes, shapes and colors in it and many
of them, together with a sprinkling of men, were
silting on such articles as orange crates, camp stools,
shooting sticks and typewriter tables. We noted
two rocking chairs in line.
A small, dark woman, shortly after asserting her
right to a place in line by knocking us into the
gutter again, muttered to no one in particular,
"some people around here just ain't got no sense
at all."
We crept, away on all fours.
