CALLING ALL CARDS—to read the fashion edition appearing as
a supplement to today's issue of the Daily. Made possible hy the co
operation of 13 of the Daily's advertisers, this issue is keyed to the
spring-time fashion tastes of Stanford women and men. I'honing from
one of Casa Naran.ia's public telephone booths is Ruth Gumhrecht,
wearing a black and green print dress from Carolyn Kelsey.
