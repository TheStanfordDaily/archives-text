# 'Extend Draft' Gets Approval
## Senate, House Propose Salary Raises, Military Service Limited to 18 Months 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 11 (UP).— I
The Senate Military Affairs Com
mittee today approved legislation to j
extend the draft for one year, grant [
salary increases to service person- ;
nel and limit the number of men !
; who could be inducted.
At the same time, a House Mili- i
tary Affairs subcommittee reeom- !
mended salary boosts substantially I
higher than those proposed by the
Senate group and the House Rules
Committee cleared the way for floor j
consideration tomorrow of the J
House bill to extend the draft for j
only nine months.
The House Military Affairs Com- !
j mittce later approved its subcom
j mit tee's pay boost proposals.
Both the House and Senate com
i mit tees' bills would:
1. Limit the service of draftees j
j now in uniform, and those induct- 1
i ed in the future, to 18 months.
2. Forbid inductions to raise |
Army strength above 1,550,000 on
July 1, 1946. and 1,070,000 on July 1,
1947. The Navy would be trimmed

to 558,000 and the Marine Corps to
108,000 by July 1, 1947.
3. Prohibit induction of fathers.
The Senate bill, which heeds
President Truman's request for a
full year's extension, calls for re
lease by Sept. 1 of all fathers who
wish to get out of service. The
House version would exempt farm
ers essential to food production.
The Senate bill also requires that
the Army make monthly propor
tionate decreases in its ranks be
ginning May 15, expiration date of
the present draft law.
In recommending pay increases,
the House subcommittee ditched its
previous proposal for a fiat $400 pay
raise and instead approved a plan
for raises ranging from 10 to 50 per
cent. It specifically proposed the
following hikes:
Privates, from $50 to $75; privates
first class, from $54 to $80 a month;
corporals, $66 to $90; sergeants, $78
to $100; staff sergeants, $96 to $115;
technical sergeants, $114 to $135;
first, and master sergeants, $138 to
"165.

WASHINGTON, April 11 (UP).— I
The Senate Military Affairs Com
mittee today approved legislation to j
extend the draft for one year, grant [
salary increases to service person- ;
nel and limit the number of men !
; who could be inducted.
At the same time, a House Mili- i
tary Affairs subcommittee reeom- !
mended salary boosts substantially I
higher than those proposed by the
Senate group and the House Rules
Committee cleared the way for floor j
consideration tomorrow of the J
House bill to extend the draft for j
only nine months.
The House Military Affairs Com- !
j mittce later approved its subcom
j mit tee's pay boost proposals.
Both the House and Senate com
i mit tees' bills would:
1. Limit the service of draftees j
j now in uniform, and those induct- 1
i ed in the future, to 18 months.
2. Forbid inductions to raise |
Army strength above 1,550,000 on
July 1, 1946. and 1,070,000 on July 1,
1947. The Navy would be trimmed

to 558,000 and the Marine Corps to
108,000 by July 1, 1947.
3. Prohibit induction of fathers.
The Senate bill, which heeds
President Truman's request for a
full year's extension, calls for re
lease by Sept. 1 of all fathers who
wish to get out of service. The
House version would exempt farm
ers essential to food production.
The Senate bill also requires that
the Army make monthly propor
tionate decreases in its ranks be
ginning May 15, expiration date of
the present draft law.
In recommending pay increases,
the House subcommittee ditched its
previous proposal for a fiat $400 pay
raise and instead approved a plan
for raises ranging from 10 to 50 per
cent. It specifically proposed the
following hikes:
Privates, from $50 to $75; privates
first class, from $54 to $80 a month;
corporals, $66 to $90; sergeants, $78
to $100; staff sergeants, $96 to $115;
technical sergeants, $114 to $135;
first, and master sergeants, $138 to
"165.
