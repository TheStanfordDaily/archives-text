# Truman Hits Navy Opposition Over Armed Forces Merger
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 11 (UP).— I
Prosidont Truman today handed a
stinging rebuke to the Navy's top j
"brass hats" for their continued op- |
position to unification of the armed I
forces, and he implied that disci- !
plinary action might be taken if J
they persisted.
Truman Orders Merger
The President told his White ;
House press conference unecjuivo- I
cally tiiat he, as commandcr-in- |
chief, had laid clown the merger j
policy and that the Navy would
have to follow it.
He also told reporters that:
1. He believes political motives j
dedicated Poland's charges to the
U.N. Security Council against
Spain.
2. He favors federal anti-poll tax j
legislation but thinks the states also j
should act to eliminate that voting j
barrier.
Spending Checked
3. Government spending is on the
downgrade and the country is on
the way toward a balanced budget.
4. The food situation is improving
but the next 90 days will be critical.
Secretary Needed
5. He is looking for a qualified
man for Under Secretary of the j
Navy, the job which Edwin W. |
Pauley tried and failed to get after j
a stormy Senate hearing.
The President was particularly j
outspoken on the unification issue, j
although he refused to commit him
self on a bill drafted by a Senate
Military Affairs subcommittee to ;
merge the armed forces under a j
new cabinet officer—the Secretary |
for Common Defense.
A\ oids Hill Discussion
He said the bill, which envisaged
subordination of the three services
to a civilian secretary without de- j
stroying their separate identities, j
had lots of good points but that any j
further comment on it now would j
be improper.
Warns Navy
But he minced no words in warn- j
ing the Navy to stop opposing mer- !
ger with the Army and Air Forces, j
He said Navy officers still were

authorized to speak their honest 1
opinions, but that his policy had j
been laid down and they would
have to accept it.
