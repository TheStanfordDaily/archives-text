# Indignant Bookworms Get Seats in Libe
## 
### 
Re reserve book room row:
The power of the press, power
of the Stanford I)ailv. that is, son,
was shown forth rightly yester
day following publication Wed
nesday of a letter to the editor by
three students who asked for
benches so they could sit in line
during the rush hours.
When one of the bookworm
bloc entered the reserve book
room yesterday he found three
chairs adjacent to the front desk
on which were neatly placcd
signs bearing the names of the
three writer-inners.
All of which means, son, write
in to the Daily and get results.
â€”Letter to the Editor
