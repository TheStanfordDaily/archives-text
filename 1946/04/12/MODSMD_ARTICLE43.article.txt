# Maps Needed By Red Cross
## 
### 
Palo Alto's chapter of the Ameri
can Red Cross has requested road
maps and foreign stamps which will
be given to service men in hospi
tals. These men need entertain
ment, reports the local chapter, and
Stanford students have been asked
to send in the articles.
Service men want road maps
for planning trips for their first
outings as civilians, or tliey want
to plan the best way to drive
themselves home. Road maps are
still war scarcities, according to
the Red Cross.
The men also want foreign
stamps, rarer American stamps, and
canceled stamps on the envelopes.
Stamp-collecting and stamp-swap
ping with other collectors are one
of the "big games" of convalescents,
says the Red Cross.
These articles may be brought to
the Daily shack at any time during
the day. A box has been placed in
the managing editor's office where
the donations may be placed.
Maps and stamps can also he
mailed in or left with the local
Red Cross chapter, 25 University
Avenue.
