# Farm Student Describes Work As WAC in Hospital Overseas
## 
### BETTY TALBOT 
As a physiotherapist with the |
Army Medical Corps, Ruth Cook, 1
now a student at Stanford, was
stationed for two years in England
j and France. Working at a station
hospital in Essex, England, she
helped patients convalescing from
fractures and nerve injuries re- !
ceived in the war.
Miss Cook, who studied at the |
University of Pennsylvania and
I then spent two years at a school of j
! physiotherapy, worked as a civilian I
i with the Army Medical Depart- i
ment for two years.
Volunteers for Duty
She volunteered for overseas duty
J in 1943 arid, after receiving her
commission in th' j Army Medical j
I Corps, was sent to England on the
Queen Mary in June.
The hospital in Essex where she
i worked had been an evacuation I
i hospital, with no provision for I
physiotherapy. There was no equip
ment and no organization set up to |
take care of patients needing this j
ireatment.
First Air Raid
Miss Cook and her aides had to j
build a department from scratch, |
and to complicate matters, pa
tients began to arrive the day |
after the Medical Corps got there, j
However, within three months
they had built facilities which
cared for 100 to 200 Air Corps
patients.
They experienced their first air !
raid in July, which -they took ner-
I vously but without the seriousness j

developed in later and more intense
raids.
One of the worst raids came on
Dec. 10, when the Germans bombed
an airfield near by. Bombs de
stroyed the light and water sys
tems; without these facilities they
were greatly handicapped in car
ing for the casualties.
The air raids began to slow
down in the spring of 1!)44, but
not before the hospital was hit.
A German plane trying to get
away released its bombs and de
molished half the hospital. No
one was injured, however, be
cause the building was too light
to hurt anyone when it collapsed.
Miss Cook expressed her liking
for the British people. "They are
very reserved at first." she ex
plained, "but it's really a shyness
caused by lack of knowledge of
how to approach us. If you meet
them half way, they will be glad to
go even more than half way with
you."
Oranges Scarce
On a street car in London, she
explained, she was sitting next to
a woman who held an orange in her
hand. Miss Cook glanced at it cas
ually and the woman said to her:
"Would you like half of it? Or you
can have all of it if, you want it.
Oranges are very scarce. I haven't
had one in four years."
During V-E and V-J days, Pic
cadilly Circus was jammed with
people celebrating the war's end.
"They were not rowdy," asserted

Miss Cook. "A few people set off
firecrackers, but most of the people
sang and laughed and danced in the
streets, showing that a big crowd
can be well-mannered.' 'The crowds,
so thick that one could not move,
lasted four days.
Flying in a C-54, Miss Cook
came back to the United States
in the fall of 1045 for discharge.
She had spent four and a half
years working with or in the
Army,
Asked how it felt to be out of
the service, Miss Cook replied that
she was "a little let down." "There
were so many privileges connected
with the uniform that I miss, but
it's good to be able to call your per
sonal life your own again."
"Being in the Army was a very
worth-while experience that I'm
glad I had." she added.
"It makes you realize that so
many previously held values, like
money and social position, are su
perficial. and that being happy,
having good food, having some
thing warm to wear, and learning
tn know and enjoy people are the
important things."

"Being in the Army was a very
worth-while experience that I'm
glad I had." she added.
"It makes you realize that so
many previously held values, like
money and social position, are su
perficial. and that being happy,
having good food, having some
thing warm to wear, and learning

As a physiotherapist with the |
Army Medical Corps, Ruth Cook, 1
now a student at Stanford, was
stationed for two years in England
j and France. Working at a station
hospital in Essex, England, she
helped patients convalescing from
fractures and nerve injuries re- !
ceived in the war.
Miss Cook, who studied at the |
University of Pennsylvania and
I then spent two years at a school of j
! physiotherapy, worked as a civilian I
i with the Army Medical Depart- i
ment for two years.
Volunteers for Duty
She volunteered for overseas duty
J in 1943 arid, after receiving her
commission in th' j Army Medical j
I Corps, was sent to England on the
Queen Mary in June.
The hospital in Essex where she
i worked had been an evacuation I
i hospital, with no provision for I
physiotherapy. There was no equip
ment and no organization set up to |
take care of patients needing this j
ireatment.
First Air Raid
Miss Cook and her aides had to j
build a department from scratch, |
and to complicate matters, pa
tients began to arrive the day |
after the Medical Corps got there, j
However, within three months
they had built facilities which
cared for 100 to 200 Air Corps
patients.
They experienced their first air !
raid in July, which -they took ner-
I vously but without the seriousness j

developed in later and more intense
raids.
One of the worst raids came on
Dec. 10, when the Germans bombed
an airfield near by. Bombs de
stroyed the light and water sys
tems; without these facilities they
were greatly handicapped in car
ing for the casualties.
The air raids began to slow
down in the spring of 1!)44, but
not before the hospital was hit.
A German plane trying to get
away released its bombs and de
molished half the hospital. No
one was injured, however, be
cause the building was too light
to hurt anyone when it collapsed.
Miss Cook expressed her liking
for the British people. "They are
very reserved at first." she ex
plained, "but it's really a shyness
caused by lack of knowledge of
how to approach us. If you meet
them half way, they will be glad to
go even more than half way with
you."
Oranges Scarce
On a street car in London, she
explained, she was sitting next to
a woman who held an orange in her
hand. Miss Cook glanced at it cas
ually and the woman said to her:
"Would you like half of it? Or you
can have all of it if, you want it.
Oranges are very scarce. I haven't
had one in four years."
During V-E and V-J days, Pic
cadilly Circus was jammed with
people celebrating the war's end.
"They were not rowdy," asserted

Miss Cook. "A few people set off
firecrackers, but most of the people
sang and laughed and danced in the
streets, showing that a big crowd
can be well-mannered.' 'The crowds,
so thick that one could not move,
lasted four days.
Flying in a C-54, Miss Cook
came back to the United States
in the fall of 1045 for discharge.
She had spent four and a half
years working with or in the
Army,
Asked how it felt to be out of
the service, Miss Cook replied that
she was "a little let down." "There
were so many privileges connected
with the uniform that I miss, but
it's good to be able to call your per
sonal life your own again."
"Being in the Army was a very
worth-while experience that I'm
