NOTE TO THE B.A.C. Why aren't
baseball programs issued for games
in the Sunken Diamond? The old
adage that "you can't tell the players
from the field without a program" is
still the general rule.
Sometimes a student can recognize
the batter by appearance, but for the
Palo Alto residents —who have been
in the majority lately—just another
player is at bat.
Programs similar to the type is
sued at the two informal football
games last season would suffice.
Several people have remarked to
us about the slams taken at the Uni
versity of Southern California lately.
These people have no love for the
Tommy Trojan West Los Angeles
plant, but since Cal is the tradi
tional rival of the Cardinal school,
they feel it is more apropos to take
some digs about that school.
This writer has no love for Cali
fornia, but to be truthful, an appar
ent sense of purity has entered that
institution. Warren Mangles, who
sports edits the Dailv Californian,
> i

has apparently blossomed into a
good-natured chap, not at all looking
for a scrap. Maybe the feminine in
fluence on the sports stuff—some
thing, thank gosh, that has never
permeated this publication — has
tempered Warren.
But don't worry, whenever War
ren says something we don't like,
this typewriter will start clanging in
protest. Okay?
The story about a group of El Toro
football players coming to Stanford
is a myth. Absolutely. Here's the
dope. Last Christmas vacation, five
Ei Toro men made a tour of the cam
pus. Two players .showed an inter
est in entering this school, and had
their previous scholastic records
submitted.
One player, Ernie Lewis, had sat
isfactory marks, but his entrance to
this school would depend on the
aptitude test grade he made. To this
date, he has not taken the test.
The other player. King, also sub
mitted his scholastic background,
but it showed that he was way short
of meeting the minimum require
ments of admission, which is nine
recommended credits.
Those are the only two men of El
Toro or Fleet City "vintage" that
applied for admission to Stanford.
Any stories that have appeared in
San Francisco newspapers lack foun
dation, and should be discounted.
Fair enough?
Remember Slants mentioning
Block-to-Block last week as a horse
to play? Well—the pony pulled
through, and placed at Meadows
yesterday, paying $5.50 . . . You bet.
