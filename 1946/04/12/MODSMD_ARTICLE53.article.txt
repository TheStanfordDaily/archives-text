# Indian Track Squad Holds Initial Meet
## Coach Weiershauser Predicts That Stanford Should Grab First Place 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
Track, number three of the major
spring sports, holds its inaugural
outing Saturday afternoon when the
Indian scanty-clads play host to the
combined forces of San Francisco,
San Mateo and Menlo Junior Col
leges at Angel 1 Field.
The first field event will get under
way at 1:45, and the initial track per
formance will begin at 2 o'clock.
Admission is free.
Coach Jack Weiershauser's
forces rank as odds on favorites in
this opening setto, largely because
of their preponderant superiority
in the middle distances, weights
and jumps.
The Jaycees show, on paper, a de
cided edge in the sprints and hur
dles. and are even with the Cards in
the broad jump. However, in actual
competition, this early in the season
it is best to forego whatever marks
are listed as "best performance" and
wait for the meet itself. Further
complications arise due to Menlo's
failure to list performances for its
entrants.
Nevertheless, some sort of com
parison is needed, and if by some
quirk al! goes as it is on paper, the
Indians will have started off their
first cinder season since 1942 with a
bang-up performance.
The Cards are figured on top in
the 440-dash (and the mile re
lay); the 880-yard and the mile
runs. Which leaves the Jaycees
to come out on top—unless upsets
occur, and we pray that they do—
in the 100 and 200-yard dashes,
and the 120 high and 220 low hur
dles. The two-mile has been can
celed, it not being a regular Jay
cee event.
In the weights and jumps, the
Weirshausermen apparently have
everything sewed up, with the pos
sible exception of the broad jump.
One man Coach Weiershauser could
gain two first places from is sopho
more George Grimes, who leads the
middle distance field with plenty to
spare. Grimes has turned in a 51.5
quarter and a 1:59.2 half mile, but
will run in only one of the'events.
Stanford's best time in the 100,
that of Martin Anderson at 10.4,
lists the Indians with nothing hot
ter than a third place tie, Ed Bryan
of SF and Will Hcadspeth of SM
having turned in 10.3'5. Bryan's
22.7 in the 220 should give him a
first in that dash, with Anderson
and Carl Hocfner, with 23.6, in
second and third.
If Grimes runs the 880, A! Wil
kins should nab the quarter, his 52.5
putting him close behind Grimes'
time, with Dick Hinze and Bob Ca
redio of SF battling for second. Both
men have been clocked in 52.8.
Grimes has the 880 field spread
eagled, for the next closest time is
that of SF's Torn Kellogg at 2:02.
with Don Lowe and Willis
Schaupp third at 2:05. In the mile,
Frank Ganahl's 4:3(> is far and
away the best time with Jim Folg
er of SF second with 4:49.
SF's Bob Elliott's 16.1 in the high
hurdles gives him an edge over Jack
McCorkle's 16.7. and Bob Pederson
of SF with 25.7 in the 220 lows should
lead Al Vierthaler home, the lat
ter's best mark being 26.5.
The discus should give the In
dians a clean sweep, with Dave De-
Swarte hitting 130, Bob Millington
125 and John Faulkner 120 feet. The
visitors' best mark is Emil Anderson
of SF with 112.
Bob Millington with 47'7" and

Winston Mumby with 43 feet look
like a pair of shoo-ins in the 16-
pound shotput, Anderson's 41-6 be
ing the JC best.
And Mel El let with his 171 feet in
the javelin, followed by Alex Mc-
Gilvray's 151 feet should tally against
the visitors' Bill Bahr (SF) with

148 feet.
Martin Anderson and Bill Lar
son have both clipped 12 feet in
the pole vault, hut may be pressed
to do better by Bob Pederson of
SF who has neared that mark with
11 feet ten inches.
The high jump, howev.er, is anoth
er field that the Cards should safely
tuck away in toto, with Ed Luce go
ing over at 6-4, and George Traub
man and Maurice Drenkel both at
6-3.
The broad jump poses a question,
and the Jaycees may cop two places
in it, for both Stanford's Al Rey
nolds and SF's John Didio have been
measured at 1-6, and San Mateo's
Odo Camerotto has hit 21-4.
All of which above should make
for an exceptionally interesting
track meet, and give one and all
an excellent chance for some early
season speculation as to what
might come off when the Indians
tangle with Cal's Bears in about
six or seven weeks.
The Bears turned back three JCs
last weekend, but didn't look too im
pressive doing it. Let's find out what
the Indians can do against compe
tition of the same calibre.
