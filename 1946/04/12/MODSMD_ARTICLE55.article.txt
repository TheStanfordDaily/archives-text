# The 						Umpire's Verdict
## 
### ART LEVINSON 
A darkhorse in this year's Na
tional League campaign is the Phil
adelphia Phillies. With a new front
office staff, and reimbursed with a
heavy bank account, the Phils have
been on a buying spree, attempting
to get first class baseball men.
Sam Chapman is manager of the
team, and as he said himself, "If my
team finished low, nobody will be
disappointed, but if we finish higher
than usual, there sure will be a lot
of surprised people."
For that one reason alone, Chap
man is in a better position than
Eddie Dyer, new manager of the
Cards. St. Louis has a plethora of
excellent talent, and are already
tabbed to take the pennant. If
they don't win. Dyer will prob
ably be cast aside as a poor man
ager.
Chapman, on the other hand, isn't
expected to do much this year, but
if he happens to upset the apple
cart, he will probably be hailed as
the manager of the year.
One of the new Phils bought last
winter was Frank McCormick, first
baseman from the Cincy club. Mc-
Cormick is a good fielder, and also
a handy man with the stick.
At second base, the starting
player will he Danny Martaugh, a
fancy fielder, and a capable hitter,
too. Skecter Newsome is slated
for the shortstop patch, and Jim
Tabor will get the starting assign
ment at third base.
Those four men represent a good
infield, both defensively and offen
sively. For the Phils, that is about
the best combination in a millenium.
In the outfield are four heavy hit
ting men. Larrupin' Lou Novikoff
will hold the left field position. Af
ter bouncing back and forth between
the Chicago and Los Angeles teams,
"the Mad Russian" is supposed to
have finally found the range, and is
hitting the ball hard.
Ron Northey, with the club last
year, plays right field, Vince Di-
Maggio, a very long hitter, is sta
tioned in center field. Vince, prob
ably the least known of the Di-
Maggio family of baseball experts
is a capable flyhawk, and should
hit close to .1500 this year.
The pitching staff consists of A 1
Jurisich, Tom Hughes, Ken Raffens
berger, Schoolboy Rowe, and Oscar
Judd. Most of these flingers have
played in the majors for a number of
year, and should help the Philadel
phia club considerably.
For the catching chores, Andy Se
minich is the most likely choice.
Last year was his first in the big
circuit, and he performed very well.
The only catch to the Phils' im
provements is the fact that all clubs
are faced with returning stars, too.
But with a team of such caliber as
they have, the Phils shouldn't finish
in last place. Don't be surprised if
they climb as high as fifth.

The only catch to the Phils' im
provements is the fact that all clubs
are faced with returning stars, too.
But with a team of such caliber as
they have, the Phils shouldn't finish
in last place. Don't be surprised if
they climb as high as fifth.
A darkhorse in this year's Na
tional League campaign is the Phil
adelphia Phillies. With a new front
office staff, and reimbursed with a
heavy bank account, the Phils have
been on a buying spree, attempting
to get first class baseball men.
Sam Chapman is manager of the
team, and as he said himself, "If my
team finished low, nobody will be
disappointed, but if we finish higher
than usual, there sure will be a lot
of surprised people."
For that one reason alone, Chap
man is in a better position than
Eddie Dyer, new manager of the
Cards. St. Louis has a plethora of
excellent talent, and are already
tabbed to take the pennant. If
they don't win. Dyer will prob
ably be cast aside as a poor man
ager.
Chapman, on the other hand, isn't
expected to do much this year, but
if he happens to upset the apple
cart, he will probably be hailed as
the manager of the year.
One of the new Phils bought last
winter was Frank McCormick, first
baseman from the Cincy club. Mc-
Cormick is a good fielder, and also
a handy man with the stick.
At second base, the starting
player will he Danny Martaugh, a
fancy fielder, and a capable hitter,
too. Skecter Newsome is slated
for the shortstop patch, and Jim
Tabor will get the starting assign
ment at third base.
Those four men represent a good
infield, both defensively and offen
sively. For the Phils, that is about
the best combination in a millenium.
In the outfield are four heavy hit
ting men. Larrupin' Lou Novikoff
will hold the left field position. Af
ter bouncing back and forth between
the Chicago and Los Angeles teams,
"the Mad Russian" is supposed to
have finally found the range, and is
hitting the ball hard.
Ron Northey, with the club last
year, plays right field, Vince Di-
Maggio, a very long hitter, is sta
tioned in center field. Vince, prob
ably the least known of the Di-
Maggio family of baseball experts
is a capable flyhawk, and should
hit close to .1500 this year.
The pitching staff consists of A 1
Jurisich, Tom Hughes, Ken Raffens
berger, Schoolboy Rowe, and Oscar
Judd. Most of these flingers have
played in the majors for a number of
year, and should help the Philadel
phia club considerably.
For the catching chores, Andy Se
minich is the most likely choice.
Last year was his first in the big
circuit, and he performed very well.
