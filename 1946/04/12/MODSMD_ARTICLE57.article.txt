# Indian Nine Faces Yanks Tomorrow
## 
### STU MILLAR 
Stanford's baseballers will have an
excellent chance to get back on the
win side of the ledger when they
face the Hamilton Field Yankees
on the Sunken Diamond at 2:30 to
morrow afternoon. The Woltermen
will be trying for their first win in
the last seven starts.
The Hamir.ies will field a team
which has also lost more games
than it has won. Their season rec
ord is one win and three defeats.
The lone victory was at the ex
pense of the Santa Rosa Redsocks
by a score of 11 to 0. And that was
the last of the four games the visi
tors have played. So they will at
least trot out on the Sunken Dia
mond with a winning flavor on
their tongues. However the Red

lio.se didn't stack up as the most
.powerful nine on the West Coast..
The losses were at the hands of
St. Mary's, a team that the locals
trounced convincingly in the first
game of the season, Alameda Naval
Station, and the State Hospital.
Leading the Colonials will he
Joe Bergamo. Joe. a pretty heavy
stickman, collected a home run and
a triple in the Santa Rosa slaugh
ter. He is the brother of Augie
Bergamo, part-time first stringer
with the St. Louis Cardinals last
summer.
The other big man at the plate is
Frank Stockdale, shortstop, who bats
in the cleanup spot.
For the Stanfords there should be
a slightly altered lineup from the
Santa Clara debacle. Wolter might
open with Lefty Palisoul although he
hasn't specified his starting hurler
as yet. He probably won't until game
time. Dick Flatland, whose one in
ning appearance against the Bron
cos was encouraging, will be around.
And Bob Rosburg who has yet to be
blasted for a base blow could con
ceivably fit in Wolter's mound plans.


HARRY WOLTER . . .
. . . Stanford's baseball coach,
who will direct his charges
against the Hamilton Field Yan
kees tomorrow afternoon.
