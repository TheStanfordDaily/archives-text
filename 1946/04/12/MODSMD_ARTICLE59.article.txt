# Treasure Island Tennis Team Invades Stanford
## 
### 
With scalp number two safely
tucked away in the satchel, the Stan
ford rack etmen go hunting for more
victories when they collide with the
Naval Training Station team from
Treasure Island tomorrow at 1:30 on
the local courts. Snowing under the
Broncos from Santa Clara to the
tune of 8-1, the Redmen seem like a
good bet in the coming encounter.
In the last two encounters, the
tennis squad present one of the
most potent intercollegiate squads,
along with the swimming team,
that have returned to competition
this year. Though absent from the
collegiate scene some three years
and with no letterinen in camp.
Coach Bugge has whipped up a
strong unit which cannot be taken
lightly by any aggregation.
Little is known of the visiting
group or their relative strength, but
it will afford the Redmen that much
more experience to use when con
ference play starts. The lineup for
the Cards is not definite in the lower
brackets with only the first four sin
gles and the first doubles combina
tion set for the encounter.
Number one man again will be

Arnold Bessier. Thuufe-i absent
from singles competition with
Santa Clara, Bessier did partici
pate in doubles and will he ready
to resume his role as top man on
the squad.
Pint-sized Bob Rutledge will hold
down position two, with smooth
Dave Basham covering the third slot.
Grover Miller, winner in his last
match will play from the fourth po
sition. Basham and Rutledge will
probably take up the chores of first
L doubles. The other singles positions
will probably be filled by either
I Gene Corman, Heath Schroder, Ross
i Hughes, or Tom Frost.
