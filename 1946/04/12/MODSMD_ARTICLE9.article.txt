The pre - election favorites among
the five competing political parties
in Japan's first, democratic election

en candidates drawing an unexpect
edly large number of seats in the
House of Representatives from the
heavy female vote.
Incomplete returns from the es
timated 30,000,000 ballots cast, of the
40,000,000 eligible voters showed the
Liberal party in the lead with 101!
candidates already elected, the Pro
gressives with 60, the Social Demo
crats with 65, the Co-operatives
with 12 and the dark-horse Com
munists with only four seats.
Independents had garnered 67
