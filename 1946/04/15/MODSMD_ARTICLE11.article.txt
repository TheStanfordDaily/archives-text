# Baseballers Beat Yankee Nine 8-7
## 
### STU MILLAR 
Blasting out runs with their usual
facility, Stanford's base ha llers
trounced *he visiting Hamilton
Field Flyers nine by a score of 8 to
7 on the Sunken Diamond last Sat
urday afternoon.
Before a shirt-sleeved crowd of
over a thousand, the Cards took a
quick lead over the Yanks (in what
should be the closest to a World
Seiies Stanford will ever get) and
managed to outlast a late inning
rally to complete Stanford's Satur
day win skein.
Palisoul Stars on Mound
Lefty Palisoul, making his second
mound start of the season, pitched
scoreless ball for five innings and
retired at the end of the sixth with
a comfortable 8 to 1 lead. But Larry
Wolf's offerings proved more tasty
to the Flyers who pounded him for
six runs in two innings and almost
took back the ball game.
The Hamilton;?, determined to
enforce some sort of good neighbor
policy committed seven errors in a
four-inning span to hand the con
test to the Wolter men on a "silver
baseball diamond" but the locals
returned in kind, making all four
of their misplays in the eighth
frame when the Yanks tallied a

quartet of men.
Indians Show Improvement
Aside from this inning, the In
dians played the host, brand of base
ball Keen on the Sunken Diamond
since the end of last quarter. They
batted well, had good pitching and

fielded brilliantly upon occasions.
This is well shown by the two dou
ble killings the Farm nine made.
In the second inning, Buck
Brownson, Wolter's new choice for
first-string shortstop, went high
into the air to spear a line drive
and then quickly threw to first to |
double a runner and ruin an incip- |
ient Hamilton Field rally. And in
the filth, Bob Peters scooped up a j
grounder, touched second and threw
to Merriman for another neat dou
ble play.
McGraw Leads Hitters
Frank McGraw, Stanford's vet
eran catcher, was the titling star
with a perfect day al the piate. In
three trips he collected two triples
and a single. Torn Ward hit two
clean singles, and Palisoul aided his
own cause with a drag bunt and an
infield hit.
Stockdale of the Yanks hit a
triple and a single to lead his team.
Scoring started in the last of the j
third when Stanford racked up i
three runs on no hits. Two free j
passes by Baird and a hit batter by .
baird loaded the bases. Then Baker
the Hamilton Field rightfielder
dropped Bob Peters' fly ball and
three men crossed the plate.
Locals Score on Errors
The Cards added two more in the
fourth when McGraw tripled and
scored on the first baseman's error,
Wickersham walked, and scored on
errors by the catcher and the cen
terfielder.
Hamilton's big inning was the
eighth when two walks by Wolf,
four miscues, and one hit added up
to four runs. But Wolf got tough in
the ninth to set the Yanks down in
order and give Stanford the win.

quick lead over the Yanks (in what
should be the closest to a World

managed to outlast a late inning
rally to complete Stanford's Satur

Lefty Palisoul, making his second

scoreless ball for five innings and
retired at the end of the sixth with
a comfortable 8 to 1 lead. But Larry
Wolf's offerings proved more tasty

Blasting out runs with their usual
facility, Stanford's base ha llers
trounced *he visiting Hamilton
Field Flyers nine by a score of 8 to
7 on the Sunken Diamond last Sat
urday afternoon.
Before a shirt-sleeved crowd of
over a thousand, the Cards took a
quick lead over the Yanks (in what
should be the closest to a World
Seiies Stanford will ever get) and
managed to outlast a late inning
rally to complete Stanford's Satur
day win skein.
Palisoul Stars on Mound
Lefty Palisoul, making his second
mound start of the season, pitched
scoreless ball for five innings and
retired at the end of the sixth with
a comfortable 8 to 1 lead. But Larry
Wolf's offerings proved more tasty
to the Flyers who pounded him for
six runs in two innings and almost
took back the ball game.
The Hamilton;?, determined to
enforce some sort of good neighbor
policy committed seven errors in a
four-inning span to hand the con
test to the Wolter men on a "silver
baseball diamond" but the locals
returned in kind, making all four
of their misplays in the eighth
frame when the Yanks tallied a

quartet of men.
Indians Show Improvement
Aside from this inning, the In
dians played the host, brand of base
ball Keen on the Sunken Diamond
since the end of last quarter. They

fielded brilliantly upon occasions.
This is well shown by the two dou
ble killings the Farm nine made.
In the second inning, Buck
Brownson, Wolter's new choice for
first-string shortstop, went high
into the air to spear a line drive
and then quickly threw to first to |
double a runner and ruin an incip- |
ient Hamilton Field rally. And in
the filth, Bob Peters scooped up a j
grounder, touched second and threw
to Merriman for another neat dou
ble play.
McGraw Leads Hitters
Frank McGraw, Stanford's vet
eran catcher, was the titling star
with a perfect day al the piate. In
three trips he collected two triples
and a single. Torn Ward hit two
clean singles, and Palisoul aided his
own cause with a drag bunt and an
infield hit.
Stockdale of the Yanks hit a
triple and a single to lead his team.
Scoring started in the last of the j
third when Stanford racked up i
three runs on no hits. Two free j
passes by Baird and a hit batter by .
baird loaded the bases. Then Baker
the Hamilton Field rightfielder
dropped Bob Peters' fly ball and
three men crossed the plate.
Locals Score on Errors
The Cards added two more in the
fourth when McGraw tripled and
scored on the first baseman's error,
Wickersham walked, and scored on
errors by the catcher and the cen
terfielder.
Hamilton's big inning was the
eighth when two walks by Wolf,
four miscues, and one hit added up
to four runs. But Wolf got tough in
the ninth to set the Yanks down in
order and give Stanford the win.
