### BOB BULLOCK 
A power-laden Stanford Varsity
tennis squad served notice upon fu
ture Conference opponents that it
was a foe to be reckoned with by
chalking up a lopsided 8-1 advan
tage over the Treasure Island Sail
ors on Saturday afternoon. Coach
Bugge's happy charges breezed past
the Bluejackets without drawing a
deep breath, much to the enjoyment
of a sparse audience at the local
courts.
Juggled Roster Scores
Faced with the problem of re
placing number two man, Bob Rut
ledge, who was suffering with a
cold, Coach Bugge juggled his
squad around to arrive at a win
ning combination. Sole blot on the
afternoon's Indian sweep was Grov
er Miller's heartbreaking loss to Ca
! gan TI in the third position singles,
i 2-6; 6-4; 6-2. Incidentally the see-
I saw battle was one of only two
| matches to go the full three-set dis
| tance, as the victorious Redskins
made short work of their day's ef
torts.
As is becoming a habit of late,
j Cardinal Arnold Belser experienced
' the minimum of difficulty in dis
j posing of his number one spot, op-
J ponent, Rosenthal, 6-2, 6-4. Mcan

result of Rutledge's illness, and pro- '

Hughes Triumphs Easily
Miller's loss to Cagan broke the
"Injun" train of triumphs for a mo- '
ment in the third position. But Ross
Hughes of the Farm came back to i
gain the nod over Roberts, 6-4. 6-1, i
and the Bluejackets were doomed, j
After a tight first set, Stanfordite
Jack Frost "ran out the string" on i
Baker to emerge the victor, 6-4; 6-0, \
in their number fice match. Sin- t
gles play was completed as Keenan,
sixth position Farmhand, posted a
6-0; 6-3 triumph over Cohen of
Treasure Island.

Three blunt and speedy Stanford :

victories were reeled off in rapid
succession as the netsters paired
into double teams. Especially pleas
ing to the tennis fans was the 7-5,
6-2 conquest which Beiser and Ba
sham of the Farm won over Rosen
thal and Cagan.
Hughes and Keenan, not to be 1
outdone, duplicated the scoring by !
handing Baker and Tuck of Navy
another 7-5; 6-2 loss. The finishing
touches to the delectable rout were
applied a moment later as Miller j
and Frost completed their 6-2; 6-1
shellacking of the Treasure Island '
team of Cohen and Roberts.
