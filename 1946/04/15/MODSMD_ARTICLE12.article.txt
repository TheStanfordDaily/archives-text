### BOB BULLOCK 
A power-laden Stanford Varsity
tennis squad served notice upon fu
ture Conference opponents that it
was a foe to be reckoned with by
chalking up a lopsided 8-1 advan
tage over the Treasure Island Sail
ors on Saturday afternoon. Coach
Bugge's happy charges breezed past
the Bluejackets without drawing a
deep breath, much to the enjoyment
of a sparse audience at the local
courts.
Juggled Roster Scores
Faced with the problem of re
placing number two man, Bob Rut
ledge, who was suffering with a
cold, Coach Bugge juggled his
squad around to arrive at a win
ning combination. Sole blot on the
afternoon's Indian sweep was Grov
er Miller's heartbreaking loss to Ca
! gan TI in the third position singles,
i 2-6; 6-4; 6-2. Incidentally the see-
I saw battle was one of only two
| matches to go the full three-set dis
| tance, as the victorious Redskins
made short work of their day's ef
torts.
As is becoming a habit of late,
j Cardinal Arnold Belser experienced
' the minimum of difficulty in dis
j posing of his number one spot, op-
J ponent, Rosenthal, 6-2, 6-4. Mcan
