his office at the Hoover Library for
a usual day of work. However, the
office quickly turned into an open

ily gathering in the garden of his
home with his wife and their 22
grandchildren. A birthday dinner
was held at the home of the older
daughter, Mrs. Leonard W. Ely.
Dr. Wilbur's main interest outside
of his work and his totem pole col- |

hunch where the good ones can be

his skill.
