♦■be present again this evening to

I scripts arc available, states Janice
| Swan, director.
Rcrcnt Broadway Flay
"Dark of the Moon" recently
I played on Broadway, and has passed
1 its 200 th performance, and is now
touring in Chicago. It is a simple
folk story of rugged mountain peo
ple with folk music and dancing,
j The play is a poetic treatment of
the old ballad of Barbara Allen, a
mountain girl who marries a Witch
boy. Ram's Head feels that this
smash hit will be an opportunity
j to do an unusual script, and pro-
I vide something different for both
; Stanford casts and audicnccs, said
i Miss Swan.
Several Major Holes
There are several major roles for
j both men and women; Barbara Al
len, the Witch-boy and his rival
arc the leading parts, but since
| there are 27 speaking parts, Miss
i Swan hopes that there will be a
! large turnout. The parts of the girl's
family, local lownspople, and neigh
j bors are all excellent roles for char
j acter acting, since the entire play is
about hill people of the L'il Abner
; type.
Several scripts will be available
in the Reserve Book Room today for
! students who wish to look over the
play before trying out. Miss Swan
urges anyone interested in trying
out to come tonight, whether or not
j they have had experience.
