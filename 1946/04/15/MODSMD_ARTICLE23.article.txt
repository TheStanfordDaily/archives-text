# It Ain't the Same...

### 
Synopsis of spring 1944: "The circus came
to Paly the first week of the quarter and half
of Stanford was there chewing on spun candy
and buzzing around the ferris wheel . . .
baseball games up in the Row in the daylight
the government saved for after dinner . . .
the Spring Sing-the Monroe boys with their
derby and coke bottle act . . . the junior water
carnival . . . Con Home Day with a good time
for all in their jeans and plaid shirts . .
Now it's spring again, half way through
April, but the activities and attitudes that
noni nelly go with it have changed. It's diffi
cult to analyze "what's doin' " because most
activities seem to fall outside the circumfer
ence of campus. Wheeling off to the races
after a one o'clock, spending as long as pos
sible of an afternoon at Rossotti's, deciding
to hit the highway every Friday and Saturday
night because the calendar offers nothing
else to fit into the cultivated attitude of over
casualness that almost solidly predominates
those are the things we've noticed.
The attitudes in Spring '46 manifest them
selves in an aversion to basic interests. Bull
sessions must avoid deeper personal issues,
or resolve themselves into superficial wise

guy patter, or don't seem natural unless stim
ulated by the cold wet feel of a beer bottle.
Such superficiality, sadly, has destroyed the
basis for the lasting friendships we learned to
treasure as part of our college experience.
During the war, the cry was "back-to-the-
Farm," either through the sheer necessity of
it, or the desire to keep things here as secure
and meaningful as possible for the men who
would some day return. At present the incen
tive for the old has evaporated; the search is
for something new.
This superciality which has been adopted
at Stanford can be found mirrored through
out a world emerging from war, which did
not know where to turn, how to expend its
energy, in what way to express its gladness
at being emancipated from immediate danger
of destruction.
Looking about at Stanford, we see many
who wish some change could be made in the
whole outline of student thinking, some di
rection given to their every activity as stu
dents. The facts, unfriendly and bold, must
be faced. Can't we as students, as the per
sons responsible, do something about them,
now? —Editorial Board.

Such superficiality, sadly, has destroyed the
basis for the lasting friendships we learned to
treasure as part of our college experience.
During the war, the cry was "back-to-the-
Farm," either through the sheer necessity of
it, or the desire to keep things here as secure
and meaningful as possible for the men who
would some day return. At present the incen
tive for the old has evaporated; the search is
for something new.
This superciality which has been adopted
at Stanford can be found mirrored through
out a world emerging from war, which did
not know where to turn, how to expend its
energy, in what way to express its gladness
at being emancipated from immediate danger
of destruction.
Looking about at Stanford, we see many
who wish some change could be made in the
whole outline of student thinking, some di
rection given to their every activity as stu
dents. The facts, unfriendly and bold, must
be faced. Can't we as students, as the per
sons responsible, do something about them,
now? —Editorial Board.
Synopsis of spring 1944: "The circus came
to Paly the first week of the quarter and half
of Stanford was there chewing on spun candy
and buzzing around the ferris wheel . . .
baseball games up in the Row in the daylight
the government saved for after dinner . . .
the Spring Sing-the Monroe boys with their
derby and coke bottle act . . . the junior water
carnival . . . Con Home Day with a good time
for all in their jeans and plaid shirts . .
Now it's spring again, half way through
April, but the activities and attitudes that
noni nelly go with it have changed. It's diffi
cult to analyze "what's doin' " because most
activities seem to fall outside the circumfer
ence of campus. Wheeling off to the races
after a one o'clock, spending as long as pos
sible of an afternoon at Rossotti's, deciding
to hit the highway every Friday and Saturday
night because the calendar offers nothing
else to fit into the cultivated attitude of over
casualness that almost solidly predominates
those are the things we've noticed.
The attitudes in Spring '46 manifest them
selves in an aversion to basic interests. Bull
sessions must avoid deeper personal issues,
or resolve themselves into superficial wise

guy patter, or don't seem natural unless stim
ulated by the cold wet feel of a beer bottle.
