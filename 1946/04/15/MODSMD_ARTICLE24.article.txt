# Happy Birthday, Dr. Wilbur
## 
### 
When the carillon chimes rang out with
"Happy Birthday to You" at noon Saturday,
it was Stanford's way of giving Chancellor
Ray Lyman Wilbur the Farm's best wishes on
hi?j 71st birthday.
When we asked Dr. Wilbur how he cele
brated the event, he said he hadn't been
planning to spend his usual day at his office
in the Hoover War Library; "but they told me
1 had to stay till noon, and I couldn't figure
out why until I heard the chimes ring. I
really appreciated that gesture from the Stan
ford family "
The former University president has been
associated with Stanford since he first came

here as a freshman at the year old institution.
And in his various outside offices, such as the
post of Secretary of the Interior which he
held under President Hoover, he has made
significant contributions toward furthering
the University's name helping to set some of
the ideals and standards which are synony
mous with Stanford.
"I have watched the University weather
three wars—the Spanish-American war, and
World Wars I and II," he said, "and each time
it has come out a bigger and better Stanford
for the experiences it went through."
And so from the Daily, Stanford students,
and the Stanford family, a belated "Happy
Birthday, Dr. Wilbur."—M.S.
