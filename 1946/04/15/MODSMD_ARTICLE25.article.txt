We believe that a statement of the actual resolu
tion PASSED at the National Y.W.CA. convention
concerning overcrowded state .colleges and univer
sities could best clarify the issue. The Y.W.CA. is
;i: ked to support the:
"Maximum use and expansion of educational

facilities as a first step towards a dynamic educa
tion in which equality of opportunity for women
and men wouid be inherent."
And by the way, we ask you to notice that the
words "veterans" and "discrimination" do not ap
pear here.
