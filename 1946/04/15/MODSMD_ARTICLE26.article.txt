WHAT VETERAN ORGANIZATION TO JOIN?
The big "joining" campaign is on.
Fifteen million men and women who fought in
World War II are being besieged by scores of em
bryonic veteran associations of World War II and
by several entrenched vets organizations of World
War I.
By sheer weight of numbers—and ballots—the
new veterans could conceivably control the coun
try's combined political destinies. Multiply these
millions by the family votes which they influence
-and the veterans could become the most poten
tially powerful pressure group in U.S. history,
'this thesis would exist, however, only if the vet
erans would organize and work as a political
bloc. Whether they would constitute a force for
progress or for reaction or whether they would
want to work as a bloc at all would probably de
pend upon the nature of the organizations in
volved.
Of the six million veterans discharged up to
December 1945, only two trillion have joined, the
ranks of vets' groups.
A million have entered Veterans of Foreign
Wars; 650,000 have joined the American Legion;
50,000 have affiliated with Disabled Veterans; 30,-
000 have marched in the American Veterans' Com
mittee camp; 20,000 have registered with AM VETS;
and the rest of the two million have subscribed to
miscellaneous groups. Why have the majority of
men and women not joined a vets' group?
It is reasonable to assume, in the first place,
(hat the vets on campus have immediate inter
ests: finding a decent place in which to live, get
ting back into the swing of school routine, meet
ing the usual monthly bills and insurance pre
miums, and, perhaps, applying for benefits and
hospitalization. Some have new problems—get
ting used to artificial limbs, getting around with
out seeing, or taking certain medical treatments
to correct a physical disability.
11 is when the veteran does some thinking about
civil affairs that he becomes "a political animal"
and his ideas become of strategic importance to
tho "political animal trainers." American democ
racy seems to work through the political phenom
( na of pressure groups and with the military back
ground and experience, the veteran becomes a
member of a pressure group automatically.
The majority of the veterans of World War II
have not joined organizations because, probably,
they do not need material benefits which the vari
ous groups sponsor, or because they do not feel
personally concerned with larger national prob
lems. Hence, the veterans see no need to organize

and bring about political pressure. Rather, they
seem to be waiting for action by the existing groups
in order to judge and if how the organizations "de
liver the goods" before they make their own com
mitments.
The first veteran organization we will consider
is the American Legion. John Stelle, present na
tional commander, asserts that the group is "a
going concern, with 1.6 million members, $15
million in its treasury, and $200 million in prop
erty. With all this, the new veterans could do
as they wished."
The Legion earned prestige by its valor in World
War I and in the peacetime which followed by its
programs such as-child welfare legislation, a pro
gram not limited just, to veterans' children. More
recently, the Legion has aided with the drafting of
the GI Bill of Rights.
Those who criticize the Legion quickly assert that
it has not been auspiciously democratic. They
call it the epitome of pressure organizations dom
inated by conservative and stuffy old men. The
Legion is accused of carrying on strict isolationism
and its counterpart, strong Americanism.
The VFW is the Legion's biggest competitor. It
was born in 1899 and has recruited 1.2 million new
new vets. It accepts only those with foreign service
and takes no women veterans. Its attraction is a
super bonus to be pushed through Congress, allow
ing as a maximum payment, $4,500 for each vet
eran. Again, the opposition states that the old
groups stand for nothing more than the usual bo
nus, the monthly harangue at the post, and the an
nual brawl at the convention.
AM VETS is the largest new group, with worthy
aims and principles, lots of energy, and a constitu
tion and officers. There have been few test cases
from which we may evaluate the stand of the
AMVETS on various veteran and national issues.
The AVC is still on a committee basis, contains
members such as shrewd, writer-speaker Charles
Bolls of one-world principle, Harold E. Stassen,
Bill Bauldin, and Marine Raider Col. Carlson.
'Ihe AVC believes that veterans' problems are
"essentially those of society in general." It is not
for a bonus, for example, because "a bonus is
merely a stopgap in the solution of a larger prob
lem of national full-employment."
AVC has an enemy, West brook Pegler. He ac
cuses it of being "Communist-dominated" and adds
that "it is composed of college boy intellectuals."
It concerns us to check up on the policies and
procedures of the various organizations and to de
cide whether it is in our interest to join one. If we
do join one, it will be up to us to make it "deliver
the goods."

ranks of vets' groups.
A million have entered Veterans of Foreign
Wars; 650,000 have joined the American Legion;
50,000 have affiliated with Disabled Veterans; 30,-
000 have marched in the American Veterans' Com
mittee camp; 20,000 have registered with AM VETS;
and the rest of the two million have subscribed to
miscellaneous groups. Why have the majority of
men and women not joined a vets' group?
It is reasonable to assume, in the first place,
(hat the vets on campus have immediate inter
ests: finding a decent place in which to live, get
ting back into the swing of school routine, meet
ing the usual monthly bills and insurance pre
miums, and, perhaps, applying for benefits and
hospitalization. Some have new problems—get
ting used to artificial limbs, getting around with
out seeing, or taking certain medical treatments
to correct a physical disability.
11 is when the veteran does some thinking about
civil affairs that he becomes "a political animal"
and his ideas become of strategic importance to
tho "political animal trainers." American democ
racy seems to work through the political phenom
( na of pressure groups and with the military back
ground and experience, the veteran becomes a
member of a pressure group automatically.
The majority of the veterans of World War II
have not joined organizations because, probably,
they do not need material benefits which the vari
ous groups sponsor, or because they do not feel
personally concerned with larger national prob
lems. Hence, the veterans see no need to organize

and bring about political pressure. Rather, they
seem to be waiting for action by the existing groups
in order to judge and if how the organizations "de
liver the goods" before they make their own com
mitments.
The first veteran organization we will consider
is the American Legion. John Stelle, present na
tional commander, asserts that the group is "a
going concern, with 1.6 million members, $15
million in its treasury, and $200 million in prop
erty. With all this, the new veterans could do
as they wished."
The Legion earned prestige by its valor in World
War I and in the peacetime which followed by its
programs such as-child welfare legislation, a pro
gram not limited just, to veterans' children. More
recently, the Legion has aided with the drafting of
the GI Bill of Rights.
Those who criticize the Legion quickly assert that
it has not been auspiciously democratic. They
call it the epitome of pressure organizations dom
inated by conservative and stuffy old men. The
Legion is accused of carrying on strict isolationism
and its counterpart, strong Americanism.
The VFW is the Legion's biggest competitor. It
was born in 1899 and has recruited 1.2 million new
new vets. It accepts only those with foreign service
and takes no women veterans. Its attraction is a
super bonus to be pushed through Congress, allow
ing as a maximum payment, $4,500 for each vet
eran. Again, the opposition states that the old
groups stand for nothing more than the usual bo
nus, the monthly harangue at the post, and the an
nual brawl at the convention.
AM VETS is the largest new group, with worthy
aims and principles, lots of energy, and a constitu
tion and officers. There have been few test cases
from which we may evaluate the stand of the
AMVETS on various veteran and national issues.
The AVC is still on a committee basis, contains
members such as shrewd, writer-speaker Charles
Bolls of one-world principle, Harold E. Stassen,
Bill Bauldin, and Marine Raider Col. Carlson.
'Ihe AVC believes that veterans' problems are
"essentially those of society in general." It is not
for a bonus, for example, because "a bonus is
merely a stopgap in the solution of a larger prob
lem of national full-employment."
AVC has an enemy, West brook Pegler. He ac
cuses it of being "Communist-dominated" and adds
that "it is composed of college boy intellectuals."
It concerns us to check up on the policies and
procedures of the various organizations and to de
cide whether it is in our interest to join one. If we
do join one, it will be up to us to make it "deliver
the goods."

WHAT VETERAN ORGANIZATION TO JOIN?
The big "joining" campaign is on.
Fifteen million men and women who fought in
World War II are being besieged by scores of em
bryonic veteran associations of World War II and
by several entrenched vets organizations of World
War I.
By sheer weight of numbers—and ballots—the
new veterans could conceivably control the coun
try's combined political destinies. Multiply these
millions by the family votes which they influence
-and the veterans could become the most poten
tially powerful pressure group in U.S. history,
'this thesis would exist, however, only if the vet
erans would organize and work as a political
bloc. Whether they would constitute a force for
progress or for reaction or whether they would
want to work as a bloc at all would probably de
pend upon the nature of the organizations in
volved.

to correct a physical disability.
11 is when the veteran does some thinking about
civil affairs that he becomes "a political animal"
and his ideas become of strategic importance to
tho "political animal trainers." American democ
racy seems to work through the political phenom
( na of pressure groups and with the military back
ground and experience, the veteran becomes a
member of a pressure group automatically.
The majority of the veterans of World War II
have not joined organizations because, probably,
they do not need material benefits which the vari
ous groups sponsor, or because they do not feel
personally concerned with larger national prob
lems. Hence, the veterans see no need to organize

and bring about political pressure. Rather, they
seem to be waiting for action by the existing groups
in order to judge and if how the organizations "de
liver the goods" before they make their own com
mitments.
The first veteran organization we will consider
is the American Legion. John Stelle, present na
tional commander, asserts that the group is "a
going concern, with 1.6 million members, $15
million in its treasury, and $200 million in prop
erty. With all this, the new veterans could do
as they wished."
The Legion earned prestige by its valor in World
War I and in the peacetime which followed by its
programs such as-child welfare legislation, a pro
gram not limited just, to veterans' children. More
recently, the Legion has aided with the drafting of
the GI Bill of Rights.
Those who criticize the Legion quickly assert that
it has not been auspiciously democratic. They
call it the epitome of pressure organizations dom
inated by conservative and stuffy old men. The
Legion is accused of carrying on strict isolationism
and its counterpart, strong Americanism.
The VFW is the Legion's biggest competitor. It
was born in 1899 and has recruited 1.2 million new
new vets. It accepts only those with foreign service
and takes no women veterans. Its attraction is a
super bonus to be pushed through Congress, allow
ing as a maximum payment, $4,500 for each vet
eran. Again, the opposition states that the old
groups stand for nothing more than the usual bo
nus, the monthly harangue at the post, and the an
nual brawl at the convention.
AM VETS is the largest new group, with worthy
aims and principles, lots of energy, and a constitu
tion and officers. There have been few test cases
from which we may evaluate the stand of the
AMVETS on various veteran and national issues.
The AVC is still on a committee basis, contains
members such as shrewd, writer-speaker Charles
Bolls of one-world principle, Harold E. Stassen,
Bill Bauldin, and Marine Raider Col. Carlson.
'Ihe AVC believes that veterans' problems are
"essentially those of society in general." It is not
for a bonus, for example, because "a bonus is
merely a stopgap in the solution of a larger prob
lem of national full-employment."
AVC has an enemy, West brook Pegler. He ac
cuses it of being "Communist-dominated" and adds
that "it is composed of college boy intellectuals."
It concerns us to check up on the policies and
procedures of the various organizations and to de
cide whether it is in our interest to join one. If we
do join one, it will be up to us to make it "deliver
the goods."

WHAT VETERAN ORGANIZATION TO JOIN?
The big "joining" campaign is on.
Fifteen million men and women who fought in
World War II are being besieged by scores of em
bryonic veteran associations of World War II and
by several entrenched vets organizations of World
War I.
By sheer weight of numbers—and ballots—the
new veterans could conceivably control the coun
try's combined political destinies. Multiply these
millions by the family votes which they influence
-and the veterans could become the most poten
tially powerful pressure group in U.S. history,
'this thesis would exist, however, only if the vet
erans would organize and work as a political
bloc. Whether they would constitute a force for
progress or for reaction or whether they would
want to work as a bloc at all would probably de
pend upon the nature of the organizations in
volved.
Of the six million veterans discharged up to
December 1945, only two trillion have joined, the
ranks of vets' groups.
A million have entered Veterans of Foreign
Wars; 650,000 have joined the American Legion;
50,000 have affiliated with Disabled Veterans; 30,-
000 have marched in the American Veterans' Com
mittee camp; 20,000 have registered with AM VETS;
and the rest of the two million have subscribed to
miscellaneous groups. Why have the majority of
men and women not joined a vets' group?
It is reasonable to assume, in the first place,
(hat the vets on campus have immediate inter
ests: finding a decent place in which to live, get
ting back into the swing of school routine, meet
ing the usual monthly bills and insurance pre
miums, and, perhaps, applying for benefits and
hospitalization. Some have new problems—get
ting used to artificial limbs, getting around with
out seeing, or taking certain medical treatments
to correct a physical disability.
