LOS ANGELES, April 14 (UP).â€”
A return to rationing to help re
lieve Southern California's butter
shortage was advocated today by
Leonard M. Kearns, OPA district
food price chief.
Southern California housewives
will find the future of butter sup
plies dismal unless the dairy indus
try works out a more equitable dis
tribution of butter, and unless re
strictions on allocation of butterfat
are reinstated, Kearns declared.
Total butter shipments to Los An
geles last month amounted to 1,-
299,133 pounds as compared to 3,-
445,084 pounds for the same month
last year, when rationing was in
effect.
