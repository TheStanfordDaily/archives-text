# Mirthquake Felt; Chappie Out Soon
## 
### 
The funniest Chappie since the
one that rocked the Peninsula in
1906 and started the San Francisco
fire will be on sale Wednesday
morning for the price of a shave.
Because of the housing shortage
the magazines will not be sold in
booths, rather in hydrogen balloons
suspended over the Quad and Un
ion.
