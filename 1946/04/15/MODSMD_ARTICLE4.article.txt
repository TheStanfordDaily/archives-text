### 
TEHRAN. April 14 (UP).-The
powerful leftist Tudch party has
staged a successful coup in indus
trial Isfahan, gaining virtual control
of the city and spreading its influ
ence nearly 300 miles closer to Per
sian Gulf ports and British oil fields
in the south, it was disclosed today.
Russian Crisis Over
The coup crcated a sudden crisis
in Iranian government circles at the
very moment government spokes
man Prince Mozaffar Firouz an
nounced that Iran considers the
Russian crisis completely solved
and has "no doubt" that Russia
will evacuate the entire country by
May 6 on schedule.
Firouz also disclosed that nego
tiations with Azerbaijan leaders
will open soon in Karaj and it was
believed the central government,
squeezed between a powerful Azer
baijan army in the north and the
new Tudeh bid for power in the
south, will be under a definite dis
advantage in the talks.
Council May Drop Case
Apparently confident that Rus
sian troops will be completely evac
uated from Iran by May 6, Firouz
indicated that Iran would have no
objections if the case were dropped
from United Nations consideration.
He said the question must be de
cided by the Council itself after the
Iranian attitude has been conveyed
by Delegate Hussein Ala.
