SAN .FRANCISCO,. April .14.
.(UP). —Frank Seward, an 18-game
winner last season, teamed with
long Cliff Melton to give the San
Francisco Seals a clean sweep of
Iheir doubleheader with the Port
land Beavers by scores of 5-1 and
5-2 before a record-breaking crowd
of 19,222.
Portland's two runs resulted from
a wild pitch by Seward that per
mitted two men to score. Other
wise, he controlled the situation.
The Seals started off with a pair
of runs in the third and added one
more in the fourth and a final brace
in the sixth. Hugh Luby, recent
acquisition from the New York Gi
ants, paced the San Francisco at
tack in the finale with three hits in
four trips to the plate.
One of Luby's hits was a double—
the Seals' first extra base hit in
three games.
