# Official Stanford Neglects American 'Good Neighbor' Policy
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
Relations between august Stan
ford and its several South Ameri
can sons form a rather shaky back
drop for the mouthing of idealisms
about the "good neighbor" policy on
Pan American Day,
A series of interviews with the
purposeful, enthusiastic students
who have come here from as far
away as the tip of Chile indicates
that this school, both administra
tion and student body, has in the
past been lackadaisical in its atti
tude toward the foreign student and
his problems.
L - A - C-K-A-D-A-I-S-I-C-A-L
is a long synonym for dumb, in the
light of protestations by various
American universities, including
our own, that the campus should be
in the frontlines in the effort to
push this fumbling world toward
international solidarity.
South American students arc al
most over-careful to preface any
recommendation for improving the
situation with high praise for Stan
ford's reputation. They can always
cite this professor or that group of
volunteer students who, off-and-on,
have helped them to adjust to the
strange mores of the Farm.
Reg Day Confusion
Handicaps Foreigners
But most of them feel strongly
that the official attitude of the Uni
versity is to let the foreign student
"sink or swim."
This approach on registration day
may work for Joe Doakes from
Subnormal High. But one Latin
American student, a baseball fan
of the rabicl variety, expressed him
self in still-halting English as hav
ing felt he had "two strikes and the
dust in my eyes" when he started
through the Reg Day wringer.
At least two suggestions emerged
from the series of interviews:
The Stanford University adminis
tration should sponsor a foreign
students' center, and, when housing
difficulties pass on, erect an Inter
national House where foreign stu
dents could find recreational facili
ties and could center a well-round
ed campus life.
The Stanford University adminis
tration should set up a definite for
eign student counseling program,
including Reg Day supervision from

the time "the bewildered" step from
the S.P. train until they are signed,
sealed, and delivered to the faculty
and residence groups.
Efforts of the International Club
and of various foreign language de
partments to initiate such a pro
gram are greatly appreciated by
South American students.
But as go all such programs, these
depend on the enthusiasm of a mi
nority of United States students
and the varying amounts of time
available for already burdened fac
ulty members to take on a shep
herd's role.

In the words of Elba Munoz, a
sparkling, black-eyed hasher from
Santiago, Chile, "The International
Club must be official, run by the
University. Now the people who go
don't really feel linked to the Uni
versity."
Oscar Ortiz, a serious premed,
was burning the Encina oil over a
composition about this foreign stu
dent problem when interviewed.
He is a good person on whom to
center your thinking about the for
eign student at Stanford.
Ortiz comes from San Jose, Costa
Rica, from the high central plateau
of this country where the glories of
Western science have not yet
reached far down into the popula
tion. Ortiz saw tuberculosis and
other pulmonary diseases cut down
his people.
He is here to absorb the best

medical training Stanford can nive
him and take it back to those
people.
The same can be said <if MirMu
noz, who saw enough Chilean chil
dren crippled needlessly by infan
tile paralysis. She's here for physi
cal therapy, joining with Elena
Vescovi of Uruguay, Lillian Sid
well of Argentina, and others in
studying in this department, which
has spread Stanford's name through
South America. Miss Vescovi will
go back to Montevideo to start a
physical therapy school of her own.

One doesri t need to be a tub
thumping idealist to see that these
South American students have come
here with high purpose. All of them
have fought their way to Palo Alto
through Uncle Sam's red tape the
equal of that experienced by so
many veterans.
They do not want to be set apart,
for that would defeat the purpose
of their coming. To learn English
well, to study America and the va
rieties of Americans available here,
is their goal.
This would not be accomplished
if some administrator suddenly lost
his head and moved aLI the foreign
students into respective national
living units. But these South Amer
icans do need a stamping-ground at
which they and other foreign stu
dents can meet when they choose;
compare notes on the curious Ame
ricano.

They look at California, Colum
bia, Harvard, Yale, and many a
smaller school and find functioning
International Centers, and wonder
why Stanford could not do as well.
