# Stanford Mirrors Spanish Past
## 
### 
If the Stanford student whom the
grade curves describe as "average"
were to dissect his vocabulary, he
would more easily understand the
excellent opportunity available here
for the study of Pan American
problems.
Encin a —Toyon—Portola—El Ca -
mino Real — these Spanish words
which have become standard quip
ment are reminders that the origi
nal administration on this campus
took its orders from Mexico City,
and the only students were a small
handful of land-holding barons and
a slightly larger handful of peon
labor, all liberally intermixed with
the root-eating Indians.
Today, surrounded by sonic ar
chitecture based on the Spanish,
the Stanford faculty and students
continue an active study of Latin
and South American conditions.
Latin American Workshop
An example of the type of work
undertaken was the Latin Ameri
can Workshop which met on the
campus last summer quarter. Un

der the direction of Dr. Juan B.
Rael, in collaboration with the Co
ordinator of Inter - American Af
fairs, workshop students for eight
weeks conducted an intensive sur
vey of the field.
Some :J0 lectures, language con
versational meetings, Spanish-lan
guage films, Latin American exhib
its, and educational tours were in
cluded on the program. Over 30
Latin American experts participated
in the teaching program.
In the Spanish language depart
ment, some 50 M.A. and 10 Ph.D.
theses have been done under the
direction of Professor Aurelio M.
Espinosa, about one-third of them
in Spanish dialectology and folk
lore.
Regional Majors
Piegional majors under the direc
tion of Professor Ronald Hilton are
preparing for commercial and dip
lomatic service. At present students
in this field work for the A.B. de
gree but properly qualified students
may present an M.A. program.
Professor Hilton, who hopes to
expand the regional major activity,
is the author of "Who's Who in
Latin America," of which two parts
on Mexico, Panama, and Central
America have already been pub
lished by the Stanford Press.
Graduate Work
Since the year 1915, the graduate
work in the Spanish Department
has increased. The summer quar
ter was one of the greatest attrac
tions for graduate students during
the years 1920-35. Distinguished
Americans and Europeans were

visiting professors.
Among the great Romance lan- '
guage scholars who taught at Stan- j
ford in the Department of Romanic |
Languages were Professor Navarro
Tomas, the Spanish phonetician and
philologist, Professor Damaso Alon
so, the literary historian, and Gon
zalez Palencia, the famous historian
of Spanish literature and Arabic
scholar, all three from the Univer- j
sity of Madrid, and Professors Gus
tave Charlier of the University of !
Brussels, Belgium, and Jean Ma
rie Carre and Ferdinand Balden
sperger of the Sorbonne.
Of the 35 Spanish majors at the j
present time, about one-third are |
regional Spanish majors, combining
studies in Spanish language and
literature with studies in history,
civilization, and geography of j
Spanish America and Brazil.
Folklore
In the field of Spanish and Span
ish American folklore and dialec- !
tology, Stanford has always occu- |
pied a prominent place under the j
direction of Professor Espinosa.
His "Studies in New Mexican 1
Spanish," published in Europe in j
1910-1915, have been translated
into Spanish and published by the j
University of Buenos Aires in 1930- 1
1934. With the co-operation of the i
American Folklore Society, many j
of Professor Espinosa's students
have collected and published folk- '
tales from Spain and Spanish
America.
Dr. Howard True Wheeler pub
lished folk tales from Jalisco (Mex- j
ico), Dr. Jose Manuel Espinosa I
published Spanish folk tales from !
New Mexico, and Dr. Juan B. Rael,
now associate professor in the de
partment, is now publishing Span- \
ish folk tales from Colorado and !
Now Mexico.
Professor Espinosa himself has \
published in France, Spain, and the
United States various collections of
popular and traditional Spanish
ballads from Puerto Rico, Califor
nia and New Mexico.—Hornby
If the Stanford student whom the
grade curves describe as "average"

excellent opportunity available here
for the study of Pan American
problems.

Professor Hilton, who hopes to

Graduate Work
Since the year 1915, the graduate
work in the Spanish Department
has increased. The summer quar
ter was one of the greatest attrac
tions for graduate students during
the years 1920-35. Distinguished
Americans and Europeans were

visiting professors.
Among the great Romance lan- '
guage scholars who taught at Stan- j
ford in the Department of Romanic |
Languages were Professor Navarro
Tomas, the Spanish phonetician and
philologist, Professor Damaso Alon
so, the literary historian, and Gon
zalez Palencia, the famous historian
of Spanish literature and Arabic
scholar, all three from the Univer- j
sity of Madrid, and Professors Gus
tave Charlier of the University of !
Brussels, Belgium, and Jean Ma
rie Carre and Ferdinand Balden
sperger of the Sorbonne.
Of the 35 Spanish majors at the j
present time, about one-third are |
regional Spanish majors, combining
studies in Spanish language and
literature with studies in history,
civilization, and geography of j
Spanish America and Brazil.
Folklore
In the field of Spanish and Span
ish American folklore and dialec- !
tology, Stanford has always occu- |
pied a prominent place under the j
direction of Professor Espinosa.
His "Studies in New Mexican 1
Spanish," published in Europe in j
1910-1915, have been translated
into Spanish and published by the j
University of Buenos Aires in 1930- 1
1934. With the co-operation of the i
American Folklore Society, many j
of Professor Espinosa's students
have collected and published folk- '
tales from Spain and Spanish
America.
Dr. Howard True Wheeler pub
lished folk tales from Jalisco (Mex- j
ico), Dr. Jose Manuel Espinosa I
published Spanish folk tales from !
New Mexico, and Dr. Juan B. Rael,
now associate professor in the de
partment, is now publishing Span- \
ish folk tales from Colorado and !
Now Mexico.
Professor Espinosa himself has \
published in France, Spain, and the
United States various collections of
popular and traditional Spanish
ballads from Puerto Rico, Califor
nia and New Mexico.—Hornby
If the Stanford student whom the
grade curves describe as "average"
were to dissect his vocabulary, he
would more easily understand the
excellent opportunity available here
for the study of Pan American
problems.
Encin a —Toyon—Portola—El Ca -
mino Real — these Spanish words
which have become standard quip
ment are reminders that the origi
nal administration on this campus
took its orders from Mexico City,
and the only students were a small
handful of land-holding barons and
a slightly larger handful of peon
labor, all liberally intermixed with
the root-eating Indians.
Today, surrounded by sonic ar
chitecture based on the Spanish,
the Stanford faculty and students
continue an active study of Latin
and South American conditions.
Latin American Workshop
An example of the type of work
undertaken was the Latin Ameri
can Workshop which met on the
campus last summer quarter. Un

der the direction of Dr. Juan B.
Rael, in collaboration with the Co
ordinator of Inter - American Af
fairs, workshop students for eight
weeks conducted an intensive sur
vey of the field.
Some :J0 lectures, language con
versational meetings, Spanish-lan
guage films, Latin American exhib
its, and educational tours were in
cluded on the program. Over 30
Latin American experts participated
in the teaching program.
In the Spanish language depart
ment, some 50 M.A. and 10 Ph.D.
theses have been done under the
direction of Professor Aurelio M.
Espinosa, about one-third of them
in Spanish dialectology and folk
lore.
