## Trackmen Tromp J.C. Trio at Will 
### BOB ARMS 
Taking first in all the events ex
' cept three, Stanford's track team
overwhelmed the consolidated ju
nior colleges of Menlo, San Mateo,
and San Francisco, 83 1-3 to 38 2-3
: at Angcll Field on Saturday after
noon.
Although the times, distances,
i and heights were by no means rec
] ord-breaking, the crowd of 2,000
j seemed duly impressed by the early
! season form of the Indians. Coach
I Wciershauser and company were
; even more impressed Sunday morn
i ing, when they learned the results
of the Cal-Frcsno State track meet
j across the bay. Comparing their re
j spective marks thus far, the Car
! dinals should have a slight edge
I over the Bears in the "Big Meet."
i Anderson Nabs Century
Sprinters Martin Anderson and
1 Al Vierthaler started ofT the string
| of Indian victories by finishing one
| two in the 100-yard dash. The time
was 10.2, two-tenths of a second
1 faster than Anderson had run thus
; far in the season.
Bryan of San Francisco came
| through as expected in the 220 with
i the mediocre lime of 22.7. Wilbcr
Ebersal and Carl lloefnrr of the
Farm were close behind in the two,
' three slots.
