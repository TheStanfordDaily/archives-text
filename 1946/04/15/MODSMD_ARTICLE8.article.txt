# Big Red Machine Reaches Full Might as Three Teams Conquer
## Trackmen Tromp J.C. Trio at Will 
### BOB ARMS 
Taking first in all the events ex
' cept three, Stanford's track team
overwhelmed the consolidated ju
nior colleges of Menlo, San Mateo,
and San Francisco, 83 1-3 to 38 2-3
: at Angcll Field on Saturday after
noon.
Although the times, distances,
i and heights were by no means rec
] ord-breaking, the crowd of 2,000
j seemed duly impressed by the early
! season form of the Indians. Coach
I Wciershauser and company were
; even more impressed Sunday morn
i ing, when they learned the results
of the Cal-Frcsno State track meet
j across the bay. Comparing their re
j spective marks thus far, the Car
! dinals should have a slight edge
I over the Bears in the "Big Meet."
i Anderson Nabs Century
Sprinters Martin Anderson and
1 Al Vierthaler started ofT the string
| of Indian victories by finishing one
| two in the 100-yard dash. The time
was 10.2, two-tenths of a second
1 faster than Anderson had run thus
; far in the season.
Bryan of San Francisco came
| through as expected in the 220 with
i the mediocre lime of 22.7. Wilbcr
Ebersal and Carl lloefnrr of the
Farm were close behind in the two,
' three slots.


COACH JACK WEIERSIIAU
SKIt, whose track squad tinned
in a convincing victory over the
combined might of the Mcnlo,
San Mateo, and San Francisco
J.C. teams.
A 1 Wilkins nosed out Bob Ca
redio of San Francisco in a thrilling
race to take the 440 and chalk up
another Cardinal win. Dick Hinze
of Stanford was third.
Card Ace Takes BXO
Stanford's middle-distance ace,
George Grimes, coasted home in the
880 without being pressed at all.
His time was 1:58.1 and should be
lowered even more with better
competition. Kellogg of San Fran
cisco was second followed by Lowe
of Stanford.
Ganahl of Stanford was just 25.3
.seconds over the mythical 4-min
ute mile when he crossed the tape
ahead of Folger of San Francisco.
There was a tie for third place be
tween .Green of Stanford and Boldt
of Menlo, which is unusual for a
race of that distance.
Stanford Quartet Wins
Stanford's mile relay team com

posed of Ganahl, Grimes, Wilkins,
j and Hinze got off to a bad start, but
due to $ome spectacular running by
! Gl imes in the second lap forged
into a lead which they never relin
quished. The time was 3:30.9. which
is an average of 52.5 per circuit.
The High Hurdles was the only
event in which the Cardinal cinder
men did not at least garner a sec
j ond place. Two San Francisco boys,
Peterson and Elliott, finished one
two and McCorkle of Stanford hit
the string for third place.
Vierthaler and Bob Iverson did
| the same trick for Stanford in the
• 220 low hurdles. Vierthaler nego
j tiated the timbers in 25.3, which is
j more than a second better than his
! previous mark.
Larson Soars 12 ft. (5 in.
The pole vault was won by Lar
son of Stanford at the lofty height
| of 12 feet and 6 inchtes. Larson's
form looked very good and this re
! porter predicts another foot by mid
| season. Anderson of Stanford and
Peterson of San Francisco tied for
second at 12 even. Ed Luce easily
won the high jump at 6 feet and
one-half inch. Luce has jumped at
least four inches higher in practice.
Waubman and Barnes of Stanford
tied for second place along with
! O'Connor of San Francisco.
Last of the junior college victories
came in the .broad jump. John Di
dio of San Francisco sprang 21 feet
and inches to take first place.
Reynolds and Iverson, however,
! piled up some more points for Stan

ford by taking second and third re
spectively.
The weights went according to
the pre-meet prognosticators, with
Stanford allowing the junior col
leges only three placings. Bob Mill
ington of Stanford, the only double
winner of the meet, took both the
shot-put and the discus with heaves
of 45 feet inches and 124 feet
8% inches. Mumby was third in the
shot-put for Stanford as was De
swarte second in the discus. Stan
fordite John Thompson took first
in the javelin with a toss of 149 feet
and 9 inches. A 1 Forbes, also of
the Farm, was second.

San Mateo, and San Francisco
J.C. teams.
A 1 Wilkins nosed out Bob Ca
redio of San Francisco in a thrilling
race to take the 440 and chalk up
another Cardinal win. Dick Hinze
of Stanford was third.
Card Ace Takes BXO
Stanford's middle-distance ace,
George Grimes, coasted home in the
880 without being pressed at all.
His time was 1:58.1 and should be
lowered even more with better
competition. Kellogg of San Fran
cisco was second followed by Lowe
of Stanford.
Ganahl of Stanford was just 25.3
.seconds over the mythical 4-min
ute mile when he crossed the tape
ahead of Folger of San Francisco.
There was a tie for third place be
tween .Green of Stanford and Boldt
of Menlo, which is unusual for a
race of that distance.
Stanford Quartet Wins
Stanford's mile relay team com

posed of Ganahl, Grimes, Wilkins,
j and Hinze got off to a bad start, but
due to $ome spectacular running by
! Gl imes in the second lap forged
into a lead which they never relin
quished. The time was 3:30.9. which
is an average of 52.5 per circuit.
The High Hurdles was the only
event in which the Cardinal cinder
men did not at least garner a sec
j ond place. Two San Francisco boys,
Peterson and Elliott, finished one
two and McCorkle of Stanford hit
the string for third place.
Vierthaler and Bob Iverson did
| the same trick for Stanford in the
• 220 low hurdles. Vierthaler nego
j tiated the timbers in 25.3, which is
j more than a second better than his
! previous mark.
Larson Soars 12 ft. (5 in.
The pole vault was won by Lar
son of Stanford at the lofty height
| of 12 feet and 6 inchtes. Larson's
form looked very good and this re
! porter predicts another foot by mid
| season. Anderson of Stanford and
Peterson of San Francisco tied for
second at 12 even. Ed Luce easily
won the high jump at 6 feet and
one-half inch. Luce has jumped at
least four inches higher in practice.
Waubman and Barnes of Stanford
tied for second place along with
! O'Connor of San Francisco.
Last of the junior college victories
came in the .broad jump. John Di
dio of San Francisco sprang 21 feet
and inches to take first place.
Reynolds and Iverson, however,
! piled up some more points for Stan

ford by taking second and third re
spectively.
The weights went according to
the pre-meet prognosticators, with
Stanford allowing the junior col
leges only three placings. Bob Mill
ington of Stanford, the only double
winner of the meet, took both the
shot-put and the discus with heaves
of 45 feet inches and 124 feet
8% inches. Mumby was third in the
shot-put for Stanford as was De
swarte second in the discus. Stan
fordite John Thompson took first
in the javelin with a toss of 149 feet
and 9 inches. A 1 Forbes, also of
the Farm, was second.


El> LUCE, Stanford high jump

overwhelmed the consolidated ju
nior colleges of Menlo, San Mateo,
and San Francisco, 83 1-3 to 38 2-3
: at Angcll Field on Saturday after
noon.
Although the times, distances,
i and heights were by no means rec

j seemed duly impressed by the early

I Wciershauser and company were
; even more impressed Sunday morn

was 10.2, two-tenths of a second

San Mateo, and San Francisco
J.C. teams.
A 1 Wilkins nosed out Bob Ca
redio of San Francisco in a thrilling
race to take the 440 and chalk up
another Cardinal win. Dick Hinze
of Stanford was third.
Card Ace Takes BXO
Stanford's middle-distance ace,
George Grimes, coasted home in the
880 without being pressed at all.
His time was 1:58.1 and should be
lowered even more with better
competition. Kellogg of San Fran
cisco was second followed by Lowe
of Stanford.
Ganahl of Stanford was just 25.3
.seconds over the mythical 4-min
ute mile when he crossed the tape
ahead of Folger of San Francisco.
There was a tie for third place be
tween .Green of Stanford and Boldt
of Menlo, which is unusual for a
race of that distance.
Stanford Quartet Wins
Stanford's mile relay team com

posed of Ganahl, Grimes, Wilkins,
j and Hinze got off to a bad start, but
due to $ome spectacular running by
! Gl imes in the second lap forged
into a lead which they never relin
quished. The time was 3:30.9. which
is an average of 52.5 per circuit.
The High Hurdles was the only
event in which the Cardinal cinder
men did not at least garner a sec
j ond place. Two San Francisco boys,
Peterson and Elliott, finished one
two and McCorkle of Stanford hit
the string for third place.
Vierthaler and Bob Iverson did
| the same trick for Stanford in the
• 220 low hurdles. Vierthaler nego
j tiated the timbers in 25.3, which is
j more than a second better than his
! previous mark.
Larson Soars 12 ft. (5 in.
The pole vault was won by Lar
son of Stanford at the lofty height
| of 12 feet and 6 inchtes. Larson's
form looked very good and this re
! porter predicts another foot by mid
| season. Anderson of Stanford and
Peterson of San Francisco tied for
second at 12 even. Ed Luce easily
won the high jump at 6 feet and
one-half inch. Luce has jumped at
least four inches higher in practice.
Waubman and Barnes of Stanford
tied for second place along with
! O'Connor of San Francisco.
Last of the junior college victories

dio of San Francisco sprang 21 feet
and inches to take first place.
Reynolds and Iverson, however,
! piled up some more points for Stan

ford by taking second and third re
spectively.
The weights went according to
the pre-meet prognosticators, with
Stanford allowing the junior col
leges only three placings. Bob Mill
ington of Stanford, the only double
winner of the meet, took both the
shot-put and the discus with heaves
of 45 feet inches and 124 feet
8% inches. Mumby was third in the
shot-put for Stanford as was De
swarte second in the discus. Stan
fordite John Thompson took first

Taking first in all the events ex
' cept three, Stanford's track team
overwhelmed the consolidated ju
nior colleges of Menlo, San Mateo,
and San Francisco, 83 1-3 to 38 2-3
: at Angcll Field on Saturday after
noon.
Although the times, distances,
i and heights were by no means rec
] ord-breaking, the crowd of 2,000
j seemed duly impressed by the early
! season form of the Indians. Coach
I Wciershauser and company were
; even more impressed Sunday morn
i ing, when they learned the results
of the Cal-Frcsno State track meet
j across the bay. Comparing their re
j spective marks thus far, the Car
! dinals should have a slight edge
I over the Bears in the "Big Meet."
i Anderson Nabs Century
Sprinters Martin Anderson and
1 Al Vierthaler started ofT the string
| of Indian victories by finishing one
| two in the 100-yard dash. The time
was 10.2, two-tenths of a second
1 faster than Anderson had run thus
; far in the season.
Bryan of San Francisco came
| through as expected in the 220 with
i the mediocre lime of 22.7. Wilbcr
Ebersal and Carl lloefnrr of the
Farm were close behind in the two,
' three slots.
