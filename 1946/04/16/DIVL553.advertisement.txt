Make it a HAPPY Easter
(or that Certain Someone!
A BOX OF WILSON'S candy is a sure
fire hit with any girl any time, but if
you want to be a SUCCESS with her this
Easter, present her with a box of "Sticky"
Wilson's best (that's anything in Wilson's
candy).
Ernest "Sticky" Wilson began making
his goooooood candy right here on the
campus fifty years ago when both he and
the University were young. He's still
mixin' and tastin' and cookin' in his beau
tiful candy kitchen in San Francisco. But
his heart is right here on the Farm (as
what old grad's isn't) and he has promised
an unlimited supply of Wilson's candy at
the store in Paly for Stanfordites this
Easter.
