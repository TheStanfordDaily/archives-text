Women's Conference yesterday
passed the following new social
regulations for women students,
subject to Excom approval.
1. Women may take their non
quota Saturday night late leaves
011 cither Friday or Saturday
night: on the other of the two
nights, they must he in by 12 un
less they sign out on a floater.
This decision was prompted by
the full social calendar of campus
dances. Many living groups have
been turned down for Saturday
night 1 a.m. dances because of the
full calendar. Now Friday night
dances may be held until 1 a.m.
Living groups which have been
turned down for Saturday night
dates may apply for Friday night
dances, according to Charmian Ko
lar, A.S.S.U. vice-president.
2. Conference decided that stu
dents taking advantage of their
open living group on Saturday
night must sign out regardless of
whether they are out of the house
or in their house with their date
after 12. They must sign out be
fore 12. If they have their date in
the house after 12, they will sign
in when their date leaves. Stu
dents who have late leaves may
leave the house after 12.
