## Communist Lines Collapse; Chiang Shifts Cabinet 
### 
CHUNGKING, Tuesday, April 16
(UP). —The crack American-equip
ped Chinese First Army has crashed
through Communist defenses at
Szepinghai and is racing to Chang
chun, Manchurian capital, which is
being besieged by Chinese Com
munists, government sources an
nounced.
A Central News Agency dispatch
said the Communist line at Sze
pinghai, G2 miles southwest of
Changchun, had crumbled after
four days of bloody, see-saw battle
j in which thousands were killed on
both sides.
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek
was hastening a reorganization of
the government to include Commu
nists and thus avert the threat of
civil war.
Attack from Three Sides
j
American dispatches from Chang
j chun said the Chinese Communists
| were attacking the city from three
j sides. Communist forces captured
| all three airfields in the area and
: penetrated the city's outer defenses,
| according to a pooled dispatch of
] five American correspondents who
I flew to Changchun Saturday.
The Communists started the at
tack Sunday afternoon, two hours
before the Soviet, occupation forces
completed their evacuation.
Reported Well Armed
Firing has raged continuously
since the siege began on Sunday.
Communists were reported armed
j with artillery as well as machine
j guns, anti-tank guns, mortars, rifles,
j and grenades.
Government sources in Chang
i chun told the Americans that Com
munists were equipped with Japa
| nesc weapons, supplied to them by
the Russians a few months ago.
Chiang Kai-shek Calls Council
Generalissimo Chiang hurriedly
called a special meeting of the Po
litical Consultative Council steering
committee yesterday and demanded
! that the government, he reorganized
j lo include all parties by April 20 in
| conformity with the agreement be
tween Chiang's Nationalists and the
| Communists.
He asked three top-flight govern
ment officials to confer with Com
munist and other party leaders and,
according to reliable sources, told
| them he expected "complete ac
cord" within three days.
j First Personal Intervention
Chiang's action—his first personal
I intervention to speed up govern
ment reorganization — was, accord
ing to these sources, a result of
three developments:
1. The Communist attack on
Changchun.
2. Reports of large casualties in
fighting around Szepinghai.
3. The expected return Thursday
j of Presidential Envoy Gen. Geof'ge
C. Marshall, who is seeking to com
promise Chinese factional difTer-
I cnce and establish a unified China.
