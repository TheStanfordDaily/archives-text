### 
BUTTE, Mont., April 15 (UP). â€”The Silver How County Commission
has authorized Sheriff Al McLcod to deputize 100 extra men to prevent
more violence in the Hulte area, where mobs have wrecked 14 homes
since Saturday night "to show their sympathy for striking miners."
In addition, McLcod reported that the union has agreed that its
members patrol the streets to curb violence. But McLcod said that the
union men cannot be deputized because of a legal ruling against it. The
main force of deputies will be assembled by tomorrow, McLcod said.
Baker Rile, chief of police, reported that several families bad been
removed from the areas in which the trouble occurred. He declined to
give the names of the families or where they were taken.
No arrests have been made because no looters could actually be
caught in the act, Riley added. He said the looters fled at the sight of
approaching police cars.
The wrecked homes wrc those of mine foremen and clerks, not be
longing to unions or affiliated with AFL unions, who did not participate
in the strike callcdlast Tuesday against the Butte properties of the Ana
conda Copper Mining Company by the International Union of Mine,
Mill and Smelter Workers (CIO).
The 000 to 1.000 non-striking workers were kept on the mining prop
erties, living in "topside" buildings or below the surface, and taking
their meals at their work as they manned pumps to keep subterranean
springs from flooding the valuable diggings.
The mobs that spread terror through this mountainside mining camp
Saturday and Sunday nights were composed mainly of juveniles, but
McLcod said they included "some adults, particularly veterans."
