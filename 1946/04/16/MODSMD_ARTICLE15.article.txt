# House Passes Draft, Boosts Service Pay
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. April 15 (UP). —'The House passed two compromise
military bills today extending the draft for only nine months, with a five
month moratorium on inductions, and boosting service pay rates by 10
to 50 per cent to spur voluntary enlistments.
The top pay increases were voted for Army privates and corresponding

grades in the other services, whose
pay would jump from $50 to $75 a
month if the House bill is approved
by the Senate. Passage was by a
164 to 13 vote.
It was estimated that the service
pay hike would cost about $032,000,-
000 a year.
Opposition
The bill was passed in the wake
of a companion measure extending
the Selective Service Act. until Feb.
15, 1047, nine months beyond its
scheduled expiration date May 15.
About the only opposition to
the pay boost came from John
E. Sheridan, D., Pa., who com
plained that it provided a raise of
only $300 a year for buck privates
while a major general would get an
extra $800.
Passed to Senate
The draft extension bill met
strong opposition, however, despite
its sugar-coating amendments bar
ring conscription of 'teen-agers and
suspending all inductions for five
months.
The bill controversy was passed
on to the Senate by a roll call vote
of 290 to 108, after a final vain at
tempt by draft advocates to kill it
by sending it back to the Military
Affairs Committee.
"No Draft" Clamor
With election - conscious Con
gressmen caught between White
House pressure for a flat one-year
extension and a "no draft" clamor
from constituents, the bill emerged
as a compromise that offered little
comfort to the President and the
military high command.
It provides for extension of the
present draft act, which expires
May 15, until Feb. 15, 1947. But it
prohibits permanently induction of
18- and 19-year-olds and orders a
general "draft holiday" from May
15 to Oct, 15.

With election - conscious Con
gressmen caught between White
House pressure for a flat one-year
extension and a "no draft" clamor
from constituents, the bill emerged
as a compromise that offered little
comfort to the President and the
military high command.
It provides for extension of the
present draft act, which expires
May 15, until Feb. 15, 1947. But it
prohibits permanently induction of
18- and 19-year-olds and orders a
general "draft holiday" from May
15 to Oct, 15.
