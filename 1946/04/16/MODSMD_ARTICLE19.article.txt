## 
### 
" 'Arms and the Man' is one of
i George Bernard Shaw's finest plays
| from the viewpoint of comic art,"
according to William Irvine, pro
fessor of English. Mr. Irvine, an
authority on Shaw, stated his opin
ion in admiration of the Stanford
Players' choice of Shaw's play,
"Arms and the Man," for the spring
| quarter production.
"The play is not only one of
: Shaw's best comedies, but it has
been his most often produced play,"
I said Mr. Irvine. "'Arms and the
Man,' although written in 1895. still
j delights audiences by a skillful
j combination of a Gilbert and Sulli
van romance and a timely satire on
I war."
To Open April 21
"Arms and the Man'' will open
Wednesday, April 24, and will run
April 25, 26. 27. 21), and 30 in the
i Little Theater of the Memorial Au

| ditorium. Howard Campbell, of the
Speech ;hkJ Drama Department,
I will direct the play.
The play opens in the romantic
| atmosphere of the Balkan moun
tains in the wintertime as seen from
the moonlit halcony of the hero
ine's bedroom. Mr. Shaw's favorite
method of satire takes the audience
into a romantic fairyland to point
out what life is really like, accord
ing to Mr. Irvine.
' Bulgarian Selling
The plot is set in the home of a
| middle class Bulgarian family, the
I PctkofTs, during the Bulgar-Serbian i
j war of 1885. Raina and her mother, j
| Catherine PetkofT, arc both im- j
, practical romantics who protect a |
; fugitive professional soldier from j
! the Serbian ranks, and it is from
I the beginning of the play, when the j
' fugitive leaps through Raina's bed- I
■ room window and asks her protec- j

lion, th.it (lie libretto for the light
opera "Tlic Chocolate Soldier" is
taken.
The play is primarily a protest
against war, and is timely for this
reason, states Professor Irvine. The
PctkofT women think of war as he
roic and romantic, and it lakes tin
fugitive soldier, Bluntsehli, to
teach them that war is a reality.
The play is also an interesting doc
ument of Mr. Shaw's opinions on
foreign relations, as Mr. Shaw is
a lender of the Fabian Society,
whose principles form the policies
of the present Labor party in Brit
ain.

"Arms and the Man," for the spring
| quarter production.
"The play is not only one of
: Shaw's best comedies, but it has
been his most often produced play,"
I said Mr. Irvine. "'Arms and the
Man,' although written in 1895. still
j delights audiences by a skillful
j combination of a Gilbert and Sulli
van romance and a timely satire on
I war."
To Open April 21
"Arms and the Man'' will open
Wednesday, April 24, and will run
April 25, 26. 27. 21), and 30 in the
i Little Theater of the Memorial Au

| ditorium. Howard Campbell, of the
Speech ;hkJ Drama Department,
I will direct the play.
The play opens in the romantic
| atmosphere of the Balkan moun
tains in the wintertime as seen from
the moonlit halcony of the hero
ine's bedroom. Mr. Shaw's favorite
method of satire takes the audience
into a romantic fairyland to point
out what life is really like, accord
ing to Mr. Irvine.
' Bulgarian Selling
The plot is set in the home of a
| middle class Bulgarian family, the
I PctkofTs, during the Bulgar-Serbian i
j war of 1885. Raina and her mother, j
| Catherine PetkofT, arc both im- j
, practical romantics who protect a |
; fugitive professional soldier from j
! the Serbian ranks, and it is from
I the beginning of the play, when the j
' fugitive leaps through Raina's bed- I
■ room window and asks her protec- j

lion, th.it (lie libretto for the light
opera "Tlic Chocolate Soldier" is
taken.
The play is primarily a protest
against war, and is timely for this
reason, states Professor Irvine. The
PctkofT women think of war as he
roic and romantic, and it lakes tin
fugitive soldier, Bluntsehli, to
teach them that war is a reality.
The play is also an interesting doc
ument of Mr. Shaw's opinions on
foreign relations, as Mr. Shaw is
a lender of the Fabian Society,
whose principles form the policies
of the present Labor party in Brit
ain.
Tickets for "Arms and the Man"
arc available in room 202 of the
Memorial Auditorium for DO cents.
Cast members include Ted Mar
cuse, Elaine Mallzman, Roberta
Mattingly, Val Jones, Mel Ellet,
Norman Varnnrdo, Mary Cogswell,
and William Melton.
" 'Arms and the Man' is one of
i George Bernard Shaw's finest plays

fessor of English. Mr. Irvine, an

Players' choice of Shaw's play,
"Arms and the Man," for the spring
