## German, Italian, Japanese in Gang, Including Nazi Intelligence Chief 
### 
SHANGHAI, April 15 (UP).â€”American authorities revealed
today that they had seized 20 German, Italian and Japanese
agents, all members of a Nazi-sponsored werewolf organization
which carried on war against the United States in China long
after the Reich surrendered.
The agents included Lt. Col. Ludwig Ehrhardt, head of all

German military and naval intelli
gence in Asia and a close personal
friend yf Adolf Hitler. The Ger
mans and Italians will be charged
with violation of surrender terms.
Additional arrests and whole
sale deportations were expected
shortly, since the United States
State Department has urgently
demanded action against Nazis and
Fascists known to he in China.
An official said at least 1,500 per
sons were on the State Depart
ment's "dangerous and undesir
able" list in China.
The 20 men who were seized
helped the Japanese as well as the
Germans. The Japanese, it was ex
plained, were inept at breaking
codes and interpreting messages
monitored from foreign radio sta
tions. The ring helped them per
form this work.
They operated as the Ehrhardt
Bureau with oil ices in Shanghai,
Canton and Peiping. Officials be
lieved they were responsible for
the sinking of a number of Amer
ican ships, including at least one
aircraft carrier, and heavy losses
in the early phases of the Oki
nawa and other Pacific campaigns.
The four Nazi principals, arrested
in Shanghai, had all been interned
at. one time by the Chinese govern
ment and released, later on a va
riety of pretexts. At least one was
employed by the Chinese govern
ment since the end of the war.
Arrested with Ehrhardt in Shang
hai were Bobo Habenicht, an expert
Nazi code breaker; Johannes Hath
jc, former personal pilot for Reiclis
mairshal Wilhclm Goering, and
Wolfgang Schenke, a former Ger
man newspaper correspondent who
; was trained as an agent by the Ger
| man high command.


A SUDDEN MEETING of the
Big Four was called a few hours
before the opening of the United
Nations Conference. The presence
of T. V. Soong, Chinese Foreign
Minister, who was the first to
arrive, indicated the meeting pri
marily concerned the United
States, Russia, Britain, and China
and not the Polish issue as it wa?>
first generally believed.
