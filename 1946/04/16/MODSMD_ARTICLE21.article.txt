# Iran Favors Russ Demand
## 
### 
NEW YORK, April 15 (UP). The
; Allied Big Three were plunged into |
' a new, bitter fight tonight when J
Iran supported an angry Russian
demand that the United Nations
Security Council drop their dispute
and seven nations—a Council ma-j
jority- insisted that it. be kept on
'
the program till the last Red Army
man left Iran.
The Council adjourned the battle,
after three hours oi debate, until
tomorrow after Russian Chief Del
egate Andrei A. Gromyko charged
that. United Stales Delegate Edward
R. Stettinius, Jr., was not. interested
| in a speedy Russo-Iranian settlc
j ment.
Facing a new major diplomatic
defeat, Gromyko fought desperately
to maintain his position that there
was no more dispute and that the
Council was using Iran as a politi
cal pawn.
Stettinius retorted that Gromyko j
; himself had tried to upset a Coun- j
cil decision already taken, and Brit- J
ish Chief Delegate Sir Alexander
Cadogan, closely supporting Stet
tinius, said there would have been
no argument if Gromyko had. not
asked the Council to renege on its
decision.
Iran's letter asking the Council to
drop the question was read at the
opening of. the session. Gromyko j
used it as the basis for his argu- j
merit that the Council must accept
the decision of both parties that j
! there is nothing more to do.
The United States, Britain. Hoi- j
j land, Australia, Brazil, Egypt, and
i Mexico said flatly that there was.
Only two Council members gave
Russia even partial support Po
land, to say the matter could be
closed at once, and France, to try
to suggest a compromise. The com- 1
promise was that the Iranian dis
pute could be dropped, subject to a
report by the U.N. Secretary Gen- i
eral whether Russia kept its prom
ise to withdraw all troops by May <1.
If was problematical whether, if
| defeated again, Gromyko would
I provide the Council with a new
j sensation such as his March 2!»
j walkout.
Gromyko received potent sup
; port from Polish Chief Delegate Os
car Lange, who said that the Coun
cil could show confidence in Rus
sia's word by dropping the case. Il
could be brought up again at any
time, he said, and he charged that
by refusing Iran's own request for
withdrawal the Council would be
using small nations as political foot
balls.
However, Lange did disagree
1 with the Russian claim that the
Council acted illegally in the first
! place in asking both parties to re
port May 6. But this is water over
' the dam now, he argued.
