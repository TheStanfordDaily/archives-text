# Cellah Dwellahs, Attention
## 
### 
Late last guarter The Daily received a cam
pus opinion letter complaining about the lot
of the veteran who, forced to eat in the Cellar,
was also forced to "pay higher prices for in
ferior food" than that which could be ob
tained at Palo Alto restaurants.
Among other things, the author of the letter
suggested that Cellar food be improved,
prices lowered, and that Cellar profits should
be organized on a rebate basis similar to that
operating in the Bookstore.
Acting on this letter, Excom asked for vol
unteers, preferably veterans particularly af
fected by Cellar conditions, to make a survey
of Collar prices and food portions in compari
son with those of Palo Alto restaurants, pre
paratory to taking student action on needed
changes in the Cellar setup.
No one volunteered, least of all anyone

really interested in the suggested Cellar
changes. Two Lagunita women did come
forward who, although they "never eat at the
Cellar, and are too busy anyway," volun
teered to do the survey out of patriotism.
But spring vacation came along, and the mat
ter was dropped.
This guarter the Farm's registration has
reached an all-time high, with the result that
eating places are harder to get than ever, and
the already overburdened Cellar is forced to
take care of much of the overflow.
This is a call for volunteers. If the pro
poned survey is to be made, it should be
made right now—by these concerned. The
Cellar is a Stanford establishment designed
to serve Stanford students. Any complaints
as to the guality of this service must be set
tled now.—M.S.
