Our Monday Review of Literature this week will
take up "Opportunities in the Aimed Forces," a
hi st-seller by Maxwell Lehman and Morton Y;ii -
nion (The Viking Press, $2.95).
Willi the following chapter titles the book can't
miss; "Do You Own a Boat? Your Salary, Where
to Go for Information, Where Can You Volunteer?
You Go to School by Mail and Join the Navy and
(let A Head. Right now we are reading the chap

( ur fellow critic, Edmund Wilson ol 'lhe New
Yorker, had something to say pertaining to an
Eii' lish professor which is worth repeating here
now: "I did not take any of his courses because I
never could see the point of studying modem Eng
lish literature in college if you had no difficulty in
reading English."

Two young men who will figure quite promi
nently in the sports pages this spring wearing the
color:; of the University of Southern California
started their collegiate careers here on the Farm.
Jim Gamble, sprint swimmer, and Hob Mart, pole
vaulter, ; re the turncoats.
Gamble, class of '45, was one of the best sprint
prospccts ever seen in the Encina Pools and as a

frosh swain the 50 in 23.6 seconds, a frosh intercol
legiate record at that time. However, he became
saturated with the college atmosphere, and his per
formances seemed to deteriorate thereafter.
Hart, a fine prep vaulter at North Hollywood,
was here for only two quarters in 1942-43 before
stepping into the war.
We can only guess why they did not come back
to the Farm after leaving the services, but we will
venture to guess that they are sorry they chose
U.S.C. now.
From the several dozen Trojans we talked to
down there over spring vacation, not one said that
he was happy at the school. Not only do they have
a housing problem, but they have a classroom, seat,
book, instructor, and elbow room problem.
The school admitted 12,500 students and then did
not increase their facilities appreciably over what
used to handle 6,000. The students are realizing it
now; when they can't even get in the door of classes
for which they register, when they wait all semes
ter and never are able to get the book for their
course, when they can't move around campus on
the sidewalks because of ihe crowds.
Three specifically asked us to find out about the
possibility of then reentering school here. And yet
a day does not go by that you don't hear one of the
local students screaming about conditions here.
We are very happy to be back at Stanford.

From the several dozen Trojans we talked to
down there over spring vacation, not one said that
he was happy at the school. Not only do they have
a housing problem, but they have a classroom, seat,
book, instructor, and elbow room problem.
The school admitted 12,500 students and then did
not increase their facilities appreciably over what
used to handle 6,000. The students are realizing it
now; when they can't even get in the door of classes
for which they register, when they wait all semes
ter and never are able to get the book for their
course, when they can't move around campus on
the sidewalks because of ihe crowds.
Three specifically asked us to find out about the
possibility of then reentering school here. And yet
a day does not go by that you don't hear one of the
local students screaming about conditions here.
We are very happy to be back at Stanford.
Our Monday Review of Literature this week will
take up "Opportunities in the Aimed Forces," a
hi st-seller by Maxwell Lehman and Morton Y;ii -
nion (The Viking Press, $2.95).
Willi the following chapter titles the book can't
miss; "Do You Own a Boat? Your Salary, Where

Two young men who will figure quite promi
nently in the sports pages this spring wearing the
color:; of the University of Southern California
started their collegiate careers here on the Farm.
Jim Gamble, sprint swimmer, and Hob Mart, pole
vaulter, ; re the turncoats.
Gamble, class of '45, was one of the best sprint
prospccts ever seen in the Encina Pools and as a

frosh swain the 50 in 23.6 seconds, a frosh intercol
legiate record at that time. However, he became
saturated with the college atmosphere, and his per
formances seemed to deteriorate thereafter.
Hart, a fine prep vaulter at North Hollywood,
was here for only two quarters in 1942-43 before
stepping into the war.
We can only guess why they did not come back
to the Farm after leaving the services, but we will
venture to guess that they are sorry they chose
U.S.C. now.
