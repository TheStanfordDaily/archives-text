Agent X-9, a very reliable source, announces
that light after graduation this June. Stanford Uni
versity will once again raise tuition, board and
room.
It i.s a fine idea for the University to make some
regulations concerning co-ed behavior. But the
present system approaches the ridiculous at times.
The following TRUE examples are but four that
we have picked out as more or less typical:
Mary Jones had a 2 o'clock. She had been up
stairs in her room at one minute of 2 but at five
after she realized that she had forgotten to sign in.
The "honor code" demanded that she take a lockout
because "officially" she was not in by 2. . . . Bar
bara Smith lives in Redwood City. Occasionally
her parents like to have her come home. But Bar
bara cannot stay overnight in her own home be
cause she has exhausted her limited number ol
something or others. . . . Jane White's lolks came

up from Southern Cal to visit her. It was a week
day night. In order to stay out after 10:30 she had
to use one of her whatcha ma callits. (We suppose
the University will say "well, how do we know that
it was her parents that were visiting her?" Well,
you usually accept her parents' signature on the
ole tuition check.) . . .
Hilda Smeckinclip went up to the city. She had
a one-thirty but on the way back she realized that
.she would not quite make it on time. Her date
stepped on the gas—drove 70 miles an hour —nar-
luwly missed having three accidents —scared the liv
ing daylights out of four pedestrians on Palm Drive,
almost wrecked the Administration Building com
ing around the bend. But by golly, Miss Smeckin
clip got home on time.
No harm would be done if a little intelligence
was mixed in with the present system. Has any
body seen any? Intelligence, that is.
As the Chaparral has oft been heard to repeat
"lockin smocking."
