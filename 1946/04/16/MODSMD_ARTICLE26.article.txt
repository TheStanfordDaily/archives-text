# HISTORY—1946

### BILL STEIF 
We're feeling pretty proud this morning. Todays
dispatches are filled with news about how the
"crack, American-equipped Chinese First Army"
has broken Communist defenses at Szepinghai
(your guess is probably better than mine) and is
now moving upon the Manchurian capital, Chang
chun.
After four days of bloody battle in which thou
sands died, the Communist line, according to the
news agencies, has crumbled.
Meanwhile, Chiang Kai-shek is reorganizing his
government in an effort to "avert the threat of
civil war."
If this weren't so tragic it would be funny.
The spectacle of Chiang's "American-equipped"'
armies walloping the pants off of the Commies
while Chiang piously tries to "avert the threat" of
war is somehow appalling to us. We are too much
of an individualist to hold any particular brief for
the Reds, but we do think that when General
George C. Marshall gets back to Chungking next
Thursday he better make sure that the Commu
nists get some kind of a square deal from Chiang.
Actually, it is almost impossible to get any ac
curate reports as to what is happening in China—
for instance, none of the reports we have seen in

the last lew hours have given any REASON for
the new outbreak.
Perhaps there is no reason other than that the
old conflict of an up-and-coming minority Com
munism with an enervated authority. Perhaps the
Communists simply will not cooperate with any
type of government aside from a Red-dominated
government. That would be in line with revolu
tionary Marxism.
But we suspect that there must be more reason
for this almost-continuous fighting than mere
physical provocation. Certainly Chiang's govern
ment is at best a benevolent tyranny—and certain
ly if both the Chinese Communists and Chiang's
Nationalists allowed a little more information to
escape China the whole world might be able to
judge the rights and wrongs of the situation better.
And this, we think, might benefit both sides be
cause the world could throw more pressure upon
both sides to come to agreement and to keep a
peace for which too many lives have been lost
already.
