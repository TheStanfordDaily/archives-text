LIST'S (iO FOR A SWIM
(Or Shall We?)
Stanford has Lagunita, as cool, refreshing, and
relaxing a little lake as anyone could want.
Unfortunately, Lagunita also has bacteria by the
million, and is not greatly improved by the pres
ence of a stable at the far end of the lake.
It's swell to swim in, but it has all the safety of a
cess pool!
Why can't something he done about it? Is there
a real reason v/hy Lagunita could not be made safe

for swimming, not only for the spring, but also for
the summer and fall quarters?
From an engineering standpoint it can surely be
done. If it is a matter of sanitary enforcement or
of finances, the question should be thoroughly in
vestigated and the whole thing discussed in the
Daily. We'd like to know.

(Editorial Note: We have a feeling it's a mailer
of finances. Right now we can think of a lot of
places for the money to go first . . . housing, fiin
stance.)
