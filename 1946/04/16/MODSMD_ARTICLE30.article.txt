# Senate Passes Housing Plan

### 
WASHINGTON, April 15 (UP).—
The Senate today approved a long
range program to eliminate "sub
standard dwellings, remodel slums
and encourage construction of 15,—
000,000 new I'arm and city homes
in the next 10 years.
The measure was passed by voice
vote and sent to the House as Sen
ate-House conferees were named to
adjust differences in the adminis
tration's emergency housing bill
which is designed to provide 2,-
700,000 new homes for veterans by
the end of 1!)47.
The Senate bill* outlining the
most far-reaching housing program
ever considered by Congress, would
establish a permanent government
housing policy with an ultimate
goal of "a decent home and living
environment for every American
family."
As steps in achieving it, the meas
ure provides for:
I.—A government expenditure of
$38,000,000 in the first year for slum
clearance and low-rent public and
rural housing programs. Alter the
first six years, the annual cost
would be $143,000,000.
2.—Consolidation of federal hous
ing activities under a permanent
federal housing agency.
3.—Liberalization of loans pro
grams to encourage private enter
prise to build homes for the middle
class third of American families
whose income rules them out for
housing in public projects but is
still too small to afford good homes
of their own. Prospective owners
could obtain FIIA loans by putting
up only 5 per cent as a cash down
payment—s2so on a $5,000 home—
and paying a nominal sum over a
32-year period.
The Senate wrote in a provision
requiring that the prevailing wage
be paid in construction of all houses
built under the program. Sen. Abe
Murdock (D.'Utah) said it was nec
essary to "avoid depressing wages"
but Sen. Robert A. Taft (R., Ohio),
co-sponsor of the bill, protested that
it would raise the cost of new
dwellings and "make it impossible
for millions to buy."
