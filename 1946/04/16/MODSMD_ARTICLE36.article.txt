# Bob Hope, Bing Crosby Clutch Lamour: 'Utopia'

### 
TIIE ROAD TO UTOPIA -Now
—playing at the Fox Theater in San
Francisco
Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, and Dor
othy Lamour, Hollywood's biggest
box-oflic" trio, have their fourth
chance to hit the gold-dust trail
for Paramount in "Road to Utopia."
The latest excursion, although it

approaches Olson and Johnson
proportions in spots, should pacify
even those untainted ones who usu
ally allow themselves to be exposed
only to the Noel Coward type of
comedy.
"Road to Utopia's" plot is of the
"now you see it, now you don't"
variety. Hope and Crosby are run
ning a variation of the shell game
in a Seattle waterfront establish
ment at the picture's inception.
Eventually the Seattle clucks screw
back on their heads and run the
boys out of town, right onto an
Alaska-bound tramp steamer.
A couple of reels later the pair
find themselves in the Klondike
country in possession of a map to
a gold mine.
Tricks of the Trade
Hope and Crosby rely on many
a trick to grind out their gags: a
mountain that suddenly becomes
the Paramount trademark; a talk
ing fish; the unexpected appearance
of Santa Claus in the company of
two scantily-clad femmes; and a
grizzly bear that Hope mistakes for
Miss Lamour. Add to ihis the pair's
continual mugging and you have
pretty socko screen fare.
Dorothy Lamour, as the inevi
table dance-hall girl, moons "Per
sonality" for the benefit of the
drive-in trade, but luckily there
aren't many other annoying dis
tractions. Dottie even gets an op
portunity to display her "luscious
limbs" (and I quote from a press
release) in case you're interested.
Not Disappointing
"The Road to Utopia" gives the
two foremost entertainers of a dec
ade, Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, an
opportunity to display their talents.
The result could hardly be disap
pointing.
Also on the Fox's bill is a March
of Time, "Night Club Room," that
shows many of New York's after
dark spots and their featured enter
tainers. The subject matter ranges
from the Stork Club with its chrome
and class to Sammy's Bowery Fol
lies with its vulgarity and vaude
ville.—Dick Bower
