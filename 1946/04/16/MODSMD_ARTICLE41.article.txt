### ART LEVINSON 
Stanford sports blossomed into
full bloom last Saturday. And what
a nice picture, too! Posting a triple
victoi'y, the Farm athletes gave no
tice that they will have to be reck
oned with before the season is over,
and not just toyed with, as other
schools had happily presumed.
Jack Weicrshauser's cinderpath
artists showed up very well in
their heavy win over a combined
trio of junior colleges. Comparing
Stanford times with California,
the Cardinals could win in a "pa
per match." The Big Game track
meet comes up on June I.
Not too much is known about
track al U.C.L.A., but Harry
Trotter, track mentor at the West
wood branch of U.C., supposedly
has some good sprinters under
his wing.
Across town from Westwood at
U.S.C., Dean Cromwell, maestro of
track, has a championship team in
the making. Paced by such men as
Me! Patton, who runs the century
dash in £.8, and Hollo Sink, who
has a 4:15 mile to his credit, U.S.C.
should run oft with coast honors
this season, and possibly national
honors, too.
This week's calendar is full of
athletic events. Starting off on
Wednesday with the postponed in

tramural track meet, the program
goes to tennis, with matches with
San Jose State on the same day.
Down the road, on the Sunken Dia
mond, the baseball squad entertains
the Naval Air Station from Ala
meda.
Friday, on local grounds, the
tennis team plays host to* a visit
ing squad from U.C.L.A. Satur
day morning, to start the day till
initial intercollegiate action, when
San Jose State brings up the
golfers from that school. In the
afternoon. Jack Weiershauser's
track men have a three-way meet
with San Jose State and Alameda
N.A.S. Tennis goes into action,
too, with a meet with C.0.P.. and
baseball is on the docket with a
game slated with St. Mary's Pre-
Flight in the oiling.
While all this is happening on the
campus, the swimming team goes
south for a meet with U.C.L.A. and
U.S.C. on Friday and Saturday re
spectively. Stanford is definitely in
the athletic picture again. No
doubts about that.

Itay Pascoe, correspondent con
fidential at Toyon, informs this
writer that the torrid Toyon table
tennisters are primed for action
this quarter, arid are willing to
lake on all comers. Last quarter,
they defeated the Tyler team, and
with one victory under their belts
they are anxious to stay in com
petition. All teams who have the
nerve to lake on the terrific Toy
oners should contact Ray Pascoe,
who is spending the spring sea
son at Toyon.

wood branch of U.C., supposedly
has some good sprinters under
his wing.
Across town from Westwood at
U.S.C., Dean Cromwell, maestro of
track, has a championship team in
the making. Paced by such men as
Me! Patton, who runs the century
dash in £.8, and Hollo Sink, who
has a 4:15 mile to his credit, U.S.C.
should run oft with coast honors
this season, and possibly national
honors, too.
This week's calendar is full of
athletic events. Starting off on
Wednesday with the postponed in

tramural track meet, the program
goes to tennis, with matches with
San Jose State on the same day.
Down the road, on the Sunken Dia
mond, the baseball squad entertains
the Naval Air Station from Ala
meda.
Friday, on local grounds, the
tennis team plays host to* a visit
ing squad from U.C.L.A. Satur
day morning, to start the day till
initial intercollegiate action, when
San Jose State brings up the
golfers from that school. In the
afternoon. Jack Weiershauser's
track men have a three-way meet
with San Jose State and Alameda
N.A.S. Tennis goes into action,
too, with a meet with C.0.P.. and
baseball is on the docket with a
game slated with St. Mary's Pre-
Flight in the oiling.
While all this is happening on the
campus, the swimming team goes
south for a meet with U.C.L.A. and
U.S.C. on Friday and Saturday re
spectively. Stanford is definitely in
the athletic picture again. No
doubts about that.

Itay Pascoe, correspondent con
fidential at Toyon, informs this
writer that the torrid Toyon table
tennisters are primed for action
this quarter, arid are willing to
lake on all comers. Last quarter,
they defeated the Tyler team, and
with one victory under their belts
they are anxious to stay in com
petition. All teams who have the
nerve to lake on the terrific Toy
oners should contact Ray Pascoe,
who is spending the spring sea
son at Toyon.

Slants last week, in mentioning
major sports at Stanford, carelessly
left out tennis from the select list.
To Coach Bugge and his team, we
extend our deepest apologies.
Stanford sports blossomed into
full bloom last Saturday. And what
a nice picture, too! Posting a triple
victoi'y, the Farm athletes gave no
tice that they will have to be reck
oned with before the season is over,
and not just toyed with, as other
schools had happily presumed.
Jack Weicrshauser's cinderpath
artists showed up very well in
their heavy win over a combined
trio of junior colleges. Comparing
Stanford times with California,
the Cardinals could win in a "pa
per match." The Big Game track
meet comes up on June I.
Not too much is known about
track al U.C.L.A., but Harry
Trotter, track mentor at the West
wood branch of U.C., supposedly
has some good sprinters under
his wing.
