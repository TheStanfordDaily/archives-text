# The 						Umpire's Verdict
## 
### 
Pacific Coast baseball wound up
two full weeks of competition Sun
day, with Lefty O'Doul's Seals in
the lead by a three-game margin.
Last week, they swamped the Port
land Beavers six games to one. and
with only two defeats suffered the
previous week, the San Francisco
club boasts of 14 wins against only
three defeats.
Admirable pitching, with clutch
hitting, has been the key to
O'Doul's trained Seal perform
ances (his season. Bill Werle, Al
Lien, Cliff Melton—the cast-off
Giant, and lately Frank Seward
have all given excellent mound
services.
Ferris rain, a likely man to reach
the majors, has been hitting a long
ball, and his field work at first has
been impeccable. Second base has
been handled by several men, but
Hugh Luby i« the current man sta
tioned at the post, and is working
himself into fine shape.
Excellent hitting has been offered
by Ted Jennings in the outfield, as
well as hitting, at times, by Sal Ta
ormina, the San Jose rookie.
Portland, last year's pennant
winners, have been floundering
about like so many rubber balls
in a heavy sea. Pitching has been
fair, but hits have been scarcer
than icebergs off of Baja Califor
nia. Manager Marv Owen, who
handles the third sack, is out with
injuries, as is YVes Bucher, the
regular second baseman. The only
infielder worthy of mention in the
present lineup is Larry Barton,
the first baseman.
The Beavers , which are now
owned by some brewery, were ex
pected to finish high this season,
but at their present rate, their niche
in eighth is secure.
Los Angeles bounded up the
standings last week with a five
game victory over John Nelson
Martin's Border City nine from San
Diego. Phil Wrigley, the gum
chewing magnate, is expected to
send help along from the parent
Cubs as time goes by, which makes
the Angels real contenders for this
year's crown.
