urday from 2 to 5 arc progressing !
rapidly according to co-chairman

:
ceremonies for the event.
Miss Houston stated that all en
tries for floats and events from j
both men's and women's living j
groups must be placed in the bal
lot box at the post office Thursday.

noes for their floats from fraterni- j
ties must get written permission ]
from the fraternity and then check |
the request through the A.S.S.U. j
office. Paddles may be obtained for j
a small sum from George C. Board- '
man, 215 Battery street, San Fran- J
cisco. Two living groups may com
bine their canoes in a single float, !
and if their float places first or sec- j
ond, each group will receive the !
full number of points.
The trophies will be awarded on j
a cumulative basis, so each group j
should enter in as many events as
possible, Miss Houston pointed out.
In answer to objections, the com- j
mittee has checked with Dr. G. F. j
Luckett, director of the Public j
Health Servicc, and he has pro- J
nounced Lake Lagunita safe for ]
