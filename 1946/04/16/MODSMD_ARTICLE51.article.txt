# Library Exhibit Shows Pictures of 1906 'Quake'
## 
### 
Forty-two years ago, at a little j
after five o'clock on the morning i
of April 20, 1900, occurred the great
earthquake which did such terrible
damage to Stanford and the whole
Bay area. Now exhibited on the
second floor of the main library are
pictures and papers describing the
awful disaster.
A number of the principal
buildings—Memorial Church, the
library, the men's gym, the Mu
seum, and the Memorial Arch at
the front of the Quad —were ei
ther entirely demolished or so
badly damaged that it was neces
sary to remove them. The big
smokestack by the Engineering
corner fell, killing the University
engineer.
Almost every building except j
those on the Inner Quad suffered i
damage. In Encina one student I
was killed and eight injured. Four
girls in Koble fell through to the j
first floor in their beds, but no one j
was hurt.
The pages of "Stanford Univer- j
sity before the earthquake, and af
ter" may be turned in the exhibit
to show the pictures of the enor
mous losses.
On April 20, the great lire in

San Francisco, which resulted
from the earthquake, reached the
Stanford home on Nob Hill and
it was burned to the ground. The
furnishings of the house, together
with the collection of line paint
ings, statuary, and books, were
almost entirely destroyed.
These weekly exhibits on Stan
ford and its founders are on dis
play at the left of the entrance to
the reference room of the Libe.
