# Dr.Rantz,'36 Tests Serum On Convicts

### 
Fighting to check rheumatic fe
ver, dreaded disease of childhood
and adolescence, a Stanford doctor
is now conducting a series of expe
riments with volunteer San Quen
tin convicts acting as "guinea pigs"
for a nowly developed serum.
Dr. Lowell Rantz, assistant pro
fessor of medicine at Stanford Mcd
ical School in San Francisco, made
news last week when he suggested
to Dr. Leo L. Stanley, San Quentin
physician, that perhaps 50 of the
prisoners would be willing to help
him in the experiment. Two hun
dred men volunteered, and a num
ber of them have undergone the in
jections which, it is hoped, will be
valuable in preventing streptococ
cal infections, the cause of rheu
matic fever.
Graduated from Med School
Dr. Rantz, who was graduated
from Stanford Medical School in
1936, first became interested in the
relation of the streptococci organ
ism to human disease in 1938.
In 19<13 he was appointed field di
rector of the Commission of Hemo
lytic Streptococcal Infections, a
commission set up by the Surgeon
General to plan methods of con
trolling outbreaks of streptococcal
infections if they occurred, and also
for investigating the diseases which
these organisms cause.
The commission made investiga
tions of strep infections in various
army camps; and, under Dr. Rantz's
direction at Camp Carson, Colo.,
an extensive study established the
fact that rheumatic fever starts only
after strep infections.
Must Prevent Fever
In combatting the disease, there
fore, doctors must learn to prevent
the fever in people who have had
strep infections; and. to check it at
the source, must prevent strepto
coccal disease itself.
Since most initial strep disease is
disregarded or unrecognized, there
is no possibility at the present time
of preventing the secondary strep
infection, which often causes rheu
matic fever.
No Satisfactory Drugs
At present there are no drugs
that have proved satisfactory in the
prevention of streptococcal infec
tions; thus Dr. Rantz is investigat
ing the possibility of immunizing
human beings against strep. Past
experimentation with animals has
not been satisfactory.
The San Quentin experiments are
designed to determine the amount
of vaccine necessary to establish an
immunity to hemolytic streptococ
cal infections, and to observe the
reaction of human beings to the
vaccine.

jections which, it is hoped, will be
valuable in preventing streptococ
cal infections, the cause of rheu
matic fever.
Graduated from Med School
Dr. Rantz, who was graduated
from Stanford Medical School in
1936, first became interested in the
relation of the streptococci organ
ism to human disease in 1938.
In 19<13 he was appointed field di
rector of the Commission of Hemo
lytic Streptococcal Infections, a
commission set up by the Surgeon
General to plan methods of con
trolling outbreaks of streptococcal
infections if they occurred, and also
for investigating the diseases which
these organisms cause.
The commission made investiga
tions of strep infections in various
army camps; and, under Dr. Rantz's
direction at Camp Carson, Colo.,
an extensive study established the
fact that rheumatic fever starts only
after strep infections.
Must Prevent Fever
In combatting the disease, there
fore, doctors must learn to prevent
the fever in people who have had
strep infections; and. to check it at
the source, must prevent strepto
coccal disease itself.
Since most initial strep disease is
disregarded or unrecognized, there
is no possibility at the present time
of preventing the secondary strep
infection, which often causes rheu
matic fever.
No Satisfactory Drugs
At present there are no drugs
that have proved satisfactory in the
prevention of streptococcal infec
tions; thus Dr. Rantz is investigat
ing the possibility of immunizing
human beings against strep. Past
experimentation with animals has
not been satisfactory.
The San Quentin experiments are
designed to determine the amount
of vaccine necessary to establish an
immunity to hemolytic streptococ
cal infections, and to observe the
reaction of human beings to the
vaccine.
Fighting to check rheumatic fe
ver, dreaded disease of childhood
and adolescence, a Stanford doctor
is now conducting a series of expe
riments with volunteer San Quen
tin convicts acting as "guinea pigs"
for a nowly developed serum.
Dr. Lowell Rantz, assistant pro
fessor of medicine at Stanford Mcd
ical School in San Francisco, made
news last week when he suggested
to Dr. Leo L. Stanley, San Quentin
physician, that perhaps 50 of the
prisoners would be willing to help
him in the experiment. Two hun
dred men volunteered, and a num
ber of them have undergone the in
jections which, it is hoped, will be
valuable in preventing streptococ
cal infections, the cause of rheu
matic fever.
