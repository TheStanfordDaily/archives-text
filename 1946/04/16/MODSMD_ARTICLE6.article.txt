# New UAW Head Meets with Board
## 
### 
CHICAGO, April 15 (UP).â€”Wal
ter Rcuther's control over the CIO
Auto Workers' Union was put to a
test tonight as the 22-man execu
tive board met for the first time
since his election to the presidency.
The meeting had been scheduled
to start early in the day but was
delayed until after the arrival of
members who attended the funeral
of an international representative in
Detroit. Tonight's sessions were
limited to committee meetings and
factional caucuses.
Union politicians looked to the
meeting, first since Reuther un
seated former President R. J.
Thomas, at the union's Atlantic City
convention, to determine the extent,
to which the UAW board will back
Reuther's policies. Reuther oppo
nents arc conceded a G3 per cent
majority on the executive board.
