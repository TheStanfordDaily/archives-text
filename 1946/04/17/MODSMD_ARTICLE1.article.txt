# OPA Breakdown Charged In Meat Black Market, Senate Committee Told
## 
### 
Trade; Spokesmen Demand Price Lifting
In Effort to Combat 'Nationwide Scandal';
Practice Claimed to Cost Extra Billion
WASHINGTON, April 16 (UP).—Black marketeers more law
less than the gun mobs of the prohibition era have seized virtual
control of meat sales because of a complete OF A breakdown
that amounts to a "national scandal," the Senate Agricultural
Committee was told today.
A parade of trade spokesmen, all bitterly opposed to further

extension of OPA's price controls,'"
gave the committee a lurid picture
of nationwide outlawry and price
gouging in which, they said, both
the public and meat dealers have
been forced to take part.
In the House, Rep. James W.
Wadsworth (R., N.Y.) also blamed
QPA controls for the black market j
in meat which, he said, was costing
consumers an extra $1,200,000,000 ,
annually.
Arguing against a bill to extend
price controls for another year,
Wadsworth said 75 per cent of the I
livestock slaughtering was taking j
place "in the barnyard and in the |
woods" and that 72 to 90 per cent of
the nation's meat was being sold at |
black market prices.
Shortage Expectcd
Simultaneously, the Agriculture ;
Department warned the public to
expect about 9 per cent less meat ;
during this quarter than it received j
in the first three months of 1946, al- j
though supplies still will be 22 per
cent higher than in the 1945 period, j
The department estimated that 4,-
558,000 pounds would go to civilians [
in the present quarter—about one- j
third of a pound per person daily.
One Senate witness testified that
manv storekeeoers broke OPA price
regulations deliberately every day
because they had no alternative but j
to patronize the black market or go
out of business.
Another said a 4,000-mile inspec
tion tour through ten southern (
states showed practically no evi- I
dence that OPA was trying to en- !
force its price rules on "shade-tree
killers" who openly slaughtered il- j
legal and sometimes diseased cat- j
tie for the black market.
A third, P. C. Smith, vice-presi- I
dent of Swift & Company, told the
senators that his firm's Chicago j
plant last week received only 185 |
head of cattle, contrasted with 4,103 j
head in the 1945 week.
The OPA also came under fire '
from one of its own representatives, j
Reese Van Vranken, a Michigan
cattle feeder who testified as spokes- i
man for OPA's joint advisory com- ;
mittee on cattle, dog and beef in- ,
dustrics.
Van Vranken said the committee j
met in Chicago yesterday and"re- j
voltcd" against the newly-ann
nounced OPA slaughter controls, j
which are aimed at permitting each ;
slaughterer to butcher the same !
proportion of livestock as in 1944.

Wadsworth said 75 per cent of the I
livestock slaughtering was taking j
place "in the barnyard and in the |
woods" and that 72 to 90 per cent of
the nation's meat was being sold at |
black market prices.
Shortage Expectcd
Simultaneously, the Agriculture ;
Department warned the public to
expect about 9 per cent less meat ;
during this quarter than it received j
in the first three months of 1946, al- j
though supplies still will be 22 per
cent higher than in the 1945 period, j
The department estimated that 4,-
558,000 pounds would go to civilians [
in the present quarter—about one- j
third of a pound per person daily.
One Senate witness testified that
manv storekeeoers broke OPA price
regulations deliberately every day
because they had no alternative but j
to patronize the black market or go
out of business.
Another said a 4,000-mile inspec
tion tour through ten southern (
states showed practically no evi- I
dence that OPA was trying to en- !
force its price rules on "shade-tree
killers" who openly slaughtered il- j
legal and sometimes diseased cat- j
tie for the black market.
A third, P. C. Smith, vice-presi- I
dent of Swift & Company, told the
senators that his firm's Chicago j
plant last week received only 185 |
head of cattle, contrasted with 4,103 j
head in the 1945 week.
The OPA also came under fire '
from one of its own representatives, j
Reese Van Vranken, a Michigan
cattle feeder who testified as spokes- i
man for OPA's joint advisory com- ;
mittee on cattle, dog and beef in- ,
dustrics.
Van Vranken said the committee j
met in Chicago yesterday and"re- j
voltcd" against the newly-ann
nounced OPA slaughter controls, j
which are aimed at permitting each ;
slaughterer to butcher the same !
proportion of livestock as in 1944.
Trade; Spokesmen Demand Price Lifting
In Effort to Combat 'Nationwide Scandal';
Practice Claimed to Cost Extra Billion
WASHINGTON, April 16 (UP).—Black marketeers more law
less than the gun mobs of the prohibition era have seized virtual
control of meat sales because of a complete OF A breakdown
that amounts to a "national scandal," the Senate Agricultural
Committee was told today.
A parade of trade spokesmen, all bitterly opposed to further

extension of OPA's price controls,'"
gave the committee a lurid picture
of nationwide outlawry and price
gouging in which, they said, both
the public and meat dealers have
been forced to take part.
In the House, Rep. James W.
Wadsworth (R., N.Y.) also blamed
QPA controls for the black market j
in meat which, he said, was costing
consumers an extra $1,200,000,000 ,
annually.
