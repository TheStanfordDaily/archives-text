# Where Bacteria, Bodies Meet Saturday's Water Carnival
## 
### 
Lake Lagunita, bacteria and all, teeming with floats, canoes, sailboats,
and torsos male and female, will sport the Farm's annual Junior Water
Carnival Saturday evening from 2 to 5.
The "County Fair" theme is expected to be carried out in float entries
from campus living groups, said co-chairmen Anne Houston and Al Gilli-

land. Float prizes will be based on
"originality, appearance, and con
struction."
All entries must be listed with
Janet Ossman, Lathrop, or Jack
Seimer, Taylor, by 5 p.m. Thurs
day.
The floats should not be nailed
to the canoe, but tied,, to make im
mediate dissembling possible after
the float has passed the reviewing
stand. Records will be available if
any group wishes to have music ac
company its float.
The floats will be the first event
on the program, and entries should
be lined up by 1:45 so events may
begin promptly at 2.
Entry blanks for the other events
on the program, including jousting,
balloon race, speed races, canoe
filling, gunneling, canoe turnover,
and relays, have been given to all
living groups. Extra blanks may be
obtained from Carl Burke, Encina,
or Shirley Sneath, Hurlburt.
All entries must be placed in the
box at the post office by 5 p.m.
Thursday. Events with a largo
number of entries will be run in
heats.
An official starter will start the
events, which will be judged by
Myron Sprague, Mrs. Marie Lan
tagne, and Dr. Stanley Sharp. Tro
phies will be awarded to the men's
group and the women's group which
have accumulated the most points
during the afternoon.
