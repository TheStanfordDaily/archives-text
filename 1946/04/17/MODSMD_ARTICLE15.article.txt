# Assembly Question 'Up in Air'
## Stalnaker Proposes Meeting at Night; Dodds Pans Apathy

Student hopes for a daytime elec
tion assembly were left "up in the
air" above Frost Memorial Amphi
theater yesterday afternoon when a
joint meeting of the Committee on
Public Exercises and Excom ended
without a decision after an hour and
a half discussion. Another meeting
to debate the problem is tentatively
scheduled.
"We hope that the assembly will
be granted on the condition that if
enough students attend we can con-

tinue to have daytime assemblies in
the future," ASSU President Bob
Kennedy said last night.
From Missouri
Although Dean of Students John
Stulnaker commented that it had
never been proved that an assembly
in the evening would not draw as
many students as one in mid-morn
ing, he mentioned as an alternative
that assemblies could be scheduled
in advance for a set time such as the
fifth Thursday of each quarter.
"That's a fine idea," agreed an
Excom member, "but what about
this quarter?"
"This quarter we need a success
ful assembly both to build up stu
dent interest in the elections, and to
give school spirit a chance," Don
Bechter explained briefly as the stu
dents' viewpoint.
Faculty members are under a
handicap in the fact that they have
to reschedule their classes, Dean
Sfalnakcr pointed out. He said that
the committee felt that since assem
blies had never been well attended
in the past, most of the faculty and
many students did not want to give
up the hour for nonacademic pur
poses.
Apathy "Too Bad"
John P. Dodds, dean of the School
of Humanities, said it was too bad
that interest in student government
"must be artificially stimulated" and
that it. was even necessary to have
an assembly in the daytime to in
sure attendance.
"Married veterans as well as oth
er off-campus students won't, be
likely to attend a night-time meet
ing," Gloria Anderson said.
Students to Have Say
Lorraine Stxeblow, graduate law
student on Excom, asked whether or
not students could be represented
on the Committee on Public Exer
cises. She was given a legal answer
from George Osborne, professor of
law:
"The founding grant established
Academic Council and this commit
tee is made up of faculty members
under that. Council,"he explained,
"so there is no provision for stu
dent membership."
However, Osborne, Dodds, and
other committee members thought
it advisable to meet with student
representatives once a quarter in
order to coordinate student activi
ties and the committee-sponsored
calendar.
