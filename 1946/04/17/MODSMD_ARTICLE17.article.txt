### 
CHUNGKING, April 16 (UP).— Communist troops fought their way into the center of the Man
churian capital of Changchun today and reportedly forced the 7,000-man Nationalist garrison to
retreat to the Manchurian coal building for a last-ditch death-or-surrender battle.
Military observers expected that the Communists would complete the conquest of Changchun
within a short time despite the pledge of Maj. Gen. Chia-Chen, commander of the Nationalists,

that his garrison would "fight to
the last man."
Dispatches from Peiping and
Mukden indicated that Communists
have seized all air fields in the vi

smashed into the city from many
directions. These reports said tho

recruits of the "Peace Preservation
Corps"—retreated to the coal build

The situation inside the city

Five American correspondents, rep

still inside the city.
Defenders' Position Periled
The plight of the beleaguered,
vastly outnumbered defenders was

Their nearest reinforcements were
75 miles distant at Szepinkai.
The most recent dispatch from
the Manchurian capital said it was
being rocked by the dueling of
heavy artillery, and that a hail of
heavy machine gun and small arms
fire was sweeping the streets. The
heavily outnumbered government;
defenders were being forced steadily
back in bloody house -to - house
fignting.
Relief was reported on the way
from Szepinkai, where the Ameri
can - equipped Nationalist First
Army was fighting back from an
earlier setback by the Communists.
Reports here did not indicate what
progress the relief was making.
Chiang urged speed upon his rep
resentatives discussing Chinese un
ity with Communist leader Choti
En-lai and Lo Lung-chi of the
Democratic League. The official Ta
Kung Pao announced some prog

tails.
War Holds Up Negotiations
The question of Manchuria was
the main stumbling block in the ne

League refused to join the govern
