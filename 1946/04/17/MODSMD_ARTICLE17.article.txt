# Chinese Reds Force Way Into Manchurian Capital; Showdown Fight Imminent
## 
### 
CHUNGKING, April 16 (UP).— Communist troops fought their way into the center of the Man
churian capital of Changchun today and reportedly forced the 7,000-man Nationalist garrison to
retreat to the Manchurian coal building for a last-ditch death-or-surrender battle.
Military observers expected that the Communists would complete the conquest of Changchun
within a short time despite the pledge of Maj. Gen. Chia-Chen, commander of the Nationalists,

that his garrison would "fight to
the last man."
Dispatches from Peiping and
Mukden indicated that Communists
have seized all air fields in the vi
cinity of Changchun and have
smashed into the city from many
directions. These reports said tho
Nationalist troops — mostly green
recruits of the "Peace Preservation
Corps"—retreated to the coal build
ing after bitter house -to - house
fighting.
The situation inside the city
obscure. The Central News corre
spondent, after reporting that Com
munist troops were within a half
mile of the Nationalist headquar
ters, stopped sending dispatches.
Five American correspondents, rep
resenting the United Press, Asso
ciated Press, International News
Service, New York Times, and Chi
cago Daily News, apparently were
still inside the city.
Defenders' Position Periled
The plight of the beleaguered,
vastly outnumbered defenders was
acknowledged to be desperate.
Their nearest reinforcements were
75 miles distant at Szepinkai.
The most recent dispatch from
the Manchurian capital said it was
being rocked by the dueling of
heavy artillery, and that a hail of
heavy machine gun and small arms
fire was sweeping the streets. The
heavily outnumbered government;
defenders were being forced steadily
back in bloody house -to - house
fignting.
Relief was reported on the way
from Szepinkai, where the Ameri
can - equipped Nationalist First
Army was fighting back from an
earlier setback by the Communists.
Reports here did not indicate what
progress the relief was making.
Chiang urged speed upon his rep
resentatives discussing Chinese un
ity with Communist leader Choti
En-lai and Lo Lung-chi of the
Democratic League. The official Ta
Kung Pao announced some prog
ress, though it did not go into de
tails.
War Holds Up Negotiations
The question of Manchuria was
the main stumbling block in the ne
gotiations, and the Democratic
League refused to join the govern
ment until the civil war had been
stopped and Chiang had solved his
other problems with the Commu
nists.
A government spokesman said
Chiang's troops were still holding
part of Changchun at midnight. In
formed observers, however, said the
fall of the city was imminent.
So grave was the situation that
Chiang was reported ready to com
mandeer all available transport
planes and fly reinforcements to
Changchun. But such an operation
would be complicated by the fact
that the Communists captured three
airfields near Changchun yesterday
just before they commenced their
attacks, coincidentally with the de
parture of the Russians.
Changchun's defenders, under the
command of Maj. Gen. Chen Shih
tsen, were outnumbered nearly 2 to
1. His force was composed of about
12,000 government peace troops—
many of them untrained—and 4,000
regulars flown in about a month
ago. The Communists totaled 30,-
000 more, and were well equipped
with Japanese weapons which gov
ernment forces believe the Russians
released to them.
