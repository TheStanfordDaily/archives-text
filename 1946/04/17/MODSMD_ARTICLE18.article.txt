### 
Edwin A. Cottrell, Stanford political science professor, has charged that
a few Palo Alto school teachers have been campaigning for Mrs. Kathryn
Bledsoe's candidacy to the Board of Education, and using some of their
students to spread "half-truths from door to door."
In a letter to the Board of Education of the Palo Alto Unified School
District, Professor Cottrell charged that untrue statements were being
made against Robert Littler, Mrs. Bledsoe's opponent for the five-year
term on the school board.
As the elections are to be held next Saturday, Professor Cottrell admits

that it Ls too late to rectify the as
serted situation.
Hi suggests that the Board of Ed
ucation take official action to pro
hibit teachers from engaging in po
litical activity as if affects the school
board, action similar to that which
has been taken by federal, state, and
municipal governments to prevent
civil service employees from en
gaging in political activity.
Francis E. Whitmer, chairman of
the Board of Education, said he had
not heard of the asserted teacher
participation in the campaign, but
Raymond D. Harriman, a member
of the board, said he had heard
some petitions were being circu
lated on Mrs. Bledsoe's behalf by
teachers, and that a telephone cam
paign also was being conducted.
A member of the committee
backing Mrs. Bledsoe's campaign
said there are no teachers on the
committee, nor had the commit
tee any knowledge of any teach
ers being active in the campaign.

Superintendent of Schools Albert M. Davis said the letter from Pro
fessor Cottrell had not been received at the school office. He said he had
heard of no teacher participation in the campaign.
