# Richardson Says Lend-Lease No Aid to Pan-American Unity
## 
### MARION MORROW 
Sullivan C. Richardson's most obvious and often-repeated point at the
Tuesday Evening Scries lecture last night was his belief that inter-Amer
ican relations are not being helped by the lend-lease policy of the United
States* and that the "independent and proud" people of the Americas do
not wish to be so materially helped.
This point was liberally sprinkled through Mr. Richardson's very en-

tertaining and interesting lecture
and technicolor Mr. Rich
ardson, however, prefaced his lec
ture witli the remark that he lias
never claimed to bo an "expert,
but just enjoys making the trips
and always returns from them with
a sincere appreciation of the people.
Strategic Materials Shown
The movie entitled "Good Neigh
bors and Strategic Materials pic
torialiy records Mr. Richardson's
second automobile journey through
Central and South America during
the war under the direction of the
Oflicc of Inter-American Affairs.
Most enjoyable and enlightening
sections of the film showed (while*
Mr. Richardson described them)
the strategic materials of the south
ern neighbors, how they arc pro
duced, and why the United States
needed them during the war.
Hemp Products
Ninety-six per cent of the cin
chona bark from which quinine
is obtained, for example, was im
ported from the Far East before
Pearl Harbor. When war came, the
government sent experts to Central
America to find out whether or not
it could be successfully produced
there. It could be and was, and
now practically all our quinine
comes from this section.
Abaca or Manila hemp, also, was
predominantly a Far Eastern prod
uct before the war, and since it is
the only fiber that can stand salt
water the Navy needed it badly.
There arc now over 26,400 acres of
abaca growing "south of the bor
der."
Village Life
Lou fa, a vegetable sponge which
is used as a filter for air and steam
on naval vessels, was grown only in
one spot of Central America when
the war came and production was
necessarily increased to supply the
major needs of the States.
Mr.Richardson's film also showed
something of the village life of the
peoples, their farm methods, and
their rudimentary attempts at
schools. Few of the peoples have
had much contact with tourists, al
though this is changing with the
advent of the Pan-American High
way. Farm methods are primitive,
for the most part, and since there
are no textbooks in the schools,
teachers put their lessons on the
walls and the pupils learn them
j'rom there.

Central and South America during
the war under the direction of the
Oflicc of Inter-American Affairs.
Most enjoyable and enlightening
sections of the film showed (while*
Mr. Richardson described them)
the strategic materials of the south
ern neighbors, how they arc pro
duced, and why the United States
needed them during the war.
Hemp Products
Ninety-six per cent of the cin
chona bark from which quinine
is obtained, for example, was im
ported from the Far East before
Pearl Harbor. When war came, the
government sent experts to Central
America to find out whether or not
it could be successfully produced
there. It could be and was, and
now practically all our quinine
comes from this section.
Abaca or Manila hemp, also, was
predominantly a Far Eastern prod
uct before the war, and since it is
the only fiber that can stand salt
water the Navy needed it badly.
There arc now over 26,400 acres of
abaca growing "south of the bor
der."
Village Life
Lou fa, a vegetable sponge which
is used as a filter for air and steam
on naval vessels, was grown only in
one spot of Central America when
the war came and production was
necessarily increased to supply the
major needs of the States.
Mr.Richardson's film also showed
something of the village life of the
peoples, their farm methods, and
their rudimentary attempts at
schools. Few of the peoples have
had much contact with tourists, al
though this is changing with the
advent of the Pan-American High
way. Farm methods are primitive,
for the most part, and since there
are no textbooks in the schools,
teachers put their lessons on the
walls and the pupils learn them
j'rom there.


SULLIVAN C. IIICIIAimSON
Sullivan C. Richardson's most obvious and often-repeated point at the
Tuesday Evening Scries lecture last night was his belief that inter-Amer
ican relations are not being helped by the lend-lease policy of the United
States* and that the "independent and proud" people of the Americas do
not wish to be so materially helped.
This point was liberally sprinkled through Mr. Richardson's very en-

tertaining and interesting lecture
and technicolor Mr. Rich
ardson, however, prefaced his lec
ture witli the remark that he lias
never claimed to bo an "expert,
but just enjoys making the trips
and always returns from them with
a sincere appreciation of the people.
Strategic Materials Shown
The movie entitled "Good Neigh
bors and Strategic Materials pic
torialiy records Mr. Richardson's
second automobile journey through
Central and South America during
the war under the direction of the
Oflicc of Inter-American Affairs.
