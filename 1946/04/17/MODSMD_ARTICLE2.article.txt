# Men for Cardinals Still in Demand
## 
### 
Upper division men are urgently
needed to try out for Cardinals,
President Joan McDonough said last
night. The organization wants men
who are interested in promoting
successful campus social functions
and who have good ideas, she
stressed.
Today is the last day for tryouts,
which will be held from 1 to 3 this
afternoon in the Excom room of the
Old Union. Miss McDonough re
minded students that coming out for
Cardinals was one way of assuring
good activities for the campus.
