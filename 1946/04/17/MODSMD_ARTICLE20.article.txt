# Flexible Housing Quotas Proposed
## 
### 
Housing Committee suggested last
i night that loom drawing this quar
ter and in the future be based on a
| ratio system in which each living
I group will have a ratio of women
in proportion to the number of
j women in each class in the entire
! University,
In order to work this system,
which will be suggested to the Ad
ministration, the proportion of wotn-
J en in each class in the University
! would have to be determined. Then
j the capacity of each living group
would have to be determined and
| an ideal ratio applied to it, taking
i into account the proportions in the
| University.
A perfect ratio could not be ob
i tained in this drawing, committee
members said, because the ratio in
i some living groups now is com
, pletely ofT-balance. But this plan
| would be a start in working toward
an eventual perfect ratio, they said.
If a living group has a predomi
nance of one class now. no more
women of that class could be taken
in in the spring quarter drawing.
The ratio would be a flexible one,
so that there would be no "dump
j ing" of members of one class in any
1 one living group.
