# Salome Dances---- What, No Veils?
## 
### 
DETROIT, April 16 (UP). â€”The
swaying rhythms of a beautiful and
lightly clad high-school student,
performing in a show too-well ad -
vertised as Salome's dance, today
resulted in a number of rod faces,
a student strike, and a repeat per
formance for an eager public.
Beverly Cort, 16, black - haired
and vivacious, appeared to be a
little dazed at the sudden upsurge
of public interest in her dance at a
Lincoln high school assembly pro
gram but she insisted on makini;
one point clear.
"I didn't wear any veils," she
said. "My costume is a black bra
and black shorts covered by a split
skiit." The bra is strapless.
The much - publicized assembly
program was managed by Teen Tal
ent, Inc., a student variety club of
75 members sponsored by the school.
The students were scheduled to g've
a show at Center Line tonight, "the
Star Dust Follies," and a capacity
audience of 500 persons was ex
pected for a repeat performance of
Beverly's veil-less dance.
