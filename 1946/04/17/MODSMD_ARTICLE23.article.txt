# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
To the Editor:
Chapel Board has started oiling its creaking
machinery. The oil is a new executive committee
which meets between regular Tuesday evenings.
It i.c .isirt.-, of the president, secretary, and two in
tnested Chapel Board members. This is the way
it v/urks the whole Chapel Board, the engine, pro
vides the gas. This gas we compress through dis
ci!: ion: we want a Good Friday communion serv
ice this year. How do we go about it?
Leave it to the executive committee to decide in
detail. The sparkplug takes over—and what a plug!
The executive committee arranges a date through
Public Exercises Committee for April 19, 194 C,
chooses the scripture, texts, and the readers arid
ushers; and collaborates with the chaplain on the
order of service and Dr. Allen on the music. The
linal product is then handed back to Chapel Board
for ; .proval.
Some high-octane was added at the last meet
ing. At Strain suggested that we start our good
works with hacking and participating in a proj
ect sponsored by UNRRA to send cattle to Eu
rope. Stanford men can help directly by acting
as cuttle tenders on the boats taking them over;
we can all help in raising enthusiasm in the
towns around.
Why is it necessary? The unit around which
European agriculture is built is the family cow.
All the cows have been killed off and the cattle
are starving. It is probably the greatest single con
tribution we could give, and it means more than
money. The name, don't laugh, is Heifers-for-
Relief. Every month they send over three or four
ships with 350 head to a ship. Before they are
shipped to an embarkation center it is known ex
actly where each heifer is to go.
Within the next two or three weeks, Stanford

will hear a lot about this program. A 1 wants (1)
to let people in this community know about it; (2)
to engage their services and pecuniary aid;.and (!5)
to organize a Stanford contingent to go over this
summer. Chapel Board wishes it to be known that
it heartily endorses the program and is selecting
two of its members to serve with the new Stanford
branch of Heifers-for-Relief.
Chapel Board is oiling its machinery. Now it
needs new fuel, people who are interested in re
ligious discussion, people who can lead discus
sions, people to collaborate on welfare work,
read in the Chapel on Sundays, people who
would like to further religious living at Stanford
that is honest, questioning, and active.

European agriculture is built is the family cow.
All the cows have been killed off and the cattle
are starving. It is probably the greatest single con
tribution we could give, and it means more than
money. The name, don't laugh, is Heifers-for-
Relief. Every month they send over three or four
ships with 350 head to a ship. Before they are
shipped to an embarkation center it is known ex
actly where each heifer is to go.
Within the next two or three weeks, Stanford

will hear a lot about this program. A 1 wants (1)
to let people in this community know about it; (2)
to engage their services and pecuniary aid;.and (!5)
to organize a Stanford contingent to go over this
summer. Chapel Board wishes it to be known that
it heartily endorses the program and is selecting
two of its members to serve with the new Stanford
branch of Heifers-for-Relief.
Chapel Board is oiling its machinery. Now it
needs new fuel, people who are interested in re
ligious discussion, people who can lead discus
sions, people to collaborate on welfare work,
read in the Chapel on Sundays, people who
would like to further religious living at Stanford
that is honest, questioning, and active.

To the Editor:
Chapel Board has started oiling its creaking
machinery. The oil is a new executive committee
which meets between regular Tuesday evenings.
It i.c .isirt.-, of the president, secretary, and two in
tnested Chapel Board members. This is the way
it v/urks the whole Chapel Board, the engine, pro
vides the gas. This gas we compress through dis
ci!: ion: we want a Good Friday communion serv
ice this year. How do we go about it?
Leave it to the executive committee to decide in
detail. The sparkplug takes over—and what a plug!
The executive committee arranges a date through
Public Exercises Committee for April 19, 194 C,
chooses the scripture, texts, and the readers arid
ushers; and collaborates with the chaplain on the
order of service and Dr. Allen on the music. The
linal product is then handed back to Chapel Board
for ; .proval.
Some high-octane was added at the last meet
ing. At Strain suggested that we start our good
works with hacking and participating in a proj
ect sponsored by UNRRA to send cattle to Eu
rope. Stanford men can help directly by acting
as cuttle tenders on the boats taking them over;
we can all help in raising enthusiasm in the
towns around.
Why is it necessary? The unit around which
European agriculture is built is the family cow.
