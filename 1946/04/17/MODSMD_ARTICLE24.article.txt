To the Editor:
1 am starved. This is Sunday and I am starved
because nowhere on campus can I get a meal on
Sunday. The dining hall serves food every day but
Sunday, the Cellar serves food every day but Sun
day. My stomach, unfortunately, growls for food
every day—including Sunday.
But in this fine institution of 5,000 people and
9,000 acres there is no place I can eat on Sunday
or during certain hours every day. Surely there
are enough hungry people on campus to sustain
another eating establishment—or has the Cellar
eome sort of monopoly on Stanford food?
Please, gentlemen, in humility (and hunger) I
beg ol' you, please obviate the need for Sunday
food excursions to Palo Alto. Why not reopen the
Union dining room where most of the campus once
took its Sunday dinner? Or let's get a Good Humor
wagon on campus. Or something. Anything. I'm
hungry, damn it.
