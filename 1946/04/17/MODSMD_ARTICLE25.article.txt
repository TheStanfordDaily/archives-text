Stanford University is able to accommodate
4,000-and-a-few students neatly. In normal years
with everyone paying for his own schooling there
are 4,000-and-a-few students financially and
srholastically able to attend Stanford University.
That is a happy equation.
For five years after every war we are going to
h.'vo there will be veterans riding through college
on the taxpayers. Since Stanford University is one
of the best, these deserving ex-soldiers and sailors
will want to take their free rides he're.
II Stanford were to permit these veterans to
matriculate here it would doubtlessly swell the
enrollment to (5,000-and-a-few. To do the right
thing the university would build dormitories for
the single-riders, and housing units for the couples.
They couldn't ask the veterans to pay for these
improvements themselves because the veterans are
<;nly getting enough to eat on from the taxpayers as
il is. The school couldn't ask the government, di
rectly to foot the bill, because the allotted $500
pel 1 man is almost used up already in tuition, text
books, and T-squares.
So the school would spread the bill out and let
the students for the following twenty years pay
for it by raising the tuition, room, and board.
And while these buildings were being paid for
the only occupants of them would be the ants and
the caretaker. By that time the free ride for the
vets would be over for another generation—only

the 4,000-and-a-few would remain.
Of course the school would never be able to
build the new Law Quad or make any of the 133
other improvements that are planned. We the stu
dents would never get a new Union Building or a
new Field House, but after the next war in 1970 all
those accommodations would be right there wait
ing for the crippled, atomized veterans to move into
while they take their free ride for a brass ring and
a B.A.

Several weeks ago Dr. Bailey Willis, professor
emeritus of geology, now in his 89th year was
asked by the Menlo School to inspect the buildings
of the Douglas Estate iri Menlo which the school
was taking over.
The school wanted to know how well the old es
tate would stand up under an earthquake, and lew
men in the country would be able to ascertain this
better than Dr. Willis.
The 55-year-old groundskeeper who was show
ing the party around was unable to accompany Dr.
Willis up to the third floor of the house because oi
his heart, but when the professor returned he fell
into -conversation with this caretaker.
The man was telling Dr. Willis about his father
who had been a prominent architect in his eighties,
but who had died several years ago at the age of
93, when Dr. Willis interjected the query to wit:
"Did he have an accident?"

For five years after every war we are going to
h.'vo there will be veterans riding through college
on the taxpayers. Since Stanford University is one
of the best, these deserving ex-soldiers and sailors
will want to take their free rides he're.
II Stanford were to permit these veterans to
matriculate here it would doubtlessly swell the
enrollment to (5,000-and-a-few. To do the right
thing the university would build dormitories for
the single-riders, and housing units for the couples.
They couldn't ask the veterans to pay for these
improvements themselves because the veterans are
<;nly getting enough to eat on from the taxpayers as
il is. The school couldn't ask the government, di
rectly to foot the bill, because the allotted $500
pel 1 man is almost used up already in tuition, text
books, and T-squares.
So the school would spread the bill out and let
the students for the following twenty years pay
for it by raising the tuition, room, and board.
And while these buildings were being paid for
the only occupants of them would be the ants and
the caretaker. By that time the free ride for the
vets would be over for another generation—only

the 4,000-and-a-few would remain.
Of course the school would never be able to
build the new Law Quad or make any of the 133
other improvements that are planned. We the stu
dents would never get a new Union Building or a
new Field House, but after the next war in 1970 all
those accommodations would be right there wait
ing for the crippled, atomized veterans to move into
while they take their free ride for a brass ring and
a B.A.

Several weeks ago Dr. Bailey Willis, professor
emeritus of geology, now in his 89th year was
asked by the Menlo School to inspect the buildings
of the Douglas Estate iri Menlo which the school
was taking over.
The school wanted to know how well the old es
tate would stand up under an earthquake, and lew
men in the country would be able to ascertain this
better than Dr. Willis.
The 55-year-old groundskeeper who was show
ing the party around was unable to accompany Dr.
Willis up to the third floor of the house because oi
his heart, but when the professor returned he fell
into -conversation with this caretaker.
The man was telling Dr. Willis about his father
who had been a prominent architect in his eighties,
but who had died several years ago at the age of
93, when Dr. Willis interjected the query to wit:
"Did he have an accident?"
Stanford University is able to accommodate
4,000-and-a-few students neatly. In normal years
with everyone paying for his own schooling there
are 4,000-and-a-few students financially and
srholastically able to attend Stanford University.
That is a happy equation.
