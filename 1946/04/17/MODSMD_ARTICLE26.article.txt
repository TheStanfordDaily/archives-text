### STAN SHPETNER 
Boys and Coils, you'all missed the biggest laugh
of all time yesterday noon.
The Committee on Public Exercises held a joint
meeting with Excom to rassle over the question of
holding the election-assembly during the day. Of
all places, it was held in the Frost Amphitheatre.
Kverybody brought their lunch. John Wendell
Dodds, dean of Humanities, carried his in a ma
chinegunner's 30 cal. cartridge box. And ASSU
prexy Bob Kennedy was offering lettuce and toma
to sandwiches made by his pretty wife, Renee.
A few of the highlights: 'I he issue at the moment
w;*s that the professors had their quarter planned
and couldn't afford to lose one class hour. Said
Kennedy: "If a professor can't cut 30 hours down to
29 he ought to be teaching down at Ventura J.C."
But Hons't John Stalnaker, dean of students,
came right back with: "If the students can't ar
range their time so as to take in an evening as
sembly then they should be down at Ventura J.C."
Mr. Dodds, during the more reasonable part of
the discussion, argued that it is a poor thing that

has to be artificially stimulated. (Meaning holding
the affair during the day.) That —Mr. Dodds—is
true. That's what we've )>een telling them down at
the office.
The student government here is admittedly a
weak thing. It does need artificial stimulus. Don t
you think that part of the entire point of the so
called "modern teaching method" is artificial stim
ulus (or is it stimuli?)
We think that student government is just as im
portant a thing to push as is the history of Greece
during the decline of somebody or other.
At any rate Prexy Kennedy gave them a battle.
As Major Devereux said at Wake, "The issue is still
in doubt." Kennedy is still there punching and
the plans at present are to hold another meeting
between Excom executives and public exercisc
bosses. The decision may have already been
leached by the time you see this.
If the Committee On etc. does not allow a daytime
assembly we will have to stop beating student gov
ernment's weakness. It sure won't be their fault
this time.
