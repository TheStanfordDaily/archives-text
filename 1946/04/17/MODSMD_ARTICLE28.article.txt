# 'Arms and the Man' Cast Complete; Leading Actor Sees Version in Paris
## 
### 
Casting for "Arms and the Man," the Stanford
Players' production for spring quarter, was com
plet?d with an interesting twist when it was found
that Morris Val Jones, who will play Maj. Petkoff,
first saw the George Bernard Shaw plajf in Paris,
and liked the role of Petkoff so much that he at
tended last quarter's tryouts specifically to try
for the part.
"My first day on pass in Paris, 1!)45," said Mr.
Jones, "I hunted for a theater production, and
was rewarded with a play by Lawrence Olivier
and Ralph Richardson's Old Vic Company at the
Comedie Francaise. The Old Vic players are a
repertoire company playing 'Arms and the Man,'
'Richard lII,' and 'Peer Giynf on succeeding
ninhts, and I drew 'Arms and the Man'."
In comparing the Stanford production of "Arms
and the Man" with the Olivier-Richardson pro
duction, Mr. Jones said that the play was done in
Paris with three different stage settings depicting
the bedroom, courtyard, and library of the Pet
koff home. The Stanford production will be done
with a changeable unit set designed and supervised
by Howard Campbell, director. Mr. Jones, who
plans to leach in college speech clinic, is working
for his doctorate in Speech and Drama.

Roberta Mattingly will play Catherine Pet
koff, the major's wife. This will be Miss Matting
ly's first appearance with the Stanford Players,
for she has concentrated her speech and drama
major in the field of production, and has served
as stage manager for the productions of "The
Sea (*u 11" and "A Highland Fling."
Mary Cogswell will portray Louka, the servant
girl. Louka is a schemer from away back, accord
ing to Miss Cogswell, and she is the only character
who is both romantic and realistic. Miss Cogswell,
a speech and drama major working for a teaching
credential, was recently seen in the One-Acts and
in "The Taming of the Shrew."
Nicola, the man servant, will be played by
Norman Varnado. Mr. Varnado, who plans to
work in the University (heater, spent his first
three college years at Louisiana State, where he
played in "The Moon Is Down" and "Arsenic and
Old Lace." Mr. Varnado arrived at Stanford al
most by mistake, for he came to California while
on leave from an Army hospital in Alabama be
cause he was told the climate would aid his re
covery from an accident.
"Arms and the Man" will open April 24, and
run April 25, 2(j, 27, 29, and 30. Tickets are on
sale in room 202 of the Memorial Auditorium.
