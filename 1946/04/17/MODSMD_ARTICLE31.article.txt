Society Success
Monday night, the Stanford Hot
Jazz Society presented a New Or
leuns program. (We wish it had
been just "Dixieland" instead of
Crescent City.) The program took
a long while to get rolling but it
finally hit the stride and ended on a
high note.
Tommy Todd, a Los Angeles cor
net man, was the feature and right
ly so, for he rides along nicely
without any exhibitionism and a
great deal of taste. Since the entire
program is being reviewed else
where in this paper, we will just
offer a few congratulations and sug
gestions.
The principal weaknesses were
not numerous, yet noticeable. The
lack of a trombone man equal to
Todd and his cohorts didn't con
tribute to the unity of the ensem
ble work, and it wasn't until late in
the night when a sailor sat in and
everybody worked and rode to
gether.
Our biggest objection was the
lack of a good piano player and the
appearance of a banjo in the rhythm
section. The banjo gave the whole
thing a very dated sound, and the
drive that was needed would have
better been supplied by a guitar.
(Yes, there was Johnny St. Cyr, but

ciety's swing session today on

now even the Kid Ory aggrega
tion doesn't employ the antiquated
instrument.)
On the whole, the session was a
musical success as well as a com
mercial success, and we hope that
the society will continue to import
such musicians as Todd; yes, con
gratulations are to be handed to all
concerned.

Another jazz concert was held
by a rival university over the week
end. U.C.L.A. conducted a modern
jazz program which turned out to
be an enormous commercial suc
cess.

Although jazz usually loses its
| good qualities of taste when per
i formed on a stage, this' concert at
j least gave the Bruin students a
chance to hear some of the good
! musicians around town.
Of course, the modern flavor was
j predominant as musicians such as
Nat Cole, Benny Carter, Arv Gar
rison, Lester Young, Willie Smith,
i Irving Ashbee, and. Oscar Moore
| were the features of the evening. It
[ is too bad that San Francisco does-
I n't attract a few music makers, for
Stanford could then enjoy sessions
such as the one conducted by the
dirty Bruin.

The Wildroot program featuring
i the Woody Herman aggregation is
j really going the whole way when it
comes to contests. The program is
initiating a "Win a Band" contest
with the Herman Herd as the prize.
No, we're not kidding! If you can
think of twenty-five words which
would express the reason you like
Woody Herman and his music bet
ter than the rest of the United
States, then you can have this band
any place in this country or Can
ada for one night.
You might say "this is the end,"
but it isn't, for with the Herd goes
$1,000 in that happy cabbage. What
a party Stanford could throw! Oh,
yes, there are a few minor prizes
such as phono-radio combinations
i and albums of Herman discs—you
know, trivial items. The other im
portant Herman news is the addi
tion of Lynn Stevens, former Geor
gie Auld canary, to the vocalist de
partment. She replaces Frances
j Wayne.

Muggsy Spanier once again has
j organized a jazz band featuring

Society Success
Monday night, the Stanford Hot
Jazz Society presented a New Or
leuns program. (We wish it had
been just "Dixieland" instead of
Crescent City.) The program took
a long while to get rolling but it
finally hit the stride and ended on a
high note.
Tommy Todd, a Los Angeles cor
net man, was the feature and right
ly so, for he rides along nicely
without any exhibitionism and a
great deal of taste. Since the entire
program is being reviewed else
where in this paper, we will just
offer a few congratulations and sug
gestions.
The principal weaknesses were
not numerous, yet noticeable. The
lack of a trombone man equal to
Todd and his cohorts didn't con
tribute to the unity of the ensem
ble work, and it wasn't until late in
the night when a sailor sat in and
everybody worked and rode to
gether.
Our biggest objection was the
lack of a good piano player and the
appearance of a banjo in the rhythm
section. The banjo gave the whole
thing a very dated sound, and the
drive that was needed would have
better been supplied by a guitar.

j least gave the Bruin students a
chance to hear some of the good
! musicians around town.
Of course, the modern flavor was
j predominant as musicians such as
Nat Cole, Benny Carter, Arv Gar
rison, Lester Young, Willie Smith,
i Irving Ashbee, and. Oscar Moore
| were the features of the evening. It
[ is too bad that San Francisco does-
I n't attract a few music makers, for
Stanford could then enjoy sessions
such as the one conducted by the
dirty Bruin.
Win a I'.aml
The Wildroot program featuring
i the Woody Herman aggregation is
j really going the whole way when it
comes to contests. The program is
initiating a "Win a Band" contest
with the Herman Herd as the prize.
No, we're not kidding! If you can
think of twenty-five words which
would express the reason you like
Woody Herman and his music bet
ter than the rest of the United
States, then you can have this band
any place in this country or Can
ada for one night.
You might say "this is the end,"
but it isn't, for with the Herd goes
$1,000 in that happy cabbage. What
a party Stanford could throw! Oh,
yes, there are a few minor prizes
such as phono-radio combinations
i and albums of Herman discs—you
know, trivial items. The other im
portant Herman news is the addi
tion of Lynn Stevens, former Geor
gie Auld canary, to the vocalist de
partment. She replaces Frances
j Wayne.

Duke Ellington is angling for
| Tiny Grimes for the solo guitar spot
j supplementing Duke's old friend,
j Freddie Guy. Guy has been with
! Ellington from the beginning, and
i it would mean the poor home for
I Fred if the Duke ever dropped him.
j Loyalty is wonderful, isn't it?
living Lewis, recent lead-trum
| pet with the Herman Herd, has
! gone from the sublime to the ridic-
I ulous. He may now be heard
i "jumping" with Spike Jones and
1 his City Slickers at the Hollywood
Trocadero—what next?
Muggsy Spanier once again has
j organized a jazz band featuring
j George Brunies on trombone and
I Joe Bushkin on piano. Except for
Rod Cless, the clarinetist who died
last year, the group will be the
same that cut the eight memorable
I platters for the Bluebird label.
