# Professor Whitaker Reads From Renaissance Poetry
## 
### 
If the weekly poetry readings in the Briggs room are not good for
anything else (we think they are), they at least perform the valuable
service of bringing to the attention of interested students poems that they
might not appreciate in desultory silent reading or hectic, crammed re
quired reading.
The merits of hearing poetry read aloud were demonstrated at yes-

terday's reading. Virgil Whitaker,
whose special field is English Ren
aissance literature, read selectidns
from Edmund Spenser's "Hymns of
Hehvenly Love," ''Amoretti," and
the famous "Faerie Queen." He
also read the "Epithalamion.''
Edmund Spenser is reputed to be
dull reading and Mr. Whitaker is
not a soul-searing orator, but the
long descriptive passages and the
invocations to classical and con
temporary deities came alive in oral
reading as they might not in silent.
The "Epithalamion," a song for
Spenser's bride, was perhaps the
best choice lor the reading because,
despite its intricate references to
events of the wedding day and its
classical allusions, the rise and fall
of rhythm and interest is well suit
ed to an oral reading.
Of the "Hymns of Heavenly
Love" Mr. Whitaker commented

that they were some of the best
poetry written for the Easter sea
son. He remarked that Plato and
the New Testament are curiously
blended in these, as they are in
much literature of the English Ren
aissance.
Mr. Whitaker chose a passage
from Book 4 of the "Faerie Queen,"
Spenser's allegorical work, repre
sentative of the notion that love and
the "concord" of the universe are
connected. —H. A. P.
