# Golf Tourney Field Marrows
## 
### 
The all-University golf tourna
ment is now in its second week with
the field narrowed to 16 men. A
drawing has been made and a lad
der set up by which men will be
eliminated in match play, starting
this week. This weÂ»k the field will
be cut to eight, and the week after
next will see the finals.
George Traphagen, the defending
champion, will have to buck tough
opposition from members of the
varsity golf team, particularly
Frank McCann, who shot a 73 in
last week's qualifying rounds and a
08 when he played around the
course Saturday.
The varsity golf team's first match
will be with San Jose State Satur
day on the Stanford course. The
six men who will represent the
Farm in its first varsity golf tour
nament since 1942 have not yet been
picked by Coach Eddie Twiggs.
