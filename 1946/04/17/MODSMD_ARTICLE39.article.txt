# Cards Play Navy Nine
## 
### 
Stanford's baseballers face their
toughest competition of the seuson
in the Alameda Air Station nine
here this afternoon. Although back
on the winning side, the Woltermen
will be jinderdogs when they take
the field at 3 o'clock.
The visitors boast a seasonal rec
ord of 11 wins and two losses. The
Air Devils have beaten U.C., U.S.F".,
and Santa Clara. The last two have
already taken the measure of the
Cards. ,
Bob Molitor, former Seattle
mound ace, is one of the many
hurlers on the crowded Alameda
pitching staff. He is listed as a
probable starter in today's contest.
But playing coach Buzz Meagher
could well nominate himself, for he
is credited with most of the wins
for the season. In case Molitor
starts, Meagher will play first base
so that his hitting power can be
used to advantage.
Coughlin Infield Star
Big wheel of the Alameda infield
is Jack Coughlin. He is noted for
great hitting and fancy fielding.
In the outfield, two Alamedans
have shown potential professional
ability. They are Grazzini and
Gregg, who cover left and center
fields respectively. Three men are
fighting for the starting right field
position.
For Stanford, Coach Wolter will
start Phil Wolf on the mound. For
the first time this season, Wolter is
fairly weH satisfied with his line
up. Behind the plate will be Frank
McGraw. McGraw, currently bat
ting .489, might find Molitor or
Meagher a little tougher to hit than
the fiingers he has faced so far.
Card Infield Settled
The infield sems to be settled
with Frank Merriman on first. Bob
Peters on second, Buck Brownson
at short, and Tom Ward at third.
Peters and Brownson have worked
well together around the keystone,
while Merriman and Ward have
shown more than their share of
batting punch lately.
With Carl Kellenberger, anchor
of the outfield, walking around
Quad with his shoulder in a cast,
the outfield lacks the solidarity of
early season. But the trio of George
Sloat, Dick Ahlquist, and Don Ga
brelson could conceivably make up
for "Kelly's" absence..

Cards. ,
Bob Molitor, former Seattle
mound ace, is one of the many
hurlers on the crowded Alameda
pitching staff. He is listed as a
probable starter in today's contest.
But playing coach Buzz Meagher
could well nominate himself, for he
is credited with most of the wins
for the season. In case Molitor
starts, Meagher will play first base
so that his hitting power can be
used to advantage.
Coughlin Infield Star
Big wheel of the Alameda infield
is Jack Coughlin. He is noted for
great hitting and fancy fielding.
In the outfield, two Alamedans
have shown potential professional
ability. They are Grazzini and
Gregg, who cover left and center
fields respectively. Three men are
fighting for the starting right field
position.
For Stanford, Coach Wolter will
start Phil Wolf on the mound. For
the first time this season, Wolter is
fairly weH satisfied with his line
up. Behind the plate will be Frank
McGraw. McGraw, currently bat
ting .489, might find Molitor or
Meagher a little tougher to hit than
the fiingers he has faced so far.
Card Infield Settled
The infield sems to be settled
with Frank Merriman on first. Bob
Peters on second, Buck Brownson
at short, and Tom Ward at third.
Peters and Brownson have worked
well together around the keystone,
while Merriman and Ward have
shown more than their share of
batting punch lately.
With Carl Kellenberger, anchor
of the outfield, walking around
Quad with his shoulder in a cast,
the outfield lacks the solidarity of
early season. But the trio of George
Sloat, Dick Ahlquist, and Don Ga
brelson could conceivably make up
for "Kelly's" absence..
