# Bulldozer Buries D.U. Swimming Pool
## 
### 
A shovel-nosed bulldozer and its
crew was jobless again today after
half a day's work.
By noon yesterday the bulldozer
had scraped the last dirt over what
was once the Delta Upsilon swim
ming pool, eliminating what the
University believed to be a health
and safety hazard.
Those who watched the burial re
called how pranksters lowered a
Model T into the pool on Hallow
een, '44, and secretly envied anyone
with even a Model T.
