the Indians a 1-0 victory.
President Truman pitched the
first ball in the nation's capital, then
turned over the pitching reins to
Tex Hughson of the Boston Red

where the Cardinals were humbled,
6-4, by the Pittsburgh Pirates. The
Bucs spotted St. Louis three runs in
the first inning and went on to win
with an 11-hit attack on four Car
