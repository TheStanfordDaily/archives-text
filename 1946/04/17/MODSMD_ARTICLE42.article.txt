# Mural Track On Tap Today

### 
Intramural track comes into the
spotlight this afternoon at 4:15 on
Angel 1 Field. Coach Jack Weiers
hauser will sign up all entrants at
that time and the long-awaited meet
will get under way.
The meet will be entirely indi
vidual. Men representing all fra
ternities, living groups, and dorm
corridors, as well as those who wish
to compete unattached, may enter.
All the events in a regular col
lege track meet, with the excep
tion of the two-mile run and the
four-man mile relay, will be of
fered. In place of the mile relay,
there will be an 880-yard relay.
It will be a four-man relay, each
man running 220 yards.
The varsity track team will be al
lowed to enter in the meet with one
stipulation. Men who have pre
viously won a track letter here or at
some other school cannot partici
pate. This will exclude only three
men, so the varsity should turn out
in strength.
Four places will be awarded in
every event. The scoring will be:
five for a first, three for a second,
two for a third, and one for fourth.
This should just about give every
body a chance to gather a few points
for the place he calls "home."
The meet today will give the
varsity a good workout in prep
aration for the triangular meet
with Alameda Naval Air Station
and San Jose State here Saturday.
Working out with the varsity yes
terday afternoon were a group of
young Hawaiian cindermen. The
two teams ran competitive events
and some fairly good marks were
turned in, both by the varsity and
the islanders.
