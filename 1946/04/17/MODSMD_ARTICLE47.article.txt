"REVEILLE FOR RADICALS," by

Chicago Press, l!)4(i. $2.50.
Bull sessions and political discus
sions often contain a great deal of
agreement on things that are
"wrong" and should be changed.
They contain very little agreement
on how to get them changed.
You often hear vague references
to "education," to "social work,"
and an occasional demand for revo
lution. You hear of helplessness, of
trying to crash through a stone
wall, of long-range programs. And
almost inevitably you end with an
argument on whether the ends jus
tify the means.
Into this confusion "Reveille for
Radicals" injects two notes of san
ity:
1. A faith in democracy and in
people. You should work with
and not for them. This for Alin
sky is not an up-in-the-clouds
theory but an ideal successfully
put to work in the slums of Chi
cago.
More important, it rules out both
revolution, which would superim
pose a regime — however "good" —
on the people, and social work
which has rarely attacked basic is
sues and succeeded in little but
arousing the bitter resentment of
those it tries to help. It is as best
a means of temporary relief.
2. Any method used must be
psychologically correct and prac
tical. Here again social work fails
to qualify as does so-called edu
cation. One of Alinsky's many
examples concerns a school teach
er in the slums who told the chil
dren to substitute vitamin - rich
orange juice for unhealthy spa
ghetti. The teacher never knew
why she was slugged on her way
home.

These two ideas form the ground
work of his "People's Organiza
tions" that include all the clubs,
churches, unions, small businesses,
and other organizations in the com
munity. These band together for
selfish reasons at first—one store
joins because it sees its competitor
join and doesn't want to lose sales.
They rapidly learn, however, that
their own interests are generally
best furthered by plugging for the
interests of the whole, and that by
uniting they have acquired the
power necessary to fight.
Fighting is the purpose of the
"People's Organization" — fighting
for housing, jobs, security, fighting
for such seemingly little things as
running water, indoor toilets, penny
milk in schools, but fighting also
intolerance, hate, monopolies, fight
ing with no holds barred.
"There is no fair play in war."
Alinsky is worth listening to be
cause he achieves a rare fusion of
faith and practicability, because his
plan has worked and is working
now. No "People's Organization"
has yet been defeated.
"Reveille for Radicals" is largely
devoted to organizational methods.
But at the same time it is a sizzling
indictment of all those who like to
call themselves liberals, not merely
those who say, "I'm liberal, but
. . . but particularly of the lib
erals who have truly progressive
ideas without the will to fight for
them, the liberals who are forever
passing resolutions indorsing this
or condemning that, the liberals
who "leave the room when the dis
cussion turns into a fight."
How effectively Alinsky's fighting
groups can cure our social ills re
mains to be seen. But his down-to
earth proposals are a call for Amer
ica's liberals to wake up.—George
Brunn

and an occasional demand for revo
lution. You hear of helplessness, of
trying to crash through a stone
wall, of long-range programs. And
almost inevitably you end with an
argument on whether the ends jus
tify the means.
Into this confusion "Reveille for
Radicals" injects two notes of san
ity:
1. A faith in democracy and in
people. You should work with
and not for them. This for Alin
sky is not an up-in-the-clouds
theory but an ideal successfully
put to work in the slums of Chi
cago.
More important, it rules out both
revolution, which would superim
pose a regime — however "good" —
on the people, and social work
which has rarely attacked basic is
sues and succeeded in little but
arousing the bitter resentment of
those it tries to help. It is as best
a means of temporary relief.
2. Any method used must be
psychologically correct and prac
tical. Here again social work fails
to qualify as does so-called edu
cation. One of Alinsky's many
examples concerns a school teach
er in the slums who told the chil
dren to substitute vitamin - rich
orange juice for unhealthy spa
ghetti. The teacher never knew
why she was slugged on her way
home.

These two ideas form the ground
work of his "People's Organiza
tions" that include all the clubs,
churches, unions, small businesses,
and other organizations in the com
munity. These band together for
selfish reasons at first—one store
joins because it sees its competitor
join and doesn't want to lose sales.
They rapidly learn, however, that
their own interests are generally
best furthered by plugging for the
interests of the whole, and that by
uniting they have acquired the
power necessary to fight.
Fighting is the purpose of the
"People's Organization" — fighting
for housing, jobs, security, fighting
for such seemingly little things as
running water, indoor toilets, penny
milk in schools, but fighting also
intolerance, hate, monopolies, fight
ing with no holds barred.
"There is no fair play in war."
Alinsky is worth listening to be
cause he achieves a rare fusion of
faith and practicability, because his
plan has worked and is working
now. No "People's Organization"
has yet been defeated.
"Reveille for Radicals" is largely
devoted to organizational methods.
But at the same time it is a sizzling
indictment of all those who like to
call themselves liberals, not merely
those who say, "I'm liberal, but
. . . but particularly of the lib
erals who have truly progressive
ideas without the will to fight for
them, the liberals who are forever
passing resolutions indorsing this
or condemning that, the liberals
who "leave the room when the dis
cussion turns into a fight."
How effectively Alinsky's fighting
groups can cure our social ills re
mains to be seen. But his down-to
earth proposals are a call for Amer
ica's liberals to wake up.—George
