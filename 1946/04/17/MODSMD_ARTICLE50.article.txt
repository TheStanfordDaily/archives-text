# Jewel City Squires Raise Nitery Roof at ' Session'
## 
### GEORGE MOORE 
Stomping off "Darktown Strutters' Ball," the Jewel City Squires from
San Francisco opened the Hot Jazz Society's third concert of the year
Monday night in the Nitery. From there on it was anybody's fight and
usually turned out that way.
Initially handicapped by the non-arrival of Tom Todd, cornetist and

more or less leader, the rest of the"
Squires — namely, Deacon Reese,
clarinet; Dick Todd, banjo; and
Freddy Groat, drums, augmented
by Bill Wright on trombone and
Stanford men Harry Powers and
Schuyler V. D. Hills on piano and
bass respectively—carried on with
some slow blues. Then, during a
chorus of "Tin Roof," in walks a
trumpet supported by Don McCas
lin of San Jose State who was blow
ing it loud, good, and most wel
come.
Sister Kate Slow
After introductions, cokes, and
cigarettes had been passed around
the session got off to a second start
with "Sister Kate" at slow drag
tempo.
That the participants, for the
most part, had never played to
gether before was pretty evident.
With McCaslin punching out the
lead in no mean manner and Reese's
wonderfully clear upper register
clarinet weaving around in the style
of the old masters, notably George
Lewis, the men did a very credi
table job with "Kate."
Rolling Piano
This was followed by "St. Louis
Blues" with Harry Powers getting
the number going with an easy,
rolling piano chorus. Reese took
one of his better solos in this one,
and then they swung into "Dark
town" again, the difference being
McCaslin's rather restrained horn.
They managed to finish it with an
amazingly tight rideout ensemble.
Reese again showed up well on
"Basin Street," but nobody seemed
to know just when to stop, so one
by one they faded out like the
Arabs and those notorious tents.
"Bugle Call Rag" was kicked off
with a loosely knit but none the
less intriguing ensemble. Freddy
Groat's ten - dollar set of drums
stayed standing long enough for him
to take a very tasteful solo, as
drum solos go. But the final chorus
—well, they just rocked the joint,
that's all.
Todd Arrives!
At this juncture in the proceed
ings Tom Todd, the regular cornet,
showed up and sat down. From
then everybody actually sounded as
if they knew what was coming off.
Todd provided the spark and the
leadership that had been missing
up till then. Leadership that was
unobtrusive but highly necessary
to such an ad lib outfit. His cornet
was in complete control of the band:
when he relaxed, everyone else re
laxed; when he bore down, the rest
of the boys caught on and rode along
on the crest of his blazing tone.
Terrible Blues
From 9:30 and "Georgia Camp
Meeting" until 11 and "Terrible
Blues" (honest), the Squires pro
vided sheer joy. Even a casual ob
server could sense that the boys
played what they felt, and loved
what they played.
Though they were late arriving
for various reasons (Tom Todd said
they went through the Perils of
Pauline getting here), the boys
promised that if the society in
vited them down again they'd make
it on time. We may start engraving
the invitations very soon.-

"Bugle Call Rag" was kicked off
with a loosely knit but none the
less intriguing ensemble. Freddy
Groat's ten - dollar set of drums
stayed standing long enough for him
to take a very tasteful solo, as
drum solos go. But the final chorus
—well, they just rocked the joint,
that's all.
Todd Arrives!
At this juncture in the proceed
ings Tom Todd, the regular cornet,
showed up and sat down. From
then everybody actually sounded as
if they knew what was coming off.
Todd provided the spark and the
leadership that had been missing
up till then. Leadership that was
unobtrusive but highly necessary
to such an ad lib outfit. His cornet
was in complete control of the band:
when he relaxed, everyone else re
laxed; when he bore down, the rest
of the boys caught on and rode along
on the crest of his blazing tone.
Terrible Blues
From 9:30 and "Georgia Camp
Meeting" until 11 and "Terrible
Blues" (honest), the Squires pro
vided sheer joy. Even a casual ob
server could sense that the boys
played what they felt, and loved
what they played.
Though they were late arriving
for various reasons (Tom Todd said
they went through the Perils of
Pauline getting here), the boys
promised that if the society in
vited them down again they'd make
it on time. We may start engraving
the invitations very soon.-
Stomping off "Darktown Strutters' Ball," the Jewel City Squires from
San Francisco opened the Hot Jazz Society's third concert of the year
Monday night in the Nitery. From there on it was anybody's fight and
usually turned out that way.
Initially handicapped by the non-arrival of Tom Todd, cornetist and

more or less leader, the rest of the"
Squires — namely, Deacon Reese,
clarinet; Dick Todd, banjo; and
Freddy Groat, drums, augmented
by Bill Wright on trombone and
Stanford men Harry Powers and
Schuyler V. D. Hills on piano and
bass respectively—carried on with
some slow blues. Then, during a
chorus of "Tin Roof," in walks a
trumpet supported by Don McCas
lin of San Jose State who was blow
ing it loud, good, and most wel
come.
Sister Kate Slow
After introductions, cokes, and
cigarettes had been passed around
the session got off to a second start
with "Sister Kate" at slow drag
tempo.
That the participants, for the
most part, had never played to
gether before was pretty evident.
With McCaslin punching out the
lead in no mean manner and Reese's
wonderfully clear upper register
clarinet weaving around in the style
of the old masters, notably George
Lewis, the men did a very credi
table job with "Kate."
Rolling Piano
This was followed by "St. Louis
Blues" with Harry Powers getting
the number going with an easy,
rolling piano chorus. Reese took
one of his better solos in this one,
and then they swung into "Dark
town" again, the difference being
McCaslin's rather restrained horn.
They managed to finish it with an
amazingly tight rideout ensemble.
Reese again showed up well on
"Basin Street," but nobody seemed
to know just when to stop, so one
by one they faded out like the
Arabs and those notorious tents.
