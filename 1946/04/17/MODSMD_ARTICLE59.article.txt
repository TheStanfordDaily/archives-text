# Chocolate Bait Tried, Kills Mice Like Crazy
## 
### 
SPOKANE, Wash., April 1G
(UP). â€”C. G. Moe, the man who
topped the inventor of the better
mouse trap by coming up with a
better mouse-trap bail, renounced
his brain-child today.
His inspiration came when the
women in his office complained of
mice, lie baited a trap with choc
olate, and it killed mice by the
droves. But the women soon de
cided that news of the chocolate
must have traveled along the
mouse grapevine because more
mice than ever were invading the
office just for a nibble.
Disillusioned, the modern "pied
piper" was forced to go back to
ordinary cheese.
