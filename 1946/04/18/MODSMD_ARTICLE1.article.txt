# Vets Protest 'Bull Session'
## 
### VIC MINAHAN 
Over 150 aroused student veterans last night jammed the
Nitery to voice their resentment of yesterday's "Bull Session"
article in the Daily.
The article, which was written by H. D. Thoreau, a veteran,
was brought up at the beginning of the meeting by Sol Stolboff,

who read the article and described"
it as "one of the worst things I have
seen printed about the veteran in a
long time."
"What Hie we going to <h> about
it?" he queried.
The discussion iastcd for almost
an hour, with suggestions ranging
from official AVC condemnation
of the articles to ignoring it "as
something too flippant for us to
bother with." A large delegation
of NIIOTC officers and men took
part in the controversy.
When the arguments died down,
however, the membership voted
against condemning the article.
The argument which apparently
carried most weight was presented
by LI. Commander Wilson of the
NfiOTC stafl, who said that his study
of University registration figures
showed that Stanford's growth from
J941 to the present was at the same
rate as from 1932 to 1941.
"The.se figures show that the hous
ing problem is a University prob
lem, not a veteran problem," he said.
Last night the AVC also:
Listened to (he report of Hous
ing Committee Chairman Bob
Walli.v, who described the possi
bilities of Dibble Hospital for stu
dent housing, and who quoted I
firehouse officials as saying they
had never condemned Sequoia
Hall. No action was taken on the \
report.
Postponed until next week eon- j
sideration of the report of the com
mittee on Eating Facilities.
Adopted Chairman Briggs' sug- j
gestion of a Housing Drive to be ;
held later in the quarter.
Approved appointment of an In- i
formation Committee, and instruct- i
ed it to prepare a forum on Peace
time Conscription for next week's i
meeting.
Approved an AVC-sponsored drive !
to urge Stanfordites to register for '
the coming primaries and general
elections.
Approved appointment of a two
man committee to talk with Presi
dent Tresidder on the problem of
campus privileges 'for student
wives. This acti<yi came after
Tully Warren had reported that
the University had recently can
celed the right of student wives ;
to buy cards giving them rooting
section privileges. Warren also
reported that there arc now 812 j
married students on campus.

Over 150 aroused student veterans last night jammed the
Nitery to voice their resentment of yesterday's "Bull Session"
article in the Daily.
The article, which was written by H. D. Thoreau, a veteran,
was brought up at the beginning of the meeting by Sol Stolboff,

who read the article and described"
it as "one of the worst things I have
seen printed about the veteran in a
long time."
"What Hie we going to <h> about
it?" he queried.
The discussion iastcd for almost
an hour, with suggestions ranging
from official AVC condemnation
of the articles to ignoring it "as
something too flippant for us to
bother with." A large delegation
of NIIOTC officers and men took
part in the controversy.
When the arguments died down,
however, the membership voted
against condemning the article.
The argument which apparently
carried most weight was presented
by LI. Commander Wilson of the
NfiOTC stafl, who said that his study
of University registration figures
showed that Stanford's growth from
J941 to the present was at the same
rate as from 1932 to 1941.
"The.se figures show that the hous
ing problem is a University prob
lem, not a veteran problem," he said.
Last night the AVC also:
Listened to (he report of Hous
ing Committee Chairman Bob
Walli.v, who described the possi
bilities of Dibble Hospital for stu
dent housing, and who quoted I
firehouse officials as saying they

report.
