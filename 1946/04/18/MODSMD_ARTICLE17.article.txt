# Cottrell Denies Charge Against Paly Teacher
## 
### 
Professor Edwin A. Cottrell vigorously denied last night that he had charged Mrs. Kathryn
Bledsoe, candidate in Saturday's Palo Alto School Board, with using school children to further
her candidacy and circulate petitions in her favor.
Stating that he had been misquoted by both the Palo Alto Times and the Daily, the veteran
political science professor said that he would "stick to my original written statement."

This referred to a letter that he
wrote to the Palo Alto School Board
early this week, in which he de
clared that some Palo Alto teach
ers were using school children "to
circulate petitions for their favored
candidate" and that these children
were spreading "half-truths and lie.,
from door to door."
"My original letter had nothing
to do with the candidates,"* Pr
ofessor Cottrell pointed out in his
statement to the Daily last night.
"Neither candidate has been ac
cused of using these methods, al
though they have been used in
support of both candidates."
The professor's statement came
after a week of charges and coun
ter-chargcs which blew up a rou
tine school board election into a
name-calling political fracas in
which Stanford professors and Ad
ministration were lined up on both
sides.
The contestants for the vacancy
arc Mrs. Bledsoe and Robert C. Lit
tler, the latter publicly backed by
Mr. Cottrell.
Mr. Cottrcll's letter brought
immediate protests from Mrs.
Bledsoe's supporters, who chal
lenged the profe.vsor to name the
teachers involved. This Mr. Cot
trell has refused to do.

Professor Edwin A. Cottrell vigorously denied last night that he had charged Mrs. Kathryn
Bledsoe, candidate in Saturday's Palo Alto School Board, with using school children to further
her candidacy and circulate petitions in her favor.
Stating that he had been misquoted by both the Palo Alto Times and the Daily, the veteran
political science professor said that he would "stick to my original written statement."

This referred to a letter that he
wrote to the Palo Alto School Board
early this week, in which he de
clared that some Palo Alto teach
ers were using school children "to
circulate petitions for their favored
candidate" and that these children
were spreading "half-truths and lie.,
from door to door."
"My original letter had nothing
to do with the candidates,"* Pr
ofessor Cottrell pointed out in his
statement to the Daily last night.
"Neither candidate has been ac
cused of using these methods, al
though they have been used in
support of both candidates."
The professor's statement came
after a week of charges and coun
ter-chargcs which blew up a rou
tine school board election into a
name-calling political fracas in
which Stanford professors and Ad
ministration were lined up on both
sides.
The contestants for the vacancy
arc Mrs. Bledsoe and Robert C. Lit
tler, the latter publicly backed by
Mr. Cottrell.
Mr. Cottrcll's letter brought
immediate protests from Mrs.
Bledsoe's supporters, who chal
lenged the profe.vsor to name the
teachers involved. This Mr. Cot
trell has refused to do.
