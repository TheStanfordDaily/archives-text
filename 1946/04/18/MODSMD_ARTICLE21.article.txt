# Assembly Set For May 22
## 
### 
Aii all-campus daytime assem
bly was granted to the A.S.S.U.
I>y the Committee on Public Ex
ercises yesterday as a result of
Monday's lunch time debate be
tween Excom and Committee
members. Wednesday, May 22, at
10 a.m. was named by Excom last
night as the date for the election
assembly, at which candidates for
student body offices will be pre
sented.
I)ean Stalnakcr, while grant
ing the assembly for this quar
ter, made the request that the
A.S.S.U. hereafter inform the
Public Exercises Committee one
quarter in advance of their de
sire to have an assembly so that
faculty may he notified and plan
their class hours accordingly.
The debate which centered
around granting of the assembly
was Dean Stalnaker's assertion
that it had never been proved
that an assembly at night would
not draw as many students as
one in mid-morning. A night as-

sembly would not necessitate ex
cusing of classes.
But Excom members comment
ed that an assembly with assured
success was needed to build up
student interest in elections and
to "give school spirit a chance."
The Committee on Public Exer
cises has apparently agreed to
the point.
