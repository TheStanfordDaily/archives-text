# When Is a Burden Not a Burden?
## 
### 
What's to happen to enthusiasm of
Stanford students who want to get behind
such movements as the World Student Serv
ice Fund and Heifers for Relief?
The problem came up at Excom last night
when representative of the "Heifers" group
cams and asked permission to have some
form of a drive to support the project to
send 10,000 head of cattle to Europe, where it
is estimated that each heifer will save ten
persons' lives.
E::ccm approved the idea unenthusias
tically and turned it over to Drives Com
mittee to consider.
But the hitch is this: it is an established
policy of Drives Committee that only one
drive shall be held a quarter, in order not
to burden students with excessive solicita
tion. (To "burden" Stanford students, when
in other parts of the world students are
"burdened" with the fact that they can't get
enough to eat?)
We agree that one large drive a quarter is
enough.. But we don't agree that any Stan

ford student who is worth his salt feels "bur
dened" when there is a chance for him to
contribute to this kind of a cause.
The ASSU president suggested that all our
efforts should be thrown towards a drive
such as the annual Con Home Drive which
"is more acutely Stanford." One of the Ex
com visitors put in the salty comment that
it was just because the Heifers for Relief
movement was "less acutely Stanford," and
because it was "a little more practical, a
little more direct, and a little more concrete"
than mere social platforms, that his group
wanted to give it all possible support.
We can't understand why in the name of
intelligence a way cannot be worked out so
that students on campus who are eager to
support any worthwhile project —at any time
—will be able to do so, without being
squelched by too confining rules. Surely a
channel of some sort can be set up to take
care of voluntary contributions, not as a bur
den, but as a sincere application of the kind
of student activity that can help to rebuild a
world.
