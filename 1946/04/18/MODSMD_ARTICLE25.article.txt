# 1906—1946

Perhaps in these super-sophisticated times
we may smile at the sentiments expressed in
an editorial in "The Daily Palo Alto" April
20, 1900 the first issue of the campus paper
aftei The Earthquake had hit Stanford:
. . We cannot express our feelings at
this horrible calamity, for it belies expres
sion . . .
"But we should not despair. Out of our
grief we should arise and labor ceaselessly
to once more build up the University in
which all our hopes are enshrined. And most
of all. iet as put our trust no longer in stone
and steel, but in those ideals which never
perich, which outlast ruin, and do not yield

to the limitations of time."
Melodramatic, perhaps, but sincere, even
when read in 1946.
Forty years later—and instead of an earth
quake Stanford, with the rest of the world,
has emerged from the most catastrophic war
in history. Looking around today we'd say
that someone, from 1906 to 1946, did "labor
ceaselessly" and that some—though not all—
of the "ideals that never perish" have grown
along with the University.
Today, as before, Stanford's future depends
upon the will, the interest, the "trust in the
ideals" of all those who are part of the Uni
versity.—H.D.
