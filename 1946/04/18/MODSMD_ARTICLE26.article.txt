'Ihe Stanford Union is just wasting food. In the
main dining room the portions served to the diners
are so large that anyone with a normal appetite will
clave half his plate untouchedâ€”the porcelain half.
Tiie cooks al the Union are fine upstanding men
and women and they do their jobs exceptionally well,
and v.'e hold no brief against them, but the manage
ment of these dining rooms should be awakened to
the fact that the portions are of such size that many
of the customers can hardly walk up to pay their
checks at the end of a meal.
We suggest, Miss Ricker, that you include on the
menu half-servings for those who can't bolt a full
Union meal in one sitting.
The only trouble with the half-portion idea is that
the hashers might have some difficulty in distin
guishing between a meal ready to be served and a
faultily washed plate of the previous meal.

Our New Yorker arrived yesterday chock full of

spring perfume ads and their accompanying en
chanting advertising blurbs.
We have this week: "The perfume of promise,"
"America's own fragrance," "the climax of eight
years of sensitive composing . . ." "the happy, light
hearted fragrance that gayly says 'it's all in l'un!' "
"As mischievous as a sidelong glance," "containers
of decorative charm that continue to delight long
after their petal-sweet fragrances have become a
soft-scented memory."
But for breathless prose you don't have to go any
farther than our own Stanford Daily. Roos Bros., a
cafeteria down town, had this to say on page 3 yes
terday: "Little basque . . . hug me tight! That's
why I love you so well you make my waist look
twice as liny, particularly when your matching skirt
is so round and full. Luscious-colored wools, with
liny black buttons. Jackets, 16.95, Skirt 12.1)5."
Doesn't that make your mouth water?"
