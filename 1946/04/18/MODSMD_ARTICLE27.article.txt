# HISTORY—1946

### HILL STEIF 
Nearly three and a half years ago we wrote an
editorial for the Daily which pointed out that Stan
ford men and women are among the world's most
fortunate students. We also mentioned the fact that
tin ie were many thousands of students on this
Iroubled planet who were not nearly so lucky. The
whole point of this little build-up was that an or
ganization called the World Student Service Fund
was putting yn a "drive" for money. The WSSF,
we stated, provided food, clothing, medical care and
books for needy students all over the world. And
the WSSF, we casually mentioned, also furnished
these students for prisoners of war.
As the reader may gather, we were a little bored
with "drives." In our own little universe here at
Stanford we sensed only dimly that there were
young men and women throughout a chaotic world
who sought, no matter what the price, to continue
rational, constructive work. It was difficult for us
to imagine students going to school without shoes,
without food, without books. We were, in short, a
fatuous ass.
* X *
More than three years later and wiser, we were
brought up short by a little mimeographed sheet
published in Geneva, Switzerland, by the European
branch of the World Student Service Fund. This
little pamphlet was given to us by a young man
with whom we occasionally drank beer in the long,
•' unlit days before we donned our O.D.'s This young
man slipped into Sam's Fighting Forces about the
: ame time as us and the only thing we heard about
liim during three years was that he had been shot
down and captured in Europe.
No Propaganda
Our young man, in giving us this little paper,
mentioned that he had had direct contact with the
WSSF while in prison. He pointed out that in his
camp library all the liberal reference books he
picked up to read had been sent by the ESRF—the

European branch of the WSSF. "The ESI?F," he
said, "wasn't the kind of an outfit that sent only
books which propagandized the beliefs of the send
ers." The young man told how a prisoner could
write to Switzerland to request books on any topic
in order to follow a certain course of study.
This organization operated all through the war.
It is nonsectarian and non-political. It has estab
lished. sanatoriums for students who contracted dis
eases in concentration camps. It has distributed
books to university libraries and youth hostels ev
erywhere and provides a central organization where
displaced and disoriented students can obtain ad
vice, food, financial aid and any other kind of nec
essary assistance in picking up the thread of study.
Plea to Stanford
From all over Europe reports note the lack of
trained personnel to begin the giant task of rebuild
ing the crucified continent. Everywhere battle
jaundiced youth is trying to find a place to sink its
roots, to absorb ilself in the work of construction
after the nightmare years. But youth needs food and
clothing and books to do the job. Only the United
States can provide these bare necessities in suf
ficient quantity.
We are now going to do a little special pleading.
We have no great eloquence to persuade persons
to give money to the type of outfit we have just de
scribed. But we suspect that there are a lot of peo
ple right here at Stanford who, if they were a little
bit aware of what is happening beyond the Farm,
might want to give a little cash to the WSSF. We
think that perhaps many Stanford students are
about as sick of "drives" as we were three years
ago. We hope they are not as fatuous as we were.
If there's anything that our students and our
student government ought to do, it is, in our unim
portant opinion, to help fellow students everywhere.

contributed nearly 500 dollars. Seems to us that
Stanford ought to be able to do just about as well.

camp library all the liberal reference books he
picked up to read had been sent by the ESRF—the

European branch of the WSSF. "The ESI?F," he
said, "wasn't the kind of an outfit that sent only
books which propagandized the beliefs of the send

write to Switzerland to request books on any topic
in order to follow a certain course of study.

It is nonsectarian and non-political. It has estab

Plea to Stanford
From all over Europe reports note the lack of
trained personnel to begin the giant task of rebuild
ing the crucified continent. Everywhere battle
jaundiced youth is trying to find a place to sink its
roots, to absorb ilself in the work of construction
after the nightmare years. But youth needs food and
clothing and books to do the job. Only the United
States can provide these bare necessities in suf
ficient quantity.
We are now going to do a little special pleading.
We have no great eloquence to persuade persons
to give money to the type of outfit we have just de
scribed. But we suspect that there are a lot of peo
ple right here at Stanford who, if they were a little
bit aware of what is happening beyond the Farm,
might want to give a little cash to the WSSF. We
think that perhaps many Stanford students are
about as sick of "drives" as we were three years
ago. We hope they are not as fatuous as we were.
If there's anything that our students and our
student government ought to do, it is, in our unim
portant opinion, to help fellow students everywhere.

Nearly three and a half years ago we wrote an
editorial for the Daily which pointed out that Stan
ford men and women are among the world's most
fortunate students. We also mentioned the fact that
tin ie were many thousands of students on this
Iroubled planet who were not nearly so lucky. The
whole point of this little build-up was that an or
ganization called the World Student Service Fund
was putting yn a "drive" for money. The WSSF,
we stated, provided food, clothing, medical care and
books for needy students all over the world. And
the WSSF, we casually mentioned, also furnished
these students for prisoners of war.
As the reader may gather, we were a little bored
with "drives." In our own little universe here at
Stanford we sensed only dimly that there were
young men and women throughout a chaotic world
who sought, no matter what the price, to continue
rational, constructive work. It was difficult for us
to imagine students going to school without shoes,
without food, without books. We were, in short, a
fatuous ass.
