# Alameda Navy Nicks Card Baseballers to Win 6-2
## 
### STU MILLAR 
It was the sixes that made the
difference yesterday afternoon on !
the Sunken Diamond when Ala- j
meda Naval Air Station's nine I
humbled the Cards. The visitors !
won by a score of 6 to 2 although j
they made only six hits. And it was
Stanford's six errors that accounted
for the loss.
Alameda's pitchers stilled the
Indian batting power for one of j
the few times this season. The I
Woltermen gathered only six hits J
off the hurling of Ilajack and |
Peters. For Stanford, Phil Wolf
started (In; game and pitched
more than creditably for five* in
nings. During bis stay on the
mound, five of the Navy's runs
were scored, but only three of
them were earned. Wolf struck
out six sailors and walked none. ,
Dick Flatland took up the mound }
duties in the sixth and pitched his
best for the season. He allowed only
two hits and one run in his four- j
inning :;tint.
The stronger part of the local
nine now appears to be the out
field. Each of the three men col
lected one hit and made no errors.
And there were no questionable i
lii(s in their direction either. Wol
ter will probably stick with
George Sloat in left, Denny Fox
in center, and Jim Wickersham
in right.
The infield committed all six of !

the misplays and could stand tight
ening greatly. Alter the game,
Coach Wolter expressed the opin
ion that more work and tougher
practice would prove the necessary
medicine for the numerous bobbles.

It was the sixes that made the
difference yesterday afternoon on !
the Sunken Diamond when Ala- j
meda Naval Air Station's nine I
humbled the Cards. The visitors !
won by a score of 6 to 2 although j
they made only six hits. And it was
Stanford's six errors that accounted
for the loss.
Alameda's pitchers stilled the
Indian batting power for one of j
the few times this season. The I
Woltermen gathered only six hits J
off the hurling of Ilajack and |
Peters. For Stanford, Phil Wolf
started (In; game and pitched
more than creditably for five* in
nings. During bis stay on the
mound, five of the Navy's runs
were scored, but only three of
them were earned. Wolf struck
out six sailors and walked none. ,
Dick Flatland took up the mound }
duties in the sixth and pitched his
best for the season. He allowed only
two hits and one run in his four- j
inning :;tint.
The stronger part of the local
nine now appears to be the out
field. Each of the three men col
lected one hit and made no errors.
And there were no questionable i
lii(s in their direction either. Wol
ter will probably stick with
George Sloat in left, Denny Fox
in center, and Jim Wickersham
in right.
The infield committed all six of !

the misplays and could stand tight
ening greatly. Alter the game,
Coach Wolter expressed the opin
ion that more work and tougher
practice would prove the necessary
medicine for the numerous bobbles.
