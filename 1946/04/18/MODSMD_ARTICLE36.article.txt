# Farm Intramural Track Meet Run Off, Amid Confusion
## 
### 
Question of the week—"Who won
the Intramural Track Meet yester
day?" At the end of the meet, the
men running under the title of un
attached had accumulated by far
the greatest number of points; but,
there seems some question whether
or not that anonymous group will
be allowed the victory.,
With some men representing one
group in one event and another
group in some other event, with men
placing in some event and then leav
ing the field before it could be
learned what group they were rep
resenting, things got rather con
fusing.
Here are the very un-official re
sults: First, with 47 points, the "un
attached" group; second, Betas, 19
points; third, Encina, 16 1/3 points;
fourth, Toyon, 13 1/3 points; fifth
Firehouse, 12 1/3 points.
There was a very poor turnout
for the meet. It boiled down to just
inter-squad action among the var
sity track team.
The events went as follows:

Question of the week—"Who won
the Intramural Track Meet yester
day?" At the end of the meet, the
men running under the title of un
attached had accumulated by far
the greatest number of points; but,
there seems some question whether
or not that anonymous group will
be allowed the victory.,
With some men representing one
group in one event and another
group in some other event, with men
placing in some event and then leav
ing the field before it could be
learned what group they were rep
resenting, things got rather con
fusing.
Here are the very un-official re
sults: First, with 47 points, the "un
attached" group; second, Betas, 19
points; third, Encina, 16 1/3 points;
fourth, Toyon, 13 1/3 points; fifth
Firehouse, 12 1/3 points.
There was a very poor turnout
for the meet. It boiled down to just
inter-squad action among the var
sity track team.
The events went as follows:
