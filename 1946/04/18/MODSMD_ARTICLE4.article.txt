CHUNGKING, April 17 (UP).—
The Manchurian capital of Chang
chun was completely isolated today
by Communist assault forces which
latest reports said had smashed into
the center of the city after over
whelming Nationalist resistance.
Unconfirmed government reports
said that more than half the city's
defenders had been killed, possibly
2.000 to 3,500 men. All telegraph
and radio communications were
broken. The situation was officially
described as "very critical" 24
hours ago when the remaining de
fenders were driven into a small
pocket.
A Peiping dispatch said the crack
American-equipped Nationalist new
First Army, racing up . from the
south to relieve the Changchun
garrison, still was three days away
from the capital after breaking
through Communist defenses at
Szepingkai Monday. The First
Army has advanced more than 20
miles noith of Szepingkai to within
40 miles of Changchun, this report
said.
Gen. George C. Marshall, Presi
dent Truman's special envoy who
hurried back to China to stop the
blazing battles that broke out in
his absence, arrived at Peiping to
day and went into immediate con
ferences over Changchun. He is ex
pected to go on to Chungking im
mediately, where Nationalist and
Communist members of the three
power truce team are reporting to
their chiefs.

NEW YORK, April 17 (UP).—
Poland, denouncing Spain as a
threat to world peace, charged in
the Security Council today that
German scientists were conducting
atomic energy research under
Spanish auspices and demanded
that the 51 United Nations break
relations with the Franco regime.
Calling Spain the last surviving
partner of the Axis and citing evi
dence, much of it provided by
Spanish Republican intelligence op
eratives, of German scientific, mili
tary, financial, commercial, and in
dustrial activities there, Dr. Oscar
Lange of Poland called the Spain
of Generalissimo Francisco Franco:
"... a jumping-off place for war
which may spread all over the
world."
By the end of the session,
France and Mexico had lined up
behind Poland and the United
States and the Netherlands had
warned against taking action
which might be merely interfer
ence in the private affairs of an
other nation. Both America and
Holland argued that Spain was
not a danger to peace. .
France and Mexico vigorously
supported Poland's demand for ac
tion. The Netherlands vigorously
opposed, warning against setting a
dangerous precedent by interfering
in internal affairs.
United States Chief Delegate Ed
ward R. Stettinius, Jr., said this
country opposed Franco, liked the
Spanish people, and could do noth
ing for the people so long as Franco
remained.
The United States, lie said,
wants: (1) the Spanish people
themselves to oust Franco; (2) to
do so peacefully. This country
will give sympathetic considera
tion to whatever action can he
taken within that scopc, he said,
and the Council adjourned until
3 p.m. tomorrow.
Lange, outlining his anti-Franco
charges, asserted there were 100.000
Germans and French Vichy militia
men in Spain and that they main
tained a headquarters near the
French frontier where Franco's
troops are massed.
