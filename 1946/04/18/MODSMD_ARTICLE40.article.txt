# Indian Swimmers Travel South; Meet SC, UCLA
## 
### LARRY MADURO 
Stanford's highly touted swim
ming team journeys to Los Angeles
tonight. The Indians will tackle
USC on Friday afternon and then
will proceed to Westwood Saturday
morning for an engagement with
UCLA. Present indications point
convincingly to the fact that Stan
ford's swimming team will return to
the Farm with an unblemished rec
ord.
Eyes in the swimming world will
be focused upon the meet with
UCLA as the Indians will attempt
to crack existing national intercol
legiate and Pacific Coast Conference
records. Bob Anderson, who cur
rently holds the national intercol
legiate 60-yard freshman record and
the national intercollegiate 50-yard
championship, will attempt to win
the national intercollegiate 60- and
100-yard championships.
The 60-yard record is 28 6/10 sec
onds, and Bob swam the event in 28
seconds fiat when he won the fresh
man record. Therefore, it seems a
cinch that he will break the exist
ing 60-yard record. Bob will have
to surpass his past performances if
he wishes to annex the 100-yard
U.S. crown. At any rate though,
Bob should break the Pacific Coast
Conference record for the 100 which
is 29 6/10 seconds.
Don Hester stands an excellent j
chance to smash the existing PCC
mark of 2 minutes and 26 6/10 sec
onds for the 200-yard breaststroke.
Stanford's 400-yard relay team com
posed of Rule, Eastman, Anderson,
and Narver will set their sights on
breaking the present PCC record set.
by Stanford's 1937 team. Coach
Haynie has expressed confidence
that this record will be broken. The
300-yard medley relay team of Rule, I

Borchers, and Hester will be out to
break the PCC record for this event.
In the 60-yard freestyle are Bob
Anderson, Clint Eastman, and Key
Rule. These three will also race in
the 100-yard event. Dick Narver
and Jim Armstrong will represent
Stanford in the 220 and 440-yard
races. Harry Borchers and Bernie
Briskin will navigate the 150-yard
backstroke event, and Klaas 80l and
Don Hester will compete in the 200-
yard breaststroke race. Len Sperry
will be substitute for the 50-yard
event and the 400-yard relay.
With a chance to achieve national
recognition if they perform well, the
team is keyed up. This was evident
in yesterday's practice session as
the boys kept practicing and per
fecting their strokes vigorously till
closing time.
