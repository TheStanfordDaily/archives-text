# Sigma Nu Meets Verona A.C. in Baseball Today
## 
### 
Intramural baseball makes its
second appearance this season,
j when play opens this afternoon at
4:30. Sigma Nu, which toppled the
J Phi Delts by a "footballish" score,
meets Gerona A.C., untested yet
this year. In another League I
game, Encina 2E plays Jefferson.
The "Jeffs" collected a victory over
Taft in their first outing, and En-
I cina forfeited in their game.
In what should prove a very tight

game, the Betas play Harrison, who
| crumbled the A.T.O.'s on Tuesday.
The Hilltoppers, in a League 11 fray,
I meet the Zetes. who were defeated
by the Betas.
All teams are requested by Coach
Bugge to report promptly for the
• games.
