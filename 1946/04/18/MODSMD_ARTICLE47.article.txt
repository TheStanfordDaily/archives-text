# Willis Won't Predict

Dr. Bailey Willis, professor cmri
tus in geology, when asked for an

j earthquake prediction, >tated that j
I he gave up forecasting tremors many
I years ago.
Although many people try to pre- j
j diet earth shocks, it is impossible to j
i forecast them with any degree of
: accuracy. "As to my method, I j
would remark that earthquakes are |
I supposed to come at regular inter
vals. In that respect they resemble
thunder storms in California, which,
; of course, are irregular indeed.
"Again, earthquakes are supposed
| to have some relation to tides and
I positions of the moon, but for any
one shock which might seem to ver
ify that inference, there are thou
i sands of others that do not. And
old timers, who of course, always
j speak with scientific accuracy, claim
J there is such a thing as earthquake
weather, you can draw your own
I conclusions a.s to the inaccuracy of
| this method," said Dr. Willis.
On future earthquakes, however,
j Dr. Willis refuses to commit him
-1 self, and advises us to "just wait
j and see."
