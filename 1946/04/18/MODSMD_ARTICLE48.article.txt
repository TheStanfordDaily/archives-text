# 1906 Earthquake Topples Campus Kit Buildings
## Printer Describes Heroic Past of Dippy; Paper Undaunted by Huge Earthquake 
### BILL HORNBY 
From the wreckage of its print
shop the Daily Palo Alto salvaged a
one-page special edition reporting
the deaths and damage facing a
stunned Stanford 40 years ago this
norning.
Yesterday the man responsible
j for that edition, J. A. Quelle, found
er of the Stanford University Press
and for 25 years the printer of the
Daily, described the printing of the
edition which gloomily documented
"the greatest earthquake of mod
ern limes."
Preliminary Tremors
Quelle, a member of Stanford's
first class, remembered many tre
mors which were getting to be an
"amusing" topic of conversation on
I the campus prior to April 18, 1906.
J But that morning when he awoke
in a shower of falling plaster in his
Salvatierra Street home, the printer
j to Stanford knew this one was "dif
! ferent."
Quelle supervised the printing
of the Daily in a special building
near the powerhouse, then lo
cated approximately where the
present Union stands. All type
was hand set and 500 copies were
printed of the four-page paper, a
complicated operation involving
much student sweat.
When Quelle reached the print
ing office on earthquake day, the
forms were broken, the stock
strewn around the room. The power
for the presses was off, and the
manpower was rushing around
Quad in a state of general confu
sion.
Daily Carries On
Fortunately, the job cases were
not spilled. The main problem
Quelle faced was that of convincing
the staff the building would stand
up long enough to get the paper
out.
Early in the afternoon the stu
dent body was duly informed in a
i two-line banner, "University in
Path of Disastrous Earthquake."
A second edition followed detail
ing the damage.
Quelle, now a distinguished old
j gentleman with snow - white hair
| and mustache, arrived at Stanford
the day before its first Reg Day
and registered as a special engi
neering student.
Birth of a Newspaper
i In 18f.2 a group of Stanford stu
dents decided the Farm should have
! a Daily. Quelle, already an accom
-1 plished printer, was elected to go
to San Francisco to buy a press,
; armed with $300 raised by faculty
i subscription.
The first printer to Stanford was
j to remain the backbone of the Daily
| for 25 years from 1892 until 1917,
when he retired to live in San
Francisco with his daughter, Mrs.
; G. Lane.
Buying a cylinder press, a
stone, and a few fonts of type.
Quelle brought the lot back to the
j campus on the streetcar. The
Stanford University Press began
its shoestring operations within a
I few days.
In a corner of the powerhouse
Quelle set up the small cylinder
I press, run by foot-power during the
j frequent power failures of the main
■ turbines.
Housing Problem
With student help Quelle was
| able to print the required 500 pa-
I pers a day.
At that time Stanford wrestled
with a housing problem . School
planners thought the school would
grow no bigger than 500 in the first
J generation; opening day reg figures
oeared 550.
(Today, with a school regislra-
I tion of over 5.000. the Daily pub

lishes over 4,000 issues a day on
a modern press taking two early
morning hours for the job.)
As the press gradually expanded
and added dance tickets, lecture
notices, and faculty research pa
pers to its list, Quelle expanded his
shop, first into a separate building
near the powerhouse, and later into
a building near the racing stables.
No Fancy Printing
The emphasis was on utility print
ing. "We didn't have anything like
the fancy Goudy books," Quelle
told Stanford Press Director Don

j aid Bean, as he examined speci
mens of modern Stanford Press
work, some of the finest college
press printing in the United States.
The shelves of books which
formed a background for Stanford's
first printer describing the first
press — "Thai-English Dictionary,"
"An Atlas of Scale Insects in North
i America," "Crime Is a Business,"
I "Foundations of Modern World
l Society," "Who's Who in Latin
| America" — were monuments to a
j long road traveled since earthquake
! day.

was hand set and 500 copies were

When Quelle reached the print
ing office on earthquake day, the
forms were broken, the stock
strewn around the room. The power
for the presses was off, and the
manpower was rushing around
Quad in a state of general confu
sion.
Daily Carries On
Fortunately, the job cases were
not spilled. The main problem
Quelle faced was that of convincing
the staff the building would stand
up long enough to get the paper
out.
Early in the afternoon the stu
dent body was duly informed in a
i two-line banner, "University in
Path of Disastrous Earthquake."
A second edition followed detail

Quelle, now a distinguished old

the day before its first Reg Day

neering student.
Birth of a Newspaper
i In 18f.2 a group of Stanford stu
dents decided the Farm should have
! a Daily. Quelle, already an accom
-1 plished printer, was elected to go
to San Francisco to buy a press,
; armed with $300 raised by faculty
i subscription.
The first printer to Stanford was
j to remain the backbone of the Daily
| for 25 years from 1892 until 1917,
when he retired to live in San
Francisco with his daughter, Mrs.
; G. Lane.
Buying a cylinder press, a
stone, and a few fonts of type.
Quelle brought the lot back to the
j campus on the streetcar. The
Stanford University Press began
its shoestring operations within a
I few days.
In a corner of the powerhouse
Quelle set up the small cylinder
I press, run by foot-power during the
j frequent power failures of the main
■ turbines.
Housing Problem
With student help Quelle was
| able to print the required 500 pa-
I pers a day.
At that time Stanford wrestled
with a housing problem . School
planners thought the school would
grow no bigger than 500 in the first
J generation; opening day reg figures
oeared 550.
(Today, with a school regislra-
I tion of over 5.000. the Daily pub

lishes over 4,000 issues a day on
a modern press taking two early
morning hours for the job.)
As the press gradually expanded
and added dance tickets, lecture
notices, and faculty research pa
pers to its list, Quelle expanded his
shop, first into a separate building
near the powerhouse, and later into
a building near the racing stables.
No Fancy Printing
The emphasis was on utility print
ing. "We didn't have anything like
the fancy Goudy books," Quelle
told Stanford Press Director Don

j aid Bean, as he examined speci
mens of modern Stanford Press
work, some of the finest college
press printing in the United States.
The shelves of books which
formed a background for Stanford's
first printer describing the first
press — "Thai-English Dictionary,"
"An Atlas of Scale Insects in North
i America," "Crime Is a Business,"
I "Foundations of Modern World
l Society," "Who's Who in Latin
| America" — were monuments to a
j long road traveled since earthquake
! day.
From the wreckage of its print
shop the Daily Palo Alto salvaged a
one-page special edition reporting
the deaths and damage facing a
stunned Stanford 40 years ago this
norning.
Yesterday the man responsible
j for that edition, J. A. Quelle, found
er of the Stanford University Press

edition which gloomily documented
"the greatest earthquake of mod
ern limes."

mors which were getting to be an
"amusing" topic of conversation on
I the campus prior to April 18, 1906.

in a shower of falling plaster in his
Salvatierra Street home, the printer
j to Stanford knew this one was "dif

-1 plished printer, was elected to go
to San Francisco to buy a press,
; armed with $300 raised by faculty
i subscription.
The first printer to Stanford was
j to remain the backbone of the Daily
| for 25 years from 1892 until 1917,
when he retired to live in San
Francisco with his daughter, Mrs.
; G. Lane.
Buying a cylinder press, a
stone, and a few fonts of type.
Quelle brought the lot back to the
j campus on the streetcar. The
Stanford University Press began
its shoestring operations within a
I few days.
In a corner of the powerhouse
Quelle set up the small cylinder
I press, run by foot-power during the
j frequent power failures of the main
■ turbines.
Housing Problem
With student help Quelle was
| able to print the required 500 pa-
I pers a day.
At that time Stanford wrestled
with a housing problem . School
planners thought the school would
grow no bigger than 500 in the first
J generation; opening day reg figures
oeared 550.
(Today, with a school regislra-
I tion of over 5.000. the Daily pub

lishes over 4,000 issues a day on
a modern press taking two early
morning hours for the job.)
As the press gradually expanded
and added dance tickets, lecture
notices, and faculty research pa
pers to its list, Quelle expanded his
shop, first into a separate building
near the powerhouse, and later into
a building near the racing stables.
No Fancy Printing
The emphasis was on utility print
ing. "We didn't have anything like
the fancy Goudy books," Quelle
told Stanford Press Director Don

j aid Bean, as he examined speci
mens of modern Stanford Press
work, some of the finest college
press printing in the United States.
The shelves of books which
formed a background for Stanford's
first printer describing the first
press — "Thai-English Dictionary,"
"An Atlas of Scale Insects in North
i America," "Crime Is a Business,"
I "Foundations of Modern World
l Society," "Who's Who in Latin
| America" — were monuments to a
j long road traveled since earthquake
! day.
