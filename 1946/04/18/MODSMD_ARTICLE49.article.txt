# All Campus Lives on Lawns; Classes Suspended After Quake
## 
### HELEN PINKERTON 
It was like an all-campus barbe
cue and picnic after the 'quake in
190G. The students and other cam
pus people slept outside for several
nights as minor shocks continued to
shake buildings.
Helen Green Cross, who wr.s a
sophomore living at her father's
campus home, remembers that tv
everyone ate outside for days be
cause of the fear of building fires in
houses. "It was a kind of large
house party. No students were al
lowed to leave and classes were not
held," she said.
Mrs. Cross, who .still lives on
campus, recalls that the first au
tomobile to appear on campus
was brought in at that time. Since
telegraphic communication was
impossible from Palo Alto, Pro
fessor 11. .?. Ryan collected tele
graph messages from the hun
dreds of students and set out in
the car to reach a ooint from
which they could be sent. He and
a student, who knew telegraphy,
traveled as far as Sacramento
before open communication could
be found. There the student was
given an open w«ire and he sent
messages to families all over the
country.
Although classes were impossible
the students were not idle. Mrs.
Cross said that some went to San
Francisco to help in relief while
others worked in Palo Alto collect
ing and preparing food for the des
titute people in the city.
Guy C. Miller, city historian of
Palo Alto, recalls another incident
of the disaster in San Francisco.
Mr. Miller, a post office employee
at the time, said that for a few days
after the 'quake the post office in

San Francisco permitted messages
to be sent without stamps. Old
scraps of paper, bits of wood, and
even pieces of shirt were used to
send out word of the safety of
the ruined city's occupants.
Recalling the morning of the
first shock. Mr. Miller said that
he thought at the time that it was
just another 'quake and that he
would wail until it subsided. He
had been in San Jose during the
rather violent one which occurred
in March. lU9B, and hit San Jose
particularly hard. When this
shock continued he got up to look
after his newly born son who he
supposed was in a basket in the
room. Finding he was safe in an

other room, Mr. Miller went out
side to see what damage had been
done.

a student, who knew telegraphy,
traveled as far as Sacramento
before open communication could
be found. There the student was
given an open w«ire and he sent
messages to families all over the
country.
Although classes were impossible
the students were not idle. Mrs.
Cross said that some went to San
Francisco to help in relief while
others worked in Palo Alto collect
ing and preparing food for the des
titute people in the city.
Guy C. Miller, city historian of
Palo Alto, recalls another incident
of the disaster in San Francisco.
Mr. Miller, a post office employee
at the time, said that for a few days
after the 'quake the post office in

San Francisco permitted messages
to be sent without stamps. Old
scraps of paper, bits of wood, and
even pieces of shirt were used to
send out word of the safety of
the ruined city's occupants.
Recalling the morning of the
first shock. Mr. Miller said that
he thought at the time that it was
just another 'quake and that he
would wail until it subsided. He
had been in San Jose during the
rather violent one which occurred
in March. lU9B, and hit San Jose
particularly hard. When this
shock continued he got up to look
after his newly born son who he
supposed was in a basket in the
room. Finding he was safe in an

other room, Mr. Miller went out
side to see what damage had been
done.
It was like an all-campus barbe
cue and picnic after the 'quake in
190G. The students and other cam
pus people slept outside for several
nights as minor shocks continued to
shake buildings.
Helen Green Cross, who wr.s a
sophomore living at her father's
campus home, remembers that tv
everyone ate outside for days be
cause of the fear of building fires in
houses. "It was a kind of large
house party. No students were al
lowed to leave and classes were not
held," she said.
Mrs. Cross, who .still lives on
campus, recalls that the first au
tomobile to appear on campus
was brought in at that time. Since
telegraphic communication was
impossible from Palo Alto, Pro
fessor 11. .?. Ryan collected tele
graph messages from the hun
dreds of students and set out in
the car to reach a ooint from
which they could be sent. He and
a student, who knew telegraphy,
