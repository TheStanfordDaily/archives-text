# Forty Years Ago Today Quake Rocked Stanford Dorms, Quad
## 
### BOYD HAIGHT 
Looking like a bomb - wrecked
city after a heavy air raid, a great
portion of the Stanford campus lay
in ruins 40 years ago this morning
when a series of sharp quakes
rocked the Bay Area and brought
havoc and destruction to thousands.
The disastrous earthquake of
April 18, 1906. struck at 5:13 a.m.
and lasted 47 seconds, tv/o
and doing an estimated $2,800,000
damage to the University.
Rescue Parties Help
Three hundred scantily clad men
gathered in front of Encina after

I they luid escapcd through a hail of
falling debris. Cries of the injured
| sent rescue parties back into the
j building. Six men sleeping in a
i third floor room had been carried

i into the basement by the fall of a
| heavy ornate chimney which had
collapsed through the roof of the
. building.
The body of Junius 11. Ilanna,

'08. was found at the bottom of j
the pile of bricks and stones after i
a two - hour search. The other j
men cscaped with broken legs j
and ankles and skin lacerations. j
A more serious disaster on the j
campus was averted through the
quick thinking of a University em- !
ployee, Otto Geddis, who stayed at j
lii.s post when the first tremors be- j
gun. Geddis turned off the Univer
sity's electric power before he was j
killed by falling sections of the 100- j
foot smokestack which had been |
snapped off like a whip lash.
Memorial Arch Damaged
Destruction beyond repair was
limited to the ornate buildings. The
tower fell in on the Memorial
Church and the concussion blew the
north wall out into the Quad court.
Memorial Arch was badly damaged
and never replaced; the Museum
building was wrecked and valuable
collections inside were destroyed.
The newly built entrance gates at
Palm Drive and the highway were
reduced to piles of stone.
Two buildings not yet com
pleted, the library and the men's
gymnasium, were the only two
functional buildings which were
destroyed. The main portion of
the library had collapsed, leaving
only a few beams supporting the
dome which swung like an in
verted pendulum and threatened
to fall at any moment.
Damage to buildings on the Outer
Quadrangle was serious but not
complete; broken bottles and scat
tered chemicals filled the inside of
the Chemistry building, which was
not seriously hurt.
Classes Dismissed
In view of the chaotic conditions
which faced the University admin
istration, President David Stan-
Jordan dismissed classes for the se
mester and granted degrees to sen
iors who were up in their work.
Up on the Row, frame houses
had weathered the tremors and
owners reported fallen chimneys
and cracked plaster as the only
damage.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon listed the
loss of a handsome collection of
steins valued at $200. Chi Psi lodge
was thrown 10 feet off its founda
tion and collapsed in a pile of de
bris.
Coed Takes Uide
At old Roble (now Sequoia) one
coed went to bed on the third floor
and woke up on the second when a
chimney crashed through the roof
and dropped her room down to the
second floor.
Fear of recurring shocks kept
students and faculty members out
of campus buildings during the
day and out of their beds at night.
The girls at Roble brought out
their bedding and slept on the
lawn, guarded by a ring of men
from Encina.
Palo Alto and the Bay Area had
been cut off from the rest of the

world and two professors left on j
Thursday, the day after tha quake, j
carrying a sheaf of wires to anxious !
relatives of students from the East. |
The professors found the telegraph j
offices in San Jose, Oakland, and |
Sacramento so deluged with mes
sages that they were forced to mail
their wires to Reno where they
could finally be sent.
Relief Parties Organized
Relief parties were organized on
the campus to serve in San Fran
cisco where the disastrous fire raged
unchecked for three days. The red
glow of the flames could be seen at
night from the campus.
Students were caught without
money to pay for transportation
home. A rumor that the Univer
sity would make loans was un
founded and local banks ran short
of cash when reserves were de
pleted. San Francisco banks had
been destroyed by fire and their j
vaults were all too hot to be |
opened to give leiief (o branch
banks.
The outlook for the University
was grim; so much that had just
been completed had to be built over
again. There was still a little of
the humorous among the tragic. A
statue of Agassiz had toppled off its
pedestal on the front of the Ad- I
ministration building and j
face downward into the cement !
sidewalk below.


MANY OF ENCINA'S ROOMS were untenable after the
earthquake, and the dormitory's occupants camped on the lawns
and in adjacent fields.

A more serious disaster on the j
campus was averted through the
quick thinking of a University em- !
ployee, Otto Geddis, who stayed at j
lii.s post when the first tremors be- j
gun. Geddis turned off the Univer
sity's electric power before he was j
killed by falling sections of the 100- j
foot smokestack which had been |
snapped off like a whip lash.
Memorial Arch Damaged
Destruction beyond repair was
limited to the ornate buildings. The
tower fell in on the Memorial
Church and the concussion blew the
north wall out into the Quad court.
Memorial Arch was badly damaged
and never replaced; the Museum
building was wrecked and valuable
collections inside were destroyed.
The newly built entrance gates at
Palm Drive and the highway were
reduced to piles of stone.
Two buildings not yet com
pleted, the library and the men's
gymnasium, were the only two
functional buildings which were
destroyed. The main portion of
the library had collapsed, leaving
only a few beams supporting the
dome which swung like an in
verted pendulum and threatened
to fall at any moment.
Damage to buildings on the Outer
Quadrangle was serious but not
complete; broken bottles and scat
tered chemicals filled the inside of
the Chemistry building, which was
not seriously hurt.
Classes Dismissed
In view of the chaotic conditions
which faced the University admin
istration, President David Stan-
Jordan dismissed classes for the se
mester and granted degrees to sen
iors who were up in their work.
Up on the Row, frame houses
had weathered the tremors and
owners reported fallen chimneys
and cracked plaster as the only
damage.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon listed the
loss of a handsome collection of
steins valued at $200. Chi Psi lodge
was thrown 10 feet off its founda
tion and collapsed in a pile of de
bris.
Coed Takes Uide
At old Roble (now Sequoia) one
coed went to bed on the third floor
and woke up on the second when a
chimney crashed through the roof
and dropped her room down to the
second floor.
Fear of recurring shocks kept
students and faculty members out
of campus buildings during the
day and out of their beds at night.
The girls at Roble brought out
their bedding and slept on the
lawn, guarded by a ring of men
from Encina.
Palo Alto and the Bay Area had
been cut off from the rest of the

world and two professors left on j
Thursday, the day after tha quake, j
carrying a sheaf of wires to anxious !
relatives of students from the East. |
The professors found the telegraph j
offices in San Jose, Oakland, and |
Sacramento so deluged with mes
sages that they were forced to mail
their wires to Reno where they
could finally be sent.
Relief Parties Organized
Relief parties were organized on
the campus to serve in San Fran
cisco where the disastrous fire raged
unchecked for three days. The red
glow of the flames could be seen at
night from the campus.
Students were caught without
money to pay for transportation
home. A rumor that the Univer
sity would make loans was un
founded and local banks ran short
of cash when reserves were de
pleted. San Francisco banks had
been destroyed by fire and their j
vaults were all too hot to be |
opened to give leiief (o branch
banks.
The outlook for the University
was grim; so much that had just
been completed had to be built over
again. There was still a little of
the humorous among the tragic. A
statue of Agassiz had toppled off its
pedestal on the front of the Ad- I
ministration building and j
face downward into the cement !
sidewalk below.


MANY OF ENCINA'S ROOMS were untenable after the
earthquake, and the dormitory's occupants camped on the lawns
and in adjacent fields.
Looking like a bomb - wrecked
city after a heavy air raid, a great
portion of the Stanford campus lay
in ruins 40 years ago this morning
when a series of sharp quakes
rocked the Bay Area and brought
havoc and destruction to thousands.

collapsed through the roof of the

The body of Junius 11. Ilanna,

'08. was found at the bottom of j
the pile of bricks and stones after i
a two - hour search. The other j
men cscaped with broken legs j
and ankles and skin lacerations. j
A more serious disaster on the j
campus was averted through the
quick thinking of a University em- !
ployee, Otto Geddis, who stayed at j
lii.s post when the first tremors be- j
gun. Geddis turned off the Univer
sity's electric power before he was j
killed by falling sections of the 100- j
foot smokestack which had been |
snapped off like a whip lash.
Memorial Arch Damaged
Destruction beyond repair was
limited to the ornate buildings. The
tower fell in on the Memorial
Church and the concussion blew the
north wall out into the Quad court.
Memorial Arch was badly damaged
and never replaced; the Museum
building was wrecked and valuable
collections inside were destroyed.
The newly built entrance gates at
Palm Drive and the highway were
reduced to piles of stone.
Two buildings not yet com
pleted, the library and the men's
gymnasium, were the only two
functional buildings which were
destroyed. The main portion of
the library had collapsed, leaving
only a few beams supporting the
dome which swung like an in
verted pendulum and threatened
to fall at any moment.
Damage to buildings on the Outer
Quadrangle was serious but not
complete; broken bottles and scat
tered chemicals filled the inside of
the Chemistry building, which was
not seriously hurt.
Classes Dismissed
In view of the chaotic conditions
which faced the University admin
istration, President David Stan-
Jordan dismissed classes for the se
mester and granted degrees to sen
iors who were up in their work.
Up on the Row, frame houses
had weathered the tremors and
owners reported fallen chimneys
and cracked plaster as the only
damage.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon listed the
loss of a handsome collection of
steins valued at $200. Chi Psi lodge
was thrown 10 feet off its founda
tion and collapsed in a pile of de
bris.
Coed Takes Uide
At old Roble (now Sequoia) one
coed went to bed on the third floor
and woke up on the second when a
chimney crashed through the roof
and dropped her room down to the
second floor.
Fear of recurring shocks kept
students and faculty members out
of campus buildings during the
day and out of their beds at night.
The girls at Roble brought out
their bedding and slept on the
lawn, guarded by a ring of men
from Encina.
Palo Alto and the Bay Area had
been cut off from the rest of the

world and two professors left on j
Thursday, the day after tha quake, j
carrying a sheaf of wires to anxious !
relatives of students from the East. |
The professors found the telegraph j
offices in San Jose, Oakland, and |
Sacramento so deluged with mes
sages that they were forced to mail
their wires to Reno where they
could finally be sent.
Relief Parties Organized
Relief parties were organized on
the campus to serve in San Fran
cisco where the disastrous fire raged
unchecked for three days. The red
glow of the flames could be seen at
night from the campus.
Students were caught without
money to pay for transportation
home. A rumor that the Univer
sity would make loans was un
founded and local banks ran short
of cash when reserves were de
pleted. San Francisco banks had
been destroyed by fire and their j
vaults were all too hot to be |
opened to give leiief (o branch
banks.
The outlook for the University
was grim; so much that had just
been completed had to be built over
again. There was still a little of
the humorous among the tragic. A
statue of Agassiz had toppled off its
pedestal on the front of the Ad- I
ministration building and j
face downward into the cement !
sidewalk below.


MANY OF ENCINA'S ROOMS were untenable after the
earthquake, and the dormitory's occupants camped on the lawns
and in adjacent fields.

Looking like a bomb - wrecked
city after a heavy air raid, a great
portion of the Stanford campus lay
in ruins 40 years ago this morning
when a series of sharp quakes
rocked the Bay Area and brought
havoc and destruction to thousands.
The disastrous earthquake of
April 18, 1906. struck at 5:13 a.m.
and lasted 47 seconds, tv/o
and doing an estimated $2,800,000
damage to the University.
Rescue Parties Help
Three hundred scantily clad men
gathered in front of Encina after

I they luid escapcd through a hail of
falling debris. Cries of the injured

j building. Six men sleeping in a
