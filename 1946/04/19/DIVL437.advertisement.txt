Who is "STICKY" ....
What is he .... ?
460TICKY" WILSON is the man who
k? has been making gooooood candics
for sweet-toothed Stanfordites since '96.
' That was the year when he enrolled at
Stanford. First he was known as just
plain Ernest Wilson, but then he learned
to make candy and when he started that
everyone called him "Sticky" — and it
stuck!
Today "Sticky" is still at it in his tasty
candy kitchen, making all the candy
Stanford can eat for Easter.
Be sure to get a box for someone you
like.
She'll like it.
