# House Passes OP A Crippler
## Amended Price Bill Goes to Senate Despite Administration Disapproval 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 18.â€”A rebellious House today passed
and sent to the Senate an amendment-riddled price control bill
despite warnings by Economic Stabilizer Chester .Bowles that it
would start the naiion on an inflationary "joy ride to disaster."
The final vote passing the battered bill was 355 to 42.

II was one of the worst legislative
defeats suffered by President Tru
man, who had requested a one-year
extension of price control without
crippling amendments.
Nine-Month Extension
The measure would extend the
Price Control Act only until next
March 31. It carries a series of
amendments which Administration
supporters said would "wreck" price
control.
They began rallying for a show
down fight in the Senate, charging
angrily that the House rebels had
replaced price control and opened
the way for a multi-billion-dollar j
rise in living costs.
Foes in the Senate
But OPA foes were swinging into ]
action in the Senate, too, led by j
Sen. Elmer Thomas (D., Okla.), who
introduced an amendment that j
would abolish practically all price i
controls except on rents.
The Thomas proposal was far i
more sweeping than the House bill,
and would lift OPA ceilings from all
agricultural commodities, petroleum,!
lumber and minerals and metals.
A spokesman for Chester Bowles' |
Office of Economic Stabilization said ;
there was "a damn good chance" |
that President Truman would veto j
the bill if it cleared the Senate in I
its present form, and ask Congress !
to come back with a more accept
able version.
Time Is Short
But time is running out on the
Administration. If Senate action is |
not completed before June 1, Con- j
gress might be unable to push |
through a substitute in the remain- J
ing 30 days before the existing law J
expires.
Leaders of the nation's corn-belt j
farmers denounced the House ver- |
sion as likely to wreck the food con- 112
scrvation program, and a veterans' j
organization called for a presidential j
veto.
