# Nash Says World Government Faces Fight with Sovereignty
## 
### MARY VIRGINIA POND 
| Dr. Vernon Nash, outstanding
journalist and lecturer, stated that,
the framing of a world constitution
i in preparation for ratification by the
t nations of the world was the first
| step toward world government, at
| last night's meeting of the Student
Committee for World Federation.
Center of Fight
In meeting that objective Mr. Nash
| told Stanford students, faculty mem-
I bers, and friends that "the fight will
j center almost entirely around the
| shibboleth of sovereignty."
Mr. Nash described the concept
of national sovereignty as "a man
eating tiger which can't he cured
! by stroking it and saying 'nice
pussy.'" I think sovereignty is
both dangerous and foolish," he
added. "When we have wars, the
sovereign nations fight them."
j Concrete Objective
Mr. Nash stated that, the framing
| of a world constitution would be
j dependent upon everyone uniting
upon that single concrcte objective.
! He made an analogy to the aboli
j tion of slavery, woman's suffrage,
prohibition, and repeal—all move
ments which have succeeded in bc
! ing attained because the persons
I supporting them would not be pulled
'aside from their main objectives to
• discuss other factors secondary in
(time or importance.
Possible Steps
In regard to taking steps toward
! the framing of a constitution for
| world government, Mr. Nash point
| ed out that there are any number of
' ways that the necessary steps could
|be taken.
Among the methods which could
he used arc diplomatic negotia
tions, the authorizing of a subordi
nate committee by the United Na
tions Assembly, or the assembling
of a constitutional assembly" by
asking all nations of the world to
submit members who they felt
would be competent in drawing
up a constitution.
System Necessary
"However, if we want results we
i need a systematic effort which can

not. be attained without some or
ganization," Mr. Nash declared. "A
mass movement is necessary.
World government won't be reached
through political leaders until the
popular pressure is strong enough
to break the delay of a time lag."
Mr. Nash added that people won't
get "on the band-wagon until the
wagon starts to move," nor will
they join a movement, which is con
stantly "fractionalizing" and break
ing up into smaller ineffectual
movements. "The way to solve the
problem is to have on organization
take tli" lead, and it will eventually
absorb the others."
In regard to the present United
Nations organization, Mr. Nash
stated, "Anything less than enough
won't do. You can't jump across a
chasm that takes three jumps by
taking only two jumps. Do we
have to jump off the cliff a third
time to show-What gravity works?"
Cost of the War
The journalist asserted that the
price paid for the ineffectiveness
of the League of Nations was the
sccond World War. "That war, it
is believed, will cost one trillion
dollars," Mr. Nash said, "In other
words, the cost is equal to one
dollar per second for thirty thou
sand years."
Mr. Nash added that no one can
know if Russia would enter the
world government unless it is tried.
"But," he stated, "if Great Britain
and America would stop trying to
make the Pacific Ocean an Ameri
can lake and the Mediterranean a
British lake, maybe the Russians
would come around."

Possible Steps
In regard to taking steps toward
! the framing of a constitution for
| world government, Mr. Nash point
| ed out that there are any number of
' ways that the necessary steps could
|be taken.
Among the methods which could
he used arc diplomatic negotia
tions, the authorizing of a subordi
nate committee by the United Na
tions Assembly, or the assembling
of a constitutional assembly" by
asking all nations of the world to
submit members who they felt
would be competent in drawing
up a constitution.
System Necessary
"However, if we want results we
i need a systematic effort which can

not. be attained without some or
ganization," Mr. Nash declared. "A
mass movement is necessary.
World government won't be reached
through political leaders until the
popular pressure is strong enough
to break the delay of a time lag."
Mr. Nash added that people won't
get "on the band-wagon until the
wagon starts to move," nor will
they join a movement, which is con
stantly "fractionalizing" and break
ing up into smaller ineffectual
movements. "The way to solve the
problem is to have on organization
take tli" lead, and it will eventually
absorb the others."
In regard to the present United
Nations organization, Mr. Nash
stated, "Anything less than enough
won't do. You can't jump across a
chasm that takes three jumps by
taking only two jumps. Do we
have to jump off the cliff a third
time to show-What gravity works?"
Cost of the War
The journalist asserted that the
price paid for the ineffectiveness
of the League of Nations was the
sccond World War. "That war, it
is believed, will cost one trillion
dollars," Mr. Nash said, "In other
words, the cost is equal to one
dollar per second for thirty thou
sand years."
Mr. Nash added that no one can
know if Russia would enter the
world government unless it is tried.
"But," he stated, "if Great Britain
and America would stop trying to
make the Pacific Ocean an Ameri
can lake and the Mediterranean a
British lake, maybe the Russians
would come around."
| Dr. Vernon Nash, outstanding
journalist and lecturer, stated that,
the framing of a world constitution
i in preparation for ratification by the
t nations of the world was the first
| step toward world government, at
| last night's meeting of the Student
Committee for World Federation.
Center of Fight
In meeting that objective Mr. Nash
| told Stanford students, faculty mem-
I bers, and friends that "the fight will
j center almost entirely around the
| shibboleth of sovereignty."
Mr. Nash described the concept
of national sovereignty as "a man
eating tiger which can't he cured
! by stroking it and saying 'nice
pussy.'" I think sovereignty is
both dangerous and foolish," he
added. "When we have wars, the
sovereign nations fight them."
j Concrete Objective
Mr. Nash stated that, the framing
| of a world constitution would be
j dependent upon everyone uniting
upon that single concrcte objective.
! He made an analogy to the aboli
j tion of slavery, woman's suffrage,
prohibition, and repeal—all move
ments which have succeeded in bc
! ing attained because the persons
