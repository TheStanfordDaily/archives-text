# Four Entries In Hospital Handicap
## 
### 
Dibble must bo a nugget. Every
body wants it.

Entries in the race fur the hos
pital, which closes June 30, were
raised to four yesterday when it
was learned the Army may keep
the plant, and the Menlo Park Li
ons Club asked that a portion of the
130-acre site be turned into a play
ground for the city.
Here's how the handicap stacks
up:
1. The Army, which now oper
ates the hospital, is apparently
considering holding the property
for continued use as a regular
Army hospital.
2. Stanford has been negotiat
ing for some time to get the Dib
ble facilities allocated as part of
the:! 00 housing units authorized
by the Federal Public Housing
Administration.
3. San Mateo County has re
quested that the hospital we re
tained as a temporary veterans'
hospital.
4. The Lions Club, in asking for
some of the grounds for a recre
ation center, reported that the
Veterans Administration in Wash
ington has twice already refused
the use of Dibble as a veterans'
facility because of its unsuita
bilities.
The county bases its bid for the
property on the fact that recently
mental patients have been sent to
Agnew at county expense and the
supervisors feel these patients
should be treated at government
oxpen.se.
However, space for psychiatric
wards at Dibble is limited and this
may be the reason, as reported by
the Lions Club, I hat the V.A. has
already turned down such a re
quest.
The site asked by the Lions Club
for its playground is on the hospital
grounds bordering on the Southern
Pacific railroad tracks. The tract of
nearly 35 acres includes a swim
ming pool, gymnasium, auditorium,
baseball field, and other facilities.
