# Army May Keep Dibble As Permanent Hospital
## Stanford Continues Negotiation, Awaits Confirmation of Report 
### 
The Daily learned definitely last night that Army authorintias
are considering converting Dibble General Hospital into a per
manent military installation, a move that would effectively cancel
Stanford's plans for a veterans housing unit there.
Officers at Sixth Army headquarters refused to comment on

the rumor that the move had already
been decided upon, and referred re
porters 1o the Surgeon General in
Washington. A telegram sent by the
Daily to that officer had not been
answered at midnight last night.
Army Wants Dibble
The Daily's source, whose identity
cannot be divulged, stated that Army
authorities are in favor of spending
money originally intended for im
proving Letterman General Hospital
in San Francisco to convert Dibble
into a permanent hospital which
would eventually replace Letterman
as the Army's main medical installa
tion in this area.
Tresidder Uninformed
President Donald B. Tresidder
when told of these developments
yesterday stated that it was the first
he had heard of them.
"This is new to me," he said.
Both Dr. Tresidder and Business
Manager Alf Brandin emphasized
that negotiations are continuing for
the use of Dibble, and that, as far
as they know now reconversion will
begin immediately after the con
tracts are signed by both Stanford
and the present owners.
300 Units Assigned
The Federal Public Housing Au
thority announced last Saturday
that 200 additional temporary vet
erans' housing units had been added
to the 100 already assigned to the
University, bringing to 300 the num
ber of units which Stanford has
asked to have located at Dibble.
As the wards of Dibble, for which
the War Department has announced
a June 30 closing date, are cleared,
the space is turned over the FPHA
for assignment to civilian use. Seven
of the Dibble wrads have already
been declared surplus.
