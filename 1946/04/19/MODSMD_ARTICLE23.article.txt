# Convention Be Damned?
## 
### 
Ths weight of student opinion hangs heavy
over the heads of policy making, and would
be precedent-breaking students of Stanford
University. It dictates what we shall and
shall not do, and condemns without analysis
the actions of persons out of step with those
who tread the "straight and narrow."
Unfortunately, this tyrannical, unadaptable
public opinion is one moulded about the
typical Stanford student, in complete and
car sful alignment with the typical Stanford
atti: Ltd-- 1 ?. The typicality of both was
ach ; eved somewhere in the past and has
been referred to, clung to, and—perhaps un
consciously —revered, when new ideas or
problems of unconformity presented them
selves.
We don't advocate radical moves such as
have been bruited about other campuses:
Communist rallies, impeachment of student
officers and university officials, veterans set
ting up an opposition student government.
But we mourn the fact that such ideas rarely

occur, that the ideas of Stanfordites are for
the most part lent to them by approved "idea
men" of generations in the irrelevant past.
But why have ideas such as having a stu
dents' literary magazine, an annual Pow-
Wow, a Cellar survey, been abandoned after
inconclusive talk and experimentation? Why
did area representation arouse opposition
and why now does it receive half-hearted
support from its members? Because such
ideas require initiative and a different slant
to old channels of thinking.
Many campus longstanding rales have
been followed with resultant inefficacy
merely because "rules is rules" and there's
no question about it. And many of the stu
dents' nobler impulses- "Heifers for Relief"
—are frustrated because of "traditional" poli
cies.
An uncritical acceptance of convention and
an unconsidered repugnance to newness will
result in stagnancy. Stanford students, we
believe, are afraid to break out of tradition
into progress. — BMV
