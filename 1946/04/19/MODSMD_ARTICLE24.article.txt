# Time Out for Wondering

### 
The housing shortage has raised other is
suer: that are a lot more fundamental, down
on the Farm. Stanford students are wonder
ing now about the stand a University should
take on many related problems, and it's time
that we were wondering.
Credit should go to campus veterans for
net raising a howl that "the world owes us a
living;" 0:1 the contrary, they have a sane
appreciation of the G.I. Bill of Rights for what
it's worth, and a broad, thoughtful conception
of the basic reasons for getting a college edu
cation.
And not only does the G.I. Bill help the
individual veteran by sometimes giving an
eible student a chance to attend Stanford who
would not otherwise be able to swing it finan
cially, it helps the University in another
sense, by broadening the scope of student
body. One of the drawbacks to a private uni
versity has always been that it must be sup

ported to a large extent by tuition fees . . .
thu3 drawing most students from a narrow
income group. It's a benefit to have aptitude
take a more important part in entrance limi
tations than finances.

As far as housing goes, we continue to
support the administration in its efforts to
procure housing for married veterans; as
long as the University's capacity to operate
is not jeopardized by these efforts, they can
not be slackened. Right now the majority
of veterans have been absorbed into campus
residences, so that the problem, though ur
gent, does not look unsolvable.

All of our attempts to outline the postwar
patterns in which Stanford can best serve
its educational purpose are over-simplified,
but they add up to the fact , that with con
science and intelligence, both students and
the administration can make those patterns
liberal and strong.
