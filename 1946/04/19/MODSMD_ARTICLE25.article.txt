### H. D. THOREAU 
The following letter was received by the Daily
yesterday. We believe it is worth reading:
DL'ar Mr. Thoreau:
• In reply to your editorial viciousness in the Daily
of the 17th.
Yes, it is too bad that the campus has become so
crowded with "crippled veterans" riding around
lor "a brass ring and a BA"—free—and by the
courtesy of the taxpayers.
i et us remind you, Mr. Thoreau. that it was
in an effort to repay these veteran.? an unapayable
debt that the taxpayers, through Congress, voted
for ihe GI Bill. They, at least, seemed to believe
that your "happy equation" was neither happy
nor fair to those who could not attend Stanford
because they were not born with the proverbial
silver spoon.
Let us further remind you that if it weren't for
these veterans, some of whom subsequently did
become crippled, there would be no Stanford, much
less any of the 133 contemplated improvements.
During the war there was nothing too good for
the boys and girls in the service. But now, scarcely
i ight months following the cessation of hostilities,
your leathers are ruffled by those who have rushed
to Stanford in an effort to make up for lost time.
Il has been our belief that colleges and univer
sities exist fundamentally to educate and not to

amass monumental buildings. We humbly apolo
gize if this thesis is incorrect for it would be ex
tremely .velfish for veterans to search for an edu
cation at the expense of these material projects.
However we think that there are a few people on
campus—even outside the ranks of veterans —who
will rate the educational function of Stanford the
primary one. It is to avail themselves of this very
thing that veterans come to Stanford, but in order
to do that they must have housing.
The veterans are not asking for free housing—to
be paid from the tuitions of future students. We
are asking the administration to procure temporary
housing which we will be willing, even anxious, to
help finance. College and universities throughout
the United States have been able to provide this
service. We do not feel that it is presumptuous to
ask this administration to do likewise.
No veteran wants to feel that his physical pres
ence will prevent the improvement of Stanford.
And we do not believe that the fulfillment of the
needs of the veterans will do that. It is just a
matter of putting first things first.
Try to understand, Mr. Thoreau, that the veterans
are now an intrinsic part of Stanford and it can
never be said of a first rate educational institution
that it puts the needs of its campus above the needs
of its students.

i ight months following the cessation of hostilities,
your leathers are ruffled by those who have rushed
to Stanford in an effort to make up for lost time.
Il has been our belief that colleges and univer
sities exist fundamentally to educate and not to

amass monumental buildings. We humbly apolo
gize if this thesis is incorrect for it would be ex
tremely .velfish for veterans to search for an edu
cation at the expense of these material projects.
However we think that there are a few people on
campus—even outside the ranks of veterans —who
will rate the educational function of Stanford the
primary one. It is to avail themselves of this very
thing that veterans come to Stanford, but in order
to do that they must have housing.
The veterans are not asking for free housing—to
be paid from the tuitions of future students. We
are asking the administration to procure temporary
housing which we will be willing, even anxious, to
help finance. College and universities throughout
the United States have been able to provide this
service. We do not feel that it is presumptuous to
ask this administration to do likewise.
No veteran wants to feel that his physical pres
ence will prevent the improvement of Stanford.
And we do not believe that the fulfillment of the
needs of the veterans will do that. It is just a
matter of putting first things first.
Try to understand, Mr. Thoreau, that the veterans
are now an intrinsic part of Stanford and it can
never be said of a first rate educational institution
that it puts the needs of its campus above the needs
of its students.

The following letter was received by the Daily
yesterday. We believe it is worth reading:
DL'ar Mr. Thoreau:
• In reply to your editorial viciousness in the Daily
of the 17th.
Yes, it is too bad that the campus has become so
crowded with "crippled veterans" riding around
lor "a brass ring and a BA"—free—and by the
courtesy of the taxpayers.
i et us remind you, Mr. Thoreau. that it was
in an effort to repay these veteran.? an unapayable
debt that the taxpayers, through Congress, voted
for ihe GI Bill. They, at least, seemed to believe
that your "happy equation" was neither happy
nor fair to those who could not attend Stanford
because they were not born with the proverbial
silver spoon.
Let us further remind you that if it weren't for
these veterans, some of whom subsequently did
become crippled, there would be no Stanford, much
less any of the 133 contemplated improvements.
During the war there was nothing too good for
the boys and girls in the service. But now, scarcely
i ight months following the cessation of hostilities,
your leathers are ruffled by those who have rushed
to Stanford in an effort to make up for lost time.
