Ham's Head or somebody like that there is going
to put on a spring show. It is now planning to pro
duce "Dark of the Moon."
They are going to produce this epic for a number
of reasons. The main one being that they so snafued
the annual spring show deal that at the last minute
they chanced upon this "Dark of . . ." business and
are now feverishly trying to get it in good shape
by show time.
One factor which is causing them no little trouble
is that at this writing they do not have the "rights"
to produce the show.
But to explain why we earlier said that they
snufued the spring show.
Over a period of years it has been the custom
to run a spring show. A show that is written as
an original production by students.
But Ram's Head is a very friendly group. They
like to keep everything nice and clubby. They
had big plans to run a spring show. One writ by
a student. Few people on the campus were aware
that they could submit scripts. Few did. The
reason few knew and few did is that Ram's Head
already had their own playpicked out.
About one week before last quarter ended Ram's
Head, feeling sure that they had a good show, de
cided they would consider scripts from the student

body at large. Al! you had to do was write your
show in about two weeks. One of which was exam
wCek.
But someone made an error in judgment. The
lad chosen to produce the show didn't come through
with one (hat satisfied the Ram's Head leaders.
There they were. They had kept the writing of
the show among such a small group that the re
sult was no show at all. Thus their decision to run
a Broadway show.
This is not the first time that such tactics have
been used by the Memorial Auditorium Moguls.
They ran a contest a while back. "Let's see
who on campus can write the best one-act play,"
tht*y said. The only trouble was that they said it
just about one week before the plays were to be
in. The funny part about it was that they did get
plays. But it really isn't funy at all. Because the
students that wrote the plays were guess who?
You guessed it, you clever little demons. The
winning plays were written by the Ram's Head in
siders who had the story of the contest weeks
ahead of time.
By the way, I'm running a novel writing con
test. Manuscripts must be in by 5-p.m. today. The
contest is open to all students.

This is not the first time that such tactics have
been used by the Memorial Auditorium Moguls.
They ran a contest a while back. "Let's see
who on campus can write the best one-act play,"
tht*y said. The only trouble was that they said it
just about one week before the plays were to be
in. The funny part about it was that they did get
plays. But it really isn't funy at all. Because the
students that wrote the plays were guess who?
You guessed it, you clever little demons. The
winning plays were written by the Ram's Head in
siders who had the story of the contest weeks
ahead of time.
By the way, I'm running a novel writing con
test. Manuscripts must be in by 5-p.m. today. The
contest is open to all students.
Ham's Head or somebody like that there is going
to put on a spring show. It is now planning to pro
duce "Dark of the Moon."
They are going to produce this epic for a number
of reasons. The main one being that they so snafued
the annual spring show deal that at the last minute
they chanced upon this "Dark of . . ." business and
are now feverishly trying to get it in good shape
by show time.
One factor which is causing them no little trouble
is that at this writing they do not have the "rights"
to produce the show.
But to explain why we earlier said that they
snufued the spring show.
Over a period of years it has been the custom
to run a spring show. A show that is written as
an original production by students.
But Ram's Head is a very friendly group. They
like to keep everything nice and clubby. They
had big plans to run a spring show. One writ by
a student. Few people on the campus were aware
that they could submit scripts. Few did. The
reason few knew and few did is that Ram's Head
already had their own playpicked out.
About one week before last quarter ended Ram's
Head, feeling sure that they had a good show, de
cided they would consider scripts from the student

body at large. Al! you had to do was write your
show in about two weeks. One of which was exam
wCek.
But someone made an error in judgment. The
lad chosen to produce the show didn't come through
with one (hat satisfied the Ram's Head leaders.
There they were. They had kept the writing of
the show among such a small group that the re
sult was no show at all. Thus their decision to run
a Broadway show.
