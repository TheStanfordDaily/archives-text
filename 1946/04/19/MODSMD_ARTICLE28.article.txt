By JAMES JOSEPH
When Stanford skiers take to the
Sugar Bowl downhill - slopes this
weekend at Donner Summit for the
Vanderbilt Cup meet, John "Boots"
Blatt — Stanford's ski chief — and
rated third in California amateur
competition, will pilot the team.
Back of Blatt's skimanship is a his
tory of a sports-loving family that
led Stanford to victory in pre-war
skiing days.
Vanderbilt Cu|>
The Vanderbilt Cup meet is the
last big event of the year, and will
draw experts from University of
Washington, Nevada University,
and Denver U.
Blatt returns from the Army for I
his first quarter to hurdle jumping i
slopes. Jumping this weekend will j
mark his first attempt at leaping
competition since a spill on Mt. Las- i
sen in 1941 fractured his ankle.
Pall Team Belter
While the ski captain doesn't
"think we'll win the meet this j
y/?ar," he hopes "for a very good j
team next fall when many of the !
older skiers return from the serv- I
ices."
Boots' brother, Bob, long - time
Stanford skiman and California |
downhill champ for two years, is j
still in service but expects to return |
to Stanford next fall. Bob Blatt is 1
skiing European slopes this year as ■

a member of a special service team
in the mountain sport. He has vis
ited most of the big European ski
centers.
Skiing Blatt Family
The Blatt family of Palo Alto is
remarkable in that every member
of the family skis—and most of them
well. Boots put on his first pair of
; skis at ten; his younger brother,
Herbert, still in Navy service, start
! Ed skiing at six. Herbert will prob
ably go to the University of Cali
fornia.
Stanford's place in skiing in the
last several years has been largely
maintained by the Blatts. Right now
| Boots is hoping to team with his
I brother for some records next fall.
Minor Sport
Skiing is rated a minor sport at
I Stanford, and Ski Club members
j who weekend at Yosemite or Don
! nor Pass pay their own expenses.
' Boots hopes a little wistfully that
j his sport will get official backing by
I the University soon.
For a group of enthusiasts who've
i largely taken the interest of Stan
| ford's ski record on their own
, shoulders, Stanford skiers copped
j honors in the Vanderbilt, Silver
j Belt Race, and the Reno Carnival
j in other years.
| Ski Awards
Bob Blatt took the Bradley Plate
! at Sun Valley in 1940. The award

is considered, though unofficially, as
the national intercollegiate cham
pionship.
Boots Blatt. who piloted a P-38
in the Philippines during the war,
has been rated a class "A" skier
since he was 15. In 1941 he was
seventh in the Harriman Cup opens
at Sun Valley. The same year he
took fourth in the Nationals, an in
vitational meet.
Skiing Safe
Looking back now on his Mt,
Lassen accident that put a stop to
jumping for almost five years, he
says that "skiing is no more dan
gerous than any other sport," and
blames himself for the accident.
As president of the Ski Club at
Stanford and captain of the team,
his weekend worries are many.
During the season, the club and
team journey the long distance to
Yosemite every weekend. The Yo
semite season ends next week.
Postwar Team
Stanford skiers are this quarter
waxing up competitive skis for the
first time since 1942. And "Boots"
Blatt may be leading his team and
family to another Stanford tradition
of Blatts on skis.

weekend at Donner Summit for the
Vanderbilt Cup meet, John "Boots"
Blatt — Stanford's ski chief — and
rated third in California amateur
competition, will pilot the team.
