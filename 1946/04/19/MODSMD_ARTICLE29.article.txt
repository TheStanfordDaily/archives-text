# Swimming Meets Will Revive Use of Women's Gym Pool
## 
### DOT DISHON 
Scene of many lively intercolleg
iate swimming meets, the pool at
the Women's Gym for 15 years has
been a favorite part of the physical
education program.
Costing $25,092, the pool was built
in 1931 at the same time as the gym.
The original plans called for three
pools in a row, the other two placed
where the present hockey field is.
George Wagner, then University
building contractor, supervised the
construction.
Wheeler Holds Record
Meets with Cal, and Mills will
bring swimming back to a competi
tive sport after being discontinued
during the war because of trans
portation difficulties. The pool has
its own set of records, the last of
which were made in the spring of
1944. Connie Wheeler holds records
for back crawl at IG.O and breast
stroke at 17.7. The previous back
crawl record was made by Bobbie
Jones in 1941 at 17.0.
Elizabeth Trompas is also the
holder of two records, for 50-yard
and 25-yard free style at 29.4 and
13.0 made in li) 38. The record for
1.00-yard relay was set in 1938 by the
class of 1938-39.
In 14 years of use only one serious
accident and no drownings have oc
curred in the pool. This happened
in 1933 when Lee Stearns, student,
was diving from the high board.
Another swimmer dived from the
side ol' the pool at the same time,
resulting' in a right-angle collision
in which Miss Stearns' back was
broken.
Midnight Swimming
The pool grew to be a favorite
spot not only for the campus but for
Sequoia high school boys who used
to gather there for midnight swims.
Since it was impossible to patrol
the pool and the administration felt

it a dangerous spot to be left un
guarded, the University built the
wire fence which is now kept locked
during closed hours of the pool.
Eight classes in regular and com
petitive swimming, diving, life sav
ing, and instructing are functioning
this quarter. Mrs. Marie Fenner,
swimming instructor, reports a
growing interest in teaching, indi
cated by the unusually large class
of 19 students enrolled. Classes are
formed only in autumn and spring
quartres. The pool closes in winter
due to the larger number of colds
and other illnesses.
Daily Filter Tests
Chlorine is used in the water to
keep down the bacterial content?
Two filters are employed, allowing
the water to circulate completely
i three times every 24 hours. At
; present the pool is running on only
one filter while the other is being
dug out and repaired. The Univer
[ sity Health Service makes test for
j infectious germs, and Mrs. Fenner
makes daily tests to determine the
chlorine content and ph acidity-ai
| kalinity of the water.

of 19 students enrolled. Classes are
formed only in autumn and spring
quartres. The pool closes in winter
due to the larger number of colds
and other illnesses.
Daily Filter Tests
Chlorine is used in the water to
keep down the bacterial content?
Two filters are employed, allowing
the water to circulate completely
i three times every 24 hours. At
; present the pool is running on only
one filter while the other is being
dug out and repaired. The Univer
[ sity Health Service makes test for
j infectious germs, and Mrs. Fenner
makes daily tests to determine the
chlorine content and ph acidity-ai
| kalinity of the water.
Scene of many lively intercolleg
iate swimming meets, the pool at
the Women's Gym for 15 years has
been a favorite part of the physical
education program.
Costing $25,092, the pool was built
in 1931 at the same time as the gym.
The original plans called for three
pools in a row, the other two placed
where the present hockey field is.
George Wagner, then University
building contractor, supervised the
construction.
Wheeler Holds Record
Meets with Cal, and Mills will
bring swimming back to a competi
tive sport after being discontinued
during the war because of trans
portation difficulties. The pool has
its own set of records, the last of
which were made in the spring of
1944. Connie Wheeler holds records
for back crawl at IG.O and breast
stroke at 17.7. The previous back
crawl record was made by Bobbie
Jones in 1941 at 17.0.
Elizabeth Trompas is also the
holder of two records, for 50-yard
and 25-yard free style at 29.4 and
13.0 made in li) 38. The record for
1.00-yard relay was set in 1938 by the
class of 1938-39.
In 14 years of use only one serious
accident and no drownings have oc
curred in the pool. This happened
in 1933 when Lee Stearns, student,
was diving from the high board.
Another swimmer dived from the
side ol' the pool at the same time,
resulting' in a right-angle collision
in which Miss Stearns' back was
broken.
Midnight Swimming
The pool grew to be a favorite
spot not only for the campus but for
Sequoia high school boys who used
to gather there for midnight swims.
Since it was impossible to patrol
the pool and the administration felt

it a dangerous spot to be left un
guarded, the University built the
wire fence which is now kept locked
during closed hours of the pool.
Eight classes in regular and com
petitive swimming, diving, life sav
ing, and instructing are functioning
this quarter. Mrs. Marie Fenner,
swimming instructor, reports a
growing interest in teaching, indi
cated by the unusually large class
of 19 students enrolled. Classes are
formed only in autumn and spring
quartres. The pool closes in winter
due to the larger number of colds
and other illnesses.
