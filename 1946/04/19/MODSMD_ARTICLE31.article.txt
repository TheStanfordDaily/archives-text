# Colds To Be Combated In Rest Home for Men
## 
### KAY DALEY 
Attention, all men who have
caught colds from the changeable
spring weather!
The Men's Rest Home is now
open and ready to help you get over
it before it reaches the pneumonia
stage. The Rest Home opened Mon
day, April 14, after being closed
since the end of spring quarter last
year. The Rest Home, now under
the direction of Mrs. E. M. Hog
land, has a new location at 535
Salvatierra.
The Men's Rest Home has been
operated by the Stanford Mothers'
Club for a number of years, as has
the Women's Rest Home. Mrs. C. Y.
Allen was director for about seven
years until last year. The Rest
Home was located in Dr. Frederick
Terman's home at G59 Salvatierra,
but since Dr. Terman returned this
fall it was necessary to find a new
location.
The Rest Home will now aceom

modate six persons, and will be op
erated in the same manner in which
the Women's Rest Home is run,
Mrs. Hogland said. Communicable
diseases will still be treated in the
Palo Alto Hospital, and the Rest
Home will be used primarily for the
care of colds and minor illnesses
and injuries. There will be no visit
ing hours at the Rest Home.
If you feel that you just can't go
to another class and want to get
rid of that cold and sore throat in
a hurry, remember that you do
have a place where you can relax
under expert care for a few days.
Vital statistics: location, 535 Salva
