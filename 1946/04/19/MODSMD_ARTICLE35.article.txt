# Card Golfers To Meet San Jose Slate Saturday
## 
### 
Tomorrow morning at 9:30 on the
I Stanford golf course, the Farm's
varsity golf team will swing into
action for the first time since 1942.
There will be six matches against
the San Jose State Spartans; all are
open to the public.
Coach Eddie Twiggs has chosen
the six men who will compete for
Stanford. They are, in order of
i their positions: Frank McCann, Tom
I Lambie, Jack Schuler, Bob Car-
I dinal, Don Jones, and Gordon Dot
! zour.
Frank McCann has turned in the
I most impressive scores to date,
j Last Saturday McCann played
, around the Stanford course with a
i sizzling 68. Playing against his will
; will be Eli Bariteau, 17-year-old
[ number one man of the Spartans'
I links team.
Bariteau is in the semi-finals in
| the Northern California Champion
! ships at Lake Merced. His best
score at San Jose has been a 69. On
the Stanford course, new to him
and also one of the most difficult
[ in California, he is expected to
; shoot around 75. This should be the
best match of the day with two top
flight golfers. McCann was on the
1942 Stanford team which won the
j N.C.A.A. championship.
Second man on the Stanford team
is Tom Lambie, who shot a 70 last
week. Matched against him is El
mer Anderson, a former service
man who gets off long shots, but is
inconsistent and wild. Anderson
! shoots around 80.
Jack Schuler, winner of the Port-
I land city championship last sum
mer, will be matched against Bob
| Ouellette. Schuler's best on the

Stanford course is a 73. Ouellette
shoots around 78 to 80.
Number four man on the Farm
team is Bob Cardinal, who has not
been playing at his best yet this
year. Cardinal qualified for the all-
University championships with a 77,
which Coach Twiggs thinks is far
from his best.
The other two men on the Stan
ford team are Don Jones and Gor
don Dotzour, both excellent golf
ers.
Rounding out the San Jose team
are Wally McCand. Dick Ohlen,
and Bob Steele. The order in which
they will play has not been de
cided, so which of them will appear
against Cardinal, Jones, and Dot
zour is not known as yet.
The Spartans have already had
one match this season, in which
they defeated the St. Mary's Gaels
11V2 to 3V&. Notable, however, was
the absence of Herman Wedemeyer,
top man of the Gaels' team, who
was playing baseball against Cal
that day.
The Spartans should not be too
difficult for the Card linksmen. and,
barring an upset, the Indians should
prove themselves the potential coast
champions that Eddie Twiggs thinks
them to be.
