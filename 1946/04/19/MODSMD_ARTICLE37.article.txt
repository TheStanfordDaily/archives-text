# Intramurals Shake-up Due
## 
### 
Coach Elwyn Bugge forecast a
decided shakeup in the intramural
j sol'tball leagues late yesterday as a
J result of the poor "turnout" of some
of the signed-up teams. Forfeits
i have become so prevalent during
j the first week of play that steps must
| be taken to abolish them.
Failure to Appear
Thus those teams that failed to
| appear for the opening games will
be required to inform Mr. Bugge
before Monday afternoon if they
desire to continue. If the response
is sparse, a revised schedule will
consolidate the two leagues into
one.
In league play yesterday, Chi Psi
j staggered through to a 12-7 tri
umph over Phi Delta Theta in the
j only contest played in League I.
: The victors thus protected their un
i defeated status and now share first
: place with Sigma Nu. Jefferson, and
i Encina 4E.
; Forfeit !List
The lengthy list of forfeits in
League I included Gerona A.C., En
cina 2E. and Tuft Hall, which failed
to appear for their games. Two
contests were also called off in
League II with the Hilltoppers and
J Jackson Hall listed as absent.
League II found the Betas shut
ting out Harrison, 3-0, in one of
' the most professional-looking tilts
of the afternoon. Meanwhile a last
: inning rally, replete with a game
winning home run, gave Encina 1W
I an exciting 5-4 triumph over Bu
! chanan.
