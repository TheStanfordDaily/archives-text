# Housing Committee Suggests Two New Ratio System Plans
## 
### 
Believing that the majority of Stanford women want some kind of
ratio system of classcs in each living group, Housing Committee will pre
sent two ideas for a ratio system to Woman's Conference Monday.
Any type of plan that is used in room drawing, however, hinges on the
Administration.
One system the committee has been discussing is to base the ratio on
-fthe proportion of women in each

j class taking part in the room draw
! ing. This ratio would be applied to
! the vacancies in each living group.
The other system is to base each
5 living group's class ratio on the
| proportion of people in each class
jin the University as a whole. A
I perfect ratio Would be worked out
; for each living group and begin
i ning with this quarter's drawing,
: would be worked toward as a fu
ture ideal.
Must Be Easy
It is necessary that a plan be
easily administered, Phyllis Suth
erland, Housing Committee chair
-1 man, said. Whether or not there
will be a ratio system at all in room
drawing this quarter has not been
decided.
