Ought not the United States to
have a national literature?
This question has been discussed
and debated by writers, both Amer
ican and foreign, for a period of 150
years, said Ernest Marchand, as
sistant professor of English, yester
day in his talk on "A National
American Literature: The History
of an Idea" in the Symposium on
American Studies Series.
English Influence
"Up until approximately the time
we declared our political independ
ence the colonists were thinking of
themselves as English-speaking peo
ples in 'a new land, and not as mem
bers of a new nation," said the
speaker.
"Then we entered a new stage in
our development when we felt in
ferior to European culture, and as
a result we proceeded to boast of
our independence and demanded a
distinctively national literature.
Pioneers
Among the first writers to break
down the prejudices against Ameri
can literature were Joel Barlow,
Charles Brown, and James Feni
more Cooper, stated Mr. Marchand.
The war of 1812, and the resultant

surge of nationalism gave impetus
to the demand, which jibes from
European critics that "America has
no forefathers, no antiquity, no mys
tery, no cathedrals or castles but
only commonplace prosperity in
open sunlight" increased.
The advent in 1930 of Jacksonian
democracy, and the opening of the
West brought the question of a na
tional literature to the foreground
again and Emerson wrote "the past
is dead, and our apprenticeship to
foreign culture is over."
Different Ideas
There were American writers,
however, stated the speaker, who
were not in complete accord with
this feeling. Edgar Allan Poe said
of American themes "the world is
the only proper theme for a writ
er," while Thomas Lowell wrote
"any literature in so far as it is na
tional is a disease."
Mr. Marchand said that he be
lieves the United States has now
entered the final stage of her de
velopment, which is that time when
writers write because Ihcy have
something to say and not because
they feel a patriotic obligation.
"The evidence for this is that the
clamor for a national literature has
died down," he concluded.—Hansen

The war of 1812, and the resultant

surge of nationalism gave impetus
to the demand, which jibes from
European critics that "America has
no forefathers, no antiquity, no mys
tery, no cathedrals or castles but
only commonplace prosperity in
open sunlight" increased.
The advent in 1930 of Jacksonian
democracy, and the opening of the
West brought the question of a na
tional literature to the foreground
again and Emerson wrote "the past
is dead, and our apprenticeship to
foreign culture is over."
Different Ideas
There were American writers,
however, stated the speaker, who
were not in complete accord with
this feeling. Edgar Allan Poe said
of American themes "the world is
the only proper theme for a writ
er," while Thomas Lowell wrote
"any literature in so far as it is na
tional is a disease."
Mr. Marchand said that he be
lieves the United States has now
entered the final stage of her de
velopment, which is that time when
writers write because Ihcy have
something to say and not because
they feel a patriotic obligation.
"The evidence for this is that the
clamor for a national literature has
died down," he concluded.—Hansen
