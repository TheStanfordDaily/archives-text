### 
Scholarships came up for atten
tion at Excom Wednesday when
$1,000 from the A.S.S.U.. treasury
was appropriated to the student
founded Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur
Scholarship Fund.
In an effort to obtain money for
the nearly-defunct Union Club
Scholarship Fund, Union Club pro
posed contracting a professional
photographer to take pictures of stu
dents at large campus functions,
with 10 per cent of the profits going
toward the Union fund.
The contract was approved, with
Excom's blessing, to last till the end
of spring quarter.
