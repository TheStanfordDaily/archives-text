# Reports Say Hoover Reluctant to Return
## 
### 
Washington, April 1H (UP). â€”
Former President Herbert Hoover
would prefer to continue his tour
of famine areas abroad instead of
returning to the United States
now to report to the American
|M>ople as suggested hy President
Truman, an informed source said
tonight.
Mr. Hoover is said to believe
his job is "only half complete."
President Truman cabled Mr.
Hoover yesterday suggesting that
the former President interrupt
bis worldwide famine inspection
trip, come home and bring "for
cibly and dramatically to public
attention . . . the facts about
(food) conditions in Europe."
Despite his reluctance to re
turn now, however, it was under
stood Mr. Hoover will accede to
Mr. Truman's request if told it is
absolutely necessary. Mr. Hoo
ver, now in Cairo, had planned
to visit India, China, and "pos
sibly" Japan before returning
home.
Mr. Truman made it clear in
his cable that Mr. Hoover should
return to complete his mission af
ter a brief stop-over in the U.S.
but, it was learned, that this stop
over might last as long as a
month.
