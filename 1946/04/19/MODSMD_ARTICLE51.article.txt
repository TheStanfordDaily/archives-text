## 
### 
Robert Wulker, busy putting a
little more wear on all of Van John- j
son's old uniforms, has sneaked out j
of bellboy buttons and Army khaki
into a sailor suit, with no additions !
or subtractions in personality or
acting skill. Walker is paired with ,
June Allyson this weekend in "The
Sailor Takes a Wife" at the Stan
ford.
Reconversion to Tweeds
Actually reconversion to tweeds
comes after the first ten minutes of
the movie. A "just married" com
edy from beginning to end, "The
Sailor Takes a Wife" is consistent
and mildly funny, but even the at- '
tempts of June Allyson can't «ive it
much significance. The Thursday !
afternoon audience simpered rather
than laughed at the coy antics of
"young love."
Rochester, who manages to be
funny even in an uphill situation, >
can't do a great deal with the lines l
he has in "The Sailor Takes a
Wife." Hume Cronyn, as "Freddie
Potts, of Potts' Pots," is one of the
brighter islands, but d ewey-eyed ■
Walker plus dewey-cyed Allyson
all but submerge him.
