# Baseballers Vie with St. Mary's Tomorrow; Track Team Will Meet S.J. State, Alameda
## 
### 
In an attempt to capture Stanford's fourth win
in eleven starts, Coach Harry Wolter will pitch
big Larry Wolf against the St. Mary's Pre-Flight
nine in tomorrow's Sunken Diamond baseball
clash. The Cards will run out to their positions

at 3:15 p.m.
This will be Wolf's first starting
assignment since donning a Farm
uniform. He entered school this"fall
and has been working two and.thrcc
inning assignments in the last two
weeks in an effort to return to con
dition. If anything, Larry is faster
than his brother, Phil, who has
borne the brunt of Stanford mound
duties thus far this season.
Qualities Unknown
Although not much is known
about the quality of the Flyers, they
should field a squad capable of giv
ing the Woltermen a contest at
least. According to latest reports.
St. Mary's has been winning most
of its games and is at the peak of
its play this season.

Stanford's thus-far victorious track team meets
its first real test on Angell Field at 1:45 Saturday
afternoon, when the triangular meet with San
Jose State College and Alameda Naval Air Sta
tion gets under way.

On paper it looks good for San
Jose. Last Saturday at Spartan
Howl they very impressively
trounccd all other entrants, in
cluding Alameda N.A.S., in a
four-way meet.
Many of the men on the San
Jose team enrolled in school only
last April 1. The greatest number of
them are veterans and they were
not yet in shape. Considering this,
their times look very good.
From Alameda comes this en
couraging bit of news. Buddy
Young, N.C.A.A. sprint champion
and star football player for Fleet
City, may compete for the Naval
Air Station if he gets back from
leave in time.
As yet, Alameda has no definite
list of the men who will compete in
the meet. Lt. Comdr. Paul Wise,
coach of the N.A.S. team, has to de
pend upon personnel aboard ship
and it is never certain who will bi
available. As mentioned before, if
he returns from leave in time, Bud
dy Young will run for Alameda
Saturday.
Nevertheless, Stanford mentor
Jack Weiershauser sounded opti
mistic when interviewed yesterday
afternoon:
"I'm counting on Captain Mar
tin Anderson to win the 100-yard
dash. On paner it looks like he
should he left behind: hut An
derson, as does the re«t of the
team, runs to win," said Wcicrs
hauscr.
"This team is like the Stanford
terms of the prewar era. The men
are able to double up in events and
still win. 'Shades of Old Stanford'
will be on Angell Field tomorrow
afternoon.
"We're pointing for the 'Big Meet'
with Cal June 1." concluded Coach
Weicrshauser. "Every time we run
in a meet, no matter who the cur
rent opposition is, it will be ps if
we were running against Cal."
As in most meets, the outcome
