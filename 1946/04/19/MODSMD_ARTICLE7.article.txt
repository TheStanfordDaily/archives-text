# Baseballers Vie with St. Mary's Tomorrow; Track Team Will Meet S.J. State, Alameda
## 
### 
In an attempt to capture Stanford's fourth win
in eleven starts, Coach Harry Wolter will pitch
big Larry Wolf against the St. Mary's Pre-Flight
nine in tomorrow's Sunken Diamond baseball
clash. The Cards will run out to their positions

at 3:15 p.m.
This will be Wolf's first starting
assignment since donning a Farm
uniform. He entered school this"fall
and has been working two and.thrcc
inning assignments in the last two
weeks in an effort to return to con
dition. If anything, Larry is faster
than his brother, Phil, who has
borne the brunt of Stanford mound
duties thus far this season.
Qualities Unknown
Although not much is known
about the quality of the Flyers, they
should field a squad capable of giv
ing the Woltermen a contest at
least. According to latest reports.
St. Mary's has been winning most
of its games and is at the peak of
its play this season.

Stanford's thus-far victorious track team meets
its first real test on Angell Field at 1:45 Saturday
afternoon, when the triangular meet with San
Jose State College and Alameda Naval Air Sta
tion gets under way.

On paper it looks good for San
Jose. Last Saturday at Spartan
Howl they very impressively
trounccd all other entrants, in
cluding Alameda N.A.S., in a
four-way meet.
Many of the men on the San
Jose team enrolled in school only
last April 1. The greatest number of
them are veterans and they were
not yet in shape. Considering this,
their times look very good.
From Alameda comes this en
couraging bit of news. Buddy
Young, N.C.A.A. sprint champion
and star football player for Fleet
City, may compete for the Naval
Air Station if he gets back from
leave in time.
As yet, Alameda has no definite
list of the men who will compete in
the meet. Lt. Comdr. Paul Wise,
coach of the N.A.S. team, has to de
pend upon personnel aboard ship
and it is never certain who will bi
available. As mentioned before, if
he returns from leave in time, Bud
dy Young will run for Alameda
Saturday.
Nevertheless, Stanford mentor
Jack Weiershauser sounded opti
mistic when interviewed yesterday
afternoon:
"I'm counting on Captain Mar
tin Anderson to win the 100-yard
dash. On paner it looks like he
should he left behind: hut An
derson, as does the re«t of the
team, runs to win," said Wcicrs
hauscr.
"This team is like the Stanford
terms of the prewar era. The men
are able to double up in events and
still win. 'Shades of Old Stanford'
will be on Angell Field tomorrow
afternoon.
"We're pointing for the 'Big Meet'
with Cal June 1." concluded Coach
Weicrshauser. "Every time we run
in a meet, no matter who the cur
rent opposition is, it will be ps if
we were running against Cal."
As in most meets, the outcome
will largely depend upon four or
five men. If Stanford nabs the vic
tory, it will be due to the work of
men such as Frank Ganahl who
plans to run in both the mile and
the two-mile runs.
'Bill Larson, ace Farm pole
vaulter, will also run in the high
hurdles. Boh Millington, Stan
ford weight man, \\ ill have rough
going in the shot put and discus
against 287-pound Woody Linn of
San Jose.
This being a three-way meet, the
two other teams will work against
each other in many events and that
will be to the advantage of Stan
ford.
George Grimes of Stanford looks
strongest in the 880, as does Frank
Ganahl in the one- and two-mile
runs. Bob Millington should sweep
the shot put for the Cardinal, Ed
Luce the high jump, and Bill Lar
son the pole vault.
On the dark side of the ledger,
the broad jump, dashes, discus, and
both hurdles look like San Jose's
meat.
Alameda has good men in the
javelin and the 440. If Young shows
up, they'll have a good man in the
dashes also.
This should make the scoring
very close between San Jose and
Stanford. Seconds and thirds
will probably swing the meet one
way or the other.

The same cannot be said for the
j locals. The cards started off with a
j batting bang in its first two games,
! making twenty-seven runs against
the opponents' four. After the end
| of winter quarter, the Injuns trekked
[ to Los Angeles to play their first
! four league encounters. They re-

turned with four defeats, two of
[ which were by lopsided margins.
! Th«? other pair were close, extra
inning clashes.
Little "Dispirited"
A little dispirited with their show
ing in the southland, the Stanfords
j slumped, dropping two tolts to S.F.U.
and Santa Clara. Hamilton Field's
1 Yankees, however, saved the Farm
i from too severe a losing streak by
' losing 8 to 7, but Alameda Navy's
' nine smothered hopes of even a two-
I game winning streak by topping the
; locals 8 to 7 last Saturday.
Faced with more crucial league
| encountex-s in the near future, Stan
| ford's baseballers are anxious to
| field a winning combination.
Hopes with Wolf
At the moment, the hopes are rest
ing upon the pitching arms of the
' Wolf Brothers. Larry and Phil, Dick
Flatland, and Lefty Palisoul. Frank
j McGraw, the backbone of the team,
is not only outstanding among the
Stanford crop, but on the West

j Coast. The outfield for tomorrow's
i encounter should consist of George
I Sloat, Deny Fox, and Jim Wicker
sham. They form a hustling trio
and work well together.
If Wolter could be sure of his in
field's steadiness, there would be
less reason for Stanford's rooters to
I fret. The combination of Tom Ward,
Buck Brownson, Bob Peters, and
Lloyd Merriman has shown lack of
quality but will be given another
chance today. Wolter is contemplat
ing moving Larry Prato back into
the line-up, however.

HARRY WOLTERS, Stanford
baseball coach.
In an attempt to capture Stanford's fourth win
in eleven starts, Coach Harry Wolter will pitch
big Larry Wolf against the St. Mary's Pre-Flight
nine in tomorrow's Sunken Diamond baseball
clash. The Cards will run out to their positions

at 3:15 p.m.
This will be Wolf's first starting
assignment since donning a Farm
uniform. He entered school this"fall
and has been working two and.thrcc
inning assignments in the last two
weeks in an effort to return to con
dition. If anything, Larry is faster
than his brother, Phil, who has
borne the brunt of Stanford mound
duties thus far this season.
Qualities Unknown
Although not much is known
about the quality of the Flyers, they
should field a squad capable of giv
ing the Woltermen a contest at
least. According to latest reports.
St. Mary's has been winning most
of its games and is at the peak of
its play this season.

Stanford's thus-far victorious track team meets
its first real test on Angell Field at 1:45 Saturday
afternoon, when the triangular meet with San
Jose State College and Alameda Naval Air Sta
tion gets under way.

On paper it looks good for San
Jose. Last Saturday at Spartan
Howl they very impressively
trounccd all other entrants, in
cluding Alameda N.A.S., in a
four-way meet.
Many of the men on the San
Jose team enrolled in school only
last April 1. The greatest number of
them are veterans and they were
not yet in shape. Considering this,
their times look very good.
From Alameda comes this en
couraging bit of news. Buddy
Young, N.C.A.A. sprint champion
and star football player for Fleet
City, may compete for the Naval
Air Station if he gets back from
leave in time.
As yet, Alameda has no definite
list of the men who will compete in
the meet. Lt. Comdr. Paul Wise,
coach of the N.A.S. team, has to de
pend upon personnel aboard ship
and it is never certain who will bi
available. As mentioned before, if
he returns from leave in time, Bud
dy Young will run for Alameda
Saturday.
Nevertheless, Stanford mentor
Jack Weiershauser sounded opti
mistic when interviewed yesterday
afternoon:
"I'm counting on Captain Mar
tin Anderson to win the 100-yard
dash. On paner it looks like he
should he left behind: hut An
derson, as does the re«t of the
team, runs to win," said Wcicrs
hauscr.
"This team is like the Stanford
terms of the prewar era. The men
are able to double up in events and
still win. 'Shades of Old Stanford'
will be on Angell Field tomorrow
afternoon.
"We're pointing for the 'Big Meet'
with Cal June 1." concluded Coach
Weicrshauser. "Every time we run
in a meet, no matter who the cur
rent opposition is, it will be ps if
we were running against Cal."
As in most meets, the outcome
will largely depend upon four or
five men. If Stanford nabs the vic
tory, it will be due to the work of
men such as Frank Ganahl who
plans to run in both the mile and
the two-mile runs.
'Bill Larson, ace Farm pole
vaulter, will also run in the high
hurdles. Boh Millington, Stan
ford weight man, \\ ill have rough
going in the shot put and discus
against 287-pound Woody Linn of
San Jose.
This being a three-way meet, the
two other teams will work against
each other in many events and that
will be to the advantage of Stan
ford.
George Grimes of Stanford looks
strongest in the 880, as does Frank
Ganahl in the one- and two-mile
runs. Bob Millington should sweep
the shot put for the Cardinal, Ed
Luce the high jump, and Bill Lar
son the pole vault.
On the dark side of the ledger,
the broad jump, dashes, discus, and
both hurdles look like San Jose's
meat.
Alameda has good men in the
javelin and the 440. If Young shows
up, they'll have a good man in the
dashes also.
This should make the scoring
very close between San Jose and
Stanford. Seconds and thirds
will probably swing the meet one
way or the other.

The same cannot be said for the
j locals. The cards started off with a
j batting bang in its first two games,
! making twenty-seven runs against
the opponents' four. After the end
| of winter quarter, the Injuns trekked
[ to Los Angeles to play their first
! four league encounters. They re-

turned with four defeats, two of
[ which were by lopsided margins.
! Th«? other pair were close, extra
inning clashes.
Little "Dispirited"
A little dispirited with their show
ing in the southland, the Stanfords
j slumped, dropping two tolts to S.F.U.
and Santa Clara. Hamilton Field's
1 Yankees, however, saved the Farm
i from too severe a losing streak by
' losing 8 to 7, but Alameda Navy's
' nine smothered hopes of even a two-
I game winning streak by topping the
; locals 8 to 7 last Saturday.
Faced with more crucial league
| encountex-s in the near future, Stan
| ford's baseballers are anxious to
| field a winning combination.
Hopes with Wolf
At the moment, the hopes are rest
ing upon the pitching arms of the
' Wolf Brothers. Larry and Phil, Dick
Flatland, and Lefty Palisoul. Frank
j McGraw, the backbone of the team,
is not only outstanding among the
Stanford crop, but on the West

j Coast. The outfield for tomorrow's
i encounter should consist of George
I Sloat, Deny Fox, and Jim Wicker
sham. They form a hustling trio
and work well together.
If Wolter could be sure of his in
field's steadiness, there would be
less reason for Stanford's rooters to

Buck Brownson, Bob Peters, and

Hopes with Wolf
At the moment, the hopes are rest
ing upon the pitching arms of the
' Wolf Brothers. Larry and Phil, Dick
Flatland, and Lefty Palisoul. Frank
j McGraw, the backbone of the team,
is not only outstanding among the
Stanford crop, but on the West

j Coast. The outfield for tomorrow's
i encounter should consist of George
I Sloat, Deny Fox, and Jim Wicker
sham. They form a hustling trio
and work well together.
If Wolter could be sure of his in
field's steadiness, there would be
less reason for Stanford's rooters to
I fret. The combination of Tom Ward,
Buck Brownson, Bob Peters, and
Lloyd Merriman has shown lack of
quality but will be given another
chance today. Wolter is contemplat
ing moving Larry Prato back into
the line-up, however.


HARRY WOLTERS, Stanford
baseball coach.
In an attempt to capture Stanford's fourth win
in eleven starts, Coach Harry Wolter will pitch
big Larry Wolf against the St. Mary's Pre-Flight
nine in tomorrow's Sunken Diamond baseball
clash. The Cards will run out to their positions

at 3:15 p.m.
This will be Wolf's first starting
assignment since donning a Farm
uniform. He entered school this"fall
and has been working two and.thrcc
inning assignments in the last two
weeks in an effort to return to con
dition. If anything, Larry is faster
than his brother, Phil, who has
borne the brunt of Stanford mound
duties thus far this season.
Qualities Unknown
Although not much is known
about the quality of the Flyers, they
should field a squad capable of giv
ing the Woltermen a contest at
least. According to latest reports.
St. Mary's has been winning most
of its games and is at the peak of
its play this season.

Stanford's thus-far victorious track team meets
its first real test on Angell Field at 1:45 Saturday
afternoon, when the triangular meet with San
Jose State College and Alameda Naval Air Sta
tion gets under way.

On paper it looks good for San
Jose. Last Saturday at Spartan
Howl they very impressively
trounccd all other entrants, in
cluding Alameda N.A.S., in a
four-way meet.
Many of the men on the San
Jose team enrolled in school only
last April 1. The greatest number of
them are veterans and they were
not yet in shape. Considering this,
their times look very good.
From Alameda comes this en
couraging bit of news. Buddy
Young, N.C.A.A. sprint champion
and star football player for Fleet
City, may compete for the Naval
Air Station if he gets back from
leave in time.
As yet, Alameda has no definite
list of the men who will compete in
the meet. Lt. Comdr. Paul Wise,
coach of the N.A.S. team, has to de
pend upon personnel aboard ship
and it is never certain who will bi
available. As mentioned before, if
he returns from leave in time, Bud
dy Young will run for Alameda
Saturday.
Nevertheless, Stanford mentor
Jack Weiershauser sounded opti
mistic when interviewed yesterday
afternoon:
"I'm counting on Captain Mar
tin Anderson to win the 100-yard
dash. On paner it looks like he
should he left behind: hut An
derson, as does the re«t of the
team, runs to win," said Wcicrs
hauscr.
"This team is like the Stanford
terms of the prewar era. The men
are able to double up in events and
still win. 'Shades of Old Stanford'
will be on Angell Field tomorrow
afternoon.
"We're pointing for the 'Big Meet'
with Cal June 1." concluded Coach
Weicrshauser. "Every time we run
in a meet, no matter who the cur
rent opposition is, it will be ps if
we were running against Cal."
As in most meets, the outcome
will largely depend upon four or
five men. If Stanford nabs the vic
tory, it will be due to the work of
men such as Frank Ganahl who
plans to run in both the mile and
the two-mile runs.
'Bill Larson, ace Farm pole
vaulter, will also run in the high
hurdles. Boh Millington, Stan
ford weight man, \\ ill have rough
going in the shot put and discus
against 287-pound Woody Linn of
San Jose.
This being a three-way meet, the
two other teams will work against
each other in many events and that
will be to the advantage of Stan
ford.
George Grimes of Stanford looks
strongest in the 880, as does Frank
Ganahl in the one- and two-mile
runs. Bob Millington should sweep
the shot put for the Cardinal, Ed
Luce the high jump, and Bill Lar
son the pole vault.
On the dark side of the ledger,
the broad jump, dashes, discus, and
both hurdles look like San Jose's
meat.
Alameda has good men in the
javelin and the 440. If Young shows
up, they'll have a good man in the
dashes also.
This should make the scoring
very close between San Jose and
Stanford. Seconds and thirds
will probably swing the meet one
way or the other.

The same cannot be said for the
j locals. The cards started off with a
j batting bang in its first two games,
! making twenty-seven runs against
the opponents' four. After the end
| of winter quarter, the Injuns trekked
[ to Los Angeles to play their first
! four league encounters. They re-

turned with four defeats, two of
[ which were by lopsided margins.
! Th«? other pair were close, extra
inning clashes.
Little "Dispirited"
A little dispirited with their show
ing in the southland, the Stanfords
j slumped, dropping two tolts to S.F.U.
and Santa Clara. Hamilton Field's
1 Yankees, however, saved the Farm
i from too severe a losing streak by
' losing 8 to 7, but Alameda Navy's
' nine smothered hopes of even a two-
I game winning streak by topping the
; locals 8 to 7 last Saturday.
Faced with more crucial league

j slumped, dropping two tolts to S.F.U.
and Santa Clara. Hamilton Field's
1 Yankees, however, saved the Farm
i from too severe a losing streak by
' losing 8 to 7, but Alameda Navy's
' nine smothered hopes of even a two-
I game winning streak by topping the
; locals 8 to 7 last Saturday.
Faced with more crucial league
| encountex-s in the near future, Stan
| ford's baseballers are anxious to
| field a winning combination.
Hopes with Wolf
At the moment, the hopes are rest
ing upon the pitching arms of the
' Wolf Brothers. Larry and Phil, Dick
Flatland, and Lefty Palisoul. Frank
j McGraw, the backbone of the team,
is not only outstanding among the
Stanford crop, but on the West

j Coast. The outfield for tomorrow's
i encounter should consist of George
I Sloat, Deny Fox, and Jim Wicker
sham. They form a hustling trio
and work well together.
If Wolter could be sure of his in
field's steadiness, there would be
less reason for Stanford's rooters to
I fret. The combination of Tom Ward,
Buck Brownson, Bob Peters, and
Lloyd Merriman has shown lack of
quality but will be given another
chance today. Wolter is contemplat
ing moving Larry Prato back into
the line-up, however.
