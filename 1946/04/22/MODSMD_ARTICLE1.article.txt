WASHINGTON, April 21 (UP).—Economic stabilizer Chester
Bowles tonight let loose anct'her blast against those who would
kill price control while there is still danger of "destructive" infla
tion, and predicted defeat for the "out and out profiteers licking
their chops over an anticipated increase in prices."
Following up two torrid attacks Thursday and Saturday of the
House-approved OPA bill, he said in his statement that the coun
try is alarmed over passage of the measure which would "make
impossible the job of holding down the cost of living."
In what obviously was both a call to arms to "everyday citi
zens" and a plea to the Senate to knock out of the House bill a
series of crippling amendments, he said that Congress "has been
under tremendous pressure from a well-financed and powerful
minority of lobbyists" seeking to kill OPA.
But, he said, "a stream of telegrams and letters is coming into
Washington from everyday citizens in all parts of the country
who know that the value of their earnings and their savings and
the whole future of our economy are at stake."
Many congressional leaders, however, are not as confident as
Bowles that the House bill, which practically emasculates OPA,
will be revitalized in the Senate. The Senate Banking Committee
has been holding hearings on price control extension, and farm
stat senators have been predicting more drastic curtailments of
OPA's power than those voted Thursday by the House.
OPA's hold-the-line proposals also are threatened by reports
that log rolling of the bill is in full speed in the Senate, with mem
bers bargaining to take price control off each other's favorite
state product.
