# Easter Crowd Packs Chapel
## 
### 
Stanford celebrated Easter in a
Memorial Church packed to stand
ing room in the galleries. Every
year the traditional holy day brings
people from the campus, Palo Alto,
and the surrounding area to fill
the church to its capacity of 3,000.
The music of the service opened
with two chorales for organ and
trumpets arranged by J. S. Bach,
"The Blessed Christ Is Ris'n To
day" and "Ere Yet the Dawn Hath
Fill'd the Skies."
An organ prelude, "Easter Pre
lude on O Filii, O Filiae," by Ar
thur Egerton, was played by the
University organist, Warren D. Al
len.
The first anthem, "By Early
Morning Light," was sung by the
chancel choir and Marjorie Benson
Dickinson, soprano solo, accompa
nied by Audrey Avis Aasen, vio
linist; Barbara Jeanne Denning,
'cellist; and Varda Mae Griesinger,
ha rpist.
Students Ruth Sutherland and
Robert King read from the Old and
New Testaments, and versicles for
two choirs and for minister and
choir were sung.
Visiting Chaplain Merrimon Cun
inggim chose "Symbol and Sub
stance" for his talk.
The second anthem, "Now Christ
Is Risen," was sung by both choirs,
accompnicd by trumpets and trom
bones under the direction of Ted
Tatgenhorst.
