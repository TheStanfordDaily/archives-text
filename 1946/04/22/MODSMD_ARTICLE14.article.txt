# Housing Problem Remains In Doubt; Contract Made
## 
### 
Stanford's drive to provide hous
ing for married veterans took one
good and one bad turn over the
weekend.
Dr. Donald B. Tresidder, Univer
sity President, signed a contract,
with the Federal Public Housing
Administration for 300 housing
units. Although the FPIiA cannot
promise that it will turn over Dib
ble Hospital wards as they are va
cated, the agency said it would do
"everything possible" to allot the
hospital space to Stanford.
Conversion of seven Dibble units
has already begun and four more
will become available shortly.
However, a visit to the hospi
tal by Gen. Joseph Stilwell, act
ing commanding general of the
Ninth Service Command, lent
credence to the Daily's report of
last Friday that the Army may
intend to convert the hospital
into a general Army hospital and
transfer its patients from Letter
man Hospital in San Francisco to
the Menlo Park operation.
Gen. Stilwell, accompanied by his

chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Frank D.
Merrill, former commander of
"Merrill's Marauders" in the China-
Burma-India theater, made a spe
cial flight to Dibble Saturday to in
spect the wards, grounds, and rec
reational facilities.
After completing his tour, Gen.
Stilwell said Dibble was "one of
the finest shows I've /seen."
Despite the Daily's exclusive
information from an informed
source in San Francisco, the Sur
geon General's olTicc in Washing
ton denied the Army would
transfer its facilities from Let
terman to Dibble and said Let
tcrman would continue its func
tion as a general Army hospital.
Efforts by San Mateo County to
convert Dibble into a mental hos
pital to be operated by the Vetei'ans
Administration have apparently
been quashed. Congressman Jack
Z. Anderson informed Mayor
Charles Burgess of Menlo Park that
the installation was not considered
suitable by the Veterans Admin
istration.
