# Fire Sends Madrono Women From House in Furs, Pajamas
## 
### 
Damage of $.'lOO, three colds from standing in the wet grass, and
much excitement were caused by the living room fire at Madrono last
Saturday morning al 1>:45.
The fire was noticed lÂ»y the resident assistant, Helen Valencourt,
when she smelled the smoke resulting from a cigorette butt dropped in
a couch. Madrono girls dashed out the back door clad principally in
pajamas and fur coats, with the exception of one girl who yelled, "Take
your cloth coats, they're not insured!"
Stanford's fire boys arrived shortly, bashed down the front door, and
thoroughly drenched the room with water and sawdust. The most ob
vious damage after the lire was over was a ruined couch, a scorched
floor, a burned rug, and a broken vase.
Best-dressed woman at the fire was Miss Mary Jane Donaldson,
Union Unit director, who arrived about the time the lire department
did fully dressed, including silk stockings even to the seams being
straight. The bobby pin brigade of girls noticed particularly that even
her hair looked combed. As one Madronoite said, "Awakened out of
sound sleep, almost heats the fire department to the fire, and looks like
that. I think it's wonderful!"
