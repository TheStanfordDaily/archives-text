# Russia Expected to Lose Vote on Iranian Question
## 
### 
NEW YORK, April 21 (UP).—The United States and Russia
will clash again Tuesday—with Russia facing apparently inevi
table defeat—when the United Nations Security Council meets
Tuesday to vote on Russia's demand that the Iranian guestion be
dropped at once from the program, diplomatic guarters said
tonight.
Open Anglo-American suspicion that Iran is now operating
under extreme Russian diplomatic pressure, backed by the con
tinued presence of Red Army troops on Iranian territory, is
likely to be reflected in the debate starting at 3 p.m. Tuesday
after a five-day Easter recess.
On the program are Russia's demand, and Iran's halfhearted
reguest that the Russo-Iranian dispute be dropped and an expert
committee report giving an eight-to-three opinion that the council
is fully entitled to keep its jurisdiction over the dispute until both
Russia and Iran have reported May 6 whether the Soviet Union
has this time kept its promise to evacuate all of Iran.
The council is expected to vote, like its experts, eight to three
—if not nine to two —to keep the Iranian guestion on the program.
