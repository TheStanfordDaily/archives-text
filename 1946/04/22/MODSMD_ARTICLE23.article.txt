"But what can we do about it?"
j he chances are that all of us have been
guilty at some time of placating ourselves
with that choice question when we read
about starvation in European areas, and of a
r.ori of spiritual starvation in nations where
tdacalion and cultural progress have been
temped out by war-caused poverty.
Today, however, we can't go on kidding
our .'.elves that the question is unanswerable
. . . not when organizations such as the World
StuJ .ut Service Fund and Heifers for Relief
exi.~t !:o that we can "do something about it"
whenever we leel like it.
There are students who are tired of giving
lip-service to woiid cooperation and who are
willing to organize a combined drive . . . not
next year, but no w ... to let Stanford con
tribute in as big a way as it wants to these
organizations. They are asking Drives Com
mittee today for permission to go ahead on
the project.
The catch is that Drives Committee has
formulated a policy that there shall be only
one drive to a quarter: War Fund (Commu
nity Chest in peacetime) in the fall. Red Cross
in winter, and Con Home in the spring. Be

lieving that students were overburdened by
a series of small drives and that response
would be larger if contributions were asked
for in one large dose, the committee has stack
by its policy.
We don't think that any policy should nec
essarily last forever. Since last fall when we
gave to the War Fund, we've become a lot
more conscious of why and where our money
is needed. And to Drives Committees we say
that part of the 10 per cent floating fund des
ignated under the War Fund collections for
"any worthwhile cause" is not enough.
It would be a sad thing to see seldom
aroused student enthusiasm squelched in its
first moments by attempts to stave off that en
thusiasm until the next of our "big drives."
It would be a sad thing if all the desperate
people of the world were forced to wait un
til next fall to get their share of our contrib
utions . . . hunger doesn't wait on ceremony.
If Stanford students are to be given the
information, the impetus, and the necessary
channels to support the WSSF and Heifers
for Relief, Drives Committee must dust off its
policy for expediency's sake and approve
plans for a combined drive, now.

mittee today for permission to go ahead on
the project.
The catch is that Drives Committee has
formulated a policy that there shall be only
one drive to a quarter: War Fund (Commu
nity Chest in peacetime) in the fall. Red Cross
in winter, and Con Home in the spring. Be

lieving that students were overburdened by
a series of small drives and that response
would be larger if contributions were asked
for in one large dose, the committee has stack
by its policy.
We don't think that any policy should nec
essarily last forever. Since last fall when we
gave to the War Fund, we've become a lot
more conscious of why and where our money
is needed. And to Drives Committees we say
that part of the 10 per cent floating fund des
ignated under the War Fund collections for
"any worthwhile cause" is not enough.
It would be a sad thing to see seldom
aroused student enthusiasm squelched in its
first moments by attempts to stave off that en
thusiasm until the next of our "big drives."
It would be a sad thing if all the desperate
people of the world were forced to wait un
til next fall to get their share of our contrib
utions . . . hunger doesn't wait on ceremony.
If Stanford students are to be given the
information, the impetus, and the necessary
channels to support the WSSF and Heifers
for Relief, Drives Committee must dust off its
policy for expediency's sake and approve
plans for a combined drive, now.
"But what can we do about it?"
j he chances are that all of us have been
guilty at some time of placating ourselves
with that choice question when we read
about starvation in European areas, and of a
r.ori of spiritual starvation in nations where
tdacalion and cultural progress have been
temped out by war-caused poverty.
Today, however, we can't go on kidding
our .'.elves that the question is unanswerable
. . . not when organizations such as the World
StuJ .ut Service Fund and Heifers for Relief
exi.~t !:o that we can "do something about it"
whenever we leel like it.
There are students who are tired of giving
lip-service to woiid cooperation and who are
willing to organize a combined drive . . . not
next year, but no w ... to let Stanford con
tribute in as big a way as it wants to these
organizations. They are asking Drives Com
mittee today for permission to go ahead on
the project.
