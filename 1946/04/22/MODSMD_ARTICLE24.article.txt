Dear Mr. Shpetner:
it lias been said that the first principle for any
V od reporter is to ascertain the facts. The attack
on Ram's H ad in Friday's Daily violates this first
principle of journalism. If the writer has a basis
1 oi argument, let him present it without falsifying
the situation.
The Daily stated in your column that the Spring
Show is an annual affair for only original scripts.
Thr i.s incorrect as evidenced by the Spring Show
meiudrama of last year which was not student writ-
I mi. However, Ram's Head has always considered
originals first and students knowing the Spring
Show 11» be an annual production have not waited
lor deadline to be announced.
'1 io statement thai Ham's Head delayed pub
licity in order to present a student-written play
already chosen is completely false. No single
student inside (or outside) of Ram's Ilead was
given any special consideration or go-ahead sig
nal. You stated that one week before the end of
last quarter Ram's Head already had an original
show slated for production. One week before
the end of last quarter Ram's Head did not have
a particular original show submitted or in the
oiling being written by a chosen favorite.
When no producible original scripts appear, the

only alternative i.s an already written script.
As to the charge that the winning one-acts
were written by Ram's Head insiders who bad
the information weeks in advance, these are the
facts:
1. More one-acts were submitted this year than
in the last six years.
2. Out of the 35 one-acts submitted only two
were written by members of Ram's Head.
3. The three one-act winners were absolutely
not Ram's Head members—they were not even in
the Speech and Drama Department—hence, not
"Memorial Auditorium moguls."
4. As stated in the contest, honorary member
ship was awarded the winners after the production
of their winning plays.
5. Had the Daily columnist simply checked
with Ram's Head or even his own publication's
past issues concerning the one-acts, the above facts
would have been available to him.
Ram's Head wishes to announce at this time
that original scripts for the lf>47 and I!>48 Spring
Shows will now be welcome. Scripts have been
somewhat slow coming in, and Rain's Head wants
to show no partiality. Mr. Shpetner, are you
there?

of their winning plays.
5. Had the Daily columnist simply checked
with Ram's Head or even his own publication's
past issues concerning the one-acts, the above facts
would have been available to him.
Ram's Head wishes to announce at this time
that original scripts for the lf>47 and I!>48 Spring
Shows will now be welcome. Scripts have been
somewhat slow coming in, and Rain's Head wants
to show no partiality. Mr. Shpetner, are you
there?

Janice Swan, Director of Spring Show
Dear Mr. Shpetner:
it lias been said that the first principle for any
V od reporter is to ascertain the facts. The attack
on Ram's H ad in Friday's Daily violates this first
principle of journalism. If the writer has a basis
1 oi argument, let him present it without falsifying
the situation.
The Daily stated in your column that the Spring
Show is an annual affair for only original scripts.
Thr i.s incorrect as evidenced by the Spring Show
meiudrama of last year which was not student writ-
I mi. However, Ram's Head has always considered
originals first and students knowing the Spring
Show 11» be an annual production have not waited
lor deadline to be announced.
'1 io statement thai Ham's Head delayed pub
licity in order to present a student-written play
already chosen is completely false. No single
student inside (or outside) of Ram's Ilead was
given any special consideration or go-ahead sig
nal. You stated that one week before the end of
last quarter Ram's Head already had an original
show slated for production. One week before
the end of last quarter Ram's Head did not have
a particular original show submitted or in the
oiling being written by a chosen favorite.
When no producible original scripts appear, the

only alternative i.s an already written script.
As to the charge that the winning one-acts
were written by Ram's Head insiders who bad
the information weeks in advance, these are the
facts:
1. More one-acts were submitted this year than
in the last six years.
2. Out of the 35 one-acts submitted only two
were written by members of Ram's Head.
3. The three one-act winners were absolutely
not Ram's Head members—they were not even in
the Speech and Drama Department—hence, not
"Memorial Auditorium moguls."
4. As stated in the contest, honorary member
ship was awarded the winners after the production
of their winning plays.
