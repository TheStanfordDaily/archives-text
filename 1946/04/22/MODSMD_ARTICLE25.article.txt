The Madrono girls had a fireside early Satur
i' Â»> morning. Apparently all the girls were sit
ting around an old burning chaise longnc roasting
marshmallows at 4 a.m. when they felt the need
of a little fresh air.
They called the fire department, which rushed
over with every available man and piece of equip
ment and immediately brought the fire and all the
girls out onto the front lawn.
There weren't enouah firemen to go around, so
the girls let out several blood-curdling screams in
the direction of the Rutherford B. Hayes sleeping
porch, and 15 fearless Stanford roughs rushed over
to the by-this-time melee.
While the smoke-eaters chopped away at the
settee, the girls ran up and down the stairs
( hitching their mink coats (this is Stanford) and
mother-of-pearl vanity cases. One young lady
! t mding on the front porch was suddenly struck
b; a horrible thought and ran headlong into the
smoking building. Several endless minutes later
she emerged, breathless and footsore, but hold
ing under each arm her precious law books.
AH in all a stimulating time was had, but those
Madrono girls won't be so happy when they find

out they all lose a floating late leave for the occa
sion.

It may not be noticeable from where you are
sitting, but Stanford is resurging, athletically
"speaking.
Over the weekend we resurged appreciably.
As the picture stands now, the Indian golf team
is approx No. 1 in the country, the swimming
team is approx No. 2 in the country, in Arnie
Beisser Stanford has one of the best collegiate
teninis players extant, and the much-belittled
track team is among the ten best in the land.
The fact that the cinder men were defeated by
San Jose State Saturday means little, because the
Spartans -could do the same to any college team
in the country other than U.S.C. or Illinois.

Loe and J. J. Schubert must be pushed at Ram's
Head for not awarding them honorary member
ships.
After the dramatic group went to the trouble
of sifting their talent lor a suitable cast for "Dark
of the Moon," the brothers Schubert refused to let
them produce the play and suggested instead "The
Wind Is Night."
Don't let them do that to you, Ram's Ilead!
For spite we advocate that you don't put on any
Spring Show at all for !>(> years and then you
can do "Dark of the Moon" on the public domain.
