Before we go any farther we would like to clear
up a matter that, so far as this column is concerned,
is rather important.
Our writing is sometimes referred to as a "gripe
.session." We have heard, "Doesn't that joker ever
have anything good to say for anything?"
Well, it is like this.
How long do vou think man has been living
on the earth? Shall we just settle for "a very
long time"? It is often said, with some surprise,
that man's political and social advances are run
ning a very poor second to his scientific progress.
Everyone seems to take this as a new discovery
in reason.
If you can teach but a few something about
chain reactions ct al., they surprise you one day
with the most amazing of discoveries. But when
you have to teach all men th? theory and working
< 112 democracy it takes a long time, for every man
does not have the ability to reason and learn as
does Mr. Oppenheimer.
At Stanford you are taught French and eeon
and history, but little success is reached in the field
of political awareness and social consciousness. On
the contrary, we seem to be making great advances
toward political apathy.
Do you think that in five years you will re
member whethc"' the A.S.S.U. election assembly
was held in the daytime or even if it was held at

all? The assembly in itself is unimportant.
But we feel that just as simple two plus two
is taught, so a political interest can be taught.
ll' an individual's interest in the small community
can he arotfsed, it is the interest that is on the
move, not the action taken on the assembly or
Ram's Head or what have you. That is what we
are trying to do.
We have a groat and sincere faith in that oft
snickered-at group, "the common man." Of course
none of us at Stanford are "common men" (except
the Union hashers). But we've got a long way
to go before we can politically match the science
of the atom. And we'll get there only when, by a
constant and concentrated effort to find out what
is going on around us, we begin to feel that we are
a vital part of the world community.
We are seeking to reach this goal in our own
small community by mustering whatever intelli
gence we have and slam-banging day after clay
through this column.
In the big picture this is bill a small effort.
But a big effort is made up of many such small
efforts.
We honestly believe that the "common man"
can force political thinking to advance to the
degree that science has already reached.
And by slamming, pounding, pushing, and
sweating he'll get there.
