## 
### 
(Special to the Stanford Daily)
Heavy legal artillery will swing
into action tonight when the Su
preme Court of the State of Stan
ford reconvenes to hear "The Case
of the Insulting Phonograph Rec
ord."
A legal battle promising to ex
ceed last quarter's "Case of the
Murdered Dummy" will open the
spring session of the Supreme
Court. Four attorneys will fight a
lower body decision on the libel
and slander case before three
judges.
Record Causes Trial
Local lawyers were surveyed to
reveal that the trial centers around
a phonograph record sent by
Crouch to Holbrock. The identity
of these men is not further revealed
by the attorneys. The record was
to the effect that "Holbrock is a
skunk."
Unaware of the contents, Hol
brock played the record at a party
and then sued for damages under
libel and slander laws.
Hearings Scheduled
Crouch was awarded the verdict

| by the lower court, after the judge
told the jury that it was a matter
j of law to award him the decision.
Holbrock, through his attorneys,
A 1 Hart and Jack Walsh, appealed,
I holding that there was publication
; of the defamation. Crouch will be
i represented by Lee Kirk and Wil
liam Mitchell.
Hearings are scheduled to open at
7:30 p.m. before Judges Lowell
Turrentine, acting dean of the Law
School, Beverly Ottem, and Norman
Baldwin. Room 100 will serve as
| court room, due to the housing
j shortage.
i Resumption of Court
Are you wondering what's going
I on by now? It's really simple.
' Says our legal reporter:
"Whereas and in so far as the
Law School made it a practice in
j the years .prior to the war to hold
j moot courts, in order that its stu
dents might be provided with prac
tical training under circumstances
| closely resembling de facto condi
tions;
"And whereas the termination of

the war has made it both possible
and desirable to resume this prac
tice ;
"It is therefore being resumed."
In other words, the idea behind
moot courts is the same as in spring
football practice, or the combat
courses in basic training.
First in Series
The public is invited to see the
legal mind at work.
Tonight's trial is the first of a
series of five. The others will be
held Wednesday, Friday, and next
Monday. Eighteen attorneys — all
second-year law students — will be
involved. They will be rated indi
vidually on preparation and deliv
ery.
Those rated highest will advance
to ihe semi-finals set for next fall.
