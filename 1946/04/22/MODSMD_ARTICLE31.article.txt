# 'Trunk' Rates as Swishy, Shoot-Em-Up Scenario
## 
### 
SARATO G A TRI! N K—Today
through Saturday at the Stanford
Theater
"Saratoga Trunk" has more polish
than a graduate of an eastern finish
ing school, even though Ingrid Berg
man and Gary Cooper are just u
couple of inarticulate westerners
without the benefit of a liberal edu
cation.
Adapted from Edna Ferber's pe
riod novel of New Orleans and up
stale New York, "Saratoga Trunk"
is packed with swishy costumes,
flashy people, and shoot -'cin-up ac
tion.
Laconic Cooper
fngrid Bergman, registering solid
ly in her first, coquettish role, is
memorable as the tempestuous and
headstrong Cleo, last of an aristo
cratic New Orleans Creole family.
Miss Bergman runs the .scale of

emotions with assurance, brandish
ing a champagne glass or a frilly
handkerchief with equal ease.
Her laconic lover, Gary Cooper, as
Colonel White Hat Maroon, is just
ibout the biggest drink of water
that we've seen. White Hat is a de
termined gambler and cattleman
from Texas and doesn't belong to
the present school of comboys who
lide around in the company of a
guitar and a 50-piece orchestra.
Lusty Action
The film's story is a potpourri of
romance (both of the legitimate atjd
the back-room variety), lusty ac
tion and heavy melodrama. The
whole show is just a little fabulous,
but perhaps people did move about
GO years ago with a flair for the
melodramatic. In any event, the
settings and costumes put a dent in
the brothers Warner's collective
pocketbooks.
Most of the festivities lake place
at Saratoga Springs, a New York
mineral waters resort full of tired
businessmen and their overstuffed
and not too tired wives. When
White Hat and Cleo intrude upon
this carriage set, the champagne
flows like Mission Bell.
There's no moralizing in "Sara
toga Trunk," just a lot of robust
entertainment. It's one of those few
pictures that leaves you with a
thousand memories and not a single
regret.
