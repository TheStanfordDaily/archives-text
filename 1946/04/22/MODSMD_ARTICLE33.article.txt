## San Jose State Thinclads Squash Indians, Alameda 
### 
Lacking the necessary punch in
the hurdles and sprints. Stanford's
track team bowed to San Jose State
College on Angell Field Saturday
afternoon—79 5-6 to 56 1-6. Ala
meda Naval Air Station finished
third in the three-way meet with 26
points.
Stanford's predominantly fresh
man team tried hard for an upset,
but Kill Ryne and his San Jose
teammates proved to be too much
for (lie locals. Ryne was easily
the outstanding entrant for the
opponents, gathering 11 points in
dividually.
By winning Saturday, San Jose i
proved itself to be one of the sharp- j
est track teams on the Pacific Coast
and that includes P.C.C. competi- [
tion.
Even though it went down in de
feat, Stanford's team showed slight I
improvement over the Saturday be- !
fore when they were victorious over j
weaker opponents. George Grimes J
ran the 440 in 50.5 to cut a second oil |
his previous mark for that distance.
Ed Luce crossed the bar at 6 feet 2 j
inches, which is still short of his best |
mark but two inches better than last !
Saturday. The Stanford mile relay j
team covered the four laps in 3:32.1 j
without being pressed at all. Better
time will come with more competi- !
tion.
Stanford's distance man Frank
Ganahl started ofT the meet with a
victory in the mile run. Pert of
the Air Station was 100 yards he- j
hind Ganahl when the mile and
two-mile ace crossed the tape.
Carl Schroeder of Stanford was
third. Ganahl's winning time was
4:34.1.
Results of the 440-yard run and j
the shot-put put Stanford into an j
early meet lead of 19 points as |
against 17 lor San Jose and 8 for j
Alameda. Bob Milington was the j
winner for Stanford in the shot-put I
with a heave of 46 feet 1 1 L» inches.
Holt Birmingham and Kenny
Knowles of San Jose finished one, |
two in the high hurdles to give the
State College the lead in points I
which they never relinquished. i
The sprints were all San Jose. !
Captain Martin Anderson, who won j
a fourth in the 100-yard dash, was J
the only Stanford man to place in j
either one of these events.
Stanford man George Grimes,
winner of the 440, tried to repeat
his performance in the 880 but was
unsuccessful. Grimes has run much
better races than Knowles of San j
Jose did in winning with the time \
of 2:02, but suffered from a wa- {
ter-cramp and was barely able to j
finish.
The discus, broad jump, and
javelin throw were almost swept
by San Jose and the Naval Air ,
Station. The only exception was
DeSvvarte of Stanford who placed

feet 4 inches.

proved itself to be one of the sharp- j
est track teams on the Pacific Coast
and that includes P.C.C. competi- [
tion.

feat, Stanford's team showed slight I
improvement over the Saturday be- !
fore when they were victorious over j
weaker opponents. George Grimes J
ran the 440 in 50.5 to cut a second oil |
his previous mark for that distance.
Ed Luce crossed the bar at 6 feet 2 j
inches, which is still short of his best |
mark but two inches better than last !

a fourth in the 100-yard dash, was J
the only Stanford man to place in j
either one of these events.

dividually.
By winning Saturday, San Jose i
proved itself to be one of the sharp- j
est track teams on the Pacific Coast
and that includes P.C.C. competi- [
tion.
Even though it went down in de
feat, Stanford's team showed slight I
improvement over the Saturday be- !
fore when they were victorious over j
weaker opponents. George Grimes J

his previous mark for that distance.
Ed Luce crossed the bar at 6 feet 2 j
inches, which is still short of his best |
mark but two inches better than last !

two in the high hurdles to give the
State College the lead in points I
which they never relinquished. i

a fourth in the 100-yard dash, was J
the only Stanford man to place in j
either one of these events.
Stanford man George Grimes,
winner of the 440, tried to repeat
his performance in the 880 but was
unsuccessful. Grimes has run much
better races than Knowles of San j
