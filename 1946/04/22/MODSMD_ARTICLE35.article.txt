# Cardinal Courtmen Divide Weekend Matches with Bruin, Tiger Netters
## 
### 
Falling before the powerful U.C.L.A. Bruins, 6-3, in Friday's confer
ence inaugural, the Stanford varsity tennis squad came back on Satur
day to earn an even split for the weekend by trouncing College of Pa
cific, 7-2.
Arnold Beisser s phenomenal service and all-around play carried

him (o a 7-5, (i-2 Stanford win
j over Chet Covey of CO.P. in
number one singles. Cardinal
hopes for a successful season arc
closely linked to the brilliant work
of Beisser.
Friday's Conference opener was
j "all Bruin" but the Stanford entry
gave the U.C.L.A. wonders a num
! ber of uneasy moments. 'The 6-3
j score compares favorably with the
i Berkeley Bear's more disastrous
j 8-1 loss to the Bruins on Saturday,
i Arnie Beisser furnished Car
! dinal fans with a thrill by easily
i subduing the highly touted Noel
Browne of L'CLA in the feature
j match of the day. The ease with
J which the Stanford sensation won
the match amazed even the more
! avid Card fans.
Second Stanford win was chalked
i up by number two man Bob Rut
i ledge who defeated UCLAN Bill
Beale in three tight sets, 1-6, 9-7.
6-4. Not until the second doubles
match did the Farm hands again
dent the winner's circle. Beisser
and Hughes team up to record a
rapid 6-4, 6-3 victory,
Once more the Cardinals showed
j a decided weakness in the lower
! brackets, as the men from COP an
nexed their lone pair of victories in
: fifth and sixth positions. A gruelling
' first set finally went to Spartan
} Noel Prence and he went on to de
i feat Gordon Miller, 10-8, 6-2 in fifth
; seeding. Bob Keenan of Stanford
fell before Gordon Daloek, 6-1, 6-2
I for the only other COP win.
1 The remainder of the Indian sin
gles participants experienced a bit
! of difficulty at the outset, but
warmed to the task and swept
, through their last two sets for vic-
I tory. Bob Rutledge dropped the
first set. 4-6, to Bob Tout of COP,
! but the pint-sized Cardinal ral
i lied to cop the final pair. 6-3, 6-4.
In the third slot, Dave Basham
I also lost a 7-9 first set, only to hit his
i stride for 6-3, 6-2, and another Stan
ford win. Ditto Roy Hughes, fourth
I ranking Card, who came back from
a 1-6 deficit to defeat Don Swift by
1-6. 7-5, 6-4.
Doubles play resulted in Indian
complete supremacy with three
consecutive triumphs. Basham
and Rutledge brushed aside
Browne and Covey in number one
seeding, 6-3, 6-2. The Bessier-
Ilughes combo continued the Car
dinal rout by whipping Tout and
SwiJt, 6-3, 7-5. And the seventh
j Stanford win went on the boards
' as Frost and Schroeder posted a
i 6-3, 6-3 score over Prence and
Mundt.—Bullock

1 The remainder of the Indian sin

warmed to the task and swept
, through their last two sets for vic-

first set. 4-6, to Bob Tout of COP,

In the third slot, Dave Basham
I also lost a 7-9 first set, only to hit his
i stride for 6-3, 6-2, and another Stan
ford win. Ditto Roy Hughes, fourth
I ranking Card, who came back from
a 1-6 deficit to defeat Don Swift by
1-6. 7-5, 6-4.
Doubles play resulted in Indian
complete supremacy with three
consecutive triumphs. Basham
and Rutledge brushed aside
Browne and Covey in number one
seeding, 6-3, 6-2. The Bessier-

of Beisser.
Friday's Conference opener was
