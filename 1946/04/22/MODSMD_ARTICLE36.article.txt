### ART LEVINSON 
The drubbing Stanford swimmers
gave UCLA and USC last weekend
turned the hearts of the sports staff
members into a most happy and
contented mood. The Daily Trojan,
which has been lambasting the
Farm's athletic endeavors this sea
son, will have to do a complete
about-face now. No longer can the
invincible Tommy Trojan roam
around, claiming all schools as their
victims.
UCLA, the usual weak-sister of
the league, has been tossing Stan
ford around pretty much at their
own will this year, and although
a swimming victory cannot he
chalked up in the same annals as
a pigskin, or basketball triumph,
it will serve notice that athletics
are not 011 the downgrade here,
and that pretty soon, all sports
will be knocking at the door for
all honors.

and the Olympic Club meet the
Stanford cinderpath artists. Let's
hope the turnout of Cardinal root
ers is a little better.
THE APPLECART WAS UP
SET DEPARTMENT: Noel Brown,
a high-ranking tennis ace at
UCLA, was trounced by Arnie
Beisser, in their matches last Fri
day. Swinging over a powerful
serve, plus dishing up some pretty
accurate place shots, Beisser
downed Brown, who hails from
Point Loma High School, Point
Loma, California.
The drubbing Stanford swimmers
gave UCLA and USC last weekend
turned the hearts of the sports staff
members into a most happy and
contented mood. The Daily Trojan,
which has been lambasting the
Farm's athletic endeavors this sea
son, will have to do a complete
about-face now. No longer can the
invincible Tommy Trojan roam
around, claiming all schools as their
victims.
UCLA, the usual weak-sister of
the league, has been tossing Stan
ford around pretty much at their
own will this year, and although
a swimming victory cannot he
chalked up in the same annals as
a pigskin, or basketball triumph,
it will serve notice that athletics
are not 011 the downgrade here,
and that pretty soon, all sports
will be knocking at the door for
all honors.

RUMORS YOU CAN THROW
OUT THE WINDOW DEPART
MENT: Tommy Fromm, ace foot
ball player in prep circles in San
Francisco last season, will not take
his collegiate training at Stanford,
as a number of S.F. scribes had re
ported. Scholastic difficulties is the
answer.
THE DON'T HE SURPRISED.
BUT DON'T HOLD YOUR
HOPES TOO HIGH DEPART
inent: Connie Wannerdam. only
pole vaulter to ever climb over 15
feet, may be Jack Weiershauser's
assistant in track next season.
Note the words, "may be." Noth
ing definite yet.
THE REASON FOR DEEP CHA
GRIN AMONG STANFORD STU
DENTS DEPARTMENT: Turnout
at the track meet Saturday division.
San Jose State College had more
rooters at the meet at Angell Field
than did the home team. Stanford,
or at least they were more vocifer
ous in cheering their men on.
This Saturday a group of J.C.'s
