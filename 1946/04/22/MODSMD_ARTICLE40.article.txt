## Stanford Horsehiders Smash Flyers To Register One-Sided 12-6 Victory 
### 
There was thunder and damage
enough to have been caused by
lightning on the Sunken Diamond
Saturday afternoon. After the St.
Mary's Pre-Flight baseball team
climbed out of its dugout to trod
its weary way home, the score stood
12 to 6 in favor of Stanford's hard
hitting and hustling nine.
Although Stanford's pitching
was good enough, it was the
booming bats that accounted for
the overwhelming victory over a
fairly classy opponent. A home
run by Dick Flatland. a triple by
) Lloyd Merriman and doubles by
Jim Wickersham and Dick Ahl
quist sparked Stanford's twelve
hit attack on the Flyers.
The big innings for the locals were
the sixth and eighth in which they
respectively scored four and five
runs. And in only three innings
were the Cards unable to tally at all.
Because of this batting splurge,
Stanford's pitchers, Larry Wolf
and Dick Flatland had a fairly
easy time on the pitching mound.
VVolf started the game and pitched
creditably for six innings. During
this period he was hit for only
two earned runs. Two others that
scored in the sixth were charged
to the fielding miscues of Stan
ford's infield which is showing
steady improvement.
Flatland finished the game nicely,
allowing only one earned run and
two hits. Dick aided his cause with
a towering home run to deep left
center. The ball traveled over three
hundred and fifty feet and would
have been over the fence in most
Coast League ball parks.
As observers noted, the Moragans
might have fielded a better football
team than a baseball team, for two
of St. Mary's big guns were Titch
enal and Krywicki, well known
gridders last fall.
Stanford's scoring started in the
second inning when Frank Mc-
Graw laced a single to center field,
Dick Ahlquist sacrificed him to
second with a well-placed bunt,
and Jim Witversham pounded a
two-bagger into left.
The Cards came back in the third
with another run on Ward's single,
Sloat's base on balls and Bob Pe
ters' single to left.
Keeping up the bat barrage, the
locals tallied another in the fifth on
bingles by Wickersham and Wolf,
spaced by Brownson's sacrifice.
Then came the big inning. The
Flyers put themselves right back in
the ball game with a 3-run blast,
but the Woltermen made four in
their half to more than make up the
deficit.

The Flyers added two more in
the seventh, but in the eighth,
the locals really poured it on, bat
ting entirely around the lineup to
score the quintet of runs that made
the hall game a rout.
Nicest play of the afternoon was
Buck Brownson's stabbinp catch of
a line drive in the fourth inning.
Toughest luck of the day was Frank
McGraw's. He laid the wood on a
center field only to have it caught
by Satterthwaite. The Flyer must
have heard of Frank's hitting power
because he was playing exception
ally deep.
