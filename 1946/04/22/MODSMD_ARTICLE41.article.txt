# 'Arms and the Man' Producer to Plan, Direct Entire Theatrical Performance
## 
### 
Howard Campbell's production of
"Arms and the Man," the spring
quarter presentation of the Stan
ford Players, marks the beginning
of a new type of course offered to
graduate students in drama at
Stanford.
Mr. Campbell, a graduate student
and candidate for the degree of
Master of Arts, has planned and su
pervised the entire production. This
marks the first time that one stu
dent has been in charge of a pro
duction.

Work of Graduate
Mr. Campbell's work has been ap
proved by the regular Stanford
Players' staff, but from analysis of
the play through planning budget
estimates, choosing and directing
the cast, planning scene, costume
design and lighting, the production
has been the work of a graduate
student. The facilities of the the
ater and the staff have been at Mr.
Campbell's disposal, and he has
functioned as a staff member, thus
gaining experience which usually is
not available until after graduation.
Producer
Mr. Campbell was graduated from
North Texas State Teachers College
in 1942, and came to Stanford in
1945 after having served for the past
three years as a naval aviation
communication officer.
Stage sets for "Arms and the
Man" have been designed by Mr.
Campbell around a basic unit set
against a blue cyclorama back
ground. The unit set can be varied
to show the bedroom, the garden,
and the library in which the three
acts of the comedy will be played.
The sets have been executed by
Wendell Cole, technical director,
and Lawrence Wismer, technical
assistant.
April Opening
Costumes were also designed by

| Mr. Campbell, and he has arranged
to obtain the colorful military uni
forms of the men from Goldstein's.
"Arms and the Man" will open
Wednesday, April 24, in the Little
Theater of the Memorial Audito
rium. Tickets are still available for
a few performances in room 202 of
the Memorial Auditorium for 90
cents. The play will run April 24,
25, 26, 27, 29, and 30.
