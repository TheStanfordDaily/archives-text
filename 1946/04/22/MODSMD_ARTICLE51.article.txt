### 
BRIGHTON, April 21 (UP).—',
Harold Laski, chairman of the Brit
ish Labor Party's executive com
mittee, said today that the United j
States now has an improved atom
bomb capable of devastating an
area as large as the state of Indiana
and Illinois.
Addressing a cooperative party j
conference, Laski attacked U.S. con- !
trol of atomic bombs as "an in- j
iquity."
"I have recently been in the Unit- j
ed States and I have talked to every I
physicist concerned with the manu- ;
facture of the atomic bomb," he said, j
"They now have a bomb one of i

I which alone would devastate the
j two great states of Indiana and Illi
! nois. They have a bomb five of
which would destroy the whole of
the United States south of the Ma
j son-Dixon line.
"It is an iniquity that three men
in a room in the White House should
j be in a position to determine the
j fate of mankind.
"I say the policy of secrecy is an
onslaught on the well-being of the
human race. The whole power of
j your movement should be mobilized
! to end this evil practice of secrecy
j which threatens to poison every
| channel of our international rela
i tions.
