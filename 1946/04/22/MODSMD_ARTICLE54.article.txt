## 
### RUTH DIMICK 
Tops in off-record tradition at
Stanford are the Saturday noon sor
ties to Allied Arts for lunch, or for
engagement teas, or tours of the
gardens to show oft' California,
j Chamber of Commerce version.
It is managed aimosi entirely
' by volunteer help, and all profits
} are turned over to the Stanford
| Convalescent Home.
At present an average of tflO
| people arc served each day. ac
| cording to Mrs. Abbie Fond, who
j is in charge of the tea room. The
I profit is sufficient to provide for
! the complete care of 34 children
each month, she declared.
Food is not the only feature of
J the tea room, however. The sur
! rounding gardens are visited by
J many Eastern tourists who plan to
i include it in their tour of the San
j Francisco area. Adding greatly to
I the interest of the spot are the
i weaving and pottery on display,
i Each individual piece is made by a
| worker right in the room and sold
j to the guests.
Because of the great demand,
luncheon and tea are served only
on advance reservations. How
ever, any visitor who would care
to look around is welcome, Mrs.
Fond said. The Guild is open
every day except Sunday from
12 to 2 and from 3 to 5.
The idea of opening a tea room
| was first thought of by a group of
| Palo Alto gil ls who persuaded their

parents to let them use their prop
erty for the purpose of building
such a place.
Staniord students soon answered
the plea for volunteer help and
they virtually took over the respon
sibility of serving and preparing the
tea.
The spot soon became so popular
that the founders, who were mem
bers of the Allied Aits Guild, de
cided to expand and serve luncheon
as well as tea. Now paid help is
hired to handle serving the tea, and
volunteers are called only to help
with the daily lunches.
Many Stanford women are among
the best and most faithful volun
teer workers. Outstanding are Mrs.
Bill Edwin, Mrs. Anne Scheidecker,
Mrs. Dayton Phillips, Mrs. Hadley
Kirkman, and Mrs. Marchmont
Schwartz.
"Throughout the years, Stan
ford students have been more
than co-operative in donating
their time each Saturday to help
serve lunch," Mrs, Fond said.
' But help is needed * more than
ever this spring quarter, and any
girls who feel that they can give

three hours kome Saturday after
noon to help serve will he very
welcome."
Any girl interested in helping
may sign up with the Allied Arts
representative in her living group
for any Saturday she desires.
