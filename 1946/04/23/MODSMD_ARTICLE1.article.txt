## Marshall Asks For Retraction By Communists 
### 
CHUNGKING. April 22 (UP).—
Gen. George C. Marshall turned
from mediation of China's civil strife
today to request a retraction of
Communist charges that U.S. planes
strafed Chinese Communist posi
tions near Szekingpai last week.
In a memorandum to Communist
Gen. Chou En-Lai, Marshall pointed
out that United States Army, Navy
and Marine headquarters, after
thorough investigations, reported
that no American planes had been
near the Szepingkai area and that
none was missing. He asked Chou
to publish a retraction.
Ask Communist Investigation
Earlier in the day, during a con
ference on the Manchuvian situa
tion, Marshall asked Chou to inves
tigate the Communist charges and
said U.S. headquarters was doing
the same.
"I've had no official report. I only
know what has been in the newspa
pers," Chou replied at the confer
ence, adding that he would contact
Communist headquarters at Yenan
for details.
Marine Flights Denied
A Yenan dispatch published yes
terday in the Chungking Commu
nist daily charged that American
planes strafed the western suburbs
of Szepingkai April 17 and 19 and
that a "small plane bearing an
American white star" was shot down
on the 19th. The body of an Ameri
can soldier was "found in the plane,
the dispatch said.
An officer of the Third Amphib
ious Corps headquarters at Tientsin
told a United Press correspondent
that no Marine flights had been
made over the fighting zone, but
suggested that several planes had
been turned over to the Chinese
government and it was posssiblc
one of these could have been used
before the American insignia was
removed.
"Reconsidering" Stand
Marshall conferred with Chou and
government leaders through the
morning and announced he would
meet tonight with Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek. During an after
noon meeting Minister of War Yu
Ta-Wei promised Marshall "utmost
cooperation" on the part of the gov
ernment in ending hostilities in
Manchuria.
The World Daily News, rightist
newspaper close to Kuomintang
(government party) leaders, said the
government is "reconsidering" its
stand as a result of the Communist
capture of Changchun.
All-Out Attacks Foreseen
"The Kuomintang will not try to
recapture Changchun or attempt to
take over Harbin, because it is un
der Communist influence," the
newspaper said. "Communist cap
ture of Changchun made the Man
churian situation more complicated
and serious, but it is believed that,
through Gen. Marshall, a peaceful
settlement will be reached."
However, the newspaper predict
ed that both government and Com
munist armies would stage all-out
attacks during the next few days in
an effort to gain as much ground as
possible before cease-fire orders arc
issued.
Unconditional Cease-Fire
Gen. Marshall heard the full list
of Communist demands during his
conference with Gen. Chou. He
took notes but withheld commcnt
while Chou talked.
Chou's demands were not dis
closed but it was understood he
asked for unconditional cease-fire
and immediate negotiation of Man
churian political problems during
the truce.
Communists also want to retain
provincial people's governments in
Manchuria, with free elections.

stand as a result of the Communist
capture of Changchun.
All-Out Attacks Foreseen
"The Kuomintang will not try to
recapture Changchun or attempt to
take over Harbin, because it is un

and serious, but it is believed that,
through Gen. Marshall, a peaceful
settlement will be reached."
However, the newspaper predict
ed that both government and Com
munist armies would stage all-out
attacks during the next few days in
an effort to gain as much ground as
possible before cease-fire orders arc
issued.
Unconditional Cease-Fire
Gen. Marshall heard the full list
of Communist demands during his
conference with Gen. Chou. He
took notes but withheld commcnt

Chou's demands were not dis
closed but it was understood he
asked for unconditional cease-fire
and immediate negotiation of Man
churian political problems during
the truce.
Communists also want to retain
provincial people's governments in
Manchuria, with free elections.

Gen. George C. Marshall turned
from mediation of China's civil strife
today to request a retraction of
Communist charges that U.S. planes
strafed Chinese Communist posi

out that United States Army, Navy
and Marine headquarters, after
thorough investigations, reported
that no American planes had been
near the Szepingkai area and that
none was missing. He asked Chou
to publish a retraction.

ference on the Manchuvian situa
tion, Marshall asked Chou to inves
tigate the Communist charges and
said U.S. headquarters was doing
the same.
"I've had no official report. I only
know what has been in the newspa
pers," Chou replied at the confer
ence, adding that he would contact
Communist headquarters at Yenan
for details.
Marine Flights Denied
A Yenan dispatch published yes
terday in the Chungking Commu
nist daily charged that American
planes strafed the western suburbs
of Szepingkai April 17 and 19 and
that a "small plane bearing an
American white star" was shot down
on the 19th. The body of an Ameri
can soldier was "found in the plane,
the dispatch said.
An officer of the Third Amphib
ious Corps headquarters at Tientsin
told a United Press correspondent
that no Marine flights had been
made over the fighting zone, but
suggested that several planes had
been turned over to the Chinese
government and it was posssiblc
one of these could have been used
before the American insignia was
removed.
"Reconsidering" Stand
Marshall conferred with Chou and
government leaders through the
morning and announced he would
meet tonight with Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek. During an after
noon meeting Minister of War Yu
Ta-Wei promised Marshall "utmost
cooperation" on the part of the gov
