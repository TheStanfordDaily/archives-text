# Action Begins Today On 'Heifers' Drive
## 
### 
A Stanford response to the
world famine emergency abroad
will be heard today at 5 p.m. in
the Excom room when Drives
Committee considers the student
request for a drive supporting
"Heifers for Relief," a nationwide
movement by civic ami church
groups to collect money to buy
cattle for shipment to stricken
European areas.
Members of the Stanford "Heif
ers" committee, some of whom
aye planning to accompany the
cattle ships this summer and help
in distributing the heifers, pre
sented their case to Excom last
week.
They were informed, however,
of the policy formulated in recent
years by Drives Committee which,
according to A.S.S.U. Vice-Presi
dent Charmian Kolar, consoli
dated all small campus drives
into three—the War Fund, Red
Cross, and Convalescent Home
drives —to insure the maximum
success of each. A floating fund,
for emergency causes, is included
in the War Fund collection.
"The present policy has been
successful," Miss Kolar said last
night. "Though I feel there
should be some channel for con
tributions to 'Heifers for Relief.'
collections in living units would
mean another drive and would
hurt the regular campus collec
tions."
A.S.S.U. President Hob Ken
nedy also agreed there should be
some way to solicit funds for
"Heifers"; and Merle Bcuttcl,
chairman of Drives Committee,
stated that this is an emergency
and should be considered as such.
Members of the relief commit
tee, meanwhile, are continuing
efforts to secure campus backing
for their projects. Machinery for
publicity and collections lias been
set up, according to committee
member A 1 Strain. Ten thousand
animals have already been sent
to Europe under the program, and
one heifer will save the lives of
10 children, he estimated.
