# 'We Must Not Fail'—Truman; U.N. Action Asked on Famine
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 22 (UP). —Only joint action by the United Na
tions will shorten the famine emergency abroad, President Truman warned
Congress today as Secretary of Agriculture Clinton P. Anderson indicated
UNRRA may get more food than is earmarked for it.
In a letter forwarding a report, on UNRRA operations for the three
♦ months ended Dec. 31, 1945, Mr.

Truman said the United States must
moot the full measure of its UNRRA ;
obligations—"we must not fail." He
pointed out that other U.N. mem- i
hers have equal responsibility, de- |
claring:
"Only concerted action hv the
United Nations (and primarily, of
the producing countries) can,
even at (his date, avert the pro
longation of emergency conditions
throughout the world. Now, more
than ever, intensified efforts to
match need with supply are re
quired of us.
The Dchts of War
"Our continued participation in
UNRRA marks the fulfillment of a
pledge and the discharge of a debt
of those who, beyond the common
sacrifice of life and material re
sources, endured the devastation i
and brutalities that we were i
spared."
Anderson told a press conference
he believed more supplies would be
diverted to UNRRA, but he would
not know definitely until after a
meeting of the combined food board
Wednesday.
Asked if the board would grant
the request of Fiorcllo 11. LaGuar- |
dia, UNRRA director-general, for
700,000 tons of grain cereals month
ly, starting in May, he said, "He's
not going to get that—if we had
uivnn LaGuardia 700,000 tons a
month every month he asked for it,
there wouldn't be anything left."
Butch Asks More
LaGuardia also has asked for 300,-
000 tons of cereals immediately.
Apprised of Anderson's state
ment, LaGuardia said that, if that
v/as the case, there would have to
be fairer distribution of the supplies
available. He said the crisis is a
continuing affair, for as soon as the
wheat shortage is solved there will
be other problems such as fats and
oil.
"The distillers saw what was j
coming," lie said. "They had 11.-
000,0(1(1 more gallons of spirits in
storage in February (ban for (he
same period of last year."
He" declined to say whether he I
favors bread rationing.
Other Countries Queried
Anderson said the board is try- |
ing to get other countries with tem
porary grain surpluses to divert
food to hungry neighbors, with the
understanding their stocks would
be replaced after the summer har
vest .
The President said world recov
ery, still a "formidable task," is the
primary objective of national policy
but the United States cannot be as
sured of peace and prosperity while
famine, disease, and destitution ex
ist elsewhere.
The United States started on
shorter bread rations today, as the I
25 per cent cut in flour consumption
went into effect. Th" smaller sup
plies of bread will he felt immedi
ately as bread is made on a day-to- I
day basis.
