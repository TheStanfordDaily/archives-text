# Vandenberg 'Reluctantly' Supports British Loan As Deadlock Threatens
## Democrats Introduce Amendment To Float Special Public Bond Issue; Republican Bloc Obstructs Vote 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 22 (UP). —Sen. Arthur 11. Vandenberg, K., Midi.,
threw* his weight "reluctantly" behind the proposed $3,750,000,000 British
loan today in a dramatic hid to win over a handful of wavering Republi
can votes and break a threatened Senate deadlock on the controversial
bill.
In it full-dress spcech delivered on the eve of his departure for the;

Big Four Foreign Ministers' Con
ference in Paris, he appealed to the
Senate to approve the loan solely
in the interests of the United States.
Vandenberg, probably the most
influential G.0.1', spokesman on
foreign affairs, said he intended to
vote for the measure in the "re
luctant but lirm conviction" that
it was needed for the continued
welfare of the American people.
"It is a gigantic speculation to
pass this loan," he said soberly,
"but not to pass it is even a great
er specnlaf'on."
He said that on its fate hangs the
question whether the United States
will assume economic as well as po
litical leadership of the world.
Loan to Protect Ourselves
"If we do not take this leader
ship," he warned, "some other great
and powerful nation will capitalize
upon our failure."
Democratic Majority Leader Al
ben W. Barklcy listened intently
throughout the address. When il
ended, he crossed the Senate aisle
to shako Vandenberg's hand warm
ly, while other Senators from both
sides crowded around to add their
congratulations.
Meantime, Senators Edwin (\
Johnson, I)., Colo., and Olin I).
Johnston, I)., S.C., introduced an
amendment under which a $2,-
750,000,0(10 special bond issue to
float the loan would be offered for
public sale. But the bonds would
carry no U.S. government obliga
tions for repayment. In addition,
the measure would authorize the
Reconstruction Finance Corpora
tion to loan Britain $1,000,000,000
repayable at two per cent inter
est.
The two Senators long have con
tended that the people should be
the sole judge whether the British
loan is a good risk by investing in
it. If they turn it down, they claim,
then no loan is warranted.
Vandenberg's Decision Decisive
Vandenberg's address was calcu
lated to have a decisive effect on
the outcome of the loan vote. Un
official polls indicate the Senate is
almost evenly divided on the meas
ure, with 36 against it, 34 in favor,
and 17 undecided.
In addition, there is a strong
undercover sentiment for post
ponement of the issue until such
vital domestic legislation as draft
and price control extension and
the Army-Navy merger have been
disposed of.
Barklcy insists, however, thai he
will fight any stalling maneuvers
because ho fears delay might wreck
the international economic machin
ery established under the Bret ton
Woods agreement.
He said he also opposes amend
ments by some Senators, such as
that sponsored by Sen. Ernest
McFarland, I)., Ariz., to give the
United States permanent posses
sion of bases leased from Britain.
He said such amendments would
force renegotiation of the entire
loan and hold up the credit until
next year.
Vandenberg tacitly supported
Bark ley's plea for quick action, al
though he acknowledged that his
own decision had been as difficult
and perplexing as any in his !><'
years of Senate service.

years of Senate service.
WASHINGTON, April 22 (UP). —Sen. Arthur 11. Vandenberg, K., Midi.,
threw* his weight "reluctantly" behind the proposed $3,750,000,000 British
loan today in a dramatic hid to win over a handful of wavering Republi
can votes and break a threatened Senate deadlock on the controversial
bill.
In it full-dress spcech delivered on the eve of his departure for the;

Big Four Foreign Ministers' Con
ference in Paris, he appealed to the
Senate to approve the loan solely
in the interests of the United States.
Vandenberg, probably the most
influential G.0.1', spokesman on
foreign affairs, said he intended to
vote for the measure in the "re
luctant but lirm conviction" that
it was needed for the continued
welfare of the American people.
"It is a gigantic speculation to
pass this loan," he said soberly,
"but not to pass it is even a great
er specnlaf'on."
He said that on its fate hangs the
question whether the United States
will assume economic as well as po
litical leadership of the world.
Loan to Protect Ourselves
"If we do not take this leader
ship," he warned, "some other great
and powerful nation will capitalize
upon our failure."
Democratic Majority Leader Al
ben W. Barklcy listened intently
throughout the address. When il
ended, he crossed the Senate aisle
to shako Vandenberg's hand warm
ly, while other Senators from both
sides crowded around to add their
congratulations.
Meantime, Senators Edwin (\
Johnson, I)., Colo., and Olin I).
Johnston, I)., S.C., introduced an
amendment under which a $2,-
750,000,0(10 special bond issue to
float the loan would be offered for
public sale. But the bonds would
carry no U.S. government obliga
tions for repayment. In addition,
the measure would authorize the
Reconstruction Finance Corpora
tion to loan Britain $1,000,000,000
repayable at two per cent inter
est.
The two Senators long have con
tended that the people should be
the sole judge whether the British
loan is a good risk by investing in
it. If they turn it down, they claim,
then no loan is warranted.
Vandenberg's Decision Decisive
Vandenberg's address was calcu
lated to have a decisive effect on
the outcome of the loan vote. Un
official polls indicate the Senate is
almost evenly divided on the meas
ure, with 36 against it, 34 in favor,
and 17 undecided.
In addition, there is a strong
undercover sentiment for post
ponement of the issue until such
vital domestic legislation as draft
and price control extension and
the Army-Navy merger have been
disposed of.
Barklcy insists, however, thai he
will fight any stalling maneuvers
because ho fears delay might wreck
the international economic machin
ery established under the Bret ton
Woods agreement.
He said he also opposes amend
ments by some Senators, such as
that sponsored by Sen. Ernest
McFarland, I)., Ariz., to give the
United States permanent posses
sion of bases leased from Britain.
He said such amendments would
force renegotiation of the entire
loan and hold up the credit until
next year.
Vandenberg tacitly supported
Bark ley's plea for quick action, al
though he acknowledged that his
own decision had been as difficult
and perplexing as any in his !><'
years of Senate service.
