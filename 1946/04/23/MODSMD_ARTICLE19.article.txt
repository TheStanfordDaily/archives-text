llot water was the cause of it
all. Ruble girls couldn't take
liallis or showers, Kohle cooks
were in a frenzy worrying over
what (hey would feed their rave
nous diners, the Kohle halls were
threatened with a flood (if the
faucets were turned on), and Ihe
Kohle irls had an "emergency"
picnic at the Boathouse last night.
Yes, the hot-water hoiler Itlew
up.
We are now happv to report
that the girls are no longer dirty,
hungry, or afraid of floating to
their S o'clock classes.
