Following up its policy of "citizens first,
veterans second," Ihe American Veterans
Committee is urging all Stanford voters to
register for the ccming state and national
elections in a move The Daily is glad to
endorse.
Main emphasis for Farm voters is being
placed on the fact that out-of-state students
may vote because of Iheir Stanford residence.
Requirements are:
Legai residence in California since June 4,
10<l r ). (You may declare California your legal
residence if you have been attending school
here even though you normally live in an
other state.
Legal residence in this county since April
4 ol this year. (Attendance at Stanford this
quarter will fill this requirement.)
A special desk will be at Engineering Cor
ner today through Thursday, registration

deadline, to register Stanford voters. Regis
tration will give voters the right to vote in the
primaries June 4, and in the general elections
November 11.
Chief importance of the A.V.C. move to
encourage registration is the indication it
gives of a rising tendency among college
voters to participate in something other than
the presidential election.
Now more than ever the state assembly
and the nation's congress need men of high
calibre to carry through intelligent law-mak
ing policies in the chaotic postwar years.
These men need the support of all voters,
college students not excepted. The men we
elect today will formulate the policies under
which we will live tomorrow.
These are the facts behind the A.V.C. pol
icy. Thfc rest is up to Stanford students and
faculty members.- M.S.
