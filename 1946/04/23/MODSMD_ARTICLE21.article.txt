THE RIFT IN MANCHURIA

The Far East, like Europe, is struggling in the
toils of strategic fears, zones of interest, and rival
i.lcologi 's. The gulf between rival system of life—
r;j.italism and Americanism on one hand, agrarian
n-foim, j.tale socialism, and Russian influence on the
olhor hand 4s one which is threatening Korea,
Manchuria, and even Japan.
There ftems to be little doubt that Russia is seek
ing a special position for herself in Manchuria.
Ther6 also seems to he little doubt that should she
succeed in achieving such a position, a strong,
united China, the goal for which the United States
has been working for a century, would be retarded
for decades. Manchuria contains more than half the
industrial strength of China and if that strength
wort- channeled into Russia's economy rather than
Ct iiia' 1 , then Siberian Russia would be the eco
iu in < focus of Asia.
Russia, Britain, France, Germany, and Japan
ail carved out spheres of influence for themselves
in China im to 1 f#l4. The tide then reversed itself
and special western privileges in China were
driven from their positions with the exception of
Russia. Russia is now sticking to its position of
the d::ys of the czars, from which it was toppled
by Japanese armed power. Russia is trying to
reclaim what Japan took from her.
While Russia is setting out to do that she happens
to be bumping against another reclamation project
that of China marching toward its own unity and
integrity. If Russia were to regain its old position
in Manchuria it would be a gain at China's expense.
Internationally, then, the salient fact is that
Manchuria does not present an example of new
Russian expansion so much as it illustrates an
example of Russian reactionary movement re
sisting the American diplomatic drive for the
(ulmination of China's unity and integrity.

Domestically, the struggle going on between the
Chinese Nationalists and Communists in Man
churia has become a key to the future internal
peace of China. It is providing the sternest test
yet faced by the three-party executive headquar
ters which was set up at, Peiping with American
guidance and participation to implement the Jan
uary civil war truce.
Russia is assumed to be vacating Manchuria and
in its wake the Chinese Nationalists and Commu
nists are clashing to see who will occupy the va
cated area. The Communists appear determined to
oppose government advances and demand that any
"taking over" should be done by common action.
General Chou insists that his Communists do not
object to the government's sending troops to take
over territory vacated by Russia but lie asserts that
the Communists are also Chinese and that they
could also restore Chinese sovereignty in Man
churia. He adds that the Nationalists are attacking
the Communists and are making no plans to end
hostilities. With this perspective in mind he states
that the Communists will go on their own and oc
cupy the places which Russia vacates the same way
in which the Nationalists do.
The Nationalists accuse the Communists of
multiplying their forces within Manchuria, and
of moving around extensively. They refuse to
deal with the Communists on political or military
matters until the process of "taking over" sover
eignty from (he Russians is completed. Chiang
Kai-shek's troops feel that acquiescence to Com
munists' requests would mean consolidation of
the latter's control over most of Manchuria.
Domestically, then, it would appear that until
the two rival armies are unified and the truce teams
in the field given power to negotiate a real peace,
the unity and integrity of China will be further
delayed.—Ralph Hovis

Manchuria, and even Japan.
There ftems to be little doubt that Russia is seek
ing a special position for herself in Manchuria.
Ther6 also seems to he little doubt that should she
succeed in achieving such a position, a strong,
united China, the goal for which the United States
has been working for a century, would be retarded
for decades. Manchuria contains more than half the
industrial strength of China and if that strength
wort- channeled into Russia's economy rather than
Ct iiia' 1 , then Siberian Russia would be the eco
iu in < focus of Asia.
Russia, Britain, France, Germany, and Japan
ail carved out spheres of influence for themselves
in China im to 1 f#l4. The tide then reversed itself
and special western privileges in China were
driven from their positions with the exception of
Russia. Russia is now sticking to its position of
the d::ys of the czars, from which it was toppled
by Japanese armed power. Russia is trying to
reclaim what Japan took from her.
While Russia is setting out to do that she happens
to be bumping against another reclamation project
that of China marching toward its own unity and
integrity. If Russia were to regain its old position
in Manchuria it would be a gain at China's expense.
Internationally, then, the salient fact is that
Manchuria does not present an example of new
Russian expansion so much as it illustrates an
example of Russian reactionary movement re
sisting the American diplomatic drive for the
(ulmination of China's unity and integrity.

Domestically, the struggle going on between the
Chinese Nationalists and Communists in Man
churia has become a key to the future internal
peace of China. It is providing the sternest test
yet faced by the three-party executive headquar
ters which was set up at, Peiping with American
guidance and participation to implement the Jan
uary civil war truce.
Russia is assumed to be vacating Manchuria and
in its wake the Chinese Nationalists and Commu
nists are clashing to see who will occupy the va
cated area. The Communists appear determined to
oppose government advances and demand that any
"taking over" should be done by common action.
General Chou insists that his Communists do not
object to the government's sending troops to take
over territory vacated by Russia but lie asserts that
the Communists are also Chinese and that they
could also restore Chinese sovereignty in Man
churia. He adds that the Nationalists are attacking
the Communists and are making no plans to end
hostilities. With this perspective in mind he states
that the Communists will go on their own and oc
cupy the places which Russia vacates the same way
in which the Nationalists do.
The Nationalists accuse the Communists of
multiplying their forces within Manchuria, and
of moving around extensively. They refuse to
deal with the Communists on political or military
matters until the process of "taking over" sover
eignty from (he Russians is completed. Chiang
Kai-shek's troops feel that acquiescence to Com
munists' requests would mean consolidation of
the latter's control over most of Manchuria.
Domestically, then, it would appear that until
the two rival armies are unified and the truce teams
in the field given power to negotiate a real peace,
the unity and integrity of China will be further
delayed.—Ralph Hovis
