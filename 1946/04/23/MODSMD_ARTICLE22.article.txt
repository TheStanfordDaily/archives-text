# BULL SESSION

### H.D. THOREAU 
If you haven't a lab this afternoon you might sidle
up to the United Artists Theater in San Francisco
to sec "The most daring motion picture ever made!"'
Yes, "The Outlaw," starring that new discovery
and those two oid reliables, is finally being released
for public consumption.
The new discovery of course is Jack Beutel, one
of Howard Hughes' most promising proteges. The
two old reliables are Walter Huston and Thomas
Mitchell. We understand that "The Outlaw" is one
of those adventure stories with an all-male cast.
From what we've heard the release of the picture
has been held up for the past several years due to
rome conflicting opinions on a couple of prominent
technical matters.

Overheard two veterans in a heated argument
on the Quad yesterday morning. One veteran be
came so angry that he proceeded to tell his fellow
v( teran off in the strongest words possible. As a
final shot he descended to name-calling:
"Why you . . . you thoreau!"

We are frankly sorry to see that Ram's Head was
too bull-headed to take our suggestion to postpone
the spring show for 56 years.
Now they are starting production on "East
Lynne" with only three weeks to go. They have ap
parently junked the idea of a "student-written
show" entirely. Not only is "East Lynne" not "stu
dent written," but there is no proof that it is a
".show."
Do they hold the usual public castings. No!
At the same time they announce that they're
doing the show, they come lip with the tailor
made cast.
Is this thing degenerating into a private affair
which the members and friends of Ram's Head are
producing for their own aggrandizement? Are they
giving the veterans an even break?
From what we've seen of the spring show man
agement, wo would think they'd be better suited
to put on "The Tempest," by W. Shakespeare, non
student.
