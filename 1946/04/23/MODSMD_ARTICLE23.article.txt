### BILL STEIF 
The cry of the day from not-so-far-ofl' places
seems to he "food." Several weeks ago, despite
Papal admonitions, Italians rioted a number of
cities and looted UNIiKA stores of wheat. In France
the people are reduced to an average of something
like 1.200 or 1,1500 calories a day which is about
half of what you and we manage to consume with
out effort here each day.
In England the rationing system is even tighter
than it was duiing the war days and in the Balkans,
especially in Greece, the measure between life and
starvation seems to be how much food one can
scrounge out of the rubble of shattered towns and
cities. Germany, of course, is hungry in spots,
though a chap just back from Bavaria reports that
the Germans seem to be pretty plump in that pri
marily agricultural district.
The situation in China and India is, if anything,
even worse. An emissary from the Chinese gov
ernment was through San Francisco last week
and with open bitterness revealed that out of the
million tons of rice needed to keep the ravaged
Chinese from starving this year, only <1X,0(t0 tons
have been received.
Our man, Herbert Hoover, is now touring the
world to get what should be the straight line on the
whole situation—but the trouble with such tours is
that while the statistics are being compiled people
are dying.

Meanwhile, at Stanford University, our men in
volve themselves in acrimonious disputes about
whether or not veterans are being insulted.
We do not intend to step on anyone's feet if we
can help it, but it dries seem to us and we'll be the
first to admit that our opinion is of tiny import
that instead of becoming all worked up about our
fellow columnist's alleged 'insult" of the veteran,
the AVC ought to live up to its motto of "Citizens
Hist, Veterans Second." And from where we sit
this means striving to be "citizens of the world,"
striving to understand the people in the rest, of the
world and striving to help those persons who are
now faced by the specter of starvation
'1 his goes not only for the AVC—that organiza
tion just comes to our rather ordinary mind first
because it's made a little news recently and be
cause we presumed that veterans were especially
sensitive to what's going on outside "the Ivory
lower" it is our belief that all the organizations
on campus ought to orient themselves so as to
look outward
Philip Wylie wrote a book called "Generation of
Vipers" a couple of years ago and, though we think
that he made some good point;;, we don't want to
bt lieve very much of what he said. At worst we
think we might he known as a "generation of grip
ers"—and the peculiar aspect of the whole matter
is that we really have so little to gripe about.
