# Abe Lewis, Farm Grad, Plugs for College Ball
## 
### 
HONOLULU. T.H. (Special to the Daily).—People who say college
baseball is dead have never talked to Abe Lewis, Jr.
For the benefit of those of you whose memories do not extend back
half a century, Mr. Lewis is—or was—the Stanford University slugger
who piled up a batting average of .592 during his three years of playing

with the varsity nine. That was in
1893, *94, arid 'C 5.
Itecord Stands
That record still stands today, al
though plenty of Stanford hopefuls
during the past 50 years have aimed
at it. Stanford recently presented
Mr. Lewis with a three-star Block
"S" blanket, the highest athletic to
ken of merit it bestows, in recogni
tion of his feat.
Mr. Lewis, now a successful at
torney here, gets pretty impatient
with people who mourn the demise
of college baseball. He admits that
right now football has the spotlight,
but he is convinced baseball is com
ing back into its own.
Interest Increasing
"More and more attention is be
ing, and will be, paid to the na
tional pastime in colleges and uni
versities throughout the country,"
he :>ays.
"They're beginning to realize
that this is America's game and that
il will always be played. I look to
a rejuvenation of the sport on the ;
campus and I predict a better
standard ol play which will result
in the development of many stars j
for the major leagues.
I'ootliall King
"It's true that football now and j
lor some time in the past has over- j
shadowed baseball, but you'll find j
soon more and more emphasis will [
be placed on the national pastime," j
he -.aid.
Mi 1 . Lewis believes the war gave |
a tremendous impetus to baseball.
New attendance records were set
wherever the game was played;
millions of men in uniform, includ
ing quite a few who will be re
turning to schools and colleges,
found a new interest in the game j
as players or spectators.
War Helped Baseliall
Interest in baseball in Hawaii, i

which has always been high, soared
during the war. Service teams,
composed of top-flight major lea
guers, played before overflow
crowds.
When Mr. Lewis was in college,
Stanford's baseball rival was the
University of California. In 27 trips
at bat in seven games with Califor
nia, he connected for 16 hits, scored
20 runs, and stole 15 bases.
Mas "Lucky Day"
In the last game he played he had
what he modestly describes as a
"lucky day." He went to bat five
times, made five hits, four runs, and
stole two bases.
After the last put-out he went to
the dugout to get his bat and found
it in the hands of the manager of
the Oakland club of the Pacific
Coast League.
"He told me I wouldn't get my
bat back," Mr. Lewis relates, "un
less I consented to accept an offer
to play on his team. I told him I
came to college to study law."
The manager then offered him
$150 to play three games a week—
a pretty fair figure in those days.
Mr. Lewis refused that and a higher
offer.
Played Football
He also played football for Stan
ford in his junior year under the
late Walter Camp. Weighing only
141VS> pounds, Mr. Lewis was re
luctant to tangle with the grid hus
kies for fear of injuring himself for
baseball, but Camp appealed to his
school spirit and he consented. A
young man named Herbert Hoover
was manager of the team.
Mr. Lewis got into a few games,
but his first loVe was baseball. He's
been preaching baseball, particu
larly the college variety, ever since
his playing days.
