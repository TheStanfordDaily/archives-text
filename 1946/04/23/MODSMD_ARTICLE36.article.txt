promptly at 4:30. He also added that more umpires are needed. All those
interested should contact Mr. Bugge immediately.

in early-game play. Encina Cellar
plays the Phi Delts in another
League I game.
The remaining League I contests
pits the Phi Psi's aga.vnst Encina 4E.
Both teams have .sparkled in spots,
and should give good accounts ot
themselves this afternoon.
In League 11, Encina 1W plays
the Zeta Psi's. Buchanan, which
has been holding daily practice ses
sions on their spacious lawn, plays
the Beta Theta Pi's. In past quar

powerhouse aggregations, but this
season so far haven't impressed any
major league scouts.

test is rated strictly a toss-up, with
the possible edge going to A.T.O.
