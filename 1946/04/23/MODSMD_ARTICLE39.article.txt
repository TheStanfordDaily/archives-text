## Chapter One: Western Roll---Stanford Manner 
### 
By SMILEY F ARK AS
The Wesi became a factor in track and field, which previously had been
the almost exclusive domain of the East's "Ivy League" schools, with the
development of the Western roll by Stanford's George Horine.
Horine, as was previously stated, developed the roll in his back yard
while practicing high jumping and threw the rule book of that day away.

j The East fought back, declaring it
j illegal, in favor of the scissors, and
I even went so far as to disregard
I records set by jumpers using Ho
rine's style.
The battle grew to white-hot in
tensity, and was culminated when
Stanford's Dink Terrtpleton was
disqualified in the 1920 Olympic
Games finals for using the roll. At
any rate, the list of adherents and
partisans to and for the roll grew
to overwhelming proportions until
i the rules were rewritten to permit
the use of the roll.
In 1912, Horine hit 6 feet GVa
inches and later upped it to 6 feet
7, which was unbeaten for two
years. In 1914, Eddie Beeson, a Cal
! hurdler and pumper who had com
peted against Horine, copied his
style and upped the mark to 6 feet
7% inches, a mark that was un
challenged for 11 years.
At any rate, from Horine's day
â€žon, the West was regarded as a
serious competitor by the track
goliaths of the East, and despite
the absence of world record set
ters at the Farm for 13 years, the
i West continued to develop cham-
J pions who consistently brought
home year after year the East's
most vaunted championships.
The prowess of the Stanford men
then shifted from the jumping
J events to the weights, and the In
dians next produced a brace of dis
i cus record holders.
Glen Hartranft, now director of
' athletics at San Jose State and for
, rnei'ly head track coach at the same

institution, flipped the platter 157
feet 1% inches in 1925, but the mark
was short-lived, for the following
year Hauser of U.S.C. tossed it out
a foot farther.
The Trojan's record was good
until 1J129, when Eric Krenz, who
two years later was to drown
while swimming in Lake Tahoe,
threw the discus Kill feet 8 :, 4
inches. Krenz's record lasted only
one year, Paul Jessop of Seattle
outdistancing the mark by six
feet.
One Indian sandwiched his ex
ploits in between the two discUs
throwers, and while no world's rec
ords were set. it is worthy of men
tion. In 1928. Bob King, now a
Berkeley doctor, won the 1.C.4-A.,
N.C.2-A., and Olympic Games try
outs, and went on to Amsterdam to
win the Olympics with a leap of 6
feet 4% inches.
Only one other Indian has ever
taken a first in the Olympic
Games, Hill Miller turning the
trick at L.A. in 1932 in the pole
vault at 11 feet l 7 s inches. Miller
that year tied for first in the
1.C.4-A., and repeated the next,
and bis mark set in the Olympics
is still a Stanford record.
Next we will take up the records
set by Stanford trackmen.
