# Dibble Bidders Solve Conflict
## 
### 
Three groups which have differ
ent reasons for wanting sections of
Dibble Hospital — Stanford, Menlo
Park, and Sequoia Union High
School —told Federal Public Hous
ing Administration representative
Frank Rose yesterday they can
reach a solution of their problems
in the property without conflicting
with one another.
All three are interested in vari
ous portions of the installation at
Dibble. Stanford desires housing
units for married veterans. Sequoia
wants a site for the erection of a
new high school, and the Menlo
Park Recreation Committee seeks
to establish a playground on part of
the property.
Representatives of the three
groups, Alf Brandin for Stanford,
Mayor Charles Burgess for Menlo.
and Charles Merrill for the school
trustees, told Mr. Rose their inter
ests arc in no way conflicting.
Mr. Brandin delivered contracts —
calling for 300 housing units —signed
by Dr. Donald B. Trcsidder, Uni
versity President, to the FPHA in
San Francisco yesterday.
No further word has been received
on the exclusive report revealed in
last Friday's Daily that the Army
may intend to continue use of Dib
ble as a general Army hospital, al
though Gen. Joseph Stilwell, act
ing commander of the Ninth Serv
ice Command, made a special visit
Saturday to tour the hospital
"rounds.
