# The 						Umpire's Verdict

### JOHN SABIN 
The Pacific Coast League base
ball race began to take definite
shape last week, with ten full games
separating the first-place San Fran
cisco Seals from the collar-dwelling
Sacramento Solons.
Two major changes resulted in
the pennant drive from last
week's play. Los Angeles moved
into contention for first place as
Lefty O'Doul's Seals had a tough
time with Casey Stengel's Oak
land Acorns. The hard - driving
Angels won ten straight, ending
in Sunday's double-header, Which
they divided with Sacramento.
The other change was with the
Portland Beavers. Manager Marv
Owens' nine finally began to win
ball games, at the expense of the
Hollywood Stars. The Beavers won
easily in a series climaxed by Ad
Liska's no-run, no-hit victory in
the second game of Sunday's
double-header.
The race is now between the
Seals and the Angels, only one
game apart. L.A. rooters can take
cheer from last week's games, in
which their team took six out of
seven from Sacramento. Angel
hopes are due for another boost
in the next few weeks when the
Chicago Cubs cut their roster.
Los Angeles is a Cub farm team
and is slated to get much of the
excess baggage Chicago is cur
rently carrying around.
Seal hopes took a dive Sunday
when Ray Perry injured himself
en route to second base during the
first game. Perry plays a bang-up
game at third base and is known
for hitting in the clutches. His
loss, probably permanent, is a seri
ous blow to the Seals. His spot will
be filled by Tod Jennings, a good
hitter but a poor fielder.
This week will see the Seals play
ing host to the weak Sacramento
team while the Angels entertain the
surprisingly powerful Oaks. Up
north, San Diego will be at Port
land and Hollvwood at Seattle.
