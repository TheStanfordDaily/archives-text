## 
### 
SEATTLE, Wash., April 22 (UP).
â€”Russian naval Lieutenant Nico
lai Gregorovich Red in, 2!), today
pleaded not guilty to five charges
of espionage for the Soviet gov
ernment at arraignment before
Federal Judge John C. Bowen
here.
Judge Bowen denied defense
counsel's request for a week's
postponement of the hearing, but
agreed to permit the defense to
study the charges, which claim
Rcdin obtained and tried to transit
to Russia secret details of the USS
Yellowstone, destroyer-tender, for
10 days and to revise the plea if
they desire.
Rcdin, wearing his blue Russian
uniform, waived formal reading
of the charges today and entered
his plea of innocence. He had
claimed the charges were "a pro
vocation and a build-up," after his
arrest at Portland, Ore., March 20.
Attorneys quoted Rcdin as hop
ing that American-Russian rela
tions would not be endangered by
the case. Rcdin is free on $10,000
bond.
