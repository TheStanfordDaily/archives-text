# Gothic Woodcuts Hung in Gallery
## 
### 
An exhibition of illuminated
Gothic woodcuts, especially appro
priate for the Easter season, is on
display at the Stanford University
Art Gallery through April 28.
The exhibit by the early German
masters is divided into two sec
tions: "Illuminated Gothic Wood
cuts" and"The Great Passion," Al
breeht Duerer's famous cycle of
prints depicting the life of Christ.
All of the prints originated and
were hand colored during the first
decades following Gutenberg's in
vention of the printing press.
"The Great Passion" appeared
originally in 1511 as a book, with
the corresponding text of the New
Testament passage on the reverse
side of each cut. The edition cur
rently on exhibit omits the text.
The traveling exhibit is on loan to
Stanford from the Gallerie St. Eti
enne in New York. Gallery hours
are Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10
a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 5 p.m.
The public is cordially invited.
