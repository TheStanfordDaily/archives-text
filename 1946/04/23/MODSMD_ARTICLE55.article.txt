### 
CHICAGO, April 22 (UP).—Pres
ident Walter Reuther of the CIO ;
j United Automobile Workers' Union j
: and UAW Vice - President R. J.
! Thomas denounced each other in I
j bitter statements tonight in a fight I
over control of the 700,000-member j
| union. j
The split within the union's exec- j
■ utive ranks, which had been in
! creasing since Reuther unseated
Thomas as president at the union's
! Atlantic City- convention recently,
! broke wide open when Thomas
; charged that Reuther was attempt
| ing "to freeze" him out of the un
! ion.
Reuther, making his first public
j reply here to his opposition on the
I union's 22 - man executive board,
said, "It is regrettable that Mr.
Thomas is finding it difficult to ad
just himself to his new status in the
union.
The executive board began meet
| ings here last Tuesday and Thomas
1 and two of his supporters, Secre
tary - Treasurer George F. Addes
and Vice - President Richard T.
Leonard, openly opposed Reuther
in several moves.
Thomas, heavy-set, middle-aged,
I began the verbal battle today when
he accused Reuther of attempting
to "build a political machine for
himself" and oust Thomas from the
; union.
"Reuther is more afraid of my
i power over the rank and file than
with that of any other individual,"
Thomas said.
