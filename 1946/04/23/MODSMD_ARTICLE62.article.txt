BAD OYENHAUSEN, Germany, I
April 22 (UP). —Practically every
unmarried Tommy in the British !
zone of Germany who would com- j
mit himself said today that the ban !
against marrying German girls I
should be removed.
The women's services—the ATS,
WAAFS, and WRENS—showed an
equal solidarity against removing it.
''In my opinion there's not a girl
to touch the German girl—they are
the hardest working girls I have
ever seen," said Private Frank Al
lett of London.
"At least 40 per cent of unmar- |
lied troops in Germany want to
marry German girls."
The woman's side was stated by j
Section Officer Mary Edmunds of j
Chesterfieid:
"I would not want my brother or )
son to marry a German girl at this
stage of Germany's return to a
place among world nations. It is far
too early yet."
