## 
### 
LONDON. April 22 (UP).â€”Brit
ish authorities took extra precau
tions to safeguard the Magna
Carta and the crown jewels to
night as Scotland Yard spread to
the entire world its search for live
handits who stole a fabulous jewel,
art and historical collection from
the 15th century Anne Boleyn cas
tle of Col. John Jacob Astor.
Col. Astor was expected to offer
a reward of $40,000, the largest in
British criminal history. Most of
the 1,500 articles stolen were
deeply hound up with English his
tory. For instance, there was a
prayer hook that King Henry gave
to Anne, whom he subsequently
had beheaded. Until the bandits
took it, it reposed in a case just
outside the room Henry VIII used
to occupy when he came to the
castle to court Anne.
The belief grew that the rob
bery was committeed by an inter
national gang, working on direct
assignment, and with a purchaser
in view.
