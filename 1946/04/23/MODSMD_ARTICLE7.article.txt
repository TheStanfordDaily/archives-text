# In Food Fight Late. Wallace Warns U.S.
## Appeals for Party Unity in S.F. Talk 
### 
I SAN FRANCISCO. April 22
I (I{P). â€” Secretary of Commerce
Henry A. Wallace warned tonight
! that America was "getting off to
a late start" in its emergency
drive to help feed the starving
peoples of the world.
Wallace, newly appointed chair
man of the nationwide emergency
! canned food collection campaign,'
I said at a press conference that he |
believed rationing would be the j
j best way to help solve the urgent j
j international famine situation but i
| that it would take "too long now" j
| to set up the machinery for renewal
of American rationing.
M isfake to Lift Rationing
"In retrospect," he said, "we can
| say it was a mistake to lift ration- !
ing."
"If we had known certain j
things would happen, such as the
failure of the Indian monsoons
and .lie droughts in southern Eu
rope," he declared, "I question if
i the rationing machinery would
have been taken down."
The Commerce Secretary, speak- j
S ing later at a gathering of Califor- j
j nia Democrats, called upon party j
| rebels in Congress to "repent" and ,
| return to the fold of the Adminis
j tration organization.
| Discipline Congressmen
He urged that anti-Administra- j
j tion Congressmen should be disci- j
plincd by the party to keep the
legislative branch of the govern
j mcnt functioning smoothly. It is !
j impossible, he said, for the voters j
j to control their representatives who j
j vote against the major issues upon i
I which they were elected.
"The voters do not have an op
portunity to reject them for two
j years," he said. 'Their party in ;
Congress should discipline them
immediately."
I Wallace, predicting that President
j Truman would win the Democratic
I presidential nomination in 1948, said j
J that, "a forward-looking, progres- j
sive man who seeks to secure the
i Republican nomination is wasting ,
his iime."
H" said there were a "few" Re- j
publicans in Congress who arc not j
"subservient to tlte rulers of the |
Republican party."
"We invite them to join us," he j
suggested. "Our welcome mat is [
out for them.
