# UN May Continue Iran Discussion
## 
### 
NEW YORK. April 22 (UP). â€”j
The United Nations Security Coun- i
cil may be asked to keep the Ira- J
nian question on its program even J
after May 6, deadline for evacua- |
tion of the last Russian troops, as I
an offset to possible continued So- |
viet pressure on the Tehran gov- j
eminent, diplomatic quarters re- !
ported tonight.
Any such move would bring
into the open the deep suspicion i
in the minds of some delegations
that "agreements" between Rns- j
sia and Iran were the result of
extreme pressure and a belief
that even if the Red Armv got out
Russian agents would remain in
the country, especially in the }
rebel province of Azerbaijan.
There was nothing concrete in
discussion of the possibility that the
Council might be asked to keep its
jurisdiction in the Russo - Iranian I
dispute after the May 6 deadline, j
Russia would regard any such ac- j
tion as an affront. U.N. circles sug- I
gested, however, that if the move !
were made it might be advanced on j
the basis of an Australian proposal, j
made during the crisis stage of the !
Iranian dispute, that the Council I
seek full documentary evidence of j
the entire situation.
