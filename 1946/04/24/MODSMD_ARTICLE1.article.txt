# AND WHERE DO YOU LIVE?
## AVC Holds Housing Poll for Married Men 
### 
A poll to find out how many married Stanford
students are in need of better housing facilities
will be conducted by the AVC in tomorrow's
Daily.
Results of the poll will be used by the AVC's
housing committee in setting up possible solu
tions to the housing problem and to back the
Administration's bid for the use of Dibble Hos
pital.
Ballots may be clipped from the Daily, filled
out, and deposited in the boxes which will be
found on the Engineering and History corners
of the Quad:

Sample questions:
1. Does lack of housing keep you separated
irom your wife?
Wife here Separated
2. Where do you live now?
On campus
Within 10 miles of campus
More than 10 miles from campus
It should be noted that the poll is being con
ducted not only for married veterans, but is
designed to include all married students who
are in need of housing.


VETERANS Joseph J. Cook,
10, and George Timko, of
Trenton, N.J., answer the
housing shortage with a house
hoat on the Delaware River.
When the hoat is completed,
they will move it up the river
and go into the hoat-huilding
business.
