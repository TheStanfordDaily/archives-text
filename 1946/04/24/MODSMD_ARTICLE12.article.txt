# U.S. Fails To Supply Needed Food
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. April 23 (UP).—
The United States is defaulting for
the third straight month on its
promise of grain to hungry nations
overseas, it was revealed tonight as
the government sounded a new
warning that foreign relief will leave
the nation short of sugar, fats and
oils, and probably butter for the rest
of 1946.
Chester Davis, chairman of the
President's Famine Kmergoncy
Committee, told newsmen that this
country shipped only 239,000 tons
of grain abroad during the first
ten days of April, almost 100,000
tons short of its announced goal.
U.S. Short in April
Coming on the heels of deficits in
grain exports in the two preceding
months, the April lag put the United
States 107,000 tons short of meeting
its pledged commitment of 6,000,000
tons for the first six months of this
year.
He said official reports on deliv--
eries of wheat stored on American
farms were far from encouraging,
but that he hoped the new export
bonus of 30 cents a bushel would
start a big flow of grains into the
overseas pipeline.
Hoover to Speak
He said ex-President Herbert
Hoover, honorary chairman of the
committee, would stump the nation
on his return from a tour of the
famine areas next month to drive
home to the people the urgency of
the crisis.
Davis said the United States
probably could do little to ease
the world shortage of fats and oils,
pointing out that we imported
about 1,000.000 tons of those com
modities annually before the war.
His statement followed disclos
ure of a continued tight situation in
domestic sugar supplies.
The bad news came from the
combined food board, a joint
American-British-Canadian com
mission which is trying to case
famine conditions abroad.
The board earmarked 5,433,000
short tons of sugar from American
civilians during 1946. It also set
aside 288,000 tons for American
military purposes, 50,000 tons for
minor U.S. exports, and the rest of
the supply for consumers in other
parts of the globe.

warning that foreign relief will leave
the nation short of sugar, fats and
oils, and probably butter for the rest
of 1946.
Chester Davis, chairman of the
President's Famine Kmergoncy
Committee, told newsmen that this
country shipped only 239,000 tons
of grain abroad during the first
ten days of April, almost 100,000
tons short of its announced goal.
U.S. Short in April
Coming on the heels of deficits in
grain exports in the two preceding
months, the April lag put the United
States 107,000 tons short of meeting
its pledged commitment of 6,000,000
tons for the first six months of this
year.
He said official reports on deliv--
eries of wheat stored on American
farms were far from encouraging,
but that he hoped the new export
bonus of 30 cents a bushel would
start a big flow of grains into the
overseas pipeline.
Hoover to Speak
He said ex-President Herbert
Hoover, honorary chairman of the
committee, would stump the nation
on his return from a tour of the
famine areas next month to drive
home to the people the urgency of
the crisis.
Davis said the United States
probably could do little to ease
the world shortage of fats and oils,
pointing out that we imported
about 1,000.000 tons of those com
modities annually before the war.
His statement followed disclos
ure of a continued tight situation in
domestic sugar supplies.
The bad news came from the
combined food board, a joint
American-British-Canadian com
mission which is trying to case
famine conditions abroad.
The board earmarked 5,433,000
short tons of sugar from American
civilians during 1946. It also set
aside 288,000 tons for American
military purposes, 50,000 tons for
minor U.S. exports, and the rest of
the supply for consumers in other
parts of the globe.
