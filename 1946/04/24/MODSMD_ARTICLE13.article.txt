# Court Tries Divorce Case
## 
### 
Stanford women (men too) have
a chance to learn some of the
trickier aspects of divorce pro
ceedings this evening, when moot
court (Supreme Court of the State
of Stanford) delves into the intri
cacies of community property.
The case to be heard is an ap
peal from a lower court where a
wife won a divorce on the grounds
of desertion. As usual, she was
awarded half the community prop
erty.
Troubles center around the deci
sion as to what this property is.
The lower court held it. to bo the
husband's earnings, the dividends
lie received from stock in the
Stanford Antique Shoppe," and ac
cident damages for which the hus
band was suing at the time of tho
divorce proceedings.
Community Properly?
It seems that Wife, represented
by attorneys Rex Shoop and Rich
ard Dutton, is happy with this ar
rangement, but Husband is not.
As a result his lawers, Robert
Steel and Dustin Jameson, will ar
gue before the high court that nei
ther the dividends nor the acci
dent damages are really community
property.
