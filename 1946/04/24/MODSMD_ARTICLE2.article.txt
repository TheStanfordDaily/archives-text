# Reds Boycott U.N. Council
## 
### 
NEW YORK. April 23 (UP). —The
United Nations Security Council in
flicted a new humiliating defeat on
Russia today by refusing to drop
the Iranian question, and Soviet del
egate Andrei A. Gromyko in his
second council boycott in four
weeks, announced he would take no
further part in Iranian discussions.
Gromyko told the United Press he
would not discuss Iran even when
the council meets May 6 to hear re
ports by Russia and Iran whether
Soviet troops have left Iranian terri
tory as promised.
Would Russia Report?
The question at once arose wheth
er Russia would defy the council's
authority by refusing to i - eport.
The vote, a sudden, dramatic cli
max after two hours of increasing
tension, came on a French resolu
tion by which the council would
have dropped the Iranian question
as settled, subject to a report by
UN Secretary General Trygve Lie
on developments.
8-3 Defeat
Gromyko associated himself with
the French resolution in order to
make it a test vote on the entire
question and the council steamroller
ran him down by an eight-to-three
vote against it.
Only Russia. France and Poland
voted for the French resolution and
no negative vote was necessary as a
council majority is seven out of
eleven votes. Seven delegations led
by the United States insiste# on
keeping Iran on the program until
both countries reported May 6
whether the Red Army this time had
kept its promise to get out of Iran.
The effect was an eight-to-three de
feat for Russia —a defeat which,
Gromyko had warned, would ques
tion the truth of Russia's statement
that its dispute with Iran was solved.
Russia Won't Participate
"The decision to keep the item on
the agenda is contrary to the UN
charter," Gromyko said tensely as
the vote was announced. "The So
viet delegation does not consider it
possible to continue to take part in
any council discussions on the
Iranian question."
