Dear Excommittee:
Have you noticed the v/ay that the tritest
of truisms, "When there's a will, there's a
way" keeps sneaking up behind us when
we're lethargic about some problem?
Take the student desire to actually do
something about helping the peoples of the
world who are suffering from lack of essen
tial foods.
Heifers for Relief, as you found out last
wv.lc, was organized to finance and assist in
th shipment of 10,000 head of cattle to the
nations which needed them. Not long after
wards a group of interested students decided
that they wanted to make the movement
successful by rounding up men to work on

the ships this summer, and by plugging an
all-campus drive for money to buy the cattle.
Yesterday Drives Committee approved
"Heifers for Relief" as an emergency drive,
brushing aside its former policy of one drive
a quarter.
Tonight, as members of the Executive Com
mittee which represents the student body,
you will have the final say as to whether
Stanford will stage an all-out effort to support
the "Heifers" plan of restocking the starving
nations of Europe.
We think you will agree that contributing
to the peace means contributing to the peo
ple who helped to win that peace. We think
that you will agree that in this case "there's
a way."
