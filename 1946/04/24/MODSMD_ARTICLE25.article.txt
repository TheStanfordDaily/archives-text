Stanford students aren't so dumb. When
it's hot, they head for the Boathouse. And
these days, these fuzzy, dripping days, the
crowd at the Boathouse is overflowing into
the Lake, into canoes, into every available
spot for 3unburning.
Keeping in mind the tragedies that have
occurred in past spring quaiters, the minor
accidents and the recent, all-too-frequent
drownings, The Daily makes its annual plea
for conscientious observance of the Boat
house rules—rules designed to safeguard
"lives and limbs" of Stanford students.
Here they are:
1) No swimming or canoeing when life

guards are not on duty.
2) No swimming beyond the rafts at any
time.
3) Canoes and boats shall not be over
loaded.
4) No non-swimmer shall be allowed in
canoes.
5) No one shall change places in a canoe
or boat off-shore.
6) No running on the Boathouse deck.
We're not saying that "the life-guards will
get ya if you don't watch out." We're asking
you to recognize the pressing need for these
rules, and to follow them to the last mean
ingful letter.— BMV.
