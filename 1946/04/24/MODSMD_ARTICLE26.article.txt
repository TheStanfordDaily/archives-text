# BULL SESSION

### H.D. THOREAU 
Were walking down Emerson Street on the
way down to the Palo Aito Laundry to get our
• boos half-soled.
Looked into an archway and saw a sign done
by Baker, the local sign painter, which said in
effect "National Administrative Board for Pepsi-
Cola Scholarships." We didn't know what to think.
What would you think if you saw a sign on a
door hading up a flight of stairs on a side street
in a nuiv.ll California town which said "National
Adciiuiitrative Board for Pepsi-Cola Scholar
ships"?
Naturally our first thought was that that was
a pretty expensive way of having a practical joke,
lull that explanation did not quite satisfy. Further
investigation was needed. We parked the car. We
walked up the stairs and looked into several rooms
before finding one hospitable enough to venture
into. In fact, we found an old school chum secre
tary ing in a friendly little office.
In no time at all the whole unlikely situation
was cleared up in our untidy mind.
Mr. Walter S. Mack, Jr., president of the
Pepsi-Cola Company, decided last year to put up
the money for 121 four-year scholarships per
year for deserving high school students. Pepsi-
Cola has nothing lo do with the deal beyond
footing the hill.
.John M. Stalnaker is director of the program,
and that accounts for the presence of the national
offices in our little community. The president of

the board is Floyd W. Reeves of the University of
Chicago. Other members whom you might have
heard of are AJvin C. Eurich, academic vice-presi
dent of Stanford, and Milton S. Eisenhower, presi
dent of Kansas Stale College. When Mr. Stalnaker
came out from Princeton last year the offices moved
along with him.
Briefly here is how the scholarships are award
ed. The top five per cent of the graduating class of
any high school in the country are eligible to take
a tost prepared by the College Entrance Examina
tion Board.
The 120 odd winners are allowed to go to any
accredited college of their choice with all tui
tion paid plus $25 a month plus traveling ex
penses from their homes to the schools and hack.
Of the winners for the first year, eight chose
Yale, five chose M.I.T. and Chicago, and four went
to Harvard, Howard, and Stanford. The rest are
scattered out in 60 other universities throughout
the country.
Mr. Mack hopes the idea will catch on with
other companies. He freely admits that he's not
taking great sums out of his own pocket to do this.
In fact, the company probably is not actually los
ing money since it would be given over to the gov
ernment in taxes otherwise.
But whether it's costing them any money or not,
it is a fine thing for the Pepsi-Cola Company to
do and we are quite happy about it. Drink Pepsi-
Cola.

was cleared up in our untidy mind.
Mr. Walter S. Mack, Jr., president of the
Pepsi-Cola Company, decided last year to put up
the money for 121 four-year scholarships per
year for deserving high school students. Pepsi-
Cola has nothing lo do with the deal beyond
footing the hill.
.John M. Stalnaker is director of the program,
and that accounts for the presence of the national
offices in our little community. The president of

the board is Floyd W. Reeves of the University of
Chicago. Other members whom you might have
heard of are AJvin C. Eurich, academic vice-presi
dent of Stanford, and Milton S. Eisenhower, presi
dent of Kansas Stale College. When Mr. Stalnaker
came out from Princeton last year the offices moved
along with him.
Briefly here is how the scholarships are award
ed. The top five per cent of the graduating class of
any high school in the country are eligible to take
a tost prepared by the College Entrance Examina
tion Board.
The 120 odd winners are allowed to go to any
accredited college of their choice with all tui
tion paid plus $25 a month plus traveling ex
penses from their homes to the schools and hack.
Of the winners for the first year, eight chose
Yale, five chose M.I.T. and Chicago, and four went
to Harvard, Howard, and Stanford. The rest are
scattered out in 60 other universities throughout
the country.
Mr. Mack hopes the idea will catch on with
other companies. He freely admits that he's not
taking great sums out of his own pocket to do this.
In fact, the company probably is not actually los
ing money since it would be given over to the gov
ernment in taxes otherwise.
But whether it's costing them any money or not,
it is a fine thing for the Pepsi-Cola Company to
do and we are quite happy about it. Drink Pepsi-
Cola.
Were walking down Emerson Street on the
way down to the Palo Aito Laundry to get our
• boos half-soled.
Looked into an archway and saw a sign done
by Baker, the local sign painter, which said in
effect "National Administrative Board for Pepsi-
Cola Scholarships." We didn't know what to think.
What would you think if you saw a sign on a
door hading up a flight of stairs on a side street
in a nuiv.ll California town which said "National
Adciiuiitrative Board for Pepsi-Cola Scholar
ships"?
Naturally our first thought was that that was
a pretty expensive way of having a practical joke,
lull that explanation did not quite satisfy. Further
investigation was needed. We parked the car. We
walked up the stairs and looked into several rooms
before finding one hospitable enough to venture
into. In fact, we found an old school chum secre
tary ing in a friendly little office.
In no time at all the whole unlikely situation
was cleared up in our untidy mind.
