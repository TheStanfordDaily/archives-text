A bit of this and that.
The day that a letter from Ram's Head was
printed—in which they accused this column of a
number of untruths—our column discussed the
point that it was not the issue itself that counted,
but rather the interest that the discussion might
;iwake.
This was not our way of skipping out of the
discussion. Our column was written before we saw
the letter (which we didn't see until it appeared).
We still hold to our original statements.
To bring an end to the "yah and how about
(hat stuff so there" contest: Miss Robertson,
Itam's Head president — in reference to the
length of time students were given to write
scripts for Ram's Head—said: "An error was
made—steps have been taken to correct it . . .
publicity will soon be out concerning the writ
ing of next fall's (iaieties." That will probably
be the first time in a good while that a fair time
was allowed to the entire student body.
Miss Robertson says that this action was taken
before our column appeared.
Call it coincidence if you so choose.
We're satisfied with the end result.

Mr. Hovis, of "IT CONCERNS US"—Daily Col
umn, would have us believe that all of the great
powers except them gangsters from RED RUSSIA
have given up all of their special privileges and
private territory in China. Oh Brother! May we

list just a few of the areas that the so-called
"great" powers, not including Russia, grabbed—and
are still holding, to wit: Burma, French Indo-
China, Siam (free in nsme only), Hong Kong,
whole sections of Shanghai, plus so-called "con
cessions" in many of China's major cities.
The National Association of Manufacturers —
known to their many friends across the nation dk
the NAM—ran an ad in yesterday's Examiner. It
seems Chester Bowles of the OPA challenged any
one to give him facts that would prove that the
OPA was holding up production.
So, in a screaming ad, the NAM gave what, they
would have us believe are the "facts." Their facts
consisted of "unbiased" statements by big indus
trialists who say nothing more than "the prompt
elimination of price control would rapidly increase
tlie production of .. ."
And my goodness me, but isn't Mr. Wesley
llardenbergh (of the American Meat Institute,
whatever that is), a great American. He seeks
only to give the people the kind of meat tehy
want. He says, "What is needed is for Congress
to do away entirely with OPA meat and live
stock regulations so that the consumers again
may get the kind of meat they want."
My heavens but Mi 1 . Hardenbergh is so nice to
the consumer. I'll bet if OPA regulations weren't
in effect he'd see that prices were lowered right
away. How can that dirty old Communist Chester
Bowles stifle us like that?

point that it was not the issue itself that counted,
but rather the interest that the discussion might
;iwake.
This was not our way of skipping out of the
discussion. Our column was written before we saw
the letter (which we didn't see until it appeared).
We still hold to our original statements.
To bring an end to the "yah and how about
(hat stuff so there" contest: Miss Robertson,
Itam's Head president — in reference to the
length of time students were given to write
scripts for Ram's Head—said: "An error was
made—steps have been taken to correct it . . .
publicity will soon be out concerning the writ
ing of next fall's (iaieties." That will probably
be the first time in a good while that a fair time
was allowed to the entire student body.
Miss Robertson says that this action was taken
before our column appeared.
Call it coincidence if you so choose.
We're satisfied with the end result.

Mr. Hovis, of "IT CONCERNS US"—Daily Col
umn, would have us believe that all of the great
powers except them gangsters from RED RUSSIA
have given up all of their special privileges and
private territory in China. Oh Brother! May we

list just a few of the areas that the so-called
"great" powers, not including Russia, grabbed—and
are still holding, to wit: Burma, French Indo-
China, Siam (free in nsme only), Hong Kong,
whole sections of Shanghai, plus so-called "con
cessions" in many of China's major cities.
The National Association of Manufacturers —
known to their many friends across the nation dk
the NAM—ran an ad in yesterday's Examiner. It
seems Chester Bowles of the OPA challenged any
one to give him facts that would prove that the
OPA was holding up production.
So, in a screaming ad, the NAM gave what, they
would have us believe are the "facts." Their facts
consisted of "unbiased" statements by big indus
trialists who say nothing more than "the prompt
elimination of price control would rapidly increase
tlie production of .. ."
And my goodness me, but isn't Mr. Wesley
llardenbergh (of the American Meat Institute,
whatever that is), a great American. He seeks
only to give the people the kind of meat tehy
want. He says, "What is needed is for Congress
to do away entirely with OPA meat and live
stock regulations so that the consumers again
may get the kind of meat they want."
My heavens but Mi 1 . Hardenbergh is so nice to
the consumer. I'll bet if OPA regulations weren't
in effect he'd see that prices were lowered right
away. How can that dirty old Communist Chester
Bowles stifle us like that?
A bit of this and that.
The day that a letter from Ram's Head was
printed—in which they accused this column of a
number of untruths—our column discussed the
