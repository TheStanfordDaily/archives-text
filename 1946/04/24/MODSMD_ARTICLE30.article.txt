# Holt Presents Piano Concert
## 
### 
Playing an interesting program
with deft and facile technique,
Henry Holt, Chechoslovakian pian
ist, proved to be one of the out
standing attractions of the Tuesday
Evening Series at Memorial Hall
last night.
The amazing dexterity which Mr.
Holt commands was especially ap
parent and effective in his inter
pretations of modern French music.
The only times that his playing
seemed not totally satisfactory were
in several fortissimo passages in
classical selections, when both clar
ity and power were lacking,
j Mr. Holt had ample opportunity
i to display his remarkably adept left
hand in the intricate Bach "Prelude
I and Fugue in C Sharp Minor"
| which opened the program. Bach is
j one of the most difficult of all com
posers to play flawlessly, and the
ease with which Holt performed
the "Prelude and Fugue" was mem
orable. The next selection, Bach's
"Toccata and Fugue in D Minor,"
; was originally written for organ,
and was not as effective as the other
Bach work. Some of the heavier
passages were indistinct.
| Mi\ Holt's rendition of Schu-
I "Sonata in F Sharp Minor"
I brought out the fine sweep of this
i music. He more than atoned for not
â–  very impressive playing of louder
! passages with the smoothness and
j brilliance shown in the "Aria" and
i "Allegro" sections.
After the intermission, "Four
Sketches" by Milhaud were pre
sented. The usual polish which one
associates with a Milhaud work
was seen in these Sketches. Par
ticularly interesting were the last
| two, "Alameda" and "Sobre la Lo-
I ma" ("Over the Hill"). During the
I applause that followed the last
j piece, Mr. Holt motioned for Darius
Milhaud himself, the composer of
the "Four Sketches," who was in
the audience, to arise. Milhaud,
; probably the greatest living French
! composer, formerly associated with
| (he "French Six" group of modern
! ist musicians, rose and bowed.
The outstanding presentation of
| the evening was Mr. Holt's peerless
j presentation of two Debussy pieces.
I Many pianists who have achieved
1 a wider fame ;is leading artists
could not hope to touch the finesse
I ;ind beauty of Holt's playing.
It is impossible to conceive that
his handling of "Reflections on the
Water" could be improved. Holt's
technique and the lightness of his
touch are very adaptable to the
impressionist's music. Debussy's
"L'lsle joyeuse" was almost as en
joyable as "Reflections on the Wa
ter," which could not be topped at
any concert.
The audience showed its appre
ciation of Mr. Holt's playing by
| summoning him back for two en
