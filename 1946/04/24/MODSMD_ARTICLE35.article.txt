handwritten letters, not originally
intended for publication, by Pastor
j Joseph Gauger of Elberfeld, Ger
many, dealing with political and
various other problems interpreted
from the standpoint of the church.
The printed copies of the letters
were seized by the Gestapo when

books.
Letters 110 to 158. written from
! January 1932 to 1935, were collected
for the library by its representative
in Europe.
