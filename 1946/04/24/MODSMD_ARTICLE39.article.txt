# Cardinal Nine Face Santa Clarans Today
## 
### 
Stanford's baseball nine travels
today to the Santa Clara diamond
to take on the Broncos in a return*
engagement. In the previous con
test, the Santa Clarans whipped the
Indians, 11 to 4. At press time,
Harry Wolter had not designated
the flinger who will start on the
mound for the locals, but in all
probability it will either be Larry
or Phil Wolle, or maybe Lefty Pali
soul.
The infield combination is set
with Lloyd Merriman at first
base, Bob Peters at second, Jackie
Brownsnn at the shortstop slot,
and Tom Ward at the "hot sack."
To this date, that is the best in
field combination that Harry Wol
ter has been able to put together,
and although not particularly
weak in any spot, "erroritis" does
at times get the best of the boys.
Merriman, who will don pigskin
togs next fall, has been a heavy
clouter, and his fielding, too, has
been satisfactory. In two games,
Brownson has come through with
plays nothing short of sensational.
Two weeks ago, he leaped into the
air to snag a sure hit, and then
doubled a man oft first base. Last
Saturday, he performed the same
feat when he jumped high to
catch the ball. His hitting .too, has
been on the upgrade. (Brownson
will also play football next season.)

The outfield combination consists
of Jim Wickersham, George Sloat,
and Denny Fox. Catching will be
handled by Frank McGraw.
Santa Clara's record this sea
son has been spotted with suc
cess and defeat. They have beat
the Cal team, and also were beat
en by the Blue and Gold boys in
a return game. St. Marv's has
fallen victim to tbe Broncos, too.
as well as a number of other
teams in the Bay Area.
Dave Mariani, who played on
the basketball team against Stan
ford, is one of the heavy hitters of
the team. Another man potent with
the bat is Grenfell, who collected
two hits, when he previously faced
Farm hurlers.

TER: Coach Harry Wolters is an
ex-major leaguer, but had to give
up active playing when he injured
his leg. . . . Ray Harrmiett, who is
serving as Wolters' assistant, is also
listed on the books as an assistant
football coach, too. . . . Stanford
moves over to Berkeley this Satur
day, to meet the Cal team in the
first of four conference tilts. . . .
The Bears defeated the U.C.L.A.
Bruins last week. . . . Tom Phelps,

Phelps, who made basketball his

Stanford's baseball nine travels
today to the Santa Clara diamond
to take on the Broncos in a return*
engagement. In the previous con
test, the Santa Clarans whipped the
Indians, 11 to 4. At press time,
Harry Wolter had not designated
the flinger who will start on the
mound for the locals, but in all
probability it will either be Larry
or Phil Wolle, or maybe Lefty Pali
soul.
The infield combination is set
with Lloyd Merriman at first
base, Bob Peters at second, Jackie
Brownsnn at the shortstop slot,
and Tom Ward at the "hot sack."
To this date, that is the best in
field combination that Harry Wol
ter has been able to put together,
and although not particularly
weak in any spot, "erroritis" does
at times get the best of the boys.
Merriman, who will don pigskin
togs next fall, has been a heavy
clouter, and his fielding, too, has
been satisfactory. In two games,
Brownson has come through with
plays nothing short of sensational.
Two weeks ago, he leaped into the
air to snag a sure hit, and then
doubled a man oft first base. Last
Saturday, he performed the same
feat when he jumped high to
catch the ball. His hitting .too, has
been on the upgrade. (Brownson
will also play football next season.)
