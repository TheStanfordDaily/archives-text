# Stanford Football Machine Goes Through Spring Drills
## 
### RAY PASCOE 
Amid "blood, sweat, and tears,"
80 perspiring aspirants for the post
war model of the Big Red grid ma
chine have been laboring for two
weeks of the six-week spring loot
ball practice. Under the watchful
eye of Coach Marchie Schwartz all
the boys have been really going
through ihe paces.
Stress for the most part has
been placed on fundamentals such
as tackling, blocking, dummy
practice, and punt and pass drills.
Mixed in with this reducing op
eration have been the signals and
plays that must be mastered first.
Many, carrying a wee bit too
much weight around the belt line,
will find the former drills much
to their advantage in whipping
themselves into proper shape.
The first scrimmage has been set
for the latter part of the week with
various other mixes scheduled for

later on in the practice. Plans have
been made for a scrimmage and
barbecue to wind up the campaign
on Alumni Day when the boys will
perform under the scrutiny of ex-
Stanfordites.
Coach Schwartz lias lined up a
fine coaching staff to help him in
his work. Working jvith Schwartz
on the backs is Pete Kmetovic of
ex-Stanford fame, who is partic
ularly aiding the difficult man
iu-motion tryouts. Another for
mer Stanford gridder. Hay Ham
med, is helping out with the
quarterbacks, the key man in the
model "T" attack.
Line coaches are headed by Phil
Bengtson, chief man of the group.
Vic Lindskog will work with the
centers and ends while Chuck Tay
lor takes care of the guards. Tack
les are ably driven under the reins
of Ed Stamm. Though not on the
staff. Bob Mastin, former Red end,
has been lending his talents to the
practice.
Coach Schwartz finds himself
not without veteran material.
Returning to the fold are former
tackles on the 1!)42 squad Jim
Cox and Fred Boensch. Both
were on the first eleven before
joining the armed services. Also
back are triple threat Billy Ag
ncw, transferring from Cal, and
Frank Forbes, quarterback.
Some of last year's veterans are

1 also on hand. Gene Martin, sensa
tional first-year man, is bucking for
! the fullback slot along with Agnew.
! Speedster Don Lipelt is back at
1 half. Harry Davison, behemoth
tackle, and Jim Fry, though mo
mentarily sidelined with the pes
tiferous poison oak, are back at
tackle and guard respectively. Dave
DeSwarte, end, is out for track but
i will be available come season time.
"Red" Knight, a prospective first
i rate quarter, is also trying his hand
in practice.
By all indications as of today,
it looks as if the Stanford Indian
will be ready to roll come the
season's opener September 2X
against the Idaho Vandals.
