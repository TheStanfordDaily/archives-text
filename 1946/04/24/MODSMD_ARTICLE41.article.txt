# Swimming Record Looks Best Here
## 
### 
Undefeated in all previous out
ings, the Stanford swim team repre
sents the kingpin of the Cardinals'
return to intercollegiate warfare.
Faring the best of all athletic squads
performing to date, the Red aquatic
squad is undoubtedly one of the
strongest college teams in the na
tion.
Squashing the Olympic Club,
U.S.C.. and U.C.L.A. in methodical
rhythm, Coach Tom Haynie's nun
face only California on the con
ference dual slate.
If the Redmen safely tuck away
this encounter in their belts, which
winning they should handily accom
plish, they will be undisputed Con
ference champs. On May 4 the
Bears will trek here for a match
that no one should want to miss,
because the boys really plan to
"shoot the works."
Led by the sensational Boh An
derson, who recently has been
playing havoc with the Confer
ence records, the Indians fare well
to finish the season undefeated.
Breaststroker Don Hester also
garnered a new record down
south, with the 400-yard relay
team chalking up another new
mark. Harry Borchers, Jim Arm
strong. Klas 801. Clint Eastman,
Bernie Briskin, Narver, and Sper
ry also add their talent to make a
powerful squad.
Other meets in the offing are
Treasure Island on April 30 on the
home waterways; Olympic Club,
there, on May 3, followed closely
by the Cal meet on the 4th, and the
important All Conference meet at
Berkeley on the 11th. As Coach Tom
Haynie said, "I am certain the Stan
ford boys can break some more Pa
cific Conference records," it would
seem that the swim team is headed
for great success.
