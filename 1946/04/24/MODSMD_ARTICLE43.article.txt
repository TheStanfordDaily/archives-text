Several days ago a letter came to
this department complaining that
swimming, which should win all
honors within reach this season,
will be awarded only Circle S's,
while basketball, which went
through a most dismal season, will
earn Block S's. The writer thinks
that injustice is running loose, and
that something ought to be done
about the situation.
In the first place, "letters" aren't
awarded on a fluctuating basis,
depending on the success of the
sport from season to season. Sec
ondly. the anonymous writer of
the letter is wrong in stating that
it is the fault of the Stanford Ath
letic Council that swimming is not
properly awarded.
The actual student body decides
what sports are to be considered mi
nor, and what sports are to be major
ones. Petitions are presented to Ex
com, which makes the final decision.
Several quarters ago, some backers
of wrestling thought the sport
should be recognized as a minor
sport, so a petition was passed
around, and then was presented to
the Executive Committee. They ap
proved the petition, and now wres
tling is a recognized minor sport at
Stanford.
If there are any backers who
want swimming placed on the ma
jor sports agenda, the above pro
cedure will have to be followed.
The Stanford Athletic Council has
no voice in (he matter, whatso
ever.
But before any action is taken,
sponsors should think twice about
the matter. A Block S is a very
high honor to receive. This honor
shouldn't be lowered in values in
any way. If swimming backers
want their ,sport on the major sport
list, then golf might have a legiti
mate case, too. Or boxing, or fenc
ing.
This writer is of the opinion that
it would be a mistake to put swim
ming on the major sport list. And
it isn't because of any dislike for
the sport. It, in the long run,
would be unfair to the present
major sports, as well as the minor
sports, to jump swimming a notch.
There must be a dividing line
somewhere. Otherwise, a Block S

will lose its meaning. Football, bas
ketball, track and baseball are the
traditional "big" sports. I doubt if
there is a school in the country
which doesn't recognize the above
mentioned as major fields. Tennis is
the fifth sport at Stanford to be con
sidered a major sport.
At some schools, depending on
the locality, the list of major
sports varies. Some schools rec
ognize ice hockey; others put la
crosse on the list. With a cham
pionship team in the oiling, some
might think this writer off-base in
his conclusions, but as mentioned
before, the line lias to be drawn
somewhere.

Pretty soon Bay Meadows closes
up, which will mean a chance to
save a few dollars. Plunking two
bucks across the line continuously
makes the bank account look pretty
punk after a while. . . . And when
the San Mateo pony palace shuts
down, Hollywood, which is located
in Inglewood, will open. . . . And
after that track closes, Del Mar, lo
cated at Del Mar, which is east of
Escondido (as Bing would say,
"Where the turf meets the surf")
opens up.

ketball, track and baseball are the
traditional "big" sports. I doubt if
there is a school in the country
which doesn't recognize the above
mentioned as major fields. Tennis is
the fifth sport at Stanford to be con
sidered a major sport.
At some schools, depending on
the locality, the list of major
sports varies. Some schools rec
ognize ice hockey; others put la
crosse on the list. With a cham
pionship team in the oiling, some
might think this writer off-base in
his conclusions, but as mentioned
before, the line lias to be drawn

Pretty soon Bay Meadows closes

save a few dollars. Plunking two
bucks across the line continuously
makes the bank account look pretty
punk after a while. . . . And when
the San Mateo pony palace shuts
down, Hollywood, which is located

after that track closes, Del Mar, lo

Several days ago a letter came to
this department complaining that
swimming, which should win all
honors within reach this season,
will be awarded only Circle S's,
while basketball, which went
through a most dismal season, will
earn Block S's. The writer thinks
that injustice is running loose, and
that something ought to be done
about the situation.
In the first place, "letters" aren't
awarded on a fluctuating basis,
depending on the success of the
sport from season to season. Sec
ondly. the anonymous writer of
the letter is wrong in stating that
it is the fault of the Stanford Ath
letic Council that swimming is not
properly awarded.
The actual student body decides
what sports are to be considered mi
nor, and what sports are to be major
ones. Petitions are presented to Ex
com, which makes the final decision.
Several quarters ago, some backers
of wrestling thought the sport
should be recognized as a minor
sport, so a petition was passed
around, and then was presented to
the Executive Committee. They ap
proved the petition, and now wres
tling is a recognized minor sport at
Stanford.
If there are any backers who
want swimming placed on the ma
jor sports agenda, the above pro
cedure will have to be followed.
The Stanford Athletic Council has
no voice in (he matter, whatso
ever.
But before any action is taken,
sponsors should think twice about
the matter. A Block S is a very
high honor to receive. This honor
shouldn't be lowered in values in
any way. If swimming backers
want their ,sport on the major sport
list, then golf might have a legiti
mate case, too. Or boxing, or fenc
ing.
This writer is of the opinion that
it would be a mistake to put swim
ming on the major sport list. And
it isn't because of any dislike for
the sport. It, in the long run,
would be unfair to the present
major sports, as well as the minor
sports, to jump swimming a notch.
There must be a dividing line
somewhere. Otherwise, a Block S

will lose its meaning. Football, bas
ketball, track and baseball are the
traditional "big" sports. I doubt if
there is a school in the country
which doesn't recognize the above
mentioned as major fields. Tennis is
