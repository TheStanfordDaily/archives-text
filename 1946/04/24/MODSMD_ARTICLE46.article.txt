### 
NEW YORK, April 23 (UP).â€”A
drama of great baseball courage was
climaxed today in gaudy Ebbets
Field when Dodger pitcher Edward
Marvin Head, who started his ca
reer as a left-hander, pitched a no
hit, no-run game right-handed to
beat the Boston Braves, 5 to 0.
It was a heart-stirring story that
could hardly have happened any
where but in Brooklyn.
He was making his first appear
ance since leaving the Dodgers for
the Army in mid-season of 1944 and
was pitching only a few days after
recovering from a sore arm that
threatened to end his career.
It was the sixth straight Dodger
victory and a 10-hit attack on
pitcher Mort Cooper including a
homer by rookie catcher Ferrell An
derson gave Head more than enough
support to win.
The Cardinals also won their sixth
straight to rtmain tied with Brook
lyn for the lead, coming from be
hind at Cincinnati to win, 3 to 2.
The Cards made two runs in the
eighth on singles by Marty Marion,
Del Rice, and Lou Klein, an error
by second baseman Bobby Adams
and Stan Musial's long fly. Relief
pitcher Ken Burkhart was the win
ner after Bert Haas and Eddie Miller
hit homers off Ted Wilks, the starter.
Claude Passeau of the Cubs
pitched a five-hit, 3 to 1 victory at
Pittsburgh for his first 194t> victory.
Phil Cavarett's double, a sacrifice
by Andy Pafko and an error by
shortstop Bill Cox broke a 1-all tie
in the eighth. Frank Colman's hom
er in the third was the only dam
aging blow off Passeau.
The Phils had two big innings
against the Giants at Philadelphia,
winning 8 to 1.
The Yankees moved into a first
place tie with the Red Sox in the
American by beating the Athletics
at New York, 3 to 0 on A 1 Gettel's
pitching.
A five-hit pitching job by Bill
Dietrich gave the White Sox a 3 to 1
triumph over the Detroit Tigers at
Chicago.
Gerald Priddy's three-run homer
sparked a six-run Washington rally
in the eleventh that gave the Sena
tors an 8 to 2 triumph over the Red
Sox at Boston.
Cleveland at St. Louis was pbst
poned because of rain.
