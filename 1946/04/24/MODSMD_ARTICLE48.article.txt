Intramural baseball continued
rather unsteadily yesterday after
noon, with four games being played,
one default, and one game being
called on account of "darkness."
The Encina Cellar, winners of the
intramural basketball playoffs,
proved they were going to be strong
contenders for the League I baseball
championship by defeating the Phi
Delts 9 to 0. Jim Rose pitched a no
hitter for the Cellar team.
Five Phi IJelt men got on base
through four walks and one er
ror, but there were no hits. Lyle
Smith was the big gun for the
Cellar at hat, getting four hits for
four trips to the plate including
two home runs. Stoddard and Ga
briel. playing shortstop and sec
ond base for the Encina team, did
excellent fielding and accounted
for one double play. In pitching
the no-hitter Rose struck out ten
Phi Delts.

pounded in 12 runs to beat Jefferson
12 to 1. The Phi Psi's defaulted to
Encina IV E.

to play off the remainder of the
game in the near future. Female
Zeta rooters, complete with bright
re'l and yellow balloons, added
much color to the contest.

Beta Theta 1 to 0. Terrific pitching
was the big factor in the Theta vic

basketball fame, passed the word to
League II that they are to be reck
