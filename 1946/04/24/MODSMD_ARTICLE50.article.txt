# No Springs, No Spikes; Africans Leap 8 Feet 3!

PORTLAND, Ore., April 2:s
(I'P). —Leapin' Les Steers, the ex-
Stanford and University of Oregon
high flyer, holder of the world's
high jump record since 15)41, today
pondered his fate since the dis
closure of athletic activities of
the Watussi tribe of darkest
Africa.
Les felt secure after sailing to
six feet, 11 inches because no
one in this country has since come
within a half foot of that mark.
But the Watussi—a race of colored
giants who average seven feet
from l'uazy crown to calloused
toes—were said to consider the
American record a mere warm-up.
And the high-flying Africans—
who might be "lingered" into the
South African Olympic squad
use no spike shoes nor springs to
achieve the phenomenal altitude
of eight feet, three inches.
