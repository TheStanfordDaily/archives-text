CHUNGKING, April 2.'5 (Ul>).
Gen. George C. Marshall's head
quarters announced today lhat First
Lt. Chen of the Chinese Air Force,
and not an American as Chinese
Communists have charged, was fly
ing the plane shot down over Sze
pingkai last Friday.
Marshall's office made public a
report from a tripartite field team
at Mukden which whs instructed to
investigate Communist charges that
American planes are fighting with
Chinese Nationalists against the
Communists in Manchuria.
The report admitted, however,
that a mistake in identity might
easily have been made. Chen was
wearing American flying clothes
and it was possible that his body
was so mangled in the crash that
the clothes were the only means
of identification.
Furthermore, the report pointed
out, many plancc of the Chinese Air
Force still are marked with the
American star and this might have
contributed to the Communist belief
that they were being strafed by
American planes.
Marshall demanded yesterday
that the Communists either prove
or retract their charges that the
plane shot down over Szepingkai
was piloted by an American. Mar
shall's office made plain today that
he was not formally denying the
Communist charge but was pre
senting the facts.
