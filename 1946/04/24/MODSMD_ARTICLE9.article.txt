# Students Conserve Grain; 'Heifers' Drive Needs OK
## 
### 
In response to President Truman's nationwide ap
peal for food conservation, Lagunita women Monday
night volunteered to give up bread with one meal each
day, a move to be effective immediately.
Students in other living groups ar? reportedly con-

suiting their dining room directors
to see what practical and effective
readjustment can be made in their
standard menus to aid the volun
teer drive throughout the United
States.
Unless immediate aid is sent
through the UNRRA, 150,000,000
Europeans will face starvation in
the coming four months, according
to facts presented to the nation by
Herbert Hoover's investigatory com
mittee overseas.
No major United States city has
ignored these facts; newspapers
have carried such suggestions as
the following for cutting down on
fats and wheat products:
1. Ask for or eat but one slice of
bread at each meal. Use dark bread
in preference to white.
2. Do not cat bread and potatoes
at the same meal. One medium
sized potato contains the same val
ues as one slice of white bread.
3. If at one meal you are obliged
to eat more than the normal or nec
essary complement of grain prod
ucts, cut down at the next meal.
4. Cut out dry cereals as much as
possible. Substitute oatmeal.
5. Eliminate butter, substituting
honey and peanut butter for
spreads.
6. Use salad oils sparingly.
7. Cut out fried foods.
These same newspapers have
stressed that "this is voluntary ra
tioning." Whatever conservation is
undertaken, then, must be spon
sored by individual citizens.

' Heifers for Relief "—proposal by Stanford stu
dents to conduct a campus drive for money to buy
cattle for shipment to famine-stricken Europe—re
ceived a tentative go-ahead signal yesterday when
Drives Committee announced that it would recom-

mend to Excom tonight that an
emergency drive start Monday. Fi
nal decision rests with the Execu
tive Committee.
Approval of Drives Committee
cainc after discussion of the com
mittee's policy set up in rccent
years to hold only three large
drives annually—the War Fund,
Red Cross, and Con Ilomc drives.
This, however, is an emergency
situation and should he consid
ered as such. Drives Committee
Chairman Merle Bcuttcl said.
Committee members heard yes
terday the proposal of students rep
resenting the World Students' Serv
ice Fund to combine with "Heifers
for Relief" in an all-campus drive.
The W.S.S.F., however, has al
ready received a contribution
from this year's War Fund, and
Drives Committee felt that the
Heifers drive would fulfill the
more immediate need.
If approved by Excom tonight,
the Stanford "Heifers for Relief"
drive will be part of a national
movement now being conducted by
church and civic welfare groups to
send cattle to Europe and later to
Asia, to be distributed in co-opera
tion with UNTCRA.
Craig Vittatoe and Al Strain,
representing the Stanford group,
stated that the national commit
tee expects to have shipped 10,000
rows to Europe by July and that
one cow will save the lives of ten
children.
Twenty Stanford students, mean
while, have volunteered to care for
the cattle being shipped and to lielp
in the distribution this summer.
