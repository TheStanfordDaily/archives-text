# First Night Audience Praises 'Arms and the Man' Production
## 
### 
Ha) Campbell deserves ;ill con
gratulations for the highly com
mendable production of George
Bernard Shaw's "Arms and the
Man," presented last night before
a very appreciative first-night au
dience.
The impressively fine perform
ance of Ted Marcu.se, as "The Choc
olate Soldier," showed a profession
al sense of timing and humor.

. Throughout the play Marcuse dom
i mated the scene, mid his fine acting
i technique enabled him to render
the maximum entertainment.
Walt/man Is Heroine
Elaine Walt/man, cast as Raina,
played Shaw's heroine with charm
and warmth. Personally, we would
like very much to sec more of Miss
Walt/man's acting.
j The good entertainment which
marked the course of the play was
I particularly well carried out by Mrl
; fillet, as the dashing Leyius, and by
Mary Cogswell, as the servant girl,
i Luke. Eliot makes a very impres
sive figure on the stage, and his fine
j voice 'will be especially remem-
I bered.
i Parents Good Characters
Despite a tendency to over-act,
Roberta Mattingly and Morris
Jones, as Paina's parents, supplied
the necessary characterizations of
persons of wealth and position. As
the play progressed, Miss Matting
ly's performance gained the lack of
feeling she exhibited in the first act.
Norman Varnardo and William
j Varnardo and William Melt-on coin
i pleted the competent cast.
i Setting Impressive
The set, also designed by Mr.
I Campbell, made an impressive sct
i itng for the highly enjoyable and

, last-moving play. With an able di
j rector and a good east, Shaw's
subtle philosophizing is excellently
| covered by an irresistible and ob
vious humor.
I This production of «>no of "The
I Beard's" plays is certainly a "must"
jof (he Stanford drama season if
| you have a ticket.
The unit set with a blue cyclo
• ramie background is so designed
i that the three scenes of the comedy
—b?droom, garden, and library—
j can bo presented without a change
other than in lighting.
First Student Producer
| This play marks the first time
| that, one student has been in charge
jof all ends of production. And
| judging from tonight's performance,
! this step has proven to bo a wise
one.
"Arms and the Man" will contin
ue to run at the Little Theater
until April 150. The curtain goes up
at 8:15. Only tickets available now
would be those turned in between
j now and Monday.
The costumes, which were also
: designed by Mr. Campbell, cap
tured with complete success the
colorful dress of the period in which
the play was laid. All in all, this
play is another feather in the cap
of the Stanford Players.—Cam Ry

j now and Monday.

Ha) Campbell deserves ;ill con
gratulations for the highly com
mendable production of George
Bernard Shaw's "Arms and the
Man," presented last night before
a very appreciative first-night au
dience.
The impressively fine perform
ance of Ted Marcu.se, as "The Choc
olate Soldier," showed a profession
al sense of timing and humor.

. Throughout the play Marcuse dom
i mated the scene, mid his fine acting
i technique enabled him to render
the maximum entertainment.
Walt/man Is Heroine
Elaine Walt/man, cast as Raina,
played Shaw's heroine with charm
and warmth. Personally, we would
like very much to sec more of Miss
Walt/man's acting.
j The good entertainment which
marked the course of the play was
I particularly well carried out by Mrl
; fillet, as the dashing Leyius, and by
Mary Cogswell, as the servant girl,
i Luke. Eliot makes a very impres
sive figure on the stage, and his fine
j voice 'will be especially remem-
I bered.
i Parents Good Characters
Despite a tendency to over-act,
Roberta Mattingly and Morris
Jones, as Paina's parents, supplied
the necessary characterizations of
persons of wealth and position. As
the play progressed, Miss Matting
ly's performance gained the lack of
feeling she exhibited in the first act.
Norman Varnardo and William
j Varnardo and William Melt-on coin
i pleted the competent cast.
i Setting Impressive
The set, also designed by Mr.
I Campbell, made an impressive sct
i itng for the highly enjoyable and

, last-moving play. With an able di
j rector and a good east, Shaw's
subtle philosophizing is excellently
| covered by an irresistible and ob
vious humor.
I This production of «>no of "The
I Beard's" plays is certainly a "must"
jof (he Stanford drama season if
| you have a ticket.
The unit set with a blue cyclo
• ramie background is so designed
i that the three scenes of the comedy
—b?droom, garden, and library—
j can bo presented without a change
other than in lighting.
First Student Producer
| This play marks the first time
| that, one student has been in charge
jof all ends of production. And
| judging from tonight's performance,
! this step has proven to bo a wise
one.
