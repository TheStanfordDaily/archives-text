## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 24 (IT).
â€”Senate foes of the British loan
accused the Administration of
playing Santa Clans to the world
today, and Mississippi's Theodore
G. Bilho urged that the $3,750,000
he used instead for honus pay
ments to discharged American
veterans.
Bilho and Sen. Robert A. Taft,
It., ()., opened the attack on the
controversial loan hill, on which
Senate sentiment appeared almost
evenly divided.
Taft said the loan was a long
step toward economic disaster for
the United States. He proposed
as a substitute an outright gift of
$1,250,000,000 to Britain.
