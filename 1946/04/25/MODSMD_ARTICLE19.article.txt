LONDON. April 24 (UP).—An un
cxplodcd "dud" bomb of 2,200 pounds
began ticking ominously in St. James
Park less than 300 yards from Buck
ingham Palace tonight, and bomb
disposal experts said il. might explode
at any time.
The German bomb, buried 50 feet
below St. James duckpond, began to
tick when Royal Engineers started
to hoist it to the surface for disposal.
It was believed the motion set ofT the
fuse which had remained dormant,
for five years.
Royal Engineers said the bomb
would be highly dangerous for the
next 24 hours. If it docs not go oft
within that time, they said, they
would deliberately detonate it Friday
to feet rid of its menace.
Nearby also are Marlborough
House and St. James Palace, but ex
perts said the explosion probably
would do no more than shatter win
dows there and at the palace because
of the depth at which it is embedded.
Queen Mary, Princess Alice, and
Earl of Athlonc returned to Marl
borough House- which also is less
than 200 yards from the bomb—to
nighl from Windsor Castle, where
they spent the Easter holidays. King
George VI, Queen Elizabeth, and (lie
Princesses Elizabeth and Rose were
believed still to be at Windsor,
Officials advised Quetwi Mary of
the danger at once, but she decided
to remain in her residence for the
time being.
