The MAM is screaming loudly at Mr.
Bowles; full page ads appear in newspapers;
everyone makes speeches and writes letters
to his congressman, and reads news stories
or 'he current fight over the continuation of
the OPA with little regard to the larger,
over-all js"ues, except as they may affect next
month's rent or the price of meat.
Ti.e fact remains, though, no matter what
our sand on the OPA, that the true measure
of price inflation in the United Slates since
l r i' I much greater than the rise of 35 per
cent shown by the official figures on the cost
of living, mainly because of the enormous in
creases in the guantity of money, the ur
gency of demand, and in wage costs.
Despite claims of the NAM, further gains in
production, supposedly the result of lifting

of price control, cannot be relied upon to
prevent inflation. Such gains will make more
goods available to civilians,'but they will
also bring increases in income and spending
power this according to a University of
Chicago Round Table discussion of April 7.
Penetrating deeper through the political
maneuverings and "vested interests" of fac
tions now fighting in Congress, practical
economists have seen that it is necessary to
go beyond the symptoms and to attack the
basic factors influencing inflation.
On this theory, then, we agree with ths
Round Table economists.
The exact survival time of the OPA is not
so important, but there is the real danger that
continuation of price control by the OPA will
be regarded as a substitute for dealing with
the very basic causes of inflation.â€”H.D.
