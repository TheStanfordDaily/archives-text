The gardener who moves the sprinkler on the

lawn in front of the library every morning got a
new watch for his birthday.
If you could possibly stop and ask him the time
of day as you pass by the library, we're sure he
would be glad to tell you and at the same time it.
would create more unity among the members of
our community.

You think that you have trouble. What about
(lie fellow who didn't get to go skiing last week
end, because he had to go down to Carmel for
three days? It was the first weekend that he hadn't
been up to Yosemite since November.
What's even worse, he may have to go to the
beach again this weekend. We were wondering if
his professors couldn't excuse him from classes on
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of next week
so that he can get up to the snow again. And he's
a veteran, too.
