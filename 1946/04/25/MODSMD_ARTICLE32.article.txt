# THE 						STANFORD STORY

ON 'I fIK TAKINM OF YOUII TIME
C ,11 supports this hopeful in foisting another
column on the Stanford Daily public. You are al
ready covered and/or smothered on the world in
general and the facts of life of a springtime campus
in particular. To the bleary morning eye there
should b. a good reason for placing (he Stanford
Story between it and the cup of black-without
creem.
There is.
Today f'jw members of the largest Stanford
; tudrnt body in history know the difference be
tween David Starr Jordan and Doodles Weaver, or
the detailed story of these two Stanford extremes.
The wartime student body was cut off from the
normal activity and appreciation of Stanford life.
Many newcomers have had no previous ties with
Stanford. The current student body has the du
bious distinction of knowing the least about Stan
lord of any group in the school's history.
The road to Mayfield— Ben Eastman —the plug
uvly the New Zealand All-Blacks — Cedro — the
"Spanish" arch it "dure- the Frenchman's Castle—
"r.■ t-'.s-to-riches" the Lamson case- the personality
of Dr. Jordan—these and many others are segments
of the Stanford Story.
In one sense they are nothing more than good,
human interest n n ws stories which will sell be
cause the people who read them live in the settings
where they happened. In another sense they will
build an appreciation of the education this insti
tution offers.
There will be no attempt in this column to preach

about tradition, and no comment on current cam
pus news. The Stanford Story can sell itself on a
straight story basis. It is unique and human. It
will pay back whatever interest is invested in it.
No one person can reconstruct 50 years or the
highlights thereof from a limited amount of re
search time and a shelf of reminiscent "histories."
For that reason the guest-columnist principle will
be used as freely as the interest generated among
the readers allows.
Any Stanford stories on anv subject from any
source are wanted. Some will he incorporated
in the general column, others run as separate
features. Address the Stanford St,ory, care of (he
Stanford Daily. Questions about the school will
be welcome.
This idea has been developed many times in
(he Daily's history. It usually lasts as long as the
columnist's enthusiasm or the degree of need for it
on campus.
Today it is more important than ever before
that the Stanford Story get across. For that reason
il is more important that you, the contributor, send
in your favorite yarn about Stanford. You can be
sure of an audience who will read your contribu
tion with little previous knowledge of the subject.
The Stanford Story may not occupy (he same
place in your heart as the Iranian crisis or the
seething internal politics of the June Allyson Fan
Club. (Subtle plug for us by us.) But to rest from
the turbulence of the world of Iran and June, you
are invited to recall the stories behind your Uni
versity twice weekly.
