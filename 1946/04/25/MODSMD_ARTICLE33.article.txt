### BILL STEIF 
We sort of wish that Gen. Joseph T. McNarney,
commanding all American forces in Europe, and
El.-Gen. Lucius D. Clay, deputy military governor
of the United States occupation zone, would get to
■ < tlx r on their statements to Ihe press.
Yesterday McNarney ordered his subordinates
to restore the "deteriorated"' discipline of Ameri
can soldiers. lie enumerated nine reasons which
have led "to loss of .espect for American author
ities" in Europe. Amongst these reasons were an
epidemic of black market activities, drunkenness,
a high A WOE rate, and disrespect for constituted
authority.
This has happened primarily because of the col
lapse of what the General calls "unit pride" and
because of "rapid demobilization and frequent
change of station of units and assignments."
Meanwhile, Clay has praised Gl's in Germany
as "America's best salesmen of democracy." He
stated yesterday that "our major contribution to
the re-education of Ihe German people has been
the presence of our soldiers." He added, "1
think they have brought home democracy down
Ihe streets of Germany."
Now the reason we wish the (wo generals would
set together is precisely because we think they
were sayin" (he same thing riot contradictory
tilings at all in their different and individually
American manners.
We suspect that, while (he activities which have
"deteriorated" American discipline should not be
condoned, they are pretty typically American. We

think they illustrate, together with the individual
American's often impetuous generosity and fool
hardiness, ihe individual American's initiative and
love of gaiety. We think that disrespect for consti
tuted authority, up to the point of irrational mob
action anyway, is a quite healthy symptom and
we think that this very freedom of action, thought,
and spcech which American Gl's have demon
strated— despite the Army's objections —is why
Gl's are "America's best salesmen of democracy."
Certainly American soldiers have gone off the
deep end any number of times. But there have
been plenty of people right here at home who
have done the same thing and it does not make
ns think any less of most Americans individually
or the American people as an abstraction. Actu
ally, what our men in the occunation seem to
have done is to have transplanted a goodly hunk
of the U.S.A. to Europe—with most of the U.S.A.'s
virtues and defects.
We think that's fine. We're like William Ran
dolph Ilearst in one respect anyway: we're pretty
hoi for the U.S.A., too.

Speaking of a goodly hunk of the U.S.A., we
note thai the manager of a San Francisco theater
and six reels of a certain motion picture have been
incarcerated on police charges that the certain film
is "ofliensive to decency." Judging from the sailor
filled crowd that we saw in front of that theater
the day before yesterday, the film must be a real
curiosity. We suggest a showing on the Sunday
Series.
