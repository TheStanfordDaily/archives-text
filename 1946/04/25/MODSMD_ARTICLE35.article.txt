intensive tour of Mexico. It is
seht duled to get under way August
17 when an expected group of 40
students leaves the San Francisco
airport for the first stop in Mexico
at Guadalajara.

A three-day stay at this city will
include a side trip to Tlaqueptque to
view the famed pottery made there.
The group will then move on to
Mexico City for the first of two
visits. Visits to Chapultepec Park
and Castle as well as the "Floating
Gardens" of Xochimileo will be in
cluded during the five-day stay.
Stops will be made at Fortin,
Vera Cruz, Oexaca, Pueola, Taxco,
and Cuernavaca before the group
returns to Mexico City. The climax
of the tour will come on September

"We are arranging' this trip as
an educational tour to provide stu
dents with a broader background
and to let them see for themselves
some of the things they have been
reading about. We want them to
meet the Mexican people personal
ly and get a first hand view of Mex
ican culture. It is also a real op
portunity for the student to put his
Spanish to practical use," states Mr.
Rael.
