# AVC Favors Continuation Of OPA to Stop Inflation
## 
### 
The Stanford chapter of the American Veterans Committee last night
voted unanimously in favor of continuing the Office of Price Administra
tion without amendment.
The action came after Dr. Theodore J. Kreps had told the veterans that
"after the last war we lost the fight against inflation; I hope you all join
in lo win this one." *

Will Send Telegram
After the discussion led by Dr.
Kreps, the membership voted with
out dissent to send to Senators Bill
Knowland (R., Cal.) and Sheridan
Downey (D., Cal.) the following
telegram:
"We, the members of the Stan
ford chapter of the AVC, strongly
urge renewal of the OPA as is
with full powers te thoroughly
control the present inflation dan
ger, and with an adequate budget
to carry out its powers, as recom
mended by OPA Director Paul
Porter."
In answering questions from the
Iloor, Dr. Kreps pointed out that
production has always gone down
during periods of inflation. Re cited
the 1920 inflation in the United
States, the German inflation at the
same time, and experiences in other
countries.
Production Increased
"Production always occurs durinc
periods of stable prices," he said.
"Today there are three million
more men in civilian production
than there were in war and civilian
production combined a year ago."
Dr. Kreps lashed out at the Na
tional Association of Manufacturers
and other groups which have called
for the end of OPA.
"If the young men of today want
to suffer needlessly, all they have to
do is listen to the N.A.M.," he s; id.
Amendments Kill Control
The amendments passed by the
House of Representatives to the
present OPA bill were described by
Dr. Kreps as designed to do away
with price control.
"They have a new technique
now," he explained. "They know
the public is all-out behind OPA,
so they try to cripple it with
amendments.
"If they are unsuccessful in that,
they will then try to cripple the
agency by cutting its appropria
tions."
The AVC last niyht also discussed
at length its proposed constitution,
but postponed action until the next
meeting because of lack of time for
debating the document. Other ac
tion, including the report of the
committee on eating facilities, was
also postponed.
