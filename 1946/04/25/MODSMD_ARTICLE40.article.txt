# Trackmen Face Winged 'O' At Angell Field Saturday
## 
### 
Stanford's track team plays host
to the San Francisco Olympic Club,
Modesto Junior College, San Mateo
Junior College, and Sacramento
Junior College on Angell Field Sat
urday afternoon. The meet will be
triangular with the junior colleges
combining forces.
In the Olympic Club, Stanford
comes against one of the best track
aggregations in the country. Last
week the Winged-0 trounced Cal
7(i'/2 to 54' •>, and they are now
wragling for a dual meet with the
potential national champs, U.S.C.
Ironic Feature
An ironic feature of this Satur
day's meet will be three ex-Stan
ford greats, Johnny Fulton, Mushy

Girard, and Pete Zagar, running
against the Farm for the Winged-O.
The inexperienced San Mateo
track team didn't show much in
their previous meeting with the Big
Red, and not much improvement is
expected. The same cannot be said
for Modesto and Sacramento. In
the April 7 meet with Cal, the two
J.C.'s turned in some very good
times, distances, and heights and it
is expected they have gotten better
since ihen.
Modesto a Threat
Modesto seems to be the strong

jest. They have a man who can pole
vault 12 feet 6 inches. Men who can
throw the discus 137 feet, the jav
| elin 185 feet, and put the shot 45
feet. This should make it tough for
J anybody else who intends to take
these events.
Marshall of Modesto, a good dis-
I tance man, wiil be running against
j real competition Saturday in Gi
rard of the Winged-O and Ganahl
iof Stanford. With these three en
tered, the mile run should be one
I of the closest events of the day.
Sncto Team Good
Sacramento will field a well-bal
anced team. Schopp should toss the
| shot 46 feet, two men on Sacra
mento can pole vault 12 feet, and
Lytjen can run the 880 in <2:01.5.
All this adds up to the fact that
the Farm boys will have to be on
their toes next Saturday in order
to garner their share of the points,
j If they manage to do that, the fin
| ishing order should be — Olympic
i Club first, Stanford second, and the
I combined J.C.'s a close third.

Red, and not much improvement is
expected. The same cannot be said
for Modesto and Sacramento. In
the April 7 meet with Cal, the two
J.C.'s turned in some very good
times, distances, and heights and it
is expected they have gotten better
since ihen.
Modesto a Threat
Modesto seems to be the strong

jest. They have a man who can pole
vault 12 feet 6 inches. Men who can
throw the discus 137 feet, the jav
| elin 185 feet, and put the shot 45
feet. This should make it tough for
J anybody else who intends to take
these events.
Marshall of Modesto, a good dis-
I tance man, wiil be running against
j real competition Saturday in Gi
rard of the Winged-O and Ganahl
iof Stanford. With these three en
tered, the mile run should be one
I of the closest events of the day.
Sncto Team Good
Sacramento will field a well-bal
anced team. Schopp should toss the
| shot 46 feet, two men on Sacra
mento can pole vault 12 feet, and
Lytjen can run the 880 in <2:01.5.
All this adds up to the fact that
the Farm boys will have to be on
their toes next Saturday in order
to garner their share of the points,
j If they manage to do that, the fin
| ishing order should be — Olympic
i Club first, Stanford second, and the
I combined J.C.'s a close third.


MUSHY GIRAItD . . . Former
Stanford track star who will com
pete for the Olympic Cluh this
Saturday against his school.
Stanford's track team plays host
to the San Francisco Olympic Club,
Modesto Junior College, San Mateo
Junior College, and Sacramento
Junior College on Angell Field Sat
urday afternoon. The meet will be
triangular with the junior colleges
combining forces.
In the Olympic Club, Stanford
comes against one of the best track
aggregations in the country. Last
week the Winged-0 trounced Cal
7(i'/2 to 54' •>, and they are now
wragling for a dual meet with the
potential national champs, U.S.C.
Ironic Feature
An ironic feature of this Satur
day's meet will be three ex-Stan
ford greats, Johnny Fulton, Mushy

Girard, and Pete Zagar, running
against the Farm for the Winged-O.
The inexperienced San Mateo
track team didn't show much in
their previous meeting with the Big
Red, and not much improvement is
expected. The same cannot be said
for Modesto and Sacramento. In
