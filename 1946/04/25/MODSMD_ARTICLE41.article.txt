# Yankees in Lead As Boston Boos
## 
### 
NEW YORK, April 24 (UP).—Red
Sox outfielder Ted Williams was
booed for hitting into three double
plays and Joe Di'Maggio of the Yan
kees failed to get a hit in six times
at bat today, but while they fiddled
their team mates burned the base
paths in a slugging bee which New
York won, 12 to 5.
The victory put the Yankees into
first place, breaking the deadlock be
tween the teams which existed before
today's game at Boston.
It was the first "crucial" series of
the year between two of the teams
which are expectd to battle for the
American League pennant and the
Yankees were not found wanting,
Aside from their vaunted slugger,
DiMaggio, and last year's leading
American League hitter, George
Stirnweiss, the rest of the lineup
spanked the ball to all corners. They
went hitless but the other Yankees
made 15 hits off four Red Sox pitch
ers, teeing off first on Cecil (Tex)
Hughson, ace of the staff.
The crowd of 31.393 singled out
Williams for their jeers when he
came to the plate in the ninth in
ning. He responded by hitting into
his third double play. Aaron Robin
son and Nick Etten each batted in
three Yankee runs to give rookie
Randy Gumpert his first victory.
However, the youngster needed four
innings of relief help from Clarence
(Cuddles) Marshall, another Yankee
rookie. Rudy York hit a Boston
nomer.
