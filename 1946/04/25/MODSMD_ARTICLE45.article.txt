Turning the calendar ahead by a
month, the Big Meet in track will
be held at Angell Field, and not in
the stadium, as had been previously
j rumored.
Considered one of the finest cin
derpath layouts in the country, the
only fault in the Angell Field track
J is the seating accommodations. The
bleachers only hold about 2,500
i spectators, and the anticipated at
tendance for the meet with the Ber- '
keley Blue and Golders is expected
to reach at least 7,500. A problem,
j to say the least, is on hand.
For years there has been pressure
on the school to erect adequate
track facilities, but the pleas were
always thrown down the drain with i
the remark that no available cash
was on hand to go through with (he I
contemplated plans.
Now, with athletics out for three
years, hopes for a new track plant
have to be shoved into the back
ground still farther. . . . That is,
! unless one of you makes a "kill
; ing" at Bay Meadows and would
like to contribute $50,000 to Stan
: lord for the construction of a track.

| If the San Francisco Chronicle is
really interested in finding out
j about the baseball situation in Mex
ico, they ought to send their horse
i hide coiTespondent down to Baja
j California to witness a few prep
! school contests.
Several years ago, this writer
j happened to see a game between
Ensenadas High and Tijuana (An
glo-Saxon version of Tia Juana)
High for the county championship.
: Everybody turned out to the ball
park in full regalia: Mexican gen
erals with all their ribbons and dec
j orations, women with their brightly
colored dresses, and boys wtih ten-
I gallon sombreros.
The two teams were most ca
pable. The score was 2 to 1 in favor
i of the home team, Tijuana, going
into, the first half of the ninth. The
first man up hit a grounder down
j the third base line, but the fielder
fumbled the ball, and the batter was
j safe on an error. The next man up
i let the count ride to three balls and
I no strikes; on the next pitch lam
i basted the ball out to left field, ,

scoring the man on first.
This play was particularly dis- I
liked by some boisterous female fan <
for Tijuana, and as the man crossed |
the home plate for the tying run
she yelled down to him, "Ah, your
father smuggles jewelry across the
border!"
After that comment, the ump had
to call off the game because of "cir
cumstances beyond his control."

| $100,000 lawsuit Jorge Pasquel had
cooked up against Vernon Stephens
for leaving his "south of the bor
der" league to return to the St.
Louis Browns?
UNSUNG HERO DEPARTMENT: ,
! The present football squad quietly j
going through their spring training j
sessions. Maybe Marchie Schwartz !
is teaching the boys some "we'll get j
to the Rose Bowl if we can run off |
these plays successfully" tactics.
Turning the calendar ahead by a
month, the Big Meet in track will
be held at Angell Field, and not in
the stadium, as had been previously
j rumored.
Considered one of the finest cin
derpath layouts in the country, the
only fault in the Angell Field track
J is the seating accommodations. The
bleachers only hold about 2,500
i spectators, and the anticipated at
tendance for the meet with the Ber- '
keley Blue and Golders is expected
to reach at least 7,500. A problem,
j to say the least, is on hand.
For years there has been pressure
on the school to erect adequate
track facilities, but the pleas were
always thrown down the drain with i
the remark that no available cash
was on hand to go through with (he I
contemplated plans.
Now, with athletics out for three
years, hopes for a new track plant
have to be shoved into the back
ground still farther. . . . That is,
! unless one of you makes a "kill
; ing" at Bay Meadows and would
like to contribute $50,000 to Stan
: lord for the construction of a track.

| If the San Francisco Chronicle is
really interested in finding out
j about the baseball situation in Mex
ico, they ought to send their horse
i hide coiTespondent down to Baja
j California to witness a few prep
! school contests.
Several years ago, this writer
j happened to see a game between
Ensenadas High and Tijuana (An
glo-Saxon version of Tia Juana)
High for the county championship.
: Everybody turned out to the ball
park in full regalia: Mexican gen
erals with all their ribbons and dec
j orations, women with their brightly
colored dresses, and boys wtih ten-
I gallon sombreros.
The two teams were most ca
pable. The score was 2 to 1 in favor
i of the home team, Tijuana, going
into, the first half of the ninth. The
first man up hit a grounder down
j the third base line, but the fielder
fumbled the ball, and the batter was
j safe on an error. The next man up
i let the count ride to three balls and
I no strikes; on the next pitch lam
i basted the ball out to left field, ,

scoring the man on first.
This play was particularly dis- I
liked by some boisterous female fan <
for Tijuana, and as the man crossed |
the home plate for the tying run
she yelled down to him, "Ah, your
father smuggles jewelry across the
border!"
After that comment, the ump had
to call off the game because of "cir
cumstances beyond his control."
