### 
Intramural baseball will continue
its third round this afternoon at 4:30
on Fields I and II. Stellar game of
the afternoon in League I will match
the Sigma Nu and the strong Chi
Psi teams on Field II. This game is
a toss-up, and should turn into a
real contest.
In League II a tight-pitching Beta
team takes on the slugging Encina
1W The edge must go to the
Betas in this one.
In other League I games the
strong Encina Cellar team should
have little trouble with the Phi
Psi's. Jefferson and Phi Delt are
matched in the other contest. They
will both be trying to break into
the win column for the first time
in round three.
Zeta Psi, which showed surpris
ing strength against the Encina
boys Tuesday, will take on Harri-
son Hall and Buchanan will take
on A.T.O. in the other League II
games for tomorrow. The Harrison
boys will really have to push if
they expect to make it a contest
with the stong Zetes.
After bowing to the strong Legal
Eagles Tuesday, the A.T.O.'s will be
back to break into the win column
iat the expense of Buchanan. Le
gal Eagles, favorites to win League
II, draw a bye in today's games.
