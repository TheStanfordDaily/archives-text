# 'Not Sad' At Practice --Schwartz
## 
### 
"I'm not sad, but I'm not elated,"
said Head Football Coach Marchie
Schwartz at the conclusion of a sur
prise two-hour scrimmage yester
day. He further told his charges
that he knew there were certain
difficulties, conflicting schedules,
labs, and heavy study lists. "But, it'
you want to, you can settle down,
here and now, and we will have a
surprise for a few people come next
fall." â€¢
Wayne Erikson, a Sioux City
scooter, showed up very well at the
Left Half spot. Fred Willey, from
last year's two game squad and
Mike Titus, a newcomer alternated
at the other half position. At full
back, Gene Martin, another hold
over from last year showed promise.
Frankie Forbes and Cleo "Red"
Knight alternated at the crucial
quarterback spot. Knight's spot
passing looked especially good for
this early in the season.
In the line, John Clark's power
ful downfield blocks from the guard
spot and Harry Varner's smashing
tackle play looked like the beginning
of a finfe line. Jim Cox, switched
from tackle to center, proved that
he could play either position equally
as well. Ed Culin, Dave DeSwarte,
and Sid Smith were working the
end position. Bob Tyler gave a lot
of defensive trouble from this spot.
Harry Ferris, Bob Berryman, and
Ted Burke gave hope that the tackle
spots would be well filled come next
fall.
Don Zappetini, left half on the '42
Varsity was a spectator at yester
day's melee. Although still in a
Navy uniform, he indicated that he
expected to be back and in a foot
ball uniform next fall.
