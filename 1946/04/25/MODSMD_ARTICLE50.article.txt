CLEVELAND. April 24 (UP).(—
A nationwide rail strike beginning
May 18 appeared likely today as del
egates of two rail unions met to j
I consider recommendations made by !
| a presidential fact-finding board in '
the railroad wage dispute.
| General chairmen of the two un- '<
ions—the Brotherhoods of Locomo
tive Engineers and Railroad Train
! men — met in secret session and
were reported in an angry mood at
the board's recommendations for a !
I 1(5 cents an hour wage increase and
few working rule changes.
The brotherhoods had demand
ed wage increases ol 25 per cent
and 45 rule changes. A spokes
man indicated that while the un
ions might be amenable to the 16
per cent wage raise, they vigor
ously opposed the few rule
changes allowed by the hoard.
'I he operators contend that the i
union's demands would necessi
tate rate increases.
The findings of the board are not
binding on either the brotherhoods
:or the 'oads.
Presidents A. F. Whitney and
Alvanley Johnston of the two
brotherhoods are to hold a final
conference Monday with the op
erators in Chicago, but they have
indicated little can be expected
from the meeting in view of the
board's recommendations.
A spokesman for the brother
hoods said the general chairmen of i
both unions will meet in joint ses
! sion again tomorrow for a final de
\ eision on a possible nationwide
strike but that no announcement
! would be forthcoming until the 175 j
j delegates had reached an agree- ]
ment.
