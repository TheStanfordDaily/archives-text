CHICAGO. April 24 (UP). —The
executive board of the CIO United
Automobile Workers' Union today
authorized a strike against the
Chrysler Motor Corporation, one of
the auto industry's Big Three, if the
company "arbitrarily discharges em
ployees reaching the age of 65."

as soon as thev reach (>5.
The union now has a contract with
the company containing a clause that
