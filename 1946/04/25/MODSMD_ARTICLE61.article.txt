## 
### 
Men from Encina, Roosevelt, Van
Buren, Arthur, Washington, Bu
chanan, and Fillmore halls will be
guests of Ventura tomorrow after
noon and evening from 5 to 11:30
p.m. at a lawn party and dance.
For the first time since last fall
when the ''Home of Junior Trans
fers'" first made its debut on the
Stanford campus, Ventura's barbe
cue pit and spacious lawns will
again come into use.
According to Ann Pasley, chair
man of the event, softball, volley
ball, croquet, food, and dancing will
be in order for the occasion. The
empty pavements and the lawns in
front of deserted Sequoia may also
be used for the affair.
