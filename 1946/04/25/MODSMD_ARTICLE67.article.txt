TACOMA, Wash., April 24
(Ul*). —A three-day tour of
hedge-hopping from tree-tops to
house roofs ended today for a lit
tle brown monkey which escaped
from a carnival cage Sunday.
After fruitless aUcmpts by po
lice and householders to capture
the escapee the owner threw it
a banana.
The monk was removed from a
tree—peacefully asleep.
The banana contained two
sleeping tablets.
