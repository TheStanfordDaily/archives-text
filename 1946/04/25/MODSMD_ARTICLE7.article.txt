Margery Bailey, associate profes
sor of English, will speak to the
Stanford Philological Society on
"Shakespeare and the Courtly Love
Tradition" today at 4:15 p.m. in
the lower lounge of the Women's
Clubhouse.
"The courtly love tradition great
ly afreets the attitude of characters
in both the comedies and tragedies
of Shakespeare," stated Miss Bailey.
"The acceptance of the code by
women, in particular, has much to
do with the motives for action in
several of the tragedies, which
makes it necessary for the modern
actress to study the subject thor
oughly in preparing performances
of Lady Anne, Ophelia, Desdcmona,
and other Shakespearean tragedies,"
she added.
Students, friends, and members
of the Society are invited to at
tend.
