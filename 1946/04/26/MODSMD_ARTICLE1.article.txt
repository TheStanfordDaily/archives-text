Then the council would be in po
sition at any time, Stcttinius urged,
to decide whether, as Poland, Rus
sia, France and Mexico allege, Gen
eralissimo Francisco Franco's gov
ernment is a threat to world peace.
But Russian chief delegate An

tinuance of "the same old story—
insufficient evidence for action"
and of "the unhappy and bank
rupt methods of the past."
