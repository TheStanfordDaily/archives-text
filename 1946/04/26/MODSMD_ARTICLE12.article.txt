# Signups for Music Council Piano Due
## 
### 
The Stanford Music Council has i
announced that a piano is available I
for any students needing it for prac
tice purposes. Those wishing to |
avail themselves of this facility are j
asked to mail a card to Peggy Brad- ,
ford, box 1367 stating how many j
hours weekly they wish to practice. !
Though a list was prepared Inst
quarter, the turnover of students j
has made it necessary to compile I
another. Therefore, all those who j
signed this list last quarter are !
asked to sign up again if they wish
to use the piano.
It has been stressed that a com- j
plete list must be compiled before I
a room for the piano can be made
available.
