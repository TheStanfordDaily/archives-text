# Housing Condition Desperate! AVC Poll Favors Co-op Plan
## 
### 
Just how desperate some married Stanford students are for housing
was evidenced yesterday by the returns from AVC's poll. Of the 127
ballots returned by 4 p.m., 118 of them were filled out by students ex
pressly in need of improved housing, or any housing at all, for their fam
ilies.
Two pitiful facts stand uppermost in this sampling of Stanford's hous-

*"ing nicd. There arc 32 children of
| Stanford men who arc not ade-
I quatcly housed or cannot be with
i their dads. The number of student
j families broken apart by lack of
j housing is 25.
NEED HOUSING NOW
! Forty-one families need better
housing immediately. Among the
reasons listed:
"We have a baby due in autumn.
My wife is alone all day and iso
lated from doctors, people, or trans
portation. Cramped . . . sharing
two-room apartment with another
i couple. . . ."
". . . living in a trailer with two
] children . . . too far from campus."
". . . living in an attic room with
out bath or toilet, facilities. . . ."
MAY HAVE TO LEAVE
. . will have to leave Stanford
unless I can find a place here for
my wife to stay with me. Cannot
afford to pay for two places on $00
a month."
". . . our rent is far too high."
". . . now living in a tourist cabin
without hot water or bath . . . baby
coming soon."
". . . house being sold from over
us. We live in a basement."
"We have a room with kitchcn
privileges, but we have to share the
bathroom with four other people,
all women."
"Wo arc sick of eating out in res-
I taurants . . ."
j "... not even room to study in
i our room."
". . . being evicted next month."
Most othci 4 remarks given were
I similar .o these.
CO-OPERATIVE HOUSING
Overwhelming approval of a co
! operative student housing project,
lin the event that Dibble plans
j should fail to materialize, was given
1 by the sample. Only three persons
; indicated they would want no part
oi such a project, while 17 per cent
were undecided.

ballots returned by 4 p.m., 118 of them were filled out by students ex
pressly in need of improved housing, or any housing at all, for their fam
ilies.
Two pitiful facts stand uppermost in this sampling of Stanford's hous-

*"ing nicd. There arc 32 children of
| Stanford men who arc not ade-
I quatcly housed or cannot be with
i their dads. The number of student
j families broken apart by lack of
j housing is 25.
NEED HOUSING NOW
! Forty-one families need better
housing immediately. Among the
reasons listed:
"We have a baby due in autumn.
My wife is alone all day and iso
lated from doctors, people, or trans
portation. Cramped . . . sharing
two-room apartment with another
i couple. . . ."
". . . living in a trailer with two
] children . . . too far from campus."
". . . living in an attic room with
out bath or toilet, facilities. . . ."
MAY HAVE TO LEAVE
. . will have to leave Stanford
unless I can find a place here for
my wife to stay with me. Cannot
afford to pay for two places on $00
a month."
". . . our rent is far too high."
". . . now living in a tourist cabin
without hot water or bath . . . baby
coming soon."
". . . house being sold from over
us. We live in a basement."
"We have a room with kitchcn
privileges, but we have to share the
bathroom with four other people,
all women."
"Wo arc sick of eating out in res-
I taurants . . ."
j "... not even room to study in
i our room."
". . . being evicted next month."
Most othci 4 remarks given were
I similar .o these.
CO-OPERATIVE HOUSING
Overwhelming approval of a co
! operative student housing project,
lin the event that Dibble plans
j should fail to materialize, was given
1 by the sample. Only three persons
; indicated they would want no part
oi such a project, while 17 per cent
were undecided.
