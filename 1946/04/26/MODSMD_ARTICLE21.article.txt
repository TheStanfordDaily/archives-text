# Married Veterans Have Their Say

### 
From the results of the poll sponsored yes
terday by the AVC, we can get a meager but
helpful slant on what Stanford married vet
erans are planning and hoping for in terms
of housing.
Although the poll was answered by only
l r /J students, those students are the ones
most vitally concerned with the problem and
the ones bearing the brunt of the shortage in
th's area.
It proved that there is a sizeable group of
married couples who will get their first real
brf !i the plans to utilize Dibble General

Hospital go through . . . that they will get
relief from living in at best cramped, inade
quate one-room apartments, many of which
are without decent plumbing facilities and
are far from the campus.

It also proved that in case of a tie-up, these
students would be willing to support a co
operative housing project, a suggestion that
ought to bt) kept in mind as a practical alter
native.
Anyhow, the poll was a good idea. . . .
ask the married veteran. Let's hope it clears
the way for results.
