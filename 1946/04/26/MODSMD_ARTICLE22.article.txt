# Hike to the Hills
## 
### 
Not that it's been definitely ascertained
that we're allergic to texts of a Saturday after
but we admit to leanings that way.
That's why (this allergy might be catching)
we merely ask you to note that an informal
tradition which is unique to Stanford will be
scried again tomorrow afternoon.
Anybody at all, from the freshman who's
] jttuce-green around the edges to a hoary,

embittered senior, can become one of the
gang who will meet at Frenchman's Bridge
at 1:30 for a Foothills Hike with President
Tresidder. We think you'll like heading for
the hills and bull-sessioning it with Dr. T.
Laura Supple, chairman of the hikes, prom
ises apples and oranges for those that fade
along the way. Come to think of it, we've
talked us into it. See ya?
