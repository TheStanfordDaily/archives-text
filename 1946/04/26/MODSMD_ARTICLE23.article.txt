# BULL SESSION

### H.D. THOREAU 
1! the gii ls at Russell House don't lodge a pro
t i with the San Francisco police department for
the hitter's closing down of "The Outlaw," then
they don't know the meaning of the word loyalty.
.lu(l{iii'4 from the number of people who pro
tested t «■ exhibiting of "The Outlaw" because of
y: nothing unseemly they saw ill it, there must
have been a terrific queue for that firsl-and-only
showing.
And those rumors that "The Outlaw" was going
to play on the Sunday Evening Movie Series next,
month are pure fabrication. The Auditorium isn't
I;,ire enough.

Apparently there's a die-hard on the Daily who
wen't accept the decision forbidding sororities on
campus.
Quoting from yesterday's intramural softball
j;rticle: "Buchanan dropped a close one to Beta
Theta, 1 to 0. Terrific pitching was the big factor
in the Tlieta victory."
Lust quarter an intramural basketball reporter
iii.si jt -il on calling Phi Delta Tlieta the "Thetas."
To set the record straight, neither Beta Theta nor
Phi Delta Theta is to be confused with Kappa Al
pha Tlieta, usually known as the Thetas. They in
turn are not to be confused with Kappa Alpha or
Ail Brandin.
Actually Beta Theta and Phi Delta Theta are

not sororities at all. They arc national palmistry
societies.

Also, the abbreviated name for Zeta Psi is not
Zeta as stated in the same article. Their nickname
is the "Psi's."
Several old grads of athletic distinction have
been gracing these hallowed grounds during the
past few days.
Ernie Nevers, all-time All-American fullback,
was out viewing the present gridders in their first
scrimmage Wednesday afternoon.
On adjacent Angell Field "Dink" Tcmplcton,
coach of national championship track teams on
the Farm in the twenties and thirties and now
coach of the Olympic Club, was out giving a few
pointers to Al Ilershey, Card weightman class of
'38 or thereabouts and now putting the shot and
throwing the discus for the Los Angeles Athletic
CI n h.
Jim Reynolds, student body president in '35 as
well as being conference shot put champ, was an
interested observer since he is now the organizer
and co-coach of the L.A.A.C. team.
Down in the discus ring Pete Zagar, Mayfield
squire, was squirting the platter into (lie tall grass.
He will exhibit his prowess here Saturday for th?
Olympic Club against his old alma mater. .
Pete, it will be remembered, was a most-per
suasive head sponsor in Encina back in '39 when
many of your fathers were there.
