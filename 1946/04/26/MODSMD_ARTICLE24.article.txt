# WHO TOLD YOU?

My roommate wanted to take his girl to the
movies last night but after we saw the latest "Life"
magazine we were afraid to stay in the room alone.
Did you see first article on the "shocking dis
integration" of our armed forces?
One picture showed over a thousand bombers
standing idle at Kingman Field, And another,
horor of horrors: Under the picture of two lieu
tenants bending against an airplane propeller,
is the caption: "Officers turn their own propel
lers."
You just wait till Col. McCormick and Wm, R.
Hearst hear that stuff like that is going on. Then
we'll see action.
Seriously we are unable to follow whatever
logic the "Life" editors may think that they are
presenting. It would seem to us that these planes
were built to win the war. Must we maintain a
large army just to man equipment that is now
extra?
Or does "Life" propose that we continue to
maintain nn army as large we had two years
. K.? Do they think that an army of that size is
needed? On page 31 of their opus they show the

appalling picture of an undermanned 105 crew.
Yet on page 34 we are told that 36 of the new 4.5
rockts are equal to 72 battalions of 105's.
To maintain the army to (it the equipment is
sheer stupidity. The only question left is, arc we
going to maintain the large army for the sake of
having a large army? Why "Life" masks the
question can only be answered by the fact that
it appears to be their usual style.
Rather than come light out and pump for a
large army they seek to convince the reader by
roundabout methods. They do not meet the issue
of a large army head on, because they know that
that is too controversial an issue to meet head on.
Well, they sure scared the living daylights out
of us. Not only did we shiver through a sleepless
night but tomorrow we are going to put up a spe
cial booth on Engineering corner. We are going to
have a big sign painted: RE-ENLIST HERE.
We'll show those "Life" editors that we are
going to do something about this "shocking" affair.
Did you hear that. Mike? You used to be an ex
air force man. 13y gosh, we're not going to let you
go to.school and hash for us while all those nice
bombers have to sit all alone down at Kingman.

Or does "Life" propose that we continue to
maintain nn army as large we had two years
. K.? Do they think that an army of that size is
needed? On page 31 of their opus they show the

appalling picture of an undermanned 105 crew.
Yet on page 34 we are told that 36 of the new 4.5
rockts are equal to 72 battalions of 105's.
To maintain the army to (it the equipment is
sheer stupidity. The only question left is, arc we
going to maintain the large army for the sake of
having a large army? Why "Life" masks the
question can only be answered by the fact that
it appears to be their usual style.
Rather than come light out and pump for a
large army they seek to convince the reader by
roundabout methods. They do not meet the issue
of a large army head on, because they know that
that is too controversial an issue to meet head on.
Well, they sure scared the living daylights out
of us. Not only did we shiver through a sleepless
night but tomorrow we are going to put up a spe
cial booth on Engineering corner. We are going to
have a big sign painted: RE-ENLIST HERE.
We'll show those "Life" editors that we are
going to do something about this "shocking" affair.
Did you hear that. Mike? You used to be an ex
air force man. 13y gosh, we're not going to let you
go to.school and hash for us while all those nice
bombers have to sit all alone down at Kingman.
My roommate wanted to take his girl to the
movies last night but after we saw the latest "Life"
magazine we were afraid to stay in the room alone.
Did you see first article on the "shocking dis
integration" of our armed forces?
One picture showed over a thousand bombers
standing idle at Kingman Field, And another,
horor of horrors: Under the picture of two lieu
tenants bending against an airplane propeller,
is the caption: "Officers turn their own propel
lers."
You just wait till Col. McCormick and Wm, R.
Hearst hear that stuff like that is going on. Then
we'll see action.
Seriously we are unable to follow whatever
logic the "Life" editors may think that they are
presenting. It would seem to us that these planes
were built to win the war. Must we maintain a
large army just to man equipment that is now
extra?
