How fair are accident trials?

How just is the law?
Stanford students will have a
chance to find out tonight when
the Supreme Court of the State of
Stanford holds its third hearing of
the quarter. Students have the op
portunity to check how reasonable
the arguments of both sides are,
and to gain an insight into the
points of law involved.
The case concerns Mr. Curtis,
who bought a tiuck from a con
tractor, who was driving it when
the truck's axle broke, hitting Cur
tis. Curtis suffered a broken back,
and his pregnant wife, who saw the
accident from her porch, had a mis
] carriage.
Curtis and his wife sued the man-
I ufacturers of the truck and of the
i axle, claiming injuries amounting
j to $24,000.
Attorneys (and second-year law
| students) Frank Mallory and James
, Baker will plead for the Curtfses,
j while the companies are represent
ed by Harold Schnack and Fran
j cis MacDowell .
Judges Osborne, Davis, and Telles
! will be laced with the problems of
| what constitutes reasonable care,
i and how much responsibility the
! manufacturer has. The law says
! thai both axle and truck builders

are negligent, but are they liable?

When hearings open at 7:30 p.m.
in room 100 on Quad tonight, the
legal minds will have to strike a
balance. Obviously, no company
can guarantee 100 per cent per
fection; similarly, the buyer cannot
expect a perfect product. Yet the
company sells and the buyer ac
cepts each item in the mutual good
faith that it is not one of the im
perfect ones.
These are the problems which
second-year legal eagles will pon
der this evening in this third of a
series of five moot courts, designed
to give law students necessary prac
tice in thinking on their feet. Nor
man Baldwin heads the Moot Court
Board and is largely responsible for
the organization of these trials.
