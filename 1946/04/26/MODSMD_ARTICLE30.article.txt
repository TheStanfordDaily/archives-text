of the strongest track aggregations
in the country. Paced by Tom

mile relay team, Mushy Girard.
powerful distance runner, and
Pete Zagar, the well-known dis
cus man, and N.C.A.A. champ in
I 'XV.).
If the Winged-0 club men are at
their best tomorrow, they may cap
ture as many as 13 firsts. They are
especially strong in the hurdles and
field events. Moore runs the highs
in 15.6 and the lows in 25.1.
Lind of the Olympic Club can
broad jump over 21 feet. Irving
Moore pole vaults the creditable
height of 13 feet and G inches. Like
wise in the discus, javelin, and shot
put, where the Winged-O men have
distances much superior to anything
Stanford has shown thus far.
Fulton and Girard of the Olym
pic Club will make i( hard for
Stanford to place in the dashes
and distances. I'ulton runs the
220 in 22.3 and the lit) in a swift
45.!(. Girard was clocked last week
at 1:3(1.S for the mile run. With
Ganahl running against him to

ter (o win.
Stanford's George Grimes and
Lehman for the Olympic Club will
really square off in the 880. To date
both of their times are very simi
lar, around 1:58, The two-mile looks
like another event for Olympic
Club. Coughlin for the club runs it
in 10:19.
The Winged-0 relay team runs
the mile in about 3:27. This is al
most 5 seconds better than 'Stan
ford's best time and even a little
better than the J.C.'s, providing
they haven't gotten any new talent
since their last meet.
All (his adds up to a pretty dark
picture for Stanford, unless Coach
Jack Weiershauser really pulls
something out of (he hat tomor
row. One thing sure, il will be
a good preparation for the Farm
lads for their first I'.C.C. meet

since 1943 next Saturday in Los
Angeles against the highly touted
U.S.C. squad.
Tomorrow the Olympic Club
should finish first with upwards of
80 points, Stanford second, and the
