## Errors Lose For Sigma Nu 
### 
With errors a dime a dozen, the
Chi Psi's turned back the Sigma
Nu's yesterday afternoon in a
League I game. The Sigma No
team lost its game in the last in
ning when they let in six Chi Psi
runs, most of them on errors. Fi
nal score was 15-11 for the Chi
Psi'?.
Pitching hitless ball, Buchanan
hurler Ned Wolforth led his team
mates to a 16-1 victory over a weak
A.T.O. team in a League II game.
The only A.T.O. run to cross the
plate came out on an error. The
A.T.O.'s couldn't even touch Wol
forth, who struck out 15 men.
Another fine pitching perform
ance, also in League 11, was turned
in by Clint Jones as his Harrison
teammates coasted to a 6-1 upset
over Zeta Psi. Jones allowed only
one hit, a homer which brought in
the only Zete run of the game.
Othe other League II game was
forfeited when Encina 1W failed to
show up for their scheduled game
with the Betas.
