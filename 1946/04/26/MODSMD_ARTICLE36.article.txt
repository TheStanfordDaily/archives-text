# Strong Stanford Golf Team Entertains St. Mary's Gaels
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity golf team, fresh
from a 23-4 victory over the San i
Jose Slate Spartans last week, will
entertain the Gaels of St. Mary's
tomorrow morning on the Stanford !
golf course.
The first four men on (he Card I
team will be Frank McCann, Tom
Lauibie. Jack Schuler, and Bob
Cardinal. Coach Eddie Twiggs
has not yet decided on the other
two positions. Bob liosburg has
returned to the team and will
probably be number five man.
Either Don Jones or Gordon Dot
zour will occupy the other posi
tion for the Farm.
Last week the team came up to :
all expectations. Two of the four ,
Spartan points were taken by Eli ;
Bariteau, new Northern California |
junior champion, and the other two
on a tie in the doubles. In the rest
of the matches, the Indian golfers .
made a clean sweep.
Stanford's linksmen should have
little trouble with St. Mary's to
morrow. St. Mary's has previous
ly met San Jose State, last week's
victims of the Card squad. At that
time the Gaels were badly defeat
ed by the Spartans. If this is any
indication of their strength, they
will be easy pickin's for the
Farm boys.
At the time of the San Jose State
match, however, St. Mary's was
without the services of their num
ber one man, All-American Herman
Wedemeyer who was playing base
ball against the Berkeley outfit. If

Wedemeyer is unable to play to
morrow, St. Mary's will have a
tough day of it.
As for the Stanford team, it seems
every bit as strong as was forecast,
Frank McCann is number one man.
His best score this season is a 68 on
Ihe St mford course two weeks ago.
In last week's match McCann shot a
73 against Bariteau.
Tom Lambie is close behind Mc-
Cann for top honors. Lambie shot
a 70 near the beginning of the quar
ter and won easily over Elmer An
derson last week. Jack Schuler and
Bob Cardinal are other standouts on
the team.
Bob Rosburg's return should
provide added strength to the
Cards. Rosburg was twice a run
ner up in the California State
championships. After tomorrow's
match, Stanford moves on to play
UCLA and USC next week in a
real test of Coach Twiggs' confi
dence in his team's ability to take
the conference championship.

Wedemeyer is unable to play to
morrow, St. Mary's will have a
tough day of it.
As for the Stanford team, it seems
every bit as strong as was forecast,
Frank McCann is number one man.
His best score this season is a 68 on
Ihe St mford course two weeks ago.
In last week's match McCann shot a
73 against Bariteau.
Tom Lambie is close behind Mc-
Cann for top honors. Lambie shot
a 70 near the beginning of the quar
ter and won easily over Elmer An
derson last week. Jack Schuler and
Bob Cardinal are other standouts on
the team.
Bob Rosburg's return should
provide added strength to the
Cards. Rosburg was twice a run
ner up in the California State
championships. After tomorrow's
match, Stanford moves on to play
UCLA and USC next week in a
real test of Coach Twiggs' confi
dence in his team's ability to take
the conference championship.
Stanford's varsity golf team, fresh
from a 23-4 victory over the San i
Jose Slate Spartans last week, will
entertain the Gaels of St. Mary's
tomorrow morning on the Stanford !
golf course.
The first four men on (he Card I
team will be Frank McCann, Tom
Lauibie. Jack Schuler, and Bob
Cardinal. Coach Eddie Twiggs
has not yet decided on the other
two positions. Bob liosburg has
returned to the team and will
probably be number five man.
Either Don Jones or Gordon Dot
zour will occupy the other posi
tion for the Farm.
Last week the team came up to :
all expectations. Two of the four ,
Spartan points were taken by Eli ;
Bariteau, new Northern California |
junior champion, and the other two
on a tie in the doubles. In the rest
of the matches, the Indian golfers .
made a clean sweep.
Stanford's linksmen should have
little trouble with St. Mary's to
morrow. St. Mary's has previous
ly met San Jose State, last week's
victims of the Card squad. At that
time the Gaels were badly defeat
ed by the Spartans. If this is any
indication of their strength, they
will be easy pickin's for the
Farm boys.
At the time of the San Jose State
match, however, St. Mary's was
without the services of their num
ber one man, All-American Herman
Wedemeyer who was playing base
ball against the Berkeley outfit. If

Wedemeyer is unable to play to
morrow, St. Mary's will have a
tough day of it.
