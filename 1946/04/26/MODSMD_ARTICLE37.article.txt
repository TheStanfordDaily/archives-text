# Varsity To Play Bears at Berkeley
## Stanford Rated Even Chance to Beat Bear Baseball Nine in Diamond Fray 
### 
Stanford diamondeers trek to
Berkeley tomorrow afternoon to
meet California in the first four
C.1.8.A. baseball contests. This
game marks the first league encoun
ter for Harry Wolters' nine since
spring vacation, when four games
were dropped ir. Los Angeles to SC
and UCLA.
Coming out on the top end of a
12 to 7 score against Santa Clara
on Wednesday, the Cardinals are
rated a 50-50 chance against tha
Blue and Gold in their first go.
Cal's rccord rates about equal
with that of Stanford's this year,
both teams dropping a little more
than half of their frays.
Strictly from paper computations,
the Berkeley horsehiders figure as
slight underdogs. We whipped St.
Mary's in the first outing of the sea
son, and the Moragans have downed
Cal a number of times since.
Cal's record against Santa ClaiTi is
about even; so is ours. UCLA lost
a game, however, to the Cal institu
tioners, while they took us two
straight on the Joe E. Brown field
in Los Angeles.
Hurling assignment goes to Phil
Wolf, who has carried most of the
heavy work on the mound for Stan
ford this season. Behind plate
will he Frank McGraw.
The infield combination con
sists of Lloyd Merriman at first,
Hob Peters at second base, "Buck"
Brownson at short, and Tom Ward
on third base. All four men arc
good clouters, but it is their field
ing that brings the percentage
down. If their ball-handling can
be settled down a little in the
fracas Saturday, victory looms as
a strong possibility.
The outer gardens will be pa
troled by George Sloat, Denny Fox,
and Carl Wickersham.
For the Berkeley boys, the two
Brown boys, Jim and Bill, will be at
second and first respectively. Glenn
Dufour holds down the short patch
position. To round out the infield.
El Clow plays the "hot corner sack."
The outfield trio is made up of
Lyle Palmer, John Fiscalini, and
Loyal Tracy. Also available for

outfield duty are Bob Hogeboom,
the basketball player, as well as
Andrew Wolfe, also of casaba
vintage.
Starting pitcher for the Bears will
be either Larner or Gustafson. Dick
Saukko will catch.
The game will be played on Ed
wards Field in Berkeley, and game
time is set for 3:15.
