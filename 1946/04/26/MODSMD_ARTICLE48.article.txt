# Bailey Discusses Courtly Love Idea
## 
### 
None of Shakespeares "real men"
followed the courtly love tradition,
but he used the idea with extreme
canniness in his portrayals of a
few of his younger characters, said
Margery Bailey in her talk on
"Shakespeare and the Courtly Love
Tradition" before the Philological
Society yesterday.
The"Court of Love" idea origi
nated in India, and the concept of
swooning, yearning in agony for a
beloved, and dying for her was
passed on to Persia. The cult be
came so strong there that the
government exiled it, and the
cult's followers spread the tradi
tion throughout southern Europe.
By Shakespeare's time no one
thought of courtly love as a code;
it was just a part of good manners.
Shakespeare utilized this idea in
"Romeo and Juliet," when Romeo
quickly forgot about his love for
Rosaline in his love for Juliet. This,
believes Miss Bailey, does not mean
that Romeo was fickle, but that he
had been following the Court of
Love tradition in his admiration of
Rosaline and that he was growing
up in his quieter and more sincere
love for Juliet.
In order for actresses successfully
to portray Shakespeare's tragedies
it is necessary for them to under
stand this Court of Love concept,
added Miss Bailey.
