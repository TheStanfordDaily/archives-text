# Retiring Dean Anticipates Travel, Visiting Friends
## 
### MARY ELLEN AYRES 
Miss Mary Yost, who has always
felt the lure of "something inter
esting around the corner," is today
looking toward a new and challeng
ing corner with her retirement as
Dean of Women at Stanford.
Filled with enthusiasm, Miss Yost
is looking forward to travel, ex
ploring more thoroughly her inter
est in Californiana, and gardening
at her 676 Alvarado Street home
when she completes her 25th year
as a member of the Stanford ad
ministration this summer.
"I hope to start East around the
first of August," said the soft-spo
ken Dean. "First to Denver, then
to Boston and New York, visiting
friends en route." Then, with a
twinkle in her eye. she continued,
"And I plan to spend Christmas on
Chesapeake Bay."
Miss Yost plans to return to her
home in January where "the back
and the front doors will always be
open to Stanford friends." When
asked if she had considered mak
ing her home in her native Virginia,
Miss Yost replied smilingly, "When
one has lived as wholeheartedly as
I have at Stanford, it is hard to
think of breaking away."
Not content with immediate
' plans, Miss Yost also hopes to visit
South America —"if my garden isn't
I too attractive"—and attend the cen
tennial celebrations planned for the
near future throughout California,
j "Californiana has not only been an
I interesting field," she said enthu
; siastically, "but it has been the
i means of knowing and talking to
people I would have met only su
perficially but for this common in
terest."
Miss Yost termed herself an "ad
! venturous amateur" in Californiana.
j "If something looks interesting to
me," she said, "I explore in that
J direction for a while."
Adventuiip has set the tempo for
her. Her original decision to come
1 to Stanford in 1921 was a spirited

interest in the new thing around
the corner.
"When I first received the tele
gram from Dr. Wilbur inviting me
to come to Stanford," said Miss
Yost, ''my mother said, 'Tell him
no . . . I don't want you in that
earthquake country.' But my fa
ther said, 'It sounds like an adven
ture' . . . and I came to California."

j "Californiana has not only been an
I interesting field," she said enthu
; siastically, "but it has been the
i means of knowing and talking to
people I would have met only su
perficially but for this common in
terest."
Miss Yost termed herself an "ad

me," she said, "I explore in that
J direction for a while."
Adventuiip has set the tempo for
her. Her original decision to come

interest in the new thing around
the corner.
"When I first received the tele
gram from Dr. Wilbur inviting me
to come to Stanford," said Miss
Yost, ''my mother said, 'Tell him
no . . . I don't want you in that
earthquake country.' But my fa
ther said, 'It sounds like an adven
ture' . . . and I came to California."
Miss Mary Yost, who has always
felt the lure of "something inter
esting around the corner," is today
looking toward a new and challeng
ing corner with her retirement as
Dean of Women at Stanford.
Filled with enthusiasm, Miss Yost
is looking forward to travel, ex
ploring more thoroughly her inter
est in Californiana, and gardening
at her 676 Alvarado Street home
when she completes her 25th year
as a member of the Stanford ad
ministration this summer.
"I hope to start East around the
first of August," said the soft-spo
ken Dean. "First to Denver, then
to Boston and New York, visiting
friends en route." Then, with a
twinkle in her eye. she continued,
"And I plan to spend Christmas on
Chesapeake Bay."
Miss Yost plans to return to her
home in January where "the back
and the front doors will always be
open to Stanford friends." When
asked if she had considered mak
ing her home in her native Virginia,
Miss Yost replied smilingly, "When
one has lived as wholeheartedly as
I have at Stanford, it is hard to
think of breaking away."
Not content with immediate
' plans, Miss Yost also hopes to visit
South America —"if my garden isn't
I too attractive"—and attend the cen
tennial celebrations planned for the
near future throughout California,
