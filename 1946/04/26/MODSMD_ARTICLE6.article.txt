General chairmen of two rail
brotherhoods, representing 300.-
((00 railroad workers, voted unani

torily in the meantime.
In a boisterous joint session of the
two unions—the Brotherhoods of
Locomotive Engineers and Railroad
Trainmen —the 175 general chair
men backed up their presidents' de
mands that the strike be callcd si
multaneously on some 300 railroads
the afternoon of May 18.
President A. F. Whitney of the
Trainmen snid that "unless we comc
back from Monday's meeting with
the carriers in Chicago with a sat
isfactory settlement, the strike will
not be callcd off."
He said that all trains, with the
exception of milk and troop
trains, would be brought lo a stop
when the strike starts.
Whitney refused to say whether
the trains would be operated if the
government took over the railroads.
The brotherhoods had demanded
a 25 per cnt wage increase and 45

man recommended a wage raise of
1C cents an hour and only a few of
the rules changes.
In a joint statement, Whitney
and President Alvanley Johnston
of the engineers scored the rec
ommendations of the board,
claiming it showed "lack of cour
age'' and a warped concept of
achieving equality" in its findings.
