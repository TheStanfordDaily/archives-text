## 
### JOHN JULIUS 
Subsistence payments to student veterans are backlogged mostly be
cause of lack of office space, General Omar Nelson Bradley, Administrator
of Veterans' Affairs, said in an interview in San Francisco yesterday.
On an inspection tour of Veterans' facilities on the West Coast, the
former commander of the American Twelfth Army Group explained some

of the problems facing' the Veterans' +
Administration today.
SCHOOLS' EXPANSION
"In addition to lack of oHice (
space," he said, "payments to
students are behind because of
the rapid expansion of the schools, ;
and because some students carry I
their applications around in their
pockets for weeks."
Commenting on the suggestion 1
that the Veterans' Administration
open its own schools and colleges to j
take the load off existing over- ;
crowded institutions, General Brad- j
ley said, "We do not believe it
sound to establish Veterans' Ad- ,
ministration schools. We would
rather sec the colleges expand their ;
plants and split their faculties to j
take care of the veterans."
STANFORD—'NAME' SCHOOL
"A 'name' school such as Stanford i
will mean more to a veteran several
years from now than a Veterans' j
Administration school diploma." |
The most serious problems fac
ing veterans today arc jobs and
bousing, General Bradley de
clared. Neither of these arc the
direct problem of the Veterans' j
Administration, although it usu- !
ally gets the blame.
"The schools themselves will have i
to solve tlvir housing problems,"
Gneral Bradley said after being
asked about student housing short
ages in schools such as Stanford.
