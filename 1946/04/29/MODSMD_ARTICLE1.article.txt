# FOR RENT: KITCHEN WITH ROOM PRIVILEGES
## 
### 
Indicative of (lit- problems facing married veterans attending Stan
furd is the situation in which Dan Fadenrecht and his wife Betty found
themselves. Dan, who was an Air Force administrative officer during the
war, had been unable to find any place to live except the kitchen and
maid's quarters of the 'lhela Xi house.
Dan did his first-year law studying in the butler's pantry of the fra
ternity house where he is shown (above) with his desk pushed against
(lie sink. Dan, a University of California graduate in I!M2, will finish
his law course in two more years. In the meantime Hetty is working
for the San Mateo County Welfare Department.
Before Dan found another place to live last week be said that "living
here iis we are has no advantages over a house or apartment. It is better
than having a single room, though, because we have a little more space."
A married couple is also occupying the kitchen and maid's quarters of
the Zete house, while another couple occupies the small house in back
of the Deke house.

In spite of the fact that they bad to buy a house instead of renting I
one as they would have liked to do, Dick and Betty Lawrence have
overcome their housing troubles with a comfortable two-bedroom house '
on College Avenue.
With a large garden, porch furniture, and a nice-sized house (pic
tured above), the Lawrence's have almost an ideal set-up. Betty's one
complaint is that they bad to buy the house. "We were living in a hnr- j
rible hole before we got this," she said. "We had lo buy it before we
got it at all"
Both Dick and his wife are still attending school. Dick is now a
sophomore and Betty, the former Betty Lou Terry, has two more quar-
J ters before graduation. Like many of the returned veterans, Dick is
a mechanical engineering student.
During the war, Dick was an Army Air Corps fighter pilot, lie left
Stanford to enter the Air Corps in December of 1 !M2. Both of the
Lawrences hail from Los Angeles and have no immediate plans except
to finish school.

Another housing problem that is temporarily solved is that of Nat
and Mary Lou Robbins. After their marriage a short time ago, the
Kohbins were able to rent a small house at Wagon Wheels which has
ended their worries for a while. Living across the road from the Kob
bins arc A.S.S.U. President Bob Kennedy and his wife Kcnc.
Nat, who was an ensign in the Naval Air Corps after he left Stanford
in I'm. has almost three years of his engineering training left ahead of
him. In the meantime Mary Lou, the former "Twink" Davies, who
graduated in the School of Political Science last year, is keeping house
for him in their small home.
Pictured above is Mary Lou glancing through one of the old Quads
in the Kohbins' house at Wagon Wheels. More fortunate than their
friends who have been unable to lind a place to live, Marv Lou said,
"We know several couples who are very anxious to return to Stanford
and can't because there aren't enough housing units."

Looking ahead toward the solving of the married veterans' housing
problems, pictured above are 41 housing units being built in Menlo Park
by a Menlo Park contractor. The new housing units, located on small
lots, are situated on the road to Menlo Park which goes past the Stanford
golf course.
A great influx of building is expected around the Palo Alto area as
soon as priorities are lifted in Washington. The Menlo Park units, which
have been under way for some while, will be completed in another two
months.
Other suggestions to relieve the housing congestion are to convert
Stanford-owned Interdale School into housing units and to place mar
ried veterans in facilities at Dibble when it is released by the Army.
Main problems confronting the University in the conversion of Inter
dale include trouble with the water system there and overhauling of the
plumbing facilities. (Photography work for the series was done by Phil
Welch.)

a mechanical engineering student.
During the war, Dick was an Army Air Corps fighter pilot, lie left
Stanford to enter the Air Corps in December of 1 !M2. Both of the
Lawrences hail from Los Angeles and have no immediate plans except
to finish school.

Another housing problem that is temporarily solved is that of Nat
and Mary Lou Robbins. After their marriage a short time ago, the
Kohbins were able to rent a small house at Wagon Wheels which has
ended their worries for a while. Living across the road from the Kob
bins arc A.S.S.U. President Bob Kennedy and his wife Kcnc.
Nat, who was an ensign in the Naval Air Corps after he left Stanford
in I'm. has almost three years of his engineering training left ahead of
him. In the meantime Mary Lou, the former "Twink" Davies, who
graduated in the School of Political Science last year, is keeping house
for him in their small home.
Pictured above is Mary Lou glancing through one of the old Quads
in the Kohbins' house at Wagon Wheels. More fortunate than their
friends who have been unable to lind a place to live, Marv Lou said,
"We know several couples who are very anxious to return to Stanford
and can't because there aren't enough housing units."

Looking ahead toward the solving of the married veterans' housing
problems, pictured above are 41 housing units being built in Menlo Park
by a Menlo Park contractor. The new housing units, located on small
lots, are situated on the road to Menlo Park which goes past the Stanford
golf course.
A great influx of building is expected around the Palo Alto area as
soon as priorities are lifted in Washington. The Menlo Park units, which
have been under way for some while, will be completed in another two
months.
Other suggestions to relieve the housing congestion are to convert
Stanford-owned Interdale School into housing units and to place mar
ried veterans in facilities at Dibble when it is released by the Army.
Main problems confronting the University in the conversion of Inter
dale include trouble with the water system there and overhauling of the
plumbing facilities. (Photography work for the series was done by Phil
Welch.)




Indicative of (lit- problems facing married veterans attending Stan
furd is the situation in which Dan Fadenrecht and his wife Betty found
themselves. Dan, who was an Air Force administrative officer during the
war, had been unable to find any place to live except the kitchen and
maid's quarters of the 'lhela Xi house.
Dan did his first-year law studying in the butler's pantry of the fra
ternity house where he is shown (above) with his desk pushed against
(lie sink. Dan, a University of California graduate in I!M2, will finish
his law course in two more years. In the meantime Hetty is working
for the San Mateo County Welfare Department.
Before Dan found another place to live last week be said that "living
here iis we are has no advantages over a house or apartment. It is better
than having a single room, though, because we have a little more space."
A married couple is also occupying the kitchen and maid's quarters of
the Zete house, while another couple occupies the small house in back
of the Deke house.

In spite of the fact that they bad to buy a house instead of renting I
one as they would have liked to do, Dick and Betty Lawrence have
overcome their housing troubles with a comfortable two-bedroom house '
on College Avenue.
With a large garden, porch furniture, and a nice-sized house (pic
tured above), the Lawrence's have almost an ideal set-up. Betty's one
complaint is that they bad to buy the house. "We were living in a hnr- j
rible hole before we got this," she said. "We had lo buy it before we
got it at all"
Both Dick and his wife are still attending school. Dick is now a
sophomore and Betty, the former Betty Lou Terry, has two more quar-
J ters before graduation. Like many of the returned veterans, Dick is
a mechanical engineering student.
