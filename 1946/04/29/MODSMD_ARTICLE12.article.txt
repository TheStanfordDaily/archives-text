# STANFORD AXE STOLEN
## Six Youths Take Case; Make Get-Away In '38 Chevrolet Pick-up 
### 
Stanford's Axe was stolen at 10:25 last night by six men.
The thieves came into the Cellar just before closing time.
Only student-worker Bill Steif was there, forced into submission
by threats of violence.
Steif described the husky robbers as "definitely of collegc
age."
Steif's attempts to reach the phone were foiled by the six
men's action.
The six took the entire axe case, leaded it on a black '38 Chev
rolet one and one-half-ton pick-up truck and drove off.
Stanford and Palo Alto police are chasing the thieves. Radio
notification immediately went to all police cars in the Bay Area
and San Francisco.
Only other witness was Cecil Rospaw who saw the incident
from across the street.
Possible routes according to the police were Bay' Shore High
way, Highway 101, or backroads. The latter are the best bet, said
police, since the thieves would encounter only random patrol
cars there.
All highways, roads and bridges are being watched in efforts
to render the theft as ineffective as last spring's when a brawny
group of Bear football stars led by Roger Harding and Ted Ken
field bulled their way into the Cellar and wrested the axe from
its case.
Witnesses Steif and Rospaw believe ihis latest attempt to bo
a carefully planned job. The robbers picked the guietest houi
and worked quickly and efficiently.
This marks the fifth theft of the Axe in its 47-year history. The
score: Cal 4 (if it was Cal last night), Stanford 1.
It started in 1899 when U.C. rooters stole it at a baseball game
in San Francisco. The Farm was not revenged until April, 1930,
when Indian raiders took it right out of Cal hands in front of the
Berkeley bank where the Axe rested. The Bears brought it out
only once a year for the Axe Rally. A minutely planned raid,
involving tear gas and a squad of cars, recovered it for the Farm.
More recent were Cal's short-lived thefts in 1944 and '45. By
agreement the Axe goes to the winner of the Big Game. Stanford
and Cal administrations hold taking the Axe by other mear.:. •:

men's action.
The six took the entire axe case, leaded it on a black '38 Chev
rolet one and one-half-ton pick-up truck and drove off.
Stanford and Palo Alto police are chasing the thieves. Radio
notification immediately went to all police cars in the Bay Area
and San Francisco.
Only other witness was Cecil Rospaw who saw the incident
from across the street.
Possible routes according to the police were Bay' Shore High
way, Highway 101, or backroads. The latter are the best bet, said
police, since the thieves would encounter only random patrol
cars there.
All highways, roads and bridges are being watched in efforts
to render the theft as ineffective as last spring's when a brawny
group of Bear football stars led by Roger Harding and Ted Ken
field bulled their way into the Cellar and wrested the axe from
its case.
Witnesses Steif and Rospaw believe ihis latest attempt to bo
a carefully planned job. The robbers picked the guietest houi
and worked quickly and efficiently.
This marks the fifth theft of the Axe in its 47-year history. The
score: Cal 4 (if it was Cal last night), Stanford 1.
It started in 1899 when U.C. rooters stole it at a baseball game
in San Francisco. The Farm was not revenged until April, 1930,
when Indian raiders took it right out of Cal hands in front of the
Berkeley bank where the Axe rested. The Bears brought it out
only once a year for the Axe Rally. A minutely planned raid,
involving tear gas and a squad of cars, recovered it for the Farm.
More recent were Cal's short-lived thefts in 1944 and '45. By
agreement the Axe goes to the winner of the Big Game. Stanford
and Cal administrations hold taking the Axe by other mear.:. •:
legal. Cal gridders Harding and Kenfield we re suspended ;;r
their abortive attempt last year.
