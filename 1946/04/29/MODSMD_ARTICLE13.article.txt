### 
(Following is an eye-witness
account of the Axe theft at the
Cellar last night. Cecil Ros
paw, Daily reporter, who saw
the burglars take the Axe, was
the only witness beside Bill
Steif, Cellar counterman and
Daily night editor, who was
on duty alone at the time.)
"I was walking down to the
Cellar to buy a pack of cigar
ettes," said Cecil Rospaw, an ex-
G.1., "wlicn F saw two men com
ing out of the Cellar and strug
gling with a large, bulky object.
"At the same time I noticed a
IJKJX ton-and-a-half Chcvvie pick
up truck parked at the curb. The
two men put the object into the
pickup and drove np let the Post
ollice, turning in I lie direction of
Eagunita.
"Rushing into the Cellar. I
found to my utter amazement
that THE SPOT WHERE THE
FAMOUS STANFORD AXE BE
LONGED WAS EMPTY. Mean
while. Bill Steif, a Cellar coun
terman, was phoning the Palo
Alto police.
"I then realized that the small
group of fellows standing by the
Cellar and near the pickup were
participants in the Axe theft. One
in the group, who appeared to be
the leader, was about six feet tall,
blond, and was wearing a red
Stanford jacket.
"As he jumped nlo the pickup
truck he said. 'We just want to
borrow Ibis for a yag.' It seems to
me that only a part of the group
got into the truck. Itut some of
them—who I'm sure were in on
the theft—look oil" on fo<>(."
