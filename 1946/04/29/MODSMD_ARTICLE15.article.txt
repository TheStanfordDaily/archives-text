distance of tv/o oceans and a conglomeration
of language- that may not seem important.
But in terms of human beings and human re

each one of us beg for a little privation at
hom a.
Maybe some people at Stanford have ai
re iy thought of it that way. Maybe they've
re ii.i-d that being well-fed while others
starve isn't, after all, such a comfortable sen
sation. Whatever the thought behind it La
gunita, Roble, and Union dining halls have
begun a symbolic cutting down of their amp
ly padded menus.
There can be a lot more to meeting the
food crisis than omitting bread at one meal
per day. Theer can be severe curtailment of
butter and salad oils and dry cereals. It is
not fantastic to suppose taking on President
Truman's suggestion of European rations—no
grain or grain-fed products one or two days
per week.
An examination of Stanford's war and post
war diets will show a restriction of some of
thcs::o 'Vital" foods— but not a restriction so
thai any of us eaters have noticed it, not a
restriction that meant we were actually or
consciously salvaging food for peoples over
seas.
How can we do more? How can we, prac
tically, cut down on salad oil and butter and
grain, as suggested? We can take a vote at

mealtime on how much we are willing to give
up. We can tell our dining room directors
and cooks and the restaurants that serve us
the things we will do without.
And then you ask, will it help?
It is traditional at Stanford to ignore the
worl doutside; to abandon worthwhile proj
ects half heartedly conceived, and rationalize
the results. This time Stanford students can
say, "Yes, but what good wil la few loaves of
bread serve? How can we possibly save the
150,000,000 people you're talking about, with
the little salad oil we might have eaten?"
Stanford students can say it, but we doubt if
they'll get away with it, whether from point
of view of conscience or of economy twenty
years hence.
From any effort for food conservation might
spring the effort of others to follow suit. What
little we contribute may be duplicated sev
earal thousand-fold by a nation that looks to
its universities for guidance and leadership.
But what is important is that we do not com
pletely ignore the suffering of these millions
simply because—"everybody else is doing
it."
Stanford's contribution to the nation's be
lated project must be wholly voluntary. It is
not for one group of students or officers to
say, "This is what everyone at Stanford will
eat." Nor is it worthwhile from the point of
view of citizenry to have our problems of
conscience so easily solved for us.
And we would ter mit imperative that ev

his appetite, to the saving of lives.—bmv

There can be a lot more to meeting the
food crisis than omitting bread at one meal

butter and salad oils and dry cereals. It is
not fantastic to suppose taking on President

grain or grain-fed products one or two days
per week.
An examination of Stanford's war and post
war diets will show a restriction of some of

How can we do more? How can we, prac

grain, as suggested? We can take a vote at

mealtime on how much we are willing to give
up. We can tell our dining room directors

the things we will do without.

It is traditional at Stanford to ignore the
worl doutside; to abandon worthwhile proj

the results. This time Stanford students can
say, "Yes, but what good wil la few loaves of
bread serve? How can we possibly save the
150,000,000 people you're talking about, with
the little salad oil we might have eaten?"
Stanford students can say it, but we doubt if
they'll get away with it, whether from point
of view of conscience or of economy twenty
years hence.
From any effort for food conservation might
spring the effort of others to follow suit. What
little we contribute may be duplicated sev

its universities for guidance and leadership.
But what is important is that we do not com

Stanford's contribution to the nation's be

not for one group of students or officers to
