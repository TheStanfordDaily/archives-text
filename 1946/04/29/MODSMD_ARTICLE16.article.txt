# One Fumble Too Many

### 
Fumbling and inefficiency on the part of
>ts leaders this week threatened to bog down
America's effort to conserve food and donate
mc.iG'ially to the hungry of the world.
Out of a confusion of speeches and con
flicting suggestions, one fact became clear:
organization of the drive at the top is so weak
that th? people must initiate their own con
servation programs while they wait for gov
ernmental action.
"What are we waiting for?" ask San Fran
cisco residents for one example. Ready for

directions, they can't go ahead on their part
in the national cash collections drive sched
uled for May 12 until they get word from
UNRRA. Formerly they had been told to
contributed canned foods (which would have
necessitated large wastage of money for
transportation); then were told that cash
would be more acceptable.
If this is the kind of indefinite leadership
that exists, then the people will have to do it
all themselves. Hope for a concretely-formu
lated plan from those in charge is fast dis
appearing.
