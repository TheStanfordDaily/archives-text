If you have been screaming for a chance to see

Tomorrow afternoon the Olympic Club comes down
to the Encina Pools, bolstered by ex-Stanford men,
1 ■. attempt to garner a few points from Bob Ander

Horse's Neck, a new dramatic society, will hold
its inaugural meeting this afternoon at 4:30 in room
7, Rutherford B. Hayes Hall.
If the turnout of interested students is large
enough we will attempt to gain recognition from
the A.S.S.U. and announce the production of "Ah,
Wilderness" after two —count 'em—rehearsals.
As a guest speaker for tomorrow's meeting,
Horse's Neck is attempting to get Mr. S. Stanley
Shpetner to speak on the subject: "Who's Calling
Whom a Horse's Neck?"
