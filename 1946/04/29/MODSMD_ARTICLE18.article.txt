### STAN SHPETNER 
Said a recent Daily article on the food conser
vation drive: "Rable women also backed the drive
by deciding that bread will be served at their hall
only when it is necessary to complete the mea1...."
Now whether what we have in mind will be ac
cepted, or not, makes no difference as far as
whether we say it or not is concerned.
The Roble women may call their move "a
backing up of the drive." We are certainly
to need a great deal of force at the front of the
drive to make up for this type of "backing up."
Some women's living groups are going to up
broad at one meal each day. So far a majority of
the houses have made no move whatsoever.
We are noted as the foremost howler that "Stan
ford students live in an Ivory Tower." Wo are
constantly told that our claim is not valid.
With half of Europe and Asia starving, Roble
I tall offers to "use bread only when necessary and
sharply curtail the amount of salad oil." President
Truman appeals to "the warm heart of the Ameri
can people." They must be using one match to heat
all three hundred of Roble's hearts.
O.K. Now let's net down to something which
they say this column has never heard of: some
thing constructive.
We propose: that bread or any product used
in the same manner (rolls, muffins, etc.) be com
pletely cut from every single lunch and dinner
menu in every hall or living group 011 campus.

And that (his he carried out without amendment
until the 15th of June (the end of the quarter).
Now don't tell us, "Oh, that's fantastic." It is
not fantastic. If it seems so, it is not because we
are fantastic—it is because the problem of feeding
those millions who are dying of hunger is fantastic
- and you won't get off your dead arches to do
anything about it.
Actaually—if this is done—you may point out
that in the big picture the amount of wheat that
we save will be small. Suppose our action saves
the life of only one child. Would it be a wasted
action? You don't dare answer yes to that. But
neither will you get out of your lethargy to do it.
A move of this type has to come from the people.
Every jjroup in the nation must take action in their
group, Let's not worry about what the rest of them
are doing until we have mended our own fence.
Action of the type we want will be a first-rate
move to hold up and say, "Stanford is kicking in;
now it's your turn. This is one group's action.
Let's see one more school or town or city do the
same. And one more after that, right on down the
I inc."
This Wednesday evening your student gov
ernment's Executtive Committee (A.S.S.IJ. Ex
com) meets. They are supposed to be running
student affairs. They are supposed to lead the
community.
All right. Let's see what they do.

A move of this type has to come from the people.
Every jjroup in the nation must take action in their
group, Let's not worry about what the rest of them
are doing until we have mended our own fence.
Action of the type we want will be a first-rate
move to hold up and say, "Stanford is kicking in;
now it's your turn. This is one group's action.
Let's see one more school or town or city do the
same. And one more after that, right on down the
I inc."
This Wednesday evening your student gov
ernment's Executtive Committee (A.S.S.IJ. Ex
com) meets. They are supposed to be running
student affairs. They are supposed to lead the
community.
All right. Let's see what they do.
Said a recent Daily article on the food conser
vation drive: "Rable women also backed the drive
by deciding that bread will be served at their hall
only when it is necessary to complete the mea1...."
Now whether what we have in mind will be ac
cepted, or not, makes no difference as far as
whether we say it or not is concerned.
The Roble women may call their move "a
backing up of the drive." We are certainly
to need a great deal of force at the front of the
drive to make up for this type of "backing up."
Some women's living groups are going to up
broad at one meal each day. So far a majority of
the houses have made no move whatsoever.
We are noted as the foremost howler that "Stan
ford students live in an Ivory Tower." Wo are
constantly told that our claim is not valid.
With half of Europe and Asia starving, Roble
I tall offers to "use bread only when necessary and
sharply curtail the amount of salad oil." President
Truman appeals to "the warm heart of the Ameri
can people." They must be using one match to heat
all three hundred of Roble's hearts.
O.K. Now let's net down to something which
they say this column has never heard of: some
thing constructive.
We propose: that bread or any product used
in the same manner (rolls, muffins, etc.) be com
pletely cut from every single lunch and dinner
menu in every hall or living group 011 campus.

And that (his he carried out without amendment
until the 15th of June (the end of the quarter).
Now don't tell us, "Oh, that's fantastic." It is
not fantastic. If it seems so, it is not because we
are fantastic—it is because the problem of feeding
those millions who are dying of hunger is fantastic
- and you won't get off your dead arches to do
anything about it.
Actaually—if this is done—you may point out
that in the big picture the amount of wheat that
we save will be small. Suppose our action saves
the life of only one child. Would it be a wasted
action? You don't dare answer yes to that. But
neither will you get out of your lethargy to do it.
