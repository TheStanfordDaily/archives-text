### 
House mothers for the fraternities, although highly recommended by the University, are not
mandatory for the reopening of the chapter houses next autumn guarter according to Dr. Tres
idder in a letter to Ed Luce, Interfraternity Board President.
Dr. Tresidder's letter, in answer to the Board's suggested guidance plan, stated that "the uni
versity will expect each fraternity to present a plan of operation of its house that provides for a

l i
responsible resident officer. In this
connection, while its is not manda
tory, in our judgment house moth
ers under favorable conditions pro
vide the best solution to this re
quirement. Faculty members, or
mature graduate students, may be
used."
sle went on to explain thai the
I nivfisitv fell that the employ
ment of a "paid general interfra
ternity adviser," the Board's plan,
was not desirable and therefore
would not he adopted.
According to the University's
present plans, the fraternity houses
will be returned to their owners at
the conclusion of spring quarter.
Ail Brand in, University Business
Manager, will represent the school
in the financial aspects of the trans
fer and will supervise the installa
tion of any necessary sanitation,
safety, or fire prevention measures.
"We arc convinced that there is
;i definite gain both to students and
universities from having a mature,
responsible person in each living
unit. The University intends to in
stitute .such a system in all of its
own living units." wrote Dr. Trcs
idder.
