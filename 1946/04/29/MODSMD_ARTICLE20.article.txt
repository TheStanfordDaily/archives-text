# FOOD CONSERVATION—THEORY AND PRACTICE
## Stanford Begins Drive To Aid Europe's 150 Million Starving 
### CRAIG VITTETOE 
One hundred fifty million starv
ing in Europe—vast areas with no
child alive under three years of age
- President Truman appeals to
American people — LaGuardia asks
for more UNRRA supplies.
Such pleas for the alleviation of
this tragic situation are not being
ignored, either by the nation as a
whole or by Stanford University.
The round-up of "Heifers for Re-

Olfice hours tomorrow for col
lection of money for "Ilcifers for
Relief" are from S to 10 a.m., 1 to
2 and -1 to 5:30 p.m. in the Rally
Com room of the Old Union.

! lief" in progress on the campus this
; week is one of the first concrete
things Stanford students will be
j able io do.
It is significant because of its na
ture as an immediate humanitarian
program and a long-range plan for
| the re-establishment of economic
order as an essential requirement
for maintaining peace.
j It is further significant that uni
versity people, theoretically leaders
! in the thinking of a nation, should
! come to undertake such a project

! quickly and spontaneously, as they
' have at Stanford.
"Heifers for Relief" has its ori
| gins as far back as the Spanish
! civil war, when the members of a
Protestant denomination realized
j the importance of the cattle popula
tion in the economy of a nation, and
saw the destruction wrought on
; livestock by war. Since that be
! ginning, the group has continued to
! grow in its original spirit—a com
i pletely voluntary project, with
| money, time, and cattle being do
| nated by the American people.
The project is now functioning in
I co-operation with UNRRA, and is
| sponsored by a committee composed
| of representatives of the Brethren
i Church, who were the original
founders, the Catholic Rural Wel
fare Association, the Jewish Wel
fare Board, and numerous Protes
tant denominations and civic wel
fare groups. The goal for this year
| is $1,000,000 and 25.000 head of
I cattle.
The value of "Heifers for Relief"
5 may be comprehended in terms of
human life, for it is estimated that
i one cow, the cost of which is $150.
! will sive the lives of ten children—
I $15 for a human life.
In accordance with one of the ba-
I sic features of the project, cattle

! have been sent to various countries
of Europe and given to individual
: families regardless of race or reli
gion— the only requisite is need.
France, Poland, Greece, and Russia
have benefited so far. The exact
j destination of any shipment of eat
! tie within a country is determined
|in co-operation with the depart
ment of agriculture of that country.
Stanford students may feel a
I more direct contact with "Heifers
| for Relief" depending on the plans
1 of some 25 Stanford men to go this
j summer as sea-going cowboys on
| ships transporting the cattle over
seas. These men may spend their
entire summer vacation voluntarily
doing the basic dirty work of car
ing for the cattle in the ships, and
I then individually contacting the
people to whom they are given.
The Stanford Round-up is being
sponsored by a committee composed
j of representatives from Rally Com,
i Y.W.C.A., Chapel Board, and the
Stanford chapter of Student Fed
i eralists. Members are A 1 Strain,
chairman, Diane Roth, Patty
Whittemore, Carolyn Larson, Mary
I Ethel Robinson. Joy Dunbaugh, Ed
| Ornitz, Bill Eilers, Joan Lucas, Em
; mett Purcell, Craig Vittetoe, and
' Virginia Voegeii.


WHILE '11310 GOVERNMENT urges us to save every ounce of extra food, while entire nations starve
in Europe, Roland Anderson, California poultry rancher, burns his chickens. lEe says he can't get enough

dislike us.
