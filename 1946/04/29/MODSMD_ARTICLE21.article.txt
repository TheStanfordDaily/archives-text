# Janet Lewis Shows Skill at Detail And Imagery in Story Collection

### HELEN PINKERTON 
"Goodbye Son," a collection of
stories selling now at the Stanford
Bookstore for $2.00, is by Janet
Lewis, wife of Arthur Yvor Win
tors, associate professor in the Eng
lish Department.
Only two of the stories in
"Goodbye Son" have not been
previously printed. The others
rover a period of roughly twenty
years in the dates of their com
position and firs! printings. One
of the oldest is "Sunday Dinner,"
written in the late twenties. The
characters in this story are those
who figured in Mrs. Winters'
novel "Against a Darkening Sky."
Varied Sources
Mrs. Winters says she obtains ma
terial for her novels and storiis
from various sources. "The Wife of
Martin Guerre," an early novel,
had its beginnings in the ancient
records of a jail. "Against a Dark
ening Sky" and most of the stories
in "Goodbyi Son" are about ordi
nary people living in states of the
Middle West and in California. The
Great Lakes region and the San
Francisco Bay area are the setting
for the title story.
Two of the stories in "Goodbye
Son" have been translated into
French and published in France.
The reason for this, Mrs. Win
ters believes, is that the French
like lo read about the everyday

lives of people in (his country,
i The characters and incidents she
! utilizes arc those common to all
j people—children, home, birth, and
• death—which are often dealt with
1 cither falsely or tritely.
In her writing Mrs. Winters fre
| quently draws from actual people
I or incidents; some characters are
created and some are composite
j portraits. Part of her technique
! Mrs. Winters describes in the meta
phor of Marianne Moore that of
1 putting "real toads in imaginary
J gardens."
ONE INTRICATE PLOT
The title story, a novelette about
| a mother who recognized her dead
i son in four boys who -entered her
i life and left just before some disas
ter, is the only one for which Mrs.
Winters claims to have worked out
a plot of any intricacy.
Others in "Goodbye Son" have
been published in Pagany, The
Magazine, This Quarter, The
: Rookman, and one, by accident,
in McCall's Magazine. One story,
j which is about a Japanese-Amer
ican family, was rejected by Mc
i Call's because it dealt with "con
troversial material."
I Sorno of the early stories ap
j peared in The Gyroscope, a mimeo
graphed periodical published in
! ] r )29 by Mr. and Mrs. Winters and
j Howard Baker, in which Katharine
I Anne Porter, Kay Boyle, and Caro

| lyn Gordon published some of their
'irst stories.
PROSE HIGHLY READABLE
Mrs. Winters writes readable if
highly concentrated prose. She ap~
| pears to get her effects by concen
\ tration descriptive detail and on
feeling, in order to get an image in
| all the a.spccts which ii presents to
ja sensitive observer. This attempt
to get an image rather than to work
| out an obvious plot probably ac
counts for Mrs. Winters' high rep
utation among the critics as "a
i literary stylist."
In common with Mr. Winters, she
! also writes poetry. A collection of
her most recent poems and those
which have already appeared in pe
riodicals will be published later in
j die year.

"Goodbye Son," a collection of
stories selling now at the Stanford
Bookstore for $2.00, is by Janet
Lewis, wife of Arthur Yvor Win
tors, associate professor in the Eng
lish Department.
Only two of the stories in
"Goodbye Son" have not been
previously printed. The others
rover a period of roughly twenty
years in the dates of their com
position and firs! printings. One
of the oldest is "Sunday Dinner,"
written in the late twenties. The
characters in this story are those
who figured in Mrs. Winters'
novel "Against a Darkening Sky."
Varied Sources
Mrs. Winters says she obtains ma
terial for her novels and storiis
from various sources. "The Wife of
Martin Guerre," an early novel,
had its beginnings in the ancient
records of a jail. "Against a Dark
ening Sky" and most of the stories
in "Goodbyi Son" are about ordi
nary people living in states of the
Middle West and in California. The
Great Lakes region and the San
Francisco Bay area are the setting
for the title story.
Two of the stories in "Goodbye
Son" have been translated into
French and published in France.
The reason for this, Mrs. Win
ters believes, is that the French
like lo read about the everyday

lives of people in (his country,
i The characters and incidents she
! utilizes arc those common to all
j people—children, home, birth, and
• death—which are often dealt with
1 cither falsely or tritely.
In her writing Mrs. Winters fre
| quently draws from actual people
I or incidents; some characters are
created and some are composite
j portraits. Part of her technique
! Mrs. Winters describes in the meta
phor of Marianne Moore that of
1 putting "real toads in imaginary
J gardens."
ONE INTRICATE PLOT
The title story, a novelette about
| a mother who recognized her dead
i son in four boys who -entered her
i life and left just before some disas
ter, is the only one for which Mrs.
Winters claims to have worked out
a plot of any intricacy.
Others in "Goodbye Son" have
been published in Pagany, The
Magazine, This Quarter, The
: Rookman, and one, by accident,
in McCall's Magazine. One story,
j which is about a Japanese-Amer
ican family, was rejected by Mc
i Call's because it dealt with "con
troversial material."

j Howard Baker, in which Katharine
I Anne Porter, Kay Boyle, and Caro

'irst stories.
PROSE HIGHLY READABLE
Mrs. Winters writes readable if
highly concentrated prose. She ap~

\ tration descriptive detail and on
feeling, in order to get an image in
