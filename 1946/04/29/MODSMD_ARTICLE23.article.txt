# Olympic Club Spikers Triumph With Weight-Event Superiority
## 
### BOB ARMS 
Surprising nearly every one of
the 2,000 fans present, Stanford's
track team came within 17 points of
defeating the highly touted San
Francisco Club thinclads Saturday
afternoon on Angell Field.
In the triangular meet, a junior
college combine being the third en
trant, the final total was—Olympic
Club 78'•>. Stanford 61, and the
combined junior colleges of San
Mateo, Modesto, and Sacramento
22'/-.
With three events to go, Stanford
was ahead by one point. However,
the Winged-O's terrific strength in
weight events and the mile relay
gave them their winning margin.
Stanford's relay team, without the
able assistance of George Grimes,
turned in a very creditable per
formance and nearly clipped the
talent-loaded Olympic team. Fresh
man Ted Off subbed for Grimes,
who pulled a leg muscle in warm
ups, and ran a terrific lap for the
Stanford quartet.
Captain Martin Anderson won the
century in a sparkling 9.9. This
clipped three-tenths of a second off
bis best previous mark and was the
outstanding mark of the day. The
time was typical of the improvement
shown by the whole Stanford squad.
Coach Jack Weiershauser is singly
responsible for rounding the inex
perienced team into such good shape
in so short a time.
If one man on the Olympic Club
were to be cited for contributing
most to Stanford's defeat, it would
be ex-Farm star Johnny Fulton.
Fulton won the mile 10 yards ahead
of Frank Ganahl, took the 220 in a
breeze, and anchored the Winged-0
relay team to victory.
Ganahl showed terrific strength
in finishing the mile. If he had be
gun his sprint earlier, he might
have nosed out Fulton. In finishing
second his time was 4:27.3, which is
7 seconds better than he has run

this year.
Bill Larson vaulted 13 feet for*the
first time in his career. The compe
tition was so strong, however, it
was only good enough for a tie for
first. Three other Olympic Club
vaulters managed to reach the
same height. Larson also pulled up
to nab a close second in the high
hurdles.
Jack Cambell won the broad
jump for Stanford by inch. His
distance was 21 feet 7 7 « inches. Lind
of the Olympic Club was sceond

with 21 feet 7 1 -i inches. In the high
jump, Stanfordite Ed Luce won it
for his third consecutive meet vic
tory. The height was 6 feet l 1.;
inches. Don Lowe and Maurice
Drenkel, both of Stanford, tied for
second in the event.

The Winged-0 men swept the dis
eus to give them 11 points. Peter
Zagar, ex-Stanford N.C.A.A. champ,
won the event with a toss of 153
feet 8 7 k inches. In the javelin and
.'hot put, Stanford men only man
aged to get two fourths. Strength
in the weights proved to be the
margin of victory for the Olym-
Al Vierthaler navigated the 220
low hurdles in 24.8 to cop a blue
ribbon for Stanford. This is his
best time for the event and it will
improve with closer competition.
Captain Anderson ran second to
show that he can triple up and still
come through. He was also in the
pole vault, but augered-out under
the terrific jumping by the Winged-
CD lads and teammate Bill Larson.
Had George Grimes not pulled
the leg muscle in warming up be
fore the meet, the story in the mid
dle distances might have been dif
ferent. As it was the Olympians
had it pretty much their way. Wil
kins and Hinze of Stanford did man
age to get second and third in the
440 and Low grabbed a fourth in
the 880.
