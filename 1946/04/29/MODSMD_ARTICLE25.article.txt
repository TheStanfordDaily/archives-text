THINGS THAT AREN'T SO PLEASANT ON MONDAY
MORNING . . . The baseball loss to California. . . . Still unable
to conquer the infield error plague, the Cards dropped tho first of
four scheduled contests with Berkeley. . . . Inability of George
Grimes to run Saturday in the trackfest. . . .
LOOKING AHEAD to Saturday, we find lack Weiershauser's
track squad traveling to Los Angeles to take on the rnuch-vaunted
USC aggregation. . . . We don't stand a chance in the world to
take the meet, but in some events we ought to give the Trojans a
run for their money. . . . The tennis squad also scuttles south this J
weekend. . . . UCLA baseballers travel north for a two-game 1
Series against the Farm diamondeers: . . .
From our correspondent, J.W.B. in San Francisco comes word (
that the sophs in the Med School swamped the seniors, 6 to 2, in
a gruelling baseball contest. . . . Doc Mason, who will be remem
bered for his flinging on the Farm, hurling for the sophomores.
STRICTLY ON THE PREDICTION SIDE . . . Barney Gugel,
who has been unofficially acting as our midwestern correspond
ent, informs us that definitely Northwestern will NOT win the
football crown in the "Big Nine" next season. Says Gugel, Michi
gan will be plenty strong next fall, and I wouldn't be at all sur
prised to stee them win the title . . ." Gugel further says, "If
Northwestern, or lowa, wins the conference, I'll eat a chocolate
covered cucmber atop the Hoover Libe at 11:54 p.m."
SOMETHING WE'D LIKE TO FIND OUT FOR SURE . . .
Whether Harvard threw in the sponge on intercollegiate foot
ball. ... If true, and we hope it isn't, it means that two leading
universities in the country have thrown the game down the drain.
... U. of Chicago was the first. . . .
POST-MORTEM TRACK NOTES . . . USC should grab some
thing like 100 points, or more next Saturday against the Farm
lads. The paper dope sheet figures about 102 points for the Tro
jans, to our 28. . . .
