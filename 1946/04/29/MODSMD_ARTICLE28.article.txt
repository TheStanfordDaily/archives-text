# California Nine Claws Locals 6-3 for Third CIBA Victory
## 
### STU MILLAR 
California won its third straight California Intercollegiate Baseball
Association ball game last Saturday afternoon at the expense of Harry
Wolter's Indians by a score of 6 to 3. It was the third straight lo?s for the
Stanford baseball team in conference play.
As usual it was in the fielding department that Farm weakness was
most obvious and most costly. Of the six Bear counters only three were
earned. The rest can be charged to live Stanford errors.
The Bears went to the front in the second inning when they pounced
on Stanford hurler Phil Wolfe for four hits and three runs. Alter that
point the home team was never headed, foi the Cards were unable to
score until the eighth inning of the contest.
The game was not without its last-minute excitement, however, for the
Indians, behind by four runs in the first of the ninth matted out a pair of

bingles to score a run and then ♦
loaded the bases on the wildness of '
Cal moundsman Virge Butler. But
Denny Fox, Stanford's batting star
for the day with two hits, flied out
to left field on a three and one ,
pitch to end the rally and the ball
game.
