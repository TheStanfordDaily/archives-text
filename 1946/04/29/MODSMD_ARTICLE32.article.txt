# IT CONCERNS US:
## Republicans and Democrats of 1946 
### RALPH HOVIS 
The independent voter with lib
eral inclinations will have a hard
time this fall, and perhaps in 1948,
to find the appropriate party which
will represent his beliefs. Both
Democrats and Republicans reflect
internal dissension of the first order.
The party in power suffers from
a split between the Administra
tion segment and the Dixie-Dem
ocratic group. President Truman
has objectives almost like Mr.
Roosevelt's — liberal domestic ac
tion and international co-opera
tion—but Mr. Truman's methods
are almost totally unlike bis pre
decessor's.
In regard to the objectives, Mr.
Truman has never moved from the
Left on any important issue, has
pressed constantly for having the
government play a large role in the

nation's economic affairs, and has
shaped his legislative program
around all the New Deal measures
he inherited — and supported. As
for methods, the President favors
responsible decentralization within
his administration, is a profound
believer in the division of powers
between the Congress and the Ex
ecutive, and has neither talent nor
taste for one-man rule.
During his first year in office Mr.
Truman has entered accounts on
the credit side of the political ledg
er. The danger of one-man rule
has been removed, there is no rub
ber-stamp Congress, and the re
moval of many wartime controls
has been carried out. Additional
credit entries are the partial re
sponsibility for increased civilian
production to 150 billion dollars an
nually, an unyielding support giv
en to U.N. and other international
economic and political agencies, ef
forts made to secure a balanced
budget, and the realistic aims to
obtain domestic military strength to
equal foreign commitments.
The debit side of the ledger re
flects the inability to correct the
deep split in the Democratic
ranks over the question of future
policy. The resulting program has
included temporizing and hesi
tating, and even using bad judg
ment on some political appoint
ments. Political absenteeism has

hampered domestic legislation. 1
Finally, many voters have just
naturally accumulated resent
ment toward a party so long in
power.
Mr. Truman is faced with the }
difficult task of holding together an
incongruous Democratic party. As j
it is now, the conservative Southern I
| Democrats are hampering Truman's !
! liberal program while the CIO-PAC 1
I and more radical groups wish to i
follow an even more liberal plan '
' than Truman proposes.
While the Democratic party sails
j on stormy seas there is no reason
i whatsoever to expect that the Re
j publican party could operate the j
j ship of state with any better luck
, than Mr. Truman has had. The Re
j publicans, as a party, have no pol- {
I icy, no program, and no principles. !
The first of the several groups
within the G.O.P. includes the
proverbial Old Guard Senator
Taft, G.O.P. National Committee

Chairman Rcccc, Colonel McCor
inick of the Tribune, and Tafl's
little hov Bricker. The Old Guard
j has long been in control of the
I party purse and machine. Its
policies have b"cn those of vot
ing against all progressive legis
lation. J
The La Follette Progressives have
j recently rejoined the G.O.P. and
now form the second group of the
j party. They have no faith in the
I reactionaries and of course are not
welcomed by them. The Dulles
j Vandenborg group might lay claim
to a changed international attitude
i toward co-operation while main
taining a middle-of-the-road do
mestic program. Governor Dewey j
has never stated definite beliefs on
j international problems even though
he has had an outspoken, progres
! sive domestic administration in New
York state. The Dewey-Meade race
in the coming New York guberna
j torial campaign may improve Dew
j ey's standing nationally if h» con
j tinues to maintain the advantage
j shown in several polls.
The last group contains the vig
orous, highly principled combina
tion of Stasscn, Morse, Saltonstall, i
and such men as Austin and Gris
wold. Liberal Republicans can
place their blue chips with any of
j these men who may become can
didates in IJMB for the presiden
; tial nominations.
Both Democratic and Republican
leaders have two years in which to
I unify their respective party seg
! ments and formulate definite pro
grams from which the rank and file
voters can decide their stand. 11
would be well for both parties to
; modify old policies and procedures
I according to new conditions so as
to meet the needs of the majority
of the people rather than the usual
minority of interest groups.
