NEW YORK, April 28 (UP). The United Nations Security Co'incil
faced a showdown tonight on a proposed investigation of Franco Spain
which Russia may try lo veto.
An Australian resolution for a fact-finding study of Spain to deter
mine if the Franco regime threatens world peace is scheduled for a vole

:i( :! p.m. tomorrow after a week-
cml recess to permit Russian Del
egate Andrei A. (jromyko and
others to consult their govern
ments. Ten Council members
support the Australian plan with j
varying degrees of enthusiasm.
Gromyko apparently stood pat on
his opposition to the investigation.!
ITo told tho Council bluntly th;«t
Russia considers there is already j
ample evidence to justify an imme
diate United Nations diplomatic j
blockade of Spain, as formally' pro- j
posed by Poland, and charged that j
further delay would smack of pre- j
war appeasement.
Some Council delegates were
hopeful Ciromyko would receive
instructions from Moscow — or
from Paris, where Soviet Foreign
Minister V. M. Molotov is attend
ing Big Four peace treatv talks—
not to try to block the Australian
plan by asserting a right to veto
it.
