LOS ANGELES, April 28 (UP).
â€”Attorney B. J. Bradncr hilled
the county for $25,080 in a dam
age suit on file today, because a
chair in Superior Court let him
down unceremoniously.
Since the chair gave way un
der him while trying a court suit
last July 0, he has suffered dizzy
spells and loss of his sense of
equilibrium, Bradncr claimed.
In his suit, the attorney charged
county officials knew the chair
was unreliable but did nothing
about it.
