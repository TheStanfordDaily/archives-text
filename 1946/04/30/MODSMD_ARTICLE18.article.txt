for sponsor choosing. The eommit
! tee will meet in the Excom room to

7 from .'5 to 5 p.m. and May 8 from
1 1 to 3 p.m.
To be a sponsor, a girl must be of

j "C" average. There i.s a possibility
j that both junior and senior spon
j sors nvv be selected for each cor

RATIO SYSTEM
Sponsors will not be announced
| until after tlie A.S.S.U. elections, so
! that a girl may apply for sponsor
j ing and still run in the election. If
I she i.s selected to a major office, she
j will not be appointed a sponsor.

Miss Anastasia Doyle, director of
women's housing, and Housing
Committee members have now
worked out the committee's two
ratio plans to see how they would
affect the number of women in each
class that would be placed in the
vacancies that are expected.
The system basing the ratio on
the number of people in each class
drawing to the number of vacan
cies in each house and the one bas
ing a ratio in each house on the
number of women in each class in
the University come out approxi
mately the same in the total num
ber that would be placed in cach
class.

Conference members discussed
the ratio system versus the class
preference system in room draw
| ing and were to take it back to their
j house meetings to see what the ma
t jority of girls really want. The
final decision rests with the Ad-
J ministration, however.

\ House presidents felt that the
1 system of keeping the houses open
until 1:30 on Saturday nights has
| been working very well in most
i cases. Some living groups are hav-
I ing trouble getting a girl to be
| hostess, and therefore cannot open
ihcir houses after 12. Miss Patten
j will suggest to the Administration
j that the trial period include next
! fall quarter also, as more use of
the system will be made when the
weather is not so warm.
The Conference fashion show to
raise money for the Conference
scholarship will be held May 9 at
