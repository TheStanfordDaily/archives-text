### 
FRANKFURT, April 28 (UP).â€”
Enraged Jews, storming out of a
displaced persons camp at Lands
burg, today wielded clubs, knives,
and stones on the German residents
of the town, starting scores of street
fights, overturning public vehicles,
and leaving the populace cowering
in their homes.
American troops, rushed to the
scene in armored cars and jeeps,
were forced to fire on the mob be
fore order was restored. An esti
mated 5,000 to 6,000 Jewish refu
gees and German civilians were in
volved in the fighting, which lasted
from 10 a.m. to 2:10 p.m., authorities
said.
The Jews turned on the far out
numbered American troops at
tempting to restore order, stoning
the U.S. soldiers and calling them
"S.S. swine" and "Gestapo."'
Casualties reports varied. Offi
cial headquarters of the 9th In
fantry Division, Augsburg, Bavaria,
25 miles from Latidsburg, reported
that two persons had been killed
and at least 40 seriously wounded.
Authorities at U.S. intelligence
headquarters at Frankfurt, how
ever, said no deaths had been re
ported to them and that only six
persons were injured seriously
enough to require hospitalization.
