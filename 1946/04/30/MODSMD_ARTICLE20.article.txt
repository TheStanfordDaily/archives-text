In a concerted move to aid wherever feasible the nationwide drive to aid Europe's starving
millions, Branner women last night voted to purchase one heifer ($l5O worth) and to omit bread
completely at dinner and all oils for use in salad dressings. Cakes and pies were for the most
part voted out of Branner menus.
Madrono's 36 women and Union's 40 joined the fight with a pledge to buy one heifer each,

heifer would save the life of ten
children. That's a pretty low rate
