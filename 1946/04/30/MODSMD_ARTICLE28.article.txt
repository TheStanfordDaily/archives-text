# Branner Plans Last Formal
## 
### 
"Waltz of the Fiowers" has been
chosen as the theme of Branner's
last formal under the directorship
of women. This last fling at filling
the former men's dorm—scheduled
to be returned to the men next fall
— with formals and flowers will last
from 9 to 1 Saturday evening.
Leonard Auletti, his 12-piece or
chestra and vocalist, have been en
gaged. They provide music regu
larly at the Palace Hotel, according
to Joanne Cross, general chairman.
Bitls will go on .sale to Brainier
women for $2.50 this week, said
Miss Cross, and will be sold to the
rest of the campus later in the
week. Only 100 bids will be sold,
and programs will be distributed
with them.
