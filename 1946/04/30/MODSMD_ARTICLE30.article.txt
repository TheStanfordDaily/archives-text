# Election 'Round the Corner
## 
### 
Ths big move is on. Coming up in three
wee!:s we have the first postwar A.S.S.U.
elections, the first chance to show that we're
out io make student government something
more than a hollow shell in which a few not
tointerested or confident students rattle
around.
A philosophy major toppled us off our
smug pinnacle one day when he asked what
was the use of this student government. We
stuttered around and finally had to admit
th u iho Farm's v/as in many cases a near
v. juum, and that as far as initiative and pro
gressive action was concerncd, it was a
lazy-man's paradise

But far from being as dogmatic as friend
philosopher, who proposed tossing out the
whole works because it was not utilitarian,
we propose that Stanford take a good, long
squint at its student government and then
elect officers who won't be satisfied with
the status quo, but who will work to develop
a stronger and more constructive set-up.
Theoretically, anyhow, we all want good
officers for 194G-47. But before the election
of May 23 catches you off guard ... it
promises to be a most important and inter
esting one ... be sure that you've scanned
the field for nominees who can handle the
revitalizing job of the year ahead.
