### BILL STEIF 
v/c II now. between axe-stealings and engage
ments and track meet: and the beautiful, bonny
i:un of Northern California we fell as if the whole
world revolvtd around the Hoover War Library
last week-end.
Yesterday morning, however, after listening to
about ten thousand people snarl "Where did you
put the Axe?" we (lopped down into a seat in our
8 o'clock class and relaxed listening to a tew re
marks about the nature of revolution.
'I.malkr (the nature of revolution, that is)
1 i us to wondering by some devious mental
I -';fess about the things that are going on in
China. Revolution, according to yesterday morn
ing's speaker, is essentially a shift in the atti
tudes <it a great number of people toward their
|ii>litical leaders. This change in ideas, usually
|u<<i[)itat< d by some outside force such as war,
depression or prolonged oppression, is the thing
which < n eventually lead to violence and revo
lution—depending upon the intensity of people's
feelings about the new ideas and upon the in
tensity of the precipitating agent.
All this, we'll admit, is pretty heavy stuff, but we
are wondering now whether this switch is going on
in China arid, in fact, whether the whole thesis is
applicable to China. We don't know a great deal
about C hina (we might as well get that off of our
cbt I cighl away) but from what we do know it
strikes us that the great submerged mass of Chi
>}( .<• people have been rolling along on just about
the subsistence margin for centuries. Though that
is probably less true today than ever before, it
seems i«i us that it is still quite generally true in
die overpopulated portions of southern and central

China. And when a man can just barely get enough
to feed himself each day we think that most of his
ideas concentrate on getting the day's chow with
out regard to considerations on what we might call
the political level. In other words, the people of the
hugely populated parts of China have had so little
opportunity for education (whi h makes people
appreciate the power of mass expression) and for a
life which allows time for reflection, that they
remain a great and disorganized neutral mass
which can be shoved around with comparative ease.
In Northern China and in the vast sub-arctic
areas of Mongolia and Manchuria the situation
seems to have jelled differently. Up there the
competition for food, we suspect, is not so keen
and, since the Soviet revolution the opportunities
for education have improved a thousand per cent.
The education, we might add, has undoubtedly
had a slightly Marxist twist. The result, nat
urally, has been a very decided change of ideas
in these people—their group attitude, in fact, has
become Communistic.
This is our own crude* little analysis of the "Civil
War" which is still apparently raging in Man
churia. It may help to explain, a little bit, what
those occasional news dispatches out of Manchuria
mean in terms of human beings. It is very hard to
get news of this "Civil War" from Manchuria but
once in a while some correspondent comes through
with a terrific yarn. Such a one was a dispatch
which Reynolds Packard, a veteran United Press
correspondent, tiled on April 19 describing the bat
tle and fall of Changchun. It might be worth your
while to check it on the back page.

about C hina (we might as well get that off of our
cbt I cighl away) but from what we do know it
strikes us that the great submerged mass of Chi
>}( .<• people have been rolling along on just about
the subsistence margin for centuries. Though that
is probably less true today than ever before, it
seems i«i us that it is still quite generally true in
die overpopulated portions of southern and central

China. And when a man can just barely get enough
to feed himself each day we think that most of his
ideas concentrate on getting the day's chow with
out regard to considerations on what we might call
the political level. In other words, the people of the
hugely populated parts of China have had so little
opportunity for education (whi h makes people
appreciate the power of mass expression) and for a
life which allows time for reflection, that they
remain a great and disorganized neutral mass
which can be shoved around with comparative ease.
In Northern China and in the vast sub-arctic
areas of Mongolia and Manchuria the situation
seems to have jelled differently. Up there the
competition for food, we suspect, is not so keen
and, since the Soviet revolution the opportunities
for education have improved a thousand per cent.
The education, we might add, has undoubtedly
had a slightly Marxist twist. The result, nat
urally, has been a very decided change of ideas
in these people—their group attitude, in fact, has
become Communistic.
This is our own crude* little analysis of the "Civil
War" which is still apparently raging in Man
churia. It may help to explain, a little bit, what
those occasional news dispatches out of Manchuria
mean in terms of human beings. It is very hard to
get news of this "Civil War" from Manchuria but
once in a while some correspondent comes through
with a terrific yarn. Such a one was a dispatch
which Reynolds Packard, a veteran United Press
correspondent, tiled on April 19 describing the bat
tle and fall of Changchun. It might be worth your
while to check it on the back page.
