# THE 						STANFORD STORY
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
ON TiiE TECHNIQUE OF REGAINING AXES
At 4:30 on a sunny 1930 April afternoon cars
beting members of Stanford's "Immortal 21" left
the Mausoleum for the trip to Berkeley. Planning
for lour years to regain the Stanford Axe from Cal,
this c roup of Sequoia Hall "roughs" had tried and
failed three times in three years to pull off the job.
Now headed for their fourth try and master
minded by Don Kropp, '29, the "21" had laid minute
plans to correct previous mistakes.
( . al was displaying the Axe in an annual
breast-beating display of egotism at the state
institution's Greek theater.
The 21 Cardinals knew the Axe was to be re
turned to the enfolding bosom of the Berkeley
American Trust Company vaults by armored car
after the rally. With a problem like that ahead,
they relaxed their minds by razzing cops and
whistling at what their generation called "flappers."
On arrival, the car of students joined the Cal
fiosh in their march to the bank to pick up the
Ax" for the rally. A second car went to the
Greek theater. Kropp and a companion drove to
Oakland, rented a drive-it-yourself car, and head
ed for the rally after leaving Kropp's car near the
American Trust Company. The stage was set.
One group of Stanfordit?s at the rally edged
their way close to the center. When the rally was
over they hovered solicitously near the Axe guard
ing it with their lives against any " — Stanford
men."
Another live conspirators left I he rally ten
minutes early. Taking the rented car to the door
step of the bank, they set up a camera in the
rumble seat. Others took out flashbulb equip
ment and took a stand on the bank steps. At the
entrance of the bank was Stanfordite Art Miller,
'31, equipped with an innocent expression and a
tear-gas bomb.
Soon around the corner came the black, steel
armored Studebakor. Inside was the Axe in the
ai ms of a beefy Cal athlete named Norman Horner,
v/ho had just been elected to guard it with his life.
Several carefully selected Cal men were riding
on the running boards, including carefully selected
Howard Avery, Eric Hill, Bob Loofbourow, and
Jerry Bettman of Stanford. They had been so de
termined to guard the Axe at the rally that their

California pals allowed them to ride with it as a
reward for their loyalty. They were "good guys."
Here the California ego played its inevitable
role. The freshman guards were suckers for the
fake cameramen v/ho "wanted to get a good shot",
of the Axe.
As llorner stepped from the car with the Axe,
a flashbulb overloaded with powder exploded in
his face and Avery dropped from the top of the
car onto his neck. As quick as a Cal frosh could
say "O, deary me," the Axe was being passed
down a line of willing Stanford hands.
The whole thing was so fast that Bob Loof
bourow, the Axe under his sweater, walked un
touched to the rented fake camera car. The Cali
forniaris were milling around the grunting Horner,
v/ho was trying to flatten Cardinals Avery, Hill, and
Bettman.
As the car and the Axe ground away from the
curb, Miller threw the tear-gas bomb into the
mob. The mob scattered. Several enraged ani
mals from Berkeley pushed Avery into the bank.
Others had the highly original idea of following
the escaping car, but all the exits were by coin
cidence blocked by Stanford cars.
Stanford men circulated through the mob .sug
gesting that death was too good for those dirty
- from the Farm, and that everyone should
go to the Campanile to organize a search party.
With their usual objection to being led, the Berke
ley animals thought this was a wonderful idea. A
majority of the mob headed for the Campanile,
giving the Axe captors another half-hour head
start..
All six cylinders humming about the unwashed
Golden Bear, the rented car with Loofbourow and
the Axe went like hell for home. Jim Trimming
ham, '29, the driver, later said he made 62 miles
per hour through Berkeley, 73 through Oakland,
and 86 from there on in.
Fifty minutes later the Axe was back on the
Farm.
Cal was very hurl about the whole thing.
Their editor analyzed the raid as the product of
a "God-forsaken campus" which engineered "the
most carefully planned racketeer robbery in local
history, importing Chicago methods rather than
honest burglary."

( . al was displaying the Axe in an annual
breast-beating display of egotism at the state
institution's Greek theater.
The 21 Cardinals knew the Axe was to be re
turned to the enfolding bosom of the Berkeley
American Trust Company vaults by armored car
after the rally. With a problem like that ahead,
they relaxed their minds by razzing cops and
whistling at what their generation called "flappers."
On arrival, the car of students joined the Cal
fiosh in their march to the bank to pick up the
Ax" for the rally. A second car went to the
Greek theater. Kropp and a companion drove to
Oakland, rented a drive-it-yourself car, and head
ed for the rally after leaving Kropp's car near the
American Trust Company. The stage was set.
One group of Stanfordit?s at the rally edged
their way close to the center. When the rally was
over they hovered solicitously near the Axe guard
ing it with their lives against any " — Stanford
men."
Another live conspirators left I he rally ten
minutes early. Taking the rented car to the door
step of the bank, they set up a camera in the
rumble seat. Others took out flashbulb equip
ment and took a stand on the bank steps. At the
entrance of the bank was Stanfordite Art Miller,
'31, equipped with an innocent expression and a
tear-gas bomb.
Soon around the corner came the black, steel
armored Studebakor. Inside was the Axe in the
ai ms of a beefy Cal athlete named Norman Horner,
v/ho had just been elected to guard it with his life.
Several carefully selected Cal men were riding
on the running boards, including carefully selected
Howard Avery, Eric Hill, Bob Loofbourow, and
Jerry Bettman of Stanford. They had been so de
termined to guard the Axe at the rally that their

California pals allowed them to ride with it as a
reward for their loyalty. They were "good guys."
Here the California ego played its inevitable
role. The freshman guards were suckers for the
fake cameramen v/ho "wanted to get a good shot",
of the Axe.
As llorner stepped from the car with the Axe,
a flashbulb overloaded with powder exploded in
his face and Avery dropped from the top of the
car onto his neck. As quick as a Cal frosh could
say "O, deary me," the Axe was being passed
down a line of willing Stanford hands.
The whole thing was so fast that Bob Loof
bourow, the Axe under his sweater, walked un
touched to the rented fake camera car. The Cali
forniaris were milling around the grunting Horner,
v/ho was trying to flatten Cardinals Avery, Hill, and
Bettman.
As the car and the Axe ground away from the
curb, Miller threw the tear-gas bomb into the
mob. The mob scattered. Several enraged ani
mals from Berkeley pushed Avery into the bank.
Others had the highly original idea of following
the escaping car, but all the exits were by coin
cidence blocked by Stanford cars.
Stanford men circulated through the mob .sug
gesting that death was too good for those dirty
- from the Farm, and that everyone should
go to the Campanile to organize a search party.
With their usual objection to being led, the Berke
ley animals thought this was a wonderful idea. A
majority of the mob headed for the Campanile,
giving the Axe captors another half-hour head
start..
All six cylinders humming about the unwashed
Golden Bear, the rented car with Loofbourow and
the Axe went like hell for home. Jim Trimming
ham, '29, the driver, later said he made 62 miles
per hour through Berkeley, 73 through Oakland,
and 86 from there on in.
Fifty minutes later the Axe was back on the
Farm.
Cal was very hurl about the whole thing.
Their editor analyzed the raid as the product of
a "God-forsaken campus" which engineered "the
most carefully planned racketeer robbery in local
history, importing Chicago methods rather than
honest burglary."

Ax" for the rally. A second car went to the
Greek theater. Kropp and a companion drove to
Oakland, rented a drive-it-yourself car, and head
ed for the rally after leaving Kropp's car near the
American Trust Company. The stage was set.
One group of Stanfordit?s at the rally edged
their way close to the center. When the rally was
over they hovered solicitously near the Axe guard
ing it with their lives against any " — Stanford
men."
Another live conspirators left I he rally ten
minutes early. Taking the rented car to the door
step of the bank, they set up a camera in the
rumble seat. Others took out flashbulb equip
ment and took a stand on the bank steps. At the
entrance of the bank was Stanfordite Art Miller,
'31, equipped with an innocent expression and a
tear-gas bomb.
Soon around the corner came the black, steel
armored Studebakor. Inside was the Axe in the
ai ms of a beefy Cal athlete named Norman Horner,
v/ho had just been elected to guard it with his life.
Several carefully selected Cal men were riding
on the running boards, including carefully selected
Howard Avery, Eric Hill, Bob Loofbourow, and
Jerry Bettman of Stanford. They had been so de
termined to guard the Axe at the rally that their

California pals allowed them to ride with it as a
reward for their loyalty. They were "good guys."
Here the California ego played its inevitable
role. The freshman guards were suckers for the
fake cameramen v/ho "wanted to get a good shot",
of the Axe.
As llorner stepped from the car with the Axe,
a flashbulb overloaded with powder exploded in
his face and Avery dropped from the top of the
car onto his neck. As quick as a Cal frosh could
say "O, deary me," the Axe was being passed
down a line of willing Stanford hands.
The whole thing was so fast that Bob Loof
bourow, the Axe under his sweater, walked un
touched to the rented fake camera car. The Cali
forniaris were milling around the grunting Horner,
v/ho was trying to flatten Cardinals Avery, Hill, and
Bettman.
As the car and the Axe ground away from the
curb, Miller threw the tear-gas bomb into the
mob. The mob scattered. Several enraged ani
mals from Berkeley pushed Avery into the bank.
Others had the highly original idea of following
the escaping car, but all the exits were by coin
cidence blocked by Stanford cars.
Stanford men circulated through the mob .sug
gesting that death was too good for those dirty
- from the Farm, and that everyone should
go to the Campanile to organize a search party.
With their usual objection to being led, the Berke
ley animals thought this was a wonderful idea. A
majority of the mob headed for the Campanile,
giving the Axe captors another half-hour head
start..
All six cylinders humming about the unwashed
Golden Bear, the rented car with Loofbourow and
the Axe went like hell for home. Jim Trimming
ham, '29, the driver, later said he made 62 miles
per hour through Berkeley, 73 through Oakland,
and 86 from there on in.
Fifty minutes later the Axe was back on the
Farm.
Cal was very hurl about the whole thing.
Their editor analyzed the raid as the product of
a "God-forsaken campus" which engineered "the
most carefully planned racketeer robbery in local
history, importing Chicago methods rather than
honest burglary."
