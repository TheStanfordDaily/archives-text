Why Hcifers-for-Rolief? As the "Relief Round
up" gets under way, we of the committee would
like to present personally to Stanford the origin
and nature of this campaign.
The organization of a Heifers-for-Relief Com
mittee at Stanford has been a. spontaneous move
ment growing out of the genuine interest and con
cern of Stanford students towards taking immediate
and concrete action in regard to problems of
world relief. Starting with a small group of inter
ested students who sought to bring it before several
campus organizations as a practical project for their
action, the immediate and widespread enthusiasm
with which these groups greeted the idea led to
the natural evolution of a plan for campus-wide
action.
Organization on a cnmpus-wide basis has made

necessary a business-like system to handle the col
lection of voluntary contributions. We sincerely
hope that this machinery will in no way destroy the
spirit of unsolicited enthusiasm which has thus far
characterized "Heifers-for-Relief."
We wish to make it clear that it is not our pur
pose to coerce students in any way during this
campaign. In so far as we have been able to de
termine. individuals who will tell you of the proj
ect in your living groups will be people personally
and genuinely interested in the project. Thus, we
feel that contributions will reflect something per
haps more important than the money itselfâ€”the
realization by Stanford students that IT CON
CERNS US.
