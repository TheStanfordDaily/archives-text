### H.D. THOREAU 
We lead in Newsweek that some owners of
dogs who were in I lie K-9 Corps are now demand
ing from Congress free dog food, lifetime veterinary
care, and pensions for their demobilized pets.
The more fact Hint these owners have to ask
for the above benefits is a sad commentary on the
consciences of our legislators.
Free dog food, lifetime veterinary care, and
pensions should only be (he "first installment on
an unpayable debt" which we owe these noble
beasts.
We here at Stanford are pretty selfish if we don't
write in to Congressman Anderson and demand
education provisions and housing projects also for
these heroic animals.
At present there is an acute dog housing short
age in the country. Many l'amiles cannot live to
gether because of inadequate quarters. Other
dogs have to commute.
And do they organize and protest?
No! These unselfish friends of man bear their
disappointment in silence.
Each and every on" of us should act now to put
teeth in a G.D. Bill to relieve the injustice done
■these discharged warriors. They lead a dog's life.

Have you noticed that the Axe is not in the
Cellar any more? What's up. Cardinals?

Sunday evening we attended a plenary session
of the San Francisco Philharmonic Jazz Congress
on the floor ol the Civic Auditorium where once
stood Viacheslav Molotov, a Soviet sender.
Headlining Sunday's meeting, however, was
a Coalition made up of the Itig Three, Coleman
Hawkins, Lester Young, Buck Clayton, and four
guys named Joe.
Meade Lux Lewis played , three sets with a
piano and beat it ti-0, ti-0. Albert Frankenstein,
sporting critic on the Chronicle, was quite im
pressed with Meade Lux's strong left hand and
steady foot work.
Anti-climax of the evening came when Helen
Humes, authoress of that currently popular porno
graphic record, "Be Baba Leba," addressed the
congregation in a rather unmelodious fashion on
several rather unsavory subjects.
Majority of the members present wore the ac
cepted garb of the society, dark glasses with built
in shoulders.

the A/tecs ly Hernando Cortex more than 400 years ago. Williamson is shown examining some of the gear
he uses.

leon, "Santa Rosa," lying in 150 feet of water between Key West and Havana. The gold was stolen from

We lead in Newsweek that some owners of
dogs who were in I lie K-9 Corps are now demand
ing from Congress free dog food, lifetime veterinary
care, and pensions for their demobilized pets.
The more fact Hint these owners have to ask
for the above benefits is a sad commentary on the
consciences of our legislators.
Free dog food, lifetime veterinary care, and
pensions should only be (he "first installment on
an unpayable debt" which we owe these noble
beasts.
We here at Stanford are pretty selfish if we don't
write in to Congressman Anderson and demand
education provisions and housing projects also for
these heroic animals.
At present there is an acute dog housing short
age in the country. Many l'amiles cannot live to
gether because of inadequate quarters. Other
dogs have to commute.
And do they organize and protest?
No! These unselfish friends of man bear their
disappointment in silence.
Each and every on" of us should act now to put
teeth in a G.D. Bill to relieve the injustice done
■these discharged warriors. They lead a dog's life.

Sunday evening we attended a plenary session
of the San Francisco Philharmonic Jazz Congress
on the floor ol the Civic Auditorium where once
stood Viacheslav Molotov, a Soviet sender.
Headlining Sunday's meeting, however, was
a Coalition made up of the Itig Three, Coleman
Hawkins, Lester Young, Buck Clayton, and four
guys named Joe.
Meade Lux Lewis played , three sets with a
piano and beat it ti-0, ti-0. Albert Frankenstein,
sporting critic on the Chronicle, was quite im
pressed with Meade Lux's strong left hand and
steady foot work.
Anti-climax of the evening came when Helen
Humes, authoress of that currently popular porno
graphic record, "Be Baba Leba," addressed the
congregation in a rather unmelodious fashion on
several rather unsavory subjects.
Majority of the members present wore the ac
cepted garb of the society, dark glasses with built
in shoulders.
