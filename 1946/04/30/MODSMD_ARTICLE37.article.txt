# Farm Miner Describes Costa Rica Gold Rush
## 
### 
The Stanford Geological and
Mining Society met at the home of
Professor O. Cutler Shepard on
Wednesday evening to hear Nor
man Cleveland describe his recent
experiences at the new gold strike
in Costa Rica.
Mr. Cleveland said that gold had
been discovered in the streams of
Costa Rica about 1939 and since
that time the streams had been
worked in a small way. Until re
cently, the rich source of the gold,
ancient river channels high above
the present streams, had been over
looked. These old river channels
are now being discovered and
worked by primitive methods which
in some cases yield fabulous re
turns. One man, by hand work, re
covered 1,000 grams of gold worth
$1,000 in one day.
According to Mr. Cleveland, the
government of Costa Rica is demo

cratic. He found the people friendly
and honest. At the gold diggings a
man can have title to his claim as
long as he is actively working it.
Miners frequently leave rich claims
safe for weeks at a time by simply
placing their pick and gold pan in
evidence on their claim to signify
that the claim has not been aban
doned.
Mr. Cleveland is a Stanford min
ing engineer of wide experience.
For years he has flown his own
plane and has used this means of
travel in prospecting and in the su
pervision of his mining operations.
Dur ing the war he served as a flyer
in the Army Air Corps.
