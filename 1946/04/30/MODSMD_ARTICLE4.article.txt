# U.N. Passes Spain Probe

### 
NEW YORK, April 2!) (UP).—
The United Nations Security Coun
cil, with Russia abstaining, today
voted 10 to 0 to investigate charges
that Franco Spain threatens world
peace and a five-member subcom
mittee immediately launched what
it pledged would be a "practical
and forceful" inquiry.
A showdown ovei the use of big
power veto rights was averted at
the last minute when Russia an
nounced it would abstain from vot
ing rather than kill the investiga
tion by exercising the veto power.
The original Australian resolu
tion proposing the Spanish investi
gation was broadened at Poland's
request to include an expression of
the Council's unanimous moral
condemnation of the Franco re
gime and to set a May'3l deadline
for the investigation committee's
first report.
Soviet Delegate Andrei A. Gro
myko told the Council he was still
flatly opposed to the Australian
resolution, but said that since a
negative vote on his part would
constitute a veto he would not vote
at all. He warned, however, that his
action did not constitute a prece
dent for future controversies over
the exercise of veto power.
