# Card Poolmen Meet Treasure Isle Today
## 
### 
Stanford's undefeated, untied,
and almost unscored-upon swim
ming team is scheduled for another
outing this afternoon. Trying to
keep in trim, the locals have re
scheduled the Treasure Island pool
team, for there is a definite scarcity
of teams in the Bay Area that feel
daring enough to mix with the
Farm squad.
TRIO BATTLES WATCHES
Bob Anderson, Harry Borchers,
and Don Hester, Stanford's big
three in the free style, back stroke,
and breast stroke respectively, will
as usual be battling the docker's
watch rather than any real compe
tition. These three and sundry
other Stanfords—who would be by
far outstanding on any other team
on the coast—have already trounced
the sailors.
Other satellites — who could be
deities in their own right—on the
aggregation are Dick Narver, Clint
Eastman, Roy Rule, and Jim Aim
strong. They will contribute their
usual share of "depth" points —
those added first- and second-place
dibits that often make the differ

ence between victory and defeat.
WHERE ARE THE DIVERS?
Stanford's only weakness as it
has shown up thus far this season
is in the diving department. The
coaching staff evidently didn't think
enough of the quality of the spring
board men to carry them on the
Southern California trip. It was for
this reason (and the fact that Stan
ford could only enter two men in
races for which three place points
were awarded) that U.S.C. and
U.C.L.A. were able to score at aH.
But there isn't an exhibition only
tomorrow at the pool. Any day
that the team is practicing, an on
looker can get his share of the
excitement. For Tom Raynie, con
vinced that he has one of Stan
ford's greatest teams, provides a
show in himself. He runs up and
down the pool, stop-watch in hand,
yelling to his churning charges.
ALWAYS THEY IMPROVE
When they finish their stint, it is
not often that the coach and every
one else is usually satisfied, for the
boys seem to improve every time
they dive into the pool.—S.M.

U.C.L.A. were able to score at aH.

yelling to his churning charges.
ALWAYS THEY IMPROVE

one else is usually satisfied, for the
boys seem to improve every time
they dive into the pool.—S.M.
