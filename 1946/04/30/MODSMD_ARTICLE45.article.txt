# Union Charges Filed at Club
## 
### 
BOSTON, April 29 (UP). —The
American Baseball Guild made its
first bid for nationwide recognition
today by filing charges against the
Washington Senators and their
owner Clark Griffiith for allegedly
engaging in unfair labor practices.
Robert Murphy, labor relations
director of the new union for pro
fessional baseball players, an
nounced that the charges had
been filed in the fifth regional
office of the National Labor Rela
tions Board in Baltimore, Md.
That olTice has jurisdiction in
Washington.
The union's charge declared that
the Senators and especially Owner
Griffith made "statements deroga
tory to the American Baseball
Guild. . . . did counsel and urge
the players against joining the guild
and further, did make statements
calculated to intimidate and coerce
the players on the club from exer
cising their rights to self-organiza
tion."
The charge grew out of an in
vestigation of all major league
teams, Murphy said. He said some
Washington players belong to the
union, but declined to name them.
This action by the independent
labor group followed a strongly
worded attack against the union de
livered by Griffith himself. Declar
ing himself strongly opposed to the
union, he said:
"Such a move would destroy the
reserve clause—that's the crux of
the situation. It would wreck base
ball, knock it fiat on its face. What
these organizers call 'freedom of
contract,' giving the player the right
to sign with any team of his choice,
would be fatal. There wouldn't be
any big leagues or little leagues
either."
Murphy said he had overwhelm
ing proof that the Washington
club was interfering with its play
ers' right to bargain collectively,
as guaranteed under the Wagner
Act. However, he refused to out
line any of his evidence, saying
only that it would be presented
eventually to the NLRB.
No similar action is planned
against other clubs at this time,
Murphy said.
The next step, he said, is up to
the Baltimore office of the Labor
Relations Board which will investi
gate the guild charges and decide
whether they merit a hearing. If so,
the hearing will be scheduled—
probably within a month—at Balti
more.
If the NLRB finds that unfair la
bor practices do exist, it has the
authority to order the baseball club
to cease such practices.

Act. However, he refused to out
line any of his evidence, saying
only that it would be presented
eventually to the NLRB.
No similar action is planned
against other clubs at this time,
Murphy said.
The next step, he said, is up to
the Baltimore office of the Labor
Relations Board which will investi
gate the guild charges and decide
whether they merit a hearing. If so,
the hearing will be scheduled—
probably within a month—at Balti
more.
If the NLRB finds that unfair la
bor practices do exist, it has the
authority to order the baseball club
to cease such practices.
BOSTON, April 29 (UP). —The
American Baseball Guild made its
first bid for nationwide recognition
today by filing charges against the
Washington Senators and their
owner Clark Griffiith for allegedly
engaging in unfair labor practices.
Robert Murphy, labor relations
director of the new union for pro
fessional baseball players, an
nounced that the charges had
been filed in the fifth regional
office of the National Labor Rela
tions Board in Baltimore, Md.
That olTice has jurisdiction in
Washington.
The union's charge declared that
the Senators and especially Owner
Griffith made "statements deroga
tory to the American Baseball
Guild. . . . did counsel and urge
the players against joining the guild
and further, did make statements
calculated to intimidate and coerce
the players on the club from exer
cising their rights to self-organiza
tion."
The charge grew out of an in
vestigation of all major league
teams, Murphy said. He said some
Washington players belong to the
union, but declined to name them.
This action by the independent
labor group followed a strongly
worded attack against the union de
livered by Griffith himself. Declar
ing himself strongly opposed to the
union, he said:
"Such a move would destroy the
reserve clause—that's the crux of
the situation. It would wreck base
ball, knock it fiat on its face. What
these organizers call 'freedom of
contract,' giving the player the right
to sign with any team of his choice,
would be fatal. There wouldn't be
any big leagues or little leagues
either."
Murphy said he had overwhelm
ing proof that the Washington
club was interfering with its play
ers' right to bargain collectively,
as guaranteed under the Wagner
Act. However, he refused to out
line any of his evidence, saying
only that it would be presented
eventually to the NLRB.
No similar action is planned
against other clubs at this time,
Murphy said.
The next step, he said, is up to
the Baltimore office of the Labor
Relations Board which will investi
gate the guild charges and decide
whether they merit a hearing. If so,
the hearing will be scheduled—
probably within a month—at Balti
more.

bor practices do exist, it has the
authority to order the baseball club
to cease such practices.
