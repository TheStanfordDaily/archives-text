# Roble Leads In Softball
## 
### MINNIE A. HUSSAH (Special to The Daily 
With two weeks of gruelling soft
! ball experience tucked neatly un
j der their chins, the girls' intramural
j league continues into its third round
! of action-packed baseball. The girls
j have been taking the game very se
! riously, and although Harry Wol
j ters hasn't recognized any varsity
I caliber talent performing in the
j feminine circuit, definite improve
: ment has been noted by several ma
] jor league scouts.
In the Tuesday League, Roble
3C is leading the race with two
j wins and nary a loss. Storey
House is closely trailing with one
victory. Today Madrona plays
Storey in what should prove to be
a game filled with drama, tense
ness* and action. Starting pitch
ers haven't been announced at
press time, but a lot of Sloan's
Liniment has been used in an at
\ tempt to liven up the (lingers'
arms.
i The league-leading 3Cers of Ro
ble take on the 3Aers of the same
j institution in another Tuesday
League game to be played on
Tuesday. Adelpha, which many
I think to be a potentially power
| house outfit, draws a bye this week.
And the Adelphians are taking ad
i vantage of the "breather" by sharp
j ening up their batting, and imprrfv
j ing their fielding.
Eucalypto and Branner are tied
in the Wednesday League with
two wins apiece. Cubberly and
Granada trail closely with one
victory respectively. The Euca
lypto Yankees play the Cubberly
Giants on Wednesday. Another
top contest pits the Branner star
| studded nine against Granada.
This game will be of particular
t interest to some, because both
teams have agreed to abide faith
fully by the "no-spitball rule."
In the final contest in the Wednes
day circuit, Russell team runs into
the maidens of 3 Center Roble. Ja
nie R., the cute batgirl, will be on
hand for the hotly fought fracas if
| personal appearance engagements
| don't interfere. Even if Janie can't
jbe at the game personally, she
! promises to give her moral support.
In the Thursday League. Union,
pace-setter with two wins, meets
I the combined efforts of 1A and 2A
of Roble. Lathrop and Hurlburt,
! now tied for second position with
! one victory chalked up on the
ledger, run into each other in
i what might prove to be the out
! standing game of the day. All
spring holdouts have finally inked
[ their contracts, and both teams
! should be at top strength for the
game.
Ventura draws a well-earned bye
| in the Thursday League, and there-
I fore will not see action on Thurs-
I day.

ble take on the 3Aers of the same
j institution in another Tuesday
League game to be played on
Tuesday. Adelpha, which many
I think to be a potentially power
| house outfit, draws a bye this week.
And the Adelphians are taking ad
i vantage of the "breather" by sharp
j ening up their batting, and imprrfv
j ing their fielding.
Eucalypto and Branner are tied
in the Wednesday League with
two wins apiece. Cubberly and
Granada trail closely with one
victory respectively. The Euca
lypto Yankees play the Cubberly
Giants on Wednesday. Another
top contest pits the Branner star
| studded nine against Granada.
This game will be of particular
t interest to some, because both
teams have agreed to abide faith
fully by the "no-spitball rule."
In the final contest in the Wednes
day circuit, Russell team runs into
the maidens of 3 Center Roble. Ja
nie R., the cute batgirl, will be on
hand for the hotly fought fracas if
| personal appearance engagements
| don't interfere. Even if Janie can't
jbe at the game personally, she
! promises to give her moral support.
In the Thursday League. Union,
pace-setter with two wins, meets
I the combined efforts of 1A and 2A
of Roble. Lathrop and Hurlburt,
! now tied for second position with
! one victory chalked up on the
ledger, run into each other in
i what might prove to be the out
! standing game of the day. All
spring holdouts have finally inked
[ their contracts, and both teams
! should be at top strength for the
game.
Ventura draws a well-earned bye
| in the Thursday League, and there-
I fore will not see action on Thurs-
I day.
With two weeks of gruelling soft
! ball experience tucked neatly un
j der their chins, the girls' intramural
j league continues into its third round

j have been taking the game very se

j ters hasn't recognized any varsity
I caliber talent performing in the
j feminine circuit, definite improve
: ment has been noted by several ma
] jor league scouts.
In the Tuesday League, Roble
3C is leading the race with two
j wins and nary a loss. Storey
House is closely trailing with one
victory. Today Madrona plays
Storey in what should prove to be
a game filled with drama, tense
ness* and action. Starting pitch
ers haven't been announced at
press time, but a lot of Sloan's
Liniment has been used in an at
\ tempt to liven up the (lingers'
arms.
