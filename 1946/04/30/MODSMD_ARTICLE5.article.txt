# Housing Crisis Beyond State
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. April 29 (UP)
â€”Gov. Earl Warren was on record
today with a statement that his ad
ministration could do little to case
the "terrible and distressing" vet
erans' housing crisis in California
because the problem was the prime
responsibility of the federal gov
ernment.
Warren, in a speech before the
American Legion at a two-day con
ference here, said the state already
had appropriated $12,500,000 for
housing but that new construction
could not start until more material
was available.
