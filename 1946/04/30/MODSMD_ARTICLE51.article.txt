Present disappearance of the
Stanford Axe brings recollections of
the hatchet-stealing incident that
was broken up by the coppers last
year.
Ted Kenfield and Roger Harding,
Berkeley pigskinners both, decided
to forget classes for one day at the
Cal plant, and headed for Stanford
for an axe-stealing mission. They
got the wood-chopping instrument
jut of the Cellar okey, but were ap
prehended by "John Law" on their
dash back to the home institution.
Since Stanford and the State U.
have an agreement to bar stu
dents from extra-curricular ac
tivities if they get messed up in
some sort of ambitious scheme to
lay sticky fingers on the Axe,
Kenfield and Harding were both
barred from competing in football
for the first part of the season.
An immediate moan went up by
the moaning Cal student body,
claiming that since Stanford was out
of the gridiron picture for the sea
son, it was ridiculous to slap a sen
tence on the two misguided ath
letes. Cal officials, however, kept a
saner head about the whole affair,
and stuck to their guns.
Roger Harding then decided to
quit cjdleg'c, and soon inked a pro
contract. Richfield sat out the sus
pension and appeared in the Blue
and Gold lineup the latter part of
the season. Since the assemblage
of Berkeley football material was
so poor to begin with, his appear
ance on the roster had little visi
ble effect on California's football
endeavors for the season.

Nominations for tiie biggest flop
on the sports sccnc in 1!)46 are be
ginning to roll in. A good candidate
for the "award" right now is the
Portland baseball club. Expected to
pull a repeat of their pennant-win
ning antics of last season, the
"Ducks" are floundering about in
second division right now.
Of course, it's really too early
iu the season to present the Lucky
Lager-owned club with the crown
right away. but if they don't snap
out of their early season lethargic
condition, they're a sure bet not
to climb much higher than the
spot they're in now.
Marv Owen's ,club has a pretty
fair pitching staff, but their club

work has been so poor that they
probably couldn't hit volleyballs if
they were rolled down a lane. It
they catch their batting eye, watch
out. If they don't, play your pennies
for either a Seals or Los Angeles
win.

With the Cardinal swimmers slat
ed to paddle against the Treasure
Island team this afternoon, Stan
fordites are afforded their first
chance to see the championship
bound team perform. Conquering
the sailors in a previous meet, the
Indians are rated top-favorites to
pull a repeat.
On Friday afternoon, the Tom
Haynie-led crew meet the Olympic
Club in San Francisco in a return
engagement. And the following day
Cal comes to the Farm to take a
drubbing in the swimming depart
ment.

Nominations for tiie biggest flop
on the sports sccnc in 1!)46 are be
ginning to roll in. A good candidate
for the "award" right now is the
Portland baseball club. Expected to
pull a repeat of their pennant-win
ning antics of last season, the
"Ducks" are floundering about in
second division right now.
Of course, it's really too early
iu the season to present the Lucky
Lager-owned club with the crown
right away. but if they don't snap
out of their early season lethargic
condition, they're a sure bet not
to climb much higher than the
spot they're in now.
Marv Owen's ,club has a pretty
fair pitching staff, but their club

work has been so poor that they
probably couldn't hit volleyballs if
they were rolled down a lane. It
they catch their batting eye, watch
out. If they don't, play your pennies
for either a Seals or Los Angeles
win.

With the Cardinal swimmers slat
ed to paddle against the Treasure
Island team this afternoon, Stan
fordites are afforded their first
chance to see the championship
bound team perform. Conquering
the sailors in a previous meet, the
Indians are rated top-favorites to
pull a repeat.
On Friday afternoon, the Tom
Haynie-led crew meet the Olympic
Club in San Francisco in a return
engagement. And the following day
Cal comes to the Farm to take a
drubbing in the swimming depart
ment.
Present disappearance of the
Stanford Axe brings recollections of
the hatchet-stealing incident that
was broken up by the coppers last
year.
Ted Kenfield and Roger Harding,
Berkeley pigskinners both, decided
to forget classes for one day at the
Cal plant, and headed for Stanford
for an axe-stealing mission. They
got the wood-chopping instrument
jut of the Cellar okey, but were ap
prehended by "John Law" on their
dash back to the home institution.
Since Stanford and the State U.
have an agreement to bar stu
dents from extra-curricular ac
tivities if they get messed up in
some sort of ambitious scheme to
lay sticky fingers on the Axe,
Kenfield and Harding were both
barred from competing in football
for the first part of the season.
An immediate moan went up by
the moaning Cal student body,
claiming that since Stanford was out
of the gridiron picture for the sea
son, it was ridiculous to slap a sen
tence on the two misguided ath
letes. Cal officials, however, kept a
saner head about the whole affair,
and stuck to their guns.
Roger Harding then decided to
quit cjdleg'c, and soon inked a pro
contract. Richfield sat out the sus
pension and appeared in the Blue
and Gold lineup the latter part of
the season. Since the assemblage
of Berkeley football material was
so poor to begin with, his appear
ance on the roster had little visi
ble effect on California's football
endeavors for the season.
