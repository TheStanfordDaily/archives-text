# 'Big Meet' To Be Changed To Cal Track
## 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
The three-ring circus — including
the Big Meet—that was originally
scheduled for the Farm on June 1
has been shifted to California, it
was announced by BAC Publicity
Manager Don Lievendorfer yester
day.
Primary reason for the shift,
which will send the golf and base
ball teams to Berkeley that week
end, was the lack of facilities for
handling a Big Meet crowd at An
gell Field.
■ Inasmuch as it is the policy of the
two schools to wind up the athletic
activities at the end of the school
year on one or another of campuses,
the entire program for the day was
shifted along with the Big Meet.
Angell Field, .as neat a track plant
as is available anywhere from the
participants' point of view, is not
nearly so ideal from the angle of
the spectator, inasmuch as a mere
2500 can be accommodated.
Roughly speaking, there are
about 40.000 Cal alumni and 10,000
Farm alumni in the Bay Area, and
14,000 students at Berkeley and 5,000
at Stanford, and it is possible—al
though far from plausible — that
these 61).000 or so people have a
spouse, offspring or acquaintance
who would be eager to accompany
an old Grad or pupil to the meet.
To return to the sublime, how
ever, the largest Big Meet crowd
ever assembled was about 17.000
which can be squeezed into Cal's
Edwards Field, but by no stretch of
imagination could anywhere near
that figure be placed on the Angell
Field sidelines.
As to the question of renovating
the Stadium track for the meet, two
things are against it. First, it would
cost more than the BAC has avail
able to get the woodgrown cinder
track in shape for just one meet,
and secondly, 15,000 people would
get lost in that cavernous bowl.
Another factor involved is that if
one of the teams was overwhelm
ingly stronger than the other, in
terest in this first Big Meet in sev
eral years would not be as strong as
it is in the outcome of the clash be
tween two squads that have left
much to be desired in their per
formances.
The two squads are so evenly
matched at present that it is quite
conceivable that the meet will not
be decided until the final event, the
mile relay.
Along with the Big Meet, the ten
nis matches have already been
scheduled for Cal June 1, the
changes in the program will bring
Cal's golf team here the 25th, and
Stanford invades Berkeley the 31st.
Baseball will be played here the
30th, and the Indians will play at
Cal on June first.

the Stadium track for the meet, two
things are against it. First, it would
cost more than the BAC has avail
able to get the woodgrown cinder
track in shape for just one meet,
and secondly, 15,000 people would
get lost in that cavernous bowl.
Another factor involved is that if
one of the teams was overwhelm
ingly stronger than the other, in
terest in this first Big Meet in sev
eral years would not be as strong as
it is in the outcome of the clash be
tween two squads that have left
much to be desired in their per
formances.
The two squads are so evenly
matched at present that it is quite
conceivable that the meet will not
be decided until the final event, the
mile relay.
Along with the Big Meet, the ten
nis matches have already been
scheduled for Cal June 1, the
changes in the program will bring
Cal's golf team here the 25th, and
Stanford invades Berkeley the 31st.
Baseball will be played here the
30th, and the Indians will play at
Cal on June first.
The three-ring circus — including
the Big Meet—that was originally
scheduled for the Farm on June 1
has been shifted to California, it
was announced by BAC Publicity
Manager Don Lievendorfer yester
day.
Primary reason for the shift,
which will send the golf and base
ball teams to Berkeley that week
end, was the lack of facilities for
handling a Big Meet crowd at An
gell Field.
■ Inasmuch as it is the policy of the
two schools to wind up the athletic
activities at the end of the school
year on one or another of campuses,
the entire program for the day was
shifted along with the Big Meet.
Angell Field, .as neat a track plant
as is available anywhere from the
participants' point of view, is not
nearly so ideal from the angle of
the spectator, inasmuch as a mere
2500 can be accommodated.
Roughly speaking, there are
about 40.000 Cal alumni and 10,000
Farm alumni in the Bay Area, and
14,000 students at Berkeley and 5,000
at Stanford, and it is possible—al
though far from plausible — that
these 61).000 or so people have a
spouse, offspring or acquaintance
who would be eager to accompany
an old Grad or pupil to the meet.
To return to the sublime, how
ever, the largest Big Meet crowd
ever assembled was about 17.000
which can be squeezed into Cal's
Edwards Field, but by no stretch of
imagination could anywhere near
that figure be placed on the Angell
Field sidelines.

the Stadium track for the meet, two
