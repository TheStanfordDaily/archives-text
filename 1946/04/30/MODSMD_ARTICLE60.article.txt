CHANGCHUN. April 1!) (UP).
—Thirty thousand veteran Com
munist troops captured Chang
chun today after blasting Nation
alist defenders out of their last
six strongholds in the center of
the city last night.
I watchcd the battle with bullets
whining past my ears, first from the
Nationalist side of the lines and
then from the Communist side.
The 9,000 Nationalist troops in
this Manchurian capital were
outnumbered three to one. They
were overwhelmed in six days of
bloody street and housetop fight
ing that started when the Rus
sians withdrew.
COMMUNISTS EFFICIENT
The Communists wore uniforms
that were ragged and patched, but
they were heavily armed, battle
wise, and efficient. They fought
with Japanese and American Win
chester lilies while their 75- and
37-millimeter guns pulverized the
Nationalists' final redoubt in Uto
pia Circle, the inner plaza of the
city.
The Communist force included
both Fourth and Eighth Route
Army veterans under command of
the top Communist military leader,
Gen. Li Piao.
First they seized three outlying
airfields to prevent Nationalist
reinforcements from arriving.
Next they took the city's only
railroad station so they could
bring in their own reinforcements
from the north.
ENTER CHANGCHUN
Then they steamrollered into
Changchun from four directions,
smashing through the city's inner
defenses and hurling defenders into
a pocket in Utopia Circle, the hub
from which the city's main avenues
radiate.
Jammed into the Circle like sar
dines, the Nationalists converted six
public buildings into makeshift re
doubts. They stuffed windows with
old books, municipal records, pieces
of furniture, and palm-fiber sand
bags.
The buildings included the Cen
tral Bank, the city hall, the police
station, the radio center, the tele
phone building, and the former
headquarters of Gen. Fedor Karlov,
former Russian commandant at

Changchun.
AWAIT FIRST ARMY
From these makeshift fortresses
ringing Utopia Circle they hoped
to hold out until the Nationalist
new First Army could get here
from Szcpingkai and lift the siege.
But the Communists blasted them
out within Iwo days.
As the fortress buildings fell one
by one, the defending Nationalists
were forced out into the open
spaces of Utopia Circle, more than i
1,000 feet across. Here they were ,
mowed down by machine-gun and I
rifle fire or taken prisoner.
All six of the buildings were
taken by the Communists Thurs
day afternoon and evening (April
18). The police station was the

first to fall. Then the city hall,
pounded for hours by artillery
from the cast and west, went up
| in flames.
CENTRAL BANK FALLS
The last to fall was the Central
j Bank, headquarters of the Nation
j alist commander, Maj. Gen. Chen
Chia-tsen.
The bank, garrisoned by 1.500
Nationalists, surrendered at !)
p.m. yesterday and the battle for
Changchun, city of 800,000 inhab
itants, was over.
The victory was most important
' strategically as well as politically,
! since it cuts off Central Govern
| ment forces from the rest of north
j ern Manchuria, including Harbin
I and Tsitsihar.


DISAPPOINTMENT —After six months of Chinese rule, citizens of
Formosa believe Jap bondage was better than Chinese "liberation."
Island is reported stripped by Chinese of rice, sugar, and coal, and
modern improvements have been impeded. Here, a Formosan woman
works all day scooping water from irrigation ditch into rice paddy by
means of a bamboo basket hung on a tripod.
