# American, Russian Scientists Building Super Atom Smashers
## 
### ROGER A. JOHNSON 
BERKELEY, April 30 (UP). —Dr. Ernest Orlando Lawrence,
Nobel prize winner whose laboratory achievements contributed
heavily to development of the atomic bomb, tonight announced j
invention of the synchroton, a powerful new type of atom
smasher that may revolutionize American research in nuclear
fission.
The synchroton, conceived independently by a Soviet and
an American scientist, is under construction at the University of
California. At the same time, it was disclosed that a synchroton
of smaller size was being built in Russia.
This new machine was expected to open new, unexplored
worlds of atomic experimentation. It will enable scientists for the
first time, to study mesotrons, the particles which are believed to
constitute the binding force, or cement, of atomic nuclei—the
basic material of the universe.
The University of California synchroton, scheduled for com
pletion early next year, will accelerate electrons to energies of
300,000,000 electron volts, three times ihat of the existing models
to the next largest atom smasher, the hetatron.
At that tremendous velocity, atom-smashing will "mount a
new threshhold," Lawrence said. It may be possible, instead of
splitting the nucleus, to split the particles of the nucleus, such

A3 protons and neutrons.
A 300-million electron volt electron is itself a cosmic ray.
Particles traveling at that speed will produce cosmic ray show
ers, such as occur in nature, of equal energy, Lawrence said.
"With particles of these energies," said Lawrence, "it will
be possible to study cosmic rays, or mesotrons. The understand
ing of mesotrons is considered to be of the utmost importance in
learning about the fundamental nuclear forces. Mesotrons, which
constantly bombard the earth at energies up to billions of elec-,
tron volts, can be studied at present only on nature's terms."
The synchroton is being built with the assistance of the Man
hattan district, the War Department's over-all atomic bomb
project.
It was developed by Prof. Edwin M. McMillan, co-discoverer
with Dr. P. H. Abelson of Neptunium (Element 93). Neptunium is
the unstable element derived from the fission of uranium U-235
particles, and which converts into Plutonium—basic element of
the atomic bomb.
Lawrence, pioneer in atom smashing and research for chain
reaction, said the principle of the synchroton was "as important
a development in atom-smashing as was the cyclotron." Law
rence supervised construction at Berkeley of one of the world's
first practical atom smashers.

The idea of the synchroton was proposed independently by
Prof. McMillan and by V. Veksler of the Lebedev Physical Insti
tute of the Academy of Sciences, Moscow, U.S.S.R.
Veksler's theories, according to Lawrence's announcement,
were published in Russia before McMillan's first article on the
subject was issued in the Physical Review last September. But
the Russian publications were not known to Prof. McMillan until
two months after he sent his articles to the Physical Review.
V/hile hfc was assigned from the University of California
atomic bomb factory at Los Alamos, N. M., McMillan formulated
his theory of "phase stability"—the basic theory of the synchro
ton. This principle, carried out in the synchroton, will enable
atomic scientists to circumvent limitations imposed by the theory
of relativity on the energies which can be reached in the accel
eration of particles.
"It will make it possible to march projectiles around a circular
oibit an indefinite number of times, always arriving at a given
point exactly on time to receive an acceleration push. Thus the
tendency of particles to lag behind and arrive at the point too
late to be pushed will be overcome. Atomic projectiles will be
accelerated to much higher energies than has been possible
heretofore," the announcement said.
McMillan left for Los Alamos Sept. 1945, returning to Berke-:

ley. It was not until mid-October that the first journal containing
one of Veksler's articles became available to the Los Alamos
library.
"In the March 1946 issue of the Physical Review, Vekslc-r
has a letter stating that he is supervising the construction of a
30 million volt synchroton," the Lawrence announcement said.
This was 270,000,000 volts less than the McMillan model.

V/hile hfc was assigned from the University of California
atomic bomb factory at Los Alamos, N. M., McMillan formulated
his theory of "phase stability"—the basic theory of the synchro
ton. This principle, carried out in the synchroton, will enable
atomic scientists to circumvent limitations imposed by the theory
of relativity on the energies which can be reached in the accel
eration of particles.
"It will make it possible to march projectiles around a circular
oibit an indefinite number of times, always arriving at a given
point exactly on time to receive an acceleration push. Thus the
tendency of particles to lag behind and arrive at the point too

accelerated to much higher energies than has been possible
heretofore," the announcement said.

BERKELEY, April 30 (UP). —Dr. Ernest Orlando Lawrence,
Nobel prize winner whose laboratory achievements contributed
heavily to development of the atomic bomb, tonight announced j
invention of the synchroton, a powerful new type of atom
smasher that may revolutionize American research in nuclear
fission.
The synchroton, conceived independently by a Soviet and
an American scientist, is under construction at the University of
California. At the same time, it was disclosed that a synchroton
of smaller size was being built in Russia.
This new machine was expected to open new, unexplored
worlds of atomic experimentation. It will enable scientists for the
first time, to study mesotrons, the particles which are believed to
constitute the binding force, or cement, of atomic nuclei—the
basic material of the universe.
The University of California synchroton, scheduled for com
pletion early next year, will accelerate electrons to energies of
300,000,000 electron volts, three times ihat of the existing models
to the next largest atom smasher, the hetatron.
At that tremendous velocity, atom-smashing will "mount a
new threshhold," Lawrence said. It may be possible, instead of
splitting the nucleus, to split the particles of the nucleus, such

A3 protons and neutrons.
A 300-million electron volt electron is itself a cosmic ray.
Particles traveling at that speed will produce cosmic ray show
ers, such as occur in nature, of equal energy, Lawrence said.
"With particles of these energies," said Lawrence, "it will
be possible to study cosmic rays, or mesotrons. The understand
ing of mesotrons is considered to be of the utmost importance in
learning about the fundamental nuclear forces. Mesotrons, which
constantly bombard the earth at energies up to billions of elec-,
tron volts, can be studied at present only on nature's terms."
The synchroton is being built with the assistance of the Man
hattan district, the War Department's over-all atomic bomb
project.
It was developed by Prof. Edwin M. McMillan, co-discoverer
with Dr. P. H. Abelson of Neptunium (Element 93). Neptunium is
the unstable element derived from the fission of uranium U-235
particles, and which converts into Plutonium—basic element of
the atomic bomb.
Lawrence, pioneer in atom smashing and research for chain
reaction, said the principle of the synchroton was "as important
a development in atom-smashing as was the cyclotron." Law
rence supervised construction at Berkeley of one of the world's
first practical atom smashers.
