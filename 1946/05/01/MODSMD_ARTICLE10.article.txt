# Fair Deal Department â€”Cyclotron for Axe
## 
### 
In reporting the theft of the
Axe in its Monday edition, the
Daily California!) erred in stating
that all six men who stole the
Axe wore Stanford jackets. Only
two wore Stanford jackets.
Meanwhile, it was rumored that
Stanford roughs would celebrate
May Day today by stealing the
University of California's cyclo
tron.
