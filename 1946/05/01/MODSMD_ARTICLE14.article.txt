â€”A shell exploded in a sailor's arms
today while the U.S.S. Solar, a de
stroyer escort, was unloading am
munition here and the subsequent
explosion of its powder magazine
sank the ship and inflicted a toll of
five missing and believed dead and
approximately I(JS injured.
A small hole was blown in the side
of the steel pier and a few of its sup
porting girders were knocked out. A
freight car and two trucks, all partly
filled with ammunition, blew up. A
Navy fire truck sprayed water on the
fire that broke out on the pier and
brought it under control.
