# Entry for 100,000 Jews Into Palestine Proposed By Joint Inquiry Group
## Arabs Will Resist Jewish 'Invasion'; League to Meet 
### 
JERUSALEM, April 30 (UP).
â€”An Arab spokesman said to
night that Arabs would regard
the admission of 100,000 Jews
to Palestine as recommended
by the Anglo-American inguiry
report as an invasion to be com
batted in the same way that
CJreat Britain prepared to battle
German invaders in 1940.
Palestine Jews retorted that ihey
were ready for any test.
Tempers were rising among Arabs
and Jews alike but British authori
ties, with 100,000 troops ready to
move to any part of the country in
case of outbreaks, predicted there
would be no serious uprising by
either side as the result of the com
mission's report.
Auni Bey Abdul Hadi, a member
of the Palestine Arab higher com
mittee, disclosed that the powerful
Arab League would meet at once to
consider the report.
"Our reaction will not be words,"
he said. '"Should Britain and the
United States adopt the commis
sion's recommendations Arabs will
feel that the western democracies
ha% r c failed to achieve justice and
they will be bound to look for jus
tice wherever they can find it.
"First we shall fall back on our
own energies in Palestine and the
whole Arab world. We shall not in
voke diplomatic channels when di
plomacy fails but will resort to the
natural instinct of self defense to
which every nation is entitled."
Abdul Hadi said he believed the
commission was influenced in its de
cision mainly by President Truman's
request to Prime Minister Clement
R. Attlee th;it 100,000 Jews be ad
mitted.
