# Jewish National Home Idea Rejected; Committee Advises All United Nations To Drop Bars to Europe Immigrants
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 30 (UP).—The Anglo-American inquiry
committee tonight issued an explosive-packed report recom
mending admission of 100,000 Jews to Palestine but rejecting the
concept of a Jewish national home in the Holyland.
It proposed instead that all the United Nations drop their

► immigration bars temporarily for
, Europe's homeless millions.
The 15,000-word document, pre
pared after 120 days of exhaustive
investigation in Eu r "ue and the
Middle East, offered a compromise
solution of the Palestine problem for
acceptance or rejection by the Amer
ican and British governments.
It sidestepped the burning question
! of what to do with perhaps 1,000,000
European Jews now clamoring for
admission to Palestine, recommend -
ing as a temporary expedient that:
entry certificates be granted as soon
as possible to 100,000 of the most
despez - ate refugees.
ZIONIST DEMANDS MET
The later proposal was in line with
the demands of Zionist groups, as
v/as a subsidiary recommendation
calling for abolition of the anti-
Semitic lahd laws in Palestine.
But by its over-all provisions it
| was viewed as a down-the-middlc
j compromise which throws the whole
i Arab-Jewish controversy back into
the lap of the British government
| and, ultimately, of the United Nu
! tions.
It envisaged the eventual cstab
| lishment; of an internationally-con
i trolled state in which neither Arab
j nor Jew would dominate and in
J which the age-old hostility between
! the two factions would be dissipated
t through higher educational and eco-
I nomic standards.
BITTER CRITICISM
Even before its official publication,
: the report evoked bitter critici:.tu
j from both sides. Arab spokesmen in
j Jerusalem denounced the proposed
, admission of 100,000 Jews as an in-
I vitation to civjl war, and Jewish
j leaders retorted angrily that they
j were ready to meet force with force.
In obvious anticipation of just
that reception, the committee eon
! eluded its report with the unequivo
| cal recommendation that the Anglo-
American governments .stand ready
| to suppress ruthlessly any violence
or terrorism by either side.
The report was released siinulta-
j neously here and in London.
President Truman expressed im
: mediate satisfaction with it, particu
larly the provision calling for entry
of 100.000 Jews into the Holy Land
j and those aimed at protection of
] Arab civil and religious rights.
REPORT UNDER ADVISEMENT
He said he would take the entire
! report under advisement and indi
' cated that no definite American com-
J mitment would be made on it until
! it has been studied thoroughly.
Congressional reaction was mixed.
Chairman Sol Bloom (D., N. Y.) of
i the House Foreign Affairs Commit
! tec, hailed it as a long step toward
j permanent solution of the Palestine
problem.
But Rep. Emanuel Celler (D., N.
Y.) attacked the report as "a most
dismaying document" which "dis
| played a shocking disregard of
j facts."
| Celler said only the proposals to
j admit 100.000 Jews to Palestine and
1 to abolish the land regulations wore
j helpful to the Jewish refugee prob-
I lem.
The report emphasized from the
| outset that Palestine could not offer
! "substantial assistance" in finding
| homes for the stateless Jewish vie
i tims of Nazi and Fascist persecution
: who wish to leave Europe or are im
! polled to do so. It held that final
' solution of the refugee problem, as
well as of the racial war with Pales
| tine itself, is a matter for all the
I United Nations.

WASHINGTON, April 30 (UP).—The Anglo-American inquiry
committee tonight issued an explosive-packed report recom
mending admission of 100,000 Jews to Palestine but rejecting the
concept of a Jewish national home in the Holyland.
It proposed instead that all the United Nations drop their

► immigration bars temporarily for
, Europe's homeless millions.
The 15,000-word document, pre
pared after 120 days of exhaustive
investigation in Eu r "ue and the
Middle East, offered a compromise
solution of the Palestine problem for
acceptance or rejection by the Amer
ican and British governments.
It sidestepped the burning question
! of what to do with perhaps 1,000,000
European Jews now clamoring for
admission to Palestine, recommend -
ing as a temporary expedient that:
entry certificates be granted as soon
as possible to 100,000 of the most
despez - ate refugees.
ZIONIST DEMANDS MET
The later proposal was in line with
the demands of Zionist groups, as
v/as a subsidiary recommendation
