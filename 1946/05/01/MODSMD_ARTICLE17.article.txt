# Jewish National Home Idea Rejected; Committee Advises All United Nations To Drop Bars to Europe Immigrants

### 
WASHINGTON, April 30 (UP).—The Anglo-American inquiry
committee tonight issued an explosive-packed report recom
mending admission of 100,000 Jews to Palestine but rejecting the
concept of a Jewish national home in the Holyland.
It proposed instead that all the United Nations drop their

► immigration bars temporarily for
, Europe's homeless millions.
The 15,000-word document, pre
pared after 120 days of exhaustive
investigation in Eu r "ue and the
Middle East, offered a compromise
solution of the Palestine problem for
acceptance or rejection by the Amer
ican and British governments.
It sidestepped the burning question
! of what to do with perhaps 1,000,000
European Jews now clamoring for
admission to Palestine, recommend -
ing as a temporary expedient that:
entry certificates be granted as soon
as possible to 100,000 of the most
despez - ate refugees.
ZIONIST DEMANDS MET
The later proposal was in line with
the demands of Zionist groups, as
v/as a subsidiary recommendation
calling for abolition of the anti-
Semitic lahd laws in Palestine.
But by its over-all provisions it
| was viewed as a down-the-middlc
j compromise which throws the whole
i Arab-Jewish controversy back into
the lap of the British government
| and, ultimately, of the United Nu
! tions.
It envisaged the eventual cstab
| lishment; of an internationally-con
i trolled state in which neither Arab
j nor Jew would dominate and in
J which the age-old hostility between
! the two factions would be dissipated
t through higher educational and eco-
I nomic standards.
BITTER CRITICISM
Even before its official publication,
: the report evoked bitter critici:.tu
j from both sides. Arab spokesmen in
j Jerusalem denounced the proposed
, admission of 100,000 Jews as an in-
I vitation to civjl war, and Jewish
j leaders retorted angrily that they
j were ready to meet force with force.
In obvious anticipation of just
that reception, the committee eon
! eluded its report with the unequivo
| cal recommendation that the Anglo-
American governments .stand ready
| to suppress ruthlessly any violence
or terrorism by either side.
