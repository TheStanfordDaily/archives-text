WASHINGTON, April 30 (UP).—
I The House reconvened after a 10-
day Easter recess today under
I heavy Administration pressure to
j remain in session all summer if nec
| essary to complete action on the
j legislative program.
Speaker Sam Rayburn, D., Tex.,
{ confronted the returning represen
tatives with a list of 10 and perhaps
12 major bills which the Adminis
tration wants enacted before Con
gress adjourns for an electioneer
ing vacation.
He spiked reports emanating from j
other members (hat the House !
might be able to recess by late June {
I or early July, possibly for the rest j
I of the year.
"We'll stay here until we get ■
through, but I don't know when
1 that will be," Rayburn told a news |
J conference.
Then he laid down his "must" ;
1 program which included the Brit- ]
ish loan bill, OPA and draft exten- j
sion, seven regular appropriations
1 bills, and possibly the service mer
| ger and atomic energy control j
I measures.
