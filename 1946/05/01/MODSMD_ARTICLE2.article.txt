Commenting on the development of the new atom s.nashers,
Professor Paul Kirkpatrick, acting dean of the Stanford School of
Physical Sciences, said last nigjht that it is still too early to deter
mine the efficacy of the super smashers.
"The synchrotons are still in the paper stage as far as results
go; work is going ahead but no one knows just what they will
actually do when they are completed," he said.
"There is no doubt that the acceleration of electrons will be a
tremendous advantage in the advancement of nuclear physics, but
we shall have to wait and see if the synchrotons achieve the
acceleration expected of them."
Detailed descriptions of this new process of electron accelera
tion are given in physical science reviews, according to Profes
sor Kirkpatrick.
