# 'What's Wrong with Stanford?'
## 
### 
The quesiion we've heard more than we'd
like to admit has been voiced by old Farm
s dents returning to the campus, by bewil
d red frosh, and'by equally bewildered jun
icrs and seniors who watched Stanford come
through ihe lean war years with the constant
hope that peace would bring back some of
the Farm ideals and traditions that neces
s rily lapsed during the war crisis.
Listead, they say, Stanford students are
si pir. ;j. it ain't the same old Farm, and the
r ~ o :e .hey'd hoped for hasn't materialized
b; a long shot.
We couldn't answer their queries until we
heard one old student £ay, "The kids haven't
changed, it's their feeling for Stanford that
has. They don't do the same things anymore.
Maybe it's because they don't go to the same
places vve used to."
And maybe he's right.
It is natural that students should want
some of the outside activities that make col
lege a new and broadening experience. It
is natural, too, after four years of war during
which all social functions were limited to
on-campus activities, that there would be a

race for the biggest, the newest, and the most
daring in off-campus parties.
Part of the blame for this tendency to dis
sociate our activities from the campus lies in
the physical plant of the campus itself. There
is still no place where Stanford students can
diop in for a coke or a hamburger any time
of the day; no place where they can turn on
a juke box and dance; no place where they
can sit around when they please to relax as
long as they please.
The Cellar is overburdened and inade
quate; the Nitery fizzled out for lack of care,
due primarily to its uninviting, cavernous
size; the golf course is too far from Quad; and
the Boathouse is and should be designed
only for spring swimming.
With the large number of new students
now at school here, it is necessary more than
over that there should be someplace de
signed for students alone that can be a center
of campus activities, an informal but actual
symbol of the Farm itself. What we need is
a student union. But we don't get one till
we work for it. And the demand must come
from you.—Editorial Board.

the Boathouse is and should be designed
only for spring swimming.
With the large number of new students
now at school here, it is necessary more than
over that there should be someplace de
signed for students alone that can be a center
of campus activities, an informal but actual
symbol of the Farm itself. What we need is
a student union. But we don't get one till
we work for it. And the demand must come
from you.—Editorial Board.
The quesiion we've heard more than we'd
like to admit has been voiced by old Farm
s dents returning to the campus, by bewil
d red frosh, and'by equally bewildered jun
icrs and seniors who watched Stanford come
through ihe lean war years with the constant
hope that peace would bring back some of
the Farm ideals and traditions that neces
s rily lapsed during the war crisis.
Listead, they say, Stanford students are
si pir. ;j. it ain't the same old Farm, and the
r ~ o :e .hey'd hoped for hasn't materialized
b; a long shot.
We couldn't answer their queries until we
heard one old student £ay, "The kids haven't
changed, it's their feeling for Stanford that
has. They don't do the same things anymore.
Maybe it's because they don't go to the same
places vve used to."
And maybe he's right.
It is natural that students should want
some of the outside activities that make col
lege a new and broadening experience. It
is natural, too, after four years of war during
which all social functions were limited to
on-campus activities, that there would be a

race for the biggest, the newest, and the most
daring in off-campus parties.
Part of the blame for this tendency to dis
sociate our activities from the campus lies in
the physical plant of the campus itself. There
is still no place where Stanford students can
diop in for a coke or a hamburger any time
of the day; no place where they can turn on
a juke box and dance; no place where they
can sit around when they please to relax as
long as they please.
The Cellar is overburdened and inade
quate; the Nitery fizzled out for lack of care,
due primarily to its uninviting, cavernous
size; the golf course is too far from Quad; and
the Boathouse is and should be designed
only for spring swimming.
