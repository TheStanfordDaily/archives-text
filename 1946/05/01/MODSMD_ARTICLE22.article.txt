# 'Buzz Me, Baby...'
## 
### 
On the heels of the roaring twenties and
the gloomy thirties has come the looping,
swooping "buzzing forties." Earmarks of the
c'.e are a five-minute eclipse of all speech in
your 11 o'clock class, or a quick, concerted
dive to the grass as Stanford's flying enthu
siasts (and everybody's boyfriend) zoom far
too low over our fair campus.
AH Biandin, University business manager,
has written to the commanding general, Sixth
Army, Presidio; the Commandant of the 14th
Naval District, San Francisco; the Civil Aero
nautics Authority district office, Oakland;
and to all Peninsula airport managers asking
their cooperation in keeping flying at a min
imum over the campus.
He lecommends that whenever possible,
planes bypass the campus completely, and
if it is "absolutely necessary" to fly in this

area, that a minimum altitude of 2,000 feet be
maintained.
Despite our enthusiasm for experienced
and inexperienced "hot pilots" and our sym
pathy with soloists, who either want to show
their friends or just can't seem to keep their
plane up top in the air, we join Mr. Brandin
in these recommendations.
There is more behind such a mandate than
preserving the Hoover War Libe. We want,
through a display of caution, to protect the
lives of our students. Illustrations of acci
dental deaths from buzzing—decapitation of
pedestrians, and sudden loss of a plane's
control — would be superfluous. Stanford
flyers can demonstrate their conscience of
these events by banding together in an anti
buzzing, anti-showoff, safety-first campaign.
