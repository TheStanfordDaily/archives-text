HOUSING—THE LONG RUN
Perhaps it would be a good idea if it were pointed
out that the present housing problem at Stanford is
possibly not the short term emergency it is generally
considered to be. It will certainly be no short term
problem if Stanford is to continue to grow during
the coming decade, or on into the decade following
that.
Why do I think the University will continue to
grow? Simply because it will have to if the name
Stanford is to remain among those of the best
universities. The value of higher education is just
now beginning to dawn upon the hero of our time,
the common man. But more important than the
mere realization of its value is the increasing pos
sibility of the common man being in a position to
partake of higher education himself.
A growing opinion among thoughtful men, fos
tered by the G.I. Bill, is< That a college education
should be the right of every person with the ability
to complete sucli an education. For statistical evi
dence in this regard I need only point to the over
whelming number of veterans who are taking ad
vantage of the educational opportunities offered
under the G.I. Bill.
But let us return to the more immediate picture.
Will a partial solution to the present housing
problem suffice? Will married students continue to

attend Stanford Cor only another two or three
years? Some of us doubt the big fat "yes" so many
members of the student body and the administra
tion mouth in answer to those questions. Even a
half-way solution to the housing situation would be
a welcome relief, to be sure. The Dibble project
proposes to be a half-way solution, but not to the
present emergency. It will be a partial solution to
the emergency which will exist next autumn.
(Consider these possibilities for the continued en
rollment of married students: First, the returning
veterans from occupational service groups to whorr;
the G.I. Bill will apply. Second, the men now being
drafted into service, and those who will doubtless
be drafted during the next few years, to whom the
G.I. Bill will apply eventually. It is hardly a sup
position to say that a great percentage of the men
of both groups will he married when they return to
college. Third, the rather latent discovery that
marriage and college go rather well together. If
any married students leave Stanford it won't be
because marriage and studies do not go together.
Instead it will be because studies and house-hunt
ing conict, or, if the student leaving is a veteran,
because he cannot afford to continue to give up
half of his monthly income to some Palo Alto land
lady.

drafted into service, and those who will doubtless
be drafted during the next few years, to whom the
G.I. Bill will apply eventually. It is hardly a sup
position to say that a great percentage of the men
of both groups will he married when they return to
college. Third, the rather latent discovery that
marriage and college go rather well together. If
any married students leave Stanford it won't be
because marriage and studies do not go together.
Instead it will be because studies and house-hunt
ing conict, or, if the student leaving is a veteran,
because he cannot afford to continue to give up
half of his monthly income to some Palo Alto land
lady.

HOUSING—THE LONG RUN
Perhaps it would be a good idea if it were pointed
out that the present housing problem at Stanford is
possibly not the short term emergency it is generally
considered to be. It will certainly be no short term
problem if Stanford is to continue to grow during
the coming decade, or on into the decade following
that.
Why do I think the University will continue to
grow? Simply because it will have to if the name
Stanford is to remain among those of the best
universities. The value of higher education is just
now beginning to dawn upon the hero of our time,
the common man. But more important than the
mere realization of its value is the increasing pos
sibility of the common man being in a position to
partake of higher education himself.
A growing opinion among thoughtful men, fos
tered by the G.I. Bill, is< That a college education
should be the right of every person with the ability
to complete sucli an education. For statistical evi
dence in this regard I need only point to the over
whelming number of veterans who are taking ad
vantage of the educational opportunities offered
under the G.I. Bill.
But let us return to the more immediate picture.
Will a partial solution to the present housing
problem suffice? Will married students continue to

attend Stanford Cor only another two or three
years? Some of us doubt the big fat "yes" so many
members of the student body and the administra
tion mouth in answer to those questions. Even a
half-way solution to the housing situation would be
a welcome relief, to be sure. The Dibble project
proposes to be a half-way solution, but not to the
present emergency. It will be a partial solution to
the emergency which will exist next autumn.
(Consider these possibilities for the continued en
rollment of married students: First, the returning
veterans from occupational service groups to whorr;
the G.I. Bill will apply. Second, the men now being
drafted into service, and those who will doubtless
be drafted during the next few years, to whom the
G.I. Bill will apply eventually. It is hardly a sup
