# BULL SESSION

### H.D. THOREAU 
The University of Southern California would
have you believe that they were, athletically
speaking, the number one college in the country.
If you twisted their arms they would admit that
scholastically they aren't much, but by George
their athletes are always among the best.
But even their sporting prowess must be on the
wane now for they regretfully informed Eddie
Twiggs, our golfing coach, last week that they were
not ready to play the scheduled conference match
next Friday, so not to send a team down.
We realize that they couldn't put out a team to
beat us—or even make it a close match, but we
also know that our tennis team will probably lose
nine straight matches to them this week-end and
our track team will do well to take 30 out of 130
points from the healthy Trojan team.
But at the same lime Stanford has never con
sidered canceling either event simply because it
was acknnwldged that we were not ready to win.
With a student body more than twice the size of
our own, it seems strange that they can't make up
a fine team. But what is even stranger is that they
refuse to let the few men they have play us.
The same thing happened to the St. Mary's match
last Saturday morning. They called and said that
since we were sure to win, there was no sense
playing the match.
This is St. Mary's first year of intercollegiate golf
and since they are not conference members the
match was only a practice affair. Herm Wede
meyer, their number one man, had to play ball

that afternoon. All these factors might be called
extenuating circumstances, but in the case of U.S.C.
we see no such circumstances.
Perhaps it would be more advisable to leave
Southern California off our golf schedule next year,
and our other schedules also.

We were glad to see that George Temple, Farm
grad of the late thirties, is prospering in this
world. He has married an ex-ballet dancer; he is
expecting an heir; he is becoming a main-event
man on the Texas wrestling circuit.
George's little sister, Shirley, plays in the talkies
down in Hollywood. Perhaps you've seen her.

An item in the Bulletin Board column of today s
paper informs all concerned that Phi Phi, a men s
honorary swallowing fraternity, will hold a short
business meeting at 4:30 Friday afternoon at 241 El
Camino Real, just north of the bridge in Menlo.
We looked up 241 El Camino Real in the Menlo
Park City Directory and it turned out to be Bel
tramo's Oasis Beer Garden. The thought just oc
cui red to us that perhaps Mr. Beeltramo wouldn't
want people to hold business meetings in his estab
lishment since he evidently runs it lor the purpose
of selling beer, and naturally no one is going to
drink beer at a business meeting.
The fellows in charge probably didn t realize what
kind of a place this was when they scheduled the
meeting, so we would like to suggest that the meet
ing be moved to 9 El Camino Real, just north of
the bridge in Menlo.
