# Renaissance Poetry Read
## 
### 
There was a time when a poet
was assumed to have some intelli
gence. Yvor Winters, associate pro
lessor of English, reading in the
thiggs room yesterday, pointed out
that that time was in the English
Renaissance and seldom since.
Mr. Winters illustrated his brief,
pertinent thesis with selections from
Sir Philip Sidney, Fulke Greville,
Lord Brooke, Ben Jonson, Henry
King, George Herbert, and Henry
Vaughn.
His low pitch and slightly sus
tained tone make Mr. Winters' voice
superior for reading poetry. How
ever, the Briggs room's adjacency
to the clock chimes is unfortunate.
TO HIGHER THINGS'
A theme evident in Mr. Winters'
choice of poems was that of the
worldly, vital, sensual man of the
Renaissance turning (in Sidney's
words) "to higher things"—things
of the spirit and of the mind.
From Sidney he read "Song,"
"Farewell," and two sonnets which
are a kind of postscript to his son
net sequence "Astrophel and Stel
la," including the famous "Farewell
to Love."
BEN JONSON 'GREATEST'
From Fulke Greville, a favorite
of his who is not as well known as
some others, Mr. Winters read live
selections from his long sequence
depicting Greville's progression
from a passionate love sonnetteer
to a writer of devotional works.
The second selection he read, Mr.
Winters called "a moonlight night
mare" and perhaps the most violent
poem written during the Renais
sance.
From Ben Jonson, whom he
termed the greatest of poets, Mr.
Winters read "To Heaven," "Epi
taph for His First Son," "Excuse for
Loving," and the "Elegy" ("Though
beauty be the mark of praise").
HERBERT NEGLECTED
Henry King's "Exequy on His
Dead Wife" in iambic quadrimeter
coftplets is an old man's lament for
his young wile, comparing himself
to a traveler going west.
Mr. Winters asserted that the
"Church Monuments" by George
Herbert, which he read, has been
unjustly neglected by anthologists.
It may be added that other poems
have suffered this fate and survived
as this one has.
The reading was closed with "The
Lamp," "Departed Friends," and
"To His Books" by Henry Vaughn.

from a passionate love sonnetteer
to a writer of devotional works.
The second selection he read, Mr.
Winters called "a moonlight night
mare" and perhaps the most violent
poem written during the Renais
sance.
From Ben Jonson, whom he
termed the greatest of poets, Mr.
Winters read "To Heaven," "Epi
taph for His First Son," "Excuse for
Loving," and the "Elegy" ("Though
beauty be the mark of praise").
HERBERT NEGLECTED
Henry King's "Exequy on His
Dead Wife" in iambic quadrimeter
coftplets is an old man's lament for
his young wile, comparing himself
to a traveler going west.
Mr. Winters asserted that the
"Church Monuments" by George
Herbert, which he read, has been
unjustly neglected by anthologists.
It may be added that other poems
have suffered this fate and survived
as this one has.
The reading was closed with "The
Lamp," "Departed Friends," and
"To His Books" by Henry Vaughn.

There was a time when a poet
was assumed to have some intelli
gence. Yvor Winters, associate pro
lessor of English, reading in the
thiggs room yesterday, pointed out
that that time was in the English
Renaissance and seldom since.
Mr. Winters illustrated his brief,
pertinent thesis with selections from
Sir Philip Sidney, Fulke Greville,
Lord Brooke, Ben Jonson, Henry
King, George Herbert, and Henry
Vaughn.
His low pitch and slightly sus
tained tone make Mr. Winters' voice
superior for reading poetry. How
ever, the Briggs room's adjacency
to the clock chimes is unfortunate.
TO HIGHER THINGS'
A theme evident in Mr. Winters'
choice of poems was that of the
worldly, vital, sensual man of the
Renaissance turning (in Sidney's
words) "to higher things"—things
of the spirit and of the mind.
From Sidney he read "Song,"
"Farewell," and two sonnets which
are a kind of postscript to his son
net sequence "Astrophel and Stel
la," including the famous "Farewell
to Love."
BEN JONSON 'GREATEST'
From Fulke Greville, a favorite
of his who is not as well known as
some others, Mr. Winters read live
selections from his long sequence
depicting Greville's progression
from a passionate love sonnetteer
to a writer of devotional works.
The second selection he read, Mr.
Winters called "a moonlight night
mare" and perhaps the most violent
poem written during the Renais
sance.
From Ben Jonson, whom he
termed the greatest of poets, Mr.
Winters read "To Heaven," "Epi
taph for His First Son," "Excuse for
Loving," and the "Elegy" ("Though
beauty be the mark of praise").
