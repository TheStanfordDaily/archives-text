# War Trials Disappoint
## Crime Prevention UN Job: Fairman 
### 
Developing a thesis that the trial
of war crimes is a long, drawn-out
process and has disappointed the
highest hopes held for it, Charles
Fairman, former chief of the inter
national law division of ETO, left a
Tuesday Evening Series audience
last night with only two good
thoughts:
First: that we must look to the
UNO to prevent the necessity of
war trials in the future; that it is
better to prevent such a mess as
Na/.iism and Fascism have caused
than to be forced to clear it up.
Second: that the job of the War
Crimes center at Nuernberg, the
biggest judiciaj operation ever
accomplished, is being magnifi
cently managed by Supreme Court
Justice Robert 11. Jackson.
Regretting his pessimistic view,
Mr. Fairman, who has returned to
Stanford as executive head of the
Political Science Department, out
lined the establishment of the ma
chinery for the war crime trials
since the Moscow pact in 1943 when
it was decided that the crimes should
be tried according to the law of the
country where they had been com
mitted.
Mr. Fairman emphasized the com
plexity of gathering evidence, ar
ranging, trying and convicting the
four types of criminals to be prose
cuted: those offenders of the rules of
international warfare (such as mis
treaters of PW's); those guilty of
criminal acts against civilian popu
lations in their own countries; those
against imported slave labor, inter
nees and others in Germany and
Italy, and—the most difficult—Ger
mans who had injured Germans in
Germany.
Mr. Fairman made the point
that the Nuernberg trial of the 22
chief Nazi criminals (Goering,
I less, Schacht. and others) has
been longer and more difficult than
expected at first, because the pros-
ecutors wished to huild up a mon
ument of evidence of deliberate
and monstrous atrocities for fu
ture peoples to remember. It
would have been more expeditious
to charge each with a specific crim
inal act.
Expressing disappointment at the
results of the trials, Mr. Fairman
said that the Nuernberg court will
be doing good if it convicts 100 Nazi
criminals when it had been hoped
that 1,000 would stand trial.
Most of the evidence used in the
trials, which Mr. Fairman has at
tended as a liaison officer between
ETO headquarters and the U.S. Chief
of Counsel, is documentary. The
criminals are "condemned out of
their own mouths" he commented.
Mr. Fairman discounted the no
tion that a vast new body of inter
national law will accrue from the
War Crimes trials. This too will
have to come from the United Na
tions organization, he said.
His final view that the self-asser
tion growing in Germany must be
directed in positive constructive di
rection was, we think, shared with
many of his listeners.—Pinkerton.

tended as a liaison officer between
ETO headquarters and the U.S. Chief
of Counsel, is documentary. The
criminals are "condemned out of
their own mouths" he commented.
Mr. Fairman discounted the no
tion that a vast new body of inter
national law will accrue from the
War Crimes trials. This too will
have to come from the United Na
tions organization, he said.

Developing a thesis that the trial
of war crimes is a long, drawn-out
process and has disappointed the
highest hopes held for it, Charles
Fairman, former chief of the inter
national law division of ETO, left a
Tuesday Evening Series audience
last night with only two good
thoughts:
First: that we must look to the
UNO to prevent the necessity of
war trials in the future; that it is
better to prevent such a mess as
Na/.iism and Fascism have caused
than to be forced to clear it up.
Second: that the job of the War
Crimes center at Nuernberg, the
biggest judiciaj operation ever
accomplished, is being magnifi
cently managed by Supreme Court
Justice Robert 11. Jackson.
Regretting his pessimistic view,
Mr. Fairman, who has returned to
Stanford as executive head of the
Political Science Department, out
lined the establishment of the ma
chinery for the war crime trials
since the Moscow pact in 1943 when
it was decided that the crimes should
be tried according to the law of the
country where they had been com
mitted.
Mr. Fairman emphasized the com
plexity of gathering evidence, ar
ranging, trying and convicting the
four types of criminals to be prose
cuted: those offenders of the rules of
international warfare (such as mis
treaters of PW's); those guilty of
criminal acts against civilian popu
lations in their own countries; those
against imported slave labor, inter
nees and others in Germany and
Italy, and—the most difficult—Ger
mans who had injured Germans in
Germany.
Mr. Fairman made the point
that the Nuernberg trial of the 22
chief Nazi criminals (Goering,
I less, Schacht. and others) has
been longer and more difficult than
expected at first, because the pros-
ecutors wished to huild up a mon
ument of evidence of deliberate
and monstrous atrocities for fu
ture peoples to remember. It
would have been more expeditious
to charge each with a specific crim
inal act.
Expressing disappointment at the
results of the trials, Mr. Fairman
said that the Nuernberg court will
be doing good if it convicts 100 Nazi
criminals when it had been hoped
that 1,000 would stand trial.
Most of the evidence used in the
trials, which Mr. Fairman has at
tended as a liaison officer between
ETO headquarters and the U.S. Chief
of Counsel, is documentary. The
criminals are "condemned out of
their own mouths" he commented.
