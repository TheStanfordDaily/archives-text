# War Trials Disappoint
## Crime Prevention UN Job: Fairman 
### 
Developing a thesis that the trial
of war crimes is a long, drawn-out
process and has disappointed the
highest hopes held for it, Charles
Fairman, former chief of the inter
national law division of ETO, left a
Tuesday Evening Series audience
last night with only two good
thoughts:
First: that we must look to the
UNO to prevent the necessity of

Justice Robert 11. Jackson.
Regretting his pessimistic view,
Mr. Fairman, who has returned to
Stanford as executive head of the
Political Science Department, out

since the Moscow pact in 1943 when
it was decided that the crimes should
be tried according to the law of the
country where they had been com
mitted.
Mr. Fairman emphasized the com
plexity of gathering evidence, ar
ranging, trying and convicting the

against imported slave labor, inter
nees and others in Germany and
Italy, and—the most difficult—Ger
mans who had injured Germans in
Germany.
Mr. Fairman made the point
that the Nuernberg trial of the 22
chief Nazi criminals (Goering,
I less, Schacht. and others) has
been longer and more difficult than
expected at first, because the pros-
