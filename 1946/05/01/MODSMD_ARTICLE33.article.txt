## 
### 
An underdog Farm team will try )
to avenge last year's defeat when it
clashes with the University of Cali- (
fornia in the historic Joffre debate |
Wednesday.
Selected to fight for Stanford in j
the 'Big Debate"—the annual Farm- |
Cal contest for the Medaille Joffre— ■
are Carol Newton, Wallace McCall, I
and Tom Steege.
ROLE OF FRANCE
They are rated underdog by Coach
Leland T. Chapin since one of their i
opponents will be Juanita Olsen who j
won for UC last May. Stanford en- j
ters the fifty-second battle between
the two universities trailing 25-26. |
When the two teams meet in Cal's
Wheeler Hall they will debate a [
question drawn from the- general
topic "The Role of France in the
World Today."
Three specific questions have been
chosen by Frederick L. Schuman,
noted writer and professor of politi
cal science at Williams College, j
UC's Vice-President Deutsch will !
make the final selection from these I
three.
TOPIC A SURPRISE
Joffre participants will not know |
the specific topic until shortly be- j
fore the contest. This adds an im- i
promptu atmosphere to the tourney, I
a quality which has helped make it
one of the best known debates in the
country.
Miss Newton is the only member
of the Stanford team who has been
in a "Big Debate" before. McCall
has been active in local forensics ]
throughout the year and was in
strumental in the successes at Den
ver last quarter. Steege was the
outstanding speaker in the discus
sion-debate at Stockton's Pacific
Forensic League tourney.
The team was selected by a panel
of faculty judges, including Chilton
Bush, head of the Department of
Journalism, Merrill Spalding, asso

eiate professor of history, William
Leonard Schwartz, associate profes
sor of Romanic languages, and J.
Gordon Emerson and Leland T.
Chapin, associate professors of
speech and drama.
Backed by a thorough eight
months' study of France, by numer
ous discussions, lectures, and prac
tice contests, the local representa
tives are hopeful of upsetting the
fi'vorite Wednesday and tying the
score in the traditional verbal tan
gle.

Leland T. Chapin since one of their i
opponents will be Juanita Olsen who j
won for UC last May. Stanford en- j
ters the fifty-second battle between
the two universities trailing 25-26. |
When the two teams meet in Cal's
Wheeler Hall they will debate a [
question drawn from the- general
topic "The Role of France in the
World Today."
Three specific questions have been
chosen by Frederick L. Schuman,
noted writer and professor of politi
cal science at Williams College, j
UC's Vice-President Deutsch will !
make the final selection from these I
three.
TOPIC A SURPRISE
Joffre participants will not know |
the specific topic until shortly be- j
fore the contest. This adds an im- i
promptu atmosphere to the tourney, I
a quality which has helped make it
one of the best known debates in the
country.
Miss Newton is the only member
of the Stanford team who has been
in a "Big Debate" before. McCall
has been active in local forensics ]
throughout the year and was in
strumental in the successes at Den
ver last quarter. Steege was the
outstanding speaker in the discus
sion-debate at Stockton's Pacific
Forensic League tourney.
The team was selected by a panel
of faculty judges, including Chilton
Bush, head of the Department of
Journalism, Merrill Spalding, asso

eiate professor of history, William
Leonard Schwartz, associate profes
sor of Romanic languages, and J.
Gordon Emerson and Leland T.
Chapin, associate professors of
speech and drama.
Backed by a thorough eight
months' study of France, by numer
ous discussions, lectures, and prac
tice contests, the local representa
tives are hopeful of upsetting the
fi'vorite Wednesday and tying the
score in the traditional verbal tan
gle.
