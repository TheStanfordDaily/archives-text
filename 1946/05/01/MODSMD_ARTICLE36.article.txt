## 
### 
Stanford's highly touted swimming team registered another smashing
victory yesterday as they scuttled the Treasure Island Naval Center 53-22
in the Encina Pool. The outclassed Treasure Island swimmers garnered
but one first place in the racing events, and took the diving event in which
Stanford had no representatives.
Stanford jumped to an early lead as Borchers, Hester, and Eastman

swept to an easy victory in the 150-
yard medley relay in 1:21.7.
in the 220-yard freestyle, Dick
Narver edged out teammate Dick
Armstrong with Freed of the Treas
ure Island team a poor third. Nar
ver won this event in 2:22.3.
ANDERSON BREAKS RECORD
Bob Anderson zipped through the
water to rack up a very creditable
23 flat in the 50-yard freestyle.
Bob, who far outdistanced the rest
of the field, broke the Encina Pool
record and the existing Pacific
Coast Conference mark of 23.4 set
by Sellars of U.S.C. in 19*10. Sailor
Kiewe was second and Sperry of
the Indians placed third.
Bob Anderson racked up his sec
ond victory of the day in the 100-
yard freestyle, with the time of
53.7. Though this was not Bob An
derson's best time for this event, he
won by a commanding margin.
Eastman of Stanford and Peimme
of Treasure Island finished second
and third respectively.
BORCHERS DEFEAT
Harry Borchers suffered his first
defeat of the season as he was nosed
out in a thrilling finish by sailor
Draves. Draves, who swam the
event in 1:3, staged a beautiful last
second spurt to cop the race. Bris
cin of the Indians finished third.
Don Hester maintained his win
ning streak by taking the 100-yard
breaststroke event in 1:6.1. 80l of
Stanford gave Borchers a good
race till the final 30 yards when
Borchers began to steadily increase
his commanding lead. Suskovich of
Treasure Island finished third.
ARMSTRONG WINS
Armstrong of Stanford staggered
under the wire in the poor time of
5:30.6 for the 440-yard freestyle.
Armstrong was not up to his usual
par, yet his time was good enough
to defeat sailor Freed and Indian
Breymen, who finished second and
third respectively.
Anderson, Rule, Sperry, and Nar
ver put on a dr.zzling exhibition of
concerted lightning swimming as
they scored an easy victory in the
200-yard relay in the impressive
time of 1:30.1.
As Stanford entered no men in
the diving event, Hicks of Treasure
Island gave a performance of fancy
and well-executed diving.
