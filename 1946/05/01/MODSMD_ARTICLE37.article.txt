# NROTC Athletes Vie in Murals
## 
### 
Participating in softball, volley
ball, and horseshoes, eight Navy
teams are fighting for supremacy in
the intramural athletic program.
Under the supervision of Lt.
11. Williams, the Halsey, Cruis
er, Naval Administration School,
Tender, Nimitz, Carrier, Amphih,
and Staff teams are finishing first
round play.
At the present moment, the Hal
sey and N.A.S. teams look like they
will battle it out for the champion
ship. Halsey has conquered Nimitz
twice in softball, 24-4 and 9-4, and
has taken the measure of the staff
15-11, while the N.A.S. drubbed the
Staff combo and whipped the Ten
ders 26-7. Both teams present top
horseshoe slingers, with Halsey
looking potent in volleyball.
Dark horse of the tourney is the
Amphib team, which has yet to
show its wares in competition but
is said to be loaded. Cruisers,
sparked by Dave Toney, look sharp
in softball competition, having won
their only outing from the Carriers
in a freely played tussle.
The winner will he issued a
championship trophy and will he
given a banquet. It is hoped that
the winning nine of the league
will he matched with the winner
of the school intramural softball
league so that the championship
of the school may be determined.
