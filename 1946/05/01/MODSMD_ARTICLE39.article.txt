# Betas Swamp ATO Batters
## 
### 
Definitely showing that they are
of championship caliber, the Beta
Theta Pi softball sluggers poured it
on the A.T.O.'s yesterday to the
tune of 13 to 3 to pull away from
the League II pack.
Led by the pellet-pounding trio
of Ambrose, Bechter, and Os
borne, the Betas pushed six runs
across the plate in inning number
one and coasted to their fourth
straight victory.
Buchanan Hall found little com
petition in the Zeta Psi's and pro
ceeded to shut them out by a score
of 10 to 0; and Harrison edged the
Legal Eagles with consistent good
play G to 4.
Meanwhile in League I the first
plate Chi Psi's were left waiting
on the diamond by a no-show
Encina 4-E team, but the records
credit them with their fourth
straight win too.
Encina Cellar topped Sigma Nu
by a 6-4 count after the fraternity
boys had forged into a fifth-inning
lead. The Cellar Dwellers scored
three times in the sixth to cinch the
clash.
In the other League I game, Jef
ferson defeated the Phi Psi's by the
third 6-4 score of the afternoon but
not before the frats gave them a
good late-inning scare. A triple,
double, and two singles accounted
for three digits and almost a Phi
Psi win.
