## USC Heavy Track Choice Luce May Be Sole Winner 
### 
Stanford's improving track teams
step into high competition Saturday
in Los Angeles when Dean Crom
well's high-powered USC cindermen
play host to the Farm squad. The
Trojans have always turned out
strong track teams, and this year is
no exception.
With a total of 131 points in the
dual meet, if the Cardinal thinclads
can hold Troy under 100 points, it
will be a moral victory for Stan
ford.
This is easily understood when
the Trojan times, distances, and
heights are checked. Mel Patton
has run a !>.7 century dash; Mar
tin Anderson boasts of the best
time here, with a !).!) registered to
his credit. Patton also has run a
21.5 220-yard dash, and that time
hasn't been approached at Stan
ford.
Roland Sink of the Trojans has a
4.14 mile and a 9.55 two-mile to his
credit. Those times haven't even
been approached at Angell Field this
season. Three men have approached
or gone over the 6 ft. 4 in. mark in
the high jump. Three men have also
cleared 13 feet in the pole vault.
Another high mark at the Trojan
school is a 24 ft. 11 in. broad jump
by A 1 Lawrence.
With these sort of marks it is
hard to figure out how Stanford is
going to get even one first place
in the Los Angeles meet. Ed Luce
might get a tie for first place in
the high jump, if he returns to his
old form. Other than that, the
points garnered by the Farm lads
will have to come in from seconds
and thirds.


ED LUCE. Stanford high jumper, is the only local man expected to
grab a first place in the dual track and field meet with U.S.C. Saturday
in Los Angeles.
