Despite the fact that the Stanford
golfers have participated in only one
meet this season, their prowess has
spread to distant places. Last Sat
urday morning, the team gaily
tripped out to the Stanford course,
confidently expecting to beat the
St. Mary's Gaels; with or without
their luminary, Herman Wedemeyer.
But what happens? No visiting
team. Why, oh, they just weren't
able to make it.
Not all hope was lost, though, for
the boys were planning to go to Los
Angeles this weekend, and meet the
USC gang, and also the Bruins of
UCLA. The strong Indian squad was
favored to win.
And then guess what happened?
A call came from USC stating that
their team was just getting organ
ized. ami that they would like to
postpone the meet till later in the
season, when the weak and puny
Tommy Trojan would be in more
suitable shape to meet the strong
Indians from the Farm.
Now, of all the downright asinine
stunts, this takes the pie a la mode,
with a cup of Cellar coffee. On the
surface, they sign up for a meet, but
don't know whether to really form
a team or not. Then, just one week
before the scheduled affair, they in
form this school that they can't field

a suitable squad to meet Stanford.
That is their side of the picture,
but to this writer, it sounds like so
much hypocrisy, and nothing else.
At a school with approximately 12,-
000 students, to say that there aren't
a dozen students who are capable of
playing a fair game of golf sounds
just like a feeble excuse to squeeze
out of a meet because you know
you're going to lose.
And isn't it sweet of our south
ern comrades to tell us that they
would be glad to meet us later,
when they are ready? Maybe, in
stead of lining a match with Stan
ford. they can arrange some com
petition with El Cajon Hi in La
