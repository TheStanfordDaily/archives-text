# Going, Going, Gone —Suffolk Downs
## 
### 
BOSTON. April 30 (UP).—Lucra
tive Suffolk Downs goes on the auc
tion block tomorrow —the first time
in the history of the American turf
that a major race track has gone
under the hammer.
And when the auctioneer sings out
"going, going, gone" the seaside oval
will probably have brought upwards
of $2,000,000.
Actually what's being disposed of
are 14,991 shares of stock in the
Eastern Racing Association, Inc.—the
controlling interest in the track.
Four separate groups already are
scheduled to be in on the bidding
and when they gather they'll repre
sent between $8,000,000 and $10,-
000.000.
