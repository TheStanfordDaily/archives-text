# Feller Whiffs Eleven? Hurls No-Hit, No-Run Game
## Indians Nip Yankees, 1-0 
### 
NEW YORK, April 30 (UP).— j
Bob Feller, Cleveland Indian
speedball star, pitched a no-hit,
ao-run game—the second in the
major leagues this season—
against the New York Yankees
oday, striking out 11 batters to
win, 1-0.
It was the second no-hit no-run
game pitched by the lowa farm boy
in his meteoric baseball career, and
was also the second no-hit no-run
game pitched in organized baseball
today. Earl Harrist, right-hander
of the Syracuse team of the In
ternational League, pitched one
against Buffalo at Syracuse, win
ning 5-0.
FELLER'S BEST
Feller's performance, before 37,-
144 fans in Yankee Stadium this
afternoon, was considered by the
experts the best of a career replete
with stellar performances. It had
to be good, because up to the ninth
inning he was in a 0-0 duel with
Floyd Bevens who had given the
Cleveland Indians only six hits.
But in the ninth, Cleveland catch
| er Frankie Hayes won the game for
his battery mate by blasting a home
j run.
Feller walked five, but most of
the passes were due to over-cau
i lion.
ETTEN WIIIFFED 3 TIMES
All but two Yankees — Henrieh
j and DiMaggio—struck out at least
once. Etten was whiffed three
limes.
j He faced only 32 batters, and only
j 25 official times at bat were charged
against him.
Feller, after opening the season
I with a three-hit game, had lost two
| straight and the huge weekday
I crowd was there to see if he had
lost his stuff after his four years
| in the Navy.
He hadn't. He mowed down the
i Yankee sluggers, Joe DiMaggio,
j Tommy Henrieh, Charley Keller,
and Nick Etten, like so many sand-
I loiters.

NEW YORK, April 30 (UP).— j
Bob Feller, Cleveland Indian
speedball star, pitched a no-hit,
ao-run game—the second in the
major leagues this season—
against the New York Yankees
oday, striking out 11 batters to
win, 1-0.
It was the second no-hit no-run
game pitched by the lowa farm boy
in his meteoric baseball career, and
was also the second no-hit no-run
game pitched in organized baseball
today. Earl Harrist, right-hander
of the Syracuse team of the In
ternational League, pitched one
against Buffalo at Syracuse, win
ning 5-0.
FELLER'S BEST
Feller's performance, before 37,-
144 fans in Yankee Stadium this
afternoon, was considered by the
experts the best of a career replete
with stellar performances. It had
to be good, because up to the ninth
inning he was in a 0-0 duel with
Floyd Bevens who had given the
Cleveland Indians only six hits.
But in the ninth, Cleveland catch
| er Frankie Hayes won the game for
his battery mate by blasting a home
j run.
Feller walked five, but most of
the passes were due to over-cau
i lion.
ETTEN WIIIFFED 3 TIMES
All but two Yankees — Henrieh
j and DiMaggio—struck out at least
once. Etten was whiffed three
limes.
j He faced only 32 batters, and only
j 25 official times at bat were charged
against him.
Feller, after opening the season
I with a three-hit game, had lost two
| straight and the huge weekday
I crowd was there to see if he had
lost his stuff after his four years
| in the Navy.
He hadn't. He mowed down the
i Yankee sluggers, Joe DiMaggio,
j Tommy Henrieh, Charley Keller,
and Nick Etten, like so many sand-
I loiters.
