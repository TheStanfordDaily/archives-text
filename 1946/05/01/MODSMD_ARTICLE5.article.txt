# Roger the Recaller One Laugh Behind
## 
### 
When Mayor I). Lapliam
of San Francisco signed a petition
for his own recall he
didn't know he was providing his
opposition with ammunition for a
return bout in the city's current
contest to see which political
faction can yet the biggest laugh
out of the situation.
Ilenry Buddc, leader of the re
call movement, announced today
that lie had offered the Lapham
signed petition — said to he the
only one ever signed hy the per
son it is supposed to recall—to
Dr. Abraham Rosen bach of Chi
cago, who recently bought the
original "Alice in Wonderland"
manuscript for $50,000.
Since Dr. Rosenbach is a col
lector of unusual manuscripts,
said Mr. Buddc, he ought to be
willing to pay enough for the pe
tition to provide San Francisco
with a new bus.
