LONDON, April 30 (UP). —The Russian army has had in its possession
the charred bones of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun, his mistress-wife, since
a few days after they killed themselves in the bunker of the Berlin Reichs
cliancellory a year ago today, a British intelligence officer asserted today.
Circumstantial evidence collected by the British and others seemed to

Meave little doubt of the truth of
I the Nazi assertion of their deaths,
broadcast May 1, 1945.
British intelligence officers were
shown bones which Russian sol
; diers said were those of Hitler and
| Eva. The Russians said positive
| identification was made by one Frau
; Heusermann, assistant to Hitler's
| dentist, and by one Eichmann, the
dentist's mechanic.
Soon after the capture of Berlin
j some Russians said they were cer
| tain Hitler was dead because of the
; dental identification. But on June
10 Marshal Georgi Zhukov, com
| mander in chief, said: "We have
I discovered no corpse that could be
identified as Hitler's." The Red
Army command—like Allied com
mands—was taking no chances that
I Hitler had prepared a double, even
i to the extent of having the double's
j jaws made identical with his.
| A few clays before Zhukov made
j his statement the bones of a man
j and woman were shown to a small
| group of British officers.
