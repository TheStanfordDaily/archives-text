# Stanford Polio Unit Equipped
## 
### 
One of four in the nation, Stan
ford University now has a highly
mobile unit trained to combat the
dread poliomyelitis (infantile paral
ysis). The unit has been organized
under the National Foundation for
Prevention of Infantile Paralysis.
Miss Lucille Daniels, acting di
rector of the Physical Therapy De
partment, is in charge of the local
unit. Miss Helen Bunclark, a mem
ber of the Physical Therapy De
partment, and Dr. William North
way of Stanford - Lane Hospital,
round out the present staff. An or
thopedic nurse and possibly an epi
demiologist (a person trained in
combatting epidemic diseases) will
be added to the staff at an early
date.
TRAINED STAFF READY
The purpos? of the unit is to have
a trained start' ready for any epi
demic that might arise in the West
ern district. Equipment will be
available through the national or
ganization. This unit of trained
personnel will be dispatched im
mediately to the scene of the crisis,
where they will set up a treatment
center for ambulatory cases, and
start instituting care for stricken
patients.
The Stanford unit's territory will
primarily be the West Coast, but in
event of a major epidemic they may
be transferred to any part of the
country. Although still in a state
of organization at the time, mem
bers of the Stanford group co-op
erated with the National Founda
tion last summer during the polio
crisis in Rockford, 111. A program
which will be applicable in future
epidemics was instituted at that
time.
OTHER UNITS
Other units in the set-up are at
Northwestern University, Harvard
Medical School, and the D. T. Wat
son School of Physical Therapy at
Leetsdale, Pa.
Dr. Northway is an expert in this
field, having presided over a series
of lectures and demonstrations on
the treatment of infantile paralysis
given in Salt Lake City, Utah, last
fall. Miss Bunclark was in charge
of a school for training of nurses
to assist the units du.'ing operations,
which was held in Las Vegas, Ne
vada.
