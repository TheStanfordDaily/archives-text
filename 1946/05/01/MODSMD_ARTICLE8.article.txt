I changes in the political life of na
tions, said today in a May Day
| message that the world's peoples
were "taking the fat? of states into
j their own hands" 10 fight reaction
| and the instigators of new wars.
Asserting that Russia was in the
! vanguard of the struggle for peace
j and security, Stalin said that "peo
j pies liberated by the Soviet Union
from the Fascist yok? have received
I the possibility of building their gov
j ernmental life on democratic prin
; ciplcs, fulfilling their historical
j roles."
"In this path they find on the
part of the Soviet Union fraternal
help."
Issuing his usual injunction to
: the Russian fighting forces to be
watchful, and urging workers to
j fulfill and over-fulfill the new five
j year industrial plan, Stalin said
i Russia had convinced the world of
its might and its justice, "based on
i the recognition of the equality of
| rights of all nations, on respect for
1 their liberty and independence."
"There arc no reasons to doubt
that the Soviet Union will in fu
ture also remain true to its policy
i of peace and security, its policy
of equality of rights and friend
ship of peoples," he said.
Departing from his wartime cus-

torn of confining his orders of the
day to military and Russian inter
nal questions, Stalin noted that
Russia was spending today, "the in
ternational holiday of workers,"
and spoke frankly of politics in oth
er countries.
"The smashup and liquidation of
the main hotbed of Fascism and
world oppression resulted in a wide
growth of the democratic move
ment of nations," Stalin said.
