BEGAN TWO YEARS AGO
Two years ago a small Brethren
denomination composed of Middle
Western farmers proposed that on
each of their farms a bred heifer
be set aside for shipment overseas.
The Brethren told others about
the idea, and pretty soon cattle from
many denominational groups were
mingling peaceably in holds of ships
European-bound.
TO MANY COUNTRIES
Ben Bushong is a Brethren
stockman from Lancaster, Pennsyl
vania, who volunteered his time and
now supervises cattle shipments and
personnel from Maryland ports.
Shipments have been made to
France, Italy, Belgium, Czechoslo
vakia, and Poland.
The herds en route overseas
sometimes confuse the census taker.
The last herd to leave Baltimore
numbered 300; when it arrived in
Danzig, there were 313! Thirteen
calves had been born en route.
From Danzig the herds were driven
into Poland, twenty miles away.

tion situation and did something
about it.

We've been caught with our cal
ories clown. And it's not a pretty
thing to have happen. A few peo
ple are beginning to realize what
starvation really means. While this
realization is sinking in, a lot of
people around the world are starv
ing. •
While nebulous ideas are floating
around, a few men have been con
verting words into action. Ben
Bushong, who comes to campus to
day for "Heifers for Relief," is one
of these.
BEGAN TWO YEARS AGO
Two years ago a small Brethren
denomination composed of Middle
Western farmers proposed that on
each of their farms a bred heifer
be set aside for shipment overseas.
The Brethren told others about
the idea, and pretty soon cattle from
many denominational groups were
mingling peaceably in holds of ships
European-bound.
TO MANY COUNTRIES
Ben Bushong is a Brethren
stockman from Lancaster, Pennsyl
vania, who volunteered his time and
now supervises cattle shipments and
personnel from Maryland ports.
Shipments have been made to
France, Italy, Belgium, Czechoslo
vakia, and Poland.
The herds en route overseas
sometimes confuse the census taker.
The last herd to leave Baltimore
numbered 300; when it arrived in
Danzig, there were 313! Thirteen
calves had been born en route.
From Danzig the herds were driven
into Poland, twenty miles away.
NEED FOR OTHER RELIEF
Ben Bushong, who speaks today
at 4:15 p.m. in Cubberley Audito
rium knows the need for heifers and
other relief measures overseas. As
national director for overseas ship
ments of cattle, he can feci a per
sonal satisfaction, not because of
the work he is doing now, but be
cause he was aware of the starva
tion situation and did something
about it.
