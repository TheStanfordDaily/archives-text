# Postcards Give Info About Axe
## 
### 
Relax — the Axe is as good as
found. There are five people in Cal
who have written to the Daily say
ing they have hot info concerning
its whereabouts—and they all say
that it's in different places, which
doesn't make things confusing at
all.
The only thing that makes it con
fusing is that all five postcards were
mailed at (he same place and the
same time, and were written in five
different colors of ink and five dif
ferent varieties of Sanskrit. Now,
how did all of these people get
around the "Outgoing Mail" slot
without getting acquainted and get
ting into some sort of a squabble
over their conflicting info?
If you happen to be up around
the big butter-colored school in the
near future, looking for axes and
things, you might drop in at the
following places:
Elevator shaft of Bowles Hall;
under the "C"; "walls of my bed
chamber in my home town" (his
name is Pedro II); and "my wall"
(it writes in faded blue ink and is
under the impression that there's
some sort of blacksmith down here
who can fit him with shoes —he
wears an odd size).
Through logical deduction the
writer of the fifth card is the cul
prit—it doesn't offer any sugges
tions as to the hiding place, and
states bitterly, "I used to go to
Stanford I did, but I don't any
more. I don't like your candy."
Bring that case of Hershey's up from
under the counter, Cellah Pete, and
you'll not only have the Axe back,
you'll have an "old student" re
turning to dust the case.
