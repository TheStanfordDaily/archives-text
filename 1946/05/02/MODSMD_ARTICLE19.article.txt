"This is the day for which
peace-loving peoples throughout
the world have fought and
prayed. . . . But it is yet to be
determined if this dav is to be
the greatest day in all our his
tory or iust the end of another
war. What it comes to mean will
depend upon how we use the
freedom that is now being made
possible for the entire world, and
how we use the machinery of
the United Nations to prevent fu
ture wars."â€”These are the words
of Governor Earl Warren, on V-J
Day, 1945.
Today the news reports from
Paris, from Moscow, Rome, Cairo,
and Palestine indicate that citi
zens of the world are still lost in a
maze of intolerance, intense na
tionalism, and programs of self
interest. Are we watching the
news; are we noting the sweep of
events; can we, perhaps, renew
and strengthen our pledge to a
peace that, this time, will last?.-
