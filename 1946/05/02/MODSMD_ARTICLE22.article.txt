i interests of the people of this dis—
j trict."
"I have cast 000 votes since 1
have been in Congress," Mr. An
j derson said. "If Mr. Mac Donald
i can only find 15 or so to criticize, I
don't think I've been doing so bad."
The Congressman stateH that
the reason he had voted against
the original OPA hill was "he
cause I knew it wouldn't work.
And it didn't."

sion of Selective Service in 1941, and
I said that he had led the fight in the
j House for the so-called Soldier
j Vote hill.

j did not believe the recent House
amendments to the OPA bill would

"I am for price control—sen
sible price control in this country
! only so long as supply is behind

away with."

Mac Donald pointed out thai "wc
did pretty well" during wartime
I willi price control. He then quoted
! figures .showing an average rise of
more than 400 per cent in the prof- '
! its of manufacturing concerns j
throughout the country.

I torium seemed to he evenly divided j
j as 1o the candidates, and each side ;
: applauded and cheered for .several I
minutes a.s its candidate appeared, j
