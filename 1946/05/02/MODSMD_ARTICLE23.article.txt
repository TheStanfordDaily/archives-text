# Byrnes, Molotov Split On Italy Peace Terms
## Russia Opposes Allied Commission; Fears Intervention in Eastern Bloc 
### 
PARIS, May 1 (UP). â€”Secretary of State James F. Byrnes
clashed angrily with Russian Foreign Minister Viacheslav Molo
tov in the Big Four foreign ministers conference today when thn
Soviet envoy rejected a proposal for an Allied commission to
supervise the carrying out of peace terms for Italy. Molotov had

agreed to such a proposal last Sep
tember.
Mindful that the commission might
set a precedent for an Allied voice
in controlling peace treaty enforce
incnt in Hungary, Romania and Bul -
garia where Russia is dominant.
Molotov refused the proposal on the
ground that it would bo "inconsist
ent with Italian sovereign rights."
Byrnes announced at the meeting
that the United States was ready
now to reduce its occupation forces
in Italy and Austria to 15,000 men
each and intended to withdraw >tll
its troops from Italy as soon as u
peace treaty was .signed.
Byrnes did not specify that this
offer was contingent on other pow
ers following suit. Russia is esti
mated to have about 70,000 men in
Austria as compared to 25,000 Amer
icans, 25,000 Britons and 15,00')
Frenchmen. In Italy the United
States has about 50,000 men. Russia
has none.
British Foreign Minister Erne:,l;
Bevin and French Foreign Minister
George Bidault, supported Byrnes
closely in his clash with Molotov,
which left the Big Four ministers*
bogged down and despairing of the
likelihood of an early agreement on
any major question in their confer
ence, called to draft peace treaties
for Italy, Hungary, Romania, Bul
garia, and Finland. Only yesterday
the ministers agreed to meet twice
daily.
But today's scheduled afternoon
meeting was abandoned because
there was no prospect of getting to
gether on decisions.
At the London Foreign Ministerial
Conference last September, Molotov
agreed to the idea of a control com
mission for Italy. His opposition to
a commission today was rigid and it.
was necessary to shelve the pro
posal.
