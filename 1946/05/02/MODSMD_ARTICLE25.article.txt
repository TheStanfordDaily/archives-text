# Where Can They Go?

From here it looks as if the Anglo-Ameri
ca 1 inquiry committee on the Jewish situa
tion has stuck out its neck just far enough to
receive neither the support of homeless
Jev/ish people of Europe nor of the Arabs.
In a compromise move the committee rec
ommsnded that 100,000 Jews be admitted to
Palestine, which is 900,000 too few as far as
European Jews are concerned, and 100,000
too many from the viewpoint of Arab na
tionalists.
The whole mess is a world responsibility,
c uccd by the bitterness and prejudice which
infected Europe in the last decades and left
its mark on the "Displaced Persons" who
have come to look upon Palestine as their
only promised land The threatened resist
ance on the part of the Arab League stems
from the strong nationalist feeling that Arab

ian rights would be trampled upon by the
proposed Jewish "invasion." This claim we
consider also properly considered as world
responsibility.
And where does that responsibility rest?
If we don't discover soon that it must lie in
the United Nations, we will be turning our
backs on our own chances for survival.
As far as we can see, the important point
which was brought out by the committee's
report was that the United Nations should
drop immigration bars which have shut out
the D.P.'s from countries in which they could
live normal and unpersecuted lives.
If this proposal is made by the UN into an
absolute policy, and worldwide, then at least
there will be a basis for solution of a problem
which is burning in the hearts of a desperate
people.
