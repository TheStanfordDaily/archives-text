YV( have been watching the grim, strained faces
on Quad this morning and upon seeing each new

comer we have muttered to ourselves with justi

mad. But he has thought it over and has not been
carried away. He is keeping cool. Stout fella!" We
salute you—all of you! A crisis has been averted!
One Who Has Kept His Head.
One Wtio Has Thought It Over.
