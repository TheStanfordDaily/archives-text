Erenda Holser, Stanford '4G, returned to the campus
yesterday after an absence of several years. Beau
tiful Bunny has just established herself as the
woild's quickest mermaid.
She happened to be around the Bay Area on her
way from her old home in Portland to her new
home in Hollywood, and felt that she had to drop
to the old Farm and see how everything was.
Everything was fine.
She- iripped up to the boathouse and tripped into
ihe water, coming up a moment later with the re
mark, "It tastes just the same as in the old daysi"
Brenda is pretty certain about her future. She
will spend next year at U.C.L.A., and the following
yeai at Stanford which should .just about give her

a B.A. However, this is not the main purpose of
going to school. She matriculates in order to keep
slimmed down for the Olympic Games in '48.
Over the Springtime Recess we saw Brenda,
squired by Johnny Weissmuller, the working man's
Hamlet, attend a by those eminent
rnusicologoslst, Harrythehipster Gibson and Slim
Gaillard, of hod carrying fame.
We waved frantically at Brenda, but she didn't
recognize us behind those dark glasses we wear to
all movie town affairs.
* * *
If Roger Lap'm gets recalled from his seat in the
mayor's chair, we'd like to put forward Frank
"Lefty" O'Doul as his successor.
O'Doul would pull a large part of the North Beach
Italian population. He would capture the Liberal
and Socialist votes with the nickname of "Lefty."
We'll keep you posted on the campaign.
