### BILL STEIF 
We were talking to a chap yesterday afternoon
who had a little story to tell. He said that he had
been trying to get several biology books at the
Bookstore since the quarter began — April 1. He
had gone back a couple of times a week since the
beginning of last month and each time was told,
"Sorry, they aren't in yet—better try again in a
,t ouple of days."
Finally, in desperation our young man, observing
that the quarter was nearly half over, decided to
take the matter in his own hands. He went up to
the bookstore at San Mateo J.C. last Monday and
ordered the books he needed. Tuesday he returned
to San Mateo and, lo and behold, his books had ar
rived and he is now digging up great chunks of in
formation about such varied little organisms as pho-
planaria and radiolaria (we got these
names out of the well-known campus publication,
"Animals Without Backbones.")
Mind you, we don't want to jump on anybody—
this is just what a chap told us.

Speaking of science, we note that Dr. Alan Nunn

May, distinguished atomic physicist and former
lecturer at Kings College, was sentenced to ten
years in prison in London yesterday.
Dr. May pleaded guilty to the charge of giving
atomic bomb secrets and uranium samples to some
one, the "someone" being identified as a Russian
according to May's lawyer.
The British prosecutor, Attorney General Sir
Hartley Shawcross, stated that the "offense consists
of communicating information to unauthorized per
sons."
To us this whole thing has been pretty sad. Here
is a man of brilliant scientific bent about to be
jailed for what would probably have been the most
productive ten years of his life. That he committed
a technical crime according to the statutes of a
rampant nationalism seems certain.. Actually it
seems to us that Dr. May could have been right in
this case and the rest of a mediocre, wrangling
world wrong.
But maybe we're wrong —this atomic pace has
us slightly giddy.
