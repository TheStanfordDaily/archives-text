Well as Westbrook Pegler would say, "We're
forced to eat a hit of crow."
We hung one on the girls of Roble for their treat
ment of the food conservation drive and it would
now appear that the Daily article (that we quoted
in our column of Monday) did not have the com
plete facts. The Roble gals say that they are giving
up bread at dinner (and at lunch, at the discretion
of the dining hall director). In most instances we
are forced to take what we read in the news col
umns as fact.
Roble, then, is doing as much as any other group
<>n campus. Most of the men's eating ha'.ls have so
lar made little or no contribution to the conserva
tion of bread, and as far as last night's "student
government" meeting goes—the uncoordinated sit
uation continues in its merry leaderless way. Ex
com did get around to appointing someone to look
into the situation. A non member of Excom, and a
good man that has shown interest in the drive was
suggested by Daily editor Skidmore, after Excom
reached the momentous decision that "they should
look into things." A report is expected at next
week's meeting.
How many graves can you dig in a week? Enter
the contest. Excom now leading.

If you'd been along the Bayshore highway the
other day you would have seen an SF trucking
company hauling Quonset huts up to San Francisco
Jr. College. They'll be used to house student vet
erans.
Yale University announces that they will double
up students in their dormitories AND will cut the
rent in half.

Don't regard this as an iron-bound prediction but
take it as a kind of a hunch. The town of Santa

Funfest at one of the Row halls the other night
when housing dean Stanley Sharp walked in a hot
poker game. The Dr. did not come to try his luck.

Heard some Row girls bellowing at the freshman
class the other night . . . "To hell with '49 . .
Remember back when you first heard the fresh
man getting the yell. Then it was "to hell with '43."
How many roads and ships and starving millions

government" meeting goes—the uncoordinated sit

into the situation. A non member of Excom, and a
good man that has shown interest in the drive was

How many roads and ships and starving millions

Well as Westbrook Pegler would say, "We're
forced to eat a hit of crow."
We hung one on the girls of Roble for their treat
ment of the food conservation drive and it would
now appear that the Daily article (that we quoted
in our column of Monday) did not have the com
plete facts. The Roble gals say that they are giving
