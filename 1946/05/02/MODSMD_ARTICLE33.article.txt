color vacation, "Thrill of a Ro
mance" today.
A year old, "Thrill of a Romance"
is a report on Yosemite, stocked with
swimming pools, music, pine trees,
Esther Williams and Van Johnson.
What a combination for bobby-sox

ers—male and female!
Added for the adults is Lauritz
Melchior's magnificent voice singing
some arias and "Please Don't Say
No." Melchior, although far from
being a good Thespian, has a pleas
ing enough personality to make hit,
stay on the screen worth-while. He
particularly scores with Grieg's "1
Love Thee" and a Wagnerian aria
which enables him to show off his*
larynx to good advantage.
Tommy Dorsey is along on the
joy-ride to supply the music ana
Spring Byington and Henry Travers
score in minor roles. Miss Byington,
particularly, who has been off the
screen too long, evokes laughs from
the script when there aren't any.
Yosemite is inaccurately pictured
with a glorified Hollywood Hotel that
doesn't exist plus a swimming pool
that doesn't exist. But, the shots of
the falls are nice, and at least some
of the exterior shots were taken in
Ihe Valley. The picture will be good
for those who plan to go straight
through summer quarter,—Bob Peck
