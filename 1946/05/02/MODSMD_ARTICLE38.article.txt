After paddling U.S.C. for their
foul deed in avoiding a golf match
with Stanford, we thought that was
about all the rumpus we could raise
with the Troy lads for a while, but
we found a little more beefing to
do, so here goes.
Last Saturday, at the track meet
with Fresno State, D?an Cromwell
didn't enter one man in the javelin,
and why not? You guessed it. He
wasn't sure of a first place. Jerry
McNutt has been heaving the jave
lin in practice at the Bovard prac
tice field, but his distance hasn't
been too sharp.
So U.S.C. grabbed 14 first places
in the meet, and rather than spoil
their beautiful record, they just
avoided the 15th event. Isn't that
sweet of Troy to let Fresno State
take one event? They're so gener
ous at that Los Angeles school.

Two baseball games are sched
uled this weekend. On Friday and
Saturday afternoons, the Indian
squad plays host to U.C.L.A. And
if you don't personally know all 18
men on the two teams, you'll have
no idea who is playing what posi
tion, and who is at bat when. Nei
ther a public address system nor
programs are pi vided for the
games. The excuse that all schools

don't use numbers on their uni
forms is not valid this time, for both
Stanford and .U.C.L.A. have nu
merals firmly sewed on.
We don't know the intricacies of
the arrangement made with the
Tidewater Oil Company for the As
sociated public address system, but
if they're willing to set it up for
baseball games at Berkeley, it seems
fairly logical they would do the
same at the Sunken Diamond.
* * *
It's too late now for making any
satisfactory arrangements for this
weekend's series of games, but we
hope for the U.S.C. set of diamond
contests the following week, the
B.A.C. does provide some system of
informing the fans of pertinent in
formation about the frays.

few around who have done better
at the game than he has.

Two baseball games are sched
uled this weekend. On Friday and
Saturday afternoons, the Indian
squad plays host to U.C.L.A. And
if you don't personally know all 18
men on the two teams, you'll have
no idea who is playing what posi
tion, and who is at bat when. Nei
ther a public address system nor
programs are pi vided for the
games. The excuse that all schools

don't use numbers on their uni
forms is not valid this time, for both
Stanford and .U.C.L.A. have nu
merals firmly sewed on.
We don't know the intricacies of
the arrangement made with the
Tidewater Oil Company for the As
sociated public address system, but
if they're willing to set it up for
baseball games at Berkeley, it seems
fairly logical they would do the
same at the Sunken Diamond.

It's too late now for making any
satisfactory arrangements for this
weekend's series of games, but we
hope for the U.S.C. set of diamond
contests the following week, the
B.A.C. does provide some system of
informing the fans of pertinent in
formation about the frays.

Anybody have any good tips for
the Kentucky Derby on Saturday?
After doing some of the most con
sistent picking of last-place bang
tails, this writer hopes there are a
few around who have done better
at the game than he has.

Following the Daily's consistent
policy of having reporters on hand
for all big events, we will have first
hand coverage of the track meet
with U.S.C. on Saturday. H. D.
Thoreau, a track expert from way
back, will exclusively report to
Daily readers the happenings of the
day direct from the Coliseum in
Los Angeles.
After paddling U.S.C. for their
foul deed in avoiding a golf match
with Stanford, we thought that was
about all the rumpus we could raise
with the Troy lads for a while, but
we found a little more beefing to
do, so here goes.
Last Saturday, at the track meet
with Fresno State, D?an Cromwell
didn't enter one man in the javelin,
and why not? You guessed it. He
wasn't sure of a first place. Jerry
McNutt has been heaving the jave
lin in practice at the Bovard prac
tice field, but his distance hasn't
been too sharp.
So U.S.C. grabbed 14 first places
in the meet, and rather than spoil
their beautiful record, they just
avoided the 15th event. Isn't that
sweet of Troy to let Fresno State
take one event? They're so gener
ous at that Los Angeles school.
