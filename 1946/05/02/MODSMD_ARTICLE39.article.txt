our detention under house arrest by

of April 10.
"At first we were told by Maj.
Gen. Liu Chih-jen, the western
division commander, that we
were being guarded to protect
our own safety and that as soon
as the fighting ceased we'd be
free to move about at will. It is
now 11 days since we talked to
General Liu and fighting has long
since stopped but we are still un
able to move about Changchun.
"Guards at me door of our house
have made it clear they are acting
under orders to prevent us from
going out and to prevent visitors
from coming in. Gen. Chow Pao
chung, the (Communist) command
er in Changchun, has explained to
us that we are still being detained
'to protect our safety' against 'Kuo
mintang detectives.'
"We've made three offers since
April 19 to sign a document reliev

now peaceful city, but each of these
offers has been refused. The Tass

"We, the five undersigned Amer
ican correspondents, protest against
our detention under house arrest by
Chinese Communist troops in
Changchun. We have been interned
and held virtually incommunicado
under armed guard since the night
of April 10.
"At first we were told by Maj.
Gen. Liu Chih-jen, the western
division commander, that we
were being guarded to protect
our own safety and that as soon
as the fighting ceased we'd be
free to move about at will. It is
now 11 days since we talked to
General Liu and fighting has long
since stopped but we are still un
able to move about Changchun.
"Guards at me door of our house
have made it clear they are acting
under orders to prevent us from
going out and to prevent visitors
from coming in. Gen. Chow Pao
chung, the (Communist) command
er in Changchun, has explained to
us that we are still being detained
'to protect our safety' against 'Kuo
mintang detectives.'
"We've made three offers since
April 19 to sign a document reliev
ing the Communist army of all re
sponsibility for our safety in this
now peaceful city, but each of these
offers has been refused. The Tass
(Soviet Russian news agency) cor
respondent has full freedom of
movement.
