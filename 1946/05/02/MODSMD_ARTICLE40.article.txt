# Tracksters Face U.S.S.; Hopes Slight
## 
### H.D. ARMS 
Twenly-two Stanford "Davids"
leave tomorrow on the Noon Day
light for the dual meet with Dean
Cromwell's "Goliath" track aggrega
tion Saturday in the Los Angeles
Coliseum.
The possibility that Mell Patton,
U.S.C.'s crack sprinter, may not run
has given the Indians new hopes.
Patton with early season times of
9.7 and 21.1 for the 100 and 220, is
an outstanding prospect for the
N.C.A.A. sprint title in the latter
part of June.
SLOW CONDITIONING
Cromwell, who believes in slow
conditioning, may therefore choose
to leave the Trojan s printing to
George Bearnan and Jim O'Reilly.
He did not run Patton against Fresno
, State last week for this reason, and
i O'Reilly came through to win in
10.1 and 22.G. Meanwhile, Bearnan
was up at the Brigham Young Re
lays in Provo, Utah, winning the cen
tury in 10.1 also.
The hope that the locals could win
the javelin since there was no S.C.
| erjtry in that event against Fresno
was dispelled when it was learned
lhat Jerry McNutt, who has ap
proached 190 feet several times this
year, will be out throwing for Troy.
Indian John Kenward in his first
week of competition threw the jave
lin 166 last week.
STANFORD'S STANDING
Bob Millington, Stanford's premier
weightman, will not be able to make
; the trip south because of pressing
: business matters here.
George Grimes, Indian middle-dis
j tance man who did not run last
week-end because of a sore leg,
will make the trip south and prob
ably run the 880. Jim Slosson, S.C.'s
best, ran through a 1:56.9 half last
| week, one second setter than Grimes'
, best. However, the Card, in top
| form, should better his 1:58 mark
easily.
INDIAN HOPES LOW
Jack Weiershauser, Indian coach,
will be shooting for 30 points against
the potential-champion Trojans. If
his team reaches this total, he can
consider the trip worth while.
While the bulk of the S.C. team
was defeating Fresno easily Satur
day, Beaman, Madisan Meredith, and
Bob Hart took the trip up to Utah as
a favor to the management of that
meet. Hart won the pole vault at 13
feet 6 inches, while Meredith cap
tured the high jump at 6-2 and
j took third in the vault at 12 feet
even.
It is some consolation to note that
the Trojans at least won't be enter
ing in any other meets this week
end, giving Stanford the prestige of
J meeting the team full strength.
