Nevada, as we suspected before,
will be the next Pacific Coast school
to go in for big - time athletics.
Proselyting is going full steam
ahead at the Reno institution and
the athletic moguls there have ar
ranged a tough schedule for the
Wolf Pack.
One player, who is going to be
discharged from the Navy at the
end of this week at Shoemaker, re
marked that Nevada offered him
"the best scholarship deal he ever
heard of." Besides the G.I. Bill,
which will pay for his tuition, he
said he will collect $45 a month
from the university, plus (and get
this) a vacation with his wife ev
ery year back Eastâ€”expense free.
WOLF PACK ON THE PROWL
Offering money like that, Nevada
must know they have a good foot
ball player. He played for the Mem
phis service team which walloped
Tulane last year, 40-7. Before en
tering the Navy, he had an athletic
scholarship at Syracuse and has
since been offered a liberal scholar
ship at Boston College. As a warn
ing to other Pacific Coast schools
which have scheduled Ne- ada,
watch out for the Wolf x J ack.
They're going to be on the prowl
next season.
California, St. Mary's, and Santa
Clara all play games with Nevada
next season. Besides these three
big schools, smaller schools like
Santa Barbara State will make up
the rest of the schedule.
FINAL GAME AT HONOLULU
Final game of the season for Ne
vada will be a game with the Uni
versity of Hawaii in Honolulu. For
this game the team will fly to the
Islands by Clipper. As the fellow
with the liberal scholarship re
marked. "That sure will be hard
to take."
Yep, Nevada's hitting the big
time next fall. Watch out, St.
Mary's, the Nevada offers are pretty
good. They're stealing your thun
der!
