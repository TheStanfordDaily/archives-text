# Bull-etin Board's 'Tail' A Bit Twisted
## 
### SHIRLEY ROGERS 
i How many times a week do you
i stop to read the student bulletin
| boards at the Union, or Engineering
, corner, or History corner? If you
don't read them at all, you're miss
| ing some flashes of genius in humor
| and salesmanship.
' For sale: One slightly used axe,
without handle but still in good
[ condition," said one sign on the
| Union bulletin board, after Sun
{ day night's quiet escapade. We
wonder if Bill Steif is holding out
for ransom.
NO HANDS
One brilliant student had offered
j a watch for sale that was automatic,
' self-winding, waterproof, stinless
J steel, radium dial. However, some
J thoughtful person had added "no
j hands" as an after-thought. These
I after-thought artists are the mak-
I ing of some signs.
"Found: One pair of shoes on
I April 16. Owner claim them at lost
and found department in the Cash
! ier's Office (before they are worn
j out)." We don't know whether the
I personnel of the Cashier's Office
j needs footwear, but perhaps a
j "Saddles for Cashiers" drive could
J be instigated for the barefoot work
ers.
BEAUTY OR BRAINS
We also found out what the Stan
ford Rough thinks of women. A
long article was posted the other
! day which quoted Billy Rose say
ing that "Beautiful Women Don't
Go to College." "AMEN." was the
! profound remark some brave male
i had made.
Do you want a davenport, a
! leather upholstered folding bed, an
oak dining table, a desk, a man's
i "byke," a Coleman oil heater (for
i those midnight snacks), a midnight
| blue tuxedo, a 1940 Mercury sedan,
or tutoring in Strength of Mate
j rials? See what the junior sales
! have to say in their soothing
| bulletin board advertisements.
JANE RUSSELL LINES
Of course, you have all joined the
" 'Jane Russell Bosom Buddies

Club' by forming a line at Judge
McMahen's office at noon on Sat
urday." We have inside informa
tion from Jane Russell that this
club has nothing to do with the
June Allyson Fan Club.
Any members of the student body
who have an urge to go upper-class
and desire a change of scenery are
offered a three-room furnished Nob
Hill apartment in exchange for a
Stanford apartment, by a desperate,
room-seeking couple.
THESES, TERMS
We noted one enterprising girl
has offered to do typing of theses
and term papers "at regular rates."
How can she do even a regular rate,
when the sign was handwritten in
brown ink?
If Stanford ever gets its airfield,
things will really start flying. That
is, if someone will buy the Boeing
built PT-17 which is offered for sale
at the slight sum of $1,500 â€”only
tuition for almost fifteen quarters of
school.
ANATOMY FOR SALE
Everyone who has ever read the
Cellar bulletin board will remem
ber the fellow who offered "Gray's
Anatomy" for sale. Personally, we
are inclined to sympathize with
Gray. He wasn't getting a fair deal
out of the transaction.
There are still evidences of the
tragic veterans' housing problem.
Not long ago, one pathetic sign
pleaded for a four-room apartment
near Stanford for a veteran, his
wife, and two children because he
"found it a little difficult to com
mute between the Farm and Los
Angeles every day."
USED CAR SIGN
We wonder if the Amm 2/c from
Moffett Field ever found his 1920
Pierce - Arrow or LaSalle touring
"convertible sedan, preferably sev
en - passenger with small folding
seats in front of the back seat." Sad
to say, his sign has seen many a
winter from the looks of it.
Seriously, the bulletin boards all
over campus serve as an informing
agency, an advertising agency, a
complaint department, a lost and
found department, and, moreover,
as a former of student opinion upon
such vital topics as the atomic
bomb, veterans' housing, and the
current "Heifers for Relief" Drive.
This is your chance. If you have
anything to say, say it on the bul
letin board.
