# Voluntary Food Conservation Gets Excom Recommendation
## 
### 
Excom recommends cooperation of all University living
groups in the current food conservation campaign. The im
| mediate aim is to urge a 40 per cent cut on all wheat consump
; tion on campus and a 20 per cent decrease in the use of fats
and oils.
Bob Collins was appointed, to contact house managers in
each living group and inform them of Excom's recommenda-
I tion.
Women's halls have thus far demonstrated the most re
sponse to the voluntary campaign. Lagunita led the way by
: giving up bread at one meal per day; Union, Roble and Bran
ner followed. Since that time these houses and some Row
houses have implemented the movement by cutting down on
i salad oils, wheat cereals and breads, and by some, relegation
of cakes and pies to the luxury list.
