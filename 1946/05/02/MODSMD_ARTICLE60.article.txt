# Pierce Plugs 'Crazy House'
## 
### FRANKLIN PIERCE, Jr 
Cosmo Pflink, the eminent psy- !
chiatrist, once remarked that the
only way to achieve true happiness
is to rid yourselves of your inhi- j
bitions. He said, "The only way to
achieve true happiness is to rid j
yourself of your inhibitions."
Pierce Hall is taking this advice j
to heart when they present their j
final annual dance of the year, en- j
titled the "Crazy House," this Sat
urday night from 9 to 1.
The "Crazy House" or "Screw !
Ball," as you may prefer, is an all
campus affair which means that |
even you can come. The chairman |
promises lots of surprises. (Sur- !
prisesâ€”that's Lithuanian for "Get
the needle and thread, mother, the I
guests are splitting their sides.")
From all reports the dance is j
shaping up to be one of the most j
eventful events of this eventful j
year. The refreshments and deco- \
rations will match the theme of !
the dance and will contribute great- j
ly to one of the finest social events |
of the decade. President Sam Bren- J
ner and Chairman George Eckstein
have stated that this dance will be
more weird than Stan Shpctner j
joining Ram's Head.
And by the way, if you want to j
know where the Axe is, just drop
around to the birthplace of the j
fourteenth President of the United |
States, Franklin Pierce, this Satur
day night.
