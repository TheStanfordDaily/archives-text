history reveals, when he noticed
that it was on fire. He rushed in
and saved some valuable furni
.ture, suffering minor cuts and
bruises.
Grateful O'Hara gave him a writ
ten promise, saying in effect: "My
executor will pay you $1,000 after
my death."
When Henry tried to collect he
was surprised to find that Archer
O'Hara, executor of the will, refused
to pay. He took the case to court.
The lower court gave the deci

written statement was no contract,
but merely a voluntary, gratuitous
promise.
