# Fall Shift in Men's Housing Causes Spring Voting Dilemma
## 
### 
An election reconversion problem
\ faced Excom last night when a pro
posal to postpone men's Excom dis
trict elections till autumn quarter
was tabled for further discussion
among men's living groups.
Specifically, the question posed
the problem of deciding just what
men could vote in the coming A.S.-
! S.U. elections, scheduled for May
! 23. Under area representation,
j men's voting districts are divided
into Upper Row, Lower Row, En
, cina, and Branner and Toyon. each
i area housing from 400 to 500 men.
Betty Wellington, recently ap-
I pointed by Excom to survey dis
; trict voting areas, suggested that
| the four men's Excom elections
be postponed until the second
week of autumn quarter. With
the exception of fraternity actives
and pledges, few men will know
their voting areas until next fall,
I she reported.
Reason for Exccm's dilemma is
; the over-all shift in population be
tween areas to take place when (1)
Branner Hall is returned to men
! students, (2) men's Row houses are
returned to fraternities, and (3)
1 freshmen and veterans are com
| bined in Encina next fall.
Complicating the voting problem,
peculiar to this year, is the ex
pected return of approximately
one-eighth of the men's Row popu
lation needed to fill the houses, and
admission of no:i-fraternity veter
ans, freshmen, and transfers who
I arc expected to constitute a large
portion of the voting population
from other areas.
A motion by Jack Wallace to
let all fraternity and non-frater
nity men now living on the Row

vote for Upper and Lower Row
Excom representatives this spring
was dropped with the discovery
that this would lead to duplica
tion of votes when Ilall repre
sentatives would be elected au
tumn quarter.

There will be a meeting of all
men's hall presidents or vice
presidents at Fillmore Ilall Mon
day night at (Mo. Ilall olTicers
arc asked to call Jack Wallace,
P.A. 7556 or 871(5.

Offices for which men may vote
in this month's elections are A.S.-
S.U. president, vice-president, and
Men's Council member.
A special election will be held
this spring to fill a vacancy on
Men's Council; Lucian Rice, coun
cil member, resigned recently be
cause of illness. His successor will
take office immediately following
the spring election to remain until
regular council elections next win
ter quarter.
In a move designed to arouse
interest in the elections, Election
Board chairman obtained Excom's
approval to sanction spontaneous
electioneering bv candidates for
A.S.S.U. offices, provided no mon
ey is spent in the process. Specific
intention with Excom's approval
is to let candidates speak to vari
ous living groups, thereby ac
quainting students with would-be
student body officers.
