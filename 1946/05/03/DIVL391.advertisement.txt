For Mother s
Sweet Tooth
ERNEST Wilson, '96. has been busy in his
beautiful candy kitchen again making his
gooooood candics especially for the Stan
ford men and women who will be sending it
home for Mother's Day, May 12, a week from
Sunday.
There'll be plenty for your selection, so you
needn't drop everything right this minute and
rush down to choosc a box. It is a good idea,
however, if your mother lives far away to get
down early and send it off now.
If she has a sweet tooth, she'll love Wilson'*
candy.

For Mother s
Sweet Tooth
ERNEST Wilson, '96. has been busy in his
beautiful candy kitchen again making his
gooooood candics especially for the Stan
ford men and women who will be sending it
home for Mother's Day, May 12, a week from
Sunday.
There'll be plenty for your selection, so you
needn't drop everything right this minute and
rush down to choosc a box. It is a good idea,
however, if your mother lives far away to get
down early and send it off now.
If she has a sweet tooth, she'll love Wilson'*
candy.
