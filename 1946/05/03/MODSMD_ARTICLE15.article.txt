SAN FRANCISCO, May 2 (UP).
—Rebellious convicts on Aleatraz
Island, federal penitentiary, seized
an arsenal of guns tonight in a des
(jcrate, bloody break for freedom
and fought a savage battle from a
ccll-bloek barricade with counter
attacking guards and U.S. Marines.
At least six guards were wound
ed and one killed. They were felled
by sharp-shooting convicts as they
advanced courageously to the very
walls of the rebel stronghold on the
eastern shoreline of "the Rock"—
the nation's toughest prison.
Hie insurrectionists gained pos
session of a prison gun gallery.
Armed with a machine gun and
small arms, thev returned shot

for shot in blazing combat on the
hlackcd-out isle a mile and a half
cast of the San Francisco shore
line.
The battle was still raging at 9
p.m.—seven hours after it broke out
with spectacular violence early in
the afternoon. A detachment of
more than 20 Marines, many of
them veterans of jungle fighting
against Japanese, landed on tiie is
land. But the situation, according
to Warden James A. Johnston, re
mained out of hand.

At 11:10 p.m. the convicts were
in complete control of the cell -
block, using guns obtained from
the gallery. Meanwhile, a ring of
Navy, C'oast Guard craft, and
other boats were playing search
lights on the island, bringing it in
full view of thousands of specta
tors watching from the San Fran
cisco waterfront.

The desperate inmates, headed
by a ringleader with a machine
gun, imprisoned most of the pris
on's officers. Since the officers
became virtual hostages, the fight
ing guards and military authori
ties were reluctant to open an all
out offensive against the rebels.
Casualties were arriving at the
San Francisco waterfront early in
the cv?ning. Launch crewmen re
ported all of the embattled convicts
had obtained guns. Other non
combatant inmates were herded
into a separate yard.
Capt. James Logan, at High
way Patrol headquarters on the
Golden Gate Bridge, said that a
prisoner named "Coy" overpow

creri a guard, took his machinc
gun, pressed an electric button
that opened up all the cell doors,
and invited the prisoners to join
him in the hrcak.
Twelve inmates at once rushed
out and grabbed several other
guards, stole their guns, and scat
tered throughout the cell-block. It
was not known how many others of
the 300 convicts later joined the re
volt.
The rattle of machine-gun fire,
interspersed with rifle shots, blast
ed from the convicts' stronghold.
Daring prison guards, crawling
along a catwalk and over walls sur
rounding the cell - block, fired
through the bars at the rebels in
side. They attacked at close rang''
with sawed-off shotguns, gas-bomb
guns, rifles, and pistols.
A detachment of 20 Marines,
many of them veterans of fighting
against Japanese snipers, landed
on Alcatraz Island at K:18 p.m.
They went ashore on the north
ern side of the isle from the boat
PC-799, under coiftmand of War
rant Oflicer C. Al Buckncr.
The Leathernecks were equipped
with small arms, tear gas bombs,
and smoke grenades.
Two wounded Alcatraz guards
were landed at Fort McDowell pier
on the San Francisco waterfront at
7:30 p.m. One man was a stretcher
case, with a gunshot flesh wound
in his shoulder. The second casu
alty was limping with a flesh wound
in his left leg. Another wounded
man, an ambulance case, was land
ed at the Aquatic Park pier.

launch said:
