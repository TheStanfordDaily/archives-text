# UNRRA Begs for Food Conservation Support; Stanford Responds Slowly
## 
### 
UNRRA Director Fiorello H. LaGuardia put new
impetus behind his drive to channel more food to
starvation areas yesterday when he urged the nation
to meet its goal of sending 225,000,000 bushels of wheat

to famine areas abroad this year.
LaGuardia was asked if he shared
the belief of Secretary of Agricul
ture Clinton P. Anderson that the
grain bonus plan would enable this
country to meet that goal.
"I have to," he replied. "It's our
only hope."
Meanwhile Frank Gannett,
president of (lie Gannett News
papers, returned from Europe
with a group of other editors and
publishers, and reported that the
food situation in Germany and
Austria is critical now and will
be "appalling" in Austria after
June 1.
Al the same time President Tru
man declared that government con
trols on meat would be removed if
such action is necessary to destroy
the nationwide black market.
The Senate Agriculture Com
mittee recommended immediate
removal of all price controls and
subsidies on meat.
The committee filed its report,
after three weeks of hearings, as
Mr. Truman threw his support
behind Secretary of Agriculture
Anderson who (old the commit
tee yesterday that price controls
might have to be abandoned un
less livestock can he forced itno
legitimate channels.
Mr. Truman discussed the situa
tion briefly at his press conference.
In response to other questions on
the general food situation, he said:
1. He sees no prospect, of a return
to food rationing unless the nation
suffers a disastrous crop failure. If
that happened, he said, the govern
ment would not hesitate to reinsti
tutc rationing.
2. He plans no new food conser
vation measures. He said he had
made effective all those he could
think of.
He does not think it will be
necessary for (he government to
seize wheat for famine areas, now

Achcson had said such drastic ac

And how's your food conservation coming?
Typical dawn-to-sundown eating schedule of the
Stanford student leaves ample room for contraction.
Breakfast —students can aid the drive by omitting
an extra slab of toast, substituting oatmeal or corn

flakes for wheat cereals.
Cellar-time—most of us buy cin
namon rolls from habit, students
who have missed breakfast except

Lunch—students can order or be
served something other than sand
wiches. If bread comes with the

bread isn't scheduled, don't ask for
it.
Mid-afternoon hunger-time- the
run to the nearest drive-in is fun,
if students don't order'hamburgers
and sandwiches unnecessarily.
Dinner—potatoes can serve in the
place of bread; salad oils can be
sparingly used if at all; fried foods
can be cut from the menu; cakes
and pies can be skipped entirely.
