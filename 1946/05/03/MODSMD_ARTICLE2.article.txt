Ben Bushong, a national director
for "Heifers for Relief," told 75
prospective cattle - chaperons in
Cubbcrley Auditorium yesterday
that 35.000 head of cattle have been
shipped overseas, with 200,000 the
goal by 1947. "Heifers" now has 50
ships in shuttle service, with 50
more to take up duties by next year.
"It takes 25 volunteer cattle
tenders per ship," said Bushong,
"and you have some idea of the
number of men we need."
Al Strain, head of the local "Heif
er'' committee, announced that the
drive has netted 12 heifers through
cattle gifts and cash contributions
thus far, with the campaign closing
Monday. Booths will be set up for
the last time Monday at History
corner, the Engineering corner, and
the post office.
Men who volunteer for the "Heif
er'' jobs will receive $150 per trip
and $2.50 per day for every day
they await shipment. They will
probably report to Texas ports.
