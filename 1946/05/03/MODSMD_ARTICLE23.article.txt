July 4, 1946, anniversary of America's in
dependence, is to herald independence for
the Philippine Islands. Long the dream of
Fil'pino leaders, independence, following on
tho heoh of a devastating war and enemy
occupation, now seems to many to be a du
bious honor and the least desirable of a
number of evils.
Tha main reason for Filipinos hesitation in
accepting the freedom which the U. S. is
finally thrusting upon them is the almost
cc 1 v.o economic chaos now facing the
cc. try. About 70 per cent of Manila's built
up areas (which include more than half the
machine industry of the islands) was de
stroyed or severely damaged. The cities and
towns of Luzon, main island in the archi
pelago, are from 30 to 60 per cent ruined.
Japanese occupation inflation, wild black
n. ~ rketeering, and almost complete stoppage
of agricultural and industrial production are
all contributing to keep the Philippines in
the most appalling economic mess it has
ever seen. •
Politically, too, the islands are split. Class
differences, sharpened by the war, have re
solved themselves into a rich-collaboration
ist vs. poor-*esistance-worker fight. One of
the Line .Lest issues in the islands now is the
problem of how to punish the collaborators
and, actually, how to determine who was a
collaborator.
Such high government officials as Manuel
Ro::as, ru-:wly-elected president, have not es
caped collaborationist charges. And his run-
and vice-president, former Assem
blyman Elpidio Quirino, wrote a letter prom
ising obedience and help to Japan before
Bataan fell, later joining the puppet council
of state.
Roxas, backed by conservative business
leaders, nevertheless proclaims himself a
liberal, an argument which is not enough to
cc. ince the powerful Hukbalahap, peasant
guerilla organization in Central Luzon.
Leaning strongly to the left, the Huk is
fighting hard for the right to own the land
they have worked under a tenant-farmer
system befcre the war. In the election the
Huk backed former President Sergio Osme
na, quiet, middle-of-the-road man.
The United States' answers to these prob
lems are three-fold:
1. Independence. Even this would
mean strong Philippine economic depend
ence on the United States for years to come
coupled with prohibitive tariff barriers on
island exports as a result of her new politi
cal status.
2. The Bell bill now be/ore Congress
which proposes (with independence) to
extract extraordinary monopolist trading
rights for Americans in the Philippines in
exchange tor a 30-year extension of limit
ed duty-free export quotas on sugar, copra,
coconut oil, hemp and other products we
need. In effect it gives Americans the
rights of dual citizenship wiihout recip
rocal benefits for the Filipinos.

It has even more serious ramifications.
It would leave the Philippines wide open
to foreign exploitation. According to High
Commissioner Paul V. McNutt's secretary,
Jose Reyes, it "would make the position of
the Philippines worse than China under
exlraterritoriality and vjorse than Egypt
under the capitulations."
3. The Tydings Rehabilitation bill of
1945 giving the Philippines $450,000,000 to
rebuild private homes, industries, and
ether installations. Another $125,000,000
will restore roads, bridges, and port and
harbor facilities. In addition, surplus Army
property valued at 5150,00,000 will be used
to reconstruct public buildings and utili
ties.
More forthcoming help is $100,000,000 in
civilian-relief supplies from UNRRA, and
compensation provisions in Philippine Army
pay and redemption of guerrilla currency.
Of chief importance in Philippines recov
ery, however, is unstinted and unequivocal
economic help from the United States in
the form of free trade; minimum tariff regu
lations; money, men, and machines to re
build the cities; and food until the islands
are once more self-supporting in that field.
Political aid is coming through President
Truman's directive to jail and try all known
collaborators, orders that are being carried
out now under High Commissioner McNutt.
Pushing demands for political and eco
nomic reforms is the Democratic Alliance,
a new party composed of the Huk and 15
other peasant, guerrilla, youth, and liberal
organizations. Popular Front in character, it
is a progressive, vital force which President
Roxas will have to satisfy before political
unity can be achieved.
Still highly probable is the* chance that
Filipinos will ask the United States to shelve
independence plans in lieu of extended status
as a commonwealth or even possible admis
sion into the Union. Though late President
Manuel Quezon would probably turn over
in his grave at this suggestion, it is one
which hSis strong potential support from the
Filipino people.
In spite of what many Americans may
think, the average Filipino likes us, our
brand of democracy, and the security and
protection which American government of
fgfs. They have shown this by their actions
during the war, and the proposition is one
which Congress will have to consider seri
ously before going off the deep end by giv
ing the Philippines complete independence
in the time of the greatest need.
It is certainly something which the Ameri
can people, virtually illiterate on the subject
of U. S. possessions and their peoples, must
consider. For the success or failure of our
relations with our territorial possessions is
in large part a measure of the success or
failure we will achieve in our international
relations.—M.S.
