Seven minutes after eight in the morning
and the student sends up curses to the gods
because he's driven his 'smooth job," '36
model, around the Quad five times and hasn't

somewhere and begins the hike to Quad.

Don Bechter of Mens' Council pointed out

tion, which he will take to the Administra
tion, is that one of the lots near Branner and
Toyon be leveled out for immediate use.
Tell the jalop she may get a legal resting
spot any day now.
