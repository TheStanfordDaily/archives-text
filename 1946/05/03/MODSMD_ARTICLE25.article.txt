CHINESE STUDENT SPEAKS 1)1'
To the Editor:
I would like to make some comments on the arti
cle written by Bill Steif concerning China.
It is true as Mr. Steif said, that the majority of
the people in central and southern parts of China
hove been living "on just about the subsistence
margin for centuries." However, the same situation
exists in the northern part of China. There, the
competition for food is just a§ keen as in the South,
and in some cases even worse.
Furthermore, to say that the southern Chinese
is "a great, disorganized neutral mass which can
be shoved around with comparative ease" and that
they are "without regard to consideration of
what we might tall a political level" is just as ab
surd as to say that all the geniuses in America
are from Massachusetts and all the morons from
Alabama.
It is absolutely FALSE that "since the Soviet rev
olution the opportunities for education have im
proved a thousand per cent" in northern China,
"has undoubtedly a Marxist twist," and "has becomc
Communistic." Not a single atom of any part of

China has had its opportunities for education in
creased a thousand per cent.
If Mr. Steif insists that the Soviet Revolution
had affected tin- educational opportunities ol the
people of northern China, then it will have the
same effect as World War II had on the increase ol
refrigerations or buying by Eskimos.
In conclusion, 1 would like to state something
which some Americans fail to realize. There is not
a clear-cut division line, like the Mason-Dixon line
in the Civil War, existing between the northern
(the so-called Communists) and central-southern
(the Nationalists, Fascists, or whatever the h
you like to call them) factions. There are just as
many Nationalists in the North as in the South,
and Communists are found in the South as well as
in the North.
'Ihe mere fact that the Communists have their
headquarters in a northern province makes the
observed inclined to believe that they are "north
ern." The northern Chinese is just as good or bad,
intelligent or dumb, as the southern Chinese.
Very truly yours,
A Chinese Student.
