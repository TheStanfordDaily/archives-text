horse statue in the lonesome grass I
near the Red Barn. Memories stir

old timers.
These are the leftovers of one of
(he sunniest, shoutin'est eras in
(lie whole Stanford story, when
the driving will and the hank
roll of Leiand Stanford flashed
through (he horse-breeding world
_ like a meteor, and like a meteor
quickly sank into cold memory, j
These were the lusty, sweat-and- ]
leather years of the Palo Alto Stock i
| Farm when the Senator reigned in j
feudal comfort and the Quad was j
j a sunny field on the edge of the
greatest horse-kingdom in America. |
From the Palo Alto Farm the
great breed of Ihe "Electioneers"
spread to stables and trotting
tracks the world over. The blue
and-pink-clad backs of Stanford
drivers hunched low in the sul
kies behind the Hashing hooves of
a hundred record-winning beau
; ties.
Leiand Stanford bred for speed j
j and he bred for cash return. His
| progressive colt - education and
j his half - business, half - sporting
! passion for quality set the name
Palo Alto ringing in sportsmen's
cars in Europe and America be
tween 187(> and 19011.
The Farm was an immense labo- |
|ratory dedicated to the develop
; ment of trotting speed. Seventy to
1 80 hoYses trained daily. The stable.* .
I during their service barracked over
j 20 stallions and some 300 brood i
I mares. A staff of 300 men at one j
; time or another earned their wages ]
j catering to the horses. Harness rac- j
' ing was the thing, and Palo Alto
was the model.
The pile of white bones in the j
Museum cellar is the last of Elec
tioneer, by Ilambeltonian out of
Green Mountain Maid. His 93
and 72 daughters sent his
blood through the veins of the
greatest horse family in American j
racing history.
Before the 1870's the blue grass
of Kentucky nourished America's
! growing interest in harness rac- ;
ing. Then Californians, with Stan
ford in the lead, began buying
from the two leading Eastern
breeds, tlx' "liumheltonians" and
Ihe "Clays."
Leiand Stanford had turned to

| harness racing on his physician's
orders, but the relaxing hobby be
came a business as did anything the
hardheaded railroad baron touched,
lie was determined to prove his
theories of the horse by the same
standard by which he had proven
\jjs. other ventures -production.
Stanford inspired photographic
j studies of the horse in motion which
I laid the basis for the motion pic
| lure industry, rle was bent on
proving those breeders right who
: insisted on breeding "running
I blood" into trotters by mating them
with thoroughbred flat-racing stock.
Many of the Stanford horses had
from a quarter to half a strain of
"running blood," but this oxperi-
I merit eventually gave way before
the time-clipping speeds of com
peting "pure" trotters. The Horse
i Review of 1917 said Stanford had
: difficulty in keeping his cross-bred
j colts on the trot when the chips
! wt're down in a fast race.
But the greatest fame of the
Palo Alto Stock Farm came in the
field of colt training. Palo Alto
was both the world's largest trot
ter breeding farm and the world's
largest trotter nursery.
The trotter world was split over
j this question of colt training. The
[ majority felt a colt should not be
i trained until he was mature enough
! to take the grind. Otherwise his
| muscles and his staying power
j might be weakened. "Early devel
j opment, early decay," and "Wait
| and win" were the dominant slo
| gans.
Colt racing, however, was a big
I lure to the owners who must board
| and' care for the animals. At county
j fairs and breeders' meetings colt
j racing began to edge in in the late
j^Zgv..
Stanford believed in the racing of
colt's. His Palo Alto Farm was de
; voted to proving him right. In the
i training circles near the Red Barn
j and at the track, then located be
! Lake Lagunita and the golf
| counse road, the Palo Alto colts be

gan to train as soon as they were
weaned.
Heavy shoe weights were drop- '
ped. Long training sessions were ;
eliminated in favor of short-burst |
methods. Miniature tracks were i
laid out to teach the ABC's. The |
system was so rigid that the great- j
est of Electioneers sons, Sunol, j
waited until four days before his j
first race in 1888 to drive the full j
mile from wire to wire.
In 1877 a two-year record of 2
minutes .'{l seconds (2:31) was
set. In 1880 a Stanford two-year
old, Fred Crocker, shaved this to
2:25'/i. In 1881, Ilinda Rose, a 1
yearling, cut 20 seconds from the
record of her class with Stanford
methods.
In 1882 the two-year-old Wild- |
flower clipped a 2:21 mile. These
performances were the beginning of
a long struggle between the pro
gressive colt education preached at
Palo Alto and the more hide-bound
methods of Kentucky. The chips
were down in this first test of a
Stanford education.

mile from wire to wire.
In 1877 a two-year record of 2

mile from wire to wire.
In 1877 a two-year record of 2
