# Indian Swimmers Favored Against Winged ‘O’, Cal
## Record-Breaking Poolmen Expect Little Opposition from California 
### 
One of the finest swimming teams
in the country, our Stanford mer
men get a chance to prove their
prowess this week-end in two dif
ferent meets. Although the Olympic
Club in San Francisco tonight and
Cal here tomorrow, the Farm
swimmers should be able to keep
their record untouched.
Although at (lie disadvantage of
swimming in a strange pool, our
local splashers have already de
feated the Clubbers in one dual
encounter. Scoring heavily in all
events except diving the last time,
tonight's meet should just be a
warm-up for the big all'air to
morrow with the Bears. The first
race is scheduled for 8:30 tonight
at the Olympic Club pool. There
will be an admission fee.
Saturday afternoon brings a lit
tle different problem to Coach Tom
Haynie's charges. The Bear swim
mers have done fairly well this
season. They defeated the Treasure
Island team by a score of 55 to 22.
Against the same team Stanford
polled 53 points to the Sailors' 22.

; And in other meets the Bears have
run up almost Identical numerical
i scores. But when the clocked times
, for the different races are checked
: the superiority of the Stanford team
shows tin.
In the dashes, Bnhby Anderson
should have little trouble com
ing through, even if he has a
poor day. Armstrong might have
trouble in the 44(1 free-style, for
Bean of Cal has set a mark of
I 5:14 in this race. In most of the
other events, except (living, Stan
ford should have little trouble
giving Cal the well-known Axe,
in a legal way.
The big meet will be held in the
Stanford pool at 1:30 Saturday af
ternoon. Admission will be 80 cents
without student body cards and 40
! ducats.
