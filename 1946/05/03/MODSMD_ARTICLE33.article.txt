## Stanford Underdog Against Trojans 
### 
Coach Jack Weiershauser and his Stanford spike
sters entrain today on the Noon Daylight for their dual
meet with UIS.C. in the Los Angeles Coliseum. With
the exception of weight man Bob Millington, the Red
squad will be in lull strength. Twenty-two Redskins
are on the traveling roster. ♦

Paced by such speed merchants
as Al Lawrence, hurdle and broad
jump star; Roland Sink, distance
runner supreme, and Mel Patton,
probable N.C.A.A. dash champ for
this year, Dean Cromwell's ag
gregation will make it warm for
the Farm boys.
The men from Troy are shooting
lor the national championship this
year and so far have mowed down
I any opposition that stood in their
I way. If the Trojans are in top
| shape, they should walk away with
I 95 or upwards of the possible 131
points. If the Indians manage to
grab two firsts and enough seconds
and thirds to total 33 points, it will
be a moral victory.
The mile run should prove easy
for Sink, who has circled the four
laps in 4:15 this season. Stan
ford's best toiler, Frank Ganahl,
lowered his time to 4:27 last week,
hut that's his best. If Patton does
not run tomorrow as has been in
dicated. the 100-yard dash might
fall into Captain Martin Ander
son's lap. S.C.'s number two man
in the century covers the yardage
in 10.1, which is two-tenths of a
second slower than Captain An
derson's best time.
George Grimes, Stanford middle
distance star, will give rough com
petition in either the 440 or the 880
according to which one of the events
Coach Weiershauser enters him in.
His times are a little slower than
S.C.'s, but then again he hasn't been
beaten as yet. Some runners have
that "win complex" and we think
Grimes is one of them.
Ed Luce will vie with Trojans
Tom Follis and Bill Wakefield in
the high jump. According to past
performances, Luce should have
the edge on the duo. Luce also
has yet to be beaten in competi
tion this season. This will be one
blue ribbon event for Stanford.
Pole vaulter Bill Larson will be
pointing for 13 feet 6 inches tomor
row and a first place. His best vault
this season was 13 even. One S.C.
vaulter has gone 14 feet, but it is
expected that 6 inches less will be
the highest mark tomorrow.
If Trojan Al Lawrence is in top
shape tomorrow, he will broad jump
3 feet farther than the closest Stan
ford man. Unless he breaks his
leg, he is sure of a first place .any-
I how.
The weight events will again
! prove to be Stanford's downfall.
With Millington not making the
trip, the Kcd squad will be fortu
{ nate to nab a couple of fourths
for the entire three events.
J "Moose" Thompson of S.C. tosses
the shot 5(1 feet and the discus
1/4, and Jerry McNutt throws the
javelin 175 feet with ease.

The weight events will again

With Millington not making the

for the entire three events.
J "Moose" Thompson of S.C. tosses

Coach Jack Weiershauser and his Stanford spike
sters entrain today on the Noon Daylight for their dual
meet with UIS.C. in the Los Angeles Coliseum. With
the exception of weight man Bob Millington, the Red
squad will be in lull strength. Twenty-two Redskins
are on the traveling roster. ♦

Paced by such speed merchants
as Al Lawrence, hurdle and broad
jump star; Roland Sink, distance
runner supreme, and Mel Patton,
probable N.C.A.A. dash champ for
this year, Dean Cromwell's ag
gregation will make it warm for
the Farm boys.
The men from Troy are shooting
lor the national championship this
year and so far have mowed down
I any opposition that stood in their
I way. If the Trojans are in top
| shape, they should walk away with
I 95 or upwards of the possible 131
points. If the Indians manage to
grab two firsts and enough seconds
and thirds to total 33 points, it will
be a moral victory.
The mile run should prove easy
for Sink, who has circled the four
laps in 4:15 this season. Stan
ford's best toiler, Frank Ganahl,
lowered his time to 4:27 last week,
hut that's his best. If Patton does
not run tomorrow as has been in
dicated. the 100-yard dash might
fall into Captain Martin Ander
son's lap. S.C.'s number two man
in the century covers the yardage
in 10.1, which is two-tenths of a
second slower than Captain An
derson's best time.
George Grimes, Stanford middle
distance star, will give rough com
petition in either the 440 or the 880
according to which one of the events
Coach Weiershauser enters him in.
His times are a little slower than
S.C.'s, but then again he hasn't been
beaten as yet. Some runners have
that "win complex" and we think
Grimes is one of them.
Ed Luce will vie with Trojans
Tom Follis and Bill Wakefield in
the high jump. According to past
performances, Luce should have
the edge on the duo. Luce also
has yet to be beaten in competi
tion this season. This will be one
blue ribbon event for Stanford.
Pole vaulter Bill Larson will be
pointing for 13 feet 6 inches tomor
row and a first place. His best vault
this season was 13 even. One S.C.
vaulter has gone 14 feet, but it is
expected that 6 inches less will be
the highest mark tomorrow.
If Trojan Al Lawrence is in top
shape tomorrow, he will broad jump
3 feet farther than the closest Stan
ford man. Unless he breaks his
leg, he is sure of a first place .any-
I how.
