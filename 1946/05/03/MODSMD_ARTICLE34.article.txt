# Farm Netmen Battle Troy In Southland
## 
### 
Spirits were low yesterday after
noon as Coach Elwyn Bugge's crip
pled tennis squad began their trek
southward to meet U.C.L.A. and
U.S.C. netters this weekend. The
encounter with the Bruins looms
today with the crucial Trojan fray
scheduled lor Saturday.
Due to conflicting school work,
Arnie Beisser, number one Indian,
failed to accompany the squad
south. As a result the luckless Car
dinals are mired deeper in their
underdog role, with a Stanford vic
tory classified as practically a mir
acle.
Both U.C.L.A. and U.S.C. rank
as towers of strength in Conference
circles; in fact the Trojans have :
been virtually conceded the cham
pionship according to pre - season
dope. Troy's confidence stems from
the appearance of the famous ,Fal
kenburg brothers in U.S.C. span
gles.
Because of U.S.C.'s lopsided 7-2
triumph over their cross-town ri
vals last week, the Trojan battle 1
looms as the more difficult for the j
Tribe. Bob Falkenburg leads the
Trojans from first singles seeding !
and has been nearly invincible in
early season play. Last victim of
Bob's devastating attack was Noel
Brown of the Bruins, who fell 0-6,
1-6.
"Keeping it in the family," Tom
Falkenburg holds down number
three position as well as teaming
with kid-brother Bob in first sin
gles. Bob Perez swings from the
second slot to round out the top
Trojan irio.
In their previous meeting, the
Uclans sueezed out a narrow
6-3 victory over the Incians, but
only after Stanford threw a scare
into the Bruins by sweeping the
first two singles matches. Beisser's
loss will greatly handicap Farm
chances in both singles and doubles,
as he triumphed in both divisions
in the initial Bruin battle.
The sparkling doubles combo of
Noel Brown and Bill Beale con
tinues to pace the Bruin attack as
well as handle the first two singles
positions. But the Cardinal duo of
Dave Basham and Bob Butledge
gave them quite a battle before suc
cumbing, and will be out for re
venge in today's match.
Rutledge has moved into first po
sition singles, and Basham will do
battle with the Bruin number two
netter. Other Cardinals expected to
see action are Ross Hughes, Gordon
Miller, Jack Frost, and Chuck
Schroeder.

into the Bruins by sweeping the
first two singles matches. Beisser's
loss will greatly handicap Farm
chances in both singles and doubles,
as he triumphed in both divisions
in the initial Bruin battle.
The sparkling doubles combo of
Noel Brown and Bill Beale con
tinues to pace the Bruin attack as
well as handle the first two singles
positions. But the Cardinal duo of
Dave Basham and Bob Butledge
gave them quite a battle before suc
cumbing, and will be out for re
venge in today's match.
Rutledge has moved into first po
sition singles, and Basham will do
battle with the Bruin number two
netter. Other Cardinals expected to
see action are Ross Hughes, Gordon
Miller, Jack Frost, and Chuck
Schroeder.
Spirits were low yesterday after
noon as Coach Elwyn Bugge's crip
pled tennis squad began their trek
southward to meet U.C.L.A. and
U.S.C. netters this weekend. The
encounter with the Bruins looms
today with the crucial Trojan fray
scheduled lor Saturday.
Due to conflicting school work,
Arnie Beisser, number one Indian,
failed to accompany the squad
south. As a result the luckless Car
dinals are mired deeper in their
underdog role, with a Stanford vic
tory classified as practically a mir
acle.
Both U.C.L.A. and U.S.C. rank
as towers of strength in Conference
circles; in fact the Trojans have :
been virtually conceded the cham
pionship according to pre - season
dope. Troy's confidence stems from
the appearance of the famous ,Fal
kenburg brothers in U.S.C. span
gles.
Because of U.S.C.'s lopsided 7-2
triumph over their cross-town ri
vals last week, the Trojan battle 1
looms as the more difficult for the j
Tribe. Bob Falkenburg leads the
Trojans from first singles seeding !
and has been nearly invincible in
early season play. Last victim of
Bob's devastating attack was Noel
Brown of the Bruins, who fell 0-6,
1-6.
"Keeping it in the family," Tom
Falkenburg holds down number
three position as well as teaming
with kid-brother Bob in first sin
gles. Bob Perez swings from the
second slot to round out the top
Trojan irio.
In their previous meeting, the
Uclans sueezed out a narrow
6-3 victory over the Incians, but
only after Stanford threw a scare
into the Bruins by sweeping the
first two singles matches. Beisser's

chances in both singles and doubles,
