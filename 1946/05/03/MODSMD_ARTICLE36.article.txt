# Cards Face Bruin Nine Here Today
## 
### STU MILLAR 
It's almost their last chcnce. And Harry Wolter's
baseball team is determined to make good, for it faces
University of C. at L.A. this afternoon and again to
morrow on the Sunken Diamond as the second and

♦ last round of P.C. Conference play
j gets under way.
Starting time for today's con
test is 3 p.m. Tomorrow's clash
is slated for 2:30 p.m.
The Wolf brothers, Phil and Lar-
I ry, appear as Wolters' likely hurl- 1
ing nominees. In his previous start I
against the Bruins, Phil allowed
! only lour hits but was bested by !
Joe Heinan of Ucla who doled out
i three bingles.
Bruin Coach Art Reichle will
probably give the nod to Jim Daniel j
I and Heinan in that order. Daniel,
' a dependable rookie who is just
I rounding into form, has a 5-2 record
lor the semester. Heinan looked
j great in his first few starts —notably
\ against Stanford — but has devel- !
' oped a wild streak lately which has
i cost the team important conference
! games.
Reichle is also bringing along
one of the heaviest-hitting nines
in U.C.L.A. sports annals. Five
of the first string are over the
.300 mark. The others are noted
for their excellent fielding.
The boy who is attracting most
attention from the scouts Ls Gene
j "Skip" Rowland, flashy second
! sacker. A freshman, he boasts a |
| .315 plate percentage and a good
i fielding record.
Herb Compton, only two-letter
regular on the team, has been a
source of strength on the team
; too. He is batting .415 and has j
handled the young pitchers well, i
The Bruins also possess a slug- j
j ging center fielder in George Elder, i
He bats .417, has hit five home runs, |
and has a good arm to boot.
Rounding out the outfield trio
arc Ed McKenzie, .352 hitter in
left, and Bob Seltzer, .225 man in
right. Hob liana and Jerry iYlar
tel are the two weakest stickmen
on the team, but they are excel- j
lent at their positions, short and
first base respectively. Martel, !
particularly, covers his area like
a blanket, according to late dis
! patches from the southland.
Third baseman Ken Wheler, of
University High School, Los Ange- |

les, is current ba'uing star of the
nine. His average, now .370, has
risen phenomenally in the last few
games. The Bruins' season record
now stands at 11 won and 8 lost.
The infield for the Stanford
nine will be Lloyd Merriman at
first. Bob Peters at second, Buck
Brow n son at short, and Tom
Ward at third. In the outfield,
Denny Fox, Jim YVickersham, and
George Sloat will start. Frank
McGraw. now batting way over
.400, will receive.

j great in his first few starts —notably
\ against Stanford — but has devel- !
' oped a wild streak lately which has
i cost the team important conference
! games.
Reichle is also bringing along
one of the heaviest-hitting nines
in U.C.L.A. sports annals. Five
of the first string are over the
.300 mark. The others are noted
for their excellent fielding.
The boy who is attracting most
attention from the scouts Ls Gene
j "Skip" Rowland, flashy second
! sacker. A freshman, he boasts a |
| .315 plate percentage and a good
i fielding record.
Herb Compton, only two-letter
regular on the team, has been a
source of strength on the team
; too. He is batting .415 and has j
handled the young pitchers well, i
The Bruins also possess a slug- j
j ging center fielder in George Elder, i
He bats .417, has hit five home runs, |
and has a good arm to boot.
Rounding out the outfield trio
arc Ed McKenzie, .352 hitter in
left, and Bob Seltzer, .225 man in
right. Hob liana and Jerry iYlar
tel are the two weakest stickmen
on the team, but they are excel- j
lent at their positions, short and
first base respectively. Martel, !
particularly, covers his area like
a blanket, according to late dis
! patches from the southland.
Third baseman Ken Wheler, of
University High School, Los Ange- |

les, is current ba'uing star of the
nine. His average, now .370, has
risen phenomenally in the last few
games. The Bruins' season record
now stands at 11 won and 8 lost.
The infield for the Stanford
nine will be Lloyd Merriman at
first. Bob Peters at second, Buck
Brow n son at short, and Tom
Ward at third. In the outfield,
Denny Fox, Jim YVickersham, and
George Sloat will start. Frank
McGraw. now batting way over
.400, will receive.
It's almost their last chcnce. And Harry Wolter's
baseball team is determined to make good, for it faces
University of C. at L.A. this afternoon and again to
morrow on the Sunken Diamond as the second and

♦ last round of P.C. Conference play
j gets under way.
Starting time for today's con
test is 3 p.m. Tomorrow's clash
is slated for 2:30 p.m.
The Wolf brothers, Phil and Lar-
I ry, appear as Wolters' likely hurl- 1
ing nominees. In his previous start I
against the Bruins, Phil allowed
! only lour hits but was bested by !
Joe Heinan of Ucla who doled out
i three bingles.
Bruin Coach Art Reichle will
probably give the nod to Jim Daniel j
I and Heinan in that order. Daniel,
' a dependable rookie who is just
I rounding into form, has a 5-2 record
lor the semester. Heinan looked
j great in his first few starts —notably
\ against Stanford — but has devel- !
' oped a wild streak lately which has
