# Chi Psi's Win In Softball
## 
### 
Intramural Softball continued at
a swift pace yesterday afternoon.
Now that the teams which weren't
interested in the game have left the
two leagues, the remaining nines
are fiercely battling for the coveted
winner's laurels.
In League I, the first-place Chi
Psi's keep up their undefeated rec
ord by outhitting Jefferson Hall, 9
to 4. The Chi Psi's are the team to
watch out for, especially in their
coming battle with the powerful
Encina Cellar aggregation. Phi Psi,
the up-and-down team of League I,
soundly trounced Sigma Nu. 11 to 1.
In League 11, unbeaten Harrison
defeated Buchanan Hall, 19 to 5.
This keeps Harrison's record un
tarnished and definitely makes
them the favorite in the league. The
Legal Eagles were not so kind as
Buchanan and they broke Beta
Theta's string of victories by nip
ping them, 5 to 4. Zeta Psi out
hit A.T.0., 10 to 3. This gives the
Zetas their first victory in four
starts.
