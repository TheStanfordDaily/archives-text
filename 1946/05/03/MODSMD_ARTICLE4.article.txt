# Women to Vote Monday On Room Drawing System
## 
### 
Women students will l»c asked
to vote again Monday in house
meetings as to whether they want
, a class preference system or a ra
| tio system in room drawing, ac
| cording to yesterday's decision of
Housing Committee. Last Mem
day's vote was not phoned in.
Because it was not realized until
I recently that the two systems are
incompatible, the housing polls con
tained both questions and the ma
jority of women answered yes to
j both of Lhem.
! YEAR VOTE COUNTS
The committee and the Adminis
tration have no record of what the
students want. Monday's vote will
be taken into consideration before
j any plan is adopted.
If a ratio system is used, the Ad
ministration has decided to use the
plan proportioning the vacancies in
. cach living group to the proportion
I of women in each class drawing.
DEMONSTRATION CASE
What is the difference between a
class preference and a ratio sys
tem? How does cach of them affcct

t you, remembering that you draw
I according to your academic class at
| the end of this quarter?
j Let's take the hypothetical case of
| Sophomore Suzy and Senior Sally
j who both want to move into House
j X, which has 10 vacancies.
SOPHS ARE OUT
Under the class preference sys
j tern. Senior Sally will have a very
j good chance of getting in because
j all the seniors will be placed be
| fore any other class. But by the
time all the seniors and then all the
j juniors are placed and Sophomore
Suzy's number comes up, the
chances that there will still be va
cancies left in House X are slight.
; If, however, the two girls are
! drawing under a ratio system, they
j will have a more equal chance of
| getting into House X because a cer
: tain number of places will be re
j served for girls in each class. How
! ever, Senior Sally will have no bet
i ter chance of getting in than Soph
' omore Suzy, even though she is in
{ a higher class. All classes are on
I the same level.
I ON THE MOVE
Advicates of class preference be
lieve it is a fairer system because
it gives the best chance of moving
to a preferred place to girls who
have less time left at Stanford.
They also believe it is a less rigid
system and one much easier to ad
minister. Students who continually
draw a high number may have
more chance of moving where they
! wish under a class preference sys
tem.
FOR TRADITION AND SPIRIT
A ratio system provides for a
I balance of classes in all living
j groups, provides for carry-over and
continuity in all living groups from
quarter to quarter, and provides a
more equal chance for girls in cv
! cry class to mive.
In the original housing plan,
J drawn up last spring by a repre
sentative group of Stanford women
j and approved by the Board of Trus
| toes, it was decided that a ratio
' was desirable "because of the mu
| tual benefit of contact among dif—
| fercnt classes. Also if a house is
i run co-operatively, and for reasons
of group tradition and spirit, con
tinuity is felt to be a definite need."
