###

title of the Spring Show, "How Far Can a .Good Girl Go," will
be thoroughly discussed and will provide intellectual stimula-

♦■{ion for Stanford's intelligentsia.
THE PLOT
She'd been happy. Then she dis
covered the truth. Her cvah-lovin'
husband, Sir Archibald, was in real
j ity true to only one woman and it
wasn't she. In desperation she left
i home and fell into the Path of In
! iquity.
Her son died, and she did, too —of
J consumption.

Jean Black singing "One Little Sin
Leads to Another," George Eckstein
and Bill Edlund, and Ramona Reid
dancing to "A Bird in a Gilded
Cage"; Mary Vaughan singing; a
tumbling act with Don Hastettlcr,
j Joe Easterbrook, and Murray Stir
! ton; and Jeanne Housscls reading
"Droons."
Costumes, says Miss Swan, will be
J the kind that "made the nineties
! naughty." And there will be one
J special surprise.
The stage will be changed into a
theatre within a theatre, with the
exterior scene a bleak, barren
i winter landscape, and three in
terior sets: a poverty stricken at-
I tic and two bedroom scenes. There
will be an old-fashioned act cur
tain. decorated with a "beautiful
nude" and her cupid assistants
advertising well know remedies of
the day.
