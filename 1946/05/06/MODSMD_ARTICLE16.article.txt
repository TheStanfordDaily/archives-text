ALCATRAZ ISLAND FEDERAL PRISON, San Francisco Bay, May 5
(UP). —Convicts in Alcatraz Federal Prison tonight settled down to suffer
out the "hangover" stage of one of Ihe most savage riots in the nation's
penal history—an abortive escape attempt which narrowly missed becom
ing a general break for freedom from the "rock."
Warden James A. Johnston, who called a press conference to disclose

►all details of the three-day battle
j which took the lives of two guards
and three convicts and resulted in
the wounding of 14 guards, said the
bold break last Thursday was plan
ned as a major escape from the
most hated prison in the convict
world.
LOCK DOOMS PLOT
Johnson said the convicts' inabil
j ity to solve an intricate electrical
| lock on a steel door leading to the
"solitary" cells housing the prison's
J most desperate men doomed the
| plot io failure.
j Joseph Paul Crctzer, Los Angeles
| bank robber, made desperate ef
| forts to release Franklin and a doz
en other men in D block immedi
ately after Bernard Paul Coy, an
other ringleader, started the break
at 2:30 p.m. Thursday by overpow
ering Guard Dean Burch of D block.
FEW WEAPONS.
Warden Johnson said the inves
tigation after the riot was quelled
I on Saturday revealed the startling
information that despite the bitter
fight waged by the convicts for
three clays, their only weapons were
| a rifle, a .45-caliber Colt automatic
J pistol, a knife, and a few gas gre
! nades. They had 50 rounds of am-
I.munition for the rifle and 21 rounds
j for the pistol.
j "We believe that heroism of the
j guards, especially Guard William E.

i valuable keys, foiled Crctzer, Coy,
I and their pals in a major escape cf

also helped."
