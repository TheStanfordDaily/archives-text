WASHINGTON, May 5 (UP).â€”|
Chairman W. Willard Wirtz of the j
Wage Stabilization Board and other j
top economic officials fear that pay
scales may jump 25 to 50 per ccnt '
in a matter of weeks if Congress j
fails to enact a tight OPA extension I
law, it was revealed tonight.
Wirtz, who made his views i
known to the National Industrial
Conference Board, feels that the
restrictive OPA measure passed
by the House would in effect kill
wage stabilization and cause his
* board to collapse.
His opinion parallels the views of
Price Administrator Paul Porter
and Chester Bowles, Director of I
Economic Stabilization. The latter
two asserted the measure would
wreck OPA and have asked the
Senate to salvage it.
Other administration leaders have i
been warned that if OPA is scuttled j
there will be new demands for wage !
rises and consequent strikes equal- i
ing those of last winter.
