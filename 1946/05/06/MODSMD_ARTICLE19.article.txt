# Vet Subsidy Issue Nearing Solution
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. May 5 (UP).â€”
House and Somite conferees hoped
tonight that the deadlock over the
conl.rovcr.sial subsidy provision in
the veterans housing bill would l:e
broken this week.
The subsidy issue now blocking
final action on a compromise meas
ure is stalled by refusal of House
conferees to accept an offer by Sen
ate conferees to cut the amount al
lowed for building material sub
sidies from $600,000,000, as voted by
the Senate, to $400,000,000.
The offer will be put to a House
vote this week, probably Thursday.
If it is turned down, subsidies in
tended to spurt construction of
scarce materials probably will be
junked. President Truman has
called them the "heart of the emerg
ency program to built 2,700,000
homes for veterans.
Conferees will go back to work
I after the House, which ripped the
I subsidy provision out entirely in
! passing its original housing bill, dc-
I cidcs whether to accept the smaller
I figure.
