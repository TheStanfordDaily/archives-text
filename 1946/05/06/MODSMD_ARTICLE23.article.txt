## 
### 
NEW YORK, Ma;, 5 (UP).—An
Iranian government statement
that all Russian troops had left
Iran was expected tonight within
24 hours, thus clearing the way
for the United States Security
Council to drop the question at a
meeting called for p.m. Wednes
day.
There whs no indication whether
Russia would send a similar report
or would flout the council in keep
ing with its insistence that there has
been no dispute with Iran since the
signing of an agreement, calling for
complete withdrawal of Red Army
troops.
Tlie call for a council meeting
Wednesday two days after the Mon
day deadline for the evacuation of
the last Russian troops from Iran—
went out late today from the UN
secretariat.
The only item on the program
will be the Iranian question. The
Security Council had asked both
Iran and Russia to report Monday
whether all the troops had left.
