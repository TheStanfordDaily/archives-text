# Hope in Coal Strike
## Exert Heavy Pressure As Shutdown Continues 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 5 (UP).â€”Government officials found
,;igns of hope tonight for a break this week in the deadlock
blocking settlement of the paralyzing national coal strike.
Without divulging the basis of their hopes, they made it clear
that they thought the outlook appeared better than it did a week

ago before mine operators and John
L. Lewis, United Mine Workers
chief, resumed bargaining.
FIVE-WEEK SHUTDOWN
One evident factor was that both
sides were being subjected to ex
tremely heavy pressure to end the
five-week shutdown, which the
White House said already had be
come a national disaster.
But it appeared unlikely the sit
uation would crystallize until af
ter Tuesday meeting of the union's
200-inan policy committee. Al
though Lewis ostensibly callcd the
committee for a report of the ne
gotiations, such calls in the past
have foreshadowed major union
decisions.
Some management sources expect
ed the industrial crisis stemming
from the strike to force more direct
government intervention, such as a
formal compromise proposal.
HANDS-OFF POLICY
The labor department thus far has
limited its activity to keeping the
parties at the bargaining table, while
maintaining a hands-off policy to
ward the negotiations. The White
House last night described the mag
nitude of the industrial crisis in a
detailed report obviously intended to
focus public attention on the strike
and to exert pressure for settle
ment.
It was understood that some per
sons had urged on President Tru
man the view that Lewis had re
fused to bargain collectively in the
wage conference.
The strike will cut still deeper
into industrial production this
week. In the reported terming the
strike a national disaster, the
White House cited civilian produc
tion estimates that the shutdown
already had cost nearly 1,500,000
tons of steel. CPA estimated that
another 655,000 tons would he lost
this week.
Embargoes on non-essential freight,
will be put into effect by the na
tion's coal-burning railroads next
Friday. A 50 per cent cut in pas
senger service will be enforced five
days later.
According to the White House re
ports, the strike has forced shut
downs in factories all over the coun
try, shutting off the flow of goods
to consumers who have not yet felt
the full impact.
