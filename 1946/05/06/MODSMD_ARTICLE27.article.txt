### 
PARIS. Monday, May C (UP). â€”
The French people, swarming <o
the polls in record numbers, today
rejected (he Leftist - sponsored
constitution, thus inflicting a sen
sational defeat 011 the Commu
nists and Socialists.
The result, which was clear
from nearly complete returns,
meant that the electorate must
start over again and name a new
assembly to write the constitution
to take the place of the one which
perished with the rise of the
Vichy government in 15)40.
The constitution which returns
indicated was defeated by ap
proximately 1,600,000 votes out of
an incomplete total of nearly 2-'(.-
000,000 would have provided a
powerful single-chamber parlia
ment, eliminating the Senate and
the western-democratic system of
"checks and balances." It would
have made the president a figure
head. The left wing parties, on
(he basis of (he victory they had
confidently expected and the righ(
wing had all but conceded, would
have been in full power.
