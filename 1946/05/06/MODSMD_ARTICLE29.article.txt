# THE 						STANFORD STORY

### BILL HORNBY 
ON THE HORSES OF SENATOR STANFORD
(Continued from Friday's Stanford Story)
In the 1880's the clash between the progressive
"Palo Alto" system of colt-training and the Ken
tucky "wait and win" methods which preferred
mature horses came to the test on the nation's
t racks.
And a famous Palo Alto quartet- llinda Rose,
Mun/anita, Chimes, and Palo Alto—soon ruled the
tough eastern circuit. It took a Stanford colt to beat
a Stanford colt.
In*lSBS Sunol, the greatest of the Electioneer off
< t ! 'if, trotted a'mife in two minutes twenty and
on In 11 seconds, a week later in 2:18. This estab
lish 'I a new record for two-year-olds, put Sunol
in line for the mantle of the revered Maud S. K*
b; nd-wagon rush to adopt Stanford training meth
ods was on.
Tite {{real baronial estate, its white-fenced pad
dorks. its massive frame barns, the sixty-acre
trotting park and tracks were all sprinkled and
(Mmbed by a swarm of Chinese groundmen who
kept the Palo Alto Farm as well groomed as any
oJ its horse sons. There had never been a plant
like it anywhere in the world thought Charley
Marvin when he came out from Kentucky to
oversee the operation.
The old Governor kept his eagle eye on every de
tail. Down from the Stanford house (the present
Convalescent Home) he would drive in the early
unlight, his red-wheeled sulky kicking up the
d.'.s: in Governor's Lane.
At, the "kindergarten" circle with its canopied
observer's stand, he would watch the newest crop
of colts bobble obediently around the curried track,
training for the day when they would bring more
vindications of Stanford's imagination. Onto the
other tracks the Governor would drive, and late at
night tie and the trainers —Marvin, Frank and
George Covey, "Old Yank" Smith, et al., would sit
at the "big house" mapping the strategy behind
their dreams.
Perhaps the greatest of the colts they produced
was Sunol, born in 1886. Charley Williams, a
•liiall-time butter and egg man in Illinois and
Lcland Stanford, a big-time railroad and wine
man from California lined up as owners on the
opposite sides of the biggest speed fight yet seen
in harness racing.

Axtell was the Williams colt that ran a 2:23 mile
in the hot Lexington summer of Sunol took
five seconds oft' that in October in a 2:18 run in San
Francisco. The next summer Axtell shaved the
record to 2:15 1-2, 2:14, and 2:12. In November
Sunol turned in a 2:10 1 -2.
In 1891, (he top year for the Palo Alto stock
farm, Sunol ran a 2:081-4 mile and Palo Alto
trotted his famous stallion record race of
2:08.'1-4. The Stanford Farm held simultaneously
the world's trotting records for two, three, four,
and five-year-olds, the all-ages' class, and stal
lions.
When Sunol finally beat Maud S's longtime record
in '91, the letter's owner paid Stanford $41,000 for
this prize child of Electioneer. At other sales, the
Governor refused $500,000 for Electioneer, and sold
2:07 3-4 Arion for $150,000. The system paid in more
than blue ribbons!
Electioneer, the great sire of the Palo Alto colts,
died in 1890. In 18P1 after the Farm's banner year
Chief Trainer Marvin resigned. On June 20, 1893,
the Governor made his usual rounds of his farm
and went home to die in the late evening. At his
funeral tht offering of his employees was a gigantic
floral horse.
Jane Stanford, preoccupied with the problems of
the growing University, soon realized that she
could not maintain the stock farm. In 1903 the great
horse laboratory came to official end.
But the blood of Electioneer was forever a part
of American horse champions. In 1937 the great
Greyhound ran an unbelievable 1:56. This new
est king was directly descended from Electioneer
through Chimes and the Abbott.
Somewhere near the Red Barn are the lost graves
of Palo Alto and his mates. This horse graveyard
was a landmark for early generations of students.
Now like the story of the great stock Farm itself
the graveyard lies under the tangled maze covering
The Stanford Story.
Today a prospective Stanford Riding Club hopes
to bring the Big Red Barn and the memories
around it back into the focus of a Farm where the
horse that was once ruler is now an exception.

•liiall-time butter and egg man in Illinois and
Lcland Stanford, a big-time railroad and wine
man from California lined up as owners on the
opposite sides of the biggest speed fight yet seen
in harness racing.

Axtell was the Williams colt that ran a 2:23 mile
in the hot Lexington summer of Sunol took
five seconds oft' that in October in a 2:18 run in San
Francisco. The next summer Axtell shaved the
record to 2:15 1-2, 2:14, and 2:12. In November
Sunol turned in a 2:10 1 -2.
In 1891, (he top year for the Palo Alto stock
farm, Sunol ran a 2:081-4 mile and Palo Alto
trotted his famous stallion record race of
2:08.'1-4. The Stanford Farm held simultaneously
the world's trotting records for two, three, four,
and five-year-olds, the all-ages' class, and stal
lions.
When Sunol finally beat Maud S's longtime record
in '91, the letter's owner paid Stanford $41,000 for
this prize child of Electioneer. At other sales, the
Governor refused $500,000 for Electioneer, and sold
2:07 3-4 Arion for $150,000. The system paid in more
than blue ribbons!
Electioneer, the great sire of the Palo Alto colts,
died in 1890. In 18P1 after the Farm's banner year
Chief Trainer Marvin resigned. On June 20, 1893,
the Governor made his usual rounds of his farm
and went home to die in the late evening. At his
funeral tht offering of his employees was a gigantic
floral horse.
Jane Stanford, preoccupied with the problems of
the growing University, soon realized that she
could not maintain the stock farm. In 1903 the great
horse laboratory came to official end.
But the blood of Electioneer was forever a part
of American horse champions. In 1937 the great
Greyhound ran an unbelievable 1:56. This new
est king was directly descended from Electioneer
through Chimes and the Abbott.
Somewhere near the Red Barn are the lost graves
of Palo Alto and his mates. This horse graveyard
was a landmark for early generations of students.
Now like the story of the great stock Farm itself
the graveyard lies under the tangled maze covering
The Stanford Story.

to bring the Big Red Barn and the memories
around it back into the focus of a Farm where the
horse that was once ruler is now an exception.

ON THE HORSES OF SENATOR STANFORD
(Continued from Friday's Stanford Story)
In the 1880's the clash between the progressive
"Palo Alto" system of colt-training and the Ken
tucky "wait and win" methods which preferred
mature horses came to the test on the nation's
t racks.
And a famous Palo Alto quartet- llinda Rose,
Mun/anita, Chimes, and Palo Alto—soon ruled the
tough eastern circuit. It took a Stanford colt to beat
a Stanford colt.
In*lSBS Sunol, the greatest of the Electioneer off
< t ! 'if, trotted a'mife in two minutes twenty and
on In 11 seconds, a week later in 2:18. This estab
lish 'I a new record for two-year-olds, put Sunol
in line for the mantle of the revered Maud S. K*
b; nd-wagon rush to adopt Stanford training meth
ods was on.
Tite {{real baronial estate, its white-fenced pad
dorks. its massive frame barns, the sixty-acre
trotting park and tracks were all sprinkled and
(Mmbed by a swarm of Chinese groundmen who
kept the Palo Alto Farm as well groomed as any
oJ its horse sons. There had never been a plant
like it anywhere in the world thought Charley
Marvin when he came out from Kentucky to
oversee the operation.
The old Governor kept his eagle eye on every de
tail. Down from the Stanford house (the present
Convalescent Home) he would drive in the early
unlight, his red-wheeled sulky kicking up the
d.'.s: in Governor's Lane.
At, the "kindergarten" circle with its canopied
observer's stand, he would watch the newest crop
of colts bobble obediently around the curried track,
training for the day when they would bring more
vindications of Stanford's imagination. Onto the
other tracks the Governor would drive, and late at
night tie and the trainers —Marvin, Frank and
George Covey, "Old Yank" Smith, et al., would sit
at the "big house" mapping the strategy behind
their dreams.
Perhaps the greatest of the colts they produced
was Sunol, born in 1886. Charley Williams, a
•liiall-time butter and egg man in Illinois and
Lcland Stanford, a big-time railroad and wine
man from California lined up as owners on the
opposite sides of the biggest speed fight yet seen
in harness racing.

Axtell was the Williams colt that ran a 2:23 mile
in the hot Lexington summer of Sunol took
five seconds oft' that in October in a 2:18 run in San
Francisco. The next summer Axtell shaved the
record to 2:15 1-2, 2:14, and 2:12. In November
Sunol turned in a 2:10 1 -2.
In 1891, (he top year for the Palo Alto stock
farm, Sunol ran a 2:081-4 mile and Palo Alto
trotted his famous stallion record race of
2:08.'1-4. The Stanford Farm held simultaneously
the world's trotting records for two, three, four,
and five-year-olds, the all-ages' class, and stal
lions.
When Sunol finally beat Maud S's longtime record
in '91, the letter's owner paid Stanford $41,000 for
this prize child of Electioneer. At other sales, the
Governor refused $500,000 for Electioneer, and sold
2:07 3-4 Arion for $150,000. The system paid in more
than blue ribbons!
Electioneer, the great sire of the Palo Alto colts,
died in 1890. In 18P1 after the Farm's banner year
Chief Trainer Marvin resigned. On June 20, 1893,
the Governor made his usual rounds of his farm
and went home to die in the late evening. At his
funeral tht offering of his employees was a gigantic
floral horse.
Jane Stanford, preoccupied with the problems of
the growing University, soon realized that she
could not maintain the stock farm. In 1903 the great
horse laboratory came to official end.
But the blood of Electioneer was forever a part
of American horse champions. In 1937 the great
Greyhound ran an unbelievable 1:56. This new
