One of our representatives in "student govern
ment" buttonholed us the other day and insisted
thnt we stop "attacking them."
"After all," we were told, "what do you want us
to <!o? All we can do is recommend or suggest. We
ean't do anything else."
We can think of one thing that you can do. And
Ihat is either get a student government that can do
.something or stop pretending to be something you
ain't.
Having been brought up in New England—
where a Mr. Webster achieved some fame with
word games known as definitions—we had
thought of education as "developing and culti
vating mentally or moraily . . . exercise or prac
tice to gain skill."
Stanford takes rare of the "moral" development.
But our "mentality" such as it is—continues to
suffer from acute undernourishment along political
lines.
We do need a student government at Stanford.
An issue of such vital interest to students—as hous
ing—was ignored by the student government. (Don't
tell us of this committee or that committee that was

appointed. End results are the pay-off. And as far
as the end results go—we can continue to say—
housing was ignored by student government.
Student government as it is now set up can run
some very nice dances.
But often important issues such as the one men
tioned arise, and we—as students—have no or
ganized representation that can work for us.
Getting things done and dealing with actual prob
lems are only half of the reason for our needing a
student government. To continue to let everything
be decided and done by the "higher-ups," to con
tinue to have little or no voice in matters that
directly affect you—is just begging for trouble.
If the interest and desire to have a say in the
government is not cultivated at this stage of the
game chances are that it will continue to lie dor
mant, with results that are all too apparent in the
world today.
To have us refer to our "student government" as
a Student Government, is the desire of a good many
of our administrators.
The difficulty is that so many of our students have
fallen for the trick.
