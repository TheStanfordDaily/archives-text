# BULL SESSION
## 
### H.D. THOREAU 
Last Thursday over the Baldwin Hills golf course,
the University <!' Southern California scored a 4(5-2
win over a notoriously weak U.C.L.A. golf team. It
marked the second time that the Trojans had wal
loped the Bruins this year.
All this transpired the day before the Stanford-
U SC. match was to be held. This match, you will
recall, was canceled a week ago because the Trojans
were "not ready" to meet us.
Vet that same week they produce a team that
â€¢ hoots rounds of 71, 7G, 78, 78, 74, 82, 77, and 79 in
eight single matches. Admittedly these rounds
wouldn't be low enough to take Eddie Twiggs classy
toe squad, but it does show that they have an ade
quate team.
S.C. has no qualms whatsoever about lacing the
hapless Bruins, but when it came to facing McCann,

Lamhie, Rosberg, Schuler, Cardinal, Jones, and
Dotzour, they were "not>ready."

Bill Steif, Cellar cigar store counterman who was
on duty last week when the Axe was pilfered, had
another interesting incident last night.
It was 10:25. Everything was quiet. He was get
ting ready to close up. Six large college-age men
came in and after milling around for several min
utes buying candy and comic magazines, one of
them who was wearing a Stanford jacket stepped
up to the counter and asked to buy a five-gallon
can of blue and gold paint.
Steif explained to the fellow that they did not
sell paint.
