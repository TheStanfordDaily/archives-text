# FARM GRAD IN YUGOSLAVIA

### 

Restoring German-destroyed water supplies in Yugoslavia is the
problem facing MAJOR WILLIAM T. INGRAM, Stanford graduate
and newly appointed Chief Sanitary Engineer for the UNRRA mission
in Yugoslavia.
Before retreating from that country, the Germans filled water wells
and destroyed pumping systems in towns that for centuries had had
a pure water supply. Major Ingram reports that sanitary engineering
will be of the greatest importance during the next few months because
of a consequent prevalence of epidemic diseases, particularly malaria
and typhus.
Besides restoring water systems, he must see to it that a constant
watch is kept in Yugoslav ports to exterminate disease-bearing rats
whiÂ»h come from Eastern ports.
Major Ingram has been with UNRRA since June, 1944. Before his
present assignment to Yugoslavia he worked for several months on a
similar iob at a large refugee camp iu Egypt.
