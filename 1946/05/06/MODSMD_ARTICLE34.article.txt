# ON THE DISCS
## 
### LARRY FRANKLEY GEORGE ECKSTEIN 
Since losing Artie Shaw to the
Musicraft label, RCA Victor has
tried to rid itself of the "Tempera
mental Gentleman's" backlog by is
suing two 12-inch discs that Shaw
made before entering the Navy.
This was the band that had such
stellar sidemen as Billy Butterlield.
the late Jack Jenny, Nick Faloof,
and Johnny Guarnieri, plus-an as
sortment of violins, 'cellos, violas,
and oboes.
SOLOISTS SUPPRESSED
The first platter v/e shall deal with
is "Summertime" and"The Maid
with the Flaccid Air." The belter
of the worst is the Gershwin tune
with the always beautiful Shaw
clarinet and Les Roblnsori's alto
featured. The symphonic arrange
ment does not seem to work out so
well, especially to those who know
that men like Jenny and Guarnieri
were wasting their talent doing
things like Ibis.
Of course, the Butterlield trum
pet stands out even in an over
done arrangement like this. Flac
cid Air" is an Kddi Sauter scor
ing, and after all the wonderful
swinging scores that this man has
done for Goodman and Norvo, it
is a disappointment. It is com
mercial; it doesn't get anywhere;
and it doesn't provide anything
for the soloists to work on.
The second record is "Suite No. 8"
and "Evensong," and both are the
production type numbers as the first
two. Even when "No. 8" begins to
swing somewhere along the middle,
it is poorly done wilh the arrang
ing way out of date. Jerry Jerome,
the man who usually plays so much
tenor, is far too wild on his solo,
and it takes Billy Butterfield to lift
the whole thing out of the failure
class. As for "Evensong," it is an
"Even Nothing."
HAMP SINGS ANI) SWINGS
"Hamp's Sally Blues" and

"Chord-A-Re-Bop" arc the names
of Lionel Hampton's latst outpour
ings on wax. Both sides are done
with a quartet out of the big band.
"Salty" has a Hamp vocal that
swings nicely, but it is the type that
he does all too often. It is of the
typical blues pattern, but il is very
pleasant.
The other side, "Chord-A-Re-
Bop," follows in the footsteps of
"Hamp's Bcngie," "Beulah's Boo
gie," and "Hey-Ba-Ba-Re-Bob."
Hampton's faturcd solos only go
to prove that Red Norvo is hy
far (he best vil»e artist in the
country, liis technical ability is
great, but his tone leaves a lot
(o be desired. Spotlighted on
both sides is William Maekel,
whose guitar shows plenty of pol
ish and ideas. Also featured is
•Mill Buckner with his locked
hands piano style that is always
great.
J.D.'S JUMP—DOESN'T
Jimmy Dorsey has finally de
cided to make some use of the
wonderful sidemen that he has in
his band, and if J.D. had only
stayed home from the recording
session, very thing would have b-.-en
"A Number One Ipsy Pipsy Yankee
Doodle."
On (lie first side, "Little Dor
sey" has a quartet doing "J.D.'s
Jump," and if J.D. jumps, we'll
eat his alto! Herb Ellis, the gui
tarist everyone has been raving
about, lives up to expectations
with Karl KifTe, the IK-year-old
drummer from Beverly Hills, giv
ing him fine backing throughout.
Then Jimmy comes in for a few
choruses—well, the best we ran
say is that he is terrible.
For the reverse side, the above
review could be repeated word for
word by just changing the nam? of
the tune. It is "Perdido," the El
lington composition, and once again
begins in a wondrful groove with
Ellis, KifTe, and Lewis Carter, the
pianist, leading off — then Comes
Dorsey and "Perdido" is pordido.

J.D.'S JUMP—DOESN'T
Jimmy Dorsey has finally de
cided to make some use of the
wonderful sidemen that he has in
his band, and if J.D. had only
stayed home from the recording
session, very thing would have b-.-en
"A Number One Ipsy Pipsy Yankee
Doodle."
On (lie first side, "Little Dor
sey" has a quartet doing "J.D.'s
Jump," and if J.D. jumps, we'll
eat his alto! Herb Ellis, the gui
tarist everyone has been raving
about, lives up to expectations
with Karl KifTe, the IK-year-old
drummer from Beverly Hills, giv
ing him fine backing throughout.
Then Jimmy comes in for a few
choruses—well, the best we ran
say is that he is terrible.
For the reverse side, the above
review could be repeated word for
word by just changing the nam? of
the tune. It is "Perdido," the El
lington composition, and once again
begins in a wondrful groove with
Ellis, KifTe, and Lewis Carter, the
pianist, leading off — then Comes
Dorsey and "Perdido" is pordido.
Since losing Artie Shaw to the
Musicraft label, RCA Victor has
tried to rid itself of the "Tempera
mental Gentleman's" backlog by is
suing two 12-inch discs that Shaw
made before entering the Navy.
This was the band that had such
stellar sidemen as Billy Butterlield.
the late Jack Jenny, Nick Faloof,
and Johnny Guarnieri, plus-an as
sortment of violins, 'cellos, violas,
and oboes.
SOLOISTS SUPPRESSED
The first platter v/e shall deal with
is "Summertime" and"The Maid
with the Flaccid Air." The belter
of the worst is the Gershwin tune
with the always beautiful Shaw
clarinet and Les Roblnsori's alto
featured. The symphonic arrange
ment does not seem to work out so
well, especially to those who know
that men like Jenny and Guarnieri
were wasting their talent doing
things like Ibis.
Of course, the Butterlield trum
pet stands out even in an over
done arrangement like this. Flac
cid Air" is an Kddi Sauter scor
ing, and after all the wonderful
swinging scores that this man has
done for Goodman and Norvo, it
is a disappointment. It is com
mercial; it doesn't get anywhere;
and it doesn't provide anything
for the soloists to work on.
The second record is "Suite No. 8"
and "Evensong," and both are the
production type numbers as the first
two. Even when "No. 8" begins to
swing somewhere along the middle,
it is poorly done wilh the arrang
ing way out of date. Jerry Jerome,
the man who usually plays so much
tenor, is far too wild on his solo,
and it takes Billy Butterfield to lift
the whole thing out of the failure
class. As for "Evensong," it is an
"Even Nothing."
