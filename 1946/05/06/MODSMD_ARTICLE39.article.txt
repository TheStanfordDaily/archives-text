I dents reside in the "Ivory Tower"
is Miss Elinor Kahn, Stanford '35.

I Warehousemen's Union, and has
| been active in union affairs since her
graduation.
I'OLY SCI PAYS on
Miss Kahn majored in political
j science and history, and was orig
inally planning to work for a law
degree. She has explained that a
chance to visit the Carmel home of
Lincoln StefTens, famed political
"muckraker," was the big influence
that changed her thinking from law
to her present interests.
Miss Kahn was active in the
"American Students' Union," a now
defunct organization, while an un
dergraduate. The ASU was active,
at the time, in promoting better liv
ing conditions and more equality for
students.
GOES OVEII TO ENEMY
Alter leaving the Farm, Miss Kahn
; turned traitor and took her master's

degree at Cal in 1936, and then did
further work back here. She has
done volunteer work for the agri
cultural workers of California, and
later held a position in the then Pa
cific Coast Labor Bureau.
In 1940 she accepted a position
with the American Communications
Association and stayed in Washing
ton till 1943, when she took her
present position with the ILWU.
Claiming "I'm really a longshore
man at heart," Miss Kahn, a plump,
fast talking, hard-smoking, quick
thinking sort of a gal, has been not
ed as one of the ablest figures in
San Francisco Labor circles today.â€”
