# GREENERY IN SAN FRANCISCO

### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 5 (UP).
—Grass —or trees and shrubs—may
grow in San Francisco's busy
streets yet.
Tomorrow the Board of Super
visors will vote on an ordinance au
thorizing the park department to
plant trees and shrubs along the
streets.
Glenn Hall, former member of
the city planning commission and
author of the proposal, said he felt
.such a program "would relieve the
monotonous appearance of so much
concrete, stucco, and asphalt in our
streets."
