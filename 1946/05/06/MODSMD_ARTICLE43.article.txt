# Stanford Nine Splits Series With Bruins
## 
### STU MILLAR 
Booming into the win column
through the medium of clean, well
played baseball, Stanford's horsehid
ers trounced the visiting U.C.L.A.
Bruins in the first game of a week
end pair by a score of 3 to 2 only to
drop the secon, 9 to (5.
The two contests furnished the
same contrast that a previous se
ries with the Bruins provided.
Down south, the Uclans won the
first clash after a superb hurling
battle and then came back to take
the second on batting power.
But it wasn't exactly the same
story, for the locals just didn't slug
in the clutch or run the bases cor
rectly to warrant their winning the
second game.
However Dick Flatland and Larry
Prato furnished enough impetus to
insure a Conference victory when,
on Friday, they respectively pitched
and batted Stanford to a ninth-in
ning victory. <►
Showing the mound prowess for
the first time since his freshman
year that caused him to be rated
a "great prospect," Dick pitched
live-hit ball. He would have had
a shutout but for a ninth-inning
rally by the Bruins that knotted
the score at 2 to 2. But Stanford
was not to be denied and came
back in the ninth to push over the
winning run.
Prato hit a single and two dou
bles, more total bases than all his
teammates could muster, and was
instrumental in the seventh and
eighth inning rallies. This game
marked his first starting-appearance
in a month.
The game was marked by sev
eral sparkling plays, notably in the
seventh when a sure Bruin tally
was staved oil". With Martcl on
second, McKenzie singled to cen
ter for one of the few solid Bruin
hits of the day. But Frank Merri
man made a perfect throw to the
plate to nab Martcl who had been
stopped in front of the plate by a
superb block by Dick Ahlquist.
The next day it was a different
story. Although it was a scoreless
tilt until the third inning only one
hit, by Stanford's Jim Wickersham,
had been recorded—the skies fell in
the iourth. Four Bruin baseballers
crossed the plate to give the visit
firs a lead they never relinquished.
The Stanfords came back in their
half to count twice, but the Bruins

added three more in the fifth to set
tle the issue. In retrospect, the ball
| game was really far from lost. Stan
lord repeatedly put men on the
sacks, but the lack of clutch hitting
cooled many potential scoring ral
lies. Many potential scorers were
also wiped out by their own poor
baserunning and poor judgment on
the part of baseline coaches.
Il was too had that this was the
last game of the season between
the two teams, for Stanford has a
score to settle with U.C.L.A. in
general and Skippy Rowland, the
smooth-checked Bruin second
sacker in particular. Rowland dis
i played the poorest sportsmanship
| seen on the Sunken Diamond in
many years when, in the third in
ning of Saturday's game, Jim
Wickersham was slightly but
painfully injured in a close home
plate play. Rowland ran toward
the plate yelling "Carry him oil
in a stretcher and put in someone
else," as Wickersham slowly not
up.
