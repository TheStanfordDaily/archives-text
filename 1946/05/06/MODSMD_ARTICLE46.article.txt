Jack Indians look
second place Saturday to the na
tion's best track team, which may
or may not make Stanford's cinder
men second best in the country.
The score was 108-2.'} in favor
of the University of Southern
California. The fact that the meet
was held on the Trojafis' home
ground, the Los Angeles Coli
seum. before I!,(100 partisan fans
had nothing to do with the out
come.
The Indians performed as well as
was expected in all cases except
that of Ed Luce, veteran hii'h

jumper, who whs stricken with
stomach trouble before the meet.
The difference lay in the fact that
as usual half a dozen of Dean
Cromwell's Trojans surpassed their
previous best marks to score unex
pected points.
Stanford won the first event and
the last, but was unable to break

into the S.C. monopoly at any time
in between. Two seconds and seven
thirds comprised the rest ol the
Indian scoring.
Frank Ganahl scored an im
pressive win in the mile run to
fcive Stanford a short-lived lead.
With the Trojans' top distance
man, Roland Sink, staying- out ol
tiie mile in order to concentrate
on the two-mile meet record, Ga
nahl was able to outsprint Trojan
Wally Wilson to win in 4 min.
30.4 sec.
John Kenward, after three weeks
ol practice on Angell Field, threw
the javelin 17G feet G'.'i in. to give
Stanford its other victory.
Captain Martin Anderson edged
into the scoring in three events. He
tiocl with teammate Bill Larson at
12 ft. 8 in. for second in the pole
vault. Tex Winters, S.C.'s transfer
from Oregon, soared to a height of
13 11% to take first.
Anderson tallied one-half point
for a tie for third in the 100, and
another half for the same place
in the low hurdles. The century
winner. Mel Patton of S.C., ran
the distance in 9.9 sec., identical
to Anderson's mark of last week.

George Grimes, Indian sopho
more, lost the afternoon's closest
race, the half-mile, to Trojan Jim
Slosson in the slow time of 1:59.7.
Slosson was able to sprint past
Grimes on the last turn and hold a
one-stride margin to the tape.
Sink succeeded in breaking the
two-mile mark by 17 seconds when
he ran 9 min. 22.4 sec. The old
mark was held by Mushy Girard,
running for the Farm in 1939. Wil
son turned the tables on Ganahl to
take second in the eight - lapper,
when the latter eased up as he
neared the finish.
Luce, co-favorite to win the high
jump, was only able to clear (>
feet and thus finished out of the
money as three Southern Cali
lornians tied at (! ft. 2 in.
Winston Mumby came in for an
unexpected point when he put the
shot 42-10 to take third behind Tro
jan "Moose" Thompson's tremen
dous put of 52-9.
The meet's high point man was
A 1 Lawrence. He took the hurdles
in 14.7 and 23.7 and the broad
jump at 24 ft. 1 in. These marks
stamp him as one of the best in the
country in all of these events.


FRANK GANAHL . . . who ran
to a well-paced mile victory over
Wally Wilson of'S.C. in Satur
day's track meet.
