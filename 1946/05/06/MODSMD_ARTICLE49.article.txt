# CARD TANKERS SWAMP BEARS
## Swimmers Break, Equal National P.C.C. Records 
### ART LEVINSON 
Cracking one record and tying another, Stanford swimmers
went further along on their road to undisputed aquatic superior
ity in the West by downing California, 55 to 19, in a meet in the
Cardinal tanks Saturday afternoon.
Performing before a packed, sun-soaking crowd, Tom Haynie's strong
I mermen swept through the Blue and Gold like so much shredded paper in
a carton, with but two exceptions. Stanford is now established as the
; dual meet champion of the conference, having previously drubbed UCLA
j and USC.

A new record in the 200-yard'
breast stroke was racked up by Don
Hester, who swam the distance in
2.28.8. This bests the previous na
tional intercollegiate freshman mark
of 2.29.8 set by Paul Metcalf of
Yale. Hester also dropped the Pa
cific Coast mark of 2.29.5 into the
wastepaper basket. The latter rec
ord was held by Roy Vitousek of
Stanford.
In the 50-yard free style event,
Bob Anderson tied the Pacific Coast
record time 23.1. This time adds
another niche to the fast-growing
list of record held by Mr. Anderson.
Finishing with a one-two in most
events, Stanford supremacy was
never in any doubt. Only in the div
ing department and 440-yard free
style event did Cal come through
with the blue ribbon.
