# Campus Road Honors Sam McDonald, Favorite Member of Stanford Family
## 
### JEAN BURNET 
The sign reads "Sam McDonald
Road." A few wonder who Sam
McDonald is, hundreds who know
him as just plain "Sam" value him
as a friend and as a beloved mem
ber of the Stanford family.
May 10, 1941, a group of Sam's
friends gathered to hear Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur dedicate the road
running past Angell Field, the ten
nis courts, and around the south
end of the stadium, in the name of
Sam McDonald, the only man to
receive the honor on this campus.
ELECTION THREAT
Holding a handful of telegrams
and notes of congratulations, Dr.
Wilbur commented, "If I ever had
to run against Sam McDonald for
the presidency of the University,
I'd be mighty afraid of the results,"
in recognition of the many friends

Sam has made since he came to the
Farm as a teamster in 1903. He also
stated that Sam is one of the oldest
and most loyal and valuable mem
bers of the Stanford family. Alter
these words of praise, McDonald
put the new street sign in place and
expressed his great pleasure at re
ceiving the honor. Thus ended the
simple ceremony.
In 1007 Sam McDonald became
superintendent of athletic grounds
and buildings and under his super
vision Angell Field was constructed
in 1037.
FITTING HONOR
It is fitting that a road leading
to the sites of athletic battles
should be named after the man who
is largely responsible for the ex
cellent condition of those grounds.
Under the superintendent's skill
ful care and watchful eye Stan
ford's athletic plant has earned and
kept its reputation for being one of
the finest on the coast. Although a
supervisor, McDonald has often
pitched in himself when labor was
scarce or the job difficult. He is
well known for his painstaking turf
vending.
BARBECUE KINO
Not only is Sam famous as a con
scientious and skillful worker, but
his title of barbecue king is known
to generations of Stanford students.
His renowned barbecues at his re
treat at La Honda were at first
feasts to bring together the sons
and daughters of his former "pro
teges"; then the circle widened to
include the children of all Stanford
alumni. Those who attended these
affairs recall them as some of their

happiest memories of Farm life.
HOST OK FRIENDS
Many Cardinal athletic greats are
to be found in the ranks of modest
Sam McDonald's friends and their
voices join with a host of others
to pronounce him truly worthy of
an honor not even accorded to the
founders of the University.
The sign's there. Take a look
at it.
