# 'The Blue Dahlia' Has Murder, Love, Liquor

### 
THE BLUE DAHLIA — A Para
mount picture — now playing at
Ihe Paramount Theater in San
Francisco.
Raymond Chandler, author of
such hard-boiled stulf as "Murder,
My Sweet" and"The Big Sleep."
has scripted his first original screen
play in "The Blue Dahlia," a cyni
cal, tawdry treatment of life and
death in that mecca of sultry sextra
girls and suntanned smoothies, Hol
lywood.
MURDER, LOVE, LIQUOR
''The Blue Dahlia" has plenty of
the three Chandler essentials, mur
der, love, and liquor, plus reels of
bristling dialogue that make you
wish you never left home.
The film poses the question, "Who
killed Doris Dowling?" Doris, it
sems, was a Victory Girl who never
quite got reconverted—instead she
got croaked. Nobody, though, is es
pecially unhappy to hear the news,
except the hotel manager, and that's
just because he's afraid the inci
dent will give his place a bad name.
MURDER SUSPECTS
Among the suspects who go un
der the police white lights are Alan
Ladd, a steely ex-Navy flyer who
is just as cold and impassionate as
any Chandler character is required
to be; Eddie De Sylva, breezy own
er of a Sunset Strip spot ("The Blue
Dahlia") that caters to those who
have a bankroll but nothing else
desirable; and William Bendix, a
bitter amnesia victim who drinks
bourbon with bourbon chasers.
Veronica Lake is also caught in
Chandler's web of viciousness for

no other reason than to provide
romantic interest for Mr. Ladd in
his more sentimental moments.
Chandler, who treats Hollywood
as though it were Los Angeles's il
legitimate child, throws in many of
his personal touches to heighten
the film's atmosphere: a dead body
being found as a cheery announcer
says isn't it a fine day and how
swell it must feel to be alive; list
less police reporters pitching pen
nies while waiting for something to
break; and the inevitable walk-up
apartment wilji its sleazy night
clerk.
HYPER-REALISTIC FILMS
"The Blue Dahlia," although more
than a little unbelievable, is never
theless strong screen fare. It looks
as though the hyper-realistic films
will form a major part of the most
war motion picture output.

The Stanford Theater is showing

ing a merry tune and everybody,
including the audience for once, is
happy.—Dick Bower
