# Smaller U.S. Diet, Cooperatives May Check Famine, Says Luck
## 
### BOYD HAIGHT 
"We must eat less!" This is the
admonition Dr. J. Murray Luck
makes to Stanford students and to
the nation.
Dr. Luck, professor of biochem
istry and author of the recently
published book, "The War on Mal
nutrition and Poverty," recognizes
the part the United States must
play in feeding the starving peoples
of the world. He urges a change in
our diets which will both serve this
end and protect the nation's health.
EAT FRESH FOODS
A nutrition expert, Dr. Luck
agrees with the government policy
that the American people be asked
to reduce diets highly charged with
carbohydrates. "We must switch
jiver to a diet richer in fruits and
vegetables, lower in cereals," he
states.
Dr. Luck's concern with the fam
ine problem includes not only our
efforts to alleviate it but also the
efforts of the afflicted peoples them
selves. His book traces the role of
consumer co-operatives in the fight
against malnutrition and poverty,
and it is with these co-operatives
that much of his interest lies in
considering the recovery of famine
stricken oeoples.
EUROPE HAS OPPORTUNITY
"The people of Europe may have
the opportunity of accomplishing
their own recovery through the
restoration of co-operative societies
with which they were familiar be

fore the war. If they are given en
couragement they could accomplish
production and distribution tasks
now so badly snarled.
"Co-operative societies do not
require gifts but only two impor
tant forms of assistance. First, ade
quate leadership; second, facilities
for borrowing money to get the en
terprises under way," states Dr.
Luck.
EARLY COMEBACK
Realizing that famine conditions
in Europe have resulted from de
struction of crops and land by the
tides of war that have v olied over
them in the past five years, Dr.
Luck hopes for an early comeback
in agricultural production.
"Co-operatives will play their
role in proving extremely effective
in increasing production of agri
culture and the wide distribution of
consumer goods."
POVERTY DANGER
Dr. Luck describes the develop
ment and operation of these co
operatives in his book. He has taken
as his theme the premise that mal
nutrition has resulted from poverty
and that co-operatives provide an
effective means of combating pov
erty.
He introduces the subject by
stating, "In discussing co-opera
tives the purpose will be to bring
to the fore one aspect of consumers'
co-operation often inadequately
stressed in other works—the enor
mous amount that people can do
for themselves in bettering their
economic welfare."
SELF-HELP
The production, marketing, and
distribution of goods by groups
striving for economic betterment is
the essence of the co-operative
movement. The working principle
is a distribution of profits to pa
trons in proportion to purchases.
Dr. Luck emphasizes in his book
the place of co-operative techniques
in preserving and developing ini
tiative and sturdiness in men.
"The principle of self-help is of
a fundamental importance in co
operative development."
CHARITY INTERVENTION
Of areas where there is no basis
for this development he says, "Pov
erty due to intellectual and physi
cal incompetence of an inherited
character calls for intervention by
the state and by private charity."
Dr. Luck bases his hope for the
regrowth of co-operatives in Eu
rope on their early emergence from
the oppressive economic system of
the 19th century. "Almost one-fifth
of the population of Great Britain
are members of consumer co-op
eratives and from one-tenth to one
sixth of all British retail trade flows
through co-operative channels."
CO-OPS LATE IN U.S.
The rugged individualism of the
American people may have ac
counted for the late start co-oper
atives got in this country. Not until
1910 was any 'movement" under
way, according to Dr. Luck.
Despite the differences in growth,
co-operative movements have be
come accepted on both sides of the
Atlantic. An example of the cre
dence they are given is evidenced
by the recommendation of the 1944
United Nations Conference on Food
and Agriculture. The conference
urged all countries "to study the
possibilities of the further estab

lishment of producer and consum
er societies in order to render nec
essary production, marketing, pur
chasing, finance, and other serv
ices."

stricken oeoples.
EUROPE HAS OPPORTUNITY
"The people of Europe may have
the opportunity of accomplishing
their own recovery through the
restoration of co-operative societies
with which they were familiar be

fore the war. If they are given en
couragement they could accomplish
production and distribution tasks
now so badly snarled.
"Co-operative societies do not
require gifts but only two impor
tant forms of assistance. First, ade
quate leadership; second, facilities
for borrowing money to get the en
terprises under way," states Dr.
Luck.
EARLY COMEBACK
Realizing that famine conditions
in Europe have resulted from de
struction of crops and land by the
tides of war that have v olied over
them in the past five years, Dr.
Luck hopes for an early comeback
in agricultural production.
"Co-operatives will play their
role in proving extremely effective
in increasing production of agri
culture and the wide distribution of
consumer goods."
POVERTY DANGER
Dr. Luck describes the develop
ment and operation of these co
operatives in his book. He has taken
as his theme the premise that mal
nutrition has resulted from poverty
and that co-operatives provide an
effective means of combating pov
erty.
He introduces the subject by
stating, "In discussing co-opera
tives the purpose will be to bring
to the fore one aspect of consumers'
co-operation often inadequately
stressed in other works—the enor
mous amount that people can do
for themselves in bettering their
economic welfare."
SELF-HELP
The production, marketing, and
distribution of goods by groups
striving for economic betterment is
the essence of the co-operative
movement. The working principle
is a distribution of profits to pa
trons in proportion to purchases.
Dr. Luck emphasizes in his book
the place of co-operative techniques
in preserving and developing ini
tiative and sturdiness in men.
"The principle of self-help is of
a fundamental importance in co
operative development."
CHARITY INTERVENTION
Of areas where there is no basis
for this development he says, "Pov
erty due to intellectual and physi
cal incompetence of an inherited
character calls for intervention by
the state and by private charity."
Dr. Luck bases his hope for the
regrowth of co-operatives in Eu
rope on their early emergence from
the oppressive economic system of
the 19th century. "Almost one-fifth
of the population of Great Britain
are members of consumer co-op
eratives and from one-tenth to one
sixth of all British retail trade flows
through co-operative channels."
CO-OPS LATE IN U.S.
The rugged individualism of the
American people may have ac
counted for the late start co-oper
atives got in this country. Not until
1910 was any 'movement" under
way, according to Dr. Luck.
Despite the differences in growth,
co-operative movements have be
come accepted on both sides of the
Atlantic. An example of the cre
dence they are given is evidenced
by the recommendation of the 1944
United Nations Conference on Food
and Agriculture. The conference
urged all countries "to study the
possibilities of the further estab

lishment of producer and consum
er societies in order to render nec
essary production, marketing, pur
chasing, finance, and other serv
ices."
"We must eat less!" This is the
admonition Dr. J. Murray Luck
makes to Stanford students and to
the nation.
Dr. Luck, professor of biochem
istry and author of the recently
published book, "The War on Mal
nutrition and Poverty," recognizes
the part the United States must
play in feeding the starving peoples
of the world. He urges a change in
our diets which will both serve this
end and protect the nation's health.
EAT FRESH FOODS
A nutrition expert, Dr. Luck
agrees with the government policy
that the American people be asked
to reduce diets highly charged with
carbohydrates. "We must switch
jiver to a diet richer in fruits and
vegetables, lower in cereals," he
states.
Dr. Luck's concern with the fam
ine problem includes not only our
efforts to alleviate it but also the
efforts of the afflicted peoples them
selves. His book traces the role of
consumer co-operatives in the fight
against malnutrition and poverty,
and it is with these co-operatives
that much of his interest lies in

and that co-operatives provide an
effective means of combating pov
erty.
He introduces the subject by
stating, "In discussing co-opera
tives the purpose will be to bring
to the fore one aspect of consumers'
co-operation often inadequately
stressed in other works—the enor
mous amount that people can do
for themselves in bettering their
economic welfare."
SELF-HELP
The production, marketing, and
distribution of goods by groups
striving for economic betterment is
the essence of the co-operative
movement. The working principle
is a distribution of profits to pa
trons in proportion to purchases.
Dr. Luck emphasizes in his book
the place of co-operative techniques
in preserving and developing ini
tiative and sturdiness in men.
"The principle of self-help is of
a fundamental importance in co
operative development."
CHARITY INTERVENTION
Of areas where there is no basis
for this development he says, "Pov
erty due to intellectual and physi
cal incompetence of an inherited
character calls for intervention by
the state and by private charity."
Dr. Luck bases his hope for the
regrowth of co-operatives in Eu
rope on their early emergence from
the oppressive economic system of
the 19th century. "Almost one-fifth
of the population of Great Britain
are members of consumer co-op
eratives and from one-tenth to one
sixth of all British retail trade flows
through co-operative channels."
CO-OPS LATE IN U.S.
The rugged individualism of the
American people may have ac
counted for the late start co-oper
atives got in this country. Not until
1910 was any 'movement" under
way, according to Dr. Luck.
Despite the differences in growth,
co-operative movements have be
come accepted on both sides of the
Atlantic. An example of the cre
dence they are given is evidenced
by the recommendation of the 1944
United Nations Conference on Food
and Agriculture. The conference
urged all countries "to study the
possibilities of the further estab

lishment of producer and consum
er societies in order to render nec
essary production, marketing, pur
chasing, finance, and other serv
ices."
