WASHINGTON, May 5 (UP).â€”
Rep. Walter Norblad, R., Ore., said
tonight that the Navy is all wet. He
never felt better in his life.
Reporting on his condition after
eating a lunch salvaged from the
Navy's Astoria. Ore., garbage dump,
he said he felt "like a million dol
lars." The Navy had said he'd wake
up with dysentery.
