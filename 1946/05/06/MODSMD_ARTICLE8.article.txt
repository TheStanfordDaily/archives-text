The Axe is on the move
again.
According to reliable sources,
a University of California cam
pus cop got a lead on the where
abouts of the famed, oft-stolen
Stanford Axe.
However, the story goes, he
spoke too freely about his in
formation and one of the cul
prits overheard him. So before
any action could be taken to
recover the chopper it was
moved again.
Because of the swiftness in
changing the Axe's hiding
place, only three of the original
six now know where it is.
The story going around the
Boar campus is that the Axe
will turn up again at the Big
Game but until then will re
main underground.
Officials of both schools arc
co-operating in an attempt to
recover the trophy, and the
northern campus has been ad
vised that if the Axe does not
turn up soon, the administra
tion will take action affecting
the student body as a whole.
Meanwhile, Bill Stcif, the man
on duty at the Cellar store when
the Axe was stolen, declared to
a reporter, "Once and for all
. . . No, I don't know where the
Axe is!"
Some Stanford students ap
parently cared enough to make
the trip to Cal over the week
end in nn attempt to find the
hiding place of the Axe. But
alas, Stanford's big chopper re
mains in enemy territory.
