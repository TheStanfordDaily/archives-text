# Campus Group For Anderson
## 
### 
As election time draws nearer,
another group of Stanford students
have joined together to support
their candidate, John Z. Anderson.
Headed by James Kessler. grad
uate student, a nonpartisan veter
an organization has been formed
to represent the Republican in
cumbent on campus for the com
ing contest.
The group is made up of both Re
publican and Democratic members.
This makes two major committees
which have formed during the
Eighth District campaign. Support
ing Charles McDonald, '35, is the
"Veteran's McDonald for Congress
Committee" which is headed by
Malcolm McLeod.
Kessler announced last night that
he thought it was time that it be
realized that not all veterans were
behind McDonald. He said that
through the Nonpartisan Veterans'
Committee the other side of the
political picture will be presented.
"We plan to clarify the political
situation on campus as much as pos
sible," he stated.
Kessler complained that the im
pression had been given that the
veterans as a whole were in favor
of the election of McDonald.
"This is in no way the true status
at. Stanford," he commented.
The Nonpartisan Veterans' Com
mittee is now circulating a peti
tion in which they complain that
headlines in the Daily issue of
May 2 were slanted in McDonald's
favor.
It is hoped by this move, said
Kessler, that in the future a more
"nonpartisan view" will be pre
sented.
