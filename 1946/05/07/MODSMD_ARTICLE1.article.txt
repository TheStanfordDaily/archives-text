# 'Axe Theft Not by Cal'-U.C. Prexy
## Kennedy Reminds Students of 1936 No-Raids Ruling 
### 
Following a thorough investi
gation of activities among stu
dents at the University of Cali
fornia, ASUC president Dick
Rowson said yesterday that as
far as he was able to determine,
no California student participat
ed in the theft of Stanford's Axe
nine days ago.
"The statement in The Daily Cali
fornian (reprinted in the Stanford
Daily) that a campus policeman had
a clue proving the Axe was at Cal
is completely erroneous," Rowson
stated. His investigation will con
tinue, and further developments re
ported to ASSU President Bob
Kennedy.
Kennedy meanwhile advised
Stanford students to withhold
judgment as to Cal's part in the
theft on the basis of Rowson's
statement, and asked that Indians
refrain from retaliatory expedi
tions lo the Berkeley campus.
He referred students to the Big
Game Raids agreement, signed be
tween the two schools in 1936,
which reads as follows:
"In order to avoid any occurrence
that might endanger the friendly
relations between our Universities,
and in order to maintain the fine
sportsmanship that has been the
tradition of our "Big Game," we,
the representatives of our student
bodies, do hereby resolve:
(a) That there shall he no in
vasions by the students of either
University of the campus of the
other, and that students partici
pating in such violations will be
subject to severe discipline.
(b) That each student body
will undertake to educate its
members in the weeks preceding
the Cig Game to observe the spirit
of the foregoing resolution, and to
exercise every possible measure
to prevent any incident arising
that might lead to its violation."
This resolution was signed by Jim
Reynolds and Leonard Charvet, stu
dent body presidents of Stanford
and California.
