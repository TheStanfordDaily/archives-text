## Steel Co. Faces Possible Closure 
### 
CHICAGO, May 6 (UP). —Coal
famine stalked (lie nation tonight.
The shadow of a brownout fell
across a fourth great city, and the
nation's largest steel producer was
threatened with a total shutdown
in three weeks. The number of idle
workers in all industries mounted
hourly.
Interior Secretary J. A. Krug pre
dicted that soft coal would have to
be rationed next winter. He said
even an immediate settlement of the
coal strike could not prevent a seri
ous shortage during the next heat
ing season.
The coal strike was in its IWith
day. Angry congressmen de
manded government interven
tion. hut John L. Lewis, president
of the AFL United Mine Workers,
seemed no nearer agreement with
the coal operators than he had
heen a week or a month ago.
Detroit's city council took steps
to join Chicago and Washington in
ordering a return of the wartime
brownout. Philadelphia continued
its voluntary dimout.
Irving S. Olds, chairman of the
board of U. S. Steel Corp., told
stockholders that, with the strictest
economy the corporation's existing
coal supply could last only three
more weeks. He said production in
the Pittsburgh district, would be
down to 9 per cent of normal this
week.
Carnegie-Illinois Steel, a U. S.
Steel subsidiary, closed down (he
sheet division of its Gary, Ind.,
sheet and tin mill—world's larg
est finishing and fabricating plant
—because of the Indiana dimout.
