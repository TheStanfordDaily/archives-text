SAN FRANCISCO. May 6 (UP).
—Three hundred delegates from
seven maritime unions today voted
to consider joint strike action after
hearing Harry Bridges, internation
al president of the Longshoremen's
and Warehousemen's Union, urge
consolidation "as a barrier to an
other world war."
A strike action committee is to
be appointed to make recommenda
tions, union spokesmen said.
"Our people dislike to load
ships for Franco Spain," Bridges
said. "We don't like it any more
than we did taking blood money
for loading scrap iron to Japan
many years ago."
Bridges charged that shippers had
been "playing one union against the
other" and telling labor representa
tives during wage negotiations in
plain words to go to hell."
Jack Winocur, of the CIO Ameri
can Communications Association,
told the convention wage negotia
tions with shippers were "going no
where on either the East or West
Coast.." He said the ACA would not
make a separate agreement with
Pacific American ship operators de
spile "some indications" |he opera
tors would attempt to "buy off" the
West Coast union.
Bridges charged that the Na
tional Shipping Association was
"seeking to emasculate all un
ions." lie urged merger of the
seven unions as an "answer" to
the shippers.
"If we mean what we say about
wishing to stop another world war
we must, respond to the many pleas
to cement relations wilh unions of
other nations," Bridges declared.
