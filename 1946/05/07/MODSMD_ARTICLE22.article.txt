### 
WASHINGTON. May fi (UP).—
President Truman conferred with
his top labor and reconversion aides
on the soft coal crisis tonight,
heightening speculation that gov
ernment seizure of the strikebound
mines might ke contemplated as a
last resort.
The President talked over the
.'56-day strike for a full hour with
Secretary of Labor B.
Schwellcnbach, Reconversion Di
rector John W. Snyder, and John
R. Steclman, Mr. Truman's special
assistant.
None of the conferees would com
ment on the seizure, reports, but it
was obvious their discussion had
centered on the impotence of all
other measures undertaken by the
government so far to effect a set
tlement.
Schwellenbach told reporters
flatly that "I just can't say any
thing"- about the conference.
The meeting coincided with a
warning from Secretary of the
Interior J. A. King that rationing
of soft coal would have to he re
instated next winter because of
this strike.
Krug told a press conference that
even immediate settlement of the
strike would not avert serious coal
shortage during the next heating
season.
He said the government's emerg
ency stockpile is down to about
three weeks' supply and "dwindling
fast."
Hospitals, railroads and other
"public welfare" consumers, he
warned, may be uiaable to get fur
ther help when that reserve is gone.
