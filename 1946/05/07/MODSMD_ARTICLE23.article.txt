## Training, Arming Of Unified Force By U.S. Suggested 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 6 (UP),
j â€”President Truman asked Con
gress today to authorize a
sweeping program of inter-
American military collaboration
under which the combined
strength of the new world
would be welded into a unified
force trained and armed by tho
United States.
The President laid down his revo
lutionary plan in the form of an
: "inter-American military coopera -
j tion act" which he sent to both
houses with the request that it he
enacted as speedily as possible.
It was indicated that adminis
tration whips would press for
passage before the Rio de Janeiro
conference, tentatively set for this
; summer.
The act of Chapultepee is slated
! to be replaced at that meeting by u
| new hemispheric defense pact, and
Mr. Truman apparently hopes to
I present his plan then for all-Amer
| ican approval.
It envisages for the first time in
j history the creation of a unified
I American force stretching from the
: Arctic to the Antarctic, using stand
| ardized land, sea and air weapons
| supplied from the United States'
| vast arsenals.
It also provides for establish
i mcnt of a joint chiefs of staff
; from all the American countries
which could, in the event of an -
gression, speedily mobilize all the
' hemisphere's nilitary might.
Mr. Truman emphasized the spe
cial responsibility for leadership
resting upon this country because
! of its "preponderant technical, ecu
j nomic and military resources."
He proposed that Congress au
! thorize the President to sell or oth
erwise transfer to any American
nation, including Canada, any mili
tary or naval equipment he selects.
The bill specifies, however, that
1 this country would expect other na
tions to turn in outmoded weapons
and equipment in exchange for the
i U.S. .arms.
