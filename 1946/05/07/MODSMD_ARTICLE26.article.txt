# Prefabricated Units Added To Chemistry Department
## 
### 
11l order lo conduct special, con
fidential experiments for the gov
ernment the Stanford Chemistry
Department has been allocated
three prefabricated housing units to
serve as laboratory space.
Under the direction of Dr. Philip
Leighton, the experiment will take
approximately two years to com
plete. according to Dr. William A.
Perkins, research associate in chem
istry, who is also working on the
project.
Working on the project for Stan
ford with Dr. Leighton, acting Dean
of the School of Physical Sciences,
are Dr, Perkins, Dr. Stuart VV.
Grinnell, Chemistry research asso
ciate, and Major F. X. Webster, re
search associate, who is in charge
of the units' construction and out
fitting with experimental cquip
mcn t.
The prefabricated units were pro
vided by the War Department for
this confidential work by contract,
through the Stanford Administra
tion.
Dr. Perkins explained that the
prefabricated units were obtained
directly from the War Department
for their use. The reason that such
units arc unavailable for veterans'
housing is that the government, un
-1 der the direction of the War Asset:
Administration, allots all surplus
material (including prefabricated
: units) on a priority system.
I Laboratory space for University

students is also needed very badly,
Perkins added. By fall quarter, litis
situation may become acut° due to
thr fact that. more graduate in
dents will be entering the Univer
sity in addition to Ihe fhcreasinj;
number of undergraduate chemis
try students.
