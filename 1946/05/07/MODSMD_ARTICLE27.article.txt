# The
						Honor Code
## 
### 
Is Its Future in Question?

Rumors have a bad way of undermining
things. . . . They come in from underneath,
and shake the foundation, and soon it's hard
to know what to believe or disbelieve.
We've heard a few too many rumors lately,
particularly about the Honor Code, an institu
tion at Slanford that has always been impor
tant to men and women in school and after
graduation.
L; essence the code is very simple: you
do.i'i cheat (give or receive unpermitted aid)
in class work, and"the University on its part
manifests its confidence in the honor of its
students by refraining from proctoring exam
inations . . When you sign the pledge in
your reg book you are also adhering to the
phrase stating that students "will do their
share and take an active part, in seeing to it
that others as well as themselves obey the
spirit and the letter of the Honor Code." In
other words, if you see someone violating the
Honor Code, you ask him to turn himself in
to Men's or Women's Council, or, if he re
fuses, you give the name to one of those
groups.

All very simple, but is it working? Those
rumors say no. They tell of cheating in
crowded classes, of copying from class notes
after taking an ex out of the room; of neglect
ing to turn in an Honor Code violation when
seen, of a number of other violations, which,
if true, would make the Honor Code as in
effective and as obsolete as mid-Victorian
morality in the twentieth century.
But it's our conviction that the conception
of personal honor involved in the Stanford
Code is not obsolete, and that the only way
of making the thihg work fairly is to spike the
rumors, or, if they're true, to do something
about them.
The questions, then, are:
1. —Men's and Women's Councils — Are
Honor Code violators being given the maxi
mum penalty with regard to the seriousness
ol the violation?
2.—Stanford students—Are you assuming
the responsibility attached to the Code ol ad
hering to it yourself, and of seeing that oth
ers do too? The future of the Honor Code,
functioning in an expanding university, may
well depend on your answers.— H.D.
