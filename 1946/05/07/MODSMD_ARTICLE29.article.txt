Cellar walkouts for the last three weeks
totalled more than $105.
Just what does that add up to? In money
maybe not so much, considering the Cellar's
large volume of business. In student respon
sibility, however, it adds up to plenty.
It adds up to the fact that some Stanford
students are actually careless enough, even
dishonest enough, to "overlook" paying that
five-cent check for their ten o'clock coffee, or
the 20-cent check for their afternoon milk
shake.
Yes, this is an editorial to bawl you out.

We don't give a tinker's damn about the
money as such. It's the fact that we come to
college as adults—supposedly. We are ex
pected to act like adults. But the Cellar walk
out situation seems to reverse our hopeful
little premise.
The people who stick their checks under
their coffee and then walk out forgetting to
pick them up, and the people who just "for
get" aren't kidding anybody else but them
selves.
Pardon me, buddy, but if you can't spare
a dime for a cup of coffee, get some water.
It's free.—M.S.
