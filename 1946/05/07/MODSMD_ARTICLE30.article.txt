### BILL STEIF 
McToad, Loveless and ourself were sitting around
a little table in the Cellar bemoaning the state of
the world. McToad had just issued me a "cease and
desist" order on the bread—he said they needed it
in Belgium.' We were talking about students riot
ing in China, in Egypt, in Palestine, in India and
Italy.
Then McToad started it. He said, "It seems to me
that students around here don't think because it
isn't fashionable."
We lifted our arms in supplication, jumped to our
feet and said, "Think about what?"
Loveless and McToad grabbed the milkshade we
had just overturned and in unison said, "Think
about world affairs, think about politics, think
about studying in order to learn something about
the world, think themselves into becoming con
scious of the new patterns of thought which are
arising amongst thoughtful, thinking people every
where."
We glared and hissed through our teeth, "Red
hots."
But the boys would not be stopped.
Loveless and McTOad grabbed the milkshake we
to college in such a state of immaturity that they
are seduced by such glamorous items as "going
down the road for a beer" to the extent that they
allow themselves to become completely disor
ganized, lose the interest which honest study can
engender and eventually just lose interest in
doing anything scholastically, intellectually, ex
cept to "get by." He thought that standards of
discipline such as class attendance and the
prompt turning in of required papers should be
jacked up. He suggested that more people should
he turned away from universities, that the cur
ricula should be stiffened, that good, trained
minds should be at a premium and should he
socially desirable.
We gasped and made noises which sounded like
a fish Hopping on the pier. We said, "But how
about a little balance, a little integration between
studies and just living and playing with people."
McToad jumped on me with a few thousand
well-chosen words.
"How can you," he said, "sit there and have the

gall to tell us that what we need is learning to live
and play together? If people want to do that why
don't they go to a Junior College? The way things
are now this is just a big, complicated high school."
We thought about the exam we had flunked
last Friday and managed to mutter, "High School,
yaaaaaa."
McToad went on to explain to me (hat the peo
ple now at college are supposed to be the na
tion's "future leaders." "But," he said, "if they
don't try to think about what's happening on
campus, in the nation and in the world now,
while they are here at college, what kind of lead
ership do you think they are going to furnish
when they get out in the chatoic, postwar world?"
We asked him what was happening 011 campus,
in the nation, in the world.
Of a sudden I was greeted by a babble of answers
in which the expletive, "you stupid boob, you" was
liberally mixed. They explained to me that the
atomic bomb was threatening our very existence,
that the coal strike in the United States was cut
ting down our production again, that Stanford
needed good, thoughtful men and women on the
ballot for the next ASSU election. Most of all they
reiterated to me that "there are thousands of peo
ple starving in the world every day, that these
thousands of people need the aid of this nation im
mediately and that we've got to get food to them
in order that the world's human resources aren't
infinitely debilitated."
Loveless and McToad pounded me with facts and
figures, demonstrated to me the tragic blow which
the postwar world i.s in danger of receiving if we,
meaning every individual in the plump and lush
U.S.A., don't make it our business to see that Eu
rope and Asia get at least a minimum amount to
eat. during the next year.
We had to go on a picnic so with the kind per
mission of our cellar partners we excused ourself.
As we stepped in line to pay our check we noted,
out of the corner of our 20-400 (good) eye, Mc-
Toad and Loveless snatching up the other pair of
hamburgers and the two extra 101's, round, they
had just ordered.
