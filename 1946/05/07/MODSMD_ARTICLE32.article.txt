# Stamps Go To Dibble
## 
### SUE ENGELHARD 
For over a year, there has been
a campaign among postage stamp
collectors to give their duplicate
stamps through the Red Cross to
patients in Army and Navy hos
pitals.
Veterans confined to long and te
dious hours within a hospital have
been able to enjoy collecting and
trading stamps.
Mrs. Ralph Lutz, of 541 San Juan
Road, who is in charge of the Hoo- |
V"r Library stamp collection, read
an appeal in the newspaper request- I
ing stamps for the veterans' hos
pitals, and began to gather dupli
cates of all kinds to send to Dibble, j
Since then, she has been mounting
rare and interesting stamps for ex- j
hibition, and saving more duplicates |
for the Red Cross.
Mrs. Lutz, the third curator
since the collection was begun,
sees a great advantage in saving
not only the stamps, as did her
predecessors, hut also the enve
lopes which are interesting for
their postmarks, ce'hsurc stamps, 1
and official headings.
About a year ago, the Red Cross i
organized a stamp collectors' club |
at Dibble Hospital, which has since |
grown to an organization of 39 j
members. After Mrs. Lutz ex- !
pressed an interest in helping the
stamp campaign by sending dupli
cates to the hospital, she was asked
to visit the club and speak on the
War Library collection. She took
with her several mounted exhibits
and some specialized albums of
Central European and Pacific
stamps.
Some of the stamps Mrs. Lutz
showed the club told the whole !
story of war and victory. A com
plete collection of German in
flation stamps surcharged up to 1
four billion marks, telling the
condition of that country after :
the first World War.
She also had German stamps with
Hindenburg's head which had been
made of network water-mark pa
per before Hitler's time, and of
swastika water-mark after. Later,
German stamps showed Hitler and
the swastika exclusively.
The scarcity of all supplies during
the war can be seen in the British
stamps that Mrs. Lutz showed, |
which were colored a dull shade ;
during the war years, probably due j
to the lack of proper dye.
The first occupation stamps used
by the Japanese in the Philippines
were merely the old American
stamps with the "United States"
blocked out, but later, Japanese-is
sued stamps were used, some even I
picturing maps of Bataan and Cor
regidor as belonging to Japan. Since
then, however, Philippine stamps
with a victory surcharge show the
return of the Americans and the
Japanes defeat.
The men were especially inter
ested in stamps from America and
foreign countries where they have
seen action. One veteran even
declared his intention of going
into (he business of selling stamps. !
At the invitation of the War Li
brary, two groups of veterans have
made return visits to see the col
lections there. The exhibits were
shown in Mr. Hoover's private of
fice.
There is still an urgent need for <
stamps and stamp albums. Any
student who has extra stamps or old ,
and forgotten collections can find ;
very appreciative hands for them at |
hospitals through the War Library,
Dibble Hospital, or the Red Cross.
Also, Mrs. Lutz says that any
enthusiastic stamp collector who
has duplicate stamps for trading
is very welcome to visit the War
Library and see its collection.
Mrs. Lutz herself is particularly
interested in obtaining war cov
ers.

For over a year, there has been
a campaign among postage stamp
collectors to give their duplicate
stamps through the Red Cross to
patients in Army and Navy hos
pitals.
Veterans confined to long and te
dious hours within a hospital have
been able to enjoy collecting and
trading stamps.
Mrs. Ralph Lutz, of 541 San Juan
Road, who is in charge of the Hoo- |
V"r Library stamp collection, read
an appeal in the newspaper request- I
ing stamps for the veterans' hos
pitals, and began to gather dupli
cates of all kinds to send to Dibble, j
Since then, she has been mounting
rare and interesting stamps for ex- j
hibition, and saving more duplicates |
for the Red Cross.
Mrs. Lutz, the third curator
since the collection was begun,
sees a great advantage in saving
not only the stamps, as did her
predecessors, hut also the enve
lopes which are interesting for
their postmarks, ce'hsurc stamps, 1
and official headings.
About a year ago, the Red Cross i
organized a stamp collectors' club |
at Dibble Hospital, which has since |
grown to an organization of 39 j
members. After Mrs. Lutz ex- !
pressed an interest in helping the
stamp campaign by sending dupli
cates to the hospital, she was asked
to visit the club and speak on the
War Library collection. She took
with her several mounted exhibits
and some specialized albums of
Central European and Pacific
stamps.
Some of the stamps Mrs. Lutz
showed the club told the whole !
story of war and victory. A com
plete collection of German in
flation stamps surcharged up to 1
four billion marks, telling the
condition of that country after :
the first World War.
She also had German stamps with
Hindenburg's head which had been
made of network water-mark pa
per before Hitler's time, and of
swastika water-mark after. Later,
German stamps showed Hitler and
the swastika exclusively.
The scarcity of all supplies during
the war can be seen in the British
stamps that Mrs. Lutz showed, |
which were colored a dull shade ;
during the war years, probably due j
to the lack of proper dye.
The first occupation stamps used
by the Japanese in the Philippines
were merely the old American
stamps with the "United States"
blocked out, but later, Japanese-is
sued stamps were used, some even I
picturing maps of Bataan and Cor
regidor as belonging to Japan. Since
then, however, Philippine stamps
with a victory surcharge show the
return of the Americans and the
Japanes defeat.
The men were especially inter
ested in stamps from America and
foreign countries where they have
seen action. One veteran even
declared his intention of going
into (he business of selling stamps. !
At the invitation of the War Li
brary, two groups of veterans have
made return visits to see the col
lections there. The exhibits were
shown in Mr. Hoover's private of
fice.
There is still an urgent need for <
stamps and stamp albums. Any
student who has extra stamps or old ,
and forgotten collections can find ;
very appreciative hands for them at |
hospitals through the War Library,
Dibble Hospital, or the Red Cross.
Also, Mrs. Lutz says that any
enthusiastic stamp collector who
has duplicate stamps for trading
is very welcome to visit the War
Library and see its collection.
Mrs. Lutz herself is particularly
interested in obtaining war cov
ers.
