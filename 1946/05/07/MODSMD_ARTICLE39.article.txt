# The 						Umpire's Verdict
## 
### JOHN SABIN 
This year has brought a complete
reversal in the Pacific Coast League
baseball picture. This time last year
Portland and Seattle were well
ahead of the pack, while a look at
the current standings shows San
Francisco, Los Angeles, and Oak
land in a three-way race for the
laurels that has left all others far
behind.
The pace-making San Francisco
Seals are still on top, despite rough
treatment at the hands of Bill
Sweeney's Los Angeles Angels last
week. It was the first series that
the Seals have dropped, and it
brought the hard-driving Angels to
two and a half games behind the
leaders.
Despite their drubbing from
the Angels, Seal gate receipts
continued to swell, with over
21,000 fans witnessing Sunday's
double - header. The Seals are
well on their way to becoming the
richest club of the minor leagues.
Last week saw opportunity
knocking at the door of Casey
Stengel's Oakland Acorns and go
ing away unheeded. While the Seals
were dropping their series, the Oaks
were taking on the not-too-tough
Hollywood team. If they had taken
five or six games from the Stars,
Stengel's boys would be right up
there with the Seals. Instead, they
dropped the series to Hollywood,
four games to three, remaining
three games behind the leaders and
dropping into third place.
As for the rest of the clubs,
the surprisingly weak Portland
and Seattle clubs fought it out
for last place with the Suds tak
ing four games out of seven.
There seems little hope for Se
attle to climb much higher, and
Portland may also remain in the
second division, although the half
dozen players that have joined the
club may provide the hitting power
that the Beavers so desperately
need.
In the other series, the San Diego
Padres took a five to two shellack
ing from Sacramento to drop to
seven games behind the Seals.
This week should provide a
breather for the leaders, as San
Francisco goes to Sacramento and
Los Angeles entertains Portland.
