Intervarsity Christian Fellowship
will meet in the vestry of Memorial
Church at 7 tonight to discuss the
place of the Christian religion in
the lives of college students. Ellis
Shaw will address the group.
This organization was started

' prior to World War I and has now
spread all over the world.
Roots of this Christian movement
j stem from the forceful preaching of
j young Charles Simeon at. Cam
! bridge University, England.
JEERS DIDN'T STOP HIM
For ten years the aisles of his
j church were crowded with inlor
â€¢ ested students, and despite the fact
j that he was greeted with jeers and
I cat-calls whenever he appeared in
I public, he continued to preach and
founded the organization, which
now extends throughout Europe,
j India, Canada, Australia, New Zea
land, and the United States.
Strongly backing this rapidly
; growing organization are many of
j the nation's prominent ministers,
I businessmen, and doctors; hut each
j individual chapter is entirely stu
dent-governed. non-denominational,
J and primarily interested in the uni
versal teachings of Christ.
FARM CHAPTER GROWS
Since the beginning no financial
guarantee or endowment has kept
up this student work, and students

| cisco Bay area now is active in this
! fellowship, with the University of
