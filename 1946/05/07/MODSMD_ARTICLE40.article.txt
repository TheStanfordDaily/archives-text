# Wolf to Start Against Marine Nine
## Indians Prep For S.C. Clash 
### STU MILLAR 
With the hope that his newly
developed wildness will subside as
quickly as it came on, Harry Wolter
will send Phil Wolf, Stanford's big
righthander, against the San Fran
cisco Marine nine on the Sunken
Diamond today at 3 p.m.
The Marines carry a veteran team
in more ways than one, according
to advance reports. Most of the
first string has be m through not
only the Pacific but the baseball
wars and should provide a good
contest for the victory-hungry Wol
termen.
However, this contest ranks only
as a practice affair. The games that
make the difference are this week
end when Sam Barry and his con
ference-leading Trojans arrive in
Palo Alto.
As for the rest of the Stanford
lineup, Wolter contemplates low
changes after what he terms a
"satisfying performance" against
UCLA. Due to a lab, Larry Prato
will not be on hand. His position
will be filled for the day by either
Tom Ward or Bob Rosburg. The
rest of the regular infield of Larry
Wolf, first sacker, Bob Peters, sec
ond baseman and Buck Brownson,
shortstop, will open. Dick Ahlquist
will catch.
Ray Winterhalter, a frosh in
fielder until today, will start in
right field, but Lloyd Merriman and
George Sloat will remain on the
first string at center and left field
positions respectively.
Due to the heat and the absence
of many menâ€”Wolter confined
practice to a short hitting and
snappy fielding practice yesterday
and sent the boys to the showers
early.


PHIL WOLF . . . who will start against the San Francisco Marines
today. It will be his first start since his recent loss to U.C.L.A.
