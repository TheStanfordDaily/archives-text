## 
### 
NEW YORK, May G (UP).—The
Boston Red Sox, threatening by an
early burst of speed to turn the
American League race into a run
away, fattened their winning streak
to 11 games today by beating the
St. Louis Browns in both games of
a doubleheader, 7 to 5 and 5 to 4,
behind timely hitting.
The victories, coupled with the
New York Yankee loss to the Chi
cago White Sox. gave Boston a
three-game first place lead.
WILLIAMS STARS—AS USUAL
Characteristically, the booming
bat of Ted Williams played the
major role in both victories. Wil
liams, who made six hits in seven
times at bat during the two games,
led the way to the opening victory
driving in three runs on two
doubles and a single. Sophomore
pitcher Dave (Boo) Ferriss was
banged for 11 hits by Brownie bat
ters, but his mates gave him enough
support to win without too much
difficulty. A five-run rally on five
hits and an error routed St. Louis
pitcher Denny Galehouse in the
fifth : : nning.
Williams singled in the ninth in
ning of the second game, went to
second on a sacrifice, and scored the
winning run on Dom DiMaggio's
single to center. Hal Wagner. Red
Sox catcher, got a second - inning
homer and Vernon Stephens hit a
homer for St. Louis in the opener.
Joe Dobson went all the way to
score his fourth straight victory in
the nightcap.
LEFTY LEE TIES UP YANKS
The Yankees ran into Lefty
Thornton Lee of the White Sox on
one of his bitter days and he kept
them from doing any of their long
range hitting in a well-pitched 2-
to-1 victory. Lee, 38-year-old vet
eran, was the hitting star, too, driv
ing in both runs in the second in
ning with a sharp single to end the
Yankee winning streak at five
games. Ralph Hodgin started the
rally with a single and Yankee
pitcher Floyd Bevens hit Dario Lo
digiani with a ball. Both runners
moved up on a sacrifice by Mike
Tresh and scored on Lee's single.
Lee hit Phil Rizzuto with a pitch
and the little Yankee shortstop
scored in the seventh on George
Stirnweiss' second double for the
only Yankee run.
The Tigers made it two out of
three over the Athletics at Phila

dolphia when Virgil (Fire) Trucks
came up with his most effective J
pitching job since the World Sei'ies
last fall to give Detroit a 3-to-l tri- j
umph. He scattered six hits, struck
out seven, and walked only two
batters. Jimmy Outlaw's home run |
gave the Tigers a 1 -all tie in the j
third after some defective fielding '
by Pat Mullin provided the A's with !
their only run in the first half of the i
inning.
The Senators defeated the In
dians. 7 to 4, in a battle of homers
at spacious Griffith Stadium in
Washington. Jeff Heath got a tre
mendous two-run homer over the
right center fence for Washington,
while Ken Keltner and Hank Ed
wards hit long four-base blows for
Cleveland.
No games were scheduled in the j
National League.
