# Owners Back MacPhail Suit
## 
### 
NEW YORK, May 6 (UP).-Ma
jor league club owners regarded
Yankee President Larry MacPhail's |
court action against the Mexican
Baseball League with a tongue-in
cheek attitude tonight, silently pull
ing for him but outwardly uncon- i
cerned.
The Yankees' fiery, red-thatched
boss seeks injunctions against Jorge
Pasquel, Mexican loop president,
and five alleged associates tomor
row in special sessions of the State >
Supreme Court in an attempt to
block their raids on the local bomb
ers.
President William Brensvvanger
of the Pirates, although one of the
few club heads to comment,
seemed to express the general at
titude of the big leagues when he
said at Pittsburgh that "We've had
no occasion to join MacPhail's ac
tion in restraining the Mexican
League but if we did have a rea
son I think we would."
The two St. Louis magnates, Sam
Breadon of the Cardinals and Bill
DeWitt of the Browns, had no com
ment, waiting to see what luck the
Yankees' president would have in
court. The Browns barely rescued
their star shortstop, Vern Stephens,
from the Mexicans' clothes while
George (Whitey) Kurowski, the
Redbirds' ace third baseman, cur
rently is being wooed by the Pas
quels.
MacPhail obtained a restraining
order from Justice Benjamin F.
Schreiber of the Supreme Court,
enjoining six men from indusing or
attempting to induce any players to
repudiate their signed Yankee con
tracts or to play in the Mexican
League.
The order named Jorge Pas
quel; his brother Bernardo, league
vice - president; Claire (Itud)
Rcnnic, New York Herald Trib
une baseball writer; Mario Lou
cas, a business associate of the
Pasquel brothers; John Ohrbar,
identified as Ralph Ober, a prep
t school journalism instructor; and
Carlos Baz, a travel agent.
They will appear in special ses-
I sion tomorrow to show cause why
I the restraining order should not be
I permanent.
