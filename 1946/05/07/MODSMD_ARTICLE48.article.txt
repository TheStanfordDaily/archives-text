### ART LEVINSON 
NOTE TO RALLY COM: Tho
spring sports agenda on the Farm
winds up with a grand finale June
1, with a track meet, baseball game, ■,
and tennis matches on the docket
with our traditional rivals, Califor
nia. It isn't in the books, but why
not arrange a rally for these sports
a few days before the "Big Cir
cus"?
Yes—we know that it isn't cus- j
tomary to put on a lot of hoopla
for track, baseball, and tennis, but
so what? Maybe we'd be starting
a good practice. These latter sports
have never gotten the credit they
deserve. A rally would show these
athletes that they're not completely j
forgotten.

Two smaller California colleges
are going to get on the big-time
football circuit. Both Fresno State
and San Jose State Colleges are ar
ranging schedules for next fall that
would do credit to any school.
Fresno State, in particular, is ex
pected to field an exceptionally
powerful gridiron machine. Bobby
Fellows, fresh out of the service, is
back at the "raisin capital" campus
ready to play football.
Fellows was slated to perform
for U.S.C. in '4.'{ while he was in
the Navy program, but his scho
lastic marks threw his activities
to an intramural level.
As for the team San Jose will
produce, not much is known now.
The Staters have always nurtured
thoughts of really going big-time in
athletics, and from various sources
we gather that they have embarked
on that course now.
How the state fathers, who keep
Fresno State and San Jose State
alive by legislative financial kick
backs, will look upon the two
: schools' desires to go high-class, we
don't know.
If these schools get their budg-

ets lipped for athletic purposes,
(hen the other colleges in the Cali
fornia scheme will howl. Schools
like Chieo State. Humboldt State,
and San Diego State don't want
to play second liddle to anybody.
It takes plenty of money to oper
ate a well-geared athletic program,
and if you're dependent on the state
for funds, the course is plenty dan
gerous, especially if you're starting
i from scratch,

Besides taking a three - way
lacing in baseball, track, and ten
nis on Saturday, another group of
Stanford students took a beating
in another sport — racing at ISay
Meadows.
About $2,000 was plunked across
for "the sure thing" by a group of
horsemen. After confidently plac
ing their wagers, they retired to
J their box to watch their dollar bills
t double and triple as their pony
I came charging across.
But Aptos Honey wasn't in
good form, and ran a poor sev
enth.
