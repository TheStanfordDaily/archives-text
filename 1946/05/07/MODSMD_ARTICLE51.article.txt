### 
LOS ANGELES, May 7 (UP).—
With bread supplies slashed as
much as 50 per cent because of re
duced flour deliveries, competition
was keen today for the relatively
few loaves available in Southern
California stores.
Lines of customers began forming
early to obtain bread as soon as it
was delivered. Yesterday most
markets were sold out before noon.
At one store the bread stock was
sold out within half an hour after
it was placed on the shelves.
Bakers reported deliveries to
stores were off 10 to 40 per cent
but grocers said the cut amounted
to 50 per cent. To worsen the sit
uation, consumer purchases of bread
were up 10 per cent per customer.
One market reported a woman
purchased 10 loaves but in most
markets purchases were limited to
one loaf per customer.
A market spokesman said a more
even distribution of supplies would
be achieved toward the end of the
week when pan it: buying decreases.
However, supplies were expected to
remain about 50 per cent below nor
mal.
