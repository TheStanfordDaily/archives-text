Men of Encina invite you to "keep
your date awake" at their informal
dance, "Coffee Time," after the
Spring Show Saturday eve.
An orchestra, featuring a former
member of Count Basie's outfit, will
provide the music.
Java will be plentiful for all fugi
tives from the sandman, and food is
also promised for the more carniv

publicity chairman.
