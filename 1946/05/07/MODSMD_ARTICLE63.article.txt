# Opinions Differ On New Bawlout
## 
### 
Reaction to the spring quarter's
"Directory of Officers and Stu
dents," a bawlout that "no longer
lives up to its name," is varied
among both faculty and students.
Some Stanford students are
pleased that their grade-point av
erages, the absence of which is an
innovation in this quarter's direc
tory, will no longer be available to
the scrutiny of all.
But there are at least two schools
of thought which favor having the
"bawlout" bawl but:
1. Those who don't know how
to compute the averages. (A:
plus two points per unit: li: plus
one: C: zero; D: minus one; F:
minus two. Example: B's in 10
units, C in five units equals 15
plus 10.)
2. Faculty and other groups
who like to observe the student's
past accomplishments.
Return of grade-point averages to
the directory in future editions is
still undetermined, according to
John M. Stalnaker, dean of stu
dents. They were omitted from this
edition due to the huge influx of
new students this quarter, requir
ing more office work to compile the
averages than time before publi
cation permitted.
The directories are now on sale
at 26 cents in the cashier's office
on the second floor of the Admin
istration Building.
