# Britain to Recall Troops from Java
## 
### 
BATAVIA, May (i (UP).â€”Great
Britain plans to withdraw all Brit
ish and Indian troops from Java
without awaiting an agreement be
tween the Netherlands East Indies
government and rebels in order to
fore early action, an authoritative
informant asserted tonight.
If the move failed to get results,
the informant said, Australia, as the
principal Pacific United Nations
nation, was expected to put the
problem before the Security Coun
cil in behalf of the British Empire.
If Australia took such action, it
was said, she probably would urge
an American - British - Australian -
Netherlands trusteeship as a solu
tion of the Indonesian problem.
