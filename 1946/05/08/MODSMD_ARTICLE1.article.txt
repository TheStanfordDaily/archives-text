Between scenes, songs will be of
fered by a Navy trio, John Haynes,
Fred Simmons, and Don Hoetettlcr.
Olios including Rena Jean Black

Another," with Bill Edlund and

TRAGIC PLOT
The plot of 'East Lynne," or
"How Far Can a Good Girl Go?"
tells the story of a young bride who
becomes convinced through the
persuasions of the villain that her
husband is untrue. She elopes with
the villain, who leaves her and her
illegitimate child (ofT-stage, that is)
to fend alone in the cruel world for
themselves. The heroin? subse
