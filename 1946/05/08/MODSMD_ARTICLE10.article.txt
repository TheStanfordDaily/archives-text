casting division of the U.S. State
Department, Rev. Lynn T. While,
San Ansclmo Theological School,
and Dr. Francis E. Herrick, chair
man of Mills College's History De
partment the Farm team will seek
to revenge two consecutive losses
and tie the score in the over half a
century old contest at 2G-2G.
Stanford's Wally McCall is a sen
ior in Law School and an expe
rienced varsity debater. In his fust
fight for the Farm he helped cap
ture top honors at the Denver tour
ney last winter, and, together with
Pat Carson, beat the University of
Chicago and tied USC, the West's
most powerful forensic squad.
CAME FROM PORTLAND
He was student body president
at Grant High School, Portland, did
his lower division work at Willam
ette University, and came to Stan
ford after his discharge from the
Army.
Miss Newton is an anomaly: she
is one of the rare debaters major
ing not in law but in physics. A
junior, she has been active in De
bute Society for three years, was
formerly debate manager, and
achieved the honor of making the
Joffre team in her freshman year.
She is the only squad member with
previous Joffre experience.
Pre-legal sophomore Steeges made
the top in his first collegiate varsity
appearance. He was high ranking
man in last month's Pacific Foren
sic League discussion-debate. Steege
was student body president and
champion debater at Lowell High in
San Francisco.
CAL FAVORED
Although Cal is slight favorite be
cause of last year's excellent per
formance by Miss Olson, Ihe Farm
is putting up a strong team hopeful
of triumphing over the Blue and
Gold. Miss Newton, McCall, and
Steege have been going through
daily workouts with Coach Leland
T. Chapin.
When the squads of the two
schools start their battle tonight
they will only have known the
question for an hour, although they
are familiar with the general topic:
"The Role of France in the World
Today."
From this the specific question
has been chosen by Frederick L.
Sshuman, well known political sci
ence professor at Williams College,
and Dr. Monroe Deutsch, UC's vice
president, who will also preside at
the contest.
JOFFRE DEBATE FAMOUS
The Jolfre has become famous be
yond the bounds of Stanford-Cal
rivalry. It has attracted nation
wide attention by its demands on
participants to exceed ordinary de
bate techniques. It has had little
of the normal talk on "status quo,"
"burden of proof," and "our plan
and their plan."
"It has demanded the capacity to
deal with abstractions, with trends
of thought and intellectual stirrings
in the world," says J. Gordon Emer
son, associate professor of Speech
and Drama and former debate coach
who has led many Indian teams to
victory.
EXPERTS NEEDED
Competitors for the Medaille
Joffre must not only be able to han
dle a difficult subject, but must be
experts at "thinking on their feet."
They have little time to study the
specific question; instead they must
apply to it a vast fund of material
at very short notice.
Named after the hero of the
Maine, the Joffre cements Francos-
American relations by sustaining
interest in French problems and
giving contestants and listeners a
better understanding of them.

CAL FAVORED
Although Cal is slight favorite be
cause of last year's excellent per
formance by Miss Olson, Ihe Farm
is putting up a strong team hopeful
of triumphing over the Blue and
Gold. Miss Newton, McCall, and
Steege have been going through
daily workouts with Coach Leland
T. Chapin.
When the squads of the two
schools start their battle tonight
they will only have known the
question for an hour, although they
are familiar with the general topic:
"The Role of France in the World
Today."
From this the specific question
has been chosen by Frederick L.
Sshuman, well known political sci
ence professor at Williams College,
and Dr. Monroe Deutsch, UC's vice
president, who will also preside at
the contest.
JOFFRE DEBATE FAMOUS
The Jolfre has become famous be
yond the bounds of Stanford-Cal
rivalry. It has attracted nation
wide attention by its demands on
participants to exceed ordinary de
bate techniques. It has had little
of the normal talk on "status quo,"
"burden of proof," and "our plan
and their plan."
"It has demanded the capacity to
deal with abstractions, with trends
of thought and intellectual stirrings
in the world," says J. Gordon Emer
son, associate professor of Speech
and Drama and former debate coach
who has led many Indian teams to
victory.
EXPERTS NEEDED
Competitors for the Medaille
Joffre must not only be able to han
dle a difficult subject, but must be
experts at "thinking on their feet."
They have little time to study the
specific question; instead they must
apply to it a vast fund of material
at very short notice.
Named after the hero of the
Maine, the Joffre cements Francos-
American relations by sustaining
interest in French problems and
giving contestants and listeners a
better understanding of them.
Verbal sparks will fly tonight
when Stanford and the University
of California clash in the annual
Big Debats.
Out of the tangle of wits and
