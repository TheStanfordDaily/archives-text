## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 7 (UP).—
Hope for a speedy end of the soft
coal strike went glimmering tonight
when UMW President John L.
Lewis reaffirmed union demands
! that have deadlocked negotiations
; since mid-March. Lewis denied
receipt of a new settlement plan
j from the government.
Lewis' unequivocal stand was
announced at the close of a meet
! ing of the union's 250-man policy
committee at which he apparently
; >had won the solid backing of the
miners' rank-and-file representa
| tives.
His action, in effect, threw the
whole coal crisis into the hands of
President Truman or Congress.
Apart, from direct and forceful
government intervention, there
| seemed no likelihood of reopening
i the mines in time to prevent a gen
; oral industrial collapse amounting
| to a national disaster,
j Spokesmen for the union said
| they were standing pat on all their
; original demands, including the
hotly-debated claim for a royally
on all coal production to finance a
miners' welfare fund.

DETROIT, May 7 (UP).-Ford j
Motor Company announced tonight I
that the impact of the coal strike
would force a .shutdown of virtually
the entire Ford system tomorrow
night for an indefinite period, idling
110,000 workers.
Ford had reached a production
peak of 2,885 cars and trucks, M. L.
Bricker, vice-president in charge
of manufacturing, said in announc
ing the shutdown.
"After months of the most costly
kind of effort we have reached the
end of our ability to build cars and
trucks at even the limited rate now j
prevailing," the Ford production
chief said.
Reports that the auto industry's i
major producers would soon feci j
the pinch of the soft coal strike on
steel, the industry's basic compo- j
nent, had been circulating for the '
past ten days, but all estimates had !
ben that production would continue 1
at least another 15 to 30 days.
"Virtually all operations will be |
suspended indefinitely Wednesday i
night due to the coal strike, a short- |
age of parts and the railroad trans
portation tie-up," Bricker an
nounced.
He blamed strikes at suppliers as |
one of the main causes of the shut- j
down, asserting that "42 of our im
portant suppliers now are on j
strike."
