arming of merchant ships, against
lend-lease, against direct appropri
ation in the Patman Housing Bill;
and why Anderson voted for
amendments which in our opinion
crippled the OPA Bill?
"We would also like to have a
| number of other issues cleared up."
GROUPS WANT DEBATE
The N.V.A.C.. composed of both
; Republican and Democratic voters,
has stated that its purpose is to
I "clarify the political situation on
' campus" and that therefore it is in
full favor of an assembly to discuss
the issues.
McLeod requested that some "ap
propriate organization on campus
step forward to sponsor this de
■ bate."
"We will wive them our full co
operation," he said.
TO PRESENT PETITION
Meanwhile, the petition com-
J plaining that two news stories in

ganization was ready to meet them "at any time and at any place."
CAMPAIGN ISSUES
The chairman of the McDonald group, Malrolm McLeod, in announcing the challenge said

♦■that the purpose of the debate
! would be to dicuss "the issues in
j volvcd in the campaign."
I Kessler claimed that he wel
comed the chance to bring the ar
gument out in the open. He slated
that the impression created that
i veterans as a whole were backing
Charles McDonald should be eor
j rectcd.
QUESTION POLICY
In a prepared statement for the
; press, McLeod said:
"As citizens, we are interested in
better government and efficient
representation. Therefore we would
like to know what the votes on the
following issues mean:
"Why Anderson voted against the
arming of merchant ships, against
lend-lease, against direct appropri
ation in the Patman Housing Bill;
and why Anderson voted for
amendments which in our opinion
crippled the OPA Bill?
"We would also like to have a
| number of other issues cleared up."
GROUPS WANT DEBATE
The N.V.A.C.. composed of both
; Republican and Democratic voters,
has stated that its purpose is to
I "clarify the political situation on
' campus" and that therefore it is in
full favor of an assembly to discuss
the issues.
McLeod requested that some "ap
propriate organization on campus
step forward to sponsor this de
■ bate."
"We will wive them our full co
operation," he said.
