WASHINGTON, May 7 (UP). -
Secretary of Agriculture Clinton P. I
Anderson, conceding that hi.s agen- !
"y\s report on grain exports was j
"somewhat discouraging," said to
night that it will be extremely dif
ficult for the United States to live i
up to its food promises to famine ;
countries.
He told a news conference after j
a meeting of the combined British-
American - Canadian Food Board
that the United Nations Relief and
Rehabilitation Administration will
receive only 45)1,000 tons of grain in (
May as compared to its original re- j
quest for 700,000 tons.
UNRRA Director Fiorello H. La-
Ciuardia, wlio took UNRRA's case
before the board, said be felt the i
allocation was fair in view of the j
supply situation. But, he said, it |
means that UNRRA will "have to !
slice the bread thinner."
