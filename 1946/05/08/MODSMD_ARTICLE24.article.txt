We see by The Daily that President T tu
rn ,n has asked Congress "to authorize a
.'.weeping program ot inter-American mili
tary collaboration under which the com
bined strength of the new world would be
welded into a unified force trained and
armed by the United States."
Fine and dandy. That would really put
loeth into the Monroe Doctrine.
BUT, we detect a couple of small strings
attached to this little plan which gives it a
rather unpleasant fragrance:
1. From the Pan-American standpoint, we
can't quite see that phrase, "trained and
armed by the United States." With our Latin
neighbors already suffering from an inferior
ity complex because of the domination of
their big brother, this "trained and armed"
business might lead to political, military, and
economic control of our southern friends.
Imperialism, you say? Maybe not now, but
could be—too easily.
2. —The other catch phrase is "combined
strength of the new world welded into a uni
fied force . . . stretching from the Arctic to
the Antarctic, using standardized land, sea
and air weapons supplied from the United
States' vast arsenals."
So the Western Hemisphere is to be turned
into an armed camp. Why? To protect what

we've got, you say. Safeguard from aggres
sion. Fine.
But what have we got to protect? More
than we need materially, bloated with and
gloating over our exploitation of our share
of the world's wealth as we are now.
What we do need to protect is the peace,
and our friendly relations with extra-hemi
spherical nations, which are now in a sad
state of disrepair. Certainly, lining our At
lantic and Pacific coastlines with gui>s from
the "Arctic to the Antarctic" isn't going to
make other nations think we're friendly.
Maybe we're playing safe by arming in
the event of another war. But it seems to us
that the surest way to get another war is to
arm "against aggression."
And it seems to us that the surest way to
spike the work of the United Nations would
be to adopt President Truman's suggestion.
Regional cooperation within the U.N. is wel
comed and unusual today, but an armed re
gional guard outside the U.N. is another
matter which deliberately repudiates the
princples and ideals for which the United
Nations are working.
If we won't trust and work with countries
across the seas, how can they be expected to
trust and work with us? We may not want
another war, but sure as shooting, we're
asking for it.--M.S.
