# Victory: Part II
## 
### 
Once around the seasons and here we are
back at May 8, first anniversary of V-E Day. •
We've plenty to remember about that day
. . . the fatigued acknowledgment of victory
after nine days of keen expectancy . . . re
newed confidence, a sense of relief . . . and
the feeling that a nation's dreams of peace
weie about to come true.
So here we are again, reading this year's
international news which seethes with dis
trust, bitterness, and blatant nationalism.
What has happened to our dream? Where
went the uncompromising determination for
peace, the peace that come hell or high water
would not, this time, fail?
During the war, England, Russia, and the
United States were "in this thing together."
At its end, as if at a signal, the nations in
volved took off on their separate roads for
separate peaces.
The United States blocked its conscience
against the facts reiterated time and again
from abroad—that the people of Europe and
Asia were starving. Today we are getting
under way a food conservation campaign
already 400,000 tons behind its wheat pledge

to the UNRRA.
President Truman Monday proposed a stiff
regional armament program which would be
aimed at protection against . . . what? . . . the
rest of the world? Moscow's military might
paraded through its streets last week to the
tune of strong anti-American propaganda.
Britain and Russia have maintained "protec
tionist" stands over small nations that writhed
in protest. The history of our postwar, not
yet a year old, would cover many books on
international intrigue, intolerance, and inepti
tude.
A truism we know takes care of the whole
situation. It states that wars come in two
parts: The fighting on world battlefronts and
disposition afterward of the territories won.
On the anniversary of V-E Day no one will
deny his gladness that part number one is,
for World War 11, completed. But we'll be
going a long way toward the third war if we
assume that part number two has even been
approximated in satisfactory terms. The road
to peace is a rough one, but if we trip and
fall, we must —in dedication to VE Day—get
up and walk again.—B.M.V.
