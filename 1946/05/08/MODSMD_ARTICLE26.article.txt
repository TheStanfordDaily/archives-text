# It Concerns Us

### RALPH HOVIS OUR FOREIGN POLICY TOWARD SPAIN 
Is or is not the Franco regime in Spain a menace
to the peace and security of the world? This ques
uon is on the agenda of the United Nations Security
Council and must be answered before the Spanish
problem can be permanently solved. In regard to
the answer there is a split in the ranks of the
Council members.
One school of thought—championed by Britain
and the U.S. and spearheaded by Holland—believes
that the Franco regime and its activities are mat
ters concerning only the Spanish people.
The other school of thought supported by Po
land, Russia, France, and Mexico—reminds us
that Spain is one of the two last strongholds of
fascism existing in the world today and because
of it. international peace and security are threat
ened and political hiul economic sanctions should
lie imposed against Spain.
Dr. E. N. Van Kleffens, trigger man for the An
glo-American-Dutch faction, declares that Spain
"has no armed forces and it would be an insult to
the UN to say that by propaganda they have the
power to resuscitate the Nazi doctrine as a living
political force." He believes that "so long as Franco
docs not really threaten international security the
question whether Spain wants to keep the regime is
a matter for Spain and Spain only."
Viewing the Franco regime as an anomaly in a
world where anti-Fascist powers predominate, the
Polish-Russian school of thought presents more co
gent reasons than the Anglo-American group.
Dr. Oscar Lange, Polish delegate to the Council,
contends that the Franco regime has been put into
power "with the support of Fascist Italy and Nazi
Germany against the will of the Spanish people
who resisted Franco and the Axis heroically for
almost three years." The Russians interpret the
Anglo-American policy of maintaining that the
Spanish people will rid themselves of General
Franco as being "either self-delusion or hypocrisy
in view of the fact that the Spanish people are un
armed, while General Franco holds them down
with concentrated, heavily armed remnants of fas
cism and naziism."
Before we consider American policy of the
present we should review our policy of the past
few years. From 194(1 to the summer of 1944
American diplomacy in Spain vigorously sup
ported the attainment of allied military objec
tives. It attempted to prevent Spain from enter
ing the war and to create in (he Spanish leaders
a realization of economic dependency on the al
lied world. It wished to weaken Axis influence

and strengthen friendly elements within the
Spanish government.
American distaste for the Falange and all it rep
resents, has never been concealed and the advan
tages secured in Spain were not regarded as either
concessions or factors entitling Franco's regime to
gratitude of reciprocity.
In Spain, American wits and American dollars
were matched against a clever Germany which held
the advantage of operating on a friendly territory*
American interests brought about a reorientation
in Spanish policy which favored and helped the
objectives set up by allied military leaders.
The liberation of France and the resulting sever
ance of direct contact between Spain and Germany
finally marked the end of active diplomatic war
fare in Spain.
The present policy of the U.S. is a refusal to go
beyond their existing position, that Franco is un
pleasant, and that Spain may not join the UN until
Franco finds a new and quite different government
for Spain. Reasons backing this seemingly unten
able stand are that strong measures taken now
would increase the chances of civil war, that a
civil war would mean an American military expe
dition, and that at the present time we have no
taste for such action. In the Council voted to apply
sanctions the British maintain that the flow of food
stuffs from Spain to Britain would be cut off and
that would mean shorter rations, a condition it dis
likes more than it dislikes Franco himself.
Sumner Welles leads the opposition in its at
tack on this policy. He claims the announcement
of lack of sympathy with Franco's government
stems from an agreement excluding the Soviet
Union, that the agreement provides no way
through which the Spanish People can he as
sured that the downfall of Franco will not renew
a civil war, and he further points out (hat the
Americans completely disregard the fact that
there exists a Republican government of Spain
in exile and that other smaller European govern
ments are vitally interested in the problem.
Regardless of coming referendums in Spain
which might justify acceptance of the Franco re
gime—assuming Franco wins the referendum—the
underlying issue is the presence of fascism. During
the war we fought against it and after the war we
dropped our wrath against it. We shifted to a fear
of "Communist-dominated governments."
Does it seem that, by our policy today of allow
ing Franco to hang on, we are encouraging fascism
and looking the other way?

Regardless of coming referendums in Spain

Monday, May IIL 194(>: Factions in the U.S. Con

Is or is not the Franco regime in Spain a menace
to the peace and security of the world? This ques
uon is on the agenda of the United Nations Security
Council and must be answered before the Spanish
problem can be permanently solved. In regard to
the answer there is a split in the ranks of the
Council members.
One school of thought—championed by Britain
and the U.S. and spearheaded by Holland—believes
that the Franco regime and its activities are mat
ters concerning only the Spanish people.
The other school of thought supported by Po
land, Russia, France, and Mexico—reminds us
that Spain is one of the two last strongholds of
fascism existing in the world today and because
of it. international peace and security are threat
ened and political hiul economic sanctions should
lie imposed against Spain.
Dr. E. N. Van Kleffens, trigger man for the An
glo-American-Dutch faction, declares that Spain
"has no armed forces and it would be an insult to
the UN to say that by propaganda they have the
power to resuscitate the Nazi doctrine as a living
political force." He believes that "so long as Franco
docs not really threaten international security the
question whether Spain wants to keep the regime is
a matter for Spain and Spain only."
Viewing the Franco regime as an anomaly in a
world where anti-Fascist powers predominate, the
Polish-Russian school of thought presents more co
gent reasons than the Anglo-American group.
Dr. Oscar Lange, Polish delegate to the Council,
contends that the Franco regime has been put into
power "with the support of Fascist Italy and Nazi
Germany against the will of the Spanish people
who resisted Franco and the Axis heroically for
almost three years." The Russians interpret the
Anglo-American policy of maintaining that the
Spanish people will rid themselves of General
Franco as being "either self-delusion or hypocrisy
in view of the fact that the Spanish people are un
armed, while General Franco holds them down
with concentrated, heavily armed remnants of fas
cism and naziism."
Before we consider American policy of the
present we should review our policy of the past
few years. From 194(1 to the summer of 1944
American diplomacy in Spain vigorously sup
ported the attainment of allied military objec
tives. It attempted to prevent Spain from enter
ing the war and to create in (he Spanish leaders
a realization of economic dependency on the al
lied world. It wished to weaken Axis influence

and strengthen friendly elements within the
Spanish government.
American distaste for the Falange and all it rep
resents, has never been concealed and the advan
tages secured in Spain were not regarded as either
concessions or factors entitling Franco's regime to
gratitude of reciprocity.
In Spain, American wits and American dollars
were matched against a clever Germany which held
the advantage of operating on a friendly territory*
American interests brought about a reorientation
in Spanish policy which favored and helped the
objectives set up by allied military leaders.
The liberation of France and the resulting sever
ance of direct contact between Spain and Germany
finally marked the end of active diplomatic war
fare in Spain.
The present policy of the U.S. is a refusal to go
beyond their existing position, that Franco is un
pleasant, and that Spain may not join the UN until
Franco finds a new and quite different government
for Spain. Reasons backing this seemingly unten
able stand are that strong measures taken now
would increase the chances of civil war, that a
civil war would mean an American military expe
dition, and that at the present time we have no
taste for such action. In the Council voted to apply
sanctions the British maintain that the flow of food
stuffs from Spain to Britain would be cut off and
that would mean shorter rations, a condition it dis
likes more than it dislikes Franco himself.
Sumner Welles leads the opposition in its at
tack on this policy. He claims the announcement
of lack of sympathy with Franco's government
stems from an agreement excluding the Soviet
Union, that the agreement provides no way
through which the Spanish People can he as
sured that the downfall of Franco will not renew
a civil war, and he further points out (hat the
Americans completely disregard the fact that
there exists a Republican government of Spain

would increase the chances of civil war, that a
civil war would mean an American military expe
dition, and that at the present time we have no
taste for such action. In the Council voted to apply
sanctions the British maintain that the flow of food
stuffs from Spain to Britain would be cut off and
that would mean shorter rations, a condition it dis
likes more than it dislikes Franco himself.
Sumner Welles leads the opposition in its at
tack on this policy. He claims the announcement
of lack of sympathy with Franco's government
stems from an agreement excluding the Soviet
Union, that the agreement provides no way
through which the Spanish People can he as
sured that the downfall of Franco will not renew
a civil war, and he further points out (hat the
Americans completely disregard the fact that
there exists a Republican government of Spain
in exile and that other smaller European govern
ments are vitally interested in the problem.
Regardless of coming referendums in Spain
which might justify acceptance of the Franco re
gime—assuming Franco wins the referendum—the
underlying issue is the presence of fascism. During
the war we fought against it and after the war we
dropped our wrath against it. We shifted to a fear
of "Communist-dominated governments."
Does it seem that, by our policy today of allow
ing Franco to hang on, we are encouraging fascism
and looking the other way?

Is or is not the Franco regime in Spain a menace
to the peace and security of the world? This ques
uon is on the agenda of the United Nations Security
Council and must be answered before the Spanish
problem can be permanently solved. In regard to
the answer there is a split in the ranks of the
Council members.
One school of thought—championed by Britain
and the U.S. and spearheaded by Holland—believes
that the Franco regime and its activities are mat
ters concerning only the Spanish people.
The other school of thought supported by Po
land, Russia, France, and Mexico—reminds us
that Spain is one of the two last strongholds of
fascism existing in the world today and because
of it. international peace and security are threat
ened and political hiul economic sanctions should
lie imposed against Spain.
Dr. E. N. Van Kleffens, trigger man for the An
glo-American-Dutch faction, declares that Spain
"has no armed forces and it would be an insult to
the UN to say that by propaganda they have the
power to resuscitate the Nazi doctrine as a living
political force." He believes that "so long as Franco
docs not really threaten international security the
question whether Spain wants to keep the regime is
a matter for Spain and Spain only."
Viewing the Franco regime as an anomaly in a
world where anti-Fascist powers predominate, the
Polish-Russian school of thought presents more co
gent reasons than the Anglo-American group.
Dr. Oscar Lange, Polish delegate to the Council,
contends that the Franco regime has been put into
power "with the support of Fascist Italy and Nazi
Germany against the will of the Spanish people
who resisted Franco and the Axis heroically for
almost three years." The Russians interpret the
Anglo-American policy of maintaining that the
Spanish people will rid themselves of General
Franco as being "either self-delusion or hypocrisy
in view of the fact that the Spanish people are un
armed, while General Franco holds them down
with concentrated, heavily armed remnants of fas
cism and naziism."
Before we consider American policy of the
present we should review our policy of the past
few years. From 194(1 to the summer of 1944
American diplomacy in Spain vigorously sup
ported the attainment of allied military objec
tives. It attempted to prevent Spain from enter
ing the war and to create in (he Spanish leaders
a realization of economic dependency on the al
lied world. It wished to weaken Axis influence

and strengthen friendly elements within the
Spanish government.
American distaste for the Falange and all it rep
resents, has never been concealed and the advan
tages secured in Spain were not regarded as either
concessions or factors entitling Franco's regime to
gratitude of reciprocity.
In Spain, American wits and American dollars
were matched against a clever Germany which held
the advantage of operating on a friendly territory*
American interests brought about a reorientation
in Spanish policy which favored and helped the
objectives set up by allied military leaders.
The liberation of France and the resulting sever
ance of direct contact between Spain and Germany
finally marked the end of active diplomatic war
fare in Spain.
The present policy of the U.S. is a refusal to go
beyond their existing position, that Franco is un
pleasant, and that Spain may not join the UN until
Franco finds a new and quite different government
for Spain. Reasons backing this seemingly unten
able stand are that strong measures taken now
would increase the chances of civil war, that a
civil war would mean an American military expe
dition, and that at the present time we have no
taste for such action. In the Council voted to apply
sanctions the British maintain that the flow of food
stuffs from Spain to Britain would be cut off and
that would mean shorter rations, a condition it dis
likes more than it dislikes Franco himself.
