no legal right to spend money on !
their campaigns, any number of
posters may he made and regular
stump political speeches may be j
made from hall to hall and house j
to house, all within the law.
ROW VOTE DELAYED
The majority opinion of men on
the Row now seems to be that the !
election of the four area represen- |
tatives on Excom should be de
layed till next fall, fn all proba
bility the men who hold those po
sitions now will be held until re
placed. But all other elective posi- |
lions will be filled at the end of
this month.
Nominations for all student body |
positions will be open on May IG, j
and the blanks must be signed by
15 registered students and returned I
to the nomination box the next day. j
All nominations must be in by this j
time, and declinations of candidacy ,
will be filed May 20.
A.S.S.U. PRESIDENCY
The student body presidency, now I
filled by Bob Kennedy, will be the
most important single position filled, j
Under the new constitution the |
president has even more power than j
before. Traditionally a man, he j
will be chairman of Excom, and an j
ex-officio member, with vote, of all
boards and committees established |
under Excom. He is also the
school's representative in campus 1
affairs and to the world at large. J
Needless to say that the man picked j
to fill this position must be highly j
versatile and able.

series of articles on the new con- !
stitution and its importance to
the student body in connection
with the coming A.S.S.U. elec
tions.)
