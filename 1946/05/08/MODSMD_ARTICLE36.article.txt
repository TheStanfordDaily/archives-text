Eddie Twiggs' classy golf squad
finally gets a chance to show their
prowess this weekend, when they
travel south to meet U.C.L.A. and
U.S.C. This venture was slated for
last week, but the Trojans phoned
and said they "weren't ready."
But after giving it second thought,
they probably decided that it would
be better to go through with the
scheduled matches than to be rap
ped for "chintzing" out.
Neither school in the southland
will offer any formidable opposition
to the Cardinal men of the fairway.
The Bruins were downed last week
by S.C., and the scores that Troy
posted can be beat by the locals
rather handily.

Cinderpath doings draw the
headlines for weekend sports activ
ities on the campus, with U.C.L.A.
and Stanford competing in a dual
meet. . . . Judging against common
opponents, U.C.L.A. rates the favor
ite, by virtue of their totaling 35
points against U.S.C. . . . Stanford
was only able to take 28. . . . The
sports staff has been comparing
times of the two teams, and will
print their prediction soon. . . . We
were only off about five points in
the Trojan avalanche.

Trojan baseballers put in an ap
pearance Friday and Saturday in
conference games against Stanford.
. . . Leading the league with six
victories and no defeats, the Tro
jans are expected to down Harry

Wolter's horsehiders in easy fash
ion.

THE QUOTE DEPARTMENT:
From Gamage in the Palo Alto
Times: 'Axe, Axe, who's got the
Axe? Several students who did a
little sleuthing at Berkeley last
week report that the Axe has been
making some personal appearances
at parties in that vicinity. . . . Ac
cording to Farm sleuths several
prominent Bear football players
were involved in the "borrowing" of
the famed trophy."
—Hmmmm, we wonder who Walt
means. . . A glance at the Cal ros
ter finds such names as Ted Ken
field, Wendell Beard, Bill Diffen
baugh, Chuck Gilkey, and Irv
Uteritz.
