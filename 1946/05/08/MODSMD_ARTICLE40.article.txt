# Amphibs Lead Naval Intras
## 
### 
Continuance of play in the Navy
intramural league last week found
the untested Amphibs led by Roy
Gaskin and pitcher Doug Crawford
battering the highly touted Cruisers
nine into defeat 20-18 in a veritable
slugfest.
Ir, another baseball tiff, the Am
phibs turned back the Tenders to
maintain their perfect average and
establish themselves as a real threat
for the championship.
Play continues this week with the
potent Halsey nine meeting the
equally strong N.A.S. team in an
encounter yesterday. Both teams
will be fighting for a berth in the
finals. Other encounters of the
volleyball, with the Amphibs meet
ing Tenders.
