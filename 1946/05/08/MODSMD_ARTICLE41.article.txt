# Grid Practice At Mid-Point
## 
### 
Spring football practice for the
Stanford varsity has reached its
mid-point this week. Coach Marchie
Schwartz announced yestel'day that
there would be no more practice
sessions this week, but that two
Monday would round out the work
outs.
An intra-squad scrimmage a week
from Friday will finish the session.
The big news this week is the
move of Jim "Finny" Cox from
center back to his favorite tackle
spot. This moves Dorsey Kindler, a
rangy 6-ft. 3-in. 200-pounder who
has played ball at the University of
Nebraska, into contention at the
pivot position. Dick Flatland, a
veteran of the '42 frosh squad, will
also be in the running for this spot.
VARNERS LONG BOOTS
Harry Varner, husky tackle, re
vealed a surprising talent at yes
terday's practice when he boomed
punt after punt out past the 50-
yard mark. Aubrey Devine is show
ing an increasing aptitude for the
quarterback spot, hitting longer
and longer passes every day.
Michael "Micky" Titus, a com
pact 190-pound right half and a
former All - C.I.F. fullback from
Beverly Hills high, has shown up
particularly well in late practices.
Brings back memories of the great
Hugh Gallerneau.
JUST WAIT AND SEE
The same quiet attitude of wait
and see seems to prevail on the
practice field. And from the mate
rial at hand there seems to be no
doubt that Stanford "T" will be
brewed in the usual manner next
fall.
