# Intramural Chi Psi Win Cinches Title
## 
### 
Breezing through to their fifth
consecutive Softball victory, the Chi
Psi's put the League I champion
ship in their hip pocket yesterday
by defeating the Encina Cellar, 8-15.
All other scheduled games were
postponed.
In notching number five, the frat
men survived a desperate Encina
late-inning rally which narowed the
margin to "hailing distance." But
the six-run Chi Psi splurge in the
first inning proved to be sufficient
to decide the fray.
Trailing by three runs as the
contest entered the last stanza, En
cina parlayed a double, an infield
single, and a long fly ball to score a
run and thi-eaten the champs. But
with the potential tying run at the
plate, a called third strike settled
the contest.
Meanwhile the Legal Eagles
found themselves without an op
ponent as the Buchanan Hall entry
failed to appear. And neither party
in the scheduled Phi Psi-Phi Delta
Theta battle showed up.
