# U.S. Has Caste System---Stegner
## 
### 
Wallace Stegner addressed his
Tuesday Series audience last night
as the "in" group in a caste-ridden
society. In what purports to be a
democratic government a rigid
caste system similar to India's ex
ists.
"We" are the "in group living
in the "in" section of the "in"
country of the world. We are the
luckiest people in the world.
Excluded from the "we" group
in discussing the problem of unac
cepted racial minorities are 17,000
"untouchables" and from 25 to 30
million Americans subject to some
kind of discriminations because of
race, religion, or culture differences,
the Stanford English professor said.
Mr. Stegner said that there is
no real way for "us" to feel the
lack of "self-respect" that an ex
cluded person is made to feel. A
Chinese, the most lucky of the
Orientals, does well until he is
out of school. Then he, like the
Filipino, the Japanese, the Mexi
can, and especially the Negro,
finds he cannot live where he
chooses, develop his business or
profession on an equal basis with
a Caucasian, nor is he accorded
equal treatment by the law.
The best way to beat the enemy
of separation, Mr. Stegner proposed,
is to tear down the walls. To share
not only education, but also jobs,
lights before the law .and, above
all. housing areas. He cited an in
cident at Portola Heights in San
Francisco. When in accord with a
housing covenant some Filipino
families were ordered to leave a
neighborhood by a local "booster
club," a neighborhood group de
manded that the restriction clause
be struck out, and it was. No court
can legally uphold such a clause
because it would violate the 14th
Amendment, Mr. Stegner said.
Letting the unaccepted in can
he done by no single way. A
hundred thousand acts must go
into changing our attitude. The
author of "One Nation" cautioned

that we must look for suspicion j
and hostility. We must not give
charity, hut justice. There can be !
no stooping from humanity to
humanity. We can reach out and
in learning respect for those mi
norities we can respect ourselves,
he concluded.â€”Pinkerton
