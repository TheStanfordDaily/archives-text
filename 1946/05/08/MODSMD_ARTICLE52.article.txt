# "Vacuum Tube' Talk Tonight
## 
### 
Mr. Hubert Eaves, research engi
neer of Eitel-McCullough, Inc., will
speak on "Vacuum Tube Manufac
turing Technique" tonight at 7:30 in
the Cubberley Auditorium.
Mr. Eaves will discuss the proc
esses and methods that have been
developed to make possible the
construction of high-power trans
mitting tubes that can operate ef
fectively from 100 to 3,000 mega
cycles. He will speak about glass
to-metal seals and also about vari
ous design features that have been
designed in order to make tubes
more a part of the circuit than had
been the case previously.
Mr. Eaves will illustrate his talk
with slides and a color film. The
program is being presented by the
Stanford Joint Branch of the Amer
ican Institute of Electrical Engi
neers and the Institute of Radio En
gineers. All engineering faculty and
students are invited to attend.
