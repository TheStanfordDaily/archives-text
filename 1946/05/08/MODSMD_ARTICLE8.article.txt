'Maps next," screamed Daily
headlines a year ago this morning,
and a waiting campus, that had
arisen at 6 a.m. to hear President
Truman tell the world that the Na
zis were finished, attended classes
normally, with a quiet happiness.
Memorial Church was packed for
the 30-minute thanksgiving service,
during which Dr. Tresidder spoke,
offering thanks lhat part of the job
was over.
The wild exuberance character-*
izing crowds in Times Square was
noticeably absent at Stanford; per
haps it was the proximity to the
Pacific area and the realization that
"Japs next" meant a long pull.
The excitement displayed at the
Water Carnival the previous Sat
urday, when a false armistice was
announced over the loudspeakers to
swimmers in the lake had calmed

| by Tuesday morning, and for Stan
ford V-E Day was safe and sane.
,At noon, simultaneously with other
' carillonneurs throughout the coun
try, James R. Lawson played a Vic
tory rhapsody and the national an
thems of United States, Great Brit
| ain and Russia.
