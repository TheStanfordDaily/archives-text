# Byrnes Urges Peace Meet
## Opposition by Molotov Spoils Big Four Accord 
### 
PARIS, May 8 (UP). â€”Secretary
I of State James F. Byrnes, fighting
to save the Big Four foreign min
isterial conference from collapse,
| pleaded today for a 21-nation peace
I meeting beginning June 15 to write
i treaties for Axis satellites. But he
ran into stone wall Russian oppo-
I sition and it was feared the confer
j ence might adjourn this weekend
in failure.
"Today is V-E Day and I cannot
think of any better way of celebrat
! in? it than announcing to the world
that a peace conference of all na
tions will open in Paris June 15,"
Byrnes told the foreign ministers.
BRITISH, FRENCH SUPPORT
British Foreign Secretary Ernest
Bevin and French Foreign Minister
j Georges Bidault supported Byrnes.

Molotov objected at once. The Big
Four must write the treaties first,
he insisted, and leave it to the other
; 17 nations who took an active part
' in the war to make recommenda
tions and approve the drafts.
There was believed to be a chance
that Molotov was playing for time
so he could consult his government.
Hcncc the possibility remained, al
though it seemed remote, that Mos
cow might reverse Molotov's atti
tude.
DISARMAMENT TREATY
Both Russia and France had prc
viously objected to Byrnes' propo-
I sal for a 25-ycar disarmamcnt-cn
| forccment treaty for Gel-many. At
tempts to write a peace treaty for
i Italy had failed completely because
j of the gulf between Russian de
! sires and those of the Western Al-
I lies.
Things were going as usual today
when Byrnes iroke in with his dra
matic plea for real action on trea
ties. He emphasized that the Big
Four agreed in Moscow that the
' posid May 1 poacc conference would
| be a real one, empowered to take
| decisions, and not merely a rubbcr
' stamp meeting to approve drafts by
1 the Big Four.
