# Orchesis Prepares Spring Concert
## 
### 
Four approaches to modern dance
composition have been employed by
19 Orchesis members and appren
tices in preparing numbers for the
Orchesis Annual Spring Dancc
Concert, to be given next Tuesday
in the Memorial Auditorium at 7:30.
As outlined by Mrs. Miriam Lid
ster, director, students have inter
preted their ideas into studies based
on (1) music, the mood and style of
music as a means of direct inter
pretation for choreography, (2) the
spoken word, (3) a musical form,
and (4) a theme or idea developed
completely in true dancc movement
and then completed for stage pres
entation by the addition of original
music or percussive accompani
ment.
Five folk songs, recorded by Burl
Ives (better known as the Way
faring Stranger who has made
Broadway coowboy-song-conscious)
and Richard Dyer-Bennct (famed
for bin interpretation of English
ballads) have been choreographed
for presentation to illustrate the
first form. These include English,
American, Australian, and cowboy
ballads.
The medium of the spoken word
will be employed in "Two Slat
terns and a King," a talc with a
moral, by Edna tS. Vincent Millay,
choreographed and read by Mary
Cogswell; and "Extase," a French
poem by Victor Hugo, which will
be interpreted as a solo by Marjoric
Forkncr and read by Bill Melton.
