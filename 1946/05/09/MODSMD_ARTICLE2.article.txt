# Budget May Oust Three Sports
## 
### 
The statement by A.S.S.U. President Bob Kennedy of Excom that rugby, soccer, and wiestling
would be cut from next year's athletic budget remained unconfirmed last night when A 1 Masters,
director of athletics, stated that no budget had been submitted yet, but that a cut somewhere was
expected.
Kennedy said that the chief source of revenue is football which has not been played for three
years. "Until the stadium can be filled for about two years," he continued, "there won't be
enough money to carry on these sports."
Excom recommended a policy that no wheat products be served at social functions, and
in keeping with the policy cut rolls from the budget of the Con Home barbecue and cookies
from the Rally Com dance budget.
Excom members volunteered to stimulate support of the food conservation program in their
areas, and Bob Collins, who was appointed by Excom to look into the situation, reported that he
is getting speakers together who will explain the need of the program and offer specific sug
gestions as to what can be cut out.
The suggestion that the four men's representatives to Excom be elected the second week of fall
quarter and that the present ones stay on until the fall election was passed by Excom. Districts
were divided into upper and lower Row, Encina, and Branner-Toyon. All districts will be an
nounced in the Daily tomorrow.
