# STRIKE CHIEF
## Marine Unions To Call Strike Walkout Would Stop Coast, Gulf Shipping 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 8 (UP).
—The strike committee of five pow
erful nationwide maritime unions
today set June 15 for a joint strike
which would paralyze shipping on
; the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts
| over union demands for higher
j wages and improved working con
j Jitions.
Shelving temporarily considera
tion of federation of six CIO unions
and one independent union, 240
; delegates turned tonight to deliber
ate the recommendation of a 32-
man policy and strike committee
for a June 15 walkout.
300,000 TO STRIKE
The agreement, reached between
| four CIO and one independent with
; two CIO unions abstaining, called
upon an estimated 300,000 workers
i on all coasts to strike in support of
wage and hour demands from wa
! tcrfront employers.
The recommendation was subject
j to the ratification of all represented
unions and their membership, and
j provided for establishment of a na
: tional committee to co-ordinate the
i strike on a nationwide basis.
INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT
Possible worldwide ramifications
; were seen by observers in the com
i mittec recommendation that the
j secretariat of the World Federation
| of Trade Unions in Paris be con
tacted to work out details for ob
' taining support of trade unions in
other countries.
All ships would be struck, the
, committee announced, with the ex
-1 ception of troop and relief ships
j unless employers refuse to operate
1 such ships under "fair and equi
table conditions."
UNIONS TO MERGER?
The joint union conference origi
nally was called to consider merger
j of the individual unions under one
i head to form a gigantic and power
ful body—fifth in strength in the
1 CIO organization.
Agreement on the joint strike ac
tion led observers to believe accord
on the major issue of merger was
approaching.
Simultaneously the American
j Federation of Labor announced in
Seattle that all AFL maritime un
| ions, representing some 835,000
| workers on all coasts, would be
merged to regain the locals "raided"
Iby ihe CIO.
The resulting federation will rec
ommend similar action be followed
by internationals on other coasts, it
l was announced here, thus posing a
possible bitter jurisdictional dispute
for American shipping interests in
i the months to come.
