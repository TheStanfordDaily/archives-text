### 
WASHINGTON. May 8 (UP).—
The $3,750,000,000 British loan bill
passed its first major test today
when the Senate rejected, 45 to 40,
an amendment which would have
required Great Britain to Rive the
United States outright ownership of
leased Atlantic bases in return for
the credit.
While thcr close vole indicated
there are at least 40 of the Senate's
95 members opposed to the loan,
Administration leaders believed the
victory promises ultimate approval
without restrictions.
The amendment, offered by Sen.
Ernest W. McFarland, D.. Ariz.,
would have required Great Britain
to give this country permanent pos
session of bases in Jamaica. Ber
muda. Antigua, and Trinidad—now
held on 99-year leases.
