# Coal Strike Halts Work In Industry
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 8 (UP).
—The government moved swift
ly tonight to stretch out the na
tion's vanishing coal reserves
by country-wide rationing of
manufactured gas, dimouts in 22
eastern and midwestern states,
and use of truck fleets for emer
gency freight transportation.
A federal directive authorizing gas
companies to start rationing servicu
to householders and other consum
ers was drafter for formal issuance
tonight.
INDUSTRIAL COLLAPSE?
Simultaneously, utility commis
sions in the 22 states dependent on
soft coal for their electric power
were asked to adopt, stringent fuel
conservation measures at once.
Government experts said restora
tion of the wartime dimouts was tlvj
only effective means of compliance
with that request.
The surprise gas rationing move
pointed up a warning by federal
reserve chairman Marriner S. Ec
cles that the long-threatened in
dustrial collapse resulting from the
coal crisis is right at hand. Eccles
told the Senate Banking Committee
that the effects of the strike might
well be irreparable if it dragged on
for ever, a few more days.
EMERGENCY PRIORITIES
The gas and electricity conserva
tion moves were initiated by the
Civilian Production Administration,
which already had set up a sub
agency charged with keeping the
nation's utility services operating,
at least partially, for the duration
of the coala strike.
The Office of Defense Transpor
tation followed through with a for
mal request to all motor truck op
erators to give the same emergency
priorities to food and other essen
tia commodities that the railroads
are observing. This will prevent di
version of non-essential freight
from the railroads to motor carriers,
ODT Director J. Monroe Johnson
said.
"SAVE FROM LEWIS"
At the Capitol, meanwhile, angry
senators and representatives clam
ored more loudly for legislative ac
tion to curb UMW President John
L. Lewis, and several bills along
that line were initiated. Three
southern senators and California's
Republican Sen. William R. Know
land served notice that they will
move to set aside the British loan
bill and take up labor legislation
tomorrow, unless the strike is set
tled by that time.
"Something must be done to savo
this dountry from John L. Lewis,"
shouted Sen. James O. Eastman (D.,
Miss.).
COAL FOR 12 lIOL'KS
In the House, where two dractic
anti-Lewis bills were being drafted
by a judiciary subcommittee, Rep.
Harold Knutson (R., Minn.) said the;
midwestern dairy industry was on
the verge of a breakdown for lack
of coal.
CPA Chief John D. Small warned
that coal stocks now on hand for
emergency distribution "are less
than the country would normally
consume in one 1 2-hour period."
Industrial and commercial users
were told that they could expect no
coal from the government short
stockpiles unless needed to protect
public health and safety.

the verge of a breakdown for lack
of coal.
CPA Chief John D. Small warned
that coal stocks now on hand for
emergency distribution "are less
than the country would normally
consume in one 1 2-hour period."
Industrial and commercial users
were told that they could expect no
coal from the government short
stockpiles unless needed to protect
public health and safety.
WASHINGTON, May 8 (UP).
—The government moved swift
ly tonight to stretch out the na
tion's vanishing coal reserves
by country-wide rationing of
manufactured gas, dimouts in 22
eastern and midwestern states,
and use of truck fleets for emer
gency freight transportation.
A federal directive authorizing gas
companies to start rationing servicu
to householders and other consum
ers was drafter for formal issuance
tonight.
INDUSTRIAL COLLAPSE?
Simultaneously, utility commis
sions in the 22 states dependent on
soft coal for their electric power
were asked to adopt, stringent fuel
conservation measures at once.
Government experts said restora
tion of the wartime dimouts was tlvj
only effective means of compliance
with that request.
The surprise gas rationing move
pointed up a warning by federal
reserve chairman Marriner S. Ec
cles that the long-threatened in
dustrial collapse resulting from the
coal crisis is right at hand. Eccles
told the Senate Banking Committee
that the effects of the strike might
well be irreparable if it dragged on
for ever, a few more days.
EMERGENCY PRIORITIES
The gas and electricity conserva
tion moves were initiated by the
Civilian Production Administration,
which already had set up a sub
agency charged with keeping the
nation's utility services operating,
at least partially, for the duration
of the coala strike.
The Office of Defense Transpor
tation followed through with a for
mal request to all motor truck op
erators to give the same emergency
priorities to food and other essen
tia commodities that the railroads
are observing. This will prevent di
version of non-essential freight
from the railroads to motor carriers,
ODT Director J. Monroe Johnson
said.
"SAVE FROM LEWIS"
At the Capitol, meanwhile, angry
senators and representatives clam
ored more loudly for legislative ac
tion to curb UMW President John
L. Lewis, and several bills along
that line were initiated. Three
southern senators and California's
Republican Sen. William R. Know
land served notice that they will
move to set aside the British loan
bill and take up labor legislation
tomorrow, unless the strike is set
tled by that time.
"Something must be done to savo
this dountry from John L. Lewis,"
shouted Sen. James O. Eastman (D.,
Miss.).
COAL FOR 12 lIOL'KS
In the House, where two dractic
anti-Lewis bills were being drafted
by a judiciary subcommittee, Rep.
Harold Knutson (R., Minn.) said the;
midwestern dairy industry was on
the verge of a breakdown for lack
of coal.
