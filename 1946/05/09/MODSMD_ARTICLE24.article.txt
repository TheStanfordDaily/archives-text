# Election Yearâ€”Starvation Year
## 
### 
11 you want to put your finger on why the
United States is falling down in its premise
to send food to the hungry millions of Eu
rope and Asia, you'd be right in remember
ing it's an election year.
And in election year apparently many
legislators of this country are ready to toss
overboard vestiges of conscience and hang
on to the band-wagon of "do nothing until
the votes are in "
They won't take positive action on wheat
r.:!:w a.q or effective control of food produc

tion and marketing because they know it will
lose them the backing of self-interested pres
sure groups.
But if the American pepole can express
their willingness to follow a direct govern
ment action for food conservation, something
can still be done. When leaders fail, it's up
to us.
We ask that as students in a wealthy, well
fed nation, you throw your support strongly
to all efforts to legislate compulsory meas
ures to save food. Before it's too late, de
mand action, not watery promises.
