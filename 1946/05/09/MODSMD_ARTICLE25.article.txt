# So What, Stanford?
## 
### 
A program concerning food conservation,
a subject which ought to be every person's
first concern right now in this fine country,
was held yesterday.
So one person, a Daily reporter, arrived.
So what?
ft wouldn't make any difference if all 5,000
Stanford students stayed away from the meet
ing. As a matter of fact, they did.
But what does make a difference is that a
good percentage of that 5,000 is not only un
interested in hearing about conservation, but

is not doing anything above the minimum in
the way of saving food.
Cutting out bread at one meal a day may
satisfy your ethical twinges, but it won't
save very many lives. What will help is a
complete program which curtails serving
of wheats and oils in all menus and sub
stitutes wherever possible.
Where are you heading, Stanford? By cut
ting down you may find meals a little duller;
by not cutting down you may make some
lives a little shorter.
