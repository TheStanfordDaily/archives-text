ON BEING HUNGRY ... OK STARVING
D< ar Editor:
One of the greatest problems facing us today as
citizens of the world is the imminent threat of star
vation to millions of people. The problem seems
far removed from we«who have more than plenty
to eat here in the United States.
lilive we ever known what it is to be genuinely
hungry? What it does to the body and the rnind? It
is hard to think of this problem in terms of our
■ but we must if we are to realize the true
■ it nation that exists today.
'think of your brother or sister feeling in gar
bage cans for a bite of food, or walking J5 miles
to buy a sack of potato peelings for your family
to eat; or your mother inotbing dying, because of
lack of food. Or visualize the community in which
one day a neighbor of yours is carried from his
home, dead from starvation ... a person whom
you knew well and liked. And the next week,
someone else; it is a slow and tortuous death.
I am certain that whatever small sacrifices we
make right now in helping to avert a major catas
trophe in our world society will bring to us a rich
reward in the future.
There will be no world peace under any circum
stances until there is food in countries where now
men in desperation .would steal or kill for some
thing to eat. We must, do our part now.

To the Editor:
This open letter is not a criticism of the Daily
: latt or of its editorial policy but'a criticism of those
who have allowed their partisan tendencies to color
Iraight news reporting.
On Wednesday, May 3, two articles of a clearly

partisan nature appeared in the Daily—articles
which were offensively slanted in the interest of
the C.1.0.-P.A.C. endorsed candidate for Congress
from this congressional district. One article was
captioned VETERANS (an all-inclusive term sub
ject to gross misinterpretation) SUPPORT MC
DONALD, '35.
The '35 was obviously employed as a clever, sub
tle device to appeal to Stanford students to support
a man simply because he happened to have enough
persistence to graduate from this institution. The
other article implied that Congressman Jack An
derson was put on the spot by the C.1.0.-P.A.C. can
didate, McDonald.
If anyone was under fire at the discussion be
tween our Congressman and McDonald which took
placed in the Palo Alto High School auditorium, it
was the C.1.0.-P.A.C. candidate McDonald, who
chose to introduce the childish devices (which he
used exclusively in the discussion) of name calling
and mud slinging in a most un-Stanford-like fash
ion.
We, the undersigned, as VETERANS, resent the
implication that we support any such man as Mc-
Donald, and we have a right to suggest that we
have impartial unslanted reporting in the Daily.

to eat; or your mother inotbing dying, because of
lack of food. Or visualize the community in which
one day a neighbor of yours is carried from his
home, dead from starvation ... a person whom
you knew well and liked. And the next week,
someone else; it is a slow and tortuous death.
I am certain that whatever small sacrifices we
make right now in helping to avert a major catas
trophe in our world society will bring to us a rich
reward in the future.
There will be no world peace under any circum
stances until there is food in countries where now
men in desperation .would steal or kill for some
thing to eat. We must, do our part now.

This open letter is not a criticism of the Daily
: latt or of its editorial policy but'a criticism of those
who have allowed their partisan tendencies to color
Iraight news reporting.
On Wednesday, May 3, two articles of a clearly

partisan nature appeared in the Daily—articles
which were offensively slanted in the interest of
the C.1.0.-P.A.C. endorsed candidate for Congress
from this congressional district. One article was
captioned VETERANS (an all-inclusive term sub
ject to gross misinterpretation) SUPPORT MC
DONALD, '35.
The '35 was obviously employed as a clever, sub
tle device to appeal to Stanford students to support
a man simply because he happened to have enough
persistence to graduate from this institution. The
other article implied that Congressman Jack An
derson was put on the spot by the C.1.0.-P.A.C. can
didate, McDonald.
If anyone was under fire at the discussion be
tween our Congressman and McDonald which took
placed in the Palo Alto High School auditorium, it
was the C.1.0.-P.A.C. candidate McDonald, who
chose to introduce the childish devices (which he
used exclusively in the discussion) of name calling
and mud slinging in a most un-Stanford-like fash
ion.
We, the undersigned, as VETERANS, resent the
implication that we support any such man as Mc-
Donald, and we have a right to suggest that we
have impartial unslanted reporting in the Daily.

ON BEING HUNGRY ... OK STARVING
D< ar Editor:
One of the greatest problems facing us today as
citizens of the world is the imminent threat of star
vation to millions of people. The problem seems
far removed from we«who have more than plenty
to eat here in the United States.
lilive we ever known what it is to be genuinely
hungry? What it does to the body and the rnind? It
is hard to think of this problem in terms of our
■ but we must if we are to realize the true
■ it nation that exists today.
'think of your brother or sister feeling in gar
bage cans for a bite of food, or walking J5 miles
to buy a sack of potato peelings for your family
to eat; or your mother inotbing dying, because of
lack of food. Or visualize the community in which
one day a neighbor of yours is carried from his
home, dead from starvation ... a person whom
you knew well and liked. And the next week,
