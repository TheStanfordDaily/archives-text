# WHO TOLD YOU?

### STAN SHPETNER 
FOR MEN ONLY
We went, over to fill out an application for a
room.
The line looked like one in front of an Army
< amp movie house. We waited in line for an hour.
Cost us two bucks right there. You figure that we
are getting 500 dollars for nine months of school,
tjlus nine times G5 dollars and then if you are tak
ing 15 units that figures down to the fact that every
time you go to class you 'are getting paid two
bucks. So if you don't go, what else can you do but.
mail them back the two dollars.
It took 15 minutes for live guys to go through the
line. That's three minute;! a guy. About .3.000 male
students wanting a room and then if you get some
body to help you work it out—that means that it is
going to take 150 hours to get them all through.
That's 20 eight-hour days. The joker who is last in
line can really lose a lot of study time.
There's that part on the card that rails for "we
the undersigned" . . . We felt like we was sign
ing up for another hitch or something. We printed
our name. A guy in our hall said that it isn't
legal unless you write it out.
On that part that asks: who you would prefer as
your roommate(s). Boy they are really leaving
themselves wide open on that one. That Dr. Sharp
can't seem to make up his mind. We gave him our
preference about 20 times. What's the matter with
(he guy? Didn't he ever hear of co-education?

The card asks for "months in service." Then
right above that it says "Major ." We pti(
dtiwn "yes." If they find out we were only a
PFC we'll probably get pushed back into Se
quoia Ilall.

The tennis team took a bit of a lacing the past
weekend. Number one man couldn't make it and
the other men had to move up. Ted Schroeder,
who has jumped over a few nets in his time, was
along with the boys. His brother Chuck is on the
team. Ted -Smed. Who needs a number one man.
We know who we would have in there. Slip a pair
of dark glasses on him and call him Chuck.
Why not? It was SC we were playing.

Somehow or other, pari of our last column got
lost in Ihe rush. We had said that "Stanford had
(aken care of our moral education" and had fol
lowed (hat by a mild hit of sarcasm. The sar
casm got lost and only the single line appeared.
Well you get the idea. Or as we used to say it in
Cape Cod—idear.

We know who we would have in there. Slip a pair
of dark glasses on him and call him Chuck.
Why not? It was SC we were playing.

Somehow or other, pari of our last column got

Mother's Day is going to be around pretty soon.
All of the Fox movie houses on the West Coast are
going to let mothers who are over fiO in free dur
ing all of Mother's Day.
Wild gamblers ain't they?
FOR MEN ONLY
We went, over to fill out an application for a
room.
The line looked like one in front of an Army
< amp movie house. We waited in line for an hour.
Cost us two bucks right there. You figure that we
are getting 500 dollars for nine months of school,
tjlus nine times G5 dollars and then if you are tak
ing 15 units that figures down to the fact that every
time you go to class you 'are getting paid two
bucks. So if you don't go, what else can you do but.
mail them back the two dollars.
It took 15 minutes for live guys to go through the
line. That's three minute;! a guy. About .3.000 male
students wanting a room and then if you get some
body to help you work it out—that means that it is
going to take 150 hours to get them all through.
That's 20 eight-hour days. The joker who is last in
line can really lose a lot of study time.
There's that part on the card that rails for "we
the undersigned" . . . We felt like we was sign
ing up for another hitch or something. We printed
our name. A guy in our hall said that it isn't
legal unless you write it out.
On that part that asks: who you would prefer as
your roommate(s). Boy they are really leaving
themselves wide open on that one. That Dr. Sharp
can't seem to make up his mind. We gave him our
preference about 20 times. What's the matter with
(he guy? Didn't he ever hear of co-education?

The card asks for "months in service." Then
right above that it says "Major ." We pti(
dtiwn "yes." If they find out we were only a
PFC we'll probably get pushed back into Se
quoia Ilall.

The tennis team took a bit of a lacing the past
weekend. Number one man couldn't make it and
the other men had to move up. Ted Schroeder,
who has jumped over a few nets in his time, was
along with the boys. His brother Chuck is on the
team. Ted -Smed. Who needs a number one man.
We know who we would have in there. Slip a pair
of dark glasses on him and call him Chuck.
