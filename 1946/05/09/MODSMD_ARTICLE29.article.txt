Appointment procedure for Hous
ing Committee will begin Monday
when girls interested in being on
the committee will give their names
to their house presidents.
Phyllis Sutherland, Catie Owen,
and Joan Bailey will go off the
committee at the end of the quar
ter and three new members will be
appointed to take office fall quarter.
NEW CHAIRMAN
Housing Committee will elect a
new chairman next week from
among its four remaining members,
Helen Dietz, Ann Shimmel, Babs
Wilbur, and Margaret Wade. Two
of the new members will come from
Union Unit and the other from the
Row or Lagunita, depending upon
what area the new chairman comes
from. The chairman does not rep
resent any area. The Women's Con
ference president and two new
freshmen will become members
next fall.
House presidents will submit
their list of girls interested to their
unit excoms the following Monday,
May 20. The excoms will recom

mend several girls to Conference
Advisory Board which will choose
the three members sometime that
week, subject to Conference ap
proval May 27.
ROKLE REPRESENTATIVES
Pioble girls will tell their senators
if they are interested and will he
come candidates of the area to
which they are moving. If they stay
in Roble, they will not be eligible
for the committee, as Roble's only
representatives are two freshmen to
be appointed in the fall.
Babs Wilbur suggested yesterday
at Housing Committee that spring
quarter room drawings be on the
ratio system and fall and winter
quarter drawings on the class pref
erence system to give everyone a
better chance to move. The plan
will be discussed at Conference
Monday.
