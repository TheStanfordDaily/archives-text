# Chances Seen For Indian Win Over VCLA Thinclads Saturday
## 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
Putting their three straight losses [
behind them, Stanford's track In- i
dians, hoping that the einderpath j
eclipse has passed over, take on j
their second P.C.C. opponent this !
wekend when they play host to j
U.C.L.A. at Angell Field Saturday :
afternoon.
A ray of hope shines forth for '
the Cards against the Bruins —not j
much of a ray, but it still denotes !
hope. According to pre-meet prog- !
nosticators, the visitors are given j
about a 12-point advantage, which j

! is more than enough to beat the
Cards.
HOME FIELD HELPS
However, two factors enter into
the picture at this stage: one is that
the meet is being held at Stanford,
and the other is that the Indians are
not quite as bad as they looked last
week against U.S.C. at the Coli
seum. •
If Harry Trotter brings an ab
breviated squad north, Stanford
should be able to cop a goodly por
tion of the seconds and thirds and
may pile up enough points there to

narow the margin down consider
ably.
As the figures stand now, Stan
! ford should take about seven firsts
i and five seconds—if all goes well—
and possibly make up enough in
the thirds to take the meet or at
| least force the issue up until the
time for the relay.
POSSIBLE PLACES LISTED
The first places listed for the
Farm are Captain Martin Anderson
| in the 100, George Grimes in the
880, Frank Ganahl in the mile and
! two-mile, Dave DeSwarte in the
discus, Ed Luce in the high jump,
j and Bill Larson in the pole vault.
That's what it should be like. Of
course, Grimes may take the 440
too, John Ken ward may take the
j javelin, and Bob Millington may
take the shot. Then again they may
not, which puts it up to the place
j and show men. .
BRUIN CHANCES
And, of course, U.C.L.A. may do
some surprising of its own, like Al
Kapp taking the 100, Ralph Gold
the 880, John Pattee the mile or
two-miel or both, and Taylor Lewis
1 the discus.
The big weaknesses of the Indians
i are practically the same that ex
isted at the beginning of the season,
namely the lack of a furlong sprint
er, a broad jumper, and a couple of
hurdlers. Only in the century dash
has a white hope appeared.
DEVELOPED SPRINTER
By sheer hard labor and persist
ence has Coach Jack Weiershauser
developed in Martin Anderson a
good sprinter. When the season
started, Anderson was only a fair
10.2 man, but since has improved
steadily to the 9.9 class, despite his
performance on the Coliseum track
last week.
In the 220, broadjump and hur
dles, however, U.C.L.A. can—if it
wants to — practically sweep the
field, and if Coach Trotter bings
enough men north he can pile up
an insurmountable edge in these
events.
To sweep an event means more
than just one team picking up nine
points; it also means nine points
less for the other side, and to carry
it out means an 18-point difference.
Apply that to four events, and there
goes your track meet.
