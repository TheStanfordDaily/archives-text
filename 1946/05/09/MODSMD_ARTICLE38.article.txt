# Indian Golfers Go South To Meet Trojans, Bruins
## 
### JOHN SABIN 
Stanford's varsilv golfers meet their first conference opposition this
weekend when they take on iinknien from U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. this Fri
day and Saturday in Los Angeles. Coach Willis (). Hunter's Trojans boast
some top-flight golfers and will he no pushover for the Indians, hut
U.C.L.A. is not so lucky and should he little trouble for Coach Lddie
Twiggs' divot-diggers.
Last week S.C. defeated the Uclans easily in both of their engagements

by scores of 33-3 and 46-2. Troy's
top golfer is Paul Carter, who will
probably be matched against Stan
ford's number one man Frank Mc-
Cann. Carter carded a 76 in the
first U.C.L.A. match and a 71 in
the second engagement. MeCann's
top score to date (on the Stanford
links) is a 68. If McCann is playing
in top form, he should take this
one.
TEAM AVERAGES 7G
The rest of the S.C. team is ca
pable of averaging around 7(5.
Against this Coach Twiggs will send,
in addition to McCann, Tom Lam
bie, Jack Schuler, Bob Cardinal,
Bob Rosburg, and Don Jones. Stan
ford's linksmen can top any Tro
jan performance, but they must be
playing in top form to better the
Troy scores of last Thursday.
As for U.C.L.A., Bill Spaulding's
squad will be lucky to get any
points at all from Stanford. Neff,
Bross, Gardner, Levin, and Signer
are the top Bruin golfers, but they
are no match for Stanford's squad.
DOUBLE VICTORY IN SIGHT
With the golf team in top shape,
Stanford can take both U.C.L.A.
and U.S.C. in tow this weekend and
be well on the way to a continuance
of the seven straight conference
championships that make Stanford's
golf record the best in the country.
