# Industrial Writing Is Unknown Field

### 
(Editorial Note: As part of its
spring quarter program to sug
gest different vocations of interest
to Stanford women, Vocom will
sponsor this column each week
until the end of the quarter. This
first one appears on Thursday;
subsequent columns will appear
on Mondays. Vocom's first View
concerns Industrial Writing.)
Most people associate the word
"magazine" with Collier's, Life, or
possibly Superman Comics. Few
realize the existence of thousands
of publications which never appear
on newsstands: the industrial mag
azines. Yet in both number and cir
culation they surpass the general
magazines, and their ranks are
swelling day by day.
Almost every large and medium
sized industry, utility, and corpora
tion publishes at least one maga
zine; some publish three or four,
besides innumerable bulletins and
pamphlets. Some of these "books,"
as they are called in the trade, are
"internal" to promote understand
ing between management and la
bor; others are "external" to en
courage good relations between
company and customer.
There is a growing need for
trained graduates in this field. The
editor of one such magazine recent
ly expressed his regret that he had
been reduced to raiding the staffs
of fellow editors.
Women have proved especially
adaptable to the work of writing,
editing, and publishing these in
dustrial magazines.
Success in the field is based on
natural interest and ability for the
work as well as broad general
training. Recommended courses in
college include journalism, adver
tising, history, economics, and espe
cially shorthand and typing. Un
dergraduates are also advised to
take advantage of practice offered
on student publications.
Students wishing more informa
tion about this type of work may
consult recent printed material
available in the office of Miss
Anastasia Doyle, Assistant Dean of
Women.
