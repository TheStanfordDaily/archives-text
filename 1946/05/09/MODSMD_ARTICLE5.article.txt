# We Sit Doing Little, Nothing About Meeting

### 
A Daily reporter questioned stu
dents in the Cellar as to where they
were at 4:15 yesterday, the time of
the food conservation assembly.
Several said they had known noth
ing about the meeting, but others
admitted they had forgotten or had
dccided not to go.
Trudy Ilorswill—"I was listening
to the radio at home."
Margaret Wade, Dabs Wilbur,
Marianne Shim met—"We were at
an important Housing Committee
meeting."
Joan Whittier—"l was sitting on
the front porch of the house doing
my Spanish."
John Flannery—"l was in the biz
school library studying."
John Hernan—"l was changing a
tire."
Emily Angle—"l was picking a
rose in a garden in Palo Alto. I
had heard about the meeting but
thought it was tonight or some oth
er time."
Jerry Golby—"l was in the cm
bryology lab."
Bob Rohrcr—"l was lying on the
roof of the Sigma Nu house."
Dick Golden—"l was drinking
iced tea."
Bob Kennedy—"l was in my of
fice doing some work. It seems too
bad that with all the efforts being
made the students don't have any
interest in the problem."
A check on the number of stu
dents at the Cellar showed that ap
proximate! y 80 students were there
at the time of the conservation fo
rum. About 25 students were at
the Boathouse, lying on the deck.
