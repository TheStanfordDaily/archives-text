## 
### 
Any fraternity with at least five activcs and pledges who plan to
live in the house can, after complying with the regulations set up by
the Interfraternity Board, reopen its house autumn quarter as a chapter
house.
This was revealed in the revised "Report of the Committee on the
Rcopning Procedure" which was adopted yesterday by the Interfrater
nity Board of Control.
The University will return the houses to the fraternities after (1)
the property has been cleared through the University Business Manager,
and (2) a written application has been submitted to the Interfraternity
Board by a committee of fraternity officers.
Graduate members and pledges of the fraternities will be allowed to
live in the houses. However, if the fraternity cannot satisfy the Uni
versity requirement as to the number of residents, it must accept addi
tional occupants, who will be assigned to the House by the University
after consultation with the House.
Preliminary application must be submitted by June 1, 1946, if a house
opening in September is anticipated. Final application should be in by
August 1, 1946. Each chapter will be required to obtain specific approval
of its program before final authorization is given for resumption of its
activities on the campus.
The applications must indue a plan of operation of the bouse that
provides for a responsible resident adviser in accordance with Dr. Tres
idder's letter to Ed Luce, presdent of the Board, last month.
This responsible resident adviser can be cither a house mother, fac
nulty member, or mature graduate student.
Dean Stalnakcr has requested that a list of members, including
pledges, expected to live in the chapter house this autumn be submitted
to him by June 1.
The fraternities must also name a house manager or representative
to attend meetings of the House Managers' Association this quarter, and
must show evidence of their financial stability, including a proposed
operating budget for at least three quarters.
