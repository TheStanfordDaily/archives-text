WASHINGTON, May 9 (UP).—
The Senate today adopted a stop
gap resolution extending the draft
law for 45 days—until July I—and
House concurrence is cxpected on
Monday.
House leaders indicated that they
would accept the resolution to give
the Senate more time to consider
the lower chamber's previously
passed bill which calls for a nine
month extension, but with provi
sions for a five-month draft holiday.
Gen. Jacob L. Devers, Army
Ground Forces commander, yester
day accused Congressmen of being
"cowards" for failure to tackle the
draft bill. He said that if one of his
division commanders acted that
way "I'd fire him."
The Senate Military Affairs Com
mittee has approved a one-year ex
tension which would place an 18-
month limit on the service of all
inductees and require the release
of all fathers by Sept. 1. It is pend
ing on the Senate calendar.
