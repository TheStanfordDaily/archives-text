# Only Fifteen Signatures, You're Up for Election

### 
Bv checking through the new
ASSU constitution, some interesting
information comes to light, lake,
for instance, Article VI, Section 4.
This slates;
"The right to nominate by peti
tion and to elect by direct, secret
ha!lots shall not he denied for any
elective office.
Not revolutionary at first sight.,
but when compared with the old
traditional methods of electing wom
en's representatives in ASSU elec
tions the provision takes on new
| power.
In every former election, women
seeking thr student body vice-pres
idency and other spots on women s
conference and council had to ap
pear before a nominating commit
tee. This committee, formed from
previously elected women, would
review qualifications and eligibility
of aspirants and then present a cho
sen group of nominees to the voters
on election day. This method of
! selection will again bo used in nom
inations for the all-important elec
tions coming up the end of this
month.
Every woman on campus should
understand, under this new article,
there is no necessity to go through
this formal nomination procedure.
If the interested person has the
ability, and is qualified for the spot,
the method is simple.

On May 16 the regular nomination
slip will have to be filled out, signed
by 15 registered members of the stu
dent body, and recorded. The nom
inee will be fully as eligible to run
for the position as the people whose
names appear on the nominating I
committee's list.
The vice-president of the stu
dent body is traditionally a worn- i
an, and, traditionally, is picked j
from a group of nominees select- I
ed by the nomination committee.
But on close investigation, no- |
where in the constitution is it \
stated whether the person selected j
must be a man or a woman.
The position is an important one. j
The vice-president takes over the |
running of the student body in all ;
absences of the president. She. or i
he, represents the president, and the !
school on all occasions when presid
ing, and will take the presidency j
by right of succession if the presi- i
dent leaves office. The person se- '
leeted to fill this spot, should have
every qualification needed to make a
good president, in addition to the
ability to take care of detail work.
â€”F.R.
(Note: This is the second in a
series of articles on the new con
stitution and its importance to
the student body in connection j
with the coming ASSU elections.)
