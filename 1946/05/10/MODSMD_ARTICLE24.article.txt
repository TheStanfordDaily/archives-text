# Vote for the Villain

Villains—Stanford style—will stalk the
stage of the Memorial Auditorium tonight.
At their sides will be heroines of all sorts,
and on their trail a few stereotyped but Farm
inspired heroes. It's Ram's Head again, it's
the students again, and, after a long and con
troversial wait, it's a coed-and-rough-pro
duced play again.
We expect it'll be a good play. But if it's
noi if it doesn't have "that professional
toach," if a stage set should fall down in the
middls of the third act, we'll still applaud,
and stand up in favor of any student play,
any Urns.
Believing that a liberal education is incom
plete if it doesn't teach students how to apply
their knowledge and make their own unwar
ranted ,but beneficial mistakes, we herein
take a stand—for an emphasis on amateur
rather than professional productions as train
ing for students in dramatics.
We don't mean complete omission of such
ambitious productions as "The Magic Flute."
These are invaluable in learning professional

technique or seeing the technical possibili
ties of a standard stage. But we want a size
able portion of both, and here's why:
To be part of a production in which every
student is able to contribute in the best way
he knows how to the entertainment of other
students, and to participate in a group with
common aims, is to find a real relation to his
school and his special segment of that
school's life.
Maybe we'll pan the show, here in the
Daily shack, or maybe we'll say it tops all
the other spring shows we've seen in our
short stay here.
But no matter what, we'll remember all
the rehearsals that went into it—till midnight
and beyond, every night with Sundays not
excepted -and realize the East Lynne gang
has gotten plenty out of it. We'll think of all
the friendships made in the play's behalf, the
common worry, the tremendous responsibil
ity, and the unqualified satisfaction each must
feel at having done the job all together, and
all alone.—BMV,
