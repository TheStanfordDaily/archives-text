### BILL HORNBY 
C.\ WILLIAM JAMES AM) THE IDEAL
STANFORD
Cne of Jane Stanford's last requests was that
William James be brought to Stanford. The Har
vard philosopher and psychologist had appeared
here on the Tuesday Evening Lecture Series, and
Ins CifTord Lectures in Edinburgh in 1902, the fa
mous "Varieties of Religious Experience," hud
marked him as on? of America's leading intellec
tual forces.
His arrival on the Farm in August ISOS to accept
a year's visiting professorship in philosophy was
proof that Stanford as a school had "arrived." It
was natural James should be the featured speaker
at Founder's Day in 1906, a ceremony carrying
added weight sine? the recent passing of Mrs. Stan
ford had removed some of the force which kept
the Administration following the Senator's original
pUnj for the school.
William James might not care for the term
"guest columnist," hut his lecture should form a
112 art of the published Stanford Story. Given when
the idealistic first-years' glow of the young school
had not yet been snufTed by earthquake and the
gene, d passing of time, James' lecture is a his
torical record of the way many of his content
) orariei, felt about Stanford.
After making some introductory remaks about
Founder's Day and the boldness of the Stanfords'
expei iment, James began his analysis of the Stan
lord of 1906. (Paragraphing and selection of pas
sages are mine.â€”B. H.)
"Certainly the chief impression which the ex
isting University must make on every visitor is of
something unique and unparalleled. . . . The
classic scenery of its site, reminding one of Greece,
. . . the great city, near enough for convenience,
too far ever to become invasive . . . the climate
. . . ihe noble architecture . . . the democracy of
the life . . . Die Luft der Freiheit weht!
". . . Surely the one destiny to which this
happy beginning seems to call Stanford is that it
should become something intense and original,
not necessarily in point of wealth or extent but in
point of spiritual quality. ... It rests with the
officials of the present and future Stanford, it rests
with the devotion and sympathetic insight of the
t rowing body of graduates, to prolong the vision
where the founders' vision terminated, and to in
sure that all succeeding steps, like the first steps,
shall single out this University more and more as
a university of quality peculiarly.
"And what makes essential quality in a uni
versity? ... It is the quality of its men that
makes the quality of a university.
"You may have your buildings, you may cre
ate your committees and boards and regulations,
you may pile up your machinery of discipline
and perfect your methods of instruction, you
may spend money till no one can approach you;
yet you will add nothing hut one more trivial

specimen to the common herd of American col
leges, unless you send into all this organization
some breath of life by inoculating it with a few
men, at least, who are real geniuses.
"And if you once have the geniuses, you can
easily dispense with most of the organization.
Like a contagious disease, almost, spiritual life
passes from man to man by contact. Education in
the long run is an affair that works itself out be
tween the individual student and his opportunities.
". . . Offer the opportunities, leave the student
to his natural reaction on them, and he will work
out his personal destiny, be it a high one or a low
one. Above all things offer the opportunity of
higher personal contacts . . . the alpha and omega
of a university is the tone of it, and this tone is
set by human personalities exclusively.
". . . The world, in fact, is only beginning to
see that the wealth of a nation consists more than
anything else in the number of superior men it
harbors. . . . Geniuses are ferments; and when
they com" together as they have done in certain
lands at certain times, the whole population seems
to share in the high energy they awaken.
". . . the universities are already a sort of agency
providentially provided for the detection and en
couragement of mental superiority.
". . . it would seem as if one among them that
followed this line most successfully would quickly
rise to a position of paramountcy and distinction.
Why should not Stanford immediately adopt this as
her vital policy?
". . . she needs only a boldness like that shown
by her founders to become the seat of a glowing
intellectual life ... let her call great investigators
from whatever lands they live in. . . . Let these
men, following the happy tradition of the place,
make the university.
"The original foundation had something ec
centric in it; let Stanford not fear to he eccentric
to the end if need he. Let her not imitate; lei
her lead, not follow. Especially let her not he
hound by vulgar traditions as to the cheapness
or dearness of professorial service. . . . Where
quality is the thing sought after, the thing of
supreme quality is cheap, whatever he the price
one has to pay for it.
"Can we not, as we sit here today, frame a
vision of what it may be a century hence, with the
honors of the intervening years all rolled up in its
traditions?
"Not vast, but intense; less a place for teaching
youth and maidens than for Iraining scholars; de
voted to truth; radiating influence; setting stand
ards; shedding abroad the fruits of learning; me
diating between America and Asia, and helping the
more intellectual men of both continents (o under
stand each other better. . . ."
* Thus William James, speaking 40 years ago,
providing somewhat of a yardstick for those meas
uring Stanford in 1946.
