On April 19 this column read in part "Stanford
University will once again raise tuition, board, and
room.'' Yesterday's Daily (May 9) quoted the Uni
versity Vice-President as answering "recurring ru
mors" bv saying, "The whole matter is just being
studied."
They may be "studying il" but not "just"
studying it. Five will get v«»u ten that the "re
curing rumors" will he fact, when most of us
return for fall "rcg" day.
As long as the government continues handing
out five hundred per year, why not raise the tuition
up to $166 per quarter? That will still leave the
boys 66 cents a quarter for books.

Yesterday Bob Kennedy, A.S.S.U. president,
stated that rugby, soccer, and wrestling may be cut
from next year's budget. He said, "Until the sta
dium can filled for about two years, there won't
be enough money to carry on these sport:;."
Behind this matter-of-fact and not too exciting
announcement there is another story that will run
the "housing'' a close second for "snafu" prize of
the quarter.
We have a football schedule set for next fall.
But if Mr. Kennedy waits around until the sta
dium is filled for two years, he'll celebrate the day
watching his own kids play. That is, if things con
tinue to drift as they are.
It is ail open fart that universities in our
league are paying their athletes. If not directly,
then the end result is the same. The talent, the

stars are not registered at Stanford in anywhere
near the numbers that they are heading for other
schools. Ninety thousand football fans are not
going to watch our schoolboys playing in com
petition that is above their heads.
With all respect to the fight and spirit that our
team will surely show we must face the issue.
Let's either start getting football players here or
let's get out of the league. As a three-day-a-week
newspaper columnist it is not our job to decide
which move shoidd be made.
But there are men around here who are getting
paid to make the decisions and once again they
are dodging the issues. To send our team against
the kind of teams that other schools are planning is
sheer folly.
If Stanford wants to be up there they must have
fight and go-get-'em and—to mention another mi
nor point—a few football players.
We respect the ability of every man on our
squad and will match our coach against the best.
But we feel sure that the football men now here
cannot but agree that th ? other teams are groom
ing for a first-rate battle that, will be somewhat
over our heads.
Now—does (he Administration want to "de
emphasize"? Do they want to follow the ex
ample of the University of Chicago? Or do they
want to try to fill that stadium? They will have
to take their choice. One or the other. Or what
DO they have in mind?
To let things go the way that they are now go
ing is . . . that is . . . well—typical, we suppose.
