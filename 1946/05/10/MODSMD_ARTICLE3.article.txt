# Injuns Clash with Bruins Tomorrow on Angell Field
## 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
Stanford's thinelad Indians make their last showing of the season al
Angell Field Saturday afternoon when they deploy against U.C.L.A.'s
forces at 1:45 in a P.C.C. dual meet..
The Indians take the field as definite underdogs although the Bruins
realize that they will have a tough row to hoe at (he Farm as they did
several weeks ago when they nipped Cal by a mere three points.
If the Indians can make it that close (67-G4), then they should also be
able to take the meet; but if Coach Harry Trotter's forces make a runaway
of it in several events, as they are tabbed to do, the home team will have
to be satisfied with a 12-point deficit at best.
VISITORS HAVE EDGE
Coach Jack Weiershauscr has the Cards pegged with seven firsts to
eight for the Bruins, and the seconds with five for the Farm. That adds
up to 50 points and half a dozen or so thirds put the total up to 55 or 56,
which gives tho visitors their 12-point edge.
On the track the Indians should come away with four of (he nine firsts,
although in the other five events the Bruins are figured to sweep three
whole races; while in the field the Cards are tabbed to take half the firsts
and more than half the total points.
Races the Indians are figured to take are the mile, 100, 880, and two
mile (in that order), and the discus, hiyh jump, and pole vault on the field.

► DOUBLE WINNER PICKED
At any rate, the Indians should
lead off with a victory, Frank Ga
nahl's 4:27.1] being better by 2 sec
onds than the best that U.C.L.A.'s
John Pattee has done.
Last track event, the mile relay, is
(barring mishaps) all U.C.L.A.'s.
On the field, ex - Cardinal Al
! Hoisch and teammates Don Nelson
! and Ken Solid will make it 1-2-3 in
Captain Martin Anderson should
provide the Indians with another
j victory, his 9.9 in the 100-yard dash
being two-tenths better than U.C.-
j L.A.'s Kapp has done. Kapp's best
race is the 220. where his 21.5
should pace a Bruin sweep.
The class of U.C.L.A.'s track team
will be seen in the 120-yard high
I and 220 low hurdles, where Craig
Dixon with his 14.7 and 23.5 are
expected to lead the Uclans' sweep
home.
CLOSE RACES
Two very close races will be in
the quarter and half-mile, where
Stanford's George Grimes is slated
I to lake a second to Lowry Miller in
the 440, and a first against R.dph
Gold in the 880.
