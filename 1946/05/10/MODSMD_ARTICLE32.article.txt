# Trojan Nine Invades Stanford For Two Lame Baseball Series
## 
### 
With six straight conference vie- I
tories behind them, Southern Cali
fornia's baseball team invades the
Farm this weekend to take on the j
improving but unpolished Stanford
nine in a two-game series. Starting
time for today's game is 3:00. Sat
urday's clash is slated for 3:15.
Suave Doug Essick and Tom
Kipp, another well-known man
around the Southland, appear as
likely mound choices for the Tro
jans. Essick, wild in his first ap
pearance against Stanford, has I
found the plate since to register
six victories against zero defeats.
Kipp's record for the season is !
two wins and three losses, not |
sensational.
Leading the Trojan hitters at the |
moment is Bill'Spaeter, first sacker j
who is blasting the pill at a .341
clip. In addition B. Spaeter has j
pushed 32 runs across the plate with j
his stick work.

Second man of the Southern Cal
hit parade is little Hugo Hoffman.
He is hitting .336 and has made some
circus catches at his left field post.
The other men over .300 are Bill
Crutchfield and Tom Phelps, who
play shortstop and center field re
spectively. Rounding out the squad
are A 1 Spaeter, weaker half of the
brother combination, r.t second,
Hank Workman in right field, Don
Palmer, catcher, and a third base
man named Jim Hardy.
Meanwhile, in the Stanford
camp, Ilarry Wolter is readying
Dick Flatland and Phil Wolf for
(lipping duties. Flatland looks
ready after his swell job against
U.C.L.A. and a one-hit four-in
ning effort against the San Fran
cisco Marines last Tuesday. Wolf,
although complaining of a sore
arm, also turned in a pleasing
performance against the Marines,
allowing two hits and no earned
runs in live frames.
Frank McGraw, after resting a
week and a half with a sprained
thumb, will tape it up and resume
his first string catching duties. Mac,
according to the latest reports of
the league statistician — and they
are none too late—is leading the
circuit with a hefty .438 average.
Bob Peters and Buck Brown
son, who have been cooperating
in a good share of double killings
lately, will open at second and
short. Larry Prato, definitely the
hottest hatter on the team right

now, will he at third, and Larry
Wolf will start at first.
Wolter is still experimenting in
the right field position. If the Tro
jans use a right-handed pitcher,
Dick Ahlquist, who has been sub
bing for McGraw. will start. But if
Barry comes through with a port
sider, Ray "Snowball" Winterhalter
will be the choice.
Lloyd Merriman and George Sloat
are set in the other outfield posts.
