# Cards Favored in Swim Tourney
## 
### 
Stanford enters the southern di
vision swimming tournament in
Berkeley tomorrow afternoon. Also
I comoeting will be UCLA, USC, and
California.
The Cardinals are heavy favor
ites to win this meet, as they huve
swept by all opposition this sea
son. breaking a number of rec
ords.
Last Saturday, in a dual meet
against the Blue and Gold, Bob An
derson tied the Pacific Coast record
for the 50-yard free style event, and
Don Hester broke the national in
tercollegiate mark on the 220-yard
event.
The only department that Stan
ford is weak in is diving, in which
no men are entered* other than
that event Stanford is predicted
to take first places.
When Tom Haynie was asked if
j any more records would be broken
by star aquatic performers of the
I squad, he replied confidently, "You
never can tell. Our boys have done
; wonders this season."
