# Encina Cellar Easily Swamps Jefferson
## 
### 
The second-place Encina Cellar
baseball nine clinched the right to
meet the leading Chi Psi's in the
playoffs for the championship of
League I by swamping the helpless
Jefferson team yesterday by a score
of 18-0.
The Encina men scored in every
inning but the first and had little
trouble in piling up their top-heavy
lead over a Jefferson team that
couldn't seem to hang onto the ball.
Muir for Encina pitched one-hit
ball and his teammates backed him
with heads-up fielding to make the
victory look even easier. Only one
Jefferson man got as far as third
base, and six of them struck out.
Smith Homered for the victors.
In the other League I tilt, the Phi
Psi's took an easy one from the Phi
Delta, 11-6. The Phi Psi's made all
their runs in the early innings be
fore any Phi Delt runs could cross
the plate. The Phi Delt tallies came
on only three hits as Phi Psi errors
were responsible for most of them.
Dooley and Ashley hit homers for
the winners.
The defeat leaves the Phi Delts

far in last place, with no hope of
getting out.
In the only League II tilt, the
Zeta Psi's forfeited to the Legal
Eagles. Playoffs for the champion
ships start next Thursday, with the
regular schedule finishing on Tues
day.
