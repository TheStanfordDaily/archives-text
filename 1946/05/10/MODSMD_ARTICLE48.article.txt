### 
ROME, May 9 (UP).—King Vic
tor Emmanuel gave up today the
throne he had held for nearly 46
years when he signed abdication
papers at his Naples villa and sailed
for Port Said, Egypt, in an Italian
cruiser.
The King's sudden decision and
his abrupt departure plunged the
country at once into a major politi
cal crisis and the life of the coali
tion cabinet was threatened.
Minor clashes broke out here to
night between Monarchists and Re
publicans. The royal palace was
under extra guard and it was ex
pected that increased precautions
would be taken tomorrow when the
Monarchists plan a demonstration
in favor of the throne.
One hundred Republicans put to
flight 50 Monarchists who tried to
put up posters near the Foreign Of
fice.
The crisis was intensified because
Victor Emmanuel, in signing his
abdication papers, nominated Crown
Prince Humbert as his successor, to
rule as King Humbert 11. Many be
lieve that even if Italy sticks to a
monarchy not Humbert but his
nine-year-old son, the Prince of
Naples, will be chosen.
