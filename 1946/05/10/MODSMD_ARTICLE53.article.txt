Here is the story behind Stan
ford's unexpected victory over Cal
in the Joffre Debate Wednesday
night.
Winner Torn Steege was the
team's dark horse. Local debaters
didn't know much about him.
Coach Leland T. Chapin discovered

him in a class, tested him in the Pa
cific Forensic League tourney last
month, and trained him for the
Joffre.
Squad members Carol Newton
and Wallace IVlcCall could be re
lied upon for a dependable per
formance, but Steege was the big
question mark. Practice debates
revealed his quick mind while
leaving some doubts as to his de
livery. When the team left for
Berkeley it was hopeful but not
expectant of defeating Cal's Jua
nita Olson, last year's Joffre win
ner.
Yet, before an enthusiastic audi
ence of over 500, coming from all
parts of the state to hear the Big

Debate, and before five prominent
judges, including the Chief Justice
of the California Supreme Court,
Phil S. Gibson, the Farm's dark
; horse quickly became its white hope
and went on to upset the favorite.
Powerful in his analysis, well-in
j formed, eloquent, and persuasive,
Steege argued against the resolu
j tion that France should join a
' Western European bloc. He showed
that blocs lead to war, that France
needs help from both the East and
the West, and that it was therefore
to her best interest to remain neu
tral.
Ably supported by McCall, and
stimulated by Miss Newton, who
took the other side of the ques
tion, Steege captured the Mc
daille Joffre and became the 2(>th
Stanfordite to defeat the Blue and
Gold. Ilis victory ties the series,
j started in 1804, at 2(>-2(>.
Once again Coach Chapin has
shown his ability to pick a winner.
He had sent Pat Carson and McCall,
who had never debated for Stanford
before, to Denver last winter, and
they returned as one of the best

teams in the country, undefeated,
with a decisive victory over the
University of Chicago and an un- ,
expected tie with SC., the school
that boasts Western debate lead
ership.
Mr. Chapin sent Steege to the j
discussion-debate at Stockton last :
April and saw him again win top i
honors. He then entered the quiet, '
pre-legal sophomore from San '
Francisco in the traditional clash j
with Cal, although Steege had had 1
little experience with that style of i
debating.
The result: Stanford's first JofTre
victory since 1943, snapping Cal's
winning streak at two.
