LABOR DAY: Jeans, plaid shirts,
hoes, and paint brushes are standard
paraphernalia for the Con Home's
annual Labor Day. For 23 years a
Stanford habit, the Day is designed
to aid Mrs. Atwood, volunteer gar
dener Sam McDonald, and the staff
of the Convalescent Home in the
upkeep of the grounds.
This year toys will be painted; the
tree house repaired; the victory gar
den tended; hoeing, raking, weeding,
and carpentry done. Even the frail
est of Stanford Farm-hands are eli
gible to complement their contribu
tions in the week-long drive by an
afternoon's work to make more pleas
ant the home for California's con
valescent children.

position of this page is Lyle Davis,
chairman of the off-campus collec
tions for this year's drive.)

ABOUT THE CON HOME â€”In
1917, under the leadership of Dr. D.
Charles Gardner, a summer home
for children was founded on campus
by interested students. For two years
the organization flourished under
their enthusiastic care, and in 1919
was converted into a home for con
valescents. With the sanction of the
University Board of Trustees, the
Home in 1920 was established on the
site of the Stanfords' home.
Housing 60 children, the Home
consists of two units for bed patients,
and one auxiliary unit for the "run
abouts." For those children who are
well enough to make use of them,
there are a clubhouse for the boys;
a tree house for the girls; a doll
house, furnished in miniature; and
in the shady play yard, swings,
slides, and a sand box.
