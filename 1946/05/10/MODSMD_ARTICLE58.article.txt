FOOD FOR FATIGUED WORK
ERS will be served at the end of the
afternoon's work. Throughout the
day, concessions traditionally sell
fruit, ice cream, and cokes to the
student workers, profits from the
sales going to the drive. The Stan
ford band plays music to accompany
the buzz of saws, the hacking of
rakes and hoes, the laughter of the
children who watch from the sun
porch. When the last heap of rub
bish has been deposited in the Con
Home trash barrels, workers relax
under the elms for a barbecue. This
year, for the first time since the war's
beginning, barbecued meat will be
served.
Stanford songs will be sung
around the fire, putting the finishing
touches to the second day of the
traditional spring guarter drive.

FOUR THOUSAND STANFORD
STUDENTS and half of Palo Alto
can't be wrong â€” for together last
year they contributed more than
$8,000 to the annual Convalescent
Home Drive held on campus.
Perhaps no other part of the Uni
versity and its surroundings ex
presses so well the spirit of the
Farm and its founders as the
group of buildings called from its
cumbersome title, Stanford Conva
lescent Home, "the Con Home." For
nearly 26 years the Con Home has
been a part of Stanford's pride and
its activities, and though supported
in large part by the Community
Chest and by volunteer groups in
the district, has been known as
"Stanford's own charity."
