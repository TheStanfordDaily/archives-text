The report by the President of
the student body at California,
Dick Rowson, that California
students were not involved in
the recent Axe stealing incident
appears to have little founda
tion, in light of a Daily "investi
gation" on the Cal campus yes
• terday. Many Cal students
openly admitted knowing the
people responsible for the theft,
although refusing to mention
| names.
Paul Lazarus, Daily Califor
nian sports writer and special
I correspondent for the San
! Francisco Chronicle, stated,
"The Axe is in Berkeley. I know
: the guys who did it, but they're
; not talking." Lazarus refused to
| reveal any additional informa
j iion.
Further evidence of Cal's
I "guilt" was found in an article
! which appeared in the Berkeley
1 Gazette. The Gazette claimed
that the thieves brought the Axe
. to the sports editor of that paper,
, claiming the pressure was "too
I hot." The paper refused to take
i the famed trophy, not wishing
j to be involved in the incident.
' The sports editor did not name
j the students bu.t claimed they
were non-athletes.
The article further asserted
that only three students knew
where the Axe was hidden.
