# Roundup Nets $2,200 Total
## 
### 
Over $2,200 has been contributed
to "Heifers for Relief," Chairman A 1
Strain reported last night. This is
enough to buy 15 heifers in addition
to the four which have already been
given to the "roundup." It is esti
mated that these 19 heifers can save
the lives of 190 European children.
The total may be raised to 20
heifers, with the consequent saving
of ten more lives, when reports ar
rive from the six halls that have not
yet turned in their results: Cub
bcrley, Ruble 2C, Roth, Lincoln,
Pierce, and Taylor.
Official application blanks were
mailed last night to students who
signed up at the May 1 meeting as
interested in traveling on heifer
boats this summer. Those who
arc interested in this work, hut
have not yet signed up, may ob
tain application blanks from Bob
Warnock or Jack Brown at the
Cellar, or else they may contact
Al Strain.
Anyone who can contribute a
live heifer may contact Craig
Vittctoe, phone 87(>0.
" 'Heifers for Relief' was a vol
untary campaign conducted at the
wish of the students themselves,
and as such we feel that it. was
highly successful," Strain said. "Its
success was due to hours of time
and effort voluntarily put. into its
promotion by interested students, as
well as to the wholehearted back
ing of Stanford in general."
