# Operators, Lewis Make No Decision

### 
WASHINGTON, May 12 (UP). |
â€”Soft coal operators and the
United Mine Workers (AFL)
spent two hours in an unusual
but unproductive Sunday nego- j
tiating session today on the eve
of a resumption of mining which I
ends a six-week strike in the
coal fields.
Although representatives of both
sides indicated no break was ex
pected, federal mediators kept the
pressure on in an effort to meet
President Truman's deadline Wed
nesday for a new eontratc.
And even if that deadline is j
missed, the government represen
tatives were pressing for an agree
ment to prevent another industry
wide shutdown after the two-week j
truce which begins tomorrow. ;
UiVIW President John L. Lewis is- ,
sued the back-to-work order Fri- :
day to head oil' a national indus
trial breakdown.
After today's session, mediators |
Edward F. McGrady and Paul W. 1
Fuller declined 1o discuss the pros- i
pects for meeting the Wednesday |
deadline. Lewis and management |
also declined to comment.
The operators, who have been con- <
fcrring among themselves over an i
issue which lias snagged the nego- J
tiations for two weeks, were report
ed to have asked a recess until to- j
morrow shortly after the session be- |
gan. Bui they remained at there- j
quest of the mediators and spent
most of the time in a management
caucus.
The issue which the operators
have been discussing is a second
ary dispute over payment of back
overtime claims estimated at more
than $.'>,000,000 for the industry as
a whole. Lewis was reported to |
have demanded payment of the j
claims as a condition of further j
negotiations.
Most of the bituminous mines j
were expectcd to reopen tomorrow |
under Lewis' two-week truce or- |
der. With the government, exercis- |
ing tight controls over distribution, ;
the output of the mines will pre- I
vent interruption of vital services j
and permit some relief for industry. [
