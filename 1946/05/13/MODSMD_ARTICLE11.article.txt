# 'East Lynne' Audience Shifts from Cynicism To Seriousness as Melodrama Nears Climax
## 
### 
"East Lynne," essentially played
| to the spirit of the original mclo
! drama, ground through love, mur
der, two deaths, and repentance
! Friday and Saturday nights in a
| consistently smooth production.
The Memorial Auditorium audi
j once, prepared to jeer at 1860 tears
I and crises, found there were erno-
I lions and scenes that couldn't be
hissed.
"More to be pitied than cen
sured," Patricia Nelson as Lady Isa
| bel played the death scene of her
j son, Little William, to a noticeably
i quiet audience. Jonathan Hadley,
| the hair-parted-in-the-middle hus
j band, drew laughs for initially over
j noble lines, but got sympathy by
! Act 111. There was a noticeable
shift in audience reaction from cyn
| icism to a degree of seriousness.
MENACING VILLAIN
Far from a Groucho Marx vil
j lain. Hal Millen as the thoroughly
, bad Sir Francis Levison was a men

ace who dominated the stage in ev
ery scene in which he appeared.
The sheer size and lithe stalking
quality of Millen. played against
the anxiety and sweetness of Miss
Neilson, was a bit of casting of
which even Mrs. Henry Wood, au
thor of the original story, might
have approved.
Between scenes close harmony by
Don Hostetler, John Haynes, Fred
erick Simmons, and Marjorie
Forkncr, Jackie Woolf, and Paula
Wilbur sustained the mood of "East
Lynne" with such assertions as
"With All Her Faults I Love Her
Still" and "She Is More to Be Pitied
than Censured."
BURLESQUE OLIOS
The olios, following "East Lynne"
at "positively no extra cost what
soever," followed the burlesque
lflth century tradition with "Trav
eling Around," "Shout Brother
Shout," and Jane Frasier's original
number, "One Little Sin Leads to
Another," sung by Rena Jean Black

with her usual effective showman
ship.
"The Hairy-Chested Men," de
termined tumblers, were watched
closely by the bc-spangled, bored
Miss Murray Stirton, who provokes
more laughs by adjusting her tights
once than many comedians achieve
in an evening of trying.
"DWOON"
Miss Jean Houssels, regretting
the passing of the last bald-head
ed "Dwnon" (D-W-O-O-N) whs
hauntingly wide-eyed. "My Sweet
heart's the Man in the Moon" and
"Just a Bird in a Gilded Cage"
were polished presentations, and
"Under the Sheltering Palms" by
Newt Arnold, Jane Saulsbery, and
Jack Taylor had enthusiasm that |
carried to the audience.
A product of fast and determined |
work, the 1946 Spring Show was j
smoothly presented and directed by j
Jan Swan assisted by Lorna Rob
ertson and Bill Melton.â€”Mary Ellen >
