J Original music and student devel
| oped numbers interpreted in mod
ern dance technique will .spotlight
j the Tuesday Evening Series tomor
row night when Orchesis members
I and apprentices present the Orchesis
Anual Spring Dance Concert in the
Memorial Auditorium at 7:30.
"The dances for the concert are
original, a result of class work in
Dance Composition and Advanced
Modern Dance and Production, and
represent each member's own choice
for interpretation and development
into studies and dances," states Mrs.
Miriam Lidster, concert director and
advisor to Orchesis.
As outlined by Mrs. Lidster stu
| dents have interpreted their ideas
into studies based on (1) music,
the mood and style of music as
means of direct interpretation for
choreography, (2) the spoken word,
! (3) the musical form, and (4) a
theme or idea developed complete
( ly in true dance movement and
then completed for stage prcsenta
i tion by the addition of original nui
j sic or percussive accompaniment.
Five folk songs, recorded by Burl
! Ives and Richard Dyer-Bennett,
! famed for their interpretations of
cowboy songs and ballads respective
ly, have keen choreographed to il
lustrate the first form. These include
! English, American, Australian, and
I cowboy ballads.
Two dances using a musical form
as their direct basis will be "And
Leave It Not Without a Prayer,"
i choreographed by Betty Jane Voss
and danced to Part I, Sacred Dance
lof Debussy's Sacred and Profane;
! and the "Persistence of Memory," "a
J study in the cross rhythms or cross
j currents of modern minds and civil
i izations," also choreographed by
Betty Jane Voss.
"Banisiictf ' could only have
been conceived by a college stu
dent who is still young enough to
remember her adolescent feelings
vividly," said Mrs. Lidster of the
rr.Mice elloijcographcd by Leslie
Jones which illustrates the fourth
mode of interpretation. This dance,
consisting of four parts "Adolcs
-1 cence and Realization," "Frenzy,"
"Lament," and "Maturity and
Transcendence" is a deep psycho
logical study.
Original music for the concert has
been written by Joan Whit more Lo
| max, '44, the concert's pianist, and
students Margo Sorzano, AI Novi
coff, and Ted Hoffman.
