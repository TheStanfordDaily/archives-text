# Stanford's Sixty Children
## 
### 
To maintain four beds the year round for
convalescent children the committee of the
campus Con Home Drive is asking this week
thi: > dollars from every Stanford student.
o:ted by Stanford contributions and
'hanties, the Home looks to us once more
to give schooling, playthings, food, and af
tf noons-in-the-sun to four ailing children.
On Labor Day the kids will want to see us
r i, *h*" ; r home. They have no big
*rah rr- -t';ey likn the
~ u ga.ig that always gives them a
howdy, a push in the swing, a tune from the
band, and a day of work on the grounds.
Because there are many children at the
Home who are unable to make use of the tree
house, or the sand box, or the swings, toys
are being asked from students as gifts to the
bed patients.

There you have it. The rest of the week's
program, in support of the Home consists of
pitching pennies at the Soph Carnival, "tying
one on for the kiddies" (a tag, that is), eating
strawberries at the Brunch, or whacking a
mean volleyball in the present tournament.
There's a lot of talk circulating about the
mess our world has gotten into a lot more
about improving the lot of DP's and racial
minorities and the starving of Europe and
A.sia. Not too much beyond such talk is over
- ccmplished, except when the doors of op
portunity are swung wide open for action. . . .
the way they are this week at the Con Home.
There are 60 kids out at the Home, the under
privileged of our community. We can give
them the way of life appropriate to childhood,
a chance at a balanced, mature adulthood,
merely by handing out three dollars and a
little time to them this week.— BMV
