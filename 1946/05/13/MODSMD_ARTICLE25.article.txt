A.S.S.U. elections come up next week and
with them comes our problem of deciding on
one among seveial candidates for each of
fice a stickler for new and returned students
who know relatively few people now at Stan
fcr.l, and who have no bases on which to
judge the candidates' relative abilities.
That's why Election Board Chairman Carl
Br.rke asked Excom to sanction limited elec
tioneering by candidates for the coming elec
tions. And that's why The Daily is quick to
endorse the suggestion.
Although campaigning has been consid
ered taboo at Stanford for many years, it has
advantages that, in times like these, cannot
be offset by the perfectly legitimate reasons
for enforcing the ban on electioneering.
As defined by Excom, campaigning in this
election would forbid financial expense
(thereby prohibiting printing of signs) and

the voicing of remarks that tend to disparage
other candidates.
With limitations such as these, electioneer
ing becomes a harmless and advantageous
way of helping students to know the candi
dates, and to learn, to some extent, their abili
ties to fill the offices they seek. It means that
candidates will be able to go to individual liv
ing groups to speak to students there in a
well-warranted attempt to acquaint them
selves and their purposes with the student
body.
Although old-timers may scorn the sugges
tion, it is one to be considered seriously now.
Stanford is going through an important
change in the organization of its student
body. The officers we elect to responsible
positions next year must be known by the
students and must have their wholehearted
backing if we are to make the transition suc
cessfully.â€”M.S.
