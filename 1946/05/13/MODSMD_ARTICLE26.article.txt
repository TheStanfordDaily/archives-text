A Me ntion of Mr. Stan Shpetner:
Dear Stan.—Sir, to put it mildly, you are all wet.
If v,o have ever heard a defeatest attitude in our
life, you have it. We are referring to your "Who
Told You" column of last Friday's Daily. Somebody
must have told you, and the trouble is you listened.
1 •• re, raise Ihe barriers, bring in all the tramp
you can find. Feed them, pay them,
jrr.mper them, and hold them apart from the rest
<>112 the student body. Stop and think, Mr. Shpet
ner is that what you want?
Have you checked on Stanford's prewar athletic
standing lately? It wasn't bad, not bad at all. In
i u tit took a war before SC could tie our record in
ti ■ Rose Bowl. There is only,one team in the Coast.
Conference that has defeated us more than we have
defeated them. Not whom you thought at all. It
was Washington State.
And to go further, Stan, why is SC held to such
■ :'orn around these parts? Mainly, because they
ha o followed exactly the same policies that you
have asked us to follow.
This University has had a definite policy since

its inception. To play ball here, a man has always
had to prove that he can do the schoolwork, and
maintain a "C" average. This means that all of
the hoys on the team are members of the Student
Body. It is our team, because the boys on it are
our boys.
Yes, Stan, we think you have the wrong idea the
whole way through. And we are not first-quarter,
do-or-die Freshmen either. We are just people that
like Stanford. We like the way it is now, and we
want, it to continue the way it is. We know this, if
Stanford lets flown the bars and goes professional,
the last stronghold of amateur athletics on the Pa
cific Coast will be gone. And Stan, we don't think
you really want that, do you?
Next fall will be the test, and we have an idea
our "schoolboys" will make you a little sorry for
all of the nasty aspersions you have cast their
way. But win or lose, it will be a Stanford team,
made up of Stanford boys, and this small per
centage ol' student body will be mighty proud of
them.—Two Stanford Vets

whole way through. And we are not first-quarter,
do-or-die Freshmen either. We are just people that
like Stanford. We like the way it is now, and we
want, it to continue the way it is. We know this, if
Stanford lets flown the bars and goes professional,
the last stronghold of amateur athletics on the Pa
cific Coast will be gone. And Stan, we don't think
you really want that, do you?
Next fall will be the test, and we have an idea
our "schoolboys" will make you a little sorry for
all of the nasty aspersions you have cast their
way. But win or lose, it will be a Stanford team,
made up of Stanford boys, and this small per
centage ol' student body will be mighty proud of
them.—Two Stanford Vets
A Me ntion of Mr. Stan Shpetner:
Dear Stan.—Sir, to put it mildly, you are all wet.
If v,o have ever heard a defeatest attitude in our
life, you have it. We are referring to your "Who
Told You" column of last Friday's Daily. Somebody
must have told you, and the trouble is you listened.
1 •• re, raise Ihe barriers, bring in all the tramp
you can find. Feed them, pay them,
jrr.mper them, and hold them apart from the rest
<>112 the student body. Stop and think, Mr. Shpet
ner is that what you want?
Have you checked on Stanford's prewar athletic
standing lately? It wasn't bad, not bad at all. In
i u tit took a war before SC could tie our record in
ti ■ Rose Bowl. There is only,one team in the Coast.
Conference that has defeated us more than we have
defeated them. Not whom you thought at all. It
was Washington State.
And to go further, Stan, why is SC held to such
■ :'orn around these parts? Mainly, because they
ha o followed exactly the same policies that you
have asked us to follow.
This University has had a definite policy since

its inception. To play ball here, a man has always
had to prove that he can do the schoolwork, and
maintain a "C" average. This means that all of
the hoys on the team are members of the Student
Body. It is our team, because the boys on it are
our boys.
Yes, Stan, we think you have the wrong idea the
whole way through. And we are not first-quarter,
do-or-die Freshmen either. We are just people that
like Stanford. We like the way it is now, and we
want, it to continue the way it is. We know this, if
Stanford lets flown the bars and goes professional,
the last stronghold of amateur athletics on the Pa
cific Coast will be gone. And Stan, we don't think
you really want that, do you?
Next fall will be the test, and we have an idea
our "schoolboys" will make you a little sorry for
all of the nasty aspersions you have cast their
way. But win or lose, it will be a Stanford team,
made up of Stanford boys, and this small per
centage ol' student body will be mighty proud of
them.—Two Stanford Vets
