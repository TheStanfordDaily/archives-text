We don't wish to flay a dead horse, as the saying
rons, but this one deserves a few more kicks.
This all appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle
but we think that it is worth repeating just in case
you didn't see it at first.
Last Thursday a Navy Court-martial hoard
acquitted Navy officer Lt. Charles A. Crippen of
striking two enlisted shore patrol. They based
their acquittal on the fact that the officer—and
j.-et this—was too drunk to he responsible for his
actions. Lt. Crippen got off scot-free.
When we first saw that one, it made our ex-en
listed blood boil. How many enlisted sailors have
ever gotten away from a court-martial because they
had been too drunk to know what they were doing?
But as Hobt. Browning was oft heard to say "the
best is yet to come."
On Friday the same court (composed of Captain
Symington, Captain Raquet, Captain Herty, Captain
Traua, and Commander (how did he get in there)
Cury met. Enlisted man William F. Macauley ap
peared before them. He was found guilty of strik
ing a superior officer. Testimony showed that he
was drunk at the time.
But how do the court make this one jive? Well,
il ain't easy, hut they say that officer Crippen was
drunker than enlisted man Macauley and there
fore Crippen didn't know what he was doing and
Mocauley did.
We do not have any court-martial records avail-

able but we'll bet that there are plenty of cases
where enlisted men —too drunk to know wh;it tlx y
were doing got. off scot-free.
Lemme take a drag on that weed.
Well, Gen. Stilwell says there isn't any caste sys
tem. And besides he says you have got to have dis
cipline. You tell 'em, Gen'l.

Talking about generals. N«<t that we can ! think
of anything better.
A Mr. Chennault who it appears was at one time
in the army had his picture in the newspapers. Al
though Mr. Chennault is a civilian, the caption un
der his pix read: "Major Gen'l Chennault."
Mr, Chennault told the newspaper men in real
hush-hush terms that "SOMKONE" (her-heh
hth) is supplying the Chinese Red Army with
arms. llow about that, says Mr. Chennault. Then
he goes on to tell us not to worry. The Central
government's army will win out. All their divi
sions supplied by the U.S. Army are right there
and ready to go.
Assume that "SOMEONE" is supplying the Chi
nese Reds. Of course Mr. Chennault knows all
about this. It is o.k. for us to supply or.e .side, but
the knick is when someone else is alleged to he
supplying the other side.
Well j| the sun comes out we'll go to the beach.
We don't even wear a top. Then everyone can see
where our PFC strip is tatooed on.
