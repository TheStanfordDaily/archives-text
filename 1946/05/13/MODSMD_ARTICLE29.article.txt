# Psychology Wins Again on Screen
## 
### 
"Salome had her seven veils. So
do you and I." Thus says the psy
chiatrist at "The Seventh Veil's" in
ception. The latter veils, though,
exist in our minds, this psycho
something-or'-other says, and it, is
his duly to tear them away.
This process could be a very la
borious and boring task. Yet "The
Seventh Veil" is one of the best of
the British films to be shown to
American audiences. Maybe it's
because of the carefully restrained
characterizations of Ann Todd and
James Mason in their difficult star
ling assignments; perhaps it's due
to the amazing fluidity with which
the film moves when Compared with
the average British product.
ENHANCING EFFECT
Quite possibly the total effect is
enhanced by the frequent appear
ances of the London Symphony Or
chestra, which, certain friends of
mine say, we should all admire.
"The Seventh Veil" is pretty
much for the horse-and-earriage
trade, which includes, of course, the
thousands of intellectuals on this
campus. The plot narrates the
troubles of a frustrated concert pi
anist (Ann Todd) who is browbeat
en by a domineering guardian
(James Mason) into a life of sharps

and flats and little else.
From this point the story goes off
on some sort of a tangent as Miss
Todd undergoes a mental collapse
and the psychiatrists step in and
take the film over. Upshot of the |
whole thing is that Miss Todd must j
choose between her three lovers,
which should be pleasing to soap
box opera fans.
NICE TO HAVE AROUND
It's nice to have refined, eham- j
ber-music entertainment like this j
around, but I oft en wonder if peo
ple don't like these cultured dishes j
just because they have read a re-|
view in the New Yorker which
says they are supposed to revel in j
this type of edification.
I suppose, however, it's just lie
cause "The Seventh Veil" is on the j
level of a Bach string quartet, while
this reviewer can never seem to rise
above the "Stick Out Your Can,
Here Comes the Garbage Man"
grade, as played at the Deacon Club i
up the highway.
The second picture, "Smooth as
Silk," tells of murder in the ranks
of the theatrical profession. Kent
Taylor, Virginia Grey, and a whole
cast of others whose names aren't in
very big lights any mora are pres
