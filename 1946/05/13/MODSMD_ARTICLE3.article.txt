# Negotiations Collapse For India's Independence
## 
### 
LONDON, May 12 (UP). â€”An official communique announced tonight
that negotiations to establish India as an independent state had collapsed.
Reports from India said a British cabinet mission would return to London.
Informed sources said the mission might leave behind a proposed In
dian constitution providing for five years of semi-independent government

to give the Indians time to reconcile
their differences.
The five-year interim government
was believed to have been the plan
Sir Stafford Cripps had in mind
when he indicated recently the mis
sion had a new proposal ready if
Indian leaders could not agree.
No specific reason for the nego
tiations collapsing was given, and
the New Delhi radio,said both the
Moslem League and the Nationalist
India Congress party had agreed
that the conference proceedings
would "be treated as confidential
for the time being."
It was well known, however, that
unshakeable Moslem demands for
a separate Moslem state (Pakistan)
have been unalterably opposed by
the powerful Hindu Congress party.
The objective of the mission
which arrived in New Delhi seven
weeks ago was a negotiated settle
ment between the two opposing
parties rather than a settlement
imposed by the British.
The mission included Cripps,
president of the Board of Trade,
whose wartime efforts to reach a
compromise in 1942 also failed; Lord
Pcthick - Lawrence, Secretary of
State for India; and A. V. Alexan
der, First Lord of the Admiralty.
