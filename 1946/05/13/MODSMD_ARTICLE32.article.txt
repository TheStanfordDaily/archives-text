# Paly Safety Drive Begins
## 
### 
A concentrated safety drive is
now being carried on by the City
of Palo Alto in order to check vio
lation of speed laws, parking regu
lations, and jay-walking.
At the request of many Stanford
students who come from other vi
cinities, the police court has sub
mitted some of the most important
regulations to be published and
brought to attention.
Many Stanford students do not
realize that there is a law against
jay-walking and that violators are
fined $1. Another law frequently
broken is the regulation against
double parking. Double parking
with someone in the car and the
motor running is legal on Univer
sity Avenue only. It is forbidden
under any circumstances on any
other street and the line is $1.
Speed laws are strictly enforced
and fines are scheduled according
to the danger of the street and
speeds per hour. Too much speed
ing occurs on residential streets,
which are the most dangerous and
bring the heaviest fines.
' Any student wishing to see the
full schedule of violations and fines
may see it in Judge Springer's
office in the police court, or a small
copy of it which will be posted in
the Daily Shack.
