# Cardinal Fielders Give Pitchers Poor Support; S.C. Wins Weekend Series
## 
### STU MILLAR 
Two Stanford hurlers pitched their hearts out last
weekend against the Southern California baseball
team, but the Cards still dropped both games to the
Trojans. Diek Flatland went the route in the first
contest, spacing nine hits evenly, and the Trojans won '
bv a top-heavy 9 to 3 score.
Because thy Cards committed seven errors. Only !
(wo of the nine S.C. runs were earned.
The next day Phil Wolf, sore arm and all, went out
to face the Trojan sluggers and gave up eleven hits. |
That is quite a lot of hits, and the Trojans took ad- j
vantage of them for five earned runs.
But the Cards scored six earned runs and thus j
would have beaten the Trojans except for the fact that j
the Cards made five errors and allowed two un
earned runs, making 11i" final score 7 to (> in favor
of Troy.
The eleven errors for the series by the Stanford
ball club seems to show a lack of hustle which is so
needed by a winning team.
Which is too bad, because Stanford possesses two |
of the finest hurlers in the loop in Dick Flatland and j
Phil Wolf. These men are capable of winning games j
for Stanford, and Stanford's hitters possess enough I
power at bat to insure enough runs.
As to how the scores were made. In the third in- <
ning of Friday's game, the Trojans went to the front !
with four runs on two hits by Palmer and Phelps and j
three Stanford errors. With this advantage, S.C. went '

easily on picking up counters here and there as the
game pi ogressed, aware that they had made enough
to win.
With the exception of Bill Crutchfield's triple, all
of the S.C. hits were of the scratchy variety, too. Out
standing fielding feat of the day was Buck Brownson's.
Buck, Stanford's shortstop, went yards to his right on
Crutchfiold's hot grounder, made a sensational back
hand pickup, and made the long, off-balance throw
to first to nip the batter.
The next day, Stanford looked like it was going
to take a ball game. In the first inning George Sloat
singled and Larrupin Lloyd Merriman slashed a long
home run out to put Stanford in a 2 to 0 lead. But five
Trojan hits in the next two innings accounted for three
runs and a one-run lead for Troy. The locals tied it
up in the tilth when Merriman walked, advanced on
McGraw's sacrifice and scored on Larry Prato's clutch
single.
Then came three errors in one inning and two
more runs for Southern Cal. Again the Cards came
back to tie the game. Two singles and three walks by
Bullet Bob Webster —wHo by the way walked nine
and struck out seven —summed up to two runs. The
chances for victory looked good until Ned Haskell
came in and cooled the rally.
And in the ninth, with the scored tied at five and
five, Troy scored two runs on three hits. Stanford
briefly rallied but fell one run short of sending the
game into extra innings.
