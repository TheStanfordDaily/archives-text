# Bruin Tracksters Prove Too Strong for Surprising Locals
## 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
Stanford's Indians, falling a little short of giving their all or their best,
also fell a little short of winning a track meet Saturday afternoon when
they came up on the short end of a 76 5/6 to 54 1/6 tally at Angell Field
against U.C.L.A.'s Bruins.
With the surprises the Indians pulled, and there were several, the
score could have been much closer, had not the I'clans retaliated m kind
by showing up strongly where they weren't supposed to have too much

strength.
U.C.L.A. managed to sweep one
event out of the four they were
supposed to, which coupled with
what the Cards should have done
in other events would have made
the count somewhat closer than the
20-odd points difference. However,
such things are better guessed at
than known.
The Indians tallied only four
firsts and nine seconds against
the Southlanders, all four of the
winnings being as expected, while
showing more speed than was ex
pected particularly with a couple
of second places in the 220 and
low hurdles.
Captain Martin Anderson was the
meet's high point man, taking a first
place in the hundred in 9.9, win
ning over U.C.L.A.'s A 1 Kapp. who
in turn was almost beaten by A 1
Vierthaler; a tie for first with Bill
Larson in the pole vault at 12 It.
8 in.; and a second in the 220 be
hind Kapp's 22.2.
According to the tab sheet. An
derson wasn't supposed to come
in second, for U.C.L.A. has no less
than five sprinters who had gone
the furlong in several tenths less
than the Farm captain. Likewise,
Carl HefTncr's taking a tie for
third in the same race, for the
same reason.
A 1 Vierthaler pulled the other
surprise, taking a second to Craig
Dixon in the 220-yard low hurdles,
beating out Don Nelson who was
figured for second. And still an
other surprise was pulled when
Jack Campbell broadjumped over
22 feet for a second behind Nelson.
Incidentally, the Bruins had four
men with better distances in that
pvpnt.

The first Indian victory came, as
expected, in the mile when Frank
Ganahl breezed home in the slow
time of 4:33.1, holding plenty in re
serve for the two-mile. The race
was practically a default as only
Ganahl, U.C.L.A.'s Tom Keagan,
and Stanford's Will Schaupp were
entered and finished in that order.
fn (he two-mile, however, Ga
nalil ran a poorly paced race, let
ting Bruin John Pattee get too
far ahead to he caught. At the
start of the eighth lap Pattee held
a 75-yard lead on the Indian, and
crossed the finish line 3(1 yards
ahead, dead on his feet. Pattee's
time was his fastest of his career,
being !):4(!.7 with Ganahl, who
had more left than he thought,
closing fast about five seconds
later.
Last Farm win came in the high
jump where Ed Luce went over at
6 ft. 3 in., tops for the year on the
home field. U.C.L.A.'s Tom Hewitt,
a 5 ft. 10 in. jumper, took second
at that figure, leaving Mars Hjelte
and Don Lowe, both of whom have
gone higher than Hewitt, tied with
U.C.L.A.'s Slu Bowie at 5 ft. 8 in.
In the middle distances, Lowry
Miller beat out A 1 Wilkins to
take the 140 in 50.2, with Farm
hand Dick Hin/e coming through
with a fast finish to take third.
U.C.L.A.'s Kalph Gold continued
his unbeaten ways as he turned
in a 1:50 4 in the SSO to easily
defeat Stanford's George Grimes.
AI Iloluhar, who became eligible
the day of the meet and went as
an added starter for the Farm,
took third. t
Dixon and Hoxie Griswold were
the high point men for U.C.L.A.,
Dixon taking both hurdles in 14.8
"and 24.2, the highs being the only
race th? Bruins swept. Griswold
was the boy who held up U.C.L.A.'s
end, and well he did it too, for it
was in the weights that the Indians
fell down the hardest.

Dixon and Hoxie Griswold were
the high point men for U.C.L.A.,
Dixon taking both hurdles in 14.8

end, and well he did it too, for it

Stanford's Indians, falling a little short of giving their all or their best,
also fell a little short of winning a track meet Saturday afternoon when
they came up on the short end of a 76 5/6 to 54 1/6 tally at Angell Field
against U.C.L.A.'s Bruins.
With the surprises the Indians pulled, and there were several, the
score could have been much closer, had not the I'clans retaliated m kind
by showing up strongly where they weren't supposed to have too much

strength.
U.C.L.A. managed to sweep one
event out of the four they were
supposed to, which coupled with
what the Cards should have done
in other events would have made
the count somewhat closer than the
20-odd points difference. However,
such things are better guessed at
than known.
The Indians tallied only four
firsts and nine seconds against
the Southlanders, all four of the
winnings being as expected, while
showing more speed than was ex
pected particularly with a couple
of second places in the 220 and
low hurdles.
Captain Martin Anderson was the
meet's high point man, taking a first
place in the hundred in 9.9, win

According to the tab sheet. An
derson wasn't supposed to come
in second, for U.C.L.A. has no less
than five sprinters who had gone
the furlong in several tenths less
than the Farm captain. Likewise,
Carl HefTncr's taking a tie for
third in the same race, for the
same reason.
A 1 Vierthaler pulled the other
surprise, taking a second to Craig
Dixon in the 220-yard low hurdles,
beating out Don Nelson who was
figured for second. And still an
other surprise was pulled when
Jack Campbell broadjumped over
22 feet for a second behind Nelson.
Incidentally, the Bruins had four
men with better distances in that
pvpnt.

The first Indian victory came, as
expected, in the mile when Frank
Ganahl breezed home in the slow
time of 4:33.1, holding plenty in re
serve for the two-mile. The race
was practically a default as only
Ganahl, U.C.L.A.'s Tom Keagan,
and Stanford's Will Schaupp were
entered and finished in that order.
fn (he two-mile, however, Ga
nalil ran a poorly paced race, let
ting Bruin John Pattee get too
far ahead to he caught. At the
start of the eighth lap Pattee held
a 75-yard lead on the Indian, and
crossed the finish line 3(1 yards
ahead, dead on his feet. Pattee's
time was his fastest of his career,
being !):4(!.7 with Ganahl, who
had more left than he thought,
closing fast about five seconds
later.
Last Farm win came in the high
jump where Ed Luce went over at
6 ft. 3 in., tops for the year on the
home field. U.C.L.A.'s Tom Hewitt,
a 5 ft. 10 in. jumper, took second
at that figure, leaving Mars Hjelte
and Don Lowe, both of whom have
gone higher than Hewitt, tied with
U.C.L.A.'s Slu Bowie at 5 ft. 8 in.
In the middle distances, Lowry
Miller beat out A 1 Wilkins to
take the 140 in 50.2, with Farm
hand Dick Hin/e coming through

Stanford's Indians, falling a little short of giving their all or their best,
also fell a little short of winning a track meet Saturday afternoon when
they came up on the short end of a 76 5/6 to 54 1/6 tally at Angell Field
against U.C.L.A.'s Bruins.
With the surprises the Indians pulled, and there were several, the
score could have been much closer, had not the I'clans retaliated m kind
by showing up strongly where they weren't supposed to have too much

strength.
U.C.L.A. managed to sweep one
event out of the four they were
supposed to, which coupled with
what the Cards should have done
in other events would have made
the count somewhat closer than the
20-odd points difference. However,
such things are better guessed at
than known.
The Indians tallied only four
firsts and nine seconds against
the Southlanders, all four of the
winnings being as expected, while
showing more speed than was ex
pected particularly with a couple
of second places in the 220 and
low hurdles.
Captain Martin Anderson was the
meet's high point man, taking a first
place in the hundred in 9.9, win
ning over U.C.L.A.'s A 1 Kapp. who
in turn was almost beaten by A 1
Vierthaler; a tie for first with Bill
Larson in the pole vault at 12 It.
8 in.; and a second in the 220 be
hind Kapp's 22.2.
According to the tab sheet. An
derson wasn't supposed to come
in second, for U.C.L.A. has no less
than five sprinters who had gone
the furlong in several tenths less
than the Farm captain. Likewise,
Carl HefTncr's taking a tie for
third in the same race, for the
same reason.
A 1 Vierthaler pulled the other
surprise, taking a second to Craig
Dixon in the 220-yard low hurdles,
beating out Don Nelson who was
figured for second. And still an
other surprise was pulled when
Jack Campbell broadjumped over
22 feet for a second behind Nelson.
Incidentally, the Bruins had four
men with better distances in that
pvpnt.

The first Indian victory came, as
expected, in the mile when Frank
Ganahl breezed home in the slow
time of 4:33.1, holding plenty in re
serve for the two-mile. The race
was practically a default as only
Ganahl, U.C.L.A.'s Tom Keagan,
and Stanford's Will Schaupp were
entered and finished in that order.
fn (he two-mile, however, Ga
nalil ran a poorly paced race, let
ting Bruin John Pattee get too
far ahead to he caught. At the
start of the eighth lap Pattee held
a 75-yard lead on the Indian, and
crossed the finish line 3(1 yards
ahead, dead on his feet. Pattee's
time was his fastest of his career,
being !):4(!.7 with Ganahl, who
had more left than he thought,
closing fast about five seconds
later.
Last Farm win came in the high
jump where Ed Luce went over at
6 ft. 3 in., tops for the year on the
home field. U.C.L.A.'s Tom Hewitt,
a 5 ft. 10 in. jumper, took second
at that figure, leaving Mars Hjelte
and Don Lowe, both of whom have
gone higher than Hewitt, tied with
U.C.L.A.'s Slu Bowie at 5 ft. 8 in.
