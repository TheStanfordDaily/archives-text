# Indian Golfers Trample Trojan, Bruin Linksmen

### 
Stanford University's golf team established itself as top-heavy favorite
to win the Pacific Coast Conference links championship when it defeated
the squads of U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. over the weekend.
The victory over U.S.C. on Friday was by a score of 16 I â– > to 10' j. On
Saturday, the hot Cards slaughtered ttie Bruin men of the fairways by a
count of 27 to 0. winning every match with holes to spare.

Stanford's outstanding shot foH
the weekend was, as usual, Frank
McCann, number one man. Me-
Cann, who has lost only one match
this year, shot a 70 against the Tro
jans on the tough Baldwin Hills
course.
The next day he came back to
lead the Indians with a sharp 71.
Only California remains on the
slate now as the locals, under the
direction of Eddie Twiggs, prepare
for the Pacific Coast Championship
finals which will be held at Stan
ford, and the Nationals which will
come up in mid-June.
Current status of George Trap
hagen, Stanford star in prewar
years who is back on the campus, is
still in doubt. But Trap expects to
be eligible for the Nationals.
