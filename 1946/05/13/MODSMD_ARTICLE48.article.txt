# Con Home Provides Child's Many Needs
## 
### NANCY BANNICK 
Stanford's Convalescent Home
j provides nursing care, medical
| service, and instruction for needy
convalescent children of San Fran-
I cisco, according to Mrs. Ruth At
j wood, superintendent of the home.
The Con Home was originally
Senator and Mrs. Stanford's home,
i most of which perished in the
| earthquake. The buildings were
j taken over for a children's hospi
| tal and new buildings were added,
j SUPPORTED BY CHARITY
The Home is supported almost
entirely by charity, although some
j times a child's parents will pay a
: portion of the child's expenses, Mrs.
| Atwood said. The Associated Stu
dents supported four bed pati'jnts
[ last year. Stanford is the only Uni
j versity in the United States that
1 has a charity institution on its cam
j Pus-
The bed unit, auxiliary unit, and
| occupational therapy unit make up
I the Home's many wards. Since no
infectious cases are taken, children
entering the Home go to the ad
mission wing for a couple of weeks
so the doctors can make sure they
have no contagious diseases.
RHEUMATIC FEVER CASES
Thirty-live children with rheu
matic fever are in the Home now.
There are 500 children in San Fran
cisco at the present time who need
care for this, so that the Home has
a long waiting list. Children are
also taken to be built up for op
eration, and there are many physi
i cal therapy cases.
One of the main functions of the
! Home is to keep the children happy
| and help them get adjusted to their

illnesses. It is hard to believe that
the sun-tanned little boys in white
shorts with red trim playing on the
porches or lawns of the Home were
! bed-patients a short time ago.
They carry a full school program
for which they are given credit
I when they return to their regular
[ schools, can belong to a Cub Scout
I outfit at the home, and have toys,
playgrounds with swings, slides, and
| a tree house.
GIRLS HAVE PLAYHOUSE
The little girl "up-patients" wear
I red and white play suits on warm
J sunny days and a big red ribbon
j in their hair. One of the main at
j tractions for them is the life-size
I playhouse, completely furnished.
where they hold birthday parties
j once a month for all the children
j who have birthdays in that month.
In the afternoon after their rest
1 period the "up-patients"' have milk
j and cookies before going to school.
On hot days some of them go to
school in their bathing suits.
I There are picnics every Tuesday
i night and movies once a week.
ALITA IS HAPPY
Alita, a little dark - haired girl,
grinned broadly at some Stanford
I students who were recently touring
the Home. "She has just been made
an "up-patient" after being in bed
a year," Mrs. Atwood said. "When
she first came to the Con Home, she
shied away from everyone who
came near her."
Mary, a little girl in a plaster cast
suffering from infantile paralysis,
managed to give the students a big
smile as they walked through her
ward.
