WASHINGTON. Mav 13 (UP).
— A swooping reorganization of
(he Army and War Department
was announced tonight in an ex
ecutive order designed to stream
line the chain of command, pro
vide greater autonomy for the Air
Forces, and broaden military re
search.
Secretary of War Robert P. Pat
terson announced that the reorgan
ization, authorized in an executive
or dor signed by President Truman
last Saturday, will go into effect on

Patterson was authorized to abol
ish the Service Forces —one of the
Army's three basic wartime divi
sions—and reassign its functions.
The Secretary also assumes per
sonal control of all scientific re
search and development by the
Army of such new weapons as the
atomic bomb, establishing a spe
cial division in the General StalT
to co-rdinate military with civil
ian research.
Announcement of the far-reach
ing reorganization move came af
ter a special White House meeting
between Mr. Truman and the na
tion's top Army and Navy leaders
to discuss the proposed service
merger plan.
While the two issues were not
linked officially, the Army reorgan
ization appeared designed to sim
plify the handling of the integration
problems that would be involved in
a unification of all the armed forces.

WASHINGTON, May 13 (UP).-
The House tossed the explosive draft
issue back to the Senate tonight de
spite Administration warnings that

impossible" to keep the act from

stop-gap bill for a »45-day extension
of Selective Service but tacked on
amendments to prohibit the induc
tion of teen-agers and fathers.
Unless the Senate accepts the
amended bill tomorrow, the draft
and President Truman's accompa
nying powers to seize strikebound
coal mines will be wiped off the
statute books.
House passage was by a 280 to 84
roll call vote.
