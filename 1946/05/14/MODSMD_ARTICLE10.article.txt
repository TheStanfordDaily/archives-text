# Women's Conference Asks Dorms to Consider Definite Policy for Food Conservation Program
## 
### 
Women's Conference mcml>ers de
cided at yesterday's meeting to
bring up a full discussion of the need
for food conservation on campus in
their house meetings last night.
They hoped that such a discussion
would bring initiative on the part
of the women to make a definite pol
icy on cutting down consumption of
wheat products.
Bob Collins, who was appoint
ed by Kxcom to work on the pro
gram. spoke to Conference and
said that students should be em
barrassed or offended to have
wheat products served to them.
Women can cut down on their
wheat consumption when eating
out. he said, and can talk to their
dining hall directors about their
.menus.
He suggested having two wheat
less days a week besides cutting out
bread one meal each day, and cut
ting out all desserts containing
wheat.
A Housing Committee plan
which would put spring quarter
room drawings on the ratio sys
tem and fall and winter drawings
on the class preference system
was brought up at Conference.
House presidents decidcd to lake
the plan to their houses and bring
the results of their discussions to
Conference Monday. If the houses
approve, it will become a recom
mended policy of Conference.
A request was made that Lagu
nita be considered one unit in room
drawings instead of individual casas
as it is now, because it is really one
social unit and girls arc afraid to
try moving from casa to casa for fear
of being forced out of Lagunita al
together.

The plan will also be considered
by Union Unit, and will be dis
cussed by Housing Committee this
week.
Marie Wagner, chairman of the

Conference fashion show, reported
that about 300 tickets were sold and
expected profits were about $50. Pro
ceeds go to the Conference scholar
ship fund.
