# Halls Vote Wheat Cut In Food Conserving Step
## 
### 
Lagunita, Branner, Roble, and
Union Residence were on the track
of drastic reduction in wheat con-
I sumption when women in the halls
i voted almost unanimously last
: night to virtually eliminate wheat
! from their diet.
The action was taken in conjunc
! tion with the current food conser
| vation campaign to speed up Ameri
can food relief to starving European
j nations.
Only definite resolution passed
; was Roble's which contained the
following three points, according to
President Barbara Cooper: (1) Stop
all wheat orders from outside res
taurants (drive-ins, Cellar, etc.) ,
i (2) use up wheat supplies on hand,

and (3) order no more wheat after
present stocks arc used up.
Miss Cooper said reduction in
wheat consumption at breakfast and
lunch was left to the discretion of
the dining hall director.
At a meeting in the Women's
Clubhouse, Union women voted
unanimously to give up all wheat
consumption for the duration of the
food shortage. Action on this vote
is pending upon consultation today
with the dining hall director.
Also awaiting further discus
sion with the dining hall director
and among women in the hall is
Branner, where the question was
discussed at house meeting. Pres
ident Shirley Marks said action
will he taken before the end of the
week.
Women in Lagunita casas offered
suggestions including elimination of
wheat in all desserts, cutting out
all wheat consumption with the ex
ception of limited amounts at break
fast, and elimination of all salad
dressings except in extreme cases.
President Barbara Seavcr stated
that action on the suggestions will
follow immediate consultations with
casa presidents and the dining hall
director.
