WASHINGTON, May 13 (UP).—
Former President Herbert Hoover
reported to President Truman today
on his global food shortage and
emerged from the White House to
give a cold reception to proposals
that the United States resume ra
tioning this summer to help feed
the world's hungry millions.
But he called on Americans to
obey the rules of food conserva
tion and warned that a stop in the
flow of food overseas would mean
death to .'500,000,000 and hunger
for 800.000,000.
Mr. Hoover's estimates, based on
first-hand information of the global
iood situation, were presented in an
address tonight before the American
Agriculture Editors' Association.
He was glad to report, he said,
that there was no mass starvation in
the world now but he emphasized
there was a very great danger of
mass starvation. He said the Ameri
can farmer must sell grain under
the government's bonus program,
the housewife must conserve food
and the entire food industry must
sec that food is channeled properly.
