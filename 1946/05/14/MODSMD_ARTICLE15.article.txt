# A.S.S.U. Candidate Speaks at Lagunita
## 
### 
The first shot in what may be the
hottest political battle in Stanford's
j history was fired last night when
l Stan Shpetner formally announced
I his candidacy for the position of
1 Student Body president in the May
! 23 ASSU elections.
Taking advantage of the limited
campaigning provisions passed by
Excom, Shpetner outlined his elec
tion platform in short ten-minute
| speeches before the women from
j five Lagunita Casas and Casa Ven
| tura.
Shpetner emphasized that this
is a crucial time at Stanford. Many
vital issues are at stake. He point
ed out that what is needed is a
Student Body Government inter
ested in furthering the best in
terests of the most students, as
! many of the men on campus to
| day are more mature and not in
terested in the "petty political
issues" that have so far been dis
cussed.
Two issues that have been evaded
jso far. according to Shpetner, arc
j the problems of Housing and Food
1 Conservation. A strong, moving
i government would get a definite
I settlement on these issues, as they
I are vital to the entire enrollment,
| he stated.
As a final sally Shpetner denied
I the rumor to the cfToct that if he
j were elected the Hammer and Sickle
would be placed on top of the Hoov
-1 er War Library.
