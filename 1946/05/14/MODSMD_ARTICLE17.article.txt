# Coal Miners Get Back Pay
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 13 (UP).—
j UMW President John L. Lewis won
| a $3,000,000 back pay settlement from
i the soft coal operators today and
followed up his victory by demand
ing a $70,000,000-a-ycar levy on the
| industry to finance a miners' wcl
( fare fund.
In a surprise switch that ap
parently caught the management
negotiators flat-footed, Lewis
dropped his argument for a coal
production royalty to support the
miners' fund, the number-one is
sue over which the negotiations
have been deadlocked for two
' months
I Instead, he told the operators the
UMW now wants a 7 per cent as
sessment on the mine payrolls to
cover the costs of the fund, The
miners themselves would make no
contribution to the fund.
| The proposal marked a sharp
I retreat from Lewis' long-standing
royalty demand, which President
Truman already has branded as
illegal and which congresisonal
foes of the mine chieftain have
threatened to outlaw specifically
l by legislation.
But he stuck to his original posi
! tion that the fund should be admin
| istered solely by the union, and ob
j servers estimated that the 7 per
| cent assessment actually would put
| more money into the UMW "s hands
I th*n the original 10 ccnts-a-ton roy-
I alty plan.
