Taxi dancers from Roble and the
"world's smallest dwarf, imported
from Africa by Tyler Hall," will be
two of the features presented at the
Soph Carnival Friday night in the
Pavilion.
The carnival, which will climax
the fifth day of Stanford's Con
Home Drive, is an all-campus, no
date affair, lasting from 8 to 12
p.m. All proceeds from the event
will be turned into the drive.
Presidents of fraternities that
want to sign for a concession should
contact Dick Crake at Arthur Hall
as soon as possible. All other living
groups can register their booths with
Sally Sturtevant, Lathrop, or with
Crake.
Hurlburt is sponsoring a portable
ice cream wagon Friday night. "Oak
Limbs" is the name of the booth
which The Oaks will present. Ac
cording to reports it will consist of
trying to throw hoops on girls' legs.
Other concessions planned for
the Soph Carnival include En
cina's Turtle Derby, Klahoya's
penny pitching booth, and Ar
thur Hall's nail pounding contest.
According to Bill Blaisdell, chair
man of the event, student policemen
are needed to work at the Carnival.
Anyone interested should contact
Jim Sheehy at Cleveland Hall. Po
licemen receive 60 cents an hour.
