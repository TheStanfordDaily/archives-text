# Couples Needed For Soliciting
## 
### 
More couples are needed to so
licit off-campus for the Con Home
Drive, according to Eugene Mit
guard, co-chairman. Those inter
ested should contact Lyle Davis
(Guthrie) or Eugene Mitguard
(Tyler) today.
Some of those couples who have
already signed up to solicit have
not yet picked up their receipt books
and instructions, Mitguard said.
They should do so by contacting
Miss Davis today.
The off-campus drive began last
night with a banquet at Wilson's,
after which the couples began their
soliciting. They will continue so
liciting tonight and tomorrow night,
and prizes for the couples collecting
the most money will be given out
Thursday.
