# Germany: Unity Out of Chaos?
## 
### 
Perhaps you didn't notice the paragraph
ending yesterday's United Press story on the
Trieste deadlock, but it said that "the Big Four
Vvcre expected to discuss centralized control
of Germany" in the near future. The implica
tions are important, for the winning of the
pe.-.ce leans heavily on our failures and suc
t.os-ies in the occupation of conquered nations.
In Germany the system of zoning has
hi ought about a cross-tangling of both ideol
ogies and practices. The country is a hotbed
of discontent which is ready to catch flame
fic..:; u.iy underground movement which
sounds strong and drastic enough.
Showing itself more clearly every day in
reports from Germany is the inconsistency of
a divided administration for one nation. It may
seem easier now for nations to dispense with
the long processes of compromise that would
follow attempts at centralization, but it will be

far harder in the long run to have to clean up
the remains of a smoldering confusion.
Disunited control is not the only evil in the
present occupation of Germany. One of the
worst lies in the fact that the program to strip
the nation of its industries is so planned that
it v/ill cause an upheaval in Europe's economy
that will affect the lives of millions.
What is needed in its place is action to ef
fectively demilitarize Germany and to offer
simultaneously encouragement to industry
which is essential to the economic balance of
the continent, and which will utilize for peace
ful ends the nation's natural resources.
Surely there is no hope that Germany ever
can take its place in the family of nations if
v/e do not take definite steps to build a new
and positive occupational policy out of the
conflicting* forces at work within its borders
today.
