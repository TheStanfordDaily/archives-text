WHERE DO THE DIMES GO?
We are veterans just returned to the campus this
quarter. We were sitting around in the room the
other night and rehashing the good old days in '41
and '42 when men were men and would never allow
the Axe to be stolen. Things were going fine until
we suddenly remembered a little deal that we had
poured dimes into week after week.
What happened to Dimes for Diplomas? We want
to know. Is there still a fund, and if so what is be
ing done with it? We are sure that many of the vet
erans on campus have contributed to this fund at
one time or another. What about them, will they
bo able to benefit from this fund?
We are throwing this problem in your laps. There
must be people on cajnpus who can answer our
questions. Those dimes worry us.
Yours,
Three Perplexed Veterans
(Editorial note: See story to today's paper to
find the answer about the Dimes for Diplomas
fund.)
