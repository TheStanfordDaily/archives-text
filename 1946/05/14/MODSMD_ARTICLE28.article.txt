# WHAT PRICE ATHLETICS?
## 
### 
Stanford's athletic program should now be clear
ly stated as to whether we will continue, as in the
past as the leading school on the West Coast; or like
the University of Chicago drop competitive ath
letics entirely.
Now is the time to bring this problem out in

(he open, and let the students make the final deci
sion before the majority go home for summer va
cation.
An example of the failing sports program is the
fact that, unless the new athletic budget is
changed, wrestling, rugby, and soccer may be dis
continued in the fall. This fact is unfortunate con
sidering that last winter the wrestling team beat
their old rival, the University of California, and
they had three men chosen for the all conference
wrestling team.
This fine record is even more outstanding because
it was the first conference competition in 20 years.
The wrestling coach was recently notified that he is
no longer needed at Stanford!
Sports are declining at Stanford despite the
fact that most students are in favor of a larger
and better program. Since I am a new student, I
don't fully understand this because I have so
often heard that we have a student government
here.
Now, if the students want an athletic program
that they can be proud of, as I do, why don't they
put one into effect? The real test for any govern
ment is in time of stress. Now is the time to deter
mine whether or not students can achieve student
aims through student government.
