# HISTORY—1946

### BILL STEIF 
The other day a young' man handed us a little
booklet entitled "Technocracy in Plain Terms" and
then scurried off. We were left gawking with this
little pamphlet in our hand and so pulled ourselves
over to the curb, sat down and proceeded to thumb
through the booklet in a somewhat cursory manner.
Well, we didn't find much to interest our own
rather slow mental processes until we came across
this phrase, "After the inevitable collapse of our
stupendous financial and political structure, after
the many palliatives have been tried and have
failed, (Technocracy) will still remain."
Well, we couldn't and still can't figure out wheth
er "Technocracy will remain" and we couldn't find
an exact working definition of the system in our lit
tle pamphlet, anyway, but we were interested m this
business about, the "inevitable collapse of our finan
cial and political structure." Sometimes we are in
elined to think that a sort of collapse is coming off
these days. The only thing is that we don't think it
is a collapse in the way the Roman Empire, for in
stance, collapsed.
It seems to us that modern history especially
is a process of building new beliefs from obso
lescent concepts and that, we think, is what is
slowly being done in Europe and, to a much les
ser extent, in the United States these days.
Of course, the primary reason that new ideas and
new political, economic and social forms are evolv
ing in Europe is because the continent was so com
pletely scourged during the war. Many of the old
customs, the old mores and ways of life went by the
boards in the cauldron of battle and Europeans have
no choice today but to look ahead.
There is, unfortunately, a contradiction in this
evolution which makes the whole process (if proc
esses can be viewed with emotion) a trifle sad. This
contradiction is the fact that it took the most ter
rible war in history to rid Europe of many of its

ancient and empty forms. And the result is, though
nations such as France and Italy and England are
struggling to find new and more satisfactory ways
of life (for government is really only an expression
of a country's momentarily dominant philosophy),
these same nations have hardly the strength to feed
themselves while their new political, social and eco
nomic forms grow.
Meanwhile, in the United Stales wo were rela
tively unscathed by the war. And here some peo
ple are now trying to turn back to the way ol life
they remember from the late 19305. Those people
who are attempting to return to something they re
member are, of course, the very persons who pos
sessed the lion's share of our old luxuries and privi
leges -and they are, in fact, the same people who
today control large portions of our thought and of
our material wealth.
Over and over again in recent months we have
heard the rallying cry, "(he good of<! days," hut
as we think ahout it now we think there really
was no such thing as "the good old days." We
suspect thei*; might have been"the old, unthink
ing days" were something of a myth.
Anyway, we surely hope that the United States,
with its power and plenty will somehow see fit to
help out the. impoverished nations of Europe that
are seeking to build new life from their scoured
ruins. And that is especially applicable to those
private citizens here who hold vast areas of wealth.
And while we're at it, we think it might be a fine
idea for as many of us here in this country to ob
serve this European evolution —and team all we
can from it.
'!his is a long way from Technocracy, we sup
pose, hut our point is thai the collapse of "our
stupendous financial and political structure" is
not, as the Technocrats say, an inevitability. It
will occur only if we shut our doors and pull the
structure down upon ourselves.
