### MARY VIRGINIA POND 
As reports that negotiations for
India's independence had failed
! came over the wire, an Indian stu
j di nt panel told members of Stan
lord's International Club that fail- I
j uie to get independence might re- I
! suit in direct or violent struggle.
Ganti Subrahmanyam, Dr. Palit,
Venkataraman Jagannatham, and 1
Jin Jhingran formed the panel which
addressed "I" Club members last ]
Sunday night at 7:.'<o at the home of |
I Mr. and Mis. Edwin J. Tlionias in !
Palo Alto.
Discussion centered mainly j
aroiuxV the question of India's
independence. Jagannatham re
ported that India's greatest prob
lem was production. Though the
I country is very rich in mineral
resources, very little progress has
been made in industrialization, he
! said.
"As a result," Jagannatham
stated, "when a crisis comes, fam
ine is outstanding." He explained
I that food production was dependent
!on the production of fertilizers 1
I which would in turn necessitate a j
! means for producing more nitrates
j â€” hence more heavy industrializa
| Lion.
He added that the Indian stu
dents attending Stanford at the
present were "here to assist in
| the future industrialization of
India." The majority of the In
dian students are majoring and
I receiving their degrees in biology, j
chemistry, and engineering.
In regard to the Moslem-Hindu ;
question, Jagannatham announced ,
that since 1940 the Moslem League, I
fearing to be a minority in an in- j
dependent state, desired to form a j
j separate country to the northwest j
of India proper.
He added that not all the Mos- j
i lems were in favor of this plan, but i
that a certain amount of autonomy ]
j for their provinces could be given, i
"The problem can he worked
out if no third party interferes,"

Jagannalham declared. Ho staled
(hat (lit 1 Communists wore un
popular in India.
In describing Gandhi's position,
Jagannalham pointed out that the
Indian leader followed the principle
that a people could be ruled only
as long as they permitted them
selves to be ruled.
As a result India's 'fight for
independence" is characterized by
no violence, intrigue, or secret
diplomacy. The 'fight" is to lie
directed against the British gov
ernment, not individual Knglish
men. The breaking of any laws
which the Indian people feel arc
contrary to their integrity and
sell-respect is permissible in such
a campaign.
Palit, Subrahmanyam, and Jhin
gran discussed some of the social
and cultural aspects of India, in
cluding the music and dress of the
peopb.
