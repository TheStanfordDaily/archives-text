## 
### 
After taking both U.C.L.A. and
U.S.C. in tow on their trip south
last weekend, Coach Eddie Twiggs'
Stanlord golfers meet the Univer
sity of British Columbia on the
Stanford course today.
'i he Thunderbirds are probably
(he lust links team in the North
west, and should provide tough
opposition for the Indians if they
were able to get used to the tough
Stanford links in 'their play yes
terday. Previously, U.B.C. has
soundly beaten Reed College
(Portland), Western Washington,
and the University of Portland.
Last week they took on the Uni
versity of Washington in Vancou
ver and defeated the Huskies, 23-
1.3. In a return match, on the Hus
kies' home course in Seattle, the
Thunderbirds ran into trouble and
lost a close one, 14-13.
Leading oil for a B.C. will be
Dave Dale, a top-Might golfer,
capable of shooting under par.
Frank IVlcCann will do well to get
by him. Others on the team are,
in order, Dick Hanley, Malcolm
Tapp, Bob Plommer, Ilans Swin
son, and Ormic Hall. These men
are all canable of turning in scores
at or near par; their chief prob
lem is to get used to the tricky
Stanford links.
On their trip south, the Uclans
were no trouble for the Indians, but
S.C. was a different story. The In
dians played in top form and won
the tiff, 16>2 to 10'2, but the Trojans
were their toughest competition to
date.
This weekend the Cards meet
both teams again, in addition to the
Cal Bears in the Southern Division
individual and team championships
on the Stanford golf course. U.S.C.
should be the only block in the way
of conference championship tor the
Stanford golf team.
