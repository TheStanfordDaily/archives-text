### SMILEY FARKAS 
When the sports staff came to
work yestorday afternoon they
found two announcements awaiting
them. One of the announcements, ;
on plain copy paper, said:
WANTED: Young men, Stan
lord undergraduates, who can run
high hurdles, broadiump, throw
javelin, etc. Positions now open,
good opportunities for advance
ment. Contact Track Coach Jack
Weicrshauscr at 8.A.C., or after
:i p.m. at Angell Field.
The other missle was an ominous
sounding affair on black-bordered
heavy white vellum, and said:
It is with deepest regrets that
we announce the demise of the
''Spirit of Stanford." Last rites
will be held Saturday afternoon,
June 1, starting at 1:15 p.m. at
Edwards Field. U.C. campus,
Berkeley. Black tics will be worn.
The first note is obviously a last
minute plea from the Farm's track
mentor for anybody who has ever
been out for track before, either in
high school or in college, to turn
out immediately for the team.
The most desperate need of Coach
Weiershauser is for a high hurdler,
anybody who can cover 120 yards
and the six timbers in 1G seconds
or less. A 16-second hurdler will
give the Farm second place against
Cal, good for three points.
Another serious need is for a
broadjumper who can clear 22 feet
at least. Anybody who could do 23
feet would give the Cards a first
place in the meet; that's five points,
and 22 feet would be good for sec
ond place.
In 1937, one week before Big
Meet, the then Track Coach Dink
Templeton reached out into the
student body for a boy by the
name of Leo Madlam, who had
never broadjumped in college be

tore. With one week of training
behind him, Madlam leaped 23 feet
for a first place, and the next year
as a senior jumped the same dis
tance consistently.
The third big hole in the Indians'
picture is the weights, where Cal is
figured for almost three complete
sweeps. There is a man on campus
now who, without even taking off
his street clothes, can throw farther
than the best the Cards can do. This
guy has been known to throw the
I javelin over 200 feet, which would
I be good for another first place, and
j the meet.
One day this character was fool
ing around the track and, standing
I still, threw the javelin over 160 feet.
The track coach approached him,
I asked him if he was eligible, and
when answered in the affirmative
I asked him to turn out for the team.
"Naw, I don't wanna!" he answered,
! and walked ofi the field.
Come up to Berkeley in a couple
| of weeks and watch this guy and
the others like him help deprive
Stanford pf its chance for a Big
Meet victory.
