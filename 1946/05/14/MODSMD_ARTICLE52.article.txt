# Troy Netters Invade Farm
## 
### BULLET BULLOCK 
Number one nemesis of the Stan
ford tennis squad, powerful U.S.C.,
visits the Farm Saturday for a re
turn match. Cardinal tans would
just as soon forget the 9-0 count by
which the Trojans triumphed in the
Southland a few weeks ago.
The men of Trov have breezed
through their conference schedule
undefeated and have yet to be
pressed to any great length.
Needless to say, they will'be de
cided favorites to annex number
four on their string of victories
this weekend.
Local interest will be centered
upon the appearance of the re
nowned Falkenburg brothers, Bob
and Tom, on the Trojan team, Eoth
boys have strayed from the colle
giate scene lately to perform bril
liantly in amateur circles. In lact,
Bobby advanced to the quarter-fin
nals in the Southern California
Championships last weekend in such
fast company as Ted Schroeder,
Jack Kramer, and Frankie Parker.
First position seeding on the
U.S.C. powerhouse falls to Hob
by. who incidentally is the young
ster of the Falkenburg clan. (Hu
mors that sister Jinx would per
form are erroneous.) Brother
Tom is seeded number three Tro
jan. having been nosed out for
number two slot by sensational
newcomer Bob Perez.
