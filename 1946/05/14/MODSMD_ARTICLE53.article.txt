Now that Stan Shpetner, tiie "Who
Told You?" Kent, and the "Two
Stanford Vets" have had their say
on the subject of athletes at this
school, this writer is throwing in
his two-bits' worth on the subject.
The reason that athletes are not
coming to ( this school, as they are
to other schools, is because of rigid
scholastic requirements that aren't
being relaxed.
We can't forget that football is
a competing business, and if Stan
ford wants to stay high on the
pigskin horizon we must compete
with the rest of the schools.
Stan Shpetner believes the solu
tion is financial payments to ath
letes, which will throw down the
drain any amateur standing colleges
presently possess.
This writer disagrees that out
right payments are the solution.
If this course is taken, more am
munition is furnished to those
educators who believe that inter
collegiate athletics have no place
in the present college life.
This writer also disagrees that
academic requirements be forgot
ten when athletes seek admit
tance to universities. The primary
function of a university is educa
tion. But that docsn I mean that
certain considerations shouldn't
be shown for students who par
ticipate in extra-curricular ac
tivities.
And that isn't necessarily a hypo
critical approach to the problem. If
a student devotes two or three hours
a day to some event, naturally
those students won't have the same
time to devote to studying as the
students who have no extra-cur
ricular activities. Either more units
should be given for physical educa
tion activities, or students should
be allowed to carry fewer units
when they are out for sports.
This writer feels that at present
the Administration at Stanford is
being too rigid in its requirements

for students who plan to partici
pate in athletic events. This writ
er, furthermore, feels that the
high scholastic rating of this
school will not be endangered if
a program as roughly outlined in
the previous two paragraphs is
adopted.
