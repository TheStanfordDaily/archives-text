# Gable's Return to Pictures In 'Adventure' Disappointing
## 
### 
ADVENTURE — An M-G-M pic
ture, today through Saturday at
the Stanford Theater.
Clark Gable's return to the screen
is both a long-awaited and a long
winded occasion. Even though the
result be disappointing, let it not
be said that Mr. Gable isn't the
virile Lothario that he was in the
thirties.
M-G-M evidently forgot, though,
that activities are pretty drab when
Gable isn't mauling around with

Lana Turner or an equally luscious
character; for Greer Garson, the
recipient of his affections in this
case, lacks the appeal and magnetism
of his previous leading women, on
which so much has depended.
BLONDELL SAVES
Gable meets Garson in a San
Francisco public library (or, as the
uncouth will have it, "in Frisco")
where Miss Garson is in charge of
keeping stewbums out on the
streets. Mr. Gable, a bo'sun in the
Merchant Marine, is not to be de
nied, though, and the pair eventu
ally wind up the same day in a
hilarious night-club brawl. And so
it goes for two and a quarter hours
as they engage in a colossal assort
ment of chit-chat, childishness, and
child-birth. All of which after a
time wears as thin as a Cellar steak.
But "Adventure" has many re- J
deeming factors, chief of which i
are the delightful performances of j
Thomas Mitchejl and Joan Blondell, i
both of whom can keep any situa- i
tion from banality. Also present is |
Xavier Cugat's ex-singer and now j
actress, Lina Romay, who is very j
provocative as Gable's South Sea i
girl friend. It is only when Gable j
is with Miss Romay that one feels
that here is the hot-blooded Gable I
worth remembering.
LOVE ANI) FIGHT
There really isn't much to say j
about "Adventure." There is love, I
some of it violent and some of it
never getting beyond the hand
holding stage; there is fighting and |
brawling, as there always must be j
on the San Francisco waterfront;
there are reels of talk—most of it j
small-talk; there are all these es
sentials. But I'll be damned if 1
saw much adventure.—Dick Bower
