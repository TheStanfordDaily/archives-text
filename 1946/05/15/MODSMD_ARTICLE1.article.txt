# Famine Areas Will Be Given 25% U.S. Wheat

WASHINGTON. May 14 (UP).—
Moving to funnel more grain to
famine areas, the Department of
Agriculture today announced a
wheat requisition program which
may reduce normal bread supplies
15 per cent beginning July 1 and
put another crimp in beer and
whiskey reserves.

SAN FRANCISCO. May 14
(UP). —Mrs. Pacific Coast House
wife, already finding grocery
stores out of bread and wheat
products increasingly scarce, to
day had little reason to hope that
conditions would improve.
Effects of government restric
tions to provide grain for starv
ing people in Europe and the
Far Fast already arc being felt.
The flour and bread supply was
described as "critical" in Califor
nia and Oregon cities, with Wash
ington faring a little better be
cause of shipments of Montana
wheat.

The Department said it would |
requisition 25 per cent of all the j
1946 wheat crop which farmers dei
liver to elevators. It also announced •
extension of other grain -conserva- i
tion measures which means that
America will get less bread and j
beer until July of 1947, at least.
The drastic steps were taken to
guarantee that 250,000,000 bushels \
of wheat —one-fourth of the esti- j

mated 194G crop—will go for famine
relief.
The program does not mean that
wheat will be requisitioned directly
from farmers. But when a farmer
delivers wheat from this year's crop
to a grain elevator, 50 per cent must
be sold immediately. The govern
ment then will take over half of
that sold—or 25 per cent.
Whiskey and beer reserves got a
new jolt when the Department ruled
that the ban on wheat to make al
coholic beverages will remain in
force until the summer of 1947.
