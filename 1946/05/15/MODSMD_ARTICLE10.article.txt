# Race Discrimination Case Before Moot Court Tonight
## 
### 
When third - year legal eagles j
clash in the final round of their'
moot court tonight they will handle
a race discrimination case that might
come up before California courts in
the near future and would probably
go to the Supreme Court.
lieforc distinguished Judges
Douglas L. Edmonds of the Cali
fornia Supreme Court, C. J. Good
ell and Maurice T. Dooling, r., I
Associate Justices of the District !
Court of Appeals, local lawyers
will argue the imaginary case of !
a white soldier who married a girl i
of Japanese ancestry who was j
horn in Cleveland and is an
American citizen.
The marriage was performed in I
New York, where it is legal, but I

when the couple moved to the State
of Stanford they were sentenced to
jail under a Stanford statute hold
ing any marriage of white persons
to Negroes, Mongolians, Malayans,
or mulattoes void and illegal.
This mythical Stanford statute is
identical with the actual California |
law. For this reason the case is of I
importance beyond the bounds of i
a law student practice trial.
The three judges will decide
the winning side, but will not
comment on the points of law.
In the arguments, beginning at j
7:30 p.m. at the Little Theater,
the soldier and his wife will he I
represented by John Nelson and
Robert M. Newell. Lucille F.
Athearn and Robert L. Fletcher
will plead for the State.
It, is expected that Nelson and j
Newell will base their appeal on j
two grounds:
1. Under the constitution of the |
United States the laws of New York !
must be recognized by other states. J
2. The statute under which the j
couple were sentenced is itself un- I
constitutional because it violates |
(lie Fourteenth Amendment.
