# Dances Depict Varied Moods
## 
### 
A technique which was rough at
first but improved, excellent cos
tuming and lighting, original music
which matched the mood perfectly,
and varied feeling interpretations
were the main points of the Orchc
sis Annual Spring Dance Concert
last night.
Of the more serious numbers on
♦he program, "Kol Nidrei" (The
Vow) choreographed by Mareia
Scholes, which represented the con
flict between the group and the in
dividual, was presented most pre
cisley and was received the best.
"Blues," danced and choreo
graphed and danced as a solo by
Margo Sorzano with original music
by T«xl Hoffman, was .ilriking in its
inpretation and effect.
The folk songs hS a group were
perhaps the most enjoyable part of
the program in providing more
clearly understood and pleasant
studies. "The Swagman," danced as
a solo by Mary Martin, and"The
Blue Tail Fly," danced by Marjorie
Forkner, were outstanding in their
"Extase," a Fieri;> poem, read in
French by Bill Melton and danced
by Marjorie Forkner, was striking
in its uniqueness, while "Two Slat
terns and a King." a morality play
read by Mary Cogswell, was the
brightest spot in the evening.
Joan Whitmore Lomax, the con
cert's pianist. Al Novikoff, and Mar
go Sorzano also wrote original mu
sic, which was a major factor in the
success of the show.- Hanson
