# ASSU Election Interest Rises
## 
### 
Stanford student body that in for
i mcr elections has only turned out
, a vote of 20 per cent of total popu
lation in campaigns was humming
| today. Although only one name,
Stan Shpetner, has been presented
I as an open nominee for the student
S body presidency, many other names
I are being whispered around and a
I total of at least four candidates is
expected.
Never have so many vital issues
been up for discussion. The prob
lems of housing, a new student
union, raise in room and board
! schedules are all big problems.
The question of how the solution
to the Farm's athletic dilemma
will be worked out is the No. 1
topic in most hull sessions these
days. These questions have forced
the issue and tin* nominees will
be elected May 23 on the basis of
how they face them.
Historically Little Injun has
shown a decided apathy toward the
people picked to run his affairs.
1 All this seems to be gone. The
i new Excom ruling allowing lim
ited electioneering will permit pres
idential nominees to bring their
views on controversial issues di
rectly to the members of different
j living groups.
Nominations will be (iled for all
I elective positions on Thursday and
! Friday, May 17 and 18, at booths
j which will be placed on iHstory
j and Engineering corners.
Another factor adding to the
interest in the elections is the
wide split in the student body,
j Velqrans, a sizeable portion of
( the people on Quad, have rc
' turned from classes as far re
moved as '42. On the Row, fra
ternity and hall men are living
J together and have formed new
j friendships. All this has helped
to break down split spirit and
bring the main issues to the fore.
An all-campus assembly has been
arranged by Election Board and
Cardinals with th" assistance of
Rally Com, )o be held in Frost Me
morial Amphitheater on May 22 at
1 a.m. Presidential candidates will
j be introduced and given a chance
i to present their views on how Stan
ford can best be represented dur
| ing the coming year.
