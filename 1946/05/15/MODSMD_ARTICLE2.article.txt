TEHRAN, Iran, May 14 (UP).â€”
Peace negotiations between repre
sentatives of Premier Ahmad Gha
vam and the "autonomous" Azer
baijan government collapsed over
Azerbaijan demands for the right to
appoint the provincial governor
general and military commander,
the Premier announced today.
Radio Tabriz, voice of the insur
gents, marked the breakdown in
negotiations and the return of the
Azerbaijan delegation by broad
casting a renewal of its threat that
Azerbaijan was ready to "fight for
our liberty." The broadcast said
Azerbaijani were "peace - loving
people" but would defend them
selves to the "last breath."
(A Swiss broadcast, recorded in
London, quoted a Kurdish general
staff communique as saying that
Kurds had beaten off an attack by
Iranian troops in Kurdistan. The
communique said Iranian troops
lost 130 men and a considerable
amount of "war booty.")
