# Stanford Squadâ€”Debate-Wise
## 
### 
The fine art of public speaking has come a
long way from the days of blowing off from
the grandiose heights of a stump . . . and
Stanford's debaters inconspicuously have
been establishing themselves this year as
top notch men and women in their field.
Take the annual Stanford-Cal Joffre debate:
Tcr.i Steege walked away with the medal last
woek to tie the score at 26-26, the outcome of
pv/nstakiig research, analysis, and forceful

presentation.
And the latest word is that the Debate
Squad has been asked to visit the University
of Hawaii for a round of debates and discus
sion.
Tor plugging hard at one of the toughest
and most thought-provoking of student activi
ties, Farm debaters are rated high by the rest
of us, inarticulate but appreciative of a job
well done.
