# WHO TOLD YOU?

### STAN SHPETNER 
Starting this afternoon we're going to start a new
course. "How to understand English in ten easy
lessons or five hard ones." #
May we urge that Art Levinson (our boy from
n-;.t door in the sports dept.) and the letter writers
known a.s "Two Stanford Veterans" come to every
lesson.
We hate to beg our readers to reread an old col
umn but for some reason or other at least three of
our boys couldn't seem to get the point the first
ti:i .• they read it.
(Mr. Levinson, who was just reading this over
my shoulder, is now racing for his typewriter.)
Levinson said "Stan Shpetner believes the solu
tion is financial payments to athletes which will
throw down the drain any amateur standing col
lies presently possess."
Ait. mail fren, what fo da mattah wit you.
And then we got a letter from "Two Stanford
Vote runs."
'Ihey say, "Sure, raise the barriers, bring in all
the tramp athletes. . . . Yes, Stan we think you have
the wrong idea . . ."
What is coming off?
V - may have the wrong idea. But we in no
\.ay, never—honest ever—took the stand that the
; ! ,ive 'jifotcs would infer that we had taken.
Anyway there seems to be one guy around that
c. i read English and what's more can understand
it.
A lad by the name of Jim Kurfess wrote a letter
to the Daily and he seems to have understood what
I said. I don t know. Maybe he never read the first
column and this is all his own idea.

Briefly to quote the original Sanskrit by Shpet
ner:
"Do they (the administration) want to follow the
example of the University of Chicago? Or do they
want to try and fill the stadium? They will have to
take their choice. . . . As a newspaper columnist it
is not our job to decide which move should be
made . . ."
We neither advocated ''letting in all (he ath
letic tramps" nor de-emphasizing. We repeat
again. The middle road that is being followed is
not worth two cents. Yes, I have checked on
Stanford's prewar record. Other schools did not
even approach the hig preparations being made
today. Reference to prewar situations are as
useless as reference to our teams of 1903.
We still do not advocate "letting all bars down."
Where you two students got that idea we still can
not figure out. We only say that either we should
make some reasonable exceptions to get the ath
letes here, or we should not try to compete with
the schools that are making tremendous exceptions.
Who do you two Student Veterans think you are?
Don Quixote had nothing cn you. It is asinine (our
favorite word) to assume that we can meet the
growing opposition the way we are now preparing.
As we already stated (and regret that it is neces
sary to repeat for those who can understand a thing
the first time that they see it) that: we must make
our choice one way or the other, and we would
think that it is up to the students through their
government to do something about it. Either make
a few exceptions or de-emphasize. Let it be what
the majority of the students (and faculty) want.
