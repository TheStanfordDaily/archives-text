FACTIONS IN THE U.S. C ONGRESS
'Way tack in 1787. Madison, in "The Federalist
Papt r:, talked about the diseases to which popular
governments—that's us—had in the past become
exposed, and from which some had even perished,
i .ieso diseases were: one. the instability of our
governments; another, the disregard of the pub
]i-• \;«i)d; and last, the deciding of measures, not
by ru'es of justice, but by superior force of an
interested and overbearing group. These diseases,
Madison claimed, stemmed from "a factious spirit
in our public administrations."
He asserted that a faction (and it seems that
many of our modern lobbies or pressure groups fall
into this category) was "a number of people,
whether amounting to a majority or minority, who
were united and actuated by some common impulse
of passion or interest which was adverse to the
rights of other citizens or to the permanent inter
ests of the community."
Madison's answers to the problems raised by the
existence of factions were to remove the causes or
control the effects of the groups.
In order to remove the causes of factions, he
s.-id, it would be necessary either to destroy the
liberty that gave life to their existence or to give
every person the same opinions and interests. The
boys of 1787 figured that to kill the liberty would
be a remedy worse than the disease itself.
As for giving every citizen the same opinion—
that was just plain silly. After all, as long as man's
reason was fallible and man could still be at liberty
to exercise it, there would be many opinions. So
they ruled out removing the causes of factions.
Mudison then deduced that relief v/as only to be
sought in the means of controlling the effects of
factions. He would "render those groups having
co-existent interest, unable to concert arid carry
into effect schemes of oppression."
Today, 15!) years after Madison voiced these
beliefs, the "factious spirit" still thrives. Though
some of the modern pressure groups are not to be
condemned, many of them have the same symp
toms of the factions of 1787—"a common impulse
of passion or interest which is adverse to the per
manent interests of the community."
Of the disease Madison discussed, the one most
typical in the U.S. Congress today, to which these
symptoms may best be fitted, is "the disregard of
the public good." Witness the vote of 356-42 to
cripple OPA by our "patriotic" congressmen after
a Gallup poll in March showed that 73 per cent of
the people favored extension of the present price

ceiling.
Witness last week's impressive 45-day extension
of the draft by the same Congress which voted over
whelmingly for the UN—which carried with it the
implication that we would maintain a large mili
tary force to carry out our foreign political com
mitments. And witness the great job done by pres
sure groups to delay Senate passage of the British
loan—even though the economic advantages are
innumerable to the U.S. to get it passed.
Madison's suggestion for remedying such sit
uations was "to render those groups having inter
ests against the public good, unable to carry into
effect their schemes of oppression." Today there
is on congressional desks a set of proposals in
tended to take a step in that direction. It is the
La Follette-Monroney bill for the reorganization
of Congress.
This report recognizes lobbies as one of the
causes of the reduced legislative output. It agrees
that all citizens have a right to state their griev
ances to their congressmen but that professionally
inspired pressure efforts through mass communica
tion and public relations only distort normal ex
pressions of opinion.
The main suggestion of the report is that of
strengthening the political parties which form the
only real force capable of resisting these blocs or
lobbies. The proposed plan would set up policy
committees for the majority and minority parties.
These committees would formulate over-all politi
cal strategy and formally announce their decisions.
However the most provocative suggestion is
tHat of a joint executive-legislative cabinet which
wtiuhl meet regularly with the President and the*
heads of the executive departments. They would
become the President's legislative cabinet. While
keeping executive and legislative branches sep
arate, as the Federalists desired, teamwork would
be improved and the gulf between the two
branches would be bridged.
Of course lobbies are not the only reason for the
collyp.se of an aggressive legislative program. Cer
tainly political education for a relatively unenlight
ened public is as important for controlling effects
of factions as is the alteration of legislative proce
dure.
Just as Madison implied, only according to the
interest we have in political diseases will we work
to remedy them, or by the apathy we express will
we not work and allow them to grow more malig
nant.
