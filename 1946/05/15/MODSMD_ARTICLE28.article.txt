# Colleges' Post-War Problems Include House, Staff Shortages
## 
### JOHN WAGNER 
High up on the list of reconver
sion problems since V-J Day is the
readjustment of American univer
sities to an unprecedented influx of
new students under the G.I. Bill of
Rights.
Three major factors in the prob
lem are: inadequate housing, short
age of teachers, and overburdened
administration. Meanwhile colleges
are turning down hundreds of vet
eran applications for admission,
due in the main to lack of proper
housing for both married and un
married students.
BRITISH PROBLEMS
Stanford has its share of the
problem, and the returned veterans
on campus are fully aware of it.
Lack of adequate housing is Stan
ford's biggest reconversion head
ache, and it has been even more
tough on the married students.
But if the former servicemen

think they are having a rugged !
time of it, they can be thankful they |
are not trying to enter a British
university where the postwar re
adjustment is far more serious.
HOUSES DAMAGED
Great Britain, like the United
States, granted her veterans a G.I.
bill. Her backlog of young men and
women serving in the armed forces j
dates from 1939. The past six years, i
plus the numbers now leaving i
school and wishing to enter colleges, j
make a total way out of proportion j
to what British institutions can ban- :
die in any one year.
Off-campus housing is more tin- .
satisfactory than that in the United i
States. Owing to damage by enemy i
action, one British house in three !
requires either repair or complete !
rebuilding. This means a consider
able reduction in living quarters,
especially if the university towns
have been bombed.

NO SOLUTION SOON
Likewise a number of college
buildings have suffered from ihe ef
fects of bomb damage. Those of
London University are a notable ex
ample.
With conditions remaining as they
are, taking nothing else into con
sideration, it will not be before 1949
that the housing difficulty is solved.
The situation is aggravated by the
fact that the whole country is still
under rigid food rationing, while
equipment and supplies such as
books, paper, and furniture are
difficult to obtain.
It is true that in America a
greater percentage of the popula
tion goes to college in Great Brit
ain. But this is balanced by the
greater number of colleges in pro
portion to the population in the
United States than in England. So
on the whole returned servicemen
would find a more favorable situa
tion in the United States.

sideration, it will not be before 1949
that the housing difficulty is solved.
The situation is aggravated by the
fact that the whole country is still
under rigid food rationing, while
equipment and supplies such as
books, paper, and furniture are
difficult to obtain.
It is true that in America a
greater percentage of the popula
tion goes to college in Great Brit
ain. But this is balanced by the
greater number of colleges in pro
portion to the population in the
United States than in England. So
on the whole returned servicemen
would find a more favorable situa
tion in the United States.
High up on the list of reconver
sion problems since V-J Day is the
readjustment of American univer
sities to an unprecedented influx of
new students under the G.I. Bill of
Rights.
Three major factors in the prob
lem are: inadequate housing, short
age of teachers, and overburdened
administration. Meanwhile colleges
are turning down hundreds of vet
eran applications for admission,
due in the main to lack of proper
housing for both married and un
married students.
BRITISH PROBLEMS
Stanford has its share of the
problem, and the returned veterans
on campus are fully aware of it.
Lack of adequate housing is Stan
ford's biggest reconversion head
ache, and it has been even more
tough on the married students.
But if the former servicemen

think they are having a rugged !
time of it, they can be thankful they |
are not trying to enter a British
university where the postwar re
adjustment is far more serious.
HOUSES DAMAGED
Great Britain, like the United
States, granted her veterans a G.I.
bill. Her backlog of young men and
women serving in the armed forces j
dates from 1939. The past six years, i
plus the numbers now leaving i
school and wishing to enter colleges, j
make a total way out of proportion j
to what British institutions can ban- :
die in any one year.
Off-campus housing is more tin- .
satisfactory than that in the United i
States. Owing to damage by enemy i
action, one British house in three !
requires either repair or complete !
rebuilding. This means a consider
able reduction in living quarters,
especially if the university towns
have been bombed.

NO SOLUTION SOON
Likewise a number of college
buildings have suffered from ihe ef
fects of bomb damage. Those of
London University are a notable ex
ample.
With conditions remaining as they
are, taking nothing else into con
sideration, it will not be before 1949
that the housing difficulty is solved.
