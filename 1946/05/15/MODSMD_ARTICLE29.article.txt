# Chicago Scientists Tell What A-Bomb Can Do; What Can Be Done About It
## 
### 
THE ATOMIC BOMB: FACTS
AND IMPLICATIONS — Written
and published by the Atomic Sci
entists of Chicago. (12 pages. 25
cents.
A significant booklet is appearing j
on the bookshelves of the nation. In J
concise, straightforward tones the !
atomic scientists of Chicago tell the ,
story of the atomic bomb, and what
it means to every person on earth.
The report begins with Philip
Morrison's Senate committee ac
count of the bomb's effect on Hiro
shima. The description of the un- |
believable havoc resulting from the |
release of sub-atomic energy is j
must reading for anyone who thinks I
the atomic bomb is "just* another i
weapon."
MASS PRODUCTION
FOR MASS DESTRUCTION
The wreckage from the searing ■
blast and the slow, painful death I
from the gamma rays both tell the
same story—this is the ultimate in !
mass destruction. The report goes !
on to state that within five to ten
years many nations will be pro
ducing atomic bombs at a small j
fraction of the money and effort I
spent by the United States on vari
ous atomic projects during the war
years.
THE SOLUTION:
WORLD CONTROL
The "pushbutton" war of. the
future is next discussed as radio
triggered atomic bombs placed
beforehand at strategic positions
explode simultaneously in the vic
tim's major cities. Since the ba- !
sic material of the bomb, U-2115
or Pu-2!19, emits no tell-tale ra- I
diation, detection from a distance j
becomes practically impossible, j
Thus, by using this method of at- i
tack, anonymous wars could start
and the enemy could invade the j
country before the victim is able j
to discover who the aggressor is. >

Shown also is the grim prospect
of long-range rockets — similar to
the German V-4 in preparation to
raid the United States from Czecho
slovakia— swarming into the vic
tim's cities, unhampered by any
possibility of defense. Even if 900
out ol 1,000 are shot down, a figure
fantastically high, the 100 that get
through could completely destroy
all the major cities of the nation. It
is pointed out that England was un
able to shoot down a single V -2
rocket, and that a 100 per cent ef
fective defense against saturation
raids is out of the question.
Hie booklet analyzes every con
ceivable type of defense against
atomic attacks. All are ruled out as
totally ineffective except one—com
plete decentralization of the na
tion's economy and population. The
cost, necessitating an unbearable
totalitarian control to effectuate, is
estimated at .'<oo billion dollars. The
net result gained would be that the
enemy would have to attack with
several thousand bombs instead of
several hundred.
The </nly solution, say the sci
entists. is control on a world scale.
History has proved that agree
ments between sovereign nations
arc meaningless. The enforce
ment must come from an author
ity higher than the nation. Such a
control, if instituted at once,
might possibly forestall an atomic
war. Preventing atomic bomb
production by means of the de
naturing process announced in the
State Department's Lilienthal-

Acheson report is technically
feasible.
BETTER CITIES
OR NO CITIES?
The peacetime uses of atomic en
ergy are pictured as offering dazz
ling possibilities. Small million
kilowatt powerplants rivaling Grand
Coulee are envisioned, for one
pounds of uranium is capable of
yielding enough energy to supply
the total power consumption of the
United States for a quarter of an
hour. Rich areas like Alaska are
seen becoming highly productive.
Clean, sparkling cities, free from
soot, heated by an atomic central
heating plant, is another outlook for
the future.
It must he emphasized, of course,
that these wonders can he possible
only if science is not shackled,
and a new dark age begun by
these who think that the work
ings of the atom is nature's spe
cial secret, revealed only to sci
entists residing in the United
States.
ARE YOU READY
FOR A-DAY?
In these few pages the atomic sci
entists have posed a problem. What
will be our answer? Shall we fol
low the beaten paths of history, too
weak to meet the challenge oi a
new age? With each passing hour,
all over the world, each nation pre
pares for A-Day. Perhaps we need
one more war to convince us. Per
haps out of a civilization in ruins
will arise One World at last. —Art

THE ATOMIC BOMB: FACTS
AND IMPLICATIONS — Written
and published by the Atomic Sci
entists of Chicago. (12 pages. 25
cents.
A significant booklet is appearing j
on the bookshelves of the nation. In J
concise, straightforward tones the !
atomic scientists of Chicago tell the ,
story of the atomic bomb, and what
it means to every person on earth.
The report begins with Philip
Morrison's Senate committee ac
count of the bomb's effect on Hiro
shima. The description of the un- |
believable havoc resulting from the |
release of sub-atomic energy is j
must reading for anyone who thinks I
the atomic bomb is "just* another i
weapon."
MASS PRODUCTION
FOR MASS DESTRUCTION
The wreckage from the searing ■
blast and the slow, painful death I
from the gamma rays both tell the
same story—this is the ultimate in !
mass destruction. The report goes !
on to state that within five to ten
years many nations will be pro
ducing atomic bombs at a small j
fraction of the money and effort I
spent by the United States on vari
ous atomic projects during the war
years.
THE SOLUTION:
WORLD CONTROL
The "pushbutton" war of. the
future is next discussed as radio
triggered atomic bombs placed
beforehand at strategic positions
explode simultaneously in the vic
tim's major cities. Since the ba- !
sic material of the bomb, U-2115
or Pu-2!19, emits no tell-tale ra- I
diation, detection from a distance j
becomes practically impossible, j
Thus, by using this method of at- i
tack, anonymous wars could start
and the enemy could invade the j
country before the victim is able j
to discover who the aggressor is. >

Shown also is the grim prospect
of long-range rockets — similar to
the German V-4 in preparation to
raid the United States from Czecho
slovakia— swarming into the vic
tim's cities, unhampered by any
possibility of defense. Even if 900
out ol 1,000 are shot down, a figure
fantastically high, the 100 that get
through could completely destroy
all the major cities of the nation. It
is pointed out that England was un
able to shoot down a single V -2
rocket, and that a 100 per cent ef
fective defense against saturation
raids is out of the question.
Hie booklet analyzes every con
ceivable type of defense against
atomic attacks. All are ruled out as
totally ineffective except one—com
plete decentralization of the na
tion's economy and population. The
cost, necessitating an unbearable
totalitarian control to effectuate, is
estimated at .'<oo billion dollars. The
net result gained would be that the
enemy would have to attack with
several thousand bombs instead of
several hundred.
The </nly solution, say the sci
entists. is control on a world scale.
History has proved that agree
ments between sovereign nations
arc meaningless. The enforce
ment must come from an author
ity higher than the nation. Such a
control, if instituted at once,
might possibly forestall an atomic
war. Preventing atomic bomb
production by means of the de
naturing process announced in the
State Department's Lilienthal-

Acheson report is technically
feasible.
BETTER CITIES
OR NO CITIES?
The peacetime uses of atomic en
ergy are pictured as offering dazz
ling possibilities. Small million
kilowatt powerplants rivaling Grand
Coulee are envisioned, for one
pounds of uranium is capable of
yielding enough energy to supply
the total power consumption of the
United States for a quarter of an
hour. Rich areas like Alaska are
seen becoming highly productive.
Clean, sparkling cities, free from
soot, heated by an atomic central
heating plant, is another outlook for
the future.
It must he emphasized, of course,
that these wonders can he possible
only if science is not shackled,
and a new dark age begun by
these who think that the work
ings of the atom is nature's spe
cial secret, revealed only to sci
entists residing in the United
States.

THE ATOMIC BOMB: FACTS
AND IMPLICATIONS — Written
and published by the Atomic Sci
entists of Chicago. (12 pages. 25
cents.
A significant booklet is appearing j
on the bookshelves of the nation. In J
concise, straightforward tones the !
atomic scientists of Chicago tell the ,
story of the atomic bomb, and what
it means to every person on earth.
The report begins with Philip
Morrison's Senate committee ac
count of the bomb's effect on Hiro
shima. The description of the un- |
believable havoc resulting from the |
release of sub-atomic energy is j
must reading for anyone who thinks I
the atomic bomb is "just* another i
weapon."
MASS PRODUCTION
FOR MASS DESTRUCTION
The wreckage from the searing ■
blast and the slow, painful death I
from the gamma rays both tell the
same story—this is the ultimate in !
mass destruction. The report goes !
on to state that within five to ten
years many nations will be pro
ducing atomic bombs at a small j
fraction of the money and effort I
spent by the United States on vari
ous atomic projects during the war
years.
THE SOLUTION:
WORLD CONTROL
The "pushbutton" war of. the
future is next discussed as radio
triggered atomic bombs placed
beforehand at strategic positions
explode simultaneously in the vic
tim's major cities. Since the ba- !
sic material of the bomb, U-2115
or Pu-2!19, emits no tell-tale ra- I
diation, detection from a distance j
becomes practically impossible, j
Thus, by using this method of at- i
tack, anonymous wars could start
and the enemy could invade the j
country before the victim is able j
to discover who the aggressor is. >

Shown also is the grim prospect
of long-range rockets — similar to
the German V-4 in preparation to
raid the United States from Czecho
slovakia— swarming into the vic
tim's cities, unhampered by any
possibility of defense. Even if 900
out ol 1,000 are shot down, a figure
fantastically high, the 100 that get
through could completely destroy
all the major cities of the nation. It
is pointed out that England was un
able to shoot down a single V -2
rocket, and that a 100 per cent ef
fective defense against saturation
raids is out of the question.
Hie booklet analyzes every con
ceivable type of defense against
atomic attacks. All are ruled out as
totally ineffective except one—com
plete decentralization of the na
tion's economy and population. The
cost, necessitating an unbearable
totalitarian control to effectuate, is
estimated at .'<oo billion dollars. The
net result gained would be that the
enemy would have to attack with
several thousand bombs instead of
several hundred.
The </nly solution, say the sci
entists. is control on a world scale.
History has proved that agree
ments between sovereign nations
arc meaningless. The enforce
ment must come from an author
ity higher than the nation. Such a
control, if instituted at once,
might possibly forestall an atomic
war. Preventing atomic bomb
production by means of the de
naturing process announced in the
State Department's Lilienthal-

Acheson report is technically
feasible.
BETTER CITIES
OR NO CITIES?
The peacetime uses of atomic en
ergy are pictured as offering dazz
ling possibilities. Small million
kilowatt powerplants rivaling Grand
Coulee are envisioned, for one
pounds of uranium is capable of
yielding enough energy to supply
the total power consumption of the
United States for a quarter of an
hour. Rich areas like Alaska are
seen becoming highly productive.
Clean, sparkling cities, free from
soot, heated by an atomic central
heating plant, is another outlook for
the future.
It must he emphasized, of course,
that these wonders can he possible
only if science is not shackled,
and a new dark age begun by
these who think that the work
ings of the atom is nature's spe
cial secret, revealed only to sci
entists residing in the United
