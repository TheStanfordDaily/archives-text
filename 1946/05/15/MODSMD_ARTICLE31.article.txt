# Farm Plays Host to Bears At Sunken Diamond Today
## 
### 
The Indians get a chance to even
the count with California this af
ternoon on the Sunken Diamond
when the Farm plays host to the
Bears in a CIBA contest slated to
start at 3 p.m.
Coach Harry Wolter's aggrega
tion, plagued by ill luck and worse
ball-handling, are currently resid
ing in the league cellar with but one
victory in nine starts, one of the
losses being at the hands of UC.
Wolter will start Dick Flatland,
his No. 1 hurler, in hopes of re
trieving at least one victory from
the Blue and Gold forces, which is
badly needed to bolster the sagging
Cardinal morale following the de
bacle of last week.
Chances for an Indian victory are
about 50-50; the Farm at least gave
LJSC a better run for its money Sat
urday afternoon in losing by 7-G,
than did the Bears in dropping a
paii' week before to the same team.
In hitting, the Cards look good,
except perhaps in the clutch, but at
any rate they can score runs, which
is the object of the game. How

ever, they have a bad habit of
throwing (literally) away ball games
by pulling more boners per game
than any team seen around here in
a long time.
The pitching has been good, not
superlative, but good, and were it
not for the boots involved the In
dians would have a considerably
handsomer game average than they
now possess. Flatland, who pitched
a very good game Friday only to
see his teammates throw it away
should do the same today, and that
leaves it up to the rest of the team.
Southpaw Virge Butler, who holds
an early season 6 to 3 victory over
the Farm will probably start for
Clint Evans' forces on the mound.
Butler hurled a seven-hitter last
time on his home field, but (iv 6 In
dian errors kicked that ballgame
out of the park in no uncertain
terms.
Whether or not this one can be
contained within the park remains
to be seen, but at any rate, it should
at least be interesting from what
ever vantage point you choose to
view the proceedings?

is the object of the game. How

ever, they have a bad habit of
throwing (literally) away ball games
by pulling more boners per game
than any team seen around here in
a long time.
The pitching has been good, not
superlative, but good, and were it
not for the boots involved the In
dians would have a considerably
handsomer game average than they
now possess. Flatland, who pitched
a very good game Friday only to
see his teammates throw it away
should do the same today, and that
leaves it up to the rest of the team.
Southpaw Virge Butler, who holds
an early season 6 to 3 victory over
the Farm will probably start for
Clint Evans' forces on the mound.
Butler hurled a seven-hitter last
time on his home field, but (iv 6 In
dian errors kicked that ballgame
out of the park in no uncertain
terms.
Whether or not this one can be
contained within the park remains
to be seen, but at any rate, it should
at least be interesting from what
ever vantage point you choose to
view the proceedings?
