NLJW YORK. May 14 (UP).â€”Car
dinal Lefty Max Lanier worked his
hex against the Brooklyn Dodgers
overtime today, but it came through
for him in the 11th inning when St.
Louis scored twice to win a hectic
game, 7 to 5, in the big National
League series for first place.
The Cardinals shaved Brooklyn's
lead to a single game. It was Lan
ier's 21.st victory against seven de
feats in games with the Dodgers
since he came into the league in
19:59.
''I don't know why I happen to
have such good luck against Brook
lyn, but the boys always seem to
come through with enough hits to
put me over," Lanier said.
That was the case today because
the North Carolina southpaw was in
enough trouble to need a battery
of lawyers. Given a 5 to 0 lead by
his teammates, he seemed to be
within coasting distance of his fifth
straight victory when the Dodgers
broke loose to score three runs in
the fourth inning.
The Dodgers kept pecking away
at Lanier and added single runs in
the sixth and seventh to tie the
score. Billy Herman and Dixie
Walker gave Lanier the most trou
ble, each getting three hits. Walker
drove in two runs with a fourth -
inning triple and sent around an
other later with a. single.
Marty Marion, whose fielding
brilliance at shortstop obscures the
fact that occasionally he is a great
clutch hitter, won the game for the
Cards in the 11th with a sharp sin
gle that scored Stan Musial and
George Kurowski. The Cards made
15 hits off four Brooklyn pitchers
to come out of a batting slump.
Kurowski got four and Marion made
three.
In the American League, the Bos
ton Red Sox maintained their five
and a half game lead over the Yan
kees by beating the White Sox. 3 to
0 at Chicago behind Dave (Boo)
Ferriss' two-hit pitching. Rudy
York got two of the four Boston hits
oil' Joe Haynes, a two-run homer
and double. It was the 17th victory
in 18 games for Boston.
Homers by Bill Dickey, Joe Gor
don and Joe DiMaggio gave the
Yankees all their runs in a 6 to 2
triumph over the Browns at St.
Louis. Dickey and Gordon got
theirs in the second inning to give
pitcher Floyd Bevens a 3 to 0 lead
and DiMaggio delivered a three-run
homer in the ninth, his seventh of
the year, to make victory doubly
sure.
Washington made no bones about
wrecking Detroit's eight-game win
ning streak, humiliating the Tigers
with a 20-hit, 15 to 1 victory, the
most one-sided in the majors this
season. Roger Wolff, Senator
knuckleballer, had a shutout until
the ninth when rookie Anse Moore
hit a homer. Buddy Lewis led the
nats with a homer, double, and sin
gle. batting in five runs and scoring
three himself. Jeff Heath hit three
doubles and a single to drive in four
runs.
Pittsburgh at Boston and Cincin
natti at New York in the National
were night games.
