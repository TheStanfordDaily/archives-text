# Girls' Softball Draws Action
## 
### MINNIE HUSSAH 
Women's Softball is slated for ac
tion this afternoon in the Wednes
day League. Tomorrow the girls in
the Thursday League go into ac
tion. The Tuesday League games
were postponed, and at press time
it was not known when the games
will be played. Early Sunday morn
ing looms as a possible time, how
ever.
Eucalypto and Branner draw top
honors today. Both teams are un
defeated, and are tied for first place.
The game rates strictly as a toss
up, although if the umpire is bribed
the whole outlook changes.
GRANADA PLAYS ROBLE
Another Wednesday League con
test pits the Granada nine against
Roble 3 Center. Granada is cur
rently in the cellar, and Roble is
one notch above. This writer, with
cool confidence, picks Roble to win
because of superior fielding. In fact
the fielding has been so good, a
triple play by the girls is not out of
the picture.
Cubberley and Russell go at it in
another Wednesday tilt. Russell has
been reinforced by some of the ma
jor league teams, who have farmed
out some players to this league.
Cubberley, on the other hand, has
had such promising material that
some of the major t earns have
grabbed two or three players. With
that information in mind, this writer
picks Russell to win by three runs.
