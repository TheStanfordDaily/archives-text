Will Connolly reported in the
Chronicle the other day that one ol i
the main reasons why the Univer
sity of San Francisco was attracting
so many grid stars was because
Clipper Smith, mentor at the Don
school, would take prospective stu- j
dents into his office and show them |
a panorama of the city. The beauti- !
ful sites in the vicinity offered con- j
vincing evidence that USF was the I
best school to go to.
Could that be the only reason j
that such luminaries are planning
on attending the San Francisco uni- :
versity?

Track coach Jack Weiershauser
wasn't kidding when he told Smiley
Farkas that he needed hurdlers,
broad]umpers, and weightmen to |
turn out for the squad in time to
compete in the Big Meet. As mat
ters now stand, the meet with Cal i
rates about even on paper, with a P
possible advantage to State U.
If Stanford is able to take a few
seconds and thirds in (he events
mentioned above, the weight
would he thrown to our side, and
we could come up on top. Other
wise, Cal—with not exceptionally
good men—will place in those
events, and we'll have to wait
one more year to try and beat
the Blue and Cold.

Intramural swimming grabs the j
limelight next week, with an all-
University meet slated. Next Tues
day, the trials will be run off, and
on Thursday afternoon the final
events will be held in the Encina
Pools.
All students except varsity men
are eligible and they may enter in
dividually or with team colors.

Events to be held are the 50. 100,
and 150 free style; the 75-yard
backstroke and breaststroke; and
diving completes the agenda.

This afternoon, Stanford meets
California for the second time in
a baseball contest. Berkeley won
in the first outing, and by record
comparisons are fatored to grab
the second tilt. If the Stanford in
field gets as jump as some Mexi
can jumping beans, the game is a
sure goner, but if they hold to
gether, as they have done at
times, the chances for victory are
good.

And speaking of poverty, six
Stanford students were stranded on
the Oakland Bay Bridge last Friday
night when the sextet couldn't pool
the necessary tariff to cross the
bridge. With glum expectations of
spending the night on the suspen
sion bridge, one of the six suggested
that they give the toll collector a
pint of "hooch" that was resting se
curely in the glove compartment.
But some friends happened to be
driving by and noticed the car
stranded, so all was saved, includ
ing the booze.

one more year to try and beat

Intramural swimming grabs the j
limelight next week, with an all-
University meet slated. Next Tues
day, the trials will be run off, and
on Thursday afternoon the final
events will be held in the Encina
Pools.
All students except varsity men
are eligible and they may enter in
dividually or with team colors.

Events to be held are the 50. 100,
and 150 free style; the 75-yard
backstroke and breaststroke; and
diving completes the agenda.

This afternoon, Stanford meets
California for the second time in
a baseball contest. Berkeley won
in the first outing, and by record
comparisons are fatored to grab
the second tilt. If the Stanford in
field gets as jump as some Mexi
can jumping beans, the game is a
sure goner, but if they hold to
gether, as they have done at
times, the chances for victory are
good.

And speaking of poverty, six
Stanford students were stranded on
the Oakland Bay Bridge last Friday
night when the sextet couldn't pool
the necessary tariff to cross the
bridge. With glum expectations of
spending the night on the suspen
sion bridge, one of the six suggested
that they give the toll collector a
pint of "hooch" that was resting se
curely in the glove compartment.
But some friends happened to be
driving by and noticed the car
stranded, so all was saved, includ
ing the booze.
Will Connolly reported in the
Chronicle the other day that one ol i
the main reasons why the Univer
sity of San Francisco was attracting
so many grid stars was because
Clipper Smith, mentor at the Don
school, would take prospective stu- j
dents into his office and show them |
a panorama of the city. The beauti- !
ful sites in the vicinity offered con- j
vincing evidence that USF was the I
best school to go to.
Could that be the only reason j
that such luminaries are planning
on attending the San Francisco uni- :
versity?

Track coach Jack Weiershauser
wasn't kidding when he told Smiley
Farkas that he needed hurdlers,
broad]umpers, and weightmen to |
turn out for the squad in time to
compete in the Big Meet. As mat
ters now stand, the meet with Cal i
rates about even on paper, with a P
possible advantage to State U.
If Stanford is able to take a few
seconds and thirds in (he events
mentioned above, the weight
would he thrown to our side, and
we could come up on top. Other
wise, Cal—with not exceptionally
good men—will place in those
events, and we'll have to wait
one more year to try and beat
the Blue and Cold.
