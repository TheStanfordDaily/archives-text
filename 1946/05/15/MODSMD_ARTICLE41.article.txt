# Alumnus Active During Philippine Guerrilla Warfare
## 
### DOUG MACKEY 
Another ex-Stanford man has re
turned to the United States, his
war-time duty done.
It was only a few months ago that j
quiet, balding Don Robinson, guid- j
ing spirit of an impromptu organi- j
zation of Moro guerrillas, was pass- i
ing the time inspecting detached Jap ;
heads brought by his "rangers" to j
his Philippine Island plantation
home.
BACK TO THE STATES
Today Don and his wife, Ann, are j
back in the United States for the j
first time in 33 years. Though car- !
lied on the passenger list of the
transport General Bundy as "re
covered from enemy custody," the
Robinsons' story is one of ingenuity j
and hardship in eluding the Japa- j
nese invaders for more than three J
years.
From the time that they went !
into hiding in the hills of Balisan, j
near Zamboanga, February 25, 1942,
until it was safe to return to their j
plantation home on April 5, 1945,
Don and Ann saw no white people, ]
had no regular food, and just man- j
aged to keep one jump ahead of
the enemy.
GUERRILLA BAND ORGANIZED
When it was safe to return home, i
the Robinsons decided to clean out
scattered Japs in the hills of their
island and organized Moro friends j
for the purpose. Guns and ammu- 1
nition had to come from the enemy, I
and the Moros' procurement system [
was to waylay unsuspecting Nips, j
kill them, and bring home their [
weapons. Jap heads which were j
brought to the Robinsons as me
mentos were returned to the do- j
nors.
The Robinsons might have re- |
mained in the Philippines indefi- I

nitely after the surrender, but the
rugged life of the hunted had im
paired Mrs. Robinson's health to
the extent that the trip home was
ordered by her doctor.
STANFORD CAREER TOLI)
Mr, Robinson was at Stanford in
1902 and 1903. He majored in law
but transferred to the University
of Texas where he received the
LL.B. in 190f». He practiced law for
a while in Dallas, married Ann —
just returned from her study of vio
lin in Berlin —and decided that of
the many places he had seen in
his world-wide travels he'd like to
set up house in the southern Philip
pines. This is their first trip back
since then.
Nationwide fame came to the
Robinsons early this year when
their work with the Moro "Ran
gers" was discovered by a visiting
American officer who wrote a mag
azine article on their adventures.
Product of their Jap-dodging ad
ventures is a 180.000-word book
which Don hopes will be published
in the very near future.


GUERILLA FIGHTING still
continues in the Philippines, in
spite, or perhaps because, of the
election of Manuel Roxas as pres
ident of the Commonwealth. The
peasants, who live under feudal
conditions, liglit Roxas' "military
police," for in their opinion he is
a reactionary eager to turn the
Philippines over to United States
big business interests.

pines. This is their first trip back
since then.
Nationwide fame came to the
Robinsons early this year when
their work with the Moro "Ran
gers" was discovered by a visiting
American officer who wrote a mag

GUERILLA FIGHTING still
continues in the Philippines, in
spite, or perhaps because, of the
election of Manuel Roxas as pres
ident of the Commonwealth. The
peasants, who live under feudal
conditions, liglit Roxas' "military
police," for in their opinion he is
a reactionary eager to turn the
Philippines over to United States
big business interests.
Another ex-Stanford man has re
turned to the United States, his
war-time duty done.
It was only a few months ago that j
quiet, balding Don Robinson, guid- j
ing spirit of an impromptu organi- j
zation of Moro guerrillas, was pass- i
ing the time inspecting detached Jap ;
heads brought by his "rangers" to j
his Philippine Island plantation
home.
BACK TO THE STATES
Today Don and his wife, Ann, are j
back in the United States for the j
first time in 33 years. Though car- !
lied on the passenger list of the
transport General Bundy as "re
covered from enemy custody," the
Robinsons' story is one of ingenuity j
and hardship in eluding the Japa- j
nese invaders for more than three J
years.
From the time that they went !
into hiding in the hills of Balisan, j
near Zamboanga, February 25, 1942,
until it was safe to return to their j
plantation home on April 5, 1945,
Don and Ann saw no white people, ]
had no regular food, and just man- j
aged to keep one jump ahead of
the enemy.
GUERRILLA BAND ORGANIZED
When it was safe to return home, i
the Robinsons decided to clean out
scattered Japs in the hills of their
island and organized Moro friends j
for the purpose. Guns and ammu- 1
nition had to come from the enemy, I
and the Moros' procurement system [
was to waylay unsuspecting Nips, j
kill them, and bring home their [
weapons. Jap heads which were j
brought to the Robinsons as me
mentos were returned to the do- j
nors.
The Robinsons might have re- |
mained in the Philippines indefi- I

nitely after the surrender, but the
rugged life of the hunted had im
paired Mrs. Robinson's health to
the extent that the trip home was
ordered by her doctor.
STANFORD CAREER TOLI)
Mr, Robinson was at Stanford in
1902 and 1903. He majored in law
but transferred to the University
of Texas where he received the
LL.B. in 190f». He practiced law for
a while in Dallas, married Ann —
just returned from her study of vio
lin in Berlin —and decided that of
the many places he had seen in
his world-wide travels he'd like to
set up house in the southern Philip
pines. This is their first trip back
since then.
