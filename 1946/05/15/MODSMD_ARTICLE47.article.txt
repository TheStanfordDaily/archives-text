# Admiral Stresses Need For Bikini Atom Tests
## 
### BILL STEIF 
Vice-Admiral W. H. P. Blandy,
commander of the joint Army-Navy
task force which will conduct the
atomic bomb tests in Bikini atoll
early in July, stated yesterday in a
San Francisco press conference that
he hoped the bomb "can be abol
ished by international agreement"
but that until such a "long and du
bious process" can be completed it
is "necessary for national defense
that we conduct these tests."
Admiral Blandy left by plane last
night for Pearl Harbor where he is
to board his flagship, the passenger
cargo transport Mt. McKinley. He
flew from Washington, D.C., yester
day morning.
KNOWS BOMB'S POWER
In justifying "Operation Cross
roads" the admiral declared that
"the Navy must see what the
bomh can do against us." Admiral
Blandy said this is the only way
in which adequate data can be
gathered for the protection of men
and ships in case the weapon is
ever used against the United
States.
In explaining plans for the Bikini
experiment, Admiral Blandy re
vealed that the primary target ship
of the 77 ships that will be gathered
in the atoll will be painted a bright
orange-red and equipped with a
radar beacon so that the Army Air
Force bomber which will drop the
bomb might come as close to the
target as possible. The primary tar
get will be the battleship Nevada.
WEATHER IMPORTANT
The admiral pointed out that the
77 ships will be in much closer
formation than they would ordi
narily be under battle conditions
and that "Operation Crossroads" is
not intended to simulate actual bat
tle conditions. He slated that the
first test —a dropped bomb intended

to explode several hundred feet
above the grouped ships — would
take place as soon after the first of
July as possible.
"The weather," he said, "has a
great deal to do with exactly when
the first bomb will be dropped. We
require excellent visibility for our
high-altitude bomber and favorable
winds so that fission by-products
are blown away from our observer
ships."
SHIPS CLOSE TOGETHER
If the weather is favorable the
Admiral estimated that the nearest
observers would be approximately
ten miles away from the center of
the atomic explosion.
Admiral Blandy also stated that
the ships are being grouped so
closely because the Navy wants to
discover what effects the detonation
will have on ships at graduated dis
tances from the heart of the test.
II NATIONS INVITED
Asked about plans to keep "un
friendly observers" away from, the
experiment, the admiral replied that
a warning would be published in
"international notices to mariners"
to stay away from the Bikini area
but that "otherwise there is nothing
in international law to keep ships
out of the target area." He noted
that 11 nations had been invited to
send observers to the test.
Admiral Blandy also said that
there would be approximately 10,-
000 instruments used to measure
the results of the experiment and
that these instruments ranged all
the way from "simple five-gallon
cans used as pressure gauges to

complex automatic radios, radio
controlled cameras in radio-con
trolled planes and boats, and tele
vision."
DEEP-WATER TEST
When asked when and where the
much-discussed deep-water explo
sion of the third atomic bomb will
take place, Admiral Blandy replied
that he thought the Bikini area
would again be used "as early as
possible next year."
The second bomb will be detonat
ed, according to the admiral, some
where between the water's surface
and 30 fathoms down as soon after
the air explosion as is practicable.

the results of the experiment and
that these instruments ranged all
the way from "simple five-gallon
cans used as pressure gauges to

complex automatic radios, radio
controlled cameras in radio-con
trolled planes and boats, and tele
vision."
DEEP-WATER TEST
When asked when and where the
much-discussed deep-water explo
sion of the third atomic bomb will
take place, Admiral Blandy replied
that he thought the Bikini area
would again be used "as early as
possible next year."
The second bomb will be detonat
ed, according to the admiral, some
where between the water's surface
and 30 fathoms down as soon after
the air explosion as is practicable.
Vice-Admiral W. H. P. Blandy,
commander of the joint Army-Navy
task force which will conduct the
atomic bomb tests in Bikini atoll
early in July, stated yesterday in a
San Francisco press conference that
he hoped the bomb "can be abol
ished by international agreement"
but that until such a "long and du
bious process" can be completed it
is "necessary for national defense
that we conduct these tests."
Admiral Blandy left by plane last
night for Pearl Harbor where he is
to board his flagship, the passenger
cargo transport Mt. McKinley. He
flew from Washington, D.C., yester
day morning.
KNOWS BOMB'S POWER
In justifying "Operation Cross
roads" the admiral declared that
"the Navy must see what the
bomh can do against us." Admiral
Blandy said this is the only way
in which adequate data can be
gathered for the protection of men
and ships in case the weapon is
ever used against the United
States.
In explaining plans for the Bikini
experiment, Admiral Blandy re
vealed that the primary target ship
of the 77 ships that will be gathered
in the atoll will be painted a bright
orange-red and equipped with a
radar beacon so that the Army Air
Force bomber which will drop the
bomb might come as close to the
target as possible. The primary tar
get will be the battleship Nevada.
WEATHER IMPORTANT
The admiral pointed out that the
77 ships will be in much closer
formation than they would ordi
narily be under battle conditions
and that "Operation Crossroads" is
not intended to simulate actual bat
tle conditions. He slated that the
first test —a dropped bomb intended

to explode several hundred feet
above the grouped ships — would
take place as soon after the first of
July as possible.
"The weather," he said, "has a
great deal to do with exactly when
the first bomb will be dropped. We
require excellent visibility for our
high-altitude bomber and favorable
winds so that fission by-products
are blown away from our observer
ships."
SHIPS CLOSE TOGETHER
If the weather is favorable the
Admiral estimated that the nearest
observers would be approximately
ten miles away from the center of
the atomic explosion.
Admiral Blandy also stated that
the ships are being grouped so
closely because the Navy wants to
discover what effects the detonation
will have on ships at graduated dis
tances from the heart of the test.
II NATIONS INVITED
Asked about plans to keep "un
friendly observers" away from, the
experiment, the admiral replied that
a warning would be published in
"international notices to mariners"
to stay away from the Bikini area
but that "otherwise there is nothing
in international law to keep ships
out of the target area." He noted
that 11 nations had been invited to
send observers to the test.
Admiral Blandy also said that
there would be approximately 10,-
000 instruments used to measure
the results of the experiment and
that these instruments ranged all
the way from "simple five-gallon
cans used as pressure gauges to

complex automatic radios, radio
controlled cameras in radio-con
trolled planes and boats, and tele
vision."
