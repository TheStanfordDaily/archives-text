### 
LONDON, May 14 (UP).â€”Foreign
Secretary Ernest Bevin has told
Secretary of State James F. Byrnes
that Britain will not consider ced
ing any of its Pacific island bases to
the United States at this time, in
formed sources said today.
The British viewpoint was au
thoritatively reported to be that the
Uniled States should have full ac
cess to Pacific bases under a region
al plan, for South Pacific defense, in
which the United Kingdom, the
United States, Australia, and New
Zealand should jointly share.
The joint Commonwealth atti
tude, as reported here, was that this
defense scheme has priority over
the question of sovereignty and is
entirely separate from it.
The next step in the Pacific base
question, it was understood, will be
discussions in Washington between
United States State Department
representatives and Australian and
New Zealand officials.
