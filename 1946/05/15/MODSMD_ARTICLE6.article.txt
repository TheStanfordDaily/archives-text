TOKYO, Wednesday, May 15
(UP). â€”Lt. Gen. Kuzma Dercvyan
ko, Russian member of the four
power Allied Control Council,
charged today that Gen. Douglas
Mac-Arthur was failing to carry out.
the Moscow conference terms by
his refusal to give the council more
than 48 hours' advance notice on
his directives.
The blunt-speaking Soviet gen
eral officer, who has needled the
supreme commander in prior meet
ings of the four-power council, said
Mac Arthur's short notice gives the
council members no time in which
to consult their governments for
their opinions on directives.
Derevyanko's statement drew the
fire of George Atcheson, Mac A
rthur's personal representative on
the Council from the State Depart
ment.
Atcheson replied the purpose of
the council, which has merely con
sultative power, was to aid Mac-
Arthur and that any change in the
system was "unjustifiable and un
desirable interference."
