# Union Adopts Twelve-Point Program for Conservation
## 
### 
Union Unit girls, at a special
meeting Monday night, voted to cut
all wheat from their menus, and
yesterday revised this policy in a
12-point pledge which has been
posted on the bulletin board in the
dining room for the girls' signa
tures.
The text of the pledge is as fol
lows:
To conserve wheat products, fats
and oils we recommend that:
1. Not more than one wheat
product he served during any one
day, and whenever possible elim
inated entirely. Present stocks al
ready on hand are to he used in
this way to prevent their waste,
but there will he no re-ordering
of wheat products. This includes
such things as cereals, cake and
bread flour, crackers, spaghetti,
macaroni, and noodles as well as
all other wheat products.
2. No toast or sweet - bread be
served at breakfast.
3. No toast or sweet-bread made
from wheat be served at late break
fast.
4. No wheat, cereals, either cold
or hot, be served with corn or rice
cereals served as substitutes.
5. No wheat be used in any
dessert.
ti. One - crust pics be made
whenever it is deemed necessary
to serve pie.
7. No crackers or pretzels be
served with soups or appetizers.
8. No rice, spaghetti, macaroni,
or noodles he used in soups and

chowders.
9. Products such as corn, rye, ancr
Boston brown bread be substituted
for wheat breads.
10. More fruits and vegetables,
especially potatoes as a starch sub
stitute, be used.
11. Vinegar and cooked salad
dressings be substituted for oil
dressings.
12. Part of the butter formerly
served with bread and rolls be
used as seasoning in vegetables.
(A saving in fats will result from
this measure because less butter
will be used in seasoning than
when it was served to the indi
vidual.)
It was also decided that instead
of ordering rolls for the hambur
bers to be served at the Union bar
becue this Sunday, rolls should be
made from the flour now on hand
in the Union kitchen. Each ham
burger will be served on one-hall
of a roll, thus cutting consumption.
Commending the voluntary ac
tion of the students, Mrs. Dorothy
Bell, Union dining hall director,
said that she and her staff would
co-operate with the program as
much as was at all possible. Mrs.
Bell pointed out that there were
two major difficulties which
would have to be encountered.
There is quite a large supply of
flour on hand which will have to
be used up, and there will be some
times when a wheat product is ab
solutely essential for a balanced
meal.
