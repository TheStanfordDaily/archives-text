# Truman-Lewis Meeting Fails
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 15 (UP). â€”President Truman failed lo In-eak the
soft coal deadlock at another While House conference with UMW boss
John L. Lewis and a representative of the mine owners tonight and he
directed the conferees to return for another meeting at 11 a.m. (EDT) to
morrow. . i
"No progress was made toward a settlement," a White House spokes-

man announced at the end of the*
40-minutc session.
Lewis and management represen
tative Charles O'Neill refused to j
add to that statement as they j
emerged, grim-faced and silent,
from the executive mansion.
They brushed through a knot |
of reporters and cameramen and I
stalked off in opposite directions.
"The President asked us to come j
back at 11 a.m. tomorrow, and that's I
all I can say," was O'Neill's only
comment.
But there was instant specula
tion that Mr. Truman had laid
down (he law to both parties in
the dispute and warned that he
would not permit (he coal strike j
to be resumed when the present I
two-week truce expires May 25. '
The President already lias under I
consideration a proposal from Civil- \
ian Production Administrator John
Small that t.he mines bo seized il
necessary to prevent a general col
lapse of the nation's industries.
The outlook appeared gloomy for |
any speedy settlement, although j
congressional circles close to Lewis j
said they believed the controversy
might be ended by the end of this j
week with a compromise solution.
