# Dining Halls Within Quota In Food Campaign—Ricker
## 
### 
Dining halls are definitely within their food conservation
quota of a 40 per cent saving in the use of wheat and a 20 per cent
saving in fats and oils, announced Miss Christine Ricker, director
of dining halls. All conservation has been done directly in an
swer to student requests.
Miss Ricker emphasized three points which have been

* adopted for carrying out the pro
j gram:
| POTATOES, WHEAT SUBSTITUTE
First, potatoes are being used as
the main substitute for wheat prod
ucts in response to a government
request. A surplus of this food ex
ists, and potatoes cannot be shipped
to relieve the shortages abroad.
They provide the bulk and starch
i needed in a well-balanced diet, par
! ticularly now that bread is almost
, entirely omitted. Miss Richer point
| ed out, "It's far better to eat po
tatoes than to get. the same number
j of calories in a coke."
I
| Second, oatmeal will be used in
j place of other cereals as much as
i possible. "However, the University
i has in its storerooms a certain
j amount of supplies, some of which
obviously are wheat products such
I as various kinds of dry cereals," re
• ported the dining hall director.
I "Naturally these will appear on the
, menu until the supplies arc used
i up."
DON'T WASTE FOOD
Finally, Miss Kicker .stressed the
I importance of eating all of what
j is placed in front of one. For in
| stance, no saving is realized by not
| eating a roll or other wheat prod
uct when it is placed on the table.
| "Menus are planned with an over
j all program in mind. A student
sitting down at one meal cannot, see
the whole picture. The complete
menu for the day is planned to
maintain a normal balance."
CONSERVATION PROGRESS ,
The food conservation program is
already showing results, Miss Rick
er brought out. By not serving
rolls at dinner in the larger dining
halls 300 pounds of flour have al
ready been saved. The Cellar and
main Union dining room have cut
consumption of rolls 50 per cent
by making customers request bread
products.
The University is fortunate in
having its own ice cream plant, said
Miss Ricker. In this way replacing
desserts using wheat is greatly sim
plified, for ice cream and fruit are
the main dishes used as substitutes.
The problem of cutting down on
fats and oils has not been a difficult
one. A shortage of these items has
been existing for quite some time.
Consequently a large portion of the
salad dressings being used are al
ready without oil.
SPECIAL FUNCTIONS
An example of how the program
is working at special functions is
shown by the Roble tea honoring
Dean Mary Yost. Certain things
being served at the tea are avail
able because girls have voluntarily
given them up in their meals dur
ing this week under a plan worked
out with Miss Clara E. Palmer, di
rector of the Roble dining hall. Also
Roble girls will not be served any
dinner that night.
To make this foocf conservation
program really work will be up to
the students individually, empha
sized Miss Ricker. "Save on the
in - between - meal snacks, those
doughnuts in the morning at the
Cellar, the hamburgers in the af
ternoon at the drive - ins, the
spreads at night, and the birthday
cakes which can easily be given
up."

j is placed in front of one. For in

CONSERVATION PROGRESS ,
The food conservation program is
already showing results, Miss Rick
er brought out. By not serving
rolls at dinner in the larger dining
halls 300 pounds of flour have al
ready been saved. The Cellar and
main Union dining room have cut
consumption of rolls 50 per cent
by making customers request bread
products.
The University is fortunate in
having its own ice cream plant, said
Miss Ricker. In this way replacing
desserts using wheat is greatly sim
plified, for ice cream and fruit are
the main dishes used as substitutes.
The problem of cutting down on
fats and oils has not been a difficult
one. A shortage of these items has
been existing for quite some time.
Consequently a large portion of the
salad dressings being used are al
ready without oil.
SPECIAL FUNCTIONS
An example of how the program
is working at special functions is
shown by the Roble tea honoring
Dean Mary Yost. Certain things
being served at the tea are avail
able because girls have voluntarily
given them up in their meals dur
ing this week under a plan worked
out with Miss Clara E. Palmer, di
rector of the Roble dining hall. Also
Roble girls will not be served any
dinner that night.
To make this foocf conservation
program really work will be up to
the students individually, empha
sized Miss Ricker. "Save on the
in - between - meal snacks, those
doughnuts in the morning at the
Cellar, the hamburgers in the af
ternoon at the drive - ins, the
spreads at night, and the birthday
cakes which can easily be given
up."
Dining halls are definitely within their food conservation
quota of a 40 per cent saving in the use of wheat and a 20 per cent
saving in fats and oils, announced Miss Christine Ricker, director
of dining halls. All conservation has been done directly in an
swer to student requests.
Miss Ricker emphasized three points which have been
