Farm music fans may not know it, but op
por [unity with a capital "O" is beating its
on their front doorstep. And if students
turn a deaf ear to it, that little gremlin, Oppor
tunity, is going to slip quietly away, leaving
u'-: holding tho radio.
The Stanford Symphony Forum is now of
fer ng, at less than half the regular price, sea
sen tickets to next winter's Symphony con
cert reason. What's more, the Symphony has
SC'L aside a special night for Farm students,
ar.d olher students from colleeg forum chap
ters in the Bay Aiea, to hear its regular sym
phony series. That night is to be Thursday.
Now we grant that Thursday isn't too good
for many of us. Quizzes come on Fridays.
Late leave regulations prohibit regular at
tendance by many Farm women, upper divi
sion and lower. But since the Symphony's
regular concerts are played Friday after-

noons and Saturday nights, it would have
been a little nasty of the forum to ask it to
squeeze in a college forum performance on
P'riday nights.
But here are the advantages: student prices
to it in the orchesira section, for instance,
at 15 concerts (you pay only $18), a student
audience, and the regular symphony offer
ings with guest artists and all.
And, to descend to the vernacular, that
ain't hay. The Symphony loses money on
this project. They do it, however, because
they like to play for college students. They
like the enthusiasm (or disapproval, as is
sometimes the case) of a younger generation
who goes to the symphony not to raise
highbrows and mutter academic assent- but
to give their wholehearted, if amateur, ap*
proval to the work the Symphony in doing.
They like us. And we tfiink you'll like
them.- M.S.
