# Activities—There's Something Missing
## 
### 
Soms of our thoughts that have been lying
dormant for a long time deal with student
g .v.rnment—and what it lacks.
So we dusted them off and came up with
one of the main issues: not enough persons
ar :• directly concerned with our government,
because they have little part in making it
work.
1 here are plenty of separate activities, such
as drama, debate, and publications, which tie
in with the individual student's future voca
tion and special interests. But there is no
channel set up for students who would like
to start at the bottom and work up in more
general types of activities —all-campus drives,
barbecues, dances.
The closest thing to it is Activities Council,
which includes Cardinals and Rally Commit
tee. But both these groups are selective, and
Cardinals in particular is a small group which
can only serve as the top half of the organ
isation that is needed for campus functions.
We propose that if the set-up under Activi
ties Council were revised to become a large
group of students, our student government
would have broader scope and more chance
of success. For example:
1. Cardinals, instead of being an honorary
association of a few older students, could ex
pand to an over-all activities organization,
composed of all students who wanted to work

on general activities now delegated to that
group. (We think that many capable and
willing persons are now scared away from
participation since Cardinals is experience
heavy in its gualifications for membership.
And at this point there is not an adeguate way
of finding oat who those persons are.)
2. To insure effectiveness in leadership, a
hierarchy based on a point system and abil
ity —similar to that of other organizations—
could be established within Cardinals. From
this rating system, the various heads of com
mittees could be appointed, and Senior Car
dinals (or whatever title they might have)
could be chosen by the group by fair and
democratic methods.
3. Rally Com, a committee to organize
drives, and similar subsidiary commiitees
could be incorporated into such a plan as
parts of the whole activities organization.
There you have our main point. Obstacles
to a radical reorganization of this sort are
that it would take large amounts of initiative
and work, and would take the shine off the
honor-glory aspects of activity groups as they
stand today.
But if someone had the courage, and if
someone had the interest, to carry it out, we
think that the change would put a healthier
slant on activities as true services to student
government.

democratic methods.
3. Rally Com, a committee to organize
drives, and similar subsidiary commiitees
could be incorporated into such a plan as
parts of the whole activities organization.
There you have our main point. Obstacles
to a radical reorganization of this sort are
that it would take large amounts of initiative
and work, and would take the shine off the
honor-glory aspects of activity groups as they
stand today.
But if someone had the courage, and if
someone had the interest, to carry it out, we
think that the change would put a healthier
slant on activities as true services to student
government.
Soms of our thoughts that have been lying
dormant for a long time deal with student
g .v.rnment—and what it lacks.
So we dusted them off and came up with
one of the main issues: not enough persons
ar :• directly concerned with our government,
because they have little part in making it
work.
1 here are plenty of separate activities, such
as drama, debate, and publications, which tie
in with the individual student's future voca
tion and special interests. But there is no
channel set up for students who would like
to start at the bottom and work up in more
general types of activities —all-campus drives,
barbecues, dances.
The closest thing to it is Activities Council,
which includes Cardinals and Rally Commit
tee. But both these groups are selective, and
Cardinals in particular is a small group which
can only serve as the top half of the organ
isation that is needed for campus functions.
We propose that if the set-up under Activi
ties Council were revised to become a large
group of students, our student government
would have broader scope and more chance
of success. For example:
1. Cardinals, instead of being an honorary
association of a few older students, could ex
pand to an over-all activities organization,
composed of all students who wanted to work

on general activities now delegated to that
group. (We think that many capable and
willing persons are now scared away from
participation since Cardinals is experience
heavy in its gualifications for membership.
And at this point there is not an adeguate way
of finding oat who those persons are.)
2. To insure effectiveness in leadership, a
hierarchy based on a point system and abil
ity —similar to that of other organizations—
could be established within Cardinals. From
this rating system, the various heads of com
mittees could be appointed, and Senior Car
dinals (or whatever title they might have)
could be chosen by the group by fair and
democratic methods.
3. Rally Com, a committee to organize
drives, and similar subsidiary commiitees
could be incorporated into such a plan as
