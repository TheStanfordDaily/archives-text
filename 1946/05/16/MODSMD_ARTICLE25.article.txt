ATHLETICS—ENTRANCE QUALIFICATION?
112 have read and listened, with varied emotions,
to the comment circulating the campus re the arti
cle written by Stan Shpetner May 10, and the rebut
tal submitted May 13 in the Daily. From where I
1 tnnd the dissenters to Mr. Shpetner's timely article
have missed his point entirely.
I don't believe he or anyone else interested in
Stanford sports wishes to see a large influx of the
; o—called tramp athletes. What we do want to see
i Stanford maintain its high position in collegiate
athletics. This we won't do if the present policy of
admission is continued.
Light now Stanford is swamped with a record
number of applicants for entrance. Consequently,
higher requirements for admittance can be levied
to separate the chaff from the wheat. This proce
dure will practically make extinct the athlete with
average grades who in prior years could meet Stan
ford's entrance requirements; the residue won't,
•lake good competition for the junior colleges. It
is unforunate that the vast majority of athletes
are not Phi Betes as well as standouts in their
respective sports.
The problem facing future Stanford participa
tion in the Coast Conference on an equal basis
with other conference schools is this: an equitable
method for admitting athletes, who in former
>ears would have been accepted, must be reached.
Our board for admission must realize that prow
ess in athletics should be ranked next to grade
averages in personal achievement.

Past performance shows that on an average, suc
cess in future life is reached as often by the fellow
Stanford will remember as the athlete as lie who
distinguished himself during finals. Why not admit
a certain number of these men, suggested by the
coaches, on a probationary status?
If they fail to make their grades, drop them as
has been the past procedure.
Our faculty athletic representative should gel. ac
quainted with the problems lacing our coaches. A
number of our faculty look on sports as a detri
ment to learning. Yet more is to be learned on the
athletic fields in human behavior and personal re
lations than in many courses.
Now for the practical side of (bis problem, it
is no secret thai football foots the liili for our
minor sports program. Only better than average
football teams in the future will be able !o pick
up the check fftr these sports again. Only good
teams draw at the ticket booths. It's a nice ges
ture to be proud of a losing team, but from past
records, Stanford has the worst record in the
conference for suppoiling a loser.
Let us be frank and admit thai if something isn't
done we will grace the doormat of the conference
in years to come. The teams for the coming year
will be manned primarily by fellows who were ad
mitted before the war or shortly after. It is the
future wo must prepare for. Let's admit athletes
who can maintain passing grades and winning
teams.

I don't believe he or anyone else interested in
Stanford sports wishes to see a large influx of the
; o—called tramp athletes. What we do want to see
i Stanford maintain its high position in collegiate
athletics. This we won't do if the present policy of
admission is continued.
Light now Stanford is swamped with a record
number of applicants for entrance. Consequently,
higher requirements for admittance can be levied
to separate the chaff from the wheat. This proce
dure will practically make extinct the athlete with
average grades who in prior years could meet Stan
ford's entrance requirements; the residue won't,
•lake good competition for the junior colleges. It
is unforunate that the vast majority of athletes
are not Phi Betes as well as standouts in their
respective sports.
The problem facing future Stanford participa
tion in the Coast Conference on an equal basis
with other conference schools is this: an equitable
method for admitting athletes, who in former
>ears would have been accepted, must be reached.
Our board for admission must realize that prow
ess in athletics should be ranked next to grade
averages in personal achievement.

Past performance shows that on an average, suc
cess in future life is reached as often by the fellow
Stanford will remember as the athlete as lie who
distinguished himself during finals. Why not admit
a certain number of these men, suggested by the
coaches, on a probationary status?
If they fail to make their grades, drop them as
has been the past procedure.
Our faculty athletic representative should gel. ac
quainted with the problems lacing our coaches. A
number of our faculty look on sports as a detri
ment to learning. Yet more is to be learned on the
athletic fields in human behavior and personal re
lations than in many courses.
Now for the practical side of (bis problem, it
is no secret thai football foots the liili for our
minor sports program. Only better than average
football teams in the future will be able !o pick
up the check fftr these sports again. Only good
teams draw at the ticket booths. It's a nice ges
ture to be proud of a losing team, but from past
records, Stanford has the worst record in the
conference for suppoiling a loser.
Let us be frank and admit thai if something isn't
done we will grace the doormat of the conference
in years to come. The teams for the coming year
will be manned primarily by fellows who were ad
mitted before the war or shortly after. It is the
future wo must prepare for. Let's admit athletes
who can maintain passing grades and winning
teams.
