Une of the sadder little reports to come out of
Now York yesterday was the information that the
United Nations Security Council has, in effect, de
cided to bar representatives of those United Nations
not on the Security Council and newspapermen
from Security Council meetings when it is not ex
pedient for the Council to have its work reported in
full and its work known by all UN members.
'l'his is sad to lis because it indicates that the
Council—the "hig brothers" of the UN—are los
injf faith in the principle of free exchange of in
formation.
It is true that free reporting and unlimited open
M'ssions of any organization sometimes result in
j ross exaggerations and sensational twistings of
news, but the principle remains, we think, a solid
rock upon which the eventual world state must be
founded.
It is very easy to laugh about concepts such as
a world state and the total abolition of war be-

cause they seem .so dainnaidy distant now. It is
much easier to say, "Me, I'm a realist—l don't like
what that guy's saying and I'm going to shut him
up if i have to slug him to do it—the world will
never get rid of wars or differences between na
tions so let'c face it and take as much as we can
now, he as powerful as we can now."
It seems to us that (he UN Security Council is
degenerating, slowly and perhaps unconsciously,
into the position we have just mentioned, ll is true
that the Council cannot allow itself to become a
bedlam of conflicting anarchies, though that might
be a nearly-ideal state for the self-expression of
all the world's varied modern currents. But on the
other hand, the Council cannot allow itself to be
come a grim, forboding and forbidden idol. In
either case it will lose the human force which is
necessary for its continuance.
And human force can be supplanted only by
atomic force todav.
