# Volcano 'Born' in Southern Mexico; Stanford Geologist Views Spectacle
## 
### BETTIELU SULLIVAN 
Mexico has given geologists a
rare chance to view the birth and
! growth of a volcano, according to
Konrad Krauskopl' of the Geology*
Department, who lias just returned
' to his teaching post at Stanford.
Ever since its first eruption three
years ago, ihe volcano Paricutin has
been the subject of extensive study
by scientists interested in volcanic
; phenomena.
Mr. Krauskopf presented an il
i lustrated lecture last night on the
volcano to the Geological and Min
j ing Society.
Mr. Krauskopf was sent to re
cord the actions of the volcano for
four months by the U.S. Geological
Survey. He lived on a ridge about
a mile from Ihe volcano and studied
the rocks and the day to day activi-
I ties.
The birth of a volcano is a rare
i event in the world's history. The
volcano Jorullo, near Paricutin in
southern Mexico, was born in
1751), remaining active for about
two years. The growth of Monte
Nuovo near the Bay of Naples was
observed in the 16th century, but

its activity ceased within a few
months. Paricutin has already
outlasted both of these and is still
active.
A few other new volcanoes have
appeared in the ocean, like the one
that erupted recently near Japan,
cessible to observation.
Paricutin is located in a moun
tainous region at the edge of the
main central plateau in Mexico. Six
months after the first eruption, the
volcano, which started as a wisp of
smoke in an Indian's cornfield, had
built up 1,000 feet above ash and
lava "bomb" fragments. It is esti
mated that the top of the volcano is
now 1400 feet above the floor of the
valley although successive lava
flows have so deeply buried its base
that the visible cone is only about
800 feet high.
The lava flows, according to Mr.
Krauskopf, issue from fissures
near the base of the cone, and
have an average thickness of
Kbout 15 feet. Each flow is a river
of molten rock. Its surface is cov
ered with dark blocks as the lava
freezes on contact with air. The
longest flow is about five miles
long-
Although in 1944 one of the lava
flows engulfed a little town, it is the
fine dust blown out of the crater
that does the widest damage. The
dust spreads over the countryside
to a depth of 8 or 10 feet making the
land impossible to cultivate. For
miles around, Mr. Krauskopf con
tinued, there is no vegetation, and
the landscape is bleak and barren
except for a few bare trees that are
left.
Since the land is no longer suited
for agriculture, the Indians have
been forced to move away. The
government has done the best it
could to provide new land for them.
But many with typical Indian at
tachment for the land come back
every year to view the site of their
farms.
S A few of the Indians have
stayed and made a good thing of
the tourists that inevitably come
to see such a sight, llorses and
guides are provided so that the
visitors may ride up (o the base
of the volcano, or as close as the
mood of (he somewhat tempera
mental lady permits. The steep
ness of the sides will not allow
complete* ascent, and the gases at
the mouth make it not only dis
agreeable, but dangerous to come
too close.
The Indians in this part of Mex
ico are a primitive people who have
little or no contact with the rest of
the world. Some of them do not
realize that there has been a war,

and knowledge of the fact means
nothing to them in their isolated
section.
Paricutin gives a fine display of
fireworks in its better moods. "At
night it looks like the Fourth of
July," said Mr. Krauskopf. The
lava flowing from the base of the
mountain, although not very con
spicuous in daylight, becomes a
spectacular river of (ire at night.
"It's a pity that Paricutin start
ed during the war," said Mr.
Krauskopf, "because the volcano
did not receive the attention from
scientists which it would have in
peacetime."
He continued that the geologists
now released from wartime jobs
could make more complete records
of the volcano's future activities.
Just what this activity will be is im
possible to predict, but Paricutin so
far shows no sign of quieting down.
