# Redskins' Wild Throws Give Bears 14-2 Victory
## 
### BREWCE ARMS 
Capitalizing on 10 Stanford er
rors, Cal's mediocre baseball team
tallied 14 runs to beat the Stan
lord nine, 14 to 2, yesterday after
noon at the Sunken Diamond. Only
one-half of Cal's runs were earned.
The other seven Bears crossed the
plate through the Redskins' inabil
ity to throw the ball straight.
In the second inning, three Stan
lord errors and two Cal safeties
counted for four runs. lo the
third inning, a wild Stanford
throw brought in two runs and
another was hatted in on a clean
single, bringing Cal's total to
eight.
At this point Coach Harry Wolter
sent "Lefty" Palisoul to the mound,
replacing Dick Flatland. In the
fourth inning both sides went down
but the fifth was another bad
one lor the Farm.
Three hits by Cal, a couple of
bad throws by Stanford, and four
more Hear runs came in. Two
more runs were tallied by the
grey-clad visitors in the sixth in
ning, giving them their final score
of I I runs.
The Redskins finally hit pay dirt
in the seventh inning. Lloyd Mer
riman started it oil with a single.
McGraw walked and then Prato got
an infield hit. This loaded the bases
lor the locals, with no outs. Ros
hurg, the next man up, struck out,
and Winterhalter followed with a
pop up to second base.
For a moment it looked as if
the Stanford nine would be unable
to make good their only break in
the game.
Ahlquist came in as a pinch-hit
ter; with the count 1 and 0 on Ahl
quist, the Cal catcher threw the ball
to second base hoping to nab Mc-
Graw off the base. The ball went
over the second baseman's head, and

Merriman scored from third. The
second baseman recovered the ball
and threw it over the catcher's head,
and McGraw scored standing up.
These two errors gave Stanford
their only two runs of the game.
In the remaining two innings of
the game both sides went down in
order 1-2-3.
