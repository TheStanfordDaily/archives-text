# The 						Umpire's Verdict
## 
### JOHN SABIN 
Tho hard - driving Los Angeles
Angels moved one game closer to
the pace-making San Francisco club
last week in Pacific Coast League i
play. While the Seals were taking
five games out of seven from the J
luckless Sacramento Solons, Bill j
Sweeney's Seraphs took six out of
seven from the Portland Beavers, J
leaving that club in the cellar, fif- ;
teen games off the pace.
This week sees the Angels tan- j
gling with the Seals in a series
that should be the hottest yet in
the P.C.L. this season. In a pre- J
vious engagement, L.A. took the |
Seals for four out of seven; Los |
Angeles fans arc looking for a
repeat.
Eiill Sweeney's club is long on j
hitting power, currently paced by I
Lloyd Christopher, the league's
loading hitter. As for the Seals, i
who started the season with a j
strong, well-balanced club, Lefty
O'Doul's club is having trouble with
its batting and at third base, where ;
the loss of Puiy Perry has left the j
Seals with fair hitting but inex- j
cusable fielding,
The Portland Beavers have
been dropping farther and far
ther behind the pace. Currently
they are lower in the standings
than they have been for four
years. Last year's champions are
having a lot of trouble with their
hitting and have been losing a
record number of games by one
run. It is this writer's opinion
that, despite the abuse being

showered on Marv Owens' Bea
vers by some of the Daily "ex
perts." they will be back in the
first division by the end of the
season (don't ask which season).

The controversy over whether or i
not the Pacific Coast can support a j
major league is still waxing hot.
Frank Mankiewicz of the Daily
Bruin takes it up by pointing out
that only three clubs on the coast
have parks big enough to support
major league teams—San Francisco, |
Seattle, and Los Angeles.
He has a strong argument here,
but we think he is missing the
main point: small parks can be
replaced or renovated, but what
is really needed is baseball fans i
to fill them. In normal years, {
Portland. Seattle. San Diego, and
Sacramento simply do not have
enough people and money to sup- i
port major leaguers.
It is ridiculous to think of Di-
Maggios and Greenbergs playing in I
Sacramento, a town of some 110,000 ;
people, which in ordinary years can
barely support Coast League base
ball.

The controversy over whether or i
not the Pacific Coast can support a j
major league is still waxing hot.
Frank Mankiewicz of the Daily
Bruin takes it up by pointing out
that only three clubs on the coast
have parks big enough to support
major league teams—San Francisco, |
Seattle, and Los Angeles.
He has a strong argument here,
but we think he is missing the
main point: small parks can be
replaced or renovated, but what
is really needed is baseball fans i
to fill them. In normal years, {
Portland. Seattle. San Diego, and
Sacramento simply do not have
enough people and money to sup- i
port major leaguers.
It is ridiculous to think of Di-
Maggios and Greenbergs playing in I
Sacramento, a town of some 110,000 ;
people, which in ordinary years can
barely support Coast League base
ball.

Three former Pacific Coast men
are pacing the first-place Boston I
Red Sox in the American League:
Ted Williams and Bobby Doeir,
formerly with the San Diego Pa
dres, and Johnny Pesky, who played
h.s. and legion ball in Portland.
Pesky and Williams have been lead
ing the league in hitting and Doerr
has been setting the pace in runs
batted in.
Tho hard - driving Los Angeles
Angels moved one game closer to
the pace-making San Francisco club
last week in Pacific Coast League i
play. While the Seals were taking
five games out of seven from the J
luckless Sacramento Solons, Bill j
Sweeney's Seraphs took six out of
seven from the Portland Beavers, J
leaving that club in the cellar, fif- ;
teen games off the pace.
This week sees the Angels tan- j
gling with the Seals in a series
that should be the hottest yet in
the P.C.L. this season. In a pre- J
vious engagement, L.A. took the |
Seals for four out of seven; Los |
Angeles fans arc looking for a
repeat.
Eiill Sweeney's club is long on j
hitting power, currently paced by I
Lloyd Christopher, the league's
loading hitter. As for the Seals, i
who started the season with a j
strong, well-balanced club, Lefty
O'Doul's club is having trouble with
its batting and at third base, where ;
the loss of Puiy Perry has left the j
Seals with fair hitting but inex- j
cusable fielding,
The Portland Beavers have
been dropping farther and far
ther behind the pace. Currently
they are lower in the standings
than they have been for four
years. Last year's champions are
having a lot of trouble with their
hitting and have been losing a
record number of games by one
run. It is this writer's opinion
that, despite the abuse being

showered on Marv Owens' Bea
