## 
### 
Patty Berg, champion woman
golfer, will demonstrate shots and
swings on the hockey field and
practice green beside the Women's
Gym next Wednesday afternoon
from 1:30 to 3.
While Miss Berg was a lieutenant
in the Marine Corps, she was in an
automobile accident that threatened
to leave her physically handicapped.
Doctors avoided telling her that she
would probably never play golf
again. She was determined to re
cover, and a few months later sports
pages carried the announcement
that the red - headed champion
would be back again to win.
Not in the history of golf has any
woman come close to equaling Miss
Berg's triumphs. Her long list of
winnings includes tournaments of
national importance which attracted
all or most of America's best links
women.
