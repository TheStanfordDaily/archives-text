### ART LEVINSON 
One of the first questions this writer will a:sk Professor Shpetner in
English 89Z, "How to Understand English in Ten Easy Lessons or Five
Hard Ones," will be how to translate "Art, mah lien, what fo da mattah
wit you."
After reading the sentence from left to right, right to left, upside
down, and at a 30-degree angle, we're stil unable to figure out what
Shpcl is trying to put over. He said something about Sanskrit later in
his column. Maybe that's the clue for translating Shpetner's little opus.

STRICTLY PERTINENT DATA: Mr. Bugge announces that all firfct
round playings in the intramural tennis tournament should be played
off by Saturday. Next week the tennis mentor wants all matches to be
concluded, so everybody will have plenty of time to study for finals and
get A's on all the exams.

The sports department is in the depths of a heated discussion on
the merits—or demerits—of the Portland baseball club. John Sahin, our
professional baseball scribe, who hails from the northern lumbcrjacking
community, maintains that the Beavers are still a lirst-division club,
but are merely in the midst of a "mild" slump.
This writer, along with Assistant Sports Editor Allen Sciaroni, claims
that Portland will wind up in fifth place at best. Our conclusions are based
on the present performance of the club. Whaddya think about the situ
ation?
Bennie Rciges, who was counted on to he the starting quarterback
at U.C.L.A. next fall, broke his collarbone during a scrimmage, and his
status for the following season is unknown. Rciges, with two years of
previous experience at Georgetown, has been tutored for the quarter
back post by Bob Waterfield, star for the Cleveland Rams.
Ernie Case is now the leading candidate for the position. Other top
flight backfield men at the Westwood institution are Ernie Johnson, flashy
halfback from the '45 St. Mary's Pre-Fight team, and Jim Riddle of Van
Nuys.
The Boston Red Sox battery combo has been brushing through
American League pitching with as much ease as swatting bees in a
beehive. Leading the Bosox attack is Ted Williams, an alumnus of the
Padres of the Coast League. Other former Coast Leaguers with the
Massachusetts club are Dom DiMaggio, Johnnie Pesky, Eddie Pella
grini, and Bobby Doerr. The title of Murderers' Row, that once applied
so aptly to the Yankees, now befits the Red Sox.
