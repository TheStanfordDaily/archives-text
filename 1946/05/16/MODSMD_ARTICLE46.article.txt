NEW YORK. May 15 (UP). —Melvin Leroy Harder, Cleveland's 35-
year-old right-hander from Chagrin Falls, ().. helped the Indians to a
double shutout victory over the Philadelphia Athletics today and at the

same time put the lie to critics who
said he was ''washed up."
Harder, one of three active major
league pitchers who have won more
than 200 games during their careers,
chalked up his 213 th win with a six
hit, 3 to 0 victory in the opener
after which youngster Steve Grome !
turned in a four-hit, 5 to 0 blank
ing of the A's.
It was the first start for Harder,
who is now in his l'Jth season
with the Indians. He was seldom
in trouble, walking only two bat
ters and keeping the hits well
spaced. Singles by Manager Lou
Boudreau, Ken Kcltner, and Fra
nie Hayes, which followed Gene
Woodling's walk and Mickey
Kocco's sacrifice, gave the Indians
two runs in the fourth and that
was all the margin Harder needed.
Hank Edwards gave Bromek most
of his hitting help in the second
game with a two-run homer and
two singles, pacing the 12-hit at
tack on Bobo Newsom and Bob
Savage.
Johnny Rigney kept the Boston
Red Sox on famine hit rations by
beating them, 3 to 2, at Chicago
with a three-hit job. Ted Wil
liams got to him for a second in
ning homer after which he held
the slugging Bostonians at bay
until the ninth when Edgar Smith
came on to quell a rally. Don
DiMaggio walked and Ilal Wag
ner singled him to third after
which Rigney retired and Smith
put out the fire, although Ernie
Andres scored DiMaggio with a
long fly.
The Red Sox, who were smash
ing the covers off balls at home,
now have been held to a total of
12 hits in their last four games, an
average of three per game. Mur
rell Jones, Chicago rookie, hit a
two-run homer in the fourth and
Rigney himself drove in the third
run in the seventh with a perfect
squeeze bunt off Tex liughson, who
lost his third game.
Washington took a liking to the
slants of rookie pitcher Ted Gray
at Detroit, getting four runs in
the first two innings and breezing
to a 12-hit. (I to 3 victory. Gray,
making his first major league
start after his recent Navy re
lease, was blasted for a three-run
homer by Stan Spence in the first
inning.

NEW YORK. May 15 (UP). —Melvin Leroy Harder, Cleveland's 35-
year-old right-hander from Chagrin Falls, ().. helped the Indians to a
double shutout victory over the Philadelphia Athletics today and at the

same time put the lie to critics who
said he was ''washed up."
Harder, one of three active major
league pitchers who have won more
than 200 games during their careers,
chalked up his 213 th win with a six
hit, 3 to 0 victory in the opener
after which youngster Steve Grome !
turned in a four-hit, 5 to 0 blank
ing of the A's.
It was the first start for Harder,
who is now in his l'Jth season
with the Indians. He was seldom
in trouble, walking only two bat
ters and keeping the hits well
spaced. Singles by Manager Lou
Boudreau, Ken Kcltner, and Fra
nie Hayes, which followed Gene
Woodling's walk and Mickey
Kocco's sacrifice, gave the Indians
two runs in the fourth and that
was all the margin Harder needed.
Hank Edwards gave Bromek most
of his hitting help in the second
game with a two-run homer and
two singles, pacing the 12-hit at
tack on Bobo Newsom and Bob
Savage.
Johnny Rigney kept the Boston
Red Sox on famine hit rations by
beating them, 3 to 2, at Chicago
with a three-hit job. Ted Wil
liams got to him for a second in
ning homer after which he held
the slugging Bostonians at bay
until the ninth when Edgar Smith
came on to quell a rally. Don
DiMaggio walked and Ilal Wag
ner singled him to third after
which Rigney retired and Smith
put out the fire, although Ernie
Andres scored DiMaggio with a
long fly.
The Red Sox, who were smash
ing the covers off balls at home,
now have been held to a total of
12 hits in their last four games, an
average of three per game. Mur
rell Jones, Chicago rookie, hit a
two-run homer in the fourth and
Rigney himself drove in the third
run in the seventh with a perfect
squeeze bunt off Tex liughson, who
lost his third game.
Washington took a liking to the
slants of rookie pitcher Ted Gray
at Detroit, getting four runs in
the first two innings and breezing
to a 12-hit. (I to 3 victory. Gray,
making his first major league
start after his recent Navy re
lease, was blasted for a three-run
homer by Stan Spence in the first
inning.
