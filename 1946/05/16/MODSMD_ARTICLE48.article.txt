# Visit the Stanfords--1876
## 
### BOB PECK 
Another page in Stanford's history was turned back 70 years this
quarter when the Red Barn, dating from the original Leland Stanford
farm in 187(1, was reopened to the students.
Imagine you were alive 70 years ago: Leland Stanford lias invited you
down to visit his new stock farm in as yet undeveloped Palo Alto. Prom
San Francisco, you took the Southern Pacific train to the Palo Alto station.
The ride was hot and long. The car seats were red plush and dusty. Your
hlack wing tie, which you had to wear to see the senator, has choked your
throat. Underneath your collar, sweat and dust have accumulated.
STANFORD GREETS YOU
As you get ofT the train, Leland Stanford, with an impressive beard,
greeted you and took you to a waiting carriage. Mrs. Stanford, in all her
fine clothes, was very gracious and thanked you for having honored them
with a visit. You hurriedly assured her that it was only your pleasure.
The surrounding countryside was beautiful that day. The Stanfords
line horses cut oil the King's Highway at Menlo Park and drove you
over a rough, dusty road up toward the foothills. The oak trees impressed
you with their magnificcncc and you supposed that they would be stand
ing 100 years from that day.
THE STOCK FARM
Stanford began to talk about the horses he was planning to bring to
his stock farm. He had big plans for making it the finest stock farm in
the country. He talked endlessly about the building of the barns. Con
struction work was being done now on the trotting rings.
After a few minutes' ride, the carriage stopped, and the porter came
around to help you out. You noticed that his clothes, in spite ol being
very dusty, were neat and well pressed. You looked at Jane Lathrop
Stanford and realized that all her servants would be correctly dressed
under any circumstances.

AND TROTTING KINGS
Senator Stanford took great pride
in showing you his new barns and
the trotting rings that were being
built. You went inside one large
barn and the heat almost stifled
you. The two-story structure ra
diated heat. But Stanford, in his
heavy black suit, showed you every
room of the large structure. In the
barn, the senator had put all of the
latest improvements. Only three of
his prize trotters had been moved
to the barn yet, but he was plan
ning to ship several more down
shortly. You wondered how much
the barn cost but didn't dare ask.
You realized how seriously he took
the training of the horses and how
proud he was of the stock farm be
ing built.
Once again back in the carriage,
you exchange polite conversation
with the Stanfords while driving to
his other barn in Mayfield. The sun
has begun to go down and the ride
is now comfortably cool. Up be
yond the foothills the fog is engulf
ing the mountains. The brown fields
look hot and you wonder if the ter
ritory will ever be developed. Prob
ably not, you think, because of its
great distance from San Francisco.
LITTLE LELAND'S HORSE
The road between the first barn
you visited and Mayfield is even

worse than the other dirt road had
j been. Leland, Jr., tells you about
his horseâ€”the one that he himself
I owns. The senator adds his com
! ments to the conversation between
I you and the boy, and you realize
! that the senator takes more than a
fatherly pride in his son. It is easy
| to observe that Mrs. Stanford wor
ries about how frail the boy looks
but you think that eventually he
[ will develop into a husky youngster.
When you reach Mayfield, the
I senator again shows you around the
j part of the stock farm developing
' there. Here, he plans to put his
J prize racers. Your visit here is cut
short by the fact that evening is ap
, proaching. The fog has come in and

the night is going to be cold. Then,
with an order to his porter, the
senator starts the carriage back to
San Francisco and you realize that
you are being spared another ride
on the Southern Pacific.
END OF THE DAY
That night, tired and weary, but
pleased that you visited the Stan
ford stock farm, you bathe your feet
in hot water at your Post street
home. You take time to take your
clothes out to be cleaned, and then
you read your Daily Bulletin. As
you drift off to sleep, you wonder
whether you should vote for Tilden
and Hayes in the coming election.
You decide it isn't worth worrying
about and the day is finished.


HOUSES NOW GRAZE PEACEFULLY in fields where Senator
Stanford's racing and trotting ponies once trained for their record
breaking careers.


STANFORD'S FAMED RED liARN. recently reopened for student
use. li was once the home of many great names in the horse world when
the Stanford Farm was a center for what were then radical horse-train
ing methods.
