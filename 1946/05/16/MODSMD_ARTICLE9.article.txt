# Bakery Officials Say West Coast Public 'Running' Stocks, Hoarding Bread
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 15 (UP).—The American public, running true to form, is making the
bread and wheat products shortage worse on the Pacific Coast by buying up and hoarding criti
cal foodstuffs.
Food and bakery spokesmen in major West Coast cities today were outspoken in their convic
tions that "runs" on groceries and bakeries were rapidly making a "very critical" situation worse

and already evidences of black
market operations were springing
up.
The American housewife, always
alert to rush out pnd store up a
pantry-full of scarce foodstuffs. has
not been idle since the government
cut down domestic wheat supplies
and reduced the white flour content
on bread April 1.

A large proportion of the Stan
ford student body have signed the
scroll on the Cellar corner which
pledged a 40 per cent cut in wheat
consumption and a 20 per cent
reduction in use of fats. Many
other students, though not sign
ing, arc complying to the spirit of
the pledge through their living
group programs.
Another proviso reads: "We
pledge to ''obey this pledge wher
ever we eat." Students are there
fore pledged to cut down on rolls
at the Cellar, hamburgers in mid
aftcrnoon at the drive-in, and
other unnecessary or purely ha
bitual consumption of wheat
foods.
At the end of one week, the
Cellar and Union dining halls
have announced that the note on
their menu: "Bread served only
on request'' had effected a 50 per
cent cut in wheat consumption in
those campus restaurants.
Further information concerning
the food drive may he found on

signs in stores and the general pre
diction of millers from San Diego,
Cal., to Spokane, Wash., that they
would run out of grain wilhin 30
days unless some miracle or change
of government policy saves them,
has changed an early run into a
rush.
Wholesale grocers and bakers in
Los Angeles, San Francisco, Port
land, Ore., Sacramento, Cal., Seattle
and Spokane all told the same story.
Shortages not only extend to
bread and flour, they said, but fan
out to include almost every conceiv
able item made from grain. Shelves
are being stripped of cake flours,
breakfast foods, corn tncal, crack
ers, packaged toast and all other
products which could be used as
substitutes for bread.

SAN FRANCISCO, May 15 (UP).—The American public, running true to form, is making the
bread and wheat products shortage worse on the Pacific Coast by buying up and hoarding criti
cal foodstuffs.
Food and bakery spokesmen in major West Coast cities today were outspoken in their convic
tions that "runs" on groceries and bakeries were rapidly making a "very critical" situation worse

and already evidences of black
market operations were springing
up.
The American housewife, always
alert to rush out pnd store up a
pantry-full of scarce foodstuffs. has
not been idle since the government
cut down domestic wheat supplies
and reduced the white flour content
on bread April 1.

A large proportion of the Stan
ford student body have signed the
scroll on the Cellar corner which
pledged a 40 per cent cut in wheat
consumption and a 20 per cent
reduction in use of fats. Many
other students, though not sign
ing, arc complying to the spirit of
the pledge through their living
group programs.
Another proviso reads: "We
pledge to ''obey this pledge wher
ever we eat." Students are there
fore pledged to cut down on rolls
at the Cellar, hamburgers in mid
aftcrnoon at the drive-in, and
other unnecessary or purely ha
bitual consumption of wheat
foods.
At the end of one week, the
Cellar and Union dining halls
have announced that the note on
their menu: "Bread served only
on request'' had effected a 50 per
cent cut in wheat consumption in
those campus restaurants.
