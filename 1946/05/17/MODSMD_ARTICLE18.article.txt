# Diffenbaugh, Cal Phi Psi's Questioned in Axe Robbery; University Officials Investigating
## 
### 
The Stanford Axe theft case broke
wide open last night amid police
investigations, threats, and accusa
tions.
Lt. Waldman of the California
campus police department official
ly questioned Bill DifTenbaugh, Cal
football player Wednesday night.
DifTenbaugh, a Phi Psi, denied being
involved in the theft, or having any
knowledge of it. In a previous tele
phone conversation with the Daily
sports editor he stated, "I may
know who stole the Axe, but I
didn't do it."
DIFEENRAUGII DENIES
DifTenbaugh told the police that
he had been at a dinner party the
of the Axe theft. He added
that earlier in the evening he was
in the company of the mayor of
Richmond and a city councilman.
Before Diffenbaugh disclosed this
information to the police, he told
Art Levinson, sports editor, that
he "didn't remember what night the
Axe was stolen, and didn't remem
ber what he did that evening."
WITH KENITELD
Later in the same conversation lie

stated that "Ted Kenfield and I
were together the night it was
stolen."
DifTenbaugh wa; suspected after
an article appealed in the Berkeley
Gazette by Jim Scott, sports editor,
stating that one of the men involved
in (he Axe theft was a transfer ath
lete from a nearby college. Subse
quent revelations in a conversation
with Scott brought out the fact that
the transfer athlete was a football
player from Santa Clara.
PHI PSI'S SUSPECTED
Since the Phi Psi's had been un
der suspicion by the police for some
time, and Phi Psi DifTenbaugh was
a transfer athlete from Santa Clara,
evidence pointed towards him, as
Scott, who had personally met all
six thieves, had stated that all were
members of the same fraternity.
Furthermore, Sweeney, a Phi Psi,
was seen on the Stanford campus
at D:45 p.m., shortly before the rob
bery, according to Gordon Davis,
Stanford police chief.
TOO HOT TO HANDLE
One night after the theft, the six
involved attempted to turn over the

Axe to (lie sports editor of the j
Berkeley Gazette, Scott, hut the
latter refused to involve himself, :
lie related in an article in the news- i
paper.
Ted Kcnfield, also a Phi Psi, and
involved in the previous theft of
the Axe supposedly received a
threatening letter last Sunday night.
The letter, according to Lt. Wald
man, was entirely typewritten and
was handed by a mysterious per- i
son or persons over a hedge to Wen- i
dell Beard, who delivered the mis
sive to Kenfield.
WITHHELD LETTKU
The letter was not disclosed, how
ever. by Kenfield to the police, but
by Diffenbaugh after he hud been |
grilled by the police chief concern
ing the Axe theft on Wednesday
night.
Kenfield denied any knowledge of
this Axe theft, to the police, saying
that he, on the night of the robbery,
was on a "date."
The investigation is still in prog- j
ress by administration and police
officials of both universities. Gordy
Davis stated that the guilty persons I
may face expulsion from school. 1

The Stanford Axe theft case broke
wide open last night amid police
investigations, threats, and accusa
tions.
Lt. Waldman of the California
campus police department official
ly questioned Bill DifTenbaugh, Cal
football player Wednesday night.
DifTenbaugh, a Phi Psi, denied being
involved in the theft, or having any
knowledge of it. In a previous tele
phone conversation with the Daily
sports editor he stated, "I may
know who stole the Axe, but I
didn't do it."
DIFEENRAUGII DENIES
DifTenbaugh told the police that
he had been at a dinner party the
of the Axe theft. He added
that earlier in the evening he was
in the company of the mayor of
Richmond and a city councilman.
Before Diffenbaugh disclosed this
information to the police, he told
Art Levinson, sports editor, that
he "didn't remember what night the
Axe was stolen, and didn't remem
ber what he did that evening."
WITH KENITELD
Later in the same conversation lie

stated that "Ted Kenfield and I
were together the night it was
stolen."
DifTenbaugh wa; suspected after
an article appealed in the Berkeley
Gazette by Jim Scott, sports editor,
stating that one of the men involved
in (he Axe theft was a transfer ath
lete from a nearby college. Subse
quent revelations in a conversation
with Scott brought out the fact that
the transfer athlete was a football
player from Santa Clara.
PHI PSI'S SUSPECTED
Since the Phi Psi's had been un
der suspicion by the police for some
time, and Phi Psi DifTenbaugh was
a transfer athlete from Santa Clara,
evidence pointed towards him, as
Scott, who had personally met all
six thieves, had stated that all were
members of the same fraternity.
Furthermore, Sweeney, a Phi Psi,
was seen on the Stanford campus
at D:45 p.m., shortly before the rob
bery, according to Gordon Davis,
Stanford police chief.
TOO HOT TO HANDLE
One night after the theft, the six
involved attempted to turn over the

Axe to (lie sports editor of the j
Berkeley Gazette, Scott, hut the
latter refused to involve himself, :
lie related in an article in the news- i
paper.
Ted Kcnfield, also a Phi Psi, and
involved in the previous theft of
the Axe supposedly received a
threatening letter last Sunday night.
The letter, according to Lt. Wald
man, was entirely typewritten and
was handed by a mysterious per- i
son or persons over a hedge to Wen- i
dell Beard, who delivered the mis
sive to Kenfield.
WITHHELD LETTKU
The letter was not disclosed, how
ever. by Kenfield to the police, but
by Diffenbaugh after he hud been |
grilled by the police chief concern
ing the Axe theft on Wednesday
night.
Kenfield denied any knowledge of
this Axe theft, to the police, saying
that he, on the night of the robbery,
was on a "date."
The investigation is still in prog- j
ress by administration and police
officials of both universities. Gordy
Davis stated that the guilty persons I
may face expulsion from school. 1
