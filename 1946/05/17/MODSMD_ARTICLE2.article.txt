WASHINGTON, May 16 (UP).â€”
President Truman reiterated today
that he will seize the railroads if
that drastic action is needed to
avert a nationwide strike scheduled
for 5 p.m. (EDT) Saturday.
But he told his news conference
that he still was hopeful of a set
tlement in the wage-rules dispute
and declined to agree that negotia

failure of a last-minute attempt to
settle the dispute.
Mr. Truman said the government
was still working on the negotia
tions but declined further comment.
Asked if he would take over the
line's "before the strike deadline,''
be replied, certainly.
Even as he spoke, the Oflice of
Defense Transportation and the
Army were gearing themselves to
carry out presidential seizure or
ders.
