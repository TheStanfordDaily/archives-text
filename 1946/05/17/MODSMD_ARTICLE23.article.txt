# Athletics-Intramural or Intercollegiate?
## 
### 
It's common knowledge these days that
r.axt year's athletic budget has been cut, and
the statement has been made that as a result
wrestling, rugby and soccer are temporarily
out as minor sports at Stanford. Taking this
;ilcng3ide the current controversy over en
trance requirements we can fairly say that
? hle' cs as they existed before the war are
being de-emphasi2ed as a part of the Uni
versity program.
There are several schools of thought on
tha question. One says: either we put Stan
ford athlstics back on the map, through with
in-limit proselyting of football players or
we'll be forced to toss them completely out
the window. All this because stadium re
ceipts from football support in large part the
intercollegiate program for the rest of the
year, and students and alumni aren't going
to troop to the bowl at $1.10 or $4.40-a-throw
if the decision is already in the losing bag.
Another group has staunchly stood for
"up-and-up" academic emphasis in entrance
requirements, pleading for a team that will
perhaps lost consistently but at all costs hon
orably. The practical monetary side of this
argument has not been advanced.
Then up comes the middle-of-the-road
theory, that asks consideration of borderline
academic cases in the light of achievement
in athletics, and requires lor its justification
a iong-run philosophy on the good if inter
collegiate athletics to a college community.
Right now we don't have the backlog of
dih.leles which other colleges have as a re
.c",t of wartime intercollegiate competition.
It looks as if all we have is a reputation,
which will fast disappear with a few years
of losing games.
Put to jump immediately into a program of
de-emphasis is too much like cutting off our
nose to spite our downcast face. How can
we possibly approach the top in athletics
when we don't finance athletics; when we
begin right away cutting down the budget
for fear of insufficient returns from the foot
ball gate in fall? How can we possibly hope
to attract the athletes which will put us on
top unless we make a good showing in the
next few years?
Obviously, this means letting in athletes
and we maintain that there are a good
number that can be fairly admitted under a
sound application of the present entrance re
quirements. On the basis of personal recom

mendations, the aptitude test, and high school
athletic and extra-curricular achievement,
students are admitted now to Stanford. The
first will guarantee Stanford against the so
called "tramp athlete." On the last will rely
the future of Farm teams.
Any person who participates wholehearted
ly in athletics or student government whether
in high school or college obviously doer, not
have time to go straight A. But do we judge
him as a less valuable member of a student
body? Isn't he showing interest and loyalty
and a desire tor self-development? Wouldn't
such people make worthy Stanford students
and alumni?
If the guys have grades that can compete
on the curve system and a good high school
record in athletics (or other extra-curricular
activities) why not give them a chance? Let's
admit them experimentally; let's not assume
that brains and brawn just don't mix. (And
what's so desirable in a "straight-A" student
body, anyway?)
The question, which may or may not be
involved, is how intercollcgiate athletics rank
in importance to the University. We've hoard
from certain higher-ups that athletic compe
tition —even intra-mural competition—is the
desired end of any university physical edu
cation department.
But to us, intercollegiate athletics seem to
provide by far the most important factor of
unity within a student body. Too often v/e
as students are divided from each other by
separate interests. There's the "journalism
crowd," the "dramatic crowd," the group of
people who spend their weeks in the chem
department, and the hubba-hubba "activi
ties" group. But when Stanford fields a foot
ball team, or a basketball team, persons from
every one of these groups are out watching,
and audibly sheering for one thing their
university. We think that's important — a
common loyalty. So-called student apathy
would largely disappear, we feel, if every
student felt bound to every other by ties of
a common allegiance.
A losing team, as Vern Hart said yesterday
in a Daily campus opinion, has never re
ceived much support from a Stanford student
body. If new emphasis of our entrance re
quirements is necessary to get a winning
team, what are we waiting for? We believe a
well-balanced and united student body will
be the end result.—BMV

ties" group. But when Stanford fields a foot
ball team, or a basketball team, persons from
every one of these groups are out watching,
and audibly sheering for one thing their
university. We think that's important — a
common loyalty. So-called student apathy
would largely disappear, we feel, if every
student felt bound to every other by ties of
a common allegiance.
A losing team, as Vern Hart said yesterday
in a Daily campus opinion, has never re
ceived much support from a Stanford student
body. If new emphasis of our entrance re
quirements is necessary to get a winning
team, what are we waiting for? We believe a
well-balanced and united student body will
be the end result.—BMV
It's common knowledge these days that
r.axt year's athletic budget has been cut, and
the statement has been made that as a result
wrestling, rugby and soccer are temporarily
out as minor sports at Stanford. Taking this
;ilcng3ide the current controversy over en
trance requirements we can fairly say that
? hle' cs as they existed before the war are
being de-emphasi2ed as a part of the Uni
versity program.
There are several schools of thought on
tha question. One says: either we put Stan
ford athlstics back on the map, through with
in-limit proselyting of football players or
we'll be forced to toss them completely out
the window. All this because stadium re
ceipts from football support in large part the
intercollegiate program for the rest of the
year, and students and alumni aren't going
to troop to the bowl at $1.10 or $4.40-a-throw
if the decision is already in the losing bag.
Another group has staunchly stood for
"up-and-up" academic emphasis in entrance
requirements, pleading for a team that will
perhaps lost consistently but at all costs hon
orably. The practical monetary side of this
argument has not been advanced.
Then up comes the middle-of-the-road
theory, that asks consideration of borderline
academic cases in the light of achievement
in athletics, and requires lor its justification
a iong-run philosophy on the good if inter
collegiate athletics to a college community.
Right now we don't have the backlog of
dih.leles which other colleges have as a re
.c",t of wartime intercollegiate competition.
It looks as if all we have is a reputation,
which will fast disappear with a few years
of losing games.
Put to jump immediately into a program of
de-emphasis is too much like cutting off our
nose to spite our downcast face. How can
we possibly approach the top in athletics
when we don't finance athletics; when we
begin right away cutting down the budget
for fear of insufficient returns from the foot
ball gate in fall? How can we possibly hope
to attract the athletes which will put us on
top unless we make a good showing in the
next few years?
Obviously, this means letting in athletes
and we maintain that there are a good
number that can be fairly admitted under a
sound application of the present entrance re
quirements. On the basis of personal recom

mendations, the aptitude test, and high school
athletic and extra-curricular achievement,
students are admitted now to Stanford. The
first will guarantee Stanford against the so
called "tramp athlete." On the last will rely
the future of Farm teams.
Any person who participates wholehearted
ly in athletics or student government whether
in high school or college obviously doer, not
have time to go straight A. But do we judge
him as a less valuable member of a student
body? Isn't he showing interest and loyalty
and a desire tor self-development? Wouldn't
such people make worthy Stanford students
and alumni?
If the guys have grades that can compete
on the curve system and a good high school
record in athletics (or other extra-curricular
activities) why not give them a chance? Let's
admit them experimentally; let's not assume
that brains and brawn just don't mix. (And
what's so desirable in a "straight-A" student
body, anyway?)
The question, which may or may not be
involved, is how intercollcgiate athletics rank
in importance to the University. We've hoard
from certain higher-ups that athletic compe
tition —even intra-mural competition—is the
desired end of any university physical edu
cation department.
But to us, intercollegiate athletics seem to
provide by far the most important factor of
unity within a student body. Too often v/e
as students are divided from each other by
separate interests. There's the "journalism
crowd," the "dramatic crowd," the group of
people who spend their weeks in the chem
department, and the hubba-hubba "activi
ties" group. But when Stanford fields a foot

what's so desirable in a "straight-A" student
body, anyway?)
The question, which may or may not be
involved, is how intercollcgiate athletics rank
in importance to the University. We've hoard
from certain higher-ups that athletic compe
tition —even intra-mural competition—is the
desired end of any university physical edu
cation department.
But to us, intercollegiate athletics seem to
provide by far the most important factor of
unity within a student body. Too often v/e
as students are divided from each other by
separate interests. There's the "journalism
crowd," the "dramatic crowd," the group of
people who spend their weeks in the chem
department, and the hubba-hubba "activi
ties" group. But when Stanford fields a foot
ball team, or a basketball team, persons from
every one of these groups are out watching,
and audibly sheering for one thing their
university. We think that's important — a
common loyalty. So-called student apathy
would largely disappear, we feel, if every
student felt bound to every other by ties of
a common allegiance.
A losing team, as Vern Hart said yesterday
in a Daily campus opinion, has never re
ceived much support from a Stanford student
body. If new emphasis of our entrance re
quirements is necessary to get a winning
team, what are we waiting for? We believe a
well-balanced and united student body will
be the end result.—BMV
It's common knowledge these days that
r.axt year's athletic budget has been cut, and
the statement has been made that as a result
wrestling, rugby and soccer are temporarily
out as minor sports at Stanford. Taking this
;ilcng3ide the current controversy over en
trance requirements we can fairly say that
? hle' cs as they existed before the war are
being de-emphasi2ed as a part of the Uni
versity program.
There are several schools of thought on
tha question. One says: either we put Stan
ford athlstics back on the map, through with
in-limit proselyting of football players or
we'll be forced to toss them completely out
the window. All this because stadium re
ceipts from football support in large part the
intercollegiate program for the rest of the
year, and students and alumni aren't going
to troop to the bowl at $1.10 or $4.40-a-throw
if the decision is already in the losing bag.
Another group has staunchly stood for
"up-and-up" academic emphasis in entrance
requirements, pleading for a team that will
perhaps lost consistently but at all costs hon
orably. The practical monetary side of this
argument has not been advanced.
Then up comes the middle-of-the-road
theory, that asks consideration of borderline
academic cases in the light of achievement
in athletics, and requires lor its justification
a iong-run philosophy on the good if inter
collegiate athletics to a college community.
Right now we don't have the backlog of
dih.leles which other colleges have as a re
.c",t of wartime intercollegiate competition.
It looks as if all we have is a reputation,
which will fast disappear with a few years
of losing games.
Put to jump immediately into a program of
de-emphasis is too much like cutting off our
nose to spite our downcast face. How can
we possibly approach the top in athletics
when we don't finance athletics; when we
begin right away cutting down the budget
for fear of insufficient returns from the foot
ball gate in fall? How can we possibly hope
to attract the athletes which will put us on
top unless we make a good showing in the
next few years?
Obviously, this means letting in athletes
and we maintain that there are a good
number that can be fairly admitted under a
sound application of the present entrance re
quirements. On the basis of personal recom

mendations, the aptitude test, and high school
athletic and extra-curricular achievement,
students are admitted now to Stanford. The
first will guarantee Stanford against the so
called "tramp athlete." On the last will rely
the future of Farm teams.
Any person who participates wholehearted
ly in athletics or student government whether
in high school or college obviously doer, not
have time to go straight A. But do we judge
him as a less valuable member of a student
body? Isn't he showing interest and loyalty
and a desire tor self-development? Wouldn't
such people make worthy Stanford students
and alumni?
If the guys have grades that can compete
on the curve system and a good high school
record in athletics (or other extra-curricular
activities) why not give them a chance? Let's
admit them experimentally; let's not assume
that brains and brawn just don't mix. (And
what's so desirable in a "straight-A" student
body, anyway?)
