FOR A BETTER STANFORD?
Dear Editor:
Teachers, books, and campus—this trinity is the
1 of any good school. A fortunate school will
have enough money to buy all three, and, having
the money, with plenty of good teachers available
t ) the student, plenty of reference materials avail
; Me to the student, and a collection of buildings
sufficient to house its students and itself, would
attract plenty of sincere undergraduates and grad
uates, in good times and bad and it would turn out.
a -iiperior product.
In these days of teacher shortages, book short
nges and construction difficulties, my ideal uni
versity would, of course, be hard pressed to meet
Ils needs and obligations. It would have to con
tent itself with failing short of meeting them by
r.s small a margin as possible.
How does Stanford measure up against this pat
tern of the ideal university? What is it doing to
attract and hold good teachers? Does it buy the
leference books in which the students are assigned
reading, when these books are available? Is its
plant adequate?
In the third quarter of my second tour of duty
at Stanford, it seems to me that these three needs
are not being met.
In the fields of my majur and minor interests,
tl.:* teachers are, in general, few and overworked.
During the school year, one has left for greener

pastures. Another was dropped after the first
quarter of a two-quarter course. leaving the stu
dents high and dry. Two are visiting from other
schools and will be gone by fall quarter. Another
is too busy with important outside works to teach
more than an occasional course. And more and
more.
In almost all of the courses except Western Civ,
last iall quarter, 1 have run into a real bottleneck
at the Main Library reference room. In one course,
a class of 40-50 students, several assignments have
been made in reference books of which the library
owns but one copy. Most of these books are out of
print, I know, but one is available. The students
are buying il. through the bookstore at $5 a copy.
Why does the library riot do the same? This class
paid about $6 500 in tuition and fees this quarter.
Our physical plant comes closest to the ideal,
and is beautiful, Frank Lloyd Wright notwith
standing. I speak of it last, however, because of
the three elements 112 listed, it seems lo ine least
important. Even here, 1 feel less has been done
to meet pressing needs than could have been
done.
If the tuition is insufficient to meet our basic
needs. let it be raised, and let that raise be ac
companied by a published academic salary scale
(such as San Mateo Junior College, and others),
and also by a library policy which at least makes
an attempt to meet its requirements.

schools and will be gone by fall quarter. Another
is too busy with important outside works to teach
more than an occasional course. And more and
more.
In almost all of the courses except Western Civ,
last iall quarter, 1 have run into a real bottleneck
at the Main Library reference room. In one course,
a class of 40-50 students, several assignments have
been made in reference books of which the library
owns but one copy. Most of these books are out of
print, I know, but one is available. The students
are buying il. through the bookstore at $5 a copy.
Why does the library riot do the same? This class
paid about $6 500 in tuition and fees this quarter.
Our physical plant comes closest to the ideal,
and is beautiful, Frank Lloyd Wright notwith
standing. I speak of it last, however, because of
the three elements 112 listed, it seems lo ine least
important. Even here, 1 feel less has been done
to meet pressing needs than could have been
done.
If the tuition is insufficient to meet our basic
needs. let it be raised, and let that raise be ac
companied by a published academic salary scale
(such as San Mateo Junior College, and others),
and also by a library policy which at least makes
an attempt to meet its requirements.

How does Stanford measure up against this pat
tern of the ideal university? What is it doing to
attract and hold good teachers? Does it buy the
leference books in which the students are assigned
reading, when these books are available? Is its
