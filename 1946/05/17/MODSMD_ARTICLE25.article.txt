Being that, today I am sick on account of getting
in one arm a smallpox whosy and in the other a
< holera shot my associate Smiley Farkas of the
San Francisco Chronicle (San Francisco's only
home-owned newspaper) and The Stanford Daily
(the Peninsula's Only Morning Newspaper) is sit
iing next to me—with his shoes off—and promises
to give forth.
So, my boy, what gives?
Says Mr. Farkas in opening, "My feet hurl, and
also there is no cooperation between the BAG and
the Administration "
No, Smiley, they've heard enough of that. Some
■ uy wrote ina a letter saying that I had the writ
ing competence of an eight-year-old. He spelled
"competence" and "material" incorrectly by the
way.

We just put in a phono call to Stanley L. Sharp
of the men's housing Sharps. Some of our boys
wanted to know why—if they were going to be
here summer quarter—they couldn't move stuff
into their summer quarters before going home.
They could see no sense in storing their clothes for
one week. However Stanley L. has come through
in fine stvle.

The men can't move to Branner, lie explained to
us, because the girls will not yet have moved out.
Even though you might like that. And the Navy's
contract at Toyon runs a bit. past the end of the
quarter.
How-evah -"I hope to be able to allow the men
to keep their belongings in their present rdoms in
the fraternity houses and then move them when
they come back for' the start of the summer ses
sion. This will depend on the o.k. of the fraternity
groups."
Thank you, Stanley Sharp. A small but annoy
ing annoyance has been conquered.

According to the Palo Alto Times story on the
missing Axe alleged suspect William Diffenbaugh
said there were 10 persons who could confirm they
had dinner with him in Richmond thai night."
Says Smiley Farkas, taking off his socks, "Im
possible. How could you get ten people to go to
Richmond?"

Smiley now has his shoes baek on and is ready
to again enter the discussion. "Just what are we
looking for?" he wants to know.
A way out, me boy. An end.
