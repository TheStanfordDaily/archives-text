TOKYO, May 1G (UP). â€” Sixty
seven - year - old Shigeru Yoshida,
who has spent most of his lifetime
j in Japan's diplomatic service, to
day was appointed Premier by Em
peror Hirohito and approved by
Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur. He im
mediately undertook the task of
forming a cabinet.
A spokesman for Yoshida said he
expected to complete formation of
his government by Friday.
The spokesman said former Pre
mier Baron Kijuro Shidehara might
be included in the new cabinet, but
did not indicate in what post. Shi
dehara, whose government resigned
April 22, made a personal appeal to
i the Emperor for Yoshida's appoint
j ment earlier in the day.
Yoshida, a moderate who served
as Foreign Minister in the Shide
hara cabinet, was approved by Gen.
' Mac Arthur in a letter to the Japa
nese government.
In a brief statement after his ap- |
i pointment, the Premier said:
"Owing to the critical food situa- I
< tion, the Emperor has ordered me j
l to organize a cabinet as soon as '
possible. 1 want to organize a na- !
tional cabinet quickly in order to
meet the people's needs."
The appointment came as Japan's j
newly elected House of Represen- !
tatives convened for the first time. 1
Bukichi Miki, Liberal party mem- |
j her, was elected speaker of the
House by a vote of 228 to 217 after
I a determined attempt by Commu
nists and Social Democrats to have
j a member of a minority group
elected.
The now cabinet, political observ
ers believed, will be a coalition of
conservative parties.
