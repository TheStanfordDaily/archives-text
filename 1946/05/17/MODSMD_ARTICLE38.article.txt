# Cardinal Nine Gunning To Square U.S.F. Series
## 
### 
With only two conference tilts
left this season, the Stanford base
ball nine plays a non-conference
tilt tomorrow afternoon against
the U.S.F. Dons. Victorious in their
initial fracas with the locals, the
San Francisco U. horsehiders ;ire
expected to trounce the Farm once
more.
Plagued by a jittery inlield
that h;is been unable to settle
down all season, Coach Harry
Woller only hopes for the best,
and plans to send in the same
combination that lie has been us
ing all season. The veteran nun
tor lu.(I hoped that the squad
would smooth into a line-work
ing unit this year, but his expec

tations have been knocked over
the bridge in most games.
Pliil Wolf, who started against
U.S.C. last Saturday, will take to
the mound for the locals. Bothered
by a sore arm, he still pitched a
notable game, only to be lÂ»t down
in other baseball departments.
Ed Dempsey, a U.S.F.-er, will
hurl for the opposition. With the
best collegiate record of any
pitcher in the Bay Area, he has
attracted the attention of a num
ber of pro baseball scouts, and
strictly from the rumor feedbox,
he has been tendered several con
tracts.
