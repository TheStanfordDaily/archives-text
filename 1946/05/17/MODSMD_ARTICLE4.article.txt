### 
WASHINGTON, May 1(5 (IIP). "President Truman's appeal for arbi
tration in the soft coal dispute was rejected by the mine union and opera
tors tonight, and Labor Secretary Lewis B. Schwellenbach said all legal
measures short of government seizure now had been exhausted.
Schwellenbach, who sat in on the union-management confercnce with

* President Truman, said glumly that
he saw no settlement formula open
to 1 lie government except to take
i over mines if the strike remains un
settled when the present two-week
truce ends on May 25.
"But wo have not yet reached the
point of deciding on seizure," he
told reporters.
Newsmen pointed out that the
Administration has said it will not
permit the mines to be closed down
again when the truce expires.
"Well," said Schwellenbach with
a wan smile, "that is a week away."
Schwellenbach said both sides
| showed "a desire" 1o reopen the
negotiations—which they told Mr.
Truman only a few hours earlier
were "useless" — but he admitted
that was a highly intangible im
provement in the situation.
Chief stumbling block in the un
ion-management dispute was Lewis'
demand for a $70,000,000 -a - year
welfare fund to be financed by the
coal industry and administered by
the UMW.
