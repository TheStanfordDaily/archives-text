# Ten-Man Card Track Squad In Fresno Relays Saturday
## 
### 
With first and second places, to
i Fell intents and purposes, already
i decided between U.S.C. and Olym
pic Club, the only question remain
ing among the some 50-odd other
schools in the Fresno Relays Satur
day is who is going to wind up
I third, fourth, etc.
TOP SPOTS SETTLED
The Winged "O" and the Trojans
will battle it out between them
' selves for the two top spots, and it
is doubtful if all the rest of the
schools in the gountry combined
could muscle in on that dogfight
sideways.
So much for win and place at the
West Coast Relays. Concerning the
| show position, however, it is any
i body's guess. U.C.L.A.. San Jose,
Fresno, Cal, Stanford—it's still any
body's guess.
INDIANS MAY WIND
The Indians will send a 10-man
: aggregation to the Raisin City car-
I nival, including three relay teams
' and four special events men. And
| there is a strong possibility that one
of the latter can bring a first place
I ribbon back to the Farm.
Track Captain Martin Anderson,
who lias turned in a pair of 9.9's in
the 100 this season, is the strongest
possibility for an Indian victory.
That is, if S.C.'s Mel Patton is still
! being bothered with his "pulled"
leg muscle. Despite Anderson's be
ing beaten at the Coliseum by Pat
ton's shadow, George Beaman, the
i Card has turned in better times
than the second place Trojan.
! COMPETITORS
The other special events men are
! Ed Luce, who will have to go some
to bo:it S.C.'s Follis, Wakefield, and
| Meredith and Cal's Hanger in the
! high jump; and Bill Larson and An
[ derson in the pole vault, where
I S.C.'s Winter is leading the field.
The mile relay team is composed
of Ted Off, A 1 Wilkins, Dick Hinze,

and Bob Iverson, while the two
mile quartet has A 1 Holubar, Frank
Ganahl, Iverson, and George
Grimes. Wilkins, Holubar, Grimes,
and Ganahl will also run in the
medley relay.

| Meredith and Cal's Hanger in the
! high jump; and Bill Larson and An
[ derson in the pole vault, where
I S.C.'s Winter is leading the field.
The mile relay team is composed
of Ted Off, A 1 Wilkins, Dick Hinze,

and Bob Iverson, while the two
mile quartet has A 1 Holubar, Frank
Ganahl, Iverson, and George
Grimes. Wilkins, Holubar, Grimes,
and Ganahl will also run in the
medley relay.
With first and second places, to
i Fell intents and purposes, already
i decided between U.S.C. and Olym
pic Club, the only question remain
ing among the some 50-odd other
schools in the Fresno Relays Satur
day is who is going to wind up
I third, fourth, etc.
TOP SPOTS SETTLED
The Winged "O" and the Trojans
will battle it out between them
' selves for the two top spots, and it
is doubtful if all the rest of the
schools in the gountry combined
could muscle in on that dogfight
sideways.
So much for win and place at the
West Coast Relays. Concerning the
| show position, however, it is any
i body's guess. U.C.L.A.. San Jose,
Fresno, Cal, Stanford—it's still any
body's guess.
INDIANS MAY WIND
The Indians will send a 10-man
: aggregation to the Raisin City car-
I nival, including three relay teams
' and four special events men. And
| there is a strong possibility that one
of the latter can bring a first place
I ribbon back to the Farm.
Track Captain Martin Anderson,
who lias turned in a pair of 9.9's in
the 100 this season, is the strongest
possibility for an Indian victory.
That is, if S.C.'s Mel Patton is still
! being bothered with his "pulled"
leg muscle. Despite Anderson's be
ing beaten at the Coliseum by Pat
ton's shadow, George Beaman, the
i Card has turned in better times
than the second place Trojan.
! COMPETITORS
The other special events men are
! Ed Luce, who will have to go some
to bo:it S.C.'s Follis, Wakefield, and
| Meredith and Cal's Hanger in the
! high jump; and Bill Larson and An
[ derson in the pole vault, where
I S.C.'s Winter is leading the field.
