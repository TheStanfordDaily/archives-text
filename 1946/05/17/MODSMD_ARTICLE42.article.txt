# Troy Netters Highly Favored
## 
### 
U.S.C.'s tennis squad will descend
upon the "up and down" Stanford
court men tomorrow afternoon. A
1:30 get-away has been scheduled
on the Farm eours.
Frightening information con
cerning the terrilic abilities of the
Trojan racqucteers continues to
lower the morale of Cardinal fans.
Undefeated in conference compe
tition. U.S.C. has trampled all op
position in a "steamroller" of
fensive toward the coast cham
pionship.
Saturday's clash will be Stanford's
second meeting wilh the Trojan
horde, which frolicked to an embar
rassing 9-0 advantage two weeks
ago. Since the Southland fiasco,
the Indians have remained idle and,
having licked their wounds, will be
gunning for revenge.
Only bright spot in the entire
picture for Stanford fans will be
the strengthening of the squad by
Arnie Beisser's return to number
one singles. Beisser failed* to ac
company the team on its disas
trous L.A. sojourn, so his presence
tomorrow may conceivably pro
duce the spark to trip the favor
ites.
Of course, optimism for a Car
dinal upset suiters a severe blow
when one considers the sensational
caliber of the men of Troy. Net
fanatics throughout the country
have witnessed the phenomenal rise
of the Falkenburg brothers, Tom
and Bob, to national prominence.
Thus the appearance of the brilliant
duo in Trojan spangles tomorrow
gives U.S.C. the decided edge.
Nor is the Trojan aggregation
a "two-man team." a fact attested
to by the Card goose egg in their
previous meeting. Bob Perez,
youthful Troy net star, holds
down number two seeding ahead
of the renowned Tom Falkenburg
who reposes in the third slot.
