STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL: Re-
I ports from the "inside" say that the
evidence against Bill Diffenbaugh,
! Cal football player accused of be- i
i ing involved in the recent Axe theft,
! is rather strong, despite his alibi
that he was at a dinner engagement
at the time of the actual stealing.
The "cloak and dagger" boys
further report that the front-man
lor the culprits has been grilled
by the police, and that he might
be forced to reveal the guilty
names.
Expulsion from school is the :
j penalty for those proven guilty in
| the hatchet-snatching incident.
The group of Stanford students
that has dug up the information
about the trophy further state
that they know nothing about the
threatening letter sent to Ted
Kcnficld . That angle is com
pletely mysterious to them.

Fresno is currently swarming
: with star men. Tomorrow is the
day for the West Coast Relays,
t U.S.C. looms as the favorite to nab
top honors. Stanford, which is en-
I tering ten men, hopes a few points
! are garnered for the home colors.
Martin Anderson should place in
, the 100-yard dash, as his best time
; this season is 9.9. Bill Larson,
whose pole-vaulting has improved
all season, may also collect some |
| points for Stanford.
Ed Luce, who won the high
jump at the relays a few seasons
back, has not been hitting his best
this season, and he may not place
in the raisin community.
The trials will be run oil in the
I afternoon", and the finals get un- j
; der way under the arcs around 7
i o'clock.
* Hi 9
You want to see a good tennis
match? Drop by the Stanford
courts tomorrow afternoon, when
Stanford and U.S.C. hook up.
Stanford will probably drop most
of the matches, but a battle royal
| should be on hand when the

Falkenburg runs up against Ar
nit' Beisser, the top-rate I ardinal.
Arnie pulled the tables when he
downed Noel Brown of I .C.L.A.
in two straight sots. Beisser did
n't make tin- recent trip to I os
Angeles, so this will he his first
outing against the potent Tro>
netters.

ent Stanford varsity, so don't hesi
tate to enter the intramural meet,
either unattached or from an or
ganized group.

You want to see a good tennis
match? Drop by the Stanford
courts tomorrow afternoon, when
Stanford and U.S.C. hook up.
Stanford will probably drop most
of the matches, but a battle royal
| should be on hand when the

Falkenburg runs up against Ar
nit' Beisser, the top-rate I ardinal.
Arnie pulled the tables when he
downed Noel Brown of I .C.L.A.
in two straight sots. Beisser did
n't make tin- recent trip to I os
Angeles, so this will he his first
outing against the potent Tro>
netters.

You like to swim? Why don't
you enter the all-University meet
that is scheduled lor next Tuesday
and Thursday afternoons. Just be
cause you're not of varsity caliber.
Only a select group of swimmers
in the nation could crack the pres
ent Stanford varsity, so don't hesi
tate to enter the intramural meet,
either unattached or from an or
ganized group.
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL: Re-
I ports from the "inside" say that the
evidence against Bill Diffenbaugh,
! Cal football player accused of be- i
i ing involved in the recent Axe theft,
! is rather strong, despite his alibi
that he was at a dinner engagement
at the time of the actual stealing.
The "cloak and dagger" boys
further report that the front-man
lor the culprits has been grilled
by the police, and that he might
be forced to reveal the guilty
names.
Expulsion from school is the :
j penalty for those proven guilty in
| the hatchet-snatching incident.
The group of Stanford students
that has dug up the information
about the trophy further state
that they know nothing about the
threatening letter sent to Ted
Kcnficld . That angle is com
pletely mysterious to them.
