of Housing Committee at yester
day's meeting. She will take oflice |
fall quarter and serve until the i

Housing Committee decided that .
Lagunita be considered as one unit j
in future rom drawings instead of j
as individual casas as it is now. !
The committee also made a recom- j

quarter drawings be on the ratio \
system and fall and winter draw- j
ings on the preference system.
A report on the housing polls will
be made at Conference Monday,
