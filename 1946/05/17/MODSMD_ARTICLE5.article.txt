# Induction Ordered For 20-29 Group
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 16 (UP),
President Truman, seeking to "save
what we can from the near-wreck
age of tiie selective service system,"
tonight, authorized the induction for
military duty of all childless men
between the ages of 20 and 29.
'Ihus, tlie President, in instruc
tions to the Secretaries of War
and Navy, offset in substantial
measure recent congressional ac
tion extending the existing draft
law until July 1 Init exempting
lecn-agc youths and fathers from
its provisions.
Mr. Truman's decision, reached
after Army and Arvy officers had
warned that the 45-day extension
would disrupt seriously the mobil
ization and replacement programs,
was announced in a formal press
conference statement that reiterated
in strong terms the President's dis
satisfaction with the congressional
stop-gap legislation. The latter was
passed just a few hours before the
draft law was due to expire.
Teen-agers and fathers still are
exempt from the draft, at least
for l(i days, but under Mr. Tru
man's authorization, all men in
the age group from 25 through
2!) previously exempt under ex
ecutive order, now are subject to
induction.
The President said he had author
ized the Secretaries of War and
the Navy to "call upon the director
of selective service for the induc
tion of men who become 20 and who
will not have reached the age of 30
on the date of their induction."
"We must save what we can from
the near-wreckage of the selective
service system," he added.
