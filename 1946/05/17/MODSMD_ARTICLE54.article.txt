# Walsh, Court Gardener, Tells Early Farm History
## 
### CONNIE McGILLICUDDY 
It all began as Miss Crandall's
private crusade. It grew into a "Be-
Kind-to-the-Gardcner Week." And
now Lagunita girls are turning
square corners—most of them, that
is.
The reason for all this is Mr. Leo
Walsh, Lagunita's head gardener.
For a time during the war Mr.
Walsh worked at the fire depart
ment. He still is on call 24 hours
every other day. Besides these two
jobs, he manages to deliver Uni
versity mail in the mornings. But
the job he likes best is taking care
of Lagunita Court.
ONCE AT KOBLE
He's been doing it for 12 years.
For eight years before that, he was
a gardener at Roble. He was on
hand when Lagunita was just a
blueprint, and he helped to trans
plant the two 60-year-old olive
trees on either side of Lagunita's
entrance, and the oak trees which
have now grown twice as large.
It was October 1. 1934, he recalled;
that Lagunita was opened and 1937
when Olivo and Granada were add
ed to the Court. '"Yes, it's been 12
years," Mr. Walsh said reflectively,
"and a pleasure at that." But the
girls were more careful then, he
declared. They didn't walk across
the green lawns, lean their bicycles
against the carefully trimmed hedg
es, or put cigarettes in the flower
pots. They were careful then be
cause the Court was so new and
they were so proud of it.
GIRLS DON'T THINK
'"But I've never had any trouble,"
Mr. Walsh insisted. "They just
don't think, that's all." He smiled
when he told of his losing battle
with the daphnes. All the girls
would want just a little bit, and
pretty soon there was no daphne
left. One of his present problems is
the camellia bushes. Sometimes
they're broken off carelessly, he
explained. So he just trims them
down, buds and all, until the bushes
regain their shape.
Another of his troubles are the
quail and the hummingbirds. The
quail nest in the window boxes, and
often he has had to wait 30 days
until the baby quail hatched out
before he could water the plants.
PROTECTED QUAIL
Sometimes he's had to protect the
quail from Lagunita women. Often
they wanted to pick up baby quail
who couldn't climb steps or were
caught in a gutter by the sidewalk,
and he warned them to let the
frightened birds alone.
Mr. Walsh and his family have
many connections with the Farm.

He was born just across San Fran
cisquito Creek, he said, and always j
roamed the hills when he was a
boy. He always came to the big j
rally bonfires Stanford held, and !
loved to watch the Farm's baseball j
and football teams.
IN STANFORD FAMILY
Five of his brothers at one time i
have worked for the University, I
and one of his brothers, Ed Walsh,
is now head storekeeper of the Cor- ;
poration Yard.
Also when Stanford University |
was built Mr. Walsh's father was a
cement finisher, helping to lay the '
foundations; and in 1906, after the !
earthquake, he helped to repair the [
damage.
FARM HISTORY
Stanford history is an old story to j
Mr. Walsh. He explained how the j
Farm came to be built on its pres
ent site. Originally, the Stanfords ;
intended to by the Johnston tract I
across San Francisquito Creek. j
But the Johnstons were in Ireland
and couldn't be reached, so Stan
ford chose the acres this side of i
the creek.
Twenty years of working for j
Stanford University and a boyhood !
spent roaming the Farm—and Mr.
Walsh has many a story to tell. Ask
him sometime.
