# Truman, Stalin Confer On World Food Crisis
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. May Hi (UP).
â€”President Truman revealed to
night that he has been in touch
with Generalissimo Stalin on the
world food crisis, presumably to
appeal for a greater Russian con
tribution to the famine-stricken
peoples of Europe and Asia.
The President did not elaborate
but he said he hoped to make an
announcement soon on his ex
change with the Soviet premier.
His disclosure recalled recent
criticism directed against Russia
for her relatively small partici
pation in the United Nations'
worldwide famine relief efforts.
American critics were particu
larly outspoken on Russia's sale
of 500,000 tons of grain to France
at a time when U.S. and other
food relief shipments were being
sent into Soviet-controlled areas
of eastern Europe.
