# MAN—MINUS PANTS
## 
### 
VANCOUVER, B. C„ May 19
(UP). A young man lost his pants
here today in a freak accident and
he was more embarrassed than in
jured.
As he rode his bicycle through a
downtown street a motorist opened
the door of a parked car. The door
handle caught the youth's trousers
and threw him to the pavement—
sans his trousers.
After a checkup at a local hos
pital, attaches reported the youth
suffered from "shock and embar
rassment."
