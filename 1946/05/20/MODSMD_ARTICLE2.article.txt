# Tarkington Dies in Home From Bronchial Disease
## 
### 
INDIANAPOLIS, May 1!) (UP).—
Booth Tarkington, one of the na
tion's I.e. t loved writers, died quiet
ly in hi.s luxurious tree-shaded
home tonight.
He was 7(J years old. Death came
from bronchial obstructions.
The "Gentleman from Indiana"
had been ill for nearly two years.
Toward the end of his life, he cur
tailed his activities more and more |
and spent the last two months in :
bed.
His wife, Susannah, was with him
when lie died at 7:10 p.m. Relatives
said death was not unexpected. His j
illness had sapped hi.s strength over
a long period of time.
Tarkington, who won perhaps his i
greatest lame writing about chil - I
drcn in "Fcnrod" and "Penrod and I
Sam," had none of his own. His j
closest relatives were three nephews, I
Booth T., John and Donald Jame
ron, all of Indianapolis.
Without the companionship of his
wife, Tarkington's last years might j
have been lonely ones. One of his
closest friends, Harry Leon Wilson, I
died in 19.18. Another, Julian Street
lived in Connecticut.
Tarkinghm seldom left Indianap- [
• •lis, except in the summer, when ho
stayed in a cottage in Kcnncbunk- I
port, Maine.
So complete was his self-imposed
isolation that hi.s family notified no 1
outsiders of his death. When the j
news leaked out, the family tele- i
phone went unanswered.
