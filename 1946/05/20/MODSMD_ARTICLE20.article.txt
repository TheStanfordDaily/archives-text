# Guest Rabbi Gives Talk
## 
### 
"Fact and Fiction About the Jew"
was the topic of the sermon deliv
ered yesterday by Rabbi Irving F.
Reichert of Temple Emanu-El, San
Francisco, in the Memorial Church.
Attacking the prejudices against
the Jews and supplying extermina
tion figures, the rabbi pointed out
that there is no such thing as a
"Jewish race" and that in his entire
experience he has never encoun
tered a "typical Jew."
Expressing the opinion that the
United Nations should back the im
mediate return of 100,000 Jews to
Palestine, Rabbi Reichert stated that
Zionist demands there have only
served to increase Arab hostility.
However, the speaker believed that
a Jewish-Arab government could
eventually be worked out.
