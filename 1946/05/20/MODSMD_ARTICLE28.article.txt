# The 						Case for the Future
## 
### 
It is time we stopped fooling ourselves
with the tradition of the old days.
To be sentimental now and then, to shuffle
through our memories of the old boys, old
events, old achievements once and a while,
yes. But to live the whole of our lives in the
realm of the past is unhealthy.
The past is not a part of us, the Stanford
of today. And it is too bad we have to depend
upon it the way we do. We depend upon it
as the old source of spirit at Stanford. We
depond upon it because we aren't capable of
generating any spirit or pride of the Stanford
of today.
We don't live for what we can do at Stan
ford and what S'.anford can do for us. To
many people, the Stanford of the present is
a let-down.
Not much choice left, is there? Just the fu
ture . . . which we can mold, create, fit for
ourselves. The future, which we can be a
part of and feel responsible for. We can
make it a satisfying and worthwhile next
year. Or we can let ourselves and the
school slip deeper into the endless groove
which is so noticeable.
We can look forward . . .
To next autumn when we can start with a

clean slate.
To ridding ourselves of the lackadaisical
attitude that has filtered to the core of Stan
ford.
To establishing a strong, fighting student
government that v/ill set as its goal only a
strong Stanford, and will put through any
measure that will achieve it.
To a student body that will support a team
winning or losing. To teams that v/ill fight
winning or losing.
To students who will attack their indi
vidual problems with vigor. To an adminis
tration that will attack the students' problems
with vigor plus understanding.
To a Stanford that will observe the Honor
Code not as a tradition, but as a living, pur
poseful thing.
To making Stanford a place that will re
flect with resonance the thought, ability, and
action of the student body to the world.
To an alert Stanford that is waiting to grasp
all that is offered it. To a Stanford that v/ill
be a vital part of a democratic system that
needs it to live.
To a student body that will recognize and
accept its responsibility to itself and to the
world. To the future.—Stuart Millar.

action of the student body to the world.
To an alert Stanford that is waiting to grasp
all that is offered it. To a Stanford that v/ill
be a vital part of a democratic system that
needs it to live.
To a student body that will recognize and
accept its responsibility to itself and to the
world. To the future.—Stuart Millar.
It is time we stopped fooling ourselves
with the tradition of the old days.
To be sentimental now and then, to shuffle
through our memories of the old boys, old
events, old achievements once and a while,
yes. But to live the whole of our lives in the
realm of the past is unhealthy.
The past is not a part of us, the Stanford
of today. And it is too bad we have to depend
upon it the way we do. We depend upon it
as the old source of spirit at Stanford. We
depond upon it because we aren't capable of
generating any spirit or pride of the Stanford
of today.
We don't live for what we can do at Stan
ford and what S'.anford can do for us. To
many people, the Stanford of the present is
a let-down.
Not much choice left, is there? Just the fu
ture . . . which we can mold, create, fit for
ourselves. The future, which we can be a
part of and feel responsible for. We can
make it a satisfying and worthwhile next
year. Or we can let ourselves and the
school slip deeper into the endless groove
which is so noticeable.
We can look forward . . .
To next autumn when we can start with a

clean slate.
To ridding ourselves of the lackadaisical
attitude that has filtered to the core of Stan
ford.
To establishing a strong, fighting student
government that v/ill set as its goal only a
strong Stanford, and will put through any
measure that will achieve it.
To a student body that will support a team
winning or losing. To teams that v/ill fight
winning or losing.
To students who will attack their indi
vidual problems with vigor. To an adminis
tration that will attack the students' problems
with vigor plus understanding.
To a Stanford that will observe the Honor
Code not as a tradition, but as a living, pur
poseful thing.
To making Stanford a place that will re
flect with resonance the thought, ability, and
action of the student body to the world.
To an alert Stanford that is waiting to grasp
all that is offered it. To a Stanford that v/ill
be a vital part of a democratic system that
needs it to live.
To a student body that will recognize and
accept its responsibility to itself and to the
world. To the future.—Stuart Millar.
