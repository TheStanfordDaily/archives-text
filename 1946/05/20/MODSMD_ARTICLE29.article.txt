# A 						Family Affair
## 
### 
We had heard about the Stanford "family."
One lives on "the Farm," hellos strangers on
the Quad, and calls the president "Uncle"
Don, according to the best informed sources
on the University.
We freshmen are now part of your vast
"family." But somehow our acquaintance
ship has been limited to the younger mem
bers of the house.
Civ professors nod agreeably to us in the
library, but we would never think of taking
a personal problem to them. We are not
timid about confronting an instructor with a
grade which we think undeserved, but
would never consider asking him to to play
a set of tennis.
In college we looked forward to personal
contact with our instructors. Something more
than an education from a book could be
gained from four years at a university.
The absence of student-faculty relation
ships cannot be squarely directed to either
group. The faculty holds after-dinner coffees,

and & handful of students appear. Again,
few professors can schedule enough time to
personally acquaint themselves with each
student. .
In a larger university, we would not expect
the close relationship we want from Stanford.
A student body of even 5,000 is relatively
small to the enrollment of many state institu
tions. Stanford once had this close contact
between its two groups during the major sys
tem where the freshman student went direct
ly to the department of his choice.
A revised system of advising whereby
each advisor handles a limited number of
students and helps them to meet the instruc
tors in his proposed major might again es
tablish these lost contacts.
The informal atmosphere of Stanford does
not prevail in the classroom. We know our
professors only from eight to five each day.
Will the Stanford of the future find time to
make her mythical family a reality?— Paula
Nusser.
