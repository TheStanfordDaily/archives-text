(Editorial Note: The Daily's campus opinion
column is open to any candidate who wishes to
present ideas to the students in less than 200
words. The Daily will continue to print non
partisan accounts of the coming election.)
This is an open invitation to all presidential
candidates who have actual ideas which they plan
to promote.
Next year is the crisis year. The alternatives are
strikingly apparent: A standard candidate for an
other stagnant year will retain a puppet govern
ment. A progressive candidate, ready to open spe
cific, workable plans lor student appraisal, can

lead Stanford to a deserved position of leadership
among student governments.
Large living groups have made apparent their
desire to hear the candidates present working so
lutions to student issues. Any sincere candidate
will contact these groups and present such a plat
form.
This must he a campaign of issues. Of those
who are not willing to open their constructive sug
gestions to these groups at this time, a question
must be raised—as to the existence of such con
structive ideas, and thus, the sincerity of a can
didate's interest in a progressive student govern
ment must he challenged.
