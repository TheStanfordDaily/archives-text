### GEORGE ECKSTEIN 
We have heard that a group of girls from Lagu
nita were planning to spend the summer in Europe,
but the $150 apiece wasn't raised to send them.
# * * *
Then there was athletic Sue Porter of Branner
who left her boy friend's house in a huff, but the
huff broke down, and she had to run all the way
home.
* + * *
Who were those bad, baaaaad boys who plugged
up the Roble switchboard for two hours last Sat
urday? By making calls to Roble from all over
campus and leaving the receivers off the hooks,
the boys managed to paralyze Roble's social ac
tivities. 'Fes.s up, fellas.
* ♦ ♦ ♦
What ex-Bull Sessioner is running for three of
fices at the same time? We won't tell you his name,
but his initials are H. D. Thoreau.
♦ * * *
When the Fijis ran out of hot dogs at the Soph
Carnival, they transformed their establishment into
a kissing booth by drafting five innocent maidens.
A very poor substitute, indeed!

The A.S.S.U. elections are this Thursday, and
with approximately 130 candidates tossing their
fedoras and spring straws into the ring, it looks like
a fairly interesting affair. Be sure and attend the
election assembly Wednesday at the Frost Am
phitheater, and meet the men and women who will
be your school leaders for the coming year. But
more important, get out and vote, and insure your
candidate's chance for victory. A poor turnout at
the polls means a poor election,

Stanford, 1,450 are veterans, and 1,743 are women."

Remember that, with enough student support, a
new Student Union could be completed by next
fall.
