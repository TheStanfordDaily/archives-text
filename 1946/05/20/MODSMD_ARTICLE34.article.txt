# Priest Calls For Clothes
## 
### 
"We need your help, Americans,"
said M. L'Abbe Toussaint, priest of
the French village of La Bresse, in
a plea sent to Miss Lucie L. La
taillade, director of Roble, asking
for help for his people.
VILLAGE BURNED
M. Toussaint told how everything
in his village had been burned by
the Germans in three days. Every
thing which belonged to more than
6,000 people had been completely
demolished, and the inhabitants of
La Bresse were forced to live in
the forest without shelter for part
of the winter. "Now," he said, "these
same people, after five years of war,
are living in tumble-down cellars or
temporary huts. They have no food
and very little clothing."
Through this appeal which was
sent to Miss Lataillade, the French
priest hopes to obtain any available
unused clothing for his people.
M. Toussaint's plea was an
swered this week by Rohle corri
dor .'{-center. They have started
to send weekly packages to the
French priest for him to distrib
ute t<> families who are in dire
need wf supplies. In one small Ro
ble corridor of about 25 girls, it
was found in the first survey that
there were enough articles of
clothing to make up three pack
ages instead of just one.
Miss Lataillade pointed out that
if this amount could be contributed
by one small group, other living
groups could accomplish even more.
Any clothing no longer used by stu
dents, but which could be made
serviceable by the French people
are wanted for these packages.
"Individuals who desire to start
this valuable work," said the hall
director, "probably need not even
go outside their own living groups
to find students with relatives in
Europe, who are in worse condi
tion than the people of this French
village."
She further staled that if any
group desires, she could probably
furnish them with names of specific
families who need such help. "It is
such a worthy cause," she contin
ued, "and in comparison to other
schools, Stanford is doing so little."
Miss Lataillade said that the
packages must meet a specified
weight of not more than 11 pounds
with wrapping, must be tightly
packed and correctly labeled.
If any individual or campus group
is earnestly interested in helping in
this crisis, they should contact eith
er Miss Lataillade or Diane Worth
of Roble corridor 3-center.

"We need your help, Americans,"
said M. L'Abbe Toussaint, priest of
the French village of La Bresse, in
a plea sent to Miss Lucie L. La
taillade, director of Roble, asking
for help for his people.
VILLAGE BURNED
M. Toussaint told how everything
in his village had been burned by
the Germans in three days. Every
thing which belonged to more than
6,000 people had been completely
demolished, and the inhabitants of
La Bresse were forced to live in
the forest without shelter for part
of the winter. "Now," he said, "these
same people, after five years of war,
are living in tumble-down cellars or
temporary huts. They have no food
and very little clothing."
Through this appeal which was
sent to Miss Lataillade, the French
priest hopes to obtain any available
unused clothing for his people.
M. Toussaint's plea was an
swered this week by Rohle corri
dor .'{-center. They have started
to send weekly packages to the
French priest for him to distrib
ute t<> families who are in dire
need wf supplies. In one small Ro
ble corridor of about 25 girls, it
was found in the first survey that
there were enough articles of
clothing to make up three pack
ages instead of just one.
Miss Lataillade pointed out that
if this amount could be contributed
by one small group, other living
groups could accomplish even more.
Any clothing no longer used by stu
dents, but which could be made
serviceable by the French people
are wanted for these packages.
"Individuals who desire to start
this valuable work," said the hall
director, "probably need not even
go outside their own living groups
to find students with relatives in
Europe, who are in worse condi
tion than the people of this French
village."
She further staled that if any
group desires, she could probably
furnish them with names of specific
families who need such help. "It is
such a worthy cause," she contin
ued, "and in comparison to other
schools, Stanford is doing so little."
Miss Lataillade said that the
packages must meet a specified
weight of not more than 11 pounds
with wrapping, must be tightly
packed and correctly labeled.
If any individual or campus group
is earnestly interested in helping in
this crisis, they should contact eith
er Miss Lataillade or Diane Worth
of Roble corridor 3-center.
