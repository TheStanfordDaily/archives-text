# Green, Pranks Plague Past Diaper Editions
## 
### 
Upon hearing the crack of the
feature editor's whip we awoke
from our nap over a Daily type
writer to find said slave-driver as
signing us a story on tTie history of
frosh editions since the first Daily
Palu Alto rolled off the flatbed pre. l ;;
back in the '90's. We groaned, real
izing it would take days to thumb
through the files, gleaning out ac
counts of the traps set for the wary,
but green frosh staffs. It did. Three
floaters and a Civ lecture.
SOME WERE GREEN
The results of our .survey, quite
unlike the results of the polls to be
found elsewhere in this edition,
were monumentally inconclusive.
But adhering to the inductive meth
od of making big conclusions out of
little ones, ve determined that frosh
editions are usually distinguished
by their green color, symbolism
evident.
The earliest appearance of the
Shamrock shade in the Daily was
the Irosh edition of 1912. This
one was comparatively conserva
tive, featuring green ink on the
customary stock. Hut by 1914 the
lively editorial stall' in collabora
tion with the business manager
persuaded the boys in the back
shop to put over a real sharpie,
namely, tin? appearance on March
27, 1914, of a green-ink-en-green
paper issue, snagging our nomina
tion for the most illegible (typo
graphically) Daily on record. Only
by wearing our infra red filter
sunglasses could we decipher it.
The frosh apparently were tipped
oIT, for a notice was inserted can
celing the annual senior picnic.
Since then, green has dogged the
frosh papers of '15, '16 (that was
emerald green), '18, '1!), '27 (we fell
asleep between Volumes 52 and 71
and they could have been any color
of the rainbow),* '41, and '43.
UPPERCLASSMEN MARRED
The upperelass members of the
Daily staff, who are traditionally
barred from the Shack while the
frosh edition goes to press, usually
exhibit a fiendish sense of humor
by phoning in hot stories about
emergency meetings of Excom, Dr.
Tresidder's death, and reports of
events more credible but equally
false. But the wily frosh weren't al
ways caught napping. The effort of
April 21, 1941, edited by Bob Son
tag, recently returned, notified
through the Bulletin Board that
"The edit board of the Daily will

j meet at 11:45 tonight on top of the
Hoover Libe to practice Christmas
Carols. Accompaniment will bo
provided by the carillon chimes."
On June 5, 1911, the frosh sheet
was put out by what is now al
most the entire present Edit Board.
They showed unusual foresight
by almost predicting D-Day.
In 1915 the Daily apparently was
immune to libel laws, for in the
' classified section of class of '18's pa
per appeared this morsel of sly wit:
"The identity of the party who stole
' the raincoat from the Library
I Thursday night is known. Return it
immediately and avoid trouble." It
! appears that the upperelassmen
| were awake for once.
ROUGHS WERE ROUGH
The nature of the Stanford Rough
was hinted when the frosh landed
1 a quarter page ad for Bull Durham
J tobacco along with a notice from a
Palo Alto merchant thai he had in
| stock "mushroom plaited dress
shirts for $2.00." The class of '17
| was dapper.
The class of '21 really held a
high opinion of themselves if we
! are to believe the frosh edition of
I 'IS. Writing for posterity, no
doubt, an editorial scribbler
voiced the lofty prediction that
j "future researchers would look to
j '21 as having produced the high
i est representative type of college
journalism." We won't argue with
them but merely point to one of
their headlines reading: "Frosh
Doped to Win Irish Marathon."
The tone of the editorial might
indicate the whole blamed class
1 were opium eaters. Wonder who
bad the Roble reefer concession?
