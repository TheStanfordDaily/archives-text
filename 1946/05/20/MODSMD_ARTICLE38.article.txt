# Farm Prepares to Face Future
## Administration Reports On Enrolment, Housing OUR FOTO FUTURE 
### 
The midway point in the plans of
Stanford administration regarding
enrollment, housing, and tuition has
been reached; provisions for these
three vital features have been ini
tialed and now await governmental
sanction and careful study by the
Board of Trustees.
John M'. Stalnaker, dean of stu
dents. has predicted that Stanford
is scheduled to have an enrollment
of at least 5.000 students for the
next four or five years, at least
until all veterans who plan a col
lege education have availed them
selves of the (*.I. Bill.
OLD STUDENTS FIRST
Even 5,000 cannot be definitely
stated as the number of students
to be enrolled in Stanford, accord
ing to Dean Stalnaker, for the Uni
versity must accept all old return
ing students, and this number can
not be estimated, as yet.
The Dean of Students further
stated that the number of women
students admitted to the University
will be determined by the now ex
isting housing facilities. The pro
portionate small number of fresh
men women to enter Roble autumn
quarter will be approximately the
number to be admitted in the next
few years.
MOUSING STILL PROBLEM
The major housing problem, that
of veterans, is awaiting the official
go-ahead, according to Dean Stal
naker. By providing large units for
fifty and sixty persons and addition
al housing projects for married vet
erans, the administration hopes to
take care of the veterans' needs. He
emphasized, however, that the plans
for using Dibble facilities is still
indefinite.
"Within the next few years," Stal
naker said, "the University hopes
to have enough housing units so
that the entire lower division can
be housed on campus. It has been
the University's policy of having all
residences on campus that has con
tributed to the school's feeling of
oneness. Residences on campus have
"been one of the University's great
est assets.''
GRADS TO LIVE HERE
To have all upper division and
graduate students living in campus
units will be undertaken as soon as
facilities for lower division have
been provided, stated Dean Stal
naker. He went further in stating
that this probably could not be un
dertaken for quite a few years.

In discussing the recent, rumor j
that Stanford University's tuition 1
would be markedly raised, Ernest j
Stephen Eurich, financial vice-pres- 1
ident, said, "Too much has been said
about the tuition already." He stat
ed that it is purely guesswork as to ;
whether the tuition will be raised i
next fall.
The Board of Trustees is still in
vestigating the need for a higher
tuition, and no definite decision will
be made for some time, according to
Mr. Eurich.

ing students, and this number can
not be estimated, as yet.
The Dean of Students further
stated that the number of women
students admitted to the University
will be determined by the now ex
isting housing facilities. The pro
portionate small number of fresh
men women to enter Roble autumn
quarter will be approximately the
number to be admitted in the next
few years.
MOUSING STILL PROBLEM
The major housing problem, that
of veterans, is awaiting the official
go-ahead, according to Dean Stal
naker. By providing large units for
fifty and sixty persons and addition
al housing projects for married vet
erans, the administration hopes to
take care of the veterans' needs. He
emphasized, however, that the plans
for using Dibble facilities is still
indefinite.
"Within the next few years," Stal
naker said, "the University hopes
to have enough housing units so
that the entire lower division can
be housed on campus. It has been
the University's policy of having all
residences on campus that has con
tributed to the school's feeling of
oneness. Residences on campus have
"been one of the University's great
est assets.''
GRADS TO LIVE HERE
To have all upper division and
graduate students living in campus
units will be undertaken as soon as
facilities for lower division have
been provided, stated Dean Stal
naker. He went further in stating
that this probably could not be un
dertaken for quite a few years.

In discussing the recent, rumor j
that Stanford University's tuition 1
would be markedly raised, Ernest j
Stephen Eurich, financial vice-pres- 1
ident, said, "Too much has been said
about the tuition already." He stat
ed that it is purely guesswork as to ;
whether the tuition will be raised i
next fall.
The Board of Trustees is still in
vestigating the need for a higher
tuition, and no definite decision will
be made for some time, according to
Mr. Eurich.
