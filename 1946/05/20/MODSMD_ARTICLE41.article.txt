ments on campus, according to the
Daily poll.
Thirty-nine students gave hous
ing accommodations their vote of
approval. Of these, 22 saw a need
for more housing for all groups on
campus; nine wanted housing for
veterans especially; two specified
housing for married students; two
stressed men's living groups; and
one requested housing for grad
uates.
A definite improvement of the
general facilities of the university
was the verdict of 36 poll answer

recreation center with a ball room
large enough to accommodate the
entire student body.

Five upper division students
begged the return of Stanford

Two students were disgusted
with student government at Stan
ford as it works now and asked
immediate revamping.

professors will not
leave were asked.
One Rough promptly suggested
that his hall, Encina, be torn down
as soon as possible.
