# Students Ask Low Enrolment
## 
### 
When asked, "Do you think the
enrollment at Stanford should be
high or low in the future," 85 per
cent of Stanford students said
that a low enrollment would be
better, and 15 per cent were in
favor of a large student body.
A high enrollment would be over
4,000, while a low one would be
confined to 4,000 or under. The
main objection to admitting more
than 4,000 at this time is that the
University does not have the facili
ties for so many students. Some
said that if it were possible to ex
tend the facilities, a high enroll
ment would be desirable because of
the educational opportunities of
fered at Stanford.
OPINIONS ON ENROLLMENT
The following opinions were of
fered by students when questioned

for a purpose. There are more
advantages for students."
Robert Blackburn, Harrison: "The
Stanford tradition of high quality
cannot be maintained with gross
quantity."
Bill Stover, off-campus: "I
should like to see a large number
of undergraduates and an exten
sion of the graduate schools."
Rena Jean Black, Madrono: "If we
have the facilities, let's take more
students and to heck with the snob
bery."
Don Biggs. Toyon: "Employment
aids for the Stanford graduate
through the alumni association could
be extended to more people through
a higher enrollment in the univer
sity."
