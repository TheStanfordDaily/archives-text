# Remodeling of Administration Building Heads Agenda—New Law School, Dorm
## 
### 
Big building improvements are in store for the Farm of the future. Centered in the foreground of long
range planning arc a Law School, a law dorm, remodeled quarters for the administration, new living units, and
a technology extension on the Quad.
Number one on the proposed program, which will begin when building conditions stabilize, will be the
reconversion of the Administration Building into a Law School. This of course will necessitate reconverted
quarters for the administration.
A large lecture hall seating 150 will occupy the first floor of the new .school. In this hall 15 square feet will
be allotted to each person, providing room for a de;;k, chair, and a number of books, in comparison to the stand
ard 11 square feet per person. The dean's office, small classroom, and an elevator will also be on this floor.
A mezzanine will be built in, and on the second floor the stacks and reading rooms will be set up. A moot
court, perfect in detail, will be a special feature of this floor. A student lounge, typing facilities, and possibly a
practice dictaphone will be provided in the basement.
Judge George E. Crothers, '95, has donated funds for a law dormitory which will be built as soon as
possible in the vicinity of Branncr. This building will house upper division law students.
The administration offices, if the present plan is carried out, will be established in the rear part of the pres
ent Ad Building and the vacated law building part of the adjoining court may be enclosed to provide addi-

tional space. This is the first development to follow the original plan of
filling in the space between the outer and inner Quad buildings.
Next in line will be the student activities unit, probably in the area off
the present Union, and covering the whole block extending to the Press.
The Post Office may be situated so as to serve out through the activities
building and still be tied in at the rear with the Press for convenience in
shipping.
PLAN STARTED IXBK
Following the Olmsted Plait of 1S8(». a technology extension of (lie
Quad on the west, corresponding in position to the library quad on the
cast, will house the science departments and will fill the block facing
that side of the outer quad. When this is done the Social Science and
Humanities departments will dominate the inner quad. Lomita Drive
will probably be blocked to automobiles as foot traffic will then be
as heavy as it is between the two existing quads today.
Remodeling also looms on the horizon. The looms of the inner and
outer quad will be revamped to improve lighting, acoustics, and room

sizes, leaving the traditional archi
tecture intact, but modernizing the
interiors. Encina, when the work
men arc finished, will honestly be
an attractive modern men's dorm.
NEW PAVILION
Still in the conversational stage
are ideas concerning a new basket
ball pavilion. Post-sitter-behinders
will be glad to hear this, but nothing
has been decided.
Says Eldridge T. Spencer, Di
rector of Planning: "The plans for
future buildings will restore the
tradition of the inner quad as the
center «>f Stanford life." This in
volves the development of an ef
ficient circulation system includ
ing parking pools as close to the
academic center as possible.
While these buildings and vast
improvements are still either ideas
in the minds of the men in the Plan
ning Department or in sketch form,
they will become a reality when the
world settles down and the future
is won.
