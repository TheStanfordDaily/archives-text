# Fraternities Look to the Future
## Autumn Quarter Return of Houses Poses Problems for Row Residents 
### 
Alter three years of limited op
eration Stanford fraternities return
to their prewar footing with the op
ening of the fall quarter next Sep
tember.
Houses are being returned to lo
eal chapters by the University at
the end of this quarter and when
school opens in the fall 22 of the 24
prewar fraternity houses will be in
operation.
PROBLEMS FOR I RATS. TOO
The return of the houses to fra
ternities, their reopening under fra
ternity management, and the post
war growth of depleted chapters all
are problems faced by the Stanford
interfraternity organization.
Since fraternities have operated
rather in the background of stu
dent life for the past three years this
article will attempt to review the
system of interfraternal govern
ment, present changes in organiza
tion, and discuss problems the fra
ternities face within their own
groups as well as in campus life as
a whole.
COOPUERATION KEYNOTE
An Interfraternity Board of Con
trol now operates to give the great
est amount of cooperation between

fraternities, the administration, the
faculty, and the alumni. The board
supervises, enacts, and enforces all
legislative, executive, and discipli
nary matters in connection with

fraternities.
Six student members are Ed Luce
chairman, John Hanlon secretary
treasurer, Tom Ashley, Ed Hall,
Bob Kennedy, and John Sadler.
They work directly with Dean of
Students John M. Stalnaker, two
faculty members, Professors Harold
M. Bacon and Elmer D. Fagan, and
two alumni members Charles J.
Crary and Frank Carey.
CO ORDINATION N EEDED
In planning for the reopening of

the houses a new coordinating com
mittee has been set up to work with
resident advisers.
The Interfraternity Council deals
with interfraternity problems. It is
responsible and and receives coun
sel from the Board of Control. Luce
is president and Hanlon secretary
treasurer, and the members are
presidents of local chapters.
HELL RULES BACK
A Rules Committee consisting of
Phil Prince and Ross Hughes head
ed by Sadler is preparing a set of
rushing, hell-week, and initiation
rules to correspond with those in ef
fect before the war. The present
set of rules were relaxed in design
in order to allow fraternities to
build up their membership. They
will be in effect until the end of
summer quarter.
As now allowed, each fraternity
is permitted to pledged a maximum
of 28 men by June and 42 men by
the end of the summer session. Fra
ternities may initiate registered
pledges who are not minus more
than six grade points at any time
that the University is in session.
FIVE MEMBERS MINIMUM
Operating under the Interfrater
nity Council are the local chapters
whose immediate problems are the
reopening of their houses. The Uni
versity requires that there be a
minimum of five active members or
pledges who plan to live in the
house. If the house cannot be filled
by members and pledges the frater
nity must accept additional occu
pants who will be assigned to the
house by the University after due
consultation with the fraternity.
A responsible resident adviser is
required for all houses. House

| mothers are recommended by the
j University but faculty members or
graduate students are also eligible.
BUDGETS IN SOON
House bills for the fall quarter
j will probably run between $65 and
| $70. Each fraternity is to submit a
| preliminary budget to the Interfra
ternity Board by June 1 and a final
one by August 1.
Stanford chapters are looking to
ward the future with a full realiza
tion of the deficiencies of fraternity
life in the past. New levels in
scholarship and living standards are
desired both by fraternity leaders
and the University administration.
"Fraternities make great contrib
utions to student life but there is
always room for improvement and
we are constantly working with this
in mind," states Luce.
CITIZENSHIP SOUGHT
Fraternities provide a means for
I developing group responsibility,
good citizenship, and intimate
friendship. Along with these func
tions the local chapters are embark
ing on a program of improved ac
ademic standards, balanced social
activities, and increased cooperation
between the fraternity, the Univer
sity, and alumni organizations.

Each fraternity is to submit a plan
of operation consistent with the
above goals before reopening will be
approved.
The question of the success of
these programs lies with the indi
vidual fraternity man. If future In
terfraternity Councils keep in mind
when setting policies for fraternity
J men that continued gains must be
J made in social and academic stand-
I ards, local chapters will keep their
place in campus life.
This is the feeling and the policy
! of the present council.
