# AN EDITORIAL NOTE
## 
### 
At this moment, the main worry
of (he eating clubs is how soon
they will come hack. Hut to he
short-sighted enough to let our
consideration of this prohleni stop
upon this issue would he danger
out.
Sure, they'll come hack. But
when they do, will it have been
worth it? Will it he because they
are needed at Stanford? If the
answer to this question is no,
then they shouldn't bother to
come hack at all.
If the answer is yes, then let
them come back on the same
lÂ»asis that they had when they
were of benefit to the campus.
We believe the answer is yes.
And we believe that eating clubs
need to retain the freedom that
once was theirs.
About the ultimate objective of
the University to enlarge its con
trol over all aspects of student
life in the future we can say little
more than that it is opposed
to the underlying foundation of
Stanford.
