# Stalnaker Tells Policy
## 
### 
The problem is temporary ver
sus permanent planning!
That is what Stanford's Dean of
Students John Stalnaker says not
only in relation to the hoped-for
return of the Eating Clubs but about
all things to be done on campus.
And (he administration is de
cidedly in favor of permanent
plans.
NO TEMPORARY PLANS
This means that structures such
as that pictured on this page are
the goal toward which Stanford is
unerringly shooting for and working
toward. Whether the students of
this, the next or next year's quar
ters will ever be able to enjoy any
type of improvement on campus
would make little difference to the
University because half-way here
today, gone-tomorrow measure are
out.
"Yes," we want to see the Eat
ing Clubs back on campus," says
Stalnaker, "but until they can
come back as planned according
to the blueprints, they will have
to exist within the present Uni
versity system."
COMMONS AVAILABLE
This means that the best the ad
ministration can offer would be a
few rooms (as many as possible af
ter the regular demand is taken care
of) in the Encina Commons, given
with the understanding that they
be used to ihe fullest extent pos
sible so that no dining facilities may
be wasted.
"1 would like to have all the
returned Eating Club men who
are anxious to resume, get or
ganized soon and report to me,"
says Stalnaker. "Before we can
plan to return to Eating Clubs,
we want the men to tell us they
want them back."
BUT WHEN?
Although not willing to state a
definite date when the proposed
university-supervised, small unit
living and eating facilities in which
the Eating Clubs could conceivably
fit will be completed, Stalnaker
emphasizes that the change will not
be overnight or over-summer.
"We'll just have to make the best
of what we have util we can have
the best," says the Dean of Stu
dents.
