# Secretary Thwarts Daily's Attempt To Interview Hoover Via Telephone
## 
### 
Herbert Hoover was almost inter
viewed by the Daily this weekend.
But the hottest man in the coun
try just got away. The Daily had
traced him to Chicago after he left
Washington and found out the
phone number and address nf an
old friend with whom the former
president was going to spend the
night.
We checked his arrival in Chi-

cago, allotted time for him to talk
to the press, secretly gloating that
the Daily would be the first pa
per in the country to get a pri
vate interview with him.
And we almost made it. We
wouldn't be denied. Being evasive,
he decided to stay for the afternoon
in a Chicago hotel penthouse.
When the distance operator asked
for him at the hotel, he "wasn't in."
By staying on the wire for the
whole day, we finally coaxed the

hotel operator to let us talk to one
|of his secretaries. Things looked
promising. Maybe we were going
] to have that scoop.
We talked our way through that
! secretary to one a little higher up
in the Hoover hierarchy until we
finally got to Miss Bemice Miller,
Hoover's first and personal secre
i tary.
But she was too tough for us. Po
j litely and firmly she informed us
' that Mr. Hoover was busy, and un-
I der terrific tension. Furthermore,
j he was leaving for South America
in a few days if that would help us.
j She paused for a moment. In the
| background we heard a man's voice
1 dimly coming over the wire. Who
J knows, it might have been Hoover
j himself.
It's too had that the Daily
didn't get to interview Mr. Hoov
er. VVe had some rather interest
ing questions to ask him. For in
stance, what did he think of
the strong student movement for
world federation, and did he be
; lieve the U.N. organization was
profiting by the mistakes of the
League of Nations.
If we had time we were also
| going to ask him if he would lead
j his life differently if he had a chance
to do it again.
