# Back to Normality
## Eating Club Heads Await Return to Farm System 
### 
Returning; men of the Eating Clubs aren't too happy at this moment.
They don't have any present to enjoy. They don't have any future to
look forward to definitely. They have little more than a worthwhile past
about which thev can talk of in concrete terms of fact.
VALUE UNDENTED
Before the war. when operating on the normal scale. Editing Clubs more
than proved their value in the Stanford scheme. They were basic. They
were half of the two-party "system" on the Farm.
But they are not sure they are coming back now that Stanford is re
turning from its shaken wartime set-up to normalty. For they are stopped
at first base. Accarding to Eating Club leaders, the administration has
been a trifle reticent about helping the clubs back on their feet. And il

they get past this probably tempo
rary obstacle, the clubs will face
another problem at second base,
that of housing.
The three independent clubs'
buildings condemned by univer
sity engineers have been uproot
ed and left to rot on an empty lot.
CLUBS FACE PROBLEM
Among the men who intend to
face this problem and overcome it
as soon as possible are the trustees
of the various Eating Clubs, club
men who are back on campus, and
local graduate students. All of them
are vitally interested in the return
of the clubs as a cohesive force on
the Farm.
Leon Carley, prominent Palo
Alto attorney speaking as trustee
for the El Toro club says, "We do
not need justification now: no one
will deny the importance and
value the clubs have. We need
action to get the ball rolling, to
renew Eating Clubs quickly and
with the least possible conflict
and difficulty."
GRADS WILL lIELP
Such men as Vic Lindskog, Ray
Hammet and Pete Kmetovic in the
football coaches' oflice, are eager to
help the clubs enlarge membership
and return to their prominent posi
tion. They are graduates who once
enjoyed the facilities of the clubs
and know what they have to offer
the men of Stanford who seek just
such an organization for their de
sires.
Men from the smaller clubs are
also hopeful of operating shortly.
Ray Smith, El Eigre man, points out
that unless the Eating Clubs get
started soon they will be at a tre
mendous disadvantage with the fra
ternities as a result of the Row's
head start in the membership cam
paigns.
Eating clubs, in order to start
quickly, are willing to compro
mise at any half-way point with
the administration, just so they
can get started under the condi
tion that they return to the old
independent set-up as soon as
possible.
