# Dons Blast Cardinal Nine As 14 Indians Strike Out
## 
### 
A hard-hitting University of San
Francisco baseball nine routed
Stanford's horsehiclers 11 to 1, Sat
urday afternoon at the U.S.F. dia
mond. Pitcher Con Dempsey and
center fielder Paul Schramka led
the Don attack.
Dempsey, the hurling ace for the
U.S.F. club, struck out 14 Redskins.
Nevertheless, he allowed eight safe
lies which should have been enough
to account for more than one Car
dinal tally. Schramka was the bat
ting star of the day, clouting two
home runs and a double in five
trips to the plate.
The big bat of Bob Rosburg set

the pace for the Cardinals. Ros
burg, who was just elevated to the
starting nine last week, accounted
ior three Stanford safeties, one of
which was a two-bagger.
