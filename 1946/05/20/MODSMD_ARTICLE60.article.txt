# Oldest Hurler Hits Sad Day
## 
### 
NEW YORK, May 19 (UP).â€”lt
was pitchers' clay in the majors to
day, but not for 46-year-old Theo
dore Amur Lyons of the Chicago
White Sox. the oldest and saddest
player now in a big league uni
form.
There was great hurling in both
circuits. Spud Chandler of the
Yankees, Dave (Boo) Ferris of
the Red Sox. Ed Ilcusser of the
Reds, and Harry Brecheen of the
Cards pitched shutout victories.
Allie Reynolds of the Indians lost
a three-hitter to Chandler after
holding the Yankees to one lone
single for eight innings. Detroit's
ace, Lefty J Sal Newhouser, John
Niggeling of the Washington Sen
ators, Charley Ruffing of the
Yankees and southpaw Fritz Os
terniueller of the Pirates were
just ahout as brilliant in holding
opponents to single runs.
WOE FOR TIIEO
But there was only woe for Ly
ons, the "old man" who came back
to the While Sox alter three years
in the Marines to become their Sun
day pitcher. He lost to the Sena
tors, 4 to 3, lor his fourth defeat
against a single victory and as in
all of the other losses, he pitched
well enough to win.
Lyons, starting and finishing his
2'.Uh straight game was beaten in
the ninth when rookie center
fielder White,v Piatt erred inop
portunely on a fly ball as Lyons
was yielding three of his nine the
Senators made.
