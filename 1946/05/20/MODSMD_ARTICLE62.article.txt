# U.S.C. Wins At Fresno
## 
### 
Stanford sent ten men to the Fres
no relays Saturday and they came
b?;ck with ten and one-quarter
points, or one and some unfigurable
fraction per man, which gave the
Farm a solid grasp on seventh place
behind such track behemoths like
USC (38 1 i), Olympic Club (37 :, i),
UCLA (!il), San Jose* St ate (25), Los
Angeles AC (25), and California
(14).
WE NEVER WON
The Indians didn't do too badly,
which is about all that can be hon
estly said for them. They didn't win
a single event, their best effort corn-

ing in the medley relay where they
placed second to the Olympic Club.
Other than that, the Indians had
to be content with a scattering of
fourth places and fourth-place ties.
In tho one-mile and two-mile re
lays, the Cards came home fourth,
while Ed Luce collared the quarter
point as a result of his high jump
ing six feet to tie with three other
contenders for fourth place.
The closest tlie Farm came to
victory was in the medley, where
the Indian quartet stayed even
with the Olympic Club and UCLA
up until the last lap, when cx-
Farmboy Mushy Girard drew
away from Frank Ganahl to cross
the line about a dozen yards in
the lead. Al Wilkins ran the 440,
A 1 Iloluhar the 8 SO, George
Grimes the three - quarter mile
and Ganahl the mile.
In the two-mile rolny the Cards
came in fourth behind the OC, USC
and Fresno Slate* with about 230
yards to go by the time the Olym
pians had finished. Holubar, Gan
ahl, Bob Iverson and Grimes com
posed the Farm entry.
Ill:LAY DOES BETTER
The mile relay team didn't do
quite so badly in the piece de re
sistance, even if they did come
home fourth behind UCLA, USC
and LA AC by about 20 yards be
hind the Bruins. Ted Ofi, Dick
Hinzc, Iverson and Wilkins did the
Farm's running.


FRANK GANAHL . . . top dis
tance man on the Farm track
squad, anchored the medley re
lay team at the Fresno Relays
Saturday to second place behind
the Olympic Club.
