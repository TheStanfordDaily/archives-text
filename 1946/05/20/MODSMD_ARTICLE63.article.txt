### SMILEY FARKAS as told to SMILEY FARKAS 
(Egad! Is thre no limit to what
that guy'll do to get his name in
the paper?)
Stanford had no football team,
for which Stanford cannot he
blamed. Stanford didn't have
much of a basketball team, for
which Stanford can't be blamed.
Stanford doesn't have much of a
baseball, track, or tennis team,
for which Stanford can't be
blamed. Also, Stanford has ex
cellent golf and swimming teams,
for which Stanford shouldn't be
blamed.
Who's to blame? Pick your own
goat. I did, and you're it.
However, this being the vertigo
tinged edition, we shall magnani
mously forgive you inasmuch as the
age-old cry of "Wait till next year"
has at last caught up with us and
next year is upon us.
Comes fall quarter, and Stanford
will have a football team, etc. What
kind of a team? Well, now, we're
not that good to pick 'em from this
distance. Don't forget what hap
pened to basketball, baseball, track,
et al., when they returned to the

Farm this year. Whatever it was.
it wasn't good, at least not for the
first season.
The other sports, however,
should be closer to prewar stand
ards and—unless the front oflice
heaves another wrench into the
works—the Farm may be able to
move out of the cellar and away
from the designation of the Coast's
"weak sister."
Actually, as far as what kind of
teams we will have next year is
concerned, it's still anybody's guess,
but it is fairly obvious that they are
bound to improve, that being the
only direction they can go, unless
they stand still.
And that's where you come in,
dear reader (both of youse). Your
support of these outfits has been
lousy. We know, Stanford won't
support a loser. Ever stop to figure
out how easy it is to climb on a
winner's bandwagon?
Like we said, we'll forgive you
this time, knowing as we do that
a mediocre athletic contest can't
compete with a tireless fireside.
But you'd better mend your ways,
ere Stanford's athletic program
makes Chicago look like one of
the Big Ten.

works—the Farm may be able to
move out of the cellar and away
from the designation of the Coast's
"weak sister."
Actually, as far as what kind of
teams we will have next year is
concerned, it's still anybody's guess,
but it is fairly obvious that they are
bound to improve, that being the
only direction they can go, unless
they stand still.
And that's where you come in,
dear reader (both of youse). Your
support of these outfits has been
lousy. We know, Stanford won't
support a loser. Ever stop to figure
out how easy it is to climb on a
winner's bandwagon?
Like we said, we'll forgive you
this time, knowing as we do that
a mediocre athletic contest can't
compete with a tireless fireside.
But you'd better mend your ways,
ere Stanford's athletic program
makes Chicago look like one of
the Big Ten.

Stanford had no football team,
for which Stanford cannot he
blamed. Stanford didn't have
much of a basketball team, for
which Stanford can't be blamed.
Stanford doesn't have much of a
baseball, track, or tennis team,
for which Stanford can't be
blamed. Also, Stanford has ex
cellent golf and swimming teams,
for which Stanford shouldn't be
blamed.
Who's to blame? Pick your own
goat. I did, and you're it.
However, this being the vertigo
tinged edition, we shall magnani
mously forgive you inasmuch as the
age-old cry of "Wait till next year"
has at last caught up with us and
next year is upon us.
Comes fall quarter, and Stanford
will have a football team, etc. What
kind of a team? Well, now, we're
not that good to pick 'em from this
distance. Don't forget what hap
pened to basketball, baseball, track,
et al., when they returned to the

Farm this year. Whatever it was.
it wasn't good, at least not for the
first season.
The other sports, however,
should be closer to prewar stand
ards and—unless the front oflice
heaves another wrench into the
works—the Farm may be able to
move out of the cellar and away
from the designation of the Coast's
"weak sister."
