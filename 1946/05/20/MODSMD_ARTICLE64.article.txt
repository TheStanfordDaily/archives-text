# Troy Defeats Tennis Team
## 
### 
Southern California's tennis team
defeated the Stanford net squad by
a score of 7 to 2 on the local courts
last Friday even though they were
minus the services of their two best
players, the Falkenberg brothers.
For a while it looked like Stan
ford might pull the match out. The
first two clashes that finished were
both won by Stanford, and the two
in progress had Stanford men lead
ing. But, needless to say, both of
these matches were lost and so were
all the doubles.
Outstanding for Stanford, as us
ual was Arnie Beisser, who hadn't
eaten for 24 hours. Playing after a
medical experiment, Beisser took
Perez of S.C. after momentarily
weakening in the second set.
Bob Rutledge raced through Shea
of S.C. in two sets, but then Stan
ford's winning ways came to an
end. Dave Basham, playing the
hard-hitting Rodman of Troy, came
from behind only to lose when his
opponent put on a late game surge
of power.
Ross Hughes had his opponent at
game, set, and match point, but
failed to keep his service. He then
went down to the steadier S.C. man.
The doubles matches were the
same way. For a while Stanford
looked good. But the local netters
fell down in the clutches too often
to threaten the Trojan combina
tions seriously.
