# War Documents from All Over World Are Now Pouring into Hoover Library
## 
### 
The far-flung offices of the Hoover
Library on War, Revolution and
Peace are opening up again. Mate
rials collected during the war are
just now beginning to filter back to
the United States, announces Dr.
Harold Henry Fisher, the library's
director.
The Hoover Library has men in
key places collecting data on war
time governments, including ac
tivities of the various underground
movements on the Continent and
in the Far Fast. To the Stanford
campus, focal point for the world
set-up, are coming collections of
rare documents and periodicals
portraying evolution of war and
peace. Documented evidence will
tell both sides of the storyâ€”the
point of view of the conquered
and conquerors alike.
STANFORD FOCAL POINT
Witli recent announcements of
new and valuable documents being
compiled in the library's Tokio of
fice, attention was pointed at Stan
ford, site of the only institution
dealing solely in the collection of
data on war, peace and revolution.
Inside the 280-foot tower are ten

stack-levels that tell the story of
j conflict and tranquility in almost
unbelievable detail.
TOKIO OFFICE IS OPEN
In Tokio, the Hoover Library
maintains an office under the di
rection of Colonel Hubert Shcnck,
I Stanford geology professor, and
now head of the Natural Rc
i sources section of General Mac-
Arthur's stalf. Also in the Tokio
office is Dr. John Masland.
While the Hoover Library main
l tains its own overseas offices in
some key countries, most of its ma-
I terials come from private and com
mercial collectors and from commit
tees set up to screen materials for
the Library.
PARIS SHIPS 1.000 PERIODICALS
Mr. Louis Chevrillon organized
the Paris office immediately after
I the German evacuation. While ship
ments from other world offices are
slew in reaching the United States,
ihc Paris office has shipped collec
tions of 100 underground and Vichi
periodicals; more are on the way.
One of the library's Paris agents,
j Hafner, sent out 1.0000 newspapers
I and pamphlets published during
j German occupation.
As the Germans fled the Neth
erlands. Mr. HijholY, Hoover Li
brary representative in Holland,
j started research which has led to
the acquisition of important Ger
man propaganda archives; these
have not been shipped from Eu
rope. For Belgium have come
other archives, some from under
ground sources.
COMB WORLD FOR DATA
Across the continent, from Russia
to the Far East, agents and rcpre-
I sentntives of the Hoover Library are
i combing war records and files in an
| effort to make the Stanford library
l the site of the greatest concentra
tion of war and peace literature on
earth.
In Italy Charles Delzell, ex-Stan
ford MA, is a special representa
tive. Dr. John Brown Mason, visit
ing professor of Stanford's Political

i Science Department, is in Austria,
! compiling data there. Even Bagh
dad is not without its Hoover Li
' brary agent.
LIBAIIY READY FOR WAR
When war came, the Hoover Li
| brary was ready. In 1939 Library
representatives went abroad, visit
| ed many European contacts, and
! made plans for carrying on collec
[ lions if war came and communica
-1 tions faded. When war did come
all library officials could do was to
j sit, back and hope that work was
continuing. "Now," says Dr. Fisher,
j "letters are corning in from all over
J Europe; our contacts are cropping
{ up again. Most of them survived
the war and have material for us."
HOOVER LIBE KNOWN ABROAD
Around the world, wherever
there arc hook agencies and re
! searchers, the name of the Stan
! ford Library on War. Revolution,
I and Peace is known.
And what about the future? The
: Hoover f,ibrr>ry is looking toward
the fulfillment of its plan to house
! the world's most complete history
j of. political and social evolution of
the modern world. And Library of
! fices, agents, and representatives
around the world are carrying out
that plan.
