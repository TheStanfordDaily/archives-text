'"Dragonwyck" is another Twen
tieth Century Fox million - dollar
production picture, and judging the
finished product by the possibilities,
it fails. Basically it is the sordid
love story of an aristocratic patroon
of the 1840's (Vincent Price), who
lures a naive country lass (Gene
Tierney) to his forbidding, me
dieval castle high above the Hudson
River.
Price, the egotistical, cruel lord of
the manor, is undoubtedly the most
impressive figure in the picture.
Price, who is one of Hollywood's
and Broadway's best, has lately
been receiving much better roles in
which to demonstrate his histrionic
superbness, and this lives up to his
previous achievements He towers
over Gene not only in height, but
also in his acting ability. Miss Tier
ney merely parades across the screen
displaying her beautiful—wardrobe.
Many things were overlooked in
Ibis picture that would have led to
a much better cinema. The
man or maybe the director did not
use the unusual setting to its full
advantage. Many camera angles and
tricks would have intensified the
dramatic effect desired, and the full
worth of Walter Huston as a great
dramatic actor was not brought out.
Nevertheless, this picture will
drag in millions at the box-office,
because everything does these
days.
