# Tired of Radio Commercials, 'Hucksters' Satires Advertising
## 
### BOB BULLOCK 
'THE HUCKSTERS," by Frederick
Wakeman.
Have you ever been driven slight
ly daft by the incessant repetition
of a radio commercial? Don't worry,
it's just a natural reaction to the
airlane's advertising technique.
"Rinso White!" and "L.S.M.F.T."
have caused more gripes among the
American listening audience than
any other innovation.
Well, author Frederic Wake
man, proud, "papa" of last year's
sensational best seller "Shore
Leave," returns to the literary
world to expose "behind-the
scenes" life of radio advertising
in "The Hucksters." In doing so,
he has on his hands another
"blessed event" which will no
doubt have book addicts arguing
for many months.
JUNE BOOK OF THE MONTH
Whether the current Wakeman
opus ranks as a literary work is
definitely questionable. At any rate,
Book of the Month Club has begun
a campaign to draw customers'
shecklcs for it as June selection.
The United States book worm of
19 Hi seems to have a rather omin
ous taste for a hit of "Billy-Whiz-
Bang" in his modern novel. As a
result, artistic drivel such as Mes
damcs Amber and Kitty have sky
rocketed to break new book-sales
records only due to a large help
ing of boudoir banter. "The Huck
sters" could very easily run off
with the prize in this year's bed
room sweepstakes.
SHADES OF "THE OUTLAW"
All squeamish Puritans are here
by warned to avoid Mr. Wakcman's
work and instead to spend their time
perusing "Alice in Wonderland." In
fact if the P.-T.A. registered shock
at the frank frivolity of "Shore
Leave," the Bay City police may
have to close down Paul Elders.
(That's a bookstore, son!)
So help me, there is actually a
plot to fill in the cooler portions
of the narrative. For after an op
ening passage of amor, the reader
is introduced to our hero, Vic
Norman, an advertising account
executive who blasphemes and
loves all over the place in the
best (?) Hollywood tough-guy
tradition. Come to think of it, the
flickers will no doubt get a big
bang out of slipping this story past
the Johnson office.
ROOT OF ALL EVIL
A fugitive from 0.W.1, reconver
sion, Vic shoulders his way into a
juicy radio advertising job only to
discover that he's caught in a maze
of "yes-men," catering to Evan
Llewelyn Evans of the Beautee
Soap account. Said patriarch Evans
drives everyone in the book crazy
with his obnoxious lordly manner
isms, but he holds the purse-strings
and therefore commands a slave
like respect.
Chief plot problems concern the
agency's attempt to pacify Old
Man Evans and still produce a
high Hooper rating for the Beau
tee Soap show. The battle finally
evolves into Vic's fight to defeat
the Old Man's staid methods. A
surprise climax finds the younger
generation conceding to the pow
erful curmudgeon due to the in
fluence of filthy lucre.
IT'S LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!
Meanwhile our boy Vic manages
Ijf keep the "Amber" faction happy
by mixing pleasure with business

| to the tune of four (count 'em) love
j ly damsels. Finally his lighthearted
i escapades run afoul of "love" for
J Kay Dorrance, described as the In
grid Bergman type. Which is ok; y
by me any day.
Only difficulty in the "love'
deal is that Kay's monicker in
cludes a Mrs. prefix, and to com
plicate matters Mr. I), is over
seas. Being an upright, conscien
tious 4F, Vic can't quite see him
self depriving (J.I. Dorrance of his
homecoming. So amid a chorus of
the "Star Spangled Banner" and
a great deal of Hag waving, our
Hero gives up his true "Love"
and trots o(T to the blood bank.
WITTY DIALOGUE
Seriously though, "The Huck
| sters" boasts some of the wittiest
\ dialogue heard outside of the Daily
i Shack. Readers will long remember
: some of the amazing characters thai
flash across the pages. Vic's happy
. go-lucky statement that "It's only
; money" might easily catch on with
public favor.
Mr. Wakeman has fashioned a de
lightful satire, so broad in fact that
1 one questions whether the people
are really fictitious. More than one
member of the radio business will
no doubt wince as the barbs from
J Wakcman's pen strike closcr to
; home. So settle down with a copy
j of "Billboard" at hand plus a sense
of humor, and you're in for an cn
! joyablc evening.
