## Campus to Assemble; No 10 a.m. Classes 
### 
Wednesday is A-Day!
The Plaec: Frost Memorial Am
phitheater.
The Time: 10 a.m. (no classes!).
The Occasion: An all - student
assembly held under Election
Board supervision, by Rally Com
and Cardinals to introduce the
record number of presidential and
vice-presidential candidates to
the voting student body of Stan
ford.
A rally atmosphere will prevail.
Song and yell sheets will be dis
tributed, and the Stanford Band
will make its first spring appear
ance.
CANDIDATES INTRODUCED
But the importance of the as
sembly will lie in the program. Each
of the aspirants for the key presi
dent's spot will be introduced and
given a few minutes to present his
ideas on how Stanford's vital prob
lems should be attacked.
Vice-presidential and, if time al
lows, graduate members at large
nominees will be presented.
Voters will be given a chance
to look at, and hear, the men and
women they must choose between
, to run their affairs in the coming
j year, only at the amphitheater
Wednesday. This Thursday, May
2.'5, is E-Day, Election Day, which
means that there isn't much time
left.
Preferential voting will be used
j Thursday. This means that besides
i the first choice, the voter will be
allowed to pick a second and third
choice. With so many candidates
this makes second and third choices
very important. For after the first
count if there is no majority of first
place votes for any one candidate
the bottom name on the list will be
dropped. The second choices of this
candidate will be tallied and added
to the other names. This process
will continue until one candidate
] has gained a majority of votes.
ELECTION WORKERS
Responsible for display signs in
front of the Union giving positions
J and lists of candidates are Betty Jo
Fitger and Pat Hamblin of Election
Board.
Any electioneering within 50 feet
of the polls on Election Day will
constitute a violation of the honor
code. There is little need of warn
ing Stanford students how impor
tant this is!
