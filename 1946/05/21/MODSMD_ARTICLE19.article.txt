# Housing Poll Indicates Women's Approval Of Housing Program; Row Disagrees on Issue
## 
### 
Out of (500 Housing Polls, 411 gave
approval of the general housing plan
and indicated it would be satisfac
tory in the long run, Helen Dietz
and Ann Shimmel, Housing Com
mittee members, announced in
Women's Conference yesterday.
Eighty-six disapproved of the
plan, some of just specific points.
Seventy out of 1H polls from the
Row indicated that living groups
should have some choice as to
who moves in. Fifteen felt that
this system could fit into the pres
ent plan, and 55 said that it
couldn't.
Another criticism of the plan was
that it kept girls from moving in
groups, Miss Shimmel said. Ap
proval of drawing by lot was 427 out.
of 523. Of the 8(5 who disapproved,
many offered suggestions, such as
drawing a number before listing
choices, having a waiting list for
girls who continually draw high
numbers, and qiving girls who re
turn to the University after a quar
ter's absence, preference in their
former living group.
SOME I>ISSATISFACIION
The greatest dissatisfaction with
the plan. Miss Dietz said, is with
the social program for freshmen
and transfers. Many felt that new
students arc more concerned with
the house than with the girls in the
house and that congeniality is dis
appearing.
The social functions are of lit
tle interest. Miss Dietz continued,
and they therefore have little at-

tendance. Suggestions on the polls |
were for more informal enter- |
tainment and being able (o visit
bouses at any time rather than
on specific occasions. Women j
should not be unenthusiastic in ]
explaining the assets of their liv
ing groups.
On Ihc question of where trans
, fcrs should be placed. ."18 favored
having them placed throughout the
j University and 175 placing them in j
one living group. Out of 16 Ven- j
: tura polls, 34 favored having trans
fers all together.
EQUALIZATION
Other suggestions were for hav- j
ing living groups equalized in their J
; physical set-ups, a suggestion that !
j come mainly from Union Unit houses J
and having the sponsors educate
| the new girls on the various types ;
( of living groups and help the girls i
' get acquainted. Housing Commit
j tee feels that the main fault of the j
j present system is that girls don't j
know cach other very well and it [
is hard to obtain congeniality. Miss !
Dietz said. "Girls should not move j
into a house feeling that it. is only
a temporary arrangement; they [
should contribute something to the ;
group."
Allison Dice was appointed
Women's Conference treasurer.
She will take olTicc in the fall and
serve all next year.
The questions on ratio and class
preference were ruled out as most
j girls did not understand that the
- two were incompatible and an- j
i swered "yes" or "no" to both of i

them. The polls, conclusions, and
trends will be filed for future ref
erence by the committee.
Carol Newton, Conference treas
urer, reported that approximately
$413.(50 was netted from the jolly
up, circus night, and fashion show.
Conference decided to Rive a $400
scholarship to some needy girl for
next year.
