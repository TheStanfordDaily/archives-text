## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 20 (UP).—A. F. Whitney, president of the Broth
erhood of Railroad Trainmen, said tonight that his union and the Brother
hood of Locomotive Engineers have mad*: a "new proposal" to the rail
roads.
He declined to discuss the details but said it had been given to the rail-

roads early today by Presidential
Labor Adviser John R. Steelman.
President Truman, returning
here from his flying visit to Lib
erty, Mo., meanwhile dismissed
with a curt "Never heard of it"
an earlier statement by Whitney
and Alvanley Johnston, head of
the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers, that he had given them
assurance of a wage increase
higher than that recommended
by his own fact-finding board.
Whitney and Johnston had told
reporters the President's promise
alone had prompted them to post
pone the nationwide strike until
pone the nationwide strike until
next Thursday. It was on that basis,
they said, that they offered to re
open negotiations with manage
ment.
They made the new announce
ment following a 90-minute con
ference with Steelman. They said
"some progress" had been made to
ward a settlement and that they
were ready to meet with manage
ment representatives "at any time."
The carriers' wage committee for
two hours late this afternoon. A
spokesman reported that "some
progress — but not too much — was
made."
He refused to disclose what was
discussed or to comment on Whit
ney's report of a "new proposal."

WASHINGTON, May 20 (UP).—
All efforts to reopen the soft coal
wage negotiations appeared to have
bogged down tonight and a govern
ment. official predicted that the
mines would be seized by mid-week
to avert another strike at the ex
piration of the present two-week
truce Saturday.
With White House attention fo
cused on the railroad strike threat,
observers believed President Tru
man would withhold action on the
coal dispute for another two or
three days, giving the conferees a
last chance to reach agreement.
White House Secretary Eben
Ayers said that as far as he knew
the President had no intention of
taking over the nation's 3,000 soft
coal mines "imminently."
But under the truce ordered by
Lewis after the mines had been idle
for six weeks, another shutdown is
due at midnight Saturday if no set
tlement is reached by that time.
And a government official close to
the situation said flatly that Mr.
Truman would seize the mines to
prevent that occurrence.
