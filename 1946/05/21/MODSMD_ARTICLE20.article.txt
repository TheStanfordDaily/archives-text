# Knock It Off
## 
### 
Okay, we've had our fun. Cal kids (pre
sumably) came down to the Farm Sunday
night and did a thorough job of painting on
the Hoover War Libe a nice brilliant yellow
"C-A-L." And Stanford kids (presumably)
went up to Cal over the weekend to dump oil
and crankcase grease on the "C," following
it up by adding a sprinkling of eucalyptus
leaves.
All very funny—for the kids. Because that's
what they are. We came to college and
we're sure most Cal students came to college

—to act like adults and to be treated like
adults. However, some of our actions don't
sem to be jibing with this premise.
Sure, we know the Axe has been stolen.
We'd like to think Cal students did it (that old
school rivalry again), but we don't know. And
until we do find out who took it, all these
reprisals and counter-reprisals strike us as
being futile, boring, arid stupid and high
schoolish.
We think school spirit is fine, but not when
it becomes an excuse for vandalism.—M.S.
