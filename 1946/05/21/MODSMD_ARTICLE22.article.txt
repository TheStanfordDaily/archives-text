# Salutations, '49-ers

### 
Six pages was a big job for the freshmen of
the Daily to take on, but they did it yester
day and turned out an over-size Frosh Edi
tion, 1946 brand.
From a veritable deluge of fake stories, at
tempted raid on the cloistered Daily Shack,
and spontaneous combustion of the noives,

the Frosh emerged practically unscathed with
a product that showed sweat and forethought.
Sure, there were errors and a couple of
minor butches. But for imagination and a
determined faith in the future that's good to
hear about, we hand it to the Frosh. Hang
on to that faith and you can't lose.
