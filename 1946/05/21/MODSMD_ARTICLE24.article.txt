To the Editor:
The problem of adjusting the campus to a
peacetime program has raised issues that candi
dates must take a firm stand on.

However, the Stanford I knew and wish to
represent had no place for political ballyhoo. Per
sonally, I believe the time and place for (he pres
entation of answers to the issues now before the
University is at the election assembly Wednesday
morning at 10. There, each candidate can be fairly
judged for the merits of his program by all the
students.
Because a candidate declines to present his pro
gram in a preliminary "stump speech" does not in
dicate a lack of sincerity of interest or of a program.
