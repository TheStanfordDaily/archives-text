To the Editor:
An incident occurred at the meeting *>112 Excom
Wednesday night which concerns every Stanford
student who has faith in democratic student gov
ernment.
Permission was granted for the Student Commit
tee for World Federation to carry on its activities
on the campus providing it did not join the national
student, organization Student Federalists.
The issue is greater than simply (he right of a
campus group to join with similar groups in Yale,
Columbia, Wellesley, and others to form an associa
tion which lias no other objective than working for
One World.
The issue is whether your student representa
tives can change their policies with the weather,
one week chartering the AVC, a recognized na
tional veterans' pressure group, and another week
denying permission for a campus group to join an
organization which is recognized by the United
States government as solely educational.
Are student affairs run through the caprices of
a few Excom members or by the wishes of the
students of Stanford?
