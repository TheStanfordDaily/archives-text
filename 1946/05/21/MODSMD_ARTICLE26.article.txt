### BILL STEIF 
Five of us were sitting around a kitchen table
about 1:30 o'clock the other morning shoting the
breeze about the "sassiety" sections of the various
San Francisco papers and making the usual caustic
remarks reserved, so it would seem, for the young.
We had just finished a large early morning supper
of scrambled eggs, toast and coffee and were all
feeling pretty mellow. Then someone remarked
upon a crust of bread left on one of the plates.
Someone else said something about a speech
ex-President Herbert Hoover had made the night
before.
And someone else said that Life magazine's pic
tures of a starving 15-year-old Chinese beggar
}<ir 1 were graphic to the point of being revolting.
You can easily see what all this led up to. We
started talking about hungry people (if you have
heard too much about hungry people already you
can stop right here). »
A young man for whom we have a good deal
of respect said that he thought Mr. Hoover's
speech didn't humanize this whole business of
starvation enough. He thought that Mr. Hoover,
instead of merely saying that '.£OO out of every
1,000 babies born in Europe lodav die because of
their mothers' malnutrition, should have stated
that two out of every ten babies born in Am
sterdam or Reims or Warsaw or Milan or Bres
lau die at birth because the mothers—women
just like the women we know—haven't had
enough bread and enough eggs and enough milk
and enough meat throughout pregnancy to ke«'p
themselves and their babies alive.
This young chap, a soggy, old "veteran" like a
lot of men on and around campus, believed that
Mr. Hoover should have dramatized his speech in
order to get his points across. We wondered how
the facts of starvation can be dramatized. We won
dered how many people in the United States and

in California and at Stanford actually know what
it means to starve. We wondered how a situation
which means nothing by actual experience to most
persons- in the United States can be made into
drama. Wo were afraid that drama interests most
people only when those people can find something
similar to their own experience in the drama. But
we were not sure because we really know so little
about both drama and starvation. And so we kept
our largish mouth closed.
Then a girl seized the conversation. She said
she thought Mr. Hoover's point about not being
able to expect any type of stable democracy any
wh"re until the time that men have enough to eat
was very well laken.
We thought so, too.
We think that the first thing men and women
worry about in all of life is getting enough to
eat. We think men and women turn to revolu
tion only when (here is not enough to eat and
we think that only when (he great majority of
people in any nation get sufficient food do they
allow themselves the luxury of freedom. We
used to think pretty well in reverse of what we
iust said—we used to think that men treasure
ideals above all else in life—but we suspect that
we were wrong. We suspect that a man's stomach
weighs more than his ideals. It's pretty hard to
chase will-o'-the-wisps when you know you
haven't got the strength to reach up and tag one.
Mr. Hoover's idea that men and women must
have security before we can expect them to ring
liberty bells is pretty solid, wo think. 01 course,
Karl Marx had much the same idea.
Well, the five of us handled this food business
over th? remnants of eggs and toast for a while
and then the quintet drifted into a brief war story
or two. Naturally, we pulled out.
There were dirty dishes to do, anyway.
