A 1 Gilliland opened his campaign
for student body president last night
in two short speeches before the
women of Branner and Lagunita.
Gilliland urged members of the stu
dent body to attend the assembly
May 22, when he plans to unfold his
campaign platform-â€”and above all
to vote Thursday.
"Second and third votes will be
the deciding factors at the final
counting of the ballots," said Gil
liland during his short appear
ance at the Branner dining hall.
He emphasized the preferential
system of voting.
At the Lagunita Casa meeting
later in the evening he pointed out
that he did not wish to make any
definite statment at this time on
his campaign stands. "But," he said,
"there are many vital issues at
stake and I will make my stands
clear at the Amphitheater on
Wednesday."
His parting remark was a plea
for every members of the student
body to vote, and vote carefully.
