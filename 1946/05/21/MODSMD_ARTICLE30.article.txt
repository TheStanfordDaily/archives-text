# Strong Leadership Urged by McCall
## 
### 
Outlining three points of his 12-
point campaigning platform, Wally
McCall opened his presidential cam
paign before the women of Branner
and Lagunita in short speeches be
fore their house meetings last night.
"We are at the crossroads of
student government here at Stan
ford," said McCall. lie empha
sized that unless we have a strong
government next year, we will
never get another chance to keep
our position as leader of free po
litical expression. He pointed out
that Stanford was one of the first
universities on the coast to start
the unrestricted type of govern
ment and that we have long main
tained a leading position.
His three points, on which he
demanded definite action next year,
were the housing situation, the ath
letic problem, and the opening of
student activities to all members of
the student body.
"A survey of housing in the Stan
ford-Paid Alto district would show
many more available places for
housing," he said.
"We must not antagonize, but co
ordinate all groups within the cam
pus circle for a strong Stanford in
this coming, important year," Mc-
Call concluded.
