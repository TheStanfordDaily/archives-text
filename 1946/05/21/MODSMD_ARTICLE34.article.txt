# In Case You Didn't See This-Hoover Libe Had Its Face Lifted
## 
### 
Practical jokery reached an all-time low yesterday both at Stanford
and on the campus of the University of California.
Figuring in the newest additions to what is supposed to be good
natured rivalry between the two schools were fhe Hoover War Library,
which was painted with a yellow C-A-L, and the "Big C" at Berkeley,
which got a facial of oil and crankcase drippings embellished with dirt
and eucalyptus leaves.
Stuart Clark, Stanford campus policeman, discovered the art work on
the War Library at 3:35 a.m. Monday. He had completed a routine check
of the building only 20 minutes previously and found no evidence of the
vandalism. However, 15 minutes later, he drove by, saw the paint and
apparently frightened olf the painters, who either purposely dropped,
kicked over, or turned over the remains of a gallon'can of bright yellow
paint, which spilled down over the front steps.
The paint, according to Police Chief Gordon Davis, was the same
type used to paint the "Happy New Yearâ€”Cat" on the Stanford Boat
house last February. Davis said it was the same fast-d?ying paint used
to make pedestrian and traffic lanes on the highways.
At Berkeley, the grease-covered "C" was discovered .early Saturday.
The sophomore class, which has charge of the "C," cleaned up the mess
with solvent and excelsior and in four hours had restored its regular
yellow hue.
The Daily Californian admitted that the sophomores place guards on
the "C" when in their opinion hostilities appear imminent. Apparently
those who can forecast such things were oil' the beam, for there were
no guards on duty Friday or Saturday.
Stanford Corporation Yard painters worked at removing the paint
on the library here most of the day.
