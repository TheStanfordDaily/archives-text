What happened to the movement
afoot in California to put dog-rac

j . . . Particularly in Portland, where
i the big Multnomah structure fea
| tures canine racing quite often. . . .
I And the sport should be booming
| more than ever now, with fans not
| wishing to see the hapless baseball
[ club perform and starting to turn
i to other pastimes for diversion.

i other day, supposedly sent by the
I "California Student Body." Of spe
cial interest was the part which
stated. "Anyone caught delivering
such messages will suffer severe
consequences."
What we'd like to know is just
i who in the hell is threatening who?
