# 'Paris Failure Due to Russia'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 20 (UP).â€”
Secretary of State James F. Byrnes
tonight laid upon Soviet Russia the
major blame for failure of the Paris
peace conference, and he threatened
to take the issue of peace treaties
with Germany's European satellites
to the United Nations if a formal
peace conference is not called this
summer.
In a radio report to the nation
on the Foreign Ministers' Con
ference which broke up last week
in complete disagreement, Byrnes
said he was "disappointed" but
"not discouraged" at the outcome
of the four-power parley.
He conceded that he had been
unable to win accord on any of the
major issues at stake in the peace
treaties to be signed with Italy,
Finland, Hungary, Romania, and
Bulgaria.
MOLGTOV'S ATTITUDE
For that failure, he ascribed a
major responsibility to the uncom
promising attitude of Soviet For
eign Commissar V. M. Molotov, and
he sounded a thinly veiled warning
that this government is in no mood
for further prolonged delay in the
peace-making.
Byrnes in efTect called for an
end of the veto power which the
big powers have held over the
framing of peace treaties, assert
ing that all the nations which
helped defeat the Axis are en
titled to a voice in the peace set
tlement.
"The four Allied governments
cannot indefinitely delay the mak
ing of peace with countries which
have long ceased to fight, simply
because they cannot agree among
themselves on peace treaties," he
said.
"The Council of Foreign Minis
ters was formed to facilitate and
not obstruct the making of peace."
BIG FOUR PEACE TREATY
Byrnes also raised the question of
his proposal for a Big Four 25-
year treaty to insure German dis
armament. and for a "lenient" peace
settlement with Austria.
Both, he said, were sidetracked
by the Russians after they had in
dicated willingness to go along with
the other Allies on them.
Byrnes decried the Soviet Un
ion's constantly expressed fear for
her security and warned that Mos
cow is contributing to general un
easiness by her tactics.
