# The 						Umpire's Verdict
## 
### JOHN SABIN 
The Pacific Coast League race
broke wide open last week as the
rampaging Oakland Acorns took
seven straight from Hollywood to
move into a first place tie with their
arch rivals, the San Francisco Seals.
The Oaks have been hanging
011 two 01 three games behind the
leaders all season, and just when
they were expected to take a dive.
Casey Stengel's boys swept a
seven-game series from luckless
Hollywood to gain a first place tie
with the Seals.
Pre - season dopcsters had the

, Oaks fighting it out for last place;
' even Manager Casey Stengel didn't
| give his boys a much better chance
j than the sports scribes who followed
! the Qaks around in pre - season
i training. The Acorns seem to have
| what it takes to win the close ones,
i and that is what makes a cham
pionship team.
Oakland has a well - balanced
team, but does not seem overly
strong in any department. They
have one of the best first sackers
in the league in Les Scarsella, !
who is near (he top in the league's !
batting race, and a fine shortstop
in Mickey Burnett. Their pitch- ;
ing is strong, but not the best in j
the league; the same goes for
fielding. Because they are not |
, really weak in any department. I
they stand a good chance of beat
ing out the Seals and the Angels
j in the pennant race.
i Meanwhile, the San Francisco
' Seals hung onto a tie for the lead
i ership by coming through Sunday
| in both ends of a doubleheader to
| take the series from Los Angeles
1 four games to three. Bill Sweeney's
Los Angeles team dropped to two
and a half games behind the lead
ers. During the week they momen
tarily took over first place (after
; Friday's game), but lost the last
] three games to the much-alarmed
| Seals, who have, until this week,
j led the league all season.

j If you have a few old copies of

j sports staff's major league predic
tions. Now take a look at the
j standings. The first division in
! the American League stands ex
j actly as we (Art Levinson. Bob
Peck, Al Sciaroni, and this writ
er) picked 'em: Boston. New
York, Detroit, and Washington.

The Pacific Coast League race
broke wide open last week as the
rampaging Oakland Acorns took
seven straight from Hollywood to
move into a first place tie with their
arch rivals, the San Francisco Seals.
The Oaks have been hanging
011 two 01 three games behind the
leaders all season, and just when
they were expected to take a dive.
Casey Stengel's boys swept a
seven-game series from luckless
Hollywood to gain a first place tie
with the Seals.
Pre - season dopcsters had the

, Oaks fighting it out for last place;
' even Manager Casey Stengel didn't
| give his boys a much better chance
j than the sports scribes who followed
! the Qaks around in pre - season
i training. The Acorns seem to have
| what it takes to win the close ones,
i and that is what makes a cham
pionship team.
Oakland has a well - balanced
team, but does not seem overly
strong in any department. They
have one of the best first sackers
in the league in Les Scarsella, !
who is near (he top in the league's !
batting race, and a fine shortstop
in Mickey Burnett. Their pitch- ;
ing is strong, but not the best in j
the league; the same goes for
fielding. Because they are not |
, really weak in any department. I
they stand a good chance of beat
ing out the Seals and the Angels
j in the pennant race.
