# Seals and Acorns Face New Series
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. May 20 (UP).
â€”The Oakland Acorns and the San
Francisco Seals, current pacesetters
of the Pacific Coast League by two
and a half games, were en route to
night to their next battle scenes
with every indication that stalemate
would be broken before this week's
series are completed.
The mighty Oaks, who came
through fast along (he rail last
week to sweep a seven - game
series from the Hollywood Stars,
invade the home diamond of the
last-place Portland Beavers. Man
ager Casey Stengel's charges
must maintain at least an even
pace with (he Seals, who will he
host to San Diego's Padres, or
drop from the league leaders'
chair.
What holds true for Oakland also
holds true for San Francisco. The
Seals will not be getting easy pick
ings in the hustling Padres with
Manager John (Pepper) Martin at
their helm.
In the other series. Los Angeles,
who held first place for less than
21 hours, plays at Hollywood and
Sacramento journeys to Seattle to
engage the Rainiers. Both the
Sacs and Suds are presently tied
for six position.
Time is fast running out for all
managers before they must prune
their squads for the long summer
battles. The next two weeks are
expected to decide (he fate for many
old and young players now work
ing to win a regular spot on one of
the eight PCL clubs.
