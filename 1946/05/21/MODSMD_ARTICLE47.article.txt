: Yankees at their own specialty to

It was an afternoon for the long
i distance hitters as the teams
1 switched the locale of the game to
tiny League Park, weekday home
of the Cleveland club. The change
| of pasture from spacious downtown
| Municipal Stadium was a tonic to
| Nick Etten. slumping Yankee first

ers. Bill Dickey got the third
i round - trip plate -to - plate ticket
j when he delivered one out of the
j »park in the ninth.

York. It dropped New York five
games behind the idle first-place
Boston Red Sox.

the Washington Senators won their
third straight at Chicago, topping
the White Sox, 10 to 2. Every man
in the Washington lineup, including
\ pitcher Emil Leonard, hit safely at
| least once. Leonard was tagged for
| 11 hits, including homers by Taft

Cincinnati at Brooklyn and Chi
i cago at Boston in the National were
1 night games. No other games were
