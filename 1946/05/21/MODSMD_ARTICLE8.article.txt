# Ku Klux Klan Rides on USC Campus; Slate Investigates
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, May 20 (UP). —A cross was burned and the letters
'K K K" scrawled on a Jewish fraternity house yesterday as police hunted
the vandals who destroyed a sacred scroll and penciled two swastikas in
a Hollywood synagogue.
The incidents were the latest in a series of race prejudice outbursts
that prompted state investigation last month of a reported Southern
California Ku Klux Klan revival.
Stanley Schlessingor, a member of Zeta Beta Tau social fraternity at
the University of Southern California, discovered the flaming cross on the
fraternity house lawn at 2:15 a.m. The letters "K KK" were painted in
black on the front of the house and etched in the grass with kerosene.
Police thought the fraternity incident might have been a prank but
did not discount the possibility it was Klan-inspired.
Fraternity President Al Kotlcr said neither he nor his fraternity
brothers "knew of any organized group or individual students on the
U.S.C. campus who would execute such an act."
All fraternities and sororities on the campus called a meeting to discuss
the incident.
Attorney General's and District Attorney's investigators attended the
session, at which a student committee was formed to prevent recurrence
of such activities, with faculty advice if necessary.
The cross-burning occurred as police investigated the report of Rahhi
Max Ni'ssba'nn that vandals tore a sacred Hebrew Torah scroll from
its ark at Temple Israel, rinped it to pieces, drew swastikas, and scrawled
on the wall the German words, "Dcr Judcn Parasite" (the Jewish para
site).
The Hollywood synagogue, Nussbaum said, is never locked.
The scroll, handwritten on rare parchment, was the last Torah to leave
Berlin, said the rabbi, who smuggled it out in 1938 under the noses of
the Nazis.
"I brought the scroll fi.ooo miles to a free country to have this hap
pen." he said. "It is not the defacing that worries me. It is the motive
behind such action, the twisted thinking (hat prompts defacing of a
church's sacred property."
During the weekend, firemen also quelled a fire started by a cross
burning in a field in North Los Angeles, and last week the city council
was asked to investigate a cross-burning on the lawn of Mr. and Mrs.
H. G. Hickerson, Negro couple fighting real estate race restrictions in
their section of the city. ,

LOS ANGELES, May 20 (UP). —A cross was burned and the letters
'K K K" scrawled on a Jewish fraternity house yesterday as police hunted
the vandals who destroyed a sacred scroll and penciled two swastikas in
a Hollywood synagogue.
The incidents were the latest in a series of race prejudice outbursts
that prompted state investigation last month of a reported Southern
California Ku Klux Klan revival.
Stanley Schlessingor, a member of Zeta Beta Tau social fraternity at
the University of Southern California, discovered the flaming cross on the
fraternity house lawn at 2:15 a.m. The letters "K KK" were painted in
black on the front of the house and etched in the grass with kerosene.
Police thought the fraternity incident might have been a prank but
did not discount the possibility it was Klan-inspired.
Fraternity President Al Kotlcr said neither he nor his fraternity
brothers "knew of any organized group or individual students on the
U.S.C. campus who would execute such an act."
All fraternities and sororities on the campus called a meeting to discuss
the incident.
Attorney General's and District Attorney's investigators attended the
session, at which a student committee was formed to prevent recurrence
of such activities, with faculty advice if necessary.
The cross-burning occurred as police investigated the report of Rahhi
Max Ni'ssba'nn that vandals tore a sacred Hebrew Torah scroll from
its ark at Temple Israel, rinped it to pieces, drew swastikas, and scrawled
on the wall the German words, "Dcr Judcn Parasite" (the Jewish para
site).
The Hollywood synagogue, Nussbaum said, is never locked.
The scroll, handwritten on rare parchment, was the last Torah to leave
Berlin, said the rabbi, who smuggled it out in 1938 under the noses of
the Nazis.
"I brought the scroll fi.ooo miles to a free country to have this hap
pen." he said. "It is not the defacing that worries me. It is the motive
behind such action, the twisted thinking (hat prompts defacing of a
church's sacred property."

burning in a field in North Los Angeles, and last week the city council
was asked to investigate a cross-burning on the lawn of Mr. and Mrs.
