# Government Seizes 3,000 Coal Mines
## Coal Strike Still Possible for U.S. In Spite of Move 
### 
WASHINGTON, Wednesday, I
May 22 (UP). â€”The government I
took over the nation's 3,000 soft
coal mines early today in an
attempt to forestall a renewal of
John L. Lewis' crippling strike, ;
but there was no assurance the
miners will stay on the job.
President Truman ordered the !
seizure to "preserve the national j
economic structure in the present. 1
cmergcncy" and his aides appealed j
to Lewis for his cooperation.
But the UMW boss refused to
commit himself. Dc declined to
say whether or not he would or
der the 400,000 members of his j
union to remain in the pits.
Secretary of the Interior J. A.
Krug was named by the President j
as administrator of the mines and |
immediately appointed Vice Adm.
Ben Moreell to take charge of their
operations. U. S. Army troops were j
placed at Moreell's disposal to pre
serve order, if necessary.
Krug and Lewis conferred pri- j
vate for almost two hours last j
night prior to the seizure dead
line. The new mine boss, how- j
ever, was unable to wring' a defi- j
nitc commitment from Lewis that J
he would keep his miners at work.
"We requested his support," Krug j
lolti reporters. "He has that under !
consideration." I
