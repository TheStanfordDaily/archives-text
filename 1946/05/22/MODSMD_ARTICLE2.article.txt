He made his statement after conferring with Presidential Adviser John

R. Steclman, who spent the day in
conference with carrier representa
of the Brotherhood of Railroad
Trainmen, and Alvanley Johnston,
head of the engineers' union.
"Steclman consulted both sides
all day—either by telephone or in
person—with no conclusive results,"
Ross said. "There just isn't any
thing to say about it. No develop
ments are expected overnight, ei
ther."
He added that Steelman will con

Whitney and Johnston had no
comment. They met with Steclman
for 90 minutes just prior to his

a settlement formula was under
consideration and told reporters to
draw their own conclusions.
