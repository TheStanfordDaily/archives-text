# The 						Preferential Count

### 
(We reprint by request an editorial, first
published in 1944, which gives the back
ground of the preferential system of voting.)
Don't vote carelessly tomorrow, just pay
ing attention to your first choices and then
marking the rest of the ballot diagonally or
because you like the sound of a certain can
didate's name. This morning's paper gives
you the names of all those in the running.
Ask your friends about the persons you don't
know and this morning at the assembly
take a good look.
Why all this trouble? Because your sec
ond, third, and fourth, etc. choices can pack
as big a wallop as your first. Here's how the
preferential is counted:
First-choice votes are counted and tallied,
and the ballots are arranged in piles so that
each pile contains the first choice ballots of a
single candidate
Jf no candidate receives a majority of first
choices, the one receiving the lowest number
of first choices is dropped from the voting list
and the votes credited to him and scratched
from the tally sheet.
The second-choice votes on the ballots of

this candidate are counted and the ballots
placed in the piles of those receiving these
second choices. These are tallied and count
ed and the candidate having a majority of the
total votes cast is the winner.
If still a majority has not been reached, the
candidate with the lowest number of votes is
scratched out of the race. The second-choice
votes on the ballots of this candidate are
counted and the ballots placed in the piles of
those receiving these second choices. How
ever, if these second choices are for the can
didates already disqualified, the third choice
is counted. If a majority vote has been
reached after this tally, no further counting is
necessary.
If no election has resulted, the procedure
is repeated until a majority vote is reached.
In doing this the preference for candidates
already dropped is ignored and the next pref
erence for a name still on the voting list is
counted.
And that is the preferential system. If Stan
ford voters vote intelligently, it works as it
should, with that candidate who is an all
around favorite emerging victorious.
