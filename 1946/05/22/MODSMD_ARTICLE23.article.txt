Election Day, minus one, and 5.000 Stanford students step in
this morning at 10 to start the final lap of the current drive for
a "strong student government." The success of today's election
assembly in Frost Amphitheater (scheduled after student officers
did some strong talking about the importance of knowing who
you're voting for), depends, obviously, upon the number of stu
dents who drop in today to see and hear the largest group of
candidates to run for student offices in many a year.
The band is ready, the candidates will be there, Election Board
is set to roll, attendance of the assembly may decide your vote
tomorrow, the temper of your student government next year.
