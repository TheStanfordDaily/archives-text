# CAMPUS OPINION
## JUST CHANCE? 
### 
To the Editor:
Wonder if these two stories have any connec
tion.
I was sitting in the Cellar the other day, the
day cf your issue showing the picture of the little
boy holding a cup. Your caption on the cut was,
"Fill my cup." The picture was publicity for the
Food Conservation drive, according to the under
line.
Across the Cellar table from me were two
Stanford students smoking over coffee, a hunk of
cake, apple pie, and half a greasy doughnut.
One of the Stanford students was shuffling
through your Daily. "Hmmram," he said, pointing
to the picture, "that kid doesn't look hungry. Look
at those fat cheeks and how his coat is filled out."
Th l ? other Stanford student added, "More pub
licity to get us mixed up with foreign countries.
I'm willing to give up some food if people are starv
ing, but a lot of this is just propaganda."
And they munched away.
Later that afternoon I was sitting on the little
green bus beside a Negro lady with a little boy
on her lap. The man in front of us was holding up
a Chronicle with a big display on food conserva
tion prominently shown. "It's terrible, isn't it?"
said the lady.
' Yes," I said, "I think it is."
"My husband and I," she continued, "have
agreed to give up bread until things straighten out.
I wish there were more we could do."
Is it just chance or do the people who have
(fie h'ast almost always give the most?
