# A 						WASTE OF TIME?
## 
### 
(Editorial Note: Rather than write the follow
ing in his "Who Told You?" column, Stan Shpet
ner, candidate for A.S.S.U. president, requested
spate in "Campus Opinion.")
I am somewhat confused by several points
which, although they were first brought out in my
column, I hesitate to continue to treat there as they
have since assumed "political importance."
When I first brought up the housing question,
expressing dissatisfaction with "polls in Palo Alto"
and "blueprints for the future," I received numer
ous letters from "veterans" who agreed with me.
The same situation arose when the column intro
duced the "athletic situation."
Will the "veterans," including many of my very
close friends, tell me why they look upon tomor
row's student election as a waste of time?
It is most difficult for a newspaper writer to do
anything more than point out the situation as it
exists. It is up to the students to put in a govern
ment that will do something on the issues that
interest them.
