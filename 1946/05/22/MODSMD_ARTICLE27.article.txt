# WHO TOLD YOU?

A bit of interesting information to the veterans
who say that Ihey need housing. Whether there
are as many as 600 or not we really do not know.
However the wife of one, when registering her
name on the list of those waiting, was told "there
are over 600 names and even Dibble can only han
dle m"
To get to the point—something new has been
added. When we first mentioned Interdale some
lime back we were told that the water supply was
no good. But, as we also pointed out —the Uni
versity— the next day—got men out there and
fixed it up.
And that's all the information that has been
handed out.
The many men and women waiting for houses
continue to wait. However, we found that families
are already living at Interdale.
We got a tossing around on a triple play that
can go the famous baseball combo of Tinkers to
Evers to Chance one better. But the news that we

finally were able to get is: Seven families are now
living at Interdale. How were the families that
are now living there chosen? Answer: "We looked
over the list and got men who were willing to go
out there and help put (he place in order."
Then may we respectfully ask: What is the
purpose of letting all the students' who signed up
think that their signing is is worth anything? It has
been said that there were just a few openings and
to make a general announcement would have cre
ated great confusion. That is true. However, if the
system of taking names is not in itself confused, all
that was necessary was to start at the top of the
list and ask each man if he would be willing to
help fix Interdale up in order to get a spot.
