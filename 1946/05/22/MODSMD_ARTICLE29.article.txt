# Five Candidates Give Platforms
## 
### 
Stanford's presidential campaign
swung into high gear last night as
five of the six candidates for the
A.S.S.U. presidency gave planks in
their campaign platforms before the
women of Roble, Branner, Union,
and the men from Encina.
Martin Anderson was the only
presidential candidate who did not
present his views. Frank DeLisle,
A 1 Gilliland, Wally MeCall, Stan
Shpetner, and Jack Wallace all
made their views clear on what the
issues are and how they should be
attacked in the coming year.
Frank DeLisle warned the vot
ers that they must "beware of
Greeks bearing gifts." lie said
that he would make no definite
promises, but that he would at
tempt only to carry out the
wishes of the student body. He
warned the students that never
again can the voters alTord to split
up into small warring factions
within the campus, but that the
Farm must present a strong united
front, and support the man they
elect. He closed by making a plea
for a strong turnout of voters on
election day."I don't urge you
to vote for me, especially, but be
sure and vote," he said.
A 1 Gilliland again stressed to the
voters the importance of voting on
election day. He said he wanted to
make pre-assembly appearances as
an opportunity to introduce him
self to the voters, but that he would
not announce his campaign plat
form until the all-student assembly
today at 10 in the Memorial Audi
torium. He warned the voters to be

careful of the preferential system,
and warned them of the intricacies
of the system.
"Stanford helped give student
government impetus on the Pacific
Coast, and in the next year it will
be important that we retain that
position," said Candidate Wally Mc-
Call. He outlined two of his 12
campaign points, housing and ath
letic policy. He pointed out that we
must make a definite approach to
athletics, that the president next
year will have to act as the front
for a co-ordinated pressure group
to contact influential ex-grads and
help bring the Farm .back to its pre
war eminence.
Stan Shpetner said he did not
believe in sitting back, but that if
be were elected he would con
tinue to put pressure on, and
would at least attempt to get the
facts of the case to the students.
"No one will pull any strings on
me," be promised.
"What do you want from your
student body president, and what
are the problems you think are im
portant?" asked Jack Wallace of
the assembled voters. He asserted
that the president was only a front
for the combined opinions of the
students, and that only through co
operation and understanding could
they settle the problems facing the
Farm next year.
"The vice - president's position
is not traditionally a woman's po
sition," said Sam Streeter in bis
opening address for that position.
Only since have women held
the position, be said. "Women
have seeped into important posi
tions through the war, and I think
it is time the men started to take
over and start settling their proh-«
lems," he concluded.
President Bob Kennedy closed
the Encina meeting by urging all
members of the student body to
be sure and attend the asselnbly
today.
Note: The assembly has been
changed from the Amphitheater
to Memorial Auditorium.

election day."I don't urge you
to vote for me, especially, but be
sure and vote," he said.
A 1 Gilliland again stressed to the
voters the importance of voting on
election day. He said he wanted to
make pre-assembly appearances as
an opportunity to introduce him
self to the voters, but that he would
not announce his campaign plat
form until the all-student assembly
today at 10 in the Memorial Audi
torium. He warned the voters to be

careful of the preferential system,
and warned them of the intricacies
of the system.
"Stanford helped give student
government impetus on the Pacific
Coast, and in the next year it will
be important that we retain that
position," said Candidate Wally Mc-
Call. He outlined two of his 12
campaign points, housing and ath
letic policy. He pointed out that we
must make a definite approach to
athletics, that the president next
year will have to act as the front
for a co-ordinated pressure group
to contact influential ex-grads and
help bring the Farm .back to its pre
war eminence.
Stan Shpetner said he did not
believe in sitting back, but that if
be were elected he would con
tinue to put pressure on, and
would at least attempt to get the
facts of the case to the students.
"No one will pull any strings on
me," be promised.
"What do you want from your
student body president, and what
are the problems you think are im
portant?" asked Jack Wallace of
the assembled voters. He asserted
that the president was only a front
for the combined opinions of the
students, and that only through co
operation and understanding could
they settle the problems facing the
Farm next year.
"The vice - president's position
is not traditionally a woman's po
sition," said Sam Streeter in bis
opening address for that position.
Only since have women held
the position, be said. "Women
have seeped into important posi
tions through the war, and I think
it is time the men started to take
over and start settling their proh-«
lems," he concluded.
President Bob Kennedy closed
the Encina meeting by urging all
members of the student body to
be sure and attend the asselnbly
today.
Note: The assembly has been
changed from the Amphitheater
to Memorial Auditorium.
Stanford's presidential campaign
swung into high gear last night as
five of the six candidates for the
A.S.S.U. presidency gave planks in
their campaign platforms before the
women of Roble, Branner, Union,
and the men from Encina.
Martin Anderson was the only
presidential candidate who did not
present his views. Frank DeLisle,
A 1 Gilliland, Wally MeCall, Stan
Shpetner, and Jack Wallace all
made their views clear on what the
issues are and how they should be
attacked in the coming year.
Frank DeLisle warned the vot
ers that they must "beware of
Greeks bearing gifts." lie said
that he would make no definite
promises, but that he would at
tempt only to carry out the
wishes of the student body. He
warned the students that never
again can the voters alTord to split
up into small warring factions
within the campus, but that the
Farm must present a strong united
front, and support the man they
elect. He closed by making a plea
for a strong turnout of voters on
election day."I don't urge you
to vote for me, especially, but be
sure and vote," he said.
