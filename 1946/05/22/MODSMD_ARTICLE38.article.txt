## 
### 
NEW YORK, May 21 (UP).—The
Yankees finally got a hit off Bob
Feller today after going 13 2-3 in
nings without one, but the Van
Meter, lowa, plow boy still was bril
liant enough to give the Cleveland
Indians a five-hit, 7 to 2 triumph
salted with eight strikouts.
It was the first time the Yan
kees had tackled the fast spithal
ler since he pitched a no-hit, no
run game against them in New
York, April 30, and for nearly
live innings Clevelands fans
watched another "Feller-drama"
unfold.
Finally, catcher Bill Dickey broke
the spell with two out in the fifth,
hitting a clean single to left. Two
innings later, Tommy Henrich, the
one Yankee who has seldom had
difficulty in hitting Feller, blasted
one of his fast ones over the right
field wall. Charley Keller, one of
two batters that Feller walked,
scored the other Yankee run in the
same inning, moving around on sin
gles by Joe DiMaggio and Joe Gor
don.
There was no pressure on Feller
today, because Floyd Bevens, who
dueled so brilliantly with him at
New York, didn't have it this time
and yielded four runs in the first
inning. Catcher Frankie Hayes,
whose ninth-inning homer was the
margin of victory in Feller's no-hit
ter, drove in three of the runs with
a base-clearing double. Feller's
strikeouts raised his total for the
season to 93 for nine games. He has
won six and lost three.
The Bed Sox increased their
lead over the Yankees to six full
games at Detroit, coming from be
hind to win, (i to 4. on the brilliant
pinch-pitching and batting of war
hero Earl Johnson. Johnson
pitched five hitless innings and
smashed two doubles. He came
around to score (he tying run in
the seventh after his first hit and
he drove in the marginal tallies in
the eighth with his second one.
Boston, making four errors in the
first two innings, spotted Detroit a

4 to 0 lead. Joe Dobson, starting
Boston pitcher, went out in the first
inning wh<*n the Tigers made two
runs on two of the errors, a walk
and a single. Jim Bagby was
touched for the other Tiger runs in
the second on two more errors, a
walk and two singles.
George Metkovich got one of the
Boston runs back with a homer in
the third. Alton Benton, who re
lieved starter Vii'gil Trucks in the
fifth, was charged with the defeat.
CastolV Al Jurisich taunted his
old Cardinal teammates at Phila
delphia when he pitched the last
place tie with the idle Brooklyn
Dodders. A three-run rally in
the sixth, touched off by Hon
Northey's homer, gave the Phils
the win. Pinch-hitter Roy Hughes
drove in the deciding run with a
single. George Kurovvski got a
two-run homer for St. Louis.
Cincinnati at Brooklyn in the Na
tional was called after one inning
wilh the Reds ahead, 3 to 2, when
rain drenched the diamond. Pitts
burgh at New York was also post

pitching of Jack Kramer in a night
game. It was Kramer's third straight

New York, didn't have it this time
and yielded four runs in the first
inning. Catcher Frankie Hayes,
whose ninth-inning homer was the
margin of victory in Feller's no-hit
ter, drove in three of the runs with

first two innings, spotted Detroit a

4 to 0 lead. Joe Dobson, starting
Boston pitcher, went out in the first
inning wh<*n the Tigers made two
runs on two of the errors, a walk
and a single. Jim Bagby was
touched for the other Tiger runs in

place tie with the idle Brooklyn
Dodders. A three-run rally in
