# The
						Umpire's Verdict
## 
### ART LEVINSON 
Boston's heavy clouting Red Sox
continue to lead the American loop
by a five-game margin. Rated the
"maybe" champions at the begin
ning of the season by virtue of their
weak hurling staff, the pitching
corps has survived the onslaught of
American League hitting, and with
their swatters going first-rate, the
team is in the driver's seat of the
league.
The bean city outfield is com- ;
posed of three former Coast Leag- |
iters. George Metkovich is a past !
performer for the Sassy Seals of
San Francisco, who the Daily sports
staff of 1f,43 vintage thought was a
"flash in the pan." The left field J
flank is held down by Ted Williams, |
who broke into baseball with San :
Diego. Theodore W. is currently
slugging at the lusty pace of .386, I
and has banged out seven home i
runs.
DOMINIC STARS
Dominic DiMaggio, the bespec- j
tacled member of the DiMaggio
trio, draws a paycheck from the j
Bosox for playing center field. Hit
ting at a respectable figure, and |
fielding impeccably, the- young "Di-
Mag" is performing better than his
more famous brother, Joe.
The one weakness in the infield is
the third base position. Manager j
Joe Cronin has tried to plug the j
hole with varied hands, but none !
have quite filled the bill. "Short- |
stop Joe" started out with Andres, j
and then switched to Eddie Pella- |
gjini, but neither ballplayer was ;
satisfactory. Three days ago. Pinky '
Higgins was purchased from the !
Detroit Tigers in an effort to smooth !
over the rough spots.
FROM PORTLAND, TOO
Johnny Pesky, who hails from |
Portland—so our Portland coverup
man, John Sabin, informs us—is de
veloping into one of the best short
stops in the league, both in the ;
fielding and the hitting departments. ;
Making a clockwise observation j
of the infield, the second base posi
tion now comes into focus. Bobby |
Doerr, who is only outranked in

contemporary stature by possibly
Joe Gordon of the Yankees, is the
man stationed in the post. Although
presently hitting under .300, he
possesses the highest figure in the
circuit for runs batted in.
YORK AT FIRST
For the first base position, Rudy
York was purchased from Detroit
last winter. More of a distance hit
ter than anything else, York's con
tributions to the Red Sox pennant
effort can't be discounted. The big
Indian is a steady fielder, and until
some rookie cracks into major
league ball, York will be kept by
the Boston hierarchy.
Catching duties are handled by
Johnnie Pytlak, veteran backstop.
Not the best in organized baseball,
nevertheless Pytlak does fit well in
the Boston picture. Relief catching
is handled by Wagner.
Pitching, which was supposed
to be the weak link in the Bosox
pennant drive, has been holding
out surprisingly well. Not only
have "800 Boo" Ferriss and Tex
Hughson come through with de
pendable service, but Mickey
Harris and Joe Dobson have been
pitching steady hall, which gives
the club a fairly well-balanced
mound staff.
Too many players who are voted
outstanding rookie of the year, are
plagued with a jinx in their sopho
more season, but not so with the
Ferriss lad. Taking regular duty on
the mound, he has come up with
good performances in all his ap
pearances.
It's too early to wrap up the pen
nant in a box and send it to Boston,
and start scurrying around in
search of a National League pen
nant winner, but there are strong
indications that Tom Yawket, after
spending several millions, is close
to seeing his team win the title.
