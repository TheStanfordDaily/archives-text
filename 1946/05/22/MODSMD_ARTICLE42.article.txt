# School Announces Co-operative Program for Engineer Students
## 
### 
Introduction of a forthcoming Co
operative Education Program, ap
plicable to certain qualified Stan
ford engineering students, has been
announced jointly by Stanford Uni
versity and Food Machinery Cor
poration, Anderson-Barngrover Di
vision, San Jose.
The plan will enable a limited
number of qualified students in the
Upper Division of Stanford's School
of Engineering to add actual com
mercial engineering experience to
their scholastic curriculum. Stu
dents participating in the program
will spend approximately 91 weeks
of intensive training at the Food
Machinery Corporation's Andcrson-
Barngrover Division in San Jose,
California.
INTERSPERSED PROGRAM
This work-training schedule will
be interspersed with the student's
regular college engineering pro
gram, and is aimed at providing the
trainee with a practical engineering
background in a particular indus
try. It is also a step, if the student
so elects, for eventual absorption by
the industry when the student has
completed the Co-operative Pro
gram and the Stanford engineering
requirements. The Co - operative
Program will in no way detract

from nor replace the student's col
lege curriculum, but rather will en
hance and amplify his training in
particular engineering phases.
Participants in the Co-operative
Education Program will be paid
while undergoing training at the
• Food Machinery Corporation, An
derson - Barngrover Division. Stu
dent-trainees attending college un
der the G.I. Bill of Rights will re
ceive government subsistence com
pensation and other benefits as list
ed in Public Law No. 16 or No. 346.
AT OTHER SCHOOLS
Co-operative education programs
| of this type have been successfully
employed by colleges in the Middle
i West and on the Atlantic Coast.
; One of the most successful has been
1 at the Massachusetts Institute of
: Technology.
Further information may be ob
j tained from Prof. Henry P. Goode,
| room 281-B, Stanford School of En-
I gineering, or Mr. A. R. Beecroft of
the Anderson-Barngrover Division
of the Food Machinery Corporation,
San Jose.

Machinery Corporation's Andcrson-
Barngrover Division in San Jose,
California.
INTERSPERSED PROGRAM
This work-training schedule will
be interspersed with the student's
regular college engineering pro
gram, and is aimed at providing the
trainee with a practical engineering
background in a particular indus
try. It is also a step, if the student
so elects, for eventual absorption by
the industry when the student has
completed the Co-operative Pro
gram and the Stanford engineering
requirements. The Co - operative
Program will in no way detract

from nor replace the student's col
lege curriculum, but rather will en
hance and amplify his training in
particular engineering phases.
Participants in the Co-operative
Education Program will be paid
while undergoing training at the
• Food Machinery Corporation, An
derson - Barngrover Division. Stu
dent-trainees attending college un
der the G.I. Bill of Rights will re
ceive government subsistence com
pensation and other benefits as list
ed in Public Law No. 16 or No. 346.

Introduction of a forthcoming Co
operative Education Program, ap
plicable to certain qualified Stan
ford engineering students, has been
announced jointly by Stanford Uni
versity and Food Machinery Cor
poration, Anderson-Barngrover Di
vision, San Jose.
The plan will enable a limited
number of qualified students in the
Upper Division of Stanford's School
of Engineering to add actual com
mercial engineering experience to
their scholastic curriculum. Stu
dents participating in the program
will spend approximately 91 weeks
of intensive training at the Food
Machinery Corporation's Andcrson-
Barngrover Division in San Jose,
California.
