# Law School Face Lifting Calls for Dorm, Library, More Space
## New Law Building to Have Facilities of Real Courts 
### BOYD HAIGHT 
Grumbling judges, confused wit
nesses, inattentive jurors, and noisy
spectators will be nothing new to
future Stanford law graduates when
they argue their first cases in
crowded courts.
All the facilities of a modern day
courtroom are being planned for a
moot court in the relocated Law
Building to give Stanford law stu
dents experience in courtroom pro
cedure.
COURT EXPERIENCE
A judge's bench, witness chair,
jury box, counsel table and specta
tor seats will all be a part of the
new moot court to be included on
the second floor of the Law School
Building, which will be converted
from the Administration Building.
"The size and acoustics of the
courtroom will provide an op
portunity for law students to de
velop their courtroom poise,"
states Architect Eldridge T. Spen
cer. director of the University
Planning Department.
Moot court lawyers will have ac
cess to the nearby law library and
lengthy consultations with "clients"
may be carried on in adjoining al
coves. '
LARGE LIBRARY
"The new Law Building has been
planned to develop a closely-knit
unit with high morale, thus mak
ing the Law School a force within
and outside the University," states
Mr. Spencer.
Classrooms, moot court, offices,
and lounge will center around the
57,000-volume Law Library. Mr.
Spcnccr puts it this way: "The
school will become a simulated
law office. Instructors will be
members of the firm and students
junior members. The whole idea
will be to familiarize students
with the processes of an actual
law office."
As a part of this plan, a room ad
jacent to the lounge in the base
ment will be available for typing
briefs and dictaphones may be in
stalled.
MODERN LOUNGE
The large lecture hall on the first
floor and a library reading room on
the second floor will be the class
room and study facilities but there
will be something else too.
Plans call for a lounge to pro
vide a relaxed atmosphere for
hard-driving "legal eagles." There
will be deep chairs, magazine

| racks, and plenty of room for
extra-court arguments.
The new dormitory to house 40
, upper-division law students is still
in the planning stage. Type studies
! are being made based on available
materials and present methods of
| construction. Funds for the dormi
' tory have been contributed by
Judge George E. Crothers, '95, of
! San Francisco.
HARVARD PLAN STUDIED
It is hoped that Crothers Hall will
j be one of several dormitories con
; structed in the Branner, Toyon, En -
cina area. Ealing facilities will be
I combined with the other new dor-
I mitories.
Studies have been made of Har
vard's Law School and the loca
! tion of the Law School dormitory
j 1.500 feet away from the Law
Building. The location of Croth
ers Hall will give a walk of some
1.200 to 1,800 feet to Stanford law
students.
No definite date has been set for
j work to get under way on the re
' modeling of the Administration
Building. The University has been
advised that industry is not yet sta
< bilized sufficiently to allow the be-
I ginning and completion of a ma
| jor construction job, according to
I Mr. Spencer.


(ARCHITECTS' PLANS for the new Law School, to he housed in the


present Administration Building, are shown above. They provide for
increased space for the Law Library, faculty offices, student lounge,
and other facilities for the improved and enlarged Law School.

dent lounge, kitchen, stacks, and storage space. Second from left is the
second floor plan (level D) which includes the Moot Court room, class


room, and reading rooms.
Level C of the second floor plan includes stall' oflices and library
stacks. First floor mex/.anine, right, will house seminar and research
room, and a law review work room.

Shown above, left, is the basement plan showing location of a stu
dent lounge, kitchen, stacks, and storage space. Second from left is the
second floor plan (level D) which includes the Moot Court room, class


room, and reading rooms.
Level C of the second floor plan includes stall' oflices and library
stacks. First floor mex/.anine, right, will house seminar and research
room, and a law review work room.
Grumbling judges, confused wit
nesses, inattentive jurors, and noisy
spectators will be nothing new to
future Stanford law graduates when
they argue their first cases in
crowded courts.
All the facilities of a modern day
courtroom are being planned for a
moot court in the relocated Law
Building to give Stanford law stu
dents experience in courtroom pro
cedure.
COURT EXPERIENCE
A judge's bench, witness chair,
jury box, counsel table and specta
tor seats will all be a part of the
new moot court to be included on
the second floor of the Law School
Building, which will be converted
from the Administration Building.
"The size and acoustics of the
courtroom will provide an op
portunity for law students to de
velop their courtroom poise,"
states Architect Eldridge T. Spen
cer. director of the University
Planning Department.
Moot court lawyers will have ac
cess to the nearby law library and
lengthy consultations with "clients"
may be carried on in adjoining al
coves. '
LARGE LIBRARY
"The new Law Building has been
planned to develop a closely-knit
unit with high morale, thus mak
ing the Law School a force within
and outside the University," states
Mr. Spencer.
Classrooms, moot court, offices,
and lounge will center around the
57,000-volume Law Library. Mr.
Spcnccr puts it this way: "The
school will become a simulated
law office. Instructors will be
members of the firm and students
junior members. The whole idea
will be to familiarize students
with the processes of an actual
law office."
As a part of this plan, a room ad
jacent to the lounge in the base
ment will be available for typing
briefs and dictaphones may be in
stalled.
MODERN LOUNGE
The large lecture hall on the first
floor and a library reading room on
the second floor will be the class
room and study facilities but there
will be something else too.
Plans call for a lounge to pro
vide a relaxed atmosphere for
hard-driving "legal eagles." There
will be deep chairs, magazine

| racks, and plenty of room for
extra-court arguments.
The new dormitory to house 40
, upper-division law students is still
in the planning stage. Type studies
! are being made based on available
materials and present methods of
| construction. Funds for the dormi
' tory have been contributed by
Judge George E. Crothers, '95, of
! San Francisco.
HARVARD PLAN STUDIED
It is hoped that Crothers Hall will
j be one of several dormitories con
; structed in the Branner, Toyon, En -
cina area. Ealing facilities will be
I combined with the other new dor-
I mitories.
Studies have been made of Har
vard's Law School and the loca
! tion of the Law School dormitory
j 1.500 feet away from the Law
Building. The location of Croth
ers Hall will give a walk of some
1.200 to 1,800 feet to Stanford law
students.
No definite date has been set for
j work to get under way on the re
' modeling of the Administration
Building. The University has been
advised that industry is not yet sta
< bilized sufficiently to allow the be-
I ginning and completion of a ma
| jor construction job, according to
I Mr. Spencer.
