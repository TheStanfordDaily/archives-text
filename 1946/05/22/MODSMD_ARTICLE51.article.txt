In connection with the Law
School plan, President Donald B.
Tresidder said yesterday:
"I am pleased to report that
steady progress is being made on
the Law School plan. Alumni, work
ing through the Stanford Law So
cieties, have undertaken the task
with understanding and enthusiasm.
Success in this program will assure
us that the Law School will main
tain its position among the top
ranking law schools of the nation.
'"Generous and helpful alumni and
friends already have contributed
over $100,000 in support of the plan,
not counting the splendid gift of
more than $125,000 from Judge
George E. Crothers for a dormitory
for Law School students. I believe
we can say that we are well on the
way toward our ultimate goal.
"The location of the new home for
the Law School has been deter
mined, the architects are now pre
paring the working drawings and
we shall push the project through to
completion as rapidly as possible.
Architects are working also on the
plans for Crothers Hall, the law
dormitory.
"At this time, I wish to send a
special word of thanks to the Law
School plan chairmen in so many
areas who are giving generously of
their time so that their hopes and
ours will be realized—a Law School
at Stanford that is second to none."
