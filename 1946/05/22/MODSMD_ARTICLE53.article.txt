Today The Daily presents its Stanford Law School Plan edi- j
tion. In stories on this and the front page we have described the
purpose of the plan, and, as much as possible, the physical alter
ations coincident with the Law School development.
The important factor in the plan, however, seems to us to be ;
something far more intangible and far more valuable and what is
conveyed by mere physical improvement ot the Law School.
It is not something purely monetary, either, although the
$125,000 gift of Judge Crothers and subscriptions to the plan al
j ready received from Stanford alumni are proving instrumental in
the development of the Law School.
What is important is the spirit that prompted these gifts. It is
the spirit of the Stanford family. It is the feeling that members of
this family, law alumni and others, have for Stanford. It is their
desire to help in the growth and development of Stanford, and to
contribute spiritually and materially to the fulfillment of these
ideals.
We are, frankly, not too interested in physical plants. The
real value of an educational institution such as Stanford lies in
! the calibre of its faculty and students. As long as Stanford con
tinues to have a topnotch faculty and an outstanding student
body, we need not worry about her future.
And as long as members of the Stanford family continue to
show and prove their selfless interest and concern for Stanford's !
welfare, we know that the spirit and ideals which form the basis
of Stanford's existence will not die.â€”M.S.
