### HELEN PINKERTON 
Representing the Law School fac
ulty's reaction to the Stanford Law
School plan, five professors con
firmed the belief that the plan for
larger office, library, and classroom
space, plus a new and separate dor
mitory for law students answers a
long-felt need and indicates a rise
in the already high reputation of
the Law School.
Interviewed yesterday by the
Daily, Dean Lowell Turrentine, and
Professors Marion R. Kirkwood,
George F. Osborne, John B. Hurl
but. and William B. Owens looked
forward to increased efficiency and
more adequate service to the stu
dents of the Stanford Law School.
TURRENTINE KEtfNOTES
The school's acting dean, Lowell
Turrentine, keynoted faculty reac
tion: "We are greatly indebted to
the Stanford law alumni and other
friends of the Law School for the
generous response to the present
appeal for donations to the Stan
ford Law School ptan.
"The numerous gifts which have
been received show the fine loy
alty of our graduates to this
school," he continued, "and in
clude not only relatively large
amounts from persons of some
means, hut many gifts of smaller
amounts —some from veterans just
out of service and some from
young lawyers whom we know to
have very little means, indeed,
but who are anxious to be count
ed in on this plan.
"We appreciate equally the fine
cooperation which has been accord
ed to Mr. Charles A. Beardsley,
chairman of the national commit
tee, by lawyers in local communi
ties in doing necessary contact work
to spread the news of the plan. We
are indebted not only for money but
for time," he iterated.
LIMIT REACHED
Professor Kiikwuou, retired dean
of the school, recalled that as long
ago as 1914 it was recognized that
the school had reached its limits as
a physical plant. Conditions have
been steadily worse since that time,
the library being divided between
the Inner Quad rooms and the base
ment of the administration build
ing. and the reading space being
adequate for only one-third of the
school.
"We have long wanted a dormi
tory for the Law School and an
adequate study building. Now
fortunately we will get both. The

work of the school will be done
far more effectivly than it has
been in recent years," Mr. Kirk
wood concluded.
Commenting on the all-around
j advantage of the plan, Mr. Osborne
| said that the gift of the law stu
j dents' dormitory from Judge George
i E. Crothers is one of the most vital
i in the life of the student.
SLEEP AND EAT LAW
"Students should sleep and eat
i law. Discussion among themsleves,
i going over points of law, living in a
| group with similar study habits and
! interests adds immeasurably to the
| growth of the student in profes-
I sional ability.
I "This particular gifts puts the
University and Stanford lawyers
in the lasting debt of Judge
Crothers," Mr. Osborne said.
Mr. Hurlbut, assistant dean,
| pointed out that the elements of a
! great law school are an eminent
j faculty, a competent student body
J and physical facilities reasonably
j adequate to enable both to function
I effectively.
WILL ATTRACT STUDENTS
"Through the generosity of the
j University and alumni and friends
j of the Law School we are assured
j of adequate up-to-date physical fa
cilities. So long as we maintain an
eminent faculty, we will continue to
attract qualified students who can
afford Stanford's tuition.
"Many, however, cannot," he
I asserted. "At the present time
most of our students arc entitled
to the educational benefits of the
G.I. law. From a long range
i viewpoint, however, we urgently
need substantially more scholar
ship assistance than is now avail
able. It is hoped that the present
effort on behalf of the Law School
will result in an endowment for
that purpose.
"Enabling the Law School," he
continued, "to train gifted students
who cannot afford the tuition of a
private university will further the
, purpose of Stanford and raise our
! own stature."
William B. Owens, professor of
I law. predicted that the new build
j ing will enable the students and
j faculty to do more effective work
: through more efficient use of the
; library and Moot Court."It should
| help to attract a steady flow of
t high-grade students to the Law
j School, whose reputation for Ihor
: ough training is already estab
s lished," he said.

TURRENTINE KEtfNOTES
The school's acting dean, Lowell
Turrentine, keynoted faculty reac
tion: "We are greatly indebted to
the Stanford law alumni and other
friends of the Law School for the
generous response to the present
appeal for donations to the Stan
ford Law School ptan.
"The numerous gifts which have
been received show the fine loy
alty of our graduates to this
school," he continued, "and in
clude not only relatively large
amounts from persons of some
means, hut many gifts of smaller
amounts —some from veterans just
out of service and some from
young lawyers whom we know to
have very little means, indeed,
but who are anxious to be count
ed in on this plan.
"We appreciate equally the fine
cooperation which has been accord
ed to Mr. Charles A. Beardsley,
chairman of the national commit
tee, by lawyers in local communi
ties in doing necessary contact work
to spread the news of the plan. We
are indebted not only for money but
for time," he iterated.
LIMIT REACHED
Professor Kiikwuou, retired dean
of the school, recalled that as long
ago as 1914 it was recognized that
the school had reached its limits as
a physical plant. Conditions have
been steadily worse since that time,
the library being divided between
the Inner Quad rooms and the base
ment of the administration build
ing. and the reading space being
adequate for only one-third of the
school.
"We have long wanted a dormi
tory for the Law School and an
adequate study building. Now
fortunately we will get both. The

work of the school will be done
far more effectivly than it has
been in recent years," Mr. Kirk
wood concluded.
Commenting on the all-around
j advantage of the plan, Mr. Osborne
| said that the gift of the law stu
j dents' dormitory from Judge George
i E. Crothers is one of the most vital
i in the life of the student.
SLEEP AND EAT LAW
"Students should sleep and eat
i law. Discussion among themsleves,
i going over points of law, living in a
| group with similar study habits and
! interests adds immeasurably to the
| growth of the student in profes-
I sional ability.
I "This particular gifts puts the
University and Stanford lawyers
in the lasting debt of Judge
Crothers," Mr. Osborne said.
Mr. Hurlbut, assistant dean,
| pointed out that the elements of a
! great law school are an eminent
j faculty, a competent student body
J and physical facilities reasonably
j adequate to enable both to function
I effectively.
WILL ATTRACT STUDENTS
"Through the generosity of the
j University and alumni and friends
j of the Law School we are assured
j of adequate up-to-date physical fa
cilities. So long as we maintain an
eminent faculty, we will continue to
attract qualified students who can
afford Stanford's tuition.
"Many, however, cannot," he
I asserted. "At the present time
most of our students arc entitled
to the educational benefits of the
G.I. law. From a long range
i viewpoint, however, we urgently
need substantially more scholar
ship assistance than is now avail
able. It is hoped that the present
effort on behalf of the Law School
will result in an endowment for
that purpose.
"Enabling the Law School," he
continued, "to train gifted students
who cannot afford the tuition of a
private university will further the
, purpose of Stanford and raise our
! own stature."
William B. Owens, professor of

Representing the Law School fac
ulty's reaction to the Stanford Law
School plan, five professors con
firmed the belief that the plan for
larger office, library, and classroom
space, plus a new and separate dor
mitory for law students answers a
long-felt need and indicates a rise
in the already high reputation of
the Law School.
Interviewed yesterday by the
Daily, Dean Lowell Turrentine, and
Professors Marion R. Kirkwood,
George F. Osborne, John B. Hurl
but. and William B. Owens looked
forward to increased efficiency and
more adequate service to the stu
dents of the Stanford Law School.
TURRENTINE KEtfNOTES
The school's acting dean, Lowell
Turrentine, keynoted faculty reac
tion: "We are greatly indebted to
the Stanford law alumni and other
friends of the Law School for the
generous response to the present
appeal for donations to the Stan
ford Law School ptan.
"The numerous gifts which have
been received show the fine loy
alty of our graduates to this
school," he continued, "and in
clude not only relatively large
amounts from persons of some
means, hut many gifts of smaller
amounts —some from veterans just
out of service and some from
young lawyers whom we know to
have very little means, indeed,
but who are anxious to be count
ed in on this plan.
"We appreciate equally the fine
cooperation which has been accord
ed to Mr. Charles A. Beardsley,
chairman of the national commit
tee, by lawyers in local communi
ties in doing necessary contact work
to spread the news of the plan. We
are indebted not only for money but
for time," he iterated.
LIMIT REACHED
Professor Kiikwuou, retired dean
of the school, recalled that as long
ago as 1914 it was recognized that
the school had reached its limits as
a physical plant. Conditions have
been steadily worse since that time,
the library being divided between
the Inner Quad rooms and the base
ment of the administration build
ing. and the reading space being
adequate for only one-third of the
school.
"We have long wanted a dormi
tory for the Law School and an
adequate study building. Now
fortunately we will get both. The

work of the school will be done
far more effectivly than it has
been in recent years," Mr. Kirk
wood concluded.
Commenting on the all-around
j advantage of the plan, Mr. Osborne
| said that the gift of the law stu
j dents' dormitory from Judge George
i E. Crothers is one of the most vital
i in the life of the student.
SLEEP AND EAT LAW
"Students should sleep and eat
i law. Discussion among themsleves,
i going over points of law, living in a
| group with similar study habits and
! interests adds immeasurably to the
| growth of the student in profes-
I sional ability.
I "This particular gifts puts the
University and Stanford lawyers
in the lasting debt of Judge
Crothers," Mr. Osborne said.
Mr. Hurlbut, assistant dean,
| pointed out that the elements of a
! great law school are an eminent
j faculty, a competent student body
J and physical facilities reasonably
j adequate to enable both to function
I effectively.
WILL ATTRACT STUDENTS
"Through the generosity of the
j University and alumni and friends
j of the Law School we are assured
j of adequate up-to-date physical fa
cilities. So long as we maintain an
eminent faculty, we will continue to
attract qualified students who can
afford Stanford's tuition.
"Many, however, cannot," he
I asserted. "At the present time
most of our students arc entitled
to the educational benefits of the
G.I. law. From a long range
i viewpoint, however, we urgently
need substantially more scholar
ship assistance than is now avail
able. It is hoped that the present
effort on behalf of the Law School
will result in an endowment for
that purpose.
"Enabling the Law School," he
continued, "to train gifted students
who cannot afford the tuition of a
private university will further the
, purpose of Stanford and raise our
! own stature."
William B. Owens, professor of
I law. predicted that the new build
j ing will enable the students and
j faculty to do more effective work
: through more efficient use of the
; library and Moot Court."It should
| help to attract a steady flow of
t high-grade students to the Law
j School, whose reputation for Ihor
: ough training is already estab
s lished," he said.
