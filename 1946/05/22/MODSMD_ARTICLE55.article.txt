# Stanford Law Grads Enjoy High Degree of Success
## 
### JOANNE O'BRIEN 
Stanford law graduates have made
a higher record of success in Cali
fornia State Bar examinations than
any other university in the state
since 1932. The combined efforts of
hard-drilling professors and hard
working students have made Stan
ford's Law School one of the best
in the country.
It has always boon the policy of
the Law School to keep enrollment
down and standards up. With a
small group of students, young
lawyers-to-be can get better ac
quainted with their professors and
receive more individual instruction.
HIGH STANDARDS
In tracing the history of the Law
School, it is evident that these high
standards were maintained from the
very beginning. It took the school
only eight years from its start in
1893 to gain acceptance in 1901 to
the Association of American Law
Schools.
Edwin H. Wodruff, one of the
pioneers in the Law School, gave
the first course in Elementary Law
and he and his beginning students
would indulge in long "bull ses
sions" over the fine points of court
decisions. The first law students
had to trudge to Eneina, where the
small law library was kept in the
southwest corner of the building.
Arthur M. Cathcart, professor
emeritus of law, said that when he
arrived at Stanford in 1904 there
was talk even then of obtaining a
new law building, but in 1946 as
in 1904 no new building had been
erected.
FACULTY INCREASE
The law faculty has grown from
the original four members in 1893
to eleven full-time and four part
time professors. During World
War I, with many teachers and stu
dents leaving for the service, en
rollment in the school dropped to
40. At the war's end, with the in

flux of new students, enrollment
climbed back and at the present
time 242 men and women attend the
school.
Many graduates of the Stanford
Law School have distinguished
themselves in widely assorted fields
of professional life. They have
served in high governmental, in
dustrial, and financial positions, and
also as presidents of state and na
tional bar associations.
The annual Moot Court trials are
one of the high spots in the law stu
dent's life. Every year the students
get together, pick those most able,
and conduct a trial in the accepted
professional style. This year Jus
tice Douglas Edmonds of the Cali
fornia Supreme Court, Judge Mor
ris Dooling, and Judge Julian C.
Goddell handed down the decisions
to the young law students.

would indulge in long "bull ses
sions" over the fine points of court
decisions. The first law students
had to trudge to Eneina, where the
small law library was kept in the
southwest corner of the building.
Arthur M. Cathcart, professor
emeritus of law, said that when he
arrived at Stanford in 1904 there
was talk even then of obtaining a
new law building, but in 1946 as
in 1904 no new building had been
erected.
FACULTY INCREASE
The law faculty has grown from
the original four members in 1893
to eleven full-time and four part
time professors. During World
War I, with many teachers and stu
dents leaving for the service, en
rollment in the school dropped to
40. At the war's end, with the in

flux of new students, enrollment
climbed back and at the present
time 242 men and women attend the
school.
Many graduates of the Stanford
Law School have distinguished
themselves in widely assorted fields
of professional life. They have
served in high governmental, in
dustrial, and financial positions, and
also as presidents of state and na
tional bar associations.
The annual Moot Court trials are
one of the high spots in the law stu
dent's life. Every year the students
get together, pick those most able,
and conduct a trial in the accepted
professional style. This year Jus
tice Douglas Edmonds of the Cali
fornia Supreme Court, Judge Mor
ris Dooling, and Judge Julian C.
Goddell handed down the decisions
to the young law students.
Stanford law graduates have made
a higher record of success in Cali
fornia State Bar examinations than
any other university in the state
since 1932. The combined efforts of
hard-drilling professors and hard
working students have made Stan
ford's Law School one of the best
in the country.
It has always boon the policy of
the Law School to keep enrollment
down and standards up. With a
small group of students, young
lawyers-to-be can get better ac
quainted with their professors and
receive more individual instruction.
HIGH STANDARDS
In tracing the history of the Law
School, it is evident that these high
standards were maintained from the
very beginning. It took the school
only eight years from its start in
1893 to gain acceptance in 1901 to
the Association of American Law
Schools.
