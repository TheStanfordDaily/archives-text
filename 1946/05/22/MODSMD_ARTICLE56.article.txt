## 
### 
Waiting to inform the majority
of law students of details of the
Law School plan through The Daily
today, members of the law faculty
have told only a few students the
complete plans for renovation of
the Law School.
General consensus of opinion
among the few was an enthusiastic
approval of the plans.
"We're very enthusiastic about
moving," said Mrs. Lucille Athcarn.
"We've been so crowded in the
present Law School, with about
twice as many students as there
are chairs in the Law Library to
accommodate them."
Crothers Hall, proposed dormi
tory for men students, received her
commendation, as did the student
lounge. "But the women need a
dormitory as well," she said.
Robert Fletcher, second-year law
student, was "very favorably im
pressed" upon seeing Law School
plans. Among the "many advan
tages" he cited as particularly fa
vorable were the library facilities,
consulting rooms, and enlarged floor
space.
"We've got terrific attendance
now," he said "and these improve
ments will be a big help to the stu
dents in taking care of their study
problems."
Bob Steel, second-year law stu
dent. echoed Fletcher's statement.
"At long last the Law School will
have the physical plant necessary
to take care of its growing size and
importance," he said.
