# Law School To Take Over Administration Building
## Plans Being Made For Dorms, Offices 
### 
Stanford's Administration Build- j
ing, traditional scene of Re? Day
! bedlam, will undergo a thorough
face-lifting some time in '46 or '47 |
j when it is reconverted into a new '
! and enlarged School of Law.
Plans to improve the Law School
| received impetus last month with a ;
gift of over $125,000 from Judge
| George E. Crothcrs, '95, of San
Francisco, to provide housing for j
j law students.
Meanwhile, the University Plan
j ning Department, under the super- j
! vision of Architect Eldridge T.
; Spencer, is working on preliminary
[ drawings for Crothers Hall (initial j
I law student dormitory unit) and
; other living groups planned to house ,
future lawyers.

For further information regard
ing plans for the Law School and
pictures of tentative plans, sec
page four.

When preliminary plans arc
approved, architects will l>egin
working drawings for submission
to conl ractors.
Preliminary plans have already
been approved for the School of
Law. Completion of working draw
ings under architects Weihc, Frick,
and Kruse of San Francisco will re
quire three to four months.
CO M PLETE REBUILDING J
Calling for complete rebuilding of
the interior of the Administration
Building, the project includes con
struction of additional floors, a Law

j Library, and other facilities de-
I signed to meet the needs of a mod
{ ern law school.
Until working drawings for a
reconverted Ad Building are com
pleted, construction cannot begin,
i Estimates on earliest possible
starting date for remodeling place
the time some time between next
| fall and winter quarters.
Administration and Planning De
partment studies now center on
! where the Law School and admin
j istrative offices will be housed dur
i ing the construction interim. Only
I definite decision so far is that the
Knoll, the old President's house,
1 will be u.sed during the conversion
j period. But whether the Law School
I or administration will occupy it has
j not yet been determined.
IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES
Requirements of the Law School,
j itself, to fulfill its immediate objec
j lives include $750,000 to be divided
: as follows: (1) faculty, $250,000; (2)
! plant, $350,000; (3) Stanford Law
Library, $50,000; and (4) scholar
ships, $100,000.
At least three new professor
ships are needed to cover addi
| tional areas of instruction brought
I on by an ever-increasing volume

of legal decisions.
Minimum housing requirements,
as determined by the Law School
faculty, include 56,800 square feet
of space to be divided among the
library; reading room and executive
offices; lecture ball, class and sem
inar rooms, and staff ofTices; and a
student lounge, Student Law Asso
ciation office, kitchcncttc, and lock
ers.
researcii enlargement
The present Law Library requires
enlargement for research in wider
areas of legal instruction.
Scholarships are wanted to
make available to Stanford stu
dents. who otherwise would not
he able to rcccive their law in
struction here. Chief purpose of
the scholarships is to fill in gaps
not covered by existing funds and
the G.I. Bill.
Long-range achievement of Law
School hopes will require four mil
lion dollars to cover steady im
provements through the years.
Still an open question is where
the site of the future Ad Building
will fce. Probable result, at least
for the next few years, will be de
centralization of administrative of
fices until a new administration
building can be built.


ADMINISTRATION BUILDINO. with the "rolling hills" and the
Hoover War Library in the background, is soon to be remodeled for the
! Stanford Law School.
