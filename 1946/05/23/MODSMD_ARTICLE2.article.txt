# University Planning Co-ordinated Dining
## 
### 
University officials reported yes
terday they are considering a plan
to co-ordinate men's dining hall ar
rangements within men's living
groups.
According to Dean of Students
John Stalnaker, this would mean
men living in halls having kitchen
and dining facilities would pay reg
ular University board rates and
would have to eat their meals in
their living groups.
'UNDER CONSIDERATION'
'"The plan is still under consider
ation, however," Mr. Stalnaker said,
"and final decision awaits the re
action of the men to the proposal."
Under prewar arrangements, as
explained by Stanley L. Sharp, dean
of housing, it. was optional for men
to pay board rates to University
dining halls, regardless of where
they lived.
Formerly, men purchased meal
tickets for the quarter if they wished
to cat in Encina, only men's dining
hall to function regularly. Encina
served men in Branner and Toyon.
SERIOUS REACTION?
''This plan outlines the Univer
sity's ultimate objective in men's
living and dining arrangements,"
Mr. Stalnaker said. "Should seri
ous reaction against it arise, we will
try to accommodate those men in
halls without dining facilities."
In conjunction with the proposal,
Mr. Sharp stated the University
plans to operate the Branner kitchen
and dining hall next fall.
"Before we do so, however," he
said, "we want to make sure that
enough men will eat there to insure
efficient operation of Branner's din
ing facilities. We would not want to
have to subsidize a men's dining
hall with women's board funds."
