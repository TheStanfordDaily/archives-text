# And Bring Your Student Body Card...

... to the polls today so that you'll be able
to vote for your candidates in the ASSU elec
tions.
But before you start checking the ballots,
be sure that you have evaluated as thorough-
Jy as possible the platform and record of
cach nominee.
We look for intelligence and honesty in
our student body president and vice-presi
dent, for level-headed approach to an issue,

and for thoughtful coordination of all factions
on campus.
Both jobs seem to us to call for persons
who can see a lot farther than the edges of
campus, or of 1946, and who can work out
the role of student government on the Farm
through that perspective.
If you think you kpow the persons with
the answers, remember that the only way
you'll get them in office is to vote today.
Step right up, Stanford.
