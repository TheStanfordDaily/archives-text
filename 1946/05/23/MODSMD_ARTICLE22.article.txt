Dear Editor:
I have just attended the assembly at Memorial
Hall and with elections coming up tomorrow
I am confused. Others, whom I have talked with,
are equally bewildered. We want to vote sensi
bly tomorrow, but we cannot because we do not
know enough about the candidates.
The excellent speeches that were presented at
thi- assembly whetted our appetites. We were
a I le to narrow the field. But now we would like
to find out more about the few that we pin our
hopes on. Unfortunately, there is neither the
tune nor the opportunity.
And what about the vast majority of other
candidates for important offices, who gave us the
"Jack-in-the-box" performance, which I feel sure
they did not enjoy and which told us, the voters,
nothing.
Why not publish a special edition of the Daily
in which each candidate is given an equal amount
of space to present his or her qualifications for
office and the policies he or she intends to sup
port? Then give the student body a few days in
which to weigh the merits of each case, so that the
voters go to the polls prepared to vote intelli
gently.
Today the names appear; tomorrow I must vote.
'1 his rush leaves me bewildered.
in most cases all a voter can do is cast his or
her ballot for a candidate because "he's a swell fel
low" or "she's a queen bee." This does not consti
tute participation in an election. And until the stu
dents are able to participate intelligently, they will
not get the student government they want and
deserve.
