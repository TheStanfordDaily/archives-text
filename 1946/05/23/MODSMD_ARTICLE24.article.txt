To the Editor:
Klahoya, as the only organized group of off-cam
pus students, feels that it can cooperate to a greater
extent with other campus organizations if it is
represented directly by one of its own members.
Since Klahoya forms the core body of off-campus

students, it would like to become the medium of
this group by transmitting ideas and suggstions
from these students individually or collectively to
Excorn.
Wu lack the strong attachments that are nat
urally built up in campus living groups. A repre
sentative from Klahoya to Excom would bridge this
gap and thus strengthen our ties with student gov
ernment and with Stanford.
