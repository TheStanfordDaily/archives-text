To the Editor:
I would like to take advantage of The Daily's
offer to run statements from some of the candidates
running for offices in tomorrow's election.
In the future, Stanford faces many problems—
some that can only be decided through close coop
eration of the various classes with the Administra
tion. The students will have to speak for them
selves and provide suitable solutions to the prob
lems. The idea of the various classes in Stanford
being unified is far from the truth today. It will be
the job of the new class officers to unify the stu
dents in their class, whether they live in fraterni
ties, in halls, or off-campus.
I resent the feeling that the Administration has
imparted that the class of 1948 is clogging up the
housing situation for women. The University has
no one to blame but themselves. Our class has had
to fight for itself since we came here as freshmen in
1944. We were the first class to be on campus when
fraternities were non-existent; we were the first
class to be on campus after the sororities were put
out of operation; we were the first class to see
Stanford transform from war to peace. Let's make
ourselves heard. Let's make ourselves the first
strong class to unify itself since 1942.
