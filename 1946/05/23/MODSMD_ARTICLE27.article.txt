# THE 						STANFORD STORY

### BILL HORNBY 
ON A FRAYED INSTITUTION
The modern version of a picnic at Stanford
brings no weightier technical problem than brak
ing tlie car and reaching for an opener. By and
large the day is gone when a hike into the Stan
lord hills with hero and hamper was a social goal
of a coed. And to be honest, even in the past a
majority of the students preferred to enjoy their
Stanford weekends with the least effort possible.
But the picnic was definitely more a part of the
campus life in the days coeds might hike as
far as King's Mountain or drive in a buggy to Bel
mont. If they knew nothing of the joys of the
fast ride to Carmel, they learned a great deal
more about the immediate environs. Present-day
searchers for a parking place on Governor's Lane
or the other side of the lake could learn a lot from
an oldtime "queener" who made a practice of cas
ing the nearby hills by day before commencing his
romantic operations.
The first Stanford picnickers walked, perhaps
with a bottle of the wine Senator Stanford manu
factured by the hundreds of gallons at his Sacra
mento ranch. But the lady of the day did not drink
anything except "safe" water, and the mixed drink
ing party was unknown.
Next came the campus tallyhos These were
roiling, jerking hangovers from the stagecoach
days, drawn by six horses driven by old Dan Woods
whose flaming red handlebar moustache was the
envy of Encina. For the day the coeds and roughs,
and the inevitable chaperone, would proceed to
San Jose or Congress Springs near Saratoga.
Up on King's Mountain, strangely enough, lived
a Mrs. King who ran a weekend resort. Despite
the stiff mores of the time- eagle-eyed Mrs. King
was considered a good and sufficient chaperone,
and this resort was the Del Monte of the early

1900's, the most logical place for a respectable
mixed weekend. The Sunday chicken dinner was
worth the walk or the ride to this haven on the
present Skyline road.
Intimately linked with this early social life was
"Marguerite," a very tired and long wooden bus
drawn by horses. Benches along both sides seated
the girls with the long skirts as they were called
for at the sorority houses. The chaperones some
how always got shuffled down to the dark end of
the bus.
When "Marguerite" died, Mr. Paulsen's Livery
Stable of Palo Alto provided rubber-tired run
abouts complete with horse and whip for a fee.
In one instance the fee got too large the night
before a major prom in the Encina lobby. The wom
en, intent on outsmarting Mr. Paulsen, voted to
walk to the dance. In the ruffles of the day they
waded through the muddy fields to the big brown
Barn. Everybody was very unhappy including
Mr. Paulsen who restored his rates and ended the
Farm's first boycott.
To be "in," a man hired a carriage and took the
object of his campaign for a ride around the Farm.
There is a story, unsupported except by common
sense, that certain Palo Alto horses who could drive
themselves and find the road home -unguided
brought phenomenal fees.
With the coming of the auto the picnic and the
Sunday drive increased in tempo and lost their
original values of leisure. The mortality rate was
high among the Sunday philosophers. In 1910 the
prettiest girl on campus hooked the only male
with car for the junior prom. From then until the
first. World War the buggies held their own, but in
the plush '20's the autos took over.
So today no one knows of Frenchman's Lake,
long since filled in, and the coeds don't walk to the
Skyline anymore.
