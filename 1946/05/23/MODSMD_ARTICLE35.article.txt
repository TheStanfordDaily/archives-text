# Walker's Homer Hoists Dodgers Into Lead
## Undefeated Farm Golf Team Favored to Win Championship 
### 
Stanford's undefeated golf team enters the Southern Division individual
and team championships today, heavily favored to resume their cham
pionship streak of seven straight titles.
The Indians will take on U.C.L.A., U.S.C., and Cal in 30 holes of medal
play to decide the champion golf team of the Southern Division. Friday
the eight low men will go into match â™¦

play to decide the individual cham
pion, the finals to be played in 3G
holes on Saturday.
Two weeks ago the Cards met the
Bruins and the Trojans in Los An
geles, easily defeating the Uclans,
27-0, and downing S.C., lG'/u to 10Vjj.
With the initial advantage of play
ing on their own course, the Stan
ford golfers should be able to take
both of the southern teams in tow
today, but Cal is still a question
mark.
Stanford will be represented by
Frank McCann, Tom Lambie, who
has a 70 to his credit on the Stan
ford course, Jack Shuler, with a 72,
Bob Rosburg, Bob Cardinal, Gor
don Dotzour, and Bill Savage.
Both U.S.C. and Cal may provide
dangerous opposition but, with
probably the best golfers on the
coast, Stanford should take its
eighth straight title.
