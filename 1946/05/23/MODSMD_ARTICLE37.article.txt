If A 1 Nimiec is successful in forc
ing the Seattle Rainiers to rehire
him for one more season on the
basis that the G.I. Bill of Rights
was violated, what's going to hap
pen to all the players who were re
leased from ball clubs after they
returned from the armed services.
The San Francisco Seals drop
ped a number of performers who
had contracts with the cluli be
fore the war, but couldn't make
the grade after a month's pre
season trial. Other teams have
been following the same pattern:
Give all players who were with
the club before the war a chance to
show their diamond wares, and if
they don't show promise, release
them or farm them out.
Baseball is not like any job,
where any man can fit in after some
training. Baseball is highly com- j
petitive, and it's not a matter of hir- :
ing Joe, and firing Sam.
To this writer's way of think
ing, Nimiec is using the G.I. Bill
as an excuse to get his old job
back. Under normal circum
stances. he wouldn't have beefed
publicly in the slightest if he had
been released. Seattle gave him
a trial at the beginning of the
season, and apparently there weue
other players with the club who
were of higher caliber than he.
If Seattle has no use for his tal- |
cnts, then they shouldn't be forced
to keep him on the payroll. Nimiec j
claims that he wasn't given a fair j
trial. Certainly no government offi- |
cials can uphold that viewpoint. It j
is the privilege of every baseball 1
club to use its own discretion in
choosing its players.
If Seattle baseball owners had :
felt that Nimiec would have bene
fitted the club in their efforts this I
season, they would have kept him
on the roster. Obviously they felt |
otherwise, and released him.
If the courts set a precedent, |
and order Seattle to rehire the
veteran second baseman, a dan
gerous pattern will: be set. For
then any player can. claim "em
ployment for one season with the
club he was originally connected
with, whether that club has any
use for him or not. At least there
will be a lot of bench-warmers
around.

Spring football practice bows out
Saturday afternoon with an infor
mal scrimmage planned by Coach
Marchie Schwartz. For six weeks,
the pigskinners have quietly been
going through their paces, attempt
ing to master the intricacies of the
T-formation.
Unlike normal seasons, when a
team's chances for the next sea
son could be sized up fairly well
after spring practice had ended,
no one cares to hazard a guess on
the fortunes of the '40 Stanford
team.
The best working backfield com
bination found this quarter by
Schwartz features Frankie Forbes
at quarterback. Gene Martin at full
back. and Don Lipelt and Fred Par
sons at the halfback posts.
Don Zappatini, ace backfield man
in '43, has stated that he'll be out
for football in the fall. Buck Faw
cett, who needs no introduction at
this school, may play if he is out of
the Army in time.
To this list of prospective candi
dates must be added other names
of previous Stanford men return
ing, as well as transfers and fresh
men.
As they say in Econ—so I've been
told—there are innumerable vari
ables at work.

If A 1 Nimiec is successful in forc
ing the Seattle Rainiers to rehire
him for one more season on the
basis that the G.I. Bill of Rights
was violated, what's going to hap
pen to all the players who were re
leased from ball clubs after they
returned from the armed services.
The San Francisco Seals drop
ped a number of performers who
had contracts with the cluli be
fore the war, but couldn't make
the grade after a month's pre
season trial. Other teams have
been following the same pattern:
Give all players who were with
the club before the war a chance to
show their diamond wares, and if
they don't show promise, release
them or farm them out.
Baseball is not like any job,
where any man can fit in after some
training. Baseball is highly com- j
petitive, and it's not a matter of hir- :
ing Joe, and firing Sam.
To this writer's way of think
ing, Nimiec is using the G.I. Bill
as an excuse to get his old job
back. Under normal circum
stances. he wouldn't have beefed
publicly in the slightest if he had
been released. Seattle gave him
a trial at the beginning of the
season, and apparently there weue
other players with the club who
were of higher caliber than he.
If Seattle has no use for his tal- |
cnts, then they shouldn't be forced
to keep him on the payroll. Nimiec j
claims that he wasn't given a fair j
trial. Certainly no government offi- |
cials can uphold that viewpoint. It j
is the privilege of every baseball 1
club to use its own discretion in
choosing its players.
If Seattle baseball owners had :
felt that Nimiec would have bene
fitted the club in their efforts this I
season, they would have kept him
on the roster. Obviously they felt |
otherwise, and released him.
If the courts set a precedent, |
and order Seattle to rehire the
veteran second baseman, a dan
gerous pattern will: be set. For
then any player can. claim "em
ployment for one season with the
club he was originally connected
with, whether that club has any
use for him or not. At least there
will be a lot of bench-warmers
around.

Spring football practice bows out
Saturday afternoon with an infor
mal scrimmage planned by Coach
Marchie Schwartz. For six weeks,
the pigskinners have quietly been
going through their paces, attempt
ing to master the intricacies of the
T-formation.
Unlike normal seasons, when a
team's chances for the next sea
son could be sized up fairly well
after spring practice had ended,
no one cares to hazard a guess on
the fortunes of the '40 Stanford
team.
The best working backfield com
bination found this quarter by
Schwartz features Frankie Forbes
at quarterback. Gene Martin at full
back. and Don Lipelt and Fred Par
sons at the halfback posts.
Don Zappatini, ace backfield man
in '43, has stated that he'll be out
for football in the fall. Buck Faw
cett, who needs no introduction at
this school, may play if he is out of
the Army in time.
To this list of prospective candi
dates must be added other names
of previous Stanford men return
ing, as well as transfers and fresh
men.
