## 
### 
Question on the University's plan
to co-ordinate men's living groups !
groups with eating facilities arose
when resident assistants from men's,
halls were informed of the plan at <
a meeting with Stanley L. Sharp, ,
dean of housing, Tuesday night.
STATEMENT READ
R.A.'s from Madison, Tyler, Jack
son, Jefferson, and MeKinley halls ;
told the Daily last night that Mr. i
Sharp had definitely said then that ;
the proposal had been approved and
was to go into effect summer quar- j
ter.
The men questioned quoted Mr. |
Sharp as saying resident assistants i
were to receive a mimeographed |
statement in the mail this morning ;
which R.A.'s were to post on hall ;
bulletin boards. The statement was I
read at the meeting and contained
an outline of the proposal as well as
Mr. Stalnaker's announcement on j
eating plans.
R.A.'S PROTEST
Both Mr. Stalnaker and Mr. Sharp !
denied to the Daily that any definite j
date had been set for mailing the I
statement. Mr. Stalnaker earlier 1
denied any knowledge of the state- j
ment, later adding that he "had ;
heard of it" but that it was under j
Mr. Sharp's jurisdiction. He said j
he did not know what the state- '
ment said.
Discontent, and disapproval of the '
proposal were voiced by the rcsi- j
dent assistants questioned. Mark
Ncuhof and Bob Bclzer, of Madison i
and Jefferson halls, stated that they
had talked to Mr. Stalnaker for an j
hour yesterday morning, and that'
at no time during the meeting was j
final passing of the plan denied.
