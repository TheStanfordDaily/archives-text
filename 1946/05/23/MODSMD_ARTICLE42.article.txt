### 
NEW YORK, May 22 (UP). —They hoisted the steins high in Brooklyn
tonight for Dixie Walker, the "Mayor of Ebbets Field," who put the
Dodgers at least 'temporarily in first place by breaking up a l.'S-inning
game with a double that beat the Chicago Cubs, 2 to I.
It had been anybody's ball game frdtn the start as left-handers Joe

Hatten of the Brooks and Johnny
Schmitz of the Cubs hooked up in 1
one of those unyielding pitching !
duels.
ANYBODY'S GAME
And it was anybody's ball game I
when Walker, the "people's cherce," j
stepped to the plate in the 13th. But j
he promptly made it Brooklyn
property with a slashing two-base
hit that sent the singling Dick Whit- j
man home with the clincher.
So hot was the battle that two
ol baseball's better pugilists, Ed
die Stanky of the Dodgers and
Lennic Mcrullo of the Cubs,
fought a one-round draw at sec
ond base in a rhubarb in the 10th
inning. Both were expelled from !
the game.
The Philadelphia Phils, still low
ly but no longer futile, ran their
winning "streak" to two straight j
games by beating the visiting Pi- 1
rates, 6 to 2, on Lyn (Schoolboy) j
Rowe's pitching and hitting. It was j
the first time this year that the '
Phils had won more than one game
in a row. Rowe drove in two runs |
with a pair of doubles and scored j
two more himself, while holding ;
Pittsburgh to eight hits. Third base
man Gene Handley of Pittsburgh
suffered cheek and chin cuts when
he crashed into a fence trying to
get a foul ball in the eighth.
WILLIAMS HOMERS
Ted Williams, hitless in his first
five times up, smote a 12th-inning
homer at Cleveland to give Boston
a 7 to 4 victory in an uphill battle.
The Indians took a 3 to 0 lead off
Lefty Mickey Harris, trying for his
eighth straight victory, but Boston
whittled the margin and outfielder
Johnny Lazor sent the game into
extra innings with a homer in the
ninth that tied the score at 3—all.
Each team scored in the 11th. John- <
ny Pesky singled for the Sox in the '
12th and Williams followed with
his homer. Bobby Doerr's double
and Lazor's single provided the 1
third run.
The Yankees beat the Tigers. 5
to 3, at Detroit but hist the serv
ices of Manager Joe McCarthy and
outfielder Tommy Hcnrich. Mc-
Carthy suffered a gall bladder at
tack and may be away from the
team for several days. Hcnrich
was spiked in a wild and Woolly
triple play by the Yankees in the
eighth in which the outfielder
came in to back up the inficldcrs

in running down Tiger base run
ners.
CHISOX BEAT A S
The White Sox topped the Ath
letics, 5 to 4, at Chicago, scoring
the winning run in the ninth on
successive doubles by Don Kollo
way and Murrell Jones. A three
run triple by Sam Chapman in the
seventh was the main Philadelphia
scoring punch. Relief pitcher Earl
Caldwell gained his first win of the
season for the Chisox.
