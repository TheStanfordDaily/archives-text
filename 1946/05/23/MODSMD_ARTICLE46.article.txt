# Rail Strike Starts 4 p.m.; Settlement Chances Dim
## Labor Leaders Balk at Truman Offer; Last-Minute Meeting This Morning 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 22 (CP). —Leaders of the railway trainmen and
engineers' union balked tonight at President Truman's last-minute pro
posal to settle their dispute with the carriers, lessening considerably the
chances that the railroad strike set for tomorrow afternoon could be
averted.
Only White House intervention kept the angry union chiefs from re-

turning to their headquarters in"
Cleveland.
The two labor heads, A. F. Whit
ney of the trainmen's union and Al
vanley Johnston of the locomotive
engineers, bitterly denounced the
President's compromise proposal of
a wage boost of 18 1 *> cents an hour.
They said it was conditioned on
their waiver of other demands for
changes in operating rules and that
as a whole it was worse than the
recommendations of Mr. Truman's
fact-finding board—which they re
jected more than a month ago.
lIINT STRIKE SURE
Hinting strongly that they would
permit the once-postponed strike to
go ahead on schedule at 4 p.m. (Lo
cal Standard Time) tomorrow, they
checked out of their Washington
hotel and raced for the 8:30 p.m.
train to Cleveland.
They were intercepted at the sta
tion by a telephone call from the
White House and agreed reluctantly
for a final meeting with Mr. Tru
man tomorrow morning, when they
will answer his proposal.
MAY COMPROMISE
Barring an unexpected change of
attitude on the part of the two un
ion officials, or an even less prob
able in Mr. Truman's settlement of
fer, there appeared only the slim
mest chance of heading off the na
tion's first major train strike since
1926.
There was a possibility, however,
that Whitney and Johnston might
decide to back down gracefully from
their present position and accept a
face-saving compromise when they
meet the President tomorrow.
