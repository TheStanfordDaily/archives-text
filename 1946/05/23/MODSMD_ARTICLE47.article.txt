# Miners Refuse To Work for U.S.
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. May 22 (UP).â€”
An esitmated 100,000 soft coal min
ers remained out of the federal
operated mines today as government
officials worked against time to get
an interim contract with UMW boss
John L. Lewis before the two-week
strike truce expires Saturday night.
On this first day of goevrnment
mine operation, one-fourth of the
UMW's 400,000 miners were stand
ing firmly by their union dictum of
"no contract, no work," despite
Lewis' order to keep working until
the truce ends.
WALKOUT SATURDAY
However, Coal Administrator J.
A. Krug expressed hope that an
agreement could be reached on the
principles of a wage contract with
the United Mine Workers in time
to avert another nationwide walk
out at midnight Saturday.
At the same time, he expressed
fear that miners now idle would not
return to work and that those now
working would not stay on the job
after Saturday unless they are asked
to do so by UMW President John
L. Lewis.
Krug disclosed that Lewis had
submitted the union's proposals, in
cluding one on wages which never
had been submitted to the mine op
erators in the prolonged negotia
tions before government seizure of
the mines.
He said the UMW chieftain had
submitted "everything in terms of
discussion" and made clear that the
proposals were interrelated. Union
proposals will be kept confidential
temporarily, Krug said.
