# Espinosa To Retire In June
## Professor Spent 36 Years at Farm 
### PAULA NUSSER 
Alter 36 years on the Stanford
faculty, Professor Aurelio M. Es
pinosa, head of the Romanic Lan
guages Department, will retire at
the end of spring quarter.
Professor Espinosa, who came to
Stanford from the" University of
Chicago in 1910, has taught under
every Farm President from Dr. Da
vid Starr Jordan to Dr. Donald B.
Tresidder.
Professor Espinosa's most out
standing contribution in his field —
Spanish folk lore—was the natural
result of his childhood spent in New
Mexico, where the Spanish and In
dian background of the country lent
itself to legend. He has traveled ex
tensively in both Spain and Cuba.
In fact, it was one of Professor Es
pinosa's articles on dialects, pub
lished in Europe, that provoked Pro
fessor John Matzke, then head of the
Romanic Languages Department, to
offer the 29-year-old instructor an
assistant professorship.
CHANGES IN FARM
"It was the glamor of your state
that first attracted my wife and me
on our arrival in California," Pro
fessor Espinosa said. "As I came to
know Stanford I found it was the
spirit of productive research that
really impressed me." He found
Stanford was definitely a university
which encouraged its instructors to
do independent study and research.
In noting the differences between
Stanford of the early 1900's and the
Stanford of today, Professor Espi
nosa remarked that the most noted
change was in the relationship be
tween professor and student.
"The end of the major system at
Stanford marked the end of a close
relationship between student and
instructor," Professor Espinosa said, i
"Students used to come to our home '
before going to the reg office, and
Mrs. Espinosa and I used to feel as
if we really knew every student
majoring in the department."
STUDENTS MORE BLASE
A student's department was his
home under the old system, accord
ing to Professor Espinosa.
"They even used to help us cook," [
he added, "but now they think that
going into our kitchen would be a
violation of a social rule."
Stanford students are today even
better informed than their prede- j
cessors, contended the Spanish pro- i
fessor. He said that today's students j
may be a little more blase, but that |
the students of the '10's and '20\s
were a little too naive.
During the last five years of war, I
Professor Espinosa pointed out, |
Stanford has lost sight of some of j
its fine prewar objectives, but he i
expressed confidence that the Uni
versity would now return to its
high standards of learning and re
search.
GARDEN. FISHING HOBBIES
Professor Espinosa concluded with !
a smile that with his teaching, re- ■
search, and a little victory garden- j
ing and fishing, he and his family [
could have found such happiness !
nowhere else.
"Mrs. Espinosa and I have said," I
he remarked, "that if we had 36 '
more years to do with as we choose,
we would undoubtedly spend them
exactly as we have spent the last
36."
