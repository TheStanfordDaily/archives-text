# Student Trip To Prague OK
## 
### 
Two Stanford men will be sent
to Prague this summer as observers
at the World Student Congress, a
worldwide organization aimed at a
permanent world student govern
ment. Financial support up to $000
for each representative for this ven
ture will be sought from local or
ganizations and alumni, supple
mented by A.S.S.U. funds, Excom
decided last night.

Any men students interested in
attending the Congress from Stan
lord should see Bob Kennedy to
day, as appointments will he made
at tonight's Excom election meet
ing.

Pies and cakes will be stricken
from the Union and Encina Cellar j
menus during the afternoqn and
evening periods of sale as a result
of a student-approved recommen
dation. Excom asked that all stu
dents eliminate wheat foods—rolls |
and doughnuts—from their Cellar
sessions in keeping with the current j
and vital food conservation cam
paign.
Charged with insufficient cover- j
age in campus publicity stories, the {
Stanford Daily was called upon by |
an eight - man bloc to revise its j
news policy. "Too much United I
Press copy, not enough all-campus J
publicity" was the complaint. Ann j
Lilienthal stated that the Con Home j
Drive had not reached its last year's j
total in collections, and the blame I
was laid by Cardinals to the Daily's |
treatment of the drive.
Said A.S.S.U. President Ken
nedy: "After all, students can i
read United Press in the city pa- '
pers. Maybe you consider Iran
and all that to be vital issues— ;
but I don't."
Daily representatives present an- j
swered that as a newspaper, it was j
the Daily's function to present as
complete a news coverage as pos
sible in its limited space to a read- i
crship of over 6.000 persons having !
immediate access to no other morn
ing daily.
