# RAIL STRIKE STALLS NATION
## U.S. Food Supply Periled; President Slates New Parley 
### 
CHICAGO, May 21 (Friday) (UP). —A rail
road strike of trainmen and engineers paralyzed
the nation's 227,000-mile rail system early today
and dealt a knockout blow at industry and coni
meree.
The strike tied up nearly all trains, stranding
millions, curtailed the mails and other essential
services, threatened imminent food shortages, and
caused a wave of plant shutdowns and unemploy
ment which Assistant Postmaster General Gael Sul
livan predicted would bring "civil insurrection
difti cult to f|uelT' unless a settlement is reached
within to 72 hours.
The great steel mills in the Pittsburgh area began banking
their furnaces.
Executives, Employees Man Trains
The food supply in metropolitan areas was threatened. Short
ages were expected within two or three days.
An estimated 600 striking rail employes charge in a Logans
port, Ind., meeting that the Pennsylvania Railroad had violated
the "full crew" law by taking a 19-car train from here, en route
to Chicago, with two nonunion crew members aboard.
As the hours passed, railroad employees and executives took
out additional trains.
An example of, how they were operating trains was the
Union Pacific's "The City of San Francisco." The train, sched
used to leave at 6 p.m., left at 6:43 p.m. from Northwestern Sta
tion, Chicago, with Ray Kennard, road foreman of engineers, at
the controls. Bill Roberts, superintendent of safety, was flagman.
The Erie Railroad's mainline New York-Chicago trains left
Hornell, N. Y., manned by executives whose business attire was
supplemented only by gloves.
National Economic Strangulation Feared
The strike began at 4 p.m. in the eastern time belt when the
heads of the Railroad Trainmen and Locomotive Engineer broth
erhoods failed to reach an agreement in a last minute effort by
the White House to avert the strike.
The rail movement of perishable foods and livestock had
slowed to a trickle, bringing a threat of imminent shortages in
the larger cities of the nation.
Tieing up freight, the strike slashed the tonnage of raw mate
rials, which in a short time would force the shutdown of factories,
spreading unemployment and confronting the entire nation with
economic stagnation.
Airline pilots were alerted to stand by to man planes foi use
in the strike emergency, carrying essential supplies.
