# Two Coast Lines Move Limiteds
## 
### United Press 
Both Southern Pacific and North -
rni Pacific defied the nationwide
rail strike Thursday night, when
they moved crack limiteds out of
West. Coast, terminals headed for
Chicago.
But despite (he operation of
such select schedules, a creeping
paralysis beset the operations of
eight major roads feeding the Pa
cific ('oast. Only a few local,
emergency, and military units
moved under agreement hy union
operators.
Southern Pacific sent its City of
San Francisco out of Oakland at 8:17
p.m., and less than an hour later
the Northern Pacific's North Coast
Limited began its eastern run from
Seattle. Both had non-union super
visory personnel al the throttles.
Great Northern officials in Seattle
also announced that the Fast Mail,
No. 28, would leave on schedule at
11:45 p.m. for St. Paul.
Western Pacific officials tried in
vain to find a crew to move its
transcontinental Exposition Flier out
of Oakland at. 4 p.m. today and,
failing, took the passengers off and
returned them to San Francisco.
The rail strike posed a crip
pling threat to California's can
ning and agricultural industry
with losses scheduled to run into
the millions if the trains are
stopped for many days.
The State Chamber of Commerce
said fruit and vegetable processing,
already hampered by jurisdictional
labor disputes, would feel the ef
fects of the stoppage for months af
ter resumption of train service.
The strike brought an early rush
for commuter trains up and down
the coast to beat the 4 p.m. dead
line. In San Francisco, where an
estimated 5,000 home - goers were
stranded without their Peninsula
trains, city transit officials an
nounced additional streetcars would
be placed on the Peninsula run.
$200,000 LOSS LOOMS
In the Stockton-Lodi area, the
Chamber said, shippers are now
moving 25 carloads of cherries daily.
Santa Clara Valley cherries were
reported nearly ready for market.
A loss of $200,000 daily was pre
dicted in the Salinas - Monterey-
Watsonville lettuce and vegetable
growing area. Plums, now ripening,
apricots, peaches, and pears totaling
some 20,000 carloads, also were
threatened.
Alert office workers and business
executives in San Francisco, who
watched their newspaper headlines,
rushed for the Southern Pacific de
pot at Third and Townsend when it
became apparent the strike would
go on as scheduled.
LOCALS CRAMMED
They swarmed out of taxis, buses,
anfl streetcars far in advance of the
usual 5 p.m. home-goers' rush to
catch the 3:05 commuters' special to
San Jose, lengthened on orders of
Stationmaster Guy Hassam from
five to 12 cars.
An estimated 1,700 of them made
it by pushing and shoving and
taking up every available bit of
space on the train, including vesti
bules and washrooms. The five-car
3:05 normally carries 500 persons.
