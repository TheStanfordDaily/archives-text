Where does The Stanford Daily stand on
news-policy?
Right where any newspaper which offers
its readers the best in news coverage takes
its stand:
We believe that the only coverage that is
worth a rap extends to all news—local, na
tional, and international—one which attempts
to present to the readers a picture of what is
going on in the rest of the world as well as
within our own small community.
To isolate ourselves by cutting outside
nev/s from the one paper which reaches
every person on would constitute the
first step up the stairs of that dizzily tottering
Ivory Tower . . . and a step which no think
ing member of the student body would take.
The argument that The Daily is the only
paper on campus and therefore has to serve
as a bulletin board or publicity sheet is a
kind of folly.
Smce The Daily is more widely read on
campus than San Francisco papers, it must
assume partial responsibility for broadening
student interests beyond the arches of the
Quad, or the road to Rossotti's.
It strikes us as a bit pitiful that some mem
bers of the student body object to the 6 per
cent average of total news space that is de
voted to United Press dispatches. And we
wonder how many of the objectors would
take the time to read a Chronicle or a News
every d<*y if The Daily U.P. service were
dropped.
As for news-play, in the last two-week pe
riod the top play of the day has been dis
tributed as follows: food conservation, 1;
coal strike, 2; Con Home, 3; elections, 4. That
is far from an over-emphasis on non-local af

fairs . . . particularly when one considers that
the coal strike eventually would affect di
rectly the transportation, communication, and
daily activities of all 5,000 Stanford students.
As far as publicity for campus events goes,
The Daily wants to be as helpful as possible
with its share of the responsibility for in
forming the students on what's going on
around the Farm. But space limitations, which
can't be changed until more newsprint be
comes available, make it impossible to give
every group on campus the amount of public
ity that they demand.
We make the suggestion that any organ
ization which feels that its projects aren't
getting maximum response, look to its own
laurels. A paper is mainly devoted to the
reporting of the news and should not be ex
pected to carry the full load of publicity
when other channels such as posters and
stunts, are not being utilized "because they're
too much work."
Our policy in the past has been to evaluate
news on the basis of timeliness and the num
ber of persons it concerns. With occasional
slip-ups, this has meant that all-campus
events get played up over smaller events,
and that in most cases the space allotted
must be small. We will continue to stick by
this policy as fairly and consistently as pos
sible.
But if some dance stories neglect to tell
how many gardenias will be floating in the
punch Saturday night, and in that space a
United Press caption tells how many persons
will die tomorrow in China of malnutrition;
we think the majority of the student body
will support our general policies of news
evaluation.

evaluation.
Where does The Stanford Daily stand on
news-policy?
Right where any newspaper which offers
its readers the best in news coverage takes
its stand:
We believe that the only coverage that is
worth a rap extends to all news—local, na
tional, and international—one which attempts
to present to the readers a picture of what is
going on in the rest of the world as well as
within our own small community.
To isolate ourselves by cutting outside
nev/s from the one paper which reaches
every person on would constitute the
first step up the stairs of that dizzily tottering
Ivory Tower . . . and a step which no think
ing member of the student body would take.
The argument that The Daily is the only
paper on campus and therefore has to serve
as a bulletin board or publicity sheet is a
kind of folly.
Smce The Daily is more widely read on
campus than San Francisco papers, it must
assume partial responsibility for broadening
student interests beyond the arches of the
Quad, or the road to Rossotti's.
It strikes us as a bit pitiful that some mem
bers of the student body object to the 6 per
cent average of total news space that is de
voted to United Press dispatches. And we
wonder how many of the objectors would
take the time to read a Chronicle or a News
every d<*y if The Daily U.P. service were
dropped.
As for news-play, in the last two-week pe
riod the top play of the day has been dis
tributed as follows: food conservation, 1;
coal strike, 2; Con Home, 3; elections, 4. That
is far from an over-emphasis on non-local af

fairs . . . particularly when one considers that
the coal strike eventually would affect di
rectly the transportation, communication, and
daily activities of all 5,000 Stanford students.
As far as publicity for campus events goes,
The Daily wants to be as helpful as possible
with its share of the responsibility for in
forming the students on what's going on
around the Farm. But space limitations, which
can't be changed until more newsprint be
comes available, make it impossible to give
every group on campus the amount of public
ity that they demand.
We make the suggestion that any organ
ization which feels that its projects aren't
getting maximum response, look to its own
laurels. A paper is mainly devoted to the
reporting of the news and should not be ex
pected to carry the full load of publicity
when other channels such as posters and
stunts, are not being utilized "because they're
too much work."
Our policy in the past has been to evaluate
news on the basis of timeliness and the num
ber of persons it concerns. With occasional
slip-ups, this has meant that all-campus
events get played up over smaller events,
and that in most cases the space allotted
must be small. We will continue to stick by
this policy as fairly and consistently as pos
sible.
But if some dance stories neglect to tell
how many gardenias will be floating in the
punch Saturday night, and in that space a
United Press caption tells how many persons
will die tomorrow in China of malnutrition;
we think the majority of the student body
will support our general policies of news
evaluation.
