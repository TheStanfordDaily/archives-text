NOT OF THE WORLD?
May 23, 194G
How glad I am that this is election day! For
this morning I read in the Daily that our present
A.S.S.U. president, Bob Kennedy, thinks our fine
paper runs too much world news and not enough
all-campus news. As he put it:
"After ail, students can read United Press in
ihe city papers. Maybe you consider Iran and all
that to be vital issues, but I don't." I couldn't be
lieve for a few minutes that he really meant what
he said, but it seems apparent that he is still think
ing in terms of the Ivory Tower for which Stanford
has been so rightly criticized.
Let us hope and fervently pray that we have
the farsightedness to elect someone this year who
will think that the Iranian problem is vital and
not something so far removed from Stanford as
to appear non-existent or unimportant. By this
time we should all have realized that such issues
can be the beginnings of strife and that the con
stant re-occurrence of unresolvahle misunder
standings can lead to war.
This letter is my way of expressing my feelings
about Stanford's place as a territory so set apart
from the rest of the world that we agree in letter
to help the other fellow, but so seldom do so in
action. It is fine to have feelings for the tragedy of
the children of the world, and to give up bread at
two meals a day, but that is passive feeling.
Wh?n you had that 10 a.m. cup of coffee did you
think that you were taking bread of those who
really needed it, when you bit into that doughnut
or that roll? Did you write to tell your parents that
we saved 400 pounds of flour in giving up bread for
just one meal a day in one Multiply that by
two or three times a day for many weeks and by
families all over the country and you can see how
much more wheat can be sent to Europe without
hurting our large diets to any great extent.
I hope we here at Stanford can get rid of the
narrow idea that we are exclusive and therefore
not of the world.

FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING

For a long time Stanford has been regarded as
one of the finest universities in the country—fine
in its strength, its traditions, its spirit. Perhaps it
is time for us to stop and ask ourselves: What is

it that makes a fine university?
Many factors enter into this picture, and
among the most important of these are the
qualities of understanding, co-operation, trust,
and faith in each other. These are the elements
which have gone into the making of the Stanford
Family, the qualities which have distinguished
Stanford throughout the years.
Students, faculty, and administrative officers
make up our Stanford Family. When there Ls mis
understanding between these groups, the result is
a weaker Stanford.
Perhaps the "let's sling mud at the Adminis
tration" attitude which was all too prevalent in the
recent election campaign was "good politics." But
we seriously question whether it was good for
Stanford. We believe that the men and women
<>n the administrative staff have one object lore
most in their minds: to work for the best interests
of Stanford students. They have shown their faith
in us by giving an independent, powerful student
government. Are we showing the same faith in
them?
Our student government should have as its
foremost aim the maintenance of a strong Stan
ford — and we are sure that is the sincere intent
of those students now holding offices and those
who ran for offices in the election. But we cannot
keep that strength and spirit by erecting barriers
between the different groups in the Stanford
Family. We must work for understanding and
co-operation, not antagonism.

NOT OF THE WORLD?
May 23, 194G
How glad I am that this is election day! For
this morning I read in the Daily that our present
A.S.S.U. president, Bob Kennedy, thinks our fine
paper runs too much world news and not enough
all-campus news. As he put it:
"After ail, students can read United Press in
ihe city papers. Maybe you consider Iran and all
that to be vital issues, but I don't." I couldn't be
lieve for a few minutes that he really meant what
he said, but it seems apparent that he is still think
ing in terms of the Ivory Tower for which Stanford
has been so rightly criticized.
Let us hope and fervently pray that we have
the farsightedness to elect someone this year who
will think that the Iranian problem is vital and
not something so far removed from Stanford as
to appear non-existent or unimportant. By this
time we should all have realized that such issues
can be the beginnings of strife and that the con
stant re-occurrence of unresolvahle misunder
standings can lead to war.
This letter is my way of expressing my feelings
about Stanford's place as a territory so set apart
from the rest of the world that we agree in letter
to help the other fellow, but so seldom do so in
action. It is fine to have feelings for the tragedy of
the children of the world, and to give up bread at
two meals a day, but that is passive feeling.
Wh?n you had that 10 a.m. cup of coffee did you
think that you were taking bread of those who
really needed it, when you bit into that doughnut
or that roll? Did you write to tell your parents that
we saved 400 pounds of flour in giving up bread for
just one meal a day in one Multiply that by
two or three times a day for many weeks and by
families all over the country and you can see how
much more wheat can be sent to Europe without
hurting our large diets to any great extent.
I hope we here at Stanford can get rid of the
narrow idea that we are exclusive and therefore
not of the world.

FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING

For a long time Stanford has been regarded as
one of the finest universities in the country—fine
in its strength, its traditions, its spirit. Perhaps it
is time for us to stop and ask ourselves: What is

it that makes a fine university?
Many factors enter into this picture, and
among the most important of these are the
qualities of understanding, co-operation, trust,
and faith in each other. These are the elements
which have gone into the making of the Stanford
Family, the qualities which have distinguished
Stanford throughout the years.
Students, faculty, and administrative officers
make up our Stanford Family. When there Ls mis
understanding between these groups, the result is
a weaker Stanford.
Perhaps the "let's sling mud at the Adminis
