ON ENDS AND ODDS
Don Caspar de Portola was an eager Spaniard
who almost but not quite discovered San Francisco
Hay. His party left Mission San Diego in 17U9 to
run down a rumor about a great northern bay.
Fifty miles short of his goal, tho mountain going
became so rough bis party broke downhill along a
thin stream.
In the plain below, beside two lonely redwood
sentinels, his party camped while Portola tried to
get his weary brain to produce the push to move
forward. At the end of the third day the expedi
tion turned south, not knowing they had come
within an ace of discovering the Golden Cate. As
he left, the Spaniard named his camp site Palo
Alto, the "tall tree."

Where San Francisquito Creek crosses El Ca
mino Real the tree still stands. They say it's been

around for 1,000 years.

in 18% the bloomered girls of Stanford played
basketball against California women in tho nation's
first women's intercollegiate athletic contcst. Stan
ford won, 2-1.
No men were allowed in (lie sacred arena, (he
San Francisco Armory. When (he ladies broke
a baske(, (he Berkeley team coyly retired to (heir
dressing rooms so the repairmen would not sec
(he shocking outfits which, although fully cov

contour.
But the Stanford ladies stuck it out, and the
resulting hullaballoo caused a 10-year ban on such
contests.
