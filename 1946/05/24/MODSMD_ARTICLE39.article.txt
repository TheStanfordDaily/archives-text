# Card Baseball Team Host To Camp Beale Nine Saturday
## 
### BREWCE ARMS 
Coach Harry Wolter's Stanford |
baseballers go after their last
chance for a victory, before the Cal
series, tomorrow afternoon at 2:15
at the Sunken Diamond. The po- i
tential victims are the Camp Beale ,
horsehiders from Marysville.
Throughout the season Coach

Wolter has experimented with
different combinations of players, ;
and last week's combo, with the }
addition of Dob Itosburg at second,
worked fairly well, though the
team dropped two straight games, |
one to Cal and (he other to the
University of San Francisco.
Fielding errors have been the big I
deficit so far this year. Several
games have been thrown away in j
the last inning by some hardly ex- j
disable play. The squad has proved j
it is capable of playing good ball, j
but as yet hasn't been able to put
together nine good innings.
The game tomorrow will be
more than iust a practice joust j
against a service nine. If the
team clips the soldiers from Beale
—or at least gives them a hard !
fight with a minimum of errors,
things will be looking up when
the Bears pay us their visit on ;
next Fridtfy afternoon.
The team has many times proven
itself to be potentially good. To
morrow afternoon is the time for {
that potentiality to be realized.
