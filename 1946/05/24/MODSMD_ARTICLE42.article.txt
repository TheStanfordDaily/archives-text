## Farm betters Host to Bears 
### BOB BULLOCK 
Despite the fact that "Battle of
the Cellar" would be a more appro
priate title, tomorrow's traditional
California-Stanford tennis tilt will
be billed as the big match of the
year. The local courts will be the
scene of the meeting at 1:30.
Net fortunes have been anything
but sensational on both the Farm
and in Berkeley. In fact the only
vital issue at stake in Saturday's
matches will be the ignominous
honor of Conference cellar occu
pancy.
NET HOPES COLLAPSE
All hopes of bringing the net
championship north collapsed last
weekend as both the Bears and
Indians succumbed to the title
hound U.S.C. Trojans. Only ob
stacle remaining* in the Troy path
to glory is crosstovvn rival brother
Bruin, who previously fell before
Falkenburg and Company.
Meanwhile the northern duo bat
tle over the crumbs of the season,
both squads still seeking their initial
Conference victory of the year. Sat
urday's battle will be the first of a
pair of Cal-Stanford matches with
the Bears and Indians winding up
their schedules the following week
at Berkeley.
SCORE FAVORS INDIANS
Comparative scores seem to favor
Coach Bugge's Cardinal squad, but
(he possible loss of king-pin Indian
Arnie Beisser, may swing betting
odds over to the California cause.
At any rate, Beisser will be operat
ing only under handicap due to a
painful shoulder injury inflicted in
the U.S.C. series.
Beisser's absence or presence
may easily prove the margin of
victory due to his amazing sin
gles record of having yet to be de
feated in two years of collegiate
play. On the other hand, Cam
eron Fair, Berkeley number one
man, has experienced a rocky sea
son, falling before Browne of
U.C.L.A. and Perez of U.S.C.
Closest that either Bay area ag
gregation has come to the win col
umn, in Conference play was in the
early season Stanford 3-6 loss to the
Bruins. On the same expedition,
U.C.L.A. slammed out an 8-1 ad
vantage over California. The ques
tion seems to evolve into "the lesser
of two evils."
MATCHES CONSIDERED
Also the C.O.P. matches may be
taken into consideration to rank to
morrow's teams, with the Indians
again earning the nod. Twice the
Bears have fallen before the Tigers,
while Stanford boasts a pair of nar
row triumphs over the Stockton
school.

(he possible loss of king-pin Indian
Arnie Beisser, may swing betting
odds over to the California cause.
At any rate, Beisser will be operat
ing only under handicap due to a
painful shoulder injury inflicted in
the U.S.C. series.
Beisser's absence or presence
may easily prove the margin of
victory due to his amazing sin
gles record of having yet to be de
feated in two years of collegiate
play. On the other hand, Cam
eron Fair, Berkeley number one
man, has experienced a rocky sea
son, falling before Browne of
U.C.L.A. and Perez of U.S.C.
Closest that either Bay area ag
gregation has come to the win col
umn, in Conference play was in the
early season Stanford 3-6 loss to the
Bruins. On the same expedition,
U.C.L.A. slammed out an 8-1 ad
vantage over California. The ques
tion seems to evolve into "the lesser
of two evils."
MATCHES CONSIDERED
Also the C.O.P. matches may be
taken into consideration to rank to
morrow's teams, with the Indians
again earning the nod. Twice the
Bears have fallen before the Tigers,
while Stanford boasts a pair of nar
row triumphs over the Stockton
school.
Despite the fact that "Battle of
the Cellar" would be a more appro
priate title, tomorrow's traditional
California-Stanford tennis tilt will
be billed as the big match of the
year. The local courts will be the
scene of the meeting at 1:30.
Net fortunes have been anything
but sensational on both the Farm
and in Berkeley. In fact the only
vital issue at stake in Saturday's
matches will be the ignominous
honor of Conference cellar occu
pancy.
NET HOPES COLLAPSE
All hopes of bringing the net
championship north collapsed last
weekend as both the Bears and
Indians succumbed to the title
hound U.S.C. Trojans. Only ob
stacle remaining* in the Troy path
to glory is crosstovvn rival brother
Bruin, who previously fell before
Falkenburg and Company.
Meanwhile the northern duo bat
tle over the crumbs of the season,
both squads still seeking their initial
Conference victory of the year. Sat
urday's battle will be the first of a
pair of Cal-Stanford matches with
the Bears and Indians winding up
their schedules the following week
at Berkeley.
SCORE FAVORS INDIANS
Comparative scores seem to favor
Coach Bugge's Cardinal squad, but
(he possible loss of king-pin Indian
Arnie Beisser, may swing betting
odds over to the California cause.
