# Indian Toilers Engage Bear Fencers Saturday
## 
### 
Indian sports fans will be offered
something out of the ordinary to
morrow morning at JO a.m. as the
fencing teams of California and
Stanford meet in the Pavilion. 0
The Indian fencing team has been
absent from intercollegiate compe
tition since 1942, and will be making
its inaugural 1946 appearance to
morrow. Coach Elwyn Bugge fore
casts an interesting battle, although
the squad is not up to prewar stand
ards.
