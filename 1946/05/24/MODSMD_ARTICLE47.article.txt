# Scrum Session Winds Up Grid
## 
### 
Spring football practice winds up
tomorrow afternoon with an infor
mal scrimmage.
However, Coach Marchie Schwarz
has emphasized that no "regular"
game will be played, as he is op
posed to pre-season performances.
Stanford's gridiron chances for
next season are still an unknown
quantity, as many men are expected
to be out for football next fall who
haven't shown up this spring.
The backfield combination re
mains unsettled. At' the moment,
however, Frankie Forbes has shown
up best at quarterback, and Fred
Parsons and Don Lipelt have shown
well at halfback positions. Gene
Martin, who played right half last
fall, has been switched to fullback.
Students are invited to attend
this informal scrimmage, which
will be played on the practice field.
