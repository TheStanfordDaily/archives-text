# Lanier Goes to Mexico
## 
### 
NEW YORK. May 23 (UP).-The
St. Louis Cardinals tonight lost
three star players including their
best right- and left-handed pitchers
to the Mexican League, and there
appeared to be little hope that any
of them would consider returning
to the club.
The players were southpaw Max
Lanier, leading National League
pitcher with six wins and no de
feats, rookie right - bander Fred
Martin, who has won two games
against one defeat, and second base
man Lou Klein.
There had been some hope that
the players would not make the
jump south of the border, but it was
dissipated when the team returned
to its hotel and found no trace of

them. They had removed their per
sonal belongings from their rooms
and hotel officials said they had
been "gone for hours."
