WASHINGTON, Friday, May 24 (UP). â€”The Senate early today voted
to outlaw company-financed. union-administered welfare funds such as
demanded by Miners' Chief John L. Lewis as his price for keeping the
nation's soft-coal pits operating.
The 4X-to-2!> roll call vote was on an amendment by Sen. Harry F.
Byrd. I).. Va., to a pending strike control bill.
It was a smashing blow al the burly mine union leader who called his
100.000 miners out on strike April 1 because the soft coal industry re
fused to consider bis demands for a union-administered welfare fund.
The proviso is certain of House approval if it reaches that chamber.
The House previously passed a drastic anti-strike bill and a majority of
the members are prepared to go to even greater lengths because of the
coal and rail strikes.
