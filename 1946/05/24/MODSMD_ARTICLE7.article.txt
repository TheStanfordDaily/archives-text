# Rise Stevens 'Captivating'
## 
### TED HOFFMAN 
Rise Stevens' rich mezzo-soprano
voice captivated a packed Memorial
Hall last night.
There Ls a warmth in Miss Ste
vens' voice that is unique. Rarely
does a concert singer perform with
such clarity. Almost every English
word that she sang was intelligible.
But perhaps the most striking
quality of the charming Miss Ste
vens is the restraint with which she
sings. So many singers are carried
away by the sound of their own
voice that by the time they reach
the climax of a song they are
screaming at the top of their lungs,
in a very unartistic way.
M iss Stevens is emotional with
out being gaudy. She accom
plishes a brilliant interpretation
without straining, without utiliz
ing all her reserve.
The lengthy program, largely in a
lighter vein, was well chosen. Par
ticularly popular with the audience
were the perennial "Habanera"
from Carmen, "Mon Coeur s'ouvre
a ta voix" from "Samson and De
lilah," the final encore, Schubert's
"Ave Maria," and most of the short
er concert pieces.
Paul Ulanowsky, her accompanist,
was excellent, never falling into that
irritating habit of playing too loudly
that plagues many accompanists.
His solo group was played with the
utmost finesse and polish.
One adverse note from those of
us who belong to the "Please let's
not have showmanship on the
concert stage" school of thought.
M iss Stevens is an artist. She
doesn't need to turn on personal
acting charm to please a music
loving audience. She doesn't need
to sing "cute" songs like "Hist!
Hist!" which features a kiss ges
ture, which was coy but hardly
necessary.
We just want to hear your glori
ous voice, Rise. You don't need
charming stage gestures to enrap
ture us. Just sing.
