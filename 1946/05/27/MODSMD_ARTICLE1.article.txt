practice field. Men were changed between teams and rain "in-

lerrupled" the last quarter, making
the final store a little hard to deter

been given as 19-13 and 14-13 in
favor of the Blue team.
Although fundamentals were
sloppy, there was promise of better
things ahead for the M 6 edition of
(lie Big Red.
Frankie Forbes may have proved
himself as the man to run the 4 'T"
next year with his snappy passing
and the kind of faking that makes
the "T" click. "Red" Knight hit his
receivers well on long passes, but
showed a need for more practice
under pressure.
In the backfield the surprise of
the day was little Ted Nell who
showed terrific speed in tearing off
gain after gain.

mage, Gene Martin and Wayne
Erickson, alternating from the full
