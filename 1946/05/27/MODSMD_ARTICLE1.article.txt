# Big Red Grid Machine Looks Ragged as Squad Holds Practice Game
## 
### 
Six weeks of gruelling spring footbau practice wound up Sat
urday when the annual inter-team scrimmage v/as held on the
practice field. Men were changed between teams and rain "in-

lerrupled" the last quarter, making
the final store a little hard to deter
mine. Various interpretations have
been given as 19-13 and 14-13 in
favor of the Blue team.
Although fundamentals were
sloppy, there was promise of better
things ahead for the M 6 edition of
(lie Big Red.
Frankie Forbes may have proved
himself as the man to run the 4 'T"
next year with his snappy passing
and the kind of faking that makes
the "T" click. "Red" Knight hit his
receivers well on long passes, but
showed a need for more practice
under pressure.
In the backfield the surprise of
the day was little Ted Nell who
showed terrific speed in tearing off
gain after gain.
MARTIN. ERICKSON ALTERNATE
In the first quarter of the scrim
mage, Gene Martin and Wayne
Erickson, alternating from the full
back and left half, sparked the
Whites over for the first score. Mar
tin made the touchdown, but failed
to convert. The same two, who
played together on the same high
school team in Sioux City, lowa,
again sparked the Whites to their
second tally. Erickson traveled the
final yards 011 an end sweep.
Forbes changed over to the Blues
and put them back in the game. A
toss to end Ed Culin provided the
Blues' initial score. Willie Altus
converted to make it 13-7. Recover
ing a midfield fumble, Knight
passed 20 yards to end Bob Tyler

JIM COX STANDOUT
In the line Jim "Finny" Cox was
easily the standout at tackle. Harry
Varner proved that he will give
Coach Fred Boensch competition
for first string tackle. Bob Roher, a
'42 frosh vet, Jim Dooley, Ted
Burke, and Dave DeSwarte looked
good at the end spot.
Jim Fry and Bob Phelps started
at guard for the White team. Gerry
Ferrari and Don Sawyer, two light
weights, gave a lot of trouble lor
their size. A bad knee kept Har
vey Bernhard out of the scrimmage.
PARSONS RIPS OFF GAINS
Dorsey Kindler and Bill Shirey
showed up well at center. Mickey
Titus, a former all-CIF back at
Beverly Hills high, gave a fine dis
play of offensive blocking. A hold
over from the '41 Frosh team, Fred
Parsons lived up to advanced notices
on many sparkling runs.
Little can be said on where Stan
ford will place next year after
viewing results of the spring toil.
Many of the men expected to hold
important positions next year are
either in service or are out for other
sports. The answer to the question
of where will Stanford rate next
year in football will remain unan
swered until after the opening till
with Idaho next fall.

JIM COX STANDOUT
In the line Jim "Finny" Cox was
easily the standout at tackle. Harry
Varner proved that he will give
Coach Fred Boensch competition
for first string tackle. Bob Roher, a
'42 frosh vet, Jim Dooley, Ted
Burke, and Dave DeSwarte looked
good at the end spot.
Jim Fry and Bob Phelps started
at guard for the White team. Gerry
Ferrari and Don Sawyer, two light
weights, gave a lot of trouble lor
their size. A bad knee kept Har
vey Bernhard out of the scrimmage.
PARSONS RIPS OFF GAINS
Dorsey Kindler and Bill Shirey
showed up well at center. Mickey
Titus, a former all-CIF back at
Beverly Hills high, gave a fine dis
play of offensive blocking. A hold
over from the '41 Frosh team, Fred
Parsons lived up to advanced notices
on many sparkling runs.
Little can be said on where Stan
ford will place next year after
viewing results of the spring toil.
Many of the men expected to hold
important positions next year are
either in service or are out for other

Six weeks of gruelling spring footbau practice wound up Sat
urday when the annual inter-team scrimmage v/as held on the
practice field. Men were changed between teams and rain "in-

lerrupled" the last quarter, making
the final store a little hard to deter
mine. Various interpretations have
been given as 19-13 and 14-13 in
favor of the Blue team.
Although fundamentals were
sloppy, there was promise of better
things ahead for the M 6 edition of
(lie Big Red.
Frankie Forbes may have proved
himself as the man to run the 4 'T"
next year with his snappy passing
and the kind of faking that makes
the "T" click. "Red" Knight hit his
receivers well on long passes, but
showed a need for more practice
under pressure.
In the backfield the surprise of
the day was little Ted Nell who
showed terrific speed in tearing off
gain after gain.
MARTIN. ERICKSON ALTERNATE
In the first quarter of the scrim
mage, Gene Martin and Wayne
Erickson, alternating from the full
