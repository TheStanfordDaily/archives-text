# Cardinal Basketball Squad Experiences Dismal Season
## 
### 
"There'll be some changes made!" i
Which could very well be the
theme song of Coach Everett Dean
following the reinstatment of in
tercollegiate basketball at. the Farm
last quarter.
California and Andy Wolfe look
the coast title and Stanford got
the booby prize, which must have
been quite a comedown for the
softspoken mentor, inasmuch as
his team in '42 was NCAA cham
pion.
Inexperience and injuries were
but two of the things that had the
Cards stymied from the start. The
season was three-quarters over be
fore the same starting lineup put in
two consecutive appearances.
Oddly enough, the locals seemed
to rise to heights way over their
heads when they tangled with the
better teams, whereas they looked
rather pitiful against the weaker
teams. Perhaps it was mere per
versity. but anyone who saw the
last Cal series as contrasted to
the UCLA series realizes full well
that that was exactly what hap

pened.
Midway in the season, the In
dians lost their outstanding player,
Jimmy Hill, an NROTC student
j who was the team's high scorer.
Tom Rodman and Bill Christian-
I son held down the guard slots most
i of the season being spelled by Gene
| Martin, who was moved back from
forward as Hill's running mate, and
Jack Wood.
At center, Bill O'Brien was stand
j out, despite playing very little due
i to the effects of frozen feet; and
1 Tom Murphy, earnest but awkward,
! held the spot most nf the time.
After Hill's departure. Tom
Hood, Jack Meredith and Johnny
iVluir teamed up with Martin at
the u peon it position, with the
last named (up from the jayvecs)
turning in two excellent games in
the final C'al series.
The prospects for next year—and
they can't help but improve—look
{ good, comparatively speaking. Re
turning from the '42 championship
squad will be Howie Dallmar, Dave
I Berlin. Dave Davidson, and Morlcy
! Thompson.
