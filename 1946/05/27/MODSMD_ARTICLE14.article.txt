"Athletics for all" has been and I
still is one of the more important
traditions at Stanford. The intra
mural athletic program has been the
biggest factor in keeping this tra
dition.
This year has been no excep
tion. From the beginning of fall j
quarter to the week before finals
in the spring quarter, the intra
mural program has been going j
full blast.
Intramural sports coincide with j
the intercollegiate program. In the i
fall when the Stanford football team j
tears up the turf in the stadium j
against its Pacific Coast Confer
ence opponents, the intramural j
touch football league will be in full
swing. In winter quarter intramu
ral basketball takes the spotlight.
In spring quarter, intramural j
baseball, track, and tennis all begin, j
This year's baseball and tennis |
championships are still being de- !
cided. The softball playoffs started j
last Thursday and this week they
will come to a close.
Just as intercollegiate athletics, i
intramural sports have their own !
rules and regulations. On May 8 j
the intramural committee of Stan
ford met and discussed the intra- j
mural program for next year. One j
of the many things that came out
of the meeting was that intramural
sports will be emphasized in the
next three quarters as never be
fore. One hundred per cent par
ticipation will be encouraged.
In the coming years things will be
coming back to normal with the fra
ternities getting back their houses
and the various living groups be
coming more organized. Trophies
will be awarded to the victors.
The program will be run strictly
on an organization basis. Every or
ganization will be eligible to enter
teams in the various sports. The in
tramural program will be promoted
by the coaching staff by means of
speeches to the gym classes to in
terest all men who cannot compete
in the intercollegiate program to
enter intramural sports.
The change in lab schedules this
quarter has been a big hindrance to
the intramural program. With the
hours now extending to 5 p.m., even
intercollegiate athletics have been
touched by this change.,
PROBLEM: TOUCH FOOTBALL
Touch football is one of the
big problems in intramural sports.
Some students have been injured
by failing to follow the rules set up
by the Intramural Committee. The
answer to this difficulty seems to
be to have better trained officials.
Emphasized Coach Bugge:
"If the students want touch foot
ball. they will have it."
That is the spirit of the whole
intramural program as it is being
carried on by the coaching staff.

teams in the various sports. The in

by the coaching staff by means of
speeches to the gym classes to in

the intramural program. With the

Some students have been injured

Emphasized Coach Bugge:
"If the students want touch foot
ball. they will have it."
That is the spirit of the whole
