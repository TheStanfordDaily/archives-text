# U.S. Troops Go To Coal Fields As Parley Fails
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 26 (UP).—The U. S. Army ordered
troops into the Kentucky coal fields tonight as President Truman
and UMW boss John L. Lewis broke off a tense White House
conference without a word to the nation on whether the soft
coal miners will defy the government and resume their strike

tomorrow.
GrLm and uncommunicative, Lewis
left the White House shortly before
9:30 p.m. (EDT), and it was clear
that no contract had been signed to
cover government operation of the
mines.
In Pittshuri.'h, a poll of the na
tion's soft coal fields indicated that
the majority of th 400.000 miners
would maintain their "as you
were" status by continuing their
defiance of the government mine
seizure.
150 TROOPS ORDERED
Fifteen minutes later, the Wrti-
Department announced that 150
troops, including an armored de
tachment, had been ordered to lake
up post at Madisonville, Ky., to pro
tect any miners at the Pond River
Colliery, Hopkins County, who
might want to work.
The troops were moved from
Camp Campbell, Ky., under orders
from Brig. Gen. Blackshear M.
Bryan, Jr., the provost marshal who
has been designated by Secretary of
War Robert P. Patterson to provide
such protection wherever it is
needed.
Bryan acted at the request of Vice
Adm. Ben Moreell, deputy coal ad
ministrator who has been in direct
charge of the soft coal mines sincc
they came under government seiz
ure last Wednesday. Moreell was
one of tonight's White House con
ferees.
LEWIS: "NO COMMENT"
There was no hint from the Army
or Moreell whether violence was
expected at the Pond River Colliery,
but Bryan's orders were that the
troops were to be on guard before
the Monday mine shift was sched
uled to resume work early in the
morning.
Lewis brushed off reporters at
the White House with a gruff "no
comment" to the barrage of ques
tions they flung at him.
