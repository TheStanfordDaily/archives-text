Stanford's intercollegiate record this year,
with a few exceptions, has been dismal.
Starting off with a basketball team that fin
ished the season without capturing one con
ference tilt, and going through track, base
ball, and tennis with poor records, Stanford
lias found it difficult to regain a once top po
sition in the athletic field.
Where can the blame be put for Stanford's
pc or record? Certainly not on the coaching
stiff. Basketball mentor Everett Dean is con
sidered one of the finest coaches in the
United States. To Mr. Dean must go credit
for developing a team out of mediocre talent
that played as good ball as it did against such
capable opponents as California and USC.
Baseball coach Harry Wolter is an old hand
at baseball; he did all he could to try and
remedy a poor fielding team that had hitting
power, and also a capable mound staff, but
"threw" games away because of rough field
ing.
A newcomer in the coaching ranks of track,
Jack Weiershauser, nevertheless, is thor
oughly grounded in the sport, but he isn't
any miracle man, and couldn't turn out any
record-breaking team with men who are only
"112 iir" in track events. Individual bright spots
v/°re Martin Anderson, Frank Ganahl, George
Grimes, and Bill Larson; the young track
roach brought out the best in each man.
Flwyn Bugge has been connected with ten
uis for many years, and no criticism can be
thrown at him for this reason's record. USC
and UCLA simply possessed men of higher
caliber.
If the coaches aren't to blame, then who is?
The administration has been lambasted for
its supposed position in regard to athletes.
In the recent student body elections, various
candidates criticized the Stanford adminis
tration, saying that they would attempt to put
pressure on the officials to improve athletic
conditions on the Farm.
But can the administration be really blamed
for the pathetic performance of Cardinal
teams this year? We believe not.
Men of high talent in basketball, baseball,
tennis and track did not apply to Stanford
this year. Or, if any did, they did not meet
the academic requirements.
Therefore, it all boils down to the fact that
Stanford, due to a three-year war layoff, was
unable to field teams composed of sufficient
experience to meet the other teams of Cali
fornia, USC, and UCLA, all of whom have
participated in sports throughout the war,
and possess a backlog of experienced men to
fill their squads.
This lack of athletes cannot be blamed on
the school, nor on the athletic department: it
is mainly a case of circumstances.
Before Stanford jumped on the athletic
bandwagon this year, everybody predicted
that the road would be rough for Stanford,

and that it would take several years' lor this
school to resume their once high position on
the sports pinnacle.
The prediction came through, but also ap
pearing are disgruntled comments on the
way Stanford has been conducting its pro
gram of intercollegiate athletics. This dis
gruntled opinion has no present place in the
sports picture. No other school re-entering
spoils dfter a war layoff has had more suc
cess than Stanford. If Stanford continues to
have unsuccessful sports seasons, then a le
gitimate complaint can be lodged with the
school. But until then, people should refrain
from placing indiscriminate blame on the
sports panorama at Stanford.
References to the luture of Stanford ath
letics have creeped into this article. What
about the future? Opinion on the subject
has ranged from turning Stanford into anoth
er U. of Chicago to turning out powerful
teams in all sports and lowering scholastic
requirements.
In the first place, let's take a look at the
way Stanford conducted its athletic program
before the war. Academic requirements
weren't ignored for athletes. They were ad
mitted on a par with other students. And the
results were satisfactory. Not producing
championship teams every season, Stanford,
nevertheless, maintained a good record
throughout the years.
Can Stanford maintain that program in post
war days? Will we be able to compete with
ether schools in the conference on a par, if
athletes are shown no special consideration,
academically? We think so.
But the point is now raised that Stanford is
not admitting athletes who fulfill the mini
mum requirements because of heavy com
petition.
That statement is not true. This writer has
learned from administration officials that no
prospective athlete has been turned down
who has met the minimum requirements.
But, here's the catch. That policy might
not continue. In other words, athletes might
be refused admission in the future because
they fail to meet the heavy competition, but
who are still within the minimum require
ments field. That will be a dangerous policy.
We maintain that no prospective ath
lete should be refused admission who meets
the present minimum requirements, regard
less of other applicants' records.
If this policy is adopted, Stanford is as
sured of successful athletic teams, yet there
is no infringement on the scholastic standing
of the school.
Stanford does not want tramp athletes.
Neither does Stanford want poor athletic
teams. A "middle of the road" course must
be adopted. Stanford maintained such a pol
icy before the war—Stanford should do the
same in the future. —Art Levinson.

oughly grounded in the sport, but he isn't
any miracle man, and couldn't turn out any
record-breaking team with men who are only
"112 iir" in track events. Individual bright spots
v/°re Martin Anderson, Frank Ganahl, George
Grimes, and Bill Larson; the young track
roach brought out the best in each man.
Flwyn Bugge has been connected with ten
uis for many years, and no criticism can be
thrown at him for this reason's record. USC
and UCLA simply possessed men of higher
caliber.
If the coaches aren't to blame, then who is?
The administration has been lambasted for
its supposed position in regard to athletes.
In the recent student body elections, various
candidates criticized the Stanford adminis
tration, saying that they would attempt to put
pressure on the officials to improve athletic
conditions on the Farm.
But can the administration be really blamed
for the pathetic performance of Cardinal
teams this year? We believe not.
Men of high talent in basketball, baseball,
tennis and track did not apply to Stanford
this year. Or, if any did, they did not meet
the academic requirements.
Therefore, it all boils down to the fact that
Stanford, due to a three-year war layoff, was
unable to field teams composed of sufficient
experience to meet the other teams of Cali
fornia, USC, and UCLA, all of whom have
participated in sports throughout the war,
and possess a backlog of experienced men to
fill their squads.
This lack of athletes cannot be blamed on
the school, nor on the athletic department: it
is mainly a case of circumstances.
Before Stanford jumped on the athletic
bandwagon this year, everybody predicted
that the road would be rough for Stanford,

and that it would take several years' lor this
school to resume their once high position on
the sports pinnacle.
The prediction came through, but also ap
pearing are disgruntled comments on the
way Stanford has been conducting its pro
gram of intercollegiate athletics. This dis
gruntled opinion has no present place in the
sports picture. No other school re-entering
spoils dfter a war layoff has had more suc
cess than Stanford. If Stanford continues to
have unsuccessful sports seasons, then a le
gitimate complaint can be lodged with the
school. But until then, people should refrain
from placing indiscriminate blame on the
sports panorama at Stanford.
References to the luture of Stanford ath
letics have creeped into this article. What
about the future? Opinion on the subject
has ranged from turning Stanford into anoth
er U. of Chicago to turning out powerful
teams in all sports and lowering scholastic
requirements.
In the first place, let's take a look at the
way Stanford conducted its athletic program
before the war. Academic requirements
weren't ignored for athletes. They were ad
mitted on a par with other students. And the
results were satisfactory. Not producing
championship teams every season, Stanford,
nevertheless, maintained a good record
throughout the years.
Can Stanford maintain that program in post
war days? Will we be able to compete with
ether schools in the conference on a par, if
athletes are shown no special consideration,
academically? We think so.
But the point is now raised that Stanford is
not admitting athletes who fulfill the mini
mum requirements because of heavy com
petition.
That statement is not true. This writer has
learned from administration officials that no
prospective athlete has been turned down
who has met the minimum requirements.
But, here's the catch. That policy might
not continue. In other words, athletes might
be refused admission in the future because
they fail to meet the heavy competition, but
who are still within the minimum require
ments field. That will be a dangerous policy.
We maintain that no prospective ath
lete should be refused admission who meets
the present minimum requirements, regard
less of other applicants' records.
If this policy is adopted, Stanford is as
sured of successful athletic teams, yet there
is no infringement on the scholastic standing
of the school.
Stanford does not want tramp athletes.
Neither does Stanford want poor athletic
teams. A "middle of the road" course must
be adopted. Stanford maintained such a pol
icy before the war—Stanford should do the
same in the future. —Art Levinson.
Stanford's intercollegiate record this year,
with a few exceptions, has been dismal.
Starting off with a basketball team that fin
ished the season without capturing one con
ference tilt, and going through track, base
ball, and tennis with poor records, Stanford
lias found it difficult to regain a once top po
sition in the athletic field.
Where can the blame be put for Stanford's
pc or record? Certainly not on the coaching
stiff. Basketball mentor Everett Dean is con
sidered one of the finest coaches in the
United States. To Mr. Dean must go credit
for developing a team out of mediocre talent
that played as good ball as it did against such
capable opponents as California and USC.
Baseball coach Harry Wolter is an old hand
at baseball; he did all he could to try and
remedy a poor fielding team that had hitting
power, and also a capable mound staff, but
"threw" games away because of rough field
ing.

tennis and track did not apply to Stanford
this year. Or, if any did, they did not meet
the academic requirements.
Therefore, it all boils down to the fact that
Stanford, due to a three-year war layoff, was
unable to field teams composed of sufficient
experience to meet the other teams of Cali
fornia, USC, and UCLA, all of whom have
participated in sports throughout the war,
and possess a backlog of experienced men to
fill their squads.
This lack of athletes cannot be blamed on
the school, nor on the athletic department: it
is mainly a case of circumstances.
Before Stanford jumped on the athletic
bandwagon this year, everybody predicted
that the road would be rough for Stanford,

and that it would take several years' lor this
school to resume their once high position on
the sports pinnacle.
The prediction came through, but also ap
pearing are disgruntled comments on the
way Stanford has been conducting its pro
gram of intercollegiate athletics. This dis
gruntled opinion has no present place in the
sports picture. No other school re-entering
spoils dfter a war layoff has had more suc
cess than Stanford. If Stanford continues to
have unsuccessful sports seasons, then a le
gitimate complaint can be lodged with the
school. But until then, people should refrain
from placing indiscriminate blame on the
sports panorama at Stanford.
References to the luture of Stanford ath
letics have creeped into this article. What
about the future? Opinion on the subject
has ranged from turning Stanford into anoth
er U. of Chicago to turning out powerful
teams in all sports and lowering scholastic
requirements.
In the first place, let's take a look at the
way Stanford conducted its athletic program
before the war. Academic requirements
weren't ignored for athletes. They were ad
mitted on a par with other students. And the
results were satisfactory. Not producing
championship teams every season, Stanford,
nevertheless, maintained a good record
throughout the years.
Can Stanford maintain that program in post
war days? Will we be able to compete with
ether schools in the conference on a par, if
athletes are shown no special consideration,
academically? We think so.
But the point is now raised that Stanford is
not admitting athletes who fulfill the mini
mum requirements because of heavy com
petition.
That statement is not true. This writer has
learned from administration officials that no
prospective athlete has been turned down
who has met the minimum requirements.
But, here's the catch. That policy might
not continue. In other words, athletes might
be refused admission in the future because
they fail to meet the heavy competition, but
who are still within the minimum require
ments field. That will be a dangerous policy.
We maintain that no prospective ath
lete should be refused admission who meets
the present minimum requirements, regard
less of other applicants' records.
If this policy is adopted, Stanford is as
sured of successful athletic teams, yet there
is no infringement on the scholastic standing
of the school.
Stanford does not want tramp athletes.
Neither does Stanford want poor athletic
teams. A "middle of the road" course must
be adopted. Stanford maintained such a pol
icy before the war—Stanford should do the
same in the future. —Art Levinson.
Stanford's intercollegiate record this year,
with a few exceptions, has been dismal.
Starting off with a basketball team that fin
ished the season without capturing one con
ference tilt, and going through track, base
ball, and tennis with poor records, Stanford
lias found it difficult to regain a once top po
sition in the athletic field.
Where can the blame be put for Stanford's
pc or record? Certainly not on the coaching
stiff. Basketball mentor Everett Dean is con
sidered one of the finest coaches in the
United States. To Mr. Dean must go credit
for developing a team out of mediocre talent
that played as good ball as it did against such
capable opponents as California and USC.
Baseball coach Harry Wolter is an old hand
at baseball; he did all he could to try and
remedy a poor fielding team that had hitting
power, and also a capable mound staff, but
"threw" games away because of rough field
ing.
A newcomer in the coaching ranks of track,
Jack Weiershauser, nevertheless, is thor
oughly grounded in the sport, but he isn't
any miracle man, and couldn't turn out any
record-breaking team with men who are only
"112 iir" in track events. Individual bright spots
v/°re Martin Anderson, Frank Ganahl, George
Grimes, and Bill Larson; the young track
roach brought out the best in each man.
Flwyn Bugge has been connected with ten
uis for many years, and no criticism can be
thrown at him for this reason's record. USC
and UCLA simply possessed men of higher
caliber.
If the coaches aren't to blame, then who is?
The administration has been lambasted for
its supposed position in regard to athletes.
In the recent student body elections, various
candidates criticized the Stanford adminis
tration, saying that they would attempt to put
pressure on the officials to improve athletic
conditions on the Farm.
But can the administration be really blamed
for the pathetic performance of Cardinal
teams this year? We believe not.
