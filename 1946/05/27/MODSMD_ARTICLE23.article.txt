## FOR THE DRAFT 
### 
To those against continuation of the draft:
The draft must continue. We of the United
Stales must continue to uphold the principles that
\v<! fought for' since 1941 and obtain a working
peace in Europe and Asia. What sort are we? Do
we sit back until we are attacked, then fight a
hard war and again assume our "it doesn't concern
me" attitude?
Let's stick at it a little longer ami make our
fight and our losses justified. Did we kill and get
l.'lled just so we could return to our former iso
lationist attitude and hope that everything will
be taken care of, or do we care?
What does the draft mean to you? Just some
tiling that will disrupt the lives of young Ameri
cans for 12 or 18 months? Pull your head out of
the ground and look at the situation from an over
all viewpoint. I firmly believe that for every year
of occupation there will be five years of peace.
What if you, or your brother, or son won't be
able to start or continue college next fall? There
will be inanv who will not be able to make it, too,
because they are dead.
There is relatively little to lose and everything
to gain by being in the occupation forces during a
portion of the next few years. This nation can't be
like a herd of cattle peacefully grazing in a field

waiting for fate. We can control our destiny by
thoughtful and forthright action,
