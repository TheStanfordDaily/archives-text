# Track Squad Only Fair In First Postwar Meets
## 
### 
A new coach, a new team, and the same old kind of schedule seems
to sum up the track picture adequately; at the beginning of the year Jack
Weiershauser, a former Farm great, was named coach and was greeted
by 60 men, 48 of whom were freshmen.
The schedule was the same as those of pre-war days against a lineup

of loaded squads, and the Indians
didn't win many (one to be exact),
but came close enough in several
others to make things interesting
while they lasted.
There is still one meet to go, the
big one with California next Sat
urday at Berkeley's Edwards Field.
Unless about six sure points show
up, the season will end with the
Farm track team having one meet
to its credit and several elo: e ones.
NOT TOO HOT
The Indian squad a:; a whole was
none too impressive, even with the
handful of individual performers
who could be counted on with a
reasonable amount of dependence.
Frank Canald, Martin Anderson,
George Grimes. Bill Larson, and Ed
Luce were Weiershuuser's main
stays, with Al Wilkin:-, Al Holubar,
Carl Ileffner, Al Vi-Tthaler, and
Punch Green adding thir seconds
and thirds to the general total.
Except for a few scattered per
formances, even the stalwarts were
(jut of their class against the power
packed opponents. Anderson's !).!),
good for two firsts this season in
the 100, was good for only a tic for
third against S.C.. and didn't place
at the Fresno Relays.
LITTLE IMPROVEMENT
Grimes and Ganahl, the ace mid
dle-distance and distance runners,
had only so-so luck against the
powerhouse runners from the
Olympic Club and Southern Cal.
Larson and Luce, best pole vault
er and high jumper on the squad,
did fairly well at the beginning of
the season, but their lack of im
provement in the last few meets
kept them out of first places.
