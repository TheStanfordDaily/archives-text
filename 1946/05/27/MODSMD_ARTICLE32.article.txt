Football and women just don't
mix, according to the best male
sports authorities. To many men,
the thought of taking a woman to a
football game is as satisfying as a
good case of smallpox.
Contending that a woman could
do full justice to the merits, plays,
and formations of the Stanford In
dians, we trudged down to the prac
tice field last Monday to view the
Farm eleven in action.
Chaperoned by the sports editor,
Mr. Levinson, and Mr. Smiley Far
kas of the Daily and San Francisco
Chronicle, we viewed an hour's
workout of calisthenics, signal drill,
and scrimmages. We observed that
the "T" is based on a seven-man
line with the quarterback holding
down thv most vital spot on the
team.
Feeling elated at our moderate

success in sports analyzing) we
turned our attention to the stal
wart. brawny individuals of the
team. Because it was camera day
for the San Francisco newspapers,
we trailed along behind busy
cameramen watching Stanford's
football monarchs posing, rear
ranging helmets, and looking very
grim and determined for an ad
miring newspaper public who are
deceived into believing that all
such candid shots are taken in the
heat of a game.
Four vicious - looking backs,
Frankie Forbes, Don Lipelt, Fred
Parsons, and Gene Martin, charged
away for an Examiner photogra
pher, while a Chronicle man had
halfback Fred Willey jumping at
hoops for the effect of a sud
den turn.
We found their line (football,
that is) as good as any on the
coast, sparked by tackles Jim Cox
and Fred Boensch. The backfield
seemed to be the big question
mark, both as to players and abil
ity, although they seemed lit for
quick opening plays.
