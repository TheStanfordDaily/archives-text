# Wrestling Gets Minor Status
## 
### 
Another Stanford squad resumed
intercollegiate athletics when Coach
Mumby's wrestling combination car
ried on an abbreviated schedule.
Without lettermen and with few
developed stars, Mumby whipped
into shape a cracker jack team that
showed definite plans of developing
into championship caliber.
In season competition the Indian
"grunt and groaners" captured one
tiff with the California Bears, while
losing twice, once to those same
Bearmen and once to a strong Ala
meda Air Naval Station. Only oth
er match on the schedule was the
Far Western Championships where
the matmen emerged in the fourth
slot.
NEW INTEREST IN SPOIiT
With wrestling officially a minor
sport, new interest was taken in the
game as exemplified by the all-Uni
versity intramural wrestling cham
pionships. An unexpectedly large
crowd was on hand to watch the
champs and challengers vie in
struggle. Victors in the February
14 event were Jim Johnston, Chris
Gavras, Andy Valenzuela and Bill
Hoyt. In the heavier weights. Dick
Phillips. Bob Hildreth, and Roy
Gaskin came through with wins.
