# Golfers Take Southern Title
## 
### JOHN SABIN 
After three years of absence
from intercollegiate athletics, Stan- ■
ford's golf team bounced back to |
assume its prewar supremacy on j
the fairways. With a Southern title !
to its crcdit, and its number two ;
man, Tom Lamhie, the individual
champion, Stanford was once again
on top in the collegiate golf world.
Much credit for the Indians' quick i
comeback in at least one category
of intercollegiate sports goes to j
Stanford's Golf Coach Eddie Twiggs.
Before the war, Eddie Twiggs turned
out links teams that made Stanford J
the number one golf team in the
country year after year. Now, with {
the Farm back in competition in
the sports world again, he has lost I
no time in making another bid for j
that supremacy.
Number one position on the
team went to the Farm's prewar
ace Frank McCann, who was elim
inated in the individual champion
ships Friday by Cal's Herb Dun- >
bam. in the rest of the season,
McCann was a consistent winner
for the Cardinals, twice carding a
(»S on the treacherous Stanford
golf course.
Number two position was held
clown by Tom Lamhie, who Satur- ;
day won the individual champion
ship of the Southern Division from j
teammate Bob Cardinal two up. In I
the semi-finals Friday, Lambie de
feated Cal's ace Herb Dunham one
up on the nineteenth hole. Lumbic was undefeated
during the season.
Jack Shuler held the number three position and
played top-flight golf for the Farm all season, but was
off his game Thursday in the team medal play against
i other conference teams, and did not place in the
I individuals.
Bob Cardinal started ofT slowly, but came through
against all conference opponents to prove himself
one of the Indians' best golfers. Cardinal reached
the finals with Lamhie Saturday. Bob Rosburg was
| out much of the season, but proved himself an able
golfer Thursday when he placed second in the team
competition with a 151 over .'{(» holes in the medal
play.
Other men who brought Stanford the Southern
Division title with their able golfing were Don Jones,
Gordon Dotzour, and Bill Savage.
The Indians started off the season with an easy
victory over San Jose State. St. Mary's failed to ap
j pear for their scheduled match. On their southern

trip, the Cardinals proved themselves tops on the
coast by mauling both U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. by the
top-heavy scores of 16V2-lOV2 and 27-0. Then, before
entering the Southern Division championships, the
Indians defeated the University of British Columbia,
probably the best team in the Northwest, easily on
the Stanford course.
Last Thursday, Stanford's golf team officially
made itself the champion of the Southern Division
by defeating U.S.C., U.C.L.A.. and Cal 011 the Farm's
links. Stanford rang up the score of (104. while their
nearest competitors were the Berkeley team with
641. U.S.C. was third and U.C.L.A. last.
Now. with another Southern Division title to their
credit, the Stanford golfers are looking to the N.C.A.A.
finals this summer. In the seven years before the war,
the Farm won the national championship four times.
Always, however, there is the problem of raising
money to send the Farm's golfers to the N.C.A.A.'s.
j Golf is not a moneymaker, and it is an expensive
proposition to send a golf team across the country to
, meet Eastern opponents.

After three years of absence
from intercollegiate athletics, Stan- ■
ford's golf team bounced back to |
assume its prewar supremacy on j
the fairways. With a Southern title !
to its crcdit, and its number two ;
man, Tom Lamhie, the individual
champion, Stanford was once again
on top in the collegiate golf world.
Much credit for the Indians' quick i
comeback in at least one category
of intercollegiate sports goes to j
Stanford's Golf Coach Eddie Twiggs.
Before the war, Eddie Twiggs turned
out links teams that made Stanford J
the number one golf team in the
country year after year. Now, with {
the Farm back in competition in
the sports world again, he has lost I
no time in making another bid for j
that supremacy.
Number one position on the
team went to the Farm's prewar
ace Frank McCann, who was elim
inated in the individual champion
ships Friday by Cal's Herb Dun- >
bam. in the rest of the season,
McCann was a consistent winner
for the Cardinals, twice carding a

golf course.
Number two position was held
clown by Tom Lamhie, who Satur- ;
day won the individual champion
ship of the Southern Division from j
teammate Bob Cardinal two up. In I
the semi-finals Friday, Lambie de
feated Cal's ace Herb Dunham one
up on the nineteenth hole. Lumbic was undefeated
during the season.
Jack Shuler held the number three position and
played top-flight golf for the Farm all season, but was
off his game Thursday in the team medal play against
i other conference teams, and did not place in the
I individuals.
Bob Cardinal started ofT slowly, but came through
against all conference opponents to prove himself
one of the Indians' best golfers. Cardinal reached
the finals with Lamhie Saturday. Bob Rosburg was
| out much of the season, but proved himself an able
golfer Thursday when he placed second in the team
competition with a 151 over .'{(» holes in the medal
play.
Other men who brought Stanford the Southern
Division title with their able golfing were Don Jones,
Gordon Dotzour, and Bill Savage.
The Indians started off the season with an easy
victory over San Jose State. St. Mary's failed to ap
j pear for their scheduled match. On their southern

trip, the Cardinals proved themselves tops on the
coast by mauling both U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. by the
top-heavy scores of 16V2-lOV2 and 27-0. Then, before
entering the Southern Division championships, the
Indians defeated the University of British Columbia,
probably the best team in the Northwest, easily on
the Stanford course.
Last Thursday, Stanford's golf team officially
made itself the champion of the Southern Division
by defeating U.S.C., U.C.L.A.. and Cal 011 the Farm's
links. Stanford rang up the score of (104. while their
nearest competitors were the Berkeley team with
