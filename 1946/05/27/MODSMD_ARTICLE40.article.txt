# Stanford Mermen Sweep Through Meets To Win Coast Conference Championship
## 
### RAY PASCOE 
Undoubtedly the cream of the
Stanford Indian athletic teams, the
swim team walked away with the
championship of the Pacific Coast
Conference, besides leaving a large
trail of defeated teams in their
wake. Composed mostly of fresh
men, which means championship
material in years to come, the team
broke a number of records to power
their way to the crown.
Coaching the aquatic stars were
Ernie Brandsten and Tom Haynie.
Former coach of the perennially
powerful University of Michigan
squad, Hynie has lent his experi
ence in developing the team to a
powerhouse.
The paddlers opened their season
with the Olympic: Club. Leading
only 35-33 till the last event, the
powerful relay team of Rule, East
man, Narver, and Anderson won in
a drive to walk away the victors
42-33. Individual winners were An
derson, copping the 50- and 100-
yard sprints, Hester taking his pet
breaststroke event, Borchers churn
ing to a first in the backstroke, and
two winning relay teams.
While the rest of the team rest
ed. Bob Anderson busied him
self, putting away the 50 - yard
freestyle event and being named
No. I man for that event on the
A.A.IJ. All - American swimming
team.
Next scalp to fall to the Indians
was that of the once mighty Tro
jans. who suffered the worst defeat
in their swim history when Stan
ford slaughtered U.S.C. 60-14. The
Trojans did manage to salvage the
diving event, but only because no
Redmen entered the event. Other
wise they had to be content with all
third places. Besides the usual big
three of Anderson, Borchers, and
Hester, Ray Rule, Jim Armstrong,

Len Sperry, Clint Eastman, and
Bernie Briskin showed terrific
speed.
After vanquishing El Trojan, the
Cards moved over to crosstown
U.C.L.A. to squash the Bruins by
58-18. In this meet the Indians ran
wild. Anderson set a national rec
ord mark in the 50 with a time of
28.4 and a coast record in the 100
with a 52.9. Hester broke the coast
breaststroke record, finishing with

a 2:26.3. The other record fell to
the relay team, who swam the 400
in 3:36.6. Like their neighbors, the
Bruins managed to cop the diving
event.
The Treasure Island team took
the next lacing to the tunc of 53-
22. Anderson again set two marks
breaking the Encina Pool and
Coast record in the 50-yard sprint.
This meet also saw Borchers los
ing his first backstroke race. Be

sides the usual point - getters,
Klaas 801, Dick N'arver and Bob
Bray men picked up some more
digits.
After subduing the Olympic Club
team again, Stanford went after
California. This time Cal was
caught and soundly spanked, 55-19.
By defeating Cal, Stanford officially
clinched the dual meet champion
ship of the conference. Don Hester
succeeded in smashing the inter
collegiate freshman record besides
the Pacific Coast mark in the breast
stroke. Anderson tied the coast 50-
yard record in addition. Anderson
took the 100, Borchers the back
stroke, Rule the 220, and both relay
teams came in first. California won
only diving and the 440.
Only one meet left, and the Cards
took that. The Pacific Coast Con
ference championship fell to the
tankmen when they outscorcd the
field with 89 points, followed by
California with 40. Undefeated all
season, Anderson took his two fa
vorite events. Len Sperry and Bor-
Borchers grabbed a three and four
respectively in the 50, with Captain
Clint Eastman, Narver, and Rule
taking second, third, and fourth in
the 100.
Borchers walked away with the
backstroke, followed by Briskin.
Hester pulled down the top spot
in the hrcaststroke, followed by
Bel and Egeljcr. In the 200-yard
event. Rule, Narver, Armstrong,
and Robinson followed the win
ner. Armstrong with a second and
Breyman with a five placed in
the 440. Both relay teams copped
their races to finish the rout for
the Indians.


WINNING ALL MEETS this season, besides clacking several rec
ords. Stanford Swimmers have been one of the brighter marks on the
sports horizon. Shown above, from left to right, are Don Hester, Bob
Anderson, Harry IJorchers, and Coach Tom Haynie.
