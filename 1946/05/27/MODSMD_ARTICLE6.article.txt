# Cal-Stanford Tennis Match Called by Rain
## 
### 
Willi the match count all square
at two apiccc, Saturday's Califor
nia - Stanford tennis meet was
postponed due to rain. Thus far,
the "cellar battle" has not been
re-scheduled, but at any rate the
scries will be continued next
weekend in Berkeley.
After the Cardinals had walked
away with the first two singles
matches, the Bears came back to
annex the third and fourth seeded
tilts. Fortunately for the Indians,
Cal's late offensive, which bad
carried into the first sets of the
other two singles matches, ran
afoul of the rain which drenched
the courts.
