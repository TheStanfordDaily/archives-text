# Tribe Netters Have Poor Year
## 
### BOB BULLOCK 
Emerging from the wartime sports
blackout which found only intra
mural matches to whet the appetites
of Stanford tennis fans, the Indian
net. squad bounced back into the
Coast Conference fold in 1.946 to
display a creditable brand of play.
Inexperience and the difficult job
of starting anew proved to be the
stumbling block of the Farm nct
ters, who nevertheless came through
numerous times to defeat much
stronger opponents. The practice
schedule was especially gratifying
with triumphs over Santa Clara,
College of Pacific, and Treasure Is
land. But the Indians could not cope
with the blistering pace set by the
southern members of the Confer
ence, who seem to have been born
with a silver racquet in their hands.
Prime obstacles to Stanford ten
nis fortunes appeared to be in
lower bracket play, where the In
dians were invariably beaten tie
spite brilliant triumphs by top
seeded men. Numerous times
Coach Elwyn Bugge juggled his
: squad in quest of a winning com
! bination, but the Indians remained
doomed to defeat in the lower
seedings.
In Stanford's inaugural plunge
into '46 collegiate competition the
squad staged a lafb drive to edge
out powerful College of Pacific 5-4.
Confidence bloomed due to the wel
come news that previously the COP
team had walloped California.
But an ominous note was injected
into the proceedings as the first
! three Stanfordites came through for
wins, only to have the match tied up
| as the trio of lower seeded singles
went to the Tigers. Fortunately the
.new doubles combo of Heath
I Schroeder and Ross Hughes man
aged to salvage the match.
The practice season continued
successfully as Santa Clara, Treas
ure Island and San Jose State fell
before the Indians by identical 8-1
scores. Bob Rutlodge and Arnold
Bcisser alternated as No. 1 seedings
and proceeded to breeze through
j their opponents. Stanford tennis
1 stock boomed.
Day of reckoning came a week
later as the smooth UCLA Bruins
visited the Farm and dunked the
Indians 6-3. For a moment, the is
sue remained in doubt as Arnie
Beisser disposed of highly touted
Noel Brown in first singles. Bob
Rutledge duplicated the victory
against the No. 2 Uclan, but from
: then on the Bruins took control.
Needless to say, the Indians were
relieved to see "cousin" COP ap
pear as opponents on the Farm
courts next day.and the 7-2 Stan
ford win salvaged the wounds of the
Bruin debacle. Ironically enough
the final practice tilt of the season
also marked the last time the locals
have come out on top.
The less said about the disastrous
tennis trip to Los Angeles the bet
ter for Stanford fans. Both the
prodigious USC Conference champs
and Brother Bruin ran wild over
the hapless Farm hands, who sal -
vaged only one match during the
entire weekend. The funeral digits
were 8-1 to UCLA and 9-0 1o the
Trojans.
Looking back over the indivdual
performances of the year, the sterl
ing work of top man Arnie Beisser
stands out. Misfortune seemed to
i continually dog the young Med stu
dent, who nevertheless emerged un
defeated during the entire season.
A shoulder injury in the USC
' matches has eliminated him from
I the important California series
j which will round out the schedule
1 this week.
