# President Kennedy's Open Letter to the Daily, Student Body
## 
### 
For the past two or three months there has been a notorious lack of i
co-operation between the members of the Daily editorial staff and my j
administration. I have personally tried to breach this gap in under- j
standing between the two groups but have been rebuffed at every turn. !
I have decided to use this medium of giving all of you men and women [
on campus the word on what is actually going on around this school.
First of all. Miss Boulware, let me explain the quote ". . . Maybe you
consider Iran and all that to be vital issues, but I don't," that was at
tributed to me in last Thursday's Daily. I did make that statement in the
heat of a discussion at 'ast Wednesday night's Excom meeting. I said it
without thinking and immediately retracted the statement.
But the Daily ran it in their story because it served their twofold pur
pose of building up their arguments and spoiling all of the excellent
constructive points presented by such people as Joan McDonough, presi
dent of Cardinals; Milt Levy, chairman of the Gay Nineties Dance; Ann
Lilienthal, chairman of the 1946 Con Home Drive, and Margaret Meadow
croft, president of the Junior Class. Joan, Milt, Ann, and Margaret pre
sented rather damning evidence that the Daily has steadfastly refused to |
give adequate coverage to campus news and activities.
My point of reasoning, and I still stick to my guns, is that 1 read the j
Stanford Daily primarily tb find out what is going on at Stanford. My
world news consumption is adequately handled by Mr. Paul Smith's
San Francisco Chronicle, and by the radio. I'm not saying that the Daily
should disregard national and international news coverage, but I am
saying that the Daily has refused to co-operate time and time again in
giving adequate publicity to campus organizations and activities, and I
sincerely believe that this matter should be corrected.

Among a few of the things that you people should know is that the
Daily's editorial policy is very tightly controlled by a small, close-knit
group of very serious-minded and conscientious girls. Now, this little
group of girls is very sincere in their efforts lo present a good Stanford
Daily. However, their conscientious attitude is undermining campus in
stitutions and activities. In their over-zealous attempt to give the campus
adequate news they have consistently overlooked Stanford news in favor

of other news. And they have also consistently refused to co-operate :
in any manner with my office.
For example, some weeks ago at an Excom meeting I passed on the ;
information to your representatives that, because Stanford had not par
ticipated in intercollegiate athletics for three years, the athletic coffers
were low and that soccer, rugby, and wrestling MAY have to be dropped
n?xt year. I passed that information on to Excom because it is my duty
as A.S.S.U. president to keep them informed. I specifically asked the Daily
reporter present, Miss Nancy Bannick, not to publish my statement be
cause I knew that every effort was being expended by the Administration
and by the Athletic Department to avert this possibility.
I told Miss Bannick that if any concrete statement was to be made
on the subject, Mr. A 1 Masters, Director of Athletics, was the one to make
it. Miss Bannick faithfully relayed my wish to Miss Helen Dietz, the staff
editor. Miss Dietz phoned Mr. Masters, who refused to make any state
ment because he is working night and day, along with the Administration,
to work out the problem to the best interests of Stanford. So Miss Dietz,
being one of the serious-minded and conscientious group, after she failed
to get Mr. Masters' consent, and going above my specific instructions that
I was not to be quoted, put out a Daily the next morning with screaming
headlines to the effect that Stanford was dropping soccer, rugby, and
wrestling next year. The truth is that this matter has not yet been settled.
As a result of this excellent bit of co-operation and news coverage by
Miss Dietz, Mr. Stan Shpetner picked up the ball in his "Who Told You?"
column and ran with it for several weeks. A number of the candidates at
the Election Assembly last Wednesday hopped on the bandwagon, along
with Shpetner, to try and lead you to believe that the Administration has
embarked on a whole-hearted campaign to de-emphasize intercollegiate
athletics. Shpetner, in spite of his contentions, has made no effort to talk
with the men who actually know what is going on. He has never discussed
the problem with Mr. A 1 Masters, Director of Athletics; he has never
discussed the problem with Mr. John Stalnaker, Dean of Students. Shpet
ner has based all of his arguments on hearsay, supposition, and talks with
underlings.
♦ * «
Let me assure all of you worried, loyal students that the University |

Administration is not carrying out any program to de-emphasize athletics, j
In fact, it was Dr. Tresidder's statement at the reorganization meeting
of the B.A.C. almost a year ago that it would be the University's policy
not only to encourage intercollegiate athletic competition, but to stimulate
our entire athletic program by including "B" and weight teams. Our in
tramural program was also to be greatly stepped up. Let me also assure
all of you that the faculty admissions committee has not raised the stand
ards for matriculation into Stanford. The same standards are present
today as were prevalent when Stanford went to the Rose Bowl in 1940.
Prospective Stanford athletes still must fulfil basic requirements as to j
grades, aptitude test rating, and personality rating.
Let me explain to all of you students the difficulties that the Adminis
tration is working under. During the war the young men of this nation
of college age fought and won the greatest and bloodiest war ever waged
in the history of mankind. In order to keep running, the University took
in a larger number of girls than ever before. Now th? war is over and
the men who fought have returned to civilian status. It is the University's
avowed policy that Stanford owes a great debt to these G.l.'s and every j
effort must be expended to see that as many as possible are given the ;
opportunity to further their college education.
However, the Administration realizes that in order to maintain class |
continuity a freshman class of prewar proportions must be allowed to
matriculate this fall. The ensuing result Is that Stanford is going to be
greatly overcrowded for the next two or three years. Classes will be larger,
living groups and dormitories will be crammed full. There will be a lot
of things that you won't like the next few years, but it is Stanford's plain
duty to extend to as many as possible the opportunity to study.
Because there are so many men applying for admission to Stanford, and j
because the Admission Committee can only allow just so many men to j
matriculate, it is only natural that some potential athletic greats, who 1
barely fulfill basic requirements, will not be allowed to enter next fall.
However, those men of athletic prowess who can measure up to our en- '
trance requirements, which, I REPEAT, have not been raised, will most j
certainly be giving their all next year for the Red and White on the
fields of athletic endeavor.

It has been my avowed purpose this past year to correct a few things
that I haven't liked in this postwar Stanford. I have also striven for and,
I think, attained a real spirit of understanding, co-operation, faith, and
I trust between my office and University officials.
'Everything that I have worked for all year came close to being de
stroyed when you who attended the Assembly last Wednesday clapped
and cheered when Wally McCall point-blank accused the Administration
of fraud. How a man can get U p and hope to win votes and confidence by
making such a statement that is based on utter falsities I do not know.
| That's not the Stanford man that I used to know! If ever a man owed the
Administration an apology, it is young Mr. McCall who talked when he
! should have been listening.
I thank God that there was a great majority of the voting student body
who saw through the various "campaign promises" set forth by two or
three of the candidates. In electing Martin Anderson and Millie Edwards
to the top A.S.S.U. posts next year, you have selected two excellent people.
But Martin and Millie will not be able to turn a wheel if the Daily and
[ the student body will not co-operate with their policies.
I suggest that next year you, the readers, insist that reporters and eol
i umnists on the Daily make sure of their facts before they present various
| issues for your reading and digestion. The Daily enjoys a complete mo
| nopoly on campus news and you students should all make very sure that
! the news is fairly and adequately presented.
Well, I guess this is enough. At least this statement of honest facts
| should make some of you feel better about the prospects of Stanford dis
integrating from under us. My statements made here will probably be
misconstrued and' misinterpreted. A few people are going to be very mad
and perturbed about this letter—particularly all of you people on campus
| who talk and write before you have the facts. But a lot of guys and
gals are going to be happy that someone has finally set all of this to paper.
And those people are the ones that I'm interested in—the clear-thinking,
, real Stanford man and woman.
Very sincerely,
Bob Kennedy, President, A.S.S.U.
