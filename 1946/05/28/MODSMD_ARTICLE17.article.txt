# Senators Split on Strike Legislation; Whitney Charges Truman Plan Fascist
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 27 (UP). —Semite Democratic
Leader Alben W. Barkley tonight challenged what he
culled a Republican attack on President Truman's
personal integrity and demanded prompt passage of
the emergency powers bill asked by the President to

put down strikes against the nation."
Barkley took the floor to rally
support for the sweeping bill
against a rising tide of labor union
protests and a powerful Senate coa
lition of Republicans and pro-labor
Democrats out to kill or neutralize
the measure.
Sen. James Murray, D., Mont., a
strong laborite, said there was talk
of sending a Senate-union delega
tion to the White House to try to
get President Truman to call the
whole thing ofT.
Barkley announced that he would
keep the Senate in session tonight
and threatened to repeat the per
formance every night, if necessary,
until it acts on the House-approved
bill.
Then he into an impas
sioned denial of charges made on
the floor by Sen. Wayne L. Morse,
R., Ore., that Mr. Truman had
tricked the public and Congress last
Saturday by deliberately withhold
ing news of the rail strike settle
ment until mid-way through his
address to the joint session.
Barkley declared that Mr. Truman
had no knowledge of the rail settle
ment in advance of his speech to
Congress. Barkley said the formal
agreement was signed at 3:57 p.m.,
and that Presidential Assistant John
R. Steelman immediately tried to j
advise the President by telephone,
only to find that he had already left
for the Capitol.
Morse's adamant stand was backed
up by other members of the Re
publican bloc who hurled charges
of fascism at the President and j
compared his demand for harsh
anti-strike powers, including the!
authority to draft recalcitrant strik- |
crs into the Army, with the actions j
of Hitler and Mussolini.

CLEVELAND, May 27 (UP). —A bitter, defeated
labor loader retumed to his home town today from
Washington and lashed out verbally at his detractors,
denouncing former friends and foes alike in the after
math of the railroad unions' lost cause.

A. F. Whitney, president of the
still - powerful Brotherhood of
Railroad Trainmen and spokes
man for the Engineers' Brother
hood which went down to defeat
with his union, started his denun
ciations the moment he swung
from his train in Pennsylvania
Station this morning.
He picked his targets carefully
President Truman first; then Wel
lington Hoe, a former employee he
had fired from the brotherhood for
"Communist activities"; then the
National Mediation Board, and Da
vid Robertson, head of the Locomo
tive Firemen and Enginemen Broth
erhood, and, finally, Cleveland's
Mayor Thomas Burke, a former
close friend.
Declaring that !Vlr. Truman "has
had our whole-hearted support for
many years," Whitney said that
support is now at an end. "We
now repudiate him for the un-
American statement he made over
the radio last Friday evening and
for his fascist proposal to Con
gress last Saturday," he said.

sioned denial of charges made on
the floor by Sen. Wayne L. Morse,
R., Ore., that Mr. Truman had
tricked the public and Congress last
Saturday by deliberately withhold
ing news of the rail strike settle
ment until mid-way through his
address to the joint session.
Barkley declared that Mr. Truman
had no knowledge of the rail settle

Congress. Barkley said the formal
agreement was signed at 3:57 p.m.,
and that Presidential Assistant John
R. Steelman immediately tried to j
advise the President by telephone,
only to find that he had already left
for the Capitol.
Morse's adamant stand was backed
up by other members of the Re
publican bloc who hurled charges
of fascism at the President and j
compared his demand for harsh
anti-strike powers, including the!
authority to draft recalcitrant strik- |
crs into the Army, with the actions j
of Hitler and Mussolini.

CLEVELAND, May 27 (UP). —A bitter, defeated
labor loader retumed to his home town today from
Washington and lashed out verbally at his detractors,
denouncing former friends and foes alike in the after
math of the railroad unions' lost cause.

A. F. Whitney, president of the
still - powerful Brotherhood of
Railroad Trainmen and spokes
man for the Engineers' Brother
hood which went down to defeat
with his union, started his denun
ciations the moment he swung
from his train in Pennsylvania
Station this morning.
He picked his targets carefully
President Truman first; then Wel
lington Hoe, a former employee he
had fired from the brotherhood for
"Communist activities"; then the
National Mediation Board, and Da
vid Robertson, head of the Locomo
tive Firemen and Enginemen Broth
erhood, and, finally, Cleveland's
Mayor Thomas Burke, a former
close friend.
Declaring that !Vlr. Truman "has
had our whole-hearted support for
many years," Whitney said that
support is now at an end. "We
now repudiate him for the un-
American statement he made over
the radio last Friday evening and
for his fascist proposal to Con
gress last Saturday," he said.
WASHINGTON, May 27 (UP). —Semite Democratic
Leader Alben W. Barkley tonight challenged what he
culled a Republican attack on President Truman's
personal integrity and demanded prompt passage of
the emergency powers bill asked by the President to

put down strikes against the nation."
Barkley took the floor to rally
support for the sweeping bill
against a rising tide of labor union
protests and a powerful Senate coa
lition of Republicans and pro-labor
Democrats out to kill or neutralize
the measure.
Sen. James Murray, D., Mont., a
strong laborite, said there was talk
of sending a Senate-union delega
tion to the White House to try to
get President Truman to call the
whole thing ofT.
Barkley announced that he would
keep the Senate in session tonight
and threatened to repeat the per
formance every night, if necessary,
until it acts on the House-approved
bill.
