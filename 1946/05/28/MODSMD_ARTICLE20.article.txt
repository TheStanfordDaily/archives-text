# Coal Strike Settlement Seems Near
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 27 (UP).— |
The government was reported near
agreement tonight with President
John L. Lewis of the United Mine i
Workers (AFL) on a contract to j
end the day-old soft coal strike.
An informed source said there j
was "a Rood possibility" of an
agreement tomorrow hut that
snags still may develop in further
conferences between Lewis and
Coal Administrator J. A. Krug j
scheduled for 11 a.m. (EST).
Barring an unforeseen breakdown ,
in the negotiations, Lewis appeared j
certain to win a more liberal wel- j
fare fund than he was offered by the |
mine operators.
Government representatives re- !
portedly were discussing a fund,
financed by a five-cent assessment j
on each ton of coal, which would
raise about $25,000,000 a year. Lewis
asked for a $70,000,000 fund financed
by an assessment of 7 per cent on
company payrolls.
The mine hoss also had pro
posed that the fund be adminis
tered by the union alone. It was
understood that the government
opposed exclusive union adminis
tration and that any agreement
probably would call for a tripar
tite agency representing industry,
the union and government.
