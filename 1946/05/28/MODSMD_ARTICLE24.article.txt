# Now, About That Union
## 
### 
Msre than once from the platform of the
election assembly came mention of a student
union—a mention that conjured up student
enthusiasm and mental pictures of a chro
mium, plush-lined lounge.
As vice-president-elect, to be in charge of
next year's ASSU social calendar, Mildred
Edwards publicly approved the suggested
union and pledged her support to its even
tual construction. A group of interested stu
dent? had met, prior even to the election, to
discuss plans and immediate action regard
ing tlu union. And now the project, which
was conceived by and for the students will
depend for its fulfillment, upon their support.
From here, it doesn't look impossible. If it
were tops on the ASSU agenda for fall quar
ter, if the students were actively to work and
financially to contribute to the union, it
COULD be ready during winter quarter.
With a substantial nucleus of student
money pledged to the union, we are virtually
assured of additional financial support from
local and alumni groups. Priority on build
ing materials COULD be attained, once the
students themselves realized the importance

to them of having a gathering place which
would provide food and camping grounds to
those who at this point have no place to go.
The site, tentatively approved and awarded
to the project, is ihe triangular plot of land
opposite the post office and women's club
house, next to The Oaks.
All the trimmings which can be lavishly
envisaged, are not necessary to the union
which we can practically build, and one
which will serve the purpose of uniting and
acquainting the students. The building would
be temporary, but would be more than suf
ficient during the five or ten years before the
projected reorganization of the Union and
student body office buildings.
But it could be a comfortable frame build
ing with space and equipment for reading,
eating, dancing and open talk with your
friends. Our present vision of the union looks
like this: a narrow low-slung building in an
obtuse U-shape, with a patio in the center of
the U— and lawns and music and students
sprinkled inside and out.
Does it sound good enough for your sup
port, early next autumn quarter?—BMV
