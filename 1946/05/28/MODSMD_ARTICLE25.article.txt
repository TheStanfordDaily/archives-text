# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
In answer to Howard Cook's letter which ap-
I".' ired in the Daily, Thursday last, we of the
Daily heartily agree. There should be more time
lniwetn nominations and final elections.
One thing few pvople understand on this cam
pus i$ that elections are run off as stipulated in the
constitution. Election Board chairman just follows
the rules as s?t down by this document. If the
constitution says nominations will open the pre
ceding Thursday before elections, that is when
they open.
The only solution, and one which would be
agreeable to all, is for some spirited group to get
the petition, get it signed, and amend the con
stitution. Till this is don", elections will be run
r>ll in the same hurried, helter-skelter method.
