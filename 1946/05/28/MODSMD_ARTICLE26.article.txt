Dear Editor:
May 1 contribute a small word of commendation
to the members of Rally Committee for the man
ner in which they managed the Spring Sing? The
organization lrom first publicity to final awarding
of prizes was a triumph of planning. Orchids! The
Sing has developed since its inception (was it '39
or '40?) into one of Stanford's most delightful

traditions, and Friday night I spoke to persons who
had come in spite of the bad weather from Penin
sula points miles away.
Lest one salient fact escape notice, I herewith
point out that for the first time 1938 if not
earlier, a Stanford men's Glee Club has made its
appearance on a University program. The group
which opened the Sing this year was organized this
quarter, hys drawn up a constitution, has been
officially adopted by the A.S.S.U., and is already
planning big things for fall.
Tonight, in the basement of the Women's Club
house, the Glee Club will hold a smoker to which
any interested Stanford men are invited. There
will be refreshments; we will learn how the Farm
by concerts and tours which took it as far as Port-
Glee Club made a name for itself in the old days
land and Los Angeles, and prospective members
wjll hear of the plans for next year's Glee Club
which include a Christmas concert and a tour.
This is frankly a plug: come one, come all who
are interested tonight at 7 to the Women's Club
house. Let's build a Stanford Men's Glee Club
that will carry the fame of Stanford to other cities
and campuses.
