# THE 						STANFORD STORY

### BILL HORNBY 
ON PLUGS AND LEFTOVERS
A bareheaded Stanford, male and female, has
forgotten the colorful Plug-Ugly, pride of the jun
ior class. But in the days when a college class was
more than a grouping of units, the hat was the
thing.
Every junior had the right to wear a Plug-
Ugly, a type of squat felt top-hat, layered with
coats of white lead and colored with every design
and hue the human underneath could dream up.
It's hard now to imagine the immense pains the
junior men went to in outdoing each other in the
matter of Plugs.
Stanford letters, major department numerals,
Gibson Girls, the arches on the Quad with the
setting sun behind, fraternity shields, sports
scenes, the Stanford Emblem—all these found
t'.teir way to the top of this headgear in all the
shades of the rainbow.
Every phase of Stanford life was dotted with
the gay colors of the Plug. In addition to identi
fying its wearer as a junior, it loudly proclaimed
his major subject and, by inference, commented on
the decadence of the other classes.
This inference resulted in a yearly mass maul
ing called the Plug-Ugly battle. The goal of each
.Junior engaged was to keep his Plug on his head.
The goal of the opposing sophomores was to squash
.same. Class spirit erupted yearly, and the morn

ing after was a scene of battered felt and bruised
bodies.
And each year there was a Plug-Ugly show
sparked by the Junior Class, in which the plugs
were leading props.

ON PLUGS AND LEFTOVERS
A bareheaded Stanford, male and female, has
forgotten the colorful Plug-Ugly, pride of the jun
ior class. But in the days when a college class was
more than a grouping of units, the hat was the
thing.
Every junior had the right to wear a Plug-
Ugly, a type of squat felt top-hat, layered with
coats of white lead and colored with every design
and hue the human underneath could dream up.
It's hard now to imagine the immense pains the
junior men went to in outdoing each other in the
matter of Plugs.
Stanford letters, major department numerals,
Gibson Girls, the arches on the Quad with the
setting sun behind, fraternity shields, sports
scenes, the Stanford Emblem—all these found
t'.teir way to the top of this headgear in all the
shades of the rainbow.
Every phase of Stanford life was dotted with
the gay colors of the Plug. In addition to identi
fying its wearer as a junior, it loudly proclaimed
his major subject and, by inference, commented on
the decadence of the other classes.
This inference resulted in a yearly mass maul
ing called the Plug-Ugly battle. The goal of each
.Junior engaged was to keep his Plug on his head.
The goal of the opposing sophomores was to squash
.same. Class spirit erupted yearly, and the morn

ing after was a scene of battered felt and bruised
bodies.
And each year there was a Plug-Ugly show
sparked by the Junior Class, in which the plugs
were leading props.
