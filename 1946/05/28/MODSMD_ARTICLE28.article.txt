# HISTORY—1946

### BILL STEIF 
We see that the Palo Alto Times took almost six
inches of space to print one of the more scurrilous
iil tie yarns of the day on its front page last night.
The story was that some Stanford faculty mem
bers had received mimeographed postcards bearing
Palo Alto postmarks—and without signature—which
said the following:
"Dear Colleague:
"How much longer will we accept the former
manager of Camp Curry—Uncle Don—as President?
Is not Stanford worthy of a scholar instead of a
resort manager as President? Let us stop merely
expressing our disapproval and unite for action."
Against the background of the r»ally important
things which are occurring in the world—the semi
starved condition of half a billion human beings
like us, charges and counter-charges of men like
Molotov and Byrnes, the debilitating effects of a
national coal strike—this item seems pretty trivial.
But to us, situated at the University whose presi
dent is in question, the phenomenon of the anony
mous postcards seems to bear a curious signifi
cance.
That a scholar could handle the tangled affairs
of a University with a 35-million-dollar endow
ment any better than the former head of a million
dollar corporation in these parlous times is not at
all the question. There is, we think, a slightly
deeper interpretation to be read into this nasty
little jab at Dr. Tresidder.
We wonder why it is that the man or men who
mailed these billets-doux must use the vehicle of

the anonymous postcard to attempt to stir up pro
fessorial opinion. We wonder why the senders of
these postcards could not approach the University's
President and say, "We think this and this and
this are wrong in your Administration. We should
like to know the complete facts. We think this
and this and this are incorrect and here are our
REASONS why." From there, it seems to us, Dr.
Tresidder could carry the ball. He would know
where he stood and his critics would know where
they stood.
This is democratic method.
There has been, we suspect, something of a
whispering campaign against Stanford's President
and Administration. This has culminated, obvi
ously, in the anonymous postcard attack, a tech
nique which is worthy of the shabby Adolf Hitler
as he conspires in a Munich beer cellar in 1921.
We make neither a defense of nor an assault
upon Stanford's present President and his Admin
istration. We have never met the gentleman in
question and do not know enough about either his
methods or his results even to presume to make
a value-judgment upon him or his machinery.
We are too busy just living and trying to do work
of a university level to give much heed to the
sterile thrashings of carping fleas upon the Uni
versity's ample backbone.
But we are alarmed when the critics "go under
ground." In the slime of anonymity weird crea
tures grow.
We wonder whether they would blink in the
light.

Is not Stanford worthy of a scholar instead of a
resort manager as President? Let us stop merely
expressing our disapproval and unite for action."
Against the background of the r»ally important
things which are occurring in the world—the semi
starved condition of half a billion human beings
like us, charges and counter-charges of men like
Molotov and Byrnes, the debilitating effects of a
national coal strike—this item seems pretty trivial.
But to us, situated at the University whose presi
dent is in question, the phenomenon of the anony
mous postcards seems to bear a curious signifi
cance.
That a scholar could handle the tangled affairs
of a University with a 35-million-dollar endow
ment any better than the former head of a million
dollar corporation in these parlous times is not at
all the question. There is, we think, a slightly
deeper interpretation to be read into this nasty
little jab at Dr. Tresidder.
We wonder why it is that the man or men who
mailed these billets-doux must use the vehicle of

the anonymous postcard to attempt to stir up pro
fessorial opinion. We wonder why the senders of
these postcards could not approach the University's
President and say, "We think this and this and
this are wrong in your Administration. We should
like to know the complete facts. We think this
and this and this are incorrect and here are our
REASONS why." From there, it seems to us, Dr.
Tresidder could carry the ball. He would know
where he stood and his critics would know where
they stood.
This is democratic method.
There has been, we suspect, something of a
whispering campaign against Stanford's President
and Administration. This has culminated, obvi
ously, in the anonymous postcard attack, a tech
nique which is worthy of the shabby Adolf Hitler
as he conspires in a Munich beer cellar in 1921.
We make neither a defense of nor an assault
upon Stanford's present President and his Admin
istration. We have never met the gentleman in
question and do not know enough about either his
methods or his results even to presume to make
a value-judgment upon him or his machinery.
We are too busy just living and trying to do work
of a university level to give much heed to the
sterile thrashings of carping fleas upon the Uni
versity's ample backbone.
But we are alarmed when the critics "go under
ground." In the slime of anonymity weird crea
tures grow.
We wonder whether they would blink in the
light.
We see that the Palo Alto Times took almost six
inches of space to print one of the more scurrilous
iil tie yarns of the day on its front page last night.
The story was that some Stanford faculty mem
bers had received mimeographed postcards bearing
Palo Alto postmarks—and without signature—which
said the following:
"Dear Colleague:
"How much longer will we accept the former
manager of Camp Curry—Uncle Don—as President?
Is not Stanford worthy of a scholar instead of a
resort manager as President? Let us stop merely
