# Palestine Problem Challenging International Diplomacy; Power Politics Underlies Struggle
## 
### RALPH HOVIS THE PALESTINE PROBLEM 
At the crossroads between the
Western world and the Eastern
world, down by the River Jordan,
live the Arabs and the Jews, two
component parts to one of the most
challenging problems of world di
plomacy today.
Elements of the problem include:
hist, the immediate humanitarian
need for transferring the displaced
European Jews to Palestine or to
the countries of their origin; second,
(he internal riddle of Jewish claims
supported by British promises ver
sus Arab claims strengthened by
other British promises; and, third,
the international question regard
ing the transfer of Palestine's legal
status from British mandate to UN.
trusteeship. Underlying these three
surface problems exists the ever
apparent struggle for power in the
Mediterranean in which the chief
antagonists are Britain and Russia.
The humanitarian feature of
the problem raises the issue of
fundamental human rights — that
the displaced Jews in Europe
must he granted a decent*place
in which to settle and rebuild
their lives. Of the nine million
Jews living in Europe in 1939,
nearly six million disappeared
from their homes during the Nazi-
Fascist blackout. Three million of
these are assumed to have been
exterminated.
Historically, the non-Jews have
committed injustices to the Jews in
every country and every century
since the Babylonians destroyed the !

Kingdom of Judea. The problem ]
today is a heritage and a result oi
our own bigotry and faithlessness.
The Balfour Declaration of 1917
augmented Jewish hopes for a na
tional home by asserting British in
terest in establishing one for them i
in Palestine. A religious philosophy
of the Jews, Zionism, has attempted ,
to implement the Declaration, and |
extremist groups, such us the Stern
gang and the National Military Or
ganization, are now ready to revolt j
against their British "keepers" and i
strike for independence.
Large Jewish colonization has i
failed because the question is not j
essentially Palestinian. Rather, it
involves the entire Arab world from
Iran to Syria, and even to Morocco. ;
Arab aims to form a federation date
from the first World War when all
Turkish territory was loosely de- ;
scribed as Syria. Now, after the
second World War, they envisage a j
Greater Syria, composed of Syria, j
Lebanon, Transjordania, and Pal- 1

estine. The latter is the vital area
in the picture because it is an outlet
for Iraquian oil. Jerusalem is also
third holy eity of the Islamic world
and, aftor Mecca and Medina, is a
point of pilgrimage.
British promises strengthening
these Arab interests include the
191-5 McMuhnn encouragement to
the Arahs toward independence,
the 1930 l'assfield While Paper
limiting Jewish land purchases,
and the 1939 White Paper issued
by the Chamberlain appeasement
cabinet, which decree limited im
migration of Jews into Palestine.
The international problem ap
pears because the mandate for Pal
estine, which was accepted by Brit
ain from the now-defunct League
of Nations in 1920, has been recom
mended for transfer to U.N. trustee
ship by the recent Anglo-American
Report. This woidd give the U.N.
its lirst opportunity to carry out
trusteeship plans and make it work
until an eventual bi-national state

I evolved.
The British pattern of behavior in
Palestine seems inconsistent when
it is reflected that they fought for
the principle of self-determination
1 but deny it to the Jews, and that
the British risked their lives to pre
vent the triumph of Nazi Germany
| but deny sovereignty to the Nazis'
| first victims.
The root of this action involves

not the struggle between Jews and
Arabs but the struggle for power in
the Mediterranean between Britain
and Russia. Britain is eonvineed
that Russia is an economic and po
litical threat and is determined not
to yield one square mile of terri
tory in the Levant. As a vital seg
ment in the Middle East, Palestine
becomes the area of resistance to
any change in the status quo.
The Anglo-American Report on
the Palestine Problem recognizes
the dilTicuhy of transferring out
of Europe most of the displaced
Jews and charges world responsi
bility for meeting the issue. Its
practical suggestion is to award
100,000 visas to some of these
Jews, an abrogation of the 193!)
White Paper. Land transfers
would be allowed and the man
date would be continued until the
U.N. establishes the trusteeship.
American suggestions include
Truman's support of the transfer of
100,000 displaced Jews to Palestine,
Royce Brier's cautions against using
force with the concurrent expecta
tion that it will work for any length
of time, Bartley Crum's request for
British annulment of the 1939 White
Paper, and Anne O'Hara McCor
mick's proposal that the Arabs and
Jews be forced to work together in
a central government. The New
York Times' stand is that the U.S.
must contribute force to back up its
commitments', and Frank Gervasi's
outlook is for emergence of a Jew
ish state in the Middle East which
would hasten the shift of the Arab
quasi-feudal society to one based
upon democratic lines.
The conclusion to be drawn
from analysis of this problem is
no different from that of any oth
er existing international problem.
The need is for an alert public
opinion, mobilized on a world
wide basis, that can offset the
forccs of aggressive imperialism—
whether these assert themselves
in the Western World or in the
Eastern world.
