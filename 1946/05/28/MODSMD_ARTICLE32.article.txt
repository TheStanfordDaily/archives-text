## 
### 
Stanford's track Indians enter the
last stages of polishing their per
formances this week for the Big
Meet Saturday afternoon when the
Farm journeys to Berkeley's Ed
wards Field.
Who's going to win? Ileh, heh,
we are—we're due for one, and
we don't care how close it'll be,
just so long as we win it. And
we can. The foregoing being the
yist of Track Coach Jack Weiers
hauser's sentiments on the per
tinent subject.
But man, it'll be close. The way
's doped to date is Stanford should
■ore between 5(5 and 67 points up
ntil relay time. Sixty-one points
nd the five for the relay will give
us (if! and a one-point victory.
And there you have it all in a
. i utshell.
The Indians' chances to take the
ISig One are very, very good, and
i their best performances are du
i licated (or improved upon) the
meet is in the well-known bag.
Several of the Injuns, Frank
Ganahl, Ed Luce, and A 1 Vicr
thaler among others, have been
plagued recently by minor in
juries. These lesser aches and
sprains, however, are pretty well
cleared up by now, or will be by
starting time Saturday.
At any rate, the polishing con
tinues, and while practice times,
particularly, have not been too
f-'ood, the Tribe has a habit of do
ing much better comes the day for
doing actual competition.
That's the big thing about the
team. They never say quit. They
drive and drive and drive whether
they're ahead or behind, and with
tl Big One on the block that much
more drive can be expected.
Tickets for the meet will NOT
be sold here, but will be avail
able to students at all booths at
Berkeley for 50 cents. Ticket sale
starts at 1 p.m., and first event
gets under way at 1:45.
