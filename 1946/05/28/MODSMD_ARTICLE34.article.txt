The spring sports program winds
i up with a grand finale this Saturday
at Berkeley. Three sports events,
baseball, tennis, and track are
scheduled.
No league championships will be
decided by any of the events, but
I that won t cause a lack of keen
competition. Meeting California is
"(he game of the season, and win
over the Blue and Gold more than
compensates for early season
losses, so important is the rivalry
with Cal.
j Stanford stands favored to win the
, tennis matches on the Berkeley
courts. Scheduled to play two
games, the last matches were post
poned due to a heavy downpour of
"mist."
i Berkeley U. should take the base
ball contests, one on Thursday, and
I one Saturday, unless the perplexing
problem of fielding is solved by the
Stanford infield.
Heavy interest lies in the dual
track meet. Both squads are
about on a par, and (he meet
should be nothing less than torrid.
Encouraging words came from
track meet mentor Jack YVciers
hauser, when he said thai he ex
pects Stanford to take the match.
Wo gladly tag along on that state
ment, and hope a 'goodly portion of
Stanford students travel over to
Berkeley Saturday for the meet.
WHY IT PAYS TO BE A FOOT
BALL COACH AT STANFORD
DEPARTMENT: Jim McAllister
threw a big dinner for (he Stan
ford football squad las( Saturday
night in San Francisco, and with
the evening proceeding along mer
rily, someone remarked to Marchie
Schwartz that he heard lha(

i March ie was having a heck of a
time trying to buy a new car. Re
marking (hat that was true, and
probably wishing that the grue
some subject wouldn't have arisen
to spoil such a happy evening, an
other person told Marchie to take
a look outside the building. And
guess what was sitting there? A
shiny new Plymouth. Just wait
ing for the football coach to drive
! oil" in.
With McAllister the Chrysler au
tomobile agent in San Francisco,
| several alumni thought it would be
j a "peachy" idea to present Schwartz
j with the car —provided he make IS
| payments on the vehicle.

An error appeared in yesterday's
! sport edition when it said in the
i basketball articles that ThoAipson,
Berlin, and Davidson were return
ing from the 1942 varsity. It tain't
! so. . . . Thompson has had no pre
vious varsity experience at Stanford,
and Berlin and Davidson played on
j the '42 frosh basketball squad.

And then thc're was the gal who
■asked us who we were going to
play in the Big Game next fall.
Ho hum . . . Maybe it's the effect
of approaching finals that makes
people ask such questions . . .
I lock, don't let finals get you
down . . . Do .you realize that finals
have been given here over 200
times . . . One more time doesn't
make much difference.
