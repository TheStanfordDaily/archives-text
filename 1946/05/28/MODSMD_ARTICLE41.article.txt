# Stanford Students Lack Cynicism Of Wilson's Generation--Guerard
## 
### BILL ANTHONY 
Stanford students are not as cyni
cal as was the generation of Wilson's
time, according to retiring professor
Albert Leon Guerard.
They have not been subjected to
the "absurd extreme enthusiasm" of
the preceding generation. They are
neither lost nor drunk in the hys
teria of having won a war. Rather
they see the difficulties ahead, Pro
fessor Guerard believes.
Above all else, he said, "they do
not have the point of view of 'fear,'
but have that of 'hope.' " This is evi
denced by the fact that they refuse
to feast while others starve.
BECOMES EMERITUS
Dr. Guerard, professor of general
literature, philosopher, and eminent
author, becomes an emeritus fac
ulty member at the end of this quar
ter after teaching at Stanford from

1900 to 1913 and from 1925 to the
present.
While physical scientists have
been developing atomic energy
which has presented humanity with
the choice of One World or None, j
political scientists at the same time
have been investigating the poten
tiality of a World State.
Every month Professor Guerard
flies back to either New York or
Chicago to attend meetings of the
Committee for Framing World Or
ganization.
HERCULEAN TASK
When this committee has com
pleted its herculean task of research
and investigation it will submit a
plan for world unity to the people.
Dr. Guerard believes that the
unity may be reached with a World
Research Council providing the
nucleus, possibly operating on a
United Nations constitution.
For example he does not see a
Europe west of the Soviets as being
a continent of autonomous German,
French, Italian, and other states.
But rather one Union composed of
people who speak German, French,
and Italian.
He expressed the belief that we

will get along very weil with the
Russians as long as we maintain our
traditionally clean concept of com
petitive markets.
DEGREE FROM GENEVA
A graduate of the University of
Paris, Professor Guerard took post
graduate work at the Sorbonne and
at London and received the Litt.D.
degree from Geneva College, Penn
sylvania in 1936.
He served in the intelligence and
liaison divisions of the U. S. Army
in World War I. He is a chevalier
of the Legion of Honor, and has also
been decorated with the Crown of
Rumania.
Who's Who in America lists 17
books by Dr. Guerard. His latest,
ofT the presses March 20, "France:
A Short History," summarizes his
40 years of teaching the subject.
SPECIAL INTERESTS
His special academic interests are

French civilization, the organiza
tion of Europe, city planning, and
the history of his native France.
His courses include those of
"World Literature," "Main Currents
in European Literature through the
Centuries," "Literature and Civiliza
tion," "Types of Criticism," "The
Napoleonic Legend in European and
American Literature," "The Spirit
of 1848 in Europe," "This Historical
Spirit in Literature," "Comparative
Literature," "International Litera
ture," "Comparative Literature," and
"The Doctrine of Art for Art's Sake."
Mrs. Guerard took her Master's
degree in history in 1909 when her
husband was an assistant professor
of French here. His son, Albert Jo
seph, '34, Ph.D. '138, has just returned
to the Harvard faculty after a leave
of absence to serve in the Army.
