## 
### 
Acting on a suggestion made by Bill Steif, Excom last night
unanimously passed a vote of confidence, in the name of the
Associated Students, in President' Donald B. Tresidder's admin
istration.
The action was taken following Excom's expressed disap-

proval and condemnation of the
anonymous postcards recently cir
culated against Dr. Tresidder.
Excom'.s statement is as follows:
"Ihc Executive Committee of
the Associated Students expresses
a vote of confidence in Dr. Tresid
der's administration, and most
sincerely condemns llie anony
mous authors of the postcards
that have heen circulated against
him."
Confronted with an unusually
large volume of business to cover
;nd with an unusually crowded
Excom room. Executive Committee
to take care of all and
more business than was on the
agenda.
Jack Wallace was appointed
A.S.S.IJ. president for summer
quarter. Oilier o'Ticers appointed
to summer quarter terms arc
Jackie Boucher, president of
Women's Conference; and Jane Ir
win, Merle ISeuttel, Joan Van de
Carr, Yvonne Guilbcrt, and Jean
Watson to Women's Council.
Appointment of A.S.S.U. vice
president, Conference vice-presi
dent and secretary, Excom members
(four women and four men), and
Men's Council members was post
poned until next weeks' meeting.
Stanford's hopes to send two men
to reprosent the Farm at the In
ternational Student Conference at
Prague this summer were tenta
tively clashed with the news that no
observers would be permitted at the
meeting. Final word on this is yet
to ccme from national headquarters.
Bob Collins proposed that the
A.S.S.U. set aside enough money
for a World Studies Fund to send
two junior students, to foreign col
leges each summer, to study stu
dent organization and university
setup there. Excom endorsed the
suggestion, expressing the hope
that the first two Stanford dele
gates might be able to go summer
of 1947.
Approved as independent, un
chartered organizations were the
Stanford Student Federalists (for
merly S.C.W.F.), Hindustan Stu
dents Association of America, and
Newman Club. Jewish Club, a local
organization, also received Excom
commendation.
