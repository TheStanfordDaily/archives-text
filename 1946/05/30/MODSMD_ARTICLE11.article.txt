# Talent Asked For Gaieties
## 
### 
If student talent exists on the
Farm, it is wanted now in the form
of songs, skits, and scripts for next
fall's Big Game Gaieties, announces
Wally Thompson, Gaieties publicity
bead.
Promising a student - written,
produced, and acted show, Gaieties
directors are urging living groups
to collaborate on skits. Tryouts will
be held early fall quarter, and the
most successful one chosen for pro
duction will bring a prize to the
living group or organization spon
soring it.
When the Gaieties appear, Farm
students will see a postwar revival
of one of Stanford's oldest tradi
tions. Presented the afternoon and
evening before Stanford's annual
Big Game with Cal, the Gaieties
were a highlight of an activities
packed Big Game weekend.
All ideas, songs, and scripts may
be submitted to Thompson, Newton
Arnold, or Lorna Robertson in the
Dramatic Council office, top floor of
the Old Union. Deadline for turn
ing in contributions is early fall
quarter.
