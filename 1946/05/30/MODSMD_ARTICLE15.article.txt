# 'Goat Song' Three-Slay Run Begins Tonight, 8:15
## 
### 
"Goat Song," a symbolical play by Franz Werfel, begins its
three-day run tonight at 8:15 in Memorial Auditorium.
For actual historical background, the scene is laid in the Slavic
countryside of the Danube during the 18th century when the
Christians were vassals to the Turks. However, the emphasis has

been placed on the underlying mean
ing of the play, and in its univer
sality, rather than on specific events
of the plot.
GOATS REVOLT
The symbolical significance of the
play has been interpreted with both
a religious and a social meaning. By
the end of the play, the author has
tried to show that in the very qual
ity of our human nature, everyone
Is half animal and half god. The
"Goat" itself has come to represent
the hidden thing within a person
which revolts against oppression.
Under the direction of F. Cowles
Strickland, the cast of 3o will be
headed by Harlen Adams in the
role of Stevan; Lorna Robertson as
Mirko's mother, and Ted Marcuse
as the student, Juvan. Mr. Adams
is assistant professor of speech and
drama department and has appeared
in several former productions in
cluding the '43-'44 performances of
"Poppa Is All," "School for Hus
bands," and "Candida."

of Ram's Head, has appeared in "My
Indian Family," "Sea Gull," "Gaie

"Goat Song," a symbolical play by Franz Werfel, begins its
three-day run tonight at 8:15 in Memorial Auditorium.
For actual historical background, the scene is laid in the Slavic
countryside of the Danube during the 18th century when the
Christians were vassals to the Turks. However, the emphasis has

been placed on the underlying mean
ing of the play, and in its univer
sality, rather than on specific events
of the plot.
GOATS REVOLT
The symbolical significance of the
play has been interpreted with both
a religious and a social meaning. By
the end of the play, the author has
tried to show that in the very qual
ity of our human nature, everyone
Is half animal and half god. The
"Goat" itself has come to represent
the hidden thing within a person
which revolts against oppression.
Under the direction of F. Cowles
Strickland, the cast of 3o will be
headed by Harlen Adams in the
role of Stevan; Lorna Robertson as
Mirko's mother, and Ted Marcuse
as the student, Juvan. Mr. Adams
