# Take It from There...

"A vote of confidence from the Executive
Committee" . . . that's to you, President Trec
idder. from the group which the students
elecied to represent them in an official ca
pacity. And we heartily second it.
We hope to see that vote of confidence
usher in a new year in which students, fac
ulty, and administration of this University
work in closer conjunction and knowledge
of each other's purposes and problems.
The Daily, way back in the '30s, used to
have a motto, "Cooperation Through Criti

cism," which we think could apply, with a
constructive interpretation, to the relation
ships of the various groups on campus. But
cooperation and criticism both are empty
words if they are not tempered with a car
tain amount of mutual faith.
On a personal basis, we suggest that this
period of tension is the time for each of us
to examine our own carefully-nurtured dog
matisms to see if they'll stand up under a
mature analysis of motives.
Take it from there.
