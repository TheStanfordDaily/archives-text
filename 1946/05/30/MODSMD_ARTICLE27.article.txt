# The 						Winds of Religious Freedom

### 
The statement published below was re
leased by the Committee on Student Affairs
last week as a reaffirmation of a long-stand
ing but little-publicized policy of the Uni
versity on the question of sectarian religious
ciga-iizations on the campus.
We feel that any student honestly seeking
information about or access to religious ex
perience should be given the widest possible
opportunity to do so through the University's
encouragement of outside speakers. If the
following policy can be applied to this end,
while protecting students from pressure to
join any particular group or attend its meet
ing, we heartily concur with the committee's
recommendations and definitions. We feel,
however, that the need for any such restric
tions would be obviated if the University
were to adopt a positive attitude and pro
gram of religious guidance.
"The Founding Grant of Stanford Univer
sity contains explicit provisions that the Uni
versity must be kept strictly nonsectarian in
character and entirely free from all denom
inational alliances, "however slight the bond
may be," The University accepts responsibil
ity for the spiritual needs of its students
through its chaplain and the nonsectarian
Memorial Church. Those students who de
sire directly denominational affiliation have
ready access to Palo Alto churches, and they
are entirely free to center their religious ac
tivities at these or at other churches of their
choice. Several such churches maintain stu
dent clubs, primarily for the benefit of Stan
ford students, which meet in church build
ings or at homes of church members. When,
however, any such club, or any other sectar
ian organization, wishes to hold a meeting
on the University campus, the provisions of
the Founding Grant make it necessary for the
University to require that certain important

limitations be observed. Such limitations
have been observed for many years.
Sectarian religious organizations may hold
meetings on campus if, and only if, they con
form to the following requirements:
1. —The organization must be approved by
the Associated Students o.f Stanford Univer
sity under Article I,X Section 3 (Independent
Organization of its Constitution.
2. —Any such meeting must be restricted
solely to students who are registered in
Stanford University and who belong to the
organization or expect to join it, and to mem
bers of the University staff.
3.—The only public announcement of the
meeting must be as follows: "The . . . Club
will meet at . . . (time) in . . . (place) . . . (Per
son) will speak. Open to members and stu
dent guests."
4.—The meeting must be held in a build
ing not owned and operated by the Univer
sity. (Note: This permits, for example, use of
the Women's Clubhouse if the Stanford Wom
en's Club is willing to allow such use. Use
of the Vestry of the Memorial Church is,
however, no longer permitted.)
s.—No speakers who are not registered
students or members of the University staff
may be present at such meeting, unless such
speakers are cleared through the Committee
on Public Exercises, in the manner required
of other organizations. No outside guests are
to be present.
The University cannot permit the setting
up of office or headquarters, or the perma
nent use of any room in any building on the
campus, by any sectarian organization for any
purpose.
Sectarian religious organizations approved
by the Associated Students of Stanford Uni
versity may list their officers in the section
of the Directory of Officers and Students pro
vided for clubs whether they hold meetings

through its chaplain and the nonsectarian
Memorial Church. Those students who de
sire directly denominational affiliation have
ready access to Palo Alto churches, and they
are entirely free to center their religious ac
tivities at these or at other churches of their
choice. Several such churches maintain stu
dent clubs, primarily for the benefit of Stan
ford students, which meet in church build
ings or at homes of church members. When,
however, any such club, or any other sectar
ian organization, wishes to hold a meeting
on the University campus, the provisions of
the Founding Grant make it necessary for the
University to require that certain important

limitations be observed. Such limitations
have been observed for many years.
Sectarian religious organizations may hold
meetings on campus if, and only if, they con
form to the following requirements:
1. —The organization must be approved by
the Associated Students o.f Stanford Univer
sity under Article I,X Section 3 (Independent
Organization of its Constitution.
2. —Any such meeting must be restricted
solely to students who are registered in
Stanford University and who belong to the
organization or expect to join it, and to mem
bers of the University staff.
3.—The only public announcement of the
meeting must be as follows: "The . . . Club
will meet at . . . (time) in . . . (place) . . . (Per
son) will speak. Open to members and stu
dent guests."
4.—The meeting must be held in a build
ing not owned and operated by the Univer
sity. (Note: This permits, for example, use of
the Women's Clubhouse if the Stanford Wom
en's Club is willing to allow such use. Use
of the Vestry of the Memorial Church is,
however, no longer permitted.)
s.—No speakers who are not registered
students or members of the University staff
may be present at such meeting, unless such
speakers are cleared through the Committee
on Public Exercises, in the manner required
of other organizations. No outside guests are
to be present.
The University cannot permit the setting
up of office or headquarters, or the perma
nent use of any room in any building on the
campus, by any sectarian organization for any
purpose.
Sectarian religious organizations approved
by the Associated Students of Stanford Uni
versity may list their officers in the section
of the Directory of Officers and Students pro
vided for clubs whether they hold meetings
on the campus or at other places."—BMV
The statement published below was re
leased by the Committee on Student Affairs
last week as a reaffirmation of a long-stand
ing but little-publicized policy of the Uni
versity on the question of sectarian religious
ciga-iizations on the campus.
We feel that any student honestly seeking
information about or access to religious ex
perience should be given the widest possible
opportunity to do so through the University's
encouragement of outside speakers. If the
following policy can be applied to this end,
while protecting students from pressure to
join any particular group or attend its meet
ing, we heartily concur with the committee's
recommendations and definitions. We feel,
however, that the need for any such restric
tions would be obviated if the University
were to adopt a positive attitude and pro
gram of religious guidance.
