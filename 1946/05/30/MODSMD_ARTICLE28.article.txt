### BILL STEIF 
No doubt, a prolonged railroad strike in the
United States would have really set this nation on
its collective heels. No doubt, some sort of legisla
tion which will imply greater responsibility for
union labor in the United States is necessary for
the public welfare.
Itut, in our opinion, Harry Truman's idea of
drafting recalcitrant workers striking against the
government (which is not at all what they arc
really striking against, anyway) into the army
is not the way to make unions more responsible.
Harry Truman, we think, is no Fascist, lie is an
honest, harried and possibly mediocre man. Unfor
tunately, the legislation which he proposed last
Saturday at a joint session of Congress (a type of
assemblage usually reserved for declarations of
war) smacks strongly of fascism.
The nub of his proposed legislation was that if,
after government seizure of a struck industry (per
missible under the President's war emergency pow
ers), the workers of that industry refused to return
to work, i.e., struck against the government, the
President is to determine whether "continued oper
ation of any such plant, mine or facility is vitally
necessary to the maintenance of the national ocon
cmy" (Section 2 of the proposed law) and if he so
determines, "the President may by proclamation
declare the existence of a national emergency rela
tive to the interruption of operations."
I he bill then provides for a bit of legalistic ma
neuvering, after which it says that "any person
who has failed or refused, without permission of
the President, to return to work . . . shall be in
ducted into the Army of the United States at
such a time, in such manner (with or without
oath) and on such terms and conditions as may
be prescribed by the President, as being necessary
in his judgment to provide for the emergency"
(Section 7 of the proposed law).
Defenders of this neat little piece of legislation
note that "it is only for six months," but the way
we read it says,"The provision of this act shall
cease to be effective six months after the cessation
of hostilities, as proclaimed by the President" (Sec
tion 10) or by a "concurrent resolution" of both
houses of Congress. This is the famous "duration
and six" about which we used to hear so much if
v/e are not completely mistaken. Your guess as to

when "the emergency" will end is as good (and
probably better) than ours.
Now we wonder whether you see why we con
sider this pretty little package an opening wedge
for autocracy?
This proposed federal law causes the Army of
the United States, which is an instrument for na
tional defense, to be used as the coercive force to
keep workers "in line." There is still, in our mind
at least, a definite difference between the Army
this nation from foreign countries and
the Army defending us from ourselves. The latter
is a dictatorial technique quite in the pattern which
Mussolini and Hitler established.
If we do not think ourselves capable of settling
our disputes, even in a highly integrated indus
trial society, then we must concede that we lost
the war, that democracy will not work and that
the group which controls the Army is the group
which controls this huwl in slavery. That both the
Marxist and Fascist concepts of revolution and
counter-revolution are evident herein goes with
out further mention.
The powers given to the President in this legisla
tion aie, obviously, greater than have ever been
given to any other President of the United States.
But this is merely a corollary of what we have
touched upon already. As Commander-in-Chief of
the Army the President would naturally have these
powers.
The bill has already passed the lower house of
Congress. It passed last Saturday less than two
hours after its introduction. There were no com
mittee hearings, no reports on the law. It passed
by a 306 to 13 vote, almost reminiscent of Reichstag
balloting in the earliest days of the Nazi regime.
The bill is now before the Senate. Whether or
not it will pass seems to us one of the truly impor
tant national questions of the day.
We must admit that we have no other proposition
in mind which will give unions to understand their
responsibility for the general welfare of the Ameri
can people. We say only that the method which
Harry Truman, in a fit of mild hysteria perhaps,
advocates for the settlement of labor disputes is
essentially undemocratic.
In seeking to breach the wall which stands be
tween the rooms of management and labor we
cannot afford to destroy our house.

who has failed or refused, without permission of
the President, to return to work . . . shall be in
ducted into the Army of the United States at
such a time, in such manner (with or without
oath) and on such terms and conditions as may
be prescribed by the President, as being necessary
in his judgment to provide for the emergency"
(Section 7 of the proposed law).
Defenders of this neat little piece of legislation
note that "it is only for six months," but the way
we read it says,"The provision of this act shall
cease to be effective six months after the cessation
of hostilities, as proclaimed by the President" (Sec
tion 10) or by a "concurrent resolution" of both
houses of Congress. This is the famous "duration
and six" about which we used to hear so much if
v/e are not completely mistaken. Your guess as to

when "the emergency" will end is as good (and
probably better) than ours.
Now we wonder whether you see why we con
sider this pretty little package an opening wedge
for autocracy?
This proposed federal law causes the Army of
the United States, which is an instrument for na
tional defense, to be used as the coercive force to
keep workers "in line." There is still, in our mind
at least, a definite difference between the Army
this nation from foreign countries and
the Army defending us from ourselves. The latter
is a dictatorial technique quite in the pattern which
Mussolini and Hitler established.
If we do not think ourselves capable of settling
our disputes, even in a highly integrated indus
trial society, then we must concede that we lost
the war, that democracy will not work and that
the group which controls the Army is the group
which controls this huwl in slavery. That both the
Marxist and Fascist concepts of revolution and
counter-revolution are evident herein goes with
out further mention.
The powers given to the President in this legisla
tion aie, obviously, greater than have ever been
given to any other President of the United States.
But this is merely a corollary of what we have
touched upon already. As Commander-in-Chief of
the Army the President would naturally have these
powers.
The bill has already passed the lower house of
Congress. It passed last Saturday less than two
hours after its introduction. There were no com
mittee hearings, no reports on the law. It passed
by a 306 to 13 vote, almost reminiscent of Reichstag
balloting in the earliest days of the Nazi regime.
The bill is now before the Senate. Whether or
not it will pass seems to us one of the truly impor
tant national questions of the day.
We must admit that we have no other proposition
in mind which will give unions to understand their
responsibility for the general welfare of the Ameri
can people. We say only that the method which
Harry Truman, in a fit of mild hysteria perhaps,
advocates for the settlement of labor disputes is
essentially undemocratic.
In seeking to breach the wall which stands be
tween the rooms of management and labor we
cannot afford to destroy our house.
No doubt, a prolonged railroad strike in the
United States would have really set this nation on
its collective heels. No doubt, some sort of legisla
tion which will imply greater responsibility for
union labor in the United States is necessary for
the public welfare.
Itut, in our opinion, Harry Truman's idea of
drafting recalcitrant workers striking against the
government (which is not at all what they arc
really striking against, anyway) into the army
is not the way to make unions more responsible.
Harry Truman, we think, is no Fascist, lie is an
honest, harried and possibly mediocre man. Unfor
tunately, the legislation which he proposed last
Saturday at a joint session of Congress (a type of
assemblage usually reserved for declarations of
war) smacks strongly of fascism.
The nub of his proposed legislation was that if,
after government seizure of a struck industry (per
missible under the President's war emergency pow
ers), the workers of that industry refused to return
to work, i.e., struck against the government, the
President is to determine whether "continued oper
ation of any such plant, mine or facility is vitally
necessary to the maintenance of the national ocon
cmy" (Section 2 of the proposed law) and if he so
determines, "the President may by proclamation
declare the existence of a national emergency rela
tive to the interruption of operations."
I he bill then provides for a bit of legalistic ma
neuvering, after which it says that "any person
who has failed or refused, without permission of
the President, to return to work . . . shall be in
ducted into the Army of the United States at
such a time, in such manner (with or without
oath) and on such terms and conditions as may
be prescribed by the President, as being necessary
in his judgment to provide for the emergency"
(Section 7 of the proposed law).

Mussolini and Hitler established.
If we do not think ourselves capable of settling
our disputes, even in a highly integrated indus
trial society, then we must concede that we lost
the war, that democracy will not work and that
the group which controls the Army is the group
which controls this huwl in slavery. That both the
Marxist and Fascist concepts of revolution and
counter-revolution are evident herein goes with
out further mention.
The powers given to the President in this legisla
tion aie, obviously, greater than have ever been
given to any other President of the United States.
But this is merely a corollary of what we have
touched upon already. As Commander-in-Chief of
the Army the President would naturally have these
powers.
The bill has already passed the lower house of
Congress. It passed last Saturday less than two
hours after its introduction. There were no com
mittee hearings, no reports on the law. It passed
by a 306 to 13 vote, almost reminiscent of Reichstag
balloting in the earliest days of the Nazi regime.
The bill is now before the Senate. Whether or
not it will pass seems to us one of the truly impor
tant national questions of the day.
We must admit that we have no other proposition
in mind which will give unions to understand their
responsibility for the general welfare of the Ameri
can people. We say only that the method which
Harry Truman, in a fit of mild hysteria perhaps,
advocates for the settlement of labor disputes is
essentially undemocratic.
In seeking to breach the wall which stands be
tween the rooms of management and labor we
cannot afford to destroy our house.
