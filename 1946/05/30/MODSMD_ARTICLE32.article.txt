# Stanford Looks At World Today; Professors Interpret News
## Lewis Calls Off Strike; Hopkins Deplores Policies 
### VIRGINIA SCHULTZ 
WASHINGTON, May 29 (UP).
—UMW Boss John L. Lewis
called off the crippling soft coal
strike today and accepted a fed
eral wage contract which will
send his 400,000 miners back

into the government - seized
pits Friday with a pay boost of
51.85 a day and about one-third
of their welfare fund demands.

Criticizing the lack of leadership
from the White House in the coal
and railroad strike, William S. Hop
kins, professor of economics, de
plored the improvised policies which
the government has used in settling
the recent major industrial strikes.
In the coal strike settled yester
day United Mine Workers' Presi
dent John L. Lewis undoubtedly
got about as much as he expected
from his demands. The issues
were really not as radical as they
seem at first glance, Mr. Hopkins
emphasized.
"The welfare plan, although it
sounds like a lot of money, is ac
tually not much per man. It has
been called revolutionary, but the
only real revolutionary thing about
it is its being applied to a whole
industry instead of one particular

organization," Mr. Hopkins empha
sized.
Lewis is returning to his former
conservative political position of
IM2. He had been labor adviser
to the Republican National Com
mittee up till then and only left
the party ranks during Mr. Roose
velt's first two terms. He has un
doubtedly been glad to embarrass
President Truman while at the
same time getting belter terms
for the miners, for "he is not ad
verse to sticking the miner's poli
cies into politics."
The welfare fund, which was the
main issue in the coal strike is gen
erally not understood, Mr. Hopkins
believes. "Mines are hazardous
places in spite of the many safety
devices now known and used. A
large proportion of the mines are
little ones with obsolete and old
fashioned equipment rather than
the complete modern devices we
generally think of."
This danger is somewhat offset
by industrial accident compensa
tion which in some states, such as
California, Pennsylvania, and New
York, is adequate but in others,
like Alabama and Kentucky, is
very much below the level of the
northern states. The welfare plan
purposes to supplement and even
out the state benefits so they will
be adequate to all. This type of
royalty is not new. it has been
used to some extent before.
"Management did not object to
this plan as much as was expected,"
said Mr.- Hopkins. "And the opera
tors realized they had no statewide
organization to administer it as the
union does. Under the compromise
the operators will probably have to
set up a permanent unit to work
with the union."

JERSEY CITY, N. J., May 29
(UP). — Engineers and trainmen
of the Hudson and Manhattan
Line, which daily carries some
200,000 commuters between New
York and New Jersey cities, voted
at a mass meeting tonight to strike
tomorrow morning at 4 a.m.

The recently settled rail strike was
a definite example of presidential
bungling, pointed out Mr. Hopkins.
Neither management nor rail work
ers expected nor wanted it.
Instead of taking over the rail

road after (he strike was called
Mr. Truman dramatically signed
the document the Monday before
the deadline. This stopped all Jie
gotiations four days before the
strike, for the brotherhood then
had to deal with the government.
Whitney bad no alternative but to
call the strike with the!) 8 per cent
strike vote behind him.
The solution to the strike prob
lem, Mr. Hopkins believes, is set
ting up a definite policy. A govern
ment board for voluntary arbitra
tion, similar to the War Labor Board
but not making arbitration compul
sory, should be established.
This would give a continuity in
policy in place of the discontinuity
which results from Truman ap
pointing a definite committee for
each labor crisis. This committee
would have a known policy and
would provide a place for disput
ing people to go and know what
to expect.

—UMW Boss John L. Lewis
called off the crippling soft coal
strike today and accepted a fed
eral wage contract which will
send his 400,000 miners back

into the government - seized
pits Friday with a pay boost of
51.85 a day and about one-third
of their welfare fund demands.

Criticizing the lack of leadership
from the White House in the coal
and railroad strike, William S. Hop
kins, professor of economics, de
plored the improvised policies which
the government has used in settling
the recent major industrial strikes.
In the coal strike settled yester
day United Mine Workers' Presi
dent John L. Lewis undoubtedly
got about as much as he expected
from his demands. The issues
were really not as radical as they
seem at first glance, Mr. Hopkins
emphasized.
"The welfare plan, although it
sounds like a lot of money, is ac
tually not much per man. It has
been called revolutionary, but the
only real revolutionary thing about
it is its being applied to a whole
industry instead of one particular

organization," Mr. Hopkins empha
sized.
Lewis is returning to his former
conservative political position of
IM2. He had been labor adviser
to the Republican National Com
mittee up till then and only left
the party ranks during Mr. Roose
velt's first two terms. He has un
doubtedly been glad to embarrass
President Truman while at the
same time getting belter terms
for the miners, for "he is not ad
verse to sticking the miner's poli
cies into politics."
The welfare fund, which was the
main issue in the coal strike is gen
erally not understood, Mr. Hopkins
believes. "Mines are hazardous
places in spite of the many safety
devices now known and used. A
large proportion of the mines are
little ones with obsolete and old
fashioned equipment rather than
the complete modern devices we
generally think of."
This danger is somewhat offset
by industrial accident compensa
tion which in some states, such as
California, Pennsylvania, and New
York, is adequate but in others,
like Alabama and Kentucky, is
very much below the level of the
northern states. The welfare plan
purposes to supplement and even
out the state benefits so they will
be adequate to all. This type of
royalty is not new. it has been
used to some extent before.
