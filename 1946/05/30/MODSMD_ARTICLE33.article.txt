# French Apply for Atom Bomb Patent; Kirkpatrick Says Move 'No Surprise'

STOCKHOLM, May 29 (UP).
—Three French atomic scien
tists have applied for a Swedish
patent on a 1940 atomic energy
process markedly similar to the
American process, and it is be
lieved the Russians also are in
possession of the same formula,
a Swedish scientist disclosed
today.

"Sounds as if they have a process
to produce plutonium," commented
Professor Paul Kirkpatrick, head of
the Physics Department, as he read
the UP dispatch telling of three
French atomic scientists who have
applied for Swedish patents on an
atomic energy process similar to
the American.
"Plutonium," he explains, "under
goes the same explosion that U-235
does." Further, Professor Kirkpat
rick said, the move of the three
French scientists was "not very sur
prising. We could keep our secret
just so long but the facts are basic
and known to scientists everywhere

and they were bound to leak out."
NOT SO SIMPLE
Asked if he thought this might
mean that Sweden—and then other
nations, could produce an atomic
bomb, the physics head said "it isn't
as simple as that. The UP story is
too simplified to tell clearly which
of the many bomb problems were
solved. It isn't as if a formula would
j solve the problems."
The news that others had reached
| the point of patenting an atomic
j process may have repercussions, es
j pecially among some congressmen
i who are for "keeping tlfe atomic
I bomb secret."
I "We're taking a long chance," says
j Dr. Kirkpatrick, "if we put too much
j trust in no one else getting the se
cret."
CONGRESS LEARNING
Asked if he thought congressmen
, who had previously voted to keep
! the bomb secret might change their
i minds now, the physicist revealed
: that he understood that congress
! men were now being coached in spe
| cial classes on some of the funda
| mentals of atomic energy. "They're
! beginning to see the problems more

t clearly now," he said.
"I can't say which country could
! produce bombs or how long it would
take," he concluded. "Anyway, pro
j duction is out of my field."
"One thing, though," he conclud
| ed, "it should dispose of the line
I that we can have safety by keeping
| the secret."
