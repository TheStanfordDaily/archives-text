# Nationalists Take Kirin; Cressey, Chan Comment
## 
### BOYD HAIGHT 
Chinese National troops cap
tured the important Manchurian
city of Kirin (Yungki), east of
Changchun, Wednesday night,
the government's Central News
Agency announced according
to yesterday's San Francisco
Chronicle.

Dr. George B. Cressey and Dr.
Shau Wing Chan, two Stanford au
thorities on the Far East, take the
long-range viewpoint in considering
current Nationalist - Communist
clashes in Manchuria.
â€¢
Dr. Cressey urges that we pass up
day by day reports for an over-all
weekly or monthly analysis. He
states that our go-getter, rotaiian
spirit must become reconciled to the
slowness of the East.
Dr. Cressey states that he is
"realistically optimistic" about the
Chinese situation.
"I am confident that China will
find herself, and in our lifetime she
will become one of the greatest na
tions in eastern Asia if not in the
world."
Dr. Cressey is visiting professor
of geography from Syracuse Uni
versity and has spent many years
in travel in the Far East, teaching
for six years at the University oi
Shanghai.
DEMOCRACY FIGHT
Dr. Chan refutes the general im
pression that the civil war means
all is not going too well in China.
"The civil war is an indication
that political democracy has to be
fought for rather than gained
through a sudden dawning with no
effort."
"I hope that the Communists will
I go on constituting a major chal
lenge and a strong rival to the Na-
I tionalists as the best means of in
suring democracy."
"WILL COMPROMISE"
"It is my personal belief that if
I they are given the necessary time
and opportunities to work things
out the Nationalists and Commu
nists will agree on a compromise."
Dr. Chan is associate professor
jof Chinese and Humanities. He
served as advisor and consultant on
I China to the International Secre
j tariat at the San Francisco Confer
ence last spring.
