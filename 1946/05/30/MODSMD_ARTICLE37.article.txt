# Gromyko Says U.N. Dominated
## 
### JOANNE O'BRIEN 
NEW YORK, May 29 (UP).—
Andrei A. Gromyko, Russian
delegate to the United Nations
Security Council, charged to
night that the tendency of cer
tain countries to "dominate" the
i UN may compromise the "whole
cause of maintaing peace and
j security."
In an obvious but indirect
slap at Great Britain and the
United States for their stand on
the Iranian matter, Gromyko
said that "developments since
the establishment of the United
| Nations have shown that not
everything is well within that
I organization."

With the world spotlight con
stantly being focused on Russia,
Russian demands, Russian refusals,
and clashes with Russia over peace
terms, there seems to be a definite
need for an attempt by this country
to reach some kind of understanding
with the Russian government and
people, said Harold H. Fisher, pro
fessor of history at Stanford,
This problem is a huge one. In ■
"What American People Think of
Russia" Mr. W. B. Walsh of Syra- ;
cuse stated that in studying various |
public opinion polls only one per
son in ten understands Russia. This
is a situation that needs correction
not only for an immediate peace
treaty now but also for future se
curity.
RECOC;NITION WANTED
"We must understand," caid Mr.
Fisher, "that one of the main rea
sons why the Russians seem to be
opposing many of our peace propo
sals is because they want to be rec
ognized as equal in two senses. They
not only want to be equal in power
but also equal in the sense that we
recognize the Soviet democracy on
the same basis, with other govern
ments."
A freer interchange of ideas

would ease up the suspicion that i
both countries feel toward each (
j other. In this respect, Mr. Fisher |
: feels that Russia should give our | j
correspondents more leeway in re- I ,
: porting news without censorship and
, bias.
: REVOLUTION GOING ON
Mr. Fisher went on to say, "We
j can assure the failure of the United
j Nations Organization, and we can
I prepare the way for war if we base
our policy on the assumption that
communism is a kind of criminal
conspiracy, hatched in Russia and
spread abroad by agents working
for the Soviet government. We must
recognize that we are living in one
of the great revolutions in human
history. Communism is offering a
series of alternatives to the system
of capitalism and representative in
stitutions as we know them." Some
of us consider our democratic way j
i of life as the only one for the whole j
world. What we do not consider is

that although the democratic way i
of life is adaptable for Americans, I
the Russian people are entirely dif
ferent, they are a different nation
ality, they live in a different en
vironment, and they have had a dif
ferent political history. You could
not suddenly force the representa
tive type of government on the Rus
sians because they would not know
what to do with it.

, SUGGESTIONS OFFERED
I Mr. Fisher concluded by offering
some positive suggestions which
would help cement Russo-American
relations:
"Cooperation in scientific, artistic,
and intellectual life. Cooperation in
economic development of backward
and undeveloped regions. Coopera
tion in the control of atomic energy
and leadership in disarmament."

some positive suggestions which

relations:
"Cooperation in scientific, artistic,

economic development of backward

and leadership in disarmament."
NEW YORK, May 29 (UP).—
Andrei A. Gromyko, Russian
delegate to the United Nations
Security Council, charged to
night that the tendency of cer
tain countries to "dominate" the
i UN may compromise the "whole
cause of maintaing peace and
j security."
In an obvious but indirect
slap at Great Britain and the
United States for their stand on
the Iranian matter, Gromyko
said that "developments since
the establishment of the United
| Nations have shown that not
everything is well within that
I organization."

With the world spotlight con
stantly being focused on Russia,
Russian demands, Russian refusals,
and clashes with Russia over peace
terms, there seems to be a definite
need for an attempt by this country
to reach some kind of understanding
with the Russian government and
people, said Harold H. Fisher, pro
fessor of history at Stanford,
This problem is a huge one. In ■
"What American People Think of
Russia" Mr. W. B. Walsh of Syra- ;
cuse stated that in studying various |
public opinion polls only one per
son in ten understands Russia. This
is a situation that needs correction
not only for an immediate peace
treaty now but also for future se
curity.
RECOC;NITION WANTED
"We must understand," caid Mr.
Fisher, "that one of the main rea
sons why the Russians seem to be
opposing many of our peace propo
sals is because they want to be rec
ognized as equal in two senses. They
not only want to be equal in power
but also equal in the sense that we
recognize the Soviet democracy on
the same basis, with other govern
ments."
