# Iranian Student Masters U.S. Customs, Language in a Year
## 
### BOYD HAIGHT 
Imagine if you will that you've
just arrived in Iran. You've come
to study but you can't speak a
word of the language. You have no
friends; you've only recently fin
ished high school in the United
States; you don't know a Shah from
the Rubaiyat but you're willing to
learn;that's why you've come.
Looking in a year later we find
that your persistence has paid off.
You speak the language fluently;
you wear Persian clothes as if you'd
worn them all your life; you ob
serve Persian customs with ease.
You have many friends; you've
traveled a grat deal; you're now a
Persian.
PROCEDURE REVERSED
Think you could do it? Well,
there's a Stanford student who has,

only in reverse. He's Hafez Far
manfarmaian, a native of Tehran.
Iran.
Hafez, whose family is of royal
blood, arrived in the United States
just one year ago. He enrolled at
Montezuma School for Boys at Los
Gatos for a few months before en
tering Stanford last fall.
Speaking excellent English, Ha
fez said, "You know, when I first
began classes at Stanford I couldn't
understand a word the lecturers
were saying; it made studying rath
er difficult."
NO MORE TROUBLE
Persistent study on his English in
a course for foreign students got
results for Hafez and lectures no
longer give him trouble.
Tall, good-looking, with flashing
black eyes, Hafez has given himself

completely to American student life.
He looks forward to every new
contact with Western life which will
open a door for him to the attain
ment of our attitudes and culture.
HASHES AT CELLAR
Hafez is majoring in civil engi
neering and, in addition, has de
veloped an interest in classical mu
sic and American literature; still
his whole life is not in books. He
hashes at the Cellar and knows how
to take life easy as does every
Stanford rough.
The story of Hafez's coming to the
United States goes back to the war
in Europe. Ordinarily young Per
sians of royal blood receive their
higher education in Europe, par
ticularly France, after finishing the
equivalent of a high school educa
tion at home. Conditions in Europe

put an end to this and Hafez was j
sent instead to America.
WANTS ENGINEERING
He plans, to take back with him
to Persia a skill and knowledge in
engineering technics to build dams
and establish irrigation projects
which will help raise the standard
of living of people in his country.
Hafez's desire to be of aid in the
development of Persia is a family
affair. He has one brother study
ing journalism at Cal, another stud- |
ying agricultural engineering at the j
University of Wisconsin, and a sis- j
ter who will receive her A.B. in !
sociology at U.S.C. in June.
Stanford is Hafez's home now;
he's happy here but is looking ahead
to his return to Iran and what he j
can accomplish then with what he
is learning now.

that your persistence has paid off.
You speak the language fluently;
you wear Persian clothes as if you'd
worn them all your life; you ob
serve Persian customs with ease.
You have many friends; you've
traveled a grat deal; you're now a
Persian.
PROCEDURE REVERSED
Think you could do it? Well,
there's a Stanford student who has,

only in reverse. He's Hafez Far
manfarmaian, a native of Tehran.
Iran.
Hafez, whose family is of royal
blood, arrived in the United States
just one year ago. He enrolled at
Montezuma School for Boys at Los
Gatos for a few months before en
tering Stanford last fall.
Speaking excellent English, Ha
fez said, "You know, when I first
began classes at Stanford I couldn't
understand a word the lecturers
were saying; it made studying rath
er difficult."
NO MORE TROUBLE
Persistent study on his English in
a course for foreign students got
results for Hafez and lectures no
longer give him trouble.
Tall, good-looking, with flashing
black eyes, Hafez has given himself

completely to American student life.
He looks forward to every new
contact with Western life which will
open a door for him to the attain
ment of our attitudes and culture.
HASHES AT CELLAR
Hafez is majoring in civil engi
neering and, in addition, has de
veloped an interest in classical mu
sic and American literature; still
his whole life is not in books. He
hashes at the Cellar and knows how
to take life easy as does every
Stanford rough.
The story of Hafez's coming to the
United States goes back to the war
in Europe. Ordinarily young Per
sians of royal blood receive their
higher education in Europe, par
ticularly France, after finishing the
equivalent of a high school educa
tion at home. Conditions in Europe

put an end to this and Hafez was j
sent instead to America.
WANTS ENGINEERING
He plans, to take back with him
to Persia a skill and knowledge in
engineering technics to build dams
and establish irrigation projects
which will help raise the standard
of living of people in his country.
Hafez's desire to be of aid in the
development of Persia is a family
affair. He has one brother study
ing journalism at Cal, another stud- |
ying agricultural engineering at the j
University of Wisconsin, and a sis- j
ter who will receive her A.B. in !
sociology at U.S.C. in June.
Stanford is Hafez's home now;
he's happy here but is looking ahead
to his return to Iran and what he j
can accomplish then with what he
is learning now.
Imagine if you will that you've
just arrived in Iran. You've come
to study but you can't speak a
word of the language. You have no
friends; you've only recently fin
ished high school in the United
States; you don't know a Shah from
the Rubaiyat but you're willing to
learn;that's why you've come.
Looking in a year later we find
that your persistence has paid off.
You speak the language fluently;
you wear Persian clothes as if you'd
worn them all your life; you ob
serve Persian customs with ease.
