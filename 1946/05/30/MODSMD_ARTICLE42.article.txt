# Senate, House Pass Case Bill; Truman Veto Asked
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 29 (UP).—
A rebellious Congress today chal
lenged President Truman to a show
down with labor by passing the
controversial Case anti-strike bill
and howling down his proposal to
conscript workers who strike against
the government.
Administration leaders immedi
ately clamored for a presidential
veto of the Case hill.
In a few tension-packed hours,
the House and Senate handed Mr.
Truman the heaviest on'j-two blow
of his short presidential career and
all but knocked the props out from
under his shaky legislative plat
form.
The Senate followed through by
voting, 70 to 13, to strike out the
main provision of the emergency
labor powers bill Mr. Truman laid
before the joint .session of Congress

last Saturday—the presidential au
thority to draft strikers in a gov- j
ernment-seized industry.

WASHINGTON, May 2!) (UP).
—Congressmen of California vot
ed on the Case hill today as fol
lows:
For: Johnson and Phillips.
Against: Dovvle, lloliHeld, Out -
land, and Voorhis.
Absent or not voting: Ander
son, Douglas, Elliott, Engle, Gear
hart, ljavenner, Healy, Hinshaw,
lzac, King, Lea, McDonough, Mil
ler, Patterson, Sheppard, Tolan,

Administration spokesmen were
sibnt on the Senate action, which
tore out what Senate Democratic
Leader Alben W. Barkley, Ky.,
called the "guts" of the President's
program.
But their reaction to the Case bill
was swift and vehement. Secretary
of Labor Lewis B. Schwellenbach
issued a statement denouncing the
measure and calling upon President
Iruman to veto it promptly.
