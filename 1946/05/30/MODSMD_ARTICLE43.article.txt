# Students Anticipate Month of Mexican Travel; To Visit Shrines, Palaces, Markets, Bullfights
## 
### 
Armed with train schedules and j
Mexican pamphlets, more than 30
Stanford students recently emerged
from the home of Professor Juan B.
Rael. As they scattered to their
houses, they were discussing the
possibilities of cramming a month's J
wardrobe into two suitcases. High
on the list of necessities were :
heavy hiking shoes "for cobblestone
streets."
These students will split into two
groups to visit Mexico this summer.
The first will entrain on June 23; |
their successors will leave on Au
gust 22. As each group boards its |
private pullman, some 20 people j
will look forward to a month of |
colorful travel and study.
SPANISH OPTIONAL
Spanish majors will predominate,
but Dr. Rael has welcomed inter-,]
ested students from other depart
ments as well. Some will speak
Spanish fluently; others will con
stantly refer to elementary text
books.
Both parties will abandon their |
trains at Guadalajara, less than 24
hours after the departure from Los :
Angeles. There they will have four- j
clay hotel reservations which will j
permit them to explore the second ,
largest city in Mexico together with 1
the country surrounding it. They
expect to charter several private j
cars, each equipped with a guide
who can speak English if necessary. |
LANDMARK TOUR
From Guadalajara, the tourists I
will travel gradually toward Mex- \
ico City, visiting market places and
shrines, some ol the most famous
landmarks of Mexico. They will
pass through the pottery village of
San Pedro Tlaquepaque and along j
beautiful Lake Chapala where they
will pause for boating and picnics.
About a we<?k after leaving the
United States, they will arrive in 1
Mexico City.
In the capital city itself, they will
explore old streets and famous
buildings; they will shop in the
bustling Zoloco (or central square);
and those who wish to do so will
attend th Q bull fights.
From Mexico City parties will
make excursions to the shrine ol

Guadalupe where the Virgin Mary '
is said to have appeared to a hum- ;
ble Indian; to the ancient Indian
Pyramids of the Sun and the Moon;
to Xochimilco, famous for its float- j
ing gardens, and to innumerable pic- j
turesque places of Mexican culture. I
