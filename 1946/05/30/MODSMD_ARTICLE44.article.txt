### MARY VIRGINIA POND 
In a world of bickering nations,
vieing with each other lor control
of peoples and material resources, |
Stanford's International Club re
mains representative of students all
over the world who continue to
hope for peace and co-operation on 1
an international scale.
During the past year the"I" Club '
has been for both American and for- |
eign students, faculty, and Admin
istration a means of getting together ,
informally to gain a better under
standing of each country's customs,
culture, and ideas.
PRINCIPAL PURPOSE
"The principal purpose of the In
ternational Club," stated John Men

zel, president, "is for American and
foreign students to be able to un
derstand each ather."

The"I" Club will close its year
ot activities when it gives its tra
ditional quarterly banquet for
members and guests Sunday, 5::<0
p.m., at the home of Mr. and Mrs.
Edwin J. Thomas.
Taskebahi, well-known Turkish
dish, will be prepared and served
by the Turkish students with 11a
yati Balkanli as chief chef.
All International Club members
who have not received letters
about the banquet should phone
or write Kathleen Maguire at
Ruble to make immediate reser
vations. Only (10 places will be
served.

Menzel pointed out that the for
eign students who come to the Uni
ted Slates for their education are
the "cream of the crop" of the na
tions they represent and were cho
sen because they "will be the future
leaders of their nations."
"Therefore the impressions that

they get of us now will govern their
attitudes toward us in the futurs,"
he said.
1 HOUSE AIM
The"I" Club's big aim for the
future is tbe establishment of an
International House on campus
I similar to the"I" Houses at the
University of California, Chicago,
| and Columbia.
The International House would
provide an ev«n greater opportunity
I for the students to get first-hand in
formation on the economic, social,
I and political situations of the vari
-1 ous nations.
ORIENTATION MEANS
It would also be a better means
for students to orient themselves to
campus life. The present Students'
Welcoming Committee is a small
step in that direction.

mains representative of students all
over the world who continue to
hope for peace and co-operation on 1

During the past year the"I" Club '
has been for both American and for- |
eign students, faculty, and Admin
istration a means of getting together ,
informally to gain a better under
standing of each country's customs,
culture, and ideas.
PRINCIPAL PURPOSE
"The principal purpose of the In

foreign students to be able to un
derstand each ather."

eign students who come to the Uni
ted Slates for their education are
the "cream of the crop" of the na
tions they represent and were cho
sen because they "will be the future
leaders of their nations."
"Therefore the impressions that

they get of us now will govern their
attitudes toward us in the futurs,"
he said.
1 HOUSE AIM
The"I" Club's big aim for the
future is tbe establishment of an
International House on campus
I similar to the"I" Houses at the
University of California, Chicago,
| and Columbia.
The International House would
provide an ev«n greater opportunity
I for the students to get first-hand in
formation on the economic, social,
I and political situations of the vari
-1 ous nations.
ORIENTATION MEANS
It would also be a better means
for students to orient themselves to
campus life. The present Students'
Welcoming Committee is a small
step in that direction.
