# Unsung Redlands Combine Splatters Farm betters 8-1, Rutledge Only Winner
## 
### 
Turning in ono of the most professional-looking tennis exhibitions seen on the local courts this
season, a sparkling Redlands net team thoroughly trounced Stanford, 8-1, yesterday.
The unheralded southerners continually took the play away from the Indians and built up
the lopsided margin. Nevertheless the Stanford scfuad was not as inept as the final score may
indicate, and a few of the breaks during the long afternon might have turned the tide.

But for the steady stroking of No.
1 man Bob Rutledge, the Indians
would have gone down to a complete
w' litewashing. Fortunately Bob
came through to trip up Richards,
8-6, 6-3, and chalk up the "one and
only" Stanford victory of the day.
Meanwhile the remainder of the
Cardinal squad was having nothing
but trouble at the hands of the sen
sational Redlands entry. Sole con
solation to Farm fans is that six of
the contests were forced to three
sets before the invaders emerged
the winner.
Only date remaining on the Stan
ford net schedule is the important
California engagement in Berkeley
this Saturday. The outcome of to
day's Redlands-California encoun
ter promises to shed sopie light
upon just how Stanford will fair
against the Bears.
