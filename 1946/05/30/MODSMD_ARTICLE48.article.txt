# 'Dahlia' Rated Vigorous Show
## 
### 
The Stanford Theater is enjoying
land-office business with its cur
l rent attraction, '"The Blue Dahlia,"
j which was written by that man who
i tears down Hollywood in order to
| build up his bank roll, Raymond
Chandler. Mr. Chandler has assent
' bled his usual bunch of night club
| gigolos and easy-living gigolettes
! who enjoy blackmail for breakfast
j and terror for tea.
•Alan Ladd returns from the wars
to find that his screen wife, Doris
j Dowling (Ray Milland's pick-me
up in "The Lost Weekend), has been
paying the rent at a Sunset Strip
gin-mill, The Blue Dahlia, mainly
because of its smooth-talking and
thinking owner, Howard da Sylva.
Miss Dowling, in the words of one
of Mr. Chandler's characters, is
"croaked" almost immediately,
| which necessitates the abduction
| of her slayer from among a rather
i unsavory group of individuals. <
VIGOROUS ENTERTAINMENT
"The Blue Dahlia" is good vigor-
I ous entertainment with plenty of
j tough talk provided by Mr. Ladd,
j Veronica Lake, Bill Bendix, and a
| nosey house detective ("house-
I peeper" 1 think is Mr. Chandler's
1 term) named Will Wright. Chan
j dler gives an almost incredible por
trayal of his clientele, most of
I whom experience everything from
I heartbreak to hangover. I think
! that you'll agree with me in hearty
i approval of "The Blue Dahlia."
i OUTLAW UNWRAPPED
j The United Artists, Esquire, and
' Tivoli theaters in San Francisco
' have finally unwrapped "The Out
law," Howard Hughes' steamheated
version of life in the days of Billy
the Kid. Jane Russell, the tired
j businessman's home companion,
seems to be the center of attrac
! tion. Quick, students, what are Miss
j Russell's two biggest claims to suc
j cess? Answer —she uses Pond's
' crcam and drinks Mission Bell
| wine.

The Stanford Theater is enjoying
land-office business with its cur
l rent attraction, '"The Blue Dahlia,"
j which was written by that man who
i tears down Hollywood in order to
| build up his bank roll, Raymond
Chandler. Mr. Chandler has assent
' bled his usual bunch of night club
| gigolos and easy-living gigolettes
! who enjoy blackmail for breakfast
j and terror for tea.
•Alan Ladd returns from the wars
to find that his screen wife, Doris
j Dowling (Ray Milland's pick-me
up in "The Lost Weekend), has been
paying the rent at a Sunset Strip
gin-mill, The Blue Dahlia, mainly
because of its smooth-talking and
thinking owner, Howard da Sylva.
Miss Dowling, in the words of one
of Mr. Chandler's characters, is
"croaked" almost immediately,
| which necessitates the abduction
| of her slayer from among a rather
i unsavory group of individuals. <
VIGOROUS ENTERTAINMENT
"The Blue Dahlia" is good vigor-
I ous entertainment with plenty of
j tough talk provided by Mr. Ladd,
j Veronica Lake, Bill Bendix, and a
| nosey house detective ("house-
I peeper" 1 think is Mr. Chandler's
1 term) named Will Wright. Chan
j dler gives an almost incredible por
trayal of his clientele, most of
I whom experience everything from
I heartbreak to hangover. I think
! that you'll agree with me in hearty
i approval of "The Blue Dahlia."
i OUTLAW UNWRAPPED
j The United Artists, Esquire, and
