# Indians Seek To Halt Cal
## 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
Stanford's al.st collision with Cal,
| tnd first of its kind in three yer.rs,
j pomes of Saturday afternoon when
I the Indian and Bear track squads j
j tangle ?t Berkeley's Edwards Field j
in the Big Meet.
On the season's rccords between |
the two squads, the Bear is the
slight favorite to cop its 23rd vie- |
tory of the series, leaving it still |
behind the Indians who have taken I
20 of the meels. In 1896 and 1922,
j honors were evenly split.
The Indians, on the other hand,
will he out to halt Ca'"s Big
Meet streak at three victories, the
Farm's last Rig Meet triumph,
coming in 1940, when the locals
were under the tutelage of Bill
Ellington.
Incidentally, the Indians have,
taken the contest by its largest and
smallest margins.
In If3l, when Stanford was in
the midst of its 11-meet winning j
streak, the Bear was humbled by
101 2/3 to 29 1/3; and in 1913 the
Tribe eked out a 01 1/5 to 00 4/5
| verdict.
The rccords established in the
Big Meet in past years arc among
the finest to he found in the marks
set up in any series of dual meets
between two schools, but aside
from the one of closeness it is
doubtful whether any new marks
will be set this year.
The only possible and concciv- j
able exception is the high jump, j
where Cal's Bob Canning's 1938 leap
of fi ft. 0 in. might be beaten by
, cither or both of two men.
Chuck Hanger of Cal, "who has
i not been beaten this season" as
I the publicity blurbs state (and he
hasn't, either), went over the bar
at 112Â» ft. 5 "h in. at the Coliseum
Relays at L.A. last week, which
makes him the leading contender
in that event.
Stanford's Ed Luce, however, is
not much farther behind, having j
done 0 ft. 5Vz in. in 1944 when |
jumping for the Olympic Club.
Luce has not yet come too close to
that mark this season, having
cleared 0 ft. 4 in. at the start of
the season at San Diego State's i
Aztec Relays, and but 0 ft. 3 in.
against U.C.L.A. for his best mark |
since.
Tickets for the meet will not
be available here on the campus,
but may he purchased at Edwards
I Field for 50 rents. Tic.kct sale
starts at 1 p.m.. and the first track
event is slated for 1:15.
