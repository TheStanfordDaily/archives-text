# Intrepid Reporters Pull Chappie 'Sneak Preview'
## 
### 
Amid hysterical gales of laughter
two intrepid Daily reporters gave
the rest of the stafT a brief preview
of the sensationally colossal special
May i.Ajue of the Stanford Chapar
ral, world's greatest college humor
magazine. Sneaking into the Press,
which is being guarded by heavily
armed men of the elite Chappie
corps, the two managed to obtain a
quick view of part of the coming
issue.
Overcome by the magnitude of
the magazine, the fearless two
just barely managed to get back
to the Daily shack before they
collapsed. As they were being re
vived by artificial respiration, one
of them was beard to whisper,
"My God, it's out of this world.
Why, the 'Yellow Press' section
alone is worth the price of ad
mission— it's positively fantastic!

Such satire—such humor—and the
art work is absolutely professional
if not better."
At this point the poor lad became
unconscious again. It is hoped that
he will come to before next Mon
day when the world-shattering is
sue will go on sale.
In checking with the Chappie of
fice, it was learned that there is no
truth to the rumor that the 52-page,
3-in-l issue will be sold for three
times the regular price. It will pos
itively be on sale at a bargain price
of 35 cents.
