# Meet With Cal Rated Tossup
## 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
Big Meet—the 51st annual between Stanford and California
comes off tomorrow afternoon at Berkeley's Edwards Field when
the two almost equal track squads square off at 1:45.
A slightly underdog Indian combine goes gunning for its 27th
victory and first since 1940. California is favored, which is merely

(ho bookmakers' arbitrary prc-meeH
decision that has no bearing on the I
actual outcome.
TRIBE MAY WIN
With a little luek, the Tribe can I
cap an otherwise undistinguished j
f-eason, for a victory over Brutus
Hamilton's Bears means as much to ,
the Farm as any other kudo to be
picked up on the cinderpath.
On the season's records of the two ;
teams, Cal rates an edge; but tho j
Big Meet has always been a touch
one to dope what with guys running |
faster and throwing farther and
jumping higher than they ever did
before. Also, sometimes they don't
do as expected which further com- j

plicalcs things.
Pessin.istic pre-meet dope sheets
have the Farm pegged at about 55
points, give or take a couple, while
the more optimistic of partisans say
lite Indians can tally at least 72.
However, from here it looks like
it'll take the relay to decide who
beats who, and the margin should
be no more than two or three points
at the very most. For the sake of
argument, we'll say Stanford by C 6
to 65.
The Indian chances depend upon
a handful of key men and just how
much more they can give than is
reasonable to ask. And several oth
er men will have to do better than
ihcy have this season if the Farm is
to win.
Two of the key men are George
Grimes and Frank Ganahl, Coach


AL WILKINS, Stanford middle
distance man, will compete in the
Big Meet tomorrow at Berkeley.
