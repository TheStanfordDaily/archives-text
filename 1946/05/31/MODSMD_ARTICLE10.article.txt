# Masque Ball Op en To All: Jn Costume
## 
### 
"The Masque," to be given by En
cina tomorrow night at 9 in the
Women's Gym, has been opened to
the entire campus according to Bob
Christiansen, dance chairman.
Because of the novelty of the af
fair and the unusual entertainment
to be offered, he feels it would be
worth while to invite any and all
who wish to attend. Bids will not
now be necessary for admission.
Traditionally a formal ball, the
dance this year will be strictly "en
costume." Duplication of costumes
will probably be inevitable, says
Christiansen, but "students should
n't worry about that." Black masks
will be distributed at the door for
any one who has been unable t/j
obtain them in town.
Bert Whiting's 12-piece orches
tra, complete with vocalist, will be
on hand, and th" professional dance
team of Lolita & Ardo will be the
special entertaaimnent feature dur
ing the intermission. There also
will be prizes offered for the two
couples in the best costumes.
