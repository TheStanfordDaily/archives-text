# Tresidderâ€” 'No Change In Athletics'
## 
### 
No change has been made in
Stanford's long-standing policy to
ward admission of athletes and the
financing of the University's ath
letic program, Dr. Donald B. Tres
idder stated yesterday.
Decisions concerning the basis on
which Stanford was to re-enter in
tercollegiate competition this year
and particularly next fall wore
made, lie said, by a student group
in which Bob Kennedy and Ed
Luce were included, an advisory
committee of the alumni under
Judge Homer Spence, and the Ad
visory Board of the Faculty.
NO FOOTBALL IN '45
These groups, consulted prior even j
to V-J Day, were in unanimous |
agreement that intercollegiate foot
ball could not be resumed in the j
autumn of 1945.
But they made the decision reaf- |
firming Stanford's policy of no ex- :
ceptions for athletes, taking into
consideration the following facts: j
Stanford's athletes have always met ,
the minimum requirements, and a ;
considerable number of its outstand
ing athletes have been Phi Beta j
Kappa members.
As to the rumored cut in the j
athletic budget, Dr. Tresidder
pointed to the figures: the athletic !
program received 80 per cent more !
money for 1946-47 than for 1943-
46, and approximately 20 per cent !
more than for the last year of in- !
tercollegiate competition.
Stanford students should he j
aware, continued Dr. Tresidder.
that having intcrupted intercolle
giate competition, there is no way
to reopen with the likelihood of
the conspicuous winnings we
would have had by continuing
competition.
TRAVEL RESTRICTED
Stanford left intercollegiate com
petition at the outbreak of the war
for two "easons:
The University was attempting to
co-operate with the Army's an- i
nounced policy that travel be re
stricted to business essential to the
war effort. University officials were
unable to conclude that trips to !
Portland, even Los Angeles were
in compliance with the Army's re
quest. No criticism for colleges that
arrived at other conclusions was
felt by Stanford.
Also. Stanford was designated as
an Army training school. Unlike
the Navy, no Army trainees were i
allowed by military authorities to |
participate in intercollegiate ath- J
letic programs. "So where," Dr.
Tresidder asked, "were the athcltcs I
for our teams to come from?"


A NEW STUDENT UNION will he one of the first projects to he
considered autumn quarter, agree Martin Anderson and Millie Edwards,
newly elected A.S.S.U. President and Vice-President.
"We will present tentative plans for a union within the first few
weeks of the quarter," said Anderson.
"We hope to increase unison among students through more all
cainpus affairs of all types," said Miss Edwards.

NO FOOTBALL IN '45
These groups, consulted prior even j
to V-J Day, were in unanimous |
agreement that intercollegiate foot
ball could not be resumed in the j
autumn of 1945.
But they made the decision reaf- |
firming Stanford's policy of no ex- :
ceptions for athletes, taking into
consideration the following facts: j
Stanford's athletes have always met ,
the minimum requirements, and a ;
considerable number of its outstand
ing athletes have been Phi Beta j
Kappa members.
As to the rumored cut in the j
athletic budget, Dr. Tresidder
pointed to the figures: the athletic !
program received 80 per cent more !
money for 1946-47 than for 1943-
46, and approximately 20 per cent !
more than for the last year of in- !
tercollegiate competition.
Stanford students should he j
aware, continued Dr. Tresidder.
that having intcrupted intercolle
giate competition, there is no way
to reopen with the likelihood of
the conspicuous winnings we
would have had by continuing
competition.
TRAVEL RESTRICTED
Stanford left intercollegiate com
petition at the outbreak of the war
for two "easons:
The University was attempting to
co-operate with the Army's an- i
nounced policy that travel be re
stricted to business essential to the
war effort. University officials were
unable to conclude that trips to !
Portland, even Los Angeles were
in compliance with the Army's re
quest. No criticism for colleges that
arrived at other conclusions was
felt by Stanford.
Also. Stanford was designated as
an Army training school. Unlike
the Navy, no Army trainees were i
allowed by military authorities to |
participate in intercollegiate ath- J
letic programs. "So where," Dr.
Tresidder asked, "were the athcltcs I
for our teams to come from?"


A NEW STUDENT UNION will he one of the first projects to he
considered autumn quarter, agree Martin Anderson and Millie Edwards,
newly elected A.S.S.U. President and Vice-President.
"We will present tentative plans for a union within the first few
weeks of the quarter," said Anderson.
"We hope to increase unison among students through more all
cainpus affairs of all types," said Miss Edwards.
No change has been made in
Stanford's long-standing policy to
ward admission of athletes and the
financing of the University's ath
letic program, Dr. Donald B. Tres
idder stated yesterday.
Decisions concerning the basis on
which Stanford was to re-enter in
tercollegiate competition this year
and particularly next fall wore
made, lie said, by a student group
in which Bob Kennedy and Ed
Luce were included, an advisory
committee of the alumni under
Judge Homer Spence, and the Ad
visory Board of the Faculty.
