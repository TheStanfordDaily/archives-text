# Dear Beth and Mellon:
## 
### 
Comes the end of Daily Volume 109, and
I'm very proud of both of you . . . and very
glad that The Daily will be in your hands next
fall, for I know it means that the paper will
be backed up by mature thinking, and that
the staff will be backed up by two under
standing and perceptive partners.
Watching the trends on the campus this
year, some of us have grown apprehensive
over the future. We've seen many things we
liked, but as many that made us wonder, and
perhaps grow a little too cynical. I'd like to
talk about it for a minute, so you can firmly
set down your cup of coffee on the page, if
you like, or bear with me.
Throughout the year Stanford has reflected
the discontent and the unsettled backwash
of the war that's been prevalent throughout
the nation. We've all seen it, and I think
we'll admit that we've all felt it in one way or
another. Where it has been directly aimed
at doing away with a particular, clearly-de
fined evil, it has had good results; but where
it has been aimless, it has resulted in a can
cerous growth of bitterness and rumor. It
will be your job—and at times you'll weep
for Solomon —to sort out one criticism from
another, so that you may build constructive
policies from those that are well-founded.
At the moment we seem to be rounding
full-circle in an effort to approach campus
problems in a spirit of confidence and cooper
ation. 1 hope that it's a real spirit, based on
the discovery that the University or any other
organization cannot progress without it, rath

er a temporary and fleeting reaction. There
will always be critics to keep aiming higher
than the status quo; to coordinate their efforts
will be The Daily's responsibility as ever.
And you will have the constant task of help
ing the campus to find its perspective in the
world today. Whatever you can do to give
breadth to student thought, to balance our
preoccupation with ourselves and our own
comfortable orbits, will be of value both now
and in the years after we have left Stanford.
Your staff next year is one of the finest
that we've known since we've been on The
Daily ... it is made up of persons who have
proven in a difficult year that in terms of
hard work, and consideration for their fellow
workers, they cannot be equaled. To all of
you, my very best wishes for Volume 110,
and always. I'd like to say goodbye to Vol
ume 109 with a paragraph by St. Bxupery
that I'm thinking of now:
"What constitutes the dignity of a craft is
that it creates a fellowship, that it binds men
together and fashions for them a common
language. For there is but one veritable prob
lem . . . the problem of human relations.
"We forget that there is no hope of joy ex
cept in human relations. If I summon up those
memories that have left me with an enduring
savor, if I draw up the balance sheet of the
hours in my life that have truly counted, sure
ly I find only those that no wealth could pro
cure me."
And thank you
Skid.
