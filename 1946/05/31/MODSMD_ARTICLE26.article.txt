"Then said a rich man, Speak to us of Giving.
And he answered:
You give but little when you give of your pos
sessions.
It is when you give of yourself that you truly
give.
For what are your possessions hut things you
keep and guard for fear you may need them to
morrow?
And tomoirow, what shall tomorrow bring to the
overprudent dog burying bones in the trackless
sand as he follows the pilgrims to the holy city?
And what is fear of need but need itself?
Is not dread of thirst when your well is full, the
thirst that is unquenchable?
There are those who give little of the much which
I hey have—and they give it for recognition and
1 hr ir hidden desire makes their gifts unwholesome.
And there are those who have little to give and
give it all.
These are the believers in life and the bounty of
life, and their cofi'er is never empty.
There are those who give with joy and that joy is
their reward.
And there are those who Rive with pain and that

pain is their baptism.
And there are those who give and know not pain
in giving nor do they seek joy, nor give with mind
fulness ol' virtue:
They give as in yonder valley the myrtle breathes
its fragrance into space.
Through the hands of such as these God speaks,
and from behind their eyes. He smiles upon the
earth.
It is well to give when asked, but it is better to
give unasked, through understanding;
And to the open-handed the search for one who
shall receive is joy greater than giving.
And is there aught you would behold?
All you have shall someday be given;
Therefore give now, that the season of giving
shall be yours and not your inheritors'.
You often say, "I would give, but only to the de
serving."
The trees in your orchard say not so, nor the
flocks in your pasture.
They give that they mal live for to withhold is
to perish.
Surely he who is worthy to receive his days and
his nights, is worthy of all else from you.
And he who has deserved to drink from the ocean
of life deserves to fill his cup from your little
stream.
And what desert greater shall there be than that
which lies in the courage and the confidence, nay
the charity, of receiving?"

They give that they mal live for to withhold is
to perish.
Surely he who is worthy to receive his days and
his nights, is worthy of all else from you.
And he who has deserved to drink from the ocean
of life deserves to fill his cup from your little
stream.
And what desert greater shall there be than that
which lies in the courage and the confidence, nay
the charity, of receiving?"

Prophet," by Kahil Gibran, because it expresses
more completely than anything we have read the
spirit which will help us to win the peace of the
world.)
"Then said a rich man, Speak to us of Giving.
And he answered:
You give but little when you give of your pos
sessions.
It is when you give of yourself that you truly
give.
For what are your possessions hut things you
keep and guard for fear you may need them to
morrow?
And tomoirow, what shall tomorrow bring to the
overprudent dog burying bones in the trackless
sand as he follows the pilgrims to the holy city?
And what is fear of need but need itself?
Is not dread of thirst when your well is full, the
thirst that is unquenchable?
There are those who give little of the much which
I hey have—and they give it for recognition and
1 hr ir hidden desire makes their gifts unwholesome.
And there are those who have little to give and
give it all.
These are the believers in life and the bounty of
life, and their cofi'er is never empty.
There are those who give with joy and that joy is
their reward.
And there are those who Rive with pain and that

pain is their baptism.
And there are those who give and know not pain
in giving nor do they seek joy, nor give with mind
fulness ol' virtue:
They give as in yonder valley the myrtle breathes
its fragrance into space.
Through the hands of such as these God speaks,
and from behind their eyes. He smiles upon the
earth.
It is well to give when asked, but it is better to
give unasked, through understanding;
And to the open-handed the search for one who
shall receive is joy greater than giving.
And is there aught you would behold?
All you have shall someday be given;
Therefore give now, that the season of giving
shall be yours and not your inheritors'.
You often say, "I would give, but only to the de
serving."
The trees in your orchard say not so, nor the
flocks in your pasture.
They give that they mal live for to withhold is
to perish.
Surely he who is worthy to receive his days and
his nights, is worthy of all else from you.
And he who has deserved to drink from the ocean
of life deserves to fill his cup from your little
