# Summer E lections—Haphazard?

### 
The selection of a student body president
for the summer quarter is an important proc
ess of our student government, especially in
1946 when registration for the summer ses
sion will equal that of most prewar fall quar
ters.
At Wednesday night's session of executive
committee this selection was made in a hap
hazard manner. No survey had been made
of the people available for the job. Excom
members seemingly had failed to give any
thought to the matter prior to the meeting,
although President Kennedy had informed
them the matter would be on the agenda.
No attempt had been made to determine
the approximate number of men or women on
campus summer quarter or what their needs
would be.
Fortunately for Stanford a good selection

was made in this instance. But in the future
a more thorough inquiry into students avail
able should be made. The summer quarter
presidency should not necessarily be a con
solation prize for the runner-up in the regular
student body election. If this time the choice
proved to be a happy one, it is no indication
that in the future the student body will not be
stung.
Either candidates for summer offices should
run on a slate in the regular student elections,
or Excorn should appoint a nominating com
mittee to examine candidates and present a
list for Excom consideration.
Next week Excom will meet to appoint
summer quarter members to the committee
itself. Some serious thought is in order on the
part of the retiring members of the commit
tee who will make the selections. — Bill
