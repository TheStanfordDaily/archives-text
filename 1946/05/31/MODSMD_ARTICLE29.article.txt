ily law have been made by Chester
G. Vernier, retiring professor of
law.
His six-volume "American Fam

over 30,000 words on marriage, di
vorce, and separation, husband and
wife, parent and child, and incom
petents and dependents.
In describing the immense task,
Dr. Vernier said, "It involved look
ing up hundreds of thousands of
statutes on the various subjects. In
the file in my office I now have
about 20,000 cards on statutes deal
ing with family relations."

ADDITIONAL FIELDS
i Dr. Vernier has also made con
, tributions in three other fields of
i law, the penal code, the law of
j sales, and negotiable instruments.
As he stated, "Besides teaching and
doing research I have endeavored
to improve law in special fields."
His success is proved by the adop
, tion of some improvements in the
! statutory law of the California penal
code which he advocated to the
California Crime Commission in
i 1927. Under his suggestion, the three
[ crimes, larceny, embezzlement, and
j false pretenses, v/ere combined into
| one crime, theft. The state has also
j followed his plan in making it a
crime to solicit another to commit
a crime. At present Dr. Vernier is
doing work on the problem of in
sanity as grounds for divorce.

law.
His six-volume "American Fam
ily Laws," published from 1931 to
I£3B by the Stanford University
Press, is the culmination or ten and
one-half years of research. With
the aid of research assistants and 25
law students, Dr. Vernier prepared
over 30,000 words on marriage, di
vorce, and separation, husband and
wife, parent and child, and incom
petents and dependents.
In describing the immense task,
Dr. Vernier said, "It involved look
ing up hundreds of thousands of
statutes on the various subjects. In
the file in my office I now have
about 20,000 cards on statutes deal
ing with family relations."

ADDITIONAL FIELDS
i Dr. Vernier has also made con
, tributions in three other fields of
i law, the penal code, the law of
j sales, and negotiable instruments.
As he stated, "Besides teaching and
doing research I have endeavored
to improve law in special fields."
His success is proved by the adop
, tion of some improvements in the
! statutory law of the California penal
code which he advocated to the
California Crime Commission in
i 1927. Under his suggestion, the three
[ crimes, larceny, embezzlement, and
j false pretenses, v/ere combined into
| one crime, theft. The state has also
j followed his plan in making it a
crime to solicit another to commit
a crime. At present Dr. Vernier is
doing work on the problem of in
sanity as grounds for divorce.
