# Stettinius May Quit UJN. Post
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 30 (UP).—|
Reports from usually well-informed J
sources said tonight that Edward R. |
Stettinius, Jr., has tendered to Pres- |
ident Truman his resignation as i
American representative on the j
United Nations Security Council in j
protest against what he considers '
the "minor" Council role assigned j
to him by the U.S. State Depart- ;
ment.
Stettinius could not be reached
immediately at his Virginia hom£ i
for comment and the White House j
gave a short "no comment" to all
questions on the subject.
But the white-haired ex-Secre- :
tary of State was said to have of- j
fered his resignation presumably to
President Truman within the past I
week or 10 days. The President, ac- |
cording to one account, took the
request under advisement.
Persons close to Stettinius said he I
came close to a break with Secre
tary of Stat'? James F. Byrns dur- j
ing the recent U.N. Security Coun- !
oil debate on the Soviet-Iranian
dispute.

HAPPY DEAD WEEK . . .

force crossed into Siam on May 24
while pursuing a band of raiders,
killing several but spending only
about three hours on Siamese soil.
The Frcnch incursions, the com
munique said, were made necessary
by the "manifest inability of local
Siamese authorities to control the
activity of armed bands of Laotian
and Annamite rebels."
Dispatches from Bangkok last
weekend charged that French troops
supported by planes and artillery
invaded Siam and looted the Mek
hong River village of Naung Kai
during a three-day operation start
ing May 24.
(A communique issued by the
Siamese legation in London said to
day that hundreds of Frcnch troops
still remain on Siamese soil and
that British and American observers
can testify to French aggression.
(A Bangkok, Siam, dispatch today
said that American and Siamese
observers who flew to the trouble
area in the vicinity of Vientiane, 325
miles northeast of Bangkok, re
turned to the Siamese capital today
to make their reports. One observ
er said the evidence confirmed the
French attack.)
