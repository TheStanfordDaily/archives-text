# Dear Mr. Kennedy (that clear-thinking real Stanford man who makes statements without thinking and then retracts them): As a returned Stanford G.I. I was interested in your plaintive epistle recounting your ill-treatment at the hands of The Daily. Probably your statement that The Daily is run by a small group of Stanford women (please Mr. Kennedy) is undoubtedly true. But this is not a clique in the usual sense because it comes from row, hall, and offcampus. Rather it is a clique of brains and hard work arriving finally at position of responsibility well-deserved. A clique unmentioned by you is yours which controls many studentbody offices. It appears that your group is seeking to control The Daily, mainly by intimidation. Miss Bannick indicated that you nor any other group can suppress the news. In this democracy it would be more to your credit if by virtue of brains and hard work your group arrived at a position to deserve control. Or can't they cut it? In conclusion, I suspect the average Stanfordite enjoys The Daily more than any other student-run activity on the campus. The women have done a swell job and I think were you to ask any person on the campus or Mr. Paul Smith you'd get the same reply. A Student
