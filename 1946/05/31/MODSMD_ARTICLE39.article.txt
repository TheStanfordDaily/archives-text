Some sources would have you believe that this column is based on
nothing more than "supposition, hearsay, and talk with underlings." This
columnist would like to give his readers credit for having an intelligence
somewhat above that which his accusex's would imply.
We have never up" or "buttered-up" to anyone when present
ing an issue.
Wc welcome any proof that could show that "supposition, hearsay,
and talks with underlings" have been the basis for this column's discus
sions.
To make the claim that this is so, can be done with no effort. But to
make the claim on say the specific issue of "athletics" and to try to back
it up with a grand "smoothing over" is proof of nothing. Proof of nothing
except, perhaps our original contention: The issue is being covered up by
a defense based on "smoothing over."
The fact remains that the issue, when first presented, was immediately
snapped up by the student body. Our opposition must either contend that
the students do not have the intelligence to realize what goes on around
'hem or that the few words of this column can so influence student's
thought that an issue that is taking place right before them, can be incor
rectly written about and still believed.
As we have said earlier, our opposition, which on occasion referred to
one of your class officers as "rabble," can not "butter-over" the issue,
regardless of how stupid they may think that the "rabble" are.
If the present ASSU administration cannot see the pictures as it clearly
exists, then the only inference possible is that they, and not the student
body are the ones who do not realize what goes on around them.

Slaims of misquotation and unfair reporting when backed up by such
arguments as (1) Well, I said it but I took it back, or (2) Well, I said it
but I asked to have it suppressed, are likewise impossible to accept.

"Cooperation" has been asked for. Cooperation will be given. But
"cooperation" when it means smoothing over mistakes, gladhanding the
ASSU, or outright suppression of news will not be given.
The story, as it exists in fact, and not in the form of "cooperation" is
what we insist upon presenting.
