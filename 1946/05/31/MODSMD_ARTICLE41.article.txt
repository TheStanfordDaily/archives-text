### LARRY FRANKLEY GEORGE ECKSTEIN 
The music year draws to a close J
with little or no change in the I
bands, combos, and vocalists who
led the way during the past nine
months.
BIG BANDS
Woody Herman is stiil the band
of the hour although Columbia is
not releasing the high caliber of
Herd recordings that were being
issued at the first of the year. De
spite rumors, Woody has managed
j to retain most of his key instru
mentalists and from the looks of
things now, the band will continue
to remain quite stable with Jackson, !
Harris, Phillips, Burns, and Norvo
carrying most of the load.
Little change has been noted in
Ellingtonia, and Duke still looms as
one of the top figures in the jazz
world.
Count Basie, as usual, has also
continued producing good, steady
i music with very little sensational -
j ism. Buck Clayton and Jo Jones are
; back with Illinois Jacquet and Em
j mett Berry added, which means
j more wonderful waxings from the
j Count.
1 Stan Kenton, picked by many as
the "band of the year," has been
well and fully recorded by Capitol
and will continue to live up to his
already established reputation.
Boyd Raeburn, wun his George
| "Anything to Be Different" Handy
j arrangements, has been drawing all
' the raves from the leading music
< magazines throughout the nation.
| COMBOS, CROONERS, CHICKS
The King Cole Trio is still tops!
! Oscar Moore is not playing up to
par, and the Trio has grown more
commercial, but still Nat and the
boys are leading the field.
Of course, there art Art Tatum,
Eddie Condon, Coleman Hawkins,
Muggsy Spanier, Lester Young, J.
I C. Higginbotham, George Brunies,
land the other always - great jazz
I immortals who consistently produce
I good music—and then there is the
rediscovery of Bunk Johnson and
Kid Ory.
New stars such as Red Callender,
Les Paul, Andre Previn, Arv Gar
rison, Erroll Gainer, Charlie Par
ker, and Bill D'Arango have come 1
on to the swing scene.
Peggy Lee is here to stay—Fran- i
ces Wayne, who came up in a much |
more sensational fashion, is on her i
way—down the ladder of success. '
The other great vocalists—Mildred ;
Bailey, Billie Holliday, Anita O'Day, j
and Ella Fitzgerald—are still mo
nopolizing the better larynxes in the '
female division, while Nat Cole, '
Louis Armstrong, Joe Turner, A 1
Hibbler, and Frank Sinatra are still
representing the masculine side of j
the ledger.
FINAL BAR
Well, this is the last measure and
we want to offer our apologies to
all the feet which we stepped on
during the year—to Sammy Kaye,
Guy ("I Love My Family") Lom
bardo, Vaughan Monroe, and sweet
but sickening Hildegardc! We will
be back in the fall, so until Bunk
Johnson has to get a new pair of
teeth—see you on Quad.

officially thanked Stanford women
recently for necessities, comforts,
ahd luxuries sent to the Philip
pines through the local "Y" group
during December.
"One ol our staff who came down
with tuberculosis as a result of mal
nutrition and is just in the conva
lescing stage now helps me with the
unwrapping, sorting, and listing of
the things that come," she wrote in
a personal letter. Pins, thread, nee
dles, bobby pins, lipsticks, cotton
dresses, stockings, and colorful cos
tume jewelry were some of the
items listed by Miss Gutherie in
packages from the Stanford Y.W.-
C.A.
STOCKINGS WITII PURPOSE
"Not many in Manila wear stock
ings these days," she wrote, "but
how glad I was that one of you had
sent several pairs. How'l wish you
could have seen the delight when I
gave a woman two pairs to cover a
terribly scarred leg. She was from
Baguio. Her house was burned and
she had to run through the flames
to escape. Face, arm, and leg will
always be reminders of the ordeal
she went through, but the stockings
will help so much."
i
"Over. 500 people have been
helped through the Philippine Y.W.-
C.A. group," she told Stanford wom
en, later, adding, "Nine-tenths of
the people you see in the street are
wearing 'stateside' clothes. UNRRA
has sent many bales of the clothing
you have collected — hundreds of
bales. Do you know how much has
come? One garment for one per
son out of every ten. Yet among the
other nine there are many who arc
just as needy."
POST IN RUINS
Miss Gutherie returned to her
Y.W.C.A. post in Manila to find the
"Y" building in ruins. During Japa
nese occupation of Manila she head
ed English women's forces in India,
holding the honorary title of "Ma
jor."
In thanking Stanford women for
contributions, the Philippine Y.W.-
C.A. head stressed that rehabilita
tion will take months and years.
She urged a continual flow of cotton
dresses, luxury items to brighten
the drabness of Manila, and all pos
sible necessities be sent to the needy
of the Philippines by those more
fortunate in the United States.
