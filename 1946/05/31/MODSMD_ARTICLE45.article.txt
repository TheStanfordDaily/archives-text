# Farm Appointment Service Helps Seniors Find Jobs
## 
### 
Acting as a reservoir for hopeful
employees and employers, the Stan
ford Appointment Service is anx
iously awaiting word from seniors
graduating this June concerning
their future employment wishes.
Dr. Robert Bush, director of the
service, outlines the work of his
office by saying the service is main
tained to assist students and alumni
in finding suitable employment and
to help employers in securing qual
ified university-trained persons.
APPLY BEFORE GRADUATION
He emphasizes that it is much
easier for prospective employees to
obtain adequate recommendations if
Appointment Service immediately
around graduation time. Otherwise,
he said, professors and students are
likely to forget about each other,
and the letters required are not as
personal.
When a student registers at the
employment office he gives his aca
demic record, information about

I what kind of a job he wants, and
i some references. The replies to
these references are kept in a con
fidential file until an employer evi
dences a wish for someone who fits
one of the records on file, and the
two are matched.
Many Stanford alumni, according
to Dr. Bush, come back two or
; three years after graduation and
request job information and aid.
