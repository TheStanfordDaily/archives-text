This "rides to Paly" tradition 11111
are concerned, if our experiment ye
Picking what we thought was
picked up (literally, that is), we stati
Bookstore corner at 4 p.m. Wanting
we cleaned our saddles, combed our
hair, decked ourselves out in our
most fetching summer cotton, and
sat down to await results.
In 15 minutes we had been passed
by a '41 Ford coupe (three passen
gersâ€”we couldn't really blame
them); a '46 Dodge, driver only; two
Model A's; a '38 Chevvie one-and
a-half-ton pickup truck carrying six
blond youths wearing Stanford
jackets; the Paly bus; and approxi
mately 10 other automobiles of all
sizes and makes, carrying Stanford
students of all sizes and makes.
Results at last! A blue coupe
pulled up to the curb, the driver
opened the door, leaned out and
wheezed, "Want a ride, dearie?"
She was pushing 70, but e'est la vie.
Pollers can't be choosers.
Between 4:15 and 6:30 we made
five round trips into Paly and back
again. Our drivers, aside from the
gentle, graying lady, included: one
professor, one earful of tourists, the
Atomic Package Delivery Co. (we
rode in the food container; we are
a midget), one Bookstore clerk, one
garage pickup man, one off-campus j
student (graduate law), one Red i
Cross station wagon, two soldiers in j
jeep, and one taxi driver who gave |
us a free ride home at 6:30.
Among other topics of discussion i
we debated the relative merits of j
price control vs. price lifting, prewar
Stanford, weather, the beauty of the
Farm, '"this awful heat," Stanford
architecture, the "wild young peo
ple" of today, and grade averages.
We also got three offers for a
drink.
But we probably would have got
ten much better results if we'd stood
on the corner turning off to Ros
sotti's. Would have had a much
better sample.
