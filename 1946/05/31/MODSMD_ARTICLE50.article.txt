This is -30-. The sign-off and the
end. Volume 109 is dead and vol
ume 110 lies in the future. What
the future may bring, nobody knows
but the Daily will feel itself a suc
cess if the Daily can help mold the
future of the University.
Now, the war over almost a year,
we are torn apart by arguments and
quarrels. Some of the alleged gripes
are legitimate; some are not. It's
pretty hard to tell which ones are
the real thing because Stanford is
notoriously close-mouthed on im
portant issues.
A problem that the University is
torn wide open over is that of ath
letics. President Kennedy seems to
think that everything will take care
of itself and we should sit down and
wait for the future. I'm against this:
with the help of the students we can
and should mold the future and
have something to say about the
policies of our school.
Another hot subject around cam
pus is the problem of closer cooper
ation. between the students and fac
ulty. The story of the Stanford fam
ily seems to have exploded. Where
are the after-dinner coffees with
faculty and students? Where are the
Sunday outings at Santa Cruz with
a group of professors and students?
We're in direct danger of losing any
cooperation between the facultv and
students. LET'S GET TOGETHER
AND TALK OVER THE ISSUES.
After four years of war. we've had
enough fighting. Why fight at home
now?
Where is the better America we
were looking for in the dark days
of 1!)41 and 1942? Have we lost
the better America? Labor is
striking and management is stand
ing fast. Where is the United
States headed? Apparently right

to internal strife and disorder.
Why can't we solve our differ
ences peacefully? Aren't we civ
ilized human beings?
If we can't even solve our prob
lems peacefully at Stanford, what
hope is there for solving the na
tion's problems? We're grown men
and women—let's act like them.
If we make it that way, Stanford's
heading for a Golden Era. WE CAN
BE TOPS IF WE PULL TOGETH
ER. Cooperation is the key-word.
Let's quit arguing and do something
about the problems before us.

treated to a free coke, was almost
run over by a long green Cadillac,
and wound up downtown at H:l5
p.m.—without a ride—thereby miss
ing dinner on the campus.
We took up the vigil at the ''Y"
on Palm Drive and were rewarded
in about five minutes by a ride in a
'31 vintage Ford.
Once in Paly, we got out across
from Wilson's stood just off the
curb to see how the luck was for a
return trip.
Three coupes went by, driven
by persons who looked like stu
dents but maybe we didn't. Any
way, no deal. A brick-red Buick
slowed down at the bus stop across
the street and the male driver looked
for something on the corner. It (or
she) wasn't there and he picked us
up instead for ride No. 2.
Our next round-trip was accom
plished in a matter of seven minutes,
and we were slightly red-faced to
have the same gal deliver us from
the gutter both going into Paly and
returning.
We got off at the "Y" and started
it all over again. No one came by
for 18 minutes.
Well, to make a long story as long
as possible, we finally nabbed an
other ride into town, this time sit
ting beside a bloncie who ought to
set a screen test.

If we can't even solve our prob

hope is there for solving the na

Let's quit arguing and do something
about the problems before us.

treated to a free coke, was almost
run over by a long green Cadillac,
and wound up downtown at H:l5
p.m.—without a ride—thereby miss
ing dinner on the campus.
We took up the vigil at the ''Y"
on Palm Drive and were rewarded
in about five minutes by a ride in a
'31 vintage Ford.
Once in Paly, we got out across
from Wilson's stood just off the
curb to see how the luck was for a
return trip.
Three coupes went by, driven
by persons who looked like stu
dents but maybe we didn't. Any
way, no deal. A brick-red Buick
slowed down at the bus stop across
the street and the male driver looked
for something on the corner. It (or
she) wasn't there and he picked us
up instead for ride No. 2.
Our next round-trip was accom
plished in a matter of seven minutes,
and we were slightly red-faced to
have the same gal deliver us from
the gutter both going into Paly and
returning.
We got off at the "Y" and started
it all over again. No one came by
for 18 minutes.
Well, to make a long story as long
as possible, we finally nabbed an
other ride into town, this time sit
ting beside a bloncie who ought to
set a screen test.


WE LOSE MORE REPORTERS THIS WAY . . .
This is -30-. The sign-off and the
end. Volume 109 is dead and vol

the future may bring, nobody knows
but the Daily will feel itself a suc
cess if the Daily can help mold the
future of the University.
Now, the war over almost a year,
we are torn apart by arguments and
quarrels. Some of the alleged gripes
are legitimate; some are not. It's
pretty hard to tell which ones are
the real thing because Stanford is
notoriously close-mouthed on im
portant issues.
A problem that the University is
torn wide open over is that of ath
letics. President Kennedy seems to
think that everything will take care
of itself and we should sit down and
wait for the future. I'm against this:
with the help of the students we can
and should mold the future and
have something to say about the
policies of our school.
Another hot subject around cam
pus is the problem of closer cooper
ation. between the students and fac
ulty. The story of the Stanford fam
ily seems to have exploded. Where
are the after-dinner coffees with
faculty and students? Where are the
Sunday outings at Santa Cruz with
a group of professors and students?
We're in direct danger of losing any
cooperation between the facultv and
students. LET'S GET TOGETHER
AND TALK OVER THE ISSUES.
After four years of war. we've had
enough fighting. Why fight at home
now?
Where is the better America we
were looking for in the dark days
of 1!)41 and 1942? Have we lost
the better America? Labor is
striking and management is stand
ing fast. Where is the United
States headed? Apparently right

to internal strife and disorder.
