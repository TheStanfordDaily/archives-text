# Golf Team Completes Season with Match
## 
### 
The Stanford golfers, who last
week won the Southern Division
championship, play their last
scheduled matches today in Berk
eley against California. Win or
lose, the Indians are still South
ern Division champs hy virtue of
their victory over all conference ,
opponents on May 23.
The Bears, who were second in
the Southern Division team cham
pionships with a 648 against the
low score hy Stanford of (iO.'J, have
been the Cards' toughest competi
tion to date.
Paced by Herb Dunham, Cal de
feated both USC and UCLA and
was unbeaten until they ran into 1
the Indians last week in the cham
pionships. In the individuals, the
Cal ace defeated all University i
champion Frank McCann only to be

eliminated by number two man Tom
J Lumbie who is now the Southern
I Division individual champion. To
day McCann will again face Dun
ham, and the match should prove
one of the best of the season.
Southern Division champ Tom
Lambie will be playing in the num
i ber two spot for the Farm. Lambie
I has been undefeated to date and
will probably face Hy Henning who
| was sixth in the team play last
Thursday.
The rest of the F 'arm team will
J be the same men who carried the
; Indians to the championship: Jack
; Shuler, a consistent winner for the
Farm, Bob Cardinal, who reached
i the finals Saturday with Lambie,
! Bob Rosburg, who has been one of
j Stanford's hottest golfers when
playing, and Gordon Dotzour, a
| good golfer who holds down the
1 number six position.
