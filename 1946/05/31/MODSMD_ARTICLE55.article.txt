# Tennis Squad Hopes to Down Cal .Metiers
## 
### BULLET BULLOCK 
Coast Conference tennis of the
local variety bows out tomorrow af
ternoon in Berkeley as the tradi
tional California-Stanford net bat
tle takes to the courts. Both squads
will be attempting to hoist them
selves out of the league basement
â–  uid will unlimber their best shots
beginning at 1:30.
Hope blooms eternal in the
hearts of faithful Stanford sports
fans, and so no doubt a record
crowd will file into the Berkeley
arena to watch the Indians at
tempt (o rack up their initial
league triumph. Gossip has it
that maybe the Bed net machine,
battered and worn by a rather
dismal season, has finally found a
major opponent within its class.
At any rate, in last week's rain
oaked encounter with the Golden
Bear, Stanford awoke from its leth
argy to hold the Berkeley entry to
a two-all tie. But more important,
the "great divide" was accomplished
without the aid of Indian star, Arnie
Beisser, who has since returned and
is ready to meet Cameron Fair, top
seeded Calilornian, tomorrow.
