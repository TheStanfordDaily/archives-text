# Cat Baseballers Edge Stanford Team, 1211
## 
### 
Clint Evans' Cal baseballers made it 3-0 over the Stanford nine this
season by nipping the Farm boys 12 to 11. in a three-hour slugfest .yes
terday afternoon at the Sunken Diamond
The Blue and Gold team made five runs in the initial inning of two
bits and four errors and that was the difference between the two clubs.
They made another tally in the

I third, four Cal runs crossed the plate
, in the fifth, and two more came in
i the sixth.
STANFORD STARTS
After giving the Cal team a six
run advantage, Coach Harry Wol
ter's Stanford nine started to make
a game out of it. In the fifth inning
Buck Brownson hit a three-bagger
to drive in two Cardinal runs. Then
Brownson came in on a grounder by
i Merriman.
I Cal came back and scored two
j more runs in the first halt of the
sixth. In the other half of the in-
I ning the Stanford team really found
itself. Eight runs were driven in ofi
five hits and three errors. Twelve
Stanfordites faced three Cal pitch
i ers in this inning. Peters started
off the inning by taking base when
;he was hit by a pitched ball. Kol-
I lenberged walked and Lefty Pali
soul, who relieved Phil Wolf of the
mound duties half an inning pre
vious, drove Peters in with a sharp
single.
GETTING CLOSE!
j Singles by Narvan, Brownson,
Ahlquist, and Kellenberger counted
for seven more runs in this big in
ning and put the Farm boys one
tally behind the Bears.
For the remainder of the game
j both teams played air-tight ball, and
I try as they might the Stanford team
was unable to push across the tying
! score.
Both teams will meet again tomor
row, this time at Berkeley, to see
| if the overrated Bears will bo able
j to make it four straight over the
Farm lads.
