# LAST MUSIC CLASS
## 
### 
The last meeting of the quarter
for the class in Music 23 will be to
night in the choir room of Memo
rial Church at 7:30.
Dr. R. H. Bancroft, professor of
music history at the University of
California, will be the guest speak
er. His topic will be "The Influ
ence of Liszt, Wagner, and Berlioz
on the Music of Richard Strauss."
All interested students and fac
ulty are invited.

Jack Weiershauser's middle distance
and distance aces. Judging by what
they have done so far this season, j
both men can be figured for two j
first places or 20 points, and any
thing less will jeopardize the In
dians' showing.
Grimes can be tabbed for the 440
and 880, his 48.5 and 1:56 leading the
field by a healthy margin. Ganahl 1
will be called upon in the mile and
two-mile, where his 4:26 and 0:55
are the outstanding figures.
In the pole vault and low hurdles,
Bill Larson's 13 feet and Al Vier
thaler's 24.8 give the Farm another
pair of firstsâ€”and 30 points so far.
Which leaves the remaining 37
points up to the rest of the team.
The Indians should make two
sweeps, something they haven't done
all season, in the 880 and the low
hurdles, which will have to be to
offset a couple of Cal sweeps in the
220 and the javelin.
In the 880, besides Grimes, Al
Holubar, Bob Iverson and Frank
Olsen have turned in better times
than Cal's Mel Evans' 2:01, and in
the lows, Captain Martin Anderson
and Iverson will have to fight off
Johnny Meier and Bob Ewing lor
place and show.
ANDERSON MAY WIN KM)
Anderson has turned in better
times twice this season in the 100
than Cal's Terry Haws, yet the only
time they met, Haws wound up sec
ond in a 10 fiat century, while An

derson failed to place. For this one,
however, we'll piek Anderson to
win, with Haws leading Put Flowers
and Leo Kahn home in the 220.
The remaining points on the track
will have to be picked up as follows:
Will Schaupp. a third in the mile;
A 1 Wilkins, a third in the 440; Bill
Larson, a second in the high hur
! dies (and maybe a first!), which
! leaves it up to the relay team to
provide the all-important five points.
On the field, Cal's Max Yerxa,
Dave Goldeen, Lou Jurkovich and
Norm Pressley have the javelin
sewed up, with Yerxa's 191 feet
spreadeagling the field. In the shot
put, Jack Swaner holds the edge by
j two feet over Indian Bob Milling-
I ton.
