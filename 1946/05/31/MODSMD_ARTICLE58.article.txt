over the position next fall. Lan- 1
gendorf was sports editor in 1943
for one quarter, before he went
i the way of Uncle Sam's legions.
And these are the things that I

What Stanford's real attitude to- :
wards athletics is. Assured by some
j officials that the school favors in
i tercollegiate athletics, to other "as
j suranees" that Stanford wants to
[ drop sports, this writer frankly
j doesn't know which side is correct
; in their statements.
When Stanford will construct a ]
new track stadium. Realizing that
now is a poor time for construction,
! definite plans should be made for
I such a venture at Stanford.
What are the chances of Stanford j

Not really needed now, it's some- 1
thing to look forward to.
