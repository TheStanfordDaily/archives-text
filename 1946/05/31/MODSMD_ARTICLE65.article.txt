1 World Federation, will beyin an ac
| celerated membership drive with
| the publication tomorow of its
â–  newsletter, "The New Federalist."
The organization, whose constitu

nesdav, is affiliated with groups in !
j Yale, Harvard, Columbia, and other j
1 colleges throughout the country. j
| Because of the large number of j
; Stanford members, the campus |
I group expects to be one of the most j
j active on the West Coast, according ;
i to Ait Berman, president. Students]
who join before the end of the |
| quarter will all be mailed summer

j national newsletter.
"We don't naively underestimate
; the obstacles involved in attaining
i world government," stated Berman.
| "but the necessity far outweighs
; the difficulties. World federation
| won't come by passively waiting un-
I til the world 'is ready.' Millions of
j the common people of the world,
j who know what war means, are |
ready now." I
