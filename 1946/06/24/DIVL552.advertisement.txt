A Useful
Tradition

NEW STANFORDITES will be quick to
learn one of Stanford's finest old tradi
tions, and a very useful one, too!
The tradition- has it and has had it (since
the advent of the automobile) that students
with wheels have gladly picked up students
without and carried them to or from Paly.
It's a mighty nice tradition.
But when they built the University Ave
nue underpass in 1941, the former "pickup
stand by the old S.P. Depot was gone. So
the "Daily" in an editorial dated March 1,
1941, established another spot as the "Ride
from-Paly" Corner.
Tine "Ride-from-Paly" Corner is on Uni
versity at High Street, right in front of
Wilson's. There's a telephone inside for your
use. And there's an awning outside to pro
tect you in all kinds of weather.
: You "without wheels" are certainly wel
come to use Wilson's "Ride-from-Paly" Coi
ner!
