The four-power Foreign Min
isters' Conference in Paris began
an intensive two-a-day schedule
yesterday, in a determined at
tempt to break its deadlock on
European peace treaties. It has
been Molotov's stand that there
can be no general peace confer
ence until the Big Four are in
agreement on peace terms for the
European Axis nations. But there
are indications, slight ones, that
the Russians may agree to let
sonic of the knotty problems go
before a general peace confer
ence, for solution by the 21 na
tions that fought the Axis in Eu
rope.
It was rumored in Paris that the
French had presented a compro
mise proposal on one of the tough
est problems, that of Trieste. The
grapevine recommendation was that
Trieste be established as a Fi'ee
City, on the Danzig plan. The area
would be administered by the U.N.
for ten years, after which cooling
off period, Trieste's eventual dispo
sal would be deckled by plebiscite.
CONSIDERING THE economic
importance of Trieste, which is a
port for Austria and Hungary as
well as for Italy and Yugoslavia,
permanent administration by the
U.N. might be the best answer.
There can be no permanent, satis
factory solution unless all legiti
mate interests are safeguarded.
India has interrupted normal
relations with the Union of South
Africa and filed a complaint with
the U.N., asking their interven
tion. India complains of a long
period of mistreatment of, and
discrimination against Indians in
the Boer dominion.
This is a ticklish situation for
Britain. Both parties are members
of the British Empire and. tradi
tionally, the Westminster govern
ment would mediate between them.
Any attempt of the British to inter
fere would, however, in one quarter
or another, be interpreted as an at
tack on the U.N., the national as
pirations of India, or the domestic
authority of South Africa.
It might, moreover, upset the
curent delicate Indian independ
ence negotiations, and the discus
sion of South Africa's strong rac?
prejudices by anyone will un
doubtedly hurt South Africa's
feelings.
ORGANIZATION OF the coa
lition government of President -
Premier of France Georges Bi
dault should be completed to
day. French Communists have
finally agreed to enter the cabi
net of the IVIKP (Popular He
publican) leader. Socialists have
already accepted posts, and
Herriot's Left-Republicans will
sunrort the coalition.

yesterday, in a determined at
tempt to break its deadlock on
European peace treaties. It has
been Molotov's stand that there
can be no general peace confer
ence until the Big Four are in
agreement on peace terms for the
European Axis nations. But there
are indications, slight ones, that
the Russians may agree to let
sonic of the knotty problems go
before a general peace confer
ence, for solution by the 21 na
tions that fought the Axis in Eu
rope.
It was rumored in Paris that the
French had presented a compro
mise proposal on one of the tough
est problems, that of Trieste. The
grapevine recommendation was that
Trieste be established as a Fi'ee
City, on the Danzig plan. The area
would be administered by the U.N.
for ten years, after which cooling
off period, Trieste's eventual dispo
sal would be deckled by plebiscite.
CONSIDERING THE economic
importance of Trieste, which is a
port for Austria and Hungary as
well as for Italy and Yugoslavia,
permanent administration by the
U.N. might be the best answer.
There can be no permanent, satis
factory solution unless all legiti
mate interests are safeguarded.
India has interrupted normal
relations with the Union of South
Africa and filed a complaint with
the U.N., asking their interven
tion. India complains of a long
period of mistreatment of, and
discrimination against Indians in
the Boer dominion.
This is a ticklish situation for
Britain. Both parties are members
of the British Empire and. tradi
tionally, the Westminster govern
ment would mediate between them.
Any attempt of the British to inter
fere would, however, in one quarter
or another, be interpreted as an at
tack on the U.N., the national as
pirations of India, or the domestic
authority of South Africa.
It might, moreover, upset the
curent delicate Indian independ
ence negotiations, and the discus
sion of South Africa's strong rac?
prejudices by anyone will un
doubtedly hurt South Africa's
feelings.
ORGANIZATION OF the coa
lition government of President -
Premier of France Georges Bi
dault should be completed to
day. French Communists have
finally agreed to enter the cabi
net of the IVIKP (Popular He
publican) leader. Socialists have
already accepted posts, and
Herriot's Left-Republicans will
sunrort the coalition.
