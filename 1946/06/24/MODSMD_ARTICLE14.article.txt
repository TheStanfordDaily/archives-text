# SUMMER REG MARK SET
## 130% Rise Shown; Ratio Soars to 3.28 
### 
' This is the biggest summer quarter in the history ot' Stanford," de
clared Dr. 11. Donald Winbigler, Registrar of the University. He an
nounced a total registration, as of Saturday morning, of 2S<>!).
These figures break down to 2082 men and 637 women for a civilian
total of 2719, plus 150 assigned to the School of Naval Administration.

Unofficial calculations worked this
out as a ratio of 3.2S men to each
woman.
I)R. WINBIGLER was confident
that filial figures would show a
summer enrollment of over 3,000
students.
Comparison with former registra
tion figures indicates an enrollment
approximately 130 per cent, over
1,500, more than last summer quar
ter. Summer quarter, 1945, saw a
sign-up of 500 military and
civilian students, <*vith women in
the majority.
THE REGISTRAR'S OFFICE ex
pects that Stanford's autumn quar
ter enrollment will represent the
absolute maximum capacity of the
University, approximately 7,000 stu
dents. Dr. Winbigler emphasized
that this was a reversal of Univer
sity policy which, up till now, op
posed any overcrowding.
"The Administration feels," the
Registrar said, "that Stanford must
do its part in the present national
educational emergency." He point
ed out that, even at capacity regis
tration, less than half the well
qualified applicants could be ac
cepted. New students, he said, were
admitted on the basis of their pre
vious academic records and on their
aptitude for college work as ex
pressed in the Aptitude Tests.
It was Dr. Winbigler's conclusion
that peak enrollment at or near the
7,000 figure could be expected to
continue throughout the academic
year 1546-47. Average enrollment
in the first three quarters of 1945-4-G
was less than 4,500 per quarter.
