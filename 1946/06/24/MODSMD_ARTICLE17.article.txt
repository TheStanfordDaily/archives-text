# THE
						SUMMER DAILY
## 
### 
The Summer Daily will he as
professional a newspaper as is
possible within the limits of its
(ahloid size and undermanned
staff.
It will attempt to dig out factual
material to provide ammunition
in the many arguments raging
over Stanford's peacetime future.
A conspicuous lack in these dis
cussions so far has been the ab
sence of facts as to the Univer
sity's exact position as to finances,
faculty, etc.
This lack has not been due to
any restrictive policy on informa
tion on the part of those who
know, but to the inertia of the ar
guing "experts" on the "inside" at
Stanford.
The Daily will give its opinion
on University policy when it has
the facts to back up that opinion.
But the editorial board has nei
ther professional axe - grinders
and viewers - with - alarm nor
chronic Pollyannas who think ev
erything is rosy in the life of the
University.
The Daily assumes the function
of leadership in welding veterans
and non-veterans into a student
body that understands Stanford's
problems and works co-operative
ly toward their solution.
It will speak for veterans as
Stanford students, not as veterans.
It will emphasize the fact that a
University exists for its students.
It will also emphasize that at
Stanford the set-up is such that
students assume responsibility and
govern themselves. These stu
dent government functions must
be preserved, and the responsibil
ity lies largely with the students
who are elected to perform them.
It will be a particular purpose of
the Daily to point out when and
where student government may be
made more effective.
The Daily exists for the students
and faculty. The door is never
locked, either to workers or peo
ple with a beef. Our Campus
Opinion column is open to any per
son who will couch his offering in
decent language and print it over
his name.
A new policy of the Summer
Daily will be that 110 letters will
be printed over noni de plumes.
The times are too serious for any
person at Stanford to refuse to
put his personality behind his be
liefs.
Usually the Daily is able to pre
sent full United Press coverage of
world events, a necessary func
tion of the paper. Under summer
quarter publishing conditions, one
column. News and Comment by
Ted Norton, will be devoted to a
discussion of the morning's ofl
campus news.
Besides Campus Opinion offer
ings. the Daily welcomes feature
stories and other material sub
mitted by our readers which will
be run in a Guest Column from
time to time.
Unsigned editorials are by the
■ditor.
