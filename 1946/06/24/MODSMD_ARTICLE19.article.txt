## Bull Session 
### 
Bull Session was "discontinued"
in the Daily two months ago when
H. D. Thoreau got puckered, and
rightfully so, because the feminine
hierarchy censored hi* column—
which was within their preroga
tive. But those days are gone—for
the summer at least.
Veterans, 4F's and those "too
young to know" have by some ac
cident ascended to power. Women,
however, are not excluded from
the Daily. To the contrary: We
need talent. Only condition is that
they consent —oops —to take mas
culine names. Marion "George"
Morrow and Jacqueline "John"
Boucher have done this. But they
are lonesome. Come join the nu
cleus!
>!« # *
Men with cars, unlimited re
sources and acquaintanceship with
the Lagunita "elite" are welcome,
too. In short, "The Peninsula's
Only Morning (three times a
week) Daily" needs assistance.
# * *
Policy of Bull Session this sum
mer will remain undefined and
vague. We shall perhaps tilt at
a few windmills — and probably
with the same effect that Don Q.
had—register a few gripes, tell a
few stories (clean) and if fortu
nate hear from our corespondents.
Bob Norton, of the biz school, said,
in a weak moment, he would
write a guest column. We are
hereby publicly putting him on
the spot.
We shall also take a look-see at
student government, and if her
social life permits, we hope also
to present a few reports from our
Lagunita corespondent on the
state of things in that hallowed
hall.

Apology: If the news in this
first issue seems old it is because
it is. We are grateful to the
downtown newspaper for covering
for us during finals and the end
quarter interval.
