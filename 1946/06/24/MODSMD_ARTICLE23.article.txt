# Russian-US Problems Can Be Solved--Fisher
## 
### 
The difficulties which have come
up in relations between the United
States and Russia are not insur
mountable, but require hard work
and close co-operation on the part
â€¢of both countries to resolve, ac
cording to Dr. Harold H. Fisher,
director of the Hoover War Li
brary.
Dr. Fisher, speaking at the open
ing session of the Eighth Annual
Editors' Conference of the Cali
fornia Newspaper Publishers' As
sociation held on the campus this
weekend, gave three reasons for
the strain in Russ-American rela
tions in the past few months. They
were:
1. The high-handed attitude of
the Russians in the conquered
territories they occupy;
2. Lack of co-operation by the
Russians in the United Nations ]
Security Council; and
3. The continuing spread of |
Communism throughout the world, j
Dr. Fisher said that the diffi
culties which face the two coun- |
tries cannot be solved by a deci- |
sion of who is right and who is !
wrong on particular issues, espe- !
cially in view of atomic and bac- 1
terial weapons.
"It's like the traffic accident j
where the heirs argue about who
was at fault, only in this case \
there might well be no heirs," Dr. j
Fisher said.

speaking at the three-day confer
ence and their topics included:
Ernest R. Hilgard, executive
head of the Department of Psy
chology, "Remolding the Japa
nese Mind"; and Chilton R. Bush,
