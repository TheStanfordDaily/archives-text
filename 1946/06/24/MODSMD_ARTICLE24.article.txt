# Another Crop Of Film Corn
## 
### 
"One More Tomorrow," a story
of love around Washington Square,
is just one fore crop of corn from

the Hollywood
juke mill. De
spite the val
iant efforts of
Dennis Mor
gan, Ann Sher
idan, Jack Car
son, Jane Wy
man and Alex
is Smith, the
film never rises
above the lev-

el of the ordi
nary matinee product.
Dennis Morgan is starred as the
poor little rich boy with a million
dollar bank account and a social
conscience who finds that paying
the losses for a "liberal" magazine
is fun. The love interest is sup
plied by Alexis Smith and Ann
Sheridan. Miss Smith, who spends
most of her time in tight dresses
and transparent nightgowns, gives
a convincing performance as the
wife who worships money but not
her husband; but Miss Sheridan
offers a rather sad picture of the
poor little working girl who wants
love "to be overpowering."
Other- characters adding to the
general confusion are Jane Wy
man and Reginald Owen. Mr.
Owen spends most of his time flat
on his back apparently bored by
the whole business, and who can
blame him? Although the story
was adapted from a play by Philip
Barry, it must have been one of
his bad days, for it is far from an
other Barry hit.â€”Heintze
