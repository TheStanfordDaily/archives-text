# Married, Single Vets' Housing to be Ready by Fall
## Assignment Plans Not Yet Perfected 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
At least 88 housing units for mar
ried couples and dormitory space for
2,400 single veterans will be made
available for Stanford students at
Dibble General Hospital by the be
ginning of fall quarter.
Plans call for an ultimate total of
300 apartments, and if labor and ma
terials are available some units in
addition to the original 88 will be
ready for occupancy by fall.
THESE ARE THE AIMS of the
reconversion program begun fol
lowing government authorization ten
days ago for University use of the
Dibble buildings being vacated by
the Army.
Applications for housing at Dibble
are being taken by the Office of the
Dean of Students. Although specific
plans for assigning housing have not
yet been perfected, it will be done
on a basis of need for housing, pri
ority of registering for housing, and
type of accommodation required.
Present plans are to have a commit
tee of students assist Dean John
Stalnaker in making the assign
ments.
FURTHER INFORMATION on as
signment of applicants will be avail
able in the near future.
President Donald B. Tresidder,
commenting on the Dibble project,
said, "We are very pleased that
these facilities have been made
available to the University because
they will enable us to accommodate
many more veterans, for whom edu
cational facilities are desperately
needed, than would otherwise be
possible."
HE ALSO STATED that Stan
ford's needs will not conflict with
plans of Menlo Park to use recrea
tional facilities of the hospital.
At present the University actually

has a contract only for the 11 bar
racks on which work is starting im
mediately. A verbal agreements
provides that after Juhe 30, final
close-up date for the Army, Stan
ford will receive all housing facili
ties and necessary buildings inci
dental to housing—recreation rooms,
library reading rooms, and mess

halls.
APARTMENTS will have either
one or two bedrooms, and each unit
will also contain a living room,
kitchen, and bath. They will be
furnished, including icebox and
stove, but blankets, linens, dishes,
and kitchen supplies must be pro
vided by the occupant.
The housing project will be ad
ministered by the University under
the Federal Public Housing Author
ity's management plans for such fa
cilities. Rents will be fixed by the
FPHA.
THE FPHA WILL CONVERT the
buildings into apartments and as
sist the University in furnishing
them. Stanford will be responsible
for preparation of quarters for sin
gle veterans. Conversion of these
quarters will not require major
structural changes but will require
additional plumbing facilities and
other alterations.
According to Business Manager
Alf Brandin, single students will cat
in dining rooms operated by the
University. The FPHA will assist
in obtaining necessary equipment
for this operation.
"WE ARE GRATEFUL for the co
operative and helpful spirit of Colo

nel Streit and other Army authori
ties and of the representatives of the
FPHA." Mr. Brandin said. "They
have recognized our urgent need for
additional housing facilities for vet
eran students and have done every
thing in their power to make these
facilities available to us as soon as
possible."
