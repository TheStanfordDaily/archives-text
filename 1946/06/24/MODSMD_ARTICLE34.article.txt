# Dr. Barkan on Way Home from Paris
## 
### 
Dr. Hans Barkan, professor of
eye diseases at Stanford, is en route
home from a tour of Europe.
Dr. Barkan has been visiting his
90-year-old mother in Montrcux,
Switzerland, and has compiled a re
port on Swiss medical schools.
"Swiss schools are far superior to
any other medical schools in Eu
rope," he reported. He attributes
this to their uninterrupted curric
ula during the war. He is flying
from New York after a transatlantic
flight from Paris via Constellation.
