# Dibble Facilities Added to Farm
## Provides Homes For 2,000 Veterans 
### DON CARLSON 
Stanford's many problems arising
from a steadily increasing enroll
ment (estimated at 7,000 students by
September 21) shifted their weight
iast week. The shift came as Dibble
General Hospital at Menlo Park be
came a physical part of the Farm in
stead of an intangible hope.
Some 2,000 new veteran students
could be admitted to Stanford be
cause of the housing Dibble offers.
The pressure was off from one quar
ter: the Veterans' Administration.
The pressure was still on from an
other: Stanford's married students.
BY AUTUMN QUARTER Uni
versity officials believe 83 living
units will be available for married
students. Perhaps by January 1 next
year 300 Stanford families may be '
living at Dibble. There was hope j
that another 300 might be housed '
there next spring.
The Dibble project alerted new |
questions. Some of the answers
were on tap, more were not. Many
a married student wanted to know
on what basis those who would be
allowed to live at Dibble would be
selected. The Administration said
that "selections will be made upon
the degree of urgency." To every
married student dissatisfied with the
housing he now possessed, his own
case seemed urgent enough. But he
still had little idea of how his case
compared with the other 1.000-odd
requests for housing on the dean's
office list.
WHAT ABOUT RENTS? Fami
lies would probably pay around $35
a month plus utilities. It was a
guess. The Administration was still
figuring costs and, as yet, had no
official word to hand down on rents.
Would transportation to the cam
pus be furnished? The plans includ
ed a system to bus students to and
from Dibble.
STUDENTS WERE READY with
more questions, but the Administra
tion is not ready with answers for
what the future at Dibble will be
like. It is more concerned with
seeking out the proportions of just
what it has, and what can be done
with what it has, in Dibble Hospital, j
Turning 120 acres of hospital into a
housing projects smacks of hard [
work, easy to come by criticism, and I
small thanks.
As an Army hospital Dibble was j
constructed with no view to econ
omy operation. Such things as its j
central heating plant would cost the j
University a goodly sum to operate, j
Probably five licensed steam engi- j
neers would have to be added to the |
payroll to keep this elaborate equip
ment working.
NO ONE WAS SURE the sewage ;
disposal would be adequate. During j
World War I, when Dibble was em
bryonically formed, a two-foot j
wooden pipe was installed to carry
the sewage out into the Bay. After
>o many years of use and disuse it i
was questionable whether or not the
old pipe could stand the new strain.
With materials and labor still hard
to find, construction on the project
is sure to hit snags, turn up a few
disappointments. But conversion of
the barracks into dormitories for
single men promises to be an easier
task than rebuilding some of the j
units into family apartments. Facil
ities for the men will lack privacy,
but promise to be adequate and
comfortable. More elaborate fur
nishings may take away much of the
G.I. atmosphere.
MOST RECREATIONAL equip
ment will probably go to'thr city of
Menlo Park. Among that equip
ment: One of the finest swimming
pools in the Bay Area and a well
kept softball diamond.
For the 3.000 Stanford people who
will probably be housed at Dibble
by the first of the year, plans are
being made to furnish a convenient
store and lunch room. To what ex
tent commercial activity will be
permitted and on what basis is still
a question unsettled by the Admin
istration.

a married student wanted to know
on what basis those who would be

case seemed urgent enough. But he
still had little idea of how his case
compared with the other 1.000-odd
requests for housing on the dean's
office list.
WHAT ABOUT RENTS? Fami
lies would probably pay around $35
a month plus utilities. It was a
guess. The Administration was still
figuring costs and, as yet, had no
official word to hand down on rents.
Would transportation to the cam
pus be furnished? The plans includ
ed a system to bus students to and
from Dibble.
STUDENTS WERE READY with
more questions, but the Administra
tion is not ready with answers for
what the future at Dibble will be
like. It is more concerned with
seeking out the proportions of just
what it has, and what can be done
with what it has, in Dibble Hospital, j
Turning 120 acres of hospital into a
housing projects smacks of hard [
work, easy to come by criticism, and I

As an Army hospital Dibble was j
constructed with no view to econ
omy operation. Such things as its j
central heating plant would cost the j
University a goodly sum to operate, j
Probably five licensed steam engi- j
neers would have to be added to the |
payroll to keep this elaborate equip
ment working.
NO ONE WAS SURE the sewage ;
disposal would be adequate. During j
World War I, when Dibble was em
bryonically formed, a two-foot j
wooden pipe was installed to carry
the sewage out into the Bay. After
>o many years of use and disuse it i
was questionable whether or not the
old pipe could stand the new strain.
With materials and labor still hard
to find, construction on the project
is sure to hit snags, turn up a few
disappointments. But conversion of
the barracks into dormitories for
single men promises to be an easier
task than rebuilding some of the j
units into family apartments. Facil
ities for the men will lack privacy,
but promise to be adequate and
comfortable. More elaborate fur
nishings may take away much of the
G.I. atmosphere.
MOST RECREATIONAL equip
ment will probably go to'thr city of
Menlo Park. Among that equip
ment: One of the finest swimming
pools in the Bay Area and a well
kept softball diamond.
For the 3.000 Stanford people who
will probably be housed at Dibble
by the first of the year, plans are
being made to furnish a convenient
