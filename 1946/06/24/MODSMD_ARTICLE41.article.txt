# A 						DIBBLE BOUQUET
## 
### 
With the Dibble fuss and furor settled favorably for Stanford,
enabling the University to take care of a 50 per cent increase in
enrollment, those officials were instrumental in winning what
Dr. Tresidder has labeled a "great gamble" deserve the heartiest
of congratulations.
It is to be hoped that those individuals and organizations who
were so active in panning these people while the project was in
the uncertain stage will be equally as lavish with their praise now
that the matter has been settled successfully. ,!
The advantage of the Dibble plan over the various schemes
to erect temporary structures is obvious. Some well known char
acter has stated that, "There is nothing so permanent as a tempo
rary building."
Most important problem calling for solution is that of assign
ing applicants to Dibble. An ironclad system for making these
assignments, especially insofar as families are concerned, is
urgently needed.
To say that this will be done on a basis of "need for housing"
is not enough. Actual regulations must be devised that will make
it possible to make assignments according to a strict plan, and
this plan should be made public right now, so that applicants
concerned will know exactly where they stand.
By setting this machinery up now those who have been given
this difficult task will undoubtedly save themselves and the vet- J
erans and their families a lot of worry and grief.
An important problem faces Stanford's student government —
the incorporation of the Dibble vets into the student administra
tive system. When the project is completed more than one-third
of the Farm family will be housed off campus.
Plans must be made now to stimulate the Dibble group's inter
est in student affairs, and the best way this can be done is to
have a workable program that will insure their active participa
tion ready when school opens next fall. Summer Excom has a
job to do.—Jerry Brucker.
