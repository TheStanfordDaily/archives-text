# Farm's Gamble Paid Off, Tresidder Tells Alumni
## 
### 
"Our greatest gamble has paid off," President Donald B. Tresidder de
clared in an address Saturday before the annual assembly of the Stanford
Alumni Association, referring to the acquisition by Stanford of Dibble
General Hospital facilities for housing veterans.
"We based our chances on getting Dibble because we felt it was worth

a great gamble," he said. "The re
sult is incomparably better than wi
might have hoped for with trailei
camps and the like and the many
special problems that go with such'
projects."
PRELIMINARY CALCULATION
he stated, indicates that Stanford's
enrollment next fall may be 7,000
This calculation may be upset by
extension of Selective Service, with
consequent drafting of nlany young
er students, and by the fact that th<
number of veterans who will drop
out and the number of former
Stanford students who will return
without notice are unknown.
"WE ARE PROUD," he said, "that
Stanford University by its recem
bold action is going to stand out as
a leader in meeting the emergency
of stretching educational facilities to
accommodate unprecedented num
bers of students."
He emphasized the fact that this
current expansion is an emergency
rather than a long-range policy, cal
culated to relieve the great shortage
of men trained in the sciences and ii
other fields.
I)R. TRESIDDER OUTLINED the
University's basic long-range ob
jectives as follows:
1. Continuation of the Founders
original objective "to train young
people for usefulness in life."
2. Continuation of fullest utiliza
tion of the space with which the
Founders wisely endowed the Uni
versity. "We are grateful," he said
"for a country setting with plenty of
space to enable us to be a true resi
dential University."
3. Stanford started as a private
gift-supported institution, "and wt
propose not to take on any obliga
tions tending to weaken our inde
pendence."
4. Stanford will continue to re
cruit brilliant young men for its
faculty.
