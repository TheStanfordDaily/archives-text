We talked with golf coach Eddie
i Twiggs a little while ago about the
j chances of Stanford's five men golf
j team taking the nationals this week
j back in Princeton, New Jersey, and
! he believes we stand an excellent
! chance of winning.
BEFORE DISCONTINUING col
| legiate sports, the Farm emerged
I victorious four of the last five times
we participated. Coming back to ac
; tion after two seasons of blackout,
! the golf team swept all but one meet
I and monopolized the conference
| championship played on their home
course.
Making the trip east were Frank
i MeCann, Bob Cardinal, Jack Schul
er, Tom Larnby, and Bob Rosburg.
Our best bet seems to be in team
j play, although if McCann or Ros
! burg can equal their best rounds
j this year, one of them may return
j to the Farm with the title.
Stanford has a two-man team en
tered in the NCAA tennis cham
pionships beginning today in Evans
ton, 111., home of Northwestern. Ar
| nold Beisser and Bob Rutledge made
the trip .
The expenses for this trip are
i coming out of their pockets and are
[ not being paid for by the Univer
sity.
Eastern papers are writing that
j Illinois is dickering for a 1947 or '48
; grid contest with Stanford. No one
| seems to know a thing about it at
i this end.
