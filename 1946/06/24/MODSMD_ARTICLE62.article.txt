# New Rules Made On Buying Books
## 
### 
Effective tomorrow, veterans of
Stanford may purchase their re
quired books and supplies from any
store which has them available, un-
Jer a new procedure announced by
George D. Barahal, Veterans' Co
ordinator for the University.
Purchases from the Stanford
Bookstore are not affected by the
-â€¢hange. Veterans can continue to
make their purchases there on the
forms already in use.
If veterans elect to buy required
material at any other store, they
.should go to room 164 in the Ad
ministration Building, where a spe
cial form will be completed for
them. No purchase should be made
vvithout such a form.
This is a change from the proce
dure outlined in the "Stanford Vet
erans' Guide," item nine, paragraph
five, which should be disregarded.
