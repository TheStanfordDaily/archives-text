Nathan van Patten, Director of
University Libraries, said last night
that the libraries would be open on
Sunday according to the schedules
of former quarters.
Pieason for yesterday's closing of
the library, he said, was trouble
with organization of the summer
staff. He said organization would be
completed in time for the remaining
Sundays in summer quarter.
