The draft - extension bill has
passed both Houses and gone to
the President. The War Depart
ment, however, has announced
that it will take no draftees in
July or August. With the threat
of the draft in the middle distance,
they hope to ensnare sufficient
volunteers.
The importance of a strong mili
tary force in the present troubled
world is considerable. The disinte
gration of our forces under our en
thusiastic demobilization program
impressed the foreign powers, and
not in our favor, either.
The Senate committee has ap
proved the bill to give enlisted
men terminal leave pay. How
ever, interference from the Navy
Department has delayed their for
mal report. The Navy wishes tu
present information on its stand on
the measure.
Naturally, I favor the bill. I can
use the money. And, if the officers
are allowed terminal leave privileges
there is no good reason why the EM
shouldn't have them. But, consider
ing the cost of the project, its infla
tionary tendencies, and the size of
the national debt, it is not the sort
of bill for whose passage I would as
semble and petition the government,
or even write a letter to my Con
gressman. This delay suggests that
the Administration is trying to hold
up the bill as long as possible with
out definitely alienating the affec
tions of the veterans and, particular
ly, of the veterans' organizations.
Reports from the Conference of
Foreign Ministers in Paris say that
Secretary Byrnes is much encour
aged after a series of private talks
with Molotov and with Bevin and
Bidault separately, as well as the
two daily formal meetings.
Actually, if the Conference has
made any progress, it is in atmos
phere and understanding. True.
Austria's claim to the South Tyrol
was denied, but results of discus
sion of freedom of navigation on
the Danube were inconclusive. The
Trieste question remains unsettled,
too. It appears that the U.S.. though
conscious of the failure of "free
city" and "plebiscite" schemes in
the past, still prefers a solution on
non-national grounds.
The House has passed the com
promise OPA extension bill, sub
stantially in the form approved
by the conference committee.
Price ceilings on "market-basket'
items were retained, but a ''de
control" board, with final say 011
removal of ceilings, was set up.
This is substantially the bill that
Chester Bowles denounced as
"booby - trapped," but Speaker
Rayburn told the House that he
believed that the President would
sign the bill, if it passed the Sen
ate.
