## 
### 
An attempt to break open the safe of the Encina Gym Store failed last
weekend, but the thief made oft with several articles ol' athletic apparel.
The robbery was discovered at 10 a.m. Monday, and the Stanford po
lice were immediately called to the scene.
Campus Police Chief "Gordy" Davis made a thorough investigation

+ and called in John Perussina,
I chief investigating officer of the
San Jose sheriff's office, who rec
corded all fingerprints found on
the scene. These prints will be
checked with FBI files in Wash
ington.and an answer is expected
within a few days.
I The bandit gained entrance to the
i store, probably at night, by cutting
| through a padlock with a hacksaw,
after unsuccessfully attempting to
' get in through the skylight and try
ing to force apart the steel bars of
| a sliding door.
The safe, which actually contains
; only a little money used to make
| change and serves mainly as a re-
I pository for the store's records, was
j moved out of position and deeo
i rative knobs were removed from
the hinges, but it was not struc
turally damaged.
Extent of the loss will not be
definitely known until after a
complete inventory has been
made, but the thief evidently lim
ited his activities to taking sev
eral pairs of wool socks, sizes 11
to 12, swimming and gym shorts,
size .'54. and shirts and gym shoes-
Many more expensive items such
I as hand bags and swim fins were
left untouched.
Chief Davis, contacted late yes
' terday by the Daily, said that there
had been no new developments on
! the case and that, in his opinion. "It
i was not a professional job."
