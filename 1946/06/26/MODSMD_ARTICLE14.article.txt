WHAT GOOD'S THE 3.28?
Some of the Lagunitians were sitting around this weekend
wondering where the much publicized 3.2Bths of a man per
woman was hanging out. And the 3.2Bths are wondering how to
get the campus social life rolling.
With a lot of new people on campus, veterans and other
wise, some sort of "get-acguainted" medium is in order.
As one small contribution, the Daily suggests the Cellar
lukebox be taken upstairs to the Nitery so a few people could
dance now and then. The coke machine is here, and with a
smaller summer guarter student body and the lack of much
competing social life, The Nitery could probably be more of a
campus drawing card than it was in other quarters.
Isn't it about time that the old Stanford tradition of the
"coke date" be revived?â€” Jack Oqlesby.
