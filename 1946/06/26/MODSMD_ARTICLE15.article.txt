						Stanford Sherlock-- Farm Has Crime Doctor
## 
### 
Shades of Sherlock Holmes!
Stanford has a real, live, murder
expert, the kind that wanders
wisely through the pages of pop
ular detective whodunits by Earl
Stanley Gardner, Raymond Chan
dler and other top rank mystery
authors.
• He is Dr. Joseph Catton, clinical
professor of medicine at the
Farm's medical school. Teaching
is his main job, but murder is
more than his hobby because it
brings in cold, hard cash.
UU. CATTON SPECIALIZES in
the study of quirks in the human
mind which produce mayhem, and
frequently takes time out from his
task of instructing medical stu
dents in mental diseases to appear
as a professional witness in mur
der trials.
He may be retained by the
prosecution or defense. In either
case his method is to make a
thorough investigation of the past
and present of the accused, and of
the crime they are charged with.
From conversations with friends
and relatives of the accused and
other people who have contacts
with them, he develops an ex
haustive case history.
WHEN lIE HAS ANALYZED this
history he forms an opinion and is
ready to take the stand at the
trial.
Among the more than 50 cases
in which Dr. Catton has appeared
as a professional witness, the most
famous were the trials of Winnie
Judd, William Hickman, and An
nie Irene Mansfeldt. In the wide
ly publicized Massie case in Hono
lulu he engaged in a verbal duel
with defense attorney Clarence
Darrow, one of the first and best
known of "criminal lawyers."
