## Bull Session 
### 
We have received a scurrilous
letter, signed merely "Willie and
Joe," registering a tremendous
beel about "house mothers."
"Willie and Joe," obviously old
combat infantrymen, are consider
ably miffed over having in their
hall, Branner, a "house mother."
"We fought the war without
maternal guidance; why can't we
enjoy the reconversion without
it?" the letter said.
"Rifle companies never had
women —in combat, that is," it
added.
The letter wefit on to point out
that in pre - war days Branner
never had a house mother, adding
that the present matron is taking
up room space that could be occu
pied by four students.
Blame for this horrible happen
ing Willie and Joe lay on "Heir
Direktor Sharp."
About this the Bull Sessioner
isn't sure. While I haven't looked
fully into the matter, I don't think
Dr. Sharp would do such a thing
of his own volition.
Besides being a good basketball
scorer, Dr. Sharp is a hard-work
ing, affable gentleman. Besides,
he once saved me from a terrific
scourging at the hands of John
"Tallyho" Bunn, now back to bas
ketball coaching, by the way. (Re
member the Branner clod fight,
Stan?)
We realize that during the war
house mothers were necessary for
the youngsters, and that sponsors
are necessary in Encina to provide
some sort of check on exuberant
frosh spirit.
But we don't think, being an old
Branner resident, that regimenta
tion, other than a student assist
ant, is necessary in that hall now,
filled as it is with mature Stanford
men.
The decision rests, probably,
with the higher-ups of the Ad
ministration and probably is the
opening gun in the old campaign
to get house mothers for the fra
ternity houses. But why make
Branner the test site?

Of equal seriousness is a news
item that the off-sale price of that
nut-brown October stuff has gone
up I cent in price. On-sale price
is to go up a penny, too. Ain't re
conversion hell?
