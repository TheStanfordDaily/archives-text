# Campus Opinion
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Will you please publish a small
map of the campus on which the
location of the Hoover home is
conspicuously marked with an
"X"? I should like to cut it out
and carry it with me. It would
prove helpful in directing the
summer swarm of pilgrims to the
shrine.
Thus far I've been sending visi
tors to hte Presidential mansion.
It's easier to find and possible to
see — and it makes the pilgrims
happy. But my conscience both
ers me.

The Editor, Sir:
I notice, in glancing through this
morning's Daily, that you are off
on the same path as the Dailies of
the past few quarters with regards
to your movie reviews. It betrays,
as have most of the ones in the
past, the ignorant and brashly
"sophomoric" attitude of your re
viewer.
I think it might be well for your
movie critic, whoever he or she
may be, to learn the fundamentals
of criticism and realize that caus
ticity is no longer an acceptable
substitute for intelligent criticism.
It is interesting to compare your
reviewer's column with that which
appeared recently in "The New
Yorker" by John McCarten. who
is acknowledged to be one of our
finest critics.
The Daily: "'One More Tomor
row' . . . just one more crop of
corn from the Hollywood juke
mill . . . never rises above the
ordinary level of the matinee
product."
The New Yorker: ". . . it's a
whole lot easier to watch than
most of the pictures that have
come along of late.''
The Daily: ". . . Miss Sheridan
offers a rather sad picture."
The New Yorker: "As the ideal
woman, Ann Sheridan is eminent
ly satisfactory."
May I suggest that before your
reviewer writes any more reviews
which are so obviously not valid
criticism, he take the time to read
an article in this month's "Atlan
tic" by Russell Maloney called
"Off Stage." Then, when he writes
his reviews in the future, he may
bear in mind that he is. to quote
Mr. Maloney. "just one member ol
the audience and not necessarily
the most cultured one at that."
Sincerely yours.

row' . . . just one more crop of
corn from the Hollywood juke
mill . . . never rises above the
ordinary level of the matinee

The New Yorker: "As the ideal

May I suggest that before your
reviewer writes any more reviews
which are so obviously not valid
criticism, he take the time to read
an article in this month's "Atlan
tic" by Russell Maloney called
"Off Stage." Then, when he writes
his reviews in the future, he may
bear in mind that he is. to quote
Mr. Maloney. "just one member ol
the audience and not necessarily
the most cultured one at that."

The Editor, Sir:
Will you please publish a small
map of the campus on which the
location of the Hoover home is
conspicuously marked with an
"X"? I should like to cut it out
and carry it with me. It would
prove helpful in directing the
summer swarm of pilgrims to the
shrine.
Thus far I've been sending visi
tors to hte Presidential mansion.
It's easier to find and possible to
see — and it makes the pilgrims
happy. But my conscience both
ers me.

Hoover. Headers are again re

The Editor, Sir:
I notice, in glancing through this
morning's Daily, that you are off
on the same path as the Dailies of
the past few quarters with regards
to your movie reviews. It betrays,
as have most of the ones in the
past, the ignorant and brashly
"sophomoric" attitude of your re
viewer.
I think it might be well for your
movie critic, whoever he or she
may be, to learn the fundamentals
of criticism and realize that caus
ticity is no longer an acceptable
substitute for intelligent criticism.
It is interesting to compare your
reviewer's column with that which
appeared recently in "The New
Yorker" by John McCarten. who
is acknowledged to be one of our
finest critics.
