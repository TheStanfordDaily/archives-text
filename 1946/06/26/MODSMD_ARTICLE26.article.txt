With the sale of the Cleveland
Indians to a syndicate headed by
Bill Veeck, formerly of the Mil
waukee Brewers, we hear many a
rumor that Lou Boudreau is on his
way out as manager. The same ru
mors further state that Jimmy
Dykes, recently evicted from the
management of the Chicago White
Sox. is to move into the supposedly
vacated job.
WE HAVE YET TO SEE a short
stop superior to Lou Boudreau.
Balls that look like sure hits he
makes into just another putout. He
steadies the entire infield, which,
outside of Kenny Keltner at third,
is an extremely young group.
He has had nothing but trouble
with the front office and yet has
produced a fair outfit.
YOU MAY SAY if he is so good,
how come the Indians are today in
sixth place in American League
standings. Outside of Bob Feller,
his pitching staff hasn't produced.
Last year's ace, Allie Reynolds, has
won only two games all season long
while dropping eight decisions. The
old management just wouldn't back
Lou up with any players.
No. we can't see where Jimmy
Dykes would come as an improve
ment over the best shortstop in the
league. Lou Boudreau.
