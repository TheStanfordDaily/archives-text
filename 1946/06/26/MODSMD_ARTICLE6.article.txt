## 
### 
Kodachrome motion pictures of
sharp peaks, deep canyons, roaring
streams, and Sierra panoramas gave
the Tuesday Series audience in Me
morial Hall auditorium last night
impressive views of Kings Canyon
National Park.
Miss Charlotte Mauk of the Sierra
Club, who narrated the film, pref
aced her talk with a plea for public
appreciation and action to forestall
commercial threats to wilderness
areas of the nation.
The picture, entitled "Skyland
Trails of the Kings," was filmed by
two Sierra Club cameramen and
presented in the interest of attract
ing public appreciation of the vaca
tion area of the Kings River Canyon
and surrounding Sierra.
Pack trip experiences were por
trayed by the film. Angling for
Golden trout, scaling of Sierra
peaks, and the coaxing of stubborn
pack mules over 12,000-foot passes
amply presented the rugged life
available in the Sierra for those
who wish to enjoy it.
Excellent, photography combined
with the fine natural views gave the
film beauty and superb technical
proficiency.
A photographic change of pace
from time to time gave the picture
sufficient variety. Close-ups of wild
flowers and colorful butterflies al
ternated with shots of massive peaks
framed by huge cloud formations.
The program, first in the Summer
Series, was presented to a near-ca
pacity vacation audience.
