# New Vet Book Plan Revoked
## 
### 
George D. Barahal, University
Veterans' Co-ordinator, announced
yesterday that the new book-buy
ing plan for veterans reported in
Monday's Daily has been revoked.
Veterans will again follow the pro
cedure outlined under Question 9,
Stanford Veterans' Guide.
"The alternative plan was de
veloped at the request of an out
side bookstore," Mr. Barahal ex
plained. "Now, however, the out
side bookstore has decided the al
ternative plan is unacceptable.
Consequently, we are reverting
to the original procedure."
Under the proposed new system
veterans would have been able to
buy from any outside bookstore by
first securing a special form and
having it filled out. The change
would not have affected purchases
at the Stanford Bookstore.
Veterans who do not have a copy
of the "Guide" may obtain one from
the Information window in the Ad
Building lobby.

and detailed roundup of the vet
erans' book situation in Friday's
Daily.)
