We want to sell books to veterans.
We are not permitted to do so.
You are not allowed to choose where you want to buy
your books in the competitive market without pro
hibitive restrictions.
You are required to buy at one source except for an
occasional book which cannot be supplied at that one
source.
We are asked to supply that occasional book and to
forego any other veteran business.
We cannot stay in business under those restrictions.
For 10 years we have been saving Stanford students
money on textbooks.
If you were allowed to buy used texts at our store
you could save '4 of your book allowance.
At other universities veterans are allowed to choose
where to get their books, but not here. Why ?
