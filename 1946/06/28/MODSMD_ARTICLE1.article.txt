(This column is printed in alter
nate splotches of bold-face and or
dinary type. The reason is that

Sen. Allien Barkley, Senate
majority leader, announced "day

It would ap- |

awarded to Greece, two Italian
border districts given to France,

Molotov. considerable, that is, com
pared to the usual Russian attitude.
There has been no decision, yet,
either on the question of free navi
gation of the Danube or on Trieste,
nor have they set any date for the
general European peace conference
which must confirm such decisions
as the ministers have managed to
make.
Bread will he rationed in Brit
ain. it was announced in the
House of Commons today. The
individual ration will be nine
ounces per day.
In this connection let me quote a
crack from "Punch." "Menus of
even medium-sized restaurants in
New York are as large as the aver
age British newspaper. This shows
how short of newsprint Britain is."
The attention of those inter
ested in the foundations of our
Ivory Tower—and don't think it
ain't, brother, don't think it ain't
—is respectfully directed to page
