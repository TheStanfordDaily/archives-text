# Bikini Test—"Unfortunate—Intelligent—Biased"?
## 
### BOYD HAIGHT 
(Editor's Note: The Daily has
collected opinions on Monday's
atom bomb tests at Bikini Atoll
from several faculty members
whose views, by reason of their
profession or prominence, are
entitled to consideration.)
Scientific opinion on the Bikini
tests is represented by that of
Hans Staub of the Physics De
partment. Prof. Staub speaks first
as a member of the Manhattan
Project which developed the atom
bomb and then as a private citi
zen.
"As a demonstration of airborne
and underwater effectiveness of
the bomb the Bikini tests are an
excellent plan. However, from
the standpoint of international re
lations, I think it is unfortunate
that we have undertaken to test
the bomb at this time. It is pos
sible that the Bikini show will be
interpreted throughout the world
as 'saber rattling.'
"If the test could be postponed
until an international control com
mission might supervise the ex
periment it would promote mu
tual confidence and understanding
within the United Nations."
SUPPORT OF THE BIKINI
project is presented by Chancel
lor Ray Lyman Wilbur.

"If the tests
are carried out
on the grand
scale that has
been planned
they should be
invaluable in
giving add i -
tional indica
tions of what
Jhe world faces
with the bomb.
The Bikini un
dertaking will

serve to show us how we must
prepare our military forces for the
future. It is an intelligent ap
proach to the problem of the
bomb; limited experience with its
effects demands another test."
The importance of the atom
bomb tests has been over-empha
sized, according to the belief of
Prof. Charles Fairman, executive
head of the Political Science De
partment.
"THE GREAT CONTROL prob
lem remains, as it was before the
atom bomb was contrived, to erect
a system of world government
wherein men can achieve justice,
peace, and the means of living a
reasonably satisfactory life.
"Mr. Roosevelt spoke of this ob
jective as the Four Freedoms. The
United Nations marks a tremen
dous advance in this direction and
no doubt contains within itself
the means of further improve
ments. the need for which will
from time to time become mani
fest. The great task is to make
that system work effectively by
the determination and good will
of people everywhere.
"The significance of the atom
bomb, it seems to me. is that it
gives dramatic expression to the
need for making effective this
government of the international
order. It well may be that an
other world conflict would be, not
just tragically destructive, but
positively the end of civilization
as we know it.
"PERHAPS DEFENSIVE meas
ures could be contrived, as in the
case of gunpowder, the ironclad,
the submarine, and aerial bom
bardment. Perhaps we could squeak
through another war even with
atomic bombing. This is a techni
cal question on which I have no
opinion.
"But whether another struggle
would be destructive beyond man's
recuperative power, or only some
what worse than the war just
closed, we should in any case re
solve so to use our wits and our
will as to achieve in our time a
rational ordering of the problems
of this world.
"Therefore, I keep my eve<
fixed on the progress of the United
Nations organization, whatever
goes on at Bikini
A REVIEW OF NAVY plum
and expectations at the Bikini

operation is outlined by Capt.
Charles E. Crombe, Jr., head of
the Navy Training Schools at
Stanford.

"The purpose
of the Bikini
tests, mightiest
dra m a since
the surrender
of Japan, is
simple and log
ical. A great
deal of knowl
edge about the
atom bomb's
power and

characteristics has been assem
bled but much remains to be dis
covered. The bomb which will be
used in each test is the standard
type used at Nagasaki and is the
best type we have available.
"The official Navy estimate as
to the cost of the experiment
places the loss at not more than
the cost of a single large, new
ship. The sacrifice of the ships
now will pay for information
about the bombs which may save
lives and dollars in the future.
'"None may say what the ulti
mate lessons of the Bikini tests
will be. It is inevitable that the
public interest should focus on
some aspects of the test, the num
ber of ships which will be sunk,
for instance. The size of the fleet
going to the bottom will not tell
the whole story or even provide
the true measurement of the
bomb.
"IN THE FIRST TEST 77 ships
will be concentrated in an area
considerably smaller than that
which a fleet of similar size would
use under normal conditions.
Many of the heavier units will be
concentrated in the immediate vi
cinity of "the bull's eye."
'The real problem is not to de
termine the number of vessels
sunk; rather it is to find out the
degree of damage that different
types of naval and merchant ships
will suffer at varying distances
from the point of detonation. This
detailed knowledge will provide
the Navy with the basis for pos
sible required changes in ship de
sign, tactical formations at sea,
anchoring distances in port, num
ber and location of operating
bases and repair yards, and the
strategic disposition of ships.
"SHIPS WILL BE SUBJECTED,
depending on nearness of the
burst as to degree, to the follow
ing effects: air blast tending to
crush above-water structure; in
tense heat affecting ship's struc
ture; radioactivity; high waves
endangering the safety of the ship:
underwater shock tending to loos
en equipment attached to ships:

and underwater pressure tending
to rupture the hulls.
Hope for unbiased and objective
reporting of the results of the tests
is expressed by Prof. Paul H.
Kirkpatriek, chairman of the
Physics Department.
"Personally, I feel it is impor
tant that competent government
observers be on hand at the Bi
kini tests so that an adequate, un
biased report will be presented to
the President, independent of the
channel of the Navy report. At a
time when the future of the Navy
as an independent unit is hanging
fire in Congress an absolutely un
biased report is desirable."
