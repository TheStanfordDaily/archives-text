AGAIN THE TOWER
For a number of years when life has seemed low for Stanford
Daily editors they have aimed at that perpetual editorial target,
the Ivory Tower.
Upon their beer-drinking, sun-tanning contemporaries, who
saw little of the world outside the Dinah's-Mora's-Rosotti's tri
angle, the campus Greeleys poured their wrath.
That the apathy existed cannot be denied, but it was such an
accurate reflection of the greater apathy which existed in the
outside world that the pleas of the Daily lined many a garbage
can and very few heads.
Once more a Daily editor is taking a potshot at the Tower.
Sadly, it is with no strong conviction that either the views of the
students or of the world of which they are the younger hope
have materially changed. We still have with us the head-in
the-sand understanding with which Stanford groups before 1941
approached world affairs.
Omaha Beach or Tarawa may be mockeries already, but it is
reasonable to hope that even two, three, or four years have not
completely erased their significance.
On Monday some fellow human beings are going to play
around with something which it is worth the reader's time to
consider. It is hard to place this action very well on the scale of
human actions. It probably isn't stupid, but it certainly repre
sents nothing more than a blind groping in the handling of a
.force which should be the concern of everyone, right down to
and including you.
The writer has only lived 23 years and therefore wouldn't at
tempt to impose his opinions about the atom bomb upon any
one. However, the Daily has asked certain people on the
campus whom it feels have something to say about this Bikini
Atoll experiment to use this page to express their views.
This is a simple, pleading reguest. Read this page and do
some thinking about it.
For living in even an Ivory Tower implies that somewhere,
far below, one is connected to the earth, and that if some force
were found which could collapse foundations the Ivory Tower
would have to tumble.
