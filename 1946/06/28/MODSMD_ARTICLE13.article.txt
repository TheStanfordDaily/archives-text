## Bull Session 
### 
Normally it is the function of
the Bull Sessioner to attempt to
be amusing and clever, never pon
derous. Today we shall deviate
from what we hope is the humor
ous norm, and assume an editorial
attitude.
If you don't want to be preached
to read no further.
Elsewhere on this page today
are the opinions of some of the
best brains in the country on the
atom bomb and what it means,
and how it affects our very exist
ence.
THESE MEN have very kindly
given us their opinions and I
hope, like the idea expressed by
ihe Daily editor, that students and
other readers will consider them
and formulate additional opinions
of their own.
It is further hoped that readers
will closely scrutinize the flood of
news material that is to evolve
from the first and subsequent Bi
kini tests.
Thus far press reports from Bi
<ini have been singularly disap
pointing. It seems to us that a
majority of correspondents have
tak'.'ti the trip to be just another
junket."
This is probably due, in part, to
he strict censorship imposed by
he Army and Navy. We under
stand further that if some of the
service brass had its way there
would be no press representation
it Bikini.
THERE HAS BEEN sniggering
oo over the caliber of the press
representation at Bikini. That
Jharm Magazine and Ace Comic.-

have representatives on hand is
cause for laughter.
I don't think it is that funny.
The two magazines have readers,
and if their representatives can
bring home to the variegated read
ership one-twentieth of the sig
nificance of atom energy the Bi
kini trip and test will not have
been in vain.
I hope, not for the sake of the
press but for the sake of human
ity, that those in charge of Opera
tion Crossroads will allow the
press the widest latitude in re
porting Bikini—both in words and
pictures.
If this is done perhaps a dent
will be made in humanity's great
est enemy—apathy.
