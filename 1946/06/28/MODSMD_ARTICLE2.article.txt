# Books, Supplies Monopoly Charged
## 
### JOHN TURNBLAD 
Against a background of a threat
ening national textbook shortage,
a Palo Alto bookstore yesterday
charged it was being "driven out of
business" by a "monopoly" policy
adopted by Stanford to govern pur
chase of textbooks and equipment
by G.I. students under the G.I. Bill.
HERBERT BELL. owner of the
College Book Shop, 408 University
Avenue, charged a University pol
icy requiring veterans to clear any
book purchases through (he Stan
ford Bookstore was in effect creat
ing a monopoly which would cut
the veterans off from a a supply of
used texts whose low prices could
greatly cut the expenses of their
education.
University officials told the Daily

that Stanford's 2,000-odd student
veterans may now buy books, equip
ment and supplies by three meth
ods:
1. Filling out a special Stanford
Bookstore form and presenting a
veteran's identification card.
2. Obtaining a special requisition
form from the Stanford Bookstore
which, when signed by a book sell
er, entitles the veteran to be paid
back for items purchased off cam
pus. The G.I. pays cash to the off
campus store, and is later paid back
by the Stanford store which gets
credit for the sale.
3. If the special requisition is not
signed, veterans will be paid back
by the Stanford Bookstore upon
presentation of either a sales re
ceipt or the item purchased. But the
item must be authorized by the

Stanford Bookstore.
STANFORD BOOKSTORE man
ager, Miss Helena Bouchou, admit
ted this meant the veteran would
go to Palo Alto for his supplies only
it the Stanford Bookstore cannot fill
his needs.
Although there is no actual rule
he must purchase books on campus,
the fact that a veteran must first
check in with the Stanford Book
store cuts off a considerable per
centage of trade which might oth
erwise go downtown. Bell charged.
"ALL WE WANT Ls to have the
same forms available here in Palo
Alto as are available on the cam
pus so that the veteran has complete
freedom of choice for his buying,"
Bell said.
Answering statements by Univer
sity officials that the system pre

vented off-campus stores from sell
ing supplies to veterans at exorbi
tant rates, Bell said. "We have no
plush bindings or high-priced sup
plies."
Hi: POINTED OUT that he knows
what books are authorized, and that
his inventory is made up ot text
books required by Stanford profes
sors, from a list provided by them
Before this summer, veteran stu
dents could go to downstown book -
stores after receiving a requisition
from the Dean of Students' office.
As many books as were needed
could be bought on one requisition
UNDER THE NEW SYSTEM, the
veteran must fill out a single slip
for each purchase.
According to Bell, a survey by
the College Textbook Exchange, a
national group, revealed Stanford
is the only school which does not
allow the veteran complete free
dom of choice in selection of book
stores, except at the University of
Washington where there is no com
petitor to the campus store.
HOWEVER. STANFORD'S Chie£
Accounting Officer, Duncan F. Mc»
Fadden, claimed that at other West
ern universities students are re
quired to buy books from certain
stores designated by the university
He said the University of Califor
nia, because of its large student en
rollment, had named four book
shops to handle all veterans' sup
plies.
George D. Barahal, University
Veterans' Co-ordinator, declared
that Stanford has one of the sim
plest book-buying systems of any
college in the country.
"IT IS OUR DESIRE to protect
the veteran in every way possible."
said Mr. Barahal. "Consequently
we must exercise some control ove
his purchases."
He explained that the Veterans
Administration must approve a
purchases. If an item is disallowed.,
the University or the veteran hinv
self must make good the cost.
THE STANFORD BOOKSTORE,
because it is a student co-operative
and on campus, is kept informed by
the Administration of purchases
currently authorized by the Veter
ans Administration. Requisitions fo.
books from outside sources must
have prior approval so that no un -
authorized items are bought.
The Veterans' Co-ordinator as
serted that sudents under the G.E.
plan are free to buy books and sup
plies wherever they choose.
MR. McFADDEN SAID the pres
ent book-buying system is
tried on an experimental basis dur
ing the current quarter. If it proves
successful after any troublesome
features are eliminated, it will be
adopted for all quarteors.
Meanwhile at Stanford a short*
age of textbooks for fall quarteT
was foreseen at the Stanford Book -
store. A shortage of paper through
out the nation and the impossi
bility of accurate estimation of fail
quarter enrollment will make if
necessary for some G.l.'s to go o-t 1 -
campus for their books.
