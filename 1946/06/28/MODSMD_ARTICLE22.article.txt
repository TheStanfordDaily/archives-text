To one whose last previous memories of Stanford sports goes
back to 1940-41, when what we than called the "Wow Boys"
walloped Nebraska in the Rose Bowl and a fighting basketball
qtiintet copped the conference southern division cage crown,
the low standing of this year's basketball, track, and baseball
aggregations was quite a comedown.
The big trouble seems to be that, with many more applicants
than Stanford can handle, scholastic entrance standards have
necessarily been raised. This results in the turning away of a
lot of prospective sports stars, whose grades are up to pre
war requirements, but not good enough to get them into school
now.
All but one of the Stanford's competitiors in Pacific Coast
Conference competition are state institutions, and therefore
not faced by this problem. The exception does not have this
difficulty because it is located in a large city, hence need not
provide housing for all its students. Besides, the exception re
ferred to is USC â€”nuff sed!
All of this adds up to the distinct possibility that Stanford
teams will suffer for four or five years in comparison with
their opponents because of relative lack of material.
The one really bright aspect of the situation, that looks as
though it might overbalance the difficulties and enable Card
inal squads to kick over a row of dope buckets is the superb
coaching staff that will guide the teams.
