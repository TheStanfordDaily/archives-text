## 
### 
Stanford has been presented with
a certificate of appreciation by the
Navy Department for its participa
tion in the V-12 program.
The Chief of Naval Personnel, in
a letter announcing the award, de
clared, "The Navy's wartime officer
training program is now drawing to
a close. Let me assure you that the
Navy genuinely regrets the termi
nation of the V-12 Unit, Stanford
University, but looks forward to a
long and productive association in
the operation of the Naval Reserve
Officer Training Corps.
"It gives me real pleasure to pre
sent Stanford University with this
certificate as a tangible sign of the
Navy's appreciation for the Univer
sity's services. Now that your share
in the work is completed, I should
like to add just one thing more, the
Navy's traditional phase of approv
al, a hearty 'well done'."
