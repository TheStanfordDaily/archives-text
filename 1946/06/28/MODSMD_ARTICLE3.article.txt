ATOM BOMB SCIENTISTS Felix Bloch and Hans Stauh of the Stanford Physics Department examine
the 27 ;l 4-inch cyclotron in the basement of the Physics Building. The cyclotron, built by the two scientists in
1941, was later used as an instrument in the development of the atom bomb. Prof. Bloch is looking at the
diffusion pump at the left and Prof. Staub examines the transmission line on the right. (The atom bomb will
be tested Monday at Bikini atoll. For a discussion of the test, see today's Daily symposium on page 2.)
