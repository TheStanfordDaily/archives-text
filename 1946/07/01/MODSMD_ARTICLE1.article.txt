Congress finally put the OPA
bill through last week, President
Truman vetoed it, and the OPA
is now as dead as statistics. The
Democratic leaders in Congress,
Rayburn and Barkley, had as
sured their colleagues that the
President would approve it. Tru
man threw it hack as unworkable
and requested a temporary ex
tension of the existing law until
improvements could be devised.

If these were
presidential tac
tics to buffalo
Congress into
extending the
present law
without amend
ments, it can be
justified only as
a desperate ac
tion in a des
perate situation.

If the President was actually un
able to make up his mind till the
last moment, then his weakness is
obvious, and the Republicans can
say, "We told you so!"
Regular Congressional proce
dure can hold up the temporary
extension bill until the end of the
week. If Senator O'Daniel chooses
to take up his filibuster where he
dropped it last week, it can be
held up longer than that.
The great question is, how fast
and how far will prices rise? I
have no idea. Governors are look
ing into their emergency powers;
business groups are asking their
members to restrain themselves.
But this morning there is nothing to
stop anyone from raising his or her
price for anything to any point.

The Foreign Ministers of the
Big Four, whose meetings in
Paris continue, are still dead
locked on most of the major is
sues. Saturday, Byrnes demand
ed that a date be set for the gen
eral peace conference. It wasn't.
That matter, along with the oth
ers, will be taken up today again.
Agreement is expected, but on
what, I couldn't say.

I. personally, doubt if the OPA
will be revived. Or, at least, it de
pends on what happens in these
few days with the law off. Speak
ing figuratively, if the volcano
doesn't blow its top off, people are
not going to worry about it. even if
the hot lava keeps oozing out. Some
people will get burned, but, if that
modicum of common sense that
democratic theory insists the people
have keeps things steady for a few
days, OPA will stay dead.
