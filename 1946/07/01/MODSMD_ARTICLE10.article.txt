# Whew!!!--- Bomb Falls
## Chain Reaction Day Doesn't Faze Equilibrium of Stanford Ivory Tower 
### GEORGE L. MOORE 
As a metronome on a red-painted battleship in the southwest
Pacific ticked away the seconds leading to H -hour of Able Day
of Operation Crossroads, the Stanford Ivory Tower maintained
its equilibrium with no apparent strain.
Even when atomic bomb "Gilda" exploded at about 2 p.m.
Pacific time yesterday, no vestige of a chain reaction reached
Stanford's Coast Range campus.

At the Daily's remote pickup+
point of the broadcast from Bikini
at the Rossotti Acres, nine staff
members kept vigil for over an hour
listening to correspondents describ
ing the activity in the mid-ocean
lagoon, climaxing in the words of
the bombardier, Major Harold P.
Wood, "Bomb away." All voices
over the radio were then stilled as
through the crackling of atmos
pheric interference the metronome
ticked.
SOMETIME DURING the next j
five minutes the bomb exploded,
but none of the nine listeners at '
Rossotti's could say for sure that i
they had heard the momentous ex- j
plosion. A correspondent then in- i
formed those listening that a gigan
tic cloud, like those at Nagasaki, j
Hiroshima and Los Alamos, arose |
from the heart of the explosion and
attained a height of 60,000 feet, vis
ible on Kwajalein Island 210 miles
distant.
One reason why the sound of
the explosion, described as whin- j
ing at first, was not picked up by
the open microphone aboard the
target ship, Nevada, might have j
been that the microphone was de
stroyed before the sound waves
reached it. Later reports heard from
Bikini said that the Nevada was
still afloat.
A STANFORD professor, Dr. â– 
Hugh H. Skilling, executive head
of the Electrical Engineering De- ;
partment, was one of 20 civilian sci
entists invited to witness the atomic
bomb tests. He is interested in the
effects of the operation because of
the possible future development of
atomic energy in connection with
electric power generation.
But Stanford seemed to take
"Chain Reaction Day" in its stride
though estimates were made as to
how high the tidal wave set up by
the explosion would be as it swept
over the hills and over the campus.
A few even had on dark glasses
ostensibly to protect their eyes from
the glare of the detonation should it
reach here.
JUST BEFORE the explosion oc
curred. as the Daily representatives
were shaking hands all around and
toasting the possible end of the
world in clear brew, a few more j
Stanford students came up to the
radio and inquired what was hap
pening. They were told.
Returning to the campus, more
students out for a hike, playing golf
and riding bicycles were seen, re
assuring the Farm journalists that j
Stanford had once again emerged I
unscathed from a historical and sci- |
entific juncture. Even the Hoover
tower appeared undisutrbed by dis
tant radioactivity.
The Daily is proud to be able to
say: "The atomic bomb has gone
off but the world is still here. Well j
done. God."
