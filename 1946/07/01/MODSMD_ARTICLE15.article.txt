SUMMER EXCOM
For the uninitiated the Daily points out the Excom meetings
are open to any student for purposes of listening or beeting. In
past years some of the most effective action on the part of Stan
ford's student government has stemmed from students personal
appeal to Excom.
There is no closed corporation running the student govern
ment. If to a returned veteran or a new frosh the workings of
Excom seem unimportant, remember that this body is the only
one through which students can exert an effective influence
on the problems of their University. One good idea backed up
by facts and well presented to Excom is worth a hundred gripes
behind the scenes.
Here are some of the things the Daily feels Summer Excom
could profitably have on its mind at tomorrow night's meeting:
The appointment of a student committee to make plans for
incorporating student residents of Dibble hospital into the stu
dent body, including a plan for their representation on Excom.
Plans should also be laid for student self-government at Dibble.
This committee should inform the administration of its existence
and readiness to serve.
Methods by which the golf team may be reimbursed for
their expenses to the NCAA championship, which they won as
individuals, not as representatives of Stanford. If the funds
cannot come from the University, some sort of a benefit could
be worked out to give the boys back at least part of that 5425
each.
As a shot-in-the-arm for a summer guarter social program,
the Daily has already suggested that the Nitery be equipped
for coke dates and dancing.
If old timers smile at this belief of the Daily that Excom
can be a potent moving force around here, they should re
member that the apathy on the part of the student body sym
bolized by those very smiles is the reason Excom is sometimes
anemic.
