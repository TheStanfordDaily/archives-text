The President
Lagunita Court
Dear Madame:
Your open house Friday night
was one of the greatest things
since Marbury v. Madison and the
Gold Rush. Never have I seen
nuggets so eagerly panned for.
But why don't you get more nug
gets?
The music, with the exception
of the Lagunita theme song, "Put
That Ring on My Finger," was
excellent; the lighting sufficiently
in contrast and the ice cream, es
pecially the peach, was good. May
I suggest, though, that in the fu
ture you let men serve it thereby
releasing more women for com
bat?
The hostesses, with one excep
tion, were helpful and eager. The
exception just wasn't eager for
me, I found out.
I understand that Lagunita, even
drunk with power as it is, is plan
ning more affairs, including a hay
ride. If so, are you taking reser
vations in advance? The South
Palo Alto and Branner Annex of
the Hay Rasslers Society of Cali
fornia, Local 6, is vitally inter
ested. Please have the hay fever
proof, though.
The comments I heard wei'e all
favorable. Most succinct was that
of a gent who, asked what he
thought of the party, said it was
like what the dog said when he
sat down on the sandpaper —
"Rough!"
Your party was educational, too.
One young man found out. to his
utter amazement (he hasn't been
reconverted yet), that Hershey
bars aren't worth a darn over here.
Cordially,
Bull Sessioner
