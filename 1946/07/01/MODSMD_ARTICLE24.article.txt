Too little and too late. Democracy in action demands that the people
of the United States let their elected representatives know how they feel
on certain issues. Just as we were caught on December 7, 1941, with our
lines extended and no backing, so were the American people caught yes
terday when the Congress and the President of the United States ganged
up to kill the OPA.
Immediately after the news of the President's veto was issued, news
papers, radio stations, and other information agencies in the Bay Area
were swamped with calls from the people directly affected demanding
information as to who their representatives were, and how they could
be reached.
The trickle of letters that came into congressional halls during the
siege on OPA which represented the feelings of the people who would
have to pay the price of inflation was not nearly enough to offset the
tremendous amount of ballyhoo thrown out by the NAM and similar
lobbying agencies. If Congress had been warned soon enough of the
temper of the American people, inflation might have been avoided.
