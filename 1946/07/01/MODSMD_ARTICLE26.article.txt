Congratulations arc in oVder for
the golf team who went back east
on their own and won the nationals.
We wonder if they come back to
legister for summer quarter wheth
er they will be required to pay the
fee for late registration.
If it should turn out that they do
return, we believe that exception
should he taken and the additional
payment be waived.
Our congratulations also go to
Stanford's swimming star, Bob An
des;-on, who was the only Far West
erner to be selected on the Ail-
American swimming team.
Where are all those skeptics of
not too many months ago who said
M would be several years before'
Stanford would produce a team in
any sport of national ranking? It's
cn'y six months ago that the In- !
dians returned to intercollegiate
competition, and we already have a !
national championship.
Coach Eddie Twiggs can well be |
proud of the team he helped pro
duce as golf coach.
Another event of the weekend of |
inteiest to Stanford students was '
the victory of Johnny Fid ton, for- I
mei Card star, in the 800-meter |
race at the AAU meet in San An
tonio.
