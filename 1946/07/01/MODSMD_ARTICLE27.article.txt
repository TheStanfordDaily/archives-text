# Firehouse Enters Loop
## 
### 
One more outfit has joined the
intramural softball league for this
summer since the last edition. Ad
dition of the Firehouse raises the
list to five. Other teams entered are
Sigma Nu, Chi Psi, Encina oE. and
Branner 1.
Due to the limited number of
teams signing up, the deadline for
intramural signup has been ex
tended until Wednesday evening.
The schedule will then be made out
and will be published in next Mon
day's paper. The first game will be
played a week from Tuesday.
Games will start at 4:30 each-
Tuesday and Thursday evening.
Umpires are badly needed.
