# New Psychology Problems Told
## McFarlane Speaks At Meeting Here 
### 
Increasing awareness of the high
incidence of psychiatric disorder in
America has created new opportu
nities and new problems for clinical
psychologists, according to Dr. Jean
McFarlane, president of the West
ern Psychological Association. These
new problems were discussed by
her at the association's meeting
here Friday night.
Dr. McFarlane quoted statistics to
show the magnitude of the prob
lems which face clinical psycholo
gists. Six per cent of the total pop
ulation will be patients in mental
hospitals before the age of 50. One
million veterans will at some time
need mental treatment, and the ra
tio of mental disease to other illness
among veterans will be four to one.
To meet this problem the Veterans
Administration has called for the
immediate training of 1,000 clinical
psychologists.
DR. MCFARLANE FEARS that
the attraction of the more able sci
entists to clinical work will injure
activity in basic research. She feels
also that present teaching facilities
are inadequate to meet the increased
demand for new students. She calls
an teachers to take on no more than
they can do well.
Besides this demand for more
clinical psychologists, there is also
desired a new type of clinical psy
chologist, with added responsibility,
fn New York some psychologists are
now doing work in the minor
psychoneurose and in personality
disorders, leaving to the psychiatrist
the neurological cases and cases in
which there is somatic involvement.
Formerly they had been concerned
mainly with testing and the deter
mination of ability.
THESE NEW responsibilities call
for a revision in training methods.
Dr. McFarlane thinks psychology
students should avoid early speciali
zation and that they should have a
broad background in functional bi
ology and sociology. She feels the
need to establish minimum stand
ards in general, in clinical psychol
ogy courses and in teaching meth
ods.
