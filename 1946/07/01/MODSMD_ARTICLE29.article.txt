Musicians and vocalists for a pop
ular orchestra and musicians for
an orchestra to play semi-classical
music are still needed, according to
Joyce Stallfort who is organizing
the orchestras for the Stanford Mu
sic Council.
Anyone wishing to try out at an
audition Tuesday at 7 p.m. at the
Art Gallery is asked to contact Miss
Stallfort at Lagunita and leave his
name and phone number.
If a sufficient number is obtained
rehearsals will begin immediately
for engagements to be filled this
summer and next fall quarter.
