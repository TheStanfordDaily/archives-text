# Dibble Officially Closed Yesterday
## 
### 
Dibble General Hospital officially
closed yesterday, but it is expected
that actual closing and deactivation
will not be complete for another
month.
It is expected that by Aug. 1 the
100 or more buildings will be turned
over to the Federal Public Housing
Administration and leased to Stan
ford as quarters for veteran stu
dents.
The only job remaining now is
the disposition of about a million
dollars' worth of equipment and
the closing out of the books. Col.
Paul H. Streit, commanding officer
of Dibble, says that if this is ac
complished by Aug. 1 it will be a
new speed record for the closing of
a large hospital.
Much of the property, such as
beds, tables, and chairs, will be left
for use by. Stanford. Medical equip
ment is being forwarded to other
hospitals, including the Veterans
Administration Hospital in Palo
Alto.
