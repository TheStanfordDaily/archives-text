The end of OPA has produced
some concrete results. Forced by
the end of subsidies and eager to
cash in on "free-market" prices,
farmers are pouring wheat, corn,
hogs and cattle into the market.
Some prices have already slumped
a little, hut not hack to OPA ceil
ings. Manufacturers, not so af
fected by subsidies and still sub
ject to some priority control, have
been more cautious.
It may also be that corporations J
are just a little more cautious than j
individuals. It has been estimated
that a general rise in prices of 20
per cent may be expected, which, if
Congress fails to act soon, will re
sult in an increased flow of durable
goods. Large stocks of these have
been warehoused, waiting for high- !
er prices.
That there will be a distinct rise
in prices is not to be doubted. How
this will affect the University, 1
whilch—Administration, faculty, and
students —is distinctly in the fixed- i
income group, is not known. But
the best cure for an inflation is an
increased supply of goods of all
sorts, and, if this increased supply is :
the result of the Congressional ob
stinacy that killed the OPA, then
representative government has jus
tified itself. And, bluntly, if we get
no more goods, only higher prices,
it hasn't.
The Democratic primary in I
Mississippi, which, as we all know, ,
is the real election in those parts,
went off quietly yesterday. Some
Negroes voted without interfer
ence. and early returns showed |
Senator Bilbo leading in his try
for re-election. The elections
were quiet, that is, except for Rep.
Rankin, also a candidate. He
"clawed and scratched" a photog
rapher who had snapped his pic
ture.
It is one of the greatest tributes
that could be paid to American de
mocracy that the rest of the coun
try hasn't finished the War between
the States by conducting extensive ;
mopping-up operations to include
Bilbo and Rankin.
Senator Vandenberg announced
in Paris yesterday that the For
eign Ministers had agreed "in
principle" to the internationaliza
tion of Trieste, along the lines of
the French compromise plan. Re
maining question is in whom the
control shall be vested, the U.N.
or the Big Four. The U.S. wants
U.N. control; Russia wants the
Big Four.
This development justifies Secre
tary Byrnes' long - standing opti
mism. I should have realized that
even Molotov must clear all deci
sions through Moscow, and act
stubborn until they do clear.

The end of OPA has produced
some concrete results. Forced by
the end of subsidies and eager to
cash in on "free-market" prices,
farmers are pouring wheat, corn,
hogs and cattle into the market.
Some prices have already slumped
a little, hut not hack to OPA ceil
ings. Manufacturers, not so af
fected by subsidies and still sub
ject to some priority control, have
been more cautious.
It may also be that corporations J
are just a little more cautious than j
individuals. It has been estimated
that a general rise in prices of 20
per cent may be expected, which, if
Congress fails to act soon, will re
sult in an increased flow of durable
goods. Large stocks of these have
been warehoused, waiting for high- !
er prices.
That there will be a distinct rise
in prices is not to be doubted. How
this will affect the University, 1
whilch—Administration, faculty, and
students —is distinctly in the fixed- i
income group, is not known. But
the best cure for an inflation is an
increased supply of goods of all
sorts, and, if this increased supply is :
the result of the Congressional ob
stinacy that killed the OPA, then
representative government has jus
tified itself. And, bluntly, if we get
no more goods, only higher prices,
it hasn't.
The Democratic primary in I
Mississippi, which, as we all know, ,
is the real election in those parts,
went off quietly yesterday. Some
Negroes voted without interfer
ence. and early returns showed |
Senator Bilbo leading in his try
for re-election. The elections
were quiet, that is, except for Rep.
Rankin, also a candidate. He
"clawed and scratched" a photog
rapher who had snapped his pic
ture.
It is one of the greatest tributes
that could be paid to American de
mocracy that the rest of the coun
try hasn't finished the War between
the States by conducting extensive ;
mopping-up operations to include
Bilbo and Rankin.
Senator Vandenberg announced
in Paris yesterday that the For
eign Ministers had agreed "in
principle" to the internationaliza
tion of Trieste, along the lines of
the French compromise plan. Re
maining question is in whom the
control shall be vested, the U.N.
or the Big Four. The U.S. wants
U.N. control; Russia wants the
Big Four.
This development justifies Secre
tary Byrnes' long - standing opti
