# 'Not Too Late' Says Hayek

### 
Pleading for an intellectual awak
j ening to the fundamentals of lib—
I eralism, Friedrich A. Hayek told a
Tuesday Series audience in Memo
j rial Hall auditorium last night that
I"it is not too late to build a society
i in which individual liberty is pre
! served."
The acting professor of economics
from the University of London con
j trasted oft-confused theories of lib
eralism and socialism in his talk on
| "The Prospects of Freedom."
IN SPEAKING OF SOCIALISM
he emphasized the role of "plan
| ners" in restricting liberty and sub
; stituting security for freedom. In
attempting to present the funda
mentals of "reaP liberalism. Pro
fessor Hayek cited the principles of
1 the Whig tradition and Federalist
Papers.
Presenting the feeling that intel
lectual thought is moving toward a
fatalistic acceptance of the omnipo
tent state, Professor Hayek stated.
I "So long as we are willing to learn
i there is no need to be driven to a
| fate we don't wish."
THE AUSTRIA-BORN professor
decried intellectual apathy in meet
ing the totalitarian idea and "mak
ing the philosophy of freedom live
| and grow."
"There has been little thinking
lately in the last decades because
> freedom seemed to have been
I achieved, but now we may have
| lost it,"he said.
Emphasizing that the task before
! modern thinkers is to propose an
: alternative program to the totali
tarian theory. Professor Hayek
asked for an international effort.
"THOSE STILL ENJOYING lib
erty do not best understand its
force. Others have learned the les
sons we have not understood but
mnst now learn from them. In
countries only recently our enemies
are men who are working on this
awakening to freedom; we can ill
afford to overlook them."
Terming as "alarming" the tend
-1 enc:y in America to write off the rest
! of the world as hopeless and con -
centrate on the preservation of
Western civilization in the United
States. Professor Hayek called for a
world-wide counter-totalitarian 01-
| ganization.
THE FORM WOULD BE a com
i bination of learned society and po
litical organization. An effort would
; be made to avoid short-run politics
! and concentrate on general prin-
I ciples of liberal law.
Profssor Hayek suggested calling
his organization "An International
Academy of Political Philosophers"
and described its possible member
j ship as "men who have learned that
political liberty is the extreme
good."
THE PROFESSOR, author of the
recent book, "The Road to Serf
dom." left no doubt in his listeners'
minds of his concept that current
I "leftist" thought is not true liber
alism.
His assertion that the "Federalist
Papers" represent true liberalism
contrasts sharply with American
political thought which considers
! the doctrines of Hamilton conserva
| tive as against Jeffersonian libcr
j alism.
True liberalism has other inter-
I pretations than that of Professor
Hayek.—Huiglit
