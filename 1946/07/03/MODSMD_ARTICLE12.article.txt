DIBBLE KICKOFF
Excom last night appointed a student coordinator as the first
step in a program to prepare for student occupation of Dibble
Hospital next fall.
If the program works as Excom hopes a blueprint will be
ready for use fall quarter outlining the duties of student govern
ment officials at Dibble and the connection between them and
Excom as the top authority.
It seems to the Daily the fundamental question which this new
student committee should ask as it examines each step is, "Will
this plan tend to separate or join the life of the Dibble and campus
residents?" Any program should be scrapped which might lead
the Dibble group into actions uncontrolled by established student
government or split their interests off from the main body of
Stanford interests.
Any outlook on the part of student or administrator which
regards the Dibble group as "veterans" rather than regular Stan
ford students should be repaired. It will be tough enough for
single students to adapt to the semi-barracks life at Dibble with
out making them feel like the step-children of the University.
Excom has chosen to head this organizing committee the man
who created the Stanford War Board and helped to make it one
of the most successful instances of student self-government in
Stanford history. The problem he faces now is equally as serious
and will demand equal talent.
A committee cannot do it all. Each leader of an activity group
on the campus should begin to plan for the time when his group
must weave the Dibble residents into their particular activity.
Ram's Head, the Daily, Quad, and Chappie, Chapel Board, and
the Block and Circle S societies, to mention only a few, will prob
ably be called upon the extend their activity to the Dibble area.
Thinking in the summer will put them a few jumps ahead in
the fall when Stanford suddenly finds itself jammed to the hilt.


NO RATIO in Hollywood with
bevies of stuff like this here
around. As a Daily community
service, we publish this for the
men who are suffering from the
present social drought at Stan
ford.
