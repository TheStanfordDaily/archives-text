# Occupation of Germany Must Continue--Heffner
## 
### CARL HEINTZE 
"It is very important for the United States to maintain the
military occupation of Germany indefinitely, but it is equally
important that there be an adequate program of education for
the American Army of Occupation."

This is the opinion of Dr. Hu
bert Heffner, professor of dra
matic literature, who returned last
week from a year's service in Eu
rope with the U.S. Army's Infor
mation and Education Division to
his duties as executive head of
the Speech and Drama Depart
ment.
I)lt. HEFFNER, who was one of
the organizers of the American
University Center at Biarritz,
France, and chief of its Fine Arts
section, gave high praise to sol
dier students. "They were the best
students I have ever had," he
said. "Most were former combat
troops and were mentally from 7
to 10 years older than compar
able civilian students."
"They came to Biarritz know
ing what they wanted to take, and
they kept strictly to business. In
eight weeks of intensive work
they did more work than is nor
mally covered in a college se
mester.
"The American University Cen
ter at Biarritz was a signally suc
cessful experiment, and Biarritz,
itself, was the one bright spot in
Franco - American relations," Dr.
Heffner said.
AFTER THE TERMINATION of
the university in March, 1946, Dr.
Heffner worked with the Army
Special Service Division, first giv
ing a series of lectures on the
theater to soldier audiences, and
then organizing two road compa
nies which toured the principal
cities of Germany and Austria pre
senting "Richard III" and Noel
Coward's "Hay Fever" to Ameri
can troops.
He spent the last months of his
>tay in Europe lecturing in Paris
Â»t the Sorbonne and the Conser
vatoire on "The American Thea
er" and organizing an Arts and
Crafts Workshop for the Ameri
can Red Cross with Miss Helen
Groen, former instructor in make
up .it Stanford.
