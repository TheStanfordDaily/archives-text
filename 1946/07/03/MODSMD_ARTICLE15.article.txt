## Bull Session 
### 
Today we want to apologize to
a couple of ardent tony men whom
we had to brush oft' late last quar
ter at a lower El Camino Real bis
tro.
Perched precariously on bar
stools, the two smiled winningly.
though lopsidedly, and one said.
"You're in my econ class, aren't
you?"
Says I. elbowing my way to the
bar. ''Am I?"
Says he. "Sure, you sit with Joe
Whosis. a fraternity brother of
mine. We're Phi Kappa Sigmas.
You've heard of us."
Says I. "No. I haven't. Is it a
local
Says he. indignantly. "No. it
isn't."
The other focuses with difficulty
and says. "Well, you've heard of
the Phi Psi's."
I lie again: "Nope. They a local
too?"
The stools sway and the occu
pants peer into the empty glasses.
To fill in the conversational lull
I say. "Sorry, fellows, but I'm a
grad student and don't know much
about fraternities."
Amidst grumbling obscenities I
pick up my cokes (she's under
age) and leave the tongsters.
I'm sorry, men. but you made a
big mistake in talking too loudly
when I came to the bar. Thanks,
though, for warning me you were
about to touch me for $5.
As for fraternities: I hope C. F.
Williams of Phi Kappa Psi will
forgive me. And everybody knows
the Phi Sigs.
