A belief that small American lo
cal communities are important in
ordering our international life has
motivated the teaching career of
Dr. Boyd A. Martin, a visiting pro
fessor on the Farm this quarter.
No newcomer to Stanford, Mar
tin took both his Master's and his
Ph.D. in the Political Science De
partment, completing the work in
the spring of 1940.
WITH THE NECESSARY de
grees stuffed in his briefcase. Dr.
Martin returned to his home state
to teach at the University of
Idaho. There in Moscow—ldaho,
that is—he has been teaching and
studying world politics since he
left Stanford.
Dr. Martin is now viatlly inter
ested in the local governments of
America as a means to world
peace.
"When a surge of international
ism in the spirit of American pol
itics arises, we are too often likely
to discount the value of our local
governments as a part of that
spirit." Dr. Martin says.
'"As a possible key to the as
surance of the peace, it would be
well to remind ourselves that we
are a country made of small com
munities, communities of varied
interests and yet with a common
goal: international peace.
"WE SHOULD BE AWARE of
the influence each community has
upon the international policies of
our national government."
After summer quarter Dr. Mar
tin will return to the University
of Idaho and take up his perma
nent position on the teaching staff
there.
Idaho seems an ideal place to
live to Dr. Martin, and it was that
state's interest in civics that led
him into the study of politics. An
examination in civics is required
of all eighth-grade students and
it was that state examination that
first stirred up his interest in poli
cal science.
