The Editor, Sir:
Someone should have prepared
me for the shock.
When 1 came to Stanford I ex
pected to find human beings such
as myself, who aspired to high
things but often fell short of their.,
and who were continually having
to pick themselves up, clinch theii"
teeth and set out again.
Instead, I find that this is a cam
pus full of angels! Do you doub;
this? I had heard a great deal
about Stanford's Memorial Chap
el. It was world famed. Yet, what
do I find? The audience is pre
dominantly older people, with
here and there a Stanford stu
dent.
So I decide, truly this must lv
a campus full of angels who do
not find the need of a chapel serv
ice, who always do what they feel
they should and never find it nec
essary to question their adequacy
to meet whatever confronts them
These people must be either (T
those who feei completely inde
pendent and self-sufficient and see
no room for improvement In them
selves. or (2) those who are so
bound up in their little egocentric
lives and the improvement of theh
economic and social prestige that
they never give a thought to oth
ers or realize that causes do exist
which are greater than them
selves.
Don't tell me the Ivory Towel'
has a halo over it too?
