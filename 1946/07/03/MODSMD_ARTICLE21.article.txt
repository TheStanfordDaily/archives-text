# Veteran Book Row Simmers; Officials Reject Bell Plan
## 
### 
Chances that Stanford's student veterans will find more books
available for Fall quarter seemed brighter yesterday as Herbert
Bell, owner of the College Book Shop, offered to bear the cost of
all books sold to veterans which are disallowed by the Veterans'
Administration.

Bell, who charged the
sity Administration last week with
fostering a book and supply mo
nopoly. declared he was willing to
allow veterans to receive a refund
on unauthorized books if he could
use the same requisition system the |
Stanford Bookstore now uses.
IK ACCEPTED. Bell's plan will
enable veterans to purchase books
and supplies at either the Stanford
B 1 okstore or the College Book Shop
by merely signing for the required
books on a special form. The store
selling the books would then be
responsible for books not approved
by the Veterans Administration.
At present, veterans must first
obtain a special form at the Stan
ford Bookstore before buying books
from outside sources.
DUNCAN I. McFADDEN. Stan
ford's Chief Accounting Officer,
however, said the plan was unac
ceptable to the University. He de
clared the University was directly
responsible for supplying books ac
cording to Veterans Administration
instructions. In effect, he said, books
are bought by Stanford and given
to the veteran.
Mr. McFadden pointed out that it
will be two or three years before
govei nment accountants check vet
erans' accounts. It would be im
practical, he declared, for the Uni
versity to bill an outside bookstore
in the case of books found unau
thorized at that time. The Stanford
Bookstore, however, he said, will
remain as long as Stanford and can
be billed at any time.
