# New Housing Drive Starts
## 
### 
The University Administration
yesterday began an intensive tele
phone canvass of homes in Palo
Alto and the vicinity in an at
tempt to secure, living accommoda
tion listings for students and fac
ulty members.
Mrs. Ora Dale Gillette, who may
be reached at Palo Alto 9411. Ext.
213, has been assigned the job by
Business Manager Alf Brandin.
THE CANVASS was termed by
Dean of Students Stalnaker as "an
attempt to solve a problem that re
mains serious despite the Univer
sity's good fortune in getting Dib
ble Hospital."
Any living space found by Mrs.
Gillette will be turned over to the
Dean of Students' office for alloca
tion, the University release said.
At the same time Mr. Brandin
revealed that "only about 100 of an
ultimate total of 300 apartments at
Dibble are expected to be ready for
occupancy at the beginning of au
tumn quarter."
HE SAID THERE are already on
file applications from more than 700
married couples who require living
accommodations. Additional rooms
will also bo required for single stu
dents despite the fact that 2,400 will
be housed at Dibble and "many
more than normal" in University
dormitories.
Because of the increase in en
rollment there will be a larger fac
ulty and housing also will have to
be found for them, he said.
