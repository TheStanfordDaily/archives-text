# Stanford Grid Stock Shoots Up Two Points
## Ainslee Bell and Bill Gulley To Play on Indian Team 
### CECIL ROSPAW 
Stock of the edition of the
Stanford football squad, still an
unknown quantity in the Pacific
Coast Conference, jumped two
points higher this week with the
announcement that Ainslee Bell and
Bill Gulley would be in suit and
ready to go on September 28, when
the Indians meet Idaho here.
Bell is a former star athlete in
L.A. high school circles, and was a
member of U.S.C. football and bas
ketball squads before entering the
service. He is familiar with the
!T" style of play as employed by
ihe Trojans under Cravath, and wsis
Deing counted on to return there
,-.nd had been mentioned promi
nently in many of the southern
school's press releases.
GULLEY WAS A 194:5 transfer
from Santa Ana J.C., where he led
the Dons to a national championship
two years running. Unfamiliar with
the "T," he converted fast, and was
the top quarterback in Stanford's
.ast spring practice in 1943. The
Navy transferred him to Cal Tech
where Gulley starred on an unde
feated, high-scoring team in '43. He
was recently declared eligible for
. ne more year's competition and will
enroll in autumn quarter.
Reliable reports from the North
Country (Idaho, that is) tell us that
it will be a big mistake to sell the
Vandals short. Rumor has it that
many of the fellows who were
slated for the University of Wash
ington, and got pushed out in the
squeeze when living quarters be
came tight up there, packed up their
baes and took of! for greener (the
crinkly kind) pastures.
If this rumor is true, and it sounds
very plausible and comes from men
who should know, the first game on
Stanford's schedule should be just
as rough as the rest.
UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRAN
CISCO has just finished its spring
football practice. Poor "Clipper"
Smithâ€”he only had two tremen
dous lines, and he had so many ex
service stars in the backficld that
he couldn't work any combination
that could get them all in. His lines
averaged well over 200 lbs. from
end to end, and he almost cried as
he remembered how small one small
ISO-pounder looked in scrimmage.
"Clipper" had trouble remember
ing just how many touchdowns were
jcored in the final scrimmage, but
he finally compromised on an ap
proximate eighteen. He described
Forrest Hall as the outstanding back
n the game. Speaking of Hall, it is
.mazing just how many of the
nembers of the -U.S.F-. team are
transfers from other schools, by way
of one of the service teams. Won
c.er if. that means anything, must
jike the beautiful climate, or cam
pus, or something.
