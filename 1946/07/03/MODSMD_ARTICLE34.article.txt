# Signups For Murals End
## 
### 
With the intramural softball sign
up ending tonight, a total of seven
teams have inked the dotted line.
Newcomers are the SONA Navy
group, and a representative team
from the row to be called The Row.
Teams previously announced as
ready to play are Sigma Nu, Chi Psi,
Branner 1, Encina 3E, and the Fire
house.
With only two teams entered from
the three big halls on campus, in
terest in murals seems dead. If there
are any more teams that want to
participate, today is the last day to
sign up. Eligible to enter compe
tition are floor teams from the halls,
independent groups on campus, and
campus organizations.
The schedule will be made up at
the end of the week and printed in
Monday's Daily. Games will be
played each Tuesday and Thursday
at 4:30. The diamonds to be used
will be published also in Monday's
Daily.
Umpires are needed. Anyone in
terested should see either Harry
Wolter or Elwyn Bugge in the gym
or in the B,A.C.
