## NCAA Golf Champs Return to Farm; Stepping into Sport Fund Feud 
### BILL HORNBY 
Not yet back on the campus from
their winning sweep of the NCAA
golf championships at Princeton last
week, Stanford's self-supporting
golf team has stirred up some un
answered questions.
Did the golf team receive aid in
its journey from subscriptions by
supporters, or were they entirely
self-supporting at $425 a head, as
quoted by the Associated Press?
Would a campus benefit to raise
funds for the players be endangering
their amateur standing?
Stanford's Athletic Council au
thorized the golf trip if funds could
be provided, but seemingly the BAC
was not able to back up its slap-on
the-back with any athletic budget
funds, according to Bill Corbus,
council member.
President Donald B. Tresidder re
vealed there were no funds avail
able in budgets outside the athletic
department to spend on the trip.
Because of this and the fact that
similar requests for trips by ath
letes on other teams were being
turned down. Tresidder requested
the team not to make the trip or to
solicit funds.
Another limiting factor from the
administration's point of view was
a petition to Tresidder from physical
education students requesting the
employment of more physical edu
cation instructors for classes before
any extra funds be spent on team
trips.
The President's traveling fund
which sometimes is used to cover
emergency trips had been exhausted
for the fiscal year by faculty trips
when the golf team request was pre
sented.
However the golf team did make
the trip. The amount of any fund
that may have been solicited and its
final recipients are still unknown.
Further details about the Stanford
Athletic Council's "0.K.-if" on the
trip must wait on the return of Al
Masters, athletic director, from a
northern trip.

Despite the state of confusion as
to the exact status of the golf team's
pocketbook, considerable student
sentiment has developed for some
sort of an effort to pay back part of
their expenses.
According to Don Liebendorfer,
athletic publicity director, this prob
ably would not endanger their ama
teur standing if the funds covered
their expenses only. However,
A.S.S.U. President Jack Wallace is
going slow on any such plan until
the "professional" angle is cleared
up.
Bob Cardinal, member of the team,
was reached at his San Francisco
home last night and said so far as
he knew no member of the team
had received any funds, whether do
nated by Palo Alto merchants or
furnished by the University.
"Rosburg and Moore were broke
and in Chicago the last time I heard
from them, and Lambie was hitch
hiking home frorti Pennsyvania."

was reached at his San Francisco
home last night and said so far as
he knew no member of the team
had received any funds, whether do

furnished by the University.

Not yet back on the campus from
their winning sweep of the NCAA
golf championships at Princeton last
week, Stanford's self-supporting
golf team has stirred up some un
answered questions.
Did the golf team receive aid in
its journey from subscriptions by
supporters, or were they entirely
self-supporting at $425 a head, as
quoted by the Associated Press?
Would a campus benefit to raise
funds for the players be endangering
their amateur standing?
Stanford's Athletic Council au
thorized the golf trip if funds could
be provided, but seemingly the BAC
was not able to back up its slap-on
the-back with any athletic budget
funds, according to Bill Corbus,
council member.
President Donald B. Tresidder re
vealed there were no funds avail
able in budgets outside the athletic
department to spend on the trip.
Because of this and the fact that
similar requests for trips by ath
letes on other teams were being
turned down. Tresidder requested
the team not to make the trip or to
solicit funds.
Another limiting factor from the
administration's point of view was
a petition to Tresidder from physical
education students requesting the
employment of more physical edu
cation instructors for classes before
any extra funds be spent on team
trips.
The President's traveling fund
which sometimes is used to cover
emergency trips had been exhausted
for the fiscal year by faculty trips
when the golf team request was pre
sented.
However the golf team did make
the trip. The amount of any fund
that may have been solicited and its
final recipients are still unknown.
Further details about the Stanford
Athletic Council's "0.K.-if" on the
trip must wait on the return of Al
Masters, athletic director, from a
northern trip.

Despite the state of confusion as
to the exact status of the golf team's
pocketbook, considerable student
sentiment has developed for some
sort of an effort to pay back part of
their expenses.
According to Don Liebendorfer,
athletic publicity director, this prob
ably would not endanger their ama
teur standing if the funds covered
their expenses only. However,
A.S.S.U. President Jack Wallace is
going slow on any such plan until
the "professional" angle is cleared
up.
