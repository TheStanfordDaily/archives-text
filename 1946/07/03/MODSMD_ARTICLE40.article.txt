# Lag Goes Wild Over Ratio Rise

### MELLON SHELTON 
"MEN!!!"
That, in a word, sums up the av- j
erage Lagunitan's views on the !
Farm's summer quarter ratio.
"We think it's wonderful!" chirped I
a bevy of the current female crop
in answer to an informal Daily sur
vev.
MORE PARTICULAR members of
the distaff side failed to agree, how
ever. A bespectacled freshman, one
of the handful who get to come fall
quarter, cocked her head to one
side and remarked, "If they were
tall, blond, and handsome, or tall, !
dark, and handsome, it might be all
right." i
One young thing leaned back and
yawned, "Well, it's interesting, to
say the least."
A tanned, attractive engineering
transfer from Colorado laughingly
declared that so far she hasn't
found three-and-a-half men for
herself.
AND ONE ADDITION to the to
tal enrollment put down her books,
looked over her glasses, and said
bitterly, "They aren't doing me a
damn bit of good."
But the males, whether too short, !
too young, too old, too married, or !
too single, had their comments to
make. A.s one Rough said, "Those
gals were smart to turn the lights i
liff at that open house."
