# Farm-NBC Team Offers Radio Institute Courses
## 
### GEORGE MOORE 
The Stanford-NBC Radio Insti
tute, now in its fourth year, is of
fering a variety of courses on many
phases of radio production, plan
ning, technique and teaching to 87
students from North America and
Hawaii.
The emphasis of the institute's
program in this session has not been
on turning out trained radio per
sonnel and placing its graduates in
jobs, but in demonstrating radio
techniques and methods to teach
ers, members of groups who make
radio appearances at various times,
and to students desiring some pre
professional training.
MANY MEMBERS of the insti
tute have gone on to good jobs in
professional radio in spite of the
lack of concentration on profession
al training. This year students are
seeking experience and familiarity
with radio broadcasting to find po
sitions in the industry, or to return
to jobs in stations better equipped
to cope with radio's problems and
responsibilities.
Members of the NBC-KPO staff
in San Francisco are teaching most
â€¢of the institute's courses. Technical
Equipment and Operation is under
Don Hall, chief engineer of KPO;
Dwight Newton, radio news editor
of the station, is instructing in Ra
dio Journalism; John Grover, staff
announcer and producer for NBC,

is teaching courses in Radio Pro
duction.
THE LOCAL SALES manager for
KPO-NBC. Alfred W. Crapsey, is
in charge of the popular course in
Radio Selling and Advertising, and
chi?f announcer Floyd Fair is di
recting the class in announcing.
The required Survey Course in
American Broadcasting has brought
before the Institute men from NBC
and local stations describing net
work, regional and local program
ming. One of these, Lewis Frost,
program manager of NBC's Western
Division, emphasized the position of
American colleges and universities
as a source of talent and personnel
for the industry.
"THROUGH EXTRACURRICU
LAR activities in the college thea
ter and radio plants as well as gen
eral college training, many abilities
and habits can be developed which
will serve well in the long run of
a radio career," said Mr. Frost.
Aug. 17, the institute's sessions
will be climaxed with a broadcast
over KPO. written, produced and
performed by members of the classes
concerned who have shown excel
lence in their work during the
term.
