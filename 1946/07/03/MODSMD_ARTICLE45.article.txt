# What Is Sequoia's Future? Razing of Hall Most Likely
## 
### PAUL WEIL 
Stanford's current housing short
age has aroused some conjecture
over the future disposition of" Se
quoia Hall. The 52-year-old dor
mitory was abandoned at the end
of last summer quarter in order to
effect repairs which could not be
made during the war.
Since that time further investi
gation by a University committee
has indicated that it would be im
practical to attempt to repair or re
convert the structure. The possi
bility of using the rear half of the
building as a fraternity commissary
was abandoned when engineers' re
ports showed that the structure was
unfit for use.
BOTH SEQUOIA and Encina were
built in 1894 and both buildings
were in almost continuous use until
Sequoia was condemned last year.
According to Dr. Stanley Sharp,
Director of Men's Residences, the
superior building methods involved
in the construction of Encina have
made it possible for that building
to outlast Sequoia.
Sequoia was the original Roble,
and it retained that title until the
present frosh women's hall was

built. After it became Sequoia, the
building housed male students and
during the war it was used by the
War Department for its Civilian De
fense Training School. The lack of
repairs during the war period was
the original cause for abandoning
the building.
DURING ITS long history Se
quoia became the center for a large
part of Stanford's tradition. The
building has been the home of many
of Stanford's famous graduates and
it figured prominently in the 1906
earthquake.
