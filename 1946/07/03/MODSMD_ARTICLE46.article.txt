# Hall Clubs' Constitutions Call for Two Dollar Dues
## 
### BOYD HAIGHT 
Eneina, Branner. and Toyon resi
dents may be wondering where that
$2 "club dues" assessment went
when room and board fees were
paid this quarter.
New students might have envis
ioned some sort of a "shakedown"
for a nebulous and inactive club
organization but old residents will
remember the club dues of pre-war
days and their use in providing var
ious recreational facilities for Hall
residents.
DUES IN THOSE DAYS were
set at $1 for Encina men, $1.50 for
Toyon residents, and $1.75 for
Branner men. By fall quarter of
1543 a flat rate of $2 was charged.
Right to collect the dues from
Hall residents was established by
the individual Encina, Branner, and
Toyon club constitutions. The ac
tual collection of the dues was
turned over to the University but
the funds remain under the sole
control of the club members.
"ASSESSMENT of the club dues
at the time of the payment of room
and board fees merely facilitates
the insurance of collection from ev
ery man living in the Hall," empha
sizes Dr. Stanley L. Sharp, direc
tor of men's residences.
Sharp pointed to the various
uses made of the clul) funds built
up by the dues payment. Subscrip
tions to magazines and newspapers,
game room equipment, and lounge
furnishings have been paid for by
club dues. Smokers are also fi
nanced by the dues fund, which
likewise covers partial costs of
dances.
In Encina a library-study room
has been established and plans for
a music room are under considera
tion.
USE OF THE CLUB DUES is
voted by the Hall members. Ac

tual handling of the money is su- {
pervised by the student manager of
each Hall. A permanent record of j
the funds for Branner and Toyon
clubs is kept at the A.S.S.U. office. '
With the reoccupation of Bran
ner and Toyon by civilian men j
students, the reorganization of these j
clubs is getting under way. The is- !
sues, if they are issues, of the 1
amount and the continuation of the
dues will be decided by the club
members themselves.
