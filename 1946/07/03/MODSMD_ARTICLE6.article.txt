# Student Union Committee Selected; Collins Named Dibble Co-ordinator
## 
### 
Robertson "Bob" E. Collins, senior from River
side, last night was unanimously selected by
Excom to be student coordinator for Dibble Hos
pital.
As Dibble Coordinator it will be Collins' job

to draw up plans lor
of student government at the hos
pital, which has been turned over to
the University for housing, and to
bring it within campus government
and activities.
SUCH PLANS as are evolved will
be presented to Dean of Students
John Stalnaker for approval and, if
necessary, change.
Collins was empowered by Sum
mer Excom to appoint a five-man
committee to assist him in formulat
ing the government plan—termed
by Daily Editor Bill Hornby as a
"blue-print for fall."
Collins, who was present at the
Excom meeting and who accepted
the new post, said his committee
would be announced shortly.
HIS NAME was placed in nomina
tion by Summer Student Body Pres
ident Jack Wallace. It was moved
and seconded by Al Gilliland and
Bob Stevens.
Wallace said the first organization
of governmental representation for
the hospital dormitory area would
be of a "U.S.-Hawaiian type." Ten
tative plans call, he said, for at least
two representatives on Excom. The
dormitory area will eventually hold
2,7<M) students, he said.
Collins, an English major, was
founder of the Stanford War Board
and it was under his direction that
it became such a vital campus agen
cy during the war.
It was understood that the new
committee would replace in student
government, but under different aus
pices, the now defunct War Board.

Robertson "Bob" E. Collins, senior from River
side, last night was unanimously selected by
Excom to be student coordinator for Dibble Hos
pital.
As Dibble Coordinator it will be Collins' job

to draw up plans lor
of student government at the hos
pital, which has been turned over to
the University for housing, and to
bring it within campus government
and activities.
SUCH PLANS as are evolved will
be presented to Dean of Students
John Stalnaker for approval and, if
necessary, change.
Collins was empowered by Sum
mer Excom to appoint a five-man
committee to assist him in formulat
ing the government plan—termed
by Daily Editor Bill Hornby as a
"blue-print for fall."
Collins, who was present at the
Excom meeting and who accepted
the new post, said his committee
would be announced shortly.
HIS NAME was placed in nomina
tion by Summer Student Body Pres
ident Jack Wallace. It was moved
and seconded by Al Gilliland and
Bob Stevens.
Wallace said the first organization
of governmental representation for
the hospital dormitory area would
be of a "U.S.-Hawaiian type." Ten
tative plans call, he said, for at least
two representatives on Excom. The
dormitory area will eventually hold
2,7<M) students, he said.
Collins, an English major, was
founder of the Stanford War Board
and it was under his direction that
it became such a vital campus agen
cy during the war.
It was understood that the new
committee would replace in student
government, but under different aus
pices, the now defunct War Board.
