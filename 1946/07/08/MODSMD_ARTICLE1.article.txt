### 
The Senate will open debate to
day on a new OPA bill, to which
there are two opposition groups.
The first is led by Senators Taft
and Wherry, one demanding high
er ceiling prices for manufactur
ers, and the other demanding that
there be no ceilings at all on farm
products. The second group is led
by "Pappy" O'Daniel, who doestn't
want any ceilings on anything,
and who attempted a filibuster
against the last price-control bill.

In the mean
time, there does
n't appear to have
been any imme
diate and drastic
effect from the
sudden death of
OPA. First, there
is a certain time
lag between pro
duction, process
ing, and con-

sumption. Second, the possibility
that a new bill may be passed soon
has restrained many large-scale op
erators who must plan for some time
ahead. Third, local and unofficial
restraints have sprung up. In this
class are the rent ordinances passed
in many cities, and the action, for
instance, of some butcher shops in
refusing meat from wholesalers at
new, higher prices. Considering the
formidable opposition in the Senate,
and the failure of the crisis situa
tion the Administration apparently
was hoping for to develop, it ap
pears unlikely that the OPA will be
revived.
The Minnesota primaries today
apparently represent the last
chance for Harold Stassen to
make himself a national political
figure. lie has gone all out for
Governor Ed Thye, who is trying
to take the Republican nomination
from incumbent Senator Ship
stead. Shipstead cast one of the
two votes in the Senate against
the United Nations Charter, of
which Stabsen was one of the sign
ers.
Stassen has been one of the coun
try's most ardent speech - makers
since his release from the Navy. He
can be contrasted here with Califor
nia's Governor Warren, who was
thrown into national prominence by
his two-party nomination to suc
ceed himself last month. Warren
almost never makes a controversial
speech on national issues, giving
the opposition as few handles
against him as possible. Stassen's
speeches on national and interna
tional affairs, on the other hand,
have provided the Democrats with
numerous targets for partisan snip
ing.
The wartime black-list of firms
trading with the Axis has ended.
Peace, as well as war, makes strange
bed-fellows.

two votes in the Senate against
the United Nations Charter, of
which Stabsen was one of the sign

Stassen has been one of the coun
try's most ardent speech - makers
since his release from the Navy. He
can be contrasted here with Califor
nia's Governor Warren, who was
thrown into national prominence by
his two-party nomination to suc
ceed himself last month. Warren
almost never makes a controversial
speech on national issues, giving
the opposition as few handles
against him as possible. Stassen's
speeches on national and interna
tional affairs, on the other hand,
have provided the Democrats with
numerous targets for partisan snip
ing.
The wartime black-list of firms
trading with the Axis has ended.
Peace, as well as war, makes strange
bed-fellows.

The Senate will open debate to
day on a new OPA bill, to which
there are two opposition groups.
The first is led by Senators Taft
and Wherry, one demanding high
er ceiling prices for manufactur
ers, and the other demanding that
there be no ceilings at all on farm
products. The second group is led
by "Pappy" O'Daniel, who doestn't
want any ceilings on anything,
and who attempted a filibuster
against the last price-control bill.

In the mean
time, there does
n't appear to have
been any imme
diate and drastic
effect from the
sudden death of
OPA. First, there
is a certain time
lag between pro
duction, process
ing, and con-

sumption. Second, the possibility
that a new bill may be passed soon
has restrained many large-scale op
erators who must plan for some time
ahead. Third, local and unofficial
restraints have sprung up. In this
class are the rent ordinances passed
in many cities, and the action, for
instance, of some butcher shops in
refusing meat from wholesalers at
new, higher prices. Considering the
formidable opposition in the Senate,
and the failure of the crisis situa
tion the Administration apparently
was hoping for to develop, it ap
pears unlikely that the OPA will be
revived.
The Minnesota primaries today
apparently represent the last
chance for Harold Stassen to
make himself a national political
figure. lie has gone all out for
Governor Ed Thye, who is trying
to take the Republican nomination
from incumbent Senator Ship
stead. Shipstead cast one of the
two votes in the Senate against
