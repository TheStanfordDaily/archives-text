THE FACTS OF OUR LIFE
The typical campus argument about the future of Stanford
seems to break down over a lack of facts about the exact posi
tion of Stanford academically and financially.
To those who say the school is "slipping" can be opposed
those who think it's "forging ahead." One faction that sees a
miserly administration making money out of the students is
balanced by a group that sees a wolf at every door of a pov
erty-stricken school.
Until these discussions about Stanford are salted with a little
factual material they will do nothing toward helping this school
get its peacetime footing.
On Wednesday the Daily's Boyd Haight begins a series of
articles analyzing the present financial status of Stanford. Fol
lowing that series, Haight will examine the calibre of the present
faculty against the standards realized by the school in the past.
These articles should be recommended reading for any
person who honestly wants to help this school realize its po
tentialities.
