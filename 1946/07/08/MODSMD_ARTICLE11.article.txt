# Free and Easy Stanford Remembered With Sighs
## 
### CECIL ROSPAW 
In these trying post-war days of
1946, it is interesting to reflect
back to the days when Stanford
was operating on a free and easy
basis.
One of the best commentaries
on Farm life in the hazy days of
1909 is R. L. Duff us' book. "The
Innocents at Cedro." a recollection
primarily of Thorstein Veblen
when he was a professor at Stan
ford.
TODAY A POSSIBLE raise in
tuition charges next fall is receiv
ing "study" by Stanford officials,
according to Vice-President Alvin
C. Eurich.
Statistics were quoted by an
other University spokesman to the
effect that a lower rate of return
is being received on investments
of the 530.000.000 University en
dowment. Add to this the in
creased costs of services and
goods, and the necessity for added
revenue becomes apparent at
once.
When Duffus lived at Cedro, a
student at Stanford paid no tui
tion during his undergraduate
years unless he had made the mis
take of registering from a state
other than California.
"In that case his education cost
him twenty dollars a year, plus
syllabus fees, or slightly larger
laboratory fees."
"BOARD AND ROOM might
cost him three or four hours' work
a day, or he might pay as little
as a dollar a week for all or part
of a room, with a quarter-in-the
slot gas stove for cooking.—The
University's motto was 'The wind
of freedom blows,* and it did
blow," Duffus writes.
"I knew some young men who
lived in Encina Hall, the men's
dormitory on the campus, subsist
ing for prolonged periods on nuts,
dates, figs and other uncooked
foods.
"These young men grew quite
thin, and would. I think, have dis
appeared entirely if they hadn't
been occasionally invited out to
dinner. —At Stanford in those
days some people would try al
most anything once. I wonder it
this is the case today.'"
