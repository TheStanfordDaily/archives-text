### 
Atom Bomb Test No. 1 has come
and gone, leaving a wealth of ma
terial for study not only by the
nuclear physicists but by students
of homo sapiens.
One of our readers has passed
along the following story for in
clusion in the atom bomb data.
It seems that an elderly down
town woman took to heart a pre
diction passed on by friends that
the atom bomb explosion would
cause the San Andreas fault to
slip in a manner that would make
the April, 19(Xi. earthquake look
like a Chihuahua trying to shake
a flea off its back.
An hour or so before the bomb
was scheduled "away" she gath
ered all her china, glassware and
the vases around the house and
carefully settled them on the liv
ing-room sofa so any sudden shock
wouldn't break her valuables. •
Then, really preparing for the
worst, she wrote her will and
carefully deposited it in a tin box
in the basement.
These precautions taken, she
waited for the big moment, grow
ing more agitated as the metro
nome ticked on.
When the static grumbled on
the radio to signify the thing had
gone off she relaxed, but not for
long because one of her student
roomers told her it would take an
hour and three-quarters for the
shock to reach San Francisco.
She's still waiting.

Our other story today concerns
a beautiful blonde graduate of the
Class of '42 who recently returned
to her California home from a
trip to Mexico where her blonde
loveliness had the Latin brethren
emoting all over the landscape.
One day she was seated at the
bullfight in the box adjoining that
of the wife of a super-dignitary
waiting for a matador imported
from Spain to do great deeds of
gory glory.
When the big moment came and
Don Matador turned to dedicate
the kill, much to the delight of
the aficionados the honor went to
our blonde friend, not the mujer
del Presidente.
