The Editor, Sir:
The letter printed over my name
in this column in the last issue of
the Daily was borrowed from the
introduction to a short article
which I had written.
I wish to make this point clear,
because my words were condensed
in such a manner as to make the
letter seem the work of a religious
fanatic, and I am convinced that
the best in religion has plenty of
firm ground to stand on without
the use of raving and ranting.
Let it be clear that I am not
withdrawing the stand which
I took. I have not let my liberal
ism and desire to be "scientifically
objective" make me ashamed to
take a stand for the Christian
principles that most of us accept
in private but would consider it
bad taste to do so in public. For
does not the hour force men "to
certify—to seal—with their actions
what they believe and what they
teach"?
With men like Chancellor
Hutchins of Chicago University
telling us "that the outcome now
depends on whether our moral
life can catch up. and catch up
quickly enough to save the day.
I wonder if it could not possibly
be that the founders of this school
had deeper insight than we give
them credit for when they built
the University with the chapel at
its heart.
Certainly, only a naive mind
would suggest that a mere in
crease in chapel attendance could
be a panacea for all our problems.
But. would not our presence there
indicate that at least we realized
the seriousness of our day and
were leaving no stone unturned in
trying to bring out the best that is
in us? And certainly the day calls
for no less than our best.
And, with the foundations in
such danger of collapse, can we
afford to overlook the Christian
tradition and principles upon
which our civilization was found
ed ?
