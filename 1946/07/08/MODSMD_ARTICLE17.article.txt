The Council of Foreign Minis
ters is deadlocked again. Having
agreed to a general peace confer
ence for July 2!), the Russians are
now quibbling about the proce
dure to he followed by the con
ference. Molotov has insisted that
it be divided into committees, one
for each Axis nation, the com
mittee to consist of those actually
at war with that particular nation.
The conference as a whole would
have only general powers of ap
proval or disapproval. This would
limit the influence of the United
States and increase that of Russia,
particularly as the Ukraine and
White Russia would vote as inde
pendent nations, as they do in the
U.N.
The Russians have given way on
?.ll but one of the tangled questions
the Foreign Ministers have had to
settle—the exception being the res
toration of free navigation on the
Danube. An attempt to control the
conference in advance could have
been expected. Besides their obvi
ous dislike for free and uncontrolled
action, the Russians have not only
their prestige and bargaining power
to maintain, but particularly their
position in eastern Europe.
