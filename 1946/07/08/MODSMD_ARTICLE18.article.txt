# Pure Realism Of 'Open City' Thrills Critic
## 
### 
"Open City," the first post-war J
italian film production to come to j
America, is like a good solid blow \

in the face. It
fis a documen
tary study of
thr> Italy that
was crushed
under the Nazi
occupation af
ter Fasc is m
fell apart. Cru
elty flashes out
of almost every
scene.
Such a pic
ture could not

have > been made in the United
Stages, for an American could not
hate enough to make it. There is
not one vestige of the sordid Italy
of the war that is not covered. The
"heroine," Marina, sells herself to
the Germans because she cannot live
without dope. Franceso's bride,
who is killed by German bullets, is
with child and must marry. The
priest, Don Pietro, helps a Commu
nist.
AH of the characters are sure of
what they are saying for they have
Jived the lives which they are por
traying. The scenes are full of the
force- of reality because they are
veal. Rome is the backdrop for the ,
5-tory of "Open City."
Such reality carries a force and a
message that a hundred American
movies do not have, and the simple
jines of dialogue even in Italian I
have a power that is easily under
standable.
Everyone who has ever thought,
the story was a fairy tale or
exaggerated should sec this picture.
Everyone who thinks that Fascism
is only a word should see this pic
ture. And remember it. â€”Heintze
