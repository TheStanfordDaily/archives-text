# Emergency Messages Sent as 'Hams' Operate Again
## Amateur Airways Open, Club Back 
### 
W6YX, the powerful globe - cir
-1 cling transmitter of Stanford Radio
j Club "hams," returned to the air
| waves Friday, and the emergency
| message service which linked stu
| dents with the four corners of the
I earth before Pearl Harbor is once
more in operation.
Once again students with emer
j Sency reasons can reach friends or
families overseas, including G.l.'s
j stationed on islands where ham sta
[ tions have been set up.
PLANS ARE UNDER WAY to
j extend the scope of the emergency
service, and, if approved by Radio
Club members, Stanford students
| may soon send non-emergency mes
! sages to foreign countries.
Such a program will be worked
j out if enough Radio Club operators
: can spare the time to handle the
■ traffic, according to Oswald G. Vil
!ard, Jr., club trustee.
AT PRESENT students with a
pood reason for sending messages
through "ham" channels should
contact Villard at Extension 330 or
at 650 Cornell Street, Palo Alto.
Operating from a new clubhouse
just south of the Ryan High-Volt
age Laboratory, Stanford "hams"
have already contacted other ama
teurs in Hawaii, Mexico, South
America, Japan, Australia, and the
Pacific islands where G.I. "hams"
have built sets.
EUROPE IS MORE DIFFICULT
to contact due to the North Polar
magnetic mass, Villard said, and
India will also be difficult to reach.
South Africa reception should be
good.
When new antenna equipment
being installed by the club is com
pleted, reception and transmission
will be much more effective.
THE TRANSMITTER BUILDING
was donated to the University by a
former club member and made
available to the Radio Club by the
Electrical Engineering Department.
It replaces the former clubhouse
which was taken over by a war re
search project in radio propagation
financed by the National Bureau oi
Standards.
All amateur radio stations in the
United States were silenced during
the war. Now, however, virtually
turned to the "hams," according to
Villard. trustee of the, club's current
radio license.
ALL STUDENTS INTERESTED
in amateur radio work are invited
to attend the club's firsl meeting,
Wednesday at 4 p.m. in room 283
A code class for those training for
commercial and amateur licenses
has been organized.
It is planned that this class will
meet Wednesdays at 1:30 p.m. in the
Electrical Engineering Laboratory

ard Army code instruction course
