# No War For First Time In Eight Long Summers
## 
### WM. J. O'DRISCOLL 
Summer, traditionally the best j
season for military campaigning,
this year finds no such campaigns
in progress fox ; the first time in eight
years. True, men die in civil dis
orders like the seemingly endless
strife between the Kuomintang and
the Chinese Communists or perhaps |
in Java and Indo-China where long- I
subdued nationalism has finally i
flared and drawn blood.
But these affairs are not compar
able to the Great Power struggles
of the past decade and for this the j
world may have an uneasy' grati
tude. There is a sense of' relief !
from the overpowering tension of
the years of rampant fascism. Yet
no man anywhere can say with as
surance: "Yes, this' is peace; truly
peace."
FOR PEACE. BY A strict defini
tion, is a period when no prepara
tions are being made for war. And
to many this current period is mere
ly a truce until some fresh men and
material are readied for the final
showdown conflict. .
Essentially, in a physical and re
percussive sense, the world- has
grown much too small for any fur- j
ther such collision of Great Powers. I
It is difficult to believe any power
Gould come through a new ordeal l
with its actual or relative power'

position strengthened. The two j
powers which did emerge so
strengthened from the last war—
the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R.—might
exhaust one another in a clash of
the continents, but for either to win
a decisive, clear - cut advantage !
seems fantastically remote at this !

FOR THESE REASONS much of i
the political and diplomatic maneu
vering now being engaged in ap
pears hopelessly unrealistic. The j
practical men are supposed to be j
having their inning (said especially
of the United States and meant to I
contrast with 12 years of preceding
impracticably). But the so-called
realists evidence less awareness of j
the need for new lines of thinking j
than at almost any other stage in
our history. «
