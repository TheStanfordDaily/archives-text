# BEARD ON HISTORY
## 
### 
Charles A. Beard summarizes
the lessons of history in four sen
tences:
1. Whom the gods would de- ;
stroy, they first make mad with
power.
2. The mills of the gods grind
slowly, hut they grind exceeding
small.
!{. The bee fertilizes the flower
it robs.
4. When it is dark enough, you
can sec the stars.
