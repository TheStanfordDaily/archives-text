There seems to have been some
what of a crisis brewing in English
letters in the last live years—years
of war — and because the United
States,, in literary endeavor at least,
is so closely allied with Britain, the
intensity of that crisis has been car
ried over rather forcefully to us.
This "crisis" that I refer to is
a dissatisfaction with materialistic
progress unsupported by adequate
spiritual values. We sec it in the
work of Maugham, Huxley, and
Arthur Koestler. and in the life and
work of Christopher Isherwood.
Less than a year ago we saw it in
an American, Sheldon Cheney.
THE GOAL TO WHICH we
should turn is indicated by Maugh
am and Koestler; by the others it is
preached. This goal is mysticism,
defined by Huxley as "the common
denominator of all faiths."
BY ALL OF THESE writers ex
cept Cheney, it is shown that mys
ticism reached its highest expres
sion in the historic Aryan (Indian)
philosophy as expressed in the
Bhagavad-Gita (The Song of God).
This is the same philosophy of
which Schopenhauer wrote: "The
influence of the Sanscrit literature
will penetrate (Europe) not less
deeply than the revival of Greek
letters in the 15th century." It has
now penetrated our culture, it
seems, to the extent that it is in
fluencing deeply our best literary
minds. Let us take a look at its
products.
The first book of importance in
this series was Maugham's "The
Razor's Edge," in which the central
character, Larry, is' pictured as a
sensitive young man, intellectually
mature, who is in search of his
soul.
HE IS REPRESENTED succes
sively in a "business" atmosphere
(the economic United States of
"Babbitt" fame), in a sophisticated
and esthetic society of expatriated
foreigners in Paris, and against the
background of the "common man"
as represented by Belgian coal min
ers and German farmers (pre-Hit
lerian). But in none of these en
deavors does he find his soul.
He disappears for two years and

j when he has returned—from India
where he has been studying Vedie
mysticism and philosophy —he is
calm and self-assured and even re
plete with minor miracles. He has
j found his soul.
He disappears again—but this time
I to work out his life as a taxi driver
(to provide him with the material
necessities) and to cultivate this
| new-found thing of his—his soul.
CHRISTOPHER ISIIERWOOI), af
| ter being acclaimed as "one of the
I most gifted" younger English nov
elists for his "Last of Mr. Norris'"
and (in 1939) "Goodbye to Berlin,"
j went into "virtual literary retire
ment."
He went to Hollywood, Calif., and
devoted himself to mystical studies
as a disciple of the Vedanta Society,
a group whose doctrine derives from
| the aforementioned Indian scrip
tures.
(Editor's note: Bowman's re
! view of the current trend toward
mysticism in literature will be
continued in Wednesday's Stan
ford Daily.)

a dissatisfaction with materialistic
progress unsupported by adequate
spiritual values. We sec it in the
work of Maugham, Huxley, and
Arthur Koestler. and in the life and
work of Christopher Isherwood.
Less than a year ago we saw it in
an American, Sheldon Cheney.
THE GOAL TO WHICH we
should turn is indicated by Maugh
am and Koestler; by the others it is
preached. This goal is mysticism,
defined by Huxley as "the common
denominator of all faiths."
BY ALL OF THESE writers ex
cept Cheney, it is shown that mys
ticism reached its highest expres
sion in the historic Aryan (Indian)
philosophy as expressed in the
Bhagavad-Gita (The Song of God).
This is the same philosophy of
which Schopenhauer wrote: "The
influence of the Sanscrit literature
will penetrate (Europe) not less
deeply than the revival of Greek
letters in the 15th century." It has
now penetrated our culture, it
seems, to the extent that it is in
fluencing deeply our best literary
minds. Let us take a look at its
products.
The first book of importance in
this series was Maugham's "The
Razor's Edge," in which the central
character, Larry, is' pictured as a
sensitive young man, intellectually
mature, who is in search of his
soul.
HE IS REPRESENTED succes
sively in a "business" atmosphere
(the economic United States of
"Babbitt" fame), in a sophisticated
and esthetic society of expatriated
foreigners in Paris, and against the
background of the "common man"
as represented by Belgian coal min
ers and German farmers (pre-Hit
lerian). But in none of these en
deavors does he find his soul.
He disappears for two years and

j when he has returned—from India
where he has been studying Vedie
mysticism and philosophy —he is
calm and self-assured and even re
plete with minor miracles. He has
j found his soul.
He disappears again—but this time
I to work out his life as a taxi driver
(to provide him with the material
necessities) and to cultivate this
| new-found thing of his—his soul.
CHRISTOPHER ISIIERWOOI), af
| ter being acclaimed as "one of the
I most gifted" younger English nov
elists for his "Last of Mr. Norris'"
and (in 1939) "Goodbye to Berlin,"
j went into "virtual literary retire
ment."
He went to Hollywood, Calif., and
devoted himself to mystical studies
as a disciple of the Vedanta Society,
a group whose doctrine derives from
| the aforementioned Indian scrip
tures.
(Editor's note: Bowman's re

mysticism in literature will be
continued in Wednesday's Stan
ford Daily.)
There seems to have been some
what of a crisis brewing in English
letters in the last live years—years
of war — and because the United
States,, in literary endeavor at least,
is so closely allied with Britain, the
intensity of that crisis has been car
ried over rather forcefully to us.
