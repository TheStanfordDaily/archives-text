# Money-Saving 'Drive in Reverse' Foiled by Citation
## 
### 
A car zig-zagging backward down
Palm Drive toward Palo Alto caught
the attention of Stanford Police Sgt.
Edward Farmin last week.
This is the story which Sergeant
Fwrmin brought back to Police Chief

Gordon R. Davis:
When he overtook the car, Ser
geant Farmin noticed it was going
backward. The explanation of driv
er Vance Shaffey, a Stanford stu
dent, was that he had rented the

car from a friend on a mileage
basis. And he was trying to save a
few cents by driving backward as
the speedometer does not register
in reverse.
