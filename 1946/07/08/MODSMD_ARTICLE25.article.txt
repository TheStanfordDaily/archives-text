There has been a lot of talk on
campus concerning the admission of
athletes. Last quarter in this column
Art Levinson, sports editor at the
time, advocated the lowering of
Stanford's scholastic standards to
r.llow many future spor-ts stars to
i nroll.
The present sports editor is com
pletely against lowering the stand
ards for admission into this univer
sity to allow otherwise unqualified
..thletes to enter.
WE THINK STANFORD, without
lowering its standards, can and
■S*ill produce national championship
teams as we have in the past, as we
..id just recently in golf.
Suppose the entrance require
ments were relaxed for athletes.
Vould that be fair to the thousands
t students who want to come to
Stanford but have been refused ad
mission due to the crowded condi
tions at the present time? In fact,
vould that be fair to the athletes
themselves?
ONCE THE ATHLETES were al
owed to enter, that is athletes who
uldn'l enter under present stand
ards. could they maintain the grades
ecessary for athletic competition?
Remember that athletics take time.
Remembering that Stanfordites
"e graded on the curve, could these
•hletes spend three hours of rugged
practice five days a week and still
tave time for the necessary study
a tcr maintain passing grades?
BF THE TIME a prospective star
- ready for varsity competition, he
night have flunked out. If he could
nake the grades required at Stan
ford. well and good, but it would be
the exception rather than the rule
:or this to occur.
Our advice would be for these
prospective athletes to go to schools
where they would be assured of
passing grades while they are in
volved in intercollegiate sports.
Those athletes who are border
ine cases should perhaps be allowed
to enter Stanford on probation, and
to remain here if they go plus their
first quarter.
