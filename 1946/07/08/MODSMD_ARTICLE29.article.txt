## 
### 
Whipping Los Angeles in both
ends of a Sunday double bill, the
San Francisco Seals stayed within
a game of league-leading Oakland.
The Seals outlasted the Angels in
the opener to win. 5 to 4. in 11 in
nings. In the nightcap right-handed
Frankie Rosso tossed a neat one
hitter to coast to a 6-0 win. The
Seals won the series, five games to
three.
