# Guides Conduct Campus Tours

### EVELYN KONRAD 
The worst occupational hazard
that Student Guides must face is
becoming too much interested in
the visitors to whom they are show
ing the main parts of the campus,
guide Mary Jane Morse says.
"Unfortunately," Miss Morse ad

mits, "I become so much interested
in the various places that the visi
tors come from, that I start asking
them questions."
DURING THIS QUARTER Miss
Morse has already met guests who
came not only from every part of
the United States, but also from
Canada and England.
Bob Conner, new head of the
Student Guides, also enjoys his job.
Flight students assist.him, alternat
ing on duty at the information
booth, known as the "Cell," at the
entrance of Memorial Court, and at
Hoover Tower.
WHEN ASKED ABOUT the work
of the guides, Conner replied that
their job is to sell souvenirs and
post cards at the "Cell," to take visi
tors on tours through Inner Quad
arid Hoover Tower, and to answer
any questions that the guests might
have. Conner finds that visitors are
usually most interested in Memo
rial Church and Hoover Tower.
Since all the visitors, sooner or
later, ask the way to the Hoover
residence. Conner keeps a road map
in the "Cell" for that emergency,
because, as he himself confesses.
"None of the guides has ever been
there."
However, all the guides are well
versed in the history of the Uni
versity. so that they are rarely em

barrassed by the questions of the '
visitors.
SOLICITOUS FOR THE comfort j
of the guides who are on duty at j
the "Cell," Conner has brought his j
own radio to that booth for their#!
entertainment. His only warning is !
that they should not play it so loud- j
ly that strains of jazz float across !
Memorial Court.
New features at the "Cell" are >
the attractive display of post cards, !
pictures of the campus, Jmd maps,
that Miss Morse has arranged. Con
ner sees to it that the pictures and
notices on the bulletin board are
changed every week.
CONNER CONSIDERS the Stu
dent Guide service an asset to the
University, because, as he phrases
it, "Whenever we"hear that avisi-j
tor has children of college age, we
give him a real pep talk about the
advantages of going to Stanford."

of the guides who are on duty at j
the "Cell," Conner has brought his j
own radio to that booth for their#!
entertainment. His only warning is !
that they should not play it so loud- j
ly that strains of jazz float across !
Memorial Court.
New features at the "Cell" are >
the attractive display of post cards, !
pictures of the campus, Jmd maps,
that Miss Morse has arranged. Con
ner sees to it that the pictures and
notices on the bulletin board are
changed every week.
CONNER CONSIDERS the Stu
dent Guide service an asset to the
University, because, as he phrases
it, "Whenever we"hear that avisi-j
tor has children of college age, we
give him a real pep talk about the
advantages of going to Stanford."
The worst occupational hazard
that Student Guides must face is
becoming too much interested in
the visitors to whom they are show
ing the main parts of the campus,
guide Mary Jane Morse says.
"Unfortunately," Miss Morse ad

mits, "I become so much interested
in the various places that the visi
tors come from, that I start asking
them questions."
DURING THIS QUARTER Miss
Morse has already met guests who
came not only from every part of
the United States, but also from
Canada and England.
Bob Conner, new head of the
Student Guides, also enjoys his job.
Flight students assist.him, alternat
ing on duty at the information
booth, known as the "Cell," at the
entrance of Memorial Court, and at
Hoover Tower.
WHEN ASKED ABOUT the work
of the guides, Conner replied that
their job is to sell souvenirs and
post cards at the "Cell," to take visi
tors on tours through Inner Quad
arid Hoover Tower, and to answer
any questions that the guests might
have. Conner finds that visitors are
usually most interested in Memo
rial Church and Hoover Tower.
Since all the visitors, sooner or
later, ask the way to the Hoover
residence. Conner keeps a road map
in the "Cell" for that emergency,
because, as he himself confesses.
"None of the guides has ever been
there."
However, all the guides are well
versed in the history of the Uni
versity. so that they are rarely em

barrassed by the questions of the '
visitors.
SOLICITOUS FOR THE comfort j
of the guides who are on duty at j
the "Cell," Conner has brought his j
own radio to that booth for their#!
