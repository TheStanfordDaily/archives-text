# Credit Tie-up Is Deplored
## 
### 
H. Donald Winbigler, University
registrar, admits that the process of
transferring credits for student vet
erans is taking much too long.
Most of the attention of his staff
is now diverted to the tremendous
job of attending to admission ap
plications. The staff is not large
enough to do that and take care of
he credits as fast as they would
like.
THE GUIDE FOR evaluating
.â€¢rcdits recently published by the
American Education Council, com
plains Mr. Winbigler, "is longer
than a couple of Sears - Roebuck
catalogues."
Applications for transfer credits
are being considered in the order
in which they were received. How
ever in cases like graduation, where
speed is urgently required, special
-effort is being made.
MR. WINBIGLER SAID that
there are other institutions where
the process takes more than a year,
while at Stanford it should in no
instance take more than tour
months.
"This does not mean we approve
of the situation," said the registrar.
"It would be nice if we could say
that on such and such a date we
will be all caught up, but it would
not be honest. We are doing the
best we can under the circum
stances."
