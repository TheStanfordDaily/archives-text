# 24 Farm Fraternities To Reopen Next Quarter
## 
### 
Every one of Stanford's 24 fraternities will be active fall quar
ter, and all fraternity houses will be open, Ed Luce, president ot
the Inter-Fraternity Council, announced yesterday. â€¢
Most of the houses will be entirely filled with fraternity mem
bers; others will billet a few non-members. During the summer

quarter appi'oximately four 112
nity members are present at each
house as caretakers and workers.
Reconditioning and general repairs
are expected to be completed dur- j
ing the summer.
THE INTER - FRATERNITY of
fice in the Old Union building will
be opeli Wednesdays from 3:30 to
5. Any fraternity desiring to regis- !
ter new pledges should contact Luce ,
there.
For supervision of the houses,
fraternities have chosen a plan call
ing for resident assistants. During
spring quarter the University asked
each organization to submit a plan
for supervision. They did so, but
the plan was rejected by University
officials who submitted a plan of
their own.
UNDER THE UNIVERSITY plan
house mothers were strongly rec
ommended but provision was made
for graduate students or faculty
members to act as sponsors.
Financial arrangements for fra
ternities will be completed soon.
The University has agreed to pay
for extraordinary repairs occasioned
by University use during the war
years.
