The French Foreign Office, act
ing for the Conference of For
eign Ministers, yesterday dis
patched invitations to 21 nations
to participate in the general Eu
ropean peace conference, sched
uled for July 29.
This action "followed a compro
mise on Molotov's proposal to set

up rules of pro
ced u r e for the
conference in ad
vance. Each trea
ty will be consid
ered by a sepa
rate committee, as
Russia asked, but
there will be no
restrictions on the,
conference. How- j
ever, the Soviet ;

Foreign Minister, following the usu
al Russian face-saving policy of
masking a concession by starting a
new fight, read a prepared state
ment attacking American plans and
policies in the occupation of Ger
many.
But, on -the subject of German oc
cupation policies, Gen. McNarney,
U.S. European Theater commander,
said yesterday that, unless economic
barriers fetween the four occupa
tion zones could be broken down,
economic arrangements for western
Germany alone would have to be
considered.
Meanwhile, the Russians have
held up the deportation from the
Russian zone of Austria of thou
sands of persons classified as "Ger
mans." And apparently, they have
receded from their extreme defini
tion of German property in Austria
subject to reparations. It was said
that such claims would amount to
only about 10 per cent of Austrian
industry, rather than 75 per cent, as
had been estimated.
In Jerusalem. Dr. Chaim Weiz
man. Zionist leader, suggested the
possibility of dividing Palestine
into separate Arab and Jewish
states, as a solution to present
problems there.
This proposition was advanced by
the British themselves, in a White
Paper issued back befo' de wo'. It
was bitterly condemned at that time
bv both Jews and Arabs. That Dr.
Weizman mentions it now may well
be an indication that responsible
leaders in the Holy Land have been
inspired by the healing spirit of
compromise, so far conspicuously
absent.
And in another area torn by riot
and civil commotion, there appears
to be some chance for peace and
quiet again. The Indian Congress
Party has voted to accept the Brit
ish independence offer.

held up the deportation from the

The French Foreign Office, act
ing for the Conference of For
eign Ministers, yesterday dis
patched invitations to 21 nations
to participate in the general Eu
ropean peace conference, sched
uled for July 29.
This action "followed a compro
mise on Molotov's proposal to set

up rules of pro
ced u r e for the
conference in ad
vance. Each trea
ty will be consid
ered by a sepa
rate committee, as
Russia asked, but
there will be no
restrictions on the,
conference. How- j
ever, the Soviet ;

Foreign Minister, following the usu
al Russian face-saving policy of
masking a concession by starting a
new fight, read a prepared state
ment attacking American plans and
policies in the occupation of Ger
many.
But, on -the subject of German oc
cupation policies, Gen. McNarney,
U.S. European Theater commander,
said yesterday that, unless economic
barriers fetween the four occupa
tion zones could be broken down,
economic arrangements for western
Germany alone would have to be
considered.
