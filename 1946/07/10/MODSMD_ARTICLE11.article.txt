# Dibble Government Plans Offered
## Excom to Get Suggestions 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
A tentative conference - excor.?
form of student government for
Dibble was adopted lor submission
to A.S.S.U. Excom by a meeting of
11 representative students presided
over by recently appointed Dibble
co-ordinator Bob Collins last night.
The meeting" also went on record
as favoring for consideration by Ex
com four other matters that were
believed of primary importance if
the Dibble annex is to be incorpo
rated smoothly into campus affairs.
THE FIRST OF THESE was that
a provisional government be set uu
at the earliest possible date —to be
made up of appointed members who
would serve only until such time as
Dibble students could elect their
own representatives. Those appoint
ed would be students who definitely
will live at Dibble next fall.
A further recommendation ad
vanced by the meeting was that def
inite plans be made to the end that
Dibble students have representation
on A.S.S.U. Excom rs nearly as
possible in proportion to their num
bers.
This subject involved consider
able discussion because of the ap
parent conflict between the theory
of adequate representation in re
gard to numbers and the new
system of representation adopted
the past year.
THE Tinßl) RECCMMENDA
tion was that pre-reg committee
incorporate in their plans for thi>
fall an extensive program of orien
tation for new and returning stu
dents who will live at Dibble.
A final recommendation was that
Excom go on record as favoring an
organization of Dibble wives, but
that the actual formation of such an
I organization be allowed to develop
spontaneously.
Another meeting of the same per
-1 sonnel was called for next Tuesday,
at which time it is hoped that two
: members of the Administration will.
be on hand to give information on
i the progress of the Dibble project.
Present at the meeting, in addi
