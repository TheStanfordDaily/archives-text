# Stanford Finances--Difficult, Required Campus Reading
## 
### BOYD HAIGHT 
Financial reports do not make
easy reading. Disinterest wins out
when we are confronted with
profit and loss statements. The
columns of neat figures correctly
totaled do tell a story, however,
and what they have to say about
Stanford should be of interest to
every student.
In the past few months many a
discussion on the Quad, in the
halls, and on the Row on Univer
sity financial policy has ended
with, "The only place we'll find
the answer to that is in the books
of the business office."
The University publishes an an
nual financial report that covers
an audited account of all items of
"the business office books" and
from this report for 1944-45 we
will take many of our figures.
SIGNIFICANT as the sums for
that period ending August 31, 1945,
are, they cannot give a true picture
of current standing. The finan
cial situation of the University for
1946 must be projected on a na
tional scale of rising costs of living
and a falling value of the dollar.
Cost of living indices over the
past two decades show the March,
1946, index at 106.7 with the 1923
index set at 100. The percentage
increase from August, 1939, to
April, 1946, in all items of cost of
living is 32.8. With an index of
100 set for April, 1944, the cost of
building materials index had
reached 109 by May of this year.
These increases are reflected in
mounting costs for University op
eration and maintenance. Other
institutions have undertaken to
offset rising costs with increased
tuition charges.
SOME SCHOOLS may have
their eye on the $500 the veteran
is allowed per school year, but
generally universities such as
Princeton, Yale, Columbia, New
York University, and Colgate
have hiked annual tuition charges
$50 to $100 to meet higher op
erating costs.
That Stanford has not escaped
wage demands is evidenced by the
recent pay boost granted to main
tenance men of the Corporation
Yard. A new salary policy for the
instructional staff is also being
formulated.
With the onening of tin* fall
quarter the minimum salary for
instructors will be $2500 as com
pared with $1800 for the past
year. Assistant professors will
receive a $500 increase from the
old minimum of $2500 to the
new level of S3OOO.
HIGH COSTS of material and
labor mean that either Universitv
building plans will be curtailed
or increased expenditures will be
made for building. Indication of
booming building costs comes in
the statement by the contractor
who built Lagunita Hall a decade
ago for $750,000. His estimate for
the same job in 1946 is $1,250,000.
Increased expenditures for sal
aries. maintenance, and needed
building do not tell the whole
story in these days of "spiraling
inflation." Additions to the en
dowment fund, gifts, and an in
creased registration have swelled
the income of the University at a
rate that must match closely the
rise in operating costs.
The law of diminishing returns
does work to the University's dis
advantage in the increased regis
tration. University officials esti
mate that the student's tuition
fees pay for only one-half of'the
cost of educating him at Stanford;
income from endowment covers
:he other half.
THIS MEANS THAT the en
arged enrollment has mode nec
essary new costs for a larger in
structing staff and new expen
ditures for all facilities that the
student uses at Stanford.
(Friday's article will begin a
breakdown of the income and
expenditure categories and will
analyze the endowment invest
ment.)
