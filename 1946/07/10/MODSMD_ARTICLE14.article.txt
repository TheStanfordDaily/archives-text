ON CUDDLING N' SLACKS
A quarter or so ago that old
Iranophobe, Bob Kennedy, late
student body prexy, sounded off.
and rightfully so. about what he
termed a decline in Stanford
standards — namely, firesides so
dark the fire didn't show, and
cuddling on the Libe lawn. For
his efforts he was rewarded by
campus laughter and the amused
notice of city newspapers.
Today and Friday we aim to
take a crack at a parallel subject.
The Dean of Women's office prob
ably won't like any criticism of
its workings nor will "young love"
and the slack-wearing set.
AS AN OLD STANFOKDITE—
well, dating back to '40—I'm tak
ing it on myself to gripe about
some things. And laying myself
open.
Last quarter, and this quarter
too, I've seen, as have others of
the "old guard," public passion
displayed all over the Quad. I've
seen nuzzling on the Libe lawn,
cuddling on the benches in In
ner Quad, arm-in-arm promenad
ing (with sometimes the arms even
clasped around the couple's back
sides) and just plain ordinary ev-

eryday hand
holding. An d
all of this in
broad daylight-
For all that
it was "'the
Farm," Stan
ford in pre
war days main
tained an adult
poise wholly in
keeping wit h
the traditions

sought by Mrs. Stanford. A lot of
those traditions, lamentably, have
been discarded. Smoking on the
Quad for one, and women's stock
ings on the Quad for another. The
loss of these traditions can. in a
way, be defended and understood,
but there is no defense, or excuse,
for the loss of decency and the
juvenile exhibitionism so preva
lent now.
To see a man and a woman—we
assume they aren't boy and girl it
they're in college — necking on
campus in broad daylight smack
eth too much of high school and
teen-agers.
LOVE IS A FINE THING and
so is the old "Moonlight on the
Quad" tradition (a girl, the tra
dition goes, isn't a Stanford wom
an until she's been kissed in the
moonlight in front of the Memo
rial Church by a senior man), but
there's a time and a place for ev
erything.
And the time isn't daylight and
the place isn't the Quad and en
virons.
(Friday: Slacks and shorts on
the Quad.)
