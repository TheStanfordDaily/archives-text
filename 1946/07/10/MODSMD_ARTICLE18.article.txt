# Campus Opinion

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Can you tell me if Dibble will
offer housing facilities to under
graduate single ex-service wom
en'.' As I understand the present
program. Dibble will accommodate
single ex-service men or married
men and their families.
During the summer those of us
who are veterans are offered cam
pus housing because of the rela
tively small enrollment. However,
in the fall, campus facilities must
by necessity for supervision be
available to younger undergrad
uates.
Please understand that this is
not a beef in any sense of the
word with the policy mentioned.
It is merely to discover whether
or not any arrangement is being
considered for the housing of un
dergraduate women veterans.
Sincerely.
Dorothy Doescher
(Editor's note: According to
the Dean of Men's ollice no
plans are being made for han
dling single women veterans at
Dibble. It is fell that present
women's housing at Stanford
will be adequate to handle the
load.)
