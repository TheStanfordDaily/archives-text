IF YOU THINK IT'S "ONE WORLD"
A Stanford believer in the late Wendell Willkie's concept cE
"One World" faces a discouraging truth. Â«
Any effort to enlist support for this ideal will squeeze only a
minority interest out of his fellow students. It is the lesson cc
progress towards the world's truths that only a few people ope",
their eyes at a time.
So this editorial isn't for the majority of readers on the
campus, but for the nucleus who still know in their hearts thai:
the ideals of world government and international brotherhood
aie worth a million Bikini's, if they can only become the sym
bols which lead the public.
Now all this connects very directly with Mr. Ganti Subrah
manyam of Madras, India. At present he is the temporarv
chairman of Stanford's semi-potent International Club and ir.
that capacity he is doing his best to build the group into some
thing effective.
The club if it lived up to its ideals would be one of the most
important on the campus. It would do for Stanford what the
International Centers at Columbia and California have done so
well for those schools. *
Foreign students and American would become close friends
Faculty members would think it an honor to address the grouc.
It would carry real weight in campus affairs. It would work for
and get the International House at Stanford. It would brine
this school s record in the handling of the foreign student prob
lem up from the depths.
But the Daily can pound on this for days on end and re
cruit relatively few members for the group. Facing this fact for
what it is, our appeal is directly to those of you who are in
terested in living wisely in this new world of atoms and jets.
Get in touch with Mr. Subrahmanyam at Toyon and give
a hand.
