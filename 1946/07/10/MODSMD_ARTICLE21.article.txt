(Editor's Note: The Bookworm
today continues his discussion of
the recent trend toward mysti
cism in the modern novel, men
, tinning in his opening paragraph
today the work of the British
. novelist Christopher Isherwood.)
His next work was as a collabo
rator on a translation of the Bhaga
,vad-Gita (Marcel-Rodd, Hollywood,
50 cents), which Huxley says in its
introduction is "the most systematic
scriptural statement of mysticism
which the world has ever known."
In 1945 we had probably the most
important contribution to this trend,
Aldous Huxley's "The Perennial
Philosophy" (Harper. $3.00). In his
book Huxley elaborates his 15-page
introduction to the "Bhagavad-
Gita."
HE CALLS IT an "anthology of
the Perennial Philosophy"—that is,
selections from that body of knowl
edge in religious writings (Chris
tian, Mohammedan, Indian, and
Chinese) by enlightened "saints and
seers" which illustrates that, what
ever their religions, their experi
ence was essentially the same. This
unity he called the perennial phi
losophy after Leibrietz' "philoso
phia perennis."
In the same year we received Ar
thur Koestler's essays "The Yogi

and the Commissar" (Macmillan,
$2.75) in which the "Yogi" becomes |
the symbol representing man's spir- j
itual life and the "Commissar" the
symbol for man's materialistic life. |
KOESTLER, AUTHOR of "Dia
logue with Death," "Darkness at
Noon," and "Arrival and Depar
ture," shows us the extremity ofj
both positions and their essential
antagonism.
After a hundred or so pages of il
lustrations of the way in which the
"Commissar" has failed, including
two brilliant long essays on the
failure of Russian Communism, I
"Anatomy of a Myth" and "Soviet 1
Myth and Reality," the author gives
us a very weak argument against
the Yogi, leading us to suspect that
of the two, the Yogi is preferable, j

today continues his discussion of
the recent trend toward mysti
cism in the modern novel, men
, tinning in his opening paragraph
today the work of the British
. novelist Christopher Isherwood.)
His next work was as a collabo
rator on a translation of the Bhaga
,vad-Gita (Marcel-Rodd, Hollywood,
50 cents), which Huxley says in its
introduction is "the most systematic
scriptural statement of mysticism
which the world has ever known."
In 1945 we had probably the most
important contribution to this trend,
Aldous Huxley's "The Perennial
Philosophy" (Harper. $3.00). In his
book Huxley elaborates his 15-page
introduction to the "Bhagavad-
Gita."
HE CALLS IT an "anthology of
the Perennial Philosophy"—that is,
selections from that body of knowl
edge in religious writings (Chris
tian, Mohammedan, Indian, and
Chinese) by enlightened "saints and
seers" which illustrates that, what
ever their religions, their experi
ence was essentially the same. This
unity he called the perennial phi
losophy after Leibrietz' "philoso
phia perennis."
In the same year we received Ar
thur Koestler's essays "The Yogi

and the Commissar" (Macmillan,
$2.75) in which the "Yogi" becomes |
the symbol representing man's spir- j
itual life and the "Commissar" the
symbol for man's materialistic life. |
KOESTLER, AUTHOR of "Dia
logue with Death," "Darkness at
Noon," and "Arrival and Depar
ture," shows us the extremity ofj
both positions and their essential
antagonism.
After a hundred or so pages of il
lustrations of the way in which the
"Commissar" has failed, including
two brilliant long essays on the
failure of Russian Communism, I
"Anatomy of a Myth" and "Soviet 1
Myth and Reality," the author gives
us a very weak argument against
the Yogi, leading us to suspect that
