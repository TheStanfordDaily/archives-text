# Farm's ‘T’ Club Shows Benefits Of International Co-operation
## 
### 
Believing that an informal exchange of ideas is one road to interna
tional co-operation, Stanford's International Club helps both foreign and
American students to know better their contemporaries in this "One
World."
Meeting twice monthly during the last several years, members of the

"I" Club have held informal dis
cussions on questions affecting all
the nations of the world.
IN A WAR - WEARY WORLD
which is now experiencing peace
for the first time in seven years,
club members believe they can con
tribute to preserving the uneasy ar
r.iistice by learning more about
their fellow men.
Club discussions are supplement
ed by social activities. Dances, pic
r.ics, and foreign - style meals are
sponsored by the club each quar
ter. By this exchange of customs
and ideas, members are able to un
derstand more readily the personal
ity of other countries.
Ganti Subrahmanyam, temorary
chairman of the International Club,
hopes club activities will continue
during summer quarter if enough
nembers are interested. An organi
sational meeting is tentatively plan
led for next week.
SUBRAHMANYAM, a graduate
enpineering student from Madras,
India, emphasizes that meetings are
bpen to American as well as foreign
students. The average attendance at
Tieetings last quarter was 55, with
about 12 different countries being
represented.
At present, the club is attempting
to secure a room on campus for
club meetings. However, with the
expected classroom shortage in the
fall, members will probably contin
ue to meet in Palo Alto where Dr.
,?.nd Mrs. Edwin Thomas, informal
sponsors of the club, have held
neetings in their home for several
: years.
Subrahmanyam explained that
some other universities, including
the University of California, have
International Club buildings in
which foreign students live. These
buildings, however, were not built
by the university or the students,
but donated by the Rockefeller
Foundation.
