# Golfers 'Aided' For Eastern Trip
## 
### 
A total of $425 has been turned
over to Frank McCann, student rep
resentative for the Stanford golf
team by merchants in Palo Alto who
collected the money to help defray
the team's expenses on its recent
eastern trip.
The team, winners of the National
Intercollegiate Golf championship at
Princeton, New Jersey, early this
month, were put on their own due to
a lack of funds in the school treas
ury.
THE FIVE MEMBERS of the team
have estimated that the trip cost
not less than $425 apiece. Bill Moore,
last, returning golfer, said yesterday
that his expenses were just under
$500.
Acceptance of the funds from the
merchants will not endanger the
amateur standing of the team in any
way as long as. they do not accept
more than they spent, according to
the Stanford Athletic Council.
THE TEAM, PACIFIC COAST
champs, was informed near the end
of last quarter that the BAC could
not support a trip to the east be
cause of its depleted treasury. The
men voted to make the trip anyway
paying their own expenses. The fund
which was turned over to McCann
was collected by generous backers
of Stanford sports who wanted to
help the golfers.
Not all of the collections are in as
yet. McCann will act as the treas
urer and when the final sum is ob
tained—it is expected to reach as
high as $800 —the money will be di
vided among the five team mem
bers.
ALL MEMBERS OF THE TEAM
are now back at school. Lambie,
last reported in Pennsylvania, wired
for funds and caught a plane out of
Cincinnati.
No comment was available last
night from the University adminis
tration as to their policy toward the
team's acceptance of the funds.
