# NEW BRUSH FIRE REPORTED
## 
### 
Another small brush fire broke
out yesterday near the Shell station
on El Camino Real but Fire Chief
Marston reported that it was caused
by a careless cigarette butt and not
the work of the campus arsonist
No information has been uncovered
concerning the Farm's fire-bug, but
action is expected.
