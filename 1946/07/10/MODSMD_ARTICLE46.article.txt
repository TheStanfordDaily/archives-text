# Williams Paces Americans to 12-0 Victory
## Bosox Ace Poles Two Homers; Senior Loop Held to 3 Hits 
### 
Terribly Ted Williams of the Red Sox and the rest of the American
Leaguers scored the most onesided triumph in All-Star games history
today by defeating the Nr.ticnal League team 12 to 0 in the 13th annual
classic.
American League batsmen got 14 hits, including two homers by

Williams and one by Charley Kel-'
ler of tho Yankees, In pitching the
shutout, three American League
pitchers allowed the Nationals only
three hitsâ€”all of them singles.
A SELL-OUT CROWD of 34.806
fans jammed Fenway Park and paid
a net of $89,701 to see the American
League's version oi the "hit parade"
shake the stars of the National
League.
Williams' part in the triumph in
cluded two singles and a walk in
addition to the two homers for a
perfect day at bat. His four hits
brought his All-Star game average
to .500, seven hits in 14 times at the
plate.
BASEBALL'S MOST DISTIN
GUISHED pitching artists. Bob Fel
ler of Cleveland and Hal Newhou
ser of Detroit, whitewashed the Na
tionals for three innings each and
then Handsome Jack Kramer of the
Browns wound it"up with a flourish.
He gave no hits in his final three
inning stand. Newhouser yielded
one hit and Feller was touched for
two.
Newhouser and Feller, great per
sonal rivals for pitching prestige,
were about even. But the Detroit
southpaw counted his day better
spent because he lammed a man
sized single to drive in a run, then
went on to score himself.
FELLER PITCHED HIS WAY out
of a minor jam in the first. Stan
Musial of the Cards was safe when
shortstop Johnny Pesky of the Red
Sox erred with a wild throw. John
ny Hopp of the Braves singled Mu
sial to second. Both runners ad
vanced when Dixie Walker of the
Dodgers grounded out. Then Feller
struck out George KuroWski of the
Cards, one of the game's best clutch
hitters, to end the uprising.
There was comedy in the eighth
when Truett "Rip" Sewell of the
Pirates came in to pitch for the
Nationals and displayed his seldom
used "blooper ball." An unbeliev
able pitch, it soars high enough to
clear a good-sized haystack before
it reaches the plate. Sewell's idea
is that the hitter will have to fur
nish his own power. Ted Williams
did just that, taking a terrific lunge
at the ball and driving it into the
center field bull pen for a home run.
