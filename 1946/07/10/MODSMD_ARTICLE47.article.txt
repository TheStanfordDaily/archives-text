## 
### 
Turning down offers of scholar
ships to schools over the country.
Buddy Young has made up his mind
to return lo the University of Illi
nois, the same school he went to be
fore he went into uniform.
It was thought for some time that
Young would come out west to play
ball for UCLA. Young was the star
of last year's Fleet City football
team, thought by many to be the top
team in the country.
