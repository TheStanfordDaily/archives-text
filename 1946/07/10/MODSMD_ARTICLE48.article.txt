# Mural Games Dispay Color
## 
### 
Yesterday's intramural practice
games indicated that the murals will
produce some colorful ball games
when the season gets under way to
morrow.
Most impressive in its debut was
the team representing the School of
Naval Administration. The Navy
nine, having played together before,
is already a smooth-working com
bination. Last quarter SG'NA was
runner-up in the Navy Softball
league. They were selected to rep
resent Navy in the all-campus mur
als and again were runner-up, win
ning 8 out of 10 games.
LT. COMDR. K. F. DERLEIN has
named the following tentative roster
for the SONA team: Hynes, c;
Smith, p; Walker, lb; Arje, 2b; Tay
lor, ss; Bondo, 3b; Meadows, cf;
Hirschman, If; and Herrick, rf.
Johnny Sadler, manager of the
Encina Cellar team, will have a good
squad as soon as he has a full gang
working out regularly.
BOTH JERRY HILL of Encina IE
and Paul Lawrence of Phi Delta
Kappa were optimistic concerning
their team's chances. The Phi Delts
had the biggest turnout with more
than 18 players present. In their
practice tilt Encina IE and Phi Delta
Kappa tied 2 to 2. Charlie Grandi,
who pitched a good game and hit a
home run, was outstanding for En
cina.
Herb Eggleston. manager and
pitcher of a well-co-ordinated Sigma
Nu team, displayed a tine fast ball
and lots of control in turning back
an always-theatening Encina 3E
team by a score of 8 to 5.
ENCIN A PUT two men in scoring
position in the last inning, nearly
tying up the game, but the Sigma
Nu team tightened down and cut
them off.
Enema's manager, "Shorty" Vie
loe, starred for his team at second
base, making several excellent stops.
The 3E's. while lacking the all
around team play of their opponents,
gave promise of developing into
pennant contenders.
EITHER BRANNER I DEFEATED
the Firehouse 17-15, the Firehouse
defeated Branner I 19-17. or it was a
tie game 17-17. Branner I, playing
with a pickup team, didn't take the
practice game too seriously and the
Firemen followed suit. Intramural
Director Bugge, who tried his best to
keep track of the proceedings, re
fused to comment on a possible
score.
Intramural softball umpires still
are badly needed and will be paid SI
per game. Anyone interested should
contact Bugge at the men's gym.

pennant contenders.
EITHER BRANNER I DEFEATED
the Firehouse 17-15, the Firehouse
defeated Branner I 19-17. or it was a
tie game 17-17. Branner I, playing
with a pickup team, didn't take the
practice game too seriously and the
Firemen followed suit. Intramural
Director Bugge, who tried his best to
keep track of the proceedings, re
fused to comment on a possible
score.
Intramural softball umpires still
are badly needed and will be paid SI
per game. Anyone interested should
contact Bugge at the men's gym.
Yesterday's intramural practice
games indicated that the murals will
produce some colorful ball games
when the season gets under way to
morrow.
Most impressive in its debut was
the team representing the School of
Naval Administration. The Navy
nine, having played together before,
is already a smooth-working com
bination. Last quarter SG'NA was
runner-up in the Navy Softball
league. They were selected to rep
resent Navy in the all-campus mur
als and again were runner-up, win
ning 8 out of 10 games.
LT. COMDR. K. F. DERLEIN has
named the following tentative roster
for the SONA team: Hynes, c;
Smith, p; Walker, lb; Arje, 2b; Tay
lor, ss; Bondo, 3b; Meadows, cf;
Hirschman, If; and Herrick, rf.
Johnny Sadler, manager of the
Encina Cellar team, will have a good
squad as soon as he has a full gang
working out regularly.
BOTH JERRY HILL of Encina IE
and Paul Lawrence of Phi Delta
Kappa were optimistic concerning
their team's chances. The Phi Delts
had the biggest turnout with more
than 18 players present. In their
practice tilt Encina IE and Phi Delta
Kappa tied 2 to 2. Charlie Grandi,
who pitched a good game and hit a
home run, was outstanding for En
cina.
Herb Eggleston. manager and
pitcher of a well-co-ordinated Sigma
Nu team, displayed a tine fast ball
and lots of control in turning back
an always-theatening Encina 3E
team by a score of 8 to 5.
ENCIN A PUT two men in scoring
position in the last inning, nearly
tying up the game, but the Sigma
Nu team tightened down and cut
them off.
Enema's manager, "Shorty" Vie
loe, starred for his team at second
base, making several excellent stops.
The 3E's. while lacking the all
around team play of their opponents,
gave promise of developing into
pennant contenders.
