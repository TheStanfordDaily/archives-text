# 'Not Yet,' ‘Not Too Fast'— As Rehearsal Whip Cracks
##

By CARL. HEINTZE
It is more fun to watch a rehearsal of a play than the finished product.
If you don't believe it, wander over to the Little Theater where "The Time
of Your Life," written by the world's greatest playwright, William Saro
yan, is deep in the throes of re-birth.
Miss Barbara Welch, the director, is sitting far up in back of the

recesses of the empty house watch
ing the proceedings going on on the
stage with a super - critical eye.

You slyly slip
into a red plush
seat and watch
too.
Newton Ar
nold, who is the
hero of Mr. Sa
royan's epic of
Nick's San Fran
cisco bar, is
seated at a ring
side table simu-

lating interest in the beautiful peo
ple who pass in and out during the
course of the play's action.
IN COMES 808 O'BRIEN, or
rather Tom, Joe's buddy, with an
imaginary bag full of jelly beans
and gum. He gets as far as the bar
when down from the darkness floats
Miss Welch's voice.
"Not so fast, Bob," she says.
So Bob, or rather Tom, goes out
and comes in once more. He opens
his mouth to speak, when Marie
Selland, who is Kitty, the heroine,
puts her head through the door of
the nearest exit.
"Not yet," says Miss Welch cryp
tically. This mystifies you until
someone sitting beside you informs
you Kitty doesn't enter the scene
yet.
TOM AND JOE NOW ENGAGE
in a gum-chewing match; that is,
they try to see who can chew the
most sticks of gum at once. Only
they don't have any gum; it is sim
ulated. By this time you are get
ting slightly confused.
Then somebody called "Arab"
walks in, pronounces the mystic
words "no foundation," and departs
having shed no light on which foun
dation. Joe and Tom start chewing
gum again. A character named Kit
Carson starts whittling on the table
in time to the chewing of Tom and
Joe. Bob Ashley starts a song and
dance act in the middle of the floor.
Miss Welch says "Not yet," to Miss
Selland who has put her head
through the door again. And to top
it all off, an unidentified man comes
in looking for the pin ball machine
which isn't there, while Wesley the
piano player goes into "Scrub Me
Mama with a Boogie Beat."
This is too much for you and you
slink quietly out of Memorial Hall
into the night, marveling at the fact
that out of all this comes a play.
