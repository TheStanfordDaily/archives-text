# Trio's Work ‘Faultless'
## 
### 
Displaying a skilled artistry of
faultless ensemble work and excel- i
lent tone quality, the Albeneri Trio ,
last night presented the first in a'
series of eight chamber music con
certs in Memorial Hall Auditorium.;
With Alexander Schneider, vio
linist'; Benar Heifetz, 'cellist, and
Erich Itor Kahn, pianist, the trio
featured the works of Beethoven.
Ravel, and Schubert in their first
program.
Last night's concert was given in
honor of and in the memory of the
late Eliot G. Mears. Dr. Mears, pro
fessor of geography and interna
tional trade at Stanford at the time
of his death on the East Coast in
May, had been associated with Mrs.
Herbert Hoover and Mrs. Elizabeth
Sprague Coolidge in forming the in
itial plans which led to the presen
tation of chamber music concerts
here at Stanford.
The Beethoven Trio in B Flat Ma- 1
jor, Op. 11, was performed with ex
cellent timing; the duet between vio
lin and 'cello and the piano runs
were outstanding.
In contrast with the Beethoven
work of strict classical form, the
Ravel Trio in E Flat Minor allowed
much more opportunity for inter
pretation. The true artistry of the
Albeneri Trio was evident in the
performance of the Ravel work.
Tone quality of the violin and
'cello, fast runs by the piano, and
the flowing ensemble work of all
three instruments exemplified a
balanced interpretation.
The closing work on the program
was the Schubert Trio in E Flat
Major, Op. 100. Here again the en
semble work was perfect.
Last night's performance insures
another near-capacity audience for
the Friday night concert. Six other
concerts follow to complete the se
ries, giving Stanford music lovers
rare and unsurpassed performances
of chamber music works.
Opportunity to enjoy the cham
ber music works was provided by
the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge
Foundation of Music of the Library
of Congress and the Friends of Mu
sic at Stanford.
Credit for bringing a group of
artists to Stanford of the caliber of
the Albeneri Trio must be extended
to these groups.—Boyd Haight
