places in its first four days, it was
announced yesterday.
The places included one house,
two apartments and 13 rooms, some
with kitchen privileges, Mrs. Ora
Dale Gillette, who is making the
survey for the University, said.
About 225 persons were called in
the four-day period, she said.
"The sympathetic and helpful at
titude of the people of Palo Alto
has been very encouraging," she
said.
The campaign was inaugurated
by the University because despite
the acquisition of Dibble Hospital
much additional housing will be re
quired for the expected record
breaking enrollment of 7.000 and
the resulting faculty increase. The
latter is a particularly serious prob
lem, officials said.
