In the Senate, debate continues
of) the OPA bill. So far, the con
script fathers have exempted from
price control nearly every product
or commodity with a bloc behind
it. Senator Taft's proposal, which
President Truman attacked in his
veto message, to alioW manufac
turers to pass along to consumers
higher production costs, will be up
for discussion today. The only
Administration gain was defeat of
an amendment to allow rent in
creases.
Still, the Senate will probably

pass the bill even-j
tually. Then • a
conference com
mittee will haggle
over it and, it ap
pears, the meas-j
ure will finally go
to the White
House more thor

trapped" than was!
the original bill J

If Truman vetoes it again, OPA will
be dead. If he doesn't, he will have
publicly abandoned the principles
on which he based his former veto.
He has my sympathy.
The Council of Foreign Minis
ters in Paris continues its delib
erations on occupation policies in
Germany. Russia, it now appears,
wants a centralized, industrial
Germany; Britain will string along
with either Russia or the U.S.
The United States is willing to
treat Germany as a unit, if no
central administration is estab
lished; and France demands that
the Rhincland, with the Ruhr and
Saar valleys, he detached from
Germany entirely.
This is another situation that will
require compromise. Russia's pro
posal to abandon the "goat-pasture"
policy—now that she has turned Si
lesia over to Poland and has taken
in reparations as much as she can
carry away—is considered by some
to be an attempt to popularize and
strengthen the German Communists.
France's policy appears to be
France's historical policy. Britain
has had the miserable job of trying
to administer industrial Germany
without reopening the mills and fac
tories and is probably tired of it.
The United States, committed to a
"hard peace" policy and yet not
feeling as strongly about it as a Eu
ropean power would, is trying to do
its best for Germany in a negative
sort of way.
An Australian proposal in the
atomic control sub-committee to
establish an autonomous atomic
energy authority within the Uni
ted Nations framework has been
rejected by Russia. The Russians
insist that the Security Agency is
the proper agency to deal with the
atom bomb. The sub-committee
will make its report shortly, for 1
further U.N. action.

the Rhincland, with the Ruhr and
Saar valleys, he detached from
Germany entirely.
This is another situation that will
require compromise. Russia's pro
posal to abandon the "goat-pasture"
policy—now that she has turned Si
lesia over to Poland and has taken
in reparations as much as she can
carry away—is considered by some
to be an attempt to popularize and
strengthen the German Communists.
France's policy appears to be
France's historical policy. Britain
has had the miserable job of trying
to administer industrial Germany
without reopening the mills and fac
tories and is probably tired of it.
The United States, committed to a
"hard peace" policy and yet not
feeling as strongly about it as a Eu
ropean power would, is trying to do
its best for Germany in a negative
sort of way.
An Australian proposal in the
atomic control sub-committee to
establish an autonomous atomic
energy authority within the Uni

rejected by Russia. The Russians
insist that the Security Agency is
the proper agency to deal with the
atom bomb. The sub-committee
will make its report shortly, for 1
further U.N. action.

In the Senate, debate continues

President Truman attacked in his
veto message, to alioW manufac
turers to pass along to consumers
higher production costs, will be up
for discussion today. The only
Administration gain was defeat of
an amendment to allow rent in

If Truman vetoes it again, OPA will
be dead. If he doesn't, he will have
publicly abandoned the principles
on which he based his former veto.
He has my sympathy.
The Council of Foreign Minis
ters in Paris continues its delib
erations on occupation policies in
Germany. Russia, it now appears,
wants a centralized, industrial
Germany; Britain will string along
with either Russia or the U.S.

treat Germany as a unit, if no
