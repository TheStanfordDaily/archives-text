ODDS 'N ENDS
These editorials will be very short today because we've got
to rush out between paragraphs to nurse our car after a trip
back of the Post Office.
In these horrible days of material shortage, etc., etc., etc.,

One side of the Post Office fork road is reportedly not marked
ONE WAY. We nearly lost a staff member yesterday, so per
haps the Department of Signs could move in.
Just to prove we don't view all with alarm, the consensus is
that the Branner food is improving.
