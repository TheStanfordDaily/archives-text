In "A Few Brass Tacks" (Harper: $2.75) Louis Bromfield has
done what a great many private citizens have wanted to do at
one time or another. He has set down his thoughts and conclus
ions about the social, political, and economic problems of our
day.
Bromfield calls this an Age of Irritation and levels his guns

at what he considers the sources
of this irritation. They include the
sort of thinking which confuses
"plumbing and automobiles" with
civilization, which confuses money
with "real wealth" (the resources
money represents), and which
pays lip service to idealistic
dreams of world betterment while
hypocritically pursuing its own
selfish aims.
Industrialization has come upon
us too fast, he says, has found us
inadequately prepared for it, and
is now our master when it should
be our sel vant.
The solution which Bromfield
sees lies neither in extreme con
servative nor radical action, but
in the clear- thinking recognition
of, and conformity to, natural and
human laws and limitations.
It is this reviewer's opinion that
"A Few Brass Tacks" will be
found among this year's non-fic
tion best sellers. It certainly
seems to be Bromfield's best all
time contribution to the reading
public. (This book is available at
the Stanford Bookstore.) â€” Andy
