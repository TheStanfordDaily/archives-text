## Bull Session

ON SAME SUBJECT
Today we continue, bloody but
unbowed, our tirade against pub
lic loving and feminine wearing
apparel against the traditions of
Stanford.
Excom had a few words to say
on the matter Wednesday night.

After agreeing
it wasn't so hot
and doing a
little "tsk-tsk
ing," Excom, as
is at times its
wont, did noth
ing. And there
is nothing that
it can do. If
Stanford stu
dents haven't
good taste then

they haven't good taste.
My gripe today is on the matter
of slacks and shorts as publicly
displayed by some Stanford wom
en. One of my agents indignantly
reported the other day she had
seen women in the Libe wearing
slacks and pedal-pushers (knee
length pants, they tell me). That
my agent doesn't look well in
slacks is of no import. Dorothy
Parker's jingle still holds good:
"Women in slacks shouldn't turn
their backs."
And women in slacks shouldn't
inflict their backs on the library
or the Quad. Let the Sunday tour
ists do it if they want.
An Excom member—l'm a poor
reporter and didn't get his name—
reported Wednesday night that he
had seen several young things
prancing around the Cellar in
shorts. To my joy he agreed with
me that it didn't set at all well
with him.
Mills College girls attend classes
in jeans and plaid shirts—they say
the profs with 8 o'clocks really
get ulcers in a hurry viewing this
spectacle — and pride themselves
on it. When I was young and spir
ited I could take it, but no more.
Please, Stanford girls, wear those
nice skirts and cashmeres (I know
one girl who's unhappy cuz she's
only got 13 of 'em) or in hot
weather those frilly things that
make the boys say. "My. they do
look better in spring and summer."
