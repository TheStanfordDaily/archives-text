(Editor's note: This is the
second in a series of articles
outlining the financial structure
of Stanford. Though difficult
reading, they should indicate
some of the problems facing
Stanford planners.)
These are the raw figures for
the operation of the University for
one year.
Transfer them to the familiar
things that they stand for — the
Quad, the library, the faculty, the
grounds, the halls — include the
agreeable and the disagreeable, and
you find the University as it stands
today, an institution with yearly
gross income and expenditures
running into the millions.
Take a look around you, make
it atop the Hoover tower or in the
middle of the Quad, but get a good
look. Take that view of the Quad,
the grounds, the roads, and the
halls and try to convert what you
see to dollars and cents, expendi
ture and income. Only then will
the figures below mean anything
to you.
RISING COSTS and a sub-nor
mal enrollment resulted in a $156.-
772.81 operating deficit for the
University in 1944-45. However,
the amount the school ran "in the
red" was far short of the $898,000
deficit which had been projected
in the budget for the year.
Rigid economy in all depart
ments and an unexpected increase
in income from the endowment in
vestment accounted for the unex
pected drop in the deficit, accord
ing to the financial report for the
fiscal year ending August 31, 1945.
Income for the period totaled
$6,266,833.25 while expenditures
reached the sum of $6,423,606.06.
The book value of the endowment
assets totaled $35,446,285, a new
high figure.
A breakdown of the income fig
ure allows us to examine the
amount for each income source.

527.98. General tuition charges of
$979,822.31, Civil Affairs Training
School fees of $133,394.24, and

Roble Gym, University libraries,
Registrar, Appointment Secretary,

loans, contracts of sale, and other

property, accounted for $808,142.-

this. Publications of the Food
Research Institute and the Grad
uate School of Business brought
$8,136.97. Income from the Speech
and Drama Department was set at

The "Other Sources" division in
cluded discounts on purchases,
filling station rental, museum fees,
concession receipts, and rentals of
academic building facilities. In

The University Press came

vided $110,068.34.
War training projects in engi
neering, science, and management
brought $101,417.87 for the year.
SHIFTING OVER to expendi
tures, we find that expenses of the
general administrative offices, a
much-discussed sum, totaled $358,-
298.23.
Expenditures for instruction
and departmental research to

These are the raw figures for
the operation of the University for

Transfer them to the familiar

today, an institution with yearly
gross income and expenditures
running into the millions.
Take a look around you, make
it atop the Hoover tower or in the
middle of the Quad, but get a good
look. Take that view of the Quad,
the grounds, the roads, and the
halls and try to convert what you
see to dollars and cents, expendi

the figures below mean anything
to you.
