# Sigma Nu's Edge Phi Delts, 6 to 5, In League I Murals; Two Forfeits
## 
### 
Opening play in League I intra
mural softball circuit got off to a
disappointing start yesterday when
two teams failed to put in an ap
pearance and defaulted their games.
In the only league game played,
Sigma Nu edged out Phi Delta Kap
pa 6 to 5. The Phi Delts, with the
biggest turnout in the league, could
not quite substitute numerical su
periority for a lack of first - line
pitching.
The game, which was ended in
the sixth inning by the 5:45 p.m.
time limit, featured above-average
play by both team* Had the game
gone another inning the Phi Delts
might have won. Their five runs
were put over in the last two in
nings.
SECOND BASEMAN Shelham
mer stood out for the Phi Delts,
playing good defensive ball and
getting two hits, one a homer, in
three times at the plate.
Herb Eggleston and Wood looked
good for the Sigma Nu team. Eg
gleston, manager and pitcher, al
lowed seven hits but went the route
without too much trouble. Wood,
who batted out a homer for his
outfit, put on a good show in the
field.
The Phi Delt team, managed by
Paul Lawrence, announced that it
will split to give the league another
entry and give all the team mem
bers a chance to play. Tuesday, at

ternoon's play should see the new
group in action.
ENCINA CELLAR WON by de
fault from Branner I when the lat
ter team was able to field only four
players for their first game. Bran
ner manager Richardson forfeited
rather than play with a pickup out
fit.
The Legal Eagles also won via the
default route. Phi Psi failed to
show and thus lost their opening
contest.
In a special practice game the
Eagles clubbed out a 13 to 9 win
over Encina Cellar. The Cellar
gang, unofficially installed as a
prime league favorite, put across
nine runs in a wild first inning be
fore the lawyers called a halt to the
rout.
Intramural softball umpires are

still badly needed and will be paid
$1 per game. Anyone interested
should contact Intramural Director
Elwyn Bugge at the men's gymna
sium.
