# Welch Recruits Salvation Choir
## 
### 
Among the most difficult of the
problems yet faced by Barbara
Welch, director of "The Time of
Your Life," the Stanford Players'
forthcoming production, was the
finding of a Salvation Army choir.
The script as written by William
Saroyan calls for an off-stage Sal
vation Army choir to sing a hymn
during the play. Miss Welch solved
the problem by recruiting an ama
teur song group from the members
of the cast and idle Drama depart
ment students. The evening air
around Memorial Hall now carries
the moving strains of "Washed in
the Blood of the Lamb." Experts
say the choral stacks up well beside
their professional street-corner ri
vals.
"The Time of Your Life" is in its
last week of rehearsal. It will be
produced next week. July 17, 18, 19,
and 20. in the Little Theater of
Memorial Hall. Tickets sell for 90
cents and there are still some avail
able for the performances on the
17th and 18th. They may be ob
tained at the box office in the rear
of Memorial Hall.
