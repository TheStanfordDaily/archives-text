# Bartky Will Address Phi Delia Kappa Dinner
## 
### 
Dean A. John Bartky will speak
tonight to the Phi Delta Kappa fra
ternity on "The Implications in the
Navy Training Program for Civilian
Training" at a dinner meeting at
Wilson's restaurant in Palo Alto.
Dean Bartky, new Dean of the
School of Education, served with the
Navy as assistant director of train
ing during the war. The purpose of
his talk will be to discredit vicious
attacks against the war training
programs of the Army and Navy.
Dr. Bartky plans to explain that
the Armed Forces claimed nothing
new in their training programs but
did the best they could under the
circumstances. He says that the
Armed Forces developed no new
methods of training but merely cop
ied the ideas already in use by ci
vilian schools. Members who at
tend will be charged 50 cents for
the meal; for visitors the charge will
be $1.50.
