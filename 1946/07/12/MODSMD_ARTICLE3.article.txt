### 
World-wide message service for
Stanford students via the "ham"
airlines was established yesterday
by the Stanford Radio Club.
Student messages of an essential
nature will be accepted for code or
voice transmission at the Electrical
Engineering Department, room 509,
where message forms and full infor
mation will be made available.
Delivery of the messages at for
eign points depends on W6YX's abil
ity to contact an amateur near the
point.

Areas that have been reached
by WtiYX are listed in order of
ease of contact. The time when
messages must be sent is also
noted.
Area Time

Japan Early morning
or late evening
South Africa Early morning
U.S. East Coast Early morning
Alaska Uncertain
South America Late afternoon
Dutch East Indies Early morning
China Early morning
North Africa Uncertain
Europe. Russia, and India arc
poor contact areas.

FOREIGN AMATEURS are usu
ally happy to deliver messages or
to arrange voice contacts if the
messages are of a reasoriably seri
ous nature. The Stanford Club will
not accept messages of the "having
a wonderful time" variety but will
ask that applicants for the service
have a legitimate reason.
Another limiting factor on the
service is the full-study schedules
of the licensed operators.
However, the Radio Club will
make every effort to move the traf
fic requested of it by students, ac
cording to Oswald G. Villard. Jr.,
club trustee.
At the meeting inaugurating the
service, Radio Club elected S. F.

vice-president; and B. Wambsganss.
secretary-treasurer.
