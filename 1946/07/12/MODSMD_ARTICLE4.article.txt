# Shortages Slow Dibble Progress
## 
### 
Nearing the end of the first week
of work on reconverting Dibble
General Hospital progress was be
ing slowed by a serious shortage of
carpenters and materials.
Visiting the project yesterday, a
Daily reporter found only two car
penters and a laborer on the scene,
in addition to project supervisor Ar
thur O. Heeszel and a timekeeper.
HEESZEL EXPRESSED belief the
carpenter situation would improve
in the near future, but at the same
time urged that any persons at Stan
ford interested in a part or full-time
job as carpenter or laborer contact
him at the contractor's office at Dib
ble.
The work is being done by Leo
Epp. Inc., a San Francisco firm, un
der a contract let by the FPHA
which specifies that the job be com
pleted by Sept. 14. Due to the labor
and material shortage, however, it
is considered doubtful that the proj
ect will be completed in that time,
though Mr. Heeszel is working on
the premise that Dibble will be
ready for occupation by that date.
AT PRESENT work is confined to
one building, which is being made
into one- and two-bedroom apart
ments.
Completed plans, recently re
ceived, are chalked out on the floor
of one ward, giving a clear picture
of how the apartments for married
couples will be arranged.
