"The Sacred Cow" landed in
Washington yesterday, bringing
Secretary Byrnes, Senator Con
nally, and Senator Vandenberg
home from the Paris conference.
President Truman met them at
the airport. In the conversation,
Vandenberg asked the President
about the OPA bill. Truman an
swered. "In terrible shape. Couldn't
be worse."
So, unless the House or the con
ference committee prunes some of

the Senate's re
strictions out of
the measure, ap
parently we may
look for another
veto. The House
will take up the
bill tomorrow, but
the Administra
tion leaders are
not very confi
dent.

Prices and rents have increased
as predicted, labor leaders are mut
tering about wage increases, a few
"buyers' strikes" have developed,
there has been no overpowering
"radioactive cloud" of general pub
lic opinion for complete and imme
diate restoration of the OPA. This
discounts, of course, the efforts of
the CIO, the AVC, and other pres
sure groups to organize opinion.
One thing is certain. Most of the
blame for killing OPA, if blame
there is to be, lies on the Republi
can members of the Congress.
The Conference of Foreign Min
isters ended last week in a sad
ideological discord over German
occupation policies. Russia re
fused to set up a joint administra
tion of the four zones of Germany
on U.S. terms; France and Brit
ain are reported to have tenta
tively agreed to join the U.S. in
a tri-zonal economic . administra
tion. France excepted the Saar '
valley, to which she has long
standing claims as part of France
proper, from the arrangement,
however.
Although the conference did not
end "on a note of triumph," Secre
tary Byrnes stated on arrival back
in Washington that we had made
"some progress on the road back to
peace." Let us be thankful.
The passing by Congress of the
British loan was the top story in
the London papers yesterday. In
excited and very human fashion,
the lead stories detailed all the
things the loan could mean to Mr.
and Mrs. John Bull: more food,
more clothes, more gasoline, a lit
tle more of almost everything.
The three billion lent will be
spent solely for U.S. products.
