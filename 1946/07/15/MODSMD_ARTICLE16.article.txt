WHAT'S WRONG WITH "DIBBLE"?
The Daily's contest to find a new name for the Dibble Hos
pital area which will house 2,700 Stanford men and women be
gins today.
Several people have asked for our reasons for wishing a
change in the name which served the area so well during the
war, a name honored both by the career of General Dibble and
by the work of the institution named for him.
One reason we favor a change is that the area is now to be
a residential area for people whose activities and interests are
happily to be devoted to peaceful pursuit of education, not to
repairing bodies broken in wars. It will be as much a home to
these people as is possible, and they will enjoy it more if they
do not have to be reminded continually that their homes were
once the scenes of war's misery.
More important is the fact that the residents of the new area
will be Stanford students in every sense of the word. Every
plan now being laid on the campus for their education calls for
emphasis on their integration into the main stream of the uni
versity, not their separation. The planners wish to avoid any
feeling on the part of the newcomers that they are step-children
of the Stanford family, temporary "oakies" who will move on.
One sure way to foster such a feeling is to refer to their
living guarters as "Vet Burg" or "The Annex," or, we think,
"Dibble."
Surely some name can be found for this area which will tie
into Stanford and or Peninsula history.
The Daily feels a new name for the area could well mean the
difference between a strong feeling of wholeness and a subtle
strain of separatism on the campus in these coming years of a
7,000-man Stanford.
