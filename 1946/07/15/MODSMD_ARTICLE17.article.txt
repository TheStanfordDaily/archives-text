I have just had the very un
pleasant task of reading an ex
tremely bad book — "Then and
Now" (Harper: $2.50) by W. Som
erset Maugham. This is a novel of
the Renaissance about Machiavel
li, Caesar Borgia, and some sex
appeal called Aurelia. It was
printed serially recently in a
widely circulated magazine.
To say that a novel by Maugham

is bad is to invite a good deal of
argument. So well established is
Maugham's "distinguished literary
reputation" that it is with a good
deal of trepidation that I state that
Maugham has written more poor
books than fair ones and that this
most recent book of his is the worst
book that I have had the misfor
tune to read in the last five years.
Maugham wished to say one
thing. He should have written an
essay to say it. It comes as the
last paragraph of the book:
"In this world of sin and sorrow
if virtue triumphs over vice, it is
not because it is virtuous, but be
cause it has better and bigger
guns; if honesty prevails over
double-dealing, it is not because it
is honest, but because it has a
stronger army more ably led. . . .
It is well to have right on our side,
but it is madness to forget that
unless we have might as well it
will avail us nothing."
This is neither a very profound
statement nor a very original one.
It may be found in "The Prince
and Discourses of Machiavelli"
(Modern Library: 95 cents) which
is an infinitely better book selec
tion for today than "Then and
Now."—Bowman
