We might adapt for the artist
the joke about there being nothing
more dangerous than the instru
ments of war in the hands of gen
erals. In the same way, there is
nothing more dangerous than jus
tice in the hands of a judge, and
a paint brush in the hands of a
painter! Just think of the danger
to society! But today wo haven't
the heart to expel the painters and
the poets because we no longer
admit to ourselves that there is
any change in keeping them in
our midst.â€”Pablo Picasso
