## Bull Session 
### 
The pressure has been too great.
I give up. No more diatribes
against cuddling and slacks and

shorts on the
Quad and in
the Libe. Let
joy be unre
fined and them
wpt want to
cuddle and
nuzzle and
frolic about in
shorts and
slacks cuddle
and nuzzle and
frolic.

The scoffing and jeers have come
from all quarters. Elinor Cogs
well, editor of the Palo Alto
Times, pointed out in her column
(we read each other's, it would
appear) that next to my first col
umn there appeared a "cheese
cake" of a Hollywood lovely clad
"somewhat" in a bathing suit. Miss
Cogswell concluded, in view of the
euties, "it looks like a tough fight
ahead for the 'old guard'."
NEXT TO VOICE criticism was
a professor who said that his wife
was now afraid to walk across the
Quad with him hand-in-hand. I
don't dare criticize faculty love—
especially when I need a B in the
course.
A transfer from Mills told me in
no uncertain terms that girls at
that East Bay institution no longer
go to class in jeans and plaid
shirts. They used to but maybe
Lynn White's ascendancy to the
presidency changed it all.
The final blows came in rapid
succession. My agent reported
her agents told her there were
men in the PO in shorts (swim
ming, that is).
AM) ACCORDING to unusu
ally unreliable sources close to
the inside it was reported that a
group of girls were planning a
campaign to do away with jeans
for men. I gladly forsake my
campaign in order to prevent any
such movement from gaining head
way.
The crowning blow—and here I
bite at the hand (a lovely hand,
too) that fed me —was Saturday
luncheon in Lagunita. I realize
now that the things I complained
about in Libe apparel were mild
indeed. It could be much, much
worse.
