# Ziegfeld Follies—Real Fine!
## 
### 
If you go for beautiful women, songs, dances, and funnv
stories (and who doesn't) then "The Ziegfeld Follies" is the
picture for you. Everyone on the M-G-M lot from Esther Wil
liams to Red Skelton have the time of their lives in technicolor,
and they do a job that must make old Flo Ziegfeld righteously
happy wherever he may be.
The powers-that-be have mercifully dispensed with any form
of a plot and concentrated on the laughs and pulchritude.

There is dancing by Fred Astaire
and Lucille Bremer. There is sing
ing by Lena Home and Virginia
O'Brien. There are funny stories
by Red Skelton and Victor Moore.
Keenan Wynn works a telephone
gag all out of proportion. In fact,
"The Ziegfeld Follies" is a solid
hour and a half of good clean fun.
Also playing on the same bill is
"Strange Triangle" which is not
so funny. Featured are Preston
Foster, Signe Hasso and John
Shepherd. (Now playing at Stan
ford Theater.) —Heintze
