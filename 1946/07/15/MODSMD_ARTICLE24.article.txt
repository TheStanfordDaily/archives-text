It's football in midsummer. That's
right; there's no mistake. It's only
July but already football is in the
air. Tomorrow, three teams of the
newly organized Ail-American Con
ference, the new professional foot
ball league, open practice here on
the Pacific Coast.
The Chicago Rockets, coached by
Dick Hanley and Ernie Novel's,
Stanford's all-time great fullback,
will train in Santa Rosa, the Brook
lyn Dodgers in Bend, Ore., and the
New York Yankees in Spokane,
Wash. The San Francisco. '49ers do
not go into training until the first of
August at neighboring Menlo J.C.
THOUGH LEAGUE play does not
begin until Sept. 8, the first game
will be played in Kezar Stadium,
San Francisco, between the San
Francisco '49ers and the Chicago
Rockets for charity.
What has all this got to do with
Stanford? Plenty! Using a l 'T" for
mation, Coach Buck Shaw will have
the use of four former Indians well
taught in this attack and all Rose
Bowl veterans. Frankie Albert will
play at quarter, Norm Standlee at
full, Bruno Banducci at tackle, and
Hank Norberg at end.
JOINING THIS QUARTET are
such great All-American stars as
Lenny Eshmont from Fordham,
Parker Hall from Mississippi and
the Cleveland Rams, Kenny Casa
nega from Santa Clara, Bob Titche
nal from San Jose State, Don Dur
dan from Oregon State, Nick Suso
eff from Washington State, Bill
Fisk from U.S.C.. Pete Franceschi
from U.S.F., Dick Bassi from Santa
Clara, and many others.
WITH THIS ARRAY of material,
we don't see how the '49ers can miss
in winning the conference. The
baekfield, we believe, is an improve
ment over our Rose Bowl baekfield.
In Kmetovic's left half spot, Shaw
will probably uSe Len Eshmont.
With due respect to Pete, we think
that Eshmont is superior. Those
who have seen Eshmont playing
for the Bay Area pre-flight schools
in the last few years will agree with
that. Kmetovic, though, is still a
great player in our book.
IN GALLARNEAU'S right half
position will probably be Parker
Hall. Besides being a great runner,
Hall can pass, block, and punt with
the best of them. After seeing both
Hall and Gallarneau play, great as
they both are, we feel Hall is the
better man. Hall knows the "T" as
he was quarterback last year with
that system for St. Mary's Pre-
Flight.
When men like Casanega and
Durdan have to ride the bench, the
team must be good.
JIM LAWSON. FORMER assist
ant coach on the Farm, will assist
Shaw. For those interested in see
ing this team headed by Albert and
Standlee in action, not one of their
games coincides with any of Stan
ford's contests. All their games will
be played on Sunday outside of two.
They play Buffalo the same Sat
urday Stanford travels to Corvallis
for the Oregon State game, and
their other Saturday contest falls
after our season ends. All home
games will be played at Kezar.
WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, this
team was selected from former Pa
cific Coast college stars. We feel
that this group is strong enough to
take the league championship and
prove the contention that the Pa
cific Coast is equal, if not superior,
to the rest of the country as far as
football is concerned.
