# SONA Ranks Favorite As Murals Enter Second Week
## 
### 
Intramural softball enters its sec
ond week with a revised set-up in
league personnel. Because of the'
failure of Branner and Encina IE
to field teams last Thursday, they
have been dropped from their re
spective leagues.
The Delta Upsilon fraternity re
places Branner in League I, and the
educational fraternity, Phi Delta
Kappa, has split into two teams with
their number 2 outfit replacing En
cina 3E in League 11.
INTRAMURAL DIRECTOR El
wyn Bugge urges all team managers
who cannot field teams as sched
uled to let him know as soon as
possible at the Encina Gym on
telephone 6171.
Encina Cellar and Encina lE,
which were to have played the two
teams that dropped out last Thurs
day, were not credited with a win.
Those games missed will be played
off at a later date.
SONA, THE NAVY outfit, easily
looked like the best aggregation in
either league last week when they
had little trouble in rapping the ball
to all corners in defeating the Fire
house, usually a strong mural con
tender.
The Firehouse claimed that pitch
er George Smith was using an ille
gal pitch. When called upon to
rule on this, Bugge declared that if
this pitch was illegal, so was the
pitch used by all the softball pitch
ers in Palo Alto. What the Fire
house can do against ''legal" pitch
ing will be seen in their game with
the Phi Delta Kappa squad tomor
row.
IN THE MEANTIME, SONA
should have little trouble in defeat
ing Encina 1W which was soundly
beaten by the Chi Psi's Thursday.
Bobby Rosburg of the Chi Psi house
goes after his second win against
the previously untested Encina IE
squad.
Over in League I. Sigma Nu,

which staggered in with a one-run !
win over Phi Delta Kappa last
week, come up against the D.U.'s in
that team's first game.
TIIE LEGAL EAGLES beat En
cina Cellar in a practice game and
therefore must be considered the j
favorites in their contest with the
educational fraternity tomorrow. |
The Cellar comes up against the Phi
Psi's and should notch up their first i
win, for the Phi Psi's have yet to
field a team.
Intramural softball umpires are :
still badly needed and will be paid J
$1 per game.

INTRAMURAL DIRECTOR El
wyn Bugge urges all team managers
who cannot field teams as sched
uled to let him know as soon as
possible at the Encina Gym on
telephone 6171.
Encina Cellar and Encina lE,
which were to have played the two
teams that dropped out last Thurs
day, were not credited with a win.
Those games missed will be played
off at a later date.
SONA, THE NAVY outfit, easily
looked like the best aggregation in
either league last week when they
had little trouble in rapping the ball
to all corners in defeating the Fire
house, usually a strong mural con
tender.
The Firehouse claimed that pitch
er George Smith was using an ille
gal pitch. When called upon to
rule on this, Bugge declared that if
this pitch was illegal, so was the
pitch used by all the softball pitch
ers in Palo Alto. What the Fire
house can do against ''legal" pitch
ing will be seen in their game with
the Phi Delta Kappa squad tomor
row.
IN THE MEANTIME, SONA
should have little trouble in defeat
ing Encina 1W which was soundly
beaten by the Chi Psi's Thursday.
Bobby Rosburg of the Chi Psi house
goes after his second win against
the previously untested Encina IE
squad.
Over in League I. Sigma Nu,

which staggered in with a one-run !
win over Phi Delta Kappa last
week, come up against the D.U.'s in
that team's first game.
TIIE LEGAL EAGLES beat En
cina Cellar in a practice game and
therefore must be considered the j
favorites in their contest with the
educational fraternity tomorrow. |
The Cellar comes up against the Phi
Psi's and should notch up their first i
win, for the Phi Psi's have yet to
field a team.
Intramural softball umpires are :
still badly needed and will be paid J
$1 per game.
Intramural softball enters its sec
ond week with a revised set-up in
league personnel. Because of the'
failure of Branner and Encina IE
to field teams last Thursday, they
have been dropped from their re
spective leagues.
The Delta Upsilon fraternity re
places Branner in League I, and the
educational fraternity, Phi Delta
Kappa, has split into two teams with
their number 2 outfit replacing En
cina 3E in League 11.
