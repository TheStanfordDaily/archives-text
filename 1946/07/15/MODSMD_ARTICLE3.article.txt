# Prize Play Begins Run Wednesday
## 
### 
"The Time of Your Life" by Wil
liam Saroyan, the only play to win
both the Pulitzer Prize and the New
York Critics' Circle award, will be
presented by the Stanford Players
beginning Wednesday evening in
the Little Theater of Memorial Hall.
THE PLAY, WHICH takes place
in Nick's San Francisco waterfront
bar, is a comedy in five acts, and
has as many characters and fea
tures as a three-ring circus. Be
sides the usual policemen, long
shoremen, streetwalkers, and just
plain bums that one would expect
to find in a San Francisco drinking
emporium, there appears an old In
dian scout named Kit Carson who
used to herd cattle on a bicycle, an
Arab, and a sensational song and
dance man named Harry.
THE MOKE SERIOUS side of the
drama is handled by Newton Ar
nold who plays Joe, a mysterious
man of money who is also a phi
losopher. Kitty, a burlesque queen
of somewhat dubious background,
is portrayed by Marie Selland, and
Tom, who is Joe's close friend and
errand boy extraordinary, is played
by Bob O'Brien.
Julio Francescotti is cast as Nick,
the owner of Nick's bar, and the
villain. Bliek, will be portrayed by
Esdras Hartley.
''The Time of Your Life" will run
for a series of four performances:
July 17, 18, 19. and 20.
