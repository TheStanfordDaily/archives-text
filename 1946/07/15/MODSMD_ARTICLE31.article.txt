# Trends of Modernism in Art, Architecture Shown in Exhibit
## 
### 
Modern trends in art and archi
tecture are epitomized in the cur
rent exhibition of the work of
Charles Edouard Jeanneret (Le
Corbusier). The exhibit at the
Stanford Art Gallery draws on the
artist's work as writer, painter, and
architect.
Material for the exhibit has been
arranged by George A. Harris, act
ing gallery director. Attractive
panels and photographs are com
bined with actual work by Le Cor
busier.
IN 1 }127 LE CORBUSIER'S design
won the prize for the Geneva Pal
ace of the League of Nations. Among
his other notable works in archi
tecture is the Swiss government
building for nationals studying in
Paris, the Cite Universitaire, and
the Salvation Army City of Refuge
building in Paris.
On exhibit here are four of Le
Corbusier's oil "Compositions," 1929-
30.
ALSO TO BE SEEN is a series
of 29 drawings in brush and ink,
crayon and pencil, water color and
silverpoint. The silverpoint draw
ings appear as a transition between
Le Corbusier's academic knowledge
of figure and still-life and his con
cern for architectural phenomena.
In the artist's recent brush and

crayon drawings of figures and
sccnes outside French influences are
revealed. Matisser Roualt, Toulouse-
Lautrec and Braque are important
for an understanding of Le Corbu
sier's drawings.
MOSX NOTABLE of this versa
tile Frenchman's achievements have
been in architecture. His designs
interpenetrate the outer space with
building interior, so that space it
self becomes a continuous factor,
articulated rather than stopped up.
This is achieved by the use of the
pillar as a thing of beauty and not
disguised in walls, using the wall as
defense against the elements and
for dividing space, but not as sup
port for the roof, and by using the
roof itself as an area for living.
Le Corbusier's attitude is exem
plified in his writing, for with Der
mee and Ozenfant he was a founder
of the publication L'Esprit Nouvcau.
