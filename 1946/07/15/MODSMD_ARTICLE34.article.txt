# Future Gloomy for Jobs In Small Businessesâ€”Bush
## 
### 
Discussing trends in job place
ment of college graduates Wednes
day night before the AVC in the
Nitery, Dr. Robert N. Bush of the
Stanford Appointment Service de
clared that the cards were stocked
against employment in small busi
ness.
Following the trend toward larger
and larger units of business in
America, Bush is certain that in a
few years the number of small own
erships in fields open to college stu
dents would be decidedly dimin
ished.
IN OTHER FIELDS Bush was ex
tremely optimistic, citing the pro
fessions, medicine, law, engineering,
and business, as fields where job
opportunities would still be avail
able in three or four years.
Although the general conception
seems to be that the field of engi
neering is filled, Bush quoted sta
tistics showing that present classes
are fully 40 per cent below normal
and demand should be high in a
few years.
SHORTAGES IN SECONDARY
and college - level instructors are
apparent today, and should continue
during the next few years. This
makes education another field wor
thy of the undergraduate's atten
tion.
During business session of AVC,
Miss Sylvia Barrie was elected tem
porary secretary, and Tully Warren
treasurer. Joe Dye, a former pa
tient at Dibble Hospital, was ap
pointed chairman of the important
Veterans' Affairs Committee, which

Ls primarily interested in Dibble at
present.
Petitions demanding a return of
the OPA were handed out at the
Wednesday meeting, and are now
being circulated on campus. When
signed they will be sent to Con
gressman Anderson and Senators
Knowland and Downey.
