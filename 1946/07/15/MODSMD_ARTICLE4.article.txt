# Ham Transmission Procedures Told
## 
### 
Essential message service to all
world points where amateur radios
can be contacted is being offered by
the Stanford Radio Club. Belore
planning messages or asking for
voice schedule, a copy of the send
ing procedure should be secured
from room 509, Electrical Engineer
ing Department, or by calling ex
tension 330 and receiving a copy by
mail.
Messages should be written out
on appropriate forms provided and
a brief explanation of why the
transmission is essential included.
The addressee's name and phone
number, when possible, should be
included to aid in transmission. Re
quests for voice transmission should
include times of contact and when
you will be able to come to the
VVGYX shack.
The greatest difficulty in trans
mission of messages is contacting
amateur radio stations in the desired
area. All "ham" operators are glad
to deliver messages as long as they
are of an essential nature. Time
schedules must be worked out and
weather conditions for transmission
must be considered.
Still another difficulty is the fact
that all the licensed operators in the
Radio Club have full study sched
ules and must co-ordinate trans
mission and available time.
Although the club trustee. Os
wald G. Villard. Jr.. has stated that
every effort will be made to handle
the essential - message traffic, it
must be realized that certain diffi
culties exist and that sending mes
sages may take time.
