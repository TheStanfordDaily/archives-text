Sure Cure
For Lockout-itis
I~EN. when your date suffers •
Iy 1 lockout, be sure she gets
pound or two of Wilson s
candies the very next day. Ir
doesn't make a bit of difference
whose "fault" it is that she got iti
late. Never, never, never let that
lockout go unsweetened!
And sweeten it with a box of
■'Sticky" Wilson's chocolates! It's i.
tradition that had its start hack in
'9(J when "Sticky" was a Stanford)
student. And it's a SURE cure to
"lockout-itis"!
