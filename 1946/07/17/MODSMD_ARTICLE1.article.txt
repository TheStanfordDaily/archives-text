One ray r. light was admitted I

by Vandenberg's
speech in the
Senate yesterday.
He said that his
experiences at the
Paris conference
convinced him the
Eastern and the
Western ideolo
gies can find a
common ground
on which to meet.

After impassioned pleading by
House Administration leaders, the
Senate price-control bill ('"could
n't be worse") was turned over to
a Senate-House conference com- i
mittee yesterday for re-writing.
This, however, does not guarantee [
quick realization of President Tru
man's hopes for a workable price
control measure. Rep. Jesse Wol
cott, R., Mich., asked that the bill
be sent to a conference committee I
so that it could be further amended
to favor manufacturers as much as I
it already favors farmers.
The UAW's Walter Reuther has j
proclaimed a buyers' strike this
week against high meat prices, and
has asked nation - wide consumer j
support. Next week the union will i
ride against rent increases, and af
ter that against various other in
flated goods and services.
The House has voted to take up
the domestic atomic energy con
trol bill.
Arising out of that, let me men- j
tion the Russian journalist Ilya Eh- I
renburg who just completed a tour
of the U.S. Ehrenburg denounced
yesterday, in a Moscow paper, "pro
vincial dummies in the U.S. who
think that they can control the
atom bomb with Esperanto."
The Congressional committee
investigating the I'earl Harbor af
fair is preparing to release its re
port. A majority will blame it on
General Short and Admiral Kim
mel, and on their superiors in the
War and Navy Departments. A
Republican minority report, blam
ing the White House and State
Department, will also be made.
