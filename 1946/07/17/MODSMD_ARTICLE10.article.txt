# "Time of Your Life" Tonight
## 
### CARL HEINTZE 
William Saroyan's "The Time of
Your Life" will begin a series of
four sold-out performances tonight
at 8:15 in the Little Theater of Me
morial Hall.
The play, which is to be presented
in five instead of the usual three
acts, takes place in Nick's water
front bar on Pacific Street in San
Francisco. The set. which was de
signed by John Sollers, features a
bar in the old mirror-and-stained
oak tradition, and the barroom is j
complete with a large pin ball ma- |
chine and a juke box which really j
plays.
BECAUSE OF THE large number
of characters in the cast, the set was
particularly difficult to construct,
according to Mr. Sollers.
Among the numerous characters
who drift in and out of Nick's bar .
are Joe, whose philosophy bears a j
close resemblance to that of Mr.
William Saroyan, played by New
ton Arnold; Tom. Joe's buddy and
chief confidant, portrayed by Bob
O'Brien; Kitty, a lady of dubious
virtue with a beautiful soul, played
by Marie Selland; Nick, himself, the
owner of Nick's bar, played by Ju
lio Francescotti; Harry, a hoofer,
played by Bob Ashley; and Kit Car- j
son, an old Indian fighter, portrayed
by Jay Cline.
'The Time of Your Life" is one
of the most frequently presented j
modern American plays. Its author,
William Saroyan, self - acclaimed j
world's greatest writer, is the ere- j
ator of a large volume of plays, j
short stories, and two novels. 'The
Human Comedy," which was made
