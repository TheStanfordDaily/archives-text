ANSWERING MAIL
An avalanche of mail—two let
ters—greeted the Bull Sessioner
after announcement he was aban-

don in g his
campaign
against cu d -
dli n g and
shorts. One
letter, with
i'ootnotes yet,
was of the
scurrilous,
nameless type,
signed "Two
Lag Girls" —
and smeared
with gooey

war paint. The letter's point:
"Let's have less campaigning and
more material of interest." Touche!
The other, 112 rom a prominent mu
sician, approved our stand and said
he could stand us three times a
week. Thanx.
The point is, readers, we are still
against slacks, shorts and cuddling,
but feel that griping about it in
print continually won't do any
good. The .problem is evident. Let
public opinion chew on it.

Smiley Farkas, who has hereto
fore been stridently against liv
ing in barracks at Dibble Hospi
tal. tells me he has changed his
mind and is now throbbing with
desire to live in the new dormi
tory area. He feels that his rea
son will undoubtedly cause oth
ers of the "anti-barracks" set to
change their minds.
His reason—one never pointed
out before, I understand—is that
Dibble is but one short block
away from a famous athletic club
—"The Oasis." He wants to know,
pridefully now, what other dor
mitory can boast such service and
accommodations. None that we
know of.

Here are the three latest rumors
— I said RUMOURS and mean
just that — floating about regard
ing Stanford and its problems:
1. The tuition, slated to be
boosted, will be $180 per quarter.
I can't believe it myself; $160
would be nearer. Both would be
bad. Say it isn't so.
2. Men now living in Branner
will be moved out fall quarter to
live in Dibble. On behalf of my
Branner constituency again I say.
"Say it won't be so."
3. The new Dean of Women will
be selected from outside of Stan
ford. Good!
