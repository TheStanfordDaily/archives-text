Jeans found a new cause of ulcers!
Mills College professors may be
afflicted with ulcers, I don't know,
I haven't delved into their medical
histories; but Mills girls do not
attend classes in jeans and plaid
shirts, in fact, such attire is strict
ly taboo for any academic appoint
ments. In extra-curricular activi
ties, however, the mode of dress is
strictly up to the student.
How 'bout that motto. Mr. Kres
ge? "Get it first, but first get it
right."
