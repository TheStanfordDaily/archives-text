edged Encina 1W 15 to 12 in a free- I
hitting contest to tie with Chi Psi j
for the lead.
Encina IE got off to a good start
in their game with Chi Psi when
they nicked Chi hurler Ed Luce for
four runs in the firsf*'inning, but the
tong men came back with an eight
run explosion in the third and went |
on to win the game 15 to 7.
THE FIREHOUSE PUT IN a new j
pitcher. Rusty Gates, and he twirled
the Firemen to a 20-5 victory over
Phi Delta Ka]3pa 11.
In League I competition. Corky
Schriber and Bob Barsochini pitched i
Delta Upsilon to a 3-1 victory over
Sigma Nu. The D.U.'s, making their
debut in circuit play, displayed un
expected power. Howie Hoffman,
S.N. catcher, looked good for the
losers.
Bob Stephens, Phi Psi pitcher
manager, hurled his outfit to a 7-2
decision over an unexpectedly weak
Encina Cellar team.
PHI DELTA KAPPA 1 dropped
to the circuit cellar when they lost
8-7 to the Legal Eaales. Burt Tal

eott pitched shutout ball for the j
victors until the latter stages of the
game, when the P.D.K.'s, led by cen
ter fielder Martin Katz, batted their
way into the lead. Eagle plate pow- i
er proved too much for them, how- i
ever, and their two runs in the last |
of the seventh won the game.
