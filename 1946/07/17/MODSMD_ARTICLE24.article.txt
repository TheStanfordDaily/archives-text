# India Faces Famine-- Kurban Tells 'I' Club
## 
### 
Fifteen million persons —approximately one-ninth of the popu
lation of the United States—will starve to death in India during
the coming year.
That is what Fazal E. Kurban, member of the working com
mittee of the All-India Trade Union Congress, told an Interna-

tional Club audience last Monday"
evening in the Women's Clubhouse.
ALTHOUGH INDIA was self
sufficient before the war, unusually
heavy rains have destroyed a large
part of the crops, according to Mi\
Kurban. Already, food shortages
have been reported in Bengal and
Southern India.
While UNRRA has provided some
help, little assistance on a wide
spread scale can be expected in
India, said Mr. Kurban. Rice and
wheat are the main food crops in
India.
Asserting that the rising cost of
living in India accentuates the threat
of starvation, Mr. Kurban pointed
out that the average wage of the
workingman there is 37 cents per
day while food prices are almost
equal to those in the United States.
DURING THE WAR, wages rose
only about 100 per cent while the
of living index is up 500 per
cent, he said.
The All-India Trade Union Con
gress is at present limited in its
activities, he said, but is steadily
gaining power. It is similar to the
CIO.
Prior to Mr. Kuban's talk, the In
ternational Club held a reorganiza
tional meeting. The following offi
cers were elected: Ganti Surah
manyam, president; Phyllis Kalen
bron. social chairman; Elena Vas
covi, secretary; Dorothy Bailey,
treasurer.
