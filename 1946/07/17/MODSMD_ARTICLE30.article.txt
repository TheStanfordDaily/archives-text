## 
### 
With a flash of hoofs and a cry of
"Hi! Ho! Cubberley Auditorium!"
Jiggs McCauley announced the
movie scheduled for next Sunday
is "Arizona," starring Jean Arthur.
Also on the bill are chapters three
and four of "The Secret of Treasure
Island." This, according to Mc-
Cauley, is full of chills, thrills and
spills, guaranteed to make the hair
defy the laws of gravity.
