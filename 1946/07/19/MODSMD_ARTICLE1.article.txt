The apparent election of Gene
Talmadge as Governor of Georgia is
as widely deprecated in these parts

as would be a
raise in tuition.
But it is not ouri
affair. The "pee-1
pul" of Georgia,'
or a large num-i
ber of them, have
spoken. If theyj
desire to label;
themselves before]
all the world asj
endorsing "Red-^

Gallu.s" Gene and all his ways and
works, to state publicly and irre
well, that's their business. They're
welcome to him, too.
DEVELOPMENTS ON THE OPA
front: The Senate-House confer
ence committee on the price-con
trol bill has deadlocked over "de
controlling" farm products. The
question has been sent to a three
man sub-committee. Governor War
ren of California has called a special
session of the State Legislature to
consider rent and eviction control
bills which, if passed as proposed,
would substantially re-enact OPA
rent rules —although allowing limit
ed rent increases. In Chicago, yester
day, there was a marked slump in
"on the hoof" meal prices.
DEVELOPMENTS ON THE labor
front: The CIO has demanded that
President Truman call a national la
bor-industry conference to consider
wage policies in line with expected
higher prices. The CIO divided Cali
fornia into two "regions," thus de
priving Harry Bridges of a portion of
his jurisdiction. And live CIO union
officials employed at Aberdeen Prov
ing Ground were discharged yester
day by the War Department upon
"compelling evidence" of subversive
activities. The War Department de
nied that this was an attack on the
union involved.
As regards the division of Califor
nia into two CIO districts instead of
one, I do not regard this as primarily
a move against Bridges. It appears
• to me that the CIO is planning on as
sault on that citadel of the "open
shop," Los Angeles, and wants a man
on the job full time.
