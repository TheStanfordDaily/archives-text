# Stalnaker Describes Dibble Plans
## Discusses Dibble Setup with Collins Committee; Expects No Disputes 
### 
"It is an extremely tough problem that we faceâ€”not only a:
Dibble but for the entire University." Dean John Stalnaker
told a meeting of Bob Collins' Student Committee on Dibble las:
night.
He expressed belief, however, that no serious disputes would

arise because people are developing
a fuller understanding of the com-

plexities of the
(situation and
would have an
attitude more
sympathetic to
ward (he Admin
istration's difiieul
jties.
I Dean Stalnaker
and William H.
Miller, University
director of food
and housing, met

with the student group in order to
give an up-to-the-minute account of
how the Administration is handling
the situation and answer detailed
and general questions.
SOME OF THE FACTS AND
probabilities that came out in re
sponse to inquiries were:
There is a definite possibility, ac
cording to Miller, that housewives
will have to cook on kerosene stoves
next fall, as gas and electric facili
ties are not adequate.
Living assignments, including Dib
ble and on-campus dormitories, will
be made in advance of registration
next quarter, and. in so far as pos
sible, parties concerned will be no
tified ahead of time.

Dibble co-ordinator Bob Col
lins asked Stanford Excom Wed
nesday for definite action by Au
gust 1 011 the following three
proposals:
1. Plans for revision of the area
representation system to provide
representation lor students quar
tered at Dibble.
2. Approval of plans to have a
temporary body aid in setting up
the student government within
Dibble.
A. Plans to have specified peo
ple appointed immediately to
serve 011 fall Excom until an elec
tion system can be adopted.

ASSIGNMENTS, TO BE INI AUG
by the proposed student committee
in co-operation with Dean Stalna
ker, will not be made until as late
as possible, in order that persons
who have had a late change in their
housing situation, either because of
eviction or locating a residence, will
receive treatment in accordance with
their status as ol that date.
