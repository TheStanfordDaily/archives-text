RETRIBUTION
Because I opened my big mouth
in an endeavor to be humorous I
now find that some vituperative

; Lagunita girls
| with a lust for
| vengeance are
I bound I swallow
|bo th my feet.
(Mix that met
aphor! ) I sug
gested columns
ago, in reporting
on that living
group's highly
successful open
house, that at

the next the girls serving refresh
ments be released for combat as it
were. I find that I have conse
quently been appointd head of a
non - existent serving committee
for the next "Donnybrook Fair"—
scheduled for a week from tonight.
Appreciative(?) as I am of this
honor, I feel in my bones that my
great aunt Adah is about to pop in
from Mobile on a surprise visit.
She's most convenient about it,
y'know.

NOTE FOR THE POLITICAL
SCIENTISTS: Those fine and re
vered institutions, the General
Land Office and the U.S. Grazing
Service, have been combind by
Congress to make up a new agen
cy: the Land Management Bu
reau. We like the old titles better.
Might be a Poly Sci 100 paper in
this?

My Cellar agents report after
talking with the man who supplies
the records for the juke box that
said entrepreneur is planning on a
heavy emotional business for this
fall quarter. In an attempt to ca

of returnees he's going to put discs
in the machine that were in vogue
pre-war and the early war years.
Not a bad idea, I guess, just so
"You Are My Sunshine" isn't
among them.

Here's one candidate for the $25
prize for renaming Dibble that
won't win: Elbbid —which is Dib
ble spelled backward. Won't that
craze ever die?
