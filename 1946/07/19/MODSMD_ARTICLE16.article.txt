# 'The Unquiet Grave' Wins Bookworm
## 
### 
"The Unquiet Grave" (Harper,
$2.50) by Palinurus (Cyril Con
nolly) will be a valuable addition
to any library. It is the kind of
book, however, that is best read
in trains, on the Library steps, or
in the Cellar lobby—that is, read
anywhere that there is a good
likelihood of being interrupted ev
ery few minutes.
T do not recommend it for sus
tained reading, though, as it is very
little more than a delightful chaos
of paragraphs, epigrams, and quo
tations.
THE EXTENSIVENESS OF the
contents may be shown by quot
ing from the index: "G —Gibbon,
Gide, Gnosticism, God, Goethe,
Groddeck, Group Man; O—Obe
sity, Omar Khayyam, Opium,
Ovid; L—Lao-Tzu, Laziness. Le
muria, Lemuas, Lenin, Leopardi,
Lewis, Lobsters, Loco-weed, Lon
don. Lorca, Love."
Mr. Connolly, although relative
ly little known in the United
States, is one of the most impor
tant modern British critics. Of
"The Unquiet Grave" he writes:
"What follows are the doubts and
reflections of a year, a word-cycle
in three and four rhythms; art,
love, nature, and religion; an ex
periment in self-dismantling."
A READING KNOWLEDGE OF
French is recommended, but not
absolutely necessary, for Mr. Con
nolly draws heavily on the bulk of
French literature. One of the most
satisfactory sentences in the book,
for me at least, is a quotation at
tributed to Chamfort:
"A man must swallow a toad
every morning if he wishes to
be sure of finding nothing still
more disgusting before the day
is over."
"The Unquiet Grave," then, is
recommended without hesitation
for beautiful writing, extraordi
nary sensitivity, wide range of ex
perience and literature, and, most
of all, for understanding. Open the
book to any page, start reading,
and you will find yourself carried
hypnotically along.—Bowman
