# HOLMES ON TRUTH
## 
### 
When men have realized that
time has upset many fighting
faiths, they may come to believe
even more than they believe the
very foundations of their own con
duct that the ultimate good desired
is better reached by free trade in
ideas —that the best test of truth
is the power of the thought to get
itself accepted in he competition
of the market, and that truth is
the only ground upon which their
wishes safely can be carried out.
That at any rate is the theory of
our constitution. It's an experiment
as all life is an experiment.—Oli
ver Wendell Holmes
