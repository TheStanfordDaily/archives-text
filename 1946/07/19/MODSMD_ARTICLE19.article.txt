# If It's OK by Saroyan--It's OK by Us

For those who like William Saroyan (which includes this reviewer), Wednesday night's
production of "The Time of Your Life" was an enjoyable three hours. Those who don't like
Mr. Saroyan might as well stop reading right here because there will be no convincing you.

The current Stanford Players'
production of "The Time of Your
Life," which is probably the best
of Saroyan's several plays, is a
creditable professional job.

THE SET AS DESIGNED BY
John Sollers gives one the feel
ing of actually sitting in Nick's

Pacific Street
bar, and that
effect was un
doubtedly aid
ed by the Lit
tle Theater.
The greater
part of the act
ing was supe
rior. In a play
that has more
mood than ac-

tion, the emotional setting was
well maintained. Newton Arnold
was a very believable Joe, a char
acter who as written is not very
believable. Marie Selland gave a
tender and pitiable performance
as Kitty, the strip tease dancer
with a beautiful soul.
Bob O'Brien was a convincing
and lovable Tom. big and dumb
and trying very hard to under -
stand. Julio Francescotti gave a
better performance as Nick than
the professional whom this re
viewer saw in the San Francisco
road company production.
THE LARGE SUPPORTING
cast was excellent and it would be
hard to single out any one per
formance. Jay Cline's Kit Carson
was all the great barroom story
tellers rolled into one. Bob Ash
ley as Harry, Esdras Hartley as
Nick. Pat Neilson as Mary L.. and
Rees Behrendt as Dudley all add
ed to the general merriment by
solid performances.
A large share of credit should
go to Barbara Welch, who directed
"The Time of Your Life." The
play did not drag, nor were there
any tie-ups in staging despite the
fact that the Little Theater stage
is rather small for such a large
cast. The idea of including the
preface was also excellent and
added considerably to the under
standing of Saroyan's philosophy.
In fact, even Mr. Saroyan him
self, who Was in the first-night
audience, liked most of the pro
duction. He and his wife saw the
whole performance but fled just
before the final curtain. Evidently
the war has changed the world's
greatest writer.â€”Heintze
