# Germany In For Tougher Timeâ€”Brandt
## 
### TED NORTON 
"The German economy in the
Russian zone has reached rock
bottom, and it is going down hill
in the other zones." This is the con
clusion of Dr. Karl Brandt, econo
mist and professor of agricultural
economics in the Food Research In
stitute here, who has just returned
from four months' work in Ger
many.
His first visit to Germany since
he left in 1933, Dr. Brandt was act
ing as adviser on food and agricul
tural policies to the American Mili
tary Government, and on quadri
partite problems, as expert for the
American Level-of-Industry Com
mittee. under the Control Council.
DR. BRANDT EMPHASIZED
that, if we want to establish demo
cratic government in Germany, we
must first find answers to German
economic problems, which are es
sentially food and jobs. He pointed
out that, with six unem
ployed. Hitler had Rotten 45 per
cent of the vote, and that with 12
million unemployed, any daring
leader might seize power.
Saying that he had stressed the
point to no avail. Dr. Brandt pointed
out that either Americans will have
to spend hundreds of millions to
teed the German people or will have
to allow production of farm ma
chinery for the mechanization of
German agriculture.
QUESTIONED ABOUT ALLIED
disagreement on German adminis
tration. Dr. Brandt gave as his con
clusion that it would be better to
aim for greater co-operation, for a
central economic administration of
.-.11 four zones, although this would
result in a (low of capital from the
western zones to the stripped Rus
sian zone.
"If the western zones alone were
to be united," the economist said,
( 'it would result in a Chinese wall
down the middle of Germany, in
creased antagonism between Rus
sia and the Western Allies, and pos
sible future conflict."
