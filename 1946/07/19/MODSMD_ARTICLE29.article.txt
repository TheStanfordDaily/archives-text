# Ogg Reveals Discoveries
## 
### 
It has been announced that Dr.
Richard A. Ogg, Jr., associate pro
fessor of chemistry, has discovered
"about a dozen" major new phe
nomena in physics and physical
chemistry.
Dr. Ogg's studies into the proper
ties of metal - ammonia solutions
were begun independently about a
year ago and are now being con
tinued under the sponsorship of the
Navy Department's Office of Re
search and Inventions, which is also
.sponsoring a number of other re
search projects at Stanford.
THE RESULTS OF DR. OGG'S
indings are important in theoretical
">hysics but indicate possible prac
tical application in the transmission
of electricity without loss due to
•esistance.
Development of improved detec
tors of infra-red (invisible) light
■ays may also be possible because
112 this work. This is probably closer
"o realization than the electrical ap
plications.
Dr. Ogg's solutions can serve as
he light-sensitive surface from
vhich electrons are emitted when
-truck by infra-red rays. These
.•ays can be used in photography
and in communication as well as
for military purposes. <
DR. OGG'S SOLUTIONS "SHOW
the essential features of super-con
ductivity" at temperatures as high
as minus 85 degrees Centigrade.
Other known super-conductors must
be kept at a temperature approxi
mating absolute zero (minus 273 de
grees Centigrade).
The search for "super-conductors"
is an effort to find material which
Will transmit electricity without
floss due to resistance.
"While transmission of electricity
without resistance is not in sight at
the moment, one at least can begin
1o wonder about the possibilities of
j,uper-conductivity," says Dr. Ogg.
DR. OGG HAS ALSO SHOWN
that two electrons can occupy the
f.ame cavity to form a "disembodied
chemical bond." Ordinarily two
electrons hold together ,two atomic
nuclei but in these solutions the
electrons hold together without the
nuclei.
Dr. Ogg received his A.B. at Stan
ford in 1929 and his Ph.D. in 1932.
He spent the following year as a
National Research Fellow in Chem
istry at Harvard and in 1933-34 was
An Internal Research Fellow in
Chemistry at Victoria University,
Manchester, England.
He has been a member of the
Stanford faculty since 1935.
Dr. Ogg demonstrated the results
his super-conductivity investiga
tions at the July 12 meeting of the
Pacific Division of the American
Physical Society in Berkeley. He
las reported the other aspects of his
v.'ork in various scientific journals.

chemical bond." Ordinarily two
electrons hold together ,two atomic
nuclei but in these solutions the
electrons hold together without the
nuclei.
Dr. Ogg received his A.B. at Stan
ford in 1929 and his Ph.D. in 1932.
He spent the following year as a
National Research Fellow in Chem
istry at Harvard and in 1933-34 was
An Internal Research Fellow in
Chemistry at Victoria University,
Manchester, England.
He has been a member of the
Stanford faculty since 1935.
Dr. Ogg demonstrated the results
his super-conductivity investiga
tions at the July 12 meeting of the
Pacific Division of the American
Physical Society in Berkeley. He
las reported the other aspects of his
v.'ork in various scientific journals.
It has been announced that Dr.
Richard A. Ogg, Jr., associate pro
fessor of chemistry, has discovered
"about a dozen" major new phe
nomena in physics and physical
chemistry.
Dr. Ogg's studies into the proper
ties of metal - ammonia solutions
were begun independently about a
year ago and are now being con
tinued under the sponsorship of the
Navy Department's Office of Re
search and Inventions, which is also
.sponsoring a number of other re
search projects at Stanford.
THE RESULTS OF DR. OGG'S
indings are important in theoretical
">hysics but indicate possible prac
tical application in the transmission
of electricity without loss due to
•esistance.
Development of improved detec
tors of infra-red (invisible) light
■ays may also be possible because
112 this work. This is probably closer
"o realization than the electrical ap
plications.
Dr. Ogg's solutions can serve as
he light-sensitive surface from
vhich electrons are emitted when
-truck by infra-red rays. These
.•ays can be used in photography
and in communication as well as
for military purposes. <
DR. OGG'S SOLUTIONS "SHOW
the essential features of super-con
ductivity" at temperatures as high
as minus 85 degrees Centigrade.
Other known super-conductors must
be kept at a temperature approxi
mating absolute zero (minus 273 de
grees Centigrade).
The search for "super-conductors"
is an effort to find material which
Will transmit electricity without
floss due to resistance.
"While transmission of electricity
without resistance is not in sight at
the moment, one at least can begin
1o wonder about the possibilities of
j,uper-conductivity," says Dr. Ogg.
DR. OGG HAS ALSO SHOWN
that two electrons can occupy the
f.ame cavity to form a "disembodied
chemical bond." Ordinarily two
electrons hold together ,two atomic
nuclei but in these solutions the
electrons hold together without the
nuclei.
