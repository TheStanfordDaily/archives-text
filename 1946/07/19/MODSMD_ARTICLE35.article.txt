# Investment Income Decline Hits Stanford Hard
## The 						Large Wheels Watch the Bonds 
### 
(Editor's Note: This is the
fourth and last in a series of ar
ticles analyzing Stanford's finan
cial structure. While the figures
used were based on the records of
ihe 1 J)44-45 fiscal year, operations
for the current fiscal year, clos
ing August 31, were limited by
the same factors.
It is the Daily's hope that this
scries has provided some under
standing of the serious problem
facing the leaders of a privately
endowed university in a nation
where state subsidy for education
is increasingly common.)

Since the $148 you currently pay
\ tuition each quarter is roughly
latched by a similar sum drawn
roni Ihe endowment investment in
ome, the rise in enrollment figures
as made more vitally important
he state of the Univesity endow
ment investment.
Just what rising costs, a lower
lvestment income, and an in
reased enrollment has done to
Stanford finances is explained in
his way by the Administration:
"It may be stated roughly that
in the six-year period. 1941-1947.
academic budget expenditures in
creased 32 per cent while income
from fees and investments went
up only per cent.
"Figures for 1946-47 are based on
preliminary budget drawn up in
ne spring and now considered to be
\r from adequate for the antici
atcd enrollment of 7.000 next fall.*
The national picture of rising
rices has already been charted, and
n almost opposite trend may be
oted for investment interest rates.
rati: of return on stocks
as risen slightly from 1.49 per cent
i 1938. but the highs of 5.75 per
ont in 1920 and 1929 on short-term
igns are still a long way above
rates.
A flood of government bonds on
le market has driven bond inter
-;t rates from 2.99 per cent in 1938
> 2.52 per cent in 1940. 2.16 per
>nt in 1942. 1.63 per cent in 1944.
id 1.29 per cent in March. 1946.
Decline in interest rates means a
>rresponding decline in invest
ient income. How this has affected
niversity finances may be under
ood by comprehending the scope
the University's investment for
144-45.
With a book value of over $35,-
>0.000, the total investment was
imarily in bonds. Government
»nds alone accounted for 37 per
nt of the investment. Corporate
id government bonds together to
led nearly $19,000,000.
PREFERRED AND COMMON
ocks comprised 26 per cent of
e total investment with a com
ned book value approaching $10.-
•0.000.
An analysis of the Taond invest
ent shows $2,000,000 in public
ilit.v bonds. Cleveland Electric ll
minating Company, Common
ealth Edison Company, Pacific
as and Electric. Southern Califor
a Edison, and Southern California
as Company bonds accounted for
great percentage of the utility in
•stment.
F $180,000 in Atchison, To
•ka & Santa Fe Railway bonds to
95.000 in the West Shore Railway,
e University had invested slightly
•cr $2,000,000 in railroad bonds.
Faith in the future is-evidenced
■ the West Shore Railway bonds'
aturity date. Foux. hundred fifteen

I years must pass until these bonds j
mature in the year 2361.
Preferred stock investments ran
the gamut of the nation's utility. J
1 oil, steel, tire, tobacco, movie, and
pulp companies to the total of
slightly less than $2,000,000.
LARGEST SINGH S investments j
in common stocks were 10.000 shares I
j each in the Irving Trust Company j
and the Socony Vacuum Oil Com- j
pany, Inc.
The book value of common stocks
held by the University totaled just
over $7,000,000.
The remainder of the endowment
investment was in real estate, real
estate loans, and miscellaneous
loans with a book value approach
ing $7,000,000.
Briefly summarizing the signifi
cant points made in this series of
three articles, it is necessary not to
disassociate the University from the ;
natidon-wide economic picture.
This picture includes rising prices
and lower investment rates, and
while enrollment figures have doub
led in the last year this does not
represent a corresponding doubling
in net income.
Looking at university finances on
a national scale does not give the
exact picture at Stanford, but it
does indicate the new trends in
economy the University must meet.
