### TOM SELF 
Much has been said already on
the subject but we would like to
add a few more words about lower
ing academic standards for athletes.
The crux of the arguments we
are refuting seem to be that lower
ing standards, particularly entrance
requirements, is the only way Stan
ford ' will have a winning football
team. Proponents contend that ca
pable athletes are being attracted
elsewhere because Stanford's en
trance requirements are too tough.
NOW, THE BIGGEST practical
argument we can muster against
lowering standards for this reason
is that a school or any organization
.simply cannot ''buy" a champion
ship team. Championship teams are
born and, developed, not bought.
An outstanding failure of an at
tempt to buy a championship team
is the Boston Red Sox baseball club.
Tom Yawkey expended his millions
for the best stars in the gi'me. But
they did not bring him the pennant:
his Red Sox were not even in the
first division for years.
NOW THE RED SOX ARE lead
ing the American League, but the
team that is producing a pennant is
composed of youngsters like Wil
liams, DiMaggio, Doerr, and Pesky.
They have not played for any other
big league club. They are Boston
property and were developed in
Boston. A few years back they were
all playing Junior American Legion
baseball.
The same thing is true of a uni
versity football team. Collecting all
of the best players on the basis of
past performance will not assure a
coach of a championship or even a
superior team. It's the old story of
mercenary troops being inferior to
regulars. And. as a matter of rec
ord, experience has shown that real
ly outstanding athletes were good
students also. They were all
around men. not just dumb ath
letes.
IT IS OUR SINCERE BELIEF
that the school with a good coach,
hard-working, inspired athletes and
a loyal, supporting student body
will turn out championship teams as
often as the school that offers spe
cial inducements to athletes.
From the standpoint of ethics,
particularly at Stanford, the idea of
lowering requirements is untenable.
It involves special privileges. And
once started it might extend indefi
nitely â€” the debaters, dramatists,
etc., all clamoring for lowering of
standards to suit their wishes. Af
ter all, Stanford's purpose is to train
superior men and women. It can't
do that by lowering standards.
However, we do advocate very
strongly that athletes be given aca
demic credit for work on teams. It
seems to us that an athlete working
two or three hours a day six days a
week is entitled to several units
credit, just as the person who spends
those hours in the library.
