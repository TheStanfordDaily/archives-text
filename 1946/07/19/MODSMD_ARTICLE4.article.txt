A strong protest against the ru
mored use of Branner Hall by wom
en students fall quarter was pre
sented by lett«r to the Board of
Trustees at their. San Francisco
meeting yesterday by the Branner
Excom.
"The veterans' demand for educa
tion is the immediate cause of the
present educational emergency.' the
letter, written by Ted Norton, Daily
columnist and Branner secretary -
treasurer, said, pointing out that
most of the residents of Branner
are veterans.
' These men have had their fill of
barracks life. To take over a men's
hall for a women's residence and to
put these men back into barracks,
appears to be an unjustified dis
crimination,' - the protest continued.
The letter pointed out that most
of the women students at Stan
ford had had no interruption to
their studies as had the veterans,
and suggested that if a policy of
discrimination were to be set up it
should be in favor of veterans and
returning Stanford men.
