Apologies are in order for the
piece we wrote a week or so ago
in reference to the contemplated :
basketball team. At that time we
were unaware that Howie Dallmar.
j Stanford's All - American guard,
! would return to campus irt the fall.
Although Dallmar competed for
the University of Pennsylvania
while in the service, he has a year
of eligibility left. Dallmar led the
attack for Penn last year in their
i game with Navy, giving the Middies
| their first setback of the season.
BESIDES DALLMAR. COACH
Everett Dean will have the services |
| of Morley Thompson, Dick Berlin,
i Grant Denmark, and Dave David-
I son. The problem seems to be now
whether the other conference teani w
i did as we'll as the Farm in return
ing men. The answer to that will
'â–  tell where we will end the season.
It will be announced within the
| next week or ten days that Stan-
I ford will play an intersectional
j football contest in 1947, probably
! with a Mid-Western opponent. This
j shouldn't kick U.S.F. or Santa Clara
I off our schedule next year. The sea
son for Stanford will just begin a
week earlier, according to tentative
plans.
WHILE WE ARE ON THE sub

jcct of intersectional opponents, it
looks very much as it the basketba l
team will take a trip east during
Christmas vacation. Games are be
ing contracted for at the moment.
We wonder why it is that base
ball is always left out of intersec
tional competition. Every other
sport calls for travel to other sec
tions of the country, but the bsL 1
team stays at home. This is true of:
all other universities in the coun
try as well as Stanford.
