Greater reliance on increased powers of govern
ment for improvement of economic and social condi
tions is the road to future wars, Dr. Friedrich A.
Hayek, noted economist and author, declared in an
adddress delivered last night before the conference of

educators here.
Speaking on "Education and the
Economic Causes of War," he re
ferred to the widely held belief that
education may be capable of re
moving the main causes of war, and
questioned "whether we really
know what to teach in order to
achieve that end."
AUTHOR OF THE WIDELY dis
cussed book, "The Fioad to Serf
dom," and Tooke Professor of Eco
nomic Science and Statistics at the
University of London. Dr. Hayek is
serving on the summer faculty at
Stanford.
"It is almost inevitable," he said,
"that those who expect the improve
ment of economic and social condi
tions from the increasing powers of
the state should be driven into a
nationalistic attitude of mind. The
increasing powers of the separate
sovereign states, and the increasing
dependence of the individual on
those states, should lead to more
and more frequent clashes which
only might can decide. - '
HE DECLARED THAT WHILE
it is more important to avoid war in
the future than ever before, "we
have little justification for assuming
that we know how to do it."
"A little education in economics
is a dangerous thing," he said. "It
means that a few fashionable and
by themselves quite inadequate the
ories are handed-out as panaceas.
"It is not by the specific knowl
edge which the teacher can hope to
disseminate in these fields that he
will contiibute to a better world.
However, if he can create a critical
attitude of mind and a certain im
munity against indoctrination and
mass psychoses, and a consciousness
that we do not necessarily know
best, he will probably contribute
more to the peace of the world than
by more direct attempts to spread
the kind uf views on economic prob
lems whicn seem to him to provide
the solution."

Greater reliance on increased powers of govern
ment for improvement of economic and social condi
tions is the road to future wars, Dr. Friedrich A.
Hayek, noted economist and author, declared in an
adddress delivered last night before the conference of

educators here.
Speaking on "Education and the
Economic Causes of War," he re
ferred to the widely held belief that
education may be capable of re
moving the main causes of war, and
questioned "whether we really
know what to teach in order to
achieve that end."
AUTHOR OF THE WIDELY dis
cussed book, "The Fioad to Serf
dom," and Tooke Professor of Eco
nomic Science and Statistics at the
University of London. Dr. Hayek is
serving on the summer faculty at
Stanford.
"It is almost inevitable," he said,
"that those who expect the improve
ment of economic and social condi
tions from the increasing powers of
the state should be driven into a
nationalistic attitude of mind. The
increasing powers of the separate
sovereign states, and the increasing
dependence of the individual on
those states, should lead to more
and more frequent clashes which
only might can decide. - '
HE DECLARED THAT WHILE
it is more important to avoid war in
the future than ever before, "we
have little justification for assuming
that we know how to do it."
"A little education in economics
is a dangerous thing," he said. "It
means that a few fashionable and
by themselves quite inadequate the
ories are handed-out as panaceas.
"It is not by the specific knowl
edge which the teacher can hope to
disseminate in these fields that he
will contiibute to a better world.
However, if he can create a critical
attitude of mind and a certain im
munity against indoctrination and
mass psychoses, and a consciousness
that we do not necessarily know
best, he will probably contribute
more to the peace of the world than
by more direct attempts to spread
the kind uf views on economic prob
lems whicn seem to him to provide
the solution."
With over one thousand educators and students at

Greater reliance on increased powers of govern
ment for improvement of economic and social condi
tions is the road to future wars, Dr. Friedrich A.
Hayek, noted economist and author, declared in an
adddress delivered last night before the conference of

educators here.
Speaking on "Education and the
Economic Causes of War," he re
ferred to the widely held belief that
education may be capable of re
moving the main causes of war, and
questioned "whether we really
know what to teach in order to
achieve that end."
AUTHOR OF THE WIDELY dis
cussed book, "The Fioad to Serf
dom," and Tooke Professor of Eco
nomic Science and Statistics at the
University of London. Dr. Hayek is
serving on the summer faculty at
Stanford.
"It is almost inevitable," he said,
"that those who expect the improve
ment of economic and social condi
tions from the increasing powers of
the state should be driven into a
nationalistic attitude of mind. The
increasing powers of the separate
sovereign states, and the increasing
dependence of the individual on
those states, should lead to more
and more frequent clashes which
only might can decide. - '
HE DECLARED THAT WHILE
it is more important to avoid war in
the future than ever before, "we
have little justification for assuming
that we know how to do it."
"A little education in economics
is a dangerous thing," he said. "It
means that a few fashionable and
by themselves quite inadequate the
ories are handed-out as panaceas.
"It is not by the specific knowl
edge which the teacher can hope to
disseminate in these fields that he
will contiibute to a better world.
However, if he can create a critical
attitude of mind and a certain im
munity against indoctrination and
mass psychoses, and a consciousness
that we do not necessarily know
best, he will probably contribute
more to the peace of the world than
by more direct attempts to spread
the kind uf views on economic prob
lems whicn seem to him to provide
the solution."
