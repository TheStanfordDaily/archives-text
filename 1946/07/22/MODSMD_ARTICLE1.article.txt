# It's Definite—Women to Re-enter Branner in Fall
## Present Dorms Not Sufficient 
### 
Branner will be occupied by
women next year.
An announcement to this effect
by Dean of Students John M. Stal
naker confirmed a rumor that has
been current on campus for sev
eral days.
The one-time men's hall, which
housed women during the war and
was returned to the men at the be
ginning of this quarter, will be in
habited by women again because
present dormitories aren't adequate
for the number of women students
the University has felt compelled to
accept.
THE ACQUISITION OF DIBBLE,
which will house 2.400 single men,
has solved the housing situation for
unmarried men, he declared, while
it is virtually impossible to provide
satisfactory emergency housing fa
cilities for women.
Dean Stalnaker furnished several
reasons that influenced the decision.
"Pressure from male veterans for
educational facilities," he stated,
"has tended to obscure the fact that
the number of women seeking to
enter college is also at unprece
dented heights."
HE SAID THAT IF THE Univer
sity had admitted only the number
of women that could be housed in
women's dormitories, "we could
have accepted only a negligible
portion of the hundreds of highly
qualified women who sought ad
mission."
He added that "we want to keep
the number of men and women as
nearly in proportion as possible."
This meant that additional housing
had to be found for women "and
Branner, which was occupied by
women during the war, seemed the
logical choice."
