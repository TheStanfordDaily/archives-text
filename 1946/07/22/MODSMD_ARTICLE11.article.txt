STANFORD AND INJUSTICE
Two news stories appearing in the Daily this morning indi
cate that Stanford has been forced into making a choice be
tween injustices.
An increase in tuition rates to a figure higher than ever
dreamed of by the planners of the university is certainly un
just to both the students and the ideal imagined by the found
ers. The only possible justification would be that an even
greater injustice to the school and students might be executed
if the tuition stayed at the normal figure.
This is the case.
Stanford is not a state-endowed institution which may lob
by with legislators for an increased bankroll in the face of na
tionwide inflation. It is not the fondled pet of some moneyed
foundation which can close its eyes to bank balances.
Leland and Jane Stanford have been dead for more than 40
years, and their fortunes and those of their friends which
founded Stanford and helped it out of the cradle have suffered
the erosions of world depression.
The increase in tuitions will not meet the new responsibili
ties entirely, but they will help, and between holding the rates
at the old level and placing Stanford's whole structure in
jeopardy the choice is obvious.
The return of Branner to the girls is another injustice.
Despite the best the administration can do, some former
Stanford students who have earned in the service their right
to a comfortable education will probably be housed at Dibble.
This isn't what they looked forward to when they dreamed of
the Quad and its values during war-service characterized by
every kind of misery in the book.
But again it's a case of relative injustice. Stanford to .keep
the homefires burning at all was forced to admit an increased
number of women during the war.
To keep the fires burning for the future, it must do its best
to keep incoming classes normally proportioned between fresh
man men and women. Otherwise in five or ten years, with the
GI crisis over, the school will find itself with no nucleus on
which to build its future.
Some say that some of the extra women were admitted
provisionally and should bow out gracefully. But there is no
place for them to bow to. Other schools are packed and facing
the same problems.
The choice between telling a man that he may have to get
his Stanford education under less favorable circumstances than
he hoped and telling a girl she can't finish her college educa
tion at all is obvious.
The Daily gladly opens these editorial columns to the ex
pression of views disagreeing with these. It realizes the raise
in tuitions and the end of Branner as a men's dorm means hard
ship for many students.
But injustice sometimes is a relative matter, education at
Stanford or elsewhere during the next years cannot possibly
be as comfortable or efficient as a Gl's dream would have it,
and students are capable of sacrifices for the long-run good of
their university.
