### 
This morning's announcement of a boost in tuition adds another furrow to the financially
troubled brow of the Stanford student, and another chapter in the history of Stanford tuition
charges.
On the opening day of Stanford, Senator Stanford told San Francisco newspapermen that
there would certainly be a tuition fee when Stanford opened in the fall, and that none should
expect to get an education for nothing.
When classes began in the autumn an "Incidental Fee" of $15 per semester was charged
in place of a fee for instruction. In 1916-17 when Stanford adopted the quarter system, the

pay was adjusted to $10 per quar
ter.
However, the Schools of Law
and Medicine adopted tuition lees
of $25 per semester and $150 per
year respectively in 1908-09. and
this jumped to $35 per quarter and
$50 per quarter when the quarter
system came in in 1916-17. A year
later the general student "inciden
tal fee" rose to $20 per quarter.
At (he end of World War I,
facing much the same rising
costs in equipment, material, and
faculty as today, Stanford in -
(reduced a general $40 tui(ion
fee per quarter. This was added
to (he $20 "incidental fee."
In 1926-27 this tuition fee jumped
to $85. in 1930 to $100, and in 1940-
41 to $115. In the 1926-27 raises,
Business School tuition jumped to
$115 and Medical School to $100,
and in 1930 each added a $15 raise.
In 1940-41 Business School be
gan charging $145 and the Medi
cal School $130.
