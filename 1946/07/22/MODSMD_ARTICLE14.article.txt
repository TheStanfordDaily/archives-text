went for a weekend frolic in
the City to recuperate. lie re
cuperated so hard he's still ex
hausted and hence is unable to
tap his campus sources. In fact,
the lies! he can offer is a story
(clean) he heard while in con
valescence.)
Once upon a time there was an
animal trainer who went to see a
vaudeville booking agent to see if

he could use
a good animal
act.
The agent
told the trainer
he was sorry
but that ani
mal acts were
dead and he
couldn't use it.
The trainer
persisted an d
finally the ag-

ent reluctantly gave in and agreed
to audition the act.
THE TRAINER SNAPPED lIIS
fingers and his dog ran over and
began playing a piano, and very
creditably. The agent was amazed
and said he could get $750 a week
for the act.
He was interrupted while look
ing for a contract by the trainer
who said that wasn't all. He snap
ped his fingers again and a parrot
flew over to the piano and began
singing to the dog's accompani
ment.
The agent was entranced. "Why
we can get $2,000 a week for that,"
he said, looking for the special con
tracts he used for Gertrude Law
rence.
"But I can only take $750 for the
act," the trainer said.
"Huh!" snorted the agent. "You'll
take $2,000. After all I get 10 per
cent of it."
"NOPE," SAII) THE TRAINER.
$750 or you don't get the act."
"But why?" demanded ag
ent.
"Because the act is a fraud."
was the reply.
"A fraud? How so?"
"Well," the trainer said hesi
tantly. "the parrot isn't really sing
ing. The dog is a ventriloquist.'
