Kenny Casanega of Santa Clara. Don
Durdan of Oregon State, Tommy
Roblin of Chicago, Vike Francis of

DICK IIANLEY, COACII OF
the Chicago Rockets, observed in
Santa Rosa last week that the San
Francisco '49ers would not win the
Ail-American Football Conference,
for they do not have enough re
serve strength in the backfield.
While we admittedly do not know
as much about that as coach Han
ley, we believe that Frankie Albert
and Norm Stand lee of Stanford,
Kenny Casanega of Santa Clara. Don
Durdan of Oregon State, Tommy
Roblin of Chicago, Vike Francis of
Nebraska, and "Strike" Stryzkalski
of Marquette and the Fourth Air
Force should do quite well.
Hanley won't be too bad off for
backs, himself, as he has Elroy
Htrsch of Wisconsin, Billy Hillen
brand and Bob Hoernschmeyer of
Indiana, as well as Bob Dove of
Notre Dame and Wee Willie Wilkin
of St. Mary's Pre-Flight in the line.
The Rockets, by the way, open
football season this year with a
game on August 18 in Portland
against the Brooklyn Dodgers. In

another practice contest, they play
the '49ers September 1 at San Fran
cisco's Kezar Stadium.

Games in which lettermen have
appeared are subject to protest, and
intramural director Elwyn Bugge
maintained that all such protests
would be upheld.
Intramural sports are set up on
this campus to give opportunities to
those who would otherwise not
have a chance. The lettermen have
had their chance. Those who are
not good enough to play varsity ball
should be able to play murals with
out the assistance
Realizing that this is the off-season
for varsity sports, we nevertheless
feel that lettermen have had their
opportunity and that the others
should now have theirs.

VVE READ IN THE PAPKHS that
Stanford's $35,000 wonder Bob
Brown may replace Phil Rizzuto as
the New York Yankees' regular
shortstop. It is claimed that Larry
MacPhail is very, very dissatisfied

with the play of the Yankees this
season and will place quite a few

fail to improve.
