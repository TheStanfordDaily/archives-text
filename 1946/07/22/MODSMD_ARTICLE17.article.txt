## SON A Meets Chi Psi's for Loop Lend In Outstanding Mural Game of Week 
### 
Intramural play goes into another |
week of action with four teams still
undefeated. It is a certainty that
these undefeated teams will be cut
to three at the end of Tuesday's
play.
In the top game of the week, .
SON A and Chi Psi meet Tuesday
to decide the undisputed leader of
League 11. They are now tied for
the lead with three victories apiece.
If comparison of scores is any cri
terion, then the Chi Psi's should be
the favorite as they defeated En- ;
cina IE 15-7 whereas SONA could
beat them only 10-7.
BOTH TEAMS ARE STRONG AT
bat, each averaging over ten runs a
game. On their opponents' scores,
Chi Psi again takes the edge giving >
out but. four tallies per game
whereas the Navy outfit has aver
aged seven for their foes.
Comparisons, however, mean lit- |
tie. The winner will probably go
on to take the league title.
In other games to be played Tues- j
day, the Firehouse takes on Encina !
IE and Phi Delta Kappa II faces I
Encina IW. Neither the educational j
fraternity nor IE have entered the i
win column this season while the '
other two outfits have won but one j
apiece.

THE 810 PITFALL FOR THE
education squad seems to be their
weakened condition resulting from
splitting their team in two. Neither
team has won a game yet in compe
tition, the I outfit taking a forfeit |
from the Encina Cellar in last
Thursday's scheduled game. It looks j
as though Encina 1W should defeat 1
the II team without over-exertion, j
The unbeaten Legal Eagles take I
a week's vacation from mural acliv- )
ity due to finals in the law school.
DELTA UPSILON, ALSO unde
feated in League 11, should keep
their record clean during the week.
In Tuesday's contest, they face the '
winless Encina Cellar outfit, de
fending intramural Softball cham
pions, who have failed to show any
strength all quarter. The D.U.'s
meet Phi Delta Kappa on Thurs
day's bill and again are overwhelm
ing favorites. Although the educa
tion team's two losses were both by
slim one-run margins, Delta Upsi
lon is figured to have too much
power for them.
In the only other contest slated
for Tuesday in that league. Sigma
Nil comes up against the Phi Psi's.
From their showing against the Le
gal Eagles where they lost by one
run after leading up to the last in
ning, Sigma Nu has the edge.
