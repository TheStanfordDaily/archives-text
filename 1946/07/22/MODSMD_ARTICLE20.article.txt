# Educational Methods Unimproved by Warâ€”Bartky
## Unchanged By Brass Buttons 
### BUD ROWLAND 
"Educators with brass buttons are
no better educators than they were
before they had the brass buttons."
These words sum up the thoughts
of the new Dean of the School of
Education, Professor John Bartky,
about his experience as a captain in
the Navy.
HE SPEAKS WITH AUTHORITY
for as assistant director of the Stand
ards and Curriculum Division of
the Navy's Bureau of Personnel he
Was awarded the Legion of Merit.
"There is a great deal of pressure
in the schools now to take over the
military methods of teaching. This
pressure is misplaced because the
men who did the military teaching
were the same men who taught as
civilians. And they applied their
past experience as civilians to the
emergencies of war.
"IF THE TEACHING METHODS
used in the service were any good it
is because those methods had been
developed in civilian teaching be
fore the war."
Dean Bartky said that it is rec
ognized by most military authori
ties that one of the main causes for
the defeat of Japan "was its inabil
ity to train men rapidly."
THE DEAN STATED THAT THE
men who formulated service edu
cation policies applied methods they
had developed as educators in ci
vilian life. For this reason he feels
that specific application of service
methods to civilian education has
"little to contribute."
However, Dean Bartky does feel
hat his naval service was beneficial.
"It restored my confidence in young
people," he says."I had to compete
with young men, and learned that
they are pretty smart."
THE NEW DEAN OF THE School
of Education had been president of
the Chicago Teachers' College be
fore assuming his duties in the
Navy. Prior to that he served as
district superintendent of schools in
Chicago.
As an undergraduate at Lewis
(Illinois) Institute of Technology
Bartky achieved distinction as an
athlete. He won letters in football,
basketball, and track. He held the
conference record for the half-mile
run, and for a time held the world's
record for 500 meters.
MATHEMATICAL difficulties did
not prevent him from taking his
Master's degree in mathematics
from the University of Chicago in
1P24. He continued at Chicago and
received his Doctor's degree in ed
ucation in 192G.
Comparing Stanford students with
those he has seen in the Mid-West.
Dean Bartky feels that our students
are superior in "social sensitivity,
intelligence, appearance and enthu
siasm."

"Educators with brass buttons are
no better educators than they were
before they had the brass buttons."
These words sum up the thoughts
of the new Dean of the School of
Education, Professor John Bartky,
about his experience as a captain in
the Navy.
HE SPEAKS WITH AUTHORITY
for as assistant director of the Stand
ards and Curriculum Division of
the Navy's Bureau of Personnel he
Was awarded the Legion of Merit.
"There is a great deal of pressure
in the schools now to take over the
military methods of teaching. This
pressure is misplaced because the
men who did the military teaching
were the same men who taught as
civilians. And they applied their
past experience as civilians to the
emergencies of war.
"IF THE TEACHING METHODS
used in the service were any good it
is because those methods had been
developed in civilian teaching be
fore the war."
Dean Bartky said that it is rec
ognized by most military authori
ties that one of the main causes for
the defeat of Japan "was its inabil
ity to train men rapidly."
THE DEAN STATED THAT THE
men who formulated service edu
cation policies applied methods they
had developed as educators in ci
vilian life. For this reason he feels
that specific application of service
methods to civilian education has
"little to contribute."
However, Dean Bartky does feel
hat his naval service was beneficial.
"It restored my confidence in young
people," he says."I had to compete
with young men, and learned that
they are pretty smart."
THE NEW DEAN OF THE School
of Education had been president of
the Chicago Teachers' College be
fore assuming his duties in the
Navy. Prior to that he served as
district superintendent of schools in
Chicago.
As an undergraduate at Lewis
(Illinois) Institute of Technology
Bartky achieved distinction as an
athlete. He won letters in football,
basketball, and track. He held the
conference record for the half-mile
run, and for a time held the world's
record for 500 meters.
MATHEMATICAL difficulties did
not prevent him from taking his
Master's degree in mathematics
from the University of Chicago in
1P24. He continued at Chicago and
received his Doctor's degree in ed
ucation in 192G.
Comparing Stanford students with
those he has seen in the Mid-West.
Dean Bartky feels that our students
are superior in "social sensitivity,
intelligence, appearance and enthu
siasm."
