### 
Teachers better equipped to de
velop well-rounded personalities in
their students and a more even bal
ance between vocational and gen
eral education were recommended
to the Stanford educational confer
ence in talks by Dr. Kenneth Mc-
Farland, Topeka superintendent of
schools, and Dr. W. H. Cowley,
Stanford professor of education.
"My plea to educators is to take
off the cellophane wrappings and
come out where the people live," j
Dr. McFarland told nearly a thou- !
sand educators and education stu- j
dents Friday night.
THE IDEAL LEARNING situa
tion exists, he said, when a child j
so admires his teacher that he wants
more than anything else to be like
his teacher.
"This thing we call education is
culture, and culture is polish," he
said. "Children cannot acquire it
by reading about it or hearing I
about it. They must rub shoulders j
daily with people who have it. It
is very difficult for a child to learn j
good manners without ever seeing I
any.
"THAT IS WHY NO CANNED
Or accelerated educational process j
can ever take the place of high- |
grade ladies and gentlemen in the
classroom â€”and there is no use talk- j
ing about buying that kind of qual
ity at bargain prices."
Dr. Cowley, speaking Saturday !
morning on the subject "Brothers ;
under the Sheepskin," asked a re
vitalization of liberal education and
for college teachers who can "in
spire their studei|ts to aspire."
