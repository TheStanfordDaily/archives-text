# Dibble Name Contest Expires Next Sunday
## 
### 
This Sunday is positively the
last day for Stanfordites to enter
their ideas in the Daily Dibble
Naming Contest.
Over 100 suggestions have been
received by contest director Jackie
Boucher.
There is no limit on the number
of ideas per person, but the
ideas should have some relation
ship to Stanford.
