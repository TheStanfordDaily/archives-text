PRICE - CONTROL COMMUNI
QUE: The conference committee
has adopted a compromise giving a
three-man ''decontrol" board power

to decide whether
or not to have
ceilings on prices
of farm and some
other products.
For comment:
This compromise
looks just like an
other in a series
of fouled -up
price - control
fumbles. It is a

conclusion of mine that either you
control an entire economy or else
you leave it as unrestricted as pos
sible. Congress and some labor or
ganizations seem to bo busy delud
ing themselves that they and the
country can oat their cake and have
it too!
Meanwhile, OPA was not the
only item of interest in Washington.
Besides the antics of Congressman

May, the Houses have such bills
yet to act on as the legislative re
organization measure, the domestic
atomic energy control bill, exten
sion of the RFC, terminal leave pay
for EM, the increased Social Secu
rity levy, and a long-term housing
program, all of which they are cur
rently considering. And they hope
to adjourn by the end of the month.
Well, it will be their first all-sum
mer vacation since we entered the
war.
FOREIGN NEWS FRONTS are
quiet these days . . . everyone prep
ping madly for the European peace
conference, I suppose. There was a
revolution in Bolivia over the week
end which appears to have put a
liberal regime in power. In China,
both the National Government and
the Communists are accusing each
other of starting another civil war.
Increased pressure in Palestine may
lose Dr. Chaim Weizman his long
held position as a Zionist leader.
The Roxas government in the Phil

ippines is negotiating with the Huk
balahap leaclws, whose partisan fol
lowers have been terrorizing central
Luzon in their campaign for land
reforms. And UNRRA Director La
Guardia, making a swing around
Europe, denounced Greek politi
cians as being as bad as American
politicians.
I was asked what I thought about
the affair of the late Draja Mikhailo
vitch. There is no question but that
he and Tito had been fighting each
other, as well as the Germans, vigor
ously. One started out as the recog
nized government, and the other
ended up in that spot. But, since
the Partisans are now solidly in
power, it would have made for a
better press to have jailed or ban
ished Mikhailovitch. However they
do these things in Russia, there are
countries where they do not usually
shoot their political opponents. In
fact, even the Russians don't shoot
many those days. There aren't
many left.
