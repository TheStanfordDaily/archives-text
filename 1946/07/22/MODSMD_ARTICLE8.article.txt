# New Tuition Fees Zoom To $166.65
## 12 Per Cent Hike Made 
### 
Tuition fees will be increased to
$166.65 next quarter according to
an announcement by the Board of
Trustees.
This represents a raise of slightly
more than 12 per cent over the $143
figure that has been in effect since
1940, in comparison with 15 to 30
per cent increases in other institu
tions throughout the country.
BOARD MEMBERS REMARKED
that the action was taken reluctantly
after it was determined that spiral -
ing costs of supplies, in addition to
higher salaries and wages, left the
University no alternative. They
pointed out as an example that the
minimum salary for instructors is
while the minimum for assistant pro
fessors is being increased from $2,s<X}
to $3,000.
The trustees said that notwith -
standing rapidly mounting costs in
all departments and the possibility
that an even larger tuition increase
should have been made, they felt
that every possible effort should be
made at this time to keep tuition
fees within the means of student
veterans.
THE NEW TUITION RATE FOR
the Graduate School of Business
will be $540 per academic year, pay
able at $18(5 per quarter, and for the
School of Medicine it will be $60«J
per year, payable at $200 per quar
ter.
An additional $25,000 will be ap
propriated during the next academ
ic year for scholarships and grants
in-aid in order to provide greater
assistance to worthy students whose
education might otherwise be in
terrupted because of the higher
costs.
