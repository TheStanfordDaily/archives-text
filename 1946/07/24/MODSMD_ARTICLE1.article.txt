Biggest noise in the news lately
was the dynamiting of the King
David Hotel in Jerusalem by Jew
ish underground forces. The ho
tel housed British civil and mili
tary headquarters. In response.
Prime Minister Attlee stated in
Commons that the British Gov
ernment would not he so diverted
from attempting to arrive at a just
solution of the Palestinian prob
lem. And Egypt and Iraq, acting
for the Arab League, have de
manded that the U.N. take action
on Palestine.
This afternoon should see the sec-

ond atom - bomb
test at Bikini,
which may be
even noisier than
the Palestine ho
tel blast. If bad
weather does not
intervene, an ex
plosion will be
set off under wa
ter; vastly more
destruction is an
ticipated.

After all (he predictions that
OPA would never be revived, it
now looks like it might have a
chance after all. The compromise
price-control bill passed the House
yesterday, and should be consid
ered by the Senate today. And
the Senate passed the terminal
leave bill, with the proviso for
bonds, which now goes to the
House.
It is worthy of mention, I think,
that the State Democratic Conven
tion elected none other than James
Roosevelt as their California chair
man last week. The Republicans
also met; their principal achieve
ment was turning out a platform
only 300 words long.
I see by the papers that West
brook Pegler doesn't like the AVC.
My only complaint against them,
personally, is that they don't de
vote any attention to the problems
of the veterans here at Stanford.
Certainly there are enough such
problems; it would be a community
service.
It looks like a full-fledged civil
war has re-opened in China. It is
not exactly clear to me who at
tacked whom, but it appears that
the Nationalist forces are advanc
ing in force. In reply to IVlme.
Sun Yat-sen's charge that the
U.S. was using China for its own
purposes, the State Department
has replied that our only purpose
in China is to unify the warring
Chinese factions.
And, to mention another Asiatic
problem, Queen Wilhelmina of the
Netherlands stated in a "speech
from the throne" that it was the
conclusion of her government that
the Indonesians were not yet ready
for full self-government.
