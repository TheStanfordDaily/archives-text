# Guerard Sees World Union
## 
### 
Dr. Albert L. Guerard, who will
retire at the end of the quarter as
professor of general literature, has
returned from a flying trip to New
York where he attended the eighth
meeting of the Committee to Frame
a World Constitution.
The committee, composed of
prominent scholais and scientists,
believes, according to an outline
brought back by Dr. Guerard, that
the possibility of achieving a world
government can best be determined
by framing a constitution which pre
sents for consideration and discus
sion the specific principles and
mechanism of a world state.
Monthly meetings are planned by
the group until the draft of the con
stitution is completedâ€”a task which
is expected to take about a year,
Dr. Guerard stated.
The committee intends to organize
an advisory council of about 50
members, which will be invited to
the first convention this fall when
basic issues can be presented for
discussion.
