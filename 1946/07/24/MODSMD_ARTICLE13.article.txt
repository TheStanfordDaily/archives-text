The Editor, Sir:
What are the reasons given for the reclassification of Bran
ner as a women's residence? Dean Stalnaker explains that the
number of women seeking to enter college is at unprecedented
heights, and that if only the number of women who could be
housed in women's dormitories were admitted, the University
could have accepted only a negligible portion of the hundreds
of highly gualified women seeking admission. Again, it is
claimed that "we want to keep the number of men and women
as nearly in proportion as possible."
If it be a choice between turning away "highly gualified
women" or highly gualified veterans, certainly there should be
no hesitation on the part of the trustees. Or is it to be presumed
that Dibble will more than accommodate all thgse "highly gual
ified" veterans desiring to enter Stanford. If such is the case,
certainly the fact has not been publicized. Most of us feel that
even with Dibble (and with Branner also) many deserving vet
erans will not be able to find accommodations.
Again, the distinction between occupational training and
cultural pursuit of knowledge should be stressed. Obviously,
the veteran must choose a school considered highly by the busi
ness world, since his very livelihood may well depend upon
the guality of that education. The woman student is not usu
ally faced with this problem, particularly if she is able to afford
Stanford.
Should men and women be kept as nearly in proportion as
possible? Not if proportionality denies education to those who
have sacrificed three to five years in service of their country.
The ratio has never been egual during normal times, and surely
now is no time to "balance the budget." Bill Hornby is certain
that Stanford students are capable of sacrifices for the long-run
good of their University. Is the University capable of demon
strating understanding and consideration for the long-run good
of its students?
