The Editor, Sir:
I wish to take this opportunity to thank through your news
paper the Administration for their consideration of the veteran
when they raised the price of the tuition for an academic year
to $499.95.
This step by the Administration solves a number of prob
lems, not the least of which is all of this Bookstore trouble.
With the veteran left with five cents per academic year for
books and supplies, there doesn't seem much room left for dis
cussion.
I also think that it is a gesture on the part of the Ad
ministration "to insure a balanced student body in the future"
by admitting more women students than they can take care of
adequately. Be this as it may, I think that it was also nice of
the Administration to decide to house them in Branner. This
of course ships many veteran students who would otherwise be
housed in Branner to the Dibble area. But, after all, a veieran
is used to that sort of thing.
If the Administration is going so far out of its way to be
nice to women students, how about housing them in part at least
in Dibble. I'm sure that the women concerned will agree that
the minor discomfort which they would experience would be
more than compensated for by their University admission.
I am not writing as a member of the Daily staff.
