## Bull Session 
### 
THE KISS-OFF
This, kind and gentle readers
(including you thugs wot wrote
the nasty letters) is just what the

caption says it i
: is: The Kiss- ,
; Oil. In short,
the present Bull I
*Sessioner is ab-i
indicating, quit-!
1 ting, has been'
I fired, and will \
Ibe replaced.
In line with i
the Summ e r i
Daily's policy of j
sharing the

wealth and talent of its writing
force (all eight of us) with the
leaders. I'm stepping down, after
four weeks, in place of Robert
Wilbur (The Big Red Machine)
Chandler who will commence ply
ing his trade with Friday morn- j
ing's paper.
I can recommend Chan (it is|
rumored he has Chinese blood) to
you very highly. As one of the
original "Bad Boys of 1940" he is
well known in all sorts of circles,
campus and off-campus. Because
of these affiliations he will un
doubtedly be able to give you bet
ter coverage than I have been able |
to.
And I don't imagine he will
stir you up with campaigns re- I
garding campus love and dress. As
a commuter to Yuba City and en
virons he isn't interested in out- |
side love and in dress he's one of
the last of the Stanford Roughs.
He never shaves.
As the new Bull Sessioner he in
herits all the ranks, rights and
privileges thereto appertaining â€”
including my tile of letters.
He's particularly welcome to the |
latter.
Thank you one and all for your j
readership.
