# Vets Will Pay Excess Fees
## 
### 
Any new registration procedures
for veterans occasioned by the re
cent tuition raise will be announced
as soon as they are formulated,
George D. Barshal, University co
ordinator for veterans, announced
yesterday.
For the present it appears that on
registration day the veteran will
have to decide between two alter
native methods of paying tuition in
excess of $500 for three quarters.
THE STUDENT MAY PAY THE
University for the excess, or he may
elect to have the excess paid by the
Veterans' Admiinstration, in which
case he will forfeit one day of his
entitlement for every $2.10 he
spends over $500. Forfeiture will
offset current excess costs; however,
subsistence will be lost for that part
of his entitlement which he uses for
this purpose.
Applications for excess funds may
be filed with the Veterans' Records
Office, room 164, Administration
Building.
MR. BARAHAL POINTED OUT
that the raise will not yet greatly af
fect those veterans who have many
more months' entitlement than they
can use. If too many veterans are
adversely affected by tuition raises
at the various universities in the
United States, there is a possibility
that a new G.I. Bill will be drafted.
The reason for this is that the origi
nal intent of the G.I. Bill was that
any veteran could go to any univer
sity or school of his choice for the
full time to which he was entitled
by virtue of his length of service.
