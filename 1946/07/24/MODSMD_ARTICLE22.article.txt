# Lag Plans Open House Dance
## 
### 
The girls of Lagilnita Court will
hold the second open house of the
summer quarter on Friday evening,
July 26. The theme of this informal,
all-campus affair will be "On the
Farm." Guests are urged to wear
casual sport clothes, while the girls
will lend atmosphere to the dance
by wearing pigtails and cotton
dresses.
On entering every man will re
ceive one half of a puzzle; two sim
ilar copies of all the halves will be
handed out to each guest. The point

of the game will be for each man to
try finding the girl who holds the ;
matching half to complete his pic-
I ture before his competitor reaches
her. A financial reward will be ;
given to the man who completes
his puzzle picture first.
Entertainment will consist of
dancing, volley ball, ping pong, and
J bridge games. Furthermore, the
i girls will contribute their talent to
| put on an amateur show. Refresh- |
I ments will be served during the
i evening.
