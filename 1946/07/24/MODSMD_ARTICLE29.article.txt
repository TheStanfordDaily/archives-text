# Principal's Troubles Told
## 
### 
Dean A. John Bartky of the i
School of Education will give an ad- |
dress entitled "Confessions of a
Principal" tomorrow evening at 7:45
in Cubberley Auditorium.
The talk will deal with the prob- '
lems that arise in the administra- j
tions of a public school. Dr. Bartky
has a varied background in this
field, having held positions in teach
ing, administration, and teacher
training.
Dr. Bartky has claimed that the
position of an administrator is a i
very difficult one which becomes j
quite involved at times. His speech
will take the view that "An admin- .
istrator must constantly make de- 1

cisions which very often influence
the whole community."
