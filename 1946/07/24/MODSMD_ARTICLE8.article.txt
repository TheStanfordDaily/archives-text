# Committee Urges Farm Visit Dibble
## 
### 
At its meeting last night Bob Col
lins' Dibble Committee decided to
urge Excom to sponsor a "students
at Dibble" day sometime before the
end of the quarter for the purpose
of giving all those now on campus a
chance to inspect the installation.
The decision was an outgrowth of
the committee's tour Monday, under
the guidance of Major William Ea
ton, after which all those present,
including Daily columnist Ted Nor
ton, declared themselves agreeably
surprised by the possibilities Dibble
offered for veterans' housing.
Main business of the meeting last
night was discussion of a group of
letters to various administrative de
partments and utilities which will
contain specific recommendations of
the committee. The letters will be
submitted, through President Tres
idder, to Dean Stalnaker, the Li
brary. the Union, the Department of
Athletics, and the Stanford Book
store.
