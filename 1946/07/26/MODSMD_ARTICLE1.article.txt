# Hoover: Stanford Gets True Nazi Documentation
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
The most complete documentation in the world on World War
31 and its fascist birth pains will become a part of Stanford's
xesearch facilities as a result of Herbert Hoover's recent world
(amine tour.
In his 11th floor Hoover Library office, high above the sand-

.stone Quad he left as a senior more 1
than 40 years ago. the 31st Presi- I
dent of the United States told me [
{ is belief that Stanford will soon j
be the greatest center in the world
for the study of international rela
tions.
To the Hoover Library on War.
devolution and Peace i.s coming "a
r . w flow of material of astounding
order" as soon a? it can be shipped.
"All over the world people have
heard of our library, and Stan
ford will soon be the only place
in the world where people can
Accurately reconstruct the dicta
tor regimes and the story of how
people actually lived and were
affected in those areas," Hoover
said.
Collection agencies have been set

ontact agencies established in 42 j
ountries before 1939. In addition
Stanford alumni in war service the!
- r orld over have rounded up mate

Herbert Hoover at 72 is still a
igorous man. erect in posture and
icry much the executive. There
"'s none of the reminiscing ego
tism which might mark the inter
views of a man of his age and ac
complishments.
Because of this, when he details
v-.e accomplishments and the plans
the library, he convinces the lis
-1 • ner he is talking facts and not
hopes.
Within the library vaults is proof j
for all his words. Few men can
open their desk drawer and bring j
out the only bound volumes in ex
istence of Polish wartime under
ground newspapers.
Lying there in a strange tongue, |
the raggedness of their printing
route testimony to the hardships of I
their production, these volumes are j
yn eloquent symbol of the resources |
which future generations at Stan- i
iTcrd may use to unlock the key to)
Vartime Europe and Asia.
"This library was the only yreat
fine of its kind alive during the
var.'' Hoover explained.
Of the three other great libraries i
devoted to a specialized study of
w.r and revolution, the one in Paris ,
was. inactive during the war, the j
Eerlin institution was destroyed,
iind the one in London badly dam
aged.
In contrast, Stanford staffs work- i
i \g on a straight schedule through
the war and now have appealed to 1
•tudents, professors, newspapers—j
. .1 the contact points of a broken
world—to build the Hoover Library.
"There just isn't any other source

left for the fugitive documentation
of our era," the while-haired, ap
pe-cheeked man who took the rap
for a world depression explains.
A quest which began on the North
Sea just after the last war has ended
in a success not dreamed of then by
a young diplomat reading Andrew
D. White's account of the French
Revolution to kill the hours of his
voyage to Versailles.
Hoover read White's complaint
that the "fugitive documentation"
of the French Revolution had been
lost in the turmoil of a broken
Europe. Hoover felt that the same
thing could be prevented if one
consciously began to collect the
documentation of the World War
just ended.
From then on through the career
which led the famine-killer through
the tragedies of the last war to the
Presidency, and then from the hu
miliation of 1932 through 14 years
of restless, on-the-shelf political life
until his recent job as Truman's
trouble-shooter, Hoover has con
stantly worked for the library
which bears his name.
And though his critics arc Ic
gion in his own country, the deep
gratitude of foreign countries
for his work after two wars has
paid off for Stanford many times
over.
Now all over Europe and Asia
the people who* are the leftovers of
the fascist regimes are shying away
from any connection with the docu
ments of those eras. In the great
vacuum left by the collapse of the
would-be empires of Japan, Ger
many, and Italy, Stanford agents are
moving in on the raw material of
history.
"Because it is an endowed uni
versity with no political responsi
bilities, Stanford is achieving a
unique success in its search for
material.
'"A great research laboratory for
the social sciences" is coming into
its own on this campus, and Her
bert Hoover can mark it the most
lasting achievement in a career that
includes the extremes of success
and disappointment.
