Well, we have an OPA again.
President Truman signed the
compromise price-control act yes
terday, "reluctantly," and told the
Congress that lie would not hesi
tate to call them back into ses
sion if changes were necessary to
prevent economic disaster.
The OPA has already proclaimed

that rent ceil
ings of June 30
are back in force.
Price controls on
far m products,
petroleum prod
ucts, and other
block - backed
commodities will
not be "recon
troled" until Au
gust 21, or until

the three - man "decontrol" board |
acts on them. The President has not i
yet announced .the members of the i
board, but promised that it would
not be a "packed jury."
The decontrol board must fir>t
decide whether or not to reinstate {
price ceilings on these products, i
Thereafter, generally speaking, it
lias power to remove ceilings when ;

supply of a particular commodity
comes abreast of demand. I realize
that it is impossible to measure sup
ply and demand with accuracy, but
certainly the board can arrive at
some satisfactory approximation.
Looking back on that overrun line
we were once supposed to hold, and
at the frenzied attempts to prevent
an inflation that was already hap
pening, it is no worse a standard for
price control than we had. And. in
so far as it suggests an end, some
day, to price control, it is a better
standard.
The Nuremburg war crimes
trials should end today with Jus
tice Jackson's summation for the
prosecution. The International
Military Tribunal has been in ses
sion since last fall, trying some
twenty high German officers and
officials and five Nazi organiza
tions on charges of violating trea
ties, of conspiring to wage ag
gressive war. and of crimes
against humanity.
The special session of the State
Legislature called to consider state
price-control laws adjourned yes
terday afternoon after hearing that

President Truman had signed the
new OPA act. Governor Warren
expressed his relief that California
would not now have to set up its
own control machinery. The Gov
ernor emphasized that all evictions
and i - ent increases scheduled to take
effect at the end of this month are
now outlawed.
A Senate - House conference
committee has agreed on the do
mestic atomic energy control bill.
No military men will serve on the
control commission, but the "di
rector of military application" will
be from the armed forces.
Congressman Andrew J. May.
who had agreed to testify before the
Mead committee, was reported yes
terday to be suffering from a heart
attack. His attorney made the an
nouncement. Later. Murray Gars
son. president of the "paper empire"
with which testimony has linked
May. stated that the Kentucky Con
gressman might not live through the
night. Dr. George Calver. Capitol
physician, said that he knew noth
ing about May's illness.
