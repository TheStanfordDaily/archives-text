God and Leland bless the fixers of the road back of the
Post Office. Don't stop there!
Excom should realize that in moving into the sponsor-pick
ing field they are demonstrating that student government at
Stanford can accept new responsibilities and power. We have
the reputation of having the best student government in the
West; sometimes it has seemed to be mostly reputation and
little fact.
As far as we can determine, Excom has every right legally
to cooperate with the Dean of Men's office and pick a respons
ible senior or grad student to be Encina President. If this
Encina plan works, the next step may mean complete student
selection of all men's halls heads.
The problem calls for vigorous action and not too much
worry about whether or not there is any precedent for the
action or if fall quarter Excom would "mind."

One final plug for the Dibble Name contest. 25 bucks is
getting nearer to being hay every day, but it isn't quite there
yet.
