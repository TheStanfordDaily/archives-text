# BOB CHANDLER
## Bull Session 
### 
We have no "message" to de
liver to the campus, no axes to
grind —as yet, that is — and no
windmills to tilt against. And with
Chappie not in publication during
summer quarter, we have a good
chance of being first with our sto
ries.

Today's yarn concerns mice, lit-

tle furry ones.
We like mice.
If you don't be
lieve it, come on
down to our Palo
Alto abode — an
other word for the
half of an Bxl6
room — and look
at our pet mice.
Where they
came from we
don't know. When

Chandler
("The Faceless
Man")

we first moved into the room we
didn't see any mice, but soon af
terward one appeared, and used to
sit in the corner of the room
watching us study.
He evidently was intrigued by

what he saw for a few days later
he came back with his lady friend
—and so we furnished his enter
tainment for a cheap date.
They got married—or whatever
mice do—and a little later we had
more mice.
Now they're all over the place.
Our landlady is the kindest
hearted woman since Florence
Nightingale; she just can't stand to
kitt any living creature.
So for a month now—ever since
another increase in the mouse
population—we have been griping
about the mice. She won't allow
them to be caught in a trap which
will injure them.
For the past month the landlady
has been searching through the
musty archives of the Palo Alto
Municipal Library, trying to find
out how to build a trap which will
catch mice without harming them.
And after she catches them she
is going to load them in her car,
take them out near the golf course
and turn them loose so they can
gambol around the hills in peace
until the end of their days.
In the meantime, the mice are
watching us study.

Branner Hall back in the 1940-
41 days was known as the tradi
ditional home of the Stanford
rough. The rough was the guy
who insisted that women wear silk
stockings on the Quad, who shaved
on Tuesday afternoons and Friday
nights and who wore the dirtiest
jeans and tee shirts he could find.
The rough tradition still lives in
the hearts of a few old-timers in
Branner.
With the announcement that
women were once again to take
over the hall, wheels began to
grind in an effort to discover some
way which would make the wom
en feel badly about shoving the
men over to Wilbur Hall—that's
our name for Dibble.
So the boys are having a bunch
of small placards printed. You
know the type—"Not responsible
for lost articles," "Watch your
hat," etc.
Only these are going to say "You
have taken this room away from a
veteran," "We are back in barracks
so you can have this room," and
similar phrases.
