# Can America, Russia Leant To Survive?

### 
Can America and Russia, so
different in their history and in
their ways of life, co-operate in
the organization of peace or must
they become the leaders of ir
reconcilable coalitions, preparing
for a final struggle in which nei
ther can survive?
Dr. Harold H. Fisher, director of
the Hoover Library on War, Rev
olution and Peace and Stanford
professor of history, suggests an
answer to these questions in two
lectures now revised and expand
ed for publication in book form,
entitled ' America and Russia in
the World Community."
Dr. Fisher believes that "if we
and the Russians can come to
realize that the goals we have in
common are fundamental for the
peace and well-being of nations,
while our differences are the re
sult of history and circumstance,
and are subject to change, we
shall have found the most neces
sary of all stepping stones to good
relations."
He warns, however, that '"if
America and Russia cannot over
come the fears, suspicions and pet
tiness that entangle their rela
tions. if they do not have the vis
ion and courage to meet the re
sponsibilities history has laid upon
them, they will have the grim and
final distinction of leading man
kind to self-destruction."
Dr. Fisher first became ac
quainted with Russia 25 years ago
during the great famine of 1921 -
23, when he served as an officer of
the American Relief Administra
tion under Herbert Hoover.
As professor of history and di
rector of the Hoover Library, he
has organized many collections of
documents and other source mate
rials relating to Russia. He is edi
tor of many books and articles
dealing with relief and Russia and
Eastern Europe before and since
World War I.
"America and Russia in the
World Community" is the publi
cation of two lectures Dr. Fisher
gave in Los Angeles in February.
1945. under the auspices of Clare
mont Colleges. The lectures have
bon expanded to include a dis
cussion of the United Nations Con
ference and problems related to
the end of the war and the atomic
bomb.—Betty BerteUn
