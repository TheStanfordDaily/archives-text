'"We must pay our bills."
Increased expenses of educating
GI students which their tuition pay
ments cannot meet have forced the
action of the Board of Trustees in
upping the tuition rates, according to
Herbert Clark Hoover, Stanford
trustee.
IN A GENERAL DISCUSSION of
Stanford and the problems it faces,
the 31st President of the United
States summed up the University's
action as one of "common necessity"
based upon the facts of business.
The education of the Gl's will cost
roughly $500,000, and their contribu
tion will amount to from $300,000 to
$350,000, Hoover explained.
Pointing out that a government
can issue bonds to meet a deficit or
a state-supported university draw
upon legislative grants. Hoover said
the temporary deficits incurred by
Stanford during the war cannot be
repeated in peacetime.
"Roughly one-half of a Stanford
student's educational expenses comes
from our endowment. We have a
duty to meet in educating the Gl's,
and this duty can only be met in part
by admitting more students and up
ping the tuition rates," Hoover ex
plained.
In the past the University has so
licited funds from graduates on the
premise that they should pay back
as much of the endowment's con
tribution to their education as is pos
sible.
"MANY OF THEM HAVE," Hoov
er added, pointing out that Stanford
through its loan funds and employ
ment services has always aided a
large percentage of the students to
earn their education on easy terms.
"Now in meeting these new obli
gations to the Gl's, many people
must make sacrifices for the com
mon necessity."
