# CAMPUS OPINION—Sexes Battle Over Dibble-Branner
## 
### 
'Editor's note: Unless someone has a bigger and better point on this Dibble-Branner situa
tion the Daily considers the matter closed as far as its columns are concerned. Nothing sub
mitted yet has made the editor change the opinion expressed in the editorial columns, name
ly that the University action was justified as being the best choice possible between several
injustices. Life around here certainly isn't going to be the uncrowded, luxurious existence it
once was, but from here we can't discover any place that's any better off.)
In answer to Andrew L. Bowman's masterpiece of sarcasm on the Dibble-Branner contro
versy published last Wednesday by the Daily, I would like to submit in retribution a consensus
zi female opinion on the subject.
First of all, the idea that the present-day coed comes to college with a bulging bank account
and social rather than intellectual interests, as implied by Mr. Bowman, is erroneous and causes
this" provisionally-accepted-first-quarter Freshman to see a bright Stanford Red! I want an edu
cation or I would be sitting in a beach chair right now instead of a desk.
If serving in the armed forces has inculcated in American manhood no more than the desire

to have American womanhood share
the inconveniences of their return
to civilian life, then the effects of
service have been more demoraliz
ing ' than we have been led to be
lieve.
We girls certainly know by now
that the boys gave up three or four
cf their best years for us and that
they werert't out on a picnic dur
ing those years, but when a woman
gives up twenty or thirty of her
best years for the "minor discom
forts" of the bearing and rearing of
a family, and women have been
doing it for some time, she doesn't
yell all over the place for sympathy
r.nd" compensation when it's all over.
In times long past the return of
the warrior was an occasion for
much ceremony but the world has
progressed since then. Now that
•we have such grown-up toys as the
{.torn bomb to play with, let's try to
pattern our attitudes and actions
accordingly.
God protect the poor college girl!

The Editor, Sir:
This returned former Stanford
student, admittedly one of the oc
cupants of Branner Hall to be oust
ed at the conclusion of summer
quarter, finds some disagreement
with the reasoning of your editorial
in a recent Daily in regard to the
question of Branner Hall.
The question of who shall occupy
Branner next fall is certainly diffi
cult to settle on the basis of merit
;.lone. With your line of reasoning
apparently Stanford is to continue
to enroll considerably more women
than it did prior to the war. If my
pre-war Stanford life was any fair
sampling, the fact that there were
considerably more men than women
mrolled was definitely a selling
point to make it desirable to enter
ing women students.
You then let everyone slap them
selves on the back and say that
students are capable of sacrifices for
the long-run good of their univer
sity. Perhaps erroneously, I believe
that a university exists for the good
that it can do for its students, rather
than vice versa.
Since Stanford apparently has ad
mitted so many students that it
cannot admit a normal pre-war size
class of freshman women and house
them all without requiring Branner
rtS well as the regular women's resi
dences, it would seem that there is
a definite lack of co-operation and
co-ordination between the Regis
trar's Office and that of the Director
of Student Housing. If we are to
continue to feel the pinch to find
space for entering women, and the
University is determined to admit
the usual number of freshman wom
"u. how docs it happen that women
■fiansfers with advanced standing
;:re still being admitted?
It would seem that someone con
nected with University residences
has been rather deceitful with Stan

ford students. If the men were put
into Branner this summer, when it
had already been decided that wom
en were to return in the fall, why j
were the men asked to make a
choice between Toyon and Branner,
which supposedly was to save them
from having to shift about again in
the fall? Also, as many very bitter
women will tell you, why were the
former women occupants of Bran
ner given high priorities on the ra
tio system of room drawings for the
fall, when they were to move back
into Branner again?
If the move was purely opportu- I
nistic, to be permanent only if the !
University failed to contract . for
Dibble for veterans, why was this
policy not made public so that the
persons involved could have made
their own decisions before having to
signify a preference?
All these accusations refer to the
past. Now a word about the present
and future. If Stanford has made
up its mind, and what being or in
stitution is more adept or privi
leged at changing its mind, that
women are to return to Branner,
certainly no veteran living in Dib
ble will feel satisfied or repaid for
his sacrifices until the women of
this institution are required to en
dure conditions just as crowded as
his own. There has long been a
wide disparity between accommo
dations for men and women in this
University, and the addition of the
Dibble wards for men can only
serve to widen it.
Before any veteran should be
moved out of Branner, every wom
en's residence on the campus should
be filled to the same degree as the
men's dormitories.
