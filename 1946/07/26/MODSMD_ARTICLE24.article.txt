The Hoover Library on War,
Peace and Revolution has been an
integral part of the University's re
search facilities since 1920.
The 14 - story, 274 -foot tower
which now houses the expanding
collection of books, documents,
maps, pamphets, and photographs
on man's martial struggles and at
tempts at peace will be a perma
nent focal point for the world's re
search workers on war and peace.

nings. The first crate of books ar
rived at Stanford in IS2O and a
wing of the Stanford Library was
set aside to house the unclassified
material that began pouring in. in

brary would outgrow its facilities,
pans were aid for a new building,
the $(>OO,OOO Hoover Tower, begun
in 1939. which now dominates (he
Peninsula skyline.
