# Road Repair Crew Begins Work Behind Post Office
## 
### 
After a number of delays due to the lack of labor, work on
the repair of Santa Teresa Street in back of the Post Office was
begun this week.
A geological condition which Buildings and Grounds Super
intendent James W. McDonnell reports is general on the campus

had caused a severe buckling of the
pavement which made automobile
. riving over this section somewhat
hazardous. The condition consists
of a water seepage which results
in a swelling of the dirt beneath
the street and the resultant buck
. ing effect.
In order to repair the condition,
the road crew was forced to exca
vate an unusually large pad deep
. rea. This was necessary McDon
nell said, in order to dry out a large
enough area beneath the road fault.
THE PROJECT WAS scheduled
for completion this week, but the
■unusual weather conditions have
forced a delay. It will be necessary
to dry the area thoroughly after the
rain, and if the hole is soaked heav
ily. further digging will be required.
The project is being completed at
cost of approximately one hun
dred dollars. A tractor and a loader
were the only mechanical equip
ment involved in the work.
REPAIRS TO OTHER SIMILAR
road faults on the campus are not
anticipated at the present time. The
road being fixed is under constant
;ise. and its immediate repair was
imperative. However, the mainte
nance crew is still undermanned and
cannot handle more than regular
general maintenance.
Plans for further campus im
provements during the remainder
of the quarter and during vacation
?.re now being formulated by the
office of the Director of Planning.
A number of projects are in the
planning stage, but final decisions
cepend upon the availability of
material and labor.
