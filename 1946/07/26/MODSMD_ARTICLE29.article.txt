### 
If you are one of those people
who hate to wait for the curtain to
go up, then you had better go see
the three one-acts the Speech and
Drama Department is producing
July 31 and August" 1 in the Nitery.
The three comedies, "Winter's
End," "The Scheming Lieutenant"
and "Fumed Oak," will be produced
without curtains or scenery of any
kind in the center of the Nitery
floor. Chairs will be arranged on all
four sides of the "stage" and the au
dience will be distinguished from
the actors by the fact that they are
watching.
The plays, which are experiments
in center staging, are being pro
duced by the Stanford Speech and
Drama Department as .part of an
extensive summer drama schedule.
All three are comedies. "Fumed
Oak" is the story of the revolt of a
henpecked husband against his
domineering wife and whining
daughter. It is one of the most fre
quently presented one-act plays of
Noel Coward, famed English play
wright. who is the author of "Blithe
Spirit," "Bittersweet," and "Hay
Fever."
Admission to the three plays will
be 25 cents, payable at the door of
the Nitery. There will be no re
served seats for cither performance.
Directors for the three plays are Ju
lio Francescotti, George Wilson, and
Charles Ingram. Newton Arnold is
assistant director for all three plays,
and Norman Philbrick is in charge
of over-all supervision.
