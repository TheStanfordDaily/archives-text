# Adams Wants Dibble Labor
## 
### 
Work on the single men's quar
ters at Dibble is expected to start a
week from today according to
Dwight B. Adams, University di
rector of the project.
"1 think that we ought to use
student help as much as possible,'
said Adams, explaining that full
time workers will be wanted at
soon as Stanford officially takes ovei
the buildings from the army, but
that a plan for utilization of part
time workers had not yet been com
pleted.
He said that one of the biggest
problems facing the University in
regard to Dibble was that of secur
ing janitorial workers, and that us
ing student help on a part-time ba
sis next fall is one possible solution
being considered.
Informed of the Collins commit
tee's recent recommendation that ■«
"Stanford at Dibble" day be ar
ranged before the end of summer
quarter, Adams expressed approva;
of the idea and said that in two or
three weeks some of the bindings
will be in such condition that stu
dents could get a good idea of what
life at Dibble will be like next fall
