### 
SONA captured the intramural League II softball title yes
terday evening by defeating Phi Delta Kappa II as the Chi Psi's
were shut out by the Firehouse. Chi Psi's. victory over the
Navy outfit Tuesday night was erased from the books with the
announcement that the Chi Psi's were using an illegal player.

DICK WEST RLAYEI) for the fra
ternity that night and was not reg
istered in the University. This forced
the Chi Psi's to forfeit their contest
to the Navy team.
This combine gave the Navy team
the undisputed League II title as
they completed their schedule un
defeated, a full two games in front
of the second place outfits.
Ned Wolfarth hurled the best ball
seen in mural play this summer as
he allowed but two hits last night
when the Firehouse swept past the
Chi Psi's. The Chi Psi's entered the
contest a bit overconfident as a re
sult of their three to one victory
over SONA Tuesday night.
PITCHER WOLFARTH led the at
tack on the fraternity's Ed Luce as
he connected for two of the firemen's
many hits. Catcher Frank Pfyl was
highly instrumental in victory as he
called the pitches to perfection. Only
two men went as far as second base
in the 7-0 win.
It took two extra innings before
Encina 1W could overcome Encina
IF in the other game played in
League 11. Two hits, a pair of walks,
an error, and two outfield flies com
bined to bring in four runs and vic
tory in the ninth inning.
PAT PATTON STARTED for 1W
and was lifted in the sixth as he of
fered little trouble for lE. As has
been their custom, the East wing
went into an early lead that wasn't
relinquished until the seventh in
ning when an error put Chavalas on
first, which was combined with a
hit and two outfield flies to tie up the
ball game.
Mike Schulman went the route for
IE but was hit hard all the way as
was evidenced by the ten putouts
credited to left fielder Doug Adams.
Encina lE's trouble seemed to be
the failure to capitalize with men
on bases. Jack Donovan, who led
the hitting with three for three, was
left stranded on third after he trip
led |n the first. Jerry Hill, their
manager, worked Patton for two of
his four walks only to be stranded
both times.
GUS BLAIRE PITCHED runless
ball for the three innings he worked
to receive credit for the win.
There were no games played in
League I as the teams shied away
from the wet fields.
League play for both leagues

should be completed by this time
next week. Next week's play will
consist only of those games that were
missed earlier in the season.
When the schedule is completed,
the top teams in each league will ap
pear in an elimination tourney to
decide the summer intramural soft
ball champion.
