"Twenty - five thousand dollars
will be appropriated during the
next scholastic year for scholar
ships" reads part of the story on the
raise of tuition in Monday's Daily.
These scholarships are to go to those
whose education might have been
interrupted due to higher costs.
Athletes as well as anybody else
will be hit by the tuition rise. There
is no reason why a percentage of
this fund should not go to athletes
or prospective athletes who might
be forced to go to another univer
sity where money would offer less
of a problem.
We believe that at least 10 per
cent at the minimum should go to
ward aiding athletes to complete
their studies. They are just as much
a part of Stanford as the book worm.
If they need aid in remaining on
campus, they should gel that aid.
With the raise of tuition, the vet
eran is left with a nickel to spend
on books and materials. Consider
ing the need of the University for
money, perhaps a campaign should
be instigated on campus to donate
the nickel to the University. What
else can you do with a nickel?

CANDIDATES FOR THE United
States Davis Cup team are now

down to five including Stanford's
former champion Ted Schroede .
With four men to be selected,
Schroeder appears virtually a
to be chosen. The other candidates
are Frankie Parker, Jack Kramer,
Billy Talbert. and Gardner Mulloy.
Cal's Tom Brown was seemingly
left out in the cold, although Walter
Pate, non-playing captain of the
American team, said that he might
be brought along to Australia to be
used as a "spai'e" should our team
defeat Sweden in the interzone fi
nals. After his brilliant play at
Wimbledon. Brown deserves more
than an outside chance toward mak -
ing the team.
