# Milland Is Medico In Sunday Movie

becomes a doctor specializing in
troubles of the heart in "The Doctor
Takes a Wife," this week's cinema
masterpiece playing on the McCaul

Playing opposite Milland will be
the beauteous Miss Loretta Young
who lives alone writing books and
likes it until Mr. Milland comes
along.
Two thrill-packed chapters of "The
Secret of Treasure Island." numbers
5 and 6 will complete the bill. When
last seen Gwen Gaze and Larry Kent
were buried under a collapsing tun
nel because of the dastardly work of
the Mole Men. Further momentous
developments are expected. Admis
sion is 20 cents, children under 3
must be carried by their mothers.
