# Professor McBain Blasts Military Atomic Control
## 
### 
"If control of atomic energy falls into the hands of the military,
a professor will not be able to give an ordinary lecture on the
structure of matter without fearing he is violating some military
security measure."
This was the highlight of a denunciation of military control

of atomic energy by James W. Mc-^

Bain, Stanford
professor of
chemistry, speak
ing as a member
of the Northern
j California Asso
ciation of Scien
tists, western af
filiate of the
American Feder
ation of Scien
| tists.
"Atomic physi
cists tell me they

could have shortened the war by ,
a year and a half had they not
been working under military re- ;
strictions," Mcßain said. , |
The 400 - member association of ;
San Francisco and Bay Area scien
tists is continuing its fight against
military control of atomic energy. It
emphasizes the dangers they see in i
amendments to the McMahon bill
for atomic energy control now be
ing thrashed out between the Sen
ate and the House.
The association finds the follow
ing dangers in the House amend
ments to the McMahon bill:
1. They provide for military con
trol of atomic programs, which in
peacetime sets an extraordinary
precedent.
2. They set up military restric
tions under which scientists refuse
to work.
3. They prevent the interchange ,
of safe, non-military scientific in
formation between countries, pro- j
ducing artificial secrecy.
4. They permit private patents on
atomic energy, which will enablej
monopoly control of processes po- I
tentially dangerous to society.
