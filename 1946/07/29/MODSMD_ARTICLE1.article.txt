Gene Talmadge's comment on
the lynch-shooting of four Ne
groes in Wplton County, Georgia,
was, "I think such incidents are
to be regretted." Why? Bad pub
licity?
Talmadge spent most of his cam-

paign whooping
it up for "white
supremacy." The
sturdy yeomen
of Walton Coun
ty put "white su
premacy" into
effect. Talmadge
is as guilty as
Julius Streicher,
whom we are cur
rently trying at

Nuernburg for equivalent offenses.
Today in Paris the European
Peace Conference will open. The
task of the 300 delegates from 21
nations that fought the Axis in
Europe will he to hammer out
treaties of peace with Finland.
Italy, Rumania, Bulgaria, and
Hungary. It is presumed that
they will accept the points on
which the Foreign Ministers' Con
ference agreed, and will try their
collective hand at settling the re
maining questions.
The Russian delegation .to the
peace conference includes the "for
eign ministers" of the Lithuanian,
Latvian, and Esthonian SSR's.
Whether this is to demonstrate the
alleged consent of what were once
three independent republics to their
forcible annexation by Russia, or is
the beginning of a drive to give
Russia three more votes in the U.N.
Assembly—membership has already
been accorded the Ukrainian and
White Russian SSR's — I couldn't
say.
Will Rogers, Jr., Democratic
nominee for Senator from Califor
nia, former Congressman and for
mer Army officer, said in a speech
to the Utah Young Democrats
that he didn't see how the "aver
age veteran could accept the prin
ciples of the Republican party."
I would appreciate a good defini
tion of the "average veteran." And
I would like to have as well a brief
summary of the principles of the
Republican and Democratic parties.
A summary, that is, of principles of
which each member of the party is
conscious and which each member
would accept.
The death of Gertrude Stein is
to be sincerely regretted. From a
personal point of view. I would
say that she understood the G.I.
in Europe better than most of
those people in the States who
had and have so much to say
about him. I cannot judge her
writings as art, but the loss of a
mind and heart such as hers is a
loss indeed. (Her latest book.
'"Brewsie and Willie," dealing with
American soldiers in Europe, was
published last week.)

Will Rogers, Jr., Democratic
nominee for Senator from Califor
nia, former Congressman and for
mer Army officer, said in a speech
to the Utah Young Democrats
that he didn't see how the "aver
age veteran could accept the prin
ciples of the Republican party."
I would appreciate a good defini

I would like to have as well a brief

The death of Gertrude Stein is
to be sincerely regretted. From a
personal point of view. I would

'"Brewsie and Willie," dealing with
American soldiers in Europe, was
published last week.)

Gene Talmadge's comment on

it up for "white
supremacy." The
sturdy yeomen
of Walton Coun

is as guilty as
Julius Streicher,
whom we are cur
rently trying at

Nuernburg for equivalent offenses.
Today in Paris the European
Peace Conference will open. The
task of the 300 delegates from 21
nations that fought the Axis in
Europe will he to hammer out
treaties of peace with Finland.
Italy, Rumania, Bulgaria, and
Hungary. It is presumed that
they will accept the points on
which the Foreign Ministers' Con
ference agreed, and will try their
collective hand at settling the re
maining questions.
The Russian delegation .to the
peace conference includes the "for
eign ministers" of the Lithuanian,
Latvian, and Esthonian SSR's.
Whether this is to demonstrate the
alleged consent of what were once
three independent republics to their
forcible annexation by Russia, or is
the beginning of a drive to give
Russia three more votes in the U.N.
