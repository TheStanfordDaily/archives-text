## 
### DON LANGENDORF 
After a lapse of 45 years, Michigan returns to Stanford's
football schedule in 1947 for their first contest since the original
Rose Bowl game in Pasadena New Year's Day of 1902, it was
announced by A 1 Masters, Stanford's graduate manager. The
1947 contest will be played in Ann Arbor, Michigan on October 4.

The contract as signed between"*"
the two schools calls for a four- j
game series with the other three j
games to be announced in the fu- I
ture. Two of those games will of
course be played at Stanford. It is j
anticipated that the final game of
this series will be played in 1952 to |
commemorate the fiftieth anniver
sary of the initial Rose Bowl game.
THIS GAME WILL BE Stanford's
first intersectional contest since the
27-0 defeat in 1942 at the hands of
Notre Dame. This will be the first
time in fourteen years that Stanford I
will meet a Western Conference op
ponent. the last time resulting in a !
scoreless tie with Northwestern at
Chicago's Soldiers' Field.
In their 1902 battle, former Stan- j
ford coach "Hurry-up" Yost brought
one of the greatest teams ever to
play ball up to that time to Cali
fornia and swamped Stanford 49 to j
0. The Wolverines were trained to
perfection as they used but eleven j
men the entire game. After the
game was over, Yost said that Stan
ford compared favorably with any j
team on Michigan's schedule and
could probably have defeated the.
Carlisle Indians.
MICHIGAN WAS ANXIOUS TO
meet the Indians again the follow
ing year but it took some 44 years j
before the two schools could get to- i
gether again to agree on dates.
Michigan was last seen on the Pa- [
cific Coast when they romped over
California in 1940.
The Wolverines are consistently
near the top of the Big Nine con
ference and are ably coached by
Fritz Crisler.
