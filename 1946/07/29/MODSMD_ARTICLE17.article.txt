ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN AT
STANFORD DEPARTMENT: An
ex-Marine enrolled at Stanford
this quarter, went up to the Post
Office and rented a box. He fur
nished the Marine Corps with his
Stanford address and sat back and
waited for his terminal leave
check and other small items to
come through.
After five weeks nothing had
arrived, so he went to the postal

authorities to
see what was
wrong. They
told him.
It seems that
the box had
been held for
several years
by one of the
minor charac
ters who live
up on the back
end of the cam-

pus and who appear only to get
their mail each morning. Saicl
character had not paid the box
rent for several quarters, so the
P.O. rented the box to our Ma
rine friend, but the character still
had the key. Investigation dis
closed that the character would
come down each morning, open
the box, see someone else's mail
and tear it up.
Our friend has written for an
other check.

Contrary to a general rumor.
Resident Assistants at Wilbur Hall
—Dibble, if you're old-fashioned
will not wear first sergeant's
stripes.
Today's orchids go to the veter
ans' wives who are working their
husbands' way through college.

Three of Stanford's more seri

ous, dignified males were invited
to luncheon at Lagunita the other
day. Somehow, their attention was
drawn to the fact that pennies are
put in the fish pond there in order
to keep algae from forming in the
water.
The boys thought they saw a
chance to get even with the ad
ministration or* what they consid
ered a tuition overcharge, so they
took off their shoes and socks and
went wading. They collected 38
cents.
An R.A. was watching the whole
procedure from an upstairs win
dow. She thought the whole thing
very funny, but being a good little
RA. went down to the pool and
replaced the pennies from her
own purse.
The pennies are gone again now,
however, and one of the boys is
richer by another 18 cents.

Today's last yarn concerns a stu
dent in the Grad School of Busi
ness and his wife, who decided to
go to Yosemite for their vacation
between spring and summer quar
ters.
Without reservations, they took
off for the land of falling waters.
Upon arrival they discovered sev
eral thousand other people had
decided to go to Yosemite lor their
vacations at the same time.
Our friend had an idea, how
ever. He went to Camp Curry,
walked up to the desk and ad
mitted he didn't have reservations,
but said that he was from Stanford
and asked if they could give him a
place to stay for a few days.
The clerk gave him a jaundiced
look.
"Stanford, what's that?" he said.

Today's last yarn concerns a stu
dent in the Grad School of Busi
ness and his wife, who decided to
go to Yosemite for their vacation
between spring and summer quar
ters.
Without reservations, they took
off for the land of falling waters.
Upon arrival they discovered sev
eral thousand other people had
decided to go to Yosemite lor their
vacations at the same time.
Our friend had an idea, how
ever. He went to Camp Curry,
walked up to the desk and ad
mitted he didn't have reservations,
but said that he was from Stanford
and asked if they could give him a
place to stay for a few days.
The clerk gave him a jaundiced
look.
"Stanford, what's that?" he said.

ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN AT
STANFORD DEPARTMENT: An
ex-Marine enrolled at Stanford
this quarter, went up to the Post
Office and rented a box. He fur
nished the Marine Corps with his
Stanford address and sat back and
waited for his terminal leave
check and other small items to
come through.
After five weeks nothing had
arrived, so he went to the postal

authorities to
see what was
wrong. They
told him.
It seems that
the box had
been held for
several years
by one of the
minor charac
ters who live
up on the back
end of the cam-

pus and who appear only to get
their mail each morning. Saicl
character had not paid the box
rent for several quarters, so the
P.O. rented the box to our Ma
rine friend, but the character still
had the key. Investigation dis
closed that the character would
come down each morning, open
the box, see someone else's mail
and tear it up.
Our friend has written for an
other check.

Three of Stanford's more seri

ous, dignified males were invited
to luncheon at Lagunita the other
day. Somehow, their attention was
drawn to the fact that pennies are
put in the fish pond there in order
to keep algae from forming in the
water.
The boys thought they saw a
chance to get even with the ad
ministration or* what they consid
ered a tuition overcharge, so they
took off their shoes and socks and
went wading. They collected 38
cents.
An R.A. was watching the whole
procedure from an upstairs win
dow. She thought the whole thing
very funny, but being a good little
RA. went down to the pool and
replaced the pennies from her
own purse.
The pennies are gone again now,
however, and one of the boys is
