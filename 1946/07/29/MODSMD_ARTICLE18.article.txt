To the disgruntled vet who
thinks the whole Dibble plan is a
diabolical scheme of the War De
partment to ease him back into
the Army, let me state definitely
that dog-tags will not be worn
except at meal time. I speak with
authority, for, you see, I happen
to be a Dibble alumnus. I re
ceived my B.G. (Bachelor of Gold
brick) from there last November
and am now pursuing further
studies in that same subject as a
sharp - cornered Stanford fresh
man. Someone must have mislaid
a grade point or two somewhere
as I'm a frosh here, and this fall
will probably be a post-grad at
the local infirmary.
To those who complain of a lack
of practical education. I say: Men,
cease your worrying about occu
pational training. Dibble contains
one of the most completely equip
ped occupational therapy shops in
the country, and who knows, the
day may come when there is a
real market for concrete bookends
and cellophane doilies.
And there are other consola
tions. Inmates will be treading the
floors once trod by some of the
Army's more beautiful nurses.
Capable, that is. Quite so, and
there used to be a coke machine
down by the Red Cross (you know
what that is, a combined Cellar
and Registrar's Office, both free
and with Gray Ladies), a machine
which spewed out coke bottles
like the Daily spews out words,
diligently.
Ah. nostalgia! To stroll once
again through those cubicles, par
don me, hallways near my old
ward, correction, wing 25. listen
ing to the fond voice of the ward
Ooy, oops. Resident Assistant, tell
ing the patients, er. students, to
please be at ease, kindly.
Yes indeed, it looks as if I'm be
ing demoted back to my old alma
nater, and I may add that I have
to sympathy with you old return -
,ng Stanfordites who flex with
lorror at the lifted face of your
>ld school. You think you have
roubles! You don t like to see

Stanford burst at the seams like
this? Kid stuff! Your reaction can
be nothing compared to my own
disquietude at seeing my beloved
Dibble's gentle hush torn by hun
dreds of moth-eaten, page-tear
ing, loud - mouthed, brawling,
grass - green, irreverent Stanford
Roughs.

The Editor, Sir:
This is in reply to the rather
puerile letter by Andrew L. Bow
man criticizing the Administration
for the raise in tuition, which was
published in Wednesday's Daily.
Mr. Bowman evidently did not
read very closely the recent series
of articles in the Daily concerning
the financial position of the Uni
versity. Considering the losses
that the University has been sus
taining, it is surprising that tui
tion was not raised long ago.
There is only one place where
the blame for the tuition raise
may properly be placed, and that
is in the hands of Congress. The
nation is already reaping the prod
ucts of Congressional bungling in
regard to the OPA and excessive
governmental borrowing during a
boom period. More is yet to come.
The only way for the veteran to
counteract the increased costs of
an education is to write his Con
gressmen urging increased allow
ances under the G.I. Bill. Accord
ing to the policies of the present
Administration labor is entitled to
an increase in wages in conform
ity with increased costs of living.
In line with this reasoning, wheth
er it be right or wrong, the veteran
is also entitled to such increases.
Write your Congressmen! The
Senators from California are Wil
liam F. Knowland and Sheridan
Downey. The Representative from
this district is John Z. Anderson.
