# A 						Farm Boy and "Bloomer Girl"
## 
### 
With a Stanford alum, Dick Smart, in the lead role of Jefferson Lightfoot Calhoun, "Bloomer
Girl" has captured the heart of San Francisco. With such grand music, dancing, acting, and

costuming, it's no wonder the play |
ran two years on Broadway.

The thin plot
is filled out by
music that is
perfection. The
story is laid in
the small east
ern manufac
turing town of
Cicero Falls
where a hoop
skirt manufac
turer attempts
to marry off
his last unmar-

ried daughter, Evelina, to a young
Kentucky gentleman, Jefferson !
Lightfoot Calhoun. Slave-running
and women's suffrage are thrown
in as extras.
OUTSTANDING IN OUR MIND
was the dancing of Daisy, the
maid, played by Peggy Campbell
of "Oklahoma" fame. One of the
evening's high spots was her danc
ing and singing of "T'morra, T'-
morra" in the fourth scene of the j
first act.
The leading roles of Evelina and
Jeff Calhoun are played by Nan
ette Fabray and Dick Smart. Miss
Fabray bubbles over with per- i
sonality throughout the entire j
performance. Outstanding was j
her vocal of "Right as the Rain." j
Smart sang the show's most re- ;
membered tune, "Evelina." Smart's
home is in Los Gatos, and he re
ceived his start in show business j
at the Pasadena Community The
ater.
THE NUMBER WE ENJOYED
most was the Civil War ballet in j
the second act, supervised by Li- j
dija Franklin.
Other outstanding numbers j
were Dooley Wilson of "As Time i
Goes By" fame singing "The Eagle I
and Me," Richard Huey singing "I
Got a Song," and the entire cast j
singing "Sunday in Cicero Falls." :
The music was written by Har- ;
old Arlen with the words by E. Y. ;
Harburg. The costumes by Miles j
White were excellent.
For anyone who wants an eve- I
ning of wonderful entertainment,
we heartily recommend "Bloomer j
Girl" at San Francisco's Curran j
Theater.â€”Don Langendorf.
