AFTER FOUR YEARS of wait
ing, Stanford has finally decided on
an intersectional football game. The j
University's action in signing a
four-game contract with the Uni- !
versity of Michigan is sure to meet ]
with the approval of the entire stu- j
dent body.
Considering that Santa Clara and
the University of San Francisco are
retained on our schedule for 1947,
the big red machine is in for a
long ten-game schedule next year.
The question arises as to when will !
the Big Game be played? This may !
move the traditional Cal game into
Thanksgiving week-end. Our sug
gi -;tion would be to hold it the
week-end following that one and j
play the Cal game the same day as
the U.C.L.A.-U.S.C. game.
This would certainly be better \
than opening our season a week
earlier, playing our opening game
before fall quarter opens. Not only
that, but it would return the team
to the pre-war habit of getting a
week-end off before the Big Game.

THE ANGELO BERTELLi CASE
reaches its climax today back in I
Boston. It seems to be the same
issue of slavery: does he belong to
the Los Angeles Dons of the All-
America Conference or to the
Boston Yanks of the National Pro
fessional League.
Bertelli supposedly received a
$1,000 bonus from the Dons as a
reward for promising to sign a con
tract with them. A few months
later the former Notre Dame star
signed a contract with Boston. The
Dons sought an injunction denying
Bertelli the right to play for Bos
ton, saying that the exchange of let
ters and the check denoted a con
tract. That is where the case is
today.
While the Yanks are wrong in
<iis case, we believe that no man
should be so tied up that he cannot
juit at any time. All athletic con
tacts read in such a way that the
earn can fire a player, but the play
»r cannot quit in order to take a
setter offer.

versity of Michigan is sure to meet ]
with the approval of the entire stu- j
dent body.
Considering that Santa Clara and
the University of San Francisco are
retained on our schedule for 1947,
the big red machine is in for a
long ten-game schedule next year.
The question arises as to when will !
the Big Game be played? This may !
move the traditional Cal game into
Thanksgiving week-end. Our sug
gi -;tion would be to hold it the
week-end following that one and j
play the Cal game the same day as
the U.C.L.A.-U.S.C. game.
This would certainly be better \
than opening our season a week
earlier, playing our opening game
before fall quarter opens. Not only
that, but it would return the team
to the pre-war habit of getting a
week-end off before the Big Game.

THE ANGELO BERTELLi CASE
reaches its climax today back in I
Boston. It seems to be the same
issue of slavery: does he belong to
the Los Angeles Dons of the All-
America Conference or to the
Boston Yanks of the National Pro
fessional League.
Bertelli supposedly received a
$1,000 bonus from the Dons as a
reward for promising to sign a con
tract with them. A few months
later the former Notre Dame star
signed a contract with Boston. The
Dons sought an injunction denying
Bertelli the right to play for Bos
ton, saying that the exchange of let
ters and the check denoted a con
tract. That is where the case is
today.
While the Yanks are wrong in
<iis case, we believe that no man
should be so tied up that he cannot
juit at any time. All athletic con
tacts read in such a way that the
earn can fire a player, but the play
»r cannot quit in order to take a
setter offer.
The All - America Conference, j
aided the National Professional
in forming their organiza- i
ion. When the NPL retaliates, the
\AC threatens court action. I
