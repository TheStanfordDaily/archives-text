# Legal Eagles Face D.U.s For League I Mural Lead
## 
### 
Delta Upsilon clashes with the
Legal Eagles Tuesday evening to
decide the undisputed leader of in
tramural League I in the feature
game of the week.
After a one-week rest from ac
tion due to the unrest of finals, the
law students return to action in
quest of the league lead and even
tual title. They meet a rough op
ponent in coming up against the un
defeated fraternity. The Eagles are
also undefeated in league play; so
this contest should decide the league
title.
FROM PAST GAMES. THIS ONE
appears a toss-up, even money take
your choice. The D.U.'s appear to
have the edge on pitching ,but the
Legal Eagles have had no difficulty
with pitchers this season.
In Tuesday's other League I bat
te, the Phi Psi's try for an even won
and loss record in their game with
Phi Delta Kappa I. A win by either
team puts them into a tie for third
place in the standings. The Phi
Delta Kappas' only win was a re
sult of a default.
Over in League 11, Encina 1W
comes to grips with the Chi Psi fra
ternity to decide second place in the
standings. Though both teams have
completed their season, they ended
up in a tie for second, and will play
it off Tuesday. Though the Chi Psi's
have lost their last two games, man
aging to collect a mere two hits in
their last one, they must rule the
favorite as a result of a previous

win over IW.
In the only other game of the
day, the Firehouse will replay their
game with Encin-a IE which was
protested when it was discovered
one of the firemen was wearing
spikes.
SHOULD THE FIREHOUSE WIN
their game, they will then be tied
for second place, necessitating an
other play-off. That being the case,
they will meet with the winner of
the Chi Psi-Encina 1W game Thurs
day for the second-place position in
the standings.
With this week's contests, mural
play is expected to end its regular
season. Howevei", the top three
teams from each league will have a
round robin affair to decide the
summer intramural Softball cham
pionship. This will probably start
next week ifc the leagues are able
to finish up this week.
