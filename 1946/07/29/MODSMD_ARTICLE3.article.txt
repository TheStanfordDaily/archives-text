## 
### 
Branner's all-campus dance to be
held August 17 will be a semi-for
mal, date affair, Chuck Guasti, social
chairman, announced yesterday.
While the hall has not yet acquired
a band, Guasti guarantees that a
first class music-making organization
will be on hand. Other attractions
of Branner's first and last splash in
the social swim as a male hall will
be that there will be no admission
charge and refreshments will be
served.
Branner Club ex-com has decided
to shoot the works on the dance to
make it the biggest social function
of the summer season. There is no
need to save money now, says Frank
Creed, big wheel of the hall, since
the girls will be back in fall quarter.
