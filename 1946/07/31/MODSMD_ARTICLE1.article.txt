The situation in Tel-Aviv rates
top spot tonight. The British,
whose national lust for law and
order has led them into unpleas
ant situations before, are con
ducting a house-to-house search
of the city in an attempt to smash
the Jewish underground organi
zations that hlcw up the King
David Hotel in Jerusalem last
week. All residents of Tel-Aviv
must stay indoors at all times, ex
cept for two hours per day. Com
munications with the outside have
been cut off. There are machine
guns and barbed-wire entangle
ments in the streets. Any viola
tors of the curfew will he shot on
sight. How reminiscent!
The 21-nation European Peace
Conference which opened in Paris

Monday has a
lot of problems
on its hands. It
will be called
upon to solve the
questions that
the Foreign Min
isters of the Big
Four could not.
But it has made
a good start —
complete pub-

licity will be allowed for its proceed
ings. At last, at long last, "open
covenants openly arrived at."
Secretary Byrnes had promised
to support with the influence of
the United States any recommen
dation hacked by two-thirds of
the nations represented. Theoreti
cally. the Conference has only ad
visory powers, but Byrnes' state
ment included specifically even
recommendations contrary to the
agreements already reached by
the Foreign Ministers.
I think it noteworthy that there
"vas heavy and prolonged applause
from the delegates when Byrnes
stated that the U.S. had renounced
isolationism permanently.
The treaty drafts prepared by
the Foreign Ministers' conference
have been released. They cover
peace terms for Italy, Finland.
Hungary. Bulgaria, and Rumania,
and in general provide for a grand
total of a billion dollars in repa
rations—in cash or capital goods—
restrictions on armaments, and
losses of territory. Rumania is
rewarded for her tardy declara
tion of war on Germany with
Transylvania, however. Italy loses
the Dodecanese Islands to Greece,
and all her African possessions,
destination unknown.
One problem unsolved by the
Foreign Ministers' conference is the
location of the Greek - Bulgarian
boundary. Since this involvees that
prominent minority, the Macedo
nians, who have had a resistance
movement against everybody since
approximately the tail ot Constanti
nople, it will take some solving.

week. All residents of Tel-Aviv
must stay indoors at all times, ex
cept for two hours per day. Com
munications with the outside have
been cut off. There are machine
guns and barbed-wire entangle
ments in the streets. Any viola
tors of the curfew will he shot on
sight. How reminiscent!
The 21-nation European Peace
Conference which opened in Paris

Monday has a
lot of problems
on its hands. It
will be called
upon to solve the
questions that
the Foreign Min
isters of the Big
Four could not.
But it has made
a good start —
complete pub-

licity will be allowed for its proceed
ings. At last, at long last, "open
covenants openly arrived at."
Secretary Byrnes had promised
to support with the influence of
the United States any recommen
dation hacked by two-thirds of
the nations represented. Theoreti
cally. the Conference has only ad
visory powers, but Byrnes' state
ment included specifically even
recommendations contrary to the
agreements already reached by
the Foreign Ministers.
I think it noteworthy that there
"vas heavy and prolonged applause
from the delegates when Byrnes
stated that the U.S. had renounced
isolationism permanently.
The treaty drafts prepared by
the Foreign Ministers' conference
have been released. They cover
peace terms for Italy, Finland.
Hungary. Bulgaria, and Rumania,
and in general provide for a grand
total of a billion dollars in repa
rations—in cash or capital goods—
restrictions on armaments, and
losses of territory. Rumania is
rewarded for her tardy declara
tion of war on Germany with
Transylvania, however. Italy loses
the Dodecanese Islands to Greece,
and all her African possessions,
destination unknown.
One problem unsolved by the
Foreign Ministers' conference is the
location of the Greek - Bulgarian
boundary. Since this involvees that
prominent minority, the Macedo
nians, who have had a resistance
movement against everybody since
approximately the tail ot Constanti
nople, it will take some solving.

The situation in Tel-Aviv rates
top spot tonight. The British,
whose national lust for law and
order has led them into unpleas
ant situations before, are con
ducting a house-to-house search
of the city in an attempt to smash
the Jewish underground organi
zations that hlcw up the King
David Hotel in Jerusalem last
week. All residents of Tel-Aviv
must stay indoors at all times, ex
cept for two hours per day. Com
