### 
DI3BLE DAY
One of our staff members who was a member of the opposi
tion on this Dibble business went out to take a look for himself
the other day. The result was that his opposition has cooled
down to lukewarm. The plant is in good shape, and what
with its proximity to Beltramo's Oasis and the cowboy movie
palace in Menlo, things aren't too gloomy.
The Daily feels that the "exiles" v/ho are sorrowfully pre
paring to be banished to Dibble might feel happier if they had
a look for themselves. For this reason we heartily support an
idea now building up for a Dibble Day.
Sometime toward the end of the guarter it is proposed that
Excorn back a student inspection celebration at Dibble. Trans
portation would be provided for all campus residents.
In Dibble Stanford has probably the best deal of anything
in the country for veteran's temporary housing. The campus
should have a chance to see for itself.
HONOR CODE
Complaints have been received at the Daily about proctoring
in midterm exams in Sociology 1 and Speech 15. Under the
Stanford Honor Code system this doesn't go.
There has been a tendency on the campus through the war
to think that the Honor Code is an unrealistic faith in human
nature. During ASTP days the system was greatly weakened.
It's time for us to realize that the Honor Code is worth keep
ing. A recent suggestion that Excom look into enforcement
and revitalization of the system 'was tabled, but the Daily is
more optomistic.
We feel that students, especially returning Stanford men,
realize the values of the Code and want it kept. Certainly
living the Honor Code means that faculty members must also
meet their responsibilities
If the mentors of Speech 15 and Sociology 1 don't think the
system is working, let them take it up with student govern
ment and fight it out.
But nothing is achieved by working outside the law.
