# Subtle 'Cluny,' Suave Boyer Please Critic
## 
### 
"Cluny Brown," now playing at
the Stanford Theater, is a subtle,
delightful comedy from Margery
Sharp's novel of the same name.
Most of the laugh lines are
quick, but very funny, and they
keep the theater-goer wide awake
and chuckling. Jennifer Jones
stars in the title role and does a
good job as the girl who "could not
find her place." Charles Boyer is
her so Die w hat eccentric lover, and
is the old suave Boyer with a new
humor.
Peter Lawford, Helen Walker,
Sara Algood, and Richard Haydn
give solid support performances.
The whole picture reflects the
careful hand of the director. Ernst
Lubitsch. who gives his touch to
an already delightful story.
Also playing on the same bill i-s
"The Well Groomed Bride, star
ring Olivia de Havilland. Hay
Milland, and Sonny Tufts. Allegedly
also a comedy, this opus has nei
ther big laughs nor little ones and
concerns the launching of a ship,
one magnum of champagne (a
two-quart bottle oi the piecious
liquid) and the punching of a
couple of lieutenants' TS slips
(one Army, one Navy). These in
gredients may sound funny, but
in "The Well Groomed Bride" they
add up to a little less than a dull
hour and a half of screen fare.
