# BOB CHANDLER
## Bull Session 
### 
A few days after Bob Collins
had organized his Wilbur Hall
committee, he had his committee
appear at an Excom meeting. For
what reason we don't know, may
be just to show his committee how
Excom flubbed around without ac
complishing much.
During the discussion on Wilbur

Hall problems
one of the
members of
Collins' com
mittee sug
gested a course
of action to be
followed by
Excom. One of
the gals on Ex
com said that it
could not be

done.
"I don't set* why not." said the
first female.
"Oh, but you've never been on
Excom," said the second with a
superior air.
For the benefit of the Excom
member, the suggestions were of
fered by Sylvia Berry. '42. Excom
member from 1940 to 1942, former
chairman of the Con Home Drive,
member of the Family Call Coun
cil in 1940 and all arouncWone of
the Biggest Women on Campus the
school ever had.

One of last quarter's grad stu

start in a few days.

A few days after Bob Collins
had organized his Wilbur Hall
committee, he had his committee
appear at an Excom meeting. For
what reason we don't know, may
be just to show his committee how
Excom flubbed around without ac
complishing much.
During the discussion on Wilbur

Hall problems
one of the
members of
Collins' com
mittee sug
gested a course
of action to be
followed by
Excom. One of
the gals on Ex
com said that it
could not be

done.
"I don't set* why not." said the
first female.
"Oh, but you've never been on
Excom," said the second with a
superior air.
For the benefit of the Excom
member, the suggestions were of
fered by Sylvia Berry. '42. Excom
member from 1940 to 1942, former
chairman of the Con Home Drive,
member of the Family Call Coun
cil in 1940 and all arouncWone of
