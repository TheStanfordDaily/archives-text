This is one book that should be
in every library. In my estimation
it is a must. It is "The Berlin Sto
ries" (New Directions: $3.50) by
Christopher Isherwood.
To most readers who look at the
novel as a form of true art and not
merely as something with which
to pass time, the two novels which
go to make up "The Berlin Stories"
will come as breaths of fresh air
in this year of unusually putrid
novels.
After "Prater Violet" was issued
last year and so widely received
and appreciated, many readers
went to their bookstores for copies
of Isherwood's earlier work. In
most cases these readers were not
disappointed in what they found.
"The Berlin Stories" is composed
of two novels. "The Last of Mr.
Norris" and "Goodbye to Berlin, '
both of which are equally as good
as anything which has been pub
lished in the last five years.
Indeed, it is my opinion that
"Goodbye to Berlin" is the greatest
novel now existent by any living
novelist.
In both of these novels, Isher

wood chronicles the lives of a wide
range of Berliners during that in
teresting period of modern history,
the formative and first years of the
Nazi regime.
Incidentally, for anyone who ha
not yet read it, I also recommend
Isherwood's latest, "Prater Vic -
