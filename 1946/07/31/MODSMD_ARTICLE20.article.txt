Due to a Pacific Coast Conference
ruling there will be no freshman
sports during the 1946-47 school
year, but that doesn't mean the sub
stitutes will rot away on the bench.
To take care of the surplus athletes
there will be a junior varsity foot
ball squad which will play a sched
ule of its own. This squad will be
composed of those who would oth
erwise sit out the season on the
bench.
So far, games have been sched
uled for the Jayvees with the Hum
boldt State and Santa Clara junior
varsities which will probably be
played as preliminaries to the var
sity grid tilts this fall. More games
will be added to the list later, pos
sibly including one with U.C.L.A.

RISING PRICES HAVE HIT foot
ball as well as the grocery store with
the announcement that tickets for
the Big Game at Berkeley will cost
the public a mere S5. This is a 14
per cent raise over the pre-war
price of $4.40. Figuring of course
that the tax has been doubled since
the last meeting of the two schools,
there will be little if any more
money to be gained by the two
schools in profits.
Five dollars is a lot of dough for a
football game, but if the customers
are willing to pay, more power to
them. What other football game in
the country costs as much? None,
to our knowledge.

THIS WEEKS SAN Francisco-
Oakland series in the Seals' Sta
dium is slated to decide the Pacific
Coast League race. The Oaks sus
tained a blow last week when it
was announced that Les Scarsella,
the League's most valuable player,
would be out of action for some
three weeks.
With this in mind, the Seals
should be able to take the series if
their hitting holds up. With Jan
sen and Melton going to the mound
twice and Rosso, Harrell, and Sew
ard once each, the Seals might very 1
easily come through the winner in ;
five of the tilts.
THE ONCE POWERFUL OAKS!
lose fully half of their hitting pow
er with Scarsella's loss, as he cur- ;
rently leads the league in hitting,
home runs, and runs batted in.
The Seals are as good as in should
they take the series.
To draw the 100.000 attendance
they have been dreaming about for
this series, they will have to aver
age about 15.000 fans per game. Last
time they drew 98.000 for the se
ries.
