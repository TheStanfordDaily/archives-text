# Excom Studies Booze Problem

### 
Encina Hall's request for an off
campus dance August 10 at Adobe
Creek Lodge will come before Ex-

com again to
night at 7:30,
A.S. S. U. Presi
dent Jack Wal
lace said yester
day.
Because liquor
may be served
on the premises,
the student gov
ernment group
tabled the re
quest last week
until policing

and other details could be discussed,

A 1 Forbes, chairman of the spon
sor-selection committee, will report.
Excom will decide whether or not
it should appoint an Encina presi
dent for 104(5-47.
This would be the first step in a
plan proposed by Shelton Beatty,
head councillor for men, to place
responsibility for the sponsor-selec
tion system at Encina under stu
dent government control.
The group will also discuss mak
ing their next meeting a combined
meeting-inspection tour of Dibble
Hospital, the new veterans' hous
ing area.
The meting tonight is open to any
student.
