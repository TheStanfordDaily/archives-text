### 
Dr. Henry H. Hart promised a
small Tuesday Series audience last
night that reading a few volumes of
Chinese poetry reveals more about
the people than a dozen volumes of
its history.
Speaking on the topic, "Chinese
Poetry and Its Meaning for Us," the
noted lecturer on the culture and
literature of China described the
veils that hang in the way and block
proper appreciation of the Oriental
poetry by Westerners.
He emphasized that Chinese po
etry is not rousing and patriotic, but
is rather sophisticated and contem
plative. The ex-San Francisco at
torney pointed out that the deepest
friendships between men and long
separations between loved ones ac
count for 50 pel - cent of Chinese
poetry.
Dr. Hart sprinkled his talk with
readings of Chinese poems, dwell
ing rather often on non-abstract
subjects in an effort to put over to
his audience his conviction that un
derneath the barrier of language
and behind the different - colored
skin lies a spirit and a man not un
like ourselves.—Boyd Haight
