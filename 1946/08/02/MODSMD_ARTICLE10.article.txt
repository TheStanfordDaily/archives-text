The joint British - American
committee on Palestine has pro
posed a partition of that troubled
land. A narrow, curved strip
running north from the Tel Aviv
area would be under Jewish lo
cal control, most of central Pales
tine would be turned over to local
Arabs, and a southern desert area
and an enclave around Jerusalem
and Bethlehem would remain un
der direct British administration.
President Truman has not said
that lie disaD-

but he ordered
the United States
delegation to re

ence for a special cabinet meeting,
and Winston Churchill, speaking in
the House of Commons, said that if
the Uuited States failed to co-op

problem. Britain should resign her

mandate and evacuate the Holy
Land.
President Truman has issued an
order to all department heads call
ing for strict economy in govern
ment expenditures. Both General
Eisenhower and Admiral Nimitz
have protested. Truman's order
was designed as an anti-inflation
move.
With our national fingers in half
a dozen potentially explosive pies
and our troops still spread all over
the globe, this is no time to inflict
rigid economy upon the Army and
N;tvy.
The bill quit-claiming tide
lands to the states, which was fi
nally pushed through Congress,
was vetoed today. President Tru
man, referring to the action pres
ently before the Supreme Court,
by which California seeks clear
title to her oil-rich shoreline, told
the Congress in his message that
if the lands were held to belong
to the Federal government, they
were too valuable to give away:
if they are the rightful property
of the states, there \va> no need
to give a quit-claim to them.

The lands, lying under water out
to the three-mile limit, have tradi
tionally been held to belong to the
several states. California derives
considerable income from leasing
these lands for oil production. The
Federal government was attracted
by the oil as a possible war re
serve. Naturally the states and the
oil companies are fighting all the
way, and it was their combined
strength that put the quit-claim
resolution through Congress.
Down in Tennessee, where Ken
neth MeKellar is running for his
sixth Senate term, backed by Boss
Crump and opposed by the PAC,
eleven persons were injured, gun
fire broke out in the streets, and
seven special deputies were seized
as hostages, as an armed crowd
of veterans surrounded the Mc-
Mitin county courthouse in Ath
ens. (Tennessee, that is.) The
besiegers represented a group of
veterans, bolting Democrats, and
Republicans opposing the local
Democratic organization, The
county sheriff is the machine can
didate for State Senator.
