EXCOM SNAFU
Dibble Coordinator Bob Collins asked Excom two weeks ago
to meet an August 1 deadline in investigating necessary con
stitutional changes and appointments connected with the open
ing of student government in the Dibble housing area fall
quarter.
By Wednesday night's meeting nothing had been done, and
Excom was forced to delegate complete authority for the in
vestigation and appointments to a special committee. While this
relieved the strain on the group as a whole, it was emergency
action to cover up procrastination.
Another recurrent snafu is in the method of appointments.
People are appointed to committee work they know nothing
about, and in several cases they are appointed first and in
formed later. This practice resulted in a hopeless tangle on
the Pre-Reg program for fall guarter. Excom had to sgueeze
out of it by asking an appointee of spring guarter's Excom to
resign as chairman since she wasn't on campus and hadn't
wanted the job in the first place.
The absence of the student manager this summer has been
•a wrench in the wheels. Excom is not able to function effici
ently as a substitute because it cannot possibly know the ins
and outs of the finances of each organization submitting re
quests.
Excom members themselves know very little about the
A.SSU constitution which they are called upon to interpret and
strengthen.
The upshot of all this is that Stanford's student government
as now organized is going to fail miserably in the job of ad
ministering a 7,000-man Stanford.
~ The blame lies primarily on the inefficient structure of Ex
com. The Daily in a series of editorials will suggest improve
ments which, if not perfect, may at least be springboards for
discussion.

STAN SHARP

The Daily takes this means of saying goodbye to Stan Sharp.
He's leaving the campus this week on the first lap of a year's
search for a new job. For more than 10 years as a German
teacher and as director of men's housing he has been a loyal
friend of Stanford men, a person they could look to for compe
tent advice with the knowledge that he understood Stanford
and its way of life. It's not for us to comment on the reasons
for his going, but it is for us to say he will be missed and
Godspeed.

Excom members themselves know very little about the
A.SSU constitution which they are called upon to interpret and
strengthen.
The upshot of all this is that Stanford's student government
as now organized is going to fail miserably in the job of ad
ministering a 7,000-man Stanford.

STAN SHARP

The Daily takes this means of saying goodbye to Stan Sharp.
He's leaving the campus this week on the first lap of a year's
search for a new job. For more than 10 years as a German
teacher and as director of men's housing he has been a loyal
friend of Stanford men, a person they could look to for compe
tent advice with the knowledge that he understood Stanford
and its way of life. It's not for us to comment on the reasons
for his going, but it is for us to say he will be missed and
Godspeed.
