### 
We heard this one on our regu
lar weekend tour of- the Sutter
County Good Food Society.
Up in Yuba City—that's in Sut
ter County—the city fathers met
a falling income problem by the
installation of parking meters.
Shortly after the appearance of the
vicious things one of the town's
better - known matrons and her
youngest daughter went on a
shopping tour.
The good lady pulled up in front
of a grocery store and saw that
10 minutes remained on the meter.
She dashed into the store and fin
ished her shopping in what for her
•vas record time, returning to the

car just as the
re d "Violation"
flag skipped into
place on the me
ter.
Hr daughter
was greatly im
pressed by ovi r
friend's sense of
timing.
When she got
home she rushed

up to her father.
"Oh, Dad," she said. "Mother
dmost got violated in town today."

Two gals in Lagunita have de
/eloped the greatest system of
.•ommunication since the inven
ion of the pay phone by Alexan
ier Graham Ameche.
One lives in the second story at
Jasa Mongolia, the other on the
irst floor. The other night the
lame on the second floor had news
>112 great import for her friend, so.
as usual, she leaned out of her
window and gave a shout. The

friend answered, the message was
delivered by lungpower and the
first gal tried to get back into her
room, only to discover that she
was stuck in the window and
couldn't get back in. For all we
know, she may still be there.

NEATEST TRICK OF THE
WEEK DEPARTMENT: A letter
from our reader suggests that we
"give the mice ether, and while
asleep pick them up."
* * *
The town of East Nicolaus is
really bu. zing this week. For your
information, East Nicolaus also is
in Sutter County.
One of the local belles is getting
married early next month, and she
and her lord and master-to-be
asked a friend of hers to hunt up
a honeymoon cottage for them in
one of the coast's resort towns.
The friend found a place and
wrote to the belle, giving a glow
ing description of the material ad
vantages the place offered to hon
eymooners in the way of accom
modations. The message was sent
on a penny postcard.
The only trouble was that the
belle hadn't told anyone yet that
she was planning to take the fatal
step. Now half of East Nicolaus
thinks she's going off to live in sin.
and the other half is sure of it.
