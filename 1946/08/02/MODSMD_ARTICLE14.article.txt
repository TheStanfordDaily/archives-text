### 
The three one-act plays "The Scheming Lie utenant," "Winter's End," and "Fumed Ook' —
presented Wednesday and Thursday evenings as experiments in center staging were sue-'
cessful.
The Nitery is not the best of places for such a production. But once you get used to look
ing over someone's shoulder it is easier to enjoy the play.
The fact that the audience was seated on all four sides of the actors gave a greater range o:

action to each play and was espe
cially successful in "The Scheming
Lieutenant."
The audience's first impression,
that of a rehearsal, was soon dis
pelled both by clever staging and
lighting. Of the three plays. "The
Scheming Lieutenant" was the
most successful.
TOP PERFORMANCES WERE
given by Rees Behrent as Doctor
Rosey in "The Scheming Lieu
tenant." Bob Ashley as the satyr

in "Winter's End," and Alley.
Fletcher as Henry and Jane Sauls
berry as Elsie in ''Fumed Oak.'
Others worthy of mention were
Audrey Miles and Marie Sellan. ;
in "Fumed Oak" and Pat Barren
in "Winter's End." Credit should
also go to Julio Francescutti wh
directed "The Scheming Lieuten
ant," Charles Ingram who directed
■ "Fumed Oak," and George Wilson,
the director of "Winter's End.''
The applause of the audience in
dicated that Stanford would wel
come and should receive more ex
periments of the same kind.—Car.
