Probably every literate person
has seen the above cabalistic let
ters in a newspaper column, but
not everyone understands how
they come to be there. The 90-
character linotype keyboard is so
arranged that these letters consti
tute the first two vertical rows, in
both the lower-case and capital
sections.
It often happens that the opera
tor, noticing that he has made an
error, finds it easier to fill out the
line with "pi" and start all over
again than to correct it in place.
In this case he is likely simply to
run a finger down the first two
rows of keys.
Once in a while such a line gets
into the paper. (Not. of course, in
the Stanford Daily.)

There was. for example, the wom

the topic "How to Achieve Immor

was both surprised and pleased at
the size of the audience which
packed the hall—until she learned
that a letter had dropped out of
the newspaper announcement of
her subject.
The compositor is faced not in
frequently with the question of
what to do about errors in the
copy. These may range from sim

matical blunders and stylistic sole
