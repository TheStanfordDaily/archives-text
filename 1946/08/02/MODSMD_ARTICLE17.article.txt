(Editor's Note: Alan B. Strain,
psychology major, and writer of
the letter below, is one o! several
Stanford men who are spending
the summer working as "cow
boys." These Roughs work on
cattle hoats and take part in ac
tual delivery of livestock to pov
erty-stricken areas of Europe. But
they drew horses instead of heif
ers.
The cattle are sent hy the "Heif
ers for Relief" organization, which
had an active chapter at Stanford
during spring quarter.)
Aboard S.S. Norwalk Victory ;
Baltimore, Maryland
July 25, 1946
Dear Editor:
It will ' probably come as some-1
what of a surprise to you that we
; re still in the States but that is
the sad truth. The railroad strike,
changes in the UNRRA set-up and
various other things have conspired
to hold us up.
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES have
resulted in one happy situation,
however, in that they have put a
croup of five Stanford men on this
one ship: Ray Squire, Alan Walker,
Bill Hagins, Steve Hyman, and my
self.
Bill Hagins, Steve Hyman, and I
arrived at the World Church Serv
ice Center in New Windsor, Mary
.aixl, on June 29, after an extremely
interesting trip across the continent
in Steve's car.
AMONG OTHER THINGS WE
got to the bottom of on our trip j
were the Grand Canyon and Carls- ]
bad Caverns. Later we spent s'ev- I
eral days wandering around Wash
ington. D.C. Were properly awed by
all the marble walls and by such
places of interest as the "world's
largest junk pile"—the Smithsonian
Institute.
Early in July, Ray Squire and
Alan Walker arrived a few days
apart via bus. Squire was ultimate
ly made one of the two foremen for
the trip and Alan Walker was in
eluded as part of the crew that the
rest of us were in.
LIFE AT THE NEW WINDSOR
Relief Center has been extremely
interesting the past three weeks. At
the center one sees the very inter
esting picture of World War II vet
erans and "Conchies," whose con
victions kept them from fighting and
sometimes sent them to prison,
sleeping side by side united in the
belief that immediate world-wide
relief and rehabilitation is essential
to future peace.
There are also, unfortunately,
those who are here because of their
desire for adventure and personal
gain in the black markts of foreign
ports where a few cigarettes will
work wonders for you.
Besides handling the "cowboys'"
and arrangements for heifer ship
ments, the Center processes about
45-50 thousand pounds of relief
goods each week that have been do
nated by people all over the coun
try. So far this year they have sent
overseas shipments of food and
clothing worth about five million

dollars.
Since we five men have been
here we have worked in several of
the departments of the center and
have gotten a fair idea of how parts
of the program work. Incidentally
the center is the old Blue Ridge
College—a former Church of the
Brethren college.
SINCE WE FIVE HAVE BEEN

three weeks' wait has been well
worth while as we have had a i
chance to get a close look at many ,
of the people and customs of this j
area. The Jim Crowism "of some
areas of these parts has been a real
eye-opener to me at least.
So far as I've been able to find 1
out, three or four Stanford men
went out from one of the shipping j
centers last month. Haven't b?en ;
able to find out their names, but
hope we can contact them when !
we get back this fall.
OUR GROUP BOARDED THE
Norwalk Tuesday. Yesterday we I
loaded hay and we're supposed to j
take aboard our load of Horses (yes,
horses, not heifers) this afternoon :
or tonight.
As our orders stand now we're j
supposed to clear port (Chesapeake |
Bay) sometime tomorrow after
noon. As our last short leave is up
at four today, I thought I'd better
get this tetter off.
■ As far as we know now, we'll
make port in Bremen or on through
the Keil (canal) to Danzig. If we
get to Danzig we'll be able to fly to
Warsaw for a couple of days as far
as we know now.
WE HAVE FOOD PARCELS
which we are to distribute ourselves i
and it should be a real experience
to make the contacts for this job. j
Also have a few personal letters

to people in Warsaw which I'm sup
posed to deliver that makes for |
more interesting valuable contacts.
As for writing, as things stand '
now we'll be able to send letters j
from the English Channel and from
the port we put in at and I'll do j
my darnedest to get letters off at i
both places to bring you up to date i
on our travels.
ALL FOR NOW AS I HAVE TO
get back to the ship in abovit an
hour. Hope Stanford still remains I
in all its (fill in depending upon j
your editorial mood).
Sincerely,
Alan B. Strain
P.S.—Norwalk Victory is fastest !
ship i n our fleet; made last trip over j
and back in 29 days: so we should

be back stateside in about a month
Our load of horses will be some
thing in the neighborhood of 700 o>
800.
