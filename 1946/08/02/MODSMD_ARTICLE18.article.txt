# Broken Bones No Block To 1902 Football Team
## 
### GERRY HILL 
When Stanford meets Michigan I
during the 1947 football season, it
will be the second game in an In
dian-Wolverine series that began in
2902.
In that mighty tussle the Farm
braves met the Michigan eleven in
the 1902 Rose Bowl game where the
Wolverines triumphed by a score of
49-0. But reports the Daily Palo
Alto (forerunner to the Stanford
Daily): "The many redeeming fea
tures of the losing game played by
the Stanford representatives are not J
there chronicled."
THE DAILY PALO ALTO re
cords that the Stanford eleven got
off to a fast start and that Michigan
was rather surprised in the first j
quarter of the game. The Michigan |
team fully realized the gravity of j
their situation when their quarter
back "began to incite his men with
cries of "Dig in there, we haven't a
snap!'"
Meanwhile. Michigan Coach "Hur
ry-up" Yost "frantically paced the
sidelines, overcome with nervous
desperation, so unexpected was the j
indication of a Stanford score. He i
broke several canes in his excite- |
:nent, and once attempted to offi- i
date as line-man.
"WHEN HE GRABBED THE rod
from Phil Wilson's hand, however,
with the explanation 'Put 'this
here,' he received a cuff in the back
of the neck from Phil's strong right
arm that put s check to his enthu
siasm." It is hoped that such inci- j
dents will not occur at the next
Indian-Wolverine game.
According to the Daily Palo Alto, I
Stanford lost because they were un-
able to keep their starting eleven on
:he field for the entire seventy min
utes as did Michigan. Stanford had
six men taken out for injuries.
ONE OF THESE INJURED MEN.
a guard named Roosevelt, received ,
injuries that were partly flue to lack j
of condition. "Roosevelt, at guard,
received a kick on the shin that
shattered the large bone. He told
Captain Fisher that something was
broken, but the captain said, 'Stay
with it.' and he answered, 'All
right.'
"He stayed for ten minutes more
while the Michigan line continually
forced him for short gains. His left
"eg was useless, but he could hop
to his position.
"BUT WHEN. IN A DUSKY

scrimmage, Roosevelt received a
kick in the side knocking his wind
and fracturing a rib, he hopped on
his uninjured leg to the side-lines
for a man to take his place." Lack
of conditioning, no doubt.
On page three of the paper (the
front page had nothing but the foot
ball game) it is discovered that
playing for Michigan was one of
the greatest left - halfbacks of all
time, Tom Heston. The Daily Palo
Alto in order to save a little time
had quoted all play-by-play • details
of the game from the San Francisco
Chronicle. This quotation covered
some three and a half columns of
material.
ATTENDING THAT ROSE BOWL
game were 7.000 eager fans. We
cannot give the first names of the
players because the Daily Palo Alto
didn't believe that ihey were im
portant enough to print. An edito
rial of that issue states that "Stan
ford must extend her field of rival
ry."
A news item in that paper of
January 6. 1902, reports that regis
tration had risen to a new record
of 409 persons.
