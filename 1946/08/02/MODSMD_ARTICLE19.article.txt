# YANKEES BEAT TIGERS
## 
### 
The New York Yankees regained |
second place in the American I
League yesterday with a four-to- j
two win over the Detroit Tigers. The ;
Bronx Bombers exploded some of j
their old-time power as Tommy
Henrich connected for two homers I
and Bill Johnson hit one to supply
the help needed to give rookie Ran
dy Gumpert his sixth win against
one loss.
The Chicago White Sox came from
behind to defeat Philadelphia seven
to six. Pete Sutler's grand slam ho
mer for the A's was wasted.
