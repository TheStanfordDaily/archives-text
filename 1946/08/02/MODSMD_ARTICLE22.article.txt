With football practice on the Farm
but a month away, everyone seems
to be wondering wha4 kind of an
outfit Stanford will have in the fall.
Everyone we've, talked to has given
vut with pessimistic replies when
asked about our prospects.
WE STAND NOW AS WE STOOD
at this time in 1940. We have pos
sibilities, but we do not anticipate
an outstanding squad, though we
could surprise. That is the way it
.ooked in pre-season then; that is
the way it looks now. For those who
don't recall, we ended up the 40
season in the Rose Bowl.
Our line looks as if it could hold
up against any line on the coast.
Our first backfield looks all right at
the moment. Our strength appears
to be only one deep. However, there
are numerous service players and
high school players who will be
around that we do not know of as
yet. They may surprise.
AT ENDS, COACH MARCIIIE
Schwartz can start Bob Hall, who
made second-string All - American
for the University of Colorado dur
ing the war and is a Stanford let—
terman. and Bob Rohrer. who played
frosh ball here in 1942 and varsity
ball for U.C.L.A. in 1943.
At tackle, the starters look like
Fred Boensch and Jim Cox. both of

whom are Stanford lettermen and
both played first string for Califor
nia during the war.
GUARD POSITION WILL BE
strong also with Bill Hechtcn and
Dick Madigan returning from the
'42 frosh team and Harvey Bern
hard, a 1942 letterman. Hachten and
Madigan played for Cal in 1943 and
1f,44 with Hachten receiving several
All-American nominations.
Pete August, another i942 letter
man. returns to the big red machine
at center.
AT QUARTERBACK. TIIE In
dians will have Bill Gulley, who
starred in the 1943 spring practice

and was scheduled to be first string
that fall, beating out Ted Kenfield,
and Ainslee Bell who played for
Southern California a few years
back.
Slated for halfbacks this year are
Lloyd Merriman from the '42 frosh
team, and Don Zappettini and Fred
Sanderman, lettcrmen from 1942.
Zappettini scored two touchdowns
in the last Big Game.
IF BUCK FAWCETT COMES out
for football in the fall, the fullback

post will be secure. Fawcett is ex
pected back on campus, but, at last
report, the 1941 and 1942 star does
not intend to play ball. Otherwise
it will be either Gene Martin or
Martin Anderson at full when the
season opens.
That is what the first team looks
like so far. If they can hold up. the
team may pull a few surprises dur
ing the season, but one or two key
injuries could throw the entire team
off balance.
HELP IS EXPECTED FROM THE
incoming freshmen and veterans in
the fall, and, if they have any tal
ents, Marchie Schwartz is certainly
the one to find it. So far as we are
concerned, Schwartz is the best
coach on the coast, bar none.
We find that another game has
gone up to the previously unheard
of price of $5. The Southern Cali
fornia-U.C.L.A. game joins the Big
Game in that price range.
The Stanford game down south on
October 12 will be the homecoming
game for the Bruins and will cost
the public but $3. On the Bruins'
price scale, we noticed that Santa
Clara rates on a par with Montana.
That certainly is a new low for the
Broncos.
