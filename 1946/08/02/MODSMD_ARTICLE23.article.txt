## Forfeitures Tangle Mural Play; League Standings Are Juggled 
### 
Mural softball League I took a |
decided turn for the worse as the i
Legal Eagles were awarded the best |
end of their disputed game with [
Delta Upsilon, which knocked the I
D.U.'s out of the l°ad and put the
Eagles out in front.
Phi Delta Kappa I banged out a
5-2 victory over the Sigma Nu's in i
a League I encounter which put the
P.D.K.'s into undisputed third place.
WITH THE SCORE TIED AT
two all going into the bottom half
of the fifth frame, the educators I
pounded out three runs for the
margin of victory.
Battery for the winners consisted |
of Brown, pitcher, and Elton, catch- j
er. Shortstop Mosone of P.D.K. led
the game's hitting.
Hurler Charlie Grandi of Encina j
IE weathered a last-inning rally as
the "hard luck" Encinans edged the
Phi Delta Kappa H's, 6-5.
SPARKING THE WINNERS AT
the plate was the "Encina Clipper,"
third - sacker Jack Donovan, who
banged two round-trippers. Short
stop Mike Schulman also garnered j
a home run for lE. Encina pulled i
the trickiest play of the afternoon
as Malcolm Tedford and Dana
Johnson manipulated a double steal
to pick up one of their tallies.
P.D.K. took a lead in the first ;
inning, scoring twice. In the sev
enth. trailing 6-2, the losers staged
a three-run splurge," but were held
down by Grandi. Handling Char
lie's slants was Pete Willett.
Hurling for the defeated nine was
Frank Gillette.
IN LEAGUE I DELTA UPSILON
will have to forfeit all games in
which they used Dick Flat land, var
sity player. It is also possible that
Chi Psi may have to forfeit en
counters in which Dick West, un
registered player, was used. SONA
already has won a game in this j
manner; West was also used against
Encina lE.
Mural Secretary Elwyn Bugge
faces a tough job of untangling the
results, and scheduling replays of
games in order to decide what teams
are to participate in the play-offs.

which they used Dick Flat land, var
sity player. It is also possible that

manner; West was also used against
Encina lE.

faces a tough job of untangling the
results, and scheduling replays of
games in order to decide what teams
are to participate in the play-offs.
