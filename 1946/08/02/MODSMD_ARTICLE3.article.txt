Never underestimate the power
of a woman or outdoor advertis
ing!
This law was proved for the
umpteenth time yesterday when
the four-month bride of a young
veteran entering Law School this
fall faced eviction with complete
aplomb.
Told she and her husband would
have to move, the young bride
stuck a placard on the back of
her car reading, "Desperately in
need of a place to live."
Response was nothing short of
immediate. Soon after she had
parked her car on University
Avenue in Paly, two prospective
landlords stopped her and offered
her their help.
