# Gaieties Plans Aim For ‘Real Good Ole Days’
## 
### CARL HEINTZE 
Plans for the first post-war Big
Game Gaieties this fall bring back
memories of the "good old days"
before Uncle Sam called so many
roughs from Stanford.
The extravaganzas of the past call
to mind a whole host of Stanford
comics, songwriters and producers.
Perhaps the most famous of all was
"Doodles" Weaver, now of New
York night club fame, who did not
confine his theatrics to the stage

alone.
"DOODLES" IS ALLEGED TO
have built a car with a piano
welded to the back. He would drive
down Lasuen Street giving a sol
emn rendition of some popular song
of the day while the crowds
cheered.
Later additions to the Ram's Head
Hall of Fame have included Harry
Muheim, late of Hollywood; Charlie
Bullotti, the present program direc
tor for the Mutual Broadcasting
System; Sylvia Berry, late of the
U.S. Navy and once more returned
to Stanford. Jacquey Poly Ogg, now
of the Stanford Chemistry Depart
ment, and Shorty Grannis, the man
who was Roosevelt.
MEMORIES OF SONGS THAT
have filled Gaieties with music in
clude "The Top of the Libe," "Stan
ford in Spring," "Men Are Mean,"
"The Moon Is Up, the Top Is Down,"
and many others.
The Big Game Gaieties has al
ways been an all-student show. All
of the skits, such as Bob O'Neil's
famous drama "You Can Do It,
Frankie," have been student writ
ten. The sets, dances, music and
costuming have always made u suc
cessful production.

The Big Game Gaieties will be

Arnold and Lorna Robertson have
issued an early call for material of
