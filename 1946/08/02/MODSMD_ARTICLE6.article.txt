# Arsonist Sets Big Brush Fire
## 
### 
The arsonist went into action
again when a fierce "set" fire broke j
out over 75 acres of pasture land i
along Page Mill Road near the old !
army camp, Fire Chief John Mar
ston reported.
When the fire whistle sounded
five blasts — help needed at fire —
the Farm Firehouse boys rushed to j
the scene with two trucks.
Some 30 Stanford students also j
reported to the scene of the blaze in \
answer to the call for assistance and
helped the firemen bring it under
control.
At its height, the fire was burning
over a one-mile front with four fire
trucks in the battle. After an hour
the fire was brought under control,
but the Farm, firemen stayed until
8 p.m., putting out the blaze.
Although the fire department is
not disclosing the method used to
start the pastures burning, Chief
Marston reported he had found cer
tain articles at the seen? which defi
nitely proved the blaze was not ac
cidental.
Over the Fourth several other
brush fires broke out in the vicinity
of the campus and the new out
break is believed to be the work of
the same arsonist.
