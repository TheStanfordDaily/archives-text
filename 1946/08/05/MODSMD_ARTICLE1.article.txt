With the adjournment of Con
gress, President Truman has
dropped down to Independence,
Mo., for a few days' rest and to
vote in tomorrow's primary elec
tion. lie intends only to vote in
the primary, not to interfere any
further in the Slaughter - Axtell
race. Important hills still await
ing the President's signature in
Washington include the G.I. ter
minal leave measure, the act
freezing social security taxes
again, and a railroad reorganiza
tion hill. The Congress adjourned
without acting on the long-range
housing program Truman asked
for, and without passing the
Army-Navy merger.

Sen. George, chairman of the Sen-

ate Finance
Committee, has
endorsed the
President's call
for government
economy. The
Senator said that
high tax rates
would have to
be continued. He,
too, suggested
cutting down on

military expenditures as an econ
omy and anti-inflationary measure.

With so much demand for econ
omy in defense spending, why didn't
Congress pass the Army-Navy mer
ger bill? That would have both
cut down the cost and increased the
efficiency of the services. So far, at
the end of every war, we have de
cided to skimp on the services and,
consequently, have been totally un
prepared for every next war. There
is a possibility of another war some
clay, is there not? Who thinks that
atomic or rocket warfare will give
us time to train men and produce
their equipment after the war has
started? My conclusion is that if
you don't have armed forces capable
of fighting a first-class war, you
might as well not have any!
With the President's three-man
"decontrol" hoard still studying
the situation, the OPA continues
to announce price increases. r lhe
OPA officials insist that these in
creases are not only allowed but
forced under the terms of the
compromise price-control bill.
A Nanking rumor has it that
President Truman has ordered Gen.
Marshall to prepare plans for the
withdrawal of American forces from
China. There is no official comment.
The "revolution" in Athens,
Tenn., seems to have gained its
point. The citizens' committee, in
the absence of all official peace
officers, has restrained its "parti
sans," but has organized patrols
and road blocks to guard against
any possible counter - revolution.
Their candidates will be declared
elected as soon as they find the
official election commission.
