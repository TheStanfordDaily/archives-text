Next Saturday night the fierce
Farm firemen are throwing open the
doors of the Women's Gym for an
all-campus, informal "Sport - Shirt
Jamboree." Bids are still on sale at
the A.S.S.U. office for $2.40 a couple
and all money raised will be used
to buy new uniforms for the student
firemen.
The dance will feature the music
of Art Weidner's orchestra. Deco
rations theme will be along the line
of a firehouse. Fire.plugs have been
secured for the occasion and even
an appropriately placed dog may be
added for atmosphere.
Free dinners at Longbarn, Rick
ey's, and Dinah's Shack and several
pairs of nylon hose will be given
away as door prizes.
A snack bar and punch bowl will
also be present in the gym for those
who need refreshment.
