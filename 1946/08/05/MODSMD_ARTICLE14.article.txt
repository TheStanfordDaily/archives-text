# Proof Found Brush Fires By Arsonist
## 
### BILL RULE 
The arsonist who is though:
responsible for numerous brush
fires throughout this area, struck
again yesterday afternoon tc
bring the believed number of
"set" fires to 14. Shortly after 2
p.m., the Farm fire boys re
ceived a call to rush to the
scene of another brush fire on
Fremont Road in the Los Altos
area.
This blaze was only of minor pro
portions, burning some two acres of
dry brush along the road, but Fire
Chief John Marston discovered evi
dence which proved that the fire
was not an accident.
THE FIRST FIRES OF "unknown
origin" to break out in the campus
area were the series which occurred
during the Fourth of July vacation.
On the Fourth alone six separate"
fires, none of which were considered
accidental, broke out along the Por
tola Road area and the Stanford
firemen were rushing from blaze to
blaze wondering where to go next.
The day before this outburst a
small fire was put out by the Farm
boys along the golf course, and
there too evidence was found of the
arsonist's work.
Three days later the firemen were
called into action again to fight the
fire fiend's work along Frenchman's
Road where another brush blaze
was consuming several acres.
THE ARSONIST WAS NOT lim
iting his work to only the Stanford
area, for shortly after this a series
of six fires were reported in the
Redwood" City area and there toe
the fire departments, reported find
ing certain apparatus used by ar
sonists to start fires.
Last week the fire bug returned
I to the Farm with vengeance in his
! mind, having neglected to set any
j fires in this area for over a week
' The result of this lay-off may have
been the 75-acre blaze last Wednes
! day which needed the best efforts
of three fire departments and as
sistance from Corp Yard and Farm
students to get it under control. This
| blaze rates as one of the arsonist's
| worst,-for at its height the fire was
j burning on a one-mile front and the
I Farm firemen had to remain on the
I scene for over four hours putting
I out the burning brush.
FIRE CHIEF MARSTON DOES
not want to disclose the means used:
to start the various fires, but he has
reported that fire-setting equip
| ment was found at the scene oi
j many of the blazes and that this
I evidence is being used in every
| possible way to discover the iden
; tity of the arsonist.
