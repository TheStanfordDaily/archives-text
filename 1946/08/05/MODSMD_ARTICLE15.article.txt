### 
The Daily proposes Stanford's student body president take
the simple step of establishing a permanent sub-committee
system for Excom.
Under this arrangement certain members of Excom are desig
nated at the beginning of the year to places on various stand
ing committees, perhaps three members per committee. Those
delegated would be expected to familiarize themselves with the
particular committee's job and to become experts at handling
legislation connected with that committee's job.
To be specific, there should be as a minimum the following
committees: Appointments; Constitution and By-Laws; Social
Program; Dibble; Student Finance; Athletics.
Under the current system, if Stanford needs a Pre-Reg chair
man, the ASSU President springs the problem on an Excom
that hasn't thought about the matter at all. "Who knows some
one for the job?"
After much hemming and hawing, someone comes up with
a name and assures the group that "X is a real fine person and
likes activities!" X is forthwith the lucky man.
Under a sub-committee system, a group of three members
of Excom, with ASSU president ex-officio, would be appointed
at the first meeting of fall quarter to handle all appointments
for the coming year.
This sub-committee would be provided with a list of the
jobs that Excom must fill. It would proceed to study the matter,
draw up lists of candidates, interview those interested, and
nominate a slate of three or four persons fitted for the job.
When Excom met, the chairman of Appointments sub-com
mittee could report, "We have investigated X, Y. Z. and 2\; for
the job of Pre-Reg Chairman. X might be best, but he has too
much else to do. We recommend Z, but leave the choice from
those we've nominated up to you."
If the matter were handled that way Excom could be fairly
sure of getting a decent Pre-Reg chairman.
If a standing sub-committee system such as used by the
Stanford Board of Trustees were established, Excom efficiency
could be upped 50 per cent.
Pleas for action received by the ASSU President could be
referred to the propel committee for investigation before Excom
met. Excom would have to meet perhaps half as many times
to get twice as much done. The sub-committees could meet
once a week and could be on call for emergency action.
The idea of division of labor helped Egyptian farmers out
several thousand years before Christ, and the lesson might
well be considered by Stanford's student government as having
lived long enough to merit a trial.

student government. Send us your suggestions.)
