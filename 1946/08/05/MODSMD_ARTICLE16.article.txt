### 
During the summer quarter
course in Political Science 160
(Martin, TWThF, 10) we've been
learning some of the fundamental
things about political machines,
bosses and parties, and the course
has given us a few ideas.
There are going to be about 2.700

Stanford stu
dents domiciled
in what used
to be Dibble
Hospital this
fall, plus the
wives of 300 of
them.
Dibble is in
San Mateo
County and is
within the city

limits of Menlo Park.
Almost all of the residents will
be over the age of 21 years.
The great majority will be bona
fide California residents.
After three months in Dibble
ihey will be eligible to vote as
citizens of Menlo Park.
(See what we're driving at°)
There are at present about 2,400
registered voters in Menlo Park,
some 50 to (50 per cent of whom
urn out for city elections.
Our idea is that some Poli Sei
najor could go over there and put
ii the next three months building
j|j a machine. Th;tt would be one
jiuoe where ward bosses would
••ally be ward bosses.
At the end of the three months
he machine gets all the voters

down to the Menlo Park City Hall
and gets them to register.
The machine then circulates re
call petitions and recalls Mayor
Charles P. Burgess.
(This is not meant as an indict
ment of Mayor Burgess. We un
derstand he's a fine fellow.)
The way is clear for the ma
chine to put their own man in as
mayor.
Over 2,000 organized voters
would carry a lot of weight in
Menlo Park.
There's a slight catch. The ma
yor of Menlo Park doesn't get any
salary. That could be remedied
during the recall election, how
ever, by a special proposition on
the ballot, giving the major a sal
ary of $150 monthly.
It's a nice way to add to your
$65.
We'll bet that Drs. Barclay or
Martin would give you five units
of good, solid "A" if you could pull
the deal.
The whole idea is just a sugges
tion, that's all.
CAMPAIGN FOR THE QUAR
TER: We went over to Dibble to
take a look-see over the weekend,
and were agreeably surprised at
what we saw. If that's going to
be living in barracks it's a better
set of barracks than any we ever
lived in before we shipped. Some
of the prime gripers ought to take
a look for themselves. It'll only
take an hour of your time, and it's
well worth it.

At the end of the three months
he machine gets all the voters

down to the Menlo Park City Hall
and gets them to register.
The machine then circulates re
call petitions and recalls Mayor
Charles P. Burgess.
(This is not meant as an indict
ment of Mayor Burgess. We un
derstand he's a fine fellow.)
The way is clear for the ma
chine to put their own man in as
mayor.
Over 2,000 organized voters
would carry a lot of weight in
Menlo Park.
There's a slight catch. The ma
yor of Menlo Park doesn't get any
salary. That could be remedied
during the recall election, how
ever, by a special proposition on
the ballot, giving the major a sal
ary of $150 monthly.
It's a nice way to add to your
$65.
We'll bet that Drs. Barclay or
Martin would give you five units
of good, solid "A" if you could pull
the deal.
The whole idea is just a sugges
tion, that's all.
CAMPAIGN FOR THE QUAR
TER: We went over to Dibble to
take a look-see over the weekend,
and were agreeably surprised at
what we saw. If that's going to
be living in barracks it's a better
set of barracks than any we ever
lived in before we shipped. Some
of the prime gripers ought to take
a look for themselves. It'll only
take an hour of your time, and it's
well worth it.

During the summer quarter
course in Political Science 160
(Martin, TWThF, 10) we've been
learning some of the fundamental
things about political machines,
bosses and parties, and the course
has given us a few ideas.
There are going to be about 2.700

Stanford stu
dents domiciled
in what used
to be Dibble
Hospital this
fall, plus the
wives of 300 of
them.
Dibble is in
San Mateo
County and is
within the city

limits of Menlo Park.
Almost all of the residents will
be over the age of 21 years.
The great majority will be bona
fide California residents.
After three months in Dibble
ihey will be eligible to vote as
citizens of Menlo Park.
(See what we're driving at°)
There are at present about 2,400
registered voters in Menlo Park,
some 50 to (50 per cent of whom
urn out for city elections.
Our idea is that some Poli Sei
najor could go over there and put
ii the next three months building
j|j a machine. Th;tt would be one
jiuoe where ward bosses would
••ally be ward bosses.
