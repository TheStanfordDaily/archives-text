The Editor, Sir:
This letter is for the purpose of
marking public the many cases of
lost, strayed or stolen bicycles
from the Lagunita bicycle racks.
During the last week alone at
least eight have been missed.
Some people say with unbelief in
their voices, "You mean bor
rowed?" Borrowed nothing! They
have been just plain stolen.
It is true that many times girls
will take someone's bicycle (sans
permission) to dash to a class or
go to the P. 0., but these are re
turned visually by the next hour.
It's the bicycles that aren't re
turned for several days, or not at
all, that we're concerned with
here.
The University police give very
police-like answers of "Sorry, no
trace of it," to repeated tearful
queries about the stolen bicycles.
It is about time some action is
taken. We suggest the installa
tion of one or two bright lights
near the racks to discourage night
theft, should that be found to be
the case. We also send out a plea
for the return of any bicycles that
may have been merely borrowed
at first and then forgotten some
where. We need the bikes, too.

The Editor, Sir:
I have been noticing a lot of dis
cussion in the Daily and about the
campus which comes under the
general heading of "How is the
veteran being treated?" This has
brought some questions to my
mind which perhaps you can an
swer. If you do not have the in
formation available, perhaps you
.will feel my questions are of gen
eral enough interest to warrant
your obtaining it from the Univer
sity.
FIRST. IN CONNECTION WITH
the Bookstore accounts. Does the
store make allowances on the ac
counts for the rebate which ap
plies to cash purchases? We do
not receive any rebates ourselves
and I wonder what becomes of
this money. To some of us it is a
sizable amount (especially in view
of the new tuition increase) and
certainly the sum total paid by
the Veterans' Administration for
all of us (if no rebate is allowed on
our accounts) must be very large.
I have heard of certain state
universities charging the Veter
ans' Administration full tuition
fees for residents of that State en
titled to reduced fees, and this
practice as well as failure to make
rebates, if actually occurring, cer
tainly cannot be considered as
honest.
Secondly, in connection with the
Branner argument. If the number
of girls dictates the use of Bran
ner for them as the only practical
solution for their housing problem,
the argument boils down to how
many girls should be accepted.
Apparently the only argument for
the large number of girls is to
maintain a balanced ratio of alum
ni.
I would like to see some figures
on how many A.B. degrees have
been given to men and to women
since (but not including) the 1942
graduation. I suspect and have
heard that, even with all the ex
tra veterans attending during the
next few years, the total ratio of
alumni would not be changed even
if no extra girls are allowed now.
FINALLY. I WOULD LIKE TO
see figures on how many nqn-vet
erans (both sexes) are included in
the new incoming class due next
quarter, as well as figures as to
what percentage of the qualified
applicants who were not admitted
were veterans. I have one friend,
and have heard of a number of
others, who have been admitted
to various schools for September,
1947, which means these veterans
must wait another year. I do not
know if Stanford has done this at
all, but would like to know. In
the case of veterans I can see no
possible excuse for it. as long a.s
any non-veterans are being ad
mitted at all.
Take my friend .is m example:

he has waited three years (in the
Navy) and now is told he must
wait another year to get to school.
Why should not some non-vet
eran wait only one year, rather
than force him to wait another
year? Is there any possible excuse
for this? And by non-veterans I
do include women.

all of us (if no rebate is allowed on
our accounts) must be very large.
I have heard of certain state
universities charging the Veter
ans' Administration full tuition
fees for residents of that State en
titled to reduced fees, and this
practice as well as failure to make
rebates, if actually occurring, cer
tainly cannot be considered as
honest.
Secondly, in connection with the
Branner argument. If the number
of girls dictates the use of Bran
ner for them as the only practical
solution for their housing problem,
the argument boils down to how
many girls should be accepted.
Apparently the only argument for
the large number of girls is to
maintain a balanced ratio of alum
ni.
I would like to see some figures
on how many A.B. degrees have
been given to men and to women
since (but not including) the 1942
graduation. I suspect and have
heard that, even with all the ex
tra veterans attending during the
next few years, the total ratio of
alumni would not be changed even
if no extra girls are allowed now.
FINALLY. I WOULD LIKE TO
see figures on how many nqn-vet
erans (both sexes) are included in
the new incoming class due next
quarter, as well as figures as to
what percentage of the qualified
applicants who were not admitted
were veterans. I have one friend,
and have heard of a number of
others, who have been admitted
to various schools for September,
1947, which means these veterans
must wait another year. I do not
know if Stanford has done this at
all, but would like to know. In
the case of veterans I can see no
possible excuse for it. as long a.s
any non-veterans are being ad
mitted at all.
Take my friend .is m example:

he has waited three years (in the
Navy) and now is told he must
wait another year to get to school.
Why should not some non-vet
eran wait only one year, rather
than force him to wait another
year? Is there any possible excuse
for this? And by non-veterans I
do include women.

The Editor, Sir:
This letter is for the purpose of
marking public the many cases of
lost, strayed or stolen bicycles
from the Lagunita bicycle racks.
During the last week alone at
least eight have been missed.
Some people say with unbelief in
their voices, "You mean bor
rowed?" Borrowed nothing! They
have been just plain stolen.
It is true that many times girls
will take someone's bicycle (sans
permission) to dash to a class or
go to the P. 0., but these are re
turned visually by the next hour.
It's the bicycles that aren't re
turned for several days, or not at
all, that we're concerned with
here.
The University police give very
police-like answers of "Sorry, no
trace of it," to repeated tearful
queries about the stolen bicycles.
It is about time some action is
taken. We suggest the installa
tion of one or two bright lights
near the racks to discourage night
theft, should that be found to be
the case. We also send out a plea
for the return of any bicycles that
may have been merely borrowed
at first and then forgotten some
where. We need the bikes, too.

I have been noticing a lot of dis
cussion in the Daily and about the
campus which comes under the
general heading of "How is the
veteran being treated?" This has
brought some questions to my
mind which perhaps you can an
swer. If you do not have the in
formation available, perhaps you
.will feel my questions are of gen
eral enough interest to warrant
your obtaining it from the Univer
sity.
FIRST. IN CONNECTION WITH
the Bookstore accounts. Does the
store make allowances on the ac
counts for the rebate which ap
plies to cash purchases? We do
not receive any rebates ourselves
and I wonder what becomes of
this money. To some of us it is a
sizable amount (especially in view
of the new tuition increase) and
certainly the sum total paid by
the Veterans' Administration for
all of us (if no rebate is allowed on
our accounts) must be very large.
I have heard of certain state
