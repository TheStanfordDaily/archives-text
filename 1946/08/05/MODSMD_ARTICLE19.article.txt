### SMILEY FARKAS 
This is kind of early in the season
(what with 54 days to go until Idaho
puts in its appearance at the Sta
dium) but I figure it's never too
early to start beating the drum, the
Menlo Park '49ers and Santa Rosa's
Rockets having already launched
this grid season somewhat auspi
ciously.
It's beginning to look like any
body who knows, or even acts or
sounds like thoy know, anything
about football at Stanford figures
that at this stage of the game we
have two games listod in black ink
on the ledger, one (The Big One)
up in the air, and the remainder
being somewhat doubtful, only
more so.
On the other hand, those who
don't know anything about football
—I have their own word for that—
maintain rather belligerently that it
will be the Rose Bowl at least for
the Cards this year. I dunno, may
be they think we'll play in the Su
gar Bowl too comes January One.
My sentiments are riding with the
former group. Idaho, strictly a dark
horse from this angle, and Santa
Clara look like a pair of shooins.
Cal should be another one, although
it's not a good idea to predict it now.
I'll worry that one some more in
Novmber.
As for the rest, U.S.F. (loaded),
U.C.L.A. (loaded), U.S.C. (loaded
and how), O.S.C. (loaded), Wash
ington (loaded) and Washington
State (ioadod), it'll be mostly a case
of salvaging what we can. Which
won't bo much, considering that we
shall go into the aforementioned
contests- with little more than the
proverbial prayer.
One other thing: when U.S.F.
beats us this year—okay, IF U.S.F.
beats us—it'll be their first victory
at our expense, the record now
leading 6-0-0 in the Farm's favor.
Rather than saying that we are
now in the same status we were in
1940, it seems that 1942 would be
closer to the truth, a season that
started off slowly for the Indians
but which picked up tremendously
toward the end. If that happens, my
prognosticating will give me some
sleepless nights.
At least, I hope it does.

On the other hand, those who
don't know anything about football
—I have their own word for that—
maintain rather belligerently that it
will be the Rose Bowl at least for
the Cards this year. I dunno, may
be they think we'll play in the Su
gar Bowl too comes January One.
My sentiments are riding with the
former group. Idaho, strictly a dark
horse from this angle, and Santa
Clara look like a pair of shooins.
Cal should be another one, although
it's not a good idea to predict it now.
I'll worry that one some more in
Novmber.
As for the rest, U.S.F. (loaded),
U.C.L.A. (loaded), U.S.C. (loaded
and how), O.S.C. (loaded), Wash
ington (loaded) and Washington
State (ioadod), it'll be mostly a case
of salvaging what we can. Which
won't bo much, considering that we
shall go into the aforementioned
contests- with little more than the
proverbial prayer.
One other thing: when U.S.F.
beats us this year—okay, IF U.S.F.
beats us—it'll be their first victory
at our expense, the record now
leading 6-0-0 in the Farm's favor.
Rather than saying that we are
now in the same status we were in
1940, it seems that 1942 would be
closer to the truth, a season that
started off slowly for the Indians
but which picked up tremendously
toward the end. If that happens, my
prognosticating will give me some
sleepless nights.
At least, I hope it does.
This is kind of early in the season
(what with 54 days to go until Idaho
puts in its appearance at the Sta
dium) but I figure it's never too
early to start beating the drum, the
Menlo Park '49ers and Santa Rosa's
Rockets having already launched
this grid season somewhat auspi
ciously.
It's beginning to look like any
body who knows, or even acts or
sounds like thoy know, anything
about football at Stanford figures
that at this stage of the game we
have two games listod in black ink
on the ledger, one (The Big One)
up in the air, and the remainder
being somewhat doubtful, only
more so.
