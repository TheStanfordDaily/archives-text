up to $200,000 by the Rockefeller
Foundation for a live-year program

and 25 junior fellowships over the I
period from July 1, 194(5, to June 30, j

petence in this field, while the jun- j
ior fellowships will go to younger j

''The problem of understanding j
the Slavic peoples, and particularly j
the Russians, is very great," said j
Dr. Harold H. Fisher, director of
the library and himself an author- \
ity on Russia. "Furthermore, the j
number of competent people in this
field is very small.
* "CONSEQUENTLY, OUR pro- !

creasing our knowledge of these j
peoples and of developing more j
Americans with special competence
