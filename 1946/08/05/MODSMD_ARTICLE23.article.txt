# Lil' Injun, Audience Enjoy Margery Bailey in Comedy
## 
### 
Last Friday night, for the Annual Assembly of Stanford's Dramatists' Alliance, the Hillbarn
Summer Theater presented a special performance of William Congreve's "Way of the World"
at the Palo Alto Community Center.
That is a restrained opening paragraph, but there was nothing restrained about my enjoy
ment or the enjoyment of the whole audience. There was none of your "determined-in-the-

name-of-culture" atmosphere. The"*
lines may have been two hundred j
years old, but the broad Restoration
humor was drawing laughs and
belly-laughs even from a Palo Alto 1
audience.
THE PERFORMANCE OF Stan
ford's own Margery Bailey as Lady j

, Wish fort left
nothing to be de
sired. The rest \
I, of the cast, good
as they were,
suffered by com- j
parison.
James Clancy j
and Elizabeth
Hardy as Mira- .
bell and Milla- i
mant, the love 1
interest, were a
■ veritable Bene-

diet and Beatrice. I would have had
William Melton, who was Fainall, !
the villain, a little more villainous,
though.
The three servants, Waitwell, Foi- j
ble, and Mincing (Winslow, Rey- 1
nolds, and Dam) performed with
consummate ease and grace. That, i
indeed, explains much of the charm
of the show; the freedom, the easy 1
air of all the performers was a de- !
light.
To hand out a few more garlands,
and I should have to name everyone
in the play to do justice, Harold
Reynolds' portrayal of the thick
headed but honest Sir Wilful Wit
woud was excellent, as were the ;
Witwoud and Petulant of Messrs. j
Brauns and Edberg. And Mistress i
Marwood (Norma Gruman) and
Mistress Fainall (Myna Hughes)
each contributed a full share to the
evening's pleasure.
THE PLAY, NATURALLY, WAS
cut a little and, generally speaking, i
the cutting was well done. How
ever, a few more lines for the de
velopment of Fainall's machinations
would have been useful.
Joy McFarland's costumes were j
good, and the wigs, constructed by j
Bernice Finlof, were outstanding.
The sets, which had to be impro- j
vised for this performance, were .
very satisfactory.
All in all, a bouquet must go to i
Director - Actor Robert Brauns, to j
the Hillbarn Theater, and to the
Dramatists' Alliance for a perform
ance of professional excellence. —

James Clancy j
and Elizabeth
Hardy as Mira- .
bell and Milla- i
mant, the love 1
interest, were a
■ veritable Bene-

diet and Beatrice. I would have had
William Melton, who was Fainall, !
the villain, a little more villainous,
though.
The three servants, Waitwell, Foi- j
ble, and Mincing (Winslow, Rey- 1
nolds, and Dam) performed with
consummate ease and grace. That, i
indeed, explains much of the charm
of the show; the freedom, the easy 1
air of all the performers was a de- !
light.
To hand out a few more garlands,
and I should have to name everyone
in the play to do justice, Harold
Reynolds' portrayal of the thick
headed but honest Sir Wilful Wit
woud was excellent, as were the ;
Witwoud and Petulant of Messrs. j
Brauns and Edberg. And Mistress i
Marwood (Norma Gruman) and
Mistress Fainall (Myna Hughes)
each contributed a full share to the
evening's pleasure.
THE PLAY, NATURALLY, WAS
cut a little and, generally speaking, i
the cutting was well done. How
ever, a few more lines for the de
velopment of Fainall's machinations
would have been useful.
Joy McFarland's costumes were j
good, and the wigs, constructed by j
Bernice Finlof, were outstanding.
The sets, which had to be impro- j
vised for this performance, were .
very satisfactory.
All in all, a bouquet must go to i
Director - Actor Robert Brauns, to j
the Hillbarn Theater, and to the
Dramatists' Alliance for a perform
ance of professional excellence. —

Last Friday night, for the Annual Assembly of Stanford's Dramatists' Alliance, the Hillbarn
Summer Theater presented a special performance of William Congreve's "Way of the World"
at the Palo Alto Community Center.
That is a restrained opening paragraph, but there was nothing restrained about my enjoy
ment or the enjoyment of the whole audience. There was none of your "determined-in-the-

name-of-culture" atmosphere. The"*
lines may have been two hundred j
years old, but the broad Restoration
humor was drawing laughs and
belly-laughs even from a Palo Alto 1
audience.
THE PERFORMANCE OF Stan
ford's own Margery Bailey as Lady j

, Wish fort left
nothing to be de
sired. The rest \
I, of the cast, good
as they were,
suffered by com- j
parison.
