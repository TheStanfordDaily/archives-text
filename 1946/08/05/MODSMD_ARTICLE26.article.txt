### 
In the July issue of Theater Arts, j
Dr. Hubert C. Heffner, head of the :
Speech and Drama Department, tolls ,
of Biarritz University where he was
chairman of the Department of
Drama.
His article describes the organiza
tion of the French university for
American G.l.'s following the ter
mination of the war.
Of his students he states, "Never
in my career of 25 years have I
seen so much talent and so much
interest. These GJ. students differ
in at least two respects from the
average American college student ;
Though their average age is ap
proximately 24 years, they are ac
tually in mental and emotional ma
turity much older."
He found, according to his article. I
that more interest was shown in the j
arts than is usual for colleges in the j
states.
"A great advantage," he conclud
ed, "which the B.A.U. students have |
had is that of close contact with a
large group of distinguished Amer- j
ican and European artists."
Heffner was on loan to the Army I
for the faculty of the B.A.U. from j
Stanford and returned to the cam- j
pus at the beginning of this quarter. |
James Broughton's "The Play
ground" has been published in the j
magazine. Broughton. a Stanford !
graduate, won the Alden Award for
1945 at Stanford with his "Summer
Fury."
"Th.e Playground" was one of
seven original plays of young writ- j
ers published by the magazine an- t
nually.
