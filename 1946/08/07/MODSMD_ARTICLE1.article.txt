Earliest returns from Missouri's
Fifth Congressional District gave
Enos Axteli, endorsed by Presi
dent Truman. Jim Pendergast and
the PAC, a wide lead over in
cumbent Representative Robert
Slaughter. Slaughter, as a mem
ber of the House Rules Commit
tee, interfered so much with Tru
man's legislative program that the
President personally asked for his
defeat.
Truman's popularity, according to

national polls,
has slumped bad
ly from the end
of the war, and
the re-election of
Slaughter would
have been a seri
ous blow at his
influence over
Congress. Ax -
t e 11' s election,
naturally, oper-

ates as a popular endorsement of
the President.
"Informed sources" stated yes
terday that the British are about
ready to give up their Palestine
mandate and turn the embattled
Holy Land back to the United
Nations, as successors of the
League, unless President Truman
accepts the partition proposal or
advances some better idea. TKe
British attitude is bitter; they feel
that the partition plan is being
sacrificed to American domestic
political considerations.
The Paris conference had a hec
tic day yesterday. Messrs. Byrnes
and Molotov, in the midst of the
rules committee row about vot
ing majorities—of which it is suf
ficient to say that as yet they have
come to no decision—spent the
afternoon wrangling with each
other. Byrnes accused Molotov of
trying to use the Big Four For
eign Ministers' Confrence to dic
tate to the present meeting. Mo
lotov told Byrnes that the Big
Tour was an American idea in the
first place. Byrnes told Molotov
that he was inconsistent, that he
was surprised at him, and chal
lenged the Soviet representative
to have his remarks published in
the Russian press. Molotov told
Byrnes that he was inconsistent
and that the Russian papers would
print the American's remarks iij
full, which was more, he said, than
the American papers had done for
his speech the day before. Appar
ently this "you're another" busi
ness went on for hours. Finally
rules committee chairman Paul
Spaak adjournd the meeting for
dinner and a "cooling-off period."
The Mead committee has an
nounced that it is through with the
affairs of the Garssons; the Depart
ment of Justice has announced that
the FBI is taking up the investiga
tion. And down in Louisiana a fed
eral grand jury is looking into the
affairs of Andrew J. Higgins. the
landing boat magnate.
