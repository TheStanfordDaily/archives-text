# Here Are Some That Didn't Win

Litchfield, Midget Camp Curry,
Stanvelford. Dibford, Hopkins Oaks.
The North Forty, Casa Adjunta de
Stanford.
Wading through a pile of names
like these —250 of them—the board
of judges of the Stanford Daily's $25
naming contest for the new veter
ans' housing area decided it takes
a contest to bring the campus char
acters out of their nooks.
THE SUGGESTED NAMES ran
the gamut from caustic sarcasm
Last Hesort to Spanish semantics
like Arboleda.
Through all these names which
had caused scratched heads from
San Francisco to San Jose ran a
steady stream of entries suggesting
Stanford Village. This name was

I not only the selection of the judges j
! but also the suggestion of the ma- 1
I jority of the contest entrants.
SEVERAL NAMES MORE close
! ly tied to area history, such as j
Sherwood, the name of the old Tim
othy Hopkins estate where Stanford j
Village stands, or Timothy Hopkins
Hall. were rejected as bringing in |
( the name of a person or being too j
■ difficult for outsiders to grasp.
The Spanish experts had a field j
i day with entries like Cercillo. Los
j Arboles. La Posada, El Cascrio, El
Abrigo. El Dorado. Vega. Mostaza,
Altramuz, Cordonhr.. and Alfnencia. j
The Quad came in for a compli- |
mentary play— Quadville. Quadrina.
Quadrona, Qtiadenlo.
j COMBINATION ARTISTS IIAI>

a big time -Stanfordville, Stanvet
ford, The Stable, combining the STA
of Stanford and the BLE of Dibble,
and Vetsity Apartments.
The optimists — Happy Hunting
Ground; the pessimists—Litchfield;
the literal ones—Stanford —U.S. Vets
Memorial Annex; the historians—
Lathrop Court; the rememberers—
Kefauver Court—they all were pres
ent.
To some the prospect of living in
Farm Housing or Dunn Rovin will
make the Stanford Village a disap
pointment; others will be glad that
simplicity won through over Stan
ford La'ldita. Herbert Hoover
Homes, Llaneros, Farm Yard,
Rough ton. or Branburdan (Branner,
Wilbur. Jordan).
