EXCOM II
Why shouldn't Stanford Excom be larger?
The present set-up might be more efficient from the point
of view of authorizing a dance or appointing a committee, but
smallness robs it of any training value for a large number of
students, and, as a general thing, few Stanfordites know or care
whether Excom is alive or dead.
With a sudden increase of population such as that at Stan
ford Village, Excom is thrown into a dither because any system
of proportional representation on a small committee would
put residents of The Village firmly in the saddle. A larger group
could be more rounded.
From a point of view of training students to handle their own
government and of interesting a number of people in the
problems of student government, a Senate arrangement where
bills or presented and argued by 50 or 60 elected student repre
sentatives is to be preferred.
"It will take too much time. Too complicated," the critics
cry. Even if the present Excom were kept as a stearing com
mittee for a larger, Senate-type governmental forum, the pas
sage of a particular bill would be delayed.
But the added advantage of having a greater number of
elected students participate in voting the decisions which run
their University outweighs any loss of time.
Especially since that loss of time could be made up by the
adoption of a standing sub-committee system as proposed ,in
Monday's Daily.
At present we have a small group elected once a year and
promptly forgotten by the student body, forced to work under
a system demonstrably inefficient. We could have a structure
which trains a lot of students while it gets the job done just as
fast, just as well, and with some signs of life.
