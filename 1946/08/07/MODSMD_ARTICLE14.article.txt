## Bull Session 
### 
One of the afternoon music
classes was the other day the scene
of the best campus story of the
quarter to date.
One of the members of the class
was a little drowsy after a big
meal, so he dozed off in his place
while the instructor lectured.
Pretty soon the instructor noticed

he was minus
a listener, so he
stopped lectur
ing and began
to stare at the
sleeper.
Soon the en
tire class was
staring at the
sleeper.
The guy sit
ting next to

him decided to wake him up so
he could get a look at the class
looking at him.
He prodded our sleeping friend
a few times with his elbow.
The sleeper didn't even open his
own eyes. He merely stirred in
his chair.
"Oh, honey," he muttered, "leave
me alone."

Father Flanagan of Boys' Town
fame had better check his mailing
list over a little more carefully in
the future.
The other day the P.O. received
i letter addressed to:
"Mr. L. Stanford. Jr.
"University,
"Stanford, Calif."

We finally found out why the
work on the road out in back of
the P.O. has taken such a long
time to finish.
The original work consisted of
taking off the old pavement to let
the roadbase dry out before new
pavement was laid.
The drying was proceeding in
fine style until the freak rain of
a couple of weeks ago.
All of the gutters from the Knoll
lown the hill poured water into
he gaping hole, nullifying the
trying whicth had taken place and
setting the work back a couple of
veeks.
And then the other night the
ooys from the Firehouse went out
o test their hoses.
The gutters filled the hole up

again.
Now the maintenance crew is
filling the holes up with rock.

Fellow columnist W. E. Bailey is
causing a lot of dissension around
the Shack. He writes his own col
umn and never makes a typo
graphical error unless it's for the
purpose of alleged humor, but
Monday he sabotaged this column
with a typo. It was the first time
this quarter, but it appeared the
issue after Bailey's first ETAOIN
SHRDLU effort. Mighty suspi
cious, Bailey, mighty suspicious.
