The Editor, Sir:
Could you please tell us some
thing about the tree with the
beautiful red blossoms that is
growing at the west end of the i
Inner Quad? The blossoms have
been out for a month. We should
like to know what it is, where it
came from, who planted it, how
old it is and so on. It is very at
tractive and interesting to us who
have never seen anything like it
before.
If there are several rare trees on
the Inner Quad, perhaps a little
wooden sign could be hung on 1
them the way they do in botanical 1
gardens.
Yours very truly.
Rick and Rosemary Daenitz
(Editor's Note: Mr. Meier, in
charge of the Stanford Nursery, j
tells us that the tree is a Stac
iila. and it came to the Farm
from China. It was planted im
mediately when the Quad was
first planned. About the signsâ€”
Mr. Meier says it's a fine idea
but they tried it once before
and everybody tore them down.)
