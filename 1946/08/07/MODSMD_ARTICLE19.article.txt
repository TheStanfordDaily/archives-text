## 
### 
If you like Bette Davis, you will perhaps relish "A Stolen
Life" now playing at the Stanford Theatre, although it is not one
of the better Davis' productions.
Miss Davis plays twins which should make "A Stolen Life"
doubly good, but somehow the story doesn't guite come off.

It seems that Miss Davis as twins
are both in love with the same
man, Glen Ford, and he can't make
up his mind.
FINALLY THE SEA CLAIMS
Miss Davis Number One which

more or less
solves the prob
lem, but not the
sad story, and
Glenn Ford gets
Miss Davis
Number Two. i
As you can
see, it is all
pretty involved,
and when it is
all over one has c
the feeling that e

it really wasn't worth all that
trouble after all.
DANE CLARK IS MISCAST AS
a painter, but does a pretty credit
able job nevertheless.

Also on the same bill is "The
Cisco Kid" starring John Gilbrt.
It is a Monogram production.
