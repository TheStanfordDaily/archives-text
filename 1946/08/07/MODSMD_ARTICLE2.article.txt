## 
### 
At least 15 names will be pre
sented to Excom tonight for ap
proval as sponsors for fall quarter
in Encina and Toyon halls, accord
ing to A 1 Forbes, member of a spe
cial Excom committee to recom
mend sponsors.
Remainder will be placed before
Excom at its meeting next Wed
nesday.
A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY
GO applications for the positions have
been received or are expected this
week by Forbes. Six jobs are open
in Toyon and 24 in Encina. Number
of sponsors for Dibble has not yet
been determined.
Under the new plan of hall super
vision, sponsors will receive no re
muneration, but will be given pref
erence in room assignments and
will be allowed to choose their j
roommate. Sponsors' rooms will I
house two students, rather than
three.
SPONSORS WILL HELP main
tain order in the halls and will also
act as hall club officers until hall
residents are sufficiently organized, j
according to Forbes. At that time. 1
government will be returned to j
the students.
Under the new plan, Excom will
maintain a standing committee
which will keep a file on all stu- !
dents interested in the sponsor jobs.
The committee will make recom
mendations to Excom from this file.
IN PREVIOUS QUARTERS, the
sponsors were appointed by the Di
rector of Men's Residences after in
formal discussions with the Dean ol
men and with student groups.
The position of Resident Assistant j
will be abolished fall quarter. Res
ident Counselors, assisted by the
sponsors, will take over many of
the R.A.'s duties. Counselors will
be graduate students working un
der the direction of the Dean of
Students.
