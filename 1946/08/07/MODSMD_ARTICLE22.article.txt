Stanford's football chances for
fall took a decided turn for the
worse when it was learned that
Buck Fawcett, who is still in Japan,
will not be out of the service in
time for fall practice, let alone fall
quarter.
Anyone who has played football
at high school or in the service
should see Coach Marchie Schwartz
before the end of the quarter, for
experienced players are needed.
FOOTBALL PRACTICE OPENS
Sept. 3. Schwartz would like to see

a large turnout for practice with the
hope that someone might turn up
that would help out.
The worry is not the fact that we
will not have a fair squad, but the
worry is that everyone else will be
loaded. We have possibilities, but
the other toams have more than
that; they have outstanding pla*yers.
It takes more than possibilities to
win games.

A WEEK AGO TODAY, THIS
column stated that San Francisco
should win five out of seven games
from the Oaks. The Seals did just
that.
With only seven weeks left in the
coast league schedule, Larry Jan
sen is eight short of 30 wins. Figur
ing' on ten more starts the rest of
the season, Jansen should be able
to come through, provided nothing
unforeseen happens.
lIIS PITCHING THIS YEAR HAS
been phenomenal. He has started
27 games and finished 23. He has
lost but three games all season long
against his 22 wins. If he can con
tinue this pace, the record he makes
will hold up for at least a decade.
His earned-run average is about
1.5 per game.
Our nomination for most valuable
player in the minor leagues goes to
the Seals' Larry Jansen.
