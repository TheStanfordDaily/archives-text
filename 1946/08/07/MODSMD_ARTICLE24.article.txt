feated twirler in the close pitching
duel.
The Legal Eagles were on the
verge of losing their case as they
came back to win their tussle with
the beefingest - Encina IV team to be
seen in many a season. Final score:
9-8.
ENCINA 1W lIAD THE GAME
in the palm of their collective mitt
at the end of third round with a
solid score of eight tallies to a naked
goose-egg for the lawyers.
In a rapid cross-examination the
attorneys found a few flaws in the
testimony of pitcher Gus Chavalas
of Encina and the score went to 8-4.
It still looked a sure acquittal for
IW.
IN A FINAL REBUTTAL THE
legal men presented Exhibit "A"
which consisted of four scores in the

last inning. Score: 8-8. In thc +
eighth Encina again took the stand, 1
but went down in order.
Then in the last half of the eighth
an error and a single gave the law- !
yers a 9-8 victory. Case decided in 1
favor of Walt Chouteau's Legal ;
Eagles.
IN WHAT WAS PREDICTED
by so-called experts to be a very ]
tight game the Sigma Nu squad '
played peggy-on-the-bounce with
Encina lE's team with a final result !
of 18-1.
Encina decided to unveil a new j
left-handed pitcher, one Bruce Wor
thington. After a -good first inning i
that poor Encinan was rapidly re- |
veiled in favor of regular hurler
Mike Schulman.
Behind 7-0 going into the third
after the unveiling, Schulman looked
hot stuff for the third and fourth j
frames and the S.N. took up where i
they had left off. Eight errors by
Encina were slightly demoralizing '
factors for the Encina moundsmen. i
GOING THE EASY ROUTE FOR
the poor-man's Red Sox was Herb
Eggleston, who fanned six in seven
innings. Handling his slants was
Howie "the lip" Hoffman. Leading
the "Murderers' Row" was Chuck

legal men presented Exhibit "A"
which consisted of four scores in the

last inning. Score: 8-8. In thc +
eighth Encina again took the stand, 1
but went down in order.
Then in the last half of the eighth

IN WHAT WAS PREDICTED
by so-called experts to be a very ]
tight game the Sigma Nu squad '
played peggy-on-the-bounce with
Encina lE's team with a final result !
of 18-1.
Encina decided to unveil a new j
left-handed pitcher, one Bruce Wor
thington. After a -good first inning i
that poor Encinan was rapidly re- |
veiled in favor of regular hurler
Mike Schulman.
Behind 7-0 going into the third
after the unveiling, Schulman looked
hot stuff for the third and fourth j
frames and the S.N. took up where i
they had left off. Eight errors by
Encina were slightly demoralizing '
factors for the Encina moundsmen. i
GOING THE EASY ROUTE FOR
the poor-man's Red Sox was Herb
Eggleston, who fanned six in seven
innings. Handling his slants was
Howie "the lip" Hoffman. Leading
the "Murderers' Row" was Chuck
Kober with three for four, including
a home run.
League I's winners took the mural
playoff spotlight as they clumped all
three of the League II entries by
scores of 4-2, 9-8. and 18-1 in yes
terday's murals.
A homer by Bob Smith with one
man aboard in the last half of the
last frame broke a 2-2 tie and gave
Phi Delta Kappa a 4-2 victory over
SONA, League II champs.
808 BROWN WAS THE win
ning hurler for P.D.K. George
Smith, Navy hurler, was the de
feated twirler in the close pitching
duel.
The Legal Eagles were on the
verge of losing their case as they
came back to win their tussle with
the beefingest - Encina IV team to be
seen in many a season. Final score:
9-8.
ENCINA 1W lIAD THE GAME
in the palm of their collective mitt
at the end of third round with a
solid score of eight tallies to a naked
goose-egg for the lawyers.
In a rapid cross-examination the
attorneys found a few flaws in the
testimony of pitcher Gus Chavalas
of Encina and the score went to 8-4.
It still looked a sure acquittal for
IW.
