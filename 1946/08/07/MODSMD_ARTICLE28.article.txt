Dr. Hans Staub and Dr. Felix Bloch of the Stanford physics
department will leave soon for Los Alamos Atomic Bomb Labora

be held August 19 to 24.
In the meantime, the University is considering sending some

graduate students to the

fields in which the laboratory spe- !

Plans for such a program were |
announced recently by Dr. Noris E.
