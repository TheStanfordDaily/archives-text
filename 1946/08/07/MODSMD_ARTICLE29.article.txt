## 
### CARL HEINTZE 
When the "School for Scandal," 112
Richard Sheridan's 18th - century 1
English comedy, is presented on the j
.stage of Memorial Hall next Thurs
day, Friday and Saturday it will 1
have a traditional 18th-century set. j
Designed by Wendell Cole, the
setting for the play will evolve from
a huge stage-wide "basic" set of
white and gold based on 18th-cen
tury styles of architecture.
SMALLER INTERIOR SETTINGS
will be wheeled into the main set, a
backdrop of huge pillars and gold
columns. They will represent the i
backdrops for the various scene j
â€¢changes which take place during
'School for Scandal."
All the major architectural styles |
of 18th-century England will be in- I
eluded: rococco, Georgian, and Chi- {
nest; Chippendale. An unusual fea
ture of the entire setting, accord- |
ing to Mr. Cole, is that the complete
.set will be done in only two colors,
while and gold.
in AnnrnoN to columns j
and pillars there will be several
.statues of Cupid. Recordings of |
18th-century music will be played t
during the scene changes to add to ,
the effect.
Members of the stage crew who
are constructing the set for "School j
for Scandal" under Mr. Cole's direc
tion are John Shepherd, Norman
Varnardo, Martin Nalder, Elizabeth
Berry, and Allen Forbes.
"School for Scandal" will be the
last production of the Stanford i
Players' summer quarter season. It |
will be presented Aug. 15, IG, and 17
in the main auditorium of Memo- ,
rial Hall. All seats are reserved, j
Tickets are now on sale at the box
office in the rear of Memorial Hall. ;
