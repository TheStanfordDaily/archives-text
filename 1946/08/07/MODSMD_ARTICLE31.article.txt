# Hot Time for All At Firemen's Ball
## 
### 
With fireplugs, fire ladders, and
firemen the Women's Gym will be
transformed to resemble a lirehouse
Saturday night when the student
firemen present their all - campus
"Sport-Shirt Jamboree."
Offering door prizes in the form
of several pairs of nylon hose, and
free dinnrs at Longbarn, Rickey's,
and Dinah's Shack with a special
feature surprise award to be an
nounced, the firemen plan a pleas
ant evening for all.
Dancing will be to the music of
Art Weidner's band and refresh
ments will be served.
Bids are still on sale at the A.S.-
S.U. office, for $2.40 per couple and
all money raised will be used to
buy new uniforms for next quar
ter's student firemen.
The question of what to wear to
a ''Sport - Shirt Jamboree" is an
swered by the firemen with "dress
for comfort." If it is hot, wear a
sport shirt and if it grows colder
add a sweater or coat. Another spe
cial prize will be awarded for the
fanciest sport shirt worn to the
dance.
