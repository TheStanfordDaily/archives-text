(Editor's Note: A letter signed
R. F. K. Seal, '41, appeared in
tlie Campus Opinion column of
Monday's Daily. This letter con
tained several questions under
the general heading "How is the
veteran being treated?" and it
requested that the Daily secure
and publish the answers.)
First, the writer wished to
know if the Bookstore makes al
lowances on the accounts for the
rebate which applies to cash pur
chases by veterans.
ACCORDING TO STANFORD
Bookstore officials, such an allow
ance is made. The veterans' lim
ited accounts are not charged any
more than if they were buying
their books and supplies them
selves and receiving a cash rebate.
In connection with the Branner
argument. Mr. Seal wished to know
the number of A.B. degrees which
have been given to men and to
women since, but not including,
the 1942 graduation.
The records reveal that during
the 1942-43 academic year 432
men and 285 women received A.B.
degrees. In 1943-44, 269 men and
302 women were thus honored.
The figures for the 1944-45 school
year were 162 men and 359 wom
en. Last year 288 men and 398
wAjnen received the degree.
StAL'S THIRD QUESTION re
quested figures on how many non
veterans of both sexes are in
cluded in the new incoming class
due next quarter.
Dr. H. Donald Winbigler, Uni
versity Registrar, was able to pro
vide only an estimate from counts
made several weeks ago. These
estimates indicate that from 40 to
45 per cent of the entering fresh

men, 80 per cent of the sophomore
transfers, and from 95 to 100 per
cent of the upper division trans
fers are veterans.
Dr. Winbigler was unable to
fulfill Seal's request for figures or
the percentage of the qualified ap
plicants who were not admitted
were veterans. Dr. Winbigler
stated, "We kept no records and
it would be impossible to get that
information now."
Seal's last question was, '"Wh\
should not some non-veteran wait
only one year, rather than force
him (the veteran) to wait another
year? Is there any possible ex
cuse for this?"
The Committee on Admission?
found it impossible to follow sue':',
a policy for several reasons.
First, the University believes
that it has an obligation to the
normal-aged high school graduate
who, with the continuation of St •
lective service, will be a veteran.
SECOND. IT WAS DECIDED
that there was no point in making
one crime atone for another by
wilfully dislocating the careers of
more young men because it was
done once through the necessity
of war.
And, third, it was determined
that a 'teen-aged non-veteran wh:
showed promise through his pre
vious record should not be forceo.
aside in favor of a less promising
veteran.
Winbigler stated that admissions
for next year have been based en
tirely upon promise and merit and
that where two applicants were
evenly matched, veterans were
given preference. By following
this policy, the incoming class wi'.
be fairly evenly divided.

The figures for the 1944-45 school
year were 162 men and 359 wom
en. Last year 288 men and 398
wAjnen received the degree.
StAL'S THIRD QUESTION re
quested figures on how many non
veterans of both sexes are in
cluded in the new incoming class
due next quarter.
Dr. H. Donald Winbigler, Uni
versity Registrar, was able to pro
vide only an estimate from counts
made several weeks ago. These
estimates indicate that from 40 to
45 per cent of the entering fresh

men, 80 per cent of the sophomore
transfers, and from 95 to 100 per
cent of the upper division trans
fers are veterans.
Dr. Winbigler was unable to
fulfill Seal's request for figures or
the percentage of the qualified ap
plicants who were not admitted
were veterans. Dr. Winbigler
stated, "We kept no records and
it would be impossible to get that
information now."
Seal's last question was, '"Wh\
should not some non-veteran wait
only one year, rather than force
him (the veteran) to wait another
year? Is there any possible ex
cuse for this?"
The Committee on Admission?
found it impossible to follow sue':',
a policy for several reasons.
First, the University believes
that it has an obligation to the
normal-aged high school graduate
who, with the continuation of St •
lective service, will be a veteran.
SECOND. IT WAS DECIDED
that there was no point in making
one crime atone for another by
wilfully dislocating the careers of
more young men because it was
done once through the necessity
of war.
And, third, it was determined
that a 'teen-aged non-veteran wh:
showed promise through his pre
vious record should not be forceo.
aside in favor of a less promising
veteran.
Winbigler stated that admissions
for next year have been based en
tirely upon promise and merit and
that where two applicants were
evenly matched, veterans were
given preference. By following
this policy, the incoming class wi'.
be fairly evenly divided.
(Editor's Note: A letter signed
R. F. K. Seal, '41, appeared in
tlie Campus Opinion column of
Monday's Daily. This letter con
tained several questions under
the general heading "How is the
veteran being treated?" and it
requested that the Daily secure
and publish the answers.)
First, the writer wished to
know if the Bookstore makes al
lowances on the accounts for the
rebate which applies to cash pur
chases by veterans.
ACCORDING TO STANFORD
Bookstore officials, such an allow
ance is made. The veterans' lim
ited accounts are not charged any
more than if they were buying
their books and supplies them
selves and receiving a cash rebate.
In connection with the Branner
argument. Mr. Seal wished to know
the number of A.B. degrees which
have been given to men and to
women since, but not including,
the 1942 graduation.
The records reveal that during
the 1942-43 academic year 432
men and 285 women received A.B.
degrees. In 1943-44, 269 men and
302 women were thus honored.
