# Tradition Going to Dogs
## 
### TOM SELF 
On one of the recent hot days a
perspiring rough staggered into the
Cellar and leaned heavily on the
. igar counter. He was breathing
hard.
Being of a sympathetic nature, we
c.sked him what was the matter. Be
tween gasps he told us his story.
"JUST WALKED ALL THE WAY
from the golf course. Cars just
whizzed by me. Counted 52 of them. |
Wasn't this way in the good old
days at Stanford."
The same clay our roommate
dropped into the room and collapsed
in a chair. Two hours before he had
started up town to get his laundry.
He thought it would take him half
an hour at the most. But no one
heeded his haggard look or his out
stretched thumb.
THESE CASES ARE illustrative
,'f another Stanford tradition that is
going to the dogs, that of picking j
up students under the oak tree or !
."it Wilson's corner in Paly. There
was a time when it was easy to get
a ride to town or back to the Farm.
But now the motorists speed by,
seemingly unmindful of their fel- !
low students broiling in the sun.
Whether the drivers are callously
selfish or whether they are mostly

new students unfamiliar to Stanford
courtesy is not known. But one fact
is certain: some of the heartless
drivers are former servicemen who
just a few months or a year ago
were saving furlough money by re
ceiving free rides. Then they were
grateful that people picked them up. !
OF COURSE THE HIGHWAY
patrol and other well-meaning but
ignorant organizations put out fre
quent propaganda that it is danger
ous to pick up hitch-hikers.
However, we can assure any i
driver who is timid on this account I
that Stanford students are not dan
gerous and they have no infectious
diseases. Some of them are walking
because the new car they have been '
waiting for so patiently has been j
delayed by
At all events, since the Stanford
student body is indeed one big fam
ily, the motorist who regularly
passes up walkers is not passing a |
mere hitch-hiker but a friend or
classmate, one of the family.
Pick 'em up.
