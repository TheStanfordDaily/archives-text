# Encinamen Start Adobe Creek Trek
## 
### 
Starting at three this afternoon
some 275 Encina men and their
dates will migrate to the Adobe
Creek Lodge for an afternoon and
evening of swimming, tennis, bad
minton, and dancing.
Men who still need transportation
to and from the party should see
Grant Hoyt in room 128, Encina, and
make arrangements.
Refreshments will be served after
six in the form of hot dogs, ice
cream, and Coca-Cola and ticket
stubs must be saved in order to get
the free refreshments.

In 1872, Col. James Fisk, Jr.,
"King of Wall Street," was shot in
New York City by Edward Stokes
on Jan. 6. He died two days later.
Stokes got four years.
