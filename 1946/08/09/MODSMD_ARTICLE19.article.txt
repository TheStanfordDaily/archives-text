# Part-Time Positions Sought For Students
## 
### 
Part-time jobs for needy students are being sought by the
University, Dr. Robert N. Bush, director of the Student Employ
ment Office, said yesterday.
His office is cooperating with the Community Veterans Em
ployment Council in a special attempt to locate jobs for veterans

who will enroll next quarter.
"With the student body expected
to reach 7,000 this fall as a result
of the influx of veterans," Dr. Bush
said, "the need for part-time jobs
will be greater than ever before.
Already requests from students for
help in finding suitable work to
supplement their income are piling
up in the Student Employment Of
nce."
PRESENT NEEDS, HE declared,
-.re two-fold:
1. F'ull-time temporary work be
tween the summer and fall quar
;ers, some to begin August 19, the
majority to begin August 31.
2. Part - time work, which will
continue through the school year, for
students registering Sept. 23 for the
fall quarter. In many cases stu
dents plan to remain at the Uni
versity several years and want work
vhich gives part-time employment
during the entire school course.
MOST REQUESTS IN TIIE FIRST
.nstance are for manual labor jobs
with pay sufficient to enable the
student to build up a small reserve
before the beginning of school.
In the second instance work
schedules must be arranged in ac
cordance with class schedules. Or
dinarily students can work from
two to four or five hours daily, but
nany will be able to work all af
ternoon two or three days a week.
GARDENING HAS BEEN A lu
crative source of employment.
Service station attendants, sales
men in stores and markets, stock
room workers, cashiers, restaurant
..nd janitor services, bookkeepers,
clerk - typists, and some highly
>killed and technical applicants are
available, he said.
''In order to serve both the com
munity and the students in the most
effective manner, the Student Em
ployment Office welcomes listings
;>f jobs as early as personnel needs
..re known," Dr. Bush said.
His office may be reached by
