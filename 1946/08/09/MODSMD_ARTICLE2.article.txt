The Paris Peace Conference
again failed to live tip to its name
yesterday, when its plenary ses
sion devoted itself to an ab initio
rehash of the voting question. The
Utiles Committee of the Confer
ence had adopted a compromise
measure which would have al
lowed the Big Four, who must ap
prove any action of the Confer
ence, to consider any measure
approved I y a majority or by a
two-thirds vote. Yesterday Molo
tov, in the plenary session, raised
the whole question again, sup
ported by the Soviet satellites.
The meeting opened on a note of

acquiescent ex
haustion after
the bitter verbal
battle in the
Rules Commit
tee. Apparently
it was too quiet.
Reports of the
Paris Conference
continue to draw
a parallel be
tween Russia's

battle for the two-thirds rule there
and her determined stand for her
veto rights in the Security Council.
Harry Bridges of the ILWU
presented the first of their de
mands to waterfront employers in
San Francisco today, as negotia
tions for a new contract opened.
Bridges started by rejecting an
offer "to mutually forego action"
demands concerned hours; "wage
demands concerned hours; wage
demands will come later,"
Bridges said.
In discussion of waterfront labor
conditions up and down the coast,
Bridges said that he was thinking of
"advising the Los Angeles men that
we have a better way to kick them
in the teeth" than a slowdown. And
be made the statement that Presi
dent Truman's fact-finding board in
the "Mello Franco" dispute at Coos
Bay would issue a "rigged report."
By way of comment, Harry's atti
tude seems to be one of anything
but co-operation; doesn't seem a bit
interested in contributing to in
creased production, the revival of

world Iraclc, etc.
Monday Ihe new OPA Decon
trol Board will open lour days of
public hearings to gather informa
tion on farm product ceilings. If
they do not act one way or an
other by August 20. price ceilings
go back on these products.
Reconversion Director John
Steelman yesterday refused to ap
prove a price increase for lumber
based on increased pay for Pa
cific Northwest lumbermen. The
industry had received one pay
raise last autumn which, Steelman
said, established its reconversion
pattern. This is the first such ac
tion by the government and is
based on the stabilization pro
gram established last February.
Although UNRRA Director-Gen
eral La Guardia recommended to
the UNRRA Council. meeting in
Geneva, that the agency be liqui
dated about October 1, he did agree
DP\s should continue until the U.N.
refugee organization is ready to
take over. Assistant Secretary of
State Will Clayton, present for the
United States, suggested that na
tions still needing assistance apply
to other nations on an individual
basis.
Both the recent cases in or near
the admiralty jurisdiction seem
headed for some sort of settlement.
In the matter of the "American
Farmer," it appears that the "Eliza
bete" will get her salvage rights,
amounting to more than a million
dollars, possibly. And in the mat
ter of Tony Cornero Stralla and his
good ships "Lux" and "Bunker Hill,"
Stralla was arrested and freed on
bond today on fourteen counts of
criminal conspiracy to violate Long
Beach municipal ordinances and
California anti-gambling statutes.
President Truman todav will
sign the enlisted terminal leave
pay act. Application forms and
the bonds themselves are already
rolling off the government presses.
Forms will be distributed through
post offices when readv.
