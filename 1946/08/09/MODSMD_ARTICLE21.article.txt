will not be possible for a couple of
Weeks, Forbes reported.
Herbert J. Wunderlich, resident

the meeting and gave Excom mem
bers an idea oi the housing and gov
ernment problems to be faced there.
Other matters brought up at the
meeting were a pre-reg committee
report given by Roberta Mace and
a discussion of the Reg dance prob
lem.
It was pointed out that no place
on this campus is large enough to
accommodate the large number of
students who presumably will at

use of banners and large pictures of
the campus was referred to a com
