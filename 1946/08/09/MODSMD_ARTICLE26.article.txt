# Shirts Cleaned For Fire Ball
## 
### 
Stanford's student firemen pre
sent their all-campus "Sport-Shirt
Jamboree" in the Women's Gym
Saturday night and the fanciest
sport shirts on the Farm are being
cleaned for the occasion.
Featuring the line music of Art
Weidner's ten-piece orchestra, the
dance will get under way at nine
and last until one. Bids may still
be purchased at the A.S.S.U. office
for $2.40 per couple.
DOOR PRIZES IN THE FORM
of "hard-to-get" nylons and free
dinners at Longbarn, Dinah's Shack,
and Rickey's will be awarded to the
holders of the lucky ticket stubs.
The problem of what to wear is
easily solved by ihe firehouse boys
with the simple comment "dress for
comfort." Wear the "gayest" sport
shirt you can find and then add a
coat or a sweater if the weather
turns colder.
Decorations for the dance will
follow the lines of a firehouse with
the Women's Gym being converted
as much as possible by adding fire
plugs, fire ladders, fire axes, and
gremen.
IN THE INNER COURT OF THE
Gym the fountain is being wired
for sound and soft lights which will
provide music and atmosphere for
the dancers.
A grand surprise award will be
given to the man who wears the
fanciest sport shirt so plenty of col
or is assured for the dance.
Refreshments will be served and
a cleverly concealed snack bar will
be in operation for the dancers.
