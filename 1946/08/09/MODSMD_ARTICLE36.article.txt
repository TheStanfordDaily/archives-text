We had the pleasure of seeing
Tony Lazzeri play but a I'ew times
and that in his last days as a player,
but. to us, he played like a cham
pion. He finished his playing days
where he started, in the Pacific-
Coast League.
One of the greatest hitting j-econd
basemen to go up to the majors,
the home run record Lazzeri made
playing for Salt Lake City some
twenty years ago still stands.
There were few infields in mod
ern baseball to compare with the
infield of the New York Yankees of
Lazzeri's day consisting of Lou !
Gehrig at first, Lazzeri at second.
Frank Crossetti at short, and Red
Rolph at third.
The passing away of Tony Lazzeri
leaves but two left of that infield
alive, Crossetti who is still with the
Yanks, and Rolph now coaching the
Yale baseball team.

ACCORDING TO A PUBLICITY
release from the Los Angeles Rams, i
Tom Harmon will be playing second
string when the season opens up ;
towards the end of this month.
We wonder if Harmon has seen
the release, for he's not the type to
play second string to anyone. He's !
either got to be the whole show or
else he doesn't play. He may have :
changed, but we wonder.
Of course, this could be just pub
licity, nothing more than that. Our j
guess is that he will play first string j
this year, or else Harmon will quit
when it comes time to renew his;
contract. The Rams realize the !
name Harmon is a drawing card and ;
will use it to advantage. Every j
publicity handout we have received j
has carried Harmon's name ever ]
since the Ram's signed him.

ED STAMM. FORMER ALL-
Coast tackle and member of the |
1941 Rose Bowl team, will coach the :
jayvees in the fall. From what we }
hear, the varsity squad will carry ]
about 50 men with the jayvees tak- j
ing care of the rest. Off hand, it
looks as if the jayvee squad will
be bigger than the varsity, that is,
if the number coming to early prac
tice remain out for football. The
jayvee season will consist of about
six games.

THE SAN FRANCISCO '49ERS,
currently training at Menlo Park,
will divide their strength next Fri
day night in an intra-squad game
at San Jose's Spartan Stadium. One
team will consist of Stanford's Fran
kie Albert at quarter, Stanford's
Norm Standlee at full, Fordham's j
Len Eshmont at one half, and Mar
quette's "Strike" Stryzkalski at the
other half.
The opposing backfield will con- |
sist of either Santa Clara's Jess
Freitas or Mississippi's Parker Hall j
at quarter, Santa Clara's Kenny Ca- |
sanega at one half. Oregon State's ,
Don Durdan at the other half, and (
Washington State's Dick Renfro at
full.
Wonder what Dick Hanley meant j
when he said the '49ers have little :
reserve strength in the backfield.
For those interested, the '49ers !
hold practice at Menlo every day,

ED STAMM. FORMER ALL-
Coast tackle and member of the |
1941 Rose Bowl team, will coach the :
jayvees in the fall. From what we }
hear, the varsity squad will carry ]
about 50 men with the jayvees tak- j
ing care of the rest. Off hand, it
looks as if the jayvee squad will
be bigger than the varsity, that is,
if the number coming to early prac
tice remain out for football. The
jayvee season will consist of about
six games.

THE SAN FRANCISCO '49ERS,
currently training at Menlo Park,
will divide their strength next Fri
day night in an intra-squad game
at San Jose's Spartan Stadium. One
team will consist of Stanford's Fran
kie Albert at quarter, Stanford's
Norm Standlee at full, Fordham's j
Len Eshmont at one half, and Mar
quette's "Strike" Stryzkalski at the
other half.
The opposing backfield will con- |
sist of either Santa Clara's Jess
Freitas or Mississippi's Parker Hall j
at quarter, Santa Clara's Kenny Ca- |
sanega at one half. Oregon State's ,
Don Durdan at the other half, and (
Washington State's Dick Renfro at
full.
Wonder what Dick Hanley meant j
when he said the '49ers have little :
reserve strength in the backfield.
For those interested, the '49ers !
hold practice at Menlo every day,
and it is open to the public.
We had the pleasure of seeing
Tony Lazzeri play but a I'ew times
and that in his last days as a player,
but. to us, he played like a cham
pion. He finished his playing days
where he started, in the Pacific-
Coast League.
One of the greatest hitting j-econd
basemen to go up to the majors,
the home run record Lazzeri made
playing for Salt Lake City some
twenty years ago still stands.
There were few infields in mod
ern baseball to compare with the
infield of the New York Yankees of
Lazzeri's day consisting of Lou !
Gehrig at first, Lazzeri at second.
Frank Crossetti at short, and Red
Rolph at third.
The passing away of Tony Lazzeri
leaves but two left of that infield
alive, Crossetti who is still with the
Yanks, and Rolph now coaching the
Yale baseball team.

ACCORDING TO A PUBLICITY
release from the Los Angeles Rams, i
Tom Harmon will be playing second
string when the season opens up ;
towards the end of this month.
We wonder if Harmon has seen
the release, for he's not the type to
play second string to anyone. He's !
either got to be the whole show or
else he doesn't play. He may have :
changed, but we wonder.
Of course, this could be just pub
licity, nothing more than that. Our j
guess is that he will play first string j
this year, or else Harmon will quit
when it comes time to renew his;
contract. The Rams realize the !
name Harmon is a drawing card and ;
will use it to advantage. Every j
publicity handout we have received j
has carried Harmon's name ever ]
since the Ram's signed him.
