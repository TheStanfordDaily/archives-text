# League 1 Whips Loop 2; Wild IE-PDK Game
## 
### GERRY HILL 
League I again dominated ti e win .
column in the mural playoffs as they I
; won 8-7, 9-6, and 8-5.
It took no bribing of jurors for i
the Legal Eagles to send the SON A j
I nine up for 99 years in the battle of j
j the champions as they won the case I
by eight counts while SONA re- I
i ceived acquittals on five other!
charges—in the language of the lay- .
man, 8-5.
The Eagles, well known for their >
diamond oratory, established the su- j
periority of League I over League II 1
without a doubt. The lawyers had
! the case easily in their hands 1
j throughout the game as Walt Chou
j teau's men had fun humiliating the 1
j Navy officers.
| In the wildest and most "goshaw- i
I ful" game ever played on a mural
diamond, Phi Delta Kappa man- j
! aged to edge out the "any thing-can
i happen" Encina IE team, 8-7, in a :
! screwball eight frames.
Encina's Bruce Worthington was
| unveiled for a second try and had
P.D.K. completely baffled for four
straight innings as Encina built up
! a 6-0 lead. The final three rounds
j resembled anything between a per
| petual debate and a football game.
In the fifth the educators picked
up one tally. Then, in the topsy
j turvy sixth, everything imaginable ,
happened — and even some things
not imaginable. With the score 6-3
j and. a man on second a P.D.K.-er
banged a single to center. The
; throw was whipped into and then i
j out of the infield as the catcher j
finally scooped up the spheroid on
the edge of the field in foul terri- 1
tory and tossed it to pitcher Wor- i
thington who punched the ball into
the midriff of the man coming home
on the single.
He was out or so everyone j
thought . . . but the ump ruled that '
the ball was dead because it had ;
gone into the bushes on the edge
of the field. The game was sus
pended for five minutes as Encina
attempted to discover why they had
not been told of this ground rule.
An enterprising educator tried to
steal home during the argument, [
; but he was sent back to third.
In the top half of the sixth, with j
the score a t 6-5, Dana Johnson ,
i slapped a homer into right center. J
| but as he walked away from tht* |
plate the catcher decided that may- i
be he had not tagged the platter and
the umpire ruled Johnson out. The j
game was suspended for another

five minutes.
Pat Lease, Dana Johnson, Mike 1
Schulman, and Doug Adams led the
game's hitting. P.D.K. hurler Bob
Brown was hit hard and his victory !
was only saved by several sensa- |
tional plays by his teammates.
T *
In a iess spectacular but just as j
well played game Sigma Nu easily j
triumphed over Encina IW, 9-6.
Herb Eggleston, the Bob Feller
from the house on the hill, was :
given good batting support by hLs
fellow murderers as practically ev
ery man on the squad picked up a
two-for-three batting record for the :
game.
In order to complete the schedule
as soon as possible, mural games
will be played next Monday, Tues- j
day, and Wednesday.

League I again dominated ti e win .
column in the mural playoffs as they I
; won 8-7, 9-6, and 8-5.
It took no bribing of jurors for i
the Legal Eagles to send the SON A j

j the champions as they won the case I
by eight counts while SONA re- I

charges—in the language of the lay- .
man, 8-5.
The Eagles, well known for their >
diamond oratory, established the su- j
periority of League I over League II 1
without a doubt. The lawyers had
! the case easily in their hands 1
j throughout the game as Walt Chou
j teau's men had fun humiliating the 1
j Navy officers.
| In the wildest and most "goshaw- i
I ful" game ever played on a mural
diamond, Phi Delta Kappa man- j
! aged to edge out the "any thing-can
i happen" Encina IE team, 8-7, in a :
! screwball eight frames.
Encina's Bruce Worthington was
| unveiled for a second try and had
P.D.K. completely baffled for four
straight innings as Encina built up
! a 6-0 lead. The final three rounds
j resembled anything between a per
| petual debate and a football game.
In the fifth the educators picked
up one tally. Then, in the topsy
j turvy sixth, everything imaginable ,
happened — and even some things
not imaginable. With the score 6-3
j and. a man on second a P.D.K.-er
banged a single to center. The
; throw was whipped into and then i
j out of the infield as the catcher j
finally scooped up the spheroid on
the edge of the field in foul terri- 1
tory and tossed it to pitcher Wor- i
thington who punched the ball into
the midriff of the man coming home
on the single.
He was out or so everyone j
thought . . . but the ump ruled that '
the ball was dead because it had ;
gone into the bushes on the edge
of the field. The game was sus
pended for five minutes as Encina
attempted to discover why they had
not been told of this ground rule.
An enterprising educator tried to
steal home during the argument, [
; but he was sent back to third.
In the top half of the sixth, with j
the score a t 6-5, Dana Johnson ,
i slapped a homer into right center. J
| but as he walked away from tht* |
plate the catcher decided that may- i
be he had not tagged the platter and
the umpire ruled Johnson out. The j
game was suspended for another

five minutes.
Pat Lease, Dana Johnson, Mike 1
Schulman, and Doug Adams led the
game's hitting. P.D.K. hurler Bob
Brown was hit hard and his victory !
was only saved by several sensa- |
tional plays by his teammates.
