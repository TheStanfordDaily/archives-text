# Excom Goes To The Village
## 
### JACKIE BOUCHER 
Single, double, and apartment
housing facilities, the kitchen, au
ditorium, and recreational facilities
at the village were inspected by
Excom members Wednesday after
noon.
The tour was conducted by
Dwight Adams, director of the
Stanford Village Housing Unit, and
Herbert J. Wunderlich, resident
counselor there.
Six wards will be converted into
dormitory style residences with
double-tiered bunks. The large
rooms are partitioned into eight sec
tions. each section holding eight
men.
IN ADDITION TO THESE wards,
converted barracks will house two
men in a room, which includes a
double-tiered bunk, wardrobe clos-

et, steel locker, and a desk.
Apartments for married students
fall into three classes: those with
two bedrooms, living room, bath,
and kitchen; with one bedroom and
the other three rooms; and with no
bedroom, where the living room will
be converted .for sleeping.
Cooking will be done on kero
sene stoves, and the furniture in
cludes a couch and two or three
chairs for the living room and es
sential furnishings in the other
rooms.
THE PASTEL-COLORED build
ings and inside walls bear little re
semblance to an army camp. Ex
com members reported, and the
buildings themselves are clean and
well painted.
A huge kitchen separates two
cafeteria-stvle dining rooms which
can serve approximately 2,000 por-

sons. Operation of the kitchen wi'l
be by the University, and the aim w
to have the best food at the lowest
possible expense, Adams said.
Behind the kitchen are a large
butcher shop and four huge refrig
erators, which can be regulated to
10 degrees below zero. A baker>
shop capable of providing for ;;
small village is also in this area.
RECREATIONAL FACILITIES
including the gym, theater, a 75-foot
pool, and tennis courts belong to
Menlo Park, but will be available to
Village residents.
However, a bowling alley wit/
three lanes does belong to the Uni
versity. Pessent plans call for stu
dent operation of it. Newly installed
this spring, the alley is decoratei
with colorful blue and red drapes.
