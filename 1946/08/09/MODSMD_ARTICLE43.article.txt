# Noon Classes Scheduled; Morning Labs This Fall
## 
### 
To alleviate the problems of classroom shortages and over
crowded dining halls the Administration decided yesterday to
schedule 12 o'clock classes Autumn quarter.
Since no new buildings will be constructed to handle next
quarter's bloated classes, the Administration hopes morning

labs, more afternoon classes, and the - "
addition of noon-hour classes will
serve to relieve the anticipated con
gestion of a 7.000-man Stanford.
Traffic problems, another of the.
University's growing pains, will be
partially solved by the construction
of several new parking lots by au
tumn quarter's opening. The new
lots will be "restricted" to faculty,
students living on campus, students
living off campus. Windshield stick
ers will designate which parking lots
each may use. Secondary solutions
to traffic troubles will be the en
forcement of 40-minute front curb
parking and a one-way Circle.
According to Orin Stevens, Di
rector of Information, new faculty
members are being added to the
staff as a part of the expansion pro
gram. "I don't know yet just how
many new men will be on the au
tumn quarter staff, but we are al
ready attempting to help 30 of them
secure housing," Stevens said yes
terday.
Explaining why he thought the
Bookstore's textbook congestion
would be somewhat bettered next
quarter, Dean Stalnaker said yester
day that he expected the tuition
raise to be an important determi- j
nant. "More veterans will find it i
necessary to make cash purchases
of books in order to make the most
of the school time due them under |
the G.I. Bill. Probably most veter
ans would rather buy tuition in
stead of books with their $500," the
Dean said. Veterans who would
rather buy books will be required
to fill out a new set of forms at the
opening of the quarter.
With these pending solutions to |
Stanford's pending expansion prob
lems came a host of new possibili- ,
ties. The increased demand for
books in the reserve book room may
be met by purchases of new books. ;
The question of installing a reserve
library at the Village has been left
hanging because of its expense.
Noon - hour classes would solve j
the large dining hall's problems dur- '
ing one meal a day. But continuous
operation of the Union in order to ]
facilitate hungry students was not
far off. With the lightened burden
for the big eating halls comes an
additional burden for eating clubs!
and the fraternities. Twenty stu- I
dents wandering in to eat at differ
ent hours might drive many a house
cook back down the highway. Stag
gered eating hours would be a boon
to Encina, but a thorn to Theta
Gamma Phew.

The question of installing a reserve
library at the Village has been left
hanging because of its expense.
Noon - hour classes would solve j
the large dining hall's problems dur- '
ing one meal a day. But continuous
operation of the Union in order to ]
facilitate hungry students was not
far off. With the lightened burden
for the big eating halls comes an
additional burden for eating clubs!
and the fraternities. Twenty stu- I
dents wandering in to eat at differ
ent hours might drive many a house
cook back down the highway. Stag
gered eating hours would be a boon
to Encina, but a thorn to Theta
Gamma Phew.
To alleviate the problems of classroom shortages and over
crowded dining halls the Administration decided yesterday to
schedule 12 o'clock classes Autumn quarter.
Since no new buildings will be constructed to handle next
quarter's bloated classes, the Administration hopes morning

labs, more afternoon classes, and the - "
addition of noon-hour classes will
serve to relieve the anticipated con
gestion of a 7.000-man Stanford.
Traffic problems, another of the.
University's growing pains, will be
partially solved by the construction
of several new parking lots by au
tumn quarter's opening. The new
lots will be "restricted" to faculty,
students living on campus, students
living off campus. Windshield stick
ers will designate which parking lots
each may use. Secondary solutions
to traffic troubles will be the en
forcement of 40-minute front curb
parking and a one-way Circle.
According to Orin Stevens, Di
rector of Information, new faculty
members are being added to the
staff as a part of the expansion pro
gram. "I don't know yet just how
many new men will be on the au
tumn quarter staff, but we are al
ready attempting to help 30 of them
secure housing," Stevens said yes
terday.
Explaining why he thought the
Bookstore's textbook congestion
would be somewhat bettered next
quarter, Dean Stalnaker said yester
day that he expected the tuition
raise to be an important determi- j
nant. "More veterans will find it i
necessary to make cash purchases
of books in order to make the most
of the school time due them under |
the G.I. Bill. Probably most veter
ans would rather buy tuition in
stead of books with their $500," the
Dean said. Veterans who would
rather buy books will be required
to fill out a new set of forms at the
opening of the quarter.
With these pending solutions to |
Stanford's pending expansion prob
lems came a host of new possibili- ,
ties. The increased demand for
books in the reserve book room may
be met by purchases of new books. ;
