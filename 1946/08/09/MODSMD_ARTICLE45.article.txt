Mountainous white wigs, gentle
men's coats of brilliant blue and
green, and huge ballooning 18th
century dresses will feature the cos
tuming of "The School for Scandal" j
when it appears on the stage of :
Memorial Hall next Thursday, Fri
day and Saturday.
The- costume and make-up classes
of the Speech and Drama Depart
ment under the direction of Mrs. â– 
Muriel Lievsay have created au- 1
thentic reproductions of the style I
of the 18th-century drawing room. :
CLAD IN TOWERING WHITE
wigs which will be hung with flow- '
ers, pearls and other decorations, the
female characters of Richard Slier- j
idan's famed comedy of manners |
and gossip will sport crescent, heart
and star-shaped velvet beauty spots,
and carry fans in the fshion of the
time.
The men of the cast, clad as 18th
century dandies, will be armed with
a collection of canes, muffs, and sil- j
ver snuff boxes. Their coats will
dazzle the eye with a brilliant va
riety of bright blues, greens and j
reds.
LONG FOLDS OF LACE WILL
flutter from their sleeve ends, and j
their heads will be covered with
white powdered wigs. Embroidery
will be an interesting feature of
their costumes. It will run in scrolls j
from their lapels to their coat ends.
"No effort has been spared to
make the costumes authentic," Mrs.
Lievsay said. " 'The School for
Scandal' will be the most colorful
production of this quarter."
"The School for Scandal" will be
the last production of summer quar- j
ter. Tickets are now on sale at the I
rear of Memorial Hall for 90 cents. '
All seats are reserved. Norman
Philbrick will direct the Stanford
Players production.
