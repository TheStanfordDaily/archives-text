# 'His Girl Friday' Is Sunday Movie
## 
### 
Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell
star in "His Girl Friday," to be ;
shown Sunday night at 7:15 in Me
morial Hall on the Sunday movie j
series.
"His Girl Friday" is the movie
remake of Ben Hecht and Charles
Mac Arthur's famous Broadway suc
cess "The Front Page," a wild and
raucous satire of the newspaper
profession and some of its hard
drinking characters.
DUE TO THE CINEMA'S CODE
of Decency some of thÂ° more lurid
situations and lines were cut from ;
the play before it was filmed. No- ;
tably emasculated was the famous j
curtain line concerning a stolen !
watch.
Also scheduled are the two latest
chapters of the summer cliff-hanger
''The Secret of Treasure Island," in
which Gwen Gaze is exposed to
more breath-taking peril.
