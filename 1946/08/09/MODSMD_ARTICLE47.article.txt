# Brahms Symphony Record Is Top Longhair Request
## 
### 
Brahms' "First Symphony," Rach
maninoff's "Second Piano Concerto,"
and "Rhapsody in Blue," by George
Gershwin, are the three selections
most often requested in the music
listening room in the Union, says
Bob Phillips, the man in charge of
the discs. Bob agrees, however,
that anything from Beethoven to
Wagner is also very popular.
Volunteers are needed to work
in the room as attendants from 1
until 5 p.m. Monday through Fri
day afternoons. Those persons who
are interested should contact Phil
lips as soon as possible.
There is a fine selection of clas
sical and semi-classical recordsâ€”
records of symphonies and concer
tos and also some popular light
opera selections. There are no jazz
records, however.
The listening room is open to all
students. Students may play their
own records or may have the at
tendants play selections for them.
