# Staff Solving "Village" Problems
## 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
Forty-five days remain before
Reg Day for fall quarter, and by
that time "Stanford Village" must
be ready for occupancy by a major
portion of its 2.700 vet population.
Throughout the summer, the ad
ministration, Stanford's student gov
ernment. and Leo Epp„ Inc., con
tractors assigned the task of pre
paring married vet apartments, have
been wrestling with the many prob
lems that became theirs when the
University acquired what was for
merly Dibble General Hospital.
THESE AGENCIES HAVE BEEN
aided and abetted by violent stu
dent controversy centered on Stan
ford Village and the turning over
of Branner Hall to women.
Many problems that at first ap
peared to be the most difficult have
already been solved.
Filing of a petition for a new bus
line to serve the Villas* bv the

Palo Alto City Linos may be the
answer to the transportation ques
tion.
ACCORDING TO WILLIAM IT.
Miller, University Director of Food
and Housing, arrangements have
been made for the operation of var
ious services, including a cleaning
and pressing establishment, barber
shop, soda fountain, general store,
and post office.
Dean of Students John M. Stal
naker has decided that assignment
of married veterans' quarters must
be made as soon as possible, and
his office is currently preparing to
poll the first five hundred families
on the list to ascertain changes in
their housing situation.
Few if any of the student or
ganizations on campus have made
adequate plans to include Village
residents in their respective activi
ties.

Bob Collins committee that such
affairs as Concert Series and Sun

ber of performances in older to
take care of the increased enroll

On the other hand, the problem of
incorporating the Village into stu
dent government has been given
the consideration it deserves, and,
while no definite solution has yet
been arrived at, it appears likely
that a workable system will be pre
pared for action by the student body
in the fall,
ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION AND
reconversion of the wards is pro
ceeding on schedule, handicapped
no more than had been expected by
labor and material shortages.
SEVERAL PROBLEMS STILL
remain unsettled — some because
they cannot be decided until a later
date, others because a satisfactory
solution has not vet been found.
