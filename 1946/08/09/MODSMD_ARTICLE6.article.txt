EXCOM 111
Excom's structure could be worked over and improved for
years on end and the resulting student government might still
be anemic.
Though it may sound like a bromide, Excom can be no better
than the talent and energy its elected members contribute to
their jobs. The urge and the ability to serve depends on sev
eral factors, some of which are within the power of the ASSU
Constitution to control.
If the student body at the polls elects a group of lemons
to Excom, no Consitiution in the world can make them into
diamonds.
But Excom itself can control its members if they become too
overactive, too much the Big Men On Campus type that have
time for nothing more than the weekly evening meeting.
No person should hold another student office and an Excom
seat at the same time. The latter is the most important job any
one can fill around here and, if it is handled correctly, it should
fill up the extra-curricular schedule of any student.
An incentive toward increasing the competition for Excom
seats among people with something between their ears would
be a system of University credit for full-time spent on the
student government job.
If Excom were a government, it follows that members could
learn enough practical politics and, with a bit of side reading,
learn enough constitutional procedure to rate a few Poli Sci
units.
To some people these pleas for more serious, full-time work
on Excom by its members may seem to be an acute case of
editor-with-nothing-else-to-f ill-space.
To others who realize our student government needs some
adrenalin, not because of any particular person but because of
its structure and because it has never been much more than a
"good activity," we hope these edits will be the ignition points
for some discussion and action.
We especially invite the attention of Martin Anderson and
Milly Edwards who next fall inherit 7,000 students and a pretty
sad government structure to use in their behalf.
