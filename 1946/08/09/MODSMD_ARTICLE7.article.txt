### 
ON MENTAL TELEPATHY
We had a big discussion the oth
er night with the landlady on
the subjects of mental telepathy,
thought transference and spiritual
ism.
The landlady swears that such

things not only
are possible,
they happen to
her all the
time.
"When I was
a little girl I
used to go
down to the
store for my
mother. She'd
tell me to get

a quarter's worth of potatoes.
When I got to the store I'd look
around, being curious," sho said.
"Sometimes my eye would light
on something—onions, for instance
—and a feeling would come over
me that would just make me go
buy a dime's worth.
"And when I got home my
mother would tell me that she'd
sent me the message to get those
onions."
About this time we broke in
momentiarily and suggested that
the landlady might have known
when she went to the store that
her mother was running low on
onions, but the idea was pooh
poohed.
Then the landlady took over
again.
"Why my mother was the rage
of San Francisco society for years.
She could look at you and toll you
what you were going to do, say
six months from now, and it al
ways came true, always. For years
here wasn't a party in one of
those big mansions up on top of
Nob Hill that was complete with
out her.
"She met all kinds of people up
there, famous people, and they
thought sho was wonderful."
The landlady said that she, too.
thought her mother was wonder

ful. We almost began to be con
vinced.
A few more concrete examples
by the landlady and we were con
vinced that all the psychologists
are wrong when they say that
such a thing had never been found
to be true.
They just hadn't asked the right
people, that's aJI.
They oughta ask our landlady.
Having been convinced, we
came out to the campus all set to
receive the waves that would make
us a mental telepathist.
We tried hard, but haven't had
any success yet.
A friend called three times one
day and came around to the house
twice to see if we wanted to drink
a few cokes with him that night.
All the time this was going on
we were right here in the Shack,
pounding out a term paper.
But no waves.
Another time one of our cous
ins called, called twice as a mat
ter of fact, to tip us off to a hot
item for the column.
Again, no waves.
Another time we got a long
distance call from the girl friend
up in the Sacramento Valley.
Now this, you would think,
would really cause a set of waves
that would wake us up.
But no waves.
Now we're all confused. The
landlady had us convinced at one
time, but now we're beginning to
swing back toward the scientists.
