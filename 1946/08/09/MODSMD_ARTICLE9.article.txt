Stanford Daily compositor for
eight years or more, and inciden
tally one of the most competent
linotype operators ever to invade
these parts, was genial LaVerne
Batman, terror of Bull Sessioners
and Frank Sinatra of th.e back
shop.
Describing himself as "a night
blooming cereal," often at mid
night's eerie hour he would lift up
his operatic voice "in profuse
streams of unpremeditated art."
During his long incumbency at the
linotype keyboard generations of
feminine members of the Daily
staff found their presence impera
tively required at frequent inter
vals in the back shop.
BEHIND A BROAD AND pen
sive brow LaVerne concealed a
curious and sometimes elephan
tine humor. Occasionally it back
fired, as when he surreptitiously
rubbed a bit of limburger cheese
on the bank boy's apron and
thereby — working beside him all
through the night—gave his own
nose great indignation.
In the years before the war the
bank boy was a Stanford student,
employed for four to six hours
every night to help around the
shop. Batman carried on a friend
ly feud with a long succession of
these hapless wights. But there
was one whom he left strictly
alone. This boy, an Encina resi
dent, one night cut through the
floor of his room, installed an in
terceptor in the lighting circuit
which at regular intervals plunged
the room below into darkness, and
then, by the time the baffled in
mate of the lower chamber had
located an electrician, had the in
terceptor out and all traces of the
misdemeanor concealed.
What Batman sometimes did to
copy shouldn't have happened to a
Bull Sessioner. Sometimes his tal
ent overflowed into the news col
umns. In the earlier years of the
war a bomb exploded in the fa
mous Nuernberg beer cellar a few
minutes after Der Fuehrer had
finished his speech and left. Bat
man picked up a standing head
and put it over this item —' Butch
of the Week."
BACK IN THE INTERVAL be
tween the wars, when the Stan
ford Rough was a still extant
though vanishing species, the an
nual Pajamarino traditionally end
ed in an attempted mass invasion
of a Palo Alto movie house. On
one occasion, some ten years ago,
in the ensuing riot the local gen
darmerie were liberally pelted
with tomatoes.
An enterprising Daily photogra
pher flashed a picture of the scene,
which the Palo Alto constabulary
emphatically did not want publi
cized. While the discussion rag*d
in the Daily Shack—to print or
not to print—Batman slipped out
to the back shop telephone—in full
view of the Shack through a couple
of windows — and, representing
himself as the Palo Alto City At
torney. threatened to jail the edi
tor if that picture appeared.
Whereupon Editor Irvin Jorgen
sen put through a long-distance
call to his father, Superior Court
judge down in Salinas, to find out
if they could do that to him.
BATMAN LEFT THE DAILY
in 1942 and is now publisher of a
weekly newspaper at Niles across
the Bay, where he is well on the
way to becoming the William Al
len White of Washington Town
ship. The Register is an excellent
piece of journalism, maintaining a
literary Standard that it would be
hard to equal in a country news
paper anywhere.
Not long ago he turned down a
column that his wife had written
for the paper, Not discouraged,
Mrs. Batman sold it to the Satur
day Evening Post.
' Butch of the year!"
