The rule requiring a two-thirds
vote in committees and in plenary
session for effective recommenda
tions of the Paris peace confer
ence was finally adopted. The
third week of the conclave, which
so far has not even organized
committees on the various trea
ties, promises only another battle
for the American delegation.
The Paris newspapers are full

of a proposition,
supposed to be
sponsored by the
delegations rep
resenting France
and some of the
smaller nations,
that the confer
ence adjourn in
early September
so that delegates
may attend the

U.N. Assembly meeting in New
York in that month. The peace
conference would not reconvene
then until January.
The hope of the U.S. in press
ing for an early peace conference
and early treaties with the satellite
nations was to restore some shreds
of "normalcy" to the shattered Eu
ropean continent, and to pave the
way for some more settled and sat
isfactory arrangement or treaty on
Germany. Secretary Byrnes is
pressing for further postponement
of the U.N. Assembly meeting, al
though Secretary-General Lie an
nounced that there would be no
further postponements.
The nations reported to be be
hind the move to adjourn the
conference apparently feel that no
progress has been made, that none
will be made, and that everyone had
better go home and think it over for
a few months, hoping perhaps that
events will solve their many prob
lems. Russia has not yet expressed
herself on the adjournment move,
but, intending neither to praise nor
to blame, it appears to me that So
viet policy would favor a continu
ation of the present armistice-and
occupation status rather than the
speedy conclusion of treaties which
would re-establish the Axis satel
lites as nations.
Saturday, Gen. Marshall and
Ambassador Stuart issued a state
ment from Peiping that the case
for peace in China was hopeless,
as agreement between the Com
munists and the Nationalists could
not he reached. Yesterday, a Chi
nese government newspaper ap
pealed to them not to abandon
their mission. Nanking sources
are reported as considering the
statement as an ultimatum from
the U.S. envoys to the warring
parties to come to terms. Mean
while, there are rumors again that
the U.S. Marines are to be with
drawn from China, although ear
lier rumors to this effect were de
nied by the commanding general.

committees on the various trea
ties, promises only another battle
for the American delegation.
The Paris newspapers are full

of a proposition,
supposed to be
sponsored by the
delegations rep
resenting France
and some of the
smaller nations,
that the confer
ence adjourn in
early September
so that delegates
may attend the

U.N. Assembly meeting in New
York in that month. The peace
conference would not reconvene
then until January.
The hope of the U.S. in press
ing for an early peace conference
and early treaties with the satellite
nations was to restore some shreds
of "normalcy" to the shattered Eu
ropean continent, and to pave the
way for some more settled and sat
isfactory arrangement or treaty on
Germany. Secretary Byrnes is
pressing for further postponement
of the U.N. Assembly meeting, al
though Secretary-General Lie an
nounced that there would be no
further postponements.
The nations reported to be be
hind the move to adjourn the
conference apparently feel that no
progress has been made, that none
will be made, and that everyone had
better go home and think it over for
a few months, hoping perhaps that
events will solve their many prob
lems. Russia has not yet expressed
herself on the adjournment move,
but, intending neither to praise nor
to blame, it appears to me that So
viet policy would favor a continu
ation of the present armistice-and
occupation status rather than the
speedy conclusion of treaties which
would re-establish the Axis satel
lites as nations.
Saturday, Gen. Marshall and
Ambassador Stuart issued a state
ment from Peiping that the case
for peace in China was hopeless,
as agreement between the Com
munists and the Nationalists could
not he reached. Yesterday, a Chi
nese government newspaper ap
pealed to them not to abandon
their mission. Nanking sources
are reported as considering the
statement as an ultimatum from
the U.S. envoys to the warring
parties to come to terms. Mean
while, there are rumors again that
the U.S. Marines are to be with
drawn from China, although ear
lier rumors to this effect were de
nied by the commanding general.

The rule requiring a two-thirds
vote in committees and in plenary
session for effective recommenda
tions of the Paris peace confer
ence was finally adopted. The
third week of the conclave, which
so far has not even organized
committees on the various trea
ties, promises only another battle
for the American delegation.
