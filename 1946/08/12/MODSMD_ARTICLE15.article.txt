THE NEW STANFORD
Stanford men returning from the service have expressed
varying degrees of distress at the changes they find in their
university.
Some of these changes such as the housing shortage and
the tuition raises are demonstrably the results of war and are
the fault of no person or group.
Other changes, many of them under the surface and not
apparent to anyone who is new to Stanford, are even more dis
tressing and call for a redefinition of the Stanford spirit and a
new dedication on the part of both faculty and students to the
principles of that spirit.
Some of the changes which disturb us most are these:
A collapse of the Honor Code to a position where it is
partially enforced more through inertia than any conviction as
r o its fundamental necessity for Stanford;
A hazy stand by the administration on its belief in the student
body's ability to shape its own standards of conduct to conform
to Stanford standards; some administrators favor overloading
students with responsibilities, and others frankly think faculty
controls over students are too lax;
A trend on the part of the students to blindly distrust ad
ministration moves as coming from a source intent on miserly
•oppression;
An overall tendency on the part of members of the university
'to tear down their school. Too many people quickly listen to
the "going to the dogs" message of a minority group of vocal
malcontents, while they turn their back on calls for loyalty
'to the school.
Of course a great part of all these changes are what one
faculty member terms the "Golden Age" myth. Returning
students throw a halo around their prewar years here and
proceed to drum an elegy for the dear dead days.
Similarity, faculty and administration members sometimes
defend a course of action on the ground that students have
changed and accept lower standards of personal conduct than
their predecessors.
Our own analysis starts with an attempt to put our thumb on
a "spirit" that was the best part of the Stanford we knew be
fore the war.
According to our memory, and it's prejudiced as much as
yours, Stanford at that time placed a worthwhile emphasis on
individualism and upon the self-written codes of conduct of
students.
This code or "Spirit" of conduct might have seemed para
doxical to a newcomer.
It authorized a necessary waterbag in Encina or a rowdy
song at a fraternity table. It didn't demand "coats and ties"
approach to campus life.
At the same time it emphasized an extreme loyalty to Stan
ford, and a code of absolute personal honesty under the Honor
Code where it applied. It resulted in a high code of moral
standards.
Stanford was, and we hope will always be, remarkably free
Df any dirty laundry.
In a series of edits we're going to try to define this spirit
more fully for the benefit of those who are new to Stanford
and its ways.
And we have some ideas in mind which can be put into effect
next fall when 7,000 students will make it harder than ever for
administration and student body to maintain a warm, personal
relationship.
For we feel that the train is about to derail. The mutual trust
between members of the Stanford family which we knew, and
around which we put a very shining halo, is seriously strained.

Similarity, faculty and administration members sometimes
defend a course of action on the ground that students have
changed and accept lower standards of personal conduct than
their predecessors.
Our own analysis starts with an attempt to put our thumb on
a "spirit" that was the best part of the Stanford we knew be
fore the war.
According to our memory, and it's prejudiced as much as
yours, Stanford at that time placed a worthwhile emphasis on
individualism and upon the self-written codes of conduct of
students.
This code or "Spirit" of conduct might have seemed para
doxical to a newcomer.
It authorized a necessary waterbag in Encina or a rowdy
song at a fraternity table. It didn't demand "coats and ties"
approach to campus life.
At the same time it emphasized an extreme loyalty to Stan
ford, and a code of absolute personal honesty under the Honor
Code where it applied. It resulted in a high code of moral
standards.
Stanford was, and we hope will always be, remarkably free
Df any dirty laundry.
In a series of edits we're going to try to define this spirit
more fully for the benefit of those who are new to Stanford
and its ways.
And we have some ideas in mind which can be put into effect
next fall when 7,000 students will make it harder than ever for
administration and student body to maintain a warm, personal
relationship.
For we feel that the train is about to derail. The mutual trust
between members of the Stanford family which we knew, and
around which we put a very shining halo, is seriously strained.
THE NEW STANFORD
Stanford men returning from the service have expressed
varying degrees of distress at the changes they find in their
university.
Some of these changes such as the housing shortage and
the tuition raises are demonstrably the results of war and are
the fault of no person or group.
Other changes, many of them under the surface and not
apparent to anyone who is new to Stanford, are even more dis
tressing and call for a redefinition of the Stanford spirit and a
new dedication on the part of both faculty and students to the
principles of that spirit.
Some of the changes which disturb us most are these:
A collapse of the Honor Code to a position where it is
partially enforced more through inertia than any conviction as
r o its fundamental necessity for Stanford;
A hazy stand by the administration on its belief in the student
body's ability to shape its own standards of conduct to conform
to Stanford standards; some administrators favor overloading
students with responsibilities, and others frankly think faculty
controls over students are too lax;
A trend on the part of the students to blindly distrust ad
ministration moves as coming from a source intent on miserly
•oppression;
An overall tendency on the part of members of the university
'to tear down their school. Too many people quickly listen to
the "going to the dogs" message of a minority group of vocal
malcontents, while they turn their back on calls for loyalty
'to the school.
Of course a great part of all these changes are what one
faculty member terms the "Golden Age" myth. Returning
students throw a halo around their prewar years here and
proceed to drum an elegy for the dear dead days.
