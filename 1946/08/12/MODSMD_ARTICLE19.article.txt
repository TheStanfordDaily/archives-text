The Editor, Sir:
I wish to thank you and through you the various University
officials who made possible the publication of the answers to
certain questions (concerning veterans) which I had suggested
you look into.
I know that the mere fact that my questions were answered
must be quite a surprise to a number of people who assured me
no information would be forthcoming. Contrary to their belief,
the University proves to be pleasingly cooperative.
The answers dispelled some of the worst rumors which are
so often repeated. Although some may disagree with the
policy of the University brought to our attention in the answers,
I am sure that anybody who gives the matter more than super
ficial thought will agree that the University officials are doing
their utmost to find the most suitable solutions of the various

problems confronting it. Obvious
ly, everybody cannot be pleased.
Perhaps the most important
point brought to light by my let
ter and its answer is that the sto
ries of inequity so often repeated
are largely exaggerated, unfound
ed rumors. If the people who take
the trouble to repeat them will
first take the trouble to inquire
into their validity (which I have
shown can be done at Stanford),
both they and their listeners will
be rid of some very disquieting
thoughts.
Vei'y truly yours,
