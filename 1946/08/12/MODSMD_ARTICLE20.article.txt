## Bull Session 
### 
A bunch of the rugged engineers
were up in the hills back of the
Quad the other day, surveying a
hill that had been surveyed prob-

ably 5000 times
around the hill,
cow top |kml
the striped stick the boys were
taking leadings on.

The cow lay down.
The engineers came up and tried !
to get her to move.
They pulled at her horns.
They threw clods at her.
They yelled.
They cussed.
The cow didn't move.
The engineers then got a nature
lesson.
The cow gave birth to a calf. !

Stanford Village won out over '
our suggestion — Wilbur Hall — in
the Dibble name contest.
Some people wanted to know j
the reason back of our suggestion. [
In the first place, Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur gave many years of
service to Stanford, first as the
Dean of Medicine and later as
President of the institution. Along j
with his high place in the medical
world and his service as Secretary
of the Interior, he focused a great
deal of favorable attention on the
University.
Dr. Wilbur is the only past Pres
ident of Stanford who does not
have some campus building named
for him. We have Jordan and
Brenner Halls, but no Wilbur Hall, i
In the second place—this is pure
ly a personal reason and not one
which the committee was expect
ed to have taken any notice of—
the Bawlout lists the name as
Robert Wilbur Chandler.
(Editor's note: It might be ex
plained that the selection com
mittee in the Stanford Village
Name Contest refused any name
connected with a person because
the buildings are scheduled to be
torn down when the veterans are
done with them. The judges felt,
therefore, that this wmdd not be
a lasting tribute.)
