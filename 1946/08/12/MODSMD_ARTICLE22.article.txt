Tami Muriello starts heavy train
ing this week for his world cham
pionship bout with Joe Louis in
September. They say that Tami has
never been k.o.ed in his ring his
tory. There is always a first time,
and Joe will prove that next month.
It is too bad that there are none j
worthy to fight Louis for the title
today. With due credit to Louis, we
think it would help boxing if he i
were to retire after this bout and
let the title be decided in an elimi
nation tournament.
There is not a challenger today
who could give Louis a good fight,
whereas an elimination tournament
would result in some good bouts
that would help do away with the
stink connected with the Louis-
Conn fiasco.

THE STORY OUT OF Hollywood
is that Buck Faucett resigned as j
playing-manager and Jimmy Dykes |
was appointed to take his place. :
Were the truth told, however. Ii
think the story would actually read j
that Faucett was asked to resign or i
else face the alternative of being j
fired.
The easing out of Faucett after he
had brought the Stars out of the
cellar to fifth place brings to mind
the ousting of Mary Shea as man
ager of the Portland Beavers at the
close of the 1943 season after bring
ing a cellar team into fourth place.
We claim that Faucett was a suc
cessful manager in movie town for
bringing the club as high as he did.
We can't see where the club will be j
improved by bringing in a perennial ,
second division manager to take J
over the team.
We saw a Dykes managed club
at the beginning of the major league
season in Chicago, and it was not
burning up the league. In over ten
years of major league managing, l
Dykes has yet to produce a winning j
team. There is no indication that
his ways will be changed here.

LARRY JANSEN'S STRING OF
wins has now reached an even dozen j
and shows no sign of faltering. His
last win, a shut-out, indicates that.
Jansen has only seven more wins
to go to reach the thirty mark.
Another Seal, Sal Taormina,
should be playing major league ball j
in 1948. After recovering from stage |
fright at the beginning of the sea- |
son, Taormina has been one of the
big wheels in the Seals' pennant
drive. Another season of instruc
tion by Lefty O'Doul, one of base
ball's best teachers, and Sal will bo
ready for the big time.

808 ZUPPKE, FORMER Illinois
football coach, said the other day
that George McAfee of the Chicago
Bears is one of the five great backs j
of all times. While Zuppke's opin- j
ion must be respected, his remark j
must be taken with a grain of salt j
considering he has just signed with .
the Bears as advisory coach. Per- J
haps Zuppke should be appointed
publicity director of the outfit.

KING GUSTAV OF SWEDEN

siast and still plays the game.

think the story would actually read j
that Faucett was asked to resign or i

fired.
The easing out of Faucett after he
had brought the Stars out of the
cellar to fifth place brings to mind
the ousting of Mary Shea as man
ager of the Portland Beavers at the
close of the 1943 season after bring
ing a cellar team into fourth place.
We claim that Faucett was a suc
cessful manager in movie town for
bringing the club as high as he did.
We can't see where the club will be j
improved by bringing in a perennial ,
second division manager to take J
over the team.
We saw a Dykes managed club
at the beginning of the major league
season in Chicago, and it was not
burning up the league. In over ten
years of major league managing, l
Dykes has yet to produce a winning j
team. There is no indication that
his ways will be changed here.

Bears is one of the five great backs j

KING GUSTAV OF SWEDEN

month at Forest Hills. We doubt j
very much whether the 88-year-old !

Tami Muriello starts heavy train
ing this week for his world cham
pionship bout with Joe Louis in
September. They say that Tami has
never been k.o.ed in his ring his
tory. There is always a first time,
and Joe will prove that next month.
It is too bad that there are none j
worthy to fight Louis for the title
today. With due credit to Louis, we
think it would help boxing if he i
were to retire after this bout and
let the title be decided in an elimi
nation tournament.
There is not a challenger today
who could give Louis a good fight,
whereas an elimination tournament
would result in some good bouts
that would help do away with the
stink connected with the Louis-
Conn fiasco.
