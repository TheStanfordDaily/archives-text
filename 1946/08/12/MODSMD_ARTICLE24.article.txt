# Mural Softball Playoffs To Conclude This Week
## 
### 
With this week's nine games the
curtain will be drawn on the short I
but turbulent career of the Summer ;
Softball Intramurals.
When the murals opened on July
9, League I was composed of Encina
Cellar, Branner I. Legal Eagles. Phi
Psi, Sigma Nu, Phi Delta Kappa,
and Encina lE. At the same time
League II had SONA. Firehouse, Chi
Psi, Encina IW, Encina 3E. and P.E.
Dept.
BY THE END OF THE FIRST
week Branner, P.E. Dept., and En
cina 3E had dropped out. P.D.K. I
split into two teams, Encina IE
went over to League 11, and Delta
Upsilon joined League I.
In a rather unfortunate predic
tion, the Sideline Slanter picked
Encina Cellar to cop the League I |
championship, but the Cellarmen t
proceeded to lose all their games. I
THEN DELTA UPSILON IN j
League I and Chi Psi in League II !
both went ripping through their re
spective loops, only to meet defeat I
at the hands of old man forfeit for !
using ineligible players. SONA and
Legal Eagles managed to stagger )
into the not-so-select winners' cir- |
cle.
Also gaining the playoffs by the
forfeit or replay route were Sigma j
Nu, Phi Kappa I. Encina IW, and
Encina lE.
Most of the games were fairly
close, but the two biggest victories
were Firehouse 20-P.D.K. II 5, and
Encina IE 18-Firehouse 3.
SO FAR IN THE PLAYOFFS the i
League I entries have defeated their I
League II opponents in several wild ;
encounters.
In order to complete the schedule j
before finals, games will be played !
today, Tuesday, and Wednesday. I
From all appearances Legal Eagles j
and Sigma Nu should hold the top ,
spots, but anything can happen in ,
the murals—and anything will.
