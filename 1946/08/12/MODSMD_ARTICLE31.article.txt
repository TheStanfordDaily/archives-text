# Veterans Can't Afford New Housing
## 
### 
The people of the United States
have shown little more intelligence
in meeting the current housing
problem than they did in a similar
situation after the first World War.
This opinion was expressed by
Frank W. Rose, deputy regional di
rector of the Federal Public Hous
ing Authority, in a talk Saturday
before 100 California civic leaders
attending Stanford University's sec
ond Workshop on Community Lead
ership.
"MOST OF WHAT WE HAVE
done in public housing has been to
sure past evils," he declared. "It's
time to begin thinking in preventive
terms. Sound planning at the out
set will prevent future blighted
areas."
The present housing crisis, he
said, can best be indicated in terms
of its application to veterans. Only
.14 per cent of all veterans who
need housing can afford to pay
more than $50 per month to buy,
whereas 84 per cent of building ap

plications in California for the first
six months of this year were for
houses that will cost more than that.
SIMILARLY, ONLY 11 PER
cent of the veterans can afford to
| pay more than $50 per month ren
| tal, while 55 per cent of the appli
j cations for rental housing will re
j quire a monthly rental in excess of
j $50, he said.
"Private industry simply cannot
! afford to build housing for these
| lower income groups," he said. "If
; we are going to achieve a better
! balance between demand and sup
| ply, private enterprise must be
| given greater incentive."
This can be accomplished, he said,
j through government subsidies in
the same way that other public
! problems, too big for private en
j terprise to tackle alone, have been
solved throughout our history
through public subsidy for public
I good.
AT THE PRESENT TIME, how
] ever, we are yielding to tremen

dous pressures to create new sub
divisions and to build any kind of
shelter that can be thrown up, he
declared. In a few years a new
group of blighted areas will be the
result.
Communities have a big stake in
preventing such areas, he said.
Only one reason is that the tax yield
! from such areas is always far less
than the cost of municipal services
in the areas.-
Mr. Rose stated that 4.000,000 U.S.
families will require housing by the
end of 1947. In contrast, the nation
1 in its best previous building year
; (1925) produced only a little more
than 900,000 dwellings. And for the
ten years 1947-57, he said, we will
; need 1,200,000 new houses each year.
The Wagner-Ellender-Taft hous
ing bill, which failed to pass at the
| recent session of Congress but
I which he hopes will pass early in
! the next session, provides a com
] prehensive plan for tackling the na
! tion's housing problem, he said.
