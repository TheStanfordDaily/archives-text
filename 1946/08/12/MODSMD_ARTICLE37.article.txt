# Locals Act In Mozart Opera
## 
### 
Mozart's opera, "Cosi Fan Tutte,"
to be performed at the Montalvo
Foundation this Saturday and Sun
clay, will have several members of
the Stanford student body and fac
ulty in the cast.
Dr. Jan Popper of the Stanford
Music Department will direct the
music.
THE HOLE OF DON ALFONSO,
leading character in the opera, who,
contends that no woman lives who
will always be faithful, will be por
trayed by Joel Carter, Stanford as
sistant instructor in music.
The Neapolitan characters who
aid the cynical Alfonso to present
his beliefs and problems will be
played by singers well known to
Stanford students.
The roles of petite Fiordiligi and
stately Dorabella, two ladies who
swear to be true, are sung by Lois
Hartzell and Beta Popper, wife of
Dr. Popper.
THEIR LOVERS ARE Ferrando
and Guglielmo, played by James
Schwabacher and Ted Uppman.
Malcontent and versatile Despina,
who thickens the plot, is played by
Marjorie Dickinson.
