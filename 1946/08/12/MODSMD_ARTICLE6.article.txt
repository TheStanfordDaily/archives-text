# ‘Europe’ Is Heffner Topic
## 
### 
"Our Commitments in Europe"
will be the timely topic of Hubert C.
HefTner, executive head of the De
partment of Speech and Drama, and
professor of dramatic literature, at
the Tuesday Evening Series tomor
row night in the auditorium of Me
morial Hall. The public is invited.
Professor HefTner will discuss the
European situation as he observed
it. In speaking of Germany, he will
tell of the people and their bombed
out cities, their destroyed indus
tries, and what they are up against.
HE WILL DO THE SAME THING
for France but will also discuss the
political situation of that country.
His discussion will be an effort to
show our commitments in Europe,
why it is necessary to understand
what is going on so that we will
know what policy our government
should pursue.
"We are one of the two major
powers," Mr. Heffner observes, "and
our position is precarious. If we do
not understand Europe's problems,
our commitments there, and act
wisely, we will be responsible for
the third world war."
PROFESSOR HEFFNER'S knowl
edge of his subject was gained first
hand. He was chief of the fine arts
section, American University of
Biarritz, in Europe, July 1945 to
July 194G.
Following his work at Birritz, he
went to Germany with the Infor
mation and Education division. He
was subsequently loaned to the
Special Services division, the Mili
tary Government, and the War
Crimes Commission. His varied ac
tivities enabled him to form a wide
acquaintance with the problems he
will discuss tomorrow night.
