Its Something
To Write Home About
All Right!
rWIHE WAY Wilson's Southern
1 chef and staff of Southern
cooks prepare chicken or bake
ham, "do up"' a juicy steak, concoct
soups, toss salads, and bake those
wonderful hot biscuits (served with
butter and honey) is "something to
write home about"!
And that's just what Stanford
students have been doing for years
and years and years. And many,
many of Stanford's families come to
Wilson's for dinner when they are
visiting their Stanford student off
spring.
Next time you want a delicious
dinner with visiting relatives, bring
them to Wilson's.
