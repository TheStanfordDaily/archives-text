PARTING SHOTS I
In Monday's Daily we noted our conviction that Stanford's
Honor Code has slipped to a point where it is loosely enforced
because it has always been around, not because a majority of
the faculty and students have any strong convictions as to its
worth.
The Honor Code is worth keeping. It did away with a great
many nuisances of university life because of the trust it in
spired. Students under it are treated as trusted adults. Such
treatment is a very desirable psychological background for the
acquiring of an education.
Certainly there were infractions. Stanford gets a cross
section of humans as well as any other institution. We had our
cheaters and phonies and smart guys.
But at the peak of Honor Code strength these characters
were handled by their fellow students through student gov
ernment. It was a matter of pride and an actual source of
strength to students to realize that the university trusted them
to keep the school clean.
Next fall more than 2,000 people are coming to this school
who will sign their Honor Code pledges without knowing or
caring about their responsibilities. Crowded classes and tired
professors will make evasion of the Code easy, unless remedial
measures are thought out now.
The Daily recommends to Excom the appointment of an
interim faculty-student committee to plan a program of pub
licity about the Code.
It is not enough that Pre-Reg committee, saddled with other
responsibilities, gives a few talks and pass out some booklets.
A coordinated publicity campaign utilizing every channel of
public relations on the campus must be blueprinted now for
use fall quarter.
To fall-quarter Excom we suggest the appointment of a
permanent 1946-47 Honor Code Board composed of both faculty
and student members. All work in connection with protection of
the code should pass to this board.
It should have the power to alter enforcement procedures.
Its faculty section should see to it that every professor once a
quarter discusses the Code with each class and outlines en
forcement procedures.
Finally, Men's and Women's Council should seriously con
sider upping the scale of penalties for Code violations and
giving full publicity to trial proceedings.
