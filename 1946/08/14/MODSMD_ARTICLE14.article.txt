ON FRATERNITIES
On April 26. 1944. a meeting of
all University women was held, a
meeting at which Dr. Tresidder
announced a decision had been
reached by the Board of Trustees
to abolish the Stanford chapters of
Greek letter sororities.
We weren't here at the time,

being preoccu
pied with oth
er things, but
we think it
was a fine idea.
We promised
at the start of
this stint there
would not be
any big cam
paigns this
quarter. We

hereby take back that promise, and
warn you to quit reading if you
don't like the idea.
We urge the abolition of frater
nity chapters on the Stanford cam
pus the same way the sororities
were abolished.
We think the good that is in fra
ternities is far overbalanced by
the harm they do.
On the good .side, fraternities
offer an aid to the University in
housing and feeding many men
vvho would otherwise have to go
o Stanford Village.
But that's about all we can say
tn favor of them.
On the other side, we think that
.raternities sponsor a feeling of
superiority on the part of their
members, a feeling of superiority
which might be all right in some
people, but too often is misplaced

in college freshmen and sopho
mores.
We think that fraternities would
be all right—on one condition, and
that is that enough fraternities be
established on the campus so that
every man who enters Stanford
would become a member. We
have no gripe against small living
groups, but believe those living
groups are no good when they are
so few that less than half of the
men students in the University
can be members.
The "holier than thou" attitude
sponsored by some of the "exclu
sive" fraternities has been dis
proved time and time by the ac
tions of their members.
Some of the biggest moral lep
ers we ever knew were members
of Stanford fraternities. Most of
their activities are unfit for print,
but many of you have heard the
stories and printing would be
mere repetition.
On the other hand, our best
friend here before the war was a
fraternity man, albeit not one of
the "exclusivity" boys. He got
knocked off in the South Pacific,
but in many bull sessions here be
fore each of us parted to go his
respective way he admitted that
the only real good in fraternities
as he saw it was the advantage of
living in a small group.
The housing situation here on
campus would be much better off
with the fraternities again under
control of the administration as
they were during the war. It
seems a great injustice to us that
students with ''influence" in the
"right places" should live in nice
houses on the campus while others
are forced into Stanford Villag".
which although not as bad as it

has been painted still is definitely
second choice.
Recently one of the "exclusiv
ity" members of one of the tongs
returned to the campus. Now this
fellow—we knew him before the
war — had about as many moral
lapses as anyone we have ever
known.
On his return he discovered that
his tong during the war had
pledged a man of another race.
He raised so much hell that all of
the men who had been pledged by
that particular fraternity during
the war resigned rather than ask
the one pledge to resign.
That man was certainly keeping
up the exclusive traditions of his
group in the best possible fashion.
His motives —whatever they may
have been — certainly leave
something to question.
He deserves a lot of credit.
Nuts.

But that's about all we can say
tn favor of them.
On the other side, we think that
.raternities sponsor a feeling of
superiority on the part of their
members, a feeling of superiority
which might be all right in some
people, but too often is misplaced

in college freshmen and sopho
mores.
We think that fraternities would
be all right—on one condition, and
that is that enough fraternities be
established on the campus so that
every man who enters Stanford
would become a member. We
have no gripe against small living
groups, but believe those living
groups are no good when they are
so few that less than half of the
men students in the University
can be members.
The "holier than thou" attitude
sponsored by some of the "exclu
sive" fraternities has been dis
proved time and time by the ac
tions of their members.
Some of the biggest moral lep
ers we ever knew were members
of Stanford fraternities. Most of
their activities are unfit for print,
but many of you have heard the
stories and printing would be
mere repetition.
On the other hand, our best
friend here before the war was a
fraternity man, albeit not one of
the "exclusivity" boys. He got
knocked off in the South Pacific,
but in many bull sessions here be
fore each of us parted to go his
respective way he admitted that
the only real good in fraternities
as he saw it was the advantage of
living in a small group.
The housing situation here on
campus would be much better off
with the fraternities again under
control of the administration as
they were during the war. It
seems a great injustice to us that
students with ''influence" in the
"right places" should live in nice
houses on the campus while others
are forced into Stanford Villag".
which although not as bad as it

has been painted still is definitely
second choice.
Recently one of the "exclusiv
ity" members of one of the tongs
returned to the campus. Now this
fellow—we knew him before the
war — had about as many moral
lapses as anyone we have ever
known.
On his return he discovered that
his tong during the war had
pledged a man of another race.
He raised so much hell that all of
the men who had been pledged by
that particular fraternity during
the war resigned rather than ask
the one pledge to resign.
That man was certainly keeping
up the exclusive traditions of his
group in the best possible fashion.
His motives —whatever they may
have been — certainly leave
something to question.
He deserves a lot of credit.
