In the past, Michigan and Ohio
late have played in the Rose Bowl,
ther conference teams have been
ivited but not permitted to make
le trip due to conference pressure.
Minnesota, Michigan, Northwest
n, Ohio State, and Wisconsin are

ice opponents either this season or
xt. That does not mean that these
hools are in favor of a post-season
»reement.
As much as an agreement be

e do not look for any such action
the next few years. The Big Nine
is shown disapproval of such post

, with Ben Hogan, this year's
p money winner, the favorite to
Id this tournament to this year's
ne other wins.
While Hogan has always been our

trren in the Hale America in Chi
g°-
With so many pros entered, it's
ugh to pick the winner, but the
inner will not be the favorite.
Is worth Vines has been
od golf lately, and we look for
in to be among the top five.
Primo Camera has been denied a
i rmit to wrestle in this state pend
ig an investigation of his war rec
rd. He was to have made his first
ate appearance in Los Angeles this
vening.
The fact that Primo is alive and
■ell should prove his collaboration
ith the Germans. Regardless of
lis, however, he should have been
itified, before he had made plans,
lathe would have to show proof
112 his anti - German sympathies,
dy to California is a long trip.
The result of the investigation will
lost likely result in a whitewash ot
ai iera allowing him to wrestle,
e're anxious to see Camera in
tion.
