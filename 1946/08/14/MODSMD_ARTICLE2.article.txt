## 
### 
Approval of the Palo Alto City
Lines' petition to run buses directly
from the Village to the University
has been granted by the California
Railroad Commission, Manager W.
B. Prine announced yesterday.
The franchise okays the running
of buses on El Camino from Santa
Cruz Avenue to Palm Drive, from
where they will run over thorough
fares already granted to the bus
line.
STILL PENDING BEFORE THE
Commission is a request for a seven
cents fare for all bona fide Stanford
students.
As yet, no schedule between the
Village and the campus has been
drawn up, Mr. Prine stated, and it is
likely that none will be drawn up
until at least the second week of
school when the company can de
cide what its peak bus load hours
will be.
THE COMPANY PLANS TO run
buses the first week in batches of
about five or six just prior to the
hourly class sessions, and is con
templating plans for the evening
shift. Another problem, as yet un
solved, is whether or not the stu
dents living at the Village will eat
their noon meal at the Village. In
that event, the company must pro
vide buses also at the noon hour.
