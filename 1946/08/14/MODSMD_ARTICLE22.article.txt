# Legal Eagles One Game To Go; SONA. Drops Out
## 
### 
The Legal Eagles remained un-H
defeated in playoff games as they
dumped Sigma Nu, 9-6, on Monday,
and romped over Phi Delta Kappa, '
11-6, the following afternoon.
The jurists racked up an early
lead against Sigma Nu as they held
down a rally by Herb Eggleston's ,
men from the hill. S.N. had been !
considered the only possible stum
bling block to the lawyers' cham- j
pionship ambitions.
Walt Chouteau's attorneys then
proceeded to knock around the [
slightly slap-happy P.D.K.'s, 11-6, j
in a seven-frame wild west show, j
With Bob Brown on the mound
for the educators, P.D.K. blew the i
game in the first couple of innings !
to leave the Eagles' record unblem- j
ished. Despite the fact that errors j
helped them considerably, the "fu
ture Jerry Geislers" earned their i
fourth straight victory.
It took a four-bagger with one
man aboard in the last inning by j
"Battling Bill" Daley for Encina 1W
to flunk the Phi Delta Kappa edu
cators, 9-7.
Daley completed a Western Civ
exam just in time to enter the game j
and belt the homer for the Eniinans.
In this ever-so-close ball game
the winning flinger was Put Patton, j
lW's "Eophus ball" artist. The los
ing tosser was Bob "Blooperball" j
Brown.
Encina 1W then proceeded to edge !
their arch-rivals, Encina lE, 6-5 in j
an extremely tight ball game.
Both Pat Patton of 1W and
"Lefty" Bruce Worthington of IE
had lots of control on the ball, but J
close plays and freak hits by both
clubs upset the best that both pitch
ers could offer.
1W took a second-inning one
tally lead and were ahead 6-3 going
into the seventh. Patton quelled a
two-run splurge in the last frame to
save the game.

The game's batting leaders were
Gene Mathias and Bill Daley of IW.
and Dana Johnson for lE.
The SONA ball club has dropped
out of the playoffs forfeiting Mon
day's game to Encina lE, Tuesday's
to Sigma Nu, and today's to IW.
According to Lt. Com. K. F. Oer
lein. Navy manager, injuries and
new assignments decimated the team
until it is almost impossible to field
a squad.

fourth straight victory.
It took a four-bagger with one
man aboard in the last inning by j
"Battling Bill" Daley for Encina 1W
to flunk the Phi Delta Kappa edu
cators, 9-7.
Daley completed a Western Civ
exam just in time to enter the game j
and belt the homer for the Eniinans.
In this ever-so-close ball game
the winning flinger was Put Patton, j
lW's "Eophus ball" artist. The los
ing tosser was Bob "Blooperball" j
Brown.
Encina 1W then proceeded to edge !
their arch-rivals, Encina lE, 6-5 in j
an extremely tight ball game.
Both Pat Patton of 1W and
"Lefty" Bruce Worthington of IE
had lots of control on the ball, but J
close plays and freak hits by both
clubs upset the best that both pitch
ers could offer.
1W took a second-inning one
tally lead and were ahead 6-3 going
into the seventh. Patton quelled a
two-run splurge in the last frame to
save the game.

The game's batting leaders were
Gene Mathias and Bill Daley of IW.
and Dana Johnson for lE.
