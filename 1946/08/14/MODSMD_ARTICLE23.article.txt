### GERRY HILL 
We're feeling rather sorry for the |
Seals' pride and joy, Larry Jansen.
Apparently by being sold to the
New York Giants Jansen is doomed
to the same fate that met former
S.F. wonderman Bob Joyce.
The Polo Grounds club, now rest
ing in a not very secure sixth place,
junked Joyce after he had started
his first season with three straight
wins.
UNLESS THE GIANTS LEARN
that rookies can win games and are |
not just for stocking farm clubs, |
Jansen will probably rot on the |
bench for a few months and then i
be back in the minors. Maybe the |
Giants should remember that it j
didn't take any farming out to make j
their manager, Mel Ott, a star when j
he was the ripe old age of 16.
Anyone who thinks that this sum- |
mer's murals are a little bit turbu- |
lent (a two-bit word picked up j
from Smiley Farkas) should listen j
to a saga of that umpire-lynching!
Florida League. Florida fans can't j
seem to get by without their week- j
ly riot.
