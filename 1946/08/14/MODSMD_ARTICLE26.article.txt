# Staff Works on Housing For Married Veterans

### DON CARLSON 
Dean Stalnaker makes no bones about it. "Oui Diggest prob
lem next quarter is going to be the housing ot married students.
We expect close to 50 per cent of the new vetetans enrolling at
Stanford will be married," the Dean said yesterday.
What Stanford can do to help the new married student find

a place to live remains the first item
of attention on the Dean's list. Re
quests for housing in the Dean's
office now number 1,439. But many
of the names on that list could be
removed now. It has been growing
since autumn quarter 1945.
A QUESTIONNAIRE TO deter
mine how many married students
on the list were still in need of a
room is all but ready to be mailed
from the Stalnaker office. When the
questionnaires are returned the Ex
com selections committee and the
Dean's office will have a more con
crete set of statistics to work with.
The situation grows more tense
as the prospect of having more than
88 apartments ready in the Village
by Sept. 20 grows less likely. The
Dean says, ". . . and we're not even
sure we'll have the 88 apartments
ready. But we're putting on all the
pressure we can."
AWAKE THAT THE Hid CRUSH
for those first apartments in the
Village would pose a special prob
lem of its own. tlie Dean yesterday
wrote off a letter to Excom recom
mending two men to the student
administrative committee. Excom
will have its share of the responsi
bility and the kickback, if there be
one, from those left out of the early
Village picture.
New' solutions to Stanford's now
old housing problems were not pok
ing their heads into the right places
yet. As a last resort it may be pos
sible to house 300 childless married
couples in the Village if those
couples are willing to forego the
comforts of home. Quick conversion
of six dormitories (former quarters
of nurses and officers) would yield
300 small room*. But there would
be no cooking, only a limited
amount of privacy.
Dormitory living for married stu
dents would be no rose, but it would
at least tide the University over un
til better accommodations could be
provided. Village couples so housed
" would have to eat in the community
dining hall, share shower and toilet
facilities with other doum residents.

lem of its own. tlie Dean yesterday
wrote off a letter to Excom recom

New' solutions to Stanford's now
old housing problems were not pok
ing their heads into the right places
yet. As a last resort it may be pos
sible to house 300 childless married
couples in the Village if those
couples are willing to forego the
comforts of home. Quick conversion
of six dormitories (former quarters
of nurses and officers) would yield
300 small room*. But there would
be no cooking, only a limited
amount of privacy.
Dormitory living for married stu
dents would be no rose, but it would
at least tide the University over un

provided. Village couples so housed

dining hall, share shower and toilet
facilities with other doum residents.
Dean Stalnaker makes no bones about it. "Oui Diggest prob
lem next quarter is going to be the housing ot married students.
We expect close to 50 per cent of the new vetetans enrolling at
Stanford will be married," the Dean said yesterday.
What Stanford can do to help the new married student find

a place to live remains the first item
of attention on the Dean's list. Re
quests for housing in the Dean's
office now number 1,439. But many
of the names on that list could be
removed now. It has been growing
since autumn quarter 1945.
A QUESTIONNAIRE TO deter
mine how many married students
on the list were still in need of a
room is all but ready to be mailed
from the Stalnaker office. When the
questionnaires are returned the Ex
com selections committee and the
Dean's office will have a more con
crete set of statistics to work with.
The situation grows more tense
as the prospect of having more than
88 apartments ready in the Village
by Sept. 20 grows less likely. The
Dean says, ". . . and we're not even
