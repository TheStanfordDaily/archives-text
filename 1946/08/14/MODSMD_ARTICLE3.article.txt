# A 						Year Ago Today
## 
### 
A year ago today Japan sur
rendered; the siren on the top of
the Hoover Libc blasted a sleepy
afternoon campus with the good
news. The women got special 12:30
late leaves for a celebration dance.
President Tresidder summed up
the hopes of Stanford when he
prayed it would be the last day
of its kind humanity would ever
have to celebrate.
Today it is appropriate that
each person measure bis actions
of the past year by the resolu
tions he made on that day of vic
tory. It is time to look back, to
consider the sacrifices, and to
shake ourselves out of the rut of
individual existences. Time to put
a little more into Stanford and the
world of which it is a microscopic
part.
