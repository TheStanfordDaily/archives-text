Chiang Kai - shek made his
long-awaiti'd statement yesterday,
promising to end Kuomintang one
party rule, restore constitutional
government, and convoke the Na
tional Assembly as scheduled. He
called on the Chinese Communists
to cease their efforts to establish
themselves by force, to withdraw
from vital communication lines,
and expressed hope for peace
in China. American Ambassador
Stuart was not impressed, how
ever. He said that Chiang's mes
sage did nothing to remove the
present obstacles to a peaceful
settlement, and that there was
nothing further that the American
peace envoys could do.
It does not appear to me that thÂ»
Generalissimo has much hope for a

peaceful settle
ment. His state
ment, besides
being a bid for
popular support,
apparently con
stitutes both a
warning to Red
Chin a and a
demonstration ot
his ijood, demo
cratic intentions

to the test of the world, particularly

the U.S. I have read that the Chi
nese Communists, lying as they do
across important trade routes, are
consciously disrupting China's eco
nomic life, and letting the National
ist government take the blame. But.
whether or not that is true, it does
seem that neither party in China is
willing to trust the other, that nei
ther is willing to weaken its own
position by any show of co-opera
tion whatever, and. therefore, that
the civil war in China has just be
gun.
They've got a new word for it
now! Forty State Department em
ployees were fired recently for
"foreign affiliations."
The Peace Conference in Paris,
which is continuing to wrangle its
way around and around like a dog
chasing its tail, presented a magnifi
cent picture yesterday of the "party
line" in action. The Peace Confer
ence has been hearing speeches from
leaders of the defeated nations, ap
pealing for better terms. When de
Gaspari of Italy finished his address.
Kardelj of Yugoslavia denounced
Italy at length, declaring that she
still harbored an aggressor's spirit,
and demanding a hard peace for
her. When Patarescu of Rumania
finished his appeal today, Russia's

Vishinsky and whoever represents
Czechoslovakia praised Rumania's
progress toward democracy, took a
slap at American demands for repa
rations for devastated oil properties
in Rumania, and suggested a soft
peace for the Balkan monarchy.
Applications for terminal leave
pay are expected to reach West
Coast post oilices and other dis
tribution points by Saturday.
After publishing an "expose" of
Turkish-German plots against Rus
sia, the Soviets have followed up
with a demand for revision of the
arrangements controlling the use of
the Hellespont. The Russian note
even suggests that Russia and Tur
key should make joint arrangements
for its defense, and, maintaining the
attitude they have adopted on the
question of free navigation of the
Danube, it declares that arrange
ments for control of the straits are
the concern only of the Black eSa
nations,
H. G. Wells' passing yesterday
takes from the world one of its
great contemporary writers. Death
of the historian also removes a
scorching critic of the British tnon
archial system. One might say that
the system is stronger than men.
