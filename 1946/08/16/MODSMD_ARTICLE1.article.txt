Concluding today with Finland,
all the Axis satellites have pre
sented their cases to the Paris
Peace Conference, and all have
asked for more moderate terms.
The reception they have been
given seems to he based on the
degree of Russian influence, if not
control, that they have accepted.
The bloc of Russian satellites, Po
land. Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia,
with Russia, White Russia, and
the Ukraine, have voiced approval
of Rumanian and Bulgarian pleas,
have been cool to the advances of
Finland and Hungary, and have
vociferously insisted on a "hard
peace" for Italy.
Yesterday's conference session

opened on the
usual bitter
note. Secretary
Byrnes rose to
defend the U.S.
in the face of
certain Russian
insinuations re
garding nations
that "enriched"
themselves dur
ing the war.

riyrnes said that America has re
ceived and asked for no recom
pense for the four hundred billion
dollars she spent (of which eleven
billion went to Russia) "other than
the freedom she fought to secure for
herself and all mankind."
The session closed on a more con
ciliatory note, however. Molotov's
reply to Byrnes echoed his plea for
co-operation, and expressed a de
sire that the work of the confer
ence be soon concluded, without
adjournments.
The CIO seamen of the Great
Lakes went out on strike yester
day. after negotiations conducted
bj the federal conciliation service
broke down. AFL Lake sailors
will not go out, but will observe
CIO picket lines.
Principal Lake cargoes are in
bulk, iron ore, grain, etc. The effect
of a prolonged transportation tie-up
in such materials will do production
nc good. Obviously.
Meanwhile, here on the Coast,
Southern Pacific trainmen have
called a strike against the "friend
ly" road for next Wednesday, un
less President Truman intervenes
and appoints the appropriate
board. The brotherhood claims
violations of work agreements.
The situation in China and in
Palestine is getting worse, not
better. The Holy Land is seething
with rumors of increased Jewish
underground activities. The first
shipment of illegal immigrants
reached Cyprus, but not without
bitter words and a few casualties.
The Chinese Communists an
nounced. and the Nationalists ad
mitted. Red victories along an im
portant rail line.
