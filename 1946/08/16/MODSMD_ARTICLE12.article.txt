THE ADMINISTRATION
The Tresidder administration has been the whipping-boy
upon whicii a good many people have taken out their sorrow
at seeing Stanford .change from small, comfortable school into
a crowded, uncomfortable school.
From the student's point of view there are two sides to this
situation.
These things are facts:
The administration faces a very tough financial problem in
keeping Stanford afloat.
The administration has not yet had a chance to prove itself
at the normal peacetime job of providing education, for during
the war most of the signals were called by the military educa
tion planners in Washington, and now many of the problems
are aftermaths of war which no man or group of men have de
sired or created.
The administration is bringing students into the planning
for the future through Excom.
These things are also facts:
Many problems which have caused criticism on campus
have not been clarified by administration-student liason. As
one example, the all-student assembly at Stanford is seldom
used as an open question-and-answer discussion of university
problems. Administrators could well check in their own minds
twice before they decide that students have no business
knowing of a this or that problem.
Many members of the administration are entirely new to
Stanford. Every effort should be made by anybody new to
Stanford to soak up as much Stanford tradition and techniques
as possible. Old ways are not necessarily the worst.
A great deal of the bitterness about various changes in the
school has collapsed when people have learned the facts.
Getting those facts is a two-way process. It requires digging
by student leaders, and an effort on the part of the administra
tion to let the students know just what is going on.
We hope that fall quarter some sort of regular monthly
meetings between student leaders and the President can be
established to bring students closer to the problems facing
Stanford.
