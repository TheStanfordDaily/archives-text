# Fall Quarter Libe Facilities Inadequate?
## 
### EVELYN KONRAD 
Existing library facilities, par
ticularly in the Reserve Book
Room, will be inadequate to han
dle the increased registration load
fall quarter, Nathan Van Patten,
director of University Libraries,
said yesterday.
The problem is now under con
sideration, but no definite deci
sions have been made, he said.
"It is hoped that limited library
facilities may be made available
at "Stanford Village," that more
books can be provided for the
Reserve Book Room, and addition
al assistants employed so that nec
essary adjustments may be made
in library hours," he said.
However, augmenting the sup
ply of books will not solve the li
brary problem, since the Main Li
brary building is not sufficiently
spacious to accommodate any
marked enlargement in either staff
or stock.
Library officials have asked for
other areas on campus for ex
panding the Reserve Book Rooms,
but have not yet been assigned
any other'space.
Furthermore. having Reserve
Book Rooms in various differen.
buildings would involve an un
necessarily large expense, because
of the useless duplication of sup
ply, and the need for extra per
sonnel, Mr. Van Patten said.
It is expected, however, that
students will be needed for part
time employment during next
quarter at the circulation desk, in
the Reserve Book Room and read
ing rooms of the Main Library, as
well as in the Education Library.
