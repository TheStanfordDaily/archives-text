# WILD INTELLECTUAL HAREM
## 
### 
The Sentimentalist, roughly
speaking, is the man who wants to
eat his cake and have it. He has
no sense of honor about ideas; he
will not see that one must pay for
an idea as for anything else. He
will have them all at once in one
wild intellectual harem, no matter
how much they quarrel and con
tradict each other. â€”G. K. Chester
