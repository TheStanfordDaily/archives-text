AGAIN
The fraternity system at Stan
ford—if it is to be kept in exist
ence—needs a balance, a balance
which prior to the war was fur
nished in large measure by the
eating clubs which existed here.
Without some balance, the fra
ternity system cannot justify itselt
except inasmuch as it furnishes
living space to some 750 men.
Through no fault of their own.
the clubs have lost out to the
point where it will be impos
sible for them to function again
in the fashion in which they
once fashioned. Not one of
Stanford's seven eating clubs
will be able to arrange suitable
dining and elubroom space for
the coming few years.
Prior to the war, a man could

make his choice
as to whether
he wanted to i
go into a fra- I
ternity or an I
eating club and J
was almost*
sure of getting \
into some or
ganized body
even if he did
not make the
group he wanted.

The University expects some
4,500 men on the campus this fall,
jbout 2.000 of whom may desive to
,ve on campus. With the frater
lities only able to accommodate
about 750 men. there are going to
oe a lot of people out in the cold

with no organization to turn to.
It certainly is not fair if 1,250
men are to be left out in the rain
while 750 live the life of Riley in a
tong house up the Row.
We would suggest that tho
houses be taken over immediately
by the University administration
and an apportionment of rooms in
them be made by the office of ihc
Dean of Students on a fair and
impartial basis.
Kitchens could he run on the
same basis as the University now
runs the kitchens in what used
to he sorority houses.
The situation seems to have
worked out all right in the for
mer sorority houses without
anyone being too broken up
about the whole situation.
It seems to us that any country
as lucky as is the United States
unc'.or present world conditions
should make a real effort to get
rid of any and all organizations
which sponsor snobbishness or
racial prejudices.
And from what we've seen, fra
ternities foster both.
Very few men now registered
at the University haven't griped at
the caste system as it existed in
military life.
What are fraternjties but an
other—and to our mind a more
vicious—caste system?
We don't claim that all frater
nity men are snobs, but we do
claim that the fraternity envi
ronment is conducive to snob
bishness and that too many
members are not strong enough
to overcome the tendency.
TUe majority of the Stanford

fratrnities felt themselves free
to break University regulations
to an extent that would have
called for suspension of registra
tion had their activities been
discovered. Under the hall sys
tem. there was a minimum con
trol of the lives of students, but
certain things were demanded.
Chief among these were the
rulings concerning liquor and
women, both of which were ver
boten in the Halls.
But some fraternities felt free to
keep liquor in their houses, flout
ing conditions of the original
University grant.
And many of them felt free to
bring women into the houses on
occasion, certainly not recom
mended conduct for colege under
graduates.
Beer in many coke machines up
and down the Row is not too bad.
but drunken parties in the houses
are certainly to be censured.
(Linotyper's note: Bull Ses
sioner was so hot tonight that
the column burned out the lino
type pot. causing more than an
hour's delay.)
