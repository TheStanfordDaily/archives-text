Tla Editor, Sir:
In regard to your campaign to
reorganize Excom, and especially
your article of Friday, Aug. 9.
First we are in agreement with
your general idea of some type of
modification of the present gov
ernment system, even if it is not
your original idea. (Some reliable
sources have it that the sugges
tion was first made by last spring's
Excom.)
WE THINK YOU HAVE over
stepped your grounds and have
expressed your opinions on things
you know little about, namely
paragraph four of Excom 111,
which reads "But Excom itself can
control its members if they be
come too overactive, too much the
Big Men on Campus type that
have time for nothing more than
the weekly evening meeting."
We don't know if Mr. Editor
were here last year or not; if he
were, he certainly didn't go out
of his way for student activities.
If he weren't, then this may be of
interest to him.
If it hadn't been for a few of
these "Big Men on Campus type."
this campus would have been a
sad affair, for they were the only
ones who were willing to give any
time for the benefit of the entire
campus.
FOR EXAMPLE, WHY WAS
it that a certain sophomore class
president had charge of the soph
omore Carnival and at the same
time had to take charge of the
Con Home Labor Day? If you will
check, not because he wanted to,
but because no one else would do
it or they were too busy.
Why was it that one of the
chairmen for the Con Home Day
barbecue was also the business
manager for the Quad? No one
else would do it.
Why was it th it the other chair
man for the barbecue had to work
seven hours digging out the bar
becue pit, assisted only by the
above sophomore class president
I am sure not because they so

desired, but because there was no
one else on the campus interested
enough in campus activities to
give a little of their time.
WHY WAS IT THAT OUT OF
the six people who cleaned up thr>
garbage cans after the barbecue,
one was the student manager, one
was the president of Cardinals,
one was business manager of the
Quad (and also chairman for the
entire week), and the other a var
sity baseball man, the other co
chairman? Not because they had
nothing else to do but simply be
cause there was no one else who
would give their valuable time for
a little of Stanford.
We think that these few "Big
Men on Campus'' deserve more
credit than you or I can ever give
them. They are the ones who keep
this place together.
You read daily editorials on
"what has happened to the good
old Stanford Spirit." You know
who has it'.' The Big Man on
Campus, that's who has it.
MAYBE THEY HAVEN'T done
things so well as could have been
done, but under the conditions
which they had to work I think
they did a more than satisfactory
job. For when it came time to
organize an activity there was
never anyone willing to give up
his time, and it became a necessity
to call on the same people again.
If you want to see things run
more satisfactorily around here
you would do better to lay ot 5 !
this type of person and direct
your campaign toward the hun
dreds of people on this campus
who have never lilted a finger to
help.

WE THINK YOU HAVE over
stepped your grounds and have
expressed your opinions on things
you know little about, namely
paragraph four of Excom 111,
which reads "But Excom itself can
control its members if they be
come too overactive, too much the
Big Men on Campus type that
have time for nothing more than
the weekly evening meeting."
We don't know if Mr. Editor
were here last year or not; if he
were, he certainly didn't go out
of his way for student activities.
If he weren't, then this may be of
interest to him.
If it hadn't been for a few of
these "Big Men on Campus type."
this campus would have been a
sad affair, for they were the only
ones who were willing to give any
time for the benefit of the entire
campus.
FOR EXAMPLE, WHY WAS
it that a certain sophomore class
president had charge of the soph
omore Carnival and at the same
time had to take charge of the
Con Home Labor Day? If you will
check, not because he wanted to,
but because no one else would do
it or they were too busy.
Why was it that one of the
chairmen for the Con Home Day
barbecue was also the business
manager for the Quad? No one
else would do it.
Why was it th it the other chair
man for the barbecue had to work
seven hours digging out the bar
becue pit, assisted only by the
above sophomore class president
I am sure not because they so

desired, but because there was no
one else on the campus interested
enough in campus activities to
give a little of their time.
WHY WAS IT THAT OUT OF
the six people who cleaned up thr>
garbage cans after the barbecue,
one was the student manager, one
was the president of Cardinals,
one was business manager of the
Quad (and also chairman for the
entire week), and the other a var
sity baseball man, the other co
chairman? Not because they had
nothing else to do but simply be
cause there was no one else who
would give their valuable time for
a little of Stanford.
We think that these few "Big
Men on Campus'' deserve more
credit than you or I can ever give
them. They are the ones who keep
this place together.
You read daily editorials on
"what has happened to the good
old Stanford Spirit." You know
who has it'.' The Big Man on
Campus, that's who has it.
MAYBE THEY HAVEN'T done
things so well as could have been
done, but under the conditions
which they had to work I think
they did a more than satisfactory
job. For when it came time to
organize an activity there was
never anyone willing to give up
his time, and it became a necessity
to call on the same people again.
If you want to see things run
more satisfactorily around here
you would do better to lay ot 5 !
this type of person and direct
your campaign toward the hun
dreds of people on this campus
who have never lilted a finger to
help.
