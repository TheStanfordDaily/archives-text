For the first time since the 1941
Rose Bowl game with Nebraska,
Norm Standlee and Frankie Albert
will be in the same backfield. The
time is tonight. The place is San
Jose's Spartan Stadium. The price
is $1.50, cheap, considering the stars.
The stadium should be packed to
night as the San Francisco '49ers
play an intersquad game. Besides
Albert and Standlee, the number one
backfield will also have Lenny Esh
mont, Fordham's former all-Ameri
can, and Strike Stryzkalski, Mar
quette's former Ail-American. Play
ing in the line for this squad will be
Bruno Banducci and Hank Norberg,
other Stanford Rose Bowl stars.
DON'T START feeling sorry for
the other team, for they are also
aded. They'll have one of the
greatest passing combinations this
coast has seen, Jesse Freitas to Alyn
Beals, the same pair that made foot
ball history at Santa Clara.
In the same backfield with Freitas
will be Ken Casenega, also from
Santa Clara, Parker Hall, from Mis
sissippi State and most valuable
player in the National Professional

| League his first' season there, and
Dick Renfro from Washington State.
THE FIRST SQUAD will be

named the "Red" team and the other [
squad the "White" team for this con
test. The "Red" team will be coached
by former Stanford coach, Jim Law
son, and the "White" team by A 1
Ruffo, former assistant to Buck j
Shaw at Santa Clara.
The total gold and gold certificate
reserves of the Federal Reserve j
Banks in 1941 was $20,504,000,000.
