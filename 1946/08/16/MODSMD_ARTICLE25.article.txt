# Atomic Power Seen for '56
## 
### 
''It seems safe to say that within
10 years there will be peacetime use
of atomic power."
This was the opinion of Dr. Hugh
H. Skilling, executive head of the
Electrical Engineering Department,
upon returning to the campus after
a two-month trip to Bikini as an
observer of the first two atom bomb
tests.
DR. SKILLING LEFT JUNE 12
aboard the U.S.S. Panamint as one
of 22 scientists invited as observers
ty Vice Adm. W. H. P. Blandy. His
purpose was to evaluate the possi
bilities of peacetime use of atomic
energy for the generation of power.
Commenting on the tests, Dr.
Skilling said, "Speaking for the
Americans, I feel safe in saying it
was a very necessary test. The re
sults will be invaluable the de
sign of military and naval struc
tures."
"IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A
navy at all we certainly will have
to have a navy designed to with
stand modern weapons. There is
absolutely no question in my mind
that the tests not only were justi
fied, but were necessary to the wel
fare of our navy.
The Baruch plan for international
control of atomic energy was re
ceived favorably aboard the ship by
the United States people and by
tho.se foreign representatives who
expressed their opinions, he said.
Dr. Skilling also praised the reports
of the two boards evaluating the
tests.
