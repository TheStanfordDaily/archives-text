# Village Is Not Iron Curtained

### 
The position of Stanford Village
authorities regarding student visits
to the housing development was
clarified yesterday by Dwight Adams,
Village director.
Adams said visiting by the stu- j
dents is desired, but it is has proved
necessary to place such visits on an
organized basis because of the prop
erty control problem at the village. J
.Several instances of theft of Uni
versity and contractor's property
have been recorded, and the guards
at the Village have therefore been
instructed to refuse admittance to |
anyone without proper business, he
said.
Mr. Adams said he is very willing !
to arrange a visiting day when guides
can be provided to exhibit the fa
cilities and accommodations to be
available.
