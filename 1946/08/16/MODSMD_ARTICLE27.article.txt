## 
### CARL HEINTZ 
The Stanford Players climaxed a
successful summer quarter dramatic
season with last night's production
of "The School for Scandal."
A uniformly good cast clad in
some of the most brilliant costumes
since '"Marco's Millions," that mem
orable epic of yesteryear, went
through the lines and situations of
Richard Sheridan's famous 18th cen
tury play with precision and gusto.
The set, designed by Wendell
Cole, was in keeping with the best
traditions of the ISth century stage
and although relatively simple was
excellent
OUTSTANDING performances
were given by George Wilson as Sir
Peter Teazle, an irrasicible, but earn
est old lover; Newton Arnold as
Charles Surface, a delightful rake
in the style of the time; Joan o''Niel
as Lady Teazle, a frivolous young
wretch, Irene Griffith and Jane
Saulsberry as Mrs. Candour and
Lady Sneerwell, both excellent gos
sips, and lastly John Lawry back
to the .old stand as both Sir Harry
Bumper and Snake.
Lady Teazle's dress incidental
ly was the outstanding achieve
ment of Mrs. Muriel Lievsay, and
carried away honors in the cos
tume division.
If you want cultured comedy in
the old style. '"The School for Scan
dal" is for youJ Tickets are still .on
sale for tonight and Saturday eve
