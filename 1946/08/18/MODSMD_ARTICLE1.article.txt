Wars and rumors of wars dept. . . .
Continued rioting in Calcutta has
left 1,500 dead and more than twice
that number injured. Mohamme
dans, Hindus, and Sikhs are contin
uing with knives, clubs, and arson
the religious brawl that started with
a Moslem political demonstration
against the independence plan that
would have given the Hindus a pre
ponderant voice in the Indian gov
ernment. Police and British troops
have so far failed to restore order.
In Haifa, the latest shipment of

illegal refugees
were driven on
board ship for
transportation to
Cyprus only by
the liberal ap
plication of tear
gas and fire
hoses. On Cy
prus, a thousand
Jews stormed
the gates of their

internment camp, but retreated
when guards fired over their heads.
The Chinese Communists have
continued to strengthen their posi
tion along the Peiping-Mukden rail
road. But Nationalist commanders
expect to "stabilize" the situation
"in a few days."
The latest report about terminal
leave pay applications says that
they will be available "before the
end of the month."
The U.N. membership committee
in New York has so far approved
only Afghanistan's application. Swe
den and Iceland have been "tenta
tively" approved. Greece has vio
lently opposed Albania on the
grounds that it is not a "peace-lov
ing" nation. China has questioned
Outer Mongolia's position. Russia
i-nd Poland have opposed Transjor
dan and Eire. The French have
blocked the application -of Siam.
Portugal was blackballed by Russia,
Poland, and Mexico.
Professor Urcy, Nobel Prize
winner of the University of Chi
cago and atom - bomb scientist,
says in an article just published
that it might be necessary for the
U.S. to conquer the world with
atomic weapons, in order to rule
it as we desire and to keep other
nations from developing "weap
ons of mass warfare."
There is not much comment to be
made on a statement like that. I
can only condemn it, condemn it on
every moral, ethical, and pragmatic
ground of which you can think. It
(lies in the face of every "spring of
action" we ought ever to reverence
in America. I have served in a vic
torious army and have seen some
defeated nations, and I can confirm
that the results of war, for con
queror and conqueree both, are
pretty poor. More war is the prob
lem, not the answer!

Professor Urcy, Nobel Prize
winner of the University of Chi
cago and atom - bomb scientist,
says in an article just published
that it might be necessary for the
U.S. to conquer the world with
atomic weapons, in order to rule
it as we desire and to keep other
nations from developing "weap
ons of mass warfare."
There is not much comment to be
made on a statement like that. I
can only condemn it, condemn it on
every moral, ethical, and pragmatic
ground of which you can think. It
(lies in the face of every "spring of
action" we ought ever to reverence
in America. I have served in a vic
torious army and have seen some
defeated nations, and I can confirm
that the results of war, for con
queror and conqueree both, are
pretty poor. More war is the prob
lem, not the answer!

The Chinese Communists have

"in a few days."
The latest report about terminal
leave pay applications says that
they will be available "before the
end of the month."
The U.N. membership committee
in New York has so far approved
only Afghanistan's application. Swe

Outer Mongolia's position. Russia
