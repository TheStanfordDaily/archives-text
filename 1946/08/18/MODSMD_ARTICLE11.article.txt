# THE 						STANFORD DAILY
## Editorials..... UNITED NATIONS HERE? 
### 
Reportedly an agent of the Bay Area committee which is
lobbying for the location of the United Nations Organization
in this area is around the campus sounding out the residents
on their feelings.
For what it's worth, The Daily assures this representative of
our feeling that the UN could find a happy and effective home
in the Stanford area.
We have the climate. We have the intellectual resources,
including the world's best documentation of the fascist injuries
to humanity which UN is trying to repair. We are as near to
the various homes of UN members as any other place on this
air-knit globe.
The biggest thing the West Coast is bucking is the money
boys in the East who would like to have UN's trade and in
fluence as long as they don't have to give anything better
for a site than some old factory buildings.
About all the Daily can do about it is to say that the Stanford
area has something which few others seem willing to match â€”
& welcome for UN if it chooses to join us here.
