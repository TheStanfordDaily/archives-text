## Bull Session IN MEMORIAL 
### 
It is apparent from the way
things are going that Stanford has
seen the last of the eating clubs as
they used to exist.
Our tong was Breakers, one of
the three independent clubs which
used to occupy separate dining
quarters in the space between
Toyon and Encina. You can see
the quarters still if you will look
at the three stucco buildings piled
up near the old R.O.T.C. stables.
Breakers' building is not alone: it

is accompanied
by those be
longing to Toro
and Campo.
Breakers has
been referred,
to recently as!
a bunch of ath
letes. True, we
did have four
lettermen from
the last Rose

Bowl team and had all four mem
bers of the world record-holding
mile relay team of 1939-40. But
we had some board-payers too.
Everybody wasn't a hasher.
Eating clubs had two things to
offer to Stanford men who did not
wish to become affiliated with a
fraternity.
First, they offered roughs a
chance to eat meals with congen
ial groups of their own choosing.
Many a man has learned to eat a
full dinner in seven minutes as a
result of his eating club experi
ence. If you didn't eat fast enough
it was the privilege of the hashers
to sling a bucket of water over
you. And the hashers were the
sole determiners of what was fast
enough.
Second, the University at that
time offered first choice on rooms
in Toyon to club men. You picked
your own roommates and in so
far as possible got the room you
wanted.
But all this is changed. There is
not enough space to give full
rooms on Encina Commons to each
club. Under the present plan each
club will have as many tables in
a room as it can fill.
We can see how it would work.
Vou eat your meals with 80 other
men in the same room, and with
none of your club furniture, mag
azines, etc., allowed because there
isn't room. Once a week at the
and of a meal you wait for every
me else to leave and then have a
neeting. Not too sharp.
And as for rooms in Toyon.
here'll be twice as many return
ing Stanford men who want to get
<n there next quarter as there will
room for, so even if you reor
ganized you wouldn't be able to
4et room preferenc s for your new
nembers. Also not too sharp
But the clubs used to be fur

We hated fraternities. We hated
them so much we didn't go to
their chapter dances unless we
were invited. And we wouldn't
even go up the Row for a free
meal unless we were asked twice.
Breakers was recognized as the
most expert group of waterers on
the campus. The Dekes held down
the Row championship, but all club
men thought the Dekes were a
bunch of sissies. The Dekes used
to water sorority women, and no
true clubman would water any
one who couldn't fight back on
even terms.
We remember one night at a
club meeting one of the brothers
brought up the subject of the
next day's intramural basketball
game with the Zetes. Somebody
got the idea we all ought to go up
to the Zete house and throw a
little water, and so off we started,
equipped with buckets.
We got about 25 feet away when
some unwise Toro member threw
a bucket of water.
The ensuing brawl lasted until
so late that we didn't have time
to water the Zetes. But John
Bunn frowned on that sort of
stuff anyhow.

A graduate of several years ago
recently took a job on a news
paper up in the Pacific Northwest.
A little while ago a couple of
gals from the town in which he is
working were going to San Fran
cisco. so he gave them the names
of a couple of his old buddies down
on the Farm. He told the gals his
old friends would be glad to show
them what made San Francisco go
round.
The trouble was he hadn't kept
in touch with his old friends.
One of the boys had to stay
home with his sick three-year-old
son, and the other couldn't shake
his fiancee long enough to show
the gals a good time.
