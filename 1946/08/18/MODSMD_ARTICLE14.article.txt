# Campus Opinion—Fraternity Pals Attack Bull Sessioner's Column
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
So Bull Session's cherubic Sage
from Yuba City finds himself com
pelled to break a promise by of
fering an anti - fraternity cam
paign? Billions Scandolph Wurst
again appears in a Stanford pub
lication.
llow about a few replies, for
some of the columnist's argu
ments sound quite a bit like
"Johnny has a bigger lollypop
than 1 have. Mama. Take it
away from him!"
First of all, it seems a bit lack
ing in logic to ask why 750 Mi
chaels should live in those houses
instead of 750 Henrys. No matter
who lives on the Row and in Stan
ford Village, the amount of avail
able space on and off campus will
not be changed by abolishing fra
ternities. Robbing Peter to pay
Paul never has been sound econ
omy!
And how about the "moral lep
ers"? They exist in fraternities in
the same percentage as in the stu
dent body as a whole. Sure there
are unsavory characters, "holier
than thou" types, just as there are
in any large group. But implying
that exceptions are representative
of general conduct, in a discussion
like this, is no more valid than
saying all Congressmen are war
profiteers because of the example
of one individual.
What about beer and women?
There are law breakers in every
society, fraternity or dormitory,
but statements as broad as "The
majority of Stanford fraternities
felt free to break University regu
lations" seem to put the Daily's
readers on the level of mentality
toward which the late J. Goebbels
directed his propaganda: tell 'em
a big lie and ignore sustaining
facts; what's the difference if it's
a one-sided story?
Before the war there were
proportionately as many bottles
of Schlitz and lipstick - marked
cigarettes in the halls as in the
houses, Mr. Chandler.
Yes. there will be 4,500 men
here next fall and for three ov
four more falls to come, and then,
with the end of G.I. Bill educa
tion for most veterans like our
selves, the University will be back
tc a registration probably not
much greater than pre-war size.
In the meantime the great cru
sader asks Stanford to antagonize
thousands of alumni of the past
25-50 years by condemning those
houses for which they have paid
and to which they return on foot
ball Saturdays, as "dens of in
iqnity and snobbery." The school
is requested to jeopardize estab
lished financial support which it
now urgently requires, just so the
name of Lasuen will be
Twilloughby Hall and not Row
Dammit Row.
What advantage is there in de
stroying fifty years of Stanford's
background merely to be reaction
ary against a nationally distrib
uted abnormality in school attend
ance which will last for three or
four years?
Some of the illustrations of
the scribe are undoubtedly true,
hut his position of argument
would he stronger if he. were to
avoid such foolish insinuations
which attempt to make a frater
nity man a Mr. Hyde in com
parison to a non-fraternity Dr.
Jekyll. If he continues to por
tray the fraternity member as
the paragon .of turpitude, then
Palo Alto mothers will soon lock
their children indoors when
Stanford's student body presi
dent goes into town for a milk
shake!
When you present fair and ra
tional arguments for fraternity
abolition. R. Wilbur Chandler,
most house members will be
among the first to discuss your
points impartially, but. unless
you're prepping for a job on that
S.F. morning paper, why continue
this rather childish ~nd falsely

predicated demamation of charac
ter campaign?

The Editor, Sir:
During my recent period of
travel at Army expense I came
into contact with men from many
other universities from all sec
tions of the country. In the dis
cussions that arose there were two
points that I could always hold
out for Stanford. One was the
Honor Code, and the other was
the fact that no serious so-called
"fraternity problem" existed. That
situation in which Hall and Row
men could be good friends, could
get along, and could work togeth
ei was something peculiar to

Stanford, and something that I es
pecially liked about the place.
Now, however, I have been in
formed by your erstwhile Bull
Sessions in the last two issues of
the Daily that such a thing exists.
That may be. Mr. Chandler is en
titled to express his opinions as he
pleases, and like fellow-columnist
Pegler, he may present them in
any way that suits him. I do
however take exception to the de
cidedly unfair presentation of the
problem and the nebulous reason -
