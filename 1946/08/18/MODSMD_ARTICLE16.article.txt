In a contest not overly exciting
hut with enough action to demon
strate the '49ers' ability, the Red
squad coached by former Stanford
coach Jim Lawson put together two
touchdowns made by former Stan
ford stars, Frankie Albert and Norm
Standlee, to take the White team
coached by A 1 Rufl'o 13-0 in the San
Francisco '49ers' inter-squad game
last Friday night.
Albert further proved to us that
he is the best T-formation quarter
back in the business. Also demon
strated to us the -other evening was
the great playing of Parker Hall,

who seems to have the same ability
a;; in 1939 when he was named the
most valuable player in the Nation
al Professional League and the same
ability that sparked the Del Monte
Pre - Flight team to greatness in
1943.
HALL, WHO WE BELIEVE would
bo terrific in Gallarneau's former

spot of right half with Â£lbert,
Standlee, ancl Len Eshmont in the
same backfield, was used to relieve
Albert at quarter in the second half.
I) is quite interesting to compare
the two men, Albert and Hall.
In field generalship, Albeit rates
the higher, for, as we stated above,
there is none superior.
In passing, the two offer distinct
ly different types. In the game Fri
day, Albert looked superior, but it
wasn't Hall's fault. Albert looks for
a receiver and throws when he
finds him. Hall throws to a spot
where the receiver is supposed to
be at a certain instant. In many
cases, the ball was there while the
intended receiver was not. That is
the reason Albert looked better.
IN RUNNING ABILITY, lIALL
shines. The outstanding run of the
evening was Hall's sneak through
the center of the line good for some
20 yards. He has a drive that is
second on the squad only to Stand
let. Albert is a different type of
runner, a broken-field runner. We
believe Hall's ability in running is
lost at quarterback and that he
should operate from the right-half
position where he can gather mo
mentum before he receives the ball.
We maintain that a backfield of
Albert at quarter, Standlee at full,
Eshmont at left half, and Parker
Hall at right half would be unbeat
able in this AU-American Confer
ence.
While talking about Hall at right
half, let us not lose sight of the
fact that Marquette's "Strike" Strzv
kalski performed creditably at right
half during the time he played. He
reeled off quite a bit of yardage in
the first touchdown drive.
Other backs who looked good
were Earle Parsons, Kenny Case
nega, Don Durdan, and Jess Freitas
with his passing to A1 Beals. Joe

Vetrano got off a beautiful punt that
traveled well over 50 yards.
STANFORD'S BRUNO Banduc
ci played good ball in the line along
with John Kuzman, Dutch Elston,
and John Woudenberg. Alyn Beals
will prove during the season to be
among the top pass receivers in the
conference. A great pass receiver at
Santa Clara, he seems to have lost
none of his ability during the war
time interval.

DUE TO THE OVER-CROWDED
condition of the Stanford golf
course, it has been decided by those
in charge to limit guest privileges
and amount of play by transients.
Students will not be affected in the
least by the new rulings.
Members of the course will be
allowed to bring guests, but, if the
guest lives within a 25-mile radius,
he is limited to one round of golf
at this course per month.
