# Inca Photographic Exhibit To Be Shown At Stanford
## 
### 
"The Incas," a photographic ex
hibition prepared by the editors of
Life Magazine, will be on display at
the Stanford University Art Gal
lery, beginning Tuesday and con
tinuing through Sept. 1.
THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF
exhibitions based on Life photo
graphic essays, "The Incas" opened
recently at New York's American
Museum of Natural History and
was on view later at the Metro
politan Museum of Art. The exhibit
consists of thirty 28x38-inch photo
graphs by Life's veteran photog
rapher, Frank Scherschel. Captions
and running text provide a story se
quence.
After his return from the Euro
pean war front, Scherschel made a
six - months tour of Central and
South America. He spent many
weeks in the mountains of Peru, ex
ploring and photographing traces of
the Inca civilization which van
ished 400 years ago. His striking
pictures graphically reveal the
greatness of this little-known and
mostly unexplored empire of pre-

Columbian America.
THE PHOTOGRAPHS WERE
taken mostly in the Urubamba Val
ley, heart of the Inea empire. They
include the massive and mysterious
ruins of Fort Sacsahuaman, the hill
side village of Winay Wayna, Ollan
taytambo, and Machu Picchu, one
of the most perfectly preserved of
the Inca cities.
