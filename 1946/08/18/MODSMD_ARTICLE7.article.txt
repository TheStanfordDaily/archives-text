# 'Branner Brawl' Attended by 400
## 
### 
With no particular theme, no par
ticular decorations, and no charge,
the dance at Branner Hall last Sat
urday really packed 'em in. Vari
ously heralded as "Branner's Swan
Song," "Branner Brawl," "Summer
Sport Dance," whatever it was. the
campus liked it.
From nine to one Saturday night,
approximately 200 couples danced in
the lounge, danced on the front ter
race, lined up for refreshments in
the court, sat along the glass
bricked arcades, and apparently
succeeded in enjoying themselves
as guests of the men who have held
sway in Branner this one lone
post-war quarter.
Hal Roberts' band lived up to ev
ery expectation. The refreshments
were so successful that they "sold
out" twice during the evening. The
souvenir bids with A 1 Larson's car
toon were something every "queen"
insisted on stuffing into one of her
"rough's" pockets.
For decorations, the Brannermen
merely pulled the long red drapes
across the lounge windows, put a
few soft colored lights in the cor
ners, and turned out as many of
the other lights as possible. A cer
tain amount of confusion about the
starting time was settled as soon as
Roberts' smooth rhythms rolled out
through the lounge's long windows.
Student police reported no un
seemly occurrence, and apparently
a good time was had by all.—Norton
