# How To Capture Those Men!!!
## 
### TOM SELF 
During the war college women
dressed to suit themselves. With no
men around to please, they soon got
out of the habit and lost their tech
nical know-how. Came the cessa
tion of hostilities, men returned to
the campus in huge numbers, and
the campus cuties besieged their
R.A.'s, sponsors, et al., with ques
tions of how to dress to please
and/or catch the male eye.
Chaos reigned. The sponsors
weren't sure because men are usu
ally reticent about informing girls
of their desires.
THEN THE WHITE HOUSE. SAN
Francisco clothing store, came to
the rescue with their gallop-ing poll
conducted confidentially among 100
prominent men of Stanford and the
same number of Cal ditto.
Purpose of the questionnaire sent
tc the 8.M.0.C. was to determine
what college men preferred in
clothes (on and off campus) and
what they liked in women gener
ally.
Answers to the poll just released
are not only enlightening in their
illustration of what the post-war
male likes in women, but they show
st.me interesting differences of opin
ion between Stanford men and Cal
ifornia boys.
FOR EXAMPLE. ON THE ques
tion of what men noticed first, eyes,
smile, personality, legs, etc., Cali
fornia men were strong in favor of
personality (36 per cent) and Stan
ford Roughs were fascinated most
by legs (59 per cent). An observ
ing Farmer checked shoes.
Stanford men are more hesitant
about blind datss than Cal men and
they are less influenced by what
their roommate says about their
dates. On the question of blind

dates Stanford voted no 71 per cent
to Cal's 53 per cent. One Rough ex
pressed it, "Hssitant ain't the word
for it."
STEADY GIRLS ARE MORE de
sirable on the Farm. Cal boys like
tc play the field, say 48 per cent of
the Bears polled. Stanford would
rather go steady, according to (JO
per cent of the Roughs, while one
of L.S.J.U.'s wolves enjoys "play
ing the field with a steady hand."
On other questions of the poll
Stanford and California were al
most in accord.
Men look twice at blondes, con
fess a weakness for girls up to
their eyes, and prefer girls with
"average chassis." according to the
consensus of Cal Stanford opinion.
Bears and Roughs prefer hair
long and glamorous two to one over
any other style. Short and gamine
hair lagged way behind.
RED LIPSTICK AND NATURAL
make-up, fingernails short and with
polish will please most of the males.
One U.C. man thinks that long
nails are dangerous.
In the matter of perfume, men
voted almost 100 per cent for light
flower fragrances as opposed to dan
gerous, dramatic scents.
Questions on clothes filled a large
part of the questionnaire and the
answers were for campus wear,
sweaters and skirts; neither Cal nor
Stanford followed the outlines of the
poll on this question and wrote in
cottons for spring and summer ses
sions.
MEN LIKE THEIR SWEATERS
conservatively neat, bolted if you
like but NO MORE sloppy joes. Re
action to silk stockings was big on
both campuses. Socks were okayed
for campus, and lee makeup was a
definite no at both universities.

Saddle shoes must be clean.
True sons of California and ardent
supporters of the Chamber of Com
merce, men from both schools voted
81 per cent against hats. If hats
must be worn, however, they pre
fer little hats to big hats.
Concerning forma Is, men said they
positively swoon over formats that
are strapless. Svelte came second,
bouffant third. Pastels were favored
over black almost two to one. In
jewelry men like pearls best, but
earrings, chokers, and charm brace
lets made a good showing.
HOW SHOULD A GIRL LOOK
on a date—sexy, sultry, dangerous,
tacky, devil-may-care, rough-and
ready? No, an overwhelming num
ber of college men polled voted for
that "demure" look, whatever the
heck that is. One Stanford man,
probably a Phi Delt, wanted an in
telligent look above all.
College men object most to: wait
ing for a date, date with kissing
scruples, being commandeered to
tote purse or makeup, and a date
who brings her roommate.
FINALLY, GIRLS, YOU ARE
the woman of his dreams if you can
strike the happy medium of all
these rules: remember he'd rather
talk than listen; remember to be
more demure than dramatic; be a
last-minute crammer rather than
bookish; be more faintingly femi
nine than tweedish; be natural at
all times and forget the glamour.
Always be effervescent and never
shy; never be fickle but always
sincere; be independent, a clinging
vine only at times; try always to be
friendly, never aloof; be a 8.W.0.C.
or not, he leaves that up to you; be
beautiful and brainy and if you
can't be brainy, be beautiful first.

what they liked in women gener
ally.
Answers to the poll just released
are not only enlightening in their
illustration of what the post-war
male likes in women, but they show
st.me interesting differences of opin
ion between Stanford men and Cal
ifornia boys.
FOR EXAMPLE. ON THE ques
tion of what men noticed first, eyes,
smile, personality, legs, etc., Cali
fornia men were strong in favor of
personality (36 per cent) and Stan
ford Roughs were fascinated most
by legs (59 per cent). An observ
ing Farmer checked shoes.
Stanford men are more hesitant
about blind datss than Cal men and
they are less influenced by what
their roommate says about their
dates. On the question of blind

dates Stanford voted no 71 per cent
to Cal's 53 per cent. One Rough ex
pressed it, "Hssitant ain't the word
for it."
STEADY GIRLS ARE MORE de
sirable on the Farm. Cal boys like
tc play the field, say 48 per cent of
the Bears polled. Stanford would
rather go steady, according to (JO
per cent of the Roughs, while one
of L.S.J.U.'s wolves enjoys "play
ing the field with a steady hand."
On other questions of the poll
Stanford and California were al
most in accord.
Men look twice at blondes, con
fess a weakness for girls up to
their eyes, and prefer girls with
"average chassis." according to the
consensus of Cal Stanford opinion.
Bears and Roughs prefer hair
long and glamorous two to one over
any other style. Short and gamine
hair lagged way behind.
RED LIPSTICK AND NATURAL
make-up, fingernails short and with
polish will please most of the males.
One U.C. man thinks that long
nails are dangerous.
In the matter of perfume, men
voted almost 100 per cent for light
flower fragrances as opposed to dan
gerous, dramatic scents.
Questions on clothes filled a large
part of the questionnaire and the
answers were for campus wear,
sweaters and skirts; neither Cal nor
Stanford followed the outlines of the
poll on this question and wrote in
cottons for spring and summer ses
sions.
MEN LIKE THEIR SWEATERS
conservatively neat, bolted if you
like but NO MORE sloppy joes. Re
action to silk stockings was big on
both campuses. Socks were okayed
for campus, and lee makeup was a
definite no at both universities.

Saddle shoes must be clean.
True sons of California and ardent
supporters of the Chamber of Com
merce, men from both schools voted
81 per cent against hats. If hats
must be worn, however, they pre
fer little hats to big hats.
Concerning forma Is, men said they
positively swoon over formats that
are strapless. Svelte came second,
bouffant third. Pastels were favored
over black almost two to one. In
jewelry men like pearls best, but
earrings, chokers, and charm brace
lets made a good showing.
HOW SHOULD A GIRL LOOK
on a date—sexy, sultry, dangerous,
tacky, devil-may-care, rough-and
ready? No, an overwhelming num
ber of college men polled voted for
that "demure" look, whatever the
heck that is. One Stanford man,
probably a Phi Delt, wanted an in
telligent look above all.
College men object most to: wait
ing for a date, date with kissing
scruples, being commandeered to
tote purse or makeup, and a date
who brings her roommate.
FINALLY, GIRLS, YOU ARE
the woman of his dreams if you can
strike the happy medium of all
these rules: remember he'd rather
talk than listen; remember to be
more demure than dramatic; be a
last-minute crammer rather than
bookish; be more faintingly femi
nine than tweedish; be natural at
all times and forget the glamour.
Always be effervescent and never
shy; never be fickle but always
sincere; be independent, a clinging
vine only at times; try always to be
friendly, never aloof; be a 8.W.0.C.
or not, he leaves that up to you; be
beautiful and brainy and if you
can't be brainy, be beautiful first.
During the war college women
dressed to suit themselves. With no
men around to please, they soon got
out of the habit and lost their tech
nical know-how. Came the cessa
tion of hostilities, men returned to
the campus in huge numbers, and
the campus cuties besieged their
R.A.'s, sponsors, et al., with ques
tions of how to dress to please
and/or catch the male eye.
Chaos reigned. The sponsors
weren't sure because men are usu
ally reticent about informing girls
of their desires.
THEN THE WHITE HOUSE. SAN
Francisco clothing store, came to
the rescue with their gallop-ing poll
conducted confidentially among 100
prominent men of Stanford and the
same number of Cal ditto.

STEADY GIRLS ARE MORE de
sirable on the Farm. Cal boys like
tc play the field, say 48 per cent of
the Bears polled. Stanford would
rather go steady, according to (JO
per cent of the Roughs, while one
of L.S.J.U.'s wolves enjoys "play
ing the field with a steady hand."
On other questions of the poll
Stanford and California were al
most in accord.
Men look twice at blondes, con
fess a weakness for girls up to
their eyes, and prefer girls with
"average chassis." according to the
consensus of Cal Stanford opinion.
Bears and Roughs prefer hair
long and glamorous two to one over
any other style. Short and gamine
hair lagged way behind.
RED LIPSTICK AND NATURAL
make-up, fingernails short and with
polish will please most of the males.
One U.C. man thinks that long
nails are dangerous.
In the matter of perfume, men
voted almost 100 per cent for light
flower fragrances as opposed to dan
gerous, dramatic scents.
Questions on clothes filled a large
part of the questionnaire and the
answers were for campus wear,
sweaters and skirts; neither Cal nor
Stanford followed the outlines of the
poll on this question and wrote in
cottons for spring and summer ses
sions.
MEN LIKE THEIR SWEATERS
conservatively neat, bolted if you
like but NO MORE sloppy joes. Re
action to silk stockings was big on
both campuses. Socks were okayed
for campus, and lee makeup was a
definite no at both universities.

Saddle shoes must be clean.
True sons of California and ardent
supporters of the Chamber of Com
merce, men from both schools voted
81 per cent against hats. If hats
must be worn, however, they pre
fer little hats to big hats.
Concerning forma Is, men said they
positively swoon over formats that
are strapless. Svelte came second,
bouffant third. Pastels were favored
over black almost two to one. In
jewelry men like pearls best, but
earrings, chokers, and charm brace
lets made a good showing.
HOW SHOULD A GIRL LOOK
on a date—sexy, sultry, dangerous,
tacky, devil-may-care, rough-and
ready? No, an overwhelming num
ber of college men polled voted for
that "demure" look, whatever the
heck that is. One Stanford man,
probably a Phi Delt, wanted an in
telligent look above all.
College men object most to: wait
ing for a date, date with kissing
scruples, being commandeered to
tote purse or makeup, and a date
who brings her roommate.
FINALLY, GIRLS, YOU ARE
the woman of his dreams if you can
strike the happy medium of all
these rules: remember he'd rather
talk than listen; remember to be
more demure than dramatic; be a
last-minute crammer rather than
bookish; be more faintingly femi
nine than tweedish; be natural at
all times and forget the glamour.
Always be effervescent and never
shy; never be fickle but always
sincere; be independent, a clinging
vine only at times; try always to be
friendly, never aloof; be a 8.W.0.C.
or not, he leaves that up to you; be
beautiful and brainy and if you
can't be brainy, be beautiful first.
During the war college women
dressed to suit themselves. With no
men around to please, they soon got
out of the habit and lost their tech
nical know-how. Came the cessa
tion of hostilities, men returned to
the campus in huge numbers, and
the campus cuties besieged their
R.A.'s, sponsors, et al., with ques
tions of how to dress to please
and/or catch the male eye.
Chaos reigned. The sponsors
weren't sure because men are usu
ally reticent about informing girls
of their desires.
THEN THE WHITE HOUSE. SAN
Francisco clothing store, came to
the rescue with their gallop-ing poll
conducted confidentially among 100
prominent men of Stanford and the
same number of Cal ditto.
Purpose of the questionnaire sent
tc the 8.M.0.C. was to determine
what college men preferred in
clothes (on and off campus) and
what they liked in women gener
ally.
Answers to the poll just released
are not only enlightening in their
illustration of what the post-war
male likes in women, but they show
st.me interesting differences of opin
ion between Stanford men and Cal
ifornia boys.
FOR EXAMPLE. ON THE ques
tion of what men noticed first, eyes,
smile, personality, legs, etc., Cali
fornia men were strong in favor of
personality (36 per cent) and Stan
ford Roughs were fascinated most
by legs (59 per cent). An observ
ing Farmer checked shoes.
Stanford men are more hesitant
about blind datss than Cal men and
they are less influenced by what
their roommate says about their
dates. On the question of blind

dates Stanford voted no 71 per cent
to Cal's 53 per cent. One Rough ex
pressed it, "Hssitant ain't the word
for it."
