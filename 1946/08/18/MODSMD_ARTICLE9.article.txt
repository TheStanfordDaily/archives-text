# Stanford May Be Site For UN Headquarters
## 
### 
Stanford University may yet be the home of the United
Nations. With the announcement by the San Francisco Char." 1 ,
ber of Commerce that its representative in Washington has
been told by state department officials that the bay area is still
in the running for the UN headquarters site, the possibility ot

Stanford being the chosen location
is being discussed again.
If the UN home Ls moved to Star -
ford it will be a great honor for the
University. One of the greatest ad
vantages to the UN of a home at
Stanford will be the-direct access tj
important documents in the Hoover
Library on War, Revolution, and
Peace.
THE UN ORGANIZATION WILL
not interfere with campus life;
while the buildings might be lo
cated on University property, the
actual site would undoubtedly be
somewhere back in the hills.
Russell J. Pettit. manager of the
San Jose Chamber of Commerce, is
authority for the statement that
Stanford is one of the several Bay
Area sites for the headquarters
which are being considered by the
UN committee of the San Francisco
chamber.
Mr. Pettit has been appointed to
the committee as a Santa Clara
County representative. President
Donald Tresidder of Stanford is also
a member.
DR. RAY LYMAN WILBUR,
Chancellor of the University, said
yesterday that if Stanford is se
lected as the UN home it will be ;;
very fortunate thing for all partie*
concerned.
There is no reason to suppose that
the UN, if located here, would in
terfere with University life in any
way since there is plenty of room
in all directions of the University
property, Dr. Wilbur said.
