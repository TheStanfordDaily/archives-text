# THE
						STANFORD DAILY
## Editorials.... REPETITION 
### 
(The following is part of the text of a letter mailed today to
Jack Wallace, incumbent student body president, and Martin
Anderson, elected president for 1946-47 who takes office fall
quarter.)
There has been some misconception on the part of Excom
members and others of criticisms of the structure of Stanford's
student government appearing in recent Dailys. Criticism of
the structure of an institution has been translated into criticism
of personalities or of the work of the loyal few who everyone
knows carry the burden of student government here.
The Daily makes no claim to originality in any of its sug
gestions, nor does it think that the question of "whose idea
is it?" is especially important.
It does think the following things are important:
(1) Some reorganization of Excom's structure which would
install a more efficient committee system and improve the
technique, calibre, and spread of student appointments.
(2) A definite effort to get more students into and inter
ested in student government, both by enlarging the organs
of government and by conducting definite recruiting cam
paigns in which the Daily will give every help in the book.
(3) Some organized work on the Honor Code, including the
appointment of a faculty-student committee which for the
school year 1946-47 would overhaul the Honor Code pub
licity and enforcement setups to save this vital part of Stan
ford.
The Daily congratulates summer quarter Excom on the
amount of work done under severe obstacles, those inherent
in the present organization of the committee and those stem
ming from the continued view in many quarters of Summer
Quarter Excom's being a poor stepchild of regular student gov
ernment and not worthy of much cooperation or respect.
Excom committees have done all that students could do in
getting ready for the Stanford Village and in cleaning up the
Pre-Reg snafu.
Summer Excom has done a good job, in comparison with
previous summer quarter student governments.
That qualification does detract from the compliment and
fall quarter Excom should face up to the reasons for it.
