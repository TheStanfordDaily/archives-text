A girl's bicycle—with a flat rear
tire —has been sitting in front of
the shack all summer long. Now
the front tire's getting flat, and
still no bicycle thief has taken
advantage of his opportunity.

Dr. Tresidder was the winner
of the annual summer tournament
of the Lower Salvatierra Street
Croquet Society.

Somebody told us that during
the war there was an organization
on campus which would arrange
dates between army men stationed
here and women students. The

group used card
files to pair off
the couples.
One day a re
quest came in
from a soldier
who described
himself as "fat,
balding, and
forty."
"Aha, here's
a joker with a

good sense of humor," said the
committee woman in charge of the
files that particular day.
She looked through the files un
til she discovered the name of a
-*i r'l who also had a good sense of
humor, and the date was arranged.
The girl didn't feel too good
(bout the whole thing when her
iate showed up. however.
He WAS fat. balding and forty.

A well - known campus couple
was arranging a double date for a
trip to the city some time back.
They hadn't been able to find an
other established couple who
would go with them, so they ar
ranged a blind date.
They told the girl that the boy
was good - looking, had enough
money and had a good personal
ity, but that he was slightly hard
t<f hearing.
They told the boy the same
things about the girl.
The blind-daters kept the bar
of one of San Francisco's better
hotels in a constant uproar all
night, each shouting at the other
in blissful ignorance of the true
state of affairs.

Back in 1938—when the gold
fish-eating craze was hitting col
lege campuses all over the coun
try—a Roble gal became the cam
pus heroine when she swallowed
one of the small fish. She cleaned
up on the deal by charging ad
missions to the performance and
making side bets on her willing
ness to go through with the gag.
But Tom Killefer, student body
president at the time, was credited
with going the gal one better.
He caught a water snake swim
ming in Liigunita and calmly bit
the head off the snake.
And all for one dollar.

But then the dollar went far
ther in those davs.
