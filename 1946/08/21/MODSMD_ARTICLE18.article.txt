The fraternity system at its best I
is an aid to scholarship, to man- :
ners, and to character; at its worst, j
it is a basis for vulgar dissension. I
The influence of a fraternity de- '
pends on the men who are in it. j
If these are above the average in
character and work, it is lucky for |
the average man to be chosen into
it. If they are below the average j
in this regard, the average man ;
loses by joining his fortunes with :
it. When fraternities are sources j
of disintegration, there is some- 1
thing wrong in them or the insti- )
tution.—David Starr Jordan
