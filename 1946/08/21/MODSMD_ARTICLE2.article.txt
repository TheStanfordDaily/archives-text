# Farm To Move Head Offices
## 
### 
When the expanding law school
moves into the present Administra
tion offices, the latter will be placed
in a temporary location until con
struction materials for a new build
ing are available, according to Ray
Smith of the Planning Commission.
The move is anticipated sometime
this next year.
No definite location for the tem
porary offices has been selected, ac
cording to Mr. Smith. Possibilities
include the Knoll House, or offices
erected in one of the Quad courts
using surplus housing facilities.
When materials become available
it is planned to erect a new Ad
ministration Building behind the
Business School corner. Plans in
clude a series of partitioned offices
and conference rooms surrounding
a glassed-in court. The Registrar's
office will probably be on the site
of the present lavatory, and the
business offices will be on the sec
ond floor. A system of corridors
would connect the President's of
fice, which will stay where it is at
present, with the other adminis
tration offices.
There will be more than enough
classroom space to accommodate the
increase in student enrollment next
quarter, according to the Planning
Commission. A shortage of office
space for instructors is contemplated
but this problem can be solved by
a system of partitioning.
