Typographical errors sometimes
border on the libelous. A recent
story, reporting the arrest of two
men on a burglary charge, printed
their names, ages and occupation—
crooks. Next day it was explained
that the two were really cooks.

Mention of crooks brings to
mind a story which I will pass on
for the benefit of my fellow psy
chical researcher, Bull Sessioner.
In the early '70's of the past cen
tury Professor (later Sir William)
Crookes—already at the age of 40
one of the outstanding chemists
and physicists of England—believ
ing that the business of a scientist
is to ascertain the facts, undertook
an inquiry into certain alleged
physical phenomena of spiritual
ism which at the time were at
tracting a good deal of public
notice. In the course of a pro
tracted investigation he became
convinced of their reality, and pub
lished his findings—thereby bring
ing down upon his head the wrath
of his colleagues who had refused
to witness his experiments.
A quarter of a century later,
unrepentant but forgiven for his
lapse from scientific orthodoxy,
Sir William was-installed as presi
dent of the starchy British Asso
ciation, leading scientific body of
the realm—familiarly abbreviated,
I am told, as the British Ass. At
the banquet celebrating the event,
according to custom a plaque was
unveiled bearing an appropriate
legend: in this case, "Übi Crux ibi

lux" (where the Cross is, there is
light). But on this occasion a false
plaque was lirst presented, amid
general laughter, with the inscrip
tion "Übi Crookes ibi spooks."

"ALTAR SOCIETY GREETS
"NEW VICAR ANI) WIFE

"Members of St. Luke's Altai-
Society welcomed the new vicar
and his wife, the Rev. and Mrs.
Merrill Norton, at their meeting at
the parish hall Friday evening."
So began an innocuous item in a
recent issue of the Hollister Eve
ning Free Lance, published by my
good friend Millard Hoyle, Stan
ford '40, quondam member of the
Daily business staff. The pay-off
came at the end of the account, in
a paragraph intended for another
story in the adjoining column:
"Adding to the spirit of the oc
casion was the cocktail hour at 6:45
p.m. preceding the dinner."
