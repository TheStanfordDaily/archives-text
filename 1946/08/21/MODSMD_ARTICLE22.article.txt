Only game announced so far for
the basketball team's Eastern trip
in December is the Michigan con
test in Ann Arbor. While in the
service, we saw Michigan lose to
Northwestern at Evanston last sea
son.
Michigan looked poor. Their shots
were missing. It was not an off
night for them, for they finished in
the second division of the confer
ence standings.
While we expect to have a vastly
improved team over last season,
Michigan may also improve. To beat
Stanford, they will have to improve,
for last year's squad could not beat
this coming season's Farm outfit.
THE RETURN OF HOWIE Dall
mar to campus and th*e aid of Dick
Berlin, Grant Denmark, Morley
Thompson, and Dave Davidson
should insure success on the Christ
mas trip.
Whereas Pacific Coast teams sel
dom use more than seven or eight
players in a game, the Midwest
schools think nothing of using from
twelve to fifteen men in each game.
We noticed that especially with Illi
nois and Northwestern.
From what we saw of Midwest
basketball, team play predominates
with a lot of action around the horn.
Few teams have individual stars.

CALIFORNIA'S BASKETBALL
team is going to have a rough time
on their Eastern trip this December,
for they meet Illinois twice. Last
year they might have won over a
mediocre outfit, but this year they
will face "the greatest team of all
time" as picked in an Esquire sports

poll. In case you do not know who
we are referring to, the team is
known as the "whiz kids."
The "whiz kids" hold about every
record possible in the Big Ten. In
the aforementioned Esquire poll,
they were chosen almost unani- t
mously. Separated after their jun
ior year due to the war, the team
returns this coming season for their
senior year.
Having played during their years
in uniform on various service teams, l
the '"whiz kids" are not stale. They i
will be as good as ever next season
and should win the National Colle
giates. Cal will be lucky to come j
within twenty points of the Illini in
either of their games.

In case you have been wonder
ing who has been doing some of
the stories, the swell mural yarns
were done by A 1 Slater and Tom
Self at the beginning of the quarter
and Gerry Hill the rest of the time, j
That was Gerry with the terrific ac
count of the Legal Eagles' contests.

Whereas Pacific Coast teams sel
dom use more than seven or eight
players in a game, the Midwest
schools think nothing of using from
twelve to fifteen men in each game.
We noticed that especially with Illi
nois and Northwestern.
From what we saw of Midwest
basketball, team play predominates
with a lot of action around the horn.
Few teams have individual stars.

CALIFORNIA'S BASKETBALL
team is going to have a rough time
on their Eastern trip this December,
for they meet Illinois twice. Last
year they might have won over a
mediocre outfit, but this year they
will face "the greatest team of all
time" as picked in an Esquire sports

poll. In case you do not know who
we are referring to, the team is
known as the "whiz kids."
The "whiz kids" hold about every
record possible in the Big Ten. In
the aforementioned Esquire poll,
they were chosen almost unani- t
mously. Separated after their jun
ior year due to the war, the team
returns this coming season for their
senior year.
Having played during their years
in uniform on various service teams, l
the '"whiz kids" are not stale. They i
will be as good as ever next season
and should win the National Colle
giates. Cal will be lucky to come j
within twenty points of the Illini in
either of their games.

In case you have been wonder
ing who has been doing some of
the stories, the swell mural yarns
were done by A 1 Slater and Tom
Self at the beginning of the quarter
and Gerry Hill the rest of the time, j
That was Gerry with the terrific ac
count of the Legal Eagles' contests.

FOOTBALL PRACTICE IS LESS
than two weeks away, Sept. 3 to I
be exact. In case you are in this |
area during vacation, football prac
tice is open to the public.
If you want some sports during
the three or more weeks of vaca- !
tion, the San Francisco '49ers play J
in San Francisco's Kezar Stadium !
Sept. 1, 8, 15, and 22 against Chi
cago, New York, Miami, and Brook
lyn.
Stanford's first game is Sept. 28
with Idaho in our stadium. See you
then.
Only game announced so far for
the basketball team's Eastern trip
in December is the Michigan con
test in Ann Arbor. While in the
service, we saw Michigan lose to
Northwestern at Evanston last sea
son.
Michigan looked poor. Their shots
were missing. It was not an off
night for them, for they finished in
the second division of the confer
ence standings.
While we expect to have a vastly
improved team over last season,
Michigan may also improve. To beat
Stanford, they will have to improve,
for last year's squad could not beat
this coming season's Farm outfit.
THE RETURN OF HOWIE Dall
mar to campus and th*e aid of Dick
Berlin, Grant Denmark, Morley
Thompson, and Dave Davidson
should insure success on the Christ
mas trip.
