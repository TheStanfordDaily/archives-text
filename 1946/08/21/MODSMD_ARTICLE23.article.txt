# ‘Hurry-Up’ Yost Dies at 75
## 
### 
The half-century career of a one
time Stanford coach and one of the
few remaining "Grand Old Men"
of football ended yesterday when
death came to 75-year-old Fielding
H. "Hurry-Up" Yost at his Ann
Arbor, Mich., home. Yost had been
ill from a heart ailment.
Yost came to Stanford at the turn
of the century and coached the
eleven of 1900, which went through
the season with seven wins against
two losses.
The next year he went to Michi
gan where he built what was prob
ably the greatest gridiron machine
of all time around a fleet little half
back named Willie Heston; a squad
which ran up some phenomenal
scores and was known as the "point -
a-minute" team in an era when of
fense was groundbound.
In 1902, Yost brought his team,
Heston and all, to Pasadena to meet
Stanford in the first so-called Rose
Bowl game. The Maize and Blue
Wolverines won, 49-0.
(Recently the two schools resumed
athletic relations with the first foot
ball game scheduled for Ann Arbor,
Oct. 4, 1947, and the remainder of
the four-game series spread out and
tinishing with a proposed 50th anni

versary game in the Rose Bowl at
Pasadena sometime in 1952.)
Yost remained at Michigan for 40
years as football coach and ath
letic director, retiring in 1941. On
April 30 of this year, Yost's 75th
birthday, the state of Michigan set
aside the day as '"Fielding Harris
Yost Day."
