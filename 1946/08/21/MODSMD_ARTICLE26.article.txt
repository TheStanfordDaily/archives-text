# Series Ends; Play Read
## 
### 
The last Tuesday Series audience |
of the quarter heard Mrs. Guy Ste
vens Farrington give a dramatic
reading of the Pulitzer Prize play,
'"State of the Union," last night in
Memorial Hull auditorium.
Mrs. Farrington's performance
combined her skill in characteriza
tion, dialect, and control, of voice !
which have become familiar to Tues
day Series audiences from past ap- |
pea ranees.
The play, which opened in Wash
ington and has had a long run on

' Broadway, was written by the same
two successful collaborators who
produced "Life with Father," How- 1
aid Lindsay and Russel Crouse.
The story is aimed at the ruth
less and hypocritical techniques of
American political parties. But it
also has a moral which applies to
a larger scene.
It points to the necessity for na
tions to stop talking about selfish
| interests and start thinking in terms 1
; of the next generation.
The Series will be resumed on
Oct. 1.
