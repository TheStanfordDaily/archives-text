The American controversy with
Yugoslavia continues to simmer.
The State Department has sent
its third note to Tito's government,
a note denouncing the Yugoslavs
for shooting down one, and pos
sibly two, American transport
planes, for fomenting political dis
orders in Trieste, and for Yugo
slav patrol activity inside the Al
lied zone around Trieste. Acting
Secretary of State Acheson al
lowed newsmen to quote him di
rectly when he stated that the
aerial attacks were an "outra
geous performance."
Meanwhile, I would deprecate the

hysterical atti
tude of some
people on cam
pus who are dis
cussing the
"coming" war
with the horri
fied relish of
dowagers getting
the details of a
local seduction.
Nor do I see the

immediate need, as some funny men
have suggested, of posting guards
around the campus perimeter to in
tercept Yugoslav patrols. If we go
to war again, it will take a lot more
to drive us to it than the heckling
of a third-rate Balkan dictatorship.
We can maintain our position stra
tegically and diplomatically, I think,
and still use "measures short of
war" to deal with this nonsense.
The Price Decontrol Board an
nounced its first rulings yester
day. Ceilings will go hack on
meats, and on soybean and cotton
seed products. Subsidies for meat
producers will be reinstated, and
it is believed that OPA, which will
fix the new ceilings, will try to
"roll hack" meat prices to June
levels. New price ceilings are ef
fective Friday
As the PDB is supposed to retain
ceilings where supply has not caught
up to demand, their action confirms
the probability that meat will be in
short supply later in the year. The
board did not restore ceilings on
grain and dairy products. If their
decision indicates ample supplies of
grain, it may be that we can look
for an increase in the production of
certain beverages.
By way of conclusion . . . This
is the last paper of the quarter and
probably the last of "News . . .
Comment," so a brief summary is in
order. The most important domes
tic development, to my mind, has
centered around the economic re
conversion process. The fight over
OPA made it clear that, even with
out a Harding, the American people
are determined to return to "nor
malcy." The utmost efforts of the
Administration could only put a
brake on the return. A few years
from now. we'll know who was
right.
The most important international
development has been the appear
ance of a Russian bloc and an op
posed Western bloc in the current
negotiations. I agree with Vanden
berg that we should offer Russia
the same square deal that we ex
pect, but I cannot say that America
and the like-minded nations have
been in the wrong whenever they
have disagreed with Russia. I doa't
foresee, and don't want, any war
with Russia, but they're not always
the easiest people to get along with.
See ya!
