# Excom to Hear Collins Report
## 
### 
Bob Collins will present the final
report of his Village Committee to
summer Excom at its meeting to
night.
The report will consist of two
sections, the first containing specific
recommendations to be made to fall
Excom, the second listing recom
mendations to the resident assist
ants who will be in charge at the
Village when it opens.
OUTSTANDING recommendation
to Excom will be that the Village
be given representation on the stu
dent government body in proportion
to its population.
Collins expressed the belief that,
although this procedure would make
Excom more bulky, it would also
make it a more truly legislative
body.
Also in the report concerning Ex
com will be the answers to letters
that the committee sent out to var
ious student organizations and to
the administration.
The section of the report dealing
with the problems of the resident
assistants will outline the form of
local government that the commit
tee recommends, consisting of a
hall council and a hall conference
and modeled generally after pres
ent hall governments.
THE REPORT ALSO WILL ad
vise that Village representatives on
A.S.S.U. Excom be elected after pro
vision is made for them by a con
stitutional amendment to be voted
on the second week of the quarter.
Additional recommendations ai'e
that the Village be host to the cam
pus at an open house early in fall
quarter, and that a hall manager be
chosen to handle the details of Vil
lage administration.

The A.S.S.U. committee appointee
last week by Excom decided yester
day that the list of students who
registered in the Dean of Students"
office will be the basis for assign
ment of apartments. Other factors
to be taken into consideration wil
be the number of children, financial
need, present housing, and veter
ans' status.
Members of the committee are
Jack Wallace, Ed Stamm, Bob Col
lins and Ralph Thompson.
