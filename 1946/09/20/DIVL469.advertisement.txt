# i Back to the whirl of eight o'clock classes,
/ /" >• to football games and last-minute passes,
Back to cramming for Ancient History,
or maybe Chem, another mystery,
Back to rooting for another score,
and wondering if you should study more,
Back to those rides in the autumn moonlight,
to burning of oil till long past midnight...
Since you're back for the biggest term of all time,
We're wishing you luck and ending this rhyme.
P. $. Front head to toes,
from feet to nose,
It's always Roos
for caut pus dot Ins.
