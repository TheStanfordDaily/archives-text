# University Acquires Dibble Hospital; Farm's 'Greatest Gamble' Pays Off as Facilities at 'The Village' Made Ready for 2,000
## 
### 
Stanford Village, formerly the
Army's Dibble Genual Hospital,
was signed over to the University
Ji ne 14, paying off what President
Donald B. Trcsidder "called Stan
ford's "greatest gamble." Rather
than initiate trailer camps or Quon
sct villages, Stanford based all its
hop-is on Dibble to accommodate
the veteran enrollment which last
year grew at an unprecedented rate.
Today, but three months later, the
Village is ready to accommodate
2.000 students — single graduate
women, married couples, and lower
division, upper division, and grad
uate single men. Apartments for
married student couples with chil
dren arc as yet incomplete, but are
being rapidly finished for occupancy
during the quarter. An ultimate to
tal of 300 apartments with minimum
essentials in home furnishings is ex
pected.
CROWDED?
To those men who draw a lucky
number by lot system will go the
f°w single or double rooms avail
able in each dormitory. To the oth
ers will go the upper or lower half
of a bunk bed in rooms accommo
dating 32 or fi4 students.
Single women students at the Vil
lage will be housed in quarters for
merly' used by Army nurses, all of
which are double rooms with bunk
beds. Married student couples with
out children will have similar ac
commodations in what served as
bachelor officers' quarters.

A reconverted officers' club will
be available to Villagers, as well as
swimming pool, tennis courts, bowl
ing alleys (at reduced rates), and
a theater. Meals, cafeteria style,
will be served in two huge dining
halls to all residents. A general ac
commodations store and soda foun
tain will be Village substitutes for

the Cellar, the Bookstore, and th
Union store on the campus propel
SERVICE!
Pressing services, Roos Brother
clothing store, a barber shop, and
beauty parlor are already being pu
in shape for the student influ>
Laundry service will be available
and all linen will be provided in th

rooms tree.
Thus Stanford has solved its share
of the nationwide housing problem.
And by providing a co-ordinated
and unified community of dormito
ries, it avoids the Quonset-hut in
vasion now common to many Amer
ican universities.
MANAGEMENT
Resident Counselor Herbert J.
Wundcrlich and Assistant Counselor
Clain E. Cunningham have appoint
ed managers for each of the dormi
tories to assist in the setting up of
individual house rules and govern
ment. Into each dormitory will go
men of as nearly as possible the
same interests — for example, all
graduate men in law school will be
together, as will all upper division
students majoring in biological sci
ences.
Student government for the Vil
lage will be set up by residents, and
Excom representatives on the A.S.-
S U. governing body will be elected
winter quarter when the Village is
lull. Meanwhile, tentative plans
would have Village residents ap
pointed by A.S.S.U. Excom as cx
officio representatives on student
government.
LOTS TO DO
A full social program, plus an
open door to all-campus functions,
is in prospect for Villagers, in addi
t;on to an intramural sports sched
ule. Bus service to and from the
campus is assured by the Palo Alto
City Lines at a special seven-cent
rate.


THE STANFORD VILLAGE, formerly Dibble Hospital, opens tliis

Stanford's "greatest gamble."
