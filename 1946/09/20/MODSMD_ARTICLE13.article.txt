means of introducing you to your

| Stanford spirit and hospitality when
I the entire student body has returned
to creel you next week.
| "This first post-war year will con

: life which Stanford knew—football
games, dances, large rallies, and big
j name bands. The color has returned
' to campus liie, and we intend to
make your freshman year a mem
orable one. Welcome again!"
