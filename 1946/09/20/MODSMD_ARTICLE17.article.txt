## 
### MELLON SHELTON 
Freshman hall sponsors and pre
rcgistration committeemen traveled
between the Southern Pacific de
day, greeting the first arrivals of
some 1,100 new lower division stu
dents in fall quarter's four-day pre
reg program.
Among the number that were ex
pected to arrive by tonight were
some 750 men and 350 women. (Add
it up. It totals 1,100.) Although
most of the newcomers were fresh
men, the pre-reg program, headed
by Co-chairmen Bob Rowe and Ro
bcrta Mace, includes a number of
new sophs.
SMALL VILLAGE GROUP
Willi only 100 of the group quar
tered at Stanford Village, activities
for the festive weekend will be cen
tered at the Farm.
Most freshmen will spend the day
today getting their chests tapped
and sticking their tonyues out for
the benefit of Health Service doc
tors who want to be sure that ev
ery Stanford man and woman is
normal.
There will be a break, however,
for the unfortunate few who have
yet to take the aptitude test—at 1:30
you're in.
ASSEMBLY TONIGHT
First bright light on the day's
horizon will be the welcoming as
sembly tonight in Frost Amphithe
ater. Under the chairmanship of
pre - reg committeeman Crawford
Cooley, the assembly will introduce
frosh to University President Don
ald B. Tresidder, A.S.S.U. President
Martjn Anderson, Dean of Students
John M. Stalnaker, and Head Foot
ball Coach Marchie Schwartz.
After being introduced by Cooley,

evening. Each speaker will wel
come the students with a talk out
lining the current year from his par
ticular office.
TORCHES AT PROGRAM
In addition to the speeches, Band

Stanford Band in a few campus
songs. The early evening program
will be lighted by torches.
Next BIG event on the frosh
agenda will be the English matricu
lation test, commonly known as
the English A exam, at 9:30 tomor
row morning in Memorial Audito
rium. A stumbling block for many
termines whether the frosh must
take Enylish A or whether he can
jump right into English 2a. (From
informal polls in the years we've
been here, we've decided that at.
least three-fourths of the students
flunk it. Never mind. Our family
doctor took bonchead English,
which ought to prove something.)
REGISTRATION TRIPS
At 1:30 all students will meet
again in Memorial Auditorium to
hear Registrar H. Donald Winbig-
Icr give a few tips on registration
procedure. (Listen to this; you'll

by Co-chairmen Bob Rowe and Ro
bcrta Mace, includes a number of
new sophs.
SMALL VILLAGE GROUP
Willi only 100 of the group quar
tered at Stanford Village, activities

tered at the Farm.
Most freshmen will spend the day
today getting their chests tapped
and sticking their tonyues out for
the benefit of Health Service doc
tors who want to be sure that ev
ery Stanford man and woman is
normal.
There will be a break, however,
for the unfortunate few who have
yet to take the aptitude test—at 1:30
you're in.

termines whether the frosh must
take Enylish A or whether he can
jump right into English 2a. (From
informal polls in the years we've
been here, we've decided that at.
least three-fourths of the students
flunk it. Never mind. Our family
doctor took bonchead English,
which ought to prove something.)
REGISTRATION TRIPS
