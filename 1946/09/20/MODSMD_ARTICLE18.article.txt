## You're Only a Freshman Once... 
### 
Out of every lifetime, only
nine months are used on one's
freshman year at college. For
many, these were wartime
months, for others they were
the bustling, beering, to-hell
v/ith-the-grade-average months
of some pre-war years. They're
the months when the most
memories are made, and the
months that, in the long run.
will count most.
The nine months ahead of
you, the class of 1950, will be
unique not only to you but in
the history of Stanford. Football
is back, with the best teams the
Conference has seen in many
years. For you, it means the
Pajamerino Rally, the white-

shifted cheering sections, having your student
body cards punched for nine top-flight games.
Fraternities have re-opened, with modifica
tions imposed by war-sobered fraternity men
and with expansive plans drawn up by the
same men, who have thirsted for an enlarged
campus social program.
Cars are back—almost too many of them
for campus cops to handle. And students
from all over the country and the world, who'll
be fascinating as friends and equally so as
commentators on various sides of international
problems.
But these students, at least 2,000 more than
Stanford has ever before registered, bring
with them many problems that will roughen
up the student's traditional smooth sailing—
noon classes, necessitating luncheon shifts;
students whose on-campus homes will consist
of a locker and half a bunk bed; crowded
classrooms, a crowded Cellar, not enough
seats at the Concert Series, the plays, or room
on campus dance floors. The machinery of
adjustment will be necessarily slow in mov
ing, and decisions made under fire are bound,
once in awhile, to go haywire.
It's to be an experimental nine months for
student governors, administration officers,
and independent policy-makers. Should they

pass without gripes or tension, all concerned
would be shocked and uneasy. But here's
what we hope is the long view, the one that
you Frosh will take and utilize to keep your
traditional enthusiasm running wild:
Education, or call it democracy, is having
its greatest spree in history. If the present
generation of seekers finds through their
years at Stanford a well-sifted catalogue of
knowledge and the best liberal outlook, they
may present the force to right the world's
present wrongs. Personally we're pinning
our hopes on it.
Can we remember that the important thing
for us all is to get, as best we can, the stuff
that's books we buy and in the mouths
of Stanford's professors? Can we discount
the discomfort, and study, should the Libe be
full, on the lawns?
It's up to you, actually, how your nine
months turns out. You can make the best of
things, concentrate on the books and football
games and end up happy. We hope for your
sakes, that you will.
Ditto for the sake of the campus-at-large.
A united, enthusiastic freshman class can be
the backbone of the University, 1946-47. We
are looking to you, and sincerely, we are
welcoming you.
