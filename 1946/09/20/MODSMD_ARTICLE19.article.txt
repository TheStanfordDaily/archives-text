# MELLON SHELTON
## BULL SESSION 
### 
If pre-reging Frosh give out with "Give
'em the Axe!" at their barbecue-program-rally
Sunday night, we know one guy who'll be
glad he's not there. The friend we speak of
witnessed the famed Axe pilfering at 10:25
one Sunday night last spring quarter. A
grouchy old face of doubtful antecedents, he
was counterman on duty at the Cellar store
and was just locking up a cash register con
taining some $500-of the day's take when the
"six tall, blond youths wearing Stanford jack
ets and flying jackets" walked into the Cellar
and calmly began filing away at the chains
that connected the Axe showcase with the
Cellar wall.
Our friend, not being tall, blond, or a flyer,
wisely decided to do nothing, especially when
he spotted a heavy blunt weapon swinging
from the hand of one of the youths and peri
lously near the head of our Cellar buddy. Be
sides he didn't want them to walk off with the
S5OO and his own battered body.
Of course, he got a few dirty looks the
next day, but, as he said: "I should go through
four years of war and then shed blood on the
Cellar floor."
This next item has probably been had
around all over the campus by this time, but
we'll resurrect it for what it's worth. To prove
we haven't lost the country-club atmosphere
around here, we cite the Frosh who drove up
to Encina yesterday, a chauffeur at the wheel
and a valet in the back seat to carry his bags.
So that's where our pin money is going!
We're just ail confused. After three years
of getting used to calling the fraternity houses
by their wartime names (i.e. Monroe Hall,
Washington Hall, Fillmore Hall, ad infinitum),
they have to go back to their old names again.
This requires keen thinking of a high quality.
It just wouldn't do to call the Fiji boys' house
Buchanan Hall, now would it?

A tall, lovely, spaniel-eyed young woman we
know got herself engaged recently. All dur
ing the summer she kept receiving blurb in
the mail from various department stores read
ing "while we know you are in the midst of a
whirl of engagement festivities, we do hope
you drop into our lovely bridal salon, etc."
Meanwhile, her poor, confused fiance plodded
along, haunting mailboxes and receiving
nothing.
But one day finally he spotted an innocent
looking brown envelope hiding in the corner
of his P.O. box. At last! With eager hands he
tore it open, glued his eyes on the enclosed
folder and read: "What Every Young Man
Should Know! Get your five-shelf set of our
books on Sex. A 'must' in every young cou
ple's home. Just mail in the enclosed coupon.
Discreet. No return address on the volumes
we'll send you." After that, he decided he
really is trapped. So they're going to open
up a lending library on Sex.
Not that we want to cast any aspersions on
the mighty Big Red Machine of '46, but (now
there's a word) one member of the squad
dropped an interesting sidelight on the team's
progress from a green machine to all-powerful
Rose Bowl heroes. It seems the doctor was
making out the chart for team injuries the
other day, and nearly all the cuts, sprains, and
bruises were the result of the injured party
being eager enough to trip over himself or
kick his other foot, etc. Hmmm. Wonder if
they can perfect that well enough to clip them
selves and get a penalty for the opposing
team?
Speaking of football, we had a very inter
esting afternoon the other day when we went
out to watch football practice. Such reams of
good-looking men, we have never seen yet!
After spending our first couple of years here
pouring through old Quads trying to recap
ture what it must have been like in the good
old days, we are convinced that peace is here
to slay.

After spending our first couple of years here
pouring through old Quads trying to recap
ture what it must have been like in the good
old days, we are convinced that peace is here
to slay.
If pre-reging Frosh give out with "Give
'em the Axe!" at their barbecue-program-rally
Sunday night, we know one guy who'll be
glad he's not there. The friend we speak of
witnessed the famed Axe pilfering at 10:25
one Sunday night last spring quarter. A
grouchy old face of doubtful antecedents, he
was counterman on duty at the Cellar store
and was just locking up a cash register con
taining some $500-of the day's take when the
"six tall, blond youths wearing Stanford jack
ets and flying jackets" walked into the Cellar
and calmly began filing away at the chains
that connected the Axe showcase with the
Cellar wall.
Our friend, not being tall, blond, or a flyer,
wisely decided to do nothing, especially when
he spotted a heavy blunt weapon swinging
from the hand of one of the youths and peri
lously near the head of our Cellar buddy. Be
sides he didn't want them to walk off with the
S5OO and his own battered body.
Of course, he got a few dirty looks the
next day, but, as he said: "I should go through
four years of war and then shed blood on the
Cellar floor."
This next item has probably been had
around all over the campus by this time, but
we'll resurrect it for what it's worth. To prove
we haven't lost the country-club atmosphere
around here, we cite the Frosh who drove up
to Encina yesterday, a chauffeur at the wheel
and a valet in the back seat to carry his bags.
So that's where our pin money is going!
We're just ail confused. After three years
of getting used to calling the fraternity houses
by their wartime names (i.e. Monroe Hall,
Washington Hall, Fillmore Hall, ad infinitum),
they have to go back to their old names again.
This requires keen thinking of a high quality.
It just wouldn't do to call the Fiji boys' house
Buchanan Hall, now would it?

A tall, lovely, spaniel-eyed young woman we
know got herself engaged recently. All dur
ing the summer she kept receiving blurb in
the mail from various department stores read
ing "while we know you are in the midst of a
whirl of engagement festivities, we do hope
you drop into our lovely bridal salon, etc."
Meanwhile, her poor, confused fiance plodded
along, haunting mailboxes and receiving
nothing.
But one day finally he spotted an innocent
looking brown envelope hiding in the corner
of his P.O. box. At last! With eager hands he
tore it open, glued his eyes on the enclosed
folder and read: "What Every Young Man
Should Know! Get your five-shelf set of our
books on Sex. A 'must' in every young cou
ple's home. Just mail in the enclosed coupon.
Discreet. No return address on the volumes
we'll send you." After that, he decided he
really is trapped. So they're going to open
up a lending library on Sex.
Not that we want to cast any aspersions on
the mighty Big Red Machine of '46, but (now
there's a word) one member of the squad
dropped an interesting sidelight on the team's
progress from a green machine to all-powerful
Rose Bowl heroes. It seems the doctor was
making out the chart for team injuries the
other day, and nearly all the cuts, sprains, and
bruises were the result of the injured party
being eager enough to trip over himself or
kick his other foot, etc. Hmmm. Wonder if
they can perfect that well enough to clip them
selves and get a penalty for the opposing
team?
Speaking of football, we had a very inter
