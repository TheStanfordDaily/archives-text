# All Stanford Cars Must Be Registered; New Parking Regulations Announced
## 
### 
Drastic revisions in campus park
ing regulations are being instituted
lor the coming year, Police Chief
Gordon Davis announced yesterday.
This move has been taken be
cause of the unprecedented number
of students expected, he said. Es
timates are that there will be some
3.000 cars requiring parking on the
campus during a normal school flay
this year, showing an increase of
1.000 over last year's figure.
FROSH RULES
Parking regulations applying to
students living in freshman dormi
tories are as follows:
1. ENCINA: The parking area
immediately in front of Encina,
including Serra Street, will be
eliminated. This area is to be
used only for passenger loading
and unloading.
There will be no parking allowed
in the Encina Bullpen. This area
will be used only as a loading and
unloading zone for food and gar
bage trucks entering from Arguello
Street, and all passenger vehicles
will be excluded,
Encina men may park cars in a
graveled area (formerly the mili
tary personnel field) between the
men's tennis courts and the former
eating club area.
2. ROBLE ANI) LAGUNITA:
There will be no parking allowed
on the Roble and Lagunita side
of Santa Teresa, except for the
offset area in front of Lagunita.

The prohibited parking area ex
tends from the far end of Lagu
nita to Rohle corner.
:{. HEALTH SERVICE: The
mean's and women's health serv
ices have been moved to the
women's gym on Santa Teresa,
across the street from Lagunita.
Parking is permissible on the gym
side of Santa Teresa; but facili
ties there are inadequate, and
students are asked to leave their
cars in a parking lot behind (he
gym. Entrance to this lot is from
a road oil Lomita Drive directly
opposnte the University Press
Building.
Parking is prohibited in the cir
cular driveway in front of the wom
en's gym. This area will be used
for .passenger loading and unload
ing.
NEW SIGNS HUE
Because delivery of parking signs
lias be"n temporarily hold up, these
regulations will not be enforced un-
Li! the signs are available, said Mr.
Davis. "However, we would appre
ciate the voluntary co-operation of
every student in trying to observe
these regulations before the signs
sre put up," he added.
To lessen campus traffic hazards
caused by the increased number of
automobiles, the police department
is planning to register each car
owned by Stanford students and ac
ademic personnel.
"Every automobile must be in

first-class mechanical condition," he
warned, "or it will not be permitted
on campus."
STICKER PLAN
Following registration of cars,
owners will be issued windshield
stickers denoting approval by the
police department. Bearing the
Stanford seal with the car registra
tion number superimposed, the
i stickers are in four colors to denote
area of ownership: academic per
sonnel, black; on-eampus (resident)
students, red; off-campus students,
; brown; and Stanford Village stu
dents, green.
Procedure for automobile regis
tration has not been determined yet,
Mr. Dhvis said. However, stickers
| will be issued as soon as an effi
cient system can be worked out.
Further parking and traffic regu
lations, extending to the entire cam
j pus, will be printed in Monday's
j Daily.
