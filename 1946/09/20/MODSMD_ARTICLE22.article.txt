Frosh will find, with a little in
vestigation, that Stanford approxi
mates a small city in the facilities
it has to offer. Aside from having
its own fire and police departments,
independent of Palo Alto, there are
! stores, a shoe shop, a barber shop,
and a clothing store. The Cellar
store is stocked with every sort of
small item for personal use: soap,
toothpaste, cigarettes, film, combs,
and a small assortment of drugs.

The barber shop, located in the
Cellar, makes a shave and a hair
cut easy for the asking for any
Stanford Roughâ€”and saves a trip to
Paly in the bargain.
Across the alley from the shoe
shop is Roos Brothers' campus

shack, stocked with sweaters, skirts,
dresses, blouses, and socks (bobby)
for the women; and slacks, shirts,
sweaters, T-shirts, socks, and belts
for the men. They even furnish
cagily decorated book covers for
free.
