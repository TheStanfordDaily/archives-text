# Farm Traditions Meet Test of 55 Years
## 
### 
Stanford's third president, Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, said, "I have never
been particularly interested in tradi
tions unless they had a constructive
side and were able to survive under
strain and adversity."
The traditions which we as Stan
ford students respect have endured
the tests of more than 50 years on
the Quad, and have long served to
guard and perpetuate the Stanford
spirit. Perhaps the most enduring of
f hese traditions is that of loyalty to
Stanford—to its campus, its people,
its ideals.
With the first feeling of kinship to
Stanford, with the first sense of be
longing to that chain of Stanfordites
that have gone before and will come
after, comes admission to the group
of students, faculty, and friends of
Stanford that comprise the Stanford
Family. To belong to the Family is
to feel that in some way a part of
Stanford belongs to you.
Membership in the Family has
never been restricted by lines of race
or religious denomination. Complete
freedom in religion, and tolerance
for all points of view have been in
culcated in Farm traditions since its
founding.

HERE IT IS, but where oh where
has it gone?—The Daily herewith
(right) presents its evidence of
the existence of the one-time
"Stanford Axe." Stolen during the
.spring quarter by a band of youths
with its showcase in the Cellar
store, Indians now look forward to
the Big Game where, many sus
pect, the culprits will bring it forth.

Within the Family it has long been
5 tradition that students and faculty
meet together outside the classroom
—at informal discussions, entertain
ments, football games, and various
campus social functions.
COLOR: Stanford, unlike most
universities, has adopted only one
color, cardinal, which is usually con
trasted in uniforms and banners with
white.
EMBLEM: Famous long before the
University, the Palo Alto redwood
tree —950 years old, and over 100 feet
high—is Stanford's official emblem.
Stanford teams are the "Indians" or
*he "cardinals," the latter name
harking back to former years when
Stanford's sports insignia was the
red bird of Kentucky mountain fame.
NO SMOKING ON QUAD: Ob
served not only for its own sake, or
because it helps keep our Quad neat,
the "No Smoking on Quad" tradition
exists at Stanford because Mrs. Stan
ford long ago requested it, and be
cause it bolsters in however small a
way the morale of the Stanford
Family. Although the tradition is
not enforced by penalties or polic
ing, no students or faculty members
are exempt from its observance.
HELLO: If a perfect stranger
shouts a vehement "hello" in pass
ing you on Quad, he is not being '
rude or unduly enthusiastic —he is !
following out one of Stanford's old
est traditions. Introduced to aug- j
ment the spirit of friendship among ;
members of the Family, it has been
perpetuated in spite of the expansion j
of the University to a point where j
"hello's" are exchanged not solely i
on a basis of acquaintance, but [
rather as an expression of congen- I
iality.
HYMN: Whenever the Hymn is |
sung, Stanford men and women \
startd; men remove their hats. The '
Hymn, embodying the Family' love i
and pride for Stanford, is tradition
ally sung at the Senior Bali, com
mencement exercises, Big Game
Rally, and after football games.
PRESIDENT: Whenever the Uni
versity president is • introduced.
Stanford students rise to greet him.
BRONZE PLAQUES: On com- ;
mencement day, the records of the (
graduating class—its history, will, i
jnem and further information about ;
its members are placed in a tiny j
rault beneath bronze plaques nam- |
ing each class year. These diamond- j
diaped plaques form :i gleaming strip 1
n the sidewalk before Memorial
Chapel. '

FOOTBALL TRADITIONS: Aut
umn quarter in ordinary times
means Saturday afternoons in the
football stadium, a gallery of rooters
waving cardinal-and-white banners,
and pom-poms. Associated with the
football clashes themselves are a
number of traditions which have
i been fostered by more than a half-
I century of intercollegiate competi
| tion.
Among them are:
THE PAJAMARINO RALLY:
| Clad in rooters' caps and pajamas,
| freshmen men parade in noisy
| swarms to the pre-Southern Cali-
I fornia game rally, march by torch -
I light to serenade Roble, caravan to
j Paly for a free show at one of the
| theatres.
THE BIG GAME: Stanford's arch
sports rival, and one-half of the
coast's greatest collegiate combina
tion is the University of California.
Far from simply a Saturday after

noon encounter between two football
teams, Big Game Time opens on
Thursday night with the spirit-rous
ing Big Game Rally. Following the
rally program at the Pavilion, root
ers throng to the gigantic bonfire in
the dry bed of Lake Lagunita.
Guided by Cardinals, and fed at mid
day by freshmen women, freshmen
men that day have stacked telephone
poles, planks and barrels in a giant
pyramid. Lit to the tune of yells
and cheers from the surrounding
throng, the fire smolders far into the
night, after lighting the entire sky
with its flames.
On Friday afternoon, students
flock to the Big Game Jolly-Up; in
the evening they watch Stanford's
musical extravaganza, the Big Game
Gaieties.
Saturday is the Game, punctuated
by card stunts, band music, and the
thundering Axe Yell; celebrated,
win or lose, far into the night.
