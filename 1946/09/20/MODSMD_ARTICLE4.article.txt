# Tresidder, Stalnaker Greet Fall '46 Stanford Freshmen
## 
### 
President Donald Trejsidder's mes- :
sace:
"To all of you who are coming to
Stanford for the first time I extend
a cordial welcome on behalf of the
University. At the same time I
want to say a special word of greet
ing and appreciation to those of you
who have come to us after service
in the armed forces of our nation.
'"We are proud that Stanford is
doing her full share to meet the
unprecedented demand for advanced j
education which the peace has j
brought. Our enrollment this year 1
will be nearly 75 per cent more j
than we had before the war. The
requirements of this temporary ex- !
pansion we have met by increasing
our faculty and staff and by expand
ing our physical facilities. Although |
not all conditions are ideal, I can
assure you that Stanford has bent
every efTort to meet the situation in j
the best possible way; and we are j
confident that the results will meas
ure up to the best achievements of j
the universities of the country.
"At the same time we arc most ,
fortunate in having the many ad- 1
vantages that former Stanford men
aiid women have enjoyed—a faculty
of outstanding scholars arid teach- :
ers, a campus of unusual beauty,
excellent recreational opportunities, j
and a spirit of friendliness that is i
one of Stanford's oldest and most J
cherished traditions. All this is;
ours. Wo are glad that you are here ■
with us to enjoy it.
"Donald B. Tresidder"

Dean of Students John Stalnaker's
message:
"Welcome to Stanford! New stu-

dents will find !
Stanford an in
teresting and a
stimulating
place. Old re- i
turning students
will note many
changes, but the j
most valuable
characteristics of i
the Stanford!
they know will, j
I hope, still be

found. More students than ever be
fore are expected to attend Stan- '
ford. One of the finest units of
temporary housing, Stanford Vil
lage, will be opened. Intercollegiate '<
sports will be resumed. Fraternities
will reopen. The residences, al- 1
though bulging, will be staffed with I
able counselors and sponsors. In I
brief, the campus will come to life.
College years should be years of !
enjoyment and education; I hope
this year will be an unusually full
one."
