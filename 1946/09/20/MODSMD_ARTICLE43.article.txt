What will the "big red machine"
do this year? That seems to be the
â€¢wutstanding problem for Stanford
football enthusiasts at the moment.
Outside of Ted Husing, all the so
called sports authorities have rele
gated Stanford to eighth place in
the standings, just above Idaho and
Montana and even those teams can't
be trusted to play their usual low
brand of football. We wish we knew
where Mr. Husing gets his news, for
he has the Indians slated as the top
team on the coast.
Where the team finally does end
up the season will depend on how
well and how fast the athletes learn
the plays and blocking assignments
taught by the coaching staff. This
Daily being exclusively for new stu
dents, we intend to give thumbnail
sketches of the coaching staff in this
column so you may know more
about those that guide the destinies
of this year's team.
MARCHIE SCHWARTZ
Head Coach Marchie Schwartz
starred for Notre Dame in 1929, 1930.
and 1931, making all-American the
last two years. The 1930 team, Knute
Rockne's last team, is considered the
greatest Notre Dame team of all
time. Schwartz was coached by
Hunk Anderson his last year at
South Bend.
Marchie went into coaching imme
diately upon graduation. He was
backfield coach in 1932 and 1933 at
Notre Dame and 1934 at Chicago un
der Clark Shaughnessy. He went to
Creighton University in 1935 as ath
letic director and head coach, leaving
after the 1939 season to rejoin
Shaughnessy at Stanford as backfield
coach. Marchie was named head
coach for the 1942 season after
Shaughnessy left for Maryland and
Jim Lawson went into the Navy.
In his one year as head coach,
Schwartz overcame early season re
versals to finish the season with six
wins against four losses. The team
was declared by critics to be the
best team on the coast at season's
end. Not counting last year's infor
mal squad, this season will be Mar
chie's fourth coaching year on the
Farm, his second as head man.
PHIL BENGTSON
Line Coach Phil Bengtson played
his football at Minnesota in 1932,
1933, and 1934 under Bernie Bierman
playing the tackle position. He made
all-American his final year and par
ticipated in the East-West game
January 1, 1935. Bengtson, like
Schwartz, went immediately into

coaching, being appointed line coach
at Missouri in 1935 and staying there
until coming to Stanford in the same
shift that brought Shaughnessy and
Schwartz in 1940.
Bengtson left Stanford in March of
1942 to enter the Navy as a lieuten
ant (jg). Phil was released to in
active duty last January as a lieu
tenant commander. This season will
be Phil's third as line coach on the
Farm.
MAL ELWARD
A new man on the Farm is End
Coach Mai Elward, a one-time team
mate of Knute Rockne's, having
graduated from Notre Dame in 191(5.
He began coaching at John Carroll
University in Cleveland before mov
ing on to lowa's Grinnell College and
Purdue.
Elward was connected with the
Boilermakers for fifteen years as a
football coach, the last five as head
mentor, and the last two of those
also as Director of Athletics.
In 1942 Elward returned to the
Navy, where he had served as a na
val pilot in the First World War,
from which he was recently released
as a lieutenant commander. Mai
joined the Stanford coaching staff
only last month.
RAY HAMMETT
Backfield Coach Ray Hammett re
placed Frankie Albert at quarter- j
back in the 1942 season after being j
his understudy for two years. Im
mediately after the season ended.
Hammett received his "greetings"
and served 32 months in the Air
Corps as a pilot. When released to
inactive duty, Ray was a first lieu
tenant. He received his A.B. degree
here last January.
Besides being an outstanding foot
ball player, Hammett received two
letters in baseball. This season will
be Ray's first on the coaching staff.
ED STAMM
Also coaching at Stanford for the
first time will be Ed Stamm, star
tackle in 1940. 1941, and 1942. Stamm
graduated in 1943 and entered the
Navy as an ensign. Released from
active duty last April, Ed returned |
in time to help in spring practice.
He will be in charge of the junior
varsity team. Stamm also won let
ters in track and field, where he was
a shot putter and discus thrower.
Assisting Stamm with the JV team I
will be Lin Wolff who played his j
football at Swarthmore. At the San
Jose Junior Chamber of Commerce
football dinner earlier this week,
Lin assured the throng that men do
go to Swarthmore and that they do

not meet Vassar during the season.
Well, that is thq story on our
coaching staff, who they are and
where they are from. Is it a good
staff? We think it is. So far as we
are concerned, Marchie Schwartz is
the best coach in the conference.
Jeff Cravath may produce more at
Southern California, but with his
material almost anyone could win
championships. If Marchie wins
over three games this year, he will
have done one of the top coaching
jobs on the coast. Perhaps he will.
