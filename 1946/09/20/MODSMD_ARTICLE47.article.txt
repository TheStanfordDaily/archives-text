# Frosh Briefed on Traditional Academic Retreats; New Roughs Check In at Encina, Unravel Red Tape
## 
### TOM SELF MARION MORROW 
Thursday was a hot day, especially at Encina Hall where in
coming freshmen were sweating out the red tape involved in
getting settled in their Stanford home.
All was confusion. Proud parents and luggage helped to
clutter up the entrance to the Frosh castle. But calm and cool

through it all were the "big broth
ers" or counselors who sat behind
the information desk and handed
out folders and brochures and, for
the most part, let the boys muddle
through.
When questioned by a Daily re
porter, most of the new roughs ex
pressed themselves as favorably
impressed by all that is Stanford.
They also displayed a thorough ac
quaintance with all the Stanford
traditions and myths, particularly
with the Farm's all-time character,
Doodles Weaver.
Right in front of the ball loung
ing on the cool stone steps were
five San Franciscans: JOHN
BOWES who wanted to know who
the Junior Birdmcn are; MIKE
SPIRO who thought that Encina
lacks the woman's touch and sug
gested that women be placed in
alternate rooms; 808 SWINGLEY
who said it's too hot and wished
that the fog would show up; 808
TALLMAN who was happy about
the whole thing; and EI) COY who
wondered just who held the to
bacco-spitting contest in his room.
Just arrived from Philadelphia
was MORTON WHITE who was too
busy with the details of checking in
to think of anything salty for publi
cation.
Two of the frosh said they will be
anxiously awaiting the Idaho game.
They are JOHN NOGGLE of Klam
math Falls, Ore., who v/ent to Idaho
before the war; and 808 CROZIER
of Lewiston, Ida. Crozier says the
Idaho team is pretty good.
From the Pacific Northwest hail
AL GENTNER of Bend. Ore., who
likes the palm trees and KEN
CUNDY of Richland, Wash., who
protested that it is awfully hot.
ALLAN ROSENBERG of New
York, N.Y., is impressed with the
friendly attitude of San Franciscans
as compared to New Yorkers. He
also likes the warm climate but ■
misses the, greens of Eastern land-J
scape.
Another Indian from the 'Big City' I
is BILLY SARNOFF. He, too, is im
pressed by the sunshine and the
beauty of the campus.

It looks as though a freshman's life this year will not be a
life of the proverbial red-capped rooter judging from the high
aptitude ratings being given mass entrance this quarter.
This means the average frosh will have to be well acquainted
with Stanford's traditional freshmen research quarters such as

► the Civ Libe, the bio lab, and the
reference room of the main libe.
The Civ Libe and freshmen go
together like cheese and crackers.
Even since the three-quarter, 12-
unit required course in the history
of Western Civilization was insti
tuted freshmen have found it ne
least four times a week and gener
cessary to trek to the Civ Libe at
ally ol'tcncr. Freshman bull ses
sions for years have been at least
partially made up of discussions
concerning I'etronius' "Satyricon,"
Voltaire's "Candide," or Rousseau
vs. Locke. This Civ Libe is lo
cated on the first (loor of the his
tory building.
Most freshmen end up filling in
their science requirements with bi
ology la, lb, and lc and are forced
to attend a two-hour lab once a
week. This lab may be found in Jor
dan Hall, the biology building, on
the north-east corner of Quad.
Then English 2a and 2c arc re
quired freshmen courses and gen
erally demand term papers, mate
rial for which may be found in the
main libe. These two English
courses have been the nemesis of
many eager frosh and generally
require at least two themes a
week.
Of course the other courses most
frequently taken by freshmen in
clude languages, psychology 51, so
ciology 1, and we hope, a side-line
trying out for The Daily.
On the social side, the Farm
should be the Republican idea of
"back to normalcy" this fall, with
the red and white machine back in
the conference, the fraternities
back in their houses, and men back
on the campus.
As for locating the various social
spots of the Peninsula in chronicle
fashion for the freshmen, the Daily
feels the frosh should investigate
that angle for themselves. The Daily
leaves social exploring to the fresh
men. With love.
