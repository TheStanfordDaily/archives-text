## Squad Looks Ragged Says Schwartz; Saturday's Lineup Still Unannounced 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
Football gave final notice of its
return to the Farm Saturday when
Coach Marchie Schwartz called a
long, burising scirmmage between
the varsity and jayvees that lasted
more than two hours. Marchie later
.'•aid the boys were ragged, but that
there were several heartening spots
in the scrum.
If there was an individual star,
it was Lloyd Mcrriman at full
back. lie runs the ends like a
halfback and hits the line like a
junior pile driver. Lloyd made
several long runs, at times even
running his own interference.
But there were several boys who
looked good. Dave De Swarte was
catching Buck Brownson's passes
from every angle, once while skid
ding along the turf on his nose.
Brownson's passing was good, but
lie has a tendency to jump up in
the air when he throws, losing both
time and distance.
On the first play of the scrim
mage Don Zappctini went through
guard and cut for the sidelines,
then outraccd the secondary SO
yards to the goal line. Later
Freddy Parsons, a right half,
pulled the same play to the other
side for BO yards, using his ter
rific speed to get around several
would-be tacklcrs.
Protection for the passers was not
too good; the qbs were rushed hard
ori several occasions by a hard
charging jayvee line, which occa
cnsionally spilled them for losses.
Standouts on that jayvee line were
Ilrwie Council and Sid Smith at the
tackles, who spilled play after play.
Tlicy are both big and rugged, and
act like they love to play football.
Other outstanding jayvees who
show promise are Jim Doolcy,
Don Fix. Ityc Kelley, and Dud
DcGroot, Jr., but the hardest
tackle of the day was made by a
little 181 - pound halfback. Bill
Larson. He stopped Gene Martin
in the secondary with a beautiful,
vicious dive. Bob Ghilotti on the
line also made some bruising
stops.
A great deal of interest was shown
by the students, considering the fact
that rcg day was still 48 hours away.
At least 500 people came out to
watch and cheer, and there was
more than a light feminine touch.
At many schools the students are
barred from the practices, but Mar
chie Schwartz evidently feels that
a show of interest is good for the
morale of his team.
It would be impossible to list all
the performances of merit, but a few
should be mentioned. Aubrey De
vine did the best passing of the day.
putting the ball right in the arms of
his receivers. Frankie Forbes pulled
the old Frankie Albert naked re
verse play successfully, but his pass
ing was off.
Bob Anderson, championship
swimmer, showed promise at left
half. Marty Anderson is a prom
ising fullback. Dave Brown, Jack
Filer, and Boh Rohrer showed
veil at end. Dick Flatland, a

pitcher on Harry Wolter's base
ball (cam, shows promise at cen
ter. Pete August and Bill Hach
ten did not play,
Johnny Clark at left guard did
fine blocking all afternoon, as did
Marty Feldman and Kelly Ross at
the other guard. Young Mickey Ti
tus at right half looks like a future
star, as does Wayne Erickson at
left half.
Missing from the scrum was Ains
lee Bell, whose gimpy left knee is
being protected by the entire coach
ing staff. A veteran qb with Rose
Bowl experience, he may well turn
out to be number one man at that
spot. Bell did some fine passing be
fore the scrimmage started, and was
running without a limp, so he may
be ready for Idaho this Saturday.
Coach Schwartz is not willing to
name a starting lineup for Satur
day as yet, but doubtless most of
the men he used first in the scrim
mage will be around for the open
ing kickofT. They were Dc Swarte
and Rohrer at the ends, Boensch
and Cox at the tackles, Clark and
Feldman at the guards, Flatland
at center, Brownson at qb, Zap
pctini and Parsons at the halves,
and Mcrriman at full.
Many faults were revealed during
the rugged afternoon's play, not the
least of which was lack of adequate
protection for the passer. Backfield
timing was faulty on occasion, and
blocking assignments were missed
from time to time, but the scrim
mage was called to reveal those
things. You can be sure that Mar
chie Schwartz and his cohorts will
be spending long hours the rest of
this week, trying to iron out the
kinks for Idaho.
There were no serious injuries;
no more than the occupational
scratches, bumps, and bruises
were incurred, although Lloyd
Merriman and Boh Anderson
have beautiful skinned noses.
Barring unforeseen accidents, all
should he in good health Saturday
with the possible exception of
those already oil the injured list.
Today's practice will not start un
til 4 o'clock, due to registration day.
The hard practices are expected to
taper off gradually; there will be
no more rough scrums like that of
Saturday until the Idaho' game is
past.

Freddy Parsons, a right half,
pulled the same play to the other
side for BO yards, using his ter
rific speed to get around several
would-be tacklcrs.
Protection for the passers was not
too good; the qbs were rushed hard
ori several occasions by a hard
charging jayvee line, which occa
cnsionally spilled them for losses.
Standouts on that jayvee line were
Ilrwie Council and Sid Smith at the
tackles, who spilled play after play.
Tlicy are both big and rugged, and
act like they love to play football.
Other outstanding jayvees who
show promise are Jim Doolcy,
Don Fix. Ityc Kelley, and Dud
DcGroot, Jr., but the hardest
tackle of the day was made by a
little 181 - pound halfback. Bill
Larson. He stopped Gene Martin
in the secondary with a beautiful,
vicious dive. Bob Ghilotti on the
line also made some bruising
stops.
A great deal of interest was shown
by the students, considering the fact
that rcg day was still 48 hours away.
At least 500 people came out to
watch and cheer, and there was
more than a light feminine touch.
At many schools the students are
barred from the practices, but Mar

a show of interest is good for the

the old Frankie Albert naked re

Bob Anderson, championship
swimmer, showed promise at left

Johnny Clark at left guard did
fine blocking all afternoon, as did
Marty Feldman and Kelly Ross at
the other guard. Young Mickey Ti
tus at right half looks like a future
star, as does Wayne Erickson at
left half.
Missing from the scrum was Ains
lee Bell, whose gimpy left knee is
being protected by the entire coach
ing staff. A veteran qb with Rose
Bowl experience, he may well turn
out to be number one man at that
spot. Bell did some fine passing be
fore the scrimmage started, and was
running without a limp, so he may
be ready for Idaho this Saturday.
Coach Schwartz is not willing to
name a starting lineup for Satur
day as yet, but doubtless most of
the men he used first in the scrim
mage will be around for the open
ing kickofT. They were Dc Swarte
and Rohrer at the ends, Boensch
and Cox at the tackles, Clark and
Feldman at the guards, Flatland
at center, Brownson at qb, Zap
pctini and Parsons at the halves,
and Mcrriman at full.
Many faults were revealed during
the rugged afternoon's play, not the
least of which was lack of adequate
protection for the passer. Backfield
timing was faulty on occasion, and
blocking assignments were missed
from time to time, but the scrim
mage was called to reveal those
things. You can be sure that Mar
chie Schwartz and his cohorts will
be spending long hours the rest of
this week, trying to iron out the
kinks for Idaho.
There were no serious injuries;
no more than the occupational
scratches, bumps, and bruises
were incurred, although Lloyd
Merriman and Boh Anderson
have beautiful skinned noses.
Barring unforeseen accidents, all
should he in good health Saturday
with the possible exception of
those already oil the injured list.
Today's practice will not start un
til 4 o'clock, due to registration day.
The hard practices are expected to
taper off gradually; there will be
no more rough scrums like that of
Saturday until the Idaho' game is

But there were several boys who

from every angle, once while skid

Brownson's passing was good, but

At least 500 people came out to
watch and cheer, and there was
more than a light feminine touch.
At many schools the students are
barred from the practices, but Mar
chie Schwartz evidently feels that
a show of interest is good for the
morale of his team.
It would be impossible to list all
the performances of merit, but a few
should be mentioned. Aubrey De
vine did the best passing of the day.
putting the ball right in the arms of
his receivers. Frankie Forbes pulled
the old Frankie Albert naked re
verse play successfully, but his pass
ing was off.
Bob Anderson, championship
swimmer, showed promise at left
half. Marty Anderson is a prom
ising fullback. Dave Brown, Jack
Filer, and Boh Rohrer showed
veil at end. Dick Flatland, a

pitcher on Harry Wolter's base

ten did not play,
Johnny Clark at left guard did
fine blocking all afternoon, as did
Marty Feldman and Kelly Ross at
the other guard. Young Mickey Ti
tus at right half looks like a future
star, as does Wayne Erickson at
left half.
Missing from the scrum was Ains
lee Bell, whose gimpy left knee is
being protected by the entire coach
ing staff. A veteran qb with Rose
Bowl experience, he may well turn
out to be number one man at that
spot. Bell did some fine passing be
fore the scrimmage started, and was
running without a limp, so he may
be ready for Idaho this Saturday.
Coach Schwartz is not willing to
name a starting lineup for Satur
day as yet, but doubtless most of
the men he used first in the scrim
mage will be around for the open
ing kickofT. They were Dc Swarte
and Rohrer at the ends, Boensch
and Cox at the tackles, Clark and
Feldman at the guards, Flatland
at center, Brownson at qb, Zap
pctini and Parsons at the halves,
and Mcrriman at full.
Many faults were revealed during
the rugged afternoon's play, not the
least of which was lack of adequate
protection for the passer. Backfield
timing was faulty on occasion, and
blocking assignments were missed
from time to time, but the scrim
mage was called to reveal those
things. You can be sure that Mar
chie Schwartz and his cohorts will
be spending long hours the rest of
this week, trying to iron out the
kinks for Idaho.
There were no serious injuries;
no more than the occupational
scratches, bumps, and bruises
were incurred, although Lloyd
Football gave final notice of its
return to the Farm Saturday when
Coach Marchie Schwartz called a
long, burising scirmmage between
the varsity and jayvees that lasted
more than two hours. Marchie later
.'•aid the boys were ragged, but that
there were several heartening spots
in the scrum.
If there was an individual star,
it was Lloyd Mcrriman at full
back. lie runs the ends like a
halfback and hits the line like a
junior pile driver. Lloyd made
several long runs, at times even
running his own interference.
But there were several boys who
looked good. Dave De Swarte was
catching Buck Brownson's passes
from every angle, once while skid
ding along the turf on his nose.
Brownson's passing was good, but
lie has a tendency to jump up in
the air when he throws, losing both
time and distance.
On the first play of the scrim
mage Don Zappctini went through
guard and cut for the sidelines,
then outraccd the secondary SO
yards to the goal line. Later
Freddy Parsons, a right half,
pulled the same play to the other
side for BO yards, using his ter
rific speed to get around several
would-be tacklcrs.
Protection for the passers was not
too good; the qbs were rushed hard
ori several occasions by a hard
charging jayvee line, which occa
cnsionally spilled them for losses.
Standouts on that jayvee line were
Ilrwie Council and Sid Smith at the
tackles, who spilled play after play.
Tlicy are both big and rugged, and
act like they love to play football.
Other outstanding jayvees who
show promise are Jim Doolcy,
Don Fix. Ityc Kelley, and Dud
DcGroot, Jr., but the hardest
tackle of the day was made by a
little 181 - pound halfback. Bill
Larson. He stopped Gene Martin
in the secondary with a beautiful,
vicious dive. Bob Ghilotti on the
line also made some bruising
stops.

Merriman and Boh Anderson
have beautiful skinned noses.
Barring unforeseen accidents, all
should he in good health Saturday
with the possible exception of

Today's practice will not start un

The hard practices are expected to
taper off gradually; there will be
no more rough scrums like that of
Saturday until the Idaho' game is
past.
