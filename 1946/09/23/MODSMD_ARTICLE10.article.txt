## 
### 
Stanford Village, one hundred
acres of green and pink dormitories*
opened its multiple doors last week
to 2,000 Stanford men and womeh
who had applied for living quar
ters. Into the 64-man rooms went,
graduate and undergraduate men,
entering with gratitude Stanford's
giant post-war housing experiment,
and wha4 is probably the largest
University emergency housing in
stallation in the country.
Dibble General Hospital was
turned over to Stanford Aug. 1 by
the Federal Public Housing Author
ity, bare of beds, linen, and similar
basic essentials. The University and
the Village staff entered a nation
wide hunt for facilities; today, one
and one-half months later, the Vil
lage is ready for business with bunk
beds for 2,000, linen service, an in
firmary, service-store, and recreation
accommodations for all.
ACCOMMODATIONS
Four types of students can be ac
commodated at the Village: single
men, single women, married couples
without children, and married coup
les with children. As yet, none of
the apartments for families are
ready, but within a week many will
be complete, and persons who have
applied to live in them will be no
tified as they are completed.
In each of the barracks-like dor
mitories are a number of single and
double rooms which will be drawn
for by lot as students move in. Those
men assigned to live in rooms ac
commodating 32 or 64 students will
pay less rent for the same services:
beds (bunk type), mattresses, bed
linen, wardrobes, bureau lockers,
janitor service. In each dorm is a
small social room to be used for
typing and letter-writing.
WOMEN AT VILLAGE
Double rooms for single women,
occupying space formerly used by
Army nurses, will be furnished in
the same way as double men's
rooms. Women at the Village are
principally graduate women, under
graduate veteran women, and wom
en majoring in physical therapy,
which department has now been
moved to the Village.
What was formerly the bachelor
officers' quarters has been allotted
to married couples without chil
dren. and furnishings in these rooms
arc the same. No cooking facilities
arc available to them, and accom
modations resemble hotel - type
rooms.
FINAL CONSTRUCTION
Eighteen no-bedroom apartments,
140 one-bedroom, and 140 two-bed
room apartments will be supplied
when final construction is finished.
Each apartment will have a living
room, kitchen, bathroom, and the
minimum essentials for housekeep
ing. A lanai for sunchairs and play
space for children is a feature of the
apartments.
Bus service to the Village will be
provided by the Palo Alto City Lines
under contract with the University at
a seven-cent fare. A branch of the
campus post-office has been estab
lished, and mail will be received at
the address, "Stanford Village, Stan
ford University, California."
In the Village civic center are lo
cated a soda fountain, general store,
barber shop, beauty salon, laundry
and dry-cleaning agency, clothing
store, bowling alleys, and dining
halls.
RECREATION FACILITIES
A theater, swimming pool, gym
nasium, tennis courts, handball
courts, and an athletic field, while
not turned over to the University,
will be available to all Village resi
dents. What was formerly an offi
cers' club will be converted into a
recreation building with the expec
tation that it will be used by wives
during the daytime.
Two central dining halls, with a
capacity of 1.000. will be operated
by Stanford cafeteria style. They
will serve breakfast, lunch, and din

STANFORD REPRESENTATIVES
Representing the University at
the Village tire Dwight, Adams,

Herbert Wunderlich, who serves as
chief Village counselor under the
Dean of Students' office.
Mr. Wunderlich has appointed
four young faculty couples to serve
as counselors in the units occupied
by married couples without chil
dren, and a graduate student coun
selor in each of the houses accom
modating single men. These resi
dent counselors will aid in setting
up dormitory rules, house govern
ment, and the social and intramural
program.
Single men students have been
assigned to the dormitories accord
ing to their special interests; for ex
ample, all graduate men in law
school are housed together, as well
as all undergraduates majoring in
the biological sciences.
Study halls for these men have
been established in some of the for
mer wards, as there will be little
other private space with regulated
quiet. Village students, however,
will use the facilities of the main
library on campus.
The same liquor regulations that
apply on the campus will govern
the conduct of men and women re
siding at the Village, according to
Mr. Adams.

Representing the University at
the Village tire Dwight, Adams,

chief Village counselor under the
Dean of Students' office.
Mr. Wunderlich has appointed
four young faculty couples to serve
as counselors in the units occupied
by married couples without chil
dren, and a graduate student coun
selor in each of the houses accom
modating single men. These resi
dent counselors will aid in setting
up dormitory rules, house govern
ment, and the social and intramural
program.
Single men students have been
assigned to the dormitories accord
ing to their special interests; for ex
ample, all graduate men in law
school are housed together, as well
as all undergraduates majoring in
the biological sciences.
Study halls for these men have
been established in some of the for
mer wards, as there will be little
other private space with regulated
quiet. Village students, however,
will use the facilities of the main
library on campus.
The same liquor regulations that
apply on the campus will govern
the conduct of men and women re
siding at the Village, according to
Mr. Adams.
