# 1,100 Frosh Enter Farm
## 'Jolly-Up,' Exams Mark First Days 
### 
One thousand one hundred fresh- [
man are registering at the Farm for [
| the first time today after a week- ;
i end of pre-registering which smacks j
| distinctly of a "back to normal" j
| campus.
Beginning on Friday the fresh- '
I man hall sponsors and pre-reg com- I
mitteemen greeted the incoming In- j
j dians, a few of whom were new
sophomores.
The scrubs then proceeded to live
through physical exams, an apti
tude test, and a welcoming assem
| bly in the Frost Amphitheater with
an address by Dr. Donald B. Tresid
j der. On Saturday they took the j
i English matriculation test in the j
j Memorial Auditorium, attended an
I assembly to acquaint new students
with registration procedure, and |
j met with their faculty advisers.
On Saturday night the women's
| gym burst its seams with the tra-
I ditional freshman "Jolly-up."
On Sunday the frosh continued
the easy life with a 10 a.m. brunch,
I choir rehearsal at Memorial Churc
| Church, services at Memorial
| Church, campus tours and view
from Hoover Library, and, at 5

p.m., a barbecue near the Sunken
rally were presented.
By their tired look you will know
the freshmen from the seniors on
Quad today.

tor and Brook Townscnd. assisted
