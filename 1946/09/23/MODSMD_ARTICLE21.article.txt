# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Inaugural, Volume 110 
### 
Volume MO, making its first complete tour
of i he campus this morning, aims to be as
professional, as complete, and as lively a
newspaper as its 60-man staff is able to pro
duce. Though limited as to space due to in
creased circulation during the newsprint short
age, we hope to be neither limited in facts nor
vision.
A student newspaper, with a reading audi
ence of 7,000, will do well to satisfy all with
its news coverage and feature material: it
would be surprising- shocking if it were to
satisfy all with its editorial policy.
The Daily will, as always, try to provide the
factual information necessary for its readers
intelligently to form an opinion on a given
subject our goal is all the facts, given by
those students 01 officials qualified to give
them.
To attain greater confidence, understand
ing, and co-operation between students, ad
ministration, and faculty, we shall support any
organization that promotes achievement ol
these ends. We shall plug unsparingly for fro
quent attendance ol faculty and administration
officers at student meetings; and we will
equally publicize any means by which slu
<l< nts can know personally administration and
l.j cilty members.
As much as possible, we shall ii y to per
SOnalize our columns, and serve as a unifying
Ujh'4" among groups in a student body too

large to be individually considered.
United Press reports of world and national
news will occupy as much space as is merited
by nature of the news. We expect that it will
be generous. We shall attempt to evaluate all
news, however, according to its importance in '
bringing about a thinking and unified student
community.
We'll have our opinions, over here —opin
ions to be presented in our editorial columns.
Hut we'll be using the same facts to form our
opinions that are available to you in the news
columns. When you disagree, we want to
know. Address all gripes to Campus Opinion,
sign your name as indication of your sincerity,
and your voice will be heard. However, we
reserve the right to censor such letters for
"length, good taste and libel."
Volume 110 recognizes that Stanford faces
a year of experiment, that will not pass with
out mistakes and misjudgements on the part
of all. But the Daily will try to remember that
education is the primary objective of this Uni
versity, and primary consideration in such
niatteis goes to the students.
As a studen! supported newspaper, our
function is to serve you. Jt is for us who put
out the paper from day to day to decide how
this can best be done, but it is for you, the
readers, to express your ideas and opinions
10/ oui consider!ion.
I low about that.

Volume 110 recognizes that Stanford faces
a year of experiment, that will not pass with
out mistakes and misjudgements on the part
of all. But the Daily will try to remember that
education is the primary objective of this Uni
versity, and primary consideration in such
niatteis goes to the students.
As a studen! supported newspaper, our
function is to serve you. Jt is for us who put
out the paper from day to day to decide how

Volume MO, making its first complete tour
of i he campus this morning, aims to be as
professional, as complete, and as lively a
newspaper as its 60-man staff is able to pro
duce. Though limited as to space due to in
creased circulation during the newsprint short
age, we hope to be neither limited in facts nor
vision.
A student newspaper, with a reading audi
ence of 7,000, will do well to satisfy all with
its news coverage and feature material: it
would be surprising- shocking if it were to
satisfy all with its editorial policy.
The Daily will, as always, try to provide the
factual information necessary for its readers
intelligently to form an opinion on a given
subject our goal is all the facts, given by
those students 01 officials qualified to give
them.
To attain greater confidence, understand
ing, and co-operation between students, ad
ministration, and faculty, we shall support any
organization that promotes achievement ol
these ends. We shall plug unsparingly for fro
quent attendance ol faculty and administration
officers at student meetings; and we will
equally publicize any means by which slu
<l< nts can know personally administration and
l.j cilty members.
As much as possible, we shall ii y to per
SOnalize our columns, and serve as a unifying
Ujh'4" among groups in a student body too

large to be individually considered.
United Press reports of world and national
news will occupy as much space as is merited
by nature of the news. We expect that it will
be generous. We shall attempt to evaluate all
news, however, according to its importance in '
bringing about a thinking and unified student
community.
We'll have our opinions, over here —opin
ions to be presented in our editorial columns.
Hut we'll be using the same facts to form our
