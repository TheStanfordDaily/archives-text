Seven thousand students, to pul it mildly,
is no small bunch of peasants. Seven thou
sand men and women come to Stanford this
quarter seeking an insight into the culture of
.1 world, and an education with which they
i .hi better serve it.
It is unnecessary to reiterate the obvious
disadvantages of this enrollment for each of
the 7.0CJ0. in the library, the dormitories, the
Cellar, classrooms, and the Bookstore, elbow
room will be each student's allotment. Dur
ing summer. Administration officials combed
the national supply of faculty, housing facili
lies, and similar scarce items, and came forth
with a remarkable amount of each to ease this
quarter's breaking-in process.
The bulk of adjustment now falls to stu
dent planners.
This year's experience, wrll be an educa
lion in practical democracy for all of us. In
â€¢ very student activity, in every campus pro
gram, a student body with enlarged back
grounds interests must come first.
A closed social calendar and an "all

campus dance will be things of tlte past.
Two Saturday night iunctions, in place of one,
will be mandatory. One of the principal jobs 1
of the social calendar will be to amalgamate
a student body that is at best all-too-widely
scattered. Concert Series and Stanlord Play
ers tickets must go on the student priority 1
list, contrary to a past practice of selling a !
large number to Palo Alto residents.
To Executive Committee, main line of stu
dent government, falls the greater share of
the tioubles caused by the 7.000. Necessarily
cumbersome with the advent of Village repre
sentatives, Excom must work out a more effi- j
cient system of subcommittee responsibility
for the bigger problems that will come before
it.
The return of football and our postwar en- i
rollment will inevitably bring Stanford more
into the public eye. Our worth will be meas
ured by the amount of far-sightedness, imagi-[
nation and unselfish consideration we exert
at home.
