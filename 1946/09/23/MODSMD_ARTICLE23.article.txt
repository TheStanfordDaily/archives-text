# MELLON SHELTON
## BULL SESSION 
### 
We were walking around the campus a Ut
ile yesterday, and, as a matter oi strict fact,
only recognized a handful of people out ol the
mobs that were promenading Quadwards. It's
getting to a point where, when one old face
sees another old face they proceed to fall all
over each other with great embraces, practi
<<illy weeping over the fact that they each
know someone around here. Might be a little
concentrated practice ol the "Hello" tradition
< ould come in handy.
Speaking ol the "Hello" tradition, one sen
ioi we know was wending her way around the
campus amid myriads of frosh. Taking her
for one of themselves, they'd come running
up saying, "Gee, isn't it funny being here?"
Upon which our friend would gush appropri
ately. laugh and say, "Yes, isn't it jus/?" This
thing with a swing later spotted some not so
bad Houghs, class of '50. Being pretty well
versed in the "Hello" tradition herself, she
yoo hooed a bright "Yoo hoooo-o!" The re
sults were so successful she's been doing it
evei since.
Aftei reading about the new paiking regit
lotions (we see the stories before they go to
press), we feel the campus cops luive done a
noble deed. They have not restricted the

cactus gardens lo academic personnel, nor
have they put a 40 minute time limit on park
ing there. On behalf of the student body, we
thank you.
Our fellow journalese t and self titled pro
fessional revolutionary, Stan Shpetner, con
tributes this little item for the benefit of
11nance-minded veterans.
"Talk about accounting. You figure you
spend $2.16 a day for beer and figure a 30 day
month that comes to $64.80. Which is only
20 cents away from the G.I. $65 salary. Then
you can take the 20 cents and add the 5 cents
left from your $500â€”who needs books?-buy
yourself a pair of dark glasses, and you're SeJ.
lo sleep through another guarter."
A slick chick who inhabits one of the
houses on the Midd-le How, received not a
little notorious publicity in this column last
spring with the revelation that she wore her
boy friend's Hi Y pin on her pajamas. Now
we come back to school and find that they
broke up this summer. Our faith in human
natuie and the power of Hi-Y is broken. They
dien't even friends any more. When we asked
the cause of this catastrophic blow, she said
she had nothing to say and said it.
"I have nothing to say," she said.
