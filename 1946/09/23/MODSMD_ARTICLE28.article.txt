### DON LANGENDORF 
In this football season, Stanford's
fust since 1942, the Indians will,
wo predict, finish the season with a
won four, lost five, record including
three conference victories. Three of
our wins will be over Idaho, Santa
Clara, and our traditional rival,
California, with the fourth win re
sulting from an upset over either
Oregon State, Washington, or Wash
ington State.
Pie-season tabulations picture ev
erybody on the coast as loaded
outside of Cal, Santa Clara, and
Stanford. All the sport writers look
til the Indian squad and write col
umns of pity concerning our team.
Barring serious injuries, Stanford is
liable to pull a surprise win over
any outfit that views the "Red ma
chine" as a breather.
FIRST STRING GOOD
The way things now look, Stan
ford's first string stacks up as good
is any in the area, but it will be the
reserve strength that hurts. Fred
Uoensch, Jim Cox, Bill Hachten,
D;.ve Brown, and Lloyd Merriman
could probably make any other
t< am in the conference.
While these men will hold up
against the other outfits, an oppo
nent such as Southern Cal can toss
in its second and third strings that
'arc almost as good as the first, and
tin Indians will wilt before the
fjesh forces. If the reserves can
come through when needed, Stan
lord could surprise one and all, that
i: . all except Ted Husing, by finish
ing high in the conference.
WI T ON A LIMB
Mere is the way the conference
looks to us at the coment.
1. Southern California
Cravath should not have too much
trouble in molding great material
into a great team. U.S.C.'s toughest
games will be against non-confer-
Giice foes Notre Dame and Ohio
Slate. We see a loss to Notre Dame
:uid a win over Ohio State.
2. U.C.L.A.
With 33 lettermen returning, sev
eral from their 1943 Rose Bowl
squad, the Bruins will be ready to
move into the number one position
should the Trojans slip. They are
favored in schedule making in that
tlu y have breathers before their two
toughest games, the Trojans and St.
Mary's.
3. Oregon Stale
Like U.C.L.A.. the Beavers have
men returning from their Rose Bowl
team that upset Duke back in North
Carolina. As with all northern
teams this year, they are loaded.
They meet a tough one in U.C.L.A.
in their opener.
4. Washington
One of the Daily reporters, Tom
Self, saw the Huskies practice and
states their fourth and fifth strings
I'»ok as good as their first. How
ever, Pest Welsh had schedule
trouble in facing St. Mary's and
U.C.L.A. in the first two games.
Should the Huskies win either of
these .they can consider themselves
</i' to a good start.
fl. Stanford
Perhaps the only one on the coast
to pick the Indians this high, we
fk'ure the conference record of three
win.'! and four losses should turn the
t lick.
<i. Oregon
With Jack Leicht in the line-up,
Oregon is always a threat. Tex Oli
ver's outfit may pull a few surprises
this year. Stanford does not play
()i egon.
7. Washington State
By all rights, the Cougars do not
belong this low on the standings,
>>«11 with everyone else loaded and
Stanford pulling a few surprises,
where else can W.S.C. be put?
X. California
Regardless of their tremendous
turnout on opening day of practice,
the Bears will be lucky to claim two
conference victories.
9. Idaho
With their greatest team of all
time, the Vandals are still no match
for the other outfits in the confer
ence outside of Montana.
It). Montana
Where else did you expect to put
them?
For the non-conference oufits,
Were is what we expect.
1. St. Mary's
Until proven otherwise, the Gaels
;«re still the top team in the West.
We look for another Sugar Bowl
trip and another All-American se
lection for Herm Wedemeyer.
2. U.S.F.
Their strongest team in history is
expected this fall, which will play
Mississippi State starring 'Shorty"
McWilliams, and St. Mary's. If they
win either of these games, they are
a cinch for a bowl trip. Win both
kikl it is th" Sugar Bowl, but we do
not see them beating St. Mary's.
Fresno State
With Jackie Fellows returning,
they will win a large percentage
ot their games.
1. San Jose State
Their greatest team is weak when
compared with these other outfits,
but do not be surprised should they
spring an upset over Fresno,
112). Santa Clara
The Broncos just do not have
what it takes to win ball games this
year.
