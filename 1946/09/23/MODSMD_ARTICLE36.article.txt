## SLANTING SIDELINES 
### 
Last week, due to geographical ,
necessity, we had the task of going
through Los Angeles on our shuttle
north. And since we had previously
read dripping accounts of the grid
prowess of U.S.C., we decided to
look over the outfit and see what
cooks.
First we headed for Bovard
Field, where J. Cravath conducts
Troy sessions. Over 200 charac
ters were jogging around, and 14
coaches were cracking the whip.
Spotting some fellow who looked
like he knew something more than
the typical guy who says that S.C.
is a sure bet for the Rose Bowl, we
sidled up and asked him how things
looked to him.
And this is what we got for a re
ply:
"A great team, but too many let
termen around. Since only 11 can
get on the field at one time, the
horde of other letter winners might
get sore at Cravath. A couple of
hetshots have already quit. The
same thing that happened at Min
nesota last year might happen here
this season.
"Don't get me wrong. I'm not 1
saying that U.S.C. is going to fall
apart and that Idaho or Montana
will coast into the Rose Bowl. I'm
just saying what could happen."
Well, what are we supposed to
say about that? Everybody who
at least knows that a football is
something that is not used on a
basketball pavilion has been rav
ing about the Trojans. When we
were sports editor (if this paper
last year, regular accounts of the j

mighty U.S.C. poured in furious
ly.
We still think that Troy will win
(he conference. Nothing short of
armed rebelliun would collapse
their grid machine, we believe. But
we don't think they'll waltz through
their schedule without any blem
ishes. Notre Dame will wax them.
So will Ohio State. And we even
think Oregon State stands a close
chance of pulling an upset. (Ore
gon State, for our dough, is the
second-best team around the coast.
Better than U.C.L.A.)
(jetting hack to our U.S.C. ex
cursion, Cravath had the squad
divided into about 17 teams, and
they were running through plays.
McCardle was quartcrhacking the
first string, despite a leg injury.
John Ferraro was pacing the line.
What a ferocious leviathan he.
Being that the only opposition
were tackle dummies, it was hard to
judge the strength of the team, but
the backfield did look as fast as
, but the hefty line was slower
than a broken-down Model T.
Cravath then called the outfit
into the training room, so we de
cided to leave, a little happier by
the talk our chum gave us, but still
fearful of the day the Trojans scoot
to Palo Alto.

cided to leave, a little happier by
the talk our chum gave us, but still
fearful of the day the Trojans scoot
to Palo Alto.
Last week, due to geographical ,
necessity, we had the task of going
through Los Angeles on our shuttle
north. And since we had previously
read dripping accounts of the grid
prowess of U.S.C., we decided to
look over the outfit and see what
cooks.
First we headed for Bovard
Field, where J. Cravath conducts
Troy sessions. Over 200 charac
ters were jogging around, and 14
coaches were cracking the whip.
Spotting some fellow who looked
like he knew something more than
the typical guy who says that S.C.
is a sure bet for the Rose Bowl, we
sidled up and asked him how things
looked to him.
And this is what we got for a re
ply:
"A great team, but too many let
termen around. Since only 11 can
get on the field at one time, the
horde of other letter winners might
get sore at Cravath. A couple of
hetshots have already quit. The
same thing that happened at Min
nesota last year might happen here
this season.
"Don't get me wrong. I'm not 1
saying that U.S.C. is going to fall
apart and that Idaho or Montana
will coast into the Rose Bowl. I'm
just saying what could happen."
Well, what are we supposed to
say about that? Everybody who
at least knows that a football is
something that is not used on a
basketball pavilion has been rav
ing about the Trojans. When we
were sports editor (if this paper
last year, regular accounts of the j

mighty U.S.C. poured in furious
ly.
We still think that Troy will win
(he conference. Nothing short of
armed rebelliun would collapse
their grid machine, we believe. But
we don't think they'll waltz through
their schedule without any blem
ishes. Notre Dame will wax them.
So will Ohio State. And we even
think Oregon State stands a close
chance of pulling an upset. (Ore
gon State, for our dough, is the
second-best team around the coast.
Better than U.C.L.A.)
(jetting hack to our U.S.C. ex
cursion, Cravath had the squad
divided into about 17 teams, and
they were running through plays.
McCardle was quartcrhacking the
first string, despite a leg injury.
John Ferraro was pacing the line.
What a ferocious leviathan he.
Being that the only opposition
were tackle dummies, it was hard to
judge the strength of the team, but
the backfield did look as fast as
, but the hefty line was slower
than a broken-down Model T.
Cravath then called the outfit
into the training room, so we de
cided to leave, a little happier by
the talk our chum gave us, but still
fearful of the day the Trojans scoot
