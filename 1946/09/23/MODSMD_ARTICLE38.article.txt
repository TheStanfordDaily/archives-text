## 
### 
In a move to enforce campusH
parking regulations going into effect
this quarter, all student- and fac
ulty-owned cars will be registered
with the police department before
they may be permitted to operate
on campus, Police Chief Gordon
Davis has announced.
Date and procedure of automo
bile registration has not yet been
stated, but will probably take place
early this quarter, he said.
Identical stickers, hearing the
Stanford seal with registration
number superimposed, will be is- \
sued in four colors to the four j
classes of cars requiring registra- |
tion.
They will be: academic person- j
nel, black; on-campus students, red; j
off-campus students, brown; and j
Stanford Villlage students, green.
"Every car must he in first -
class mechanical shape, or it will
not he permitted on campus," Mr.
Davis declared. "In an effort to
maintain control over this condi
tion a full-time trallic officer on
a motorcycle will he in evidence
Ibis quarter."
All student traffic violat-ons go
through Men's and Women's Coun- j
cils. Traffic fine scale is as follows: !
parking, $2; arterial stop violation. I
$2.50; wrong way on a one-way!
street: forward, $2.50, and in re
verse, $5; passengers on a running
board, $1 a passenger.
Speeds in excess of the limit:
(a) first offense, 50 cents per mile
per hour over the recognized lim
it; (b) second offense, 75 cents
per mile per hour; (c) third of
fense, $1 per mile per hour; and
(d) fourth offense, the automobile
will not he permitted to operate
on University grounds.
Cyclists and pedestrians must be
careful to observe traffic regula
tions, Mr. Davis warned. Cyclists
are asked to give arm signals when j
turning, to drive well to the right j
of the street, and to get off and :
walk their bikes when crossing
heavy traffic.
Cyclists will at no time be per
mitted to ride through the colon- \
nndes of the Quad or the Inner
Court, Mr. Davis stated. Those
crossing Quad must dismount and
walk their bikes. Fines will be $2.50
for the first offense of this regula
tion, and $5 for the second.
Cyclists riding to Paly are urged j
lo use the gravel pathways along j
Palm Drive, in preference to riding '
on the drive proper.
Saying that police "anticipate so [
much vehicular traffic" on campus
this fall, Mr. Davis urged car own
ers to walk to classes as much as j
possible.
"We should he constantly aware j
that there is a potential fatality
in every accident," he concluded. !
"and we are extremely anxious |
to avoid possible injuries and to
close another school year without
the tragedy of a fatal accident."
