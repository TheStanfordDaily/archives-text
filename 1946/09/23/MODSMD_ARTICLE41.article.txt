# Summer Sees Reg Records
## 
### BOYD HAIGHT 
Summer quarter, traditionally a j
period of languid scholastic effort
by a hardy few, saw all tradition
discarded and registration records
broken this year as 3,171 students
enrolled for the summer session.
Campus discussion, sometimes le
thargic in the summer heat, some
times hotter than the 14 brush fires
some arsonist set around the area,
revolved around the tuition raise, |
the Dibble-Branner battle, and a !
one-man crusade by a Daily col
umnist to abolish fraternities.
BRANNER PROTEST
Announcement in July of the re
turn of women to Branner Hall in
the fall brought a storm of protest
from men residents. The tuition
raise precipitated a score of "Letters 1
to the Editor," one of them thank
ing the University for leaving five
cents unspent for the veteran.
Late in the quarter Bull Session
er Bob Chandler began a vitriolic
attack on the fraternity system at i
Stanford. Daily publication, ended
before the crusade developed any
steam, prevented any widespread
reaction by tong members.
VILLAGE ANNEXED
After the early novelty of the I
acquisition of Dibble Hospital had [
worn off, almost everyone took for j
granted the facilities for 2.000 made j
available at the 120-acre Army in- i
stallation.
Reconversion problems held up j
announcement of the dispisition of |
the housing facilities, but plans for
incorporating the vast annex into
Stanford went ahead. Bob Collins
was appointed student co-ordinator j
to draw up plans for student gov- J
overnment and activities at the
sprawling project located two miles
from the campus.
A contest to name the annex got '
vrrler way in Julv. Five judges j
picked "Stanford Village" from 250
entries. The $25 prize offered by
the Daily went to economics major ;
Kenneth W. Herrick for the win- ;
ring name.
Other suggestions ran the gam
ut of collegiate imagination from
"Litchfield" to "The Stable" (com- i
bir.ing Stanford and Dibble). The
judges felt that the temporary na- j
ture of the "Village" did not make
a name for any person appropriate.
The sports picture was blank
during most of the summer, but an- J
nouncement that Michigan had been J
rdded to the 1947 schedule came in
July.
With the close of the quarter Col- i
lins presented the final report of j
his Village committee. Its main rec- }
ommendation concerned representa- j
tion of Village students on Excom.
