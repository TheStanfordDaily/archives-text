## Police Chief Announces Campus Parking Changes Widespread Campus Revisions Made To Lessen Traffic Accident Dangers 
### 
To facilitate the handling of an
increased number of automobiles on
campus, and to lesson the danger of
traffic accidents here, wide parking
revisions covering almost the entire
campus area have been instituted
for the coming year, Police Chief
Gordon Davis announced recently.
Delivery of signs and paint to in
dicate the changes has been tem
porarily held up, he said, and the j
new rules will not go into effect un- j
til they arc put in.
"However," he added, "we would ,
appreciate the co-operation of the
students in observing the proposed
rules prior to the time they go into
effect."
A breakdown of the areas affected j
by the new regulations follows:
1. ROW: There will be no park- I
inn permitted on either side of La- i
suen Street from the Mayfield Ave- I
nue cutoff (by the Deke house) to
the Post Office.
2. POST OFFICE TO QUAD: The !
west, or Union, side of Lasuen be- !
I ween the Post Office and Engineer- !
ing corner will be reserved for
tourists and guests of the Univer- i
sity. Faculty and student parking ,
will not be allowed there. No park- |
ing will be permitted on the cast
side (from S.A.E. house to Book- |
store) of Lasuen.
.5. SALVATIERRA STREET, from 1
Lasuen to Arguello, will be a one- j
way street. Parking will be al- j
lowed only on the south side of '

Salvaticrra (i.e., across from Ma
drono).
4. ESCONDIDO STREET: From
Engineering corner to the point
where Alvarado intersects Escon
dido (opposite parking lot behind
Education Building) parking will be
prohibited on the south side of the
street. Parking has formerly been
permitted there in the past. Ground
has been leveled off at the intersec
tion triangle for additional parking i
space in that area.
5. CELLAR: Panama Street, from
Lasuen (Cellar corner) to Duena
(Corp yard corner), will be a fine

new feature.
The opposite side of Panama will [
be changed from right-angle park- j
ing to parallel parking. This zone
will be restricted for the use of en
gineering faculty only.
Autos will no longer be permitted i
in the area between the chime tower j
and the Mining Department. This
section was formerly used by cngi- |
neering faculty.

for residential buildings in this area
are located in the alleys.
