# Cards Drill For Idaho
## Vandals Boast Strong Eleven 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
In a few hours more, than four |
days the Big Red Machine gets its i
unveiling, and then, then Stanford
and everybody else that's interested i
will know whether or not the In- |
dians have the makings of a good
football team.
This Idaho outfit the Cards tangle
with is nobody's collection of cous
ins, and from what they say the
Vandals' "greatest team in history"
is not going to roll over and play
"dead doggie for Stanford or any
body else.
Idaho is no l»if» time football
school, never has been, hut ton- j
sider how much it would like to
knock over a big time school like
Stanford. From this angle the
thought is horrible to consider,
and don t think Indian coach
Marchie Schwartz hasn't given it
some very thoughtful considera
tion.
The Vandals are big and tough
and experienced, more so in some j
cases than the Cards. Babe Brown !
had 125 men out on opening day,
and from that many men he should
be able to cull at least II men ca
pable of putting up a good battle.
As a starter his back field has Carl
Munson at qb, John Christ.enscn
and Jim Hatch at libs, and Bill Mik- i
li<*H at fb, according to the latest I
blurb from Moscow (Ida.).
This Miklich is a big boy and
rugged too. In 1941, his last year at.
Idaho, he v/as the top scorer in the j
Coast Conference and is rated as j
one of the hardest-driving backs on j
the coast. Hatch is last year's lead- j
ing ground gainer and kicker for [
. the Vandals.
All told. Idaho makes a worth
while opponent, and one the ,
Cards would do well to get over -
before meeting some even tough- j
er schools also boasting their |
quote greatest team in history tin
quote.
Following their final scrimmage
i Saturday, when the jayvees did
some effective defensive work
against the varsity's attacking, the
J Cards have limited their drills to
dummy scrums and light contact
i work.
Monday they went through a pass
-1 ing drill and followed it up with a
dummy drill; xgsterday Mai'chie
gave 'em some Idaho plays, held a
j kickoff practice and then put on a
! signal drill.
At the football writers' luncheon
[ in the City Monday, Marehie gave
| out what he considered his starting
i lineup, to wit, Dave DeSwarte, le; J
Fred Boensch (or if the Cards kick i
off, Charlie Wakefield), It; Bill ;
Hachten, lg; Pete August, c; Har- j
vey Bernard, rg; Finney Cox, rt;
Bob Hall, re; Frankie Forbes, qb;
Don Zappetini, lh; Freddy Parsons,
j rh; and Lloyd Merriman, fb.
The above lineup represents the
I most experienced t?am the Cards
| can field for the open or Saturday,
| but it is very likely that changes
I will be made before a so-called first
string eleven is evolved.

Marchie Schwartz hasn't given it
some very thoughtful considera
tion.
The Vandals are big and tough
and experienced, more so in some j
cases than the Cards. Babe Brown !
had 125 men out on opening day,

be able to cull at least II men ca
pable of putting up a good battle.
As a starter his back field has Carl
Munson at qb, John Christ.enscn
and Jim Hatch at libs, and Bill Mik- i
li<*H at fb, according to the latest I
blurb from Moscow (Ida.).
This Miklich is a big boy and
rugged too. In 1941, his last year at.
Idaho, he v/as the top scorer in the j
Coast Conference and is rated as j
one of the hardest-driving backs on j
the coast. Hatch is last year's lead- j
ing ground gainer and kicker for [
. the Vandals.
All told. Idaho makes a worth
while opponent, and one the ,
Cards would do well to get over -
before meeting some even tough- j
er schools also boasting their |
quote greatest team in history tin

Following their final scrimmage
i Saturday, when the jayvees did
some effective defensive work
against the varsity's attacking, the
J Cards have limited their drills to
dummy scrums and light contact
i work.
Monday they went through a pass
-1 ing drill and followed it up with a
dummy drill; xgsterday Mai'chie
gave 'em some Idaho plays, held a
j kickoff practice and then put on a
! signal drill.
At the football writers' luncheon
[ in the City Monday, Marehie gave

i lineup, to wit, Dave DeSwarte, le; J

off, Charlie Wakefield), It; Bill ;
Hachten, lg; Pete August, c; Har- j
vey Bernard, rg; Finney Cox, rt;

Don Zappetini, lh; Freddy Parsons,

The above lineup represents the
I most experienced t?am the Cards

I will be made before a so-called first
string eleven is evolved.
In a few hours more, than four |
days the Big Red Machine gets its i
unveiling, and then, then Stanford
and everybody else that's interested i
will know whether or not the In- |
dians have the makings of a good
