## 
### 
Declaring that I,he Stanford-Cal
Big Game will be "in jeopardy"
should Stanford students make any
raids on th<* Cal campus this fall,
A.S.S.U. President Martin Anderson
yesterday issued a statement, to
Stanford students warning against
such action.
The statement in full reads:
"In HKSI! Stanford signed a
pledge in respect to the Axe as
follows:
w 'We hereby agree thai the
Stanford Axe shall he awarded as
a trophy to the winner of the Uig
Game starling with the season of
I!>•!!>. In event of a tie game the
Axe shall remain in possession of
the previous Big Game winner.
The officers of each student body
shall he responsible for (he con
duct of its members in observing
the above agreement.
"'(Signed) Wakefield Taylor,
president. Associated Students,
University of California; Gerald
11. Trautman, president. Associat
ed Students, Stanford University.'
"Th'.' violation of that agreement
by members of the student body of
either school does not destroy that
agreement or the principle behind it.
"There is an understanding thai
each school will punish its own
violators of the pact. Uast fall
when the Axe was stolen, Califor
nia inflicted a stiif penalty against
those responsible. Now, expulsion
faces those responsible for the
second theft—if they are U.C. stu
dents.
"My main concern is that if Stan
ford students commence raids on the
University of California in retalia
tion, the playing of the Big Game
will be in jeopardy. If such raids
occur, Dr. Tresidder or Dr. Sproul
may have the game canceled.
"This is in a small way a test of
the ability of people to govern
their relations by reason rather
than emotion.
"(Signed) Martin Anderson,
President Associated Students"
