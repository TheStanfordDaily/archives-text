Because of problems connected
with the opening of Stanford Vil
lage, the traditional time for open
ing classes has been changed slight
ly, the Registrar's office announced.
Morning classes will begin on the
hour and dismiss 50 minutes after
the hour. Classes will begin exactly
as listed in the Time Schedule. Bells
will ring as follows: warning bell
for first class, 7:50 a.m.; bell for
opening class, 8 o'clock; dismissal
bell, 8:50. This bell will also serve
as warning bell for the 0 o'clock
class. Similarly, bells will ring
throughout the morning at 9, 9:50,
10, 10:50, 11, 11:50, 12, 12:50. Please
note especially that the 12 o'clock
class will follow the morning sched
ule.
Afternoon classes will begin, as
formerly, at 15 minutes after the
hour and dismiss five minutes after
the following hour. The first warn
ing hell will ring at 1:05 p.m., the
starting bell at 1:15, and the dismis
sal bell at 2:05. Similarly, bells will
ring at 2:15, 3:05, 3:15, 4:05, 4:15,
5:05, 5:15, and 6:05.
