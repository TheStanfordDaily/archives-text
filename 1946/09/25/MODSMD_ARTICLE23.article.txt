# Music Now A Department
## 
### 
Division of Music has been en
larged this autumn to a department
with offices changed from the Me
morial Church to The Knoll where
the ground and second floors are
used for classrooms and offices.
For the first time a big all-
University chorus has been or
ganized by Dr. Lorcn Crostcn,
newly appointed bead of (he Mu
sic Department from the Univer
sity of Idaho. Professor Warren
I). Allen, former head of the Di
vision of Music, has taken a leave
of absence to teach nuisicology at
the University of Texas.
At. The Knoll the third floor is
being used for living quarters for
faculty (not. necessarily music); the
ballroom has been turned into a
classroom; and there is also a re
hearsal hall downstairs.
Already the newly organized band
has had one rehearsal under Julius
Shuchat, and it. will play for the
Idaho game.
