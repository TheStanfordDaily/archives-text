## Fraternities, A Formula 
### 
Along with football and the ratio, the fra
ternities officially returned .yesterday as an
integral part of Stanford life. The effect of the
ratio has already been felt by those finding
dates for the Reg Dance, the effect of football
will be known in the next few weeks, but the
return of fraternities under abnormal condi
tions is a problem lacking an immediate solu
tion.
Fraternities are greeted by all as a symbol
of the return of Stanford to a peacetime basis.
For those living in a house, it means a return
to old fiiends, familiar surroundings, and a
comfortable way of college life.
But Stanford's 24 fraternities find them
selves in a situation without precedent on this
campus. Where once Hall and Row were on
an almost 50-50 population basis, fraternity
men now account for a scant 1,100 of more
than 5,000 Stanford men.
Before the war we of Stanford prided our
selves on what was probably the most friendly
fraternity and non-fraternity relationship in
the entire country. A year of living together
as freshmen in Encina established friendships
that were not broken when the split into fra
ternity and other living groups occurred in
the sophomore year.
We derided the state university across the
Day for the isolation of its fraternity men from
the other men scattered in halls and boarding
houses throughout the East Bay area. We de
cided that the fraternities there were too iso
lated and intraverted and the non-fraternity
men too removed for the welfare of the uni
versity.
Bui Stanford men now find themselves in

the same position by the mere fact of registra
tion statistics. Stanford men are divided into
three sections geographically—the Halls, the
Row, and the Village—and the Row numeri
cally is by far the smallest. Pre-war college
has brought men of all ages and from all
backgrounds and the lack of unifying friend
ships between the three geographical seg
ments of Stanford already exists.
The fraternities find themselves on the
spot the sororities were in four years ago—too
many eligible persons, too little room so that
the decision to go Hall or Row is no longer
open to the preference of each individual.
The time is ripe for charges against the
houses of snobbery, of intolerance, of lower
moral standards. Many may envy what they
consider the more comfortable and congenial
life of fraternities and the envy may find re
lease in bitterness.
The answer can be found only in the un
derstanding of the problem of all Stanford
men. "Stanford men first, fraternity (or Hall
or Village) men second" borders on a cliche
but the statement must be a reality before the
problem is solved.
There is no reason to destroy fifty years of
Stanford's history as a reaction to abnormal
attendance conditions which will last only for
three or four more years. Yet fraternities in
their conduct in the coming year can not af
ford to allow an opening wedge for destruc
tive criticism. The problems can only be
solved by intelligent action on the part of all
Stanford men.
Registration statistics pose the problem,
Stanford men must work out the answer.—F.B.

cided that the fraternities there were too iso
lated and intraverted and the non-fraternity
men too removed for the welfare of the uni
versity.
Bui Stanford men now find themselves in

the same position by the mere fact of registra
tion statistics. Stanford men are divided into
three sections geographically—the Halls, the
Row, and the Village—and the Row numeri
cally is by far the smallest. Pre-war college
has brought men of all ages and from all
backgrounds and the lack of unifying friend
ships between the three geographical seg
ments of Stanford already exists.
The fraternities find themselves on the
spot the sororities were in four years ago—too
many eligible persons, too little room so that
the decision to go Hall or Row is no longer
open to the preference of each individual.
The time is ripe for charges against the
houses of snobbery, of intolerance, of lower
moral standards. Many may envy what they
consider the more comfortable and congenial
life of fraternities and the envy may find re
lease in bitterness.
The answer can be found only in the un
derstanding of the problem of all Stanford
men. "Stanford men first, fraternity (or Hall
or Village) men second" borders on a cliche
but the statement must be a reality before the
problem is solved.
There is no reason to destroy fifty years of
Stanford's history as a reaction to abnormal
attendance conditions which will last only for
three or four more years. Yet fraternities in
their conduct in the coming year can not af
ford to allow an opening wedge for destruc
tive criticism. The problems can only be
solved by intelligent action on the part of all
Stanford men.
Registration statistics pose the problem,
Stanford men must work out the answer.—F.B.
Along with football and the ratio, the fra
ternities officially returned .yesterday as an
integral part of Stanford life. The effect of the
ratio has already been felt by those finding
dates for the Reg Dance, the effect of football
will be known in the next few weeks, but the
return of fraternities under abnormal condi
tions is a problem lacking an immediate solu
tion.
Fraternities are greeted by all as a symbol
of the return of Stanford to a peacetime basis.
For those living in a house, it means a return
to old fiiends, familiar surroundings, and a
comfortable way of college life.
But Stanford's 24 fraternities find them
selves in a situation without precedent on this
campus. Where once Hall and Row were on
an almost 50-50 population basis, fraternity
men now account for a scant 1,100 of more
than 5,000 Stanford men.
Before the war we of Stanford prided our
selves on what was probably the most friendly
fraternity and non-fraternity relationship in
the entire country. A year of living together
as freshmen in Encina established friendships
that were not broken when the split into fra
ternity and other living groups occurred in
the sophomore year.
We derided the state university across the
Day for the isolation of its fraternity men from
the other men scattered in halls and boarding
houses throughout the East Bay area. We de
cided that the fraternities there were too iso
lated and intraverted and the non-fraternity
men too removed for the welfare of the uni
versity.
