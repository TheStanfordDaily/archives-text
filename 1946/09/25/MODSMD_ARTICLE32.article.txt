## BULL SESSION 
### 
As I was pedaling my unicycle past the
Daily Shack yesterday, a clutching hand
reached out and yanked me in.
"You worked on the Daily before the war,"
a voice accused.
"Guilty," I confessed, throwing myself on
the mercy of the court and crossing my legs
to give the jury a better look at my knees.
"Fine," the voice said, "we need an experi
enced man to write Bull Session."
"But I'm not experienced," I stammered,
blushing shyly.
"At writing," the voice said.
"Oh," I said.
* * *
So I found myself seated before a type
writer with a circle of leering faces leering
leers at me.
"Be funny," they said.
"But the atom bomb is threatening to de
stroy civilization," I protested.
"Make 'em laugh," they said.
"The Russians are playing power politics
in the Balkans," I muttered.
"Lotsa jokes," they chanted.
"World War 111 is in the making."
"Tell 'em funny stories."
"Inflation is spreading, depression is ap
proaching."
"Jokes, gags, Joe Miller stuff."
"But the Dodgers are half a game out of
the lead."
"Be funny, be funny, be funny," the chorus
swelled.
* * *
Seems like every column ought to have a
policy. They all do. Pegler, Winchell, Pear
son, Eleanor Roosevelt. And v/hat have they
got that I haven't? Of course, Eleanor keeps
a diary. Which I don't because I lead a dull
life and never have the Little Friends of the
American Society of Delinquents in for tea
and cookies.
So I have a policy. It's not having my
notes eaten by a cow like Saroyan did, or
having hashers throw water on me like Mayer
did, or making nasty noises at fraternities like
Chandler did, or looking at pretty girls out of
the window like Steif did, or agitating for

cheaper tomato juice at the Cellar likes Ames
did.
But I'm never going to use the editorial
"we." No sense to it. I'm writing this, you're
reading it (all four of you, hello Mother) and
you know doggone well there's only one of
me.
Suppose, for example, I should write, "We
were down at the Cactus Garden last night."
You might immediately assume that I had
picked up a little lass from Roble and was out
staring out the moon. It ain't so. There was
only one of me and I was standing in line
(A-K) along with thousands of others waiting
to register. I got there late, not until 4 a.m.,
and so wasn't one of the lucky ones to get a
seat in the amphitheatre.
The frosh next to me had his wife and
three children with him. He was having a'
rough time. Especially with the three-year-old
.who kept jumping up and down and hollering
to the whole line, "I can lick any man on the
football team." And he probably can too,
according to Collier's. That mag just doesn't
have any faith in us this year.
That reg line Monday morn was really a
bloody battle. The majority of the vets got
more combat experience there than they did
in the last three years. One guy. fighting for
"Old Students Returning, L-Z" kept getting
shoved up to "New Women, A-K" and has
been maladjusted ever since. But he claims
that physical at the Women's Gym was the
experience of a lifetime.
Yesterday, police protection had arrived
and the lines were more orderly, although
confused and several miles longer. Friend of
ours who was trying to turn his reg book in
ended up with four subscriptions to the Chap
pie, two to the Quad, and is taking tickets at
three gates at the stadium this Saturday.
* * * •
Any feelthy stories I gather in collecting
material for this column, you can hear by ap
proaching me in the Cellar and plying me
with a coke (double lime). Which reminds
me, did you hear the one about the frosh at
the jolly-up that ....
Oh well, see you in the Cellar.

(A-K) along with thousands of others waiting
to register. I got there late, not until 4 a.m.,
and so wasn't one of the lucky ones to get a
seat in the amphitheatre.
The frosh next to me had his wife and
three children with him. He was having a'
rough time. Especially with the three-year-old
.who kept jumping up and down and hollering
to the whole line, "I can lick any man on the
football team." And he probably can too,
according to Collier's. That mag just doesn't
have any faith in us this year.
That reg line Monday morn was really a
bloody battle. The majority of the vets got
more combat experience there than they did
in the last three years. One guy. fighting for
"Old Students Returning, L-Z" kept getting
shoved up to "New Women, A-K" and has
been maladjusted ever since. But he claims
that physical at the Women's Gym was the
experience of a lifetime.
Yesterday, police protection had arrived
and the lines were more orderly, although
confused and several miles longer. Friend of
ours who was trying to turn his reg book in
ended up with four subscriptions to the Chap
pie, two to the Quad, and is taking tickets at
three gates at the stadium this Saturday.

Any feelthy stories I gather in collecting
material for this column, you can hear by ap
proaching me in the Cellar and plying me
with a coke (double lime). Which reminds
me, did you hear the one about the frosh at
the jolly-up that ....
Oh well, see you in the Cellar.
As I was pedaling my unicycle past the
Daily Shack yesterday, a clutching hand
reached out and yanked me in.
"You worked on the Daily before the war,"
a voice accused.
"Guilty," I confessed, throwing myself on
the mercy of the court and crossing my legs
to give the jury a better look at my knees.
"Fine," the voice said, "we need an experi
enced man to write Bull Session."
"But I'm not experienced," I stammered,
blushing shyly.
"At writing," the voice said.
"Oh," I said.
* * *
So I found myself seated before a type
writer with a circle of leering faces leering
leers at me.
"Be funny," they said.
"But the atom bomb is threatening to de
stroy civilization," I protested.
"Make 'em laugh," they said.
"The Russians are playing power politics
in the Balkans," I muttered.
"Lotsa jokes," they chanted.
"World War 111 is in the making."
"Tell 'em funny stories."
"Inflation is spreading, depression is ap
proaching."
"Jokes, gags, Joe Miller stuff."
"But the Dodgers are half a game out of
the lead."
"Be funny, be funny, be funny," the chorus
swelled.

Seems like every column ought to have a
policy. They all do. Pegler, Winchell, Pear
son, Eleanor Roosevelt. And v/hat have they
got that I haven't? Of course, Eleanor keeps
a diary. Which I don't because I lead a dull
life and never have the Little Friends of the
American Society of Delinquents in for tea
and cookies.
So I have a policy. It's not having my
notes eaten by a cow like Saroyan did, or
having hashers throw water on me like Mayer
did, or making nasty noises at fraternities like
Chandler did, or looking at pretty girls out of
the window like Steif did, or agitating for

cheaper tomato juice at the Cellar likes Ames
did.
But I'm never going to use the editorial
"we." No sense to it. I'm writing this, you're
reading it (all four of you, hello Mother) and
you know doggone well there's only one of
me.
Suppose, for example, I should write, "We
were down at the Cactus Garden last night."
You might immediately assume that I had
picked up a little lass from Roble and was out
staring out the moon. It ain't so. There was
only one of me and I was standing in line
