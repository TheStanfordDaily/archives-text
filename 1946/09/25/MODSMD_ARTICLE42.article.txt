NEW YORK. Sept. 24 (UP).—lt
rained on the Brooklyn- Dodgers to
day but it didn't dampen their pen
nant hopes.
When their game with the Phila
delphia Phillies was postponed un
til Thursday, they got their first day
of rest since Sept. 9. That ended a
string of 14 days of play under in
cessant pressure in which they had
17games including a 19-inning 0 to 0
tie with Cincinnati.
"And we'll play Thursday in rain
and mud if necessary for that would
be our only chance to get the games
in," Durocher said.
Durocher was reminded that Car
dinal Manager Eddie Dyer had an
nounced that he was going to use
his lefty ace Howie Pollet in relief
if needed between now and Friday,
then start hini on both Friday and
Sunday if the pennant race was not
decided by then.
"I'm not as smart as that," he said,
grinning. "We gotta play these
games one day at a time."
The Detroit Tigers cinched sec
ond place in the American League
and Hank Greenberg virtually
sewed up home-run honors as the
Tigers whipped the Browns twice,
4 to 3 and 10 to 1. Greonberg hit
three homers to bring his total to
41, three more than Ted Williams.
The first clout won the opening
game in the ninth inning. The other
two came in the second game.

ST. LOUIS, Sept. 24 (UP).—
I The St. Louis Cardinals staged a
I magnificent gas house gang rally
| tonight to defeat the Cincinnati
j Reds 2-1 in 10 innings and increase
their lead over idle Brooklyn to a
full game in the National League
pennant.
The Cardinals tied the score at
! 1-1 with two out in the ninth inning
| and then Ervin Dusak blasted a
homer in the tenth to break up the
| game.
The climactic blow was Dusak's
ninth home run of the year and it
ended a beautifully pitched ball
game by the Reds' ace southpaw.
Johnny Vander Meer, who had held
| the Cardinals scoreless for eight in
nings and gave up only four hits in
the 10 innings.
First baseman Stan Musial kept
the Cardinals in the ball game with
i his single in the ninth inning which
scored pinch runner Jeff Cross with
the tying run.
In winning the Cardinals contin
ued their dismal hitting slump that
i has slowed their batters down to a
little over 20 hits in their last four
j games.
Tonight the Birds threw up a
j flawless defense behind starting
pitcher Red Munger, coming up
with three sparkling double plays
j to pull the big right-hander out of
the rough spots.

Sunday if the pennant race was not
decided by then.
"I'm not as smart as that," he said,

41, three more than Ted Williams.
The first clout won the opening
