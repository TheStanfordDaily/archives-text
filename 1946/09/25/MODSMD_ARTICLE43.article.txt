# Santa Rosa First J.V. Pigskin Foe
## 
### 
Stanford's Junior Varsity football
team will take the field for the first
time next Saturday at 12 noon
against Santa Rosa J.C. on the sta
dium turf. The game will be pre
| liminary to the Stanford-Idaho con
test.
Coach Ed Stamm of the jayvees
has not yet decided on his starting
i lineup. Practice conditions have
been difficult because of registra
tion and because many of his boys
have had to devote time to taking
physical examinations for the Naval
R.O.T.C. program.
WEAK SPOT
The team's apparent weak spot is
the qb position; several of the boys |

have been injured or have not yet
learned the system. There is good
material, but some of the rough
edges will have to be smoothed.
Stamm expects to have a very
good first string line before very
long. The scrimmage against the
varsity revealed some bulwarks on
defense, such as tackles Howie
Council and Sid Smith, and end Jim
Dooley. They are still slow and a
bit uncertain on offense, but should
improve with a few additional prac
tices.
FINAL PRACTICES
There are several famous names
on the jayvee team—Dud DeGroot,
Jimmy Bradshaw, Rye, Kelley,
Sandy Keeshin, Wes Frye—all sons
of coaches and former Ail-Ameri
cans. They have all looked good so
far, but need more work. Dean
Borba, son of a well-known San
Francisco sports writer, looks good
at center, but has a lot of competi
tion. Bill Larson and Willie Altus
have shown flashes of form at half
back.
Last practices before the Santa
Rosa game will be held today and
tomorrow, with accent on defensive
drill and kicking formations. The
coaching staff is finding it difficult to
prepare for Santa Rosa, since little
is known about them, except that
they employ the T formation in
much the same way as Stanford.
