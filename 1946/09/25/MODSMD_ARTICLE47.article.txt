Defying gravity and the remarks
ot sideline observers has been the j
career of Cornelius (Dutch) Warm- j
erdam, Stanford's new assistant |
track mentor.
For Warmerdam is the only man
who has ever cleared 15 feet in the
pole vault and by the exhibitions of
the present crop of vaulters, it looks I
like his record will go unmarred for
some time.
Reared in California, and a Fresno
State grad ('3B), Dutch's rise to the
top is attributed to hard work.
"For me track has no seasons.
It's an all-year proposition. I
work just as hard in the Fall as in
the Spring," Warmerdam re
marked.
Dutch started pole vaulting in
Long' Beach High School and was
a better-than-average jumper. Dur
ing his college days at Fresno State,
he began to show promise of devej
oping into a top-flight star. Work
ing hard under the tutelage of Flint
Hannard, Dutch started to clear the
bars at 14 feet, no mean task in it
self.
After collecting his sheepskin
from Fresno he came to Stanford
for two years of grad work. Un
able to compete with the varsity
tracksters, he worked out under
trackmaster Dink Templeton.
Participating with the Olympic
Club of San Francisco, Warmerdam
began to develop into the finest
vaulter in the world*! In 1940 he
reached the unprecedented height
of 15 feet. Those who said it could
not be done had to watch "The Fly
ing Dutchman" continue to go
higher and higher. In 1943, at the
Chicago Relays, he sailed over the
bar at 15 feet 8 1-2 inches, breaking
his own record.
