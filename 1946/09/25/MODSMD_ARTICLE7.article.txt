MOSCOW, Sept. 24 (UP). Prime
Minister Joseph Stalin's Kremlin
pronouncement on international re
lations was a virtual olive branch
offered to the United States and
Great Britain and may presage a
change in Soviet foreign policy, for
eign observers believed today.
Stalin assured the American and
British peoples that there was no
danger of a new war, that the atom
bomb was not a threat to peace and
that there was no worldwide Com
munist party planning to overthrow
the world.
He assured the Western nations
that they had nothing to fear from
Soviet policy in Germany, which

he said is not aimed al using Get
many against them because such a
policy would violate the basic na
tional interests of the Soviet Union.
"I do not believe in the danger of
a new war," Stalin said in answer to
a direct question. "It is only mili
tary and political adventurers who
are talking about a new war today.
. . . We should discern between tlu
loud rumors which are going the
rounds about a new war and the
real danger of a new war, which
today does not exist."
Stalin said, "1 unconditionally be
lieve it is possible that Russia and
the Western democracies could live
side by side despite their wide ideo
logical differences."
