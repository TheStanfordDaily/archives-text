WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 (UP).-
Th? Henry J. Kaiser family's pro
duction for the war effort cost its
members gross losses of $(54,000,000
and a net deficit of about $18,000,000,
the West Coast industrialist told
the House Merchant Marine Com

mittee today.
Unable to comment upon his
present state of solvency, Kaiser
told the committee inquiring into
war shipbuilding that profits and
losses were from the four companies
which he now controls.
His prepared statement said that
the Kaiser shipbuilding enterprises
earned less than 1/10 of 1 per cent
profit on the work they did for the
Maritime Commission after deduct
ing losses of affiliated companies.
Without such deductions, it said,
Kaiser profits from shipbuilding still
would have amounted to less than
1 per cent.
