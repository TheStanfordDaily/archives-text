Henry A. Wallace came back into
the Democratic campaign fold—with
reservations—tonight on the heels

st;>ke their fight in the November
elections on a platform of "world
peace and production."
Wallace, it was revealed on high
authority, has yielded to the urg
ings of the Administration's strategy
bosses and agreed to take the stump
for "worthy" Democrats in the com
ing elections.
