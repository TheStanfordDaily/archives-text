# Lundeberg Calls Halt To Strike
## Second Walkout Looms; Waterfront Peace Threatened 
### 
SAN FKANCISCO, Sept. 25 (UP).
Harry Lundeberg, secretary of the
Sailors' Union of the Pacific (AFL),
today called his seamen back to !
work on all East and West Coast
ships, thus completely ending the
nation's worst maritime strike five
days before another was scheduled
to begin.
He issued his return-to-work or
der, effective on both government
;ind privately operated ships, im
mediately after emerging from a
closed session with officials of the
Pacific - American Shipowners' As
sociation.
TELEGRAPH LOCALS
He instructed his office to tele- |
graph locals on East and West
Coasts that provisions of the Sept.
13 government wage award had i
been put into effect, subsequent :
details ironed out, and permission ;
was therefore granted all members J
•to sign articles of sailing once more.
But over the final settlement of |
lh'.> most costly maritime strike in j
the nation's history hung the |
threat, of another tie-up next Mon- j
day. Three unions—the AFL Mas-,
ters, Mates and Pilots, the CIO Ma- J
l ine Engineers and the Internation- I
al Longshoremen's and Warehouse- j
men's Union —have contracts cxpir- |
ing on that date.
CAN'T SAIL
Without the enginers, no ships
can sail. The engineers also arc
one of the seven unions affiliated
with the ClO-dominated Committee
for Maritime Unity whose charter
calls for all members to support one
another in case of a strike by one.
They are demanding a 35 per cent
wage increase and other benefits.
Lundebcrg's announcement was an
abrupt about - facc. Only a few ,
hours earlier, in an angry denun
ciation of the U.S. Maritime Com
mission, Lundeberg cal|cd on his
sailors to stay away from work un
til the Commission put "into writ
ing" their agreement to pay the j
government-granted wage raises on
the 50 per cent of the West Coast
shipping operated "nder the Com
mission.
ALSO EAST
Ilis order was also directed to
SUP members in East Coast ports.
A further cloud was thrown over
the complicated maritime situation >
when the Masters. Mates and Pilots,
one of the unions negotiating for
new contracts, and the Pacific-
American Shipowners' Association
turned down a Labor Department
invitation to conduct negotiations in
Washington, D.C.
The three striking unions of the
Committee for Maritime Unity of
ficially called off their walkout last
Saturday at 6 p.m., 16 days after
the sailors of two AFL maritime
unions called a nationwide strike
to force the Wage Stabilization
Board to approve $5 and $10 in
creases granted by shipowners.
COMMISSION NAMED
Lundeberg today lashed out at
the Commission, charging it was
withholding formal agreement on
the wage increases awarded AFL
sailors Sept. 19.
"We want to get an agreement
signed before we put our men out |
to sea. They went out on strike to !
get what they asked for, and now ,
they've got a right to know what
the government is going to do," he
said.
LABOR SECRETARY
Schwellenbach invited the CIO
Marine Engineers and the Masters,
Mates and Pilots to confer with the
shipowners in the nation's capital |
to seek a solution to the threatened !
tie-up next Monday.
