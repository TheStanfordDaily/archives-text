## Vets' Platform Will Be Reviewed 
### 
Organization was the keynote of
the first short meeting of the Stan
ford AVC chapter held last, night at
7:.'SO p.m. in the Nitery. Under the
direction of Temporary Chairman
Pat Clark it was decided to keep the
present officers until elections could
be held in the latter part of No
vember.
The AVC is the only accredited
veterans organization on the campus
and as such members strongly urged
that all new veterans on the campus
should be contacted immediately. A
review of past activities as "Citi- j
/.ens First, and Veteran's Second" i
was presented. The AVC has: con
ducted a survey of housing on
campus and in the immediate vicin- j
ity; passed a resolution supporting
the continuance of OPA and all
other an ti-inflationary measures;
and was very active in securing
Stanford Village and worked closely
with the Student Committee on the
change over from barracks to dor
mitories.
Ernest Sorot.skin, program chair- ,
man, informed the members that
AVC had I eon asked to help the
University in a new survey of the
housing situation and a committee I
under Joe Dye was formed to carry j
this through.
The platform of the AVC, adopted j
at the National Convention and for
mulated by the National Planning
Committee was presented to the !
chapter. After discussion the chap- j
ter will approve or disapprove of all :
or part of the platform and inform
the National Organization.
In general the platform boiled
down to these aims: That AVC fa- !
vors government handling of the j
present housing crisis until the sit- ■
uation is cleared; That the right of i
collective bargaining in labor dis- ]
putes must be maintained; Thai
American democracy requires that
the rights of small business should
be upheld over big business; That
anti-trust laws must be strength
ened and maintained; That Jim
Crowism in the United States must
be attacked and wiped out; That
AVC stands opposed to universal
military training in time of peace,
but asks for an armed force large '
enough to carry out our present
commitments, and continuance of j
the draft as long as this is necssary. 1
An investigation of the On-the-job
Training Program and Federaliza
tion of the U.S.E.S. program was
also requested.
Next meeting of the organization
will be next Wednesday evening at
7:30 p.m. in the Nitery in the old j

tion of the U.S.E.S. program was
also requested.
Next meeting of the organization
will be next Wednesday evening at
7:30 p.m. in the Nitery in the old j
Union.
Organization was the keynote of
the first short meeting of the Stan
ford AVC chapter held last, night at
7:.'SO p.m. in the Nitery. Under the
direction of Temporary Chairman
Pat Clark it was decided to keep the
present officers until elections could
be held in the latter part of No
vember.
The AVC is the only accredited
veterans organization on the campus
and as such members strongly urged
that all new veterans on the campus
should be contacted immediately. A
review of past activities as "Citi- j
/.ens First, and Veteran's Second" i
was presented. The AVC has: con
ducted a survey of housing on
campus and in the immediate vicin- j
ity; passed a resolution supporting
the continuance of OPA and all
other an ti-inflationary measures;
and was very active in securing
Stanford Village and worked closely
with the Student Committee on the
change over from barracks to dor
mitories.
Ernest Sorot.skin, program chair- ,
man, informed the members that
AVC had I eon asked to help the
University in a new survey of the
housing situation and a committee I
under Joe Dye was formed to carry j
this through.
The platform of the AVC, adopted j
at the National Convention and for
mulated by the National Planning
Committee was presented to the !
chapter. After discussion the chap- j
ter will approve or disapprove of all :
or part of the platform and inform
the National Organization.
In general the platform boiled
down to these aims: That AVC fa- !
vors government handling of the j
present housing crisis until the sit- ■
uation is cleared; That the right of i
collective bargaining in labor dis- ]
putes must be maintained; Thai
American democracy requires that
the rights of small business should
be upheld over big business; That
anti-trust laws must be strength
ened and maintained; That Jim
Crowism in the United States must
be attacked and wiped out; That
AVC stands opposed to universal
military training in time of peace,
but asks for an armed force large '
enough to carry out our present
commitments, and continuance of j
the draft as long as this is necssary. 1
An investigation of the On-the-job
Training Program and Federaliza
tion of the U.S.E.S. program was
also requested.
