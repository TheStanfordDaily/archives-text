WASHINGTON, Sept. 25 (UP).—
Charges that a biff shipbuilding
company piled up a wartime profit
of 4,055 per cent on its capital in
vestment were made—and promptly
removed from the record—today at
a stormy congressional hearing on
shipyard profits.
The accuser was Nathaniel Gen
natt, assistant counsel for the House
Merchant Marine Cofnmittce which
is trying to find out whether Amer
ica's shipbuilders made too much
money for their war work.
Committeemen, wearied after a
full day of trying to understand
shipyard finance from the lips of
Henry J. Kaiser and other ship
magnates, awoke with a bang when
Gennatt named the New England
Shipbuilding Corp., of South Port
land, Me., as the 4,055-per center.
Rep. Eugene Keogh (D-NY)
protested vigorously. He asked
where the committee counsel got
his figures. Gennatt said they had
just been testified to by witness Mi
chael N. Stoler, an accountant of
New England Shipbuilding who said
the firm's initial investment in ship
yards was $278,000 and its gross war
profits were $11,613,000.
That, said Gennatt, figured out to
4,055 per cent. Keogh argued, how
ever, that the statement was unfair
because it failed to take into account
■ill the various financial factors in
volved, including the fact that the
gloss profits mentioned were before
taxes and renegotiation.
Chairman Schuyler O. Bland (D-
Va) upheld Keogh and ordered the
reference stricken from the record.
