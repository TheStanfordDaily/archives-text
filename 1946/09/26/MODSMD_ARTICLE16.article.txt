# Special Excom Election Scheduled in Two Weeks
## Appointment of Committee For Student Union Pending 
### 
In a business-like Excom meeting last night, the committee
voted to run off a special election in two weeks as its work is
hampered by a lack of voting members.
The constitution does not provide for an election until the
sixth week. Bob Ayres, Election Board chairman, will suggest
next week what shall be included in the special ballot.

An amendment to the constitu
tion to provide for representation
for Stanford Village will have to be
voted upon. It will be necessary t<>
have a larger Excom or each Excom
representative will have to repre
sent more students than he now
does, Anderson said.
KX-OFFICIO
Village Counsellors Fred Hanson,
Bill Foster, Stan Owen, and Km

Council, two Excom representatives
from men's Row, a graduate repre
sentative, one from Toyon, one from

ner.
A.S.S.U. president Martin Andet
son said that Excom's main purpose
this year will b*? to see that. Stan
ford students have a happy year.
"Wo don't want to tackle tilings
over which we have no power," he
said "although we will make sug
gestions to the Administrtion on
problems that occur."
Anderson said that one of the
main jobs of Excom this year will
be to promote a new student Union
if there is a student demand for it.
A committee will be appointed next,
week to find a way to finance the
building, determine student support
through a possible poll, and work
gestions to the Administration on
for the Union.
VOTE TO SUGGEST
Excom members voted to suggest
to the Union Board of Governors
that the Cellar remain open all day

In a business-like Excom meeting last night, the committee
voted to run off a special election in two weeks as its work is
hampered by a lack of voting members.
The constitution does not provide for an election until the
sixth week. Bob Ayres, Election Board chairman, will suggest
next week what shall be included in the special ballot.

An amendment to the constitu
tion to provide for representation
for Stanford Village will have to be
voted upon. It will be necessary t<>
have a larger Excom or each Excom
representative will have to repre
sent more students than he now
does, Anderson said.
KX-OFFICIO
Village Counsellors Fred Hanson,
Bill Foster, Stan Owen, and Km
Husby are ex-officio representatives
until the regular representatives arc
elected.
Also to be elected this fall are one
member to the Stanford Athletic
Council, three members to men's
Council, two Excom representatives
from men's Row, a graduate repre
sentative, one from Toyon, one from
Encina, and one from Roble-Bran
ner.
A.S.S.U. president Martin Andet
son said that Excom's main purpose
this year will b*? to see that. Stan
ford students have a happy year.
"Wo don't want to tackle tilings
over which we have no power," he
said "although we will make sug
gestions to the Administrtion on
problems that occur."
Anderson said that one of the
main jobs of Excom this year will
be to promote a new student Union
if there is a student demand for it.
A committee will be appointed next,
week to find a way to finance the
building, determine student support
through a possible poll, and work
gestions to the Administration on
for the Union.
VOTE TO SUGGEST
Excom members voted to suggest
to the Union Board of Governors
that the Cellar remain open all day
if it is possible and practical.
