# Daily Tryouts

### 
"The Peninsula's Only Morning Newspa
per," the Stanlord Daily, begins its tryoutee
period for untried and hitherto unknown talent
this afternoon.
The door to the green shack next to the
Journalism Building has always been open to
interested spectators or prospective newspa
per men and women, but for the next ten days
these men and women will be given special
welcome and training in order that they may
join the editoiial staff who worries out andther
edition five days a week.
During the war the possibilities for a new
reporter on the Daily to discover for himself,
by long hours and not too much instruction,
tho idiosyncrasies of a college daily were
great. In this quasi post-war era, the Daily
can offer its neophytes much more in the
realm of actual newspaper experience and in
struction.
This will partially be due to the Daily's
belie! that in line with the influx of experi

enced men throughout all college life, this
experience will come to the shack with re
turning staff men, and the initiate on the Daily
will find a friendly and more mature attitude
to work with than might otherwise be found.
The "tightly knit" group of the Daily, a
phrase shied away from by staff members
since it applies to understanding and not con
victions, supplies its workers with a real
"campus within a campus."
Of course, there is always the opportunity
for a staff member to meet and perhaps know
the great and near-great on the campus. The
advantage in this lies, we think in the chance
for a development of discrimination by per
sons who are admittedly growing up and are
searching for a "measuring stick" for the peo
ple around them.
Perhaps the Daily and what it means to its
present and past staff members will be right
up your alley. The meeting is at 4 p.m. this
afternoon. —M.M.
