# BILL COUGHLIN
## BULL SESSION 
### 
The first day of classes is a thing of the past, in
numerable leetle blue cards have been filled out,
prols have grimaced at the hords confronting them,
the mob from the Ad Building has descended upon
the Bookstore, and strong men and delicate women
still shudder at the thought of that reg day.
Stories on that brawl will undoubtedly take their
place along with those of Doodles Weaver and the
Immortal 21 as part of Stanford's legends. As one
of the Vets from the Village so neatly put it, if the
Japs had done it, it would have been a war crime.
Nomination for victim of one of the cruelest
blows of all goes to one of the lads from Toyon.
Alter battling his way forward for three vicious
hours, he finally reached the window only to be
informed, "Sorry, you owe the Civ Libe 35 cents for
a book overdue in '42. Until that is paid, we can't
issue your reg book."
ife's a bitter man.

Two returned members of one of the local longs
decided, following their Battle of the Bilge on Keg
Day, to quench their thirst with a few brews at. a
behind-campus establishment. One good thing led
to another and several hours passed before they
began wending their way homeward.
As they passed Roble, they noted one of their
bros. assisting a shy young frosh assemble her ward
robe closet, which she had just purchased downtown.
They eagerly pitched in to aid the construction proj
ect. After fifteen minutes, they had almost succeeded
in wrecking it and one of our two heroes was trapped
inside the thing. After liberating him by taking it
apart again, they continued on their merry way, leav

ing their friend and his gal to reassemble the sham
bles into a wardrobe as best they could.
They still can't understand why he's mad.
* * *
Incidentally, this seems as good a place as any to
toss a compliment to Stanford's Veterans Adminis
tration officials. They handled the vast and compli
cated job of registering the vets with great efficiency
and a minimum of standing in line. Their procedure
at Memorial Hall, which involved the filling out of
many complicated forms, was amazingly simple and
rapid.
I hope that the University takes a few lessons
from them and on future reg days avoids the confu
sion of the last two.
I say again, a cheer for the V.A.

Speaking of cheers, have you noted the one in
Rallycom's latest booklet which goes, "Slow 'm in
the tepee, ugh, ugh"?
Ugh, ugh!

That old, old gag about four out of every five
women are beautiful and the fifth goes to Stanford
is on the way out. From the observation of my
jaundiced eye in yesterday's initial classes, it.appears
that the current crop of Stanford femmes is of higher
caliber than I remember in days of yore. Of course,
it might be that my ideals are getting lower as the
years pass, but c'est la vie.
Amazingly enough, many of this luscious crop
went without dates for the Keg Dance. It seems that
many of the 'i.l instead of battling for their I are
all going down for a 3.2 together.

the mob from the Ad Building has descended upon
the Bookstore, and strong men and delicate women
still shudder at the thought of that reg day.
Stories on that brawl will undoubtedly take their
place along with those of Doodles Weaver and the
Immortal 21 as part of Stanford's legends. As one
of the Vets from the Village so neatly put it, if the
Japs had done it, it would have been a war crime.
Nomination for victim of one of the cruelest
blows of all goes to one of the lads from Toyon.
Alter battling his way forward for three vicious
hours, he finally reached the window only to be
informed, "Sorry, you owe the Civ Libe 35 cents for
a book overdue in '42. Until that is paid, we can't
issue your reg book."

Two returned members of one of the local longs
decided, following their Battle of the Bilge on Keg
Day, to quench their thirst with a few brews at. a
behind-campus establishment. One good thing led
to another and several hours passed before they
began wending their way homeward.
As they passed Roble, they noted one of their
bros. assisting a shy young frosh assemble her ward
robe closet, which she had just purchased downtown.
They eagerly pitched in to aid the construction proj
ect. After fifteen minutes, they had almost succeeded
in wrecking it and one of our two heroes was trapped
inside the thing. After liberating him by taking it
apart again, they continued on their merry way, leav

ing their friend and his gal to reassemble the sham
bles into a wardrobe as best they could.
They still can't understand why he's mad.

Incidentally, this seems as good a place as any to
toss a compliment to Stanford's Veterans Adminis
tration officials. They handled the vast and compli
cated job of registering the vets with great efficiency
and a minimum of standing in line. Their procedure
at Memorial Hall, which involved the filling out of
many complicated forms, was amazingly simple and
rapid.
I hope that the University takes a few lessons
from them and on future reg days avoids the confu
sion of the last two.
I say again, a cheer for the V.A.

Speaking of cheers, have you noted the one in
Rallycom's latest booklet which goes, "Slow 'm in
the tepee, ugh, ugh"?
Ugh, ugh!

That old, old gag about four out of every five
women are beautiful and the fifth goes to Stanford
is on the way out. From the observation of my
jaundiced eye in yesterday's initial classes, it.appears
that the current crop of Stanford femmes is of higher
caliber than I remember in days of yore. Of course,
it might be that my ideals are getting lower as the
years pass, but c'est la vie.
Amazingly enough, many of this luscious crop
went without dates for the Keg Dance. It seems that
many of the 'i.l instead of battling for their I are
all going down for a 3.2 together.
The first day of classes is a thing of the past, in
numerable leetle blue cards have been filled out,
prols have grimaced at the hords confronting them,
the mob from the Ad Building has descended upon
the Bookstore, and strong men and delicate women
still shudder at the thought of that reg day.
