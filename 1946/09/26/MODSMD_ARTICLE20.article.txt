## HISTORY 1946 
### 
Readers of this column will have a lot of fun this
quarter (why NOT advertise your column?) when
my fellow-scribe and political dopester Ted Norton
will give you politics play-by-play from two differ
ent angles.
Ted is a Republican, though not a diehard (says
lie) and 1 incline toward the Demos, but am no all
out backer of Truman and his Kansas City Hoys.
Now that you've been briefed we'll discuss the
latest popular parlor game: 800 - Hen ry-al lace. ThÂ«
jules are simple you collect a group of kindred
.spirits and take Uurns denouncing Wallace for
wrecking our foreign policy, for being an impractical
dreamer, a meddling busybody, too friendly with
Russia or not friendly enough with Russia. Last
successful denouncer in your group sends Henry A.
a copy of "How to Win Friends, etc."
Seen from this corner, Wallace got a raw deal.
He wanted to make a speech on foreign policy. He
knew the speech would be controversial. So, reason
ably enough, he first saw the boss. The boss gave
him the go-ahead. Wallace made his speech. The
Communists didn't like it and, what's more impor
tant, th* 3 powers that be didn't like it. Wallace was
fired.
There are only two explanations of Truman's ac
tion: he is either so amazingly stupid that he didn't
understand the speech or he deliberately double

crossed his Secretary of Commerce. It's bad either
Way.
With the removal of Wallace the Democrats' top
leadership has purged itself completely of liberal
elements. The cabinet Truman inherited had three
outstanding progressives: Frances Perkins, Harold
hikes, and Wallace. They're all gone now.
Normalcy is here again. Both parties have re
turned to their traditional conservatism. The Na
tional Association of Manufacturers and all Iheii
unlimiled-profits-at-any-cost friends can once more
sleep in peace.
This official swing to the right will probably cost
the Democrats their majority in Congress this fall.
It will almost certainly cost them the Presidency in
1948, for the Democrats can only win as the party of
liberalism with the full and active support of labor.
It no longer has the support of labor. When the
people have to choose between two conservative
parties, they traditionally pick the Republican. Wit
ness the long and almost uninterrupted string of Re
publican Presidents between 1800 and 19.10,
I do not seem to live up to my promised support
of the Democrats. However, in the coming California
elections (among others) there is a more clearcut
issue between progressives and reaction. I'll have
comments about the Will Rogers vs. Knowland cam
paign later.
