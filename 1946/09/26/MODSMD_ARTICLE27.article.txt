## 
### 
NEW YORK, Sept. 25 (UP). —
Death came in the afternoon today
to the Brooklyn Dodger dreams, and
the executioners were the long-tor
mented Phillies, who put over five
runs in the ninth for an 11 to 9 vic
tory which all but ended the pen
nant fight of the gallant men from
Flatbush.
Playing the worst baseball they
have displayed in weeks, the Dod
ders fought until the final out, hut
this time gumcness wasn't enough.
All they had left was their will to
win and this was the day the Phils
chose, to outdo them even in that
department.
By losing the three-hour and
thirty-seven minute struggle, the
Dodgers remained a full game be
hind the Cardinals with but three
games remaining.
The greatest Dodger of them all,
Dixie Walker, failed his team
mates in the' ninth when he could
have made himself a hero of
heroes. He ended the game by
Hying out to left, leaving (lie ty
ing run on (he bases.
The Phillies tightened the noose
around Brooklyn's neck in the ninth
hut the Dodgers didn't give up.
Augie Gulan started their half of
the ninth with a single. Eddie
Stanky hit into a doubleplay, but
Eddie Stevens, batting for Kirby
1 iij^l>y, the eighth Dodger pitcher,
singled and Pete Reiser walked.
That gave Dixie his opportunity to
; hirie brightly but there was no
shine in him.
Virtually every kind of weird
and woblily baseball in the books
studded the game and the Dodgers
were no less guilty than the Phils,
whom they had beaten 1(5 times
out of 2(1 (his season and 2(1 out
of 22 last year.
Dodger youngster Ralph Branca,
who started, brought a string of 22
scoreless innings into the game, but
bis rival moundsman, Oscar Judd,
ended that with a third-inning in
side-the-park home run. The ball
angled off the right center wall
away from Walker like a trick shot
in a billiard parlor.
SPORTSMANS PARK. St. Louis,
Sept. 25 (UP). —The Cincinnati reds
checked the Cardinals' pennant rush
tonight and cut their lead over the

| Brooklyn Dodgers to a single game
as Bucky Walters pitched a 6 to 0
victory.
Bucky Walters baffled the Birds
with a brilliant assortment of
curves to gain his tenth victory of
the season and his third decision
over the Cardinals on a 7-hit
shutout.
The Reds salted the game away
early for the converted infielder,
scoring three runs in the fourth in
a four-hit assault on starting pitcher
Murry Dickson.
Ray Mueller started it off with a
: single to ccr.tcr. *A moment latei;
he scored the only run Walters
1 needed when Eddie Lukon tripled
to right center. Lukon crossed the
{ plate on Bob Adams' single to right,
I moved to third on Dain Clay's ace
to center and came in when Walters
! laid down a perfect squeeze bunt.
. Walters proved his mastery in
the first inning of the game, when
he bore down to retire the next
j three batters and strand Red
Schoendienst who had opened the
game with a solid double to cen
ter.
He dole out a stingy ration of
base hits, one to the inning, until
the ninth when he allowed a two
out single by Terry Moore arid a
double by Joe Garagiola. But he
held them away from the plate when
he forced Marty Marion to close out
the game on an easy fly to center
fielder Dain Clay.
Bob Feller lost to the White
Sox, 4-1, but crept up within six
of Uube Waddell's strikeout rec
i ord by whilling ten, and will go
after the ,'s4.'{ mark Friday at De
troit.

Sox beat the Yanks, 5-2; St. Louis
snapped Detroit's ten-game win-
I ning streak, 8-7; Washington took a
