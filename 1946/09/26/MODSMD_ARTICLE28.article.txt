# Seals Win 3-0 Behind Jansen
## 
### 
Jumping off to a quick lead, San
Francisco's Pacific Coast League
champs, defeated the Hollywood
Stars 3 to 0 last night at Seal's Sta
dium to take a one-game margin in
the President's Cup play-offs.
Larry Jansen notched his thir
ty-first win of the season—and
one of his classiest—as he white
washed the Twinks. Jansen struck
out eight, walked only one and
scattered six hits.
The games other standout was
Neil Sheridan who slammed out a
double in the first inning to drive in
two runs, got another pair of bin
gles, and cut one of the visitors off
at the plate with an accurate throw.

Oakland's Acorns topped the
Los Angeles Angels by a score of
3 to 1 in the other half of the
President's Cup playoff schedule
with Shea playing six-hit ball.

Aldon Wilkie pitched creditable
ball for the Stars, but his usually
free-hitting teammates were com
pletely stymied by Jansen's mound
mastery.
Tonight it will be A 1 Lien of the
Seals against Eddie Erautt, the
Star's fastballing 20-game winner
who leads the league in strikeouts.
