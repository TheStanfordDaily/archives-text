# 'Big Red' Eleven Bustles As Zero Hour Approaches
## Heavy Drill Slated By Card Mentor 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
"Heck no, let's run some more j
plays!" That was the impolite an- j
swer to the query, "What shall we j
do now, go in?" at the close of I
yesterday's practice session. It was
a long, grueling workout that lasted |
two hours, and which featured a |
little of almost everything. -
Coach Marchie Schwartz started j
the afternoon by dividing his squad, I
taking the backs and ends himself
and leaving the linemen with Phil j
Bengtson. The backs and ends went |
through a drill on passing and pass |
defense while the boys with the j
strong backs charged at the ma

The two groups rejoined after an

tackling session that some of the
boys wanted to run more plays—
and actually started to—but Mar
chie decided enough was enough
and merely sent all hands around
the field twice at a gallop. And the
funny part is, they seemed to like it.
George "Polar Bear"' Quist (the
blondest man on the team) is
looking more rugged every day.i
He is the first man of the year to
tear down a tackling dummy— I
and ALMOST got dummy nuin- j
her two.
As usual, Dave DeSwarte was i
making beautiful catches from ev
ery angle, but so was almost every
body else. It remains to be seen
whether the pressure of game con
ditions will make any difference in
their efficiency. Good on pass de
fense was Freddy Parsons, whose
speed stood him in good stead.
The tentative starting lineup an- !
nounced by Marchie Schwartz to (
the Football Writers' Association i
last Monday noon is still tentative. |
It consists of DeSwarte and Hall at j
the ends. Boensch and Cox at the |
tackles, Hachten and Bernhard at j
the guards, August at center, Zap- |
