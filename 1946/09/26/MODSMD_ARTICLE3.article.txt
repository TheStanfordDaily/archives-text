# 'Big Red' Eleven Bustles As Zero Hour Approaches
## Heavy Drill Slated By Card Mentor 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
"Heck no, let's run some more j
plays!" That was the impolite an- j
swer to the query, "What shall we j
do now, go in?" at the close of I
yesterday's practice session. It was
a long, grueling workout that lasted |
two hours, and which featured a |
little of almost everything. -
Coach Marchie Schwartz started j
the afternoon by dividing his squad, I
taking the backs and ends himself
and leaving the linemen with Phil j
Bengtson. The backs and ends went |
through a drill on passing and pass |
defense while the boys with the j
strong backs charged at the ma
chine.
The two groups rejoined after an
hour and ran off plays at top speed,
going from that directly to the tack
ling dummies. It was after the
tackling session that some of the
boys wanted to run more plays—
and actually started to—but Mar
chie decided enough was enough
and merely sent all hands around
the field twice at a gallop. And the
funny part is, they seemed to like it.
George "Polar Bear"' Quist (the
blondest man on the team) is
looking more rugged every day.i
He is the first man of the year to
tear down a tackling dummy— I
and ALMOST got dummy nuin- j
her two.
As usual, Dave DeSwarte was i
making beautiful catches from ev
ery angle, but so was almost every
body else. It remains to be seen
whether the pressure of game con
ditions will make any difference in
their efficiency. Good on pass de
fense was Freddy Parsons, whose
speed stood him in good stead.
The tentative starting lineup an- !
nounced by Marchie Schwartz to (
the Football Writers' Association i
last Monday noon is still tentative. |
It consists of DeSwarte and Hall at j
the ends. Boensch and Cox at the |
tackles, Hachten and Bernhard at j
the guards, August at center, Zap- |
petini and Parsons at the halves,
Merriman at lb, and Forbes at qb.
The University of Idaho has also
come out with a starting lineup
which is subject to change with
out notice—Aldred and Buoy at
ends, Viro and Zenkevitch at
tackles, Barnes and Potter at
guards, Paasch at center. Hatch
and Christensen at halves, Mik
li<*h at fh. and Munson at qh.
Not much is known about these
boys down in this part of the coun
try, except that Jim Hatch was a
ball of fire last year, and that 200-
pound Bill Miklich was the leading
scorer of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence before he wandered off to join
the Marines.

Want to eat and travel with
the football team this season?
Murray Prusmack, the head
football manager, is in the mar
ket for assistant managers. Ev
eryone interested in this soil of
a job, which incidentally will
satisfy the lower division phy
sical education requirement, sec
Prusmack in Room 125 of the
MAC Building this afternoon at
4:15.

Another stiff practice is scheduled |
for this afternoon at 2:30, and will I
last two hours — until after dark, |
that is. It will be much the same j
as (hat of yesterday—play running, J
passing drill (offensive and defen- j
sive), a session at the tackling dum- |
mies, and wind sprints. All in all, j
it will be a rugged day, especially
for the poor backs who run the j
flankers.
Game time Saturday is at 2:30 !
p.m., but the gates and ticket booths
will open at 11 o'clock in deference j
lo those who want to see the jay- ;
vees fight it out with Santa Rosa
J.C. No seats will be reserved for j
the same with Idaho.

As usual, Dave DeSwarte was i
making beautiful catches from ev
ery angle, but so was almost every
body else. It remains to be seen
whether the pressure of game con
ditions will make any difference in
their efficiency. Good on pass de
fense was Freddy Parsons, whose
speed stood him in good stead.
The tentative starting lineup an- !
nounced by Marchie Schwartz to (
the Football Writers' Association i
last Monday noon is still tentative. |
It consists of DeSwarte and Hall at j
the ends. Boensch and Cox at the |
tackles, Hachten and Bernhard at j
the guards, August at center, Zap- |
petini and Parsons at the halves,
Merriman at lb, and Forbes at qb.
The University of Idaho has also
come out with a starting lineup
which is subject to change with
out notice—Aldred and Buoy at
ends, Viro and Zenkevitch at
tackles, Barnes and Potter at
guards, Paasch at center. Hatch
and Christensen at halves, Mik
li<*h at fh. and Munson at qh.
Not much is known about these
boys down in this part of the coun
try, except that Jim Hatch was a
ball of fire last year, and that 200-
pound Bill Miklich was the leading
scorer of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence before he wandered off to join
the Marines.

sical education requirement, sec
Prusmack in Room 125 of the
MAC Building this afternoon at
4:15.

Another stiff practice is scheduled |
for this afternoon at 2:30, and will I
last two hours — until after dark, |
that is. It will be much the same j
as (hat of yesterday—play running, J
passing drill (offensive and defen- j
sive), a session at the tackling dum- |
mies, and wind sprints. All in all, j
it will be a rugged day, especially
for the poor backs who run the j
flankers.

"Heck no, let's run some more j
plays!" That was the impolite an- j
swer to the query, "What shall we j
do now, go in?" at the close of I
yesterday's practice session. It was
a long, grueling workout that lasted |
two hours, and which featured a |
little of almost everything. -
Coach Marchie Schwartz started j
the afternoon by dividing his squad, I
taking the backs and ends himself
and leaving the linemen with Phil j
Bengtson. The backs and ends went |
through a drill on passing and pass |
defense while the boys with the j
strong backs charged at the ma
chine.
The two groups rejoined after an
hour and ran off plays at top speed,
going from that directly to the tack
ling dummies. It was after the
tackling session that some of the
boys wanted to run more plays—
and actually started to—but Mar
chie decided enough was enough
and merely sent all hands around
the field twice at a gallop. And the
funny part is, they seemed to like it.
