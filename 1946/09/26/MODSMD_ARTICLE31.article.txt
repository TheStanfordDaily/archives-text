SAN FRANCISCO. Sept. 25 (UP).
-The lid comes off the first full
blown collegiate football season
since 1941 this week-end — and
somewhere in the neighborhood of
IJOO.OOO Pacific Coast fans will yell
themselves hoarse as the Simon
pure muscle-men display their tal
t nts in the gaudiest of all sports
shows.
The show gets under way Friday
night when highly touted Univer
sity of Southern California Trojans
meet big and tough Washington
State College in the Los Angeles
Coliseum. The men of Troy are
rated as the best prospect in the west
to make a fourth consecutive trip to
the Rose Bowl and on the strength
of this are expected to draw upward
of 50.000 for their opener.
A big-time intersectional clash
headlines the hill of fare on Sat
urday afternoon when California
entertains Wisconsin. California
admittedly isn't the class of the
west, and the Badgers aren't rated
better than mid-way in the Big
Ten. hut the struggle is expected

to attract at least fift.ooo fans to
the Berkeley Stadium.
UCLA plays host to what is doped j
to be a powerful Oregon State Col
lege team the same afternoon—in
another extravaganza that should |
draw about 35,000.
Jumping 'way up north, the col
orful St. Mary's College club goes i
back to Coach Jim Phelan's old
stamping grounds to meet Univer- |
sity of Washington in a battle that
already has sold 45,000 ducats.
Coach Amos Alonzo Stagg, start
ing his 57th year of coaching, takes
his College of Pacific squad north I
to tangle with University of Oregon I
I —with only dim hopes of winning;
and power-laden Fresno State en
tertains underdog (imagine!) Santa
Clara in other big-time Saturday
| games.
Just to complete the picture, on
j Sunday University of San rraneisco j
! Dons, rated by many as the probable
standout independent in the west
| this year, takes on another huge j
Nevada club at Kezar that should
draw about "40 000.
