### 
DALLAS, Tex., Sept. 25 (UP).-
The fastest field of touring golf pro
fessionals since tin* Golden Gate
Open tees off tomorrow in the open
ing round ,of the $10,000 Dallas
Open, with top money winner Ben
Hogan predicting a four over par
284 will win first prize.
Bantam Ben, the former Texas
caddy now playing out of Hershey,
Pa., voiced the consensus of the
name players in saying that the tight
greens and long fairways of Brook
Hollow Country Club's 6,789-yard

layout would stifle the hopes of any
sizzling sub-par totals by the end
of th<' 72-hole medal play Sunday.
