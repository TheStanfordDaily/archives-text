# Reds Reject Economy Plan

UNITED NATIONS HQ., LAKE
SUCCESS, N.Y., Sept. 25 (UP).—
Russia rejected in the United Na
tions Economic and Social Council
today proposals to overhaul Eu
rope's strangled economy by bind
ing the war-blighted countries into
a sort of economic United States of
Europe.
Nikolai Fconov, the Soviet Un
ion's delegate, clashed with John
Winant of the United States when
he termed the report of the Coun
cil's subeommission on devastated
areas "impractical.".
REDS WANT REVISION
Feonov declared to the Council,
which was sitting as a committee of
the whole to consider the report,
that the subeommission had in no
way fulfilled its duty. Russia, he
said, wanted the recommendations
completely revised and corrected.
He attacked as "irrelevant" the
proposal of the United States, the
United Kingdom and Poland for an
economic commission to supervise
the carrying out of the recommen
dations of the report. If such a body
were set up, he added, the United
States should not be on it.
The 450-page reconstruction re
port, compiled after three months
of study, urged that food, man
power — including technicians—and
raw materials be distributed freely
among needy nations by the "have
nations," that trade barriers be
struck down and that a single con
tinent-wide electric power system
be established.
Winant strongly supported setting
up an economic commission to pro
vide machinery for carrying out
the report's recommendations. The
United States, he said in replying
to Feonov, deserved representation
on the Council because it is one of
the chief occupation forces in Eu
rope.
The conflict between Russia and
the United States over trade bar
riers also was accentuated today
when Feonov ripped into the re
port's general criticism of bilateral
trade agreements — the type which
Russia has worked out with her
satellite states along her border and
more recently with Sweden.
