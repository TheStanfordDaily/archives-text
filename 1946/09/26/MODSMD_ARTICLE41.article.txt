### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 24 (UP).
â€”Archie Brown, Communist party
write-in candidate for Governor in
the November elections, tonight
promised Gov. Earl Warren a "real
fight" in his campaign for re-elec
tion.
In a speech broadcast over radio
station KPO, Brown said:
"The other day Governor Earl
Warren, my opponent in this elec
tion, told the press he is taking se
riously the Communist write-in
campaign against him. That's mighty
nic of the Governor. I want to tell
Mr. Warren that before this cam
paign is over he'll know he's been in
a real fight."
Brown said his party stands for
"state and federal government that
will heed the voice of the people,
rather than the voice of the pres
sure boys of Wall tSreet."
"I believe as the late President
Roosevelt did that the only sure
guarantee of peace is co-operation
between our country and the So
viet Union, the two mightiest na
tions on earth," Brown said.
