SPOKANE, Wash., Sept. 25 (UP), j
—The United States is not spoiling |
for a war with Russia, as purported j
by Henry Wallace, Gen. George C. j
Kenney, commander of the Stra- J
tegic Air Command, said today.
Speaking before the Chamber of j
Commerce. General Kenney said he i
was satisfied that "no nation on i
earth desires a war — the atomic j
bomb has made warfare impracti
cal."
"Military leaders, more than any !
other group, are aware of the ter- I
rible implications of modern war* j
fare and are anxious to steer clear j
of it," assured Kenney.
"We do not want war with Rus- |
sia and I am sure Russia has no de
sire to fight us. The atomic bomb
has destroyed the value of practical j
military strategy."
