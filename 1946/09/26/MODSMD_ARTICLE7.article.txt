# Ship's Radioactivity Denied by Navy Men
## 
### 
The 12th Naval District Head
quarters denied last night that 75
atom bomb test ships had been
quarantined until they had been
made more "radiologically safe."
Spokesmen from the headquar
ters announced that the ships
were in part radioactive but not
to any dangerous degree that
would endanger human life. The
ships, part of an Army-Navy task
force that carried 40.000 men
through the Bikini tests, are
berthed on the West Coast and at
Pearl Harbor. Beforehand, Oper
ation Crossroads in the Washing
ton, D.C., headquarters said that
an unexpected "radioactive resi
due" was found in the salt water
lines and condensers of some of
the returning vessels when they
underwent a precautionary cheek.
Capt. George M. Lyon, task
force safety officer, said, ' : Wc
have not had any casualties dur
ing Operation Crossroads and we
most certainly arc not going to
take any chances now."
Checks are continuing on all
test ships to determine the actual
amount of radioactivity.
