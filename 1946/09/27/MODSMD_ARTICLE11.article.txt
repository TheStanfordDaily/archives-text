# Cheers to Lift Stadium's Dust
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
Stanford's stadium, empty for four
years, will once more echo with the
cheers of a noisy, enthusiastic root
ing section, as Stanford students
gather at 2:30 p.m. Saturday to
checr the mighty Red Machine on
to victory over Idaho.
Roos Brothers has added color to j
the picture by giving Stanfordites
red feathers, rooting caps, and meg
aphones. Because the run on these j
articles at the Shack was so great, i
Roos has promised that more feath
ers and megaphones will be dis
tributed at the game.
Rally Com has requested that the
rooting section, if possible, be all
attired in either white shirts,
blouses, or sweaters. Card stunts
will not be used during the game,
but according to Bonnie Hansen
and Din Foster, eo-chairmmen of
Rally Com, the committee hopes to
schedule two practice games using
the cards before the Big Game with
Cal when the cards will be definite
ly used.
Although no special tickets need
be purchased by rooters, a student
body card must be shown at the
gate. The rooting section will not
be divided into men and women at
any of the games with the excep
tion of the Big Game.
