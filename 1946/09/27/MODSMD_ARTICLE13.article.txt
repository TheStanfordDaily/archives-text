# CARDS OPEN 2-1 CHOICE OVER IDAHO
## Boensch Named Captain For Saturday Contest 33-Man Vandal Vandal Arrives Today; Light Workouts Slated for Stadium 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
Stanford's Indians take off on the long road (to Pasadena?)
tomorrow afternoon, riding the tide of somebody's optimism as
2-1 favorites with a two-toucrhdown handicap, against the Idaho
Vandals at the Stadium before a guesstimated 20,000.
Coach Marchie Schwartz last night named veteran left tackle

•Freddie Bocnsch as game captain, a
move greeted by wild huzzahs and
much handclapping. Idaho guard
Merrill Barnes will be Boensch's
opposite number.
Ainslec Bell, Stanford's ailing
will not start, but will see action
according to Schwartz. Special
braces for bis injured left knee
have not yet arrived, but he will
be able to play without them. Bell
will not strt, but will see action
some time during (he afternoon.
Yesterday afternoon ("tie varsity
gridders went through their final
heavy workout before meeting Ida
ho. Today I bey will merely don
game uniforms and take a light drill
! on the stadium turf.
The Vandals will arrive in Oak
land (his morning, and arc expected
at Palo Alto soon after, where they
will put up at the President Hotel.
At some time during the day they
plan to journey to the stadium,
where they will also take a light
workout.
This Idaho team is otic of the
many that uses the T-formation
(popularized among the colleges by
Stanford), but there is an infinite
number of variations possible. Only
Coach Babe Brown and his men
know what they have up their col
lective sleeve, and they obviously
arc not telling.
The 33 Vandal gridders are re
ported to be in good physical condi
tion, and they are all rather large
young gentlemen. Their eight tac
kles (only four of which could make
the trip, unfortunately) average
more than 225 pounds per man. The
smallest of the bunch, ex-Marine
Dick Nelson, is a mere runt of 198
pounds. Whether or not they have
speed to go with the beef will be re
vealed tomorrow.
Two promising fullbacks are
slated to lock horns—Lloyd Mcr
; rirnan and Vandal Bill Miklich.
Lloyd lias been looking great in
practice, and if Miklich regains
his prewar form (he led the Con
ference in scoring in 1!)41), the
fans are due for a fine exhibition
of fullbacking.
Marchie Schwartz has announced
he will stick to the starting lineup
he announced earlier this week, un
less Stanford kicks off. In that case
Wakefield will be in to do the kick
ing, and Marchie may also start "a
taller quarterback" than Frankie
Forbes as added insurance on pass
defense. (Note: Buck Brownson is
taller than Frankie Forbes.)
Aubrey Devine, the little south
paw qb, is slated to see a lot of ac
tion, both on offense and defense.
He is held in high esteem for his de
fensive work, and is also quite a
passer.
The Stanford gridders want to
win this first one badly, and are
pointing for it. When two strange
teams without advance informa
tion 011 each other clash, a few
mistakes or a little slow thinking
on cither side can decide the Issue.
The Cards are driving hard, and
they don't intend to be defeated
by their own mistakes.
Yesterday's practice was another
tough one. Schwartz again had the
boys running through passing and
signal drill. It came to a close with
some spirited charging, after dark.
The boys, though tired, were still
enthusiastic and ready for more.
In dummy practice the first string
line was hitting hard enough to
blast a hole through the stadium
wall, and it's really unfair to single
any one of them out for special
plaudits; they all looked rough and
ready.
Vandal Coach Babe Brown is ex
pected to stick fairly close io his
announced starting lineup. It con
sists of Aldred and Buoy at ends,
Viro and Zenkevitch at tackles, Pot
ter and Captain Merril Barnes at
guards, Paasch at center, Christen
sen and the sensational Jim Hatch
at halves, Carl Munson at qb. and
high-scoring Bill Miklich at fb.
The Stanford lineup (barring un
foreseen last-minute developments)
consists of Dave DeSwarte and Bob
Hall at ends (Jack Eller may pos
sibly be in at the kickofT in place of
Hall). Boensch and Jim Cox at tac
kles, Bill Hachten and Harvey
Bernhard at the guards, Pete Au
gust at center, Don Zappetini and
Freddy Parsons at halves, Frankie
Forbes at qb, and Lloyd Merriman
at fb.
Game time is 2:30 p.m., but gates
and ticket offices will open at 11
out of deference to the jayvees, who
play a tough Santa Rosa J.C. outfit.

his prewar form (he led the Con
ference in scoring in 1!)41), the
fans are due for a fine exhibition
of fullbacking.
Marchie Schwartz has announced
he will stick to the starting lineup
he announced earlier this week, un
less Stanford kicks off. In that case
Wakefield will be in to do the kick
ing, and Marchie may also start "a
taller quarterback" than Frankie
Forbes as added insurance on pass
defense. (Note: Buck Brownson is
taller than Frankie Forbes.)
Aubrey Devine, the little south
paw qb, is slated to see a lot of ac
tion, both on offense and defense.
He is held in high esteem for his de
fensive work, and is also quite a
passer.
The Stanford gridders want to
win this first one badly, and are
pointing for it. When two strange
teams without advance informa
tion 011 each other clash, a few
mistakes or a little slow thinking
on cither side can decide the Issue.
The Cards are driving hard, and
they don't intend to be defeated
by their own mistakes.
Yesterday's practice was another
tough one. Schwartz again had the
boys running through passing and
signal drill. It came to a close with
some spirited charging, after dark.
The boys, though tired, were still
enthusiastic and ready for more.
In dummy practice the first string
line was hitting hard enough to
blast a hole through the stadium
wall, and it's really unfair to single
any one of them out for special
plaudits; they all looked rough and
ready.
Vandal Coach Babe Brown is ex
pected to stick fairly close io his
announced starting lineup. It con
sists of Aldred and Buoy at ends,
Viro and Zenkevitch at tackles, Pot
ter and Captain Merril Barnes at
guards, Paasch at center, Christen
sen and the sensational Jim Hatch
at halves, Carl Munson at qb. and
high-scoring Bill Miklich at fb.
The Stanford lineup (barring un
foreseen last-minute developments)
consists of Dave DeSwarte and Bob
Hall at ends (Jack Eller may pos
sibly be in at the kickofT in place of
Hall). Boensch and Jim Cox at tac
kles, Bill Hachten and Harvey
Bernhard at the guards, Pete Au
gust at center, Don Zappetini and
Freddy Parsons at halves, Frankie
Forbes at qb, and Lloyd Merriman
at fb.
Game time is 2:30 p.m., but gates

Vandals at the Stadium before a guesstimated 20,000.
Coach Marchie Schwartz last night named veteran left tackle

•Freddie Bocnsch as game captain, a
move greeted by wild huzzahs and
much handclapping. Idaho guard
Merrill Barnes will be Boensch's
opposite number.
Ainslec Bell, Stanford's ailing
will not start, but will see action
according to Schwartz. Special
braces for bis injured left knee
have not yet arrived, but he will
be able to play without them. Bell
will not strt, but will see action
some time during (he afternoon.
Yesterday afternoon ("tie varsity
gridders went through their final
heavy workout before meeting Ida

he announced earlier this week, un
less Stanford kicks off. In that case
Wakefield will be in to do the kick
ing, and Marchie may also start "a
taller quarterback" than Frankie
Forbes as added insurance on pass
defense. (Note: Buck Brownson is
taller than Frankie Forbes.)
Aubrey Devine, the little south
paw qb, is slated to see a lot of ac
tion, both on offense and defense.
He is held in high esteem for his de
fensive work, and is also quite a
passer.
The Stanford gridders want to
win this first one badly, and are
pointing for it. When two strange
teams without advance informa
tion 011 each other clash, a few
mistakes or a little slow thinking
on cither side can decide the Issue.
The Cards are driving hard, and
they don't intend to be defeated
by their own mistakes.
Yesterday's practice was another
tough one. Schwartz again had the
boys running through passing and
signal drill. It came to a close with
some spirited charging, after dark.
The boys, though tired, were still
enthusiastic and ready for more.
In dummy practice the first string
line was hitting hard enough to
blast a hole through the stadium
wall, and it's really unfair to single
any one of them out for special
plaudits; they all looked rough and
ready.
Vandal Coach Babe Brown is ex
pected to stick fairly close io his
announced starting lineup. It con
sists of Aldred and Buoy at ends,
Viro and Zenkevitch at tackles, Pot
ter and Captain Merril Barnes at
guards, Paasch at center, Christen
sen and the sensational Jim Hatch
at halves, Carl Munson at qb. and
high-scoring Bill Miklich at fb.
The Stanford lineup (barring un
foreseen last-minute developments)
consists of Dave DeSwarte and Bob
Hall at ends (Jack Eller may pos
sibly be in at the kickofT in place of
Hall). Boensch and Jim Cox at tac
kles, Bill Hachten and Harvey
Bernhard at the guards, Pete Au
gust at center, Don Zappetini and
Freddy Parsons at halves, Frankie
Forbes at qb, and Lloyd Merriman
at fb.
Game time is 2:30 p.m., but gates
and ticket offices will open at 11
out of deference to the jayvees, who
play a tough Santa Rosa J.C. outfit.

Lloyd lias been looking great in
practice, and if Miklich regains
his prewar form (he led the Con
ference in scoring in 1!)41), the
fans are due for a fine exhibition
of fullbacking.

Stanford's Indians take off on the long road (to Pasadena?)
tomorrow afternoon, riding the tide of somebody's optimism as
2-1 favorites with a two-toucrhdown handicap, against the Idaho
Vandals at the Stadium before a guesstimated 20,000.
Coach Marchie Schwartz last night named veteran left tackle

•Freddie Bocnsch as game captain, a
move greeted by wild huzzahs and
much handclapping. Idaho guard
Merrill Barnes will be Boensch's
opposite number.
Ainslec Bell, Stanford's ailing
will not start, but will see action
according to Schwartz. Special
braces for bis injured left knee
have not yet arrived, but he will
be able to play without them. Bell
will not strt, but will see action
some time during (he afternoon.
Yesterday afternoon ("tie varsity
gridders went through their final
heavy workout before meeting Ida
ho. Today I bey will merely don
game uniforms and take a light drill
! on the stadium turf.
The Vandals will arrive in Oak
land (his morning, and arc expected
at Palo Alto soon after, where they
will put up at the President Hotel.
At some time during the day they
plan to journey to the stadium,
where they will also take a light
workout.
This Idaho team is otic of the
many that uses the T-formation
(popularized among the colleges by
Stanford), but there is an infinite
number of variations possible. Only
Coach Babe Brown and his men
know what they have up their col
lective sleeve, and they obviously
arc not telling.
The 33 Vandal gridders are re
ported to be in good physical condi
tion, and they are all rather large
young gentlemen. Their eight tac
kles (only four of which could make
the trip, unfortunately) average
more than 225 pounds per man. The
smallest of the bunch, ex-Marine
Dick Nelson, is a mere runt of 198
pounds. Whether or not they have
speed to go with the beef will be re
vealed tomorrow.
Two promising fullbacks are
slated to lock horns—Lloyd Mcr
; rirnan and Vandal Bill Miklich.
Lloyd lias been looking great in
practice, and if Miklich regains
his prewar form (he led the Con
ference in scoring in 1!)41), the
fans are due for a fine exhibition
