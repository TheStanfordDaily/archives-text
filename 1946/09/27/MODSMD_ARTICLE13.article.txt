# CARDS OPEN 2-1 CHOICE OVER IDAHO
## Boensch Named Captain For Saturday Contest 33-Man Vandal Vandal Arrives Today; Light Workouts Slated for Stadium 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
Stanford's Indians take off on the long road (to Pasadena?)
tomorrow afternoon, riding the tide of somebody's optimism as
2-1 favorites with a two-toucrhdown handicap, against the Idaho
Vandals at the Stadium before a guesstimated 20,000.
Coach Marchie Schwartz last night named veteran left tackle

•Freddie Bocnsch as game captain, a
move greeted by wild huzzahs and
much handclapping. Idaho guard
Merrill Barnes will be Boensch's
opposite number.
Ainslec Bell, Stanford's ailing
will not start, but will see action
according to Schwartz. Special
braces for bis injured left knee
have not yet arrived, but he will
be able to play without them. Bell
will not strt, but will see action
some time during (he afternoon.
Yesterday afternoon ("tie varsity
gridders went through their final
heavy workout before meeting Ida
ho. Today I bey will merely don
game uniforms and take a light drill
! on the stadium turf.
The Vandals will arrive in Oak
land (his morning, and arc expected
at Palo Alto soon after, where they
will put up at the President Hotel.
At some time during the day they
plan to journey to the stadium,
where they will also take a light
workout.
This Idaho team is otic of the
many that uses the T-formation
(popularized among the colleges by
Stanford), but there is an infinite
number of variations possible. Only
Coach Babe Brown and his men
know what they have up their col
lective sleeve, and they obviously
arc not telling.
The 33 Vandal gridders are re
ported to be in good physical condi
tion, and they are all rather large
young gentlemen. Their eight tac
kles (only four of which could make
the trip, unfortunately) average
more than 225 pounds per man. The
smallest of the bunch, ex-Marine
Dick Nelson, is a mere runt of 198
pounds. Whether or not they have
speed to go with the beef will be re
vealed tomorrow.
Two promising fullbacks are
slated to lock horns—Lloyd Mcr
; rirnan and Vandal Bill Miklich.
