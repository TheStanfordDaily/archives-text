## All-Campus Movie-Time 
### 
A suggestion was made at Excom Wednes
day night that Sunday night movies be shown
one week at Memorial Hall and the next week
at the Village theater.
Such a plan would help a great deal in in
tegrating the Village into normal Stanford life
and in making on-campus students feel at
home in the Village. Unless some plans are
rnado to co-ordinate the Village with the regu
lar Stanford campus, on-campus students will
feel that the Village is some remote place
where they are not welcome; and Villagers
will regard the campus as the "place where
they work" in which they have no part in the
social program.
Sunday night movies have been consid
ered a place to take a date where you don't
have to worry about transportation The diffi
culty of transportation to the Village could be
alleviated by having the special shuttle busses

—packed with students singing all the way to
and horn the show.
The movie would have to start early
enough so that women would be able to return
to their living groups by 10:30 p.m.
The theater building is now in the custody
of Stanford but Menlo Park is trying to get
custody of all the recreational facilities at the
Village from the government. Chairs would
have to be provided for the theater as the
army confiscated them before turning it over
to the University. There is also a possibility
of using a smaller Village theater which is
now being used for a study hall.
Herbert J. Wunderlich, Village resident
counsellor, said that Villagers are anxious to
hold the Sunday movie every other week.
Since this plan is such a desirable one, we
feel that the problems presented by it should
be investigated immediately for solutions.
