# The
						Village Comes to Excom
## 
### 
Whether Village residents get the break
on becoming a practically integrated part of
the University's social and political life as
soon as possible depends on the special
A.S.S.U. election to be held in two weeks.
Excom V/ednesday night discussed the
content of the special election ballot, and it
wars the recommendation of A.S.S.U. President
Martin Anderson that a constitutional change
be included, creating voting areas in the Vil
lage and the number of Excom representatives
to be elected from each. If this is approved,
Village representatives could be in office by
the sixth week of this quarter.
Until these representatives are in their
rightful seats, the Village sponsors, appointed
to serve on Excom by Village Counselor Wun
derlich, must be given every privilege as ex
officio members.
But another problem arises in the setting
up of areas. The possibility of expanding the

number of persons to be represented per
Excom seat will be examined; and we suggest
that committee members veto any such sug
gestion, for the following reasons:
1) Village would be the only area put at
a disadvantage by this move, since all other
designated areas have a ratio of one represen
tative to approximately 450 persons (Lagunita,
about 300; Men's Row, about 480, Branner-
Roble, 350, etc.).
2) President Anderson's plan for initiating
sub-epmmittee work to investigate problems
coming before Excom would cancel the argu
ment against electing an Excom "too cumber
some to accomplish anything."
Though the problems in all areas of the
Village, however designated, will be some
what similar, the election should not be run
off on this basis. Voting power on Excom
must be determined according to how many
students are represented by each member's
vote.
