(We run the following Campus Opinion as one
of several that have reached us on the same topic,
a summary of the why's and wherefores of the
Athletic Council's action will he published in Mon
day's paper, at which time we can all decide about
its seeming injustice.—The Editor)
$10.05 AND A SEAT IN THE T ZONE
To the Editor:
I m writing this in behalf of all student veterans'
wives and student veterans' wives' husbands. (I'm
one of the latter.)
First, let me thank the B.A.C. for the special "cut
late" price of $10.15 for veterans' wives' season tick
ets to our football games. Very generous indeed,
when one considers the price is an outrageous $10.80
to "outsiders."
But I'm not that pleased with certain other
things—the veterans' wives' section at the games,
for instance. Our wives should he able to sit in

the rooting section, or at least adjoining the root
ing section, instead of being stuck way off by
themselves. Whoever thought this up must think
we want an excuse to get away from our wives,
but most of us are sick and tired of heing sepa
rated from them.
The payoff will be the Big Game. I take my wife
up to Berkeley and then either leave her outside the
stadium, or send her off to some reserved seat in the
end zone, while I go take my place in the rooting
section. I hate to miss a Big Game, but under those
conditions I don't want to go. Every vet with a wife
Ive talked to feels the same way. Can anything be
done?

P.S. Some ex-service women enrolled here must
have husbands who aren't students. How about a
Student Veterans' Husbands Section and a special
"cut-rat?" price for them—say $10.05?
