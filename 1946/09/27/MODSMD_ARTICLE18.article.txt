## BULL SESSION 
### 
This business of having"JT'oVloek classes start at
Ihe most astonishing hour of exactly 8 o'clock lias
thrown the entire campus into a turmoil.
Characters such as myself who for years at Stan
ford had planned their morning arrivals with such
split-second timing that they screeched into their
.seats just as the prof took off his glasses to look at
the class to see who had slept in have found them
selves completely thrown out of gear.
Some profs have thrown in the towel and are
starting at the traditional "ten after," others are
splitting the difference with a "five after" beginning,
while the majority who attempt to start dispensing
Ihe wisdom exactly on the hour are fighting to over
come the tendency to twitch as the door creaks open
every 10 seconds and the patter of little feet marks
the arrival of another habit-ridden victim.
Believe me, something has got to be done. One
of these mornings when I'm racing up the Quad
putting my pants on, I'm going to trip and smash
something, and I'll sue.
# * * «
All things come to him who waits. And I didn't
have long to wait before little bells began ringing
yesterday as people phoned to inform me that the
credit for the efficient handling of the vets on reg
day rightly belongs not to the Veterans' Adminis
tration but to our own L.S. Jr. U. Always give
credit where credit is due, my children.
That tremendous job was ably handled by the
Veterans' Co-ordinator of our own Veterans' Rec
ords office. The system was several months in the
planning and the end product certainly justified
it, from the vets' viewpoint at least. A task such as
that deserves just praise and I humbly apologize for
misplacing the compliment.

Gosh, Dean, everybody makes mistakes. Now ;
will you let my mother out of the dungeon? She !
hasn't had a beer in weeks.
* * * $
Girls, those of you who road Stan Shpctner's ad
in yesterday's Daily offering to clean and press your
gym suits for you (there's a trifle of $1.50 involved,
the grafting chiseler) because you look so stinking !
in them, especially unpressed, needn't feel so bad.
I think you're purty, with or without pressed
gym suits. I mean, even if you don't have on a j
pressed gym suit. I m»an, even though . . . oh, well,
never mind. I just like all of you, all 1,908 of you.
Except that nasty little girl in the third row left end
of my !) o'clock. She's a stinker.
But if I had a name like Shpetner, I would take
that out and have it cleaned and pressed.
* * * *
The way the assignments are falling this quarter
it is beginning to appear that the Libe will be so
packed and jammed that you will have to go outside
to turn a page. Reading, reading, reading, and more
reading.
One fellow last night spent three hours reading
his reading assignments and never did gel around I
to cracking a book.
* * * *
Sad thought about which to think sad thoughts
over the weekend: With the approach of winter, all
those beeyootiful skirts and SWEATERS will be en
cased in those raincoats which Stanford women insist
on wearing and in which they always manage to
look like a paper sack of tomatoes that someoii" left
out in the rain overnight.

All things come to him who waits. And I didn't
have long to wait before little bells began ringing
yesterday as people phoned to inform me that the
credit for the efficient handling of the vets on reg
day rightly belongs not to the Veterans' Adminis
tration but to our own L.S. Jr. U. Always give
credit where credit is due, my children.
That tremendous job was ably handled by the
Veterans' Co-ordinator of our own Veterans' Rec
ords office. The system was several months in the
planning and the end product certainly justified
it, from the vets' viewpoint at least. A task such as
that deserves just praise and I humbly apologize for
misplacing the compliment.

Gosh, Dean, everybody makes mistakes. Now ;
will you let my mother out of the dungeon? She !
hasn't had a beer in weeks.

Girls, those of you who road Stan Shpctner's ad
in yesterday's Daily offering to clean and press your
gym suits for you (there's a trifle of $1.50 involved,
the grafting chiseler) because you look so stinking !
in them, especially unpressed, needn't feel so bad.
I think you're purty, with or without pressed
gym suits. I mean, even if you don't have on a j
pressed gym suit. I m»an, even though . . . oh, well,
never mind. I just like all of you, all 1,908 of you.
Except that nasty little girl in the third row left end
of my !) o'clock. She's a stinker.
But if I had a name like Shpetner, I would take
that out and have it cleaned and pressed.

The way the assignments are falling this quarter
it is beginning to appear that the Libe will be so
packed and jammed that you will have to go outside
to turn a page. Reading, reading, reading, and more
reading.
One fellow last night spent three hours reading
his reading assignments and never did gel around I
to cracking a book.

Sad thought about which to think sad thoughts
over the weekend: With the approach of winter, all
those beeyootiful skirts and SWEATERS will be en

This business of having"JT'oVloek classes start at
Ihe most astonishing hour of exactly 8 o'clock lias
thrown the entire campus into a turmoil.
Characters such as myself who for years at Stan
ford had planned their morning arrivals with such
split-second timing that they screeched into their
.seats just as the prof took off his glasses to look at
the class to see who had slept in have found them
selves completely thrown out of gear.
Some profs have thrown in the towel and are
starting at the traditional "ten after," others are
splitting the difference with a "five after" beginning,
while the majority who attempt to start dispensing
Ihe wisdom exactly on the hour are fighting to over
come the tendency to twitch as the door creaks open
every 10 seconds and the patter of little feet marks
the arrival of another habit-ridden victim.
