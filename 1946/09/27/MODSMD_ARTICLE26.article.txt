## 
### 
Out to mash some potatoes of their own, Stanford's ambitious Junior
Varsity footballers sprint into Stanford Stadium tomorrow morning to lace
a highly regarded Santa Rosa Junior College eleven. Coach Ed Stamm's
squad is the first junior varsity outfit to represent Stanford in a regularly
.scheduled football game since 1932, when the jayvees, then known as the
Greys and coached by Ernie Nevers *

and Murray Cuddeback, defeated j
the Cal reserves 13-6.
Coach Stamm and his assistants j
Lin Wolfe and Bob Crane are nat- ;
urally not too optimistic over the i
team's chances, as only half of the 1
squad has been suited up for the j
full three-week practice grind and !
many of the boys have been out I
for less than a week. Coach Stamm
explains, "They know their plays,
and they know what to do. Now
111 only question is if they will know
how to do it, considering their lack
of experience with the T-formation, |
and their lack of sufficient time to
get in shape."
On top of their other troubles,
the jayvees are plagued with a
couple of first-string injuries. Right
guard Bill Edlund and right end !
Walker Smith are nursing leg in- j
juries.
Reports from the Santa Rosa cam- I
pus paint a very rosy picture. The
northerners are bigger, older, and
more experienced than the locals,
and 150-pound triple-threat quar
terback Roy James is hailed as a
mighty smart potato with the tricky- j
