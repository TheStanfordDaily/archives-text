# Radioactivity Possible Here

### 
There is a definite possibility of
radioactivity in the Stanford vi
cinity as a result of the Bikini tests,
according to Dr. Paul Kirkpatrick,
professor of physics.
"A measurable amount of radio
activity may have spread for sev
eral thousands of miles," Dr.
Kirkpatrick said, "but not in suffi
cient quantity to injure anyone."
His report followed a denial by
the 12th Naval District that 75 atom
bomb test ships berthed on the West
Coast and at Pearl Harbor were
quarantined until they are "radio
logically safe."
Among the scientists assigned
to the Bikini tests were tlircc
prominent Stanford professors.
Dr. Norris E. Bradbury, professor
of physics, was director of the Los
Alamos Manhattan project which
was responsible for the instru
mentation of the entire project,
building the actual atom bombs.
Professor Hugh Skilling of the
Electrical Engineering Department
acted as an observer. Dr. Robert
Newell, professor of medicine,
studied the effects of radiology,
was responsible for the health of
the observers and took measure
ments of the radioactivity.
