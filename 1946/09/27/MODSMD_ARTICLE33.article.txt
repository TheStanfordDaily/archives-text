# Bums Trim Card Lead to Half Game
## 
### 
NEW YORK. Sept. 26 (UP). —
Fast-talking, faster-pitching Kirby
Higbe, the Flatbush Dizzy Dean,
gave Brooklyn pennant hopes a re
birth today when he strong-aimed
his way to an 8-2 victory over the
Philadelphia Phillies that left the
Dodgers a half game out of first
place.
The victory, before a full house of
31,708. gave the Dodgers a chance to
tie the idle CardinalsJ:'or the lead if
St. Louis loses to the Chicago Cubs
tomorrow. The Dodgers, who have
single games left to play on Satur
day and Sunday, were confident
they would win both.
Working behind a super-charged
| batting order which pounded out 13
J hits including a 375-foot two-run
' homer by Joe Medwick, Higbe had
i things entirely his own way.
He struck out seven, didn't walk
! a man and from the second until the
j seventh didn't permit a man to get
j on base. He strutted around on the
1 mound, shook off the signs of rookie

| catcher Bruce Edwards, bowed po
litely to the fans. In short, he was
: terrific.
The victory was a costly one, for
the Dodgers lost the services of
their battling left fielder, Pete Rei
ser, who was carried ott' the field
with a fractured left ankle in the
first inning.
Reiser, the "unluckiest guy in
baseball" was back for the second
day after a two weeks layoff because
of a charley horse. He suffered the
injury after he had forced Eddie
Stanky, who had walked, and was
sliding back to first base as pitcher
Charley Schanz tried to pick him
off.
The Dodgers, spurred to "win this
one for Petey," put across a quick
tally when Dick (Whitman, running
l for Reiser, went to second on a
passed ball and scored on Dixie
Walker's single.
They knocked Schanz out of the
; box with a four-run bunting spree
i in the fourth. Eddie Stevens started

things wilh ;i lusty double against
the right field fence for the only
solid hit of the inning. Carl Urillo's
attempted sacrifice went for a hit
when Schanz f..iled to hang on to
the bunt, and Peewee Reese drib
bled a slow roller to short that sent
Stevens home. Bruce Edwards beat
j out a bunt to Schanz to fill the
bases and Eddie Stanky rolled a
single pack Schanz to score Piillo.
In other games today, Boston split
with the Giants, while the Cubs de
feated Pittsburgh. Mort Cooper
j pitched a three-hit 8 to 0 Boston
win in the first, but Sid Gordon's
ninth-inning homer gave New York
; the second game, 5 to 4. Bill Nichol
son doubled home the decisive runs
as Chicago won over the Pirates, 5
! to 3.
In the American League Hank
Greenberg hit two homers to make
his total 44 as the Tigers topped St.
Louis 6 to 3. Mickey Haefner of the
! Washington Senators shut out the
Athletics, 2 to 0, on six hits.

Athletics, 2 to 0, on six hits.
NEW YORK. Sept. 26 (UP). —
Fast-talking, faster-pitching Kirby
Higbe, the Flatbush Dizzy Dean,
gave Brooklyn pennant hopes a re
birth today when he strong-aimed
his way to an 8-2 victory over the
Philadelphia Phillies that left the
Dodgers a half game out of first
place.
The victory, before a full house of
31,708. gave the Dodgers a chance to
tie the idle CardinalsJ:'or the lead if
St. Louis loses to the Chicago Cubs
tomorrow. The Dodgers, who have
single games left to play on Satur
day and Sunday, were confident
they would win both.
Working behind a super-charged
| batting order which pounded out 13
J hits including a 375-foot two-run
' homer by Joe Medwick, Higbe had
i things entirely his own way.
He struck out seven, didn't walk
! a man and from the second until the
j seventh didn't permit a man to get
j on base. He strutted around on the
1 mound, shook off the signs of rookie

| catcher Bruce Edwards, bowed po
litely to the fans. In short, he was
: terrific.
The victory was a costly one, for
the Dodgers lost the services of
their battling left fielder, Pete Rei
ser, who was carried ott' the field
with a fractured left ankle in the
first inning.
Reiser, the "unluckiest guy in
baseball" was back for the second
day after a two weeks layoff because
of a charley horse. He suffered the
injury after he had forced Eddie
Stanky, who had walked, and was
sliding back to first base as pitcher
Charley Schanz tried to pick him
off.
The Dodgers, spurred to "win this
one for Petey," put across a quick
tally when Dick (Whitman, running
l for Reiser, went to second on a
passed ball and scored on Dixie
Walker's single.
They knocked Schanz out of the
; box with a four-run bunting spree
i in the fourth. Eddie Stevens started

things wilh ;i lusty double against
the right field fence for the only
solid hit of the inning. Carl Urillo's
attempted sacrifice went for a hit
when Schanz f..iled to hang on to
the bunt, and Peewee Reese drib
bled a slow roller to short that sent
Stevens home. Bruce Edwards beat
j out a bunt to Schanz to fill the
bases and Eddie Stanky rolled a
single pack Schanz to score Piillo.
In other games today, Boston split
with the Giants, while the Cubs de
feated Pittsburgh. Mort Cooper
j pitched a three-hit 8 to 0 Boston
win in the first, but Sid Gordon's
ninth-inning homer gave New York
; the second game, 5 to 4. Bill Nichol
son doubled home the decisive runs
as Chicago won over the Pirates, 5
! to 3.
In the American League Hank
Greenberg hit two homers to make
his total 44 as the Tigers topped St.
Louis 6 to 3. Mickey Haefner of the
