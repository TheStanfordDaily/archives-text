## Woman Director Starts New Work 
### 
After a half-century of uninter
rupted male rule, Encina Hall now
bows to the petticoat reign of its
new resident director, Mrs. Ellene
J. Sumner.
The big brownstone barn, long
time home of Stanford's first-year
men, now bulges with over <>00
frosh. To the task of administering
and supervising the domestic activi
ties of such a horde, Mrs. Sumner
brings with her several years' ex
perience in the business field and in
personnel work at Grinnell College,
lowa. She is a graduate of Simmons
College, Boston.
SCHOLARLY APPEARANCE (?)
That frosh shenanigans of the past
—Austin cars speeding on the third
floor, railings and bannisters disap
pearing into Big Game bonfires—
will not be repeated, Mrs. Sumner
makes no promises.
The responsibility of maintaining
a scholarly appearance about the :
place falls with the sponsors, coun- i
selors, and wing officers. Mrs. Sum- j
ner's job is to co-operate with these '
student officers in running the hall.
When mixed parties are given she
will serve as patroness. In addition,
her office will handle the records j
necessary in the operation of the
housekeeping services.
RATIO <502 TO 1
Realizing that men are still in the
majority at Encina ((502 to 1), Mrs.
Sumner still feels herself no usurp- |
er of the long male tradition at the |
Hall. Instead, she considers her
mission of looking after the details
of operating the dormitory as espe
cially suited for a woman.
A suite of rooms in the east wing
of the hall is now being prepared j
for the new director.
