# Injun Rules Red Machine
## 
### 
Little Injun and his lii# Red
Machinc ride again! Artist Ed
McLcllan has junked the Indian's
pre-war models for the newest
machine, which even McLcllan
describes as an "unexplainahle
contraption."
The little feathered warrior first
met the Farm public in 1939 rid
ing a steamroller—the steamroll
er supposedly signifying the pow
er team of Tiny Thornhill's last
year.
But the outdated steamroller
was scrapped for a fast racing car
in '40, when Clark Shaughnessy's
"Wow Boys" and a speedy "T"
formation whizzed to a Rose Bowl
championship. When Marchie
Schwartz took over in 1942, our
feathered friend took his final
pre-war stand in a jeep.
And today, Little Injun warms
up at the starting line in his su
per-deluxe post-war model, a
composite of everything left over
from a reconverted factory. It has
no name, no description; it typi
fies the question mark that is the
194fi team.
The Red Machine's designer is a
cartoonist extraordinary, who has
divided his time between the pa
per and ink stacks of the Univer
sity Press, where he serves as
photolith designer, and the grimy
headquarters of the Chaparral,
lie has finally "come home" to
the Daily where he and his fightin'
Injun will make weekly appear
ances foretelling and extolling the
blows and woes of Stanford foot
ball.
The 194G Big Red Machine is
ready—the takeoff is tomorrow!
