Proposed changes in the contract between Stanford and the
Palo Alto Clinic to supply student health service will be up foi
discussion on October 9 at a meeting of representatives of the
clinic, the University, and the Santa Clara Medical Society.
Dr. Russel V. Lee will represent Stanford in the discussion

scheduled because of the conflict
arising among the three groups over j
professional relationships.
NEGOTIATED IN APRIL
The contract with the clinic was j
first negotiated last April 1 to pro- !
vide medical and surgical care to ;
I students for a prepaid fee of $10 a :
I quarter.
Although the agreement had been ;
| presented to the Santa Clara County
| Medical Society before the April i
j date, no action was taken until non
j clinic doctors in Palo Alto protested
! the contract.
THREE-WAY MEET
The California Medical Associa- i
j tion issued a statement Tuesday
j through the county organization
j asking for a three-way meeting to
I make changes in the contract to pro-
I vide "even broader coverage."
The CMA has urged that any and [
all adjustments made in the con- j
j tract between the school and clinic
: in no way lessen any medical bene
j fits now being enjoyed by Stanford
j students.
FARM SATISFIED
Dr. Alvin C. Enrich. University
vice-president, has expressed the j
University's satisfaction With the j
service rendered by the clinic, point- j
ing to the unlimited medical and j
surgical care made available.
"I know of no other institution j
that provides the service we do," j
Dr. Eurich said. "No other college
or university, ar far as I know, pro- ;
vides 100 days of hospitalization."
lIOUCK EXPLAINS
Dr. George H. Houck who heads [
the Health Service, points out that
the clinic not only places all of the
doctors on its staff at the students'
disposal, but also staffs the dispen-,
j sary on the campus. This health

i the women's gymnasium where day
and night service is maintained
seven days a week.
