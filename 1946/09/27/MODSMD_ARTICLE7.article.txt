# Scribe Says Injuns Expect Victory As Enthusiasm Rises for Idaho Tilt
## 
### 
With gametime approaching for
Stafford's first conference tilt in
four years, campus enthusiasm for
the game is rising to a high pitch.
Loyalty to Coach Schwartz's grid
ders is undivided, although the an
swers are mixed on score predic
tions.
After tramping around the cam
pus yesterday afternoon questioning
various and sundry on the Idaho
fray, I submit the replies I received.
One girl in a red dress thought

Stanford would
win by 20 points.
Pressed for a
reason why, she
merely replied
that she was a
freshman, and it
would make her
feel good to write
momma and tell
her about the big
victory.
Another girl
thought that the
game would he
closer. Maybe a
field goal would

decide 1 lie; game. This gal. who
said she lived at li ran tier, based
her prognostication on the fact
that Idaho has been getting some
real good writeups in the San
Francisco papers.
An economics instructor reported
to me that Idaho would lose by
seven points. "But watch out." he
said. "There's a big bunch of kids
up north, and they're liable to push
the Indians around a little." was the
answer we got.

A Daily reporter, who says she's |
afraid that she'll be sent back to 1
I her home at San Mateo to live, j
| thinks the Cards ought to win by !
i one touchdown. I left her when she
I started telling me more about her
! living problems.
Some fellow, who lives at the |
Village, thinks Stanford is a "shoo j
I in" by at least points. "Remem- !
bcr '42? The game was a toss-up,
and Stanford won easily. That's i
going to happen again."
Another man was a little more j
| conservative and told me that Stan
! ford would be lucky to win by any ;
amount. The reason for his pessi-
J mism was the fact that he watched j
Idaho play last year, and thought J
they had a mighty fine team and j
wouldn't be any push-over.
An olrlorlv ladv was all excited

about the game, find said to mc that
the Indians would run over Van
dals. "No doubt about it," she told
us. "Marchie Schwartz is the best
coach on the Coast, and he wouldn't

let a bunch of
Idahoans fool
him," was the
statement told to
us.
The last girl we
questioned didn't
care to predict a
score on the con
test. She said she
was a freshman,
and she had been
so busy getting

herself organized that she hadn't
any time to think about the game.
Was she going to go? Yes—if she
had the time.—Ait Levinson
