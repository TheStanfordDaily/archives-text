### 
CHICAGO, Sept. 29 (UP). â€”Three hundred liberals, including two for
mer cabinet members, today announced plans to set up a nationwide or
ganization of 500,000 precinct workers to unify (he progressive movement
for the November congressional and 1948 presidential elections.
The group, completing a two-day conference, said the time was not

now opportune for formation of a
third party and planned to work
within the frameworks of the
Democratic and Republican par
tics. Spokesmen for the group
said they would "cross party
lines" in supporting liberal candi
dates, but agreed they would find
more candidates to support in the
Democratic party than in the
CiOP.
The delegates, from 35 slates, an
nounced lull endorsement of former
Secretary of Commerce Henry A.
Wallace and urged him to make a
countrywide speaking tour to
further the policy of international
co-operation.
The conference adopted foreign
and domestic platforms; called on
all liberals to rally to the support
of the waning New Deal policies of
the late President Roosevelt; de
nounced imperialism by any coun
try and called for the removal of
U. S. troops from China; and organ
ized a "committee of 50'' to study
the possibilities of "political realign
ment and to plan a second "confer
ence of progressives" to meet at
Washington in mid-January.
The conference was sponsored
by the National Citizens Political
Action Committee, the CIO Po
litical Action Committee, and the
Independent Citizens Committee
of the Arts, Sciences and Profes
sions. The conference program
was drawn up by a committee
headed by former Secretary of
the Interior Harold L. Ickes, who
yesterday joined with former
Secretary of the Treasury Henry
Morgenthau in urging a Big Three
conference as a means of check
ing war talk.
President Philip Murray of the
CIO presided today at a press con
ference at which the group's plans
and activities were announced. Also
attending were Ickes and Jack
Kroll, chairman of the CIO-PAC;
C. B. Baldwin, head of the National
Citizens PAC; and James Patton,
president of the National Farmer's
Union.
They announced that the confer
ence believes that an outpouring of
50,000.000 voters next November
would assure the election of most
liberal candidates.
