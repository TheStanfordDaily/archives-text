# ONE DOWN, EIGHT TO GO
## Schwartz Uses First Team Sparingly In Crushing 45-0 Win Over Vandals 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
One down and eight to go. The first milestone has been passed, the first milestone on that
long, long trail, the end of which is shrouded in a creeping mist. But Stanford's unexpectedly easy
45 to 0 victory over the Idaho Vandals last Saturday is of little value to one who is anxious about
the future.
The game started prosaically enough, giving little indication of what was to come. Captain

Fred Boensch lost the toss, and the
Idahos elected to receive. George
"Polar Bear" Quist kickcd ofl" to the
over-touted Jim Hatch almost to the
goal line, then got all the way
downfield to make the tackle him
self on the 29-yard line.
But the Vandals, hindered by an
offside penalty, were unable to gain;
on fourth down Hatch was forced
to kick out of bounds on the Stan
ford 26. The Cardinals, in their
turn, were unable to make a fir:,l,
down, and Lloyd Merriman kicked
out of bounds on the Vandal l r > h.
booming 45-yard spiral.
FUMBLES COSTLY
Then it happened. On the very
next play Bill Miklich. who h»d ;i
very poor day, fumbled, and Billy
flachten fell on (He hall on th«*
Idaho 15-yard line. Two plays into
the line gained the Indians seven
yards.
With three yards to go for a first
down the Idahos expected another
line play, but Buck Brownson
crossed them up. Lloyd Merriman
took a shovel pass around right end
for another seven yards and a TD.
Bill Miklich stopped him a yard in
side the end zone—too late.
George Quist kicked the extra
point; Stanford led, 7 to 0, after
less than six minutes of play.
The Vandals roared hack willi
blood in their collective eyes.
Jack Christensen carried Quist's
kickofT to his own 26. and after three
tries into the line they had racked
up the initial first down of the after
noon. But Carl Munson, attempting
to pass, was thrown for an eight™
yard loss—and that was the end oL
Idaho.
PASSES MISFIRE
i To be sure, they didn't quit
! without a fight. Quarterback
Munson unlimbcrcd his flipping
arm and cut loose with three,
passes—one sailed 60 yards down
field—but all were incomplete,
and Stanford took over on downs.
Stanford made two first downs.
; Then, with the count fourth and 12,
Buck Browason elected to run the
ball. Lloyd Merriman saved the
day by going around left end for I!)
yards. Three plays later Brownson
passed 18 yards to Dave DeSwarte
j in the end zone. Dave kept on going

j Quist converted, and the score at.
! the end of the first quarter was II
I to 0.
TOUCHDOWN PARADE
Then the touchdown parade
I started. It was 27 to ft at the half,
and 18 more points were picked
I up in an anticlimactic second ball,

TD, Bob Anderson around right
S end for 14 yards and a TD, Brown

j yards and another (that was a
i beautiful play; little Wayne aetu
ally stole the ball out of the hands
of two Vandal defenders).
