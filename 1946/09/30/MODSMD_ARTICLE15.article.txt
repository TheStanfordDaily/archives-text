# ONE DOWN, EIGHT TO GO
## Schwartz Uses First Team Sparingly In Crushing 45-0 Win Over Vandals 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
One down and eight to go. The first milestone has been passed, the first milestone on that
long, long trail, the end of which is shrouded in a creeping mist. But Stanford's unexpectedly easy
45 to 0 victory over the Idaho Vandals last Saturday is of little value to one who is anxious about
the future.
The game started prosaically enough, giving little indication of what was to come. Captain

Fred Boensch lost the toss, and the
Idahos elected to receive. George
"Polar Bear" Quist kickcd ofl" to the
over-touted Jim Hatch almost to the
goal line, then got all the way
downfield to make the tackle him
self on the 29-yard line.
But the Vandals, hindered by an
offside penalty, were unable to gain;
on fourth down Hatch was forced
to kick out of bounds on the Stan
ford 26. The Cardinals, in their
turn, were unable to make a fir:,l,
down, and Lloyd Merriman kicked
out of bounds on the Vandal l r > h.
booming 45-yard spiral.
FUMBLES COSTLY
Then it happened. On the very
next play Bill Miklich. who h»d ;i
very poor day, fumbled, and Billy
flachten fell on (He hall on th«*
Idaho 15-yard line. Two plays into
the line gained the Indians seven
yards.
With three yards to go for a first
down the Idahos expected another
line play, but Buck Brownson
crossed them up. Lloyd Merriman
took a shovel pass around right end
for another seven yards and a TD.
Bill Miklich stopped him a yard in
side the end zone—too late.
George Quist kicked the extra
point; Stanford led, 7 to 0, after
less than six minutes of play.
The Vandals roared hack willi
blood in their collective eyes.
Jack Christensen carried Quist's
kickofT to his own 26. and after three
tries into the line they had racked
up the initial first down of the after
noon. But Carl Munson, attempting
to pass, was thrown for an eight™
yard loss—and that was the end oL
Idaho.
PASSES MISFIRE
i To be sure, they didn't quit
! without a fight. Quarterback
Munson unlimbcrcd his flipping
arm and cut loose with three,
passes—one sailed 60 yards down
field—but all were incomplete,
and Stanford took over on downs.
Stanford made two first downs.
; Then, with the count fourth and 12,
Buck Browason elected to run the
ball. Lloyd Merriman saved the
day by going around left end for I!)
yards. Three plays later Brownson
passed 18 yards to Dave DeSwarte
j in the end zone. Dave kept on going
| and almost ended up in the stands,
j Quist converted, and the score at.
! the end of the first quarter was II
I to 0.
TOUCHDOWN PARADE
Then the touchdown parade
I started. It was 27 to ft at the half,
and 18 more points were picked
I up in an anticlimactic second ball,
; Dcvinc to Titus for 15 yards and a
TD, Bob Anderson around right
S end for 14 yards and a TD, Brown
i son to Wayne Erickson, for 41
j yards and another (that was a
i beautiful play; little Wayne aetu
ally stole the ball out of the hands
of two Vandal defenders).
I Gene Martin got touchdown mini
j bcr six by skirting left end for \'i
! yards. His teammates put on a
| beautiful exhibition of blocking and
faking. Mickey Titus ended the
j slaughter by going over guard for
j two yards and the 45th point.
Alter the track meet was over.
Vandal Coach Babe Brown was
the picture of a bitterly disap
pointed man. A chubby, middle
aged man with thin, graying hair,
he was a study in dejection. Net
alibi by Idaho.
"The heat?" he said. "Yes, I think
! it hurt, us, but I don't want to offer
i that as an alibi. Marchie has a fine
j team. That Merriman is quite a boy.
"My kids weren't afraid, and
had no thought of losing, but they
lost heart after they started fum
bling in the first quarter." He
paused. "Your backs are so much
faster than ours," he said slowly,
| shaking his head. "Of course the
Stanford line out-charged us all
afternoon, but those backs had the
| speed to lake advantage of it."
He turned away, then turned back
| again. "We're not through," he said,
] with a flash of spirit. "Somebody is
j going to hear from us yet."
BOWL TALK PREMATURE
There is no denying it. Profes
| sor of Football Marchie Schwartz's
j young men had a great day. But
any talk of Pasadena and the
Bowl of Roses on New Year's Day
is premature, to say the least.
Idaho proved to be much weaker

than expected. U.S.F. is going to be
a different story—and, in case you
have forgotten, there's a little date
with U.C.L.A. following the Don en
gagement. If you read football
scores, you know what the Bruins
did to Oregon State Saturday.
Only after these next two games
are past can the caliber of the
Stanford Indians as a football ma
chine be evaluated with any de
gree of accuracy. Those two out
fits are going to be TOUGII.
ENTIRE SQUAD PLAY
Marchie Schwartz sent in every
thing but the bench in an effort to
hold down the stfore; there is no
sense in humiliating a group of fine,
fighting men. But it was all to no
avail. Holding down the score is an
impossible job when you have 50 or
more tough, ambitious young men,
out to make a reputation against a
demoralized foe. Everybody played
except the invalids.
Any effort to select an individ
ual star (or stars) from among
the half a hundred who played
would be worse than futile. Ev
erybody looked good—and that
rugged line is no exception.
Sharp-eyed Harry Borba of the
San Francisco Examiner claims
that only one blocking assignment
was missed in the entire first hall*.
How can you pick a star when ev
erybody plays like that?
The outfit that started the game
looked better than any of the other
combinations, but they weren't in
long enough to form any inelastic
opinions about the matter. Keblu
sek turned out to be quite a ball
hawk, and Jim Cox swarmed all
over the field, to the consternation
of the Idahos. George Quist showed
signs of becoming one of the better
linebackers; that's a good place to
stop, because there isn't enough pa
per to mention them all.

BOWL TALK PREMATURE
There is no denying it. Profes
| sor of Football Marchie Schwartz's
j young men had a great day. But
any talk of Pasadena and the
Bowl of Roses on New Year's Day
is premature, to say the least.
Idaho proved to be much weaker

than expected. U.S.F. is going to be
a different story—and, in case you
have forgotten, there's a little date
with U.C.L.A. following the Don en
gagement. If you read football
scores, you know what the Bruins
did to Oregon State Saturday.
Only after these next two games
are past can the caliber of the
Stanford Indians as a football ma
chine be evaluated with any de
gree of accuracy. Those two out
fits are going to be TOUGII.
ENTIRE SQUAD PLAY
Marchie Schwartz sent in every
thing but the bench in an effort to
hold down the stfore; there is no
sense in humiliating a group of fine,
fighting men. But it was all to no
avail. Holding down the score is an
impossible job when you have 50 or
more tough, ambitious young men,
out to make a reputation against a
demoralized foe. Everybody played
except the invalids.
Any effort to select an individ
ual star (or stars) from among
the half a hundred who played
would be worse than futile. Ev
erybody looked good—and that
rugged line is no exception.
Sharp-eyed Harry Borba of the
San Francisco Examiner claims
that only one blocking assignment
was missed in the entire first hall*.
How can you pick a star when ev
erybody plays like that?
The outfit that started the game
looked better than any of the other
combinations, but they weren't in
long enough to form any inelastic
opinions about the matter. Keblu
sek turned out to be quite a ball
hawk, and Jim Cox swarmed all
over the field, to the consternation
of the Idahos. George Quist showed
signs of becoming one of the better
linebackers; that's a good place to
stop, because there isn't enough pa
per to mention them all.
One down and eight to go. The first milestone has been passed, the first milestone on that
long, long trail, the end of which is shrouded in a creeping mist. But Stanford's unexpectedly easy
45 to 0 victory over the Idaho Vandals last Saturday is of little value to one who is anxious about
the future.
The game started prosaically enough, giving little indication of what was to come. Captain

Fred Boensch lost the toss, and the
Idahos elected to receive. George
"Polar Bear" Quist kickcd ofl" to the
over-touted Jim Hatch almost to the
goal line, then got all the way
downfield to make the tackle him
self on the 29-yard line.
But the Vandals, hindered by an
offside penalty, were unable to gain;
on fourth down Hatch was forced
to kick out of bounds on the Stan
ford 26. The Cardinals, in their
turn, were unable to make a fir:,l,
down, and Lloyd Merriman kicked
out of bounds on the Vandal l r > h.
booming 45-yard spiral.
FUMBLES COSTLY
Then it happened. On the very
next play Bill Miklich. who h»d ;i
very poor day, fumbled, and Billy
flachten fell on (He hall on th«*
Idaho 15-yard line. Two plays into
the line gained the Indians seven
yards.
With three yards to go for a first
down the Idahos expected another
line play, but Buck Brownson
crossed them up. Lloyd Merriman
took a shovel pass around right end
for another seven yards and a TD.
Bill Miklich stopped him a yard in
side the end zone—too late.
George Quist kicked the extra
point; Stanford led, 7 to 0, after
less than six minutes of play.
The Vandals roared hack willi
blood in their collective eyes.
Jack Christensen carried Quist's
kickofT to his own 26. and after three
tries into the line they had racked
up the initial first down of the after
noon. But Carl Munson, attempting
to pass, was thrown for an eight™
yard loss—and that was the end oL
Idaho.
PASSES MISFIRE
i To be sure, they didn't quit
! without a fight. Quarterback
Munson unlimbcrcd his flipping
arm and cut loose with three,
passes—one sailed 60 yards down
field—but all were incomplete,
and Stanford took over on downs.
Stanford made two first downs.
; Then, with the count fourth and 12,
Buck Browason elected to run the
ball. Lloyd Merriman saved the
day by going around left end for I!)
yards. Three plays later Brownson
passed 18 yards to Dave DeSwarte

TOUCHDOWN PARADE
Then the touchdown parade
I started. It was 27 to ft at the half,
and 18 more points were picked
I up in an anticlimactic second ball,
; Dcvinc to Titus for 15 yards and a
TD, Bob Anderson around right
S end for 14 yards and a TD, Brown
i son to Wayne Erickson, for 41
j yards and another (that was a
i beautiful play; little Wayne aetu
ally stole the ball out of the hands
of two Vandal defenders).
I Gene Martin got touchdown mini
j bcr six by skirting left end for \'i
! yards. His teammates put on a
| beautiful exhibition of blocking and
faking. Mickey Titus ended the
j slaughter by going over guard for
j two yards and the 45th point.
Alter the track meet was over.
Vandal Coach Babe Brown was
the picture of a bitterly disap
pointed man. A chubby, middle
aged man with thin, graying hair,
he was a study in dejection. Net
alibi by Idaho.
"The heat?" he said. "Yes, I think
! it hurt, us, but I don't want to offer
i that as an alibi. Marchie has a fine
j team. That Merriman is quite a boy.
"My kids weren't afraid, and

blood in their collective eyes.
Jack Christensen carried Quist's
kickofT to his own 26. and after three
tries into the line they had racked
up the initial first down of the after
noon. But Carl Munson, attempting
to pass, was thrown for an eight™
yard loss—and that was the end oL
Idaho.
PASSES MISFIRE
i To be sure, they didn't quit
! without a fight. Quarterback
Munson unlimbcrcd his flipping
arm and cut loose with three,
passes—one sailed 60 yards down
field—but all were incomplete,
and Stanford took over on downs.
Stanford made two first downs.
; Then, with the count fourth and 12,
Buck Browason elected to run the
ball. Lloyd Merriman saved the
day by going around left end for I!)
yards. Three plays later Brownson
passed 18 yards to Dave DeSwarte
j in the end zone. Dave kept on going
| and almost ended up in the stands,
j Quist converted, and the score at.
! the end of the first quarter was II
I to 0.
TOUCHDOWN PARADE
Then the touchdown parade
I started. It was 27 to ft at the half,
and 18 more points were picked
I up in an anticlimactic second ball,
; Dcvinc to Titus for 15 yards and a
TD, Bob Anderson around right
S end for 14 yards and a TD, Brown
i son to Wayne Erickson, for 41
j yards and another (that was a
i beautiful play; little Wayne aetu
ally stole the ball out of the hands
of two Vandal defenders).
I Gene Martin got touchdown mini
j bcr six by skirting left end for \'i
! yards. His teammates put on a
| beautiful exhibition of blocking and
faking. Mickey Titus ended the
j slaughter by going over guard for
j two yards and the 45th point.
Alter the track meet was over.
Vandal Coach Babe Brown was
the picture of a bitterly disap
pointed man. A chubby, middle
aged man with thin, graying hair,
he was a study in dejection. Net
alibi by Idaho.
"The heat?" he said. "Yes, I think
! it hurt, us, but I don't want to offer
i that as an alibi. Marchie has a fine
j team. That Merriman is quite a boy.
"My kids weren't afraid, and
had no thought of losing, but they
lost heart after they started fum
bling in the first quarter." He
paused. "Your backs are so much
faster than ours," he said slowly,
| shaking his head. "Of course the
Stanford line out-charged us all
afternoon, but those backs had the

He turned away, then turned back

BOWL TALK PREMATURE
There is no denying it. Profes
| sor of Football Marchie Schwartz's
j young men had a great day. But
any talk of Pasadena and the
Bowl of Roses on New Year's Day
is premature, to say the least.
Idaho proved to be much weaker

than expected. U.S.F. is going to be
a different story—and, in case you
have forgotten, there's a little date
with U.C.L.A. following the Don en
gagement. If you read football
scores, you know what the Bruins
did to Oregon State Saturday.
Only after these next two games
are past can the caliber of the
Stanford Indians as a football ma
chine be evaluated with any de
gree of accuracy. Those two out
fits are going to be TOUGII.
ENTIRE SQUAD PLAY
Marchie Schwartz sent in every
thing but the bench in an effort to
hold down the stfore; there is no
sense in humiliating a group of fine,
fighting men. But it was all to no
avail. Holding down the score is an
impossible job when you have 50 or
more tough, ambitious young men,
out to make a reputation against a
demoralized foe. Everybody played
except the invalids.
Any effort to select an individ
ual star (or stars) from among
the half a hundred who played
would be worse than futile. Ev
erybody looked good—and that
rugged line is no exception.
Sharp-eyed Harry Borba of the
San Francisco Examiner claims
that only one blocking assignment
was missed in the entire first hall*.
How can you pick a star when ev
erybody plays like that?
The outfit that started the game
looked better than any of the other
combinations, but they weren't in
long enough to form any inelastic
opinions about the matter. Keblu
sek turned out to be quite a ball
hawk, and Jim Cox swarmed all
over the field, to the consternation
of the Idahos. George Quist showed
signs of becoming one of the better
linebackers; that's a good place to
stop, because there isn't enough pa
per to mention them all.
One down and eight to go. The first milestone has been passed, the first milestone on that
long, long trail, the end of which is shrouded in a creeping mist. But Stanford's unexpectedly easy
45 to 0 victory over the Idaho Vandals last Saturday is of little value to one who is anxious about
the future.
The game started prosaically enough, giving little indication of what was to come. Captain

Fred Boensch lost the toss, and the
Idahos elected to receive. George
"Polar Bear" Quist kickcd ofl" to the
over-touted Jim Hatch almost to the
goal line, then got all the way
downfield to make the tackle him
self on the 29-yard line.
But the Vandals, hindered by an
offside penalty, were unable to gain;
on fourth down Hatch was forced
to kick out of bounds on the Stan
ford 26. The Cardinals, in their
turn, were unable to make a fir:,l,
down, and Lloyd Merriman kicked
out of bounds on the Vandal l r > h.
booming 45-yard spiral.
FUMBLES COSTLY
Then it happened. On the very
next play Bill Miklich. who h»d ;i
very poor day, fumbled, and Billy
flachten fell on (He hall on th«*
Idaho 15-yard line. Two plays into
the line gained the Indians seven
yards.
With three yards to go for a first
down the Idahos expected another
line play, but Buck Brownson
crossed them up. Lloyd Merriman
took a shovel pass around right end
for another seven yards and a TD.
Bill Miklich stopped him a yard in
side the end zone—too late.
George Quist kicked the extra

How can you pick a star when ev

The outfit that started the game
looked better than any of the other
combinations, but they weren't in
long enough to form any inelastic
opinions about the matter. Keblu
sek turned out to be quite a ball
hawk, and Jim Cox swarmed all
over the field, to the consternation
of the Idahos. George Quist showed
signs of becoming one of the better
linebackers; that's a good place to
stop, because there isn't enough pa
per to mention them all.
One down and eight to go. The first milestone has been passed, the first milestone on that
long, long trail, the end of which is shrouded in a creeping mist. But Stanford's unexpectedly easy
45 to 0 victory over the Idaho Vandals last Saturday is of little value to one who is anxious about
the future.
The game started prosaically enough, giving little indication of what was to come. Captain

Fred Boensch lost the toss, and the
Idahos elected to receive. George
"Polar Bear" Quist kickcd ofl" to the
over-touted Jim Hatch almost to the
goal line, then got all the way
downfield to make the tackle him
self on the 29-yard line.
But the Vandals, hindered by an
offside penalty, were unable to gain;
on fourth down Hatch was forced
to kick out of bounds on the Stan
ford 26. The Cardinals, in their
turn, were unable to make a fir:,l,
down, and Lloyd Merriman kicked
out of bounds on the Vandal l r > h.
booming 45-yard spiral.
FUMBLES COSTLY
Then it happened. On the very
next play Bill Miklich. who h»d ;i
very poor day, fumbled, and Billy
flachten fell on (He hall on th«*
Idaho 15-yard line. Two plays into
the line gained the Indians seven
yards.
With three yards to go for a first
down the Idahos expected another
line play, but Buck Brownson
crossed them up. Lloyd Merriman
took a shovel pass around right end
for another seven yards and a TD.
Bill Miklich stopped him a yard in
side the end zone—too late.
George Quist kicked the extra
point; Stanford led, 7 to 0, after
less than six minutes of play.
The Vandals roared hack willi
blood in their collective eyes.
Jack Christensen carried Quist's
kickofT to his own 26. and after three
tries into the line they had racked
up the initial first down of the after
noon. But Carl Munson, attempting
to pass, was thrown for an eight™
yard loss—and that was the end oL
Idaho.
PASSES MISFIRE
i To be sure, they didn't quit
! without a fight. Quarterback
Munson unlimbcrcd his flipping
arm and cut loose with three,
passes—one sailed 60 yards down
field—but all were incomplete,
and Stanford took over on downs.
Stanford made two first downs.
; Then, with the count fourth and 12,
Buck Browason elected to run the
ball. Lloyd Merriman saved the
day by going around left end for I!)
yards. Three plays later Brownson
passed 18 yards to Dave DeSwarte
j in the end zone. Dave kept on going
| and almost ended up in the stands,
j Quist converted, and the score at.
! the end of the first quarter was II
I to 0.
TOUCHDOWN PARADE
Then the touchdown parade
I started. It was 27 to ft at the half,
and 18 more points were picked
I up in an anticlimactic second ball,
; Dcvinc to Titus for 15 yards and a
TD, Bob Anderson around right
S end for 14 yards and a TD, Brown
i son to Wayne Erickson, for 41
j yards and another (that was a
i beautiful play; little Wayne aetu
ally stole the ball out of the hands
of two Vandal defenders).
I Gene Martin got touchdown mini
j bcr six by skirting left end for \'i
! yards. His teammates put on a
| beautiful exhibition of blocking and
faking. Mickey Titus ended the
j slaughter by going over guard for
j two yards and the 45th point.
Alter the track meet was over.
Vandal Coach Babe Brown was
the picture of a bitterly disap
pointed man. A chubby, middle
aged man with thin, graying hair,
he was a study in dejection. Net
alibi by Idaho.
"The heat?" he said. "Yes, I think
! it hurt, us, but I don't want to offer
i that as an alibi. Marchie has a fine
j team. That Merriman is quite a boy.
"My kids weren't afraid, and
had no thought of losing, but they
lost heart after they started fum
bling in the first quarter." He
paused. "Your backs are so much
faster than ours," he said slowly,
| shaking his head. "Of course the
Stanford line out-charged us all
afternoon, but those backs had the
| speed to lake advantage of it."
He turned away, then turned back
| again. "We're not through," he said,
] with a flash of spirit. "Somebody is
j going to hear from us yet."
BOWL TALK PREMATURE
There is no denying it. Profes
| sor of Football Marchie Schwartz's
j young men had a great day. But
any talk of Pasadena and the
Bowl of Roses on New Year's Day
is premature, to say the least.
Idaho proved to be much weaker

than expected. U.S.F. is going to be
a different story—and, in case you
have forgotten, there's a little date
with U.C.L.A. following the Don en
gagement. If you read football
scores, you know what the Bruins
did to Oregon State Saturday.
Only after these next two games
are past can the caliber of the
Stanford Indians as a football ma
chine be evaluated with any de
gree of accuracy. Those two out
fits are going to be TOUGII.
ENTIRE SQUAD PLAY
Marchie Schwartz sent in every
thing but the bench in an effort to
hold down the stfore; there is no
sense in humiliating a group of fine,
fighting men. But it was all to no
avail. Holding down the score is an
impossible job when you have 50 or
more tough, ambitious young men,
out to make a reputation against a
demoralized foe. Everybody played
except the invalids.
Any effort to select an individ
ual star (or stars) from among
the half a hundred who played
would be worse than futile. Ev
erybody looked good—and that
rugged line is no exception.
