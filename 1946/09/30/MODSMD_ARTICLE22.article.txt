# Team Deserves Large Hand

(Editorial)
The hoopla of Stanford's first postwar football season may go
into written history as the one with a mammoth team but a
miniature band -unless more students turn out for band practice.
Eighty-eight men went with Clark Shaughnessy s team to the
Rose Bowl in '41 as an exerienced and glorified outfit; Saturday's
; team, egually important to its rooters, was serenaded to the in
adeguate capacity of only 42 student musicians.
This year we have nearly 3,000 more potential band members
than ever before, and a schedule of games which includes tripr.
to Berkeley and U.C.L.A., performances before all Conference
teams. That gives nine chances for the band to celebrate and
have a brand of fun which is theirs exclusively.
As a big-time school with an all-time enrollment, the Farm
should make an outstanding showing on every project which it
undertakes. With the reopening of football, 7,000 students an
ticipate and would be grateful for all the trimmings. And what
ever the record of the team, the reassuring refrain of "Sons of
the Stanford Red" every Saturday will amplify the pride and
bolster the spirit of a, student body that has waited for three years
to cheer its head off from a rooting section.
Next band practice is tonight at 7.
