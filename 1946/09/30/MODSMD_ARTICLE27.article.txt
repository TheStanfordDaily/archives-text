## Divided We Stand 
### 
"Quitcha shoving!" was heard more than
once at the Idaho rally Friday night. And in
spite of the fine program put on by rally chair
men, there was more than one grumbling
complaint about the handling of the ciowd
and the seating of the students.
So after talking to a few staunch tradition
alists of the prewar school, we have culled
.some suggestions which we toss into the laps
of future rally chairmen for whatever they'i*
worth.
At prewar rallies women's and men's seat
iiig sections were separated, with the women
usually taking over the far side of the Pavilion.
As soon as the Pavilion was filled, the band
marched in, playing "Come Join the Band,"
Â«jud followed by frosh men who traditionally
sat on the Pavilion floor. While the assembled
students were singing the Farm anthem, the
football team filed in and took their places.
That's the sum total of rally tradition. And

it seems like a pretty good tradition to follow.
This arrangement can greatly relieve the
press and confusion of a rooting mob that
maired Friday night's performance; and the
separation of the men and women rooters, we
hear, is highly effective in creating some spon
taneous, colorful and imaginative yells.
In any case, Rally Com must open all Pa
vilion entrances for future rallies. The fact
that only one of the four doors was open Fri
day night created an accident hazard that must
not be repeated. Because no one was injured
in the rally stampede does not mean that seri
ous injury cannot and will not occur to some
Stanford students should rally organization
remain unaltered.
These suggestions, we think, can greatly
facilitate the handling of 3,000 spirited and
enthusiastic supporters of the Big Red Ma
chine in a Pavilion that doesn't guite fit the
need. We hope they help. M.S.
