# A 						Team Tradition?
## 
### 
Not only did Stanford's varsity football
team give an outstanding early-season per
formance in the course of Saturday's "potato
mashing" but its actions after the game de
serve praise. When the Stanford student body
went into the singing of the Stanford Hymn,
the football men going off the field were not
too tired to stop and stand respectfully during
the entire course of the singing.
It was a small point in comparison with
seven touchdowns against a Coast Conference

football opponent but it is the cumulative ef
fect of such small points that build into the
great traditions of Stanford life.
And while we praise the team for its re
spect in initiating a tradition, we should point
out to the Stanford rooting section that it is a
Stanford tradition that the entire rooting sec
tion shall stand when the Stanford band enters
the stadium. The rooting section and its yell
leaders missed that one completely Saturday.
