THE ONLY ANSWER?
In answer to all queries about the seeming in
justice of the veterans' wives' section at Saturday
games, and the season ticket price of $10.15 for them,
we submit the following facts as released by S.A.C.
head AI Masters:
It's a cas? of majority rather than minority privi
lege.
Should veterans' wives, non-members of the stu
dent body, be admitted to the rooting section, a feder
al tax of $2.74 would be slapped onto admissions for
every student attending the season's games. This
would throw an added burden on G,OOO, while at
present an estimated 100 wives are getting the less
favorable end of the arrangement.
The $10.15 price was one set by ihe Pacific Coast
Conference, and represents a 25 per cent reduction
on the face value of individual tickets. Adjustment
ol this price cannot be made by Stanford alone, since
visiting teams rate 50 per cent of the gate.
Incidentally, three of Stanford's games are non
reserved seat games—which means that students and
outside spectators sit wherever they wish.
II veterans wish to sit with their wives, they will
have to buy reserved seats to the other six games.
Those, we've been told, are the rule:;.

Dnar Editor, Ma'am:
First, let me say that I am not complaining only
on my account. I have spoken to a number of mar
ried veterans (and I'd venture a guess that a sub
stantial majority of married men feel the same way)
who are thoroughly disgusted with the football game
ticket set-up.

Season tickets are offered to veterans' wives at
the reduced rale of $10.15, for which (hey are al
lowed to sit in (he upper half of Section 'T"—real
peachy—almost 011 (he goal line. For $10.80 they
can have a GOOD reserved season seat in other
and much better sections. There Is no way a mar
ried student can sit with his wife without buying
two tickets which would cost $21 fiO—and that's a
Iji U nick out of $!M).
It's no fun watching a football game by yourself,
ami a wife who works off campus, and doesn't live
in the Village, doesn't gel much of a chance to make
many friends among other vets' wives. So she sits
by herself, half the time not knowing a drop-kick
from a forward pass.
I've heard that some people have said, "Oh, they
can stand to be separated for a few hours." Of
course we can stand it —a 10l of us were separated
for a year or more during the war—but a lot of us
had figured on bringing our wives to Stanford for a
little fun besides the hard work—and that included
going to the games together.
Certainly wi(h (he swollen enrollment, the ab
sence of (he married men who wish (o sil wi(h
(heir wives, despite (lie poor location of (he seats,
would not hurt (he appearance of the rooting sec
tion. The only apparent reason (hen is (he S.A.C.
desire (o make a little more money—at the expense
of (he vets.
I suggest they reduce the size of the men's rooting
section, and enlarge the space allotted in the "T" sec
lion to allow the men entrance to that section on
their student body card, *
Sincerely,
Frank Q. Tlewitl.

Dnar Editor, Ma'am:
First, let me say that I am not complaining only
on my account. I have spoken to a number of mar
ried veterans (and I'd venture a guess that a sub
stantial majority of married men feel the same way)
who are thoroughly disgusted with the football game
ticket set-up.

Season tickets are offered to veterans' wives at
the reduced rale of $10.15, for which (hey are al
lowed to sit in (he upper half of Section 'T"—real
peachy—almost 011 (he goal line. For $10.80 they
can have a GOOD reserved season seat in other
and much better sections. There Is no way a mar
ried student can sit with his wife without buying
two tickets which would cost $21 fiO—and that's a
Iji U nick out of $!M).
It's no fun watching a football game by yourself,
ami a wife who works off campus, and doesn't live
in the Village, doesn't gel much of a chance to make
many friends among other vets' wives. So she sits
by herself, half the time not knowing a drop-kick
from a forward pass.
I've heard that some people have said, "Oh, they
can stand to be separated for a few hours." Of
course we can stand it —a 10l of us were separated
for a year or more during the war—but a lot of us
had figured on bringing our wives to Stanford for a
little fun besides the hard work—and that included
going to the games together.
Certainly wi(h (he swollen enrollment, the ab
sence of (he married men who wish (o sil wi(h
(heir wives, despite (lie poor location of (he seats,
would not hurt (he appearance of the rooting sec
tion. The only apparent reason (hen is (he S.A.C.
desire (o make a little more money—at the expense
of (he vets.
I suggest they reduce the size of the men's rooting
section, and enlarge the space allotted in the "T" sec
lion to allow the men entrance to that section on
their student body card, *
Sincerely,
Frank Q. Tlewitl.
THE ONLY ANSWER?
In answer to all queries about the seeming in
justice of the veterans' wives' section at Saturday
games, and the season ticket price of $10.15 for them,
we submit the following facts as released by S.A.C.
head AI Masters:
It's a cas? of majority rather than minority privi
lege.
Should veterans' wives, non-members of the stu
dent body, be admitted to the rooting section, a feder
al tax of $2.74 would be slapped onto admissions for
every student attending the season's games. This
would throw an added burden on G,OOO, while at
present an estimated 100 wives are getting the less
favorable end of the arrangement.
The $10.15 price was one set by ihe Pacific Coast
Conference, and represents a 25 per cent reduction
on the face value of individual tickets. Adjustment
ol this price cannot be made by Stanford alone, since
visiting teams rate 50 per cent of the gate.
Incidentally, three of Stanford's games are non
reserved seat games—which means that students and
outside spectators sit wherever they wish.
II veterans wish to sit with their wives, they will
have to buy reserved seats to the other six games.
Those, we've been told, are the rule:;.
