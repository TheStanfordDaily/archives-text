## BULL SESSION

Kinda looks like we have a football loam this
year, doesn't it? 01 course, Idaho is mighty small
potatoes (ouch!) in this Pacific Coast Conference and
it will be next Saturday against U.S.F. (Diddle the
lions) that will tell the tale.
But even so, the squad looked mighty good out
there and it will certainly be a team that no one
will have to make apologies for. The Big Red Ma
chine of this year has more enthusiasm and hubba
hubba than any outfit I can remember from pre-war
days. The Rose Bowl squad of '40, Albeit et al., was
a coldly precise, efficient machine Deadly but very
little of the old college rah-rah.

Looks like the cliches about tho war developing
llie ingenuity of the vets might have something in
Ihem. I can remember the days when the Dekes
sweated vigorously throwing water bags at passing
pedestrians. Al Friday night's torchlight parade, they
evoked the modern touch and had a sprinkler sit
ting in the middle of the street, which they turned
on al the appropriate moment. The band got well
watered. One bass horn player swallowed a quart
and a half of water on an inhale.

Two of our big manly football players looked
awfully cute after the game Saturday as they trot
ted back to the gym in skirts. Dave DeSwarte and
Buck Brownson both had embarrassing rips in their
pants and had to wrap blankets around themselves
for the trek through the crowd back to the gym. My,
they looked sweet.
All Fred Boensch needs is a lancp and a while
charger to go with that medieval-looking helmet of

his and ho can qualify as a knight in any King Ar
thur's court. Our own Prince Valiant.

Interesting rumors have l>een circulating that the
yellow flowers growing under the seats on the east
ern side of the stadium sprang from the seeds of the
chrysanthemums worn by Cal women at the last Big
Game here.
Speculation has been rife as lo just what the
Bear girls were doing under the seats.
As an upholder of the honor of our state's fair
maidenhood, I am forced to reveal that the stories are
false. Col doesn't sit on that side during the Big
Game and, besides, the flowers are just weeds, not
'mums.

I have before me the astonishing details of an
incredible plot concocted by some of our frosh to gel
the Axe back from Cal. The story (revealed to me
in secret conference with Drew Pearson and Walter
Wincholl) cannot, of course, be published, but it
shows an ingenuity worthy of the Immortal 21.
Reason I mention it at all is that it reminds me of
a recent move by a group from one of the tongs
with a similar motive. Fired with tremendous en
thusiasm and absolutely no plan, they started ofl for
the Cal campus determined to bring back tho Axe
at all costs.
m As they passed one of the taverns on tho highway
north of here, they decided that perhaps it would bo
better lo discuss their strategy over a brew.
Whon they returned to campus much, much later,
they had gotten no further north and the only thing
they carried back was one of the bros.
