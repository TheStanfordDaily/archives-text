# THE 						STANFORD STORY
## Statesman or Robber Baron, Stanford Remembered a Son 
### BILL HORNBY 
(Editor's note: 'The Stanford
Story" is a regular feature of the
Stanford Daily which hopes to re
new the interest of the student
hody in the fascinating history of
the University.)
Leland Stanford, Sr., has been
treated by historians as both a
"noble statesman" and a "robber
baron." An energetic, ambitious
country boy who could be as ruth
less as his times demanded, Stan
lord was one of that small group of
American capitalists and politicians
who read the meaning of the new
industrialism which began to grip
America in earnest immediately
after the Civil War.
Stanford had studied law in his
native New York and lived the life
of a frontier lawyer in Wisconsin.
At the age of 28 he traveled to Cali
fornia over the Isthmus of Panama
to join five brothel's in the rough
and ready business of supplying
miners.
By 1855 lie had bought his
brothers' interest in the main Sac
ramcnto supply store, and live
years later he had behind him a
bankroll of $25,00(1 and a consid
erable grass-roots influence in
the growing Republican party of
the young state, lie was on the
threshold of that select circle of
capitalists who controlled the
America of Ulysses Grant, Ben
jamin Harrison, and Graver
Ch •ve land.
One of the main backers of Abe
Lincoln in the Far West, Stanford
became Governor of California in
1801 in a political victory which de
termined that California was to re
main in the Union. His tact and
firmness in holding the rich West
ern state to the Union gave him a
national reputation.
Later when the motives and tac
tics of the "railroad builders" were
under fire Stanford escaped much
of the criticism heaped on his con
temporaries because of his record
of public service.
The Central Pacific Railroad
was the baby of four Sacramento
business men—Stanford, Hopkins,
Crocker, and Huntington. Stan
bird was Ihe president of this
combine that fought the railroad
through. In 180!) the East was
connected with California when
the "Golden Spike" was driven in
Utah.
A year before this great event
which brought Stanford his mil
lions, Leland Stanford, Jr., was born
in Sacramento. He seems to have
been an exceptional boy, unusually
handsome, healthy, and as unspoiled
and non-efTeminate as it is possible
for the only child of wealthy, dot
ing parents to be.
The Stanford Museum holds a
curious testament to the range ol
his interests. His drawings of ob
served scenes were prolific if crude;
his constant interest in machinery
and mechanics is proven by letters
and mementoes. He was given ev
erything a boy could possibly want
- expensive toys, ponies, guns, even
toy steamboats with real live steam.
His 16 - year life was a colorful
patchwork of play in a brownstone
mansion on Nob Hill, ol outdoor
wanderings on the sunny Palo Alio
Farm where his father bred cham
pion trotters, of trips to Europe and
to the East Coast.
A few weeks before his 10th
birthday, the boy di"d from typhoid
fever in Florence, Italy. He had
been with his parents on a tour of

art centers where he had personally
made many purchases. His death
was unexpected as it followed a
relapse after the disease had seem
ingly run its course.
The Stanfords were paralyzed
with grief. No amount of promi
nence or money could blot out the
fact that the hopes they had pinned
on this son were smashed.
There is a story that the idea of,
a great university as a memorial to I
the dead*boy came to the Stanfords '
almost immediately after his pass- j
ing.
Whether or riot it is true that the
aging "Governor" had a vision in
which his son appeared and urged
him to provide for others as he
would have for his son, it is a mat
ter of record that the sorrowing
Stanfords were soon besieging
American educators lor .advice on
their projected memorial.
President Eliot ol Harvard (old
(hem a university placed on (he
I'alo Alio Farm would be prefer- j
able (o a museum in San Fran
cisco or a purely (echnical, scien
tific school.
How much would it cost? At
least $5,000,000 as a starter, Eliot
told them.
"Well, Jane, I guess we can man
age that," the Senator said, and he
later told Eliot that he wanted to
build the school not only as a me
morial but as a project to give his
wife an interest in a life battered by
the boy's death.
Stanford himself had some very
fixed ideas about the school. It must
be on the exact part of the Farm
where his son had played, not up
in the foothills as the architects de
sired. It should stress agricultural
training, for it was to be located on
the scene of the Senator's own ex
periments in scientific farming.
It was to provide a full liberal
education, but "astronomers can't
explore the heavens without bread
and butter . . . the University
must aflord a technical educa

lion which will enable every stu
dent to earn a living and some
thing more than a living . . . ev
ery useful art is to he taught. The
arts (it making shoes and clothes,
of printing, carving, telegraphy,
stenography, no less Init rather
more than the arts of music,
painting, ami sculpture."
As the Stanfords visited more
universities their concept of a school
widened. Hut they never lost their
determination that the Leland Stan
lord Junior University was to be of
Ihe finest, paying the highest prices
for faculty, drawing upon all classes
(jf young men, and giving them thai
practical view of life which had
pushed a young country lawyer into
the presidency of a great railroad
and, in his last years, the Senate of
the United States.

Leland Stanford, Sr., has been
treated by historians as both a
"noble statesman" and a "robber
baron." An energetic, ambitious
country boy who could be as ruth
less as his times demanded, Stan
lord was one of that small group of
American capitalists and politicians
who read the meaning of the new
industrialism which began to grip
America in earnest immediately
after the Civil War.
Stanford had studied law in his
native New York and lived the life
of a frontier lawyer in Wisconsin.
At the age of 28 he traveled to Cali
fornia over the Isthmus of Panama
to join five brothel's in the rough
and ready business of supplying
miners.
By 1855 lie had bought his
brothers' interest in the main Sac
ramcnto supply store, and live
years later he had behind him a
bankroll of $25,00(1 and a consid
erable grass-roots influence in
the growing Republican party of
the young state, lie was on the
threshold of that select circle of
capitalists who controlled the
America of Ulysses Grant, Ben
jamin Harrison, and Graver
Ch •ve land.
One of the main backers of Abe
Lincoln in the Far West, Stanford
became Governor of California in
1801 in a political victory which de
termined that California was to re
main in the Union. His tact and
firmness in holding the rich West
ern state to the Union gave him a
national reputation.
Later when the motives and tac
tics of the "railroad builders" were
under fire Stanford escaped much
of the criticism heaped on his con
temporaries because of his record
of public service.
The Central Pacific Railroad
was the baby of four Sacramento
business men—Stanford, Hopkins,
Crocker, and Huntington. Stan
bird was Ihe president of this
combine that fought the railroad
through. In 180!) the East was
connected with California when
the "Golden Spike" was driven in
Utah.
A year before this great event
which brought Stanford his mil
lions, Leland Stanford, Jr., was born
in Sacramento. He seems to have
been an exceptional boy, unusually
handsome, healthy, and as unspoiled
and non-efTeminate as it is possible
for the only child of wealthy, dot
ing parents to be.
The Stanford Museum holds a
curious testament to the range ol
his interests. His drawings of ob
served scenes were prolific if crude;
his constant interest in machinery
and mechanics is proven by letters
and mementoes. He was given ev
erything a boy could possibly want
- expensive toys, ponies, guns, even
toy steamboats with real live steam.
His 16 - year life was a colorful
patchwork of play in a brownstone
mansion on Nob Hill, ol outdoor
wanderings on the sunny Palo Alio
Farm where his father bred cham
pion trotters, of trips to Europe and
to the East Coast.
A few weeks before his 10th
birthday, the boy di"d from typhoid
fever in Florence, Italy. He had
been with his parents on a tour of

art centers where he had personally
made many purchases. His death
was unexpected as it followed a
relapse after the disease had seem
ingly run its course.
The Stanfords were paralyzed
with grief. No amount of promi
nence or money could blot out the
fact that the hopes they had pinned
on this son were smashed.
There is a story that the idea of,
a great university as a memorial to I
the dead*boy came to the Stanfords '
almost immediately after his pass- j
ing.
Whether or riot it is true that the
aging "Governor" had a vision in
which his son appeared and urged
him to provide for others as he
would have for his son, it is a mat
ter of record that the sorrowing
Stanfords were soon besieging
