# Santa Rosa Tops Green J.V Eleven
## 
### DON DAVIES 
Despite some brilliant passing by
A 1 Morris, and some fine defensive
play, the hard-fighting but green
Stanford jayvees succumbed to a
heavier and more experienced San
ta Rosa Junior College outfit, 18-13,
in Saturday's preliminary to the
Idaho mashing.
Alter a jittery first quarter of
fumbles and interceptions, Coach
Ed Station's Cards throttled their
offense late in the second period
and broke the scoring ice. Sub
left half Jim O'Neill opened the
70-yard sustained drive with a
40-yard run to the Santa Rosa .'5O
- line. A few plays later Paul
Kent tried tackle for 6 points.
The conversion try was no good,
and the locals led (>-0.
The northerners turned on their
own ignition, sparked by the pass
ing of little Hon James, and drove
deep into Stanford territory, only to
have their threat stopped by A 1
Morriss' interception on the 10-yard
stripe.
With less than a minute to play,
and a (! - point half - time lead
sewed up, the jayvees watched
alert Santa Rosa tackle Chuck
Ziehn steal the ball and step over
the goal line as the gun sounded.
The try for extra point was missed
and the boys walked into the
locker room with the score tied at
<;-uii.
Only bright spot in a dully played
third period was a 63-yard pass
run-lateral play from James to end
Dave McCarty to guard Harvey Do
rori, which netted the junior col
legers another 6 points and a 12-6
lead. The opening minutes of the
fourth period saw the J.C. boys
drive for their third tally, and a
comfortable 18-6 margin.
Halfway in the fourth quarter the
Stanfords' hot - and - cold offense
came to life again. Starting on the
5-yard line, A 1 Morris completed
three passes for 35. 20, and 13 yards
apiece, to put the Indians deep into
Santa Rosa territory.
Fullback Ben Cardinalli hur
dled his way to the one-yard line,
and on the next play crashed over
for the score to culminate the 95-
yard drive. Willie Altus kicked
the extra point and the gap was
narrowed to 18-13.
The jayvees fought right down to
the final gun for a winning tally, but
the hands of the big Associated clock
were against them and the favorqd
Santa Rosans left the field with a
ft-point margin.
Next Saturday the junior varsity
travels to Areata, Calif., for a game
with Humboldt State.
