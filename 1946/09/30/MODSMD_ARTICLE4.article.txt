LOS ANGELES, Sept. 2!) (UP).
—The CIO International Long
shoremen's and Warehousemen's
Union tonight scheduled a "stop- (
work" meeting at (» p.m. Monday |
in the Los Angeles harbor, six
hours before a coastwise strike
tentatively set, for Tuesday at j

ILWU President Harry Bridges
is conferring in San Francisco with
Federal Mediator Nathan Fein- j
singer and representatives of the j
Waterfront Employers' Associa
tion. The union's contract expires J
tomorrow midnight.

Edgar L. Warren, chief of the U.S. j
Conciliation Service, told reporters j
after two fruitless conferences with j
union leaders and ship operators
that the government needed at least j
24 hours more—about all that re- j
mained before the strike deadline— |
to "avert another maritime walk- j
out."
He pleaded with the unions not to j
"jump the nun" on the deadline. He i
recalled the recent 16-day walkout \
by AFL and CIO seamen was pre
cipitated when union members "hit. J
the beach" ahead of the schedule. |
"This time we are asking for a ,
fair chance to work out a peaceful j
settlement," he said. "(Our) at- j
tempts . . . have reached a critical \
stage."
