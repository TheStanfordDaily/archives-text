# Roving Octopus Gathers Dope From Post-Game Bystanders

### 
Cornered in the proverbial round
house after the Indian victory, the
following victims gave forth with
their varied opinions.
A delighted freshman: "Stan
ford looked great. Did Idaho look
weak? Yes—but it can't be de
nied that Marchie Schwartz has
put out an excellent team. Ugh!"
A conservative junior: "Idaho
looked awfully weak. The Indians'
real test will come next week
against the Dons. But at least we
won't get pushed around by every
team, I hope."
B. C«ugel, former Chappie edi
tor: "Are we going to the Rose
Bowl? Ha. ha, ha! You got holes
in your head? Ha! If Stanford
goes to the Rose Bowl, I will run
out on the field and eat chocolate
covered cucumbers during the
second quarter. The team to watch

is Washington. Ha. ha!"
A senior from the South: "What
did you all think about Idaho, suh?
You might compare Idaho to the
South. If they had had the guns,
they would have won. You all sat
isfied with that answer?"
