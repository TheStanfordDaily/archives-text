# Bums, Cardinals Tie for National League Pennant
## Cooper Blanks Dodgers with Four Hits; Cubs Rally in Big Sixth to Clip St. Loo 
### 
NEW YORK, Sept. 29 (UP). —Baseball's greatest season-long pennant fight ended today in a
( tie between the Dodgers and Cardinals as Brooklyn dropped its final game to Boston 4to 0 and
St. Louis lost to Chicago 8 to 3.
It was the first deadlock in a pennant race in the history of major league baseball.
The teams will square off in a three-game playoff series beginning Tuesday at St. Louis to
determine which will represent the National League in the World Series against the Boston Red

| Sox, the American League winner.
The second game of the series will
be played in Brooklyn on Thursday ;
and the third, if necessary, will be
1 at Ebbetts Field Friday. That de
{ lays the start of the World Series
j until Sunday when the teams meet
J for the first game in the city of the j
National League winner.
The Boston pitcher, Morton
Cooper never won a game that
| meant more to St. Louis than to
day's even when he was pitching
the Cards to three straight pen
nants, because a Dodger victory
i would have given Brooklyn the
I pennant.
But Cooper, hurling his second
straight shutout—he beat the Giants
on three hits Thursday—showed all
the fire and finesse that marked his
work before a sore arm slowed him j
in the 1945 season.
It was a fitting fight to a mad 167-
I day struggle that began last April
I 16. Aside from the first four days of
j the campaign, the Dodgers and
j Cardinals monopolized the race all
the way.
The Dodgers held the lead for
98 days during the campaign,
while the Cards were in first place
for 40, the teams were tied for 25
and the Cubs were out in front
for four.
Brooklyn once held a seven and a
half game lead on July 2 and at
July 4, the traditional mid-season
mark was seven games in front
while the Red Sox, who made a
run-away of the American League
race were in front by only six
games.
The Cards lost a chance to win
the pennant outright at the same
time that the Dodgers hopes of cap
turing the flag without a playoff
went glimmering.
St. Louis was leading 2 to 1 as the
Cubs came to bat in the sixth inn
ing and the scoreboard showed Bos
ton leading the Dodgers, 1 to 0. with
the Braves at bat in the ninth.
But the good news failed to bol

ster the Redhirds, for as the
Braves were scoring three more
runs at Brooklyn to defeat the
Dodgers 4 to 0, Che Cubs came up
with five in their half of the sixth
and then coasted to victory. 8 to I!.
So while Mort Cooper, the fast
ball righthander who had hurled the
Cards to pennants and world cham
pionships, was turning back the
Dodgers, the Cards were unable to
take advantage of what their former
teammate did for them.
It was an old St. Louis nemesis,
southpaw Johnny Shniitz who
spiked the Redbirds heavy artillery
with eight scattered hits as he re
corded his fourth victory in six
starts against them.
Shmitz, who came here from a
Chicago hospital where he was be
ing treated for an infected foot, per
mitted the Cards to score in only
two innings—two in the third and
one in the eighth—as the Cards left
10 men on the base paths.
While he was keeping the Car
dinal attack bottled up. the Cubs
were making merry with the of
ferings of most of the five pitchers
Manager Eddie Dyer sent out in a
vain attempt to salvage the im
portant contest.
However, the Dodgers, a high
octane mixture of spunky kids and
creaking old-timers, could not

maintain that furious pace and were
overtaken by the Cardinals on m
Western road trip shortly thereafter.
From that time on, the teams
battled neck and neck.
And in the end ii was big Cooper
who set them down with lour hits
and cost them a chance to win the
pennant without a playoff—the same
Cooper they had beaten to win the
1941 flag and who had come back to
beat them in a key game which
meant the 1942 pennant.
