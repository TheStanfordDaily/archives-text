# Oh, Well, Ho-hum! Hogan Wins Again
## 
### 
DALLAS, Tex., Sept. 29 (UP).—
Golfdom's little icicle, Bantam Ben
Hogan. Hershey, Pa., today won the
$10,000 Dallas Open championship
with a four-over-par 284—exactly
the score he predicted five days ago
it would take to win over the long
and well - trapped Brook Hollow
Country Club course.
Par proved an elusive goal to
every one of the 83 professionals
and amateurs who started the 72-
hole medal play Thursday, but Ho
gan proved the most consistent of
the lot as he tacked a 73, three over
par, to his 54-hole total of 211 to
give him a two-stroke lead over the
field.
