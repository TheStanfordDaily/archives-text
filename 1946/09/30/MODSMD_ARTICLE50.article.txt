# Henry Makes Music History With New Production Angles
## 
### 
If the Daily reader wants to go
see "Henry V" at the Stage Door
Theater in San Francisco, he has
undoubtedly read at least one other
commentary on the film by a pro
fessional critic in any of several
widely circulated publications. That
being the case, we shall point out
a few things our big brothers may
have missed.
First, we shall have to take ex
ception with many reviewers who
have boldly asserted that "Henry V"
is the finest movie ever made. Since
we haven't seen every movie that
was ever made, we will be content
to say that it's the finest we've ever
seen and probably will see for some
time to come.
NEAR PERFECTION
To list the many instances of per
fection in Laurence Olivier's pro
duction would take far too much
space to be interesting and too much
time to be read over Cellar coffee,
so wo shall present a few selected
samples from our notes to point up
our case.
In contrast with usual stage tech
nique the best known soliloquy of
"Henry V'"—that which occurs as
Henry sits by a campfire on the eve
of the Battle of Agineourt and pon
ders the struggle to come —is not
spoken into the camera but is a
background to the long study of his
face. Mr. Olivier pantomimes with
his face alone the inner turmoil ex
pressed by Shakespeare's lines cre
ating the most brilliant bit of pro
duction of the entire piece.
UNREAL SCENERY
Many of the panoramic back
grounds of the English and the
French countryside instead of being
meticulously laid out or achieved
by projected background films are
unabashed stage drops painted with
a charming subtlety which give a
half-real quality to the scenes. Most
remarkably, the "fairy tale" mood
engendered complements the dia
logue and action—once again—per
fectly.
Certainly the method of presen
tation deserves careful considera
tion. The film begins with a sweep
ing aerial portrait of Elizabethan
London which is focused down
gradually on the Globe Theater
where a matinee of "The Chronicle

History of King Henry" is about to
j be performed.
"GLOBE"SCENES
We are given a fantastically inti
mate glimpse of the backstage pro
ceedings, then the Chorus steps out
and the action begins. Three scenes
of exposition are enacted by the
members of the Globe company,
1 then, at the point of boredom, we
; are released from the confines of
1 (he static stage and are whisked
I through the curtain to the Dover
I coast where Henry and his blood
; thirsty bowmen are about to sail
for the glorious war against France.
From that point until the final
j scene the amazing capacities of the
j cinema as a Shakespearean medium
, are exploited to the minimum. In
1 that final scene the camera closes in
! on Henry and Katherine of France,

his newly wedded, until only
Henry's face is on the screen. The
I camera backs away to disclose not
Henry and Katherine but an actor
playing Henry and a young boy
made up as Katherine and we are
returned to the Globe.
Unlike the md of most good mo
vies (which isn't to say that most
movies are good) this one left us
with a feeling of disappointment at
being jolted back into the reality of
the Globe after the absorbing unre
ality in which we had been living
for such a brief time. Previously we
had felt such a disappointment only
after a particularly engrossing stage
play, but for a movie to do it to us;
well, we're convinced that with the
screen appearance of "Henry V," the
movies have at last come of age. —

From that point until the final

Unlike the md of most good mo
vies (which isn't to say that most
movies are good) this one left us
with a feeling of disappointment at
being jolted back into the reality of
the Globe after the absorbing unre
ality in which we had been living
for such a brief time. Previously we
had felt such a disappointment only
after a particularly engrossing stage
play, but for a movie to do it to us;
well, we're convinced that with the
screen appearance of "Henry V," the
movies have at last come of age. —
George L. Moore.
If the Daily reader wants to go
see "Henry V" at the Stage Door
Theater in San Francisco, he has
undoubtedly read at least one other
commentary on the film by a pro
fessional critic in any of several
widely circulated publications. That
being the case, we shall point out
a few things our big brothers may
have missed.
First, we shall have to take ex
ception with many reviewers who
have boldly asserted that "Henry V"
is the finest movie ever made. Since
we haven't seen every movie that
was ever made, we will be content
to say that it's the finest we've ever
seen and probably will see for some
time to come.
NEAR PERFECTION
To list the many instances of per
fection in Laurence Olivier's pro
duction would take far too much
space to be interesting and too much
time to be read over Cellar coffee,
so wo shall present a few selected
samples from our notes to point up
our case.
In contrast with usual stage tech
nique the best known soliloquy of
"Henry V'"—that which occurs as
Henry sits by a campfire on the eve
of the Battle of Agineourt and pon
ders the struggle to come —is not
spoken into the camera but is a
background to the long study of his
face. Mr. Olivier pantomimes with
his face alone the inner turmoil ex
pressed by Shakespeare's lines cre
ating the most brilliant bit of pro
duction of the entire piece.
UNREAL SCENERY
Many of the panoramic back
grounds of the English and the
French countryside instead of being
meticulously laid out or achieved
by projected background films are
unabashed stage drops painted with
a charming subtlety which give a
half-real quality to the scenes. Most
remarkably, the "fairy tale" mood
engendered complements the dia
logue and action—once again—per
fectly.
Certainly the method of presen
tation deserves careful considera
tion. The film begins with a sweep
ing aerial portrait of Elizabethan
London which is focused down
gradually on the Globe Theater
where a matinee of "The Chronicle

History of King Henry" is about to
j be performed.
"GLOBE"SCENES
We are given a fantastically inti
mate glimpse of the backstage pro
ceedings, then the Chorus steps out
and the action begins. Three scenes
of exposition are enacted by the
members of the Globe company,
