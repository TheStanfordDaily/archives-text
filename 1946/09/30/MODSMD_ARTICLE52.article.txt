LABORATORIES GONE
According to Glasse, It is esti- !
mated that in Poland alone over
1.000 students will die of tubercu
losis without receiving aid provided
by W.S.S.F. for students in war
torn countries. Hilland's universi
ties were completely devoid of all i

laboratory equipment under Nazi
rule.
While other countries can receive
or still have books, those same
countries are lacking in necessary
notebooks, paper, pencils, and pens
which arc also provided through
W.S.S.F.
