NUERNBKRG, Germany, Tuesday, Oct. 1 (UP). —Twenty-one top Nazi
leaders adjudged guilty of aggressive war by tne International War Crimes
Tribunal come to court for the last time today to hear sentences pro
nounced against them—and indications arc that lit may l>e shot or hanged
for crimes against humanity.
The tribunal yesterday judged all 21, as well as the missing Martin

Borman, guilty along with Adolf
Hitler in waging aggressive war
against 12 nations. It also indicated
that the majority of them would he.
found guilty of ordering or partici
pating in war crimes and atrocities.
The court pronounced mass guilt

of the Gestapo, the SS-SD, and the
five top brackets of the Nazi party
leadership corps. Most of them will

Allied Control Council today re
versed a decision that any of the
Nuernberg defendants who are

now be punished for war crimes
that included the murders of 6.000,-
000 Jews and uncounted numbers
of others.
The tribunal ruled that the
German general staff and high
command, the cabinet and the SA
Brownshirts were not giiiltv as
organizations, but individual
members could be prosecuted for
specific war erimcs.
The court reserved its verdict
against the 21 defendants until to
day, but indicated in its eight-hour
denunciation, read by the justices
in relays, that all connected with
the activities of the three guilty or
ganizations were doomed to die.
The tribunal made the guilt of
cach defendant clear in this his
toric dcnunciation;
"Hitler could not have made
aggressive war by himself. He
had to have the co-operation of
statesmen, military leaders, diplo
mats, and businessmen.
"When, with the knowledge of his
aims, they gave him their co-opera
tion, they made themselves parties
to the plan he initiated. That they
were assigned their tasks by a dic
tator does not absolve them from
responsibility for their acts."
More significant than this verdict,
however, was the list of defendants'
names that rang out in the court
during a recapitulation of mass
atrocities on the eastern front —
Frank, von Neurath, Goering, Sauc
kel, Flick, Bormann, Kaltenbrun
ner.
It appeared probable that not a
single one of these defendants con
nected with atrocities on the east
ern front — Russia, Poland and
Czechoslovakia—would escape the.
death penalty.
It appeared that those whoso
activities were confined almost
solely to business, propaganda and
diplomacy — Hialmar Schacht,
Hans Fritsche and Franz von Pa
pen— might escape with prison
sentences.
In addition to the 21 defendants
in the dock and the missing Mar
tin Bormann, who is presumed to
have been killed by a Russian
shell in Berlin, the court pro
nounced mass guilt against an es
timated 500,000 members of the.
three guilty Nazi organizations.
Among the crimes charged to tlu*
Gestapo and SS were the slaying of
all aged, insane, and incurable slave
workers and others—"useless eat
ers"—who were put to death in spe
cial institutions.
