# Villagers to Receive Adeled Living Space
## 
### 
Village residents are assured of more room in their dormito
ries by C. E. Cunningham, assistant resident counselor. The
Village was prepared to house at least 1500 single students at
the opening of this quarter, but little more than 1000 actually
appeared, according to Mr. Cunningham.

More room will be arranged by
removing several beds from their
present location and opening other
buildings not now occupied.
Facilities had been provided orig
inally for 278 married couples but
only 75 couples have reported to the
president's office. At one time this
year the Dean of Student's office had
on file applications for rooms from
over 1400 married couples.
Of the five buildings intended for
married couples, two are vacant.
At the present 85 single women
are housed in a building that was
intended to accommodate 100.
Mr. Cunningham believes that if
500 more single students were to
descend on his office over night they
could be properly housed.
