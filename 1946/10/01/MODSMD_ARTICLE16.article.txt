# U.S. May Ransom Airmen in China
## 
### 
SHANGHAI, China. Sept. 30
(UP). —Word was spreading through
the wild, mountainous Lolo country
today that the United States was
willing to pay ransom in silver, salt
and food for five U.S. airmen held
as slaves for the past two years.
Hope for the fliers' safety was
dimmed somewhat by information
that the Lolo tribesmen once were
—and possibly may be still—head
hunters.
A Chinese Catholic priest, one of
the few "outsiders" Lolos trust, has
started out on foot from Sichang in
southeastern Sikang province in an
attempt to learn the Lolos' ransom
terms.
The priest hopes to reach the
owners of the American slaves
through the "bamboo wireless" —
Chinese grapevine—and arrange for
their safe delivery to some village
on the fringe of the Lolo country,
less than five days' hike from Si
chang.
If lie fails, it would mean an
American rescue team must make
dangerous, 73-milc journey from
Sichang to Woloho, where the air
men frequently have been seen
working for the Lolos under close
guard. Such a journey would take
perhaps months over mountain
peaks towering 28.000 feet and
across icy tributaries of the Yang
tze River.
