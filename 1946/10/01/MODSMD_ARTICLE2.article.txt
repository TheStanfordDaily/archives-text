# Injuns Prep For Big One Against Dons
## Bell Set to Play; Phelps Injured 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
Stanford's footballers romped
through a light drill yesterday,
limbering up any kinks that may
have resulted from Saturday's little
interlude with Idaho. Professor of
Football Marchie Schwartz reports
that all hands are in good shape and
raring to go.
Don Phelps, a guard, turned out
for practice wearing a bird cage; he
has a broken nose in memory of the
Vandals, but will be able to play.
Aside from that, there were no in
juries of note.

little except a signal drill and a

Winner of the first Kecblc
Award of the season was Bill
Ilachtcn, who played a stellar
game at guard against Idaho.
The award consists of a beautiful
fountain pen engraved with the
winner's name, donated by Kee
blc's of Palo Alto.
One of these pens is given each
week to the outstanding Stanford
player, as selected by the Peerless
Picker (identity anonymous). Be
fore the war the Kcchle Award
was a regular event on the Farm,
and has made its return with the
revival of football.

short dummy scrimmage. Time
was divided about equally be
tween passing and running. There
was no body contact drill. That
will come later in the week—with
a vengeance.
The San Francisco Dons, off last
Sunday's performance against the
Nevada Wolfpack, appear to be all
that has been claimed for them.
They may be a bit weak on defense
—Nevada rolled up 19 first downs—
but Clipper Smith's offset T leaves
little to be desired (from the stand
point of a U.S.F. roter).
Marchie Schwartz, who scouted
the Dons personally, was visibly im
pressed by Forrest Hall, the little
:E.7 sprinter who doubles as a half
back. Even Parsons, Merriman, and
Marty Anderson, the Card speed
boys, can't hope to catch up with
him if he ever gets out in the open.
Ainslie Bell again showed great
form throwing t lie hall around
yesterday, and will definitely be
ready for U.S.F. His accuracy is
little short of phenomenal. When
there are three men down the
field in a hunch, he doesn't just
toss the hall into the middle of
the group and let them fight it
out—he hits the man who is sup
posed to get the ball.
All the backs and ends loked good
snagging passes out of the air, but
Duve DeSwarte again overshadowed
all of them with impossible stops.
Lloyd Merriman makes it look easy.
When one of them is over his head
he merely puts on an extra burst
of speed and takes it over his
shoulder — like a centerfielder, no
less.
Enthusiasm at the start of the drill
seemed a little below the normal In
dian standard, but as time went on
the boys got into the swing of things.
The worst hazard seemed to be the
mosquitoes, which got pretty vicious
after dark. A move is under way to
rename the practice field Mosquito
Hollow.
The Cardinal gridders are a bit
unusual this year in that they have
three fullbacks fast enough to run
the ends. When Lloyd Merriman
dropped back into the safety slot
last Saturday a precedent was set.
Fullbacks just don't run back punts
in normal football circles, but Lloyd
has the speed and evasiveness to
turn the trick —plus plenty of drive
that he can use in a pinch.
Prof. Schwartz never misses an
opportunity to impress on his
charges the necessity of taking
each game as it comes, without
looking beyond. He knows that
great teams have lost games by
failing to take an expected
"breather" seriously. At the en
trance to the football dressing
room is a little blackboard. All
last week it said "Idaho FIRST—
THEN U.S.F." Five minutes after
the Vandal game was over it had
been brought up to date: "U.S.F.
NOW!"
Marchie has not revealed his plans
for the rest of the week, but from
today on there will undoubtedly be
plenty of defensive work. The Dons
shape up as a high-scoring team.
Among other things, some method
of stopping Forrest "One Play" Hall
must be devised.
