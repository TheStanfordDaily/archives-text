# Game Rooter Section Split
## 
### 
A divided rooting section separat
ing men and women will be invoked
at all football games in the future,
according to a new ruling passed by
Rally Com at its meeting last night.
The measure was presented after
comment by students that a divided
rooting section would encourage
louder rooting and present a better
appearance. The rooting sections at
the rallies, however, will continue
to be undivided.
U.S.F.'s student body president
and one member of the Don's foot
ball team will be featured on the
program of Friday night's rally at
the pavilion, according to Illie Cos
tigan and Ken Lettich, co-chairman.
Jack Vandenberg will M.C. the
rally, while Rena Jean Black will
repeat a number she sang at the
Freshmen Jolly-up. A skit with
Newt. Arnold as reader will follow
an original song by Martha Schwim
lcy and Barbara Carter to the tunc
of "San Francisco."
Bonnie Hanson and Don Foster,
co-chairman of Rally Com, an
nounced that card tricks will not be
used at the USF-Stanford game, but
will definitely be used for the UCLA
tilt.
