## The
						Axe Yell 
### 
The lead paragraph of an Oakland Tribune
story yesterday attributed to Dr. Tresidder the
opinion that Stanford's tradition-bound Axe is
at present as significant as any other "two or
three pounds of metal."
Hardly concurring on the face value of this
opinion, we nevertheless see Dr. Tresidder's
point- that as a sports trophy the Axe is a
symbol of a nurtured inter-collegiate rivalry
and one means by which a heterogenous
group of students finds a common loyalty.
But as a plaything for Cal or Stanford-"cloak
and-dagger boys," or an object of a not-so
petty theft, the Axe's sporting traditions auto
matically disappear.
Despite the current lack of campus com
ment on the Axe's whereabouts, no Stanford
man will deny that we want it back. But we

want it back on just the terms that it left—as
the Big Game trophy according to an agree
ment made in good faith by two universities.
Retaliations against any persons whom we
may suspect to be now in possession of the
Axe class us as like offenders against the tro
phy's tradition. Admittedly, the story of the
Immortal 21 is the most fun to tell when we're
describing our Axe. But as of 1933, and the
inter-school agreement, the shuttling days of
the Axe were officially over.
Many students feel that the Axe will be
back, come Big-Game time. After all what
good is having the Axe unless one gets the
glory that goes with it? And if it's not back,
we'll have the yell, the rivalry, and what's
important, our first chance in four years to win
from California.
