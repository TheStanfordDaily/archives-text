# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
To The Editor:
As classes begin unci reg lines disappear, we take
this opportunity to thank all those students, faculty,
and staff members who made possible our pre-reg
program.
By far the largest recipients of our appreciation
are the members of the Pre-Reg Committee. They
worked during the summer weeks and cut vacations
short to return to the campus. They met bewildered
l'rush at dusty trains and guided them to their vari
ous destinations. Handicapped by time and funds,
they became "jacks of all trades" before the program
was over.
We will not forget their unending work and in

terest, nor the fun we had together. If you're in
terested in good committeemen, read the names be
low.
