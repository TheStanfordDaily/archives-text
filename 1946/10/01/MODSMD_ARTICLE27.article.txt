It's tryoutee time on the Daily once again and
leetie lrosh are scurrying about the Shack giving
their all to make the ole Daily squad. As usual, the
male members of the staff are leering out of all the
officss to check the "potentialities" of the aspiring
feminine element.
The girls who are the best copyreaders, reporters,
and who have the best legs and stuff will make the
staff as usual.
One small girl wandered into our happy home
over here and for lack of something better to do
began reading the notorious walls of the Shack,
which are covered with many pictures of females in
various stages of dress and undress, appropriately
commented upon in a manner hardly designed for
polite society and faculty teas.
"Oh, dear me," she said as she finished the first
wall and moved on to the second.
"Oh," she said, blushing furiously, and fled into
the night. We haven't seen her since.
It's a shame, too. She had nice legs.

A little old Irishman came up to our long the
other day. &e was interested in hand-sanding and
waxing our floors.
"But isn't that rather a rugged job for one small
man such as yourself?" we asked him. as we all flexed
our 97 pounds and stared down at him, wondering
where he had left Snow White ami the other six.
"Oh, my wife helps me," he explained.
"Even so, isn't it still a pretty large job?" we
asked.
"She's a big red-headed Swede — weighs 204
pounds," this little fellow told us.
We said, "Oh."
"She lifts pianos while I wax under them," he
elaborated. "By the keyboard end.'"
I think he'll get the job. We want to get a look

I
at a woman who can lift pianos by the keyboard
end.

There's a new record out now, which is almost the
surest thing to get banned since Big Jane made "The
Outlaw." It's titled, "Aren't You Kinda Glad We
Did?" and there certainly isn't any double entendre
about it. The meaning of the words is absolutely
clear. It's this type of thing that leads to censorship
of what should ordinarily be unrestricted enterprise
and something that inevitably leads to campaigns
such as the current one now waging against lewd
books.
It's indecent, immoral, and on sale in Paly.

The modern Air Age is indeed with us. The foot
ball special train is now being supplemented with
"football planes." An S.F. travel firm is advertising
an all-expense air special to the Bruin-Indian game
down south on the 12th. Includes round-trip air
transportation both ways, meals, tickets to the game,
and hotel accommodations in L.A.
Wonder if they could get me a date.

One of the sights of the Idaho torch parade was
one of the once-rugged Stanford roughs hoisting his
two-year-old daughter up on his shoulder so she
could "see the parade" when it went by, while his
wife rocked their youngest in a baby carriage at his
side.
All this and a war too.

Sunny afternoon scene: A picnic grove. A Stan
ford man and his lady fair are crossing the glade,
she with a bottle (quart size) of brew, he with a
bag of potato chips. The girl trips and sprawls in
the dust. Our chivalrous hero drops his potato chips,
bends down, and picks up—the beer.
But chivalry is not dead. He split the remainder
of the beer with her.
