## HISTORY 1946 
### 
THE FORGOTTEN MEN
Less than a year and a half after VE Day we have
almost forgotten the nmes of Sauckel, Neurath,
Seiss-Inquart, Kaltenhrunner . . . the names of the
21 top Nazi leaders who are to be sentenced today
by the International War Crimes Tribunal in Nuern
berg.
We have almost forgotten that these 21 led the
bloodiest massacre in history, a massacre that in
cluded the cold-hlooded murder of six million
Jews and uncounted scores of others. We have
almost forgotten the pictures of the concentration
camps, of the gas chambers for the scientific liqui
dation of hundreds at a time, of the freighftyars
filled with bodies.
It is easy to forget unpleasant things.
As humanity's first large-scale attempt to bring
aggressors and mass murderers to justice draws to a
close, there are some favorable and some not so
favorable observations to be made about the trial.
It was outstanding for its fairness—defendants
had the opportunity to select their own lawyers
and to introduce any relevant evidence, the de
fendants were treated well, the defense was given
full knowledge of all documents introduced by the
prosecution. The trial was not a rail-roading.
The prosecution gathered over 700,000 documents.
All those used in the trial are now an authoritative,
unimpeachable record, no longer subject to claims
of falsehood.
Also on the good side is yesterday's decision
finding the SS, SA. Gestapo, and Leadership Corps

I
guilty. The way is now open to the trial of a half
million members of these organizations.
On the unfavorable side is the indication that
three of the gang may escape death sentences. Sig
nificantly, the liberal press expressed fears early in
the trial that Hjalmar Schact would not be executed
because of powerful Anglo-American friends. It will
be interesting to see the tribunal's reasons for going
easy on Papen, the diplomatic organizer of much
Nazi aggression.
Conspicuously absent from the list of defend
ants is industrialist Krupp, officially too ill for
trial (for ten months now) and other top-bracket
German businessmen who first financed Hitler into
power—aided by businessmen in France, England,
and America—and then built his war machinery.
Are these men innocent?
It has often been asked why we bothered with a
trial at all. Why not just line them up aga*inst a wall
and shoot them? Robert H. Jackson, U.S. Chief of
Counsel at Nuernberg, has given a good answer:
If we shot these men without a trial, it would not
be long before assertions arose that there was no
trial because we had insufficient evidence, or because
the 21 were innocent. Furthermore "liquidation by
executive order" would be the method of which these
men are accused.
As the curtain rings down on the Nazi leaders
today let us not forget their acts, let us remember
the misery and death that are the price of Fascism.
For if we forget we may not have a chance to re
member again.
