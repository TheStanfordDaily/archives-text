BERLIN, Sept. 30 (UP). â€”Gen.
Dwight D. Eisenhower today criti
cized the pessimism toward pros
pects of peace that pervades the
world, and said international co-op
eration "is growing and should pro
duce increasing results."
Eisenhower, the Army's chief of
staff, bluntly warned that civiliza
tion could not stand another war.
TOO MUCH PESSIMISM
"There is too much pessimism in
the world today," he said at a press
conference. "Speaking as a soldier,
I believe we can look forward with
more optimism than is reflected in
statements made at home."
He praised Allied co-operation in
Germany and said he believed Rus
sia and France would want to join
the Americans and British in eco
nomic unification of the Reich.
UNITY GROWING
"Every soldier who has been
through the past conflict is looking
forward to the day when intelligent
understanding will put soldiers like
myself out of a job," he said.
"We have evidence that interna
tional co-operation is not a dead is
sue, but is growing and should pro
duce increasing results . . ."
PRAISES POLICY
He said that the American policy
of putting responsibility in the
hands of the Germans and encour
aging a free press seeined to be
paying dividends.
"There is an atmosphere of pro

ductive activity in Germany today
that is encouraging," he said.
Eisenhower praised American
correspondents in Europe for show
ing the determination to report ac
curately. He said the press at home
also has "swung around to take a
commonsense attitude toward the
occupation."
