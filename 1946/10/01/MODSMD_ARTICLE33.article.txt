KLAMATH FALLS, Ore., Sept.
30 (UP). —The purloined U.S. Army
recruiting poster —30 to 36 inches—
was back at its old stand in front of
the post office today, and an editor
scored himself .500 on his guessing
average.
The local newspaper had guessed
that the stolen sign "was taken to
grace some teen-ager's bedroom."
A note that accompanied the re
stored poster said:
"You were right, the sign was in
a teen-ager's bedroom, but you can
have the damn thing back—it's to
big. Don't give the boys credit for
everything—we happen to be girls.
We did it—and we're glad."
