NANKING, China, Sept. 30 (UP).
â€”Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek
formally accepted Gen. George C.
Marshall's plan for simultaneous
meetings of the cease fire and gov
ernment reorganization committees,
it was reliably reported today.
The two committees' refusal to
meet until the other had met and
made known its plans was one of
the major stumbling blocks in re
opening of negotiations toward
peace for China.
Chiang's decision was said to have
been announced at a luncheon party
j this afternoon to which he had in
| vited the highest government offi-
I cials.
The same reliable source added
i that Chiang expressed hope the
Communists would demonstrate
their faith and sincerity this time.
The Nationalist newspaper Hsin
minpao reported the Generalissimo
told Marshall, President Truman's
envoy to China, that Chiang was
prepared to issue a cease-fire order
if the Communists show sincerity to
co-operate.
