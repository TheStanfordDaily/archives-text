Carumba! We ween.
Next week's comments, however,
may well be in a different dialect.
Sunday I battled my way into Ke
zar's press coop (it must be, every
time 1 go there I find an egg on my
seat) to observe a nice quiet little
football gaire.
It wasn't quiet and it wasn't nice.
A little guy named Forrest Hall
made me more nervous than Buddy
Young did beating El Toro's Ma
rines last year. He's good, as you
will see this Saturday p.m. In his
own way he's a triple threat. He
punts, dropkicks and runs.
Mostly he runs. That's his spe
cialty. Clipper Smith puts him in
for one play and he's usually good
for six points. Then he drops
back and dropkicks the extra
point. Then the Clipper takes
him (»ut. It's as simple as all that.
If he stayed in any longer than he
does the man on the scoreboard
would strike for more pay. He'd
rate it, too. But Clipper is a nice
guy. He's got the seventh strongest
team in the country (someone said)
and he don't want to give away any
of its secrets before he has to. So
Hall doesn't play very long—only
long enough to win the game.
They've got some other good
guys on the USF squad. A right
half named Hal Jensen is quite a
ball carrier, and not adverse to go
ing through a hole even if it means
landing on his head. A couple of
other backs to look out for are Har
man Rowe, Vic Pacewic and Bob
Maddalena, the latter two being
fullbacks.
In the line is a boy named Ed Ka
minsky and a grown man who an
swers to Johnny Sanchez. You'll
hear more of them too this week
end. In fact we all may hear too
much about the whole team. They
are good, they're very good. Maybe
they are seventh nationally . . .
we'll see.
One thing I am grateful for is
that we are not playing Nevada.
USF played good enough to beat
the Wolves, and Nevada came
close to dumping 'em. t I'm glad
they didn't; the Uons would be
hard enough to beat as it is.
Anybody wanna give me six
points and either team? I'll take it
(see me Friday). It looks that close
from here.

I see by the paper where Marty
Anderson, A.S.S.U Prexy, track cap
tain, grid star, etc., etc., has been
given the Athei'ton Scholarship for
1946. It couldn't have happened to
a nicer guy. Ditto for Bill Hachten
being spotted by the "Peerless
Picker" as the Injuns best player
for Saturday's game to whom Kee
ble's gives an engraved fountain
pen. Kindly accept our heartiest fe
licitations.
