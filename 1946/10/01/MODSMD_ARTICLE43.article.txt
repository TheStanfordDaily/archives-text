# Humboldt Next for J.Y.
## 
### 
Coach Ed Stamm and his hard
working Junior Varsity footballers
have scheduled four long, hard prac
tice sessions this week in prepara
tion for their game with Humboldt
State Saturday at Areata.
Stamm is going to stress ball car
rying technique and backfield ma
neuvers to iron out the rough spots
in the backfield, while the linemen
will work on blocking finesse, with
plenty of live tackling.
Ankle injuries continue to plague
the jayvees, as first-string halfback
Paul Kent and starting end Jim
Dooley both came out of the Santa
Rosa game limping. Kent may be
out for the rest of the season, and
Dooley may be out of Saturday's
lineup.
Aside from these discouraging
injuries, Stamm was not disappoint
ed with his boys' showing against
Santa Rosa. "Santa Rosa was very
good and had more men ready to
play than we did. Our boys played
a good game, but need a lot of work
yet," confided Stamm.
