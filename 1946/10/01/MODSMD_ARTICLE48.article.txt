# Dickson vs. Branca in First Playoff Test
## 
### 
ST. LOUIS. Sept. 30 (UP).â€”St.
Louis Cardinal Manager Eddie Dyer,
trying not to look worried without
doing a very good job of it, indicated
tonight that he was up against it for
a starting pitcher for tomorrow's
National League playoff opener with
Brooklyn.
Dyer had hoped to lead off with
his ace lefthander, Howie Pollet, in
the first game of the historic three
game series to determine the Na

tional League pennant winner.
"He may he able to go, hut I
won't he ahle to say definitely un- ;
til just before the game," Dyer
said. "But if Howie can't make it,
then it'll he Murry Dickson."
The Dodger starter definitely was
slated to be Ralph Branca, the
speedy young righthander who won
the rubber game of the recent
Brooklyn-St. Louis series in Flat
bush with a 5 to 0 three-hit shutout
