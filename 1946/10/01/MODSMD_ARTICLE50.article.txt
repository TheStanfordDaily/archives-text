up their summer vacations to work

We docked at Gdansk Thursday,
Aug. 8, with 759 of our 789 horses
alive and standing. One of the first
things we noticed upon docking was
that much of the heavy labor of
moving and loading of bales of hay,
branding of horses and herding of
horses was done by women. We
learned later that these women were !
German collaborators and were re- I
quired by the present Communist [
government to do the heavy labor, i
Everywhere was evidence of a )
terrific pounding by bombs and na- j
val shelling. Buildings along the j
waterfront were hardest hit, par
ticularly near the entrance to the
port where a fort withstood an 11-
day pounding by German navy and
air forces at the beginning of the
war.
Across the channel from where
we anchored, a German luxury
liner lay partially submerged. Ev
erywhere that first evening were
silhouetted against the red glow
of the sunset the grotesque ruins
of one of the world's strategically
most important seaports.
The next day, Ray Squide and
myself wandered into Mocoy Port
to see the town. Here we chanced
to make one of the most valuable
contacts we were to make while in
Poland. In a small salvage yard we |
discovered a watchman who could ;
speak English. After talking to him
several minutes we returned to the
ship. Later, in the evening, we went
back to the yard but he had left. A
boy who could speak a little Eiglish
directed us to his home. This was
three rooms in a tenement - type
building where he lived with his
wife, three children, and a 21-year
old girl and het war - orphaned
daughter. We talked until late that
evening with the Bogaskis, and
thereafter we spent many hours in

their home getting to know some
thing of their outlook on life ancj
their standard of living.
Mr. Bogaski, though a laborer, is
well read and "educated." He reads
and speaks Polish, German, English,
French, Spanish, and Russian.
He had read much about the
United States and had many vivid,
though sometimes erroneous, im
pressions of our country. In Po
land he is considered a fortunate
man as he receives a salary of
(>,OOO zloties a month—about $15
in our money. The average work
man receives 2,000 to 4,000 a month
and top pay in the country seems
to be about 8.000. Mr. Bogaski is
quite happy with his present for
tune. as he received but a slice of
bread a day and 500 grams of grits
a month for food under German
and Russian occupation.
We discovered that the Polish
people have a profound hatred of
the Russians—even more so than
for the Germans. While the coun
try suffered heavy bomb damages
from the Germans, the Russians
burned and pillaged as they left the
country and evidently committed
more personal atrocities than the
Nazis. Mr. Bogaski was attacked and
robbed a number of times, and his
wife escaped rape only because of
her advanced pregnancy.

to see the town. Here we chanced
to make one of the most valuable
contacts we were to make while in
Poland. In a small salvage yard we |
discovered a watchman who could ;
speak English. After talking to him
several minutes we returned to the
ship. Later, in the evening, we went
back to the yard but he had left. A
boy who could speak a little Eiglish
directed us to his home. This was
three rooms in a tenement - type
building where he lived with his
wife, three children, and a 21-year
old girl and het war - orphaned
daughter. We talked until late that
evening with the Bogaskis, and
thereafter we spent many hours in

their home getting to know some
thing of their outlook on life ancj
their standard of living.
Mr. Bogaski, though a laborer, is
well read and "educated." He reads
and speaks Polish, German, English,
French, Spanish, and Russian.
He had read much about the
United States and had many vivid,
though sometimes erroneous, im
pressions of our country. In Po
land he is considered a fortunate
man as he receives a salary of
(>,OOO zloties a month—about $15
in our money. The average work
man receives 2,000 to 4,000 a month
and top pay in the country seems
to be about 8.000. Mr. Bogaski is
quite happy with his present for
tune. as he received but a slice of
bread a day and 500 grams of grits
a month for food under German
and Russian occupation.
We discovered that the Polish
people have a profound hatred of
the Russians—even more so than
for the Germans. While the coun
try suffered heavy bomb damages
from the Germans, the Russians
burned and pillaged as they left the
country and evidently committed
more personal atrocities than the
Nazis. Mr. Bogaski was attacked and
robbed a number of times, and his
wife escaped rape only because of
her advanced pregnancy.

We docked at Gdansk Thursday,
Aug. 8, with 759 of our 789 horses
alive and standing. One of the first
things we noticed upon docking was
that much of the heavy labor of
moving and loading of bales of hay,
branding of horses and herding of
horses was done by women. We
learned later that these women were !
German collaborators and were re- I
quired by the present Communist [
government to do the heavy labor, i
Everywhere was evidence of a )
terrific pounding by bombs and na- j
val shelling. Buildings along the j
waterfront were hardest hit, par
ticularly near the entrance to the
port where a fort withstood an 11-
day pounding by German navy and
air forces at the beginning of the
war.
Across the channel from where
we anchored, a German luxury
liner lay partially submerged. Ev
erywhere that first evening were
silhouetted against the red glow
of the sunset the grotesque ruins
of one of the world's strategically
most important seaports.
