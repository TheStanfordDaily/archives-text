PARIS. Sept, .')0 (UP). â€” The
American demand that the principle
of free navigation of the Danube
River be written into all Balkan
peace treaties was accepted 8 to 5
today by the Balkan Economic Com
mission over the loud protests of
Russia.
Sen. Arthur Vandenberg (R.,
Mich.) made his maiden speech be
fore the Peace Conference in pre
senting American demands for in
ternationalization of the river which
is considered to be the most impor
tant single transportation artery in
the economic life of Europe.
The Balkan Commission, under
Big Four orders to halt lengthy
speeches, acted swiftly after Amer
ican and Russian arguments on the
proposal.
Answering the Russian claim that
the problem of the Danube was for
Danubian states alone to settle. Van
denberg said the nations at the
peace treaty must preserve the tra
ditional freedom of the Danube.
