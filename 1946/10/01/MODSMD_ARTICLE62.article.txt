# Two Units Given For Scout Work
## 
### 
Miss Marion Theobald, director of
Girl Scout activities, has announced
that for the first time units will be
given for Girl Scout field work
which will be correlated with Edu
cation 162b given every Wednesday
in room 53 at 7:30 p.m. Two units
will be given for the course.
Since it was not listed in the
schedule of courses, many students
have not had the opportunity to
sign up and Miss Theobald asks
that anyone interested call her at
Palo Alto 6191 before Wednesday at
5 p.m. if she wishes to receive
credit.
There is a great need for such
counseling activities, Miss Theobald
stated, and it is a fine chance for
anyone interested in entering some
phase of counseling for a life's ca
reer.
Veterans' wives are also asked to
participate in this type of work.
