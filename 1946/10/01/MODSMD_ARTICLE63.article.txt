PHOENIX, Ariz., Sept. 30 (UP).â€”
F. E. Mollin, executive secretary of
the American National Livestock
Association, today said there soon
will be more meat on American
tables.
He disagreed, however, with gov
ernment estimates that increased
meat supplies are a matter of weeks,
declaring the increased supply will
not be available until December.
Mollin said the future supply of
meat depends on continued move
ment of livestock to feeder lots in
large numbers.
