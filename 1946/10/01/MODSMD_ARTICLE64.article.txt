## 
### 
SEATTLE, Sept. 30 (UP).—Vio-j
lent North Pacific stonns which
grounded aircraft and "blocked radio
communications raised fears tonight
for safety of the Australia to Ber- i
muda record - seeking Navy plane |
"Truculent Turtle" and her four
man crew.

Navy officials .in Seattle said at
7:45 p.m. (PST) that the last offi
cial word received in Seattle from
the twin - engined patrol bomber
reached here more than 12 hours
ago, when the 29-ton aircraft was
near Midway in the central Pacific.
The Navy here said a "probable
landfall would be made between
(i and 8 p.m. (PST)" along the
West Coast. The Turtle's position,
in its last hourly position report,
was given in latitude and longi
tude and the Navy said it could

not estimate the plane's approxi
mate position.
At noon, EST, almost .'ll hours j
after the take-off, the bomber and
its crew of four Navy fliers and a
mascot kangaroo were certain of
breaking the existing record pro
vided they didn't crash in the
empty seas between Midway Is
land and Seattle.
At that hour, they were 7,000
miles out of Perth, approximately j
1,000 miles short of the mark set by ,
an Army B-29 last November, and
about 800 miles out on the perilous
2.800-mile lap from Midway to the
American coast.
The bomber J»as a cruising
range of more than 13,000 miles
under favorable conditions, and
when it sights Seattle its crew is
expected to decide whether to try
for Bermuda instead of Washing
ton, their original goal.
Barring strong headwinds or me
chanical trouble, the Turtle could |
make the capital, 11,600 miles from
Perth, by 10 a.m., EST, tomorrow; !
and Bermuda, an extra 823 miles, j
four hours later.
Aboard the Lockheed-built plane,
which left Perth at 5:10 a.m. yester
day, were Cmdr. Thomas O. Davies,
Cleveland, O.; Cmdr. W. S. Rcid,
Washington, DC.; Lt. Cmdr. R. H.
Taberling, Jacksonville, Fla.; and 1
Cmdr. E. P. Rankin, Sapulpa, Okla. ■
Davies was listed as chief pilot ,
but his three crewmen are expe
rienced pilots.
