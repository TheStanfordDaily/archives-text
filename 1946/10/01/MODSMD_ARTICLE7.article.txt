# Turks Dump Dardanelles In U.S. Lap
## Russia Demands Share in Control 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 110 (UP).â€”
A high Administration source re
vealed today that Turkey has called
the United States and Great Britain
into consultation in her dispute with
Russia over the Dardanelles. U.S.
Army and Navy leaders will be
asked for their opinion on the mat
ter.
The Turkish appeal came in the
wake of a new and stifT Russian
note demanding that the Turks
share control of the strategic Dar
danelles with the Soviet Union,
and it was learned that America's
answer will he made within a
week.
The United Press* informant said
State Department officials will con
sult with U.S. Army and Navy au
thorities' before sending their reply
to Turkey.
The situation, this source said,
"need not cause undue alarm or
urgency, but it. is undoubtedly se
rious."
He did not elaborate on the Army-
Navy consultations, but presumably
the State Department is seeking ad
vice as to what, if any, measures
the government should take if it
decides to join Turkey in opposing
the Russian demands.
This source said Turkey asked
the two major Western powers for
their opinion on how the Russian
note should he answered, and it
appeared certain that both Amer
ica and Britain would counsel
firm rejection of the Soviet de
mand. \
