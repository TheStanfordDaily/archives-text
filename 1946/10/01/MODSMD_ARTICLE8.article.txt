# OPA Boosts Living Costs
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 30 (UP).â€”
OPA tonight boosted the price of
fats and oils to add another $60,000.-
000 to the nation's annual food bill
as Secretary of Agriculture Clinton
P. Anderson ruled that meat still is
so scarce that it must remain under
price control.
At the same time, OPA jumped ;
the retail price of cotton clothing, |
bod linens and table cloths in a j
sweeping order that further scales
up the cost of living.
The double - barreled move and
Anderson's ruling came close on the j
heels of a prediction by Chairman (
Roy L. Thompson of the price con- I
trol board that the nation will be j
well on the road to scrapping all
price controls if production contin- (
ues to boom for another six months, j
But he cautioned against too hasty !
action in killing off OPA and "all
its irritations and problems," stating
that every segment of the economy
has too much at stake to risk throw- !
ing its safeguards overboard while
they still are needed.
