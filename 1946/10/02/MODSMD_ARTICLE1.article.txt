# Fraternity Position Secure, No Restrictions Foreseen
## Not a Problem Says Tresidder 
### 
Stating that he very much favored
fraternities at Stanford, President
Donald 13. Tresidder told a group
of fraternity men last night to for
get all rumors and gossip that
houses might be restricted or ban
ned from the campus. "Student liv
ing conditions are very much a
part of the educational process,"
said Dr. Tresidder, "and fraternities
now have the opportunity to go be
yond the past, correct mistakes and
blaze new trails in the future."
"I assume every Stanford frater
nity man has a Stanford feeling
which surmounts any fraternity
feeling," Dr. Tresidder told the
meeting, "and because of this I do
not believe that we will ever have
any causc for arguments." Dr. Tre
sidder told the group that he had
heard of the "so-called" fraternity
problem both here and in other
parts of the country, but that most
of the trouble was caused by ru
mors.
"The fraternity problem, if there
is any, is only similar to the rumors
current last spring tht Stanford was
retiring from conference athletics
and nothing more about that has
been heard or is apt to he heard,"
Dr. Tresidder said.
"The fraternities have gained the
admiration of the administration for
the job of rehabilitation which has
been done to open the houses and
Stanford will support the fraterni
ties in the same way that Stanford
will support anything that means
something to Stanford life," Dr.
Tresidder stated.
Dr. Tresidder invited all frater
nity men to feel free to come to see
him or Dean Stalnaker and discuss
any problems which might arise.
