# 'Russia Forced to Arm' General Tells Audience
## 
### 
Making strong and earnest as
surances that the Russian people
avidly desire peace, General Victor
A. YakhontofT of the old Imperial
Russian army told a large Tuesday
Evening Series audience in Memo
rial Hull auditorium last night that
Russia is being forced against her
will to build forces to protect her
self from the outside world.
The retired general, now an au
thor and lecturer, recently returned
from a tour of Russia. Speaking on
the topic, "Soviet Union Revisited,"
he termed his talk a report on what
he had found behind the "imagined"
"iron curtain of censorship" in Rus
sia.
General YakhontofT, a resident of
the United States since 1918, as
sorted that "if we check the war
mongers who are making all the
noise, there must and will he
peace."
Ho stressed that Russia is not
building up armed forces for ag
gression, frankly stating that the
Soviet Union is worried about cur
rent world conditions.
Tlie General said that Russia is
unable to help herself in taking the
path of armament. "The Russian
people hate to waste their time and
energy to build armed forces; it
happened after the lust war and
seems to be necessary again after
this last conflict.
What the General found in Rus
sia added up in his estimation to a
desperate repugnance to war. Doc
umenting his talk with figures, he
cited the 25 million casualties suf
fered by Russia in the last conflict.
Emphasizing that seven million
Russians were killed on the battle
field, that six million houses were
destroyed, and that 50,000 miles of
rail were lost during World War 11,
General YakhontofT sought to por
tray the suffering and losses borne
by the Russian people.
The General described economic
conditions in tlie Soviet Union with
the comment that rationed staples
remained at wartime price levels
until last Sept. I.
He pointed out that reasonable
prices for essential, rationed com
modities have resulted in a surplus
buyink power in the hands of the
peasants. Suiting that, the people
are "well taken care of," he main
tained that there were no signs of
undernourishment.
The General said that there were
indications of a moral setback and
deterioration of order in Moscow.
He explained that this was not un
expected after the strain of the war
years.
