# How One Stanford Senior Solved the Housing Problem
## 
### MARGIE HANSON 
It can be done!
Tangible proof of the fact that i
the veteran's housing problem can |
be solved is a charming four-room
green and white houso at 415 Fer
nando Street, Palo Alto.
01 lie Erickson, senior education
student, and his wife can be justi
fiably proud of their comfortable
home, planned, constructed, and fur
nished by themselves and Mrs. Er
ickson's father and brother. Actual
construction was completed in seven
weeks.
"Truth should be separated from
propaganda and the rumors thai
building materials are unavailable
are propaganda. They are available
if you are willing to spend a little
time in searching for them," Erick
son said.
The new home-owner, who ad
mits that he knew nothing about
building, brought his wife and their j
three-year-old son Michael here in j
January, and while living tempo- [
rarily with friends in San Carlos
worked for a local construction J
company in order to familiarize 1
himself with the city building codes, j
"We bought a lot for $750, ex- i
plained our plan to a local lumber |

dealer, and with a veteran's priority
got the lumber within two weeks.
My wife, an architectural amateur,
drew the plans and blueprints for
a total cost of $1.85," Erickson ex

plained.
Erickson attended Quad classes
from 8 to 12 every morning and
worked on the house afternoons.
With a total investment of $3,000

hikJ plenty <>l "elbow grease" he is
now a home-owner. After obtain
ing his teaching credential he will
sell or lease the house to some Stan
ford student also in a housing pre
dicament.
Son Michael proved a valuable
building asset, according to Ollie. A
dealer was reluctant to sell them
soil pipe for the plumbing until he
saw Michael, whereupon he soft
ened and agreed to "fix them up."
The house measures 24 by 26Va
feet and includes living room, bath,
kitchen, bedroom, and utility room.
Ii is constructed of rustic redwood.
The only outside help was employed
in the wiring.
Ollie, a veteran of three and a half
years with th? Coast Guard, for
merly attended Western Washington
College of Education at Bellingham,
Wash.
"I am impressed with Stanford. I
knew they had an excellent record
I in the education field and that's
why I chose it. It is my opinion that
| if anyone places a high enough val
ue on education he can accomplish
what is sometimes called the im
possible and obtain satisfactory liv
ing quarters," concluded Erickson.
