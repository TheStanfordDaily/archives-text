PREVIEW FOR EXCOM

engineer and former KARM engi
neer, perfected technical details of
the project and has a station trans
mitter on hand. He will describe,

has said that lie "looks with favor
on the proposal to establish a Stan
ford radio station provided it ii
financially feasible and provided it
is part of our student government."
The station charter, similar </>

a manager, advertising director,
program director, and chief engi
neer. It suggests that a Broadcast
ing Council of faculty and students
be formed to guide all campus
broadcasting activity.
