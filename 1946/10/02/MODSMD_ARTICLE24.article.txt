# Edwards Explains Date Applications
## 
### 
One closed fireside is the sole
Saturday night date on the campus
social calendar for this weekend,
according to A.S.S.U. Vice-Presi
dent Millie Edwards.
To encourage prompt and correct
application for dates for the re
mainder of the quarter, she sub
mits the following rules from the
A.S.S.U. constitution:
"Section 1. Dates.
"a. Functions lasting after 8 o'-
clock in the evening must be grant
ed dates by Executive Committee.''
Miss Edwards recommends, how
ever, that all Other functions (be
fore 8 p.m.) be brought to her at
tention in order to juggle and fill
the social calendar.
"j. No Invitations shall be issued,
nor any tickets sold, for any func
tion prior to the granting of the
date therefor by the Executive
Committee.
"g. One o'clock dates shall be
granted only for those functions
which arc to be held on Friday or
Saturday nights, or nights which
immediately precede holidays.
"k. Any organization sponsoring
a fireside must apply for a date no
later than 10 days preceding the
fireside. A fireside may be defined
as an informal function which must
close at 11:30 and is not open to the
campus at large.
