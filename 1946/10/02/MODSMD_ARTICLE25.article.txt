## Radio Station for Stanford? 
### 
Culminating a year of personal effort, two
Stanford students- Bob Heller and Bill Eilers
take before the ASSU Executive Committee
tonight a proposal to establish a student
owned and student-operated radio station on
the Stanford campus.
Development of the station means one
more opportunity for student training in pro
fessional fields—one more useful art to bo
taught" as Leland Stanford desired in this
university. Just as the Daily presents actual
problems to future newspapermen, the Cha
parial to future magazine editors, the Memo
rial Hall stage to future thespians; so the radio
station would offer real life training in all
fields announcing, production, engineering,
script-writing, advertising, acting, and man
agement.
Backers of the project ask a loan of $2,500
from the ASSU to finance the construction and
initial operation. It would seem well worth
the amount since there is a promise that adver
tising receipts would soon place the station
on a self-sustaining basis. The station would
be both an addition and a complement to pres
ent student activities, its efforts being corre
lated with those of the Daily, of various thea
ter groups, and all other campus organizations.
But acceptance of the idea of a station by
Ex Committee does not mean that Stanford's
station will leap full-blown into operation.

Stanford's hudget as set up last spring was
slightly in excess of $8,000 with no provision
for a radio station. Registration and resulting
fees are greater than anticipated but all the
money can not come from ASSU surpluses.
A portion of the backing must come from
improvement funds of other campus organiza
tions with the Dramatic Council as the most
logical backer. The Council could allocate
part of its improvement fund to the station as
well as part of its profits from shows.
These improvement funds are available
only for projects of a permanent nature. Es
tablishment of a station is a large task requir
ing not only the work and sweat of those actu
ally engaged in its construction and operation
but the active and interested support of the
entire student body. Before funds will be
allocated it must be shown there will be per
sons sufficiently interested to take over when
Mr. Heller and Mr. Eilers graduate.
No one will argue that a radio station on
campus would not be a highly valuable asset
to this campus. But its actual establishment
rests not alone on tacit approval by the stu
dents through Ex Committee but by whole
hearted acceptance and support by the stu
dent body in general and actual financial and
personal aid by the Dramatic Council, by Ex
Committee, and other campus organizations in
particular.—F.B.
