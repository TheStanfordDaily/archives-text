# BILL COUGHLIN
## BULL SESSION 
### 
George walked into my office, tossed his brown
112 'lt hat on the desk, settled into the nearest chair,
and propped his feet up on my typewriter.
"Coffee, m'lriend," he said, "I'll have a cigarette."
"I haven't any," I informed him, placing his feet
over on the waste-basket.
He took out on? of his own, allowed me to light
it for him, flicked ashes on my notebook, and calmly
blew a few smoke rings at me.
I waited patiently.
"Coffee,'' he said finally, "something's got lo be
done."
I said nothing.
"This business of the Cellar closing during the
morning has got to go," he said plaintively.
"Trouble, George?" I asked.
"Definitely." He shuffled through my mail and
I hen continued. "First day, after my 9 o'clock, I
strolled up to the Cellar after a cup of coffee in the
old tradition. Walked smack dab into a barred en
trance. Repressed me. Had to spend the hour study
ing."
"So?" I asked.
Campaign," he said. "Blast 'em in your column.
Turn the great power of public opinion against 'em.
Sway the masses."
"George," I explained, "I think they are trying
to open the Cellar during those hours when it is now
closed. They are advertising for hashers. Why don't
you go over and see about a job then?"
Me?" he asked, lifting his eyebrows.
"Sure," I said. "Join Hashers' Local 72.3, Slave
Labor Group 7. and work for the good of the school
and cash in the pocket. Seventy-five cents an hour."
"Hmmph," he said. "Not me." He ground his
cigarette out on my desk, picked up the coke I had

been drinking, and stalked out, slamming the door
behind him.
* * #
"Say," lie said, slicking his head back in the door,
"why don't you blast the Stanford Athletic Council?"
What have they done now?"
''This morning," he pointed out, "half a hundred
people had to stand out in a very, very cold wind
waiting for the Pavilion box office to open so they
could buy tickets to the fotball games. It was sup
posed to open at 8:30 and didn't open until 9:30.
Many people had to leave to make classes. They
might not have been able to get back later and get
their tickets.
"So? " I said, taking my coke back.
"So why don't you suggest that maybe they have
another day on which tickets are available?"
"That," I said coldly, "is none of my business.
They probably have good reasons . . . prior com
mitments on seating and all that." I virged him
gently out the door, and closed it behind him.
"Say," I heard him say to a tryoutee as the door
swung closed.
"Got a cigarette?"

Let me prove to you that this power of the press
which George has so much faith in is no mere fig
ment of the imagination.
The Stanford band at former meetings had only
42 members. So the Daily's fair-haired editor wrote
a powerful, moving editorial. Waved the flag of
patriotism to (lie school, played vigorously upon the
necessity for putting up a good appearance, pleaded
dramatically for a larger turnout.
The band held another meeting Monday night.
The number present? Forty-two.

"So?" I asked.
Campaign," he said. "Blast 'em in your column.
Turn the great power of public opinion against 'em.
Sway the masses."
"George," I explained, "I think they are trying
to open the Cellar during those hours when it is now
closed. They are advertising for hashers. Why don't
you go over and see about a job then?"
Me?" he asked, lifting his eyebrows.
"Sure," I said. "Join Hashers' Local 72.3, Slave
Labor Group 7. and work for the good of the school
and cash in the pocket. Seventy-five cents an hour."
"Hmmph," he said. "Not me." He ground his
cigarette out on my desk, picked up the coke I had

been drinking, and stalked out, slamming the door
behind him.

"Say," lie said, slicking his head back in the door,
"why don't you blast the Stanford Athletic Council?"
What have they done now?"
''This morning," he pointed out, "half a hundred
people had to stand out in a very, very cold wind
waiting for the Pavilion box office to open so they
could buy tickets to the fotball games. It was sup
posed to open at 8:30 and didn't open until 9:30.
Many people had to leave to make classes. They
might not have been able to get back later and get
their tickets.
"So? " I said, taking my coke back.
"So why don't you suggest that maybe they have
another day on which tickets are available?"
"That," I said coldly, "is none of my business.
They probably have good reasons . . . prior com
mitments on seating and all that." I virged him
gently out the door, and closed it behind him.
"Say," I heard him say to a tryoutee as the door
swung closed.
"Got a cigarette?"

Let me prove to you that this power of the press
which George has so much faith in is no mere fig
ment of the imagination.
The Stanford band at former meetings had only
42 members. So the Daily's fair-haired editor wrote
a powerful, moving editorial. Waved the flag of
patriotism to (lie school, played vigorously upon the
necessity for putting up a good appearance, pleaded
dramatically for a larger turnout.
The band held another meeting Monday night.
The number present? Forty-two.
George walked into my office, tossed his brown
112 'lt hat on the desk, settled into the nearest chair,
and propped his feet up on my typewriter.
"Coffee, m'lriend," he said, "I'll have a cigarette."
"I haven't any," I informed him, placing his feet
over on the waste-basket.
He took out on? of his own, allowed me to light
it for him, flicked ashes on my notebook, and calmly
blew a few smoke rings at me.
I waited patiently.
"Coffee,'' he said finally, "something's got lo be
done."
I said nothing.
"This business of the Cellar closing during the
morning has got to go," he said plaintively.
"Trouble, George?" I asked.
"Definitely." He shuffled through my mail and
I hen continued. "First day, after my 9 o'clock, I
strolled up to the Cellar after a cup of coffee in the
old tradition. Walked smack dab into a barred en
trance. Repressed me. Had to spend the hour study
ing."
