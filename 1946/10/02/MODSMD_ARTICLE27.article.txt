## HISTORY 1946 
### 
BACKGROUND TO DANGER
"The city is destroyed. We work in one of the
very few undamaged buildings, the I.G. Farben
building. It is one of the landmarks here."
This seemingly casual sentence in a letter from
Frankfurt, Germany, is a revelation of U.S. foreign
poli«y.
Germany's I.G. Farben was—and is—a gigantic
industrial empire. It was not only the backbone of
the Nazi war machinery, but it aided considerably in
the financing of Hitler before and after 19.Y3.
Yet the Frankfurt headquarters of this network
wasn't touched, although its location makes aerial
recognition inevitable. If this were an isolated case
it might be written off as an accident. But shortly
after V-E Day it was reported that the majority of
I.G. Farben plants were in good operating condition.
They are now, despite our clearly stated promise to
destroy Germany's war potential.
It is clear therefore that the United States gov
ernment deliberately ordered the Air Corps to "go
easy" on I.G. Farben and other companies. We are
still going easy on them. The reason is simple:
Powerful American and British corporations and in
vestors have a financial interest in the welfare of
I.G. Farben. II you are an all-out backer of Byrnes's
policies, remember that he is allowing a strong and
dangerous Germany to rise again and that he is
doing his best to nullify the promise made to the
people during the war: that never again would Ger
many be given the chance to wage war.
It has often been said by many people, including
those who ought to know better, that we have never
had a foreign policy that knew what it was doing.
That is incorrect. Throughout our history we have
bad a remarkably consistent policy, of which the
I.G. Farben case is only a dramatic example. Every
victorious party has continued it, just as British ex
ternal policy goes its bloody way regardless of
whether the government is Socialist or Conservative.

Our foreign policy has almost always been to pro
tect and advance the interests of our powerful indus
trial groups. It has almost never been to protect and
advance the interests of the country as a whole.
We have backed Standard Oil and sent our troops
into other countries because of a drop in the price
of sugar. We let Hitler come to power and let the
people take the consequences when he got out of
hand. We sold scrap iron to Japan because "business
is business" and got it back in finished form.
We leave Franco in power because of U.S. and
British mining, telephone, and railroad interests in
Spain.
We let International Tel. & Tel. finance one of
the leading German aircraft companies and the
money of American investors killed American men.
We pride ourselves on being realistic—connois
seurs of fifty-cent words constantly refer to "real
politik." But it is the realistic, the practical men,
who have bungled consistently, and who, as leaders
in every country, have led the world to war time
after time.
We denounce all those who disagree with our
supposedly practical men as "impractical idealistic
dreamers" without realizing that most of the little
progress humanity has made has been due to "im
practical dreamers." We fail to remember that most
of the leaders in the fight for man's rights, including
the fight for our own much vaunted democracy, were
violently denounced in terms of which "impractical
dreamer" was the mildest.
The policies of the leading nations have not es
sentially changed. England, Russia, and the United
States continue along the same fundamental lines in
their foreign relations as in 1906, 1916, 1926, and
1936. These policies have always meant war. They
will continue to mean war.
Unless the people of the world get statesmen to
speak for them, they will again be forced to .slaugh
ter each other, next time, perhaps, for good.
