# One Meal Costs Week's Wages in Poland--Strain
## 
### ALAN STRAIN 
(Tills is the second of a scries of five articles.)
The people of Poland are in sore need of heavy machinery and techni
cally skilled men. As one Pole said, 'Here i.s nothing but a pile of bricks.
It i.s hard to know where to begin. The people are dreaming—but they
can do nothing." And it seems true that the ruin is so complete and the
task ahead so great that it baffles the people. One sees groups of workers

sweeping the streets or stacking
rubble in neat but useless piles or
just, sitting, apparently not knowing
what to do.
Our second day in port, Mr. Ko
ralevski of the Polish Ministry of
Agriculture took us on a tour of
Gdansk, Sopot, Gdynia, and the
surrounding country and then treat
ed us to a Polish dinner replete
with beer, vodka, and all the trim
mings. We found out later that such
a meal would cost a laborer a full
week's salary.
On the third day (Aug. 10), Ray
Squire and 1 set out for Gdansk.
Here we met a Pole who had lived
at one time in the United States. He
was anxious to practice his English
and so spent part of the day with us.
His father had died a short time
after being forced to leave his farm
by the Germans and his mother had
died in a German work camp.
Needless to say, his bitterness
against the Germans was profound.
Gdansk and Wrzeszcz, which we
visited the same day, were both
deserts of rubble. There were lit
erally miles in which not a single
building was left intact. In all of
downtown Gdansk, there were not
over a dozen shops open for busi
ness. Trade is carried on in open
air markets among the ruins.
A few of the main tram lines are
open now but much of the inter
urban transportation is carried on
by "busses" which are nothing more
than open military trucks with seats
in the back and with an infinite
capacity that puts San Francisco
street cars during the rush hours to
shame.
