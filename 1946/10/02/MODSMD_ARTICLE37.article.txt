## Eyes Right 
### 
The first week-end of the 1946
football season passed into limbo
with a great roar "from the tables
down at Maurie's to the place where
Louie dwells." From beerhall to
poolroom, from Broadway to Mar
ket Street, the rumors are rife and
speculations run high. "UCLA in
the Rose Bowl," "Army number one
in the country," "Penn in the East,"
"54-40 or fight," but what about the
L'il Injin's chances? . . . GREAT!
The story of the Cardinal vic
tory over Idaho was generally
played down by the local and na
tional press. Sportswriters and
professional prognosticates do
not relish commiting themselves
too early in liie season when it
comes to an untried team, miss
ing from the gridiron for three
long years. Come next Monday
morning and they'll all he hopping
on the Stanford bandwagon.
Last Saturday Stanford flaunted
a well - conditioned, excellently
coached and finely integrated scor

end was the power behind the

Murray Prusmack, manager of
the Stanford football team, is still
looking for competent men to be
assistant managers. Everyone in
terested report to room 25 of the

throne. Three deep in reserves; any
and all combinations seemed potent
and able to stop Idaho's offensive,
mousetrap with precision, and blast
holes off tackle, whenever yardage
was needed. Cox. Boensch, August,
et al performed in a manner worthy
of special note. The line must hold
for a "T" to be successful, and hold
it did. Brownson and Devine passed
with comparative impunity. Ander
son, Merriman, Titus and Erickson
showed to good advantage behind
the charging forward wall.
Next Saturday the Red Machine
takes on a Tartar in the form of the
University of San Francisco. The
Dons are coming to town thirsting
for the Indian's scalp and loaded to
the hilt with speed, flashy plays,
and some excellent backs. Hall and
Jensen will be hard to hold in tow.
The Green and Gold ends may prove
more formidable than Idaho's flank
ers in slowing down the Cardinal
offensive, but score we will, and
score they will too. Say . . . 27-20
in favor of the locals. The Stanford
line should eke this one through and
prove the margin of victory.
UCLA at Los Angeles should
prove a little rugged and well sea
soned for the Indian to stomach.
The natural let-up after the Don
game, plus (he trip South, should
leave the Cardinal a little limp,
ragged and 011 the wrong side of
the ledger: 28-14.
Santa Clara goes under the
hatchet, 33-0. USC bounces into the
stadium October 20 only to be
bounced back on their heels in up
set number two for Coach Marchie
Schwartz, 20-14. Oregon State at
Corvallis and Washington bow after
struggles, 3G-13 and 14-0.
Washington State blows in No
vember 10, chilling the stadium and
Stanford's dream of roses in Janu
ary. The Cougars are heavy, smart,
and quite willing and able to knock
dreams and the Cardinals into the
dust 7-13. The Big Game on No
vember 23 is a shoo-in, California
claims disavowed, 28-0.
So I'm out on the limb again?
Maybe. I'm just sitting and hoping
against any sort of unfavorable bolt
from the blue which might prove
disastrous to Stanford, the limb of
the tree and me.
