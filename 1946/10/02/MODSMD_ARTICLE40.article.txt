# Indians Drill Against Don Offset T Formation Plays
## 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
Defensive work against U.S.F. plays was the feature of yes
terday's football practice down in Mosquito Hollow. A team
made up mostly of reserves worked Clipper Smith's offset T
against the first stringers for half an hour, with Don Lipelt dou
bling for flashy Forrest Hall.

The plays—the result of Prof.
Schwartz's little scouting trip to Ke
zar last Sunday—were run-off at
half speed, with the regulars look
ing good on defense. George Quist
and Dave DeSwarte looked especi
ally alert as play diagnosticians. But
—the Dons won't be operating in
slow motion, come game time this
Saturday.
Ed Keblusek, one of the Indians'
better guards, suffered a nose in
jury last night, about five minutes
before quitting time. It isn't known
yet whether or not the injury was
serious.
Another ailing member of the
Cardinal football family is Don Zap
petini, whose game leg has not as
"yet rounded into shape. However,
it wasn't serious enough to keep him
out of the scrimmage with Idaho, so
presumably it won't keep him out
ol' the Don game either.

DON'S LOOK TOUGH
According to all indications, this
j Don game will not be even remotely
I reminiscent of the Vandal fiasco,
j Aside from all the over-sized char
acters manning the front-line
j trenches, there is that terrific back
field. Young -Mr. Forrest Hall gath
: ered most of the plaudits, but he had
three other gentlemen lending yeo
! man aid at all times —three gents
i who are not averse to carrying the
| ball themselves, on occasion.
In addition, there is another left
half who plays ball ior the Dons,
Harmon Rowe. This Rowe follow
(a former Fleet City man, no less),
averaged 12 yards per play for his
efforts. That's right, 12 yards PER
PLAY. Yipe!
Of course one must not forget
Vince Pacewic, who did almost as
well as Mr. Rowe. And Hal Jensen,
another half, who was no slouch
himself. The Dons also have a hb
whose name is Talley Talley. No,
your eyes are not deceiving you.
Talley Twice. I suppose his mid
dle name is also Talley; since his
folks were so economical with the
front monicker, it's not likely they'd
splurge in the middle. Of course his
nickname is '"Ho"; what else could
it be? (Talley is a Scotch name, by
the way.)
PARSONS SNAGS EM
To get back to the Stanfords.
Marchie divided his team for the
first part of the drill and sent his
ends and backs through a light
passing drill. The receivers had to
look back into the sun and thus
dropped several of the tosses, but
Old Sol didn't seem to bother
Freddy Parsons. He looked good in
making several tough catches; on
one occasion the ball should have
been at least 10 yards beyond him,
but he put on a last-second burst
and took it over his shoulder on the
run.
A 1 Morris, one of Marchie's five
(count 'em, five) varsity signal call
ers, has shown vast improvement in
the past few days. His passing look
ed pretty good. He throws a long
spiral with a moderately flat tra
jectory. He hasn't found the range
as yet. but added practice at throw
ing at a moving target should take
care of that.
The final part of the workout was
devoted to dummy scrimmage,
I sharpening up the attack for the
Dons. The dummy scrum lasted un
i til well after dark, and Mosquito
j Hollow's four clusters of lights don't
j do a very efficient job of cutting the
j gloom.
One of the nicest bits of football
j uncovered all day came at the very
1 tail-end of the drill. Lloyd Merri-
I man, wearing a green shirt, raced
' down into the darkest part of the
' field. The passer faded back, drop
\ ped his arm, and cried, "Where's
Lloyd?" Then he spotted the green
. shirt in the murky distance and let
' fly. Lloyd pulled it down over his
1 shoulder on the dead run. The my
; opic eyes of the press couldn't even
; see the ball, but Merriman relayed
it back without stooping to pick
anything up. so it is presumed he
caught it.
