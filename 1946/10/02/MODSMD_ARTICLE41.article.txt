# Humboldt State Awaits Jayvees
## 
### 
Up in the redwood country, where
they grow big football players as
well as big trees, the Humboldt
State Teachers College football team
has big things in store for the visit
ing Stanford Junior Varsity eleven.
Saturday's game between our jay
vees and the northern school marks
ihe first time any Cardinal team has
visited the Humboldt school, and
the Teachers want the visitors to
remember the trip.
In the past the Humboldt's have
never cut much ice on the gridiron
scene, but reports are that they are
loaded this year, and are definitely
pointing for the Indian jayvees.
The jayvees are still woefully
green, but Coach Ed Stamm has two
more practice sessions to iron out
some of the roughest of the rough
spots. Halfback Paul Kent, and end
Jim Dooley are still nursing their
ankles, and may both miss the Sat
urday game.
