# Cardinals Happy, Bums Won't Talk
## 
### 
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 1 (UP).—Cardi
nal spikes chipped a victory rhythm
as they "ya-hooed" into the club
house after today's victory but the
boy at the control board, Howie
Pollet. said "I'm tired, and my back
hurts."
Enos (Country) Slaughter threw
a towel toward Garagiola and yell
ed, "Hi Slugger."
The catcher grinned, "How about
that throw?"
"I like to see those Bums run
when I get that ball," laughed
Slaughter. "Those guys think I'm
getting too old to sling a ball."
Manager Leo (Lippy) Durocher
stuck to his new role of playing
hard to get with the boys in the
press cprps. "No comment, no com
ment," Durocher dirged as the sad
procession of losing Bums trooped
into the clubhouse.
A tight-lipped "Lippy" cut off any
inquiry about who his pitcher would
be in Brooklyn for the second game
Thursday. ,

Joe's first chance came in the
first inning of the game. Willi
Terry Moore. Enos Slaughter and
Whiley Kurowski loading the
liases, two out and all the pres
sure on him, he delivered an in
field hit for the Curds' first score.
The Brooks matched that tally in
the third on Howie Schultz' tower
ing home run into the leftfield
bleachers.
So it was up to Joe and his mates
to do something about it in their
half. They did.
Musial walked with one down to
open the action. He moved to third
on Slaughter's single and scored
while Whitey Kurowski forced
Slaughter at second. Joe delivered
for the second time, singling Kur
owski to second. And Whitey scored
from there a moment later on Harry
Walker's single to give the Cards a
lead they never gave up.
Later Musial greeted Lombardi,
Durocher's fourth hurler, with a
triple to deep right center. It seemed
that he was doomed to stay there, as
both Slaughter and Kurowski failed
to bring him in.
But Joe came through with his
third single against Rube Melton
who went in to pitch to Kurowski,
to score Musial and take the heat
off Pollet.
Durocher and Dyer, the rival
managers in this post-season clam
bake, were uncertain tonight as to
who they'd pitchy in the next con
test, in Brooklyn Thursday.
That game might decide the win
ner of the National League crown.

Slaughter at second. Joe delivered
for the second time, singling Kur
owski to second. And Whitey scored
from there a moment later on Harry
Walker's single to give the Cards a
lead they never gave up.
Later Musial greeted Lombardi,
Durocher's fourth hurler, with a
triple to deep right center. It seemed
that he was doomed to stay there, as
both Slaughter and Kurowski failed
to bring him in.
But Joe came through with his
third single against Rube Melton
who went in to pitch to Kurowski,
to score Musial and take the heat
off Pollet.
Durocher and Dyer, the rival
managers in this post-season clam
bake, were uncertain tonight as to
who they'd pitchy in the next con
test, in Brooklyn Thursday.
That game might decide the win
ner of the National League crown.
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 1 (UP).—Cardi
nal spikes chipped a victory rhythm
as they "ya-hooed" into the club
house after today's victory but the
boy at the control board, Howie
Pollet. said "I'm tired, and my back
hurts."
Enos (Country) Slaughter threw
a towel toward Garagiola and yell
ed, "Hi Slugger."
The catcher grinned, "How about
that throw?"
"I like to see those Bums run
when I get that ball," laughed
Slaughter. "Those guys think I'm
getting too old to sling a ball."
Manager Leo (Lippy) Durocher
stuck to his new role of playing
hard to get with the boys in the
press cprps. "No comment, no com
ment," Durocher dirged as the sad
procession of losing Bums trooped
into the clubhouse.
A tight-lipped "Lippy" cut off any
inquiry about who his pitcher would
be in Brooklyn for the second game
Thursday. ,

Joe's first chance came in the
first inning of the game. Willi
Terry Moore. Enos Slaughter and
Whiley Kurowski loading the
liases, two out and all the pres
sure on him, he delivered an in
field hit for the Curds' first score.
The Brooks matched that tally in
the third on Howie Schultz' tower
ing home run into the leftfield
bleachers.
So it was up to Joe and his mates
to do something about it in their
half. They did.
Musial walked with one down to
open the action. He moved to third
on Slaughter's single and scored
while Whitey Kurowski forced
Slaughter at second. Joe delivered
for the second time, singling Kur
owski to second. And Whitey scored
from there a moment later on Harry
Walker's single to give the Cards a
