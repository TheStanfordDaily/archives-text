Chief Davis announced.
"Any student, faculty or staff
member regularly operating a mo
torized vehicle on the campus after •

permit will be guilty of a traffic vio
lation," he warned.
Special booths will be set up in j

regularly operating an automobile, j
motorcycle, motor scooter, or mo- 1
lorized bicycle on the campus will
be required to register their vehicle
with the Stanford police department
between October 15 and October 31,

"Any student, faculty or staff
member regularly operating a mo
torized vehicle on the campus after •

lation," he warned.
Special booths will be set up in j
