## 
### 
Two plans for a social program
for freshman and transfer women,
to begin this quarter and end before
room drawiny spring quarter, were
suggested at yesterday's Housing
Committee meeting.
Tiiplans will be brought up be
fore Women's Conference and house
meetings Monday before the com
mittee takes any action.
Under the first plan, freshmen
and transfers would be divided into
approximately nine groups, about
two corridors in each group. Up
per class residences would be di
vided into approximately the same
number of groups. Each upper claSs
group would entertain every group
of corridors once on a regulated
schedule throughout the year by
having an after-dinner coffee or
volleyball game. In this way, each
group of new girls would meet girls
in all other living groups before
drawing for next year's room.
Under Plan 11, each new girl
would have four big sisters during
the year, one from Upper Row,
Lower Row, Union Unit, and La
gunita. She would have big sisters
from two areas the first half of the
year, and from the other two areas
the second half.
Upper class women would vol
unteer to be big sisters, taking care
of one or two new girls each. They
would entertain their little sisters
at their convenience, although a
subcommittee of members of all liv
ing groups would plan an enter
tainment schedule so that a group
of big sisters could get together in
entertaining their little sisters.
Suggestions would be given as to
the duties of big sisters. They would
introduce their little sisters to their
friends in their living group area.
Housing Committee voted to have
one representative from Branner on
the committee (preferably a fresh
man this time) as long as it remains
a women's living group. A Floble
freshman will also be appointed to
the committee this quarter.
