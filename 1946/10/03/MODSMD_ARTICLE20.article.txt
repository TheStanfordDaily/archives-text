First news of the Stanford Axe
since it disappeared from its case
in the Cellar last April 28 has been
received in a mysterious commu
nication to the Daily, apparently
from the person or persons who
are now in possession of the Axe. j
The Daily received in the af
ternoon mail an envelope post- I
marked 'San Francisco," contain
ing a photograph of the Axe. Time
of the postmark was midnight of
Sept. 30, last Sunday night.
On the reverse side of the photo,
printed in large crude letters, was
the following message:
"THINK YOU'LL EVER (JET
IT RACK??—MAYRE YOU WILL
WHEN AM) II THE OCC ASION
ARISES—"
The envelope was a plain white
one with no markings or writing j
on it other than the address and
the postmark.
Receipt of the mystery-shroud
ed photo closely followed phone
calls from the Oakland Tribune to
Dr. Donald R. Tresidder and the
Daily's editor, Reth Mac Vicar, re
questing statements 'concerning
the Axe.
Close examination of the photo
showed that the plaque upon
which the Axe is mounted was
apparently resting upon the hack |
bumper of an automobile. Noth- i
ins that could be identified was 1
included in the background seen- ;
cry.
Daily photographers expressed
the opinion that printing of the
picutrc was an amateur <oh rather
er than commercial since the cut
ting of the border around the
print was very uneven. It also
appears that the negative was
printed in such a manner as to
exclude any background scenery
or any person who might have
been holding the plaque.
