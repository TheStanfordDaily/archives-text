## Hallucinations on Housing 
### 
Back again for revision is the social pro
gram set up for freshman and transfer women,
whose purpose it has been to introduce these
women to the types of living accommodations
available on campus and the persons in them.
In spring quaiter on the basis of observations
during the program, women were to choose
the house they would prefer to live in.
Comments received on a housing poll dis
tributed to all Stanford women last spring re
vealed general discontentment over the open
house : ocial policy then on trial. Conducted
on too large and impersonal a scale, the open
houses fizzled out as "too much work," too
much expense and too many places to go for
those being entertained.
Housing Committee apparently feels that
the criticisms were justified, for two new plans
were brought up for discussion and possible
execution at the committee's meeting Tues
day. In outline they are the following:
J) Appointment of big sisters, whose sole
obligation would be introducing little sisters
to the way of life of each house or dormitory.
Each new girl would, during the course of a
year, have four big sisters, one from the upper
Row, lower Row, Union Unit, and Lagunita.
These big sisters, would volunteer to acquaint
now women with the women in their areas,
and with the living groups themselves, on a
basis of personal responsibility and contact.
They would entertain their little sisters at
their convenience, though a subcommittee
with members from all living groups would
plaa an entertainment schedule so that a
group of big sisters could get together with a
group of their little sisters.
2) Freshmen and transfers would be di
vided into groups on the basis of corridors,
and upperclass residences into approximately
the same number of groups. Each upperclass
group would entertain every group of corri
dors once during the year according to a regu
lated schedule so that by room drawing time,
each group of new girls would have met wo
men in all other living groups.
Criticisms of both plans are in order and
alternative plans are encouraged.
Planned, informal parties, with no restric
tions on method of entertainment, would be
the advantage of the second plan. Successful
last year as entertainment undertaken inde
pendently of the social program were a swim
ming pool party, after-dinner volleyball
games, barbecues by the lake, and character
costume parties.
Practical difficulties of the plan must be
worked out before its execution, since com
plete and individual coverage of living groups
would involve parties at least once a week
for both freshmen and those entertaining.

Advocates of plan number one say it
would guarantee acquaintance with the physi
cal assets, governmental set-up, and "way of
life" of each of three categories of living
groups the Row houses, the small Union
units, and the larger dormitories. Plan num
ber two includes in it no such guarantee since
freshman attendance at the proposed parties
would be optional, and after a few parties of
a similar type, attendance would fall off.
There would be no way of offsetting precon
ceived ideas as to which type of living group
is best.
Such parties, unless enlarged beyond com
fortable proportions, would soon become a
hardship through expense and repetition to
both elements. In the final analysis, the fresh
men may have gained only impressions of
different crowds of people without connecting
them with the houses they represent.
Even as worked out by the Committee,
nine parties is the minimum number asked
from each living group.
Plan number one, while in outline satisfac
tory, faces probable break down in operation.
Any acquaintanceship program based on one
freshman's personal contact with four girls is
subject to the laziness, indifference, and per
sonality conflicts of the girls involved. One
woman is not representative of a heteroge
neous group, nor can any measurement be
taken of the amount of friendliness or infor
mation extended to the girls concerned.
A big sister plan works best on a basis of
intimate and unrestricted relationship but less
satisfactorily in a large and geographically
separate group. To mention the probable cries
of "dirty rushing" is superflous under the lot
system, but to mention that women will re
ceive varying degrees of attention is a fact.
New students might become acquainted with
only a restricted group of girls in e,ach area.
Plan one enthusiasts say that the sub-com
mittee would supervise the big sisters and
their duties, and provide, if possible, for
acquaintanceship among big and little sisters
in each area.
Plan number two faces the age-old prob
lem of sustaining originality and enthusiasm
throughout. Few women would deny their
preference, however, to meet others on just
such an informal basis as plan number two
proposes.
Arguments have been presented pro and
con for both plans in hopes that students dis
cussing them in house meetings Monday
night will realize the implications of each
plan. Subject to Women's Conference appro
val, decision on the matter rests with the Hous
ing Committee, whose mandate comes from
the wishes of the women concerned.

Any acquaintanceship program based on one
freshman's personal contact with four girls is
subject to the laziness, indifference, and per
sonality conflicts of the girls involved. One
woman is not representative of a heteroge
neous group, nor can any measurement be
taken of the amount of friendliness or infor
mation extended to the girls concerned.
A big sister plan works best on a basis of
intimate and unrestricted relationship but less
satisfactorily in a large and geographically
separate group. To mention the probable cries
of "dirty rushing" is superflous under the lot
system, but to mention that women will re
ceive varying degrees of attention is a fact.
New students might become acquainted with
only a restricted group of girls in e,ach area.
Plan one enthusiasts say that the sub-com
mittee would supervise the big sisters and
their duties, and provide, if possible, for
acquaintanceship among big and little sisters
in each area.
Plan number two faces the age-old prob
lem of sustaining originality and enthusiasm
throughout. Few women would deny their
preference, however, to meet others on just
such an informal basis as plan number two
proposes.
Arguments have been presented pro and
con for both plans in hopes that students dis
cussing them in house meetings Monday
night will realize the implications of each
plan. Subject to Women's Conference appro
val, decision on the matter rests with the Hous
ing Committee, whose mandate comes from
the wishes of the women concerned.
Back again for revision is the social pro
gram set up for freshman and transfer women,
whose purpose it has been to introduce these
women to the types of living accommodations
available on campus and the persons in them.
In spring quaiter on the basis of observations
during the program, women were to choose
the house they would prefer to live in.
Comments received on a housing poll dis
tributed to all Stanford women last spring re
vealed general discontentment over the open
house : ocial policy then on trial. Conducted
on too large and impersonal a scale, the open
houses fizzled out as "too much work," too
much expense and too many places to go for
those being entertained.
Housing Committee apparently feels that
the criticisms were justified, for two new plans
were brought up for discussion and possible
execution at the committee's meeting Tues
day. In outline they are the following:
J) Appointment of big sisters, whose sole
obligation would be introducing little sisters
to the way of life of each house or dormitory.
Each new girl would, during the course of a
year, have four big sisters, one from the upper
Row, lower Row, Union Unit, and Lagunita.
These big sisters, would volunteer to acquaint
now women with the women in their areas,
and with the living groups themselves, on a
basis of personal responsibility and contact.
They would entertain their little sisters at
their convenience, though a subcommittee
with members from all living groups would
plaa an entertainment schedule so that a
group of big sisters could get together with a
group of their little sisters.
2) Freshmen and transfers would be di
vided into groups on the basis of corridors,
and upperclass residences into approximately
the same number of groups. Each upperclass
group would entertain every group of corri
dors once during the year according to a regu
lated schedule so that by room drawing time,
each group of new girls would have met wo
men in all other living groups.
Criticisms of both plans are in order and
alternative plans are encouraged.
Planned, informal parties, with no restric
tions on method of entertainment, would be
the advantage of the second plan. Successful
last year as entertainment undertaken inde
pendently of the social program were a swim
ming pool party, after-dinner volleyball
games, barbecues by the lake, and character
costume parties.
Practical difficulties of the plan must be
worked out before its execution, since com
plete and individual coverage of living groups
would involve parties at least once a week
for both freshmen and those entertaining.

Advocates of plan number one say it
would guarantee acquaintance with the physi
cal assets, governmental set-up, and "way of
life" of each of three categories of living
groups the Row houses, the small Union
units, and the larger dormitories. Plan num
ber two includes in it no such guarantee since
freshman attendance at the proposed parties
would be optional, and after a few parties of
a similar type, attendance would fall off.
There would be no way of offsetting precon
ceived ideas as to which type of living group
is best.
Such parties, unless enlarged beyond com
fortable proportions, would soon become a
hardship through expense and repetition to
both elements. In the final analysis, the fresh
men may have gained only impressions of
different crowds of people without connecting
them with the houses they represent.

plaa an entertainment schedule so that a
group of big sisters could get together with a
group of their little sisters.
2) Freshmen and transfers would be di
vided into groups on the basis of corridors,
and upperclass residences into approximately
the same number of groups. Each upperclass
group would entertain every group of corri
dors once during the year according to a regu
lated schedule so that by room drawing time,
each group of new girls would have met wo
men in all other living groups.
Criticisms of both plans are in order and
alternative plans are encouraged.
Planned, informal parties, with no restric
tions on method of entertainment, would be
the advantage of the second plan. Successful
last year as entertainment undertaken inde
pendently of the social program were a swim
ming pool party, after-dinner volleyball
games, barbecues by the lake, and character
costume parties.
Practical difficulties of the plan must be
worked out before its execution, since com
plete and individual coverage of living groups
would involve parties at least once a week
for both freshmen and those entertaining.

Advocates of plan number one say it
would guarantee acquaintance with the physi
cal assets, governmental set-up, and "way of
life" of each of three categories of living
groups the Row houses, the small Union
units, and the larger dormitories. Plan num
ber two includes in it no such guarantee since
freshman attendance at the proposed parties
would be optional, and after a few parties of
a similar type, attendance would fall off.
There would be no way of offsetting precon
ceived ideas as to which type of living group
is best.
Such parties, unless enlarged beyond com
fortable proportions, would soon become a
hardship through expense and repetition to
both elements. In the final analysis, the fresh
men may have gained only impressions of
different crowds of people without connecting
them with the houses they represent.
Even as worked out by the Committee,
nine parties is the minimum number asked
from each living group.
Plan number one, while in outline satisfac
tory, faces probable break down in operation.
Any acquaintanceship program based on one
freshman's personal contact with four girls is
subject to the laziness, indifference, and per
sonality conflicts of the girls involved. One
woman is not representative of a heteroge
neous group, nor can any measurement be
taken of the amount of friendliness or infor
mation extended to the girls concerned.
A big sister plan works best on a basis of
intimate and unrestricted relationship but less
satisfactorily in a large and geographically
separate group. To mention the probable cries
of "dirty rushing" is superflous under the lot
system, but to mention that women will re
ceive varying degrees of attention is a fact.
New students might become acquainted with
only a restricted group of girls in e,ach area.
Plan one enthusiasts say that the sub-com
mittee would supervise the big sisters and
their duties, and provide, if possible, for
acquaintanceship among big and little sisters
in each area.
Plan number two faces the age-old prob
lem of sustaining originality and enthusiasm
throughout. Few women would deny their
preference, however, to meet others on just
such an informal basis as plan number two
proposes.
Arguments have been presented pro and
con for both plans in hopes that students dis
cussing them in house meetings Monday
night will realize the implications of each
plan. Subject to Women's Conference appro
val, decision on the matter rests with the Hous
ing Committee, whose mandate comes from
the wishes of the women concerned.
Back again for revision is the social pro
gram set up for freshman and transfer women,
whose purpose it has been to introduce these
women to the types of living accommodations
available on campus and the persons in them.
In spring quaiter on the basis of observations
during the program, women were to choose
the house they would prefer to live in.
Comments received on a housing poll dis
tributed to all Stanford women last spring re
vealed general discontentment over the open
house : ocial policy then on trial. Conducted
on too large and impersonal a scale, the open
houses fizzled out as "too much work," too
much expense and too many places to go for
those being entertained.
Housing Committee apparently feels that
the criticisms were justified, for two new plans
were brought up for discussion and possible
execution at the committee's meeting Tues
day. In outline they are the following:
J) Appointment of big sisters, whose sole
obligation would be introducing little sisters
to the way of life of each house or dormitory.
Each new girl would, during the course of a
year, have four big sisters, one from the upper
Row, lower Row, Union Unit, and Lagunita.
These big sisters, would volunteer to acquaint
now women with the women in their areas,
and with the living groups themselves, on a
basis of personal responsibility and contact.
They would entertain their little sisters at
their convenience, though a subcommittee
with members from all living groups would
plaa an entertainment schedule so that a
group of big sisters could get together with a
group of their little sisters.
2) Freshmen and transfers would be di
vided into groups on the basis of corridors,
and upperclass residences into approximately
the same number of groups. Each upperclass
group would entertain every group of corri
dors once during the year according to a regu
lated schedule so that by room drawing time,

men in all other living groups.
