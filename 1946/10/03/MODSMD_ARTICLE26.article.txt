## BULL SESSION 
### 
The Axe is once again coming into the limelight
after a period ol quiet following its theft last April.
I think the recently received photograph is only a
beginning. From now on, we will probably be re
ceiving pictures of it with almost painful regularity.
But don't be surprised if it turns up in pei7»on at the
Big (lame. .... - '
A small boy appeared in the press box at last Sat
urday's tilt with Idaho and kepi chanting, "Why
don'tcha go get the Axe back?"
Loyal Stanford ites tried hard to ignore him but
lie was a persistent little nuisance. Questioning re
vealed that he was the son ol one of the Farm's Im
mortal 21, whose sensational raid made Stanford
history when they brought the Axe back to the
Indians many years a«o. His interest in the fact that
C'al once again has it was quite personal.
Most Farm students were disappointed in Dr.
Tresidder's statement, as quoted in Monday's Oak
land Tribune, that the Axe is at present as significant
as any other two or three pounds of metal. A famous
object such as the Axe, long a part of Stanford's
history and a factor in the world-famous rivalry
and Big Game with Cal, is far from insignificant. It
ranks right along with the Little Brown Jug of Min
nesota and the Army-Navy feuding as a part ol' the
nation's football traditions.
But perhaps the unnoticed phrase in Dr. Tres
idder's statement was the "at present." For the Pres
idt nt of the University to have come out and stated
that the object, currently in the hands of what are
apparently members of the California student body
in breach ol a signed agreement between the two
schools, was of yreat importance to Stanford would
have created an awkward situation.
With the situation as it stands "at present," it is
not at all unfitting for the top University official to

take a noncommittal stand on the importance of the
Axe. When and if it is once again restored to its
rightful position as a trophy of the Big Game and
a token of the long and traditional rivalry between
(lie two schools, I feel sure that Dr. Tresidder will
ho among the first to agree that its significance is far
niore than that of just "two or three pounds of
.metal. 1 '
The majority of the campus seems to he of the
opinion that Stanford's yell leaders did a fine job at
the Idaho game and made very few mistakes, consid
ering it was the first game of the season and the first
real football game in over three years.
I understand that Rally Com has been chastising
them for failure to use the yells of the "Stow 'em in
the tepee, ugh, ugh" variety. Among them the "Fight
fiercely, struggle, struggle" business and the "Biy
Indian, Little Papoose, etc." complication which is
complete with hand waving et al.
The suggestion has been made that the yells be
given a trial at the Don rally and student body reac
tion to them be noted. I heartily commend this action
to Rally Com.
Can't you just picture the Big Game? . . .
The announcer over a nationwide radio hookup
pauses in his play by play description and says dur
ing a time-out, "Now we tuke you across the field
for a number from the California band . .
ROOTERS CHANTING: "The referee's a sonuva
blank, the referee's a sonuva . .
ANNOUNCER (quickly): Thank you, California
band! And now, ladies and gentlemen, we take you
down for a yell from the Stanford rooting section
STANFORD ROOTERS: "Fight fiercely, struggle,

The Axe is once again coming into the limelight
after a period ol quiet following its theft last April.
I think the recently received photograph is only a
beginning. From now on, we will probably be re

A small boy appeared in the press box at last Sat
urday's tilt with Idaho and kepi chanting, "Why
don'tcha go get the Axe back?"
Loyal Stanford ites tried hard to ignore him but
lie was a persistent little nuisance. Questioning re
vealed that he was the son ol one of the Farm's Im
mortal 21, whose sensational raid made Stanford
history when they brought the Axe back to the
Indians many years a«o. His interest in the fact that
C'al once again has it was quite personal.
Most Farm students were disappointed in Dr.
Tresidder's statement, as quoted in Monday's Oak
land Tribune, that the Axe is at present as significant
as any other two or three pounds of metal. A famous
object such as the Axe, long a part of Stanford's
history and a factor in the world-famous rivalry
and Big Game with Cal, is far from insignificant. It
ranks right along with the Little Brown Jug of Min
nesota and the Army-Navy feuding as a part ol' the
nation's football traditions.
But perhaps the unnoticed phrase in Dr. Tres
idder's statement was the "at present." For the Pres
idt nt of the University to have come out and stated
that the object, currently in the hands of what are
apparently members of the California student body
in breach ol a signed agreement between the two
schools, was of yreat importance to Stanford would
have created an awkward situation.
With the situation as it stands "at present," it is
not at all unfitting for the top University official to

take a noncommittal stand on the importance of the
Axe. When and if it is once again restored to its
rightful position as a trophy of the Big Game and
a token of the long and traditional rivalry between
(lie two schools, I feel sure that Dr. Tresidder will
ho among the first to agree that its significance is far
niore than that of just "two or three pounds of
.metal. 1 '
The majority of the campus seems to he of the
opinion that Stanford's yell leaders did a fine job at
the Idaho game and made very few mistakes, consid
ering it was the first game of the season and the first
real football game in over three years.
I understand that Rally Com has been chastising
them for failure to use the yells of the "Stow 'em in
the tepee, ugh, ugh" variety. Among them the "Fight
fiercely, struggle, struggle" business and the "Biy
Indian, Little Papoose, etc." complication which is
complete with hand waving et al.
The suggestion has been made that the yells be
given a trial at the Don rally and student body reac
tion to them be noted. I heartily commend this action
to Rally Com.
Can't you just picture the Big Game? . . .
