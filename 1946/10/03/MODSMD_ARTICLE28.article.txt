# Village Living Quarters To Be Improved Soon
## 
### 
Because the drain on Stanford
Village facilities has not proven so
great as University officials origi
nally expected, Village residents
soon will be able to enjoy more
comfortable living quarters, Dean
of Students John M. Stalnaker said
yesterday.
"We expect to make readjust
ments in study and living facilities
within the next week or two," Mr.
Stalnaker said. "Once this has been
done, the students will have much
better ' accommodations than we
thought possible."
About 2,300 of the 1j,200 men en
rolled this quarter at Stanford have
been able to find living quarters in
Palo Alto and nearby cities. How
ever, a tremendous demand still
continues for apartments or rooms
with housekeeping facilities for mar
ried students, the Stanford dean
pointed out.
As an interim measure to accom
modate married couples without
children, three buildings at the Vil
lage were assigned for their use.
Intended purely as transient accom
modations, these rooms will be made
available for other purposes in sub
sequent quarters if more adequate
living facilities for married couples
are found.
Boca use of short age of labor and
materials, the Federal Public Hous
ing Authority has been delayed in its
reconversion of a portion of the for
mer Dibble barracks into .'lOO apart
ments for married veteran students.
The first 40 of these apartments will
be completed this week, and the en
tire 300 are scheduled to be occu
pied by Feb. 1.
All 300 apartments were assigned

to student couples prior to the
opening of fall quarter. Screening
pf the applicants from the long
waiting list on file in the Dean of
Students' office was handled on a :
priority and hardship basis.
"We anticipate that next quarter
there will be a greater demand for
living facilities at the Village," Dean
Stalnaker said. "We are confident
that when students actually see and
experience the quality of the Vil
lage accommodations, they will be
very favorably disposed toward
them."
