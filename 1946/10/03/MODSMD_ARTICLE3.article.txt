# Strangers Barred At Card Drills
## 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
Something new came to the Farm
yesterday when Prof. Marchic
Schwartz called a semi-secret prac
tice. It wasn't secret, because any
one with a student body card or* an
alumni card could walk right into
Mosquito Hollow. The coming game
shapes up as a make-or-break af- j
fair, and he doesn't want his charges !
bothered by too many alien kibitz
ers.
Jim C<»x, the rugged starting right j
tackle, will be named as game cap- |
tain this afternoon. He takes over j
from companion-tackle Fred Boen
sch, who guided the Cardinal forces |
against Idaho.
Assembly line methods have been

Yes, Murray I'rusmack is si ill
looking for assistant grid mana
gers. Strong ones who can lift
dummies—or at least drag them,
lie promises lo treat them kindly,
.inst like a flock of long-lost broth
ers.
Any young hull-shouldered ap
plicants will he welcomed by
I'rusmack with open arms. They
can eat their (ill at the varsity's
(raining (able seven nights a week,
and (here are also (rips (o Ivos An
geles and Corvallis in the offing.
Call at room 25, S.A.C., or report
to (he anxious Mr. Prusmack on

devised in order to net in the maxi
mum amount of work before Satur
day. The squad was divided into
two parts, with the first team work
ing against USF plays at one end of
the field. Meanwhile the rest were
sharpening up the Stanford attack
by running plays in dummy scrim
mage. Later the potential starters
moved down to practice their of
lense while a second team boned up
on how to stop the Don attack.
One of San Francisco's after
noon sports scribes has sent a
public warning to Prof. Schwartz
labeled. "TIP TO MARCHIE:
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN REAL
USF ATTACK YET." He goes on
(o relate how Clipper Smith has
umpstccn plays up his sleeve (ha(
he didn't show against Nevada,
each one trickier than the next.
All of this is doubtlessly true; it
would be a pretty strange situation
if it weren't. No good football coach
has ever tipped his entire hand in a
first game—no matter how tough—if
for no other reason than that a good

coach keeps on working out tricky
! plays all season long. He can't show
everything in the first game, be
cause he doesn't know everything
| himself.
Now Marchie Schwartz is a good
| coach (that's being conservative),
and he also knows that Maurice J.
! Smith is a good coach. So it seems
that the warning, well-meaning
I though it was, is really not neces
j sary.
Since Prof. Schwartz is not in the
habit of taking the press (amateur
or professional) into his innermost
| thoughts, your favorite peninsula
daily can't tell you about his plans.
But, since he is a GOOD coach,
there is little reason to believe that
he spends his time snoozing, with
his brogans up on the desk.
These Dons—rated seventh na
tionally—may he just that tough.
They have a terrific aggregation
of stars. U. S. Grant (allegedly
carrying the blood of the renown
ed general in his veins) was good
enough to make an all-service
eleven while playing for the Sev
enth Air Force —hut he is gather
ing splinters on the Don bench
these week-ends. In case you
haven't heard, the San Francis
cans have a couple of moderately
fjiir left halfbacks named Ilowe
and Hall.
Unfortunately for the young scion
; of the Grant family, he also is a left
halfback. It seems an awful waste
of talent. With his family back
i ground he should be a qb. The orig
! inal U. S. Grant was quite a signal
: caller himself.
The Stanfords looked pretty good
catching and throwing passes yes
terday, with all hands sharing in
the plaudits. An observer can't tell
from a dummy scrimmage whether
the ground attack is going to work
or not; after all, the dummies don't
do any tackling.
Ed Keblusek, whose nose was
dented at the previous session, was
back at the old stand—in a bird
cage—and as full of drive as ever.
FT is ball-hawking abilities may be
in great demand, come Saturday.

All of this is doubtlessly true; it
would be a pretty strange situation
if it weren't. No good football coach
has ever tipped his entire hand in a
first game—no matter how tough—if
for no other reason than that a good

coach keeps on working out tricky
! plays all season long. He can't show
everything in the first game, be
cause he doesn't know everything
| himself.
Now Marchie Schwartz is a good
| coach (that's being conservative),
and he also knows that Maurice J.
! Smith is a good coach. So it seems
that the warning, well-meaning
I though it was, is really not neces
j sary.
Since Prof. Schwartz is not in the
habit of taking the press (amateur
or professional) into his innermost
| thoughts, your favorite peninsula
daily can't tell you about his plans.
But, since he is a GOOD coach,
there is little reason to believe that
he spends his time snoozing, with
his brogans up on the desk.
These Dons—rated seventh na
tionally—may he just that tough.
They have a terrific aggregation
of stars. U. S. Grant (allegedly

haven't heard, the San Francis
cans have a couple of moderately
fjiir left halfbacks named Ilowe
and Hall.
Unfortunately for the young scion
; of the Grant family, he also is a left
halfback. It seems an awful waste
of talent. With his family back

Something new came to the Farm
yesterday when Prof. Marchic
Schwartz called a semi-secret prac
tice. It wasn't secret, because any
one with a student body card or* an
alumni card could walk right into
Mosquito Hollow. The coming game
shapes up as a make-or-break af- j
fair, and he doesn't want his charges !
bothered by too many alien kibitz
ers.
Jim C<»x, the rugged starting right j
tackle, will be named as game cap- |
tain this afternoon. He takes over j
from companion-tackle Fred Boen
sch, who guided the Cardinal forces |
against Idaho.

Yes, Murray I'rusmack is si ill

gers. Strong ones who can lift

ers.

Call at room 25, S.A.C., or report
to (he anxious Mr. Prusmack on
(lie practice field after 5 p.m.

devised in order to net in the maxi
mum amount of work before Satur
day. The squad was divided into
two parts, with the first team work
ing against USF plays at one end of
the field. Meanwhile the rest were
sharpening up the Stanford attack
by running plays in dummy scrim
mage. Later the potential starters
moved down to practice their of
lense while a second team boned up
on how to stop the Don attack.
One of San Francisco's after
noon sports scribes has sent a
public warning to Prof. Schwartz
labeled. "TIP TO MARCHIE:
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN REAL
USF ATTACK YET." He goes on
(o relate how Clipper Smith has
umpstccn plays up his sleeve (ha(
he didn't show against Nevada,
each one trickier than the next.
All of this is doubtlessly true; it
would be a pretty strange situation
if it weren't. No good football coach
has ever tipped his entire hand in a
first game—no matter how tough—if
for no other reason than that a good

coach keeps on working out tricky
! plays all season long. He can't show
everything in the first game, be
cause he doesn't know everything
| himself.
Now Marchie Schwartz is a good
| coach (that's being conservative),
and he also knows that Maurice J.
! Smith is a good coach. So it seems
that the warning, well-meaning
I though it was, is really not neces
j sary.
Since Prof. Schwartz is not in the
habit of taking the press (amateur
or professional) into his innermost
| thoughts, your favorite peninsula
daily can't tell you about his plans.
But, since he is a GOOD coach,
there is little reason to believe that
he spends his time snoozing, with
his brogans up on the desk.
These Dons—rated seventh na
tionally—may he just that tough.
They have a terrific aggregation
of stars. U. S. Grant (allegedly
carrying the blood of the renown
ed general in his veins) was good
enough to make an all-service
eleven while playing for the Sev
enth Air Force —hut he is gather
ing splinters on the Don bench
these week-ends. In case you
haven't heard, the San Francis
cans have a couple of moderately
fjiir left halfbacks named Ilowe
and Hall.
