Last night an institution that is
lore of a stranger on the Farm than
11 any other gridiron camp was in
/oked by Head Coach Marchie
Schwartz. Said institution being the
secret practice.
It wasn't exactly a secret practice,
inasmuch as all you needed to filter
by manager Freddie Wentz was
either a student-body card or an
alumni card, or a fast line of chatter
like a I lolly wood reporter should
sport.
A handful of supporters, loyal un
til death by mosquito bites becomes
a stark reality, did show up to cheer
our boys on, but were vastly out
numbered by the four local corre
spondents of varied presses.
Marchie played it wise by mak
ing il only a semi-secret drill
(can't tell you what it's all about
on pain of death), thereby saving
himself from a fate once suffered
by Stanford's "(irand Old Man''
of (he grid, (*lenn S. (Pop) War
ner.
Back in the old days of the double
wing (that was before a lot of frosh
now among the assembled were yet
to be born) Pop decided to hold a
"secret practice" and so informed
Publicity Manager Don Liebendor
fer. Strict instructions were given
out to the public about denying visi
tors entrance.
"How about the newspapermen?"
"Naw, there's nothing for them to
see." "How about me?" "Naw,
there's nothing there for you to see
either." So nobody went to the
practice.
Now the newspapermen have cu
rious habits during football season.
Football rates a lot of inches and to
write it you have to have the news.
And so you go to the men who
know; the publicity man and the
coaches. But usually the publicity
man does it; talking to 'em each for
at least half an hour.
The night of the "secret ses
sion," (he scribes called up Don,
as per usual, for info on (he day's
happenings on the local grid. But
Don didn't know. "Call lip I'op,
he knows," he tells the boys from
the big city. And they did.
It was supper time at the Warner
manse and Pop was set to consume
the soup. The phone rang. When
Pop got through with the guy on
the other end and hung up it rang
again. And so on for quite a length
of time. The soup got cold, the roast
turned into something that looked
like corned beef hash and Mrs. War
ner was quite perturbed by the
whole thing.
The next day Pop wandered into
Don's office. "Uh, I think, maybe
you belter come out to the practices
after this. Oh yes, the newspaper- j
men can come too."

It is doul)(ful if there will be a
dog-on-lhe-lield Ibis Saturday.
Last week. JVI. Liebendorfer was
queried as to whether he was
conducting tryouts for DOTF.
lie could have been; (he place
was crawling wi(h pooches—set
(ers. poodles, spaniels and a ratty
looking individual of douh(ful
parentage. Don claimed he was
not, and to prove it no dog showed
up for the Vandal vanquishing.
Maybe it's because Will Connolly
wasn't down for the game. He's not
coining down this week, either, so
don't be on the lookout for any stray
canines. He did attend the USF-
Nevacla activities Sunday at Kezar
and sure enough a mutt waddled
out on the turf. Just about half
lime a dachshund came out of the
west-end tunnel, took to the field
about "fifteen yards from the south
.sideline" and, following his nose,
went to the other end of the field
where he was escorted away by a
policeman.
As one man, the pressbox—with
(he exception of Flee( Admiral !
Ilalscy, who didn't know what the
situation was—arose and chanted: |
"Iley Will, there's your dog." Mr.
C look it like the animal lover he
is.

Wednesday, the Daily ran a blurb
about manager Murry Prusmack
seeking assistants. Two characters !
showed up for afternoon practice, j
were greeted like long-lost relatives j
and put to work. Their first job |
was to tote some blocking dummies
onto the field.
"What, pick those things up?
Don't be silly; if I could carry one
of those I'd go out for football."
Moral; start out new managers by
having them carry ONE football.
