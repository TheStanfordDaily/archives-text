# Dodgers Try Again Today
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 2 (UP)—The
embattled Brooklyn Dodgers, sag
ging familiarly but undauntedly in
to the ropes again, came hopefully
home to lucky Ebbets Field tonight
facing "sudden death" at the hands
of the St. Louis Cardinals in the Na
tional League's first pennant play
off.
Sent down to a 4 to 2 defeat in the
opening tilt of the history-making
three-game series, the fercious gen
tlemen were faced with the gloomy
prospect of sweeping the remaining
two games.
They will, however, be 4 to 5 un
derdogs as they attempt to square
the series at one all tomorrow. And,
with the right to meet the Boston
Red Sox for World Series gold and
glory riding on every pitch, the be
loved Bums were 1 (o 3 in the bet
ting against winning a pair.
But the Flatbush faithful had
n't given up. They were count
ing on the "Luck of Ebhets Field,"
the gallant comeback ability
I which their Bums have shown so
often in this hectic stretch race,
and (he strong left arm of a sailor
! home from the seas.
For it will be rookie Joe Hatten,
i a slim young veteran of 10 months'
j sea duty, carrying Dodger hopes
against Harry (The Cat) Brecheen,
J left-handed Cardinal ace from Bro-
I ken Bow, Okla., as they tangle in a
game which can square it up or
send St. Louis into the series.
Hatten, 29-year-old rookie from
Bancroft, lowa, has beaten the Car
dinals only twice in six attempts this
season. But the slim southpaw with
the smoking fast ball has gone the
route against them twice while Bre
cheen never has lasted the distance
against the Dodgers.
The last and only time they met,
Hatten went all the way to win a
4 to 2 victory the Dodgers pray
was prophetic. He beat them once
again, with help, hut lost four oth
ers in which only one was close.
Brecheen, with the experience of
two World Series behind him, scor
ed twice over Brooklyn this season
and was beaten three times.

the gallant comeback ability
I which their Bums have shown so
often in this hectic stretch race,
and (he strong left arm of a sailor
! home from the seas.
For it will be rookie Joe Hatten,
i a slim young veteran of 10 months'
j sea duty, carrying Dodger hopes
against Harry (The Cat) Brecheen,
J left-handed Cardinal ace from Bro-
I ken Bow, Okla., as they tangle in a
game which can square it up or
send St. Louis into the series.
Hatten, 29-year-old rookie from
Bancroft, lowa, has beaten the Car
dinals only twice in six attempts this
season. But the slim southpaw with
the smoking fast ball has gone the
route against them twice while Bre
cheen never has lasted the distance
against the Dodgers.
The last and only time they met,
Hatten went all the way to win a
4 to 2 victory the Dodgers pray
was prophetic. He beat them once
again, with help, hut lost four oth
ers in which only one was close.
Brecheen, with the experience of
two World Series behind him, scor
ed twice over Brooklyn this season
and was beaten three times.
