LOS ANGELES. Oct. 2 (UP).— .
Forty-one UCLA Bruins entrained
northward tonight for a workout to
morrow iit the Berkeley campus of j
the University of California en route
to Seattle for Saturday's game with
Washington. The Bruins tapered off
today with a light scrimmage and j
were cheered by forecasts for clear
weather »t Seattle.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 2 (UP).—
Southern California worked offen
sively and defensively in scrimmage
today for Saturday's interseetional
encounter with Ohio State, desig
nated as Howard Jones memorial
game in honor of the late Trojan
coach. Ohio State will arrive Friday
morning by plane and engage in an
afternoon drill.

SEATTLE, Oct. 2 (UP).—Coach
Ralph Welch indicated today Larry
Hatch, 190-pound halfback, may get
a starting call when the University
of Washington Huskies go into ac
tion here Saturday against the Uni
versity of Southern California.
Welch pushed his players through
a tough scrimmage and started
building a defense for the Bruin at
| tack and when he selected his var-
I sity for the drill he moved Hatch in
j to the lefthalf position. The rest of
; the backfield setup appeared to be
j Dick King, righthalf; Arnie Wein
| meister at fullback, and Dick Ottelle
at quarterback.

PULLMAN, Wash., Oct. 2 (UP).—
Washington State College Cougars'
hopes of victory over the University
of Idaho Vandiils at Moscow Satur
day were struck a blow today when
Coach Phil Sorboe announced two
regulars would be missing from the
starting lineup.
Sorboe said Jon Munlux, a hard
running fullback, suffered a knee
injury in the game against Southern
California last Saturday, and John
Wright, veteran tackle, injured ear
lier in the season, was hurt again in
j scrimmage yesterday.

SANTA CLARA, Oct. 2 (UP).—
Vernon Hare, University of Santa
Clara's first-string halfback, will be
out of action for Saturday's Ne
vada contest—partly due to a con
cussion suffered during practice,
and partly to the shock of becom
ing a father.
H.ire, whose wife in Spokane,
Wash., today presented him with a
six-pound baby girl, already was en
route north to bounce his offspring
on his knee while his teammates
meet the Nevada Wolfpack.
Hare is the first athlete-father in
| the University's history in view of a
previous school ban against student
marriage.
His place in the lineup will be
temporarily taken over by Bill
Prentice.
