# Strain Sees Peace-Torn Poland

### ALAN STRAIN 
(This is the third in a series of
live articles.)
On our way back to the ship one i
afternoon, our tram was stopped and j
a boy who look to be 16 or 18 years '
old and dressed in the military uni- j
form of the "secret police" swung I
aboard wielding u submachine gun.
At our stop we got ofF and almost I
bumped into more men carrying j
machine guns. There we saw the |
body of a man lying awkwardly in |
the road partially covered by a bur
lap sack. About this time the ship
began to look pretty good to us and J
we made tracks for "home."
POLISH STRIKE SMASHED
Back on board we heard from
shipmates that there had been a
wild strike of some sort by the dock
workers who had refused to con
tinue unloading several ships—ours
among them. The picture was all [
pretty confused and there were j
many stories about what had hap- ;
pened and the numbers killed. One |
of the stories was that it was an
unorganized affair hastily called in
sympathy with one of the workers ;
house by the Communists. Four- i
teen, it was said, had been killed.
During the rest of our stay, the 1
town was continually patrolled by j
armed secret police and several !
truckloads of arrested men left the !
city for parts unknown.
cigar ettes valued
During our stay, our ship was
overrun by armed Polish guards—
special police and soldiers. Every
where on shipboard and in the j
towns we visited people had things I
to sell—especially binoculars, cam- j
eras,' and souvenir knives. Although
monetary eehange rates are favor- |
able to us, the real currency of the j
country is cigarettes. While a few j
of us did not • deal in cigarettes,
almost everyone aboard ship did. I
Over half the crew purchased cam- j
eras or binoculars with them. On 1
the black market a carton of cigar- j

ettes is worth 2,000 zloties, and our
men were getting as high as 1,500
zloties aboard ship (400 zloties j
equals about $1).
REPATRIATION CENTER
Food which we brought over to !
distribute was taken to a repatria- !
tion center near Gdynia where we |
saw some of the most miserable
specimens of humanity we had ever ;
seen. The food was certainly need- ;
ed here, but our little could not pos

sibly begin to meet the need. There
were about 200 families there await
ing relocation.
There is a turn-over once every
week or so as these move on and
others come in. For the most part,
these people had no possessions
whatsoever. We can't begin to real
ize how full our lives are compared
to the lives of some of these—at
least in terms of material things.
