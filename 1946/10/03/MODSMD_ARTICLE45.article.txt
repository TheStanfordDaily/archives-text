## 
### 
Pat Anderson, chairman of the
Foreign Students Committee of the
Y.W.C.A., asks that all students
from foreign countries call her at
8709 if they are interested in join
ins this organization.
This committee will endeavor to
acquaint such students with campus
functions and activities, and help
them as much as possible over the
difficult, hurdles that they face in
attending a school in a strange
country.
Programs, teas, speakers, and
various other functions are being
planned plus affiliation with Palo
Alto community groups.
The committee is composed of
Miss Anderson as chairman, Joanne
Whittier, Eddy Ullman, and Jody
Gie.se. Miss Anderson has not yet
received enough help on this com
mittee, and she asks that anyone
interested in becoming a member
get in touch with her.
