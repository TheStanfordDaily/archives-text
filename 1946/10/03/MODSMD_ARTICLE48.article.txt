### LARRY FRANKLEY GEORGE ECKSTEIN 
j Having recently returned from
three months in Los Angeles, we
1 have had quite a bit of musicdom
1 at our reach. The ballroom compe
| tition has resulted in the simultane
i oils appearance in Los Angeles of
every big name band in the coun
! try—well, almost every one.
This ballroom competition is a
j problem which probably only Los
Angeles faces. Such places as the
Palladium, the Aragon, the Avadon,
the Trianon, the Meadowbrook. and
the Casino Gardens have to employ
top-name bands in order to keep
up with the rest. This, of course,
has resulted in a surplus of good
music for the City of the Eternal
Sunshine. During the summer such
bands were on hand as Woody Her
man, Duke Ellington, Boyd Rae
burn, Stan Kenton, Les Brown,
j Lionel Hampton, Tex Benecke, and
! the always present Freddy Martin
j —to name only a few.
SMALL COMBOS CLICK
Even the small instrumental
i groups have been flourishing in the
j Southern California climate. A lo
cal group, the Vivian Garry Trio,
has been receiving a lot of publicity,
due mostly to the exceptional guitar
work of Arv Garrison. Eddie Hey
wood, Les Paul, Red Callendar, Ray
Bauduc, Edgar Hayes, and Tommy
Todd and their units have also been
in town. Slim Gaillard in still do
ing wonderfully, thank you.
WAXINGS OF THE WEIK
In continuation of their "re-issue"
policy, Columbia has made avail
; able the reeord-of-the-week from
their backlog of Goodman masters.
This particular disc is taken from
j that era when the "Kin* of Swing"

spotlighted Cootie Williams and
Georgie Auld as instrumentalists
and Helen Forrest as vocalist. The
tunes are "Nobody,* with a very
fine Forrest treatment (quite differ
ent from her present style), and
"Henderson Stomp," a Fletcher
Henderson original (natch!) featur
ing the .sparkling clarinet of Mr.
Goodman.
Along the re-issue line, Columbia
is presenting one more of its origi
nal Hot Jazz Classics Albums. This
one is an album featuring Fletcher
Henderson and his orchestra when
"Smack" starred such soloists as
Coleman Hawkins, Rex Stewart,
Louis Armstrong, Jimmy Harrison,
Don Redman, Charlie "Big" Green,
and Buster Bailey. Any "hot" col
lector will be interested in hearing
from what source the present "big
band" stemmed.
CAPJTOL EFFORTS
Capitol's effort for the week are
two rather poor platters featuring
the vocalists Peggy Lee and Jesse
Price. Peggy's disc, "Aren't You
Kinda Glad We Did?" '(she doesn't
mention what she "did*") and "It's
All Over Now," is disappointing in
many ways—especially the rather
hackneyed scoring that seems to be
employed on all Lee shellackings.
Peggy's voice and Dave Barbour's
accompanying guitar are both rest
ful as usual.
Jesse Price, a well-known Kan
sas City drummer, struggles through
two blues which will be popular in
the low-class entertainment spots
around the country. Boring, dull,
and stereotyped—these are all good
adjectives for this record.
However, for the most satisfying
shellacking of the week "The Idaho
Game" tops the list. The tune is
an original by Marchie Schwartz,
and it was played by Leland Stan
ford and his 48 Indians.

Even the small instrumental
i groups have been flourishing in the
j Southern California climate. A lo
cal group, the Vivian Garry Trio,
has been receiving a lot of publicity,
due mostly to the exceptional guitar
work of Arv Garrison. Eddie Hey

Bauduc, Edgar Hayes, and Tommy
Todd and their units have also been

WAXINGS OF THE WEIK
In continuation of their "re-issue"
policy, Columbia has made avail
; able the reeord-of-the-week from
their backlog of Goodman masters.
This particular disc is taken from
j that era when the "Kin* of Swing"

spotlighted Cootie Williams and
Georgie Auld as instrumentalists
and Helen Forrest as vocalist. The
tunes are "Nobody,* with a very
fine Forrest treatment (quite differ
ent from her present style), and
"Henderson Stomp," a Fletcher
Henderson original (natch!) featur
ing the .sparkling clarinet of Mr.
Goodman.
Along the re-issue line, Columbia
is presenting one more of its origi
nal Hot Jazz Classics Albums. This
one is an album featuring Fletcher
Henderson and his orchestra when
"Smack" starred such soloists as
Coleman Hawkins, Rex Stewart,
Louis Armstrong, Jimmy Harrison,
Don Redman, Charlie "Big" Green,
and Buster Bailey. Any "hot" col
lector will be interested in hearing
from what source the present "big
band" stemmed.
CAPJTOL EFFORTS
Capitol's effort for the week are
two rather poor platters featuring
the vocalists Peggy Lee and Jesse
Price. Peggy's disc, "Aren't You
Kinda Glad We Did?" '(she doesn't
mention what she "did*") and "It's
All Over Now," is disappointing in
many ways—especially the rather
hackneyed scoring that seems to be
employed on all Lee shellackings.
Peggy's voice and Dave Barbour's
accompanying guitar are both rest
ful as usual.
Jesse Price, a well-known Kan
sas City drummer, struggles through
two blues which will be popular in
the low-class entertainment spots
around the country. Boring, dull,
and stereotyped—these are all good
adjectives for this record.
However, for the most satisfying
shellacking of the week "The Idaho
Game" tops the list. The tune is
an original by Marchie Schwartz,
and it was played by Leland Stan
ford and his 48 Indians.
j Having recently returned from
three months in Los Angeles, we
1 have had quite a bit of musicdom
1 at our reach. The ballroom compe
| tition has resulted in the simultane
i oils appearance in Los Angeles of
every big name band in the coun
! try—well, almost every one.
This ballroom competition is a
j problem which probably only Los
Angeles faces. Such places as the
Palladium, the Aragon, the Avadon,
the Trianon, the Meadowbrook. and
the Casino Gardens have to employ
top-name bands in order to keep
up with the rest. This, of course,
has resulted in a surplus of good
music for the City of the Eternal
Sunshine. During the summer such
bands were on hand as Woody Her
man, Duke Ellington, Boyd Rae
burn, Stan Kenton, Les Brown,
j Lionel Hampton, Tex Benecke, and
! the always present Freddy Martin
j —to name only a few.
