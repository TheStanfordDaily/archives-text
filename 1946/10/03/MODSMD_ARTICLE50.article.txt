# Irate Husband Baffles Rough

### MARY KRAFT 
A new problem now confronts
the ever-growing stag line of
Stanford roughsâ€”or so a certain
Injun who was at the Lag opeu
house last week can testify.
When he cut in on one of the
prettier girls, he was informed in
no uncertain terms to hring her
hack quickly because she hap
pened to be the gentleman's wife!
Whereupon the irate husband
proceeded to glare at the dancing
couple, glancing at his watch ev
ery few seconds until his missus
was returned.
