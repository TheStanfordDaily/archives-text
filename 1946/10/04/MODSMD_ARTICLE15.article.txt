# High Score Thriller Predicted for Tangle With Dons Tomorrow
## Hall, Jensen to Test Red Line In Saturday's Grid Encounter; Cardinal Machine Favored 10 to 7

Tomorrow we'll know. About five o'clock tomorrow after
noon all interested parties will know whether Stanford has a good
team, a fair team, or just another aggregation of nice boys who
1 like to play football. The betting marts in the big city are favor
ing Stanford at odds of 10 to 7, but occasionally they're wrong.

" Coach March ie Schwartz's co
horts are ready to go, physically hik!
mentally. Of course most of them
on the field and on the bench wiJl
have knots in the pits of their stom
achs at the opening kickofT; the.
game means a lot to them and to all
of Stanford. But once the kickers
toe meets the ball and it goes sail
ing downfield, such things as nerv
ousness will be lost among the thrill:;
of the game.
The Dons will bring a greak
reputation down to (ho Farm with
them, a reputation that seems, on
the present evidence, deserved.
They are a high-scoring outfit;
hacks like Forrest Mall, Harmon
Kowe, Vince Pacewic, and Hal
Jensen might go the entire dis
tance at any time—from any spot
on the field.
But the boys from Fulton Street
don't shape up so well on the defen
sive side. The Nevada Wolf pack
made 19 first downs—more than the
Dons—but they couldn't push the
bnll across the final line as often.
So the experts are expecting a high
scoring thriller, and devil tyke tin?
hindmost.

The rooting section will he di
vided into two sections for tomor
row's K«nne, with the men on one
side and the women 011 the other,
announces Rally Committee. It is
felt that this will give the root
ing section a more symmetrical
appearance.

Clipper Smith's offset T is admit
tedly potent, hut so is the Shaugh
nessy T taught by Marchie
Schwartz. And Marchie has plenty
of quarterbacks who can pass,
plenty of ends and backs who can
snag onto the ball. On the ground
he has Merriman, Quist, Erickson,
the Andersons, and half a dozen
others who have looked good. He
has a line that might turn out to be
terrific. Fred Boensch, Dave De-
Swarte. Bill Hachten, and Captain
Jim Cox will be among the starters.
They'll be up against another good
first line, but the Dons may Ik; weak
in reserves.
The expected starting lineups
are (he same as tlu>sc which start
ed for both teams last week-end.
Nothing official has come out. and
of course nothing is definite, hut
it's a safe bet thai there'll be few
changes.
