## QUAD-SIDE 
### 
(The Stanford Daily has always been proud of
its policy to close its columns to defamatory pub
liiity ami common "gossip." The policy still stands.
Yet, Ibis morning we are initiating a column by
'Sill Strulhers which will contain all Quad chatter,
p. is. nality sidelights, and facts about people which
we consider of interest to students. R is presented
as a means of introducing people, cliques, and
" political" elements of the Quad to one another, in
the l»;pe that a closer friendship can he built up
among them, and that students unseen in our
headlines will not be "forgotten men." So here
we go. Quadsidc with Bill Struthers.)
OVERTURE
Thi i; a column of words for the birds, patterns
in puller for the tight little club of Stanford Uni
versity, based on the idea that within our club, all
7.169 of us, half of us should know the other half
rtnd how they live. No parting of ivy, no peering
through the California sun-nourished leaves, no
comment on the rest of the world, no verbal juggling
ol l!ii atom bomb or Harry Truman's bow-tie; no
ioud with Molotov or Herb Caen. No nothing, just
or. Quad and around the Farm, as far south as
Dinah's, north to the fog belt, east to Bayshore, and
"West to a secluded parking place wilh an occasional
Irip to Half Moon.
In all, this: An impartial smattering of nouns—
per: ,ons, places, things. With one adjective: Stanford.
The Village, halls, dorms, How, independents; mar
lied, single, divorced, otherwise; red, white, pink;
Jelt or light, right or wrong—Stanford. This is the
scoop, the hot poop, the word within the word, who's
who. what and where. Vou'll find out something
about the faces that wait for (he bus, or the person
who signed the library card before you, the middle
name of ihe guy with the initial /, how an Excom
member looks in bright light, why the cute blonde
transfer from Pasadena J.C. said no. The kind of
talk that goes wilh a cup of coffee, a coke, a cigarette,
or llie last minute before a lecture begins.
And with this altruism. No nothing means some
thing. Call it the law of opposites or the magic of
the double negative. Let's face it, we're Stanford,
We're ;i light little club; let's know what the inside
is Ii be.

Lei's start with the newest. If you're like me you
have to .see it to believe it. Stanford Village was
little more than a name till I spent an hour there
trying to find some friends, the Robert Browders,
grad student in history, married to a Mills gal. Inci
dentally they have solved the double bunk situation
very satisfactorily—with hammer and nails. The
Village around them is maze enough to trick any
rat. You're apt to meet the man who runs the boiler,
walk miles through corridors, knock on a dozen
wrong doors, ask twice as many questions, and get
more confused every minute; but I think you'll
notice this: Where things are the roughest, the
people are the nicest. A few more weeks, carpenters,
direction signs, and the Village will l>e the scene of
some mighty smooth living.
Back from you-know-where for more of you
know-what: Russ Dunlap, Clancy Boyd, Bob Car
lisle, Kim Allison, Ted Felasco, Bob Butler, John
Burriss, George Hellyer, along with hundreds of
other laces that will focus in front of their names
in the next couple of weeks.
Bill Shepard, international relations student, who
drags himself two blocks down Salvatierra every
morning to pour an endless stream of coffee from
behind the counter at the Cellar, has most' of us
beat for time. He's been here since '36, minus a war
of course. There's a weird mathematical relationship
between his total units and his monthly bill at
L'Omelette. Any increase in units is accompanied
by the square of that tacked on to his bill. Wonder
which he'll get first—a degree or an ulcer?
The healthy blonde with the fuzzy coiffure who
screens for the women's Dean is Mrs. Webster, a
licensed pilot and the ex-Persis Johnson, manager
of '43 Quad. Cutler Webster, her husband and also
a pilot, studies geology on Quad and in the field.
The Stanford Geological Survey summer camp at
Arroyo Seco and Nevada was open under his man
agement last quarter.-
Robert Samuel Barnes and Frank Q. Hewitt sug
gest parking meters, pay toilets, and subway turn
stiles to get on Quad. In keeping with the Admin
istration policy of getting the last lonely nickel, so
they say.
