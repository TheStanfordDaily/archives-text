# BILL COUGHLIN
## BULL SESSION 
### 
S< ems like times have changed. I can remember
(living in the past again!) when it wasn't safe to come
within 50 yards of Encina for fear of getting solidly
f;oaked with a waterbag. Have heard of very little
of that sort of thing going on down there lately.
But one of our smoother roughs, while leaving
Roble the otlvr night, got neatly beaned with a sack
ful of water.
I. no tradition sacred around here any more?

You may recall my mention in an earlier column
this week of a record of "Aren't You Kinda Glad We
Did?"—a number by Peggy Lee and one that is not
perhaps designed for the ears of leetle kiddies.
One of our Farm lads bought the record for his
lady fair (with what significance I haven't yet
learned) and presented it to her with much cere
mony. He couldn't understand her hurt surprise
until he realized that he had handed it to her upside
down.
The song on the reverse side is "It's All Over
Now."

It is now beginning to be apparent that the cam
pus is going to have a radio station. It will definitely
fill a long-felt need but some of the possibilities
are horrifying.
Do YOU want to be awakened in the morning
with, "Goodie good morning to you all, kiddies. This
is your ole Uncle Marchie with those snappy calis
thenics to wake you up so you can make those 8
o'clocks with a cheery smile. Okay now, one, two,
Ihroe, four, bend over and touch your poli sci books

with the tips of your oars. Thai's it. Don't you feel
better now?
"All right now, the ends cross and cut sharp
no, no. I mean now touch your heels with the
back of your head, etc., etc., etc. . . ."
Or perhaps later in die day:
"Hello, children, this is your ole Uncle Don
bringing you the funnies from the Alumni Review.
On the first page, we have Li'l Stalnabner and Daisy
Mayormaynot telling the faculty, "But you can too
put 3,000 people in the same classroom. They can
take turns breathing." And then the faculty says . . .
(FLASH, we interrupt this program to bring you a
special news bulletin. University tuition has just
been raised $15.) . . . This is your ole Uncle Don
again, kiddies, and now for a short word from our
sponsor . . .
(Quartet sings the Alma Mater to the tune of the
Super Suds song.)
Then a soothing voice: "Men, do you suffer from
loss of appetite after a big meal? Do you feel sleepy
after studying all night? Do girls shy away from you
in crowded classrooms? Do you worry about where
you're going to get some money? Come to Stanford
University, S-T-A-N-F-O-R-D, that's Drofnats
spelled sideways, and all these will seem like minor
ills. You don't know what worry is until you have
come to S-T-A-N-F-O-R-D. Try it today. Don't
try the small size, ti-y the great big Quad size. How's
about it, hmmmmm?"
(Quartet closes with "Come Join the Band'" sung
to the Mission Bell wine song.)
Thanks, but no thanks, I'd think twice before go
ing overboard on this radio station deal.
