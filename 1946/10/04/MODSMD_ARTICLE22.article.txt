MAT JUSTITIA, RUAT COELUM
Radio reports state that there is wicle-spread dis
satisfaction with the acquittal of Schact and von
Papen. It is important that we look at the facts be
iore coming to any conclusion condemning the Tri
bunal. That court could only consider the charges
duly laid before it in the indictment prepared by the
prosecuting nations. In that indictment, both these
defendants were charged on only two of the four
specified counts. They were charged with participat
ing in the "common plan or conspiracy" and in com
mitting "crimes against peace"; not with "war crimes"
nor "crimes against humanity."
'1 he principal basis on which some of the defend
ant-. were convicted of "conspiracy" was, apparently,
their intimacy with Hitler and their leadership in
the Nazi party. Neither Schact nor von Papen were
high-ranking partei-genossen nor members, the court
found, of the Hitlerian inner circle. While both took
an important part in German affairs in Ihe pre-war

years, both had been practically retired to the farm
hciore 1939. Certainly the position of Ambassador to
Turkey or member of the Reichstag does not imply
much control of policy.
Furthermore, the court had to weigh the guilt of
these two against that, for instance, of Goering or
Frank, who were sentenced to death. It must be
remembered that the decisions of the Tribunal will
be c ited hereafter as authority for certain principles
ol international law. Their careful discrimination be
tween charges and degrees of guilt will make these
principles more precise and more authoritative.
And, last, this was supposed to be a court of jus
tice. II the court was not convinced, by the evidence
presented, that particular defendants were guilty as
charged, then, as a court of justice, they had no al
ternative but to discharge these defendants. Through
out' this argument, I am defending the court, be it
understood, and not the persons acquitted.
