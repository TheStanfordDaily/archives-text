## 
### 
"Only Angels Have Wings," starring Cary Grant and Jean Arthur, will
be the feature picture of the first campus movies to b< j held Sunday night.
In addition, the seventh and eighth chapters of the serial, "Secret of
Treasure Island," a comic melodrama starring Gwen Gage, will be shown.
It is the story of a secret treasure buried in a desert island and of the tragic

fates of those who seek the treasure.
Campus movies, to be held once
every week this quarter for the first
time in history, are shown in the
Memorial Auditorium with the se
rial starting at 7:30 p.m. and ending
about 9:30 p.m. Price is 20 cents in
cluding tax.
Purpose of the movies, according
to Jiggs McCaulay, student head, is
to provide some form of inexpensive
entertainment chiefly for the benefit
of those who haven't got cars. Since
the movies are never longer than
two and one-half hours, girls will
not need to worry about missing
their 10:30 lockout, McCauley de
clared.
Movies may be shown each Sun
day at the Stanford Village also, but
final arrangements have not yet
been completed.

quarter includes:
