It's all over! The greatest pen
nant fight in the history of or
ganized major league baseball his
tory has gone down into the books
as a set of highly technical figures,
facts, and data. But the spirit, the
laughs and the tears, cannot be
interpreted by batting averages or
games won and lost. The national
pastime has had great years, but
none was as vital and as thrilling
as this past year's.
They're moaning the blues along
the Gowanus Canal, and in St. Loo
the cheers drown out the realists
who continue to insist that neither
the Cardinals nor the Dodgers could
possibly expect much more from the
Boston Red Sox than an invitation
to attend the World Series.
Flatbush Avenue hangs its head,
heavy with crepe and the memories
of chances wasted and a set of fig
ures that proclaim to all the base
ball world the fact that the Redbirds
rule the roost alone.
The better team has won. None
will deny it. Even "Higgleby," the
pride of Canarsie, Red Hook. Ben
sonhurst, and points east, must
have absorbed this fundamental
information. Eddie Dyer had the
material, and blood did tell. Mu
sial. Slaughter, Schoendienst, Ku
rowski and the rest of the Dyer
Gushouse Gang are professionals
and big-leaguers. They were
loaded for bear, and bear they
did, right down Dem Bums' neck.
Gertie from Greenpoint, Betty
from Brownsville, and Willy from
Williamsburg know it, they all
know it, but they won't give in
when it comes to a question of
courage and lighting heart.
With an odd assortment of green
kids and old men, Lippy Durocher
managed somehow to whip out of
nowhere a team with a fighting
spirit and a never-say-die attitude
towards the rest of the league.
Never figured to finish higher than
third place at the onset of the sea
son the Dodgers found along the
route a driving force that almost
catapulted them into the number
one position in the National League.
They battled along every inch of
the way, and it took more than skill
to keep them down—and out.
St. Louis was the team to beat,
and almost beat them, the Dodg
ers did. It was nip and tuck all
the way down to the line. They
finished in a dead heat, but there
the Brooklyn attacking momen
tum slowed to a walk. Then it
was all over, except for a brief
flurry in the ninth inning of yes
terday's game.
About $3,000 was at stake during
the late playoff series between St.
Louis and Brooklyn. Each player
on the winning team figures to
make that much more as a conten
der in the World Series than as a
second-place sharer in the spoils.
So tie the purse strings tight in
Brooklyn tonight.
Oh there is no joy in Flatbush
for mighty Schultz struck out!
Next week the World Series will
be underway and the Redbirds will
be out on their own and facing t'ie
Boston Red Sox. The Bosox are not
a bunch of kids or cripples, so the
feathers should fly when the two
tangle. Joe Cronin has the shears
ready and the American League en
try shouldn't have too much trouble
in taking the plummage off the Red
birds' backs. Boston in six games.
Oh there is no gold in Brooklyn
for mighty Schultz struck out!

information. Eddie Dyer had the
material, and blood did tell. Mu
sial. Slaughter, Schoendienst, Ku
rowski and the rest of the Dyer
Gushouse Gang are professionals
and big-leaguers. They were
loaded for bear, and bear they
did, right down Dem Bums' neck.
Gertie from Greenpoint, Betty
from Brownsville, and Willy from
Williamsburg know it, they all
know it, but they won't give in
when it comes to a question of
courage and lighting heart.
With an odd assortment of green
kids and old men, Lippy Durocher
managed somehow to whip out of
nowhere a team with a fighting
spirit and a never-say-die attitude
towards the rest of the league.
Never figured to finish higher than
third place at the onset of the sea
son the Dodgers found along the
route a driving force that almost
catapulted them into the number
one position in the National League.
They battled along every inch of
the way, and it took more than skill
to keep them down—and out.
St. Louis was the team to beat,
and almost beat them, the Dodg
ers did. It was nip and tuck all
the way down to the line. They
finished in a dead heat, but there
the Brooklyn attacking momen
tum slowed to a walk. Then it
was all over, except for a brief
flurry in the ninth inning of yes
terday's game.
About $3,000 was at stake during
the late playoff series between St.
Louis and Brooklyn. Each player
on the winning team figures to
make that much more as a conten
der in the World Series than as a
second-place sharer in the spoils.
So tie the purse strings tight in
Brooklyn tonight.
Oh there is no joy in Flatbush
for mighty Schultz struck out!
Next week the World Series will
be underway and the Redbirds will
be out on their own and facing t'ie
Boston Red Sox. The Bosox are not
a bunch of kids or cripples, so the
feathers should fly when the two
tangle. Joe Cronin has the shears
ready and the American League en
try shouldn't have too much trouble
in taking the plummage off the Red
birds' backs. Boston in six games.
Oh there is no gold in Brooklyn
for mighty Schultz struck out!
It's all over! The greatest pen
nant fight in the history of or
ganized major league baseball his
tory has gone down into the books
as a set of highly technical figures,
facts, and data. But the spirit, the
laughs and the tears, cannot be
interpreted by batting averages or
games won and lost. The national
pastime has had great years, but
none was as vital and as thrilling
as this past year's.
They're moaning the blues along
the Gowanus Canal, and in St. Loo
the cheers drown out the realists
who continue to insist that neither
the Cardinals nor the Dodgers could
possibly expect much more from the
Boston Red Sox than an invitation
to attend the World Series.
Flatbush Avenue hangs its head,
heavy with crepe and the memories
of chances wasted and a set of fig
ures that proclaim to all the base
ball world the fact that the Redbirds
rule the roost alone.
The better team has won. None
will deny it. Even "Higgleby," the
pride of Canarsie, Red Hook. Ben
sonhurst, and points east, must
have absorbed this fundamental
information. Eddie Dyer had the
