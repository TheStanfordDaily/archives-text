# Water Poloists Make Big Splash

### 
While "King Football" holds the
limelight this fall quarter, water
polo—by virtue of its rugged com
petitiveness—will attract many an
interested spectator.
The Stanford water polo squad
has potentialities of being one of
the best on the coast. Many mem
bers of last spring's PCC champion
ship swimming team are out for
water polo and under the able tute

and Tom Haynie they will shape
into a worthy opponent of any team
they meet. Emment Cashin, Stan
ford swim star of a few years back,
along with Alan Weeden and Bob
Bouchers are looking especially
good in the early practice sessions.
