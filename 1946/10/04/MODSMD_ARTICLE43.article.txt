## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oft. .1 (IT). —The St. Cardinals won their ninth
National League pennant today. Harry (The Cat) Brecheen choked off a
wild and typical rally hy the battling Brooklyn Dodgers (or an S to 4
triumph that captured the first flag playoff in baseball history.
With the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth and 31,875 roaring,

partisan fans begging for the home
run which would have tied the ball
game, Brecheen whistled his fast
ball past two men to retire the side
and send the Cardinals into the
World Series against the Boston Red
Sox.
It was typical Dodger baseball, a
dogfight to the end and an uprising
which almost succeeded when prac
tically everybody in the darkening
park counted them completely out.
They wfere trailing, 8 tc 1. going
into the bottom of the ninth and out
there lacing them was Murry Dick
son, a slim, cool righthander who
had given them two hits in the first
inning and held them hifless from
that point until the nirtth.
Before the dust had lifted on the
daffy final frame, Dickson was en
joying an early shower and Harry
Brecheen had ascended the hill to
protect the Cardinal's diminishing
lead. The Dodgers had two runs in,
two runners on base and only one
out, with the rabid home fans yell
ing their lungs out.
Bruce Edwards greeted Bre
cheen with a run-scoring single,
and when Lavagetto walked to
load the bags, the unbelievable
comeback had reached its climax.
But Brecheen was equal to the
task as he mowed down both Ed
die Stanky and Howie Schultz on
strikes.
