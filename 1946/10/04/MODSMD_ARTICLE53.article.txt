# We're Bound to Beat U.S.F. Is Consensus of Sports Poll
## 
### ART LEVINSON 
Pursuing our delightful duty of
Saturday's football games, I came
across a variety of answers that are
quoted below for posterity, or what
ever reason you might think of.
First fellow I tapped 011 the
shoulder thought U.S.F. would
win by two touchdowns. Stunned
by such obvious disloyalty to
Schwartz's lads. 1 asked for his
name, wishing to turn it in to
Men's Council for treason. Sam
Regan was the answer, and I fur
ther found out that he was an
electrician doing some mainte
nance work 011 the Quad. Ho
bum!
Next on the list for the roundup
in the roundhouse was a cute frosh
who was simply delighted at Stan
ford's first win last Saturday over
Idaho. "Sure we'll beat U.5.F.," she
said. Then, reversing the procedure,
she asked me if I thought we'd go
to the Rose Bowl. "Rose Bowl?
Sure we're going to the Rose Bowl
—even if we have to watch U.S.C.
play Texas."
A red-haired inhabitant of Ro

ble paused slightly when I posed
the question, and then thought
fully replied, "Stanford will win
by six points. Forrest Hall is a
dangerous runner, and so is Har
mon Rowe, but we have plenty of
fast hacks, too."
A good solid citizen of the Village j
was put through the paces next, and
I quote the learned observation I
received: "I've been watching Stan- j
ford practice every day for the past
two weeks, and they've shown re
markable improvement. I under- !
stand U.S.F. is plenty strong, but I
think we ought to win by one touch- '
down. It's going to be a high-scor- 1
ing game, and the final tally will be j
in the twenties or thirties."
Realizing that football is really
a man's game after all, I confined
my "interviews" to masculine
Stanfordites. The chap who sells
Palo Alto Times by the Cellar
thought Stanford would win by a
lot of points. Why? "Because it is
the best darn school there is, and
I'm going to go there when I
grow up."
Tossing our pledge to only talk
to fellows on the game overboard, I
asked a feminine member of L.S.J.U. |
what she thought about the Don- I
Indian tussle. "Stanford's going to
win! By a lot of touchdowns, too. I
If we go to the Rose Bowl, Mother's j
going to let me stay at the Biltmore
Hotel for one week. I've never been '
in Los Angeles, either."

Stanfordites. The chap who sells
Palo Alto Times by the Cellar
thought Stanford would win by a
lot of points. Why? "Because it is
the best darn school there is, and
I'm going to go there when I
grow up."
Tossing our pledge to only talk
to fellows on the game overboard, I
asked a feminine member of L.S.J.U. |
what she thought about the Don- I
Indian tussle. "Stanford's going to
win! By a lot of touchdowns, too. I
If we go to the Rose Bowl, Mother's j
going to let me stay at the Biltmore
Hotel for one week. I've never been '
in Los Angeles, either."
Pursuing our delightful duty of
Saturday's football games, I came
across a variety of answers that are
quoted below for posterity, or what
ever reason you might think of.
First fellow I tapped 011 the
shoulder thought U.S.F. would
win by two touchdowns. Stunned
by such obvious disloyalty to
Schwartz's lads. 1 asked for his
name, wishing to turn it in to
Men's Council for treason. Sam
Regan was the answer, and I fur
ther found out that he was an
electrician doing some mainte
nance work 011 the Quad. Ho
bum!
Next on the list for the roundup
in the roundhouse was a cute frosh
who was simply delighted at Stan
ford's first win last Saturday over
Idaho. "Sure we'll beat U.5.F.," she
said. Then, reversing the procedure,
she asked me if I thought we'd go
to the Rose Bowl. "Rose Bowl?
Sure we're going to the Rose Bowl
—even if we have to watch U.S.C.
play Texas."
A red-haired inhabitant of Ro

ble paused slightly when I posed
the question, and then thought
fully replied, "Stanford will win
by six points. Forrest Hall is a
dangerous runner, and so is Har
mon Rowe, but we have plenty of
fast hacks, too."
A good solid citizen of the Village j
was put through the paces next, and
I quote the learned observation I
received: "I've been watching Stan- j
ford practice every day for the past
two weeks, and they've shown re
markable improvement. I under- !
stand U.S.F. is plenty strong, but I
think we ought to win by one touch- '
down. It's going to be a high-scor- 1
ing game, and the final tally will be j
in the twenties or thirties."
Realizing that football is really
a man's game after all, I confined
my "interviews" to masculine
Stanfordites. The chap who sells
Palo Alto Times by the Cellar
thought Stanford would win by a
lot of points. Why? "Because it is
the best darn school there is, and
I'm going to go there when I
grow up."
