How Germany was able to get
through the war with her apparent
lack of resources will be the subject
of a talk by Charles F. Park. Jr.,
new geology professor, at a meeting
of the Geology Journal Club on
Monday, Oct. 7, at 4:05 p.m.
"There has been so much discus
sion lately on whether or not the
United States is a 'have' or 'have
not' nation now that I thought stu
dents would be interested in Ger
many's experiences as a 'have not',"
commented Mr. Park.
The mineral resources of the two
countries differ greatly, of course,
he said, but Germany's conservation
program could in many ways be ap
plied here.
