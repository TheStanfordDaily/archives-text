CAIRO, Egypt, Oct. 6 (UP).—The
giant tires of the Superfortress Pa- |
cusan Drcamboat smacked down on
a concrctc runway of Payne Field j
at !):54 a.m. (2:54 a.m., EST), today, !
and out. climbed 10 tired, bearded j
men who had proved in a 9,500-mile j
non-stop flight that the roof of the
world is an aerial express highway. J
Thirty-nine hours and !)•! niin
utes before, the Drcamboat had
lifted its nose above the combined
runways of Rogers and Ilickam
Fields at Honolulu. It crossed
part of the Pacific Ocean, Alaska,
Northwestern Canada, the mag
netic Pole. Greenland, Iccland, the
British Isles, France, Switzerland, i
Italy, and the Mediterranean.
It set an unofficial record of 242 ;
miles an hour—more than four miles ]
a minute —for non-stop flights of j
8,000 miles and over. It proved that
plane - to - ground and ground - to - I
plane radio contacts are possible in
the freakish magnetic field of the j
Arctic.
If it had not been for the weath
er, Irvine said, the Drcamboat
would have reached Cairo with
1,500 gallons of gasoline and
down on to Khartoum, !(70 miles
south of Cairo.
