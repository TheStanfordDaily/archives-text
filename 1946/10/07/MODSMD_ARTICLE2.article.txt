# Only Seven More Left for Rampaging Farm Eleven After 33 to 7 Victory Over U.S.F.; Anderson, Merriman Star
## 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
Larruping Lloyd Merriman put in an early season bid for all
coast fullbacking honors Saturday as a horde of point-hungry
Indians smothered a highly touted San Francisco Don outfit
under a flood of touchdowns. The final score was 33 to 7.
But the outcome of the game was really settled by the terrific

Cardinal line. From tackle to tackle
il was a virtual "iron curtain," mov
ing the heavier Dons at will, and
keeping the'sensational Forrest Hall
bottled up for most of the game.
HALL WAS TERRIFIC
The aforesaid Hall played a great
game for Clipper Smith's team, and
gave the San Francisco rooters their
only real thrill by gathering in
Charley Wakefield's second-quarter
kickoff on the one-yard line and
running it back all the way. He had
fine blocking, but his faking and
footwork were superb; it was obvi
ous before he had gone 20 yards that
he was on his way to a touchdown.

Hob Anderson, Stanford's liard
running halfback, is the winner
of this week's Kccble Award. The
Peerless Picker's choice will re
ceive a fountain pen for his efforts
against the San Francisco Dons
last Saturday.

Aside from that one lapse on the
part of the Stanford defenders, the
Dons were never close to a score.
In the fourth quarter young Mickey
Titus fumbled into the hands of a
waiting Don on the Stanford 24-
yard line, and Forrest Hall immedi
ately made it a first down on the 11.
Bui here an amalgamation of
Cardinal third and fourth string
ers got its hack up and shoved
the Dons all the way back lo the
:;5, where Stanford took over. The
Dons, always dangerous, could
never quite get their vaunted of
fense to function.-.ig when they
got close to touchdown territory.
INJURIES MAY BE COSTLY
Stanford's startling 33 to 7 victory
may have been a costly one'; game
captain Jim Cox was injured in the
first quarter and had to be helped
from the field. X-rays will be taken
to determine the extent of the in
jury. Also on the list of damaged
goods were center Pete August and
guard John Clark.
The San Franciscans obviously
missed Jim Ryan, their starting
quarterback and field general,
who was held on the sidelines by
injuries suffered in the Nevada
game a week ago. The Dons lost
another man in Saturday's game,
big guard Ed Kaminsky, who was
carried from the field in the sec
ond half.
The Cardinals had their first
touchdown just four minutes and
thirty seconds after the opening
kickofi", carrying the ball to pay dirt
in only 10 plays. Little Wayne Er
ickson gathered in the initial kick
ofi' on his own five and returned it
22 yards to the 27.
Four line plays and an incom
pleted pass chalked up two first
downs and put the ball on the In
dian 48. Then Erickson took the
ball oft tackle for 48 yards to the
Don four-yard line, where he was
cut down from behind by Jack Jen
sen.
MERUIMAN PASSES AND RUNS
A holding penalty put the Stan
fords back to the lib Rut on
fourth down and with IX yards to
go Ruck Brownson sent Lloyd
Merriman around left end on his
favorite shovel-pass play, and he
didn't stop until he hit the end
zone.
The second Stanford score was set
up by a left-handed pass from Mer
riman to Dave DeSwarte, tacked
onto the end of the shovel-pass
play; the Don defense was caught
flat-footed. Bob Anderson scored
from the two-yard line on a long
run around right end.
Here it was that Mr. Ilall elec
trified everyone in the half-filled
stadium by taking the kickoff
back !)!) yards for the lone Don
touchdown. It was the only play
of the afternoon where the Dons

—as a team—lived up to their ad
vance build-up.
CARDS SCORE AGAIN
The second half started like the
first, only more so; the driving Red
machine had a touchdown within a
minute and 30 seconds of play. Af
ter the first kickoff was nullified by
a Stanford offside, Larruping Lloyd
grabbed the second and ran it back
20 yards to his own 38.
But the key run was made by
Bob Anderson, the rugged, tawny
haired left half. On the next play
he went off tackle for 58 yards to
tlie Don four-yard line, with no
downfleld blocking whatsoever—
twisting, turning dodging, and
bucking past the faster Don backs.
Merriman scored on the next play.
The rest of the game was anti
climactic. Stanford moved down the
field twice more on, sheer power and
drive, with that magnificent Red
line showing the way. George "Po
lar Bear" Quist rammed his way
through the line for both touch
downs.
INDIAN PASSING BAD
Stanford, considered a passing
team up to now. completed only one
pass out of nine tries (that one
thrown from Merriman to DeSwarte
for 28 yards), but rolled up over 300
yards on the ground—well over a
hundred of it gained by the efforts
of Lloyd Merriman. The Cardinals
made 17 first downs to the Dons' 5.
After the game the Dons were
a weary bunch of boys, with little
to cheer about. Coach Clipper
"Laughing Boy" Smith still was
able to sport his usual smile, but
it was mighty thin around the
edges. He had nothing but praise
for Merriman, Bob Anderson, and
Erickson, but thought it was Stan
ford's over-all balance and depth
that turned the trick. "I can tell
you this," he said. "I'm glad we
don't have to play them again this
year."
On the other hand, Marchie said,
"This fellow Hall is everything they
said he was before the game." He
got the Clipper off into a corner, out
of earshot of the nosy press, and
whispered in his ear for 10 minutes,
patting him on the back all the
while. Clipper didn't seem to be
very much consoled, but that just
shows how these old Notre Dame
boys stick together.

RED LINE MAGNIFICENT
The part played by Stanford's line
in the stunning win over U.S.F.
can't be overemphasized. The first
stringers were expected to be good,
but the Dons weren't a match for
any of three Cardinal forward walls.
A groan went up from the Stanford
rooting section when Jolting Jim
Cox was injured, but Charley
Wakefield and Bob Berryman filled
in with no appreciable drop in effi
ciency. And it was that way in
every position.
The Indians have a dozen first
rate backs, but not even a quin
tuple threat like Lloyd Merriman
—who passes, runs, kicks, blocks,
and snags passes—could look good
unless he had those fire-eaters up
front. And most important of all
is the depth.
Quarterback Aubrey Devine came
up with the best prognosticating of
the week bj r picking Stanford to
win by a score of 33 to 6. After the
game he said, "I can't understand
how I missed that one'point." Don't
worry about it, kid, Harmon Rowe's
conversion attempt was ALMOST
blocked.

to determine the extent of the in
jury. Also on the list of damaged
goods were center Pete August and
guard John Clark.
The San Franciscans obviously
missed Jim Ryan, their starting
quarterback and field general,
who was held on the sidelines by
injuries suffered in the Nevada
game a week ago. The Dons lost
another man in Saturday's game,
big guard Ed Kaminsky, who was
carried from the field in the sec
ond half.
The Cardinals had their first
touchdown just four minutes and
thirty seconds after the opening
kickofi", carrying the ball to pay dirt
in only 10 plays. Little Wayne Er
ickson gathered in the initial kick
ofi' on his own five and returned it
22 yards to the 27.
Four line plays and an incom
pleted pass chalked up two first
downs and put the ball on the In
dian 48. Then Erickson took the
ball oft tackle for 48 yards to the
Don four-yard line, where he was
cut down from behind by Jack Jen
sen.
MERUIMAN PASSES AND RUNS
A holding penalty put the Stan
fords back to the lib Rut on
fourth down and with IX yards to
go Ruck Brownson sent Lloyd
Merriman around left end on his
favorite shovel-pass play, and he
didn't stop until he hit the end
zone.
The second Stanford score was set
up by a left-handed pass from Mer
riman to Dave DeSwarte, tacked
onto the end of the shovel-pass
play; the Don defense was caught
flat-footed. Bob Anderson scored
from the two-yard line on a long
run around right end.
Here it was that Mr. Ilall elec
trified everyone in the half-filled
stadium by taking the kickoff
back !)!) yards for the lone Don
touchdown. It was the only play
of the afternoon where the Dons

—as a team—lived up to their ad
vance build-up.
CARDS SCORE AGAIN
The second half started like the
first, only more so; the driving Red
machine had a touchdown within a
minute and 30 seconds of play. Af
ter the first kickoff was nullified by
a Stanford offside, Larruping Lloyd
grabbed the second and ran it back
20 yards to his own 38.
But the key run was made by
Bob Anderson, the rugged, tawny
haired left half. On the next play
he went off tackle for 58 yards to
tlie Don four-yard line, with no
downfleld blocking whatsoever—
twisting, turning dodging, and
bucking past the faster Don backs.
Merriman scored on the next play.
The rest of the game was anti
climactic. Stanford moved down the
field twice more on, sheer power and
drive, with that magnificent Red
line showing the way. George "Po
lar Bear" Quist rammed his way
through the line for both touch
downs.
INDIAN PASSING BAD
Stanford, considered a passing
team up to now. completed only one
pass out of nine tries (that one
thrown from Merriman to DeSwarte
for 28 yards), but rolled up over 300
yards on the ground—well over a
hundred of it gained by the efforts
of Lloyd Merriman. The Cardinals
made 17 first downs to the Dons' 5.
After the game the Dons were
a weary bunch of boys, with little
to cheer about. Coach Clipper
"Laughing Boy" Smith still was
able to sport his usual smile, but
it was mighty thin around the
edges. He had nothing but praise
for Merriman, Bob Anderson, and
Erickson, but thought it was Stan
ford's over-all balance and depth
that turned the trick. "I can tell
you this," he said. "I'm glad we
don't have to play them again this
year."
On the other hand, Marchie said,
"This fellow Hall is everything they
said he was before the game." He
got the Clipper off into a corner, out
of earshot of the nosy press, and
whispered in his ear for 10 minutes,
patting him on the back all the
while. Clipper didn't seem to be
very much consoled, but that just
shows how these old Notre Dame
boys stick together.

RED LINE MAGNIFICENT
The part played by Stanford's line
in the stunning win over U.S.F.
can't be overemphasized. The first
stringers were expected to be good,
but the Dons weren't a match for
any of three Cardinal forward walls.
A groan went up from the Stanford
rooting section when Jolting Jim
Cox was injured, but Charley
Wakefield and Bob Berryman filled
in with no appreciable drop in effi
ciency. And it was that way in
every position.
The Indians have a dozen first
rate backs, but not even a quin
tuple threat like Lloyd Merriman
—who passes, runs, kicks, blocks,
and snags passes—could look good
unless he had those fire-eaters up
front. And most important of all
is the depth.
Quarterback Aubrey Devine came
up with the best prognosticating of
the week bj r picking Stanford to
win by a score of 33 to 6. After the
game he said, "I can't understand
how I missed that one'point." Don't
worry about it, kid, Harmon Rowe's
conversion attempt was ALMOST
blocked.
Larruping Lloyd Merriman put in an early season bid for all
coast fullbacking honors Saturday as a horde of point-hungry
Indians smothered a highly touted San Francisco Don outfit
under a flood of touchdowns. The final score was 33 to 7.
But the outcome of the game was really settled by the terrific

Cardinal line. From tackle to tackle
il was a virtual "iron curtain," mov
ing the heavier Dons at will, and
keeping the'sensational Forrest Hall
bottled up for most of the game.
HALL WAS TERRIFIC
The aforesaid Hall played a great
game for Clipper Smith's team, and
gave the San Francisco rooters their
only real thrill by gathering in
Charley Wakefield's second-quarter
kickoff on the one-yard line and
running it back all the way. He had
fine blocking, but his faking and
footwork were superb; it was obvi
ous before he had gone 20 yards that
he was on his way to a touchdown.

Hob Anderson, Stanford's liard
running halfback, is the winner
of this week's Kccble Award. The
Peerless Picker's choice will re
ceive a fountain pen for his efforts
against the San Francisco Dons
last Saturday.

Aside from that one lapse on the
part of the Stanford defenders, the
Dons were never close to a score.
In the fourth quarter young Mickey
Titus fumbled into the hands of a
waiting Don on the Stanford 24-
yard line, and Forrest Hall immedi
ately made it a first down on the 11.
Bui here an amalgamation of
Cardinal third and fourth string
ers got its hack up and shoved
the Dons all the way back lo the
:;5, where Stanford took over. The
Dons, always dangerous, could
never quite get their vaunted of
fense to function.-.ig when they
got close to touchdown territory.

a Stanford offside, Larruping Lloyd
grabbed the second and ran it back
20 yards to his own 38.
But the key run was made by
Bob Anderson, the rugged, tawny
haired left half. On the next play
he went off tackle for 58 yards to
tlie Don four-yard line, with no
downfleld blocking whatsoever—
twisting, turning dodging, and
bucking past the faster Don backs.
Merriman scored on the next play.
The rest of the game was anti
climactic. Stanford moved down the
field twice more on, sheer power and
drive, with that magnificent Red
line showing the way. George "Po
lar Bear" Quist rammed his way
through the line for both touch
downs.
INDIAN PASSING BAD
Stanford, considered a passing
team up to now. completed only one
pass out of nine tries (that one
thrown from Merriman to DeSwarte
for 28 yards), but rolled up over 300
yards on the ground—well over a
hundred of it gained by the efforts
of Lloyd Merriman. The Cardinals
made 17 first downs to the Dons' 5.
After the game the Dons were
a weary bunch of boys, with little
to cheer about. Coach Clipper
"Laughing Boy" Smith still was
able to sport his usual smile, but
it was mighty thin around the
edges. He had nothing but praise
for Merriman, Bob Anderson, and
Erickson, but thought it was Stan
ford's over-all balance and depth
that turned the trick. "I can tell
you this," he said. "I'm glad we
don't have to play them again this
year."
On the other hand, Marchie said,
"This fellow Hall is everything they
said he was before the game." He
got the Clipper off into a corner, out
of earshot of the nosy press, and
whispered in his ear for 10 minutes,
patting him on the back all the
while. Clipper didn't seem to be
very much consoled, but that just
shows how these old Notre Dame
boys stick together.

RED LINE MAGNIFICENT
The part played by Stanford's line
in the stunning win over U.S.F.
can't be overemphasized. The first
stringers were expected to be good,
but the Dons weren't a match for
any of three Cardinal forward walls.
A groan went up from the Stanford
rooting section when Jolting Jim
Cox was injured, but Charley
Wakefield and Bob Berryman filled
in with no appreciable drop in effi
ciency. And it was that way in
every position.
The Indians have a dozen first
rate backs, but not even a quin
tuple threat like Lloyd Merriman
—who passes, runs, kicks, blocks,
and snags passes—could look good
unless he had those fire-eaters up
front. And most important of all
is the depth.
Quarterback Aubrey Devine came
up with the best prognosticating of
the week bj r picking Stanford to
win by a score of 33 to 6. After the
game he said, "I can't understand
how I missed that one'point." Don't
worry about it, kid, Harmon Rowe's
conversion attempt was ALMOST
blocked.
Larruping Lloyd Merriman put in an early season bid for all
coast fullbacking honors Saturday as a horde of point-hungry
Indians smothered a highly touted San Francisco Don outfit
under a flood of touchdowns. The final score was 33 to 7.
But the outcome of the game was really settled by the terrific

Cardinal line. From tackle to tackle
il was a virtual "iron curtain," mov
ing the heavier Dons at will, and
keeping the'sensational Forrest Hall
bottled up for most of the game.
HALL WAS TERRIFIC
The aforesaid Hall played a great
game for Clipper Smith's team, and
gave the San Francisco rooters their
only real thrill by gathering in
Charley Wakefield's second-quarter
kickoff on the one-yard line and
running it back all the way. He had
fine blocking, but his faking and
footwork were superb; it was obvi
ous before he had gone 20 yards that
he was on his way to a touchdown.

Hob Anderson, Stanford's liard
running halfback, is the winner
of this week's Kccble Award. The
Peerless Picker's choice will re
ceive a fountain pen for his efforts
against the San Francisco Dons
last Saturday.

Aside from that one lapse on the
part of the Stanford defenders, the
Dons were never close to a score.
In the fourth quarter young Mickey
Titus fumbled into the hands of a
waiting Don on the Stanford 24-
yard line, and Forrest Hall immedi
ately made it a first down on the 11.
Bui here an amalgamation of
Cardinal third and fourth string
ers got its hack up and shoved
the Dons all the way back lo the
:;5, where Stanford took over. The
Dons, always dangerous, could
never quite get their vaunted of
fense to function.-.ig when they
got close to touchdown territory.

goods were center Pete August and

The San Franciscans obviously
missed Jim Ryan, their starting
quarterback and field general,
who was held on the sidelines by
injuries suffered in the Nevada
game a week ago. The Dons lost
another man in Saturday's game,
big guard Ed Kaminsky, who was
carried from the field in the sec

The Cardinals had their first
touchdown just four minutes and

bucking past the faster Don backs.
Merriman scored on the next play.
The rest of the game was anti
climactic. Stanford moved down the
field twice more on, sheer power and
drive, with that magnificent Red
line showing the way. George "Po
lar Bear" Quist rammed his way
through the line for both touch
downs.
INDIAN PASSING BAD
Stanford, considered a passing
team up to now. completed only one
pass out of nine tries (that one
thrown from Merriman to DeSwarte
for 28 yards), but rolled up over 300
yards on the ground—well over a
hundred of it gained by the efforts
of Lloyd Merriman. The Cardinals
made 17 first downs to the Dons' 5.
After the game the Dons were
a weary bunch of boys, with little
to cheer about. Coach Clipper
"Laughing Boy" Smith still was
able to sport his usual smile, but
it was mighty thin around the
edges. He had nothing but praise
for Merriman, Bob Anderson, and
Erickson, but thought it was Stan
ford's over-all balance and depth
that turned the trick. "I can tell
you this," he said. "I'm glad we
don't have to play them again this
year."
On the other hand, Marchie said,
"This fellow Hall is everything they
said he was before the game." He
got the Clipper off into a corner, out
of earshot of the nosy press, and
whispered in his ear for 10 minutes,
patting him on the back all the
while. Clipper didn't seem to be
very much consoled, but that just
shows how these old Notre Dame
boys stick together.

RED LINE MAGNIFICENT
The part played by Stanford's line
in the stunning win over U.S.F.
can't be overemphasized. The first
stringers were expected to be good,
but the Dons weren't a match for
any of three Cardinal forward walls.
A groan went up from the Stanford
rooting section when Jolting Jim
Cox was injured, but Charley
Wakefield and Bob Berryman filled
in with no appreciable drop in effi
ciency. And it was that way in
every position.
The Indians have a dozen first
rate backs, but not even a quin
tuple threat like Lloyd Merriman

is the depth.
Quarterback Aubrey Devine came
up with the best prognosticating of

The San Franciscans obviously
missed Jim Ryan, their starting
quarterback and field general,
who was held on the sidelines by
injuries suffered in the Nevada
game a week ago. The Dons lost
another man in Saturday's game,
big guard Ed Kaminsky, who was
carried from the field in the sec

The Cardinals had their first
touchdown just four minutes and
thirty seconds after the opening
kickofi", carrying the ball to pay dirt
in only 10 plays. Little Wayne Er

22 yards to the 27.
Four line plays and an incom
pleted pass chalked up two first
downs and put the ball on the In

MERUIMAN PASSES AND RUNS
A holding penalty put the Stan
fords back to the lib Rut on
fourth down and with IX yards to
go Ruck Brownson sent Lloyd
Merriman around left end on his
favorite shovel-pass play, and he
didn't stop until he hit the end
zone.
The second Stanford score was set
up by a left-handed pass from Mer
riman to Dave DeSwarte, tacked
onto the end of the shovel-pass
play; the Don defense was caught
flat-footed. Bob Anderson scored
from the two-yard line on a long
run around right end.

stadium by taking the kickoff

touchdown. It was the only play
of the afternoon where the Dons

—as a team—lived up to their ad
vance build-up.
CARDS SCORE AGAIN
The second half started like the
first, only more so; the driving Red
machine had a touchdown within a
minute and 30 seconds of play. Af
ter the first kickoff was nullified by
a Stanford offside, Larruping Lloyd
grabbed the second and ran it back
20 yards to his own 38.
But the key run was made by
Bob Anderson, the rugged, tawny

Larruping Lloyd Merriman put in an early season bid for all
coast fullbacking honors Saturday as a horde of point-hungry
Indians smothered a highly touted San Francisco Don outfit
under a flood of touchdowns. The final score was 33 to 7.
But the outcome of the game was really settled by the terrific

Cardinal line. From tackle to tackle
il was a virtual "iron curtain," mov
ing the heavier Dons at will, and
keeping the'sensational Forrest Hall
bottled up for most of the game.
HALL WAS TERRIFIC
The aforesaid Hall played a great
game for Clipper Smith's team, and
gave the San Francisco rooters their
only real thrill by gathering in
Charley Wakefield's second-quarter
kickoff on the one-yard line and
running it back all the way. He had
fine blocking, but his faking and
footwork were superb; it was obvi
ous before he had gone 20 yards that
he was on his way to a touchdown.

Hob Anderson, Stanford's liard
running halfback, is the winner
of this week's Kccble Award. The
Peerless Picker's choice will re
ceive a fountain pen for his efforts
against the San Francisco Dons
last Saturday.

Aside from that one lapse on the
part of the Stanford defenders, the
Dons were never close to a score.
In the fourth quarter young Mickey
Titus fumbled into the hands of a
waiting Don on the Stanford 24-
yard line, and Forrest Hall immedi
ately made it a first down on the 11.
Bui here an amalgamation of
Cardinal third and fourth string
ers got its hack up and shoved
the Dons all the way back lo the
:;5, where Stanford took over. The
Dons, always dangerous, could
never quite get their vaunted of
fense to function.-.ig when they
got close to touchdown territory.
