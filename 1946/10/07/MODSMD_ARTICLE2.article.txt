# Only Seven More Left for Rampaging Farm Eleven After 33 to 7 Victory Over U.S.F.; Anderson, Merriman Star

### DAN ENDSLEY 
Larruping Lloyd Merriman put in an early season bid for all
coast fullbacking honors Saturday as a horde of point-hungry
Indians smothered a highly touted San Francisco Don outfit
under a flood of touchdowns. The final score was 33 to 7.
But the outcome of the game was really settled by the terrific

Cardinal line. From tackle to tackle

keeping the'sensational Forrest Hall
bottled up for most of the game.
HALL WAS TERRIFIC
The aforesaid Hall played a great
game for Clipper Smith's team, and
gave the San Francisco rooters their
only real thrill by gathering in
Charley Wakefield's second-quarter
kickoff on the one-yard line and
running it back all the way. He had
fine blocking, but his faking and
footwork were superb; it was obvi
ous before he had gone 20 yards that
he was on his way to a touchdown.

Hob Anderson, Stanford's liard
running halfback, is the winner
of this week's Kccble Award. The
Peerless Picker's choice will re
ceive a fountain pen for his efforts
against the San Francisco Dons
last Saturday.

Aside from that one lapse on the
part of the Stanford defenders, the
Dons were never close to a score.
In the fourth quarter young Mickey
Titus fumbled into the hands of a
waiting Don on the Stanford 24-
yard line, and Forrest Hall immedi
ately made it a first down on the 11.
Bui here an amalgamation of
Cardinal third and fourth string
ers got its hack up and shoved
the Dons all the way back lo the
:;5, where Stanford took over. The
Dons, always dangerous, could
never quite get their vaunted of
