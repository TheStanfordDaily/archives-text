# 'Y' Membership Drive Opens
## 
### 
Stanford's Y.W.C.A. membership
drive opens today and will end Fri-
day. The campaign is an annual
event to raise funds for the organi
zation's activities.
"Why 'Y'?" is the theme of the
drive, which emphasizes active par
ticipation in Y.W.C.A. affairs. Ac
cording to Ellie Brill, "Y" president,
the group co-ordinates all women's
activities on campus. Within the or-
ganization there are 10 committees
in which all women may participate.
Speakers will visit all women's
dining rooms tonight to explain the
purposes of the "Y." Hall represen-
tatives should phone the Daily when
each living group reaches 100 per
cent membership, according to Guy-
la Runyon, the drive chairman.
One of the committees organized
under the Y.W.C.A. is the freshman
club. This group, headed by Lynn
Cox, has its own social program
which includes dances, service, and
discussions of problems relating to
freshman life on campus.
Other committees offered by the
"Y" are world affairs, political ef-
fectiveness, religion, and the inter
national student groups.
The speakers who will explain
"Y" activities tonight are Ellie Brill,
Lagunita; Sidney Morgan, Roble;
Helen Dietz, Branner; Joanne Lu-
cas, Union; Betty Callendar, Storey;
Betty Wellington, Lathrop; Pat An-
derson, Cubberley and Klahoya;
Bernice Glendenning, Hurlburt and
Jordan; Barbara Brenzel, Roth;
Midge Hexter, Guthrie and Durand;
and Jean Strong, Russell.
