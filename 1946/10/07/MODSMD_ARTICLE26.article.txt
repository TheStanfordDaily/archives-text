Voters will decide on Amendment
I to the constitution, which i.s stated
: as follows:
"Excom shall have the power to
I create voting members to represent
| new areas added to the association."
AMENDMENT UP
| The amendment i.s designed to
j remedy a situation in which Excom
■ does not have the power to add rep-
I resentatives to Excom from new
i student, living areas at Stanford.
The amendment has been recom
j mended by Excom as the simplest
I way of assuring the 2,000 residents
of the Village adequate representa
tion on Stanford's highest legisla
tive body, the Executive Committee.
If the amendment is adopted,
I Excom will have the power to set
| up legally correct representation
| for the Village on the basis of
! year to year population at its own
| discretion.
Representation on Excom on the
, basis of a sectional basis was one of
j the most important provisions of
| the new ASSU constitution adopted
j in spring and is a decided change
j from the previous method of elect
j ing Excom members on a class basis.
