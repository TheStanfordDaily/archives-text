# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Policy, Volume 110 
### 
That you can't please everybody is a fact
lcnown ever since the Tower of Babel col
lapsed. It is just as true that the Daily's edito
rial policy will not please all those persons
with whom the Daily in concernedâ€”the citi
zens of Stanford's community.
By some the Daily has been accused of
boi ng a rubber stamp, mouthing the views of
the Administration; by others, the Daily is
thought of a3 a dangerous organization of
red-ho.; trying to attack established campus
organizations and traditions for the sake of
eel' publicity.
Actually, Daily editorial policy is neither.
]t attempts to evaluate all proposals and com
plaints that come before it according to the
maximum beneficial effect to students. In
accordance with this policy, the Daily will
support movements it believes worthwhile to
the student body as a whole; e.g., establish
ment of a radio station on campus. It will at
tack movements and groups if believes detri
mental.
In such evaluations, the Daily editorial
board attempts to take a long-range view as
to the future of the University, and the con
tinuance of top-flight education in the nation.
But we look upon the students at Stanford now
as far more important than students coming
in the future no generation of students has
ever been so receptive to the stuff in books,
no generation has ever so badly needed the
chance to be informed.
I .o censorship or supervision is exercised
by Administration officials against the Daily.
Their influence on Daily policy comes solely
from the facts they give us. Yet this local
"freedom of the press" does not endow us
with license but rather implies responsibility
thot this freedom not be abused. V/e cannot
ignore the facts as they are operative in Ad

ministration policy. We cannot assume that
objectionable conditions are immediately re
mediable through a blasting editorial. We can
best find and present the facts which dictate
action or complaint from both sides of every
issue, and when the facts do not resolve them
selves into a plan of action, set forth what
seems to us the most desirable action. We
have never believed in antagonism for the
sake of antagonism.
The Daily has no right to attack any camp
us groups or institutions without allowing
tjiem a rebuttal. In printing a campus opinion
letter containing a legitimate attack against
the S.A.C. policy of segregating non-student
wives from their husbands at football games,
we included the S.A.C.'s reply: that allowing
wives to sit in the rooting section would
change the nature of the section, subjecting it
to a sizeable tax. In the same way, campus
opinion columns are always open to persons
objecting to Daily policy.
So the Daily finds itself treading middle
ground in the majority of cases. Its policy is
dictated by a desire to consider all sides in
the light of student welfare and a realization
that it is the only instrument of editorial
opinion on the Stanford campus. Our primary
guarantee to the students is that in cases
where a legitimate student grievance is ignor
ed, or sustained by the Administration for
untenable reasons, the Daily will not hesitate
to attack that portion of Administration policy.
Nor will it fail to attack any portion of Stan
ford life where a manifestly unfair situation
exists.
In all editorial decisions, the Daily wel
comes opinions from the student body, al
though final decisions will be made as always
by the editorial board, consisting of the edi
tor, the three associate editors, the managing
editor and the staff editor.
