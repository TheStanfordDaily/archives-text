## HISTORY 1946 
### 
THE PAY-OFF
In the calmer moments following the tumult of
battle, people begin to wonder who pays the bills
for war. Tho people of the United States began to
wonder last week.
To some extent everybody pays, regardless of
wealth, race, and creed. But do all contribute their
proper share? *
One thing was becoming clear last week, a bitter
lesson driven home after every war. The guilty still
literally get away with murder. Of the hundreds of
irresponsible diplomats, demagogues, industrialists,
and systematic misleaders of public opinion—these
to be found in all nations, including Russia, Ger
many, and the United States—who made this war
inevitable, a dozen are sentenced to death.
The results of Nuernberg are very similar to the
; lot machine situation in near-by counties. Thanks
to proper protection they are tolerated by the au
thorities. Every one in a while the citizens start
clamoring for a clean-up or the authorities want to
show that they are really on the ball (say around
election time). A raid is planned, a certain "joint"
picked, and the outfit that owns the machines in
formed to prepare for a raid the following day. It
sends its men to the selected place, removes all the
modern sucker traps and puts in a few useless
broken down contraptions. Next day the police show
up and with much picture-taking and clamor the
machines are duly destroyed.
That's about what happened at Nuernberg. The

people wanted something done, so twelve of the
more useless members of the international gang were
picked to take the rap. An added bit of showman
ship was a fair trial. This was flashy but not risky !
for the evidence was overwhelming.
Another old truth is now slowly coming to the
light again: The poorer people pay a far heavier
share of the burden than the wealthier ones. Figures
released by the Federal Reserve Bank (NOT a Com
munist-controlled organization) show that the great
est percentage of savings is held by the small number
of people in the upper income groups, while among
the lower groups savings are almost non-existent.
While the people by and large are no better off today
than they were in 1941, the richer groups are consid
erably better off. Contrary to widespread newspaper
inspired ideas, most of the money that was made in
this wai' went to higher income groups.
That is not all. Out of the billions of war bonds I
the government has to pay back only a relatively
small percentage are held by people with less than
$3,000 income. Yet the welter of complex economic
research indicates strongly that when taxes are lev
ied to finance the repayment the brunt of these taxes
will be borne by the lower groups. When all taxes !
direct and indirect—are considered they have almost i
always hit these people the most.
And so the people of the world—those most inno
cent —not only fight wars but finance them, and the
rich grow richer while the poor have children.

many, and the United States—who made this war
inevitable, a dozen are sentenced to death.
The results of Nuernberg are very similar to the
; lot machine situation in near-by counties. Thanks
to proper protection they are tolerated by the au
thorities. Every one in a while the citizens start
clamoring for a clean-up or the authorities want to
show that they are really on the ball (say around
election time). A raid is planned, a certain "joint"
picked, and the outfit that owns the machines in
formed to prepare for a raid the following day. It
sends its men to the selected place, removes all the
modern sucker traps and puts in a few useless
broken down contraptions. Next day the police show
up and with much picture-taking and clamor the
machines are duly destroyed.
That's about what happened at Nuernberg. The

people wanted something done, so twelve of the
more useless members of the international gang were
picked to take the rap. An added bit of showman
ship was a fair trial. This was flashy but not risky !
for the evidence was overwhelming.
Another old truth is now slowly coming to the
light again: The poorer people pay a far heavier
share of the burden than the wealthier ones. Figures
released by the Federal Reserve Bank (NOT a Com
munist-controlled organization) show that the great
est percentage of savings is held by the small number
of people in the upper income groups, while among
the lower groups savings are almost non-existent.
While the people by and large are no better off today
than they were in 1941, the richer groups are consid
erably better off. Contrary to widespread newspaper
inspired ideas, most of the money that was made in
this wai' went to higher income groups.
That is not all. Out of the billions of war bonds I
the government has to pay back only a relatively
small percentage are held by people with less than
$3,000 income. Yet the welter of complex economic
research indicates strongly that when taxes are lev
ied to finance the repayment the brunt of these taxes
will be borne by the lower groups. When all taxes !
direct and indirect—are considered they have almost i
always hit these people the most.
And so the people of the world—those most inno
cent —not only fight wars but finance them, and the
rich grow richer while the poor have children.
THE PAY-OFF
In the calmer moments following the tumult of
battle, people begin to wonder who pays the bills
for war. Tho people of the United States began to
wonder last week.
To some extent everybody pays, regardless of
wealth, race, and creed. But do all contribute their
proper share? *
One thing was becoming clear last week, a bitter
lesson driven home after every war. The guilty still
literally get away with murder. Of the hundreds of
irresponsible diplomats, demagogues, industrialists,
and systematic misleaders of public opinion—these
to be found in all nations, including Russia, Ger
many, and the United States—who made this war
inevitable, a dozen are sentenced to death.
