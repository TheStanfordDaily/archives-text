### MARY VIRGINIA POND 
"This is station KSU, Stanford I
University, 51)0 on your dial, bring- |
ing you up-to-the-minute news on t
I campus events with special United
: Press wire releases from the Stan- I
| ford Daily. Dances this weekend I
will feature . . ."
And across the campus—up the
i Row, over at Roble, down at the
Village-Stanford men and women
will take a few minutes off from
studies to bear what has been '
i ing on around the Farm.
APPROVED BY KXCOM
With Excom's approval for a cam- I
pus broadcasting station to serve I
I exclusively students and faculty, i
Stanford can take its place along j
with Harvard, Yale, Columbia,
Wellesley, and 40 other colleges in '
this country and Canada who serve
their students in this same manner.
Stanford's campus radio station
has been made possible through the
efforts of Bill Eilers, Bob Heller, Bob j
1 Peck and other students who have
spent a year of research on the |
I project.
NO COMMERCIALS
Now it will be possible for stu- j
dents to hear music from the big |
name bands playing at the Reg
i Dance or the Junior Prom, from the j
I Tuesday Evening Series, Gaieties, or !
j Friday night rally.
In fact, music from a complete '
l record and transcription file—music I
I without commercial interruption—
will be a station keynote.
AIRED NATIONALLY
"Our hope is that not only broad
j casts for the campus station can be
prepared, but that the best pro
i duced on the Farm can be aired over j
San Francisco stations and perhaps 1
a national network," states Bill Ei- j
lers, program director for the sta
tion.
Broadcasting Council will direct |
j this activity too, and make the con- |
I tacts with commercial broadcasters, j
"Through the proposed Stanford j
broadcasting station," adds Bob |
! Peck, advertising director, "the j
! Farm can take another step ahead i
' in giving students actual practice in !

the- important field of radio broad
casting."
STUDENT HELP NEEDED
Students will be needed as soon
as the station opens for important
advertising, announcing, and writ
ing jobs. The following students
have already signed up for staff po
sitions: Paula Jones, programs and
continuity; Marty Razor, head copy
writer; Art Levinson, radio sports
department head; John Sabin, busi
ness and accounting director; and
I'rank Schuster, promotion director,
Bob Heller will be acting man
ager of the station. Carrying out
the announcing and script-writing
jobs will be George Moore and Jim
Joseph. Several people from East
ern college stations have also ap
plied to work on the staff.
On-the-job-training for 50 to GO
students can be provided in every
field of radio including secretarial,
accounting, production, engineer
ing, commentating, and radio sta
tion management.
RADIO COURSES OFFERED
Campus musicians will have wide
use of station facilities. Radio pro
ductions will give speech and drama
majors radio-acting experience. Al
ready students interested in broad
casting can take courses in all phases
of radio industry through the Sum
mer Radio Institute.
Facilities available, according to
Eilers and Heller, for getting the sta
tion on the air in a short time in
clude a studio and control room in

the Memorial Auditorium and a
transmitter. S.rplus wire can also
be attained.
WILL BE MEMBER OF IBS
Finally Stanford's station will be
a part of the established Intercol
legiate Broadcasting System (IBS).
The IBS extends its services to oth
er college radio stations by provid
ing standards of operation, scripts,
music clearance, monthly informa
tion bulletins, »nd national "ad"
accounts to the stations.
As a non-profit organization it
would seem that the station can
bring the University, its faculty,
students, and administration closer
together with increased enjoyment,
co-operation, and educational value
for every member of the Stanford
Family.
