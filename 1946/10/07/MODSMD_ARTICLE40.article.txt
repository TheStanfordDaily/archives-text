# Red Sox Edge Cards 3-2 On York's Homer in 10th
## 
### 
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Oct. 6 (UP).—Big Rudy York, the Cherokee
clouter from Alabama, powdered a fast inside pitch into the left
field bleachers, in the tenth inning today to give the favored
Boston Red Sox a 3 to 2 triumph over the St. Louis Cardinals in
the first game of the World Series.

Facing the swift slants of the
Cardinals' southpaw ace, liowie
Pollet, who had just forced the
threatening Ted Williams to pop
out, York stole the spotlight from
his slugging teammate by knock
ing the hall into the shadows be
fore a roaring crowd of .*>(>.2lB
fans.
In a game replete with drama as
the two teams battled through nine
innings to go into overtime, the
Irish-Indian first baseman, who last
year helped Detroit to its pennant
and the world championship, looked
at two pitches which were outside.
Then he came through on that
high inside pitch and the ball
soared high into the air. There
was 110 question as it rocketed up
and out that it was good all the
way.
Boston had taken a one-run lead
in the second inning only to have
the Cardinals fight back to tie it up
in the sixth. The Redbirds brought
the partisan crowd roaring to its
feet in the eighth when apple
cheeked Joe Garagiola, a kid catcher
playing in his first series, rifled a
double to center which scored
Whitey Kurowski and gave the Red
birds a one-run lead.

ST. LOUIS, Oct. <; (UP).—
Southpaws Mickey Harris, of the
Boston Red Sox, and Harry (The
Cat) Brecheen, of the St. Louis
Cardinals, were named tonight as
the pitchers for the second game
of the World Series at Sports
man's Park tomorrow.
Harris won 17 games this year,
and Brecheen copped 15.

But Boston came right back in
the ninth with three hits which
squared it again—and left it up to
York in that dramatic 10th.
With Cecil (Tex) Hughson, the
Boston starter, lifted for a pinch
hitter who came through in the
ninth, it was an overlooked pitch
er who came on to halt the Car
dinals in the final two innings and
take the decision.
He was Earl Johnson, a left
hander who Manager Joe Cronin
had been using exclusively in re
lief this season. He didn't let the
Red Sox down this time. A purple
heart and bronze star winner who
came back this year from the bat
tlefields of Europe, Johnson set
down the Cards in order in the
ninth, and then came through in
the clutch in the 10th after a team
mate's error put him in a bad spot.
