# Good Old Days Back--- Indians Have Arrived!!
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. (5 (UP).
| —Stanford University's touch
down-mad. Indians are on the
! warpath and on the basis of two
games have provided the shot-in
the-arm needed by the Pacific-
Coast Conference to get it back on
a peacetime footing.
Not since the halcyon days of
Ftankie Albert, Norm Standlee and
the innovation of the "T" formation
has Stanford fielded a team which
has caught the public's eye in such
magnitude. In two games, the In
dians have demonstrated that they
are shortly less than terrific.
In the season opener a week ago,
the Red Shirts swamped lowly
Idaho, 45-0, in their conference
starter. Yesterday against highly
regarded University of San Fran
cisco, the Indians donned the war
paint and thundered down the war
path to a 33-7 scalping of the out
j classed Dons.
The score is indicative of the
thorough drubbing administered
by halfback Bob Anderson and
fullback Lloyd Merriman.
The only highlight, for San Fran
cisco was Forrest Hall's 99-yard
j touchdown jaunt in the second pe
riod. Otherwise, a burly and alert
| Stanford line smothered the Dons'
I running attack.
The other power eleven on the
West Coast is stationed at the Un
iversity of California at Los An
geles who overpowered Washing
ton, .'59-13, for the Bruins second
one-sided conference triumph.
With Ernie Case and Cal Rossi in
the drivers seats, the UCLA, aerial
attack clicked on all cylinders in
thumping the Huskies at Seattle.

In the top interscctional game,
Ohio State's rebounding Buckeyes
wrecked University of Southern
California, 21-0, behind a jarring
fullback named Joe Whisler who
scored three touchdowns before
80,047 spectators.
Whisler, a 207-pound mass of
shoulder, took the Trojans apart
and his methodical teammate John
Stungis added the extra points that
completed a miserable showing for
the defending western champions.
California continued impotent
in dropping its conference opener
to Oregon 14-13, who played with
out the services of their star half
back Jake Leicht.
Washington State had no trouble
romping over Idaho, 32-0, in the
50th meeting between the rivals.
Freshman Gordon Brunswick and
sophomore Jerry Williams were the
standouts for the Cougars.
Among the independents, Nevada
took to the air lanes to trounce a
vastly improved University of Santa
Clara team, 33-7, behind the spec
tacular playing of Negro end Hor
ace Gillom. i
In other games, Fresno State
trimmed the Hawaiian All-Stars,
13-6; Arizona State eked out a 13-
12 victory over George Pepperdine
College* Willamette University
spoiled the University of British Co
lumbia's initiation into Pacific
Northwest Conference, 26-13; Val
lejo, Calif., J.C. swamped Susanville,
Calif., 52-0, and Oregon State Col
lege blanked the University of Port
land, 35-0.

Calif., 52-0, and Oregon State Col
lege blanked the University of Port
land, 35-0.
SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. (5 (UP).
| —Stanford University's touch
down-mad. Indians are on the
! warpath and on the basis of two
games have provided the shot-in
the-arm needed by the Pacific-
Coast Conference to get it back on
a peacetime footing.
Not since the halcyon days of
Ftankie Albert, Norm Standlee and
the innovation of the "T" formation
has Stanford fielded a team which
has caught the public's eye in such
magnitude. In two games, the In
dians have demonstrated that they
are shortly less than terrific.
In the season opener a week ago,
the Red Shirts swamped lowly
Idaho, 45-0, in their conference
starter. Yesterday against highly
regarded University of San Fran
cisco, the Indians donned the war
paint and thundered down the war
path to a 33-7 scalping of the out
j classed Dons.
The score is indicative of the
thorough drubbing administered
by halfback Bob Anderson and
fullback Lloyd Merriman.
The only highlight, for San Fran
cisco was Forrest Hall's 99-yard
j touchdown jaunt in the second pe
riod. Otherwise, a burly and alert
| Stanford line smothered the Dons'
I running attack.
The other power eleven on the
West Coast is stationed at the Un
iversity of California at Los An
geles who overpowered Washing
ton, .'59-13, for the Bruins second
one-sided conference triumph.
With Ernie Case and Cal Rossi in
the drivers seats, the UCLA, aerial
attack clicked on all cylinders in
thumping the Huskies at Seattle.

In the top interscctional game,
Ohio State's rebounding Buckeyes
wrecked University of Southern
California, 21-0, behind a jarring
fullback named Joe Whisler who
scored three touchdowns before
80,047 spectators.
Whisler, a 207-pound mass of
shoulder, took the Trojans apart
and his methodical teammate John
Stungis added the extra points that
completed a miserable showing for
the defending western champions.
California continued impotent
in dropping its conference opener
to Oregon 14-13, who played with
out the services of their star half
back Jake Leicht.
Washington State had no trouble
romping over Idaho, 32-0, in the
50th meeting between the rivals.
Freshman Gordon Brunswick and
sophomore Jerry Williams were the
standouts for the Cougars.
Among the independents, Nevada
took to the air lanes to trounce a
vastly improved University of Santa
Clara team, 33-7, behind the spec
tacular playing of Negro end Hor
ace Gillom. i
In other games, Fresno State
trimmed the Hawaiian All-Stars,
13-6; Arizona State eked out a 13-
12 victory over George Pepperdine
College* Willamette University
spoiled the University of British Co
lumbia's initiation into Pacific
