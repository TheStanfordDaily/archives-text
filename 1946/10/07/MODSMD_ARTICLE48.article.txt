# THE
						STANFORD STORY
## On the Land of Indians, Spain, Race Horses, a College Began 
### BILL HORNBY 
At first Stanford land was the
home of squatter Indians, small mud
huts baking in the sun. Spain held j
the land, but it was too far away
from the legendary gold of the Az- j
tecs to attract much attention from j
the "Conquistadores." Not until 17(59,
did an exploring party under Don
Caspar de Portola set out from Mis
sion San Diego to chart Alta Cali
fornia for the court of Madrid.
Fifty miles south of the Golden ;
Gate, Poj'tola'.s mission bogged down
in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Fol- ;
lowing San Francisquito Creek east
down into a great valley, they came
to two tall redwoods which domi
nated the valley floor. Here, with
out finding the great bay he had
been sent to find, Portola turned
back.
To mark llie northernmost point
of his march, he named the trees
"I'alo Alto," tall tree. One still
stands where the San Francisquito
Creek crosses the S.P. tracks, a
mile north of the entrance to Palm
Drive.
For another 100 years the valley j
knew few humans. Studded with |
great oaks, it looked in 1792 to Capt. j
George Vancouver like a great "park
which had been planted with Eng
lish oak." In 18157 Governor Alva
rndo granted the lands near the Palo
Alto trees to Don Antonio Buelna.
But Mexico was losing control.
Through the valley in 1844 marched I
the small force of John Charles Fre
mont. symbol of increasing Ameri
can power in El Dorado. By 1862 at
least 20 American settlers had pre
empted holdings on Don Antonio's
estate, and great charcoal ovens
among the oaks and madronos
burned the timber cuttings of these |
hopeful farmers.
A year later George Gordon, a
wealthy San Francisco merchant,
bought out the various settlers and !
paid $250 to Buelna's heir for title
to "Rancho San Francisquito." His
house and stables were later en
larged by Stanford, and the house ;
still stands as the Stanford Con
valescent Home.
Iceland Stanford bought the
ranch lie named "Palo Alto" from
Gordon in 1870. The Central Pa
cific Railroad had been completed
the year before, and his career as
Civil War Governor of California
was behind him. Rumored as a
presidential possibility. Leland

Stanford at last had both the
money and the leisure to enjoy
life on the scale of a feudal baron.
Here on the sunny Palo Alto acres,
Stanford proceeded to make racing
history. His "Electioneer" breed of
trotters, trained at the world's most
modern tracks, were soon making
racing history. Throughout Europe
and America the name of Stanford
traveled with champion horses and
followers of his progressive colt
training system.
Today there is little to remind
students of this great ranch. Still
with us are the "Red Barn" where
riding classes are again being held,
the near-by stables, the remains of
the white paddock fences around the
tracks where colts and trotters were
trained, a statue to the horses, and
the records which first honored the
name "Palo Alto."
By 1890 the Stanfords' project for
a great university to honor their
dead son had advanced to the sand
stone and mortar stage. The "Sena
tor" was aging fast, and he wanted
to see tangible results of his plan
ning before death.
A temporary road was cut
through the Stanford Arboretum
to the railway shack at ''Univer
sity Park." the one ramshackle
building on the site of modern
Palo Alto. This future Palm Drive
was practically impassable for the
horses and surreys of the small
faculty, all i niportcd from the
East. Menlo Park was the post
office, railway station, and express
office for the University; Mayfield
was a dusty collection of frontier
saloons.
As the faculty drifted in late in
the hot summer of 1891, the walls of
Roble (now Sequoia) were just ris
ing above ground level; interior
work on Encina and the Inner Quad
was not yet done; the Museum was
a pile of lumber and stone.
The faculty lived where they
could, some in Mayfield, some up

San Francisquito Creek at Adelante,
a boarding house started by two
pioneering young Eastern- ladies,
some in Menlo Park among the lab
ulous estates of San Francisco's
wealthy. Tramping to their offices
on the Quad, dusty and afoot, they
were known as "tramp perfessers'
to the natives who were a bit skep
tical of all the pounding and shout
ing going on out on the "Governor's"
ranch.
Sitting on the half - completed
Quad, eating their lunches, this
collection of young Eastern pro
fessors wondered what the first
year at Stanford would bring. The
young Indianan. David Starr Jor
dan. President of only half a
school, sal among them, eating
with his jackknife, thinking of the
trips he bad made recruiting stu
dents.
His efforts were rewarded. From
all parts of the country, more than
400 students came for the opening
of the University on October 1, 1891.
From a welcoming stand erected on
the west side of the Quad, Senator
Stanford told the students he did
not believe any education was su
perfluous; Jordan told them that
"the Golden Age of California be
gins when its gold is used for pur
poses like this."
