# Vet Contracts Await Election
## 
### 
Contracts with California veter
ans for purchase of farms or homes
after about Oct. 20 must be made
contingent upon approval of Propo
sition No. 1 at the November 5 gen
eral election, according to Lawrence
C. Stevens, state director of veter
ans' affairs.
Proposition No. 1 is the $100,000,-
000 veterans' farm and home bond
issue.
Stevens estimates that with the
present rate of purchases, all funds
from a $30,000,000 bond issue ap
proved by the voters in 1944 will be
exhausted by Oct. 20.
"Failure of the bond issue ap
pears to be extremely unlikely,"
the director commented. "Propo
sition No. 1 has been widely en
dorsed by public and private
groups throughout the state, and
there is no organized opposition."
The interest rate on purchase
contracts has be on cut from 5 per
cent to 3 per cent, making it pos
sible for a veteran to obtain a home
under the state plan at lower cost
than with any other form of financ
ing available in California.
