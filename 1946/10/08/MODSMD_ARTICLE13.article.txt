"The response to the Gaieties' call
for skits and songs has been very
encouraging, but we still need more
of each to make the Gaieties the

very pleased with the number and
quality of the songs submitted, but
we would lik'j more songs to insure
the presentation of the best pos
sible numbers. The number of skits
submitted is not sufficient, and if
you have any ideas running through
your head, we wish you would put
I hem down on paper and turn them
in before Oct. 11. The success of
the Gaieties depends on you, the
student body. Let's make that show
a Big Game event, to be remem
bered," said Gaieties Director Bob
Ashley.

ning skits will be presented in the

will be on Oct. 18, and singing try
