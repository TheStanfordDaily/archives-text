# YWCA Drive Ends Friday
## 
### 
Stanford's Y.W.C.A. membership
drive will continue through Friday
of this week. "Why 'Y'?" is the
theme of the drive, an annual event
to raise funds for the organization's
activities.
Within the "Y" are 10 committees
on which all women may partici
pate. One of these is the freshman
club, headed by Lynn Cox. This
group has its own social program
and includes discussions of prob
lems relating to freshman life on
campus.
