# Eating Club Fate Dubious
## 
### 
haling club representatives as- !
certained yesterday that the future j
of the clubs depended on further .
investigation by the Administration. !
Dean of Students Stalnaker an- i
nounced at a meeting with Inter- ;
club Council that his office has as j
yet come to no conclusion, although i
the requested facts and figures gath- |
ered by the council were turned in i
last Friday.
Stalnaker did appoint two admin- :
istrative members to accompany In- 1
terclub President Ray Smith to in- |
spect dining facilities for the orga- j
nizations at Encina Commons.
Further information from the 1
Dean of Students' office depends on j
their findings, which will be com- i
pi 'Med, possibly, by Wednesday.
The eating clubs, formed at the j
end of the 19th century, were forced ,
to suspend operations during the ;
war. Three of the clubs that had
built their own clubhouses at the
cost of $3,000 each, lost these struc
tures due to condemnation proce
dures by the University during the 1
war years. This has added to the |
problem of the reformation of the
organizations.
Due to the small number of re- |
turning members, however, the |
clubs are requesting the return of
two or possibly only one of their
former rooms in Encina Commons, j
Interclub Council feels that this will
not be an impossible request since a ;
large number of the members al- ;
ready eat at Encina and the com- j
mons handled 2,000 students during I
(he war years whereas it is only j
feeding approximately 850 now. |
