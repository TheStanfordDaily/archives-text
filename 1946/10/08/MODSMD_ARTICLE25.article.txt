# Voters To Determine
## Excom Representation 
### 
When Stanford voters go to the polls next Tuesday, October 15, the big issue they will face
will be Amendment One to the ASSU Constitution. The Amendment is important. Some 2,000
additional Stanford students now residing at Stanford Village are without representation on the
Executive Committee. Until the Constitution is amended no provision can be made.

PROPOSED AMENDMENT

The Amendment reads: "Excom
shall have the power to create vot
ing members to represent new areas
added to the association." If this
provision is passed next Tuesday
legal machinery can be set up to
create new positions on Excom.
Nominees can be submitted to a
vote in a later election.
Eight student positions will also
be filled at the Tuesday elections.
Four voting members of Excom are
to be selected. Two representatives
from District 11, Men's row. One
Man from Toyon Hall, District IV.
One Graduate member at large to
represent all grad students who will
not come under the proposed Vil
lage districts.
NOMINATIONS OPEN
Nominations will open tomorrow
morning at 8. Booths will be placed
at History and Engineering corners.
Blanks will be available there. All
Candidates must have a maintained
"C" average, and be qualified mem
bers of the Stanford Student Body.
Slips should be signed by 15 quali
fied voters.
Sectional and proportional repre
sentation is a new idea to many old
returning Stanford students. Under
the new Constitution, adopted by
referendum last winter quarter pro
vision was made to represent stu
dents by where they lived, instead
of the traditional Class representa
tion.
At the time it was impossible to
forsee the possibility that 2,000 ad
ditional members of the Student
Body would be living in an entirely
new area. Hence no provision was
made to allow for the expansion of
Excom.
Amendment No. One will take
care of the details involved and al
low Stanford Village to become a
legal part of the Stanford Family.


STANFORD VILLAGE where 2,000 students arc without representa
tion on Stanford's Executive Committee.
