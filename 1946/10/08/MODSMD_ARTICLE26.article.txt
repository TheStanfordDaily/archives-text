## 
### GEORGE CAULFIELD 
Encina Hull residents held a
spontaneous and novel open house
last evening. Featured attraction
was the lighting of a trash can.
The University (ire department
advertised the party about the
campus by running their bright,
new red machines noisily around.
Encina men greeted all visitors
with water hags.
Needless to sav. the trash can
blaze was quickly extinguished.
However, the fire department,
who set tip an information booth
in front of the hall, impressed the
casual spectator with their cool
cfTicicncy.
