The executives of the Stanford Broadcast
ing Station this week drew up a charter for
Excoin approval which included in it provi
sion for faculty membership on the Broadcast
ing Council. This Council, the executives un
derstood, was to be a separate organization
under the A.S.S.U. whose affairs would be
directed by its voting members.
Publications Council asked by the radio
executives lo approve the charter rejected the
prop ;..al, sinking from it all mention that poli
cies oi scripis would be in any way respon
sible- to ih * Administration or faculty members
appointed by the Administration. They abol
ished the Broadcasting Council in favor of
membership of two station officials on Publica
tions Council, amending their constitution to
include radio executives and renaming them
selves the Communications Council.
Under this arrangement, complete freedom
of speech is guaranteed as it is guaranteed in
the first amendment of the United States Con
stitution, with no danger of censorship im
plied. Similarly, the Council felt a student
sponsored organization set up for the students
should be supervised by the students them
selves. Any faculty control should come from
an advisor supervising the technical not pol
icy side of production.
If Excom approves the revised charter
Wednesday evening, the radio station will be

initiated under manifestly the same conditions
of freedom which are accorded the Daily. Ex
com has the power to so approve the charter,
despite any reluctance of the Administration
to have another force of criticism established.
We believe that any group of students
with the foresight of those who set up the
Stanford Broadcasting Station will likewise
recognize their responsibility to the University
to act in its best interests. Just as last year
Excom took action itself to censor Gaieties,
the power for any censorship of the station
should lie with the students.
Recognizing the potentialities for educa
tion afforded by the station, we nevertheless
recommend that no stipulations as to content
of programs, or alliance with classroom activi
ties be included in the charter. Such a pre
conceived policy comes dangerously close to
admitting unnecessary supervision to the sta
tion.
Once underway, the radio station should
be free to serve as a supplement to the Daily
and Chaparral—an editorial force for criticism,
revelation and information. Should its leaders
choose to exercise none of these freedoms, it
is likewise within their power to do so. What
is asked from Excom and from the Adminis
tration in condoning the station's activities, is
a written guarantee that the station have at
the outset a right to determine its own policy.

appointed by the Administration. They abol
ished the Broadcasting Council in favor of
membership of two station officials on Publica
tions Council, amending their constitution to
include radio executives and renaming them

Under this arrangement, complete freedom
of speech is guaranteed as it is guaranteed in
the first amendment of the United States Con
stitution, with no danger of censorship im
plied. Similarly, the Council felt a student
sponsored organization set up for the students
should be supervised by the students them
selves. Any faculty control should come from
an advisor supervising the technical not pol
icy side of production.
If Excom approves the revised charter
Wednesday evening, the radio station will be

initiated under manifestly the same conditions
of freedom which are accorded the Daily. Ex
com has the power to so approve the charter,
despite any reluctance of the Administration
to have another force of criticism established.
We believe that any group of students
with the foresight of those who set up the
Stanford Broadcasting Station will likewise
recognize their responsibility to the University
to act in its best interests. Just as last year
Excom took action itself to censor Gaieties,
the power for any censorship of the station
should lie with the students.
Recognizing the potentialities for educa
tion afforded by the station, we nevertheless
recommend that no stipulations as to content
of programs, or alliance with classroom activi
ties be included in the charter. Such a pre
conceived policy comes dangerously close to
admitting unnecessary supervision to the sta
tion.
Once underway, the radio station should
be free to serve as a supplement to the Daily
and Chaparral—an editorial force for criticism,
revelation and information. Should its leaders
choose to exercise none of these freedoms, it
is likewise within their power to do so. What
is asked from Excom and from the Adminis
tration in condoning the station's activities, is
a written guarantee that the station have at
the outset a right to determine its own policy.
The executives of the Stanford Broadcast
ing Station this week drew up a charter for
Excoin approval which included in it provi
sion for faculty membership on the Broadcast
ing Council. This Council, the executives un
derstood, was to be a separate organization
under the A.S.S.U. whose affairs would be
directed by its voting members.
Publications Council asked by the radio
executives lo approve the charter rejected the
prop ;..al, sinking from it all mention that poli
