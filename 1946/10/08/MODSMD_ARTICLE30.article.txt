# CAMPUS OPINION

(Rally Committee requests that (he Daily print
the following Campus Opinion with the hope that
a response will be received from the student body
to endorse or recall its policy of segregating the
rooting sections. Kally Com originally made the
ruling for the sake of the card stunts and rooters'
cap designs—both of which will he initiated at the
U.C.1..A. game — and to insure better-regulated
cheering.—'l he Editor)
There was quite a bitter squawk raised on the
female side of the rooting section for the game last
Saturday when the women were herded to their
place in the stands. The somewhat unequal division
put. the men from the 40-yard line to the 40 and the
women from the 40 to the 20.
Possibly there is some good reason for this seem
ingly unjust division. But the girls want to know
who deftly figured out who was to sit where, and
why.

To the Editor:
Concerning your article on the segregation of men
and women into separate rooting sections, we are
of the opinion that Rally Coin's action was illogical
and unnecessary.
Rally Com advances two reasons for the split:
that it would encourage louder rooting, and present

a better appearance. Our answer to the first assertion
is that louder rooting would not result from the split,
because any restriction on seating would reduce the
number of those occupying the rooting section, as
any fellows who wished to take girls to the game
could not reasonably seat their female companions
and then return to their own places. At least, a
courteous and considerate man would hardly do this.
The only alternative is for them to sit outside of the
rooters' section, which would hardly appeal to either.
Perhaps the solution to the problem of securing
greater volume in the rooting section will be found
if closer contact were established between yell lead
ers and student body. This contact could possibly be
established by the addition of two other yell leaders.
Our answer to the second assertion, concerning
better appearance, is that the segregation of a root
ing section according to sex gives the impression
that there are two individual groups totally uncon
nected in their objectives; whereas, with a single,
unified rooting section, the impression is that there
is a common objective. Stanford prides itself in be
ing a coeducational school, yet, for two dubious rea
sons, Rally Com rules arbitrarily that men and
women are to have separate rooting sections. It
would appear that tradition continue to counter
balance logical progress at Stanford.
Sincrely yours,
