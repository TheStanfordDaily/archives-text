## BULL SESSION 
### 
Seems to be quite a small epidemic of fall colds
about the campus these days. 1 am the proud pos
sessoi of one that I feel certain is at least first cousin
to double pneumonia.
I even left a party last night and went home at
2 a.m., that's how bad I felt. Was running a terrific
temperatureâ€”which might have had something to
rlo with the date I was with but I am more in
elined to blame it on the cold.
At least, I think I had a temperature. I ! can't
1/i .'inc. first thermometer that I tried said I Was
fair, with light to moderate snow in the late after
noon. Next one said 1 should be left in the oven
If) minutes longer and garnished with parsley before
serving.
After that I gave up trying to take my tempera
ture and went to bed. Had been asleep about two
minutes when one of the brothers came running into
the sleeping porch.
"Hey," he says, "your cold keeping you awake?"
"No," I informed him briefly.
"Too bad," he says, "got just the thing to put you
right, to sleep. Take these nose drops, stand on your
head in the corner for fifteen minutes, and you'll
feel good as new in the morning. Sleep like a brick,
too."
About half an hour later I got to sleep again, a
finger up each nostril, and my nose full of some
thing that smelt like it had failed an experiment at,
the Chem Lab.
I was awakened by another brother, shaking me
vigorously.
"Hy," he says, "hear you got a cold and can't
sleep. "This'll fix you right up. Granma always
used it." He waved a bottle full of greenish liquid
before my bleary eyes.
After downing two tablespoons full of something

that would have made even an Eskimo burp, I stag
gered back to bed and once again snoozed fitfully.
"Whattsa matter?" a voice howled in my ear.
"Can't you sleep on accounta that cold? Got just
the thing for you. Make you sleep like a log." I tried
to look as much like a giant redwood as possible but
he dragged my battered body out of the sack.
"Here," he offered, "rub this stuff on your chest,
on your back, in your ears, and stuff some up your
nose. It'll break your cold and you'll sleep like a
log. Kills underarm odor, too." He began rubbing
me briskly with something that looked like a mixture
of axle grease and hair tonic. After he had me look
ing like a pre-sealed ball bearing, he handed me a
blanket.
"Now wrap up real tight in this and go to bed,"
he advised. "You'll sleep like a log." He wound the
blanket around me until I looked like Amber at a
bundling party. Then he carted me back to the
sleeping porch. "You'll sleep like a log," he prom
ised me, burying an axe in my forehead and clomp
ing off in his hobnailed boots.
Finally struggling free enough to breathe, 112 once
more dropped off to sleep. Then it happened again.
"Hear you got a cold, Coffee, old buddy, old pal,
shay, know jusht the thing to fix ya so's ya can
really snooze, old kid, old ihing. Come on down the
highway with me, old buddy, I know a li'l place that
sherves after hoursh. Li'l old hot toddies, jusht the
things for that old cold, old buddy."
Next thing I know I was in a little dive down on
the highway drinking hot toddies. And you know,
by golly, that guy knew what he was talking about.
Twelve of those really cleared up that cold and I
sure slept when I got home. But I still feel awful
today.
What's a good cure for a hangover?
