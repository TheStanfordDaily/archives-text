# Police Attempt to Solve Campus Parking Problem
## 
### 
Parking violations draw (he ma
jority of tickets issued to student
drivers, the police department an
nounced yesterday. There have
been a few speeding tickets, but
most of them have boon for parking
in wrong places and for too long.
Tb" white area in front of Memo
rial Auditorium has claimed the
most victims, with the white curb
ing in front of the Administration
Building accounting for most of the
remainder.
There have been a number of new
rules this year because of the in
creased number of ears on campus,
but the police feel that there are
enough new signs and explanations
to warn everyone.

A parking lot is being paved
across from the Education Building,
and will be ready in a few days, the
police department announced yes
terday. This lot will be for students
who drive their cars to school. The
parking lot which is in back of the
Education Building has been used
by faculty members since its con
struction. It is hoped that (he new
lot will help relieve the congestion
which has been caused by the in
crease in the number of people who
live oIT campus and drive to Stan
' ford.
