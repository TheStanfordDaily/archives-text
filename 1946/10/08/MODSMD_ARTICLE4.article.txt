# 'Big Sister' Plans Made
## 
### 
Revision of the housing social
program for freshmen led discus
sion at yesterday's Women's Con
ference meeting. Plans under con
sideration by Housing Committee
were explained.
They are:
(1) A big and little sister plan,
whereby each freshman or transfer
woman would have a means of in
formally becoming acquainted with
every type of living group on cam
pus. (2) A program whereby the
various upper-class living groups
would entertain corridors of fresh
men and transfers at after-dinner
coffees, volleyball games, and simi
lar functions.

Housing Com members will
meet at 1 p.m. today in the Ex-
I'oni room, according to Cathryn
Owen, chairman.
Plans for the revision of the so
cial program for freshmen will he
discussed. The meeting is open to
any women with suggestions for an
improved social program, said Miss
Owen.

Also on the agenda was a report
on Row Excom by Ann Bubb,
chairman of the group. The report
resulted in a discussion of the pur
poses of Row Excom and queries as
to whether or not these purposes
have been taken over by other
groups, making Row Excom power
less and purposeless. Betty Davies,
chairman of Conference, pointed
out that this is a problem concern
ing Row houses only and therefore
any decision on the abolishing of
tiie group or on the altering of their
powers should come from the Row.
