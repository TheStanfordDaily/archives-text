By JAMES BOSWELL
II you want to be an all-Ameri
ean, spend your summer hauling 8
cords of wood every day.
This is the recipe offered by Lloyd
Morriman, latest of Stanford's
plunging lull backs in the best Nev
cis-Crayson-Standlee tradition.
Lloyd, a raw-boned farm boy,
hails Iron) Clovis, California, a small
agricultural community in the San
Joaquin Valley.
Against I lie Dons last Saturday,
Merrinian further substantiated
liis claim for ail-American honors
by collecting 15(1 yards from
scrimmage, at least 5(1 of which
were gained with opponents
hanging onto him. In addition he
threw a 30-yard pass on the dead
run which landed in the arms of
Dave DeSwarte. This pass, which
set up Stanford's second touch
down, was the first that Lloyd had
ever thrown in college competi
tion.
To fulfill his reputation as a tri
ple-threat man, Merrinian did his
team's punting for an average of
over 40 yards.
Although he had no opportunity
against the Dons to prove it, Merri
nian is one of the Indian's best pass
receivers. On defense he is a sharp
and deadly tackier and an expert
pass defender. In fact there is no
phase of football at which he does
not excell.

Lloyd first came to Stanford as a
freshman in the fall of 1942 at the
age of 18. He soon lived up to his
reputation as a fine athlete by lead
ing the Papoose football team to an
undefeated season. The following
spring, still as a freshman, he made
a letter playing first base and out
field on the varsity baseball team.
Shortly thereafter he was sworn
into the navy. While stationed at
the Norman (Okla.) Naval Air
Base, Lloyd played first string
fullback for the Oklahoma
"Zoomers" service team, an ag
gregation which included many
college and professional stars.
On his return to the Stanford
campus last spring he took up where
he left off two years earlier by lead
ing the Indian baseball nine in hit
ting and slugging.
This fall, although he has not had
the pre-season buildup given Herm
Uedemeyer, Doc Blanchard, Glenn
Davis, Bob Fenimore, and Harry
Gilmer, Merriman will be picked on
more than one all-American team if
lie continues at the pace he has
started.
Before we close this, it should be
stated that the handsome fullback is
not married, but he does like girls
and chocolate eclairs.

II you want to be an all-Ameri
ean, spend your summer hauling 8
cords of wood every day.
This is the recipe offered by Lloyd
Morriman, latest of Stanford's
plunging lull backs in the best Nev
cis-Crayson-Standlee tradition.
Lloyd, a raw-boned farm boy,
hails Iron) Clovis, California, a small
agricultural community in the San
Joaquin Valley.
Against I lie Dons last Saturday,
Merrinian further substantiated
liis claim for ail-American honors
by collecting 15(1 yards from
scrimmage, at least 5(1 of which
were gained with opponents
hanging onto him. In addition he
threw a 30-yard pass on the dead
run which landed in the arms of
Dave DeSwarte. This pass, which
set up Stanford's second touch
down, was the first that Lloyd had
ever thrown in college competi
tion.
To fulfill his reputation as a tri
ple-threat man, Merrinian did his
team's punting for an average of
over 40 yards.
Although he had no opportunity
against the Dons to prove it, Merri
nian is one of the Indian's best pass
receivers. On defense he is a sharp
and deadly tackier and an expert
pass defender. In fact there is no
phase of football at which he does
not excell.

Lloyd first came to Stanford as a
freshman in the fall of 1942 at the
age of 18. He soon lived up to his
reputation as a fine athlete by lead
ing the Papoose football team to an
undefeated season. The following
spring, still as a freshman, he made
a letter playing first base and out
field on the varsity baseball team.
Shortly thereafter he was sworn
into the navy. While stationed at
the Norman (Okla.) Naval Air
Base, Lloyd played first string
fullback for the Oklahoma
"Zoomers" service team, an ag
gregation which included many
college and professional stars.
On his return to the Stanford
campus last spring he took up where
he left off two years earlier by lead
ing the Indian baseball nine in hit
ting and slugging.
This fall, although he has not had
the pre-season buildup given Herm
Uedemeyer, Doc Blanchard, Glenn
Davis, Bob Fenimore, and Harry
Gilmer, Merriman will be picked on
more than one all-American team if
lie continues at the pace he has
started.
Before we close this, it should be
stated that the handsome fullback is
not married, but he does like girls
and chocolate eclairs.
(The sports editor, he whom they
don't make 'em any lazier than, has
-11 I written his column for today. So
instead we give yon something for
your dough that's probably more in
teresting than anything Smiley
would have to say this morning.)
