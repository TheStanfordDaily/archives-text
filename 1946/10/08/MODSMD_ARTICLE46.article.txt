LITTLE WAYNE ERICKSON (2) rips off seven yards against the
big and burly U.S.F. Dons Saturday afternoon, while Pete August moves
in to take out Harmon Howe (110) on a block. Ed Kaminsky (24) comes
up to make the stop on Wayne as the Indians drive for their second

touchdown in the second quarter. Shortly after the above play, both
I August and Kaminsky were removed from the game as a result of in
juries.
