## 
### 
With a convincing 21-0 win over
a heavily favored Humboldt State
outfit under their belts, Stanford's
Junior Varsity footballers have two
weeks to rest before their game with
the Santa Clara B's on October 19.
Coach Ed Stamm's underdog jay
vees looked good in easily outscor
ing the Lumberjacks from Hum
boldt. The Indians' ball handling
was greatly improved over the
Santa Rosa game, and the line was
charging harder and faster.
The jayvees, who have been dog
ged by costly injuries all season,
came out of the Humboldt tilt un
damaged. Jim Dooley, Norm Lat
tin, and Bob Ghilotti, who all missed
the northern trip, are expected to
be back in the lineup for the Santa
Clara game; however Paul Kent's
chipped ankle is still a question
mark, and it may keep him- on the
bench for the rest of the season.
Stamm has a hard two weeks
practice grind planned for his
charges, with a possible scrimmage
later in the week to give the boys
a chance to brush up on their new
est T-tricks.
