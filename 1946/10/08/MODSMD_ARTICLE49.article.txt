# Indians Prep for Bruins; Bowl of Roses in Offing
## 
### LOU FLEMING 
Stanford's contest Saturday with UCLA took on renewed significance
after the Indians' impressive triumph over USF, for with that victory over
a team rated high nationally by the pigskin professors, the odds on Stan
ford to win the Pacific Coast Conference went way up.
There are few dissenting votes as far as rating the Bruins as Rose Bowl
favorites, although Coach "Clipper"

Smith of USF said, "I think Stan
ford has the best football team on
the West Coast—bar none," at the
northern California pigskin writers'
luncheon in San Francisco Monday.
With that in mind, the Indian
mentor, Marchie Schwartz, will
throw everything his team has at
the Bruins, shooting for the stars if
not the Bowl of Roses.
Marchie had words of wisdom
himself at the Monday luncheon.
"The UCLA Bruins' football team
may become as outstanding in the
nation this year as Army was in
1945. My scouts report that the
Bruins haven't got a weakness.
They have an outstanding line
and one of the finest backfields in
the country."
All of which agrees with Ralph
Welch, University of Washington
coach, who muttered that there was
"not a visible weakness" in UCLA's
team after Washington fell before a
39-13 Bruin attack last Saturday.
But Coach Marchie is not a long
winded gent; replacing words with
action, he paced his team through a
rugged two-hour drill here Monday.
Missing from the lineup was Jim
Cox, first-string left tackle, who
was injured in Saturday's game.
Cox will be benched for an estimat
ed five weeks with a chipped bone
in his foot. Also out of action were
three other USF game casualties:
Pete August, with a torn ligament
in his leg; Jim Clark and Ainsley
Bell. August has but a slim chance
of plying in the Los Angeles game,
but Clark and Bell will probably be
ready.
In a re-shuffling of talent, Mar
chie advanced Bob Regier. San Luis
Obispo freshman, from the jayvees
to varsity center. Buddy Scott and
Charlie Wakefield traded tackle po
sitions, Wakefield going to the right

side of the line. Marty Feldman will
i take left guard slot.
With the accent on the pass at
i tack, the varsity drilled primarily
i on their aerials Monday. Not until
I the sun had set and the floodlights
i illuminated the practice gridiron did
I Marchie shift attention to the
j ground offense.
In all, it was a sloppy drill with
the Blue Monday doldrums af
fecting the throw-and-catch lads
| most. The Big Red Machine look
ed very small and observers had
I a hard time believing it was the
same "machine" that had rolled
up 78 points to the opponent's 7.
But with four more days of drill
left before the Redshirts board the
! train Friday night for their date in
Los Angeles, Marchie has time to
j smooth out the rough spots and get
j the team in shape for the game that,
I more than any other, will mean the
) Rose Bowl—yes or no.

j scribes' luncheon: "We aren't going
j down there to take a licking. . . ."

I more than any other, will mean the
) Rose Bowl—yes or no.
« Quoth the Indian mentor to the
j scribes' luncheon: "We aren't going
j down there to take a licking. . . ."
Stanford's contest Saturday with UCLA took on renewed significance
after the Indians' impressive triumph over USF, for with that victory over
a team rated high nationally by the pigskin professors, the odds on Stan
ford to win the Pacific Coast Conference went way up.
There are few dissenting votes as far as rating the Bruins as Rose Bowl
favorites, although Coach "Clipper"

Smith of USF said, "I think Stan
ford has the best football team on
the West Coast—bar none," at the
northern California pigskin writers'
luncheon in San Francisco Monday.
With that in mind, the Indian
mentor, Marchie Schwartz, will
throw everything his team has at
the Bruins, shooting for the stars if
not the Bowl of Roses.
Marchie had words of wisdom
himself at the Monday luncheon.
"The UCLA Bruins' football team
may become as outstanding in the
nation this year as Army was in
1945. My scouts report that the
Bruins haven't got a weakness.
They have an outstanding line
and one of the finest backfields in
the country."
All of which agrees with Ralph
Welch, University of Washington
coach, who muttered that there was
"not a visible weakness" in UCLA's
team after Washington fell before a
39-13 Bruin attack last Saturday.
But Coach Marchie is not a long
winded gent; replacing words with
action, he paced his team through a
rugged two-hour drill here Monday.
Missing from the lineup was Jim
Cox, first-string left tackle, who
was injured in Saturday's game.
Cox will be benched for an estimat
ed five weeks with a chipped bone
in his foot. Also out of action were
three other USF game casualties:
Pete August, with a torn ligament
in his leg; Jim Clark and Ainsley
Bell. August has but a slim chance
of plying in the Los Angeles game,
but Clark and Bell will probably be
ready.
In a re-shuffling of talent, Mar
chie advanced Bob Regier. San Luis
Obispo freshman, from the jayvees
to varsity center. Buddy Scott and
Charlie Wakefield traded tackle po
sitions, Wakefield going to the right

side of the line. Marty Feldman will
i take left guard slot.
With the accent on the pass at
i tack, the varsity drilled primarily
i on their aerials Monday. Not until
I the sun had set and the floodlights
i illuminated the practice gridiron did
I Marchie shift attention to the
j ground offense.
In all, it was a sloppy drill with
the Blue Monday doldrums af
fecting the throw-and-catch lads
| most. The Big Red Machine look
ed very small and observers had
I a hard time believing it was the
same "machine" that had rolled
up 78 points to the opponent's 7.
But with four more days of drill
left before the Redshirts board the
! train Friday night for their date in
Los Angeles, Marchie has time to
j smooth out the rough spots and get
j the team in shape for the game that,
I more than any other, will mean the
) Rose Bowl—yes or no.
