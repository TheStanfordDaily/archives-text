# Water Polo Team Ready
## 
### 
"I'm absolutely sure we'll do very
! well. It's pretty early for comment,
| but from what I've seen in the pool
| our team should outswim any club
jit meets."
These words of confidence came
; from Ernie Brandsten, who—along
I with Tom Haynie — is coaching
Stanford's current crop of water
I poloists.
"Our team," continued Coach
I Brandsten, "is very fast—especially
the backfield. Almost every man on
I the first squad has lettered in water
| polo either here or at some other
■ institution."
Coach Brandsten will soon have
opportunity to see if his optimism is
justified. The water polo team will
meet the Olympic Club Wednesday
i night in San Francisco and then
over the week-end it will play USC
and UCLA in Los Angeles. The
Winged-'' was beaten by Cal last
i week and shouldn't prove too tough
for the local talent. But as Brand
, sten said:
"Wednesday night I'll know just
what sort of a team we will have."
The squad is led by Capt. Em
! mett Cashin, who lettered in water
polo at Stanford in '42.
The tentative first-string lineup
! for Wednesday night's opener is as
follows:
Forwards: Emmett Cashin, A 1
Weeden, Dick Narver.
Guards: Harry Borchers, Fim
Armstrong, Duncan Patty.
Goalie: Bud Carpenter.
