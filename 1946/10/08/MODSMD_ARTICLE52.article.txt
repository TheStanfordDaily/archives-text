# Brecheen Claws Sox 3-0: Series Tied
## 
### 
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 7 (UP). —Harry
(The Cat) Brecheen, a sad-faced
southpaw with a cunning curve,
stilled the thundering bats of the
Boston Red Sox with a four hitter
today as he pitched and batted the
St. Louis Cardinals to a 3 to 0 tri
umph which squared the World Se
ries at one game all.
Calm and deliberate all the way
after being greeted rudely by a base
hit off his first pitch, the little tiger
of the Cardinal pitching corps got
stronger as the game progressed—
and batted home the only run he
was to need in the third inning.
And sharing honors with the tiny
tosser from Broken Bow. Okla., was
angular Del Rice, a young relief
catcher who came up with two im
portant hits and scored two runs in
his first World Series appearance.
They teamed up—on offense and
defense—to shut off those husky
Boston belters and provide the win
ning punch which thrilled a shirt
sleeved, roaring crowd of 35,815
tense fans who hung on every pitch
as Brecheen worked his way to vic
tory inning by inning.
lie had them over a barrel, and
lie never let them up. That sweep

in# curve hull had Ted Williams
and his mates hacking away from
the plate, only to find with sheep
ish surprise that it had cut in
through the heart of the dish. And
his stunning screwball was whip
ping down the middle and duck
ing under their bats.
Never through the heated Na
tional League pennant chase in
which he won 15 and lost 15 —five
of his victories by shutouts—did the
Cat have more stuff. His control
was amazing as he blew down those
Red Sox with the bats as big as vio
lins, all through the warm, sunny
afternoon. He stood there, peering
into ihe sunlight at his young pard
ner behind the mask, and then cut
loose with pitches they couldn't fol
low.
Moving with the silken agility of
a cat, Brecheen issued only three
walks all day. Two of them went to
Rudy York, the Cherokee clouter
from Alabama, who broke up the
first game of the series yesterday
with a tenth-inning homerun. The
rest of them he handcuffed, fanning
the mighty Williams once and forc
ing him to pop up three times as the
Boston kid swung once with such

vehemence that his bat slipped from
his hands and sailed 75 feet into the
Boston dugout.
It was only right, too, that Bre
cheen should bat home the big run
—the only one he was going to need.
It came in the third inning, as
Harry The Cat laced out a run-scor
ing single which sent Rice scamper
ing home from second and tagged
Mickey Harris with the defeat.
He didn't look long. The 24-year
old receiver from Portsmouth. Ohio,
had been looking at better pitches
from behind his mask and he laced
a double into right field.
Then came The Cat. He tried to
lay down a sacrifice bunt and failed.
So Harry, with two strikes on him,
leveled on Harris' next pitch and
slammed it into right field as Rice
came roaring home with the big one.
Infield outs moved Brecheen to
third and although he didn't score
it was going to be enough.
Tomorrow is an open date with
the teams traveling to Boston where
the third game of the series will be
played at Fenway Park on Wednes
day.

and batted home the only run he
was to need in the third inning.
And sharing honors with the tiny
tosser from Broken Bow. Okla., was
angular Del Rice, a young relief
catcher who came up with two im
portant hits and scored two runs in
his first World Series appearance.
They teamed up—on offense and
defense—to shut off those husky
Boston belters and provide the win
ning punch which thrilled a shirt
sleeved, roaring crowd of 35,815
tense fans who hung on every pitch
as Brecheen worked his way to vic
tory inning by inning.
lie had them over a barrel, and
lie never let them up. That sweep

in# curve hull had Ted Williams
and his mates hacking away from
the plate, only to find with sheep
ish surprise that it had cut in
through the heart of the dish. And
his stunning screwball was whip
ping down the middle and duck
ing under their bats.
Never through the heated Na
tional League pennant chase in
which he won 15 and lost 15 —five
of his victories by shutouts—did the
Cat have more stuff. His control
was amazing as he blew down those
Red Sox with the bats as big as vio
lins, all through the warm, sunny
afternoon. He stood there, peering
into ihe sunlight at his young pard
ner behind the mask, and then cut
loose with pitches they couldn't fol
low.
Moving with the silken agility of
a cat, Brecheen issued only three
walks all day. Two of them went to
Rudy York, the Cherokee clouter
from Alabama, who broke up the
first game of the series yesterday
with a tenth-inning homerun. The
rest of them he handcuffed, fanning
the mighty Williams once and forc
ing him to pop up three times as the
Boston kid swung once with such

vehemence that his bat slipped from
his hands and sailed 75 feet into the
Boston dugout.
It was only right, too, that Bre
cheen should bat home the big run
—the only one he was going to need.
It came in the third inning, as
Harry The Cat laced out a run-scor
ing single which sent Rice scamper
ing home from second and tagged
Mickey Harris with the defeat.
He didn't look long. The 24-year
old receiver from Portsmouth. Ohio,
had been looking at better pitches
from behind his mask and he laced
a double into right field.
Then came The Cat. He tried to
lay down a sacrifice bunt and failed.
So Harry, with two strikes on him,
leveled on Harris' next pitch and
slammed it into right field as Rice
came roaring home with the big one.
Infield outs moved Brecheen to
third and although he didn't score
it was going to be enough.
Tomorrow is an open date with
the teams traveling to Boston where
the third game of the series will be
played at Fenway Park on Wednes
day.
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 7 (UP). —Harry
(The Cat) Brecheen, a sad-faced
southpaw with a cunning curve,
stilled the thundering bats of the
Boston Red Sox with a four hitter
today as he pitched and batted the
St. Louis Cardinals to a 3 to 0 tri
umph which squared the World Se
ries at one game all.

hit off his first pitch, the little tiger
of the Cardinal pitching corps got
