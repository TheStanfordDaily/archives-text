# W.S.S.F. Plans Extensive Drive For Europe's Desolate Students
## 
### MARY VIRGINIA POND 
"The factor most damaging to Eu
ropean student life, outside of actual
material losses, is the five to six
years of virtually complete isolation
of the students from the outside
world."
This was part of the report from
Jim Glasse, traveling secretary for
World Student Service Fund and
graduate of Occidental, and Mary
Ann Nichols, Mills student, who
traveled in Europe this summer for

| the organization. W.S.S.F. is hold
j ing its annual fall conference at
Stanford this Saturday from 3 until
9 p.m. in the Education Building.
STUDENTS OF DESPAIR
"The European students repre
sent a generation of despair," Glasse
and Miss Nichols added. "They
don't know who are their friends."
By way of actual condition, they
reported, each university has its
own special situation. The students
1 are generally living below subsis

tence level. This winter will begin
to show the result of five years of
little or no food except bread, po
tatoes, and water, no fuel, little
clothing and housing.
UNIVERSITIES DESOLATE
In Holland the University of Ley
den still stands, but it is completely
empty. The Germans took every
thing. Many of the buildings are
that way—still standing but in real
ity mere shells. A good medical
school is one which has one micro
scope for every 100 students.
In Poland 40 per cent of the stu
dents are tubercular. In Greece it
is 20 per cent. They live 10, 20, 30
in a room, and half of them will be
tubercular. They have no bedding
and hardly any clothes.
In view of this situation, the
World Student Service Fund is
making plans to conduct W.S.S.F.
drives on college and university
campuses all up and down the Pa
cific Coast.
FIVE MILLION GOAL
Geneva headquarters has esti
mated that conditions in Europe
and Asia call for a five-million-dol
lar goal, over two million dollars for
last year.
It is the response of American
students to this drive that will fur
nish the books, pens, and paper
which are practically non-existent
in Europe, the food, clothing and
medical supplies to fellow students
abroad.

This was part of the report from
Jim Glasse, traveling secretary for
World Student Service Fund and
graduate of Occidental, and Mary
Ann Nichols, Mills student, who
traveled in Europe this summer for

| the organization. W.S.S.F. is hold
j ing its annual fall conference at
Stanford this Saturday from 3 until
9 p.m. in the Education Building.
STUDENTS OF DESPAIR
"The European students repre
sent a generation of despair," Glasse
and Miss Nichols added. "They
don't know who are their friends."
By way of actual condition, they
reported, each university has its
own special situation. The students
1 are generally living below subsis

tence level. This winter will begin
to show the result of five years of
little or no food except bread, po
tatoes, and water, no fuel, little
clothing and housing.
UNIVERSITIES DESOLATE
In Holland the University of Ley
den still stands, but it is completely
empty. The Germans took every
thing. Many of the buildings are
that way—still standing but in real
ity mere shells. A good medical
school is one which has one micro
scope for every 100 students.
In Poland 40 per cent of the stu
dents are tubercular. In Greece it
is 20 per cent. They live 10, 20, 30
in a room, and half of them will be
tubercular. They have no bedding
and hardly any clothes.
In view of this situation, the
World Student Service Fund is
making plans to conduct W.S.S.F.
drives on college and university
campuses all up and down the Pa
cific Coast.
FIVE MILLION GOAL
Geneva headquarters has esti
mated that conditions in Europe
and Asia call for a five-million-dol
lar goal, over two million dollars for
last year.
It is the response of American
students to this drive that will fur
nish the books, pens, and paper
which are practically non-existent
in Europe, the food, clothing and
medical supplies to fellow students
abroad.
