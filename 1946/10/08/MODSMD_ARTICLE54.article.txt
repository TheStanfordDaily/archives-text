# European Co-operation Favored By Poles in Revived Culture
## 
### ALAN STRAIN 
(This is the fourth in a series of
live articles.)
The night before we left Poland
on our return voyage, we had a
chance to see another facet of Polish
life when we attended a symphony
concert. The audience was in many
ways such as one might see at a
concert in this country, drawing its
members largely from the middle
and upper classes.
The concert was given by the
Baltic Philharmonic Symphony
Orchestra, which had just recent
ly been reorganized. The program
took place in an open air amphi
theater set in the midst of a
woods. It was very well attended
even though the better scats ran
to $2.50 in American money.
The people were noticeably well
dressed judged by present-day Pol
ish standards, though in our coun
try they would have gone unno
ticed. Their clothes, though old,
were clean and neatly pressed and
the people wore them with an air of
unostentatious refinement.
The performance, made up en
tirely of Polish selections, was very
well presented. The people were
politely enthusiastic in their ap
plause, and we came away feeling
that Polish music and "culture" were
still very much alive.
DESIRE UNITY
In talking with Polish people we
were repeatedly impressed by the
people's earnest desire for interna
tional co-operation. Many expressed
a desire for a "United States of Eu
rope." Almost without exception
they favored a strong and stable in
ternational organization.
As one Pole pill it. "You must
make propaganda for it in your
country—strong, open propagan
da!" He hoped, as did others, that
the United States would use its
full influence to secure the co
operation of all countries in the
establishment of a world govern
ment. He felt that while UNRRA
has helped in some ways to se
cure the support and co-operation
of war-stricken countries, it was
"too silent" a form of propagan
da. "Some people are dumb," lie
remarked "They don't think, they
only take!"
Many of those whom we talked
with believed that the people them
selves of various countries can get
along; that disagreements grow out
of bad government and tradition

bound ideas of government. If the j
people we talked to were typical !
Poles, it seems that the people of j
Poland, at least, would have no ob
jection to a United Europe.
POLISH STUDENT
One evening during our stay, we
visited with a Polish student who
was working part of the time un
loading our ship. He spent the eve
ning with us and told us something :
of the difficulties which he faces in
getting an education in today's Po
land.
As hLs knowledge of English was
almost as scanty as our knowledge
of Polish, we conversed in French J
and German which he and some of
our group could speak brokenly. We
learned that books and school sup
plies are all but non-existent in
Poland. Teachers and laboratory
equipment are sorely needed. As he
was very anxious to have some
reading material in English, we gave i
him what we had around, a few ;
novels and some Reader's Digests.
He was very appreciative of these
few things.
lie expressed the hope that an
exchange student program could '
be worked out between America
and Poland. He was quite enthu
siastic about the idea and hoped
that he himself could sometime
come to America to study.

In talking with Polish people we
were repeatedly impressed by the
people's earnest desire for interna
tional co-operation. Many expressed
a desire for a "United States of Eu
rope." Almost without exception
they favored a strong and stable in
ternational organization.
As one Pole pill it. "You must
make propaganda for it in your
country—strong, open propagan
da!" He hoped, as did others, that
the United States would use its
full influence to secure the co
operation of all countries in the
establishment of a world govern
ment. He felt that while UNRRA
has helped in some ways to se
cure the support and co-operation
of war-stricken countries, it was
"too silent" a form of propagan
da. "Some people are dumb," lie
remarked "They don't think, they
only take!"
Many of those whom we talked
with believed that the people them
selves of various countries can get
along; that disagreements grow out
of bad government and tradition

bound ideas of government. If the j
people we talked to were typical !
Poles, it seems that the people of j
Poland, at least, would have no ob
jection to a United Europe.
POLISH STUDENT
One evening during our stay, we
visited with a Polish student who
was working part of the time un
loading our ship. He spent the eve
ning with us and told us something :
of the difficulties which he faces in
getting an education in today's Po
land.
As hLs knowledge of English was
almost as scanty as our knowledge
of Polish, we conversed in French J
and German which he and some of
our group could speak brokenly. We
learned that books and school sup
plies are all but non-existent in
Poland. Teachers and laboratory
equipment are sorely needed. As he
was very anxious to have some
reading material in English, we gave i
him what we had around, a few ;
novels and some Reader's Digests.
He was very appreciative of these
few things.
lie expressed the hope that an
exchange student program could '
be worked out between America
and Poland. He was quite enthu
siastic about the idea and hoped
that he himself could sometime
come to America to study.
(This is the fourth in a series of
live articles.)
The night before we left Poland
on our return voyage, we had a
chance to see another facet of Polish
life when we attended a symphony
concert. The audience was in many
ways such as one might see at a
concert in this country, drawing its
members largely from the middle
and upper classes.
The concert was given by the
Baltic Philharmonic Symphony
Orchestra, which had just recent
ly been reorganized. The program
took place in an open air amphi
theater set in the midst of a
woods. It was very well attended
even though the better scats ran
to $2.50 in American money.
The people were noticeably well
dressed judged by present-day Pol
ish standards, though in our coun
try they would have gone unno
ticed. Their clothes, though old,
were clean and neatly pressed and
the people wore them with an air of
unostentatious refinement.
The performance, made up en
tirely of Polish selections, was very
well presented. The people were
politely enthusiastic in their ap
plause, and we came away feeling
that Polish music and "culture" were
still very much alive.
