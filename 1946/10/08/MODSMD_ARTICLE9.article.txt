# 130-Mile Wind Lashes Florida
## 
### 
MIAMI, Oct. 7 (UP;.â€”A howling
hurricane with winds up to 130 miles
an hour roared in on the resort area
of Florida's west coast tonight after
leaving a trail of death and destruc
tion in western Cuba.
The full fury of the tropical storm
was expected to strike between Fort
Meyers and the Tampa Bay area
around midnight but already tor
rents of rain, winds of gale velocity
and high tides were pounding the
coast between that city and Tampa,
50 miles to the north.
Thousands of persons evacuated
their homes on the low western
beaches and sought refuge in cities.
Stores in Fort Meyers, Tampa, Sara
sota and St. Petersburg were closed
and boarded up. Schools were
closed. Red Cross, Army, Navy and
civilian agencies were on a "stand
by" alert.
In the path of the storm, which
was 70 miles west-southwest of Fort
Meyers at 8 p.m., EST, lay the rich
citrus belt of Florida, bearing what
growers hope will be $250,000,000
of oranges, 'grapefruit and tanger
ines. The storm center was expect
ed to pass between the state's two
vegetable belts.
