# Kardelj Flays Pact for Italy
## 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 8 (UP).—Yugoslav Vice-Premier Eduard Kardelj
tonight accused Britain and the United States of deliberately split
ting the Peace Conference in order to impose their will on the
Soviet bloc minority.
Kardelj scathingly attacked the Anglo-Americans for insincer-

ity in peace-making and for impe-"
rialist international scheming. He
reiterated that Yugoslavia never
would sign the Italian treaty as it
stands because it deprived Yugo
slavia of her "just rights."
RENEWED ATTACK
The renewed Yugoslav attack on
the western powers came at a night
plenary session of the conference,
preceding an article by article vote
on the Italian treaty, including the
issue of an independent Trieste, to
morrow.
Kardelj was recognized by Rus
sian Foreign Minister Viacheslav M.
Molotov, acting as chairman, after
Molotov himself had passed up his
scheduled piace in the speaking.

I'AKIS, Oct. S (UP).—Russian
Foreign Minister Viacheslav M.
Molotov has delayed by one day
bis scheduled address before the
Paris Peace Conference in which
a modification of the Soviet stand
may be announced as the result of
conferences with Prime Minister
Josef Stalin, it was made known
tonight.
Molotov will address the con
ference tomorrow morning as the
last speaker before the plcnry
session begins voting rticle by
article on the controversial Italian
treaty, including the issue of an
independent government for Tri
este.
Scheduled to speak today for
the first time since his return from
a four-day conference with Stalin
in Moscow, Molotov yielded his j
place to other members of the So- j
vict bloc and held oft' for the last
word on the Italian treaty.
There was no indication of a
change in the attitude of Russia's j
satellites when Molotov opened
the night session as chairman at |
!):40 p.m. lie immediately recog- j
ni/.ed Yugoslav Vice-Premier Ed
uard Kardelj as the first speaker.

It had been hoped that Molotov
might indicate some modification of
the Soviet stand as a result of four
days of conversations with Prime |
Minister Josef Stalin in Moscow, but
the Yugoslav attack seemed to doom |
hope of compromise.
Kardelj was especially angry
about the United States proposal
which obligates Yugoslavia to grant
basic human rights to peoples in
ceded territory. He said it was in- i
suiting to force an ally to write such
an obligation into a treaty with an
enemy.
ITALIAN REPARATIONS
Kardelj said lie could not agree
to accept only $100,000,000 in repa
rations from Italy. He charged that
this figure had been imposed on
Yugoslavia by the western powers
who themselves had been assured
of full indemnity in other clauses of
the treaty.
United States Delegate Willard j
Thorp, final American speaker, an- [
swercd Kardelj's attack on the rep- |
arations clauses by saying $325,000,- i
000 was the "limit of Italian capacity |
to pay."

Molotov will address the con
ference tomorrow morning as the
last speaker before the plcnry
session begins voting rticle by
article on the controversial Italian
treaty, including the issue of an
independent government for Tri
este.
Scheduled to speak today for
the first time since his return from
a four-day conference with Stalin
in Moscow, Molotov yielded his j
place to other members of the So- j
vict bloc and held oft' for the last
word on the Italian treaty.
There was no indication of a
change in the attitude of Russia's j
satellites when Molotov opened
the night session as chairman at |
!):40 p.m. lie immediately recog- j
ni/.ed Yugoslav Vice-Premier Ed
uard Kardelj as the first speaker.

It had been hoped that Molotov
might indicate some modification of
the Soviet stand as a result of four
days of conversations with Prime |
Minister Josef Stalin in Moscow, but
the Yugoslav attack seemed to doom |
hope of compromise.
Kardelj was especially angry
about the United States proposal
which obligates Yugoslavia to grant
basic human rights to peoples in
ceded territory. He said it was in- i
suiting to force an ally to write such
an obligation into a treaty with an
enemy.
ITALIAN REPARATIONS
Kardelj said lie could not agree
to accept only $100,000,000 in repa
rations from Italy. He charged that
this figure had been imposed on
Yugoslavia by the western powers
who themselves had been assured
of full indemnity in other clauses of
the treaty.
United States Delegate Willard j
Thorp, final American speaker, an- [
swercd Kardelj's attack on the rep- |
arations clauses by saying $325,000,- i
000 was the "limit of Italian capacity |
to pay."
PARIS, Oct. 8 (UP).—Yugoslav Vice-Premier Eduard Kardelj
tonight accused Britain and the United States of deliberately split
ting the Peace Conference in order to impose their will on the
Soviet bloc minority.
Kardelj scathingly attacked the Anglo-Americans for insincer-

ity in peace-making and for impe-"
rialist international scheming. He
reiterated that Yugoslavia never
would sign the Italian treaty as it
stands because it deprived Yugo
slavia of her "just rights."
RENEWED ATTACK
The renewed Yugoslav attack on
the western powers came at a night
plenary session of the conference,
preceding an article by article vote
on the Italian treaty, including the
issue of an independent Trieste, to
morrow.
Kardelj was recognized by Rus
sian Foreign Minister Viacheslav M.
Molotov, acting as chairman, after
Molotov himself had passed up his
scheduled piace in the speaking.
