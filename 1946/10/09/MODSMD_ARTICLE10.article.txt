Calls from Ram's Head could still
he heard coming from Memorial
Hall. Boh Ashley, director of (he
Gaieties, need.s skits and skit ideas
badly. Ashley particularly hopes
that individual living groups will be
able to work up their own skits with
the co-operation of Ram's Head.
"We've got plenty of songs, but
we have to have some funny situ
ations to put between them," Ash
ley said.
The theme of the Gaieties is the
life of an amnesia victim on the
Stanford campus—how he gets there
and what he does. This general out
line is supposed to b" filled by skits
which should parody the typical
Hollywood psychological thriller.
Tentative plans for the pre-Big
Game production include the pres
ence of a 15-piece professional or
chestra from San Francisco. It will
be directed by Art McCuo, Stanford
158, who is now playing at the Fair
mont Hotel's "Cirque Room."
"We intend to bring the Gaieties
back to the campus and what goes
on here," said Ashley. "But we
need the skits about the campus by
those most familiar with it — the
students."
Skit deadline is Friday, Oct. 11.
Acting tryouts are on Oct. 16 and
17, dancing tryouts the 18th. Sing
ers will try out on Oct. 21 and 22.
Stage crew hopefuls will be wel
comed at any time.
