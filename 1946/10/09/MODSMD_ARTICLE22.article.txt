## The 						Right Step

In today's paper is an inconspicuous an
nouncement of appointments to the student
faculty committee of Memorial Church. Its
implications are obscure to the majority of
readers, but should bring joy to the various
student religious groups on campus as indica
tive of a more healthy and positive approach
to reliqious problems than has been main
tained in Ihe past.
This committee has been set up to sponsor
discussions among students of all denomina
tion , to sponsor speakers explaining specific
faiths, and to aid students in finding a satis
factory answer to problems of worship at
Stanford's own church.
Members of the committee will also help
Chaplain Hall in selecting the subject for his
weekly sermons, to make them relevant to
<student interests.
Object of the committee will be to revive
interest in the church as the institution it was
intended to be the guiding spirit of the Uni
versity.
Emphasis in the past few years unfortu
nately has been not on instruction in religion
but on the restrictions which accompany the
church's and University's guarantee in the
founding grant to be non-denominational in

character. Students were aware of rules
against posters advertising their particular re
ligious group, against any activity which
could be labelled proselyting for membership,
against invitations to outside speakers to ad
dress members of their group. The Daily was
restricted in space allowed for announcement
of sectarian meetings.
At college age, and in a place where learn
ing is the residents' foremost occupation, stu
dents should be given every opportunity to
investigate and receive instruction in religion.
Through education, the barriers of intolerance
are destroyed; any restriction on religious ed
ucation, which was the effect of the now-dis
carded University policy, tends to accent in
tolerance among sectarian groups, and fights
for so-called "rights" of individual groups.
If members of every faith can be brought
together in common assembly to discuss their
religions, if all students can be encouraged to
seek information and understanding through
attendance at such meetings, the University's
non-sectarian ideal will stand on decidedly
firmer ground. We commend the University
in this step, and gratefully open our news
columns to advertisement of any all-campus
religious meetings.
