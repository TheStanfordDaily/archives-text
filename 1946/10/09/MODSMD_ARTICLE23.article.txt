«- .story of how one of our lads demonstrated
In u/iUty to cope with any and all situations with
out lu ing hi.s dignity has just reached me. The inci
d< nt occurred on a Southern California beach this'
summer and the manner in which he restrained
himseli from committing mayhem on a small child
is worthy of note even if there were nothing else to
the yarn.
Our hero was sprawled on the sand, soaking up
!;ome of the renowned sunshine of the Southland.
There arrived on the beach two doting parents with
their small brat, an obnoxious little thing two years
old, just barely learning to talk.
This repulsive little character immediately trot
ted off to the water's edge and scooped up a large
handful of sand. He made hi.s way back through the
crowd and dumped it into our hero's face, for some
reason known only to that fiendish infantile brain.
Showing remarkable self-control, our Farm lad
wi|-ed the sand from his eyes and said nothing. The
]<;.rents, sitting near by, howled gleefully at this
wonderful exhibition on their offspring's part.
Apparently encouraged, the toddler headed back
to the wet sand, scooped up another handful, and the
process was repeated. More self-control on our boy's
pari and more gales of laughter from the two par
ent. 1 ..
So once again the little dastard went through his
act. This time, our hero decided it was time some
thin" was done.
Ife took the little tyke by the arm and drew him
close. Then he whispered to him a nasty leetle four
letter Anglo-Saxon word. The infant repeated it. Our
boy said it several more times. The childish mind
picked it up and the kid began chanting it over and
over.
"Now," said our hero, "go toll Daddy," and then
:.:il back with a smile of satisfaction.
The brat trotted over to his proud parents and
began repeating the word over and over in his high
childish treble. Then he proceeded to start about
the beach, telling everybody hi.s new word.

At this point, his very red and embarrassed par
ents gathered their offspring to them and left the
beach. Our hero,a smug smile on his face and very
much master of the situation, went back to sleep, to
dream, no doubt, of the parents trying in vain to
stop their child from repeating the word to all and
sundry who came to visit with them in the future.
* * *
There s'-erns lo be quite a bit of disagreement
with hally Coin's policy of splitting up the rooting
section into lhal bane of all existence, two separate
sexes.
I was sitting in the lower right-hand corner of the
girls' section at the U.S.F. game and couldn't hear
the yelling too well because I was busy trying to
hold my feather in my hair and still keep my white
sweater and skirt bulging in all the orthodox places.
But it didn't seem as though the rooting Saturday
was as loud as at. the Idaho game. Was some of the
spirit destroyed by that segregation? Perhaps Freud
could explain it. 1 was too busy trying to fight off
a sailor to find the reason.
Everyone would undoubtedly be happier, how
ever, il we could mingle like crazy in the rooting
section, thereby avoiding much frustration.
Rally Com argues lhat for better card .stunts and
a more regular appearance of the section, the division
should be made. In all mixed rooting sections I've
been in, card stunts seemed to work all right. Be
sides, you can have more fun when the cheer leader
says "Down" and you all hide under your cards.
Huhba hubba!
As for appearance, the only great discrepancy
there seems to be that the fellows rooters' caps
and the girls don't. That's easy enough to solve if
more caps are available. It would entail a break with
tradition but so what? Put rooters' caps on the girls.
That would give the section an even appearance and
besides, those gals look pietty cute in them, any
how?
liow about it?

d< nt occurred on a Southern California beach this'
summer and the manner in which he restrained
himseli from committing mayhem on a small child
is worthy of note even if there were nothing else to
the yarn.
Our hero was sprawled on the sand, soaking up
!;ome of the renowned sunshine of the Southland.
There arrived on the beach two doting parents with
their small brat, an obnoxious little thing two years
old, just barely learning to talk.
This repulsive little character immediately trot
ted off to the water's edge and scooped up a large
handful of sand. He made hi.s way back through the
crowd and dumped it into our hero's face, for some
reason known only to that fiendish infantile brain.
Showing remarkable self-control, our Farm lad
wi|-ed the sand from his eyes and said nothing. The
]<;.rents, sitting near by, howled gleefully at this
wonderful exhibition on their offspring's part.
Apparently encouraged, the toddler headed back
to the wet sand, scooped up another handful, and the
process was repeated. More self-control on our boy's
pari and more gales of laughter from the two par
ent. 1 ..
So once again the little dastard went through his
act. This time, our hero decided it was time some
thin" was done.
Ife took the little tyke by the arm and drew him
close. Then he whispered to him a nasty leetle four
letter Anglo-Saxon word. The infant repeated it. Our
boy said it several more times. The childish mind
picked it up and the kid began chanting it over and
over.
"Now," said our hero, "go toll Daddy," and then
:.:il back with a smile of satisfaction.
The brat trotted over to his proud parents and
began repeating the word over and over in his high
childish treble. Then he proceeded to start about
the beach, telling everybody hi.s new word.

At this point, his very red and embarrassed par
ents gathered their offspring to them and left the
beach. Our hero,a smug smile on his face and very
much master of the situation, went back to sleep, to
dream, no doubt, of the parents trying in vain to
stop their child from repeating the word to all and
sundry who came to visit with them in the future.

There s'-erns lo be quite a bit of disagreement
with hally Coin's policy of splitting up the rooting
section into lhal bane of all existence, two separate
sexes.
I was sitting in the lower right-hand corner of the
girls' section at the U.S.F. game and couldn't hear
the yelling too well because I was busy trying to
hold my feather in my hair and still keep my white
sweater and skirt bulging in all the orthodox places.
But it didn't seem as though the rooting Saturday
was as loud as at. the Idaho game. Was some of the
spirit destroyed by that segregation? Perhaps Freud
could explain it. 1 was too busy trying to fight off
a sailor to find the reason.
Everyone would undoubtedly be happier, how
ever, il we could mingle like crazy in the rooting
section, thereby avoiding much frustration.
Rally Com argues lhat for better card .stunts and
a more regular appearance of the section, the division
should be made. In all mixed rooting sections I've
been in, card stunts seemed to work all right. Be
sides, you can have more fun when the cheer leader
says "Down" and you all hide under your cards.
Huhba hubba!
As for appearance, the only great discrepancy
there seems to be that the fellows rooters' caps
and the girls don't. That's easy enough to solve if
more caps are available. It would entail a break with
tradition but so what? Put rooters' caps on the girls.
That would give the section an even appearance and
besides, those gals look pietty cute in them, any
how?
liow about it?
