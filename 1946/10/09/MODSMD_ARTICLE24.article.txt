DESIGN IN RUBBLE
This is about you and me. Students. Students in
China who moved their colleges thousands of miles
on their backs. Students who are now emerging
out of the wreck that was Europe to finish their edu
cation, to finish it lacking housing, food, professors,
books, health.
Reports: University of Warsaw 5)5 per cent
wrecked, 9.000 students living in dugouts, cellars,
huts, one-third of student body has TB, two-thirds
oi their professors died during the war, students
get one meal a day . . . reports: at Gdansk Medical
College less than one student in 15 has adequate
books; the labs have no supplies, need soap, alcohol,
disinfectants, towels . . . reports: Paris—Tß multi
plied tenfold during war; in Strassbourg students
live in an abandoned museum without windows or
furniture.
Reports: Viennese students live on 750 calories
a ilay (you eat more than that at ;t good breakfast),
have no flour, vegetables, meat, butter, or milk . . .
reports: a professor at Budapest gets 50 cents a
month; students "live in holes in the ground" . . . re
ports: in Greece students barely survive from day
to day. The reports go on endlessly.
What's this to you? Touching, of course. Too
bad. Thanks for telling me about it but I got to
make my class.
There's more to it than that. Hie students now

streaming back to school in the war-torn countries
of the world will be the doctors, the engineers, and,
above all, the leading citizens of their countries. If
doctors cannot be adequately trained thousands will
die needlessly. If there cannot be enough engineers
Europe will not be rebuilt.
II these students must rely entirely on their own
resources they will be only half-educated, they will
become bitter, disillusioned, dangerous. Their cyni
cism will pave the load to another war.
There is a world-wide organization, centered in
the United States, to provide essential student relief
and rehabilitation. It's the World Student Service
Fund, an organization of students to aid students.
During the war it aided 25,000 Chinese students
every year, sent 140,000 books to PW camps, helped
student refugees in all countries. In the first year of
liberation it launched relief programs in 15 European
nations.
World Student Service Fund needs 5 million dol
lars this year. That isn't so much when you consider
that we" in the United States spend almost 1 mil
lion dollars a year for fraternity fees and dues and
over ."'>B million dollars for football.
Student leaders from Northern California schools
and colleges will meet at Stanford Saturday to plan
a campaign to raise our share of those 5 million. The
drive will be held shortly afterward.
Thousands of students in all countries depend
on you for help. Don't let them down.

What's this to you? Touching, of course. Too
bad. Thanks for telling me about it but I got to
make my class.
There's more to it than that. Hie students now

streaming back to school in the war-torn countries
of the world will be the doctors, the engineers, and,
above all, the leading citizens of their countries. If
doctors cannot be adequately trained thousands will
die needlessly. If there cannot be enough engineers
Europe will not be rebuilt.
II these students must rely entirely on their own
resources they will be only half-educated, they will
become bitter, disillusioned, dangerous. Their cyni
cism will pave the load to another war.
There is a world-wide organization, centered in
the United States, to provide essential student relief
and rehabilitation. It's the World Student Service
Fund, an organization of students to aid students.
During the war it aided 25,000 Chinese students
every year, sent 140,000 books to PW camps, helped
student refugees in all countries. In the first year of
liberation it launched relief programs in 15 European
nations.
World Student Service Fund needs 5 million dol
lars this year. That isn't so much when you consider
that we" in the United States spend almost 1 mil
lion dollars a year for fraternity fees and dues and
over ."'>B million dollars for football.
Student leaders from Northern California schools
and colleges will meet at Stanford Saturday to plan
a campaign to raise our share of those 5 million. The
drive will be held shortly afterward.
Thousands of students in all countries depend
on you for help. Don't let them down.

China who moved their colleges thousands of miles

books, health.
