ing clubs yesterday according to an
announcement made by William H.

ing.
Ray Smith, Intercjub president,
was advised of the University's long
awaited decision at a short meeting

with Miller who
had been dele
gated by Dean
Stalnaker to in
vestigate the sit
uation.
Club members
will have their
tickets adjusted
within the next
few days so that
they can all en
ter through the

the reassignment of meal tickets.
With a seating capacity of 72, the
clubs are faced with a difficult sit
uation in regard to perpetuating the
organizations. The clubs at present
have a total of 70 members who can
eat on campus. This leaves no room
for new members.
Interclub Council will meet to
night at 7:15 in room 222. Toyon, to
discuss the University's decision
and make plans for club use of the I
single dining room.
Administration officials said that
it was impossible to give more j
than one room due to the turn
over during meal time when theo
retically each dining room in the
commons is used twice.
No announcement was made as
to the future policy in regard to the |
eating clubs. However, club mem
bers gained hope from a recent
speech by the President of the Uni
versity.
Dr. Tresidcler said, 'Stanford
will support anything that means
something to Stanford life."
The eating clubs have been ac
tive almost since the beginning of
the University, and were once aided
financially by Justice George Croth- I
crs who recently made donations to j
the Law School.
