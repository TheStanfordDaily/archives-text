# Debaters Argue Labor Issue
## 
### 
Holding that management should
seek the advice and opinions of la
bor to establish a necessary balance
between the two groups, Malcolm
Barrett yesterday advocated the af
firmative of the question: "Resolved:
that labor should be gtven a share in
the management of industry."
In a non-decision contest with
Bob Bennett before members of the
debate squad, Barrett maintained

that labor and management have
many common interests and that
his plan means neither socialism nor
a disruption of industrial efficiency,
but rather increased efficiency
through co-operation.
Plans were made at the squad
meeting to make special arrange
ments for debaters living at Stan
lord Village, with meetings to hi;
held there.
