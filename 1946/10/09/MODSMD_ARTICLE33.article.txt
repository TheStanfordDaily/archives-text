# Bill Hachten Will Lead Cardinals Against Bruins
## 
### LOU FLEMING 
Maybe it was the weather. As blue skies replaced Monday's
slate-gray sky, the Indian pigskinners rolled through their Tues
day drills with improved precision. In the semi-secret session,
Marchie Schwartz, Stanford head coach, paced the boys through
a routine of defense against UCLA plays as reported by the
Redskin scouts,

Hill Hachten, 204-pound guard
from Huntington Park, was nam
ed game captain for Saturday's
UCLA game at the Los Angeles
Coliseum. Hachten played on the
Stanford frosh team in 1042 and
was with the California squad in
'CI and '44. For his powerful jol>
in Stanford's opening game with
Idaho he was awarded the Keeble
Award as the Redskins' outstand

John Clark and Pete August were

Forty-six members of the team
will make the trip to Los Angeles
Friday. After a linal workout here
on the campus, they will board
the Lark late Friday evening. No
workouts in Los Angeles Satur
day have been scheduled.
ROSSI INTERESTS MARCIIIE
Marchie was obviously interested
in Cal Rossi, the sticky-fingered
Bruin pass retriever, as he worked
his team against UCLA plays. Rossi
has accounted for four of the
Bruins' scores this season, and three
of them he made by hauling Ernie
Case's aerials out of the ether.
The team polished up their own
passing attack in the first part of
Tuesday's drill. And unlike Mon
day's practice, which was blotted by
a hobbling bunch of catchers suffer
ing from the after-victory letdown,
the Injuns' fingers were holding on
to the ball. Marchie rotated the
hurling task among most of his
regular quarterbacks.

ROSSI INTERESTS MARCIIIE
Marchie was obviously interested
in Cal Rossi, the sticky-fingered
Bruin pass retriever, as he worked
his team against UCLA plays. Rossi
has accounted for four of the
Bruins' scores this season, and three
of them he made by hauling Ernie
Case's aerials out of the ether.
The team polished up their own
passing attack in the first part of
Tuesday's drill. And unlike Mon
