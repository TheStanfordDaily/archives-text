# Farm Net Tourney Begins This Week
## 
### 
Boasting a laige turnout of 67 un
dergraduate men, the University's
Singles Tennis Tournment gets un
der way this week under the guid
ance of Coach Elwyn C. Bugge.
Drawings for the tourney have
been posted on the bulletin board
in the Men's Gym, and Coach Bugge
reminds all entrants that the first
round matches have to be completed
by next Monday. It will be the re
sponsibility of each pair of oppo
nents to arrange their match time.
During the first three rounds each
loser will have to supply two tennis
balls, and one set will be the limit;
but starting with the round of six
teen men, the match will be two out
of three sets and each loser will
have to supply three balls.
Due to a sprinkling of good play
ers Coach Bugge was reluctant to
jiive out a complete seeding except
for the first four spots, which were
accorded to Arnie Beisser, Bob Rut
ledge, Dave Basham, and Dave Bar
bour. respectively.
