# Pop Warner— Always a Fan
## 
### STU MILLAR 
His day has passed. But not his
glory.
His years as a coach are gone.
But not the plays he invented.
Today he lives quietly in his Palo
Alto home and is just another sports
fan- —but one whose opinions are of
more than passing note.
He is Pop Warner, for years Stan
lord's head football coach. He is the
originator of the single and double
wingback formations.
Now as he watches the football
games and reads about others, he
sees the T-formalion at the peak
of its popularity—the T-formalion
that was brought to fame by a
more recent Stanford coach, Clark
Shaughnessy.
But he awaits the day when his
formations will once again be the
byword of the gridiron. He sees it
coming, and he's waiting.
STILL lIAS A SYSTEM
When I walked into Mr. Warner's
home not far from the Stanford
campus, I found a grayed, balding
man with a bad leg who was trying
to enjoy his life the same way he
taught others to play football—with
a system.
He sits in an overstuffed easy
chair with an ottoman on which
he props his bad left leg. On a
table next to him are the utensils
of his life ... a candybar or two,
the papers, some fruit, a few med
icine bottles, cigarettes, an ashtry
and a radio. He lives a regulated
life.
Pop likes to smoke and he smokes
like a Democrat—or one very fam
ous Democrat. He has a cigarette
holder that is similar if not an exact
duplicate of F.D.K.'s.
He lives in this house with his
wife, a pointer dog, and a white cat.
SPINS GOOD YARNS
Mr. Warner, who probably knows
more good yarns about the pigskin
sport than many sports editors
thrown together, told many stories
about the legendary ligures of the
decades he has lived through, and
of which he has been a vital part.
But make no mistake. He does
not live in the past. He is as acutely
aware of the happenings in today's
sporting scene as he ever was.
And just as he has his opinions of
events and people of another era,
he has his ideas about what's going
on today—and even on what's going
to happen.
He even predicted how the USF
game might come out even though
we warned him that this story
would be published after the
game. And he must admit—even
Pop underestimated the Stanford
team.
LIKES CARD TEAM
"Stanford students should be
proud of their team if they give San
Francisco a good, tough contest," he
said.
Pop was right even while being
wrong. Stanford did give USF a
good, tough contest.
And after the game when I saw
him. he said, smilingly. "I guess
maybe I missed a little on that
one. The Stanford team has real
possibilities of going a long way.
That tussle with UCLA down
south Saturday should be red hot.
I'd like to see that game."
Pop went on to praise Marchie
Schwartz as one of the best young
coaches in the nation. "Marchie did
a fine, polished job in '42 and he
doesn't seem to be doing so badly
this year.''
(To be concluded tomorrow.)
