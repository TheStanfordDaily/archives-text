# Cindermen Start Drills

### 
With nine lettermen and three
varsity members back from last
spring's track season, prospects
looked brighter this week for Stan
ford's coming cross country and
track sessions. Over 70 men have
turned out for fall practice, accord
ing to Jack Weiershauser, Indian
track coach.
Still stressing the importance of
early practice for all men interested
in any track event, Weiershauser
said he knew of at least lour good
prospects who have failed to draw
equipment as yet. "We are particu
larly weak in the javelin and high
jump," he said.
Several trackmen will not join
their fellow thinclads until after
football season. Among these are
sprinter Martin Anderson, captain
of Stanford's track team last year,
and discus man Dave DeSwarte, let -
terman last season.
Totalling up the returned let
termen, Weiershauser iisted Al
Holubar. cross country; George
Grimes, cross country and sprints;
Frank Ganahl. cross country; Bob
Iverson, cross country; Anderson,
sprints; AI Vierthaler, sprints and
hurdles; Al Wilkins, sprints; Kill
•Larson, jumps, and DeSwarte,
weights.
Ted Off and Carl Schoder, mem
bers of last season's varsity, are
back on the cross-country team and
John Campbell, broadjumper from
the varsity, has also returned.
These men will form the backbone
of the squads this year. A number
of newcomers have turned in times
that indicate the former varsity men
will be well backed up in all run
ning events. 11' the field event va
cancies are filled in, the Indians may
even be able to boast of a team
powerful in all departments.
