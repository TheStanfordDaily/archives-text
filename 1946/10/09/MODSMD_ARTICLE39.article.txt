With nine lettermen and three
varsity members back from last
spring's track season, prospects
looked brighter this week for Stan
ford's coming cross country and
track sessions. Over 70 men have
turned out for fall practice, accord
ing to Jack Weiershauser, Indian
track coach.
Still stressing the importance of
early practice for all men interested
in any track event, Weiershauser
said he knew of at least lour good
prospects who have failed to draw
equipment as yet. "We are particu
larly weak in the javelin and high
jump," he said.
Several trackmen will not join
their fellow thinclads until after
football season. Among these are
sprinter Martin Anderson, captain
of Stanford's track team last year,
and discus man Dave DeSwarte, let -
terman last season.

ning events. 11' the field event va
cancies are filled in, the Indians may
even be able to boast of a team
powerful in all departments.
