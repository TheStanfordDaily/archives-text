# Kiel Trip Reveals Pole Thriftiness
## 
### ALAN STRAIN 
(This concludes a series of live
articles.)
On our way to and from Poland
we traveled through the Kiel Canal,
which cuts across northern Ger
many. The canal's 70-mile channel
joins the North Sea with the Baltic.
We spent about an hour in the locks
at each end of the canal and got a
chance to talk with some of the
men who hang around the locks to
barter with the crews of ships pass
ing through.
Civilians are not too well
clothed, but as in the past, mili
tary uniforms are well tailored,
clean, and plentiful. There seems
to be a uniformed ollicial to handle
every detail of maritime red tape.
The uniformed men carry them
selves with an air of assurance
and seem to be respected by the
people. Some of them sport neat
ly clipped "brush" mustaches.
One gets the impression that to
the people, the "military" still
have god-like stature.
The canal passes like a highway
through the German countryside
and villages. The countryside re
flects the people's liking for orderli
ness. There is little evidence of
bombing outside of one oil refinery
and some sub pens which were de
stroyed. Almost all available land
appears to be in use; there seems to
be virtually no wasted space. Prob
ably the neatness and thriftiness of
the countryside is an indication that
the situation in northern Germany
demands that nothing be wasted.
VALUE ON SOAP
In Germany, as in Poland, the
people value highly certain items
which they have discovered Ameri
cans have in some quantity. Thus
around the locks men beg for soap,
cigarettes, candy, and fruit, and
most of the bartering is conducted
in terms of packs and cartons of
cigarettes. A number of times as

we were going through the canal
gangs of children began to run
alongside the ship calling for ciga
rettes, chocolate, gum, and oranges.
Sometimes the more hardy mem
bers of these groups would run be
side the ship for nearly a mile.
The trip home was uneventful
outside of five days of shoveling
and washing out stalls. We were
really glad when the ship was
cleaned up and we had a few days
to loaf.
Galveston, where we docked,
looked like heaven after some of
tlie cities we had seen. It seemed
almost strange to see so many cars,
busses, streetcars; so many well
dressed people on the streets going
to movies and restaurants; so many
of all the things which the cities of
Poland scarcely knew.
RELIEF NOT ENOUGH
I think that many of us on the
boat were deeply impressed and,
yes, puzzled, by this world of ex
tremes—by one people's poverty and
another's plenty. And separated by
scarcely 10 days of ocean travel,
and by only a few more than 10
hours of flight. At any rate we were
aware that whatever we were doing
in the way of relief was not enough.
As for the way to lick the situation,
at hand—to support the relief work
none of us had an answer that satis
fied us, unless it was to do the thing
that is already organized, only this
time wholeheartedly, not half-way.
We had been depressed by the size
of the job, but encouraged and so
bored by some of the things that
the common people of Poland were
thinking about the future and Amer
ica's responsibility to the future. We
still recalled the Polish worker talk
ing to us about a united Europe and
a united world. "You Americans
must make propaganda for it,"he
had said. Strong, open propaganda.
You must use your full influence to
unite the world."
