# Fire Prevention Week Opens; Marston Asks Student Aid
## 
### 
Seventy-five years ago Mrs. G'Le
ary's cow kicked over the lantern
that almost set the world on fire. In
honor of this fabled event, October
G-12 has been declared National Fire
Prevention Week.
In the past ten years, tire has
taken more than 100,000 lives and
has destroyed $.1,000,000,000 worth of
property. "With a home fire every
90 seconds every day, we are care
lessly destroying a large portion of
our available housing," said Fire
Chief John Marston.
The greatest majority of the fires
in the Stanford area in the last few
months have been caused by
matches and cigarettes carelessly
tossed along the roads. Brush fires
have been sending the firemen out
all day long, and we have been
lucky to escape without, serious
property damage.
Chief Marston asks that all Stan
ford students take the following
steps to help hold down our fire
hazard: 1) learn the location of your
nearest fire-alarm box, 2) know
how to use it, 3) remember that the
fire department number is 5111, and
J) be sure to report the exact loca
tion of any fires.
In connection with Fire Preven
tion Week, a special display has

been placed in the Stanford Book
store window. Cheek up on it—it
shows how to cut down the ever
present fire threat on the Stanford
campus.
