# Firemen Turn Artists; Paint the Campus Red
## 
### 
Twenty-eighl lire alarm boxes
adorning the Farm were being
painted a vivid red yesterday.
The boxes are made of bronze and
the paint actually doesn't provide
a protective covering. However,
there was at least one box which
hadn't been painted in 15 years
and has frequently been mistaken
for a post office box. All lliat is
over now. Stanford red predomi
nates.
(We wonder what color they
paint the boxes on the Cal cam
pus.)
