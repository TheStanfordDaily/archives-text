# ‘T’ Club Hears Chapin Speak
## 
### MARY VIRGINIA POND 
The University's foreign students
received tribute as "ambassadors of
good will" from their respective
countries from Dr. Leland T. Cha
pin, Stanford debate coach and as
sistant professor of speech and dra
ma, when he addressed Stanford's
International Club last Sunday eve
ning.
"Don't feel that you have all the
burdens of your country on your
shoulders," Mr. Chapin advised.
"There are many international
events you cannot control, but be
the best possible representatives of
your country and let it go at that."
STUDENTS ADD IDEAS
Mr. Chapin, who was also a mem
ber of an International Club —at
Edinburgh University in Scotland—
added that the University should
be honored by having so many stu
dents bringing new ideas, sugges
tions, and the best of things from
their countries to add to the "hap
py-go-lucky spirit of California."
"Understand American ways, but
don't take them all up. Keep your
own pleasant formality," he cau
tioned. By way of illustration, Mr.
Chapin related an experience with
an Englishman who was complain
ing of the "awful American accent."
CINEMA SLANG
To settle the argument. Mr. Cha
pin and the Britisher decided to go
to the cinema to check up on the
American brand of English. "As we
entered the aisle," Mr. Chapin said,
"there was a gangster pointing a gun
at his adversary saying, 'Tough guy,
eh?' " The argument was settled in
favor of the Britisher.
In regard to the part that campus
fraternities can play in making for
eign students feel at home in a
strange university, Mr. Chapin sug
gested that Stanford fraternities re
serve a few days out of each month
to have students from abroad as
guests at their houses.
FRATERNITY VISITS
Mr. Chapin pointed out that such
evenings could be of value to both
sides, since the value of having for
eign students attending Stanford lies
in the fact that they can acquaint
American students with other
events and happenings beyond
themselves.
"The philosophy of India, the civ
ilization of China, and the rigorous
training of Scandinavia can all be
pooled for the benefit of Stanford
students who have the chance to
know these students," Mr. Chapin
declared.
The plight of European and Asi
atic students abroad was described
briefly by Jim Glasse, traveling sec
retary for World Student Service
Fund.
