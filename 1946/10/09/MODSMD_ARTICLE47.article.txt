# Baruch Would Lift A-Bomb Use 'From Death to Life'
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 8 (UP).—Bernard M. Baruch warned tonight that
failure to outlaw atomic war will spin the world back through the dark
ages to chaos.
Speaking at a function where he received the Freedom House Award
for outstanding statesmanship, Baruch assailed and rejected the Russian

plan for world control of atomic
energy, saying it was unrealistic,
reaffirmed his faith in the "fun
damental principles" of the Ameri
can plan as "generous and just,"
attacked criticism inspired hy
Henry A. Wallace as a persistence
in error, and upheld the banish
ment of the veto power contained
in the American plan.
The venerable adviser to Presi
dents, who presented the American
plan as United Stales representative
on the Atomic Energy Commission,
said America wanted to destroy the
atom bomb—"lift its use from death
to life." He pledged that America
would take a leading part—"a pol
icy of enlightened selfishness"—in
the quest of peace.
Only by eliminating war will na
tions stop their ceaseless invention
of dread "secret" weapons evalu
ated solely by capacity to kill—"that
devilish program takes us back not
merely to the Dark Ages, but from
cosmos to Chaos."
He dissected the Russian plan,
and replied both to Soviet criticism
and to ex-Secretary of Commerce
Wallace's charge that his "stubborn
and inflexible approach" has caused
the deadlock between Russia and
the West.
Baruch tore into Russian Dele
gate Andrei A. Gromyko's coin
plaint before the U.N. Atomic
Commission that the American
program was unacceptable because
it violated national sovereignty.
"Better that," lie declared, "than
international disaster.
"America is willing to accept in
spection as a control measure and
for some time America would be
the most inspected. America asks
nothing she is not willing to give.
All of us must make contributions.
"I say to you with all the weight
of my experience that the American
plan does not impair any country's
national dignity or national secu
rity. It is a great forward motion
toward international peace."
Baruch empliasized that any
plan to outlaw atomic warfare
"must be a realistic working pact
—not merely a pious expression
of intent, wholly lacking in meth
ods of enforcement."
Baruch rejected any thought of
premature destruction of the Amer
ican stockpile.

national dignity or national secu
rity. It is a great forward motion
toward international peace."
Baruch empliasized that any
plan to outlaw atomic warfare
"must be a realistic working pact
—not merely a pious expression
of intent, wholly lacking in meth

NEW YORK, Oct. 8 (UP).—Bernard M. Baruch warned tonight that
failure to outlaw atomic war will spin the world back through the dark
ages to chaos.
Speaking at a function where he received the Freedom House Award
for outstanding statesmanship, Baruch assailed and rejected the Russian

plan for world control of atomic
energy, saying it was unrealistic,
reaffirmed his faith in the "fun
damental principles" of the Ameri
can plan as "generous and just,"
attacked criticism inspired hy
Henry A. Wallace as a persistence
in error, and upheld the banish
ment of the veto power contained
in the American plan.
The venerable adviser to Presi
dents, who presented the American
plan as United Stales representative
on the Atomic Energy Commission,
said America wanted to destroy the
atom bomb—"lift its use from death
to life." He pledged that America
would take a leading part—"a pol
icy of enlightened selfishness"—in
the quest of peace.
Only by eliminating war will na
tions stop their ceaseless invention
of dread "secret" weapons evalu
ated solely by capacity to kill—"that
devilish program takes us back not
merely to the Dark Ages, but from
cosmos to Chaos."
He dissected the Russian plan,
and replied both to Soviet criticism
and to ex-Secretary of Commerce
Wallace's charge that his "stubborn
and inflexible approach" has caused
the deadlock between Russia and
the West.
Baruch tore into Russian Dele
gate Andrei A. Gromyko's coin
plaint before the U.N. Atomic
Commission that the American
program was unacceptable because
it violated national sovereignty.
"Better that," lie declared, "than
international disaster.
"America is willing to accept in
spection as a control measure and
for some time America would be
the most inspected. America asks
nothing she is not willing to give.
All of us must make contributions.
"I say to you with all the weight
of my experience that the American
plan does not impair any country's
national dignity or national secu
rity. It is a great forward motion
toward international peace."
Baruch empliasized that any
plan to outlaw atomic warfare
"must be a realistic working pact
—not merely a pious expression
of intent, wholly lacking in meth
ods of enforcement."
Baruch rejected any thought of
premature destruction of the Amer
ican stockpile.
