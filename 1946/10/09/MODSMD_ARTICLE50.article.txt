# B-29's Face Global Test
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Oct. 8 (UP).—
The Army plans to send a flight of
giant B-29 bombers around the
world within the next few weeks to
test the long-range striking power
of the American air arm, Assistant
Secretary of War for Air W. Stuart
Symington announced today.
The mass flight, he told a press
conference, also will be a demon
stration of the role the B-29's could
play as a law-enforcing arm of
the United Nations.
Symington also revealed that
the Army Air Forces have been
given full control of this coun
try's guided missile development,
a military field of top importance
in which Army airmen and
ground forces had been competing
for many months.
In announcing the USAAF'S
globe-girdling plans, he said the
final decision hinges on approval
from the State Department. He ap
peared confident, however, that the
State Department, which has sent
American warships cruising in the
eastern Mediterranean to back up its
foreign policy declarations, would
give the go-ahead for the aerial
demonstration.
He refused to speculate whether
the flight would add to or allay
tension in world afTairs. A re
porter raised that point in an ob
vious reference to the furor raised
by Russia when American war
ships began their recent "good
will cruises" in the Mediterranean.
"This flight will compare with
around the world voyages made in
earlier days by the American
fleet." he said.
Symington said present plans call
for a force of between eight and 24
Superforts on the global hop. They
will follow the trail blazed by the
Air Transport Command during the
war, taking anywhere from one to
two weeks for the flight, depending
upon how many stops are made en
route.
The ATC route from Washing
ton covers Bermuda, the Azores,
Casablanca, Cairo, Tunisiai. Aba
dan, Karachi, Calcutta. Kunming,
Manila, Guam, Kwajalcin, John
ston Island, Honolulu and San
Francisco.
The primary purpose of the flight,
he said, is to work out technical
problems involved in moving a large
group of heavy bombers over long
distances, including questions of
communications, organization and
logistics.

ground forces had been competing
for many months.
In announcing the USAAF'S
globe-girdling plans, he said the
final decision hinges on approval
from the State Department. He ap
peared confident, however, that the
State Department, which has sent
American warships cruising in the
eastern Mediterranean to back up its
foreign policy declarations, would
give the go-ahead for the aerial
demonstration.
He refused to speculate whether
the flight would add to or allay
tension in world afTairs. A re
porter raised that point in an ob
vious reference to the furor raised
by Russia when American war
ships began their recent "good
will cruises" in the Mediterranean.
"This flight will compare with
around the world voyages made in
earlier days by the American
fleet." he said.
Symington said present plans call
for a force of between eight and 24
Superforts on the global hop. They
will follow the trail blazed by the
Air Transport Command during the
war, taking anywhere from one to
two weeks for the flight, depending
upon how many stops are made en
route.
The ATC route from Washing
ton covers Bermuda, the Azores,
Casablanca, Cairo, Tunisiai. Aba
dan, Karachi, Calcutta. Kunming,
Manila, Guam, Kwajalcin, John
ston Island, Honolulu and San
Francisco.
The primary purpose of the flight,
he said, is to work out technical
problems involved in moving a large
group of heavy bombers over long
distances, including questions of
communications, organization and
logistics.
