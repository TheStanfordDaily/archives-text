# Skilling Tells Experiences As Bikini Bomb Observer
## 
### 
Dr. Hugh H. Skilling took members of his Tuesday Evening
Series audience to Bikini Atoll last night for the July atom-bomb
tests, kept them at a safe distance from making any startling ob
servations, and returned them to Memorial Hall auditorium with
no new information about the results of the tests.

Members of his audience who
came to hear the head of the Stan
ford Electrical Engineering Depart
ment reveal unannounced data on
the Bikini "Operations Crossroads"
may have gone away disappointed.
But in an illustrated talk titled
"The United Nations at Bikini, Dr.
Skilling did graphically describe the
two bomb tests as an eye-witness re
port of his experience as an observ
er at the experiments.
In the company of 40 scientists,
engineers, military strategists, and
doctors from the 11 nations on the
United Nation Security Council
Dr. Skilling observed the two
atomic explosions from the bridge
of the ship, the U.S.S. Panamint.
Using slides made from his own
and U.S. Navy photographs Dr.
Skilling showed the position of the
200 ships used in tlu* tests inside the
Bikini lagoon of the tiny atoll in
the Marshall Islands.
Describing the atomic explo
sion of the bomb on "Able-Day,"
Dr. Skilling corrected erroneous
reports that the bomb burst was
"thousands of times brighter than
the sun" by reporting that the ex
plosion was "only a few times
brighter at its best."
Dr. Skilling showed successive
slides indicating the growth of the
huge cloud which mushroomed sev
eral miles into the sky. He explain
ed that the explosion condensed the
moisture in the air and a vapor
cloud resulted spreading out with
the speed of sound.

From his observation post on
the bridge of the Panamint. an
chored 20 miles northeast of the
coral islands rimming the lagoon,
Dr. Skilling noted that II) seconds
after the bomb's explosion a col
umn of bright pink smoke had
risen almost a mile high in the
cloudy sky.
The cloud climbed rapidly, he
said, and soon mushroomed to 30,-
000-40,000 feet, gradually changing
in color from peach to salmon to
pale yellow.
The Panamint entered Bikini
late in the afternoon after it had
been determined there was no
danger from radioactive elements.
Showing a slide of the aircraft
carrier "Independence," Dr. Skil
ling described the damage to the
carrier he observed in his inspec
tion of the target ships.
"Three hundred yards from the
center of the bomb target, the 'In
dependence' lost all planes and car
go lashed on deck, its superstruc
ture was blown away, the bomb
blast went completely through the
ship, and it caught fire and was
seen burning at least 15 hours after
the bomb explosion."
In describing the "Baker Day"
or second atomic bomb test, Dr.
Skilling reported that the depth
bomb must have been detonated
on or near the bottom of the la
goon because of the thousands of
tons of water thrown into the air
by the blast.
