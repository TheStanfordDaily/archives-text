Meanwhile, the Administration

nated for married coupl?s at Stan
ford Village remain unocupied, and
that requests for living space regis
tered with the Dean of Students' of
fice have been much lower than was
anticipated.
It is estimated that the Village
buildings would accommodate over
25 couples. Joe Dye, head of AVC's
Veterans' Affairs Committee and
actively connected with the Vil

that the quarters there are "livable
and convenient."
The priority assignment system
used by the Administration is op

basis. Should demand for housing
excecd the supply, living quarters
are assigned in order of application
and not of the need of (he individual
applicants.
Results of thÂ» poll will be an
nounced at tonight's AVC meeting,
and all further work on housing will
be done on the basis of today's ftnd
