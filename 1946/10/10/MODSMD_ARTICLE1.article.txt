# Display of Axe To Await Case
## 
### 
Stanford's Axe is back.
But it won't be in its familiar Cellar location until some suit
able protection is found for it. The case, which was stolen with
the Axe, was not returned, and the Axe is now locked in police
headquarters.
Stanford Police Chief Gordon Davis brought the Axe back 1
to the campus early yesterday afternoon. It will be turned over
to the students when public display is once again possible.
The famed symbol of Cal-Stanfora rivalry was discovered late -
Tuesday night when Palo Alto police investigated an anonymous
phone call telling them the Axe was "in the back seat of the
police prowl car" outside the police station.
The call came at 11:42 p.m. At, the do.sk sergeant's exclamation of j
"Well, whaddaya know!'" the man at the other end of the 1 in r .* replied, j
"You're telling me! Good-bye."
DETAILS UNKNOWN
No further details were available as to the identity of the person or !
persons who mysteriously returned the Axe after its five-month absence 1
from the Stanford campus.
Stanford police were notified immediately after the Axe was found in
the back seat of Palo Alto Police Chief Howard A. Zink's patrol car.
AXE STOLEN IN APRIL
The Axe was stolen for the fifth time last April 28 when six tall youths
wearing Stanford jackets and flying jackets marched into the Cellar at
10:25 p.m. and proceeded to file the chains which anchored the Axe case I
to the Cellar wall. The Cellar counterman on duty that Sunday night
was the only person in the Cellar at the time.
One other witness saw the thieves drive away with the Axe and case
in a '38 Chevrolet one-and-a-half-ton pickup truck.
PICTURE SENT TO DAILY
Only definite news that the Axe had not been disposed of since the
theft came in a picture of the Axe sent to the Daily Oct. 1. A note on the
back of the photograph said, "Think you'll ever get it back? You mayâ€”
if and when the occasion arises."
A written pledge signed by the presidents of the Cal and Stanford j
student bodies in 1934 gave suspension as punishment should students j
from either University steal the Axe from the school temporarily hold- i
ing it.
trophy in i
In 1933 the Axe was established as a trophy to be awardeci the winner j
of the annual Cal-Stanford Big Game. Stanford has had it since 1942 j
following its 26-7 football win over California.
Tlie Axe was returned following negotiations between Stanford and
Cal student officers last week. A.S.S.U. President Martin Anderson ap
pointed Rally Com member Dave Heyler as the Stanford representative
to enlist Cal student co-operation in finding the Axe.
CAL PLEDGED AID
Heyler talked to A.S.U.C. President Ed Welch and to fraternity reprc- j
sentatives on the California campus. They said that if the Axe was on j
the Cal campus, it would be returned soon, and pledged their'"utmost j
co-6peration" in insuring its return to Stanford, Heyler said.

Following yesterday's return of the Axe, A.S.S.U. President Martin
Anderson stated:
"The symbol of the Big Game rivalry has been preserved by the vol
untary return of the Axe. It is of no concern who took the Axe. The
important matter is that it was brought back through the efforts of the
Associated Students of California.
GOOD WILL DEMONSTRATED *
"Stanford could ask for no better demonstration of good will from
the Berkeley campus than this.
"It is because of their sincere desire to live up to the agreement for
the disposition of the trophy, and perpetuation of the Stanford-California
tradition concerning it, that the Axe is back 011 campus."

The Axe became a symbol of Stanford spirit in 1899, when it was
brought out to revive Farm spirit, following the death of George Beckett,
captain and star pitcher of the Farm baseball team.
"IMMORTAL 21" PLOT
In the same year, however, it was stolen by Cal students who kept it
hidden in the vaults of a Berkeley bank until 1930. At the Big Game that
year, Stanford's and Sequoia Hall's "Immortal 21" recaptured the Axe
with a daring'plot that brought newspaper headlines throughout the nation.
Since that time the Axe has been the prize of the Big Game winner. It
has been stolen from Stanford four times since 1930, but the latest theft
was the first one of long duration since 1899.
