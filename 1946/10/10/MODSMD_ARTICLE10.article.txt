# Anniversary of Eating Clubs Today; History Shows Downs of Group
## 
### JACK OGLESBY 
Thirty-five years ago today the !
following statement appeared in the
Daily Palo Alto, Stanford's first I
newspaper:
"The long - delayed eating clubs
are at last a reality, and the build
ings will be ready for occupancy by j
the beginning of the next academic j
year."
GROUP FORMKD IN 1901
Although today is the anniver
sary of the eating clubs as perma- !
nent institutions, actually two of !
the organizations were formed ear- j
licr.
In 1901 at the turn of the century j
a group of men formed Los Areos.
the first eating club at Stanford.
The next year another club was j
formed under the name of El Toro. I
1!)11 OFFICIAL BEGINNING
Officially, however, Oct. 11, 1911.
is looked upon as the real begin- ,
ning date of eating elubs as a part [
of Stanford. That date not only |
marked the approval of a plan for ;
the construction of buildings but
terminated the end of a three-year
brittle with the Administration. The

University balked ;it undertaking
construction itself.
When things were beginning to
look rather hopeless, three alumni
stepped in to loan the elubs $9,000.
These men were George E. Croth
ers, '95; Dennis Searles, '95; and
Newton Cleaveland, '99.
ALUMNI BOAItl) HELPS
This solved the main problem fac
ing the clubs, and the advisory com
mittee of the alumni board, which
had done a good deal of the work
in getting things organized, settled
back and waited for the University's
board of directors to make the final
approval of plans.
Giving credit to the advisory
board, the Daily Palo Alto said,
"The members of this board have
labored unceasingly to obtain the
eating houses for the student body.
Credit ... in large measure is due
them."
BUILDINGS ERECTED
The following summer, having se
cured the go-ahead from the board
of directors, three eating club build
ings were erected. The newspapei
predicted that "the clubs will prove

a valuable addition to the Univer
sity."
Built in Mission style architec
ture, the three dining rooms opened
on a court. It was these buildings
that were razed and moved to the
i old ROTC grounds, due to condem
nation procedures carried out by
the Administration during the war.
Year by year, the clubs paid back
tlie $9,000, and when the debts were
cleared pair! rent to the University
for use of the buildings.
THE LITTLE QUAD'
The group of buildings later be
came known as "The Little Quad,"
and they played a part in the just
starting alumni organization.
In later years more clubs were
formed, and when the Encina Com
mons was built club rooms were in
cluded in the designs. The clubs
â–  were formed in this order:
1901. Los Arcos; 1902. El Toro;
1911, Breakers: 1913, El Cainpo;
; 1919. El Capitan; 1920, El Cuadro;
! 1022. El Tigrc.

; and the "Dependents.")
