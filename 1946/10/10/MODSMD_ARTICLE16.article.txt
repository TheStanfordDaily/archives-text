### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. (UP). â€”Democratic National Chairman Rob
ert E. Hanncgan and a group of top-ranking Administration officials met
at the White House late today to discuss the politically explosive meat
shortage amid reports that at least two cabinet members had split with
President Truman over his handling of the situation.
The meeting lasted two and one-half hours. None of the conferees
would talk afterward.
The group met in the White House office of Reconversion Director
John R. Steelman. It was the third special meeting on the meat problem
held there within a week, and emphasized the concern of Hanncgan and
others over the effects of the shortage on the Democratic party's chances
of retaining control of Congress in November.
