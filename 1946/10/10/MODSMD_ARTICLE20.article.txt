## Where Are We Heading? 
### 
There is a good deal to be said for the
University Administration's attitude of view
ing the present abnormal college enrollment
and its accompanying problems as a tempo
rary situation which will settle down within
a period of a few years. This caution will un
doubtedly prevent costly permanent projects
loi which there will be no need in five years,
iind serve to hamper those who are inclined
to go off on tangents which eventually will
have to be changed because of future condi
tions. «
However, there are dangers in this position
which are becoming more evident every day.
In it. c ; effort to be cautious with regard to the
future, the Administration seems concerned
only with a short-term policy and is losing
sight of a long-range policy the type of pol
icy by which Stanford has guided its progress
in the past.
So great is the concern for day-to-day
pioblems that any visible and tangible objec
tives, pertaining to administrative, academic,
and social plans, which may exist are being
completely obscured. Instead the student
body is faced with a small navy of adminis-,
tralive officials all of whom will give a differ
ent answer to any question regarding Admin
istration policy, while those in a position to
determine policy remain silent allowing these
subordinates to interpret an apparently non
existent policy in a dozen different ways.
Only one undercurrent seems evident
among this confusing array, and that is the

apparent distrust of students' ability to handle
responsibilities here in college which parallel
responsibilities they have handled success
fully during the past four years and will again
be called upon to handle after they leave the
University. _
If this theme is to become the allusive Ad
ministration policy, it is hardly consistent with
the stepped-up training for responsibilities
which the Atomic Age will reguire.
The post-war picture is already sufficiently
clear to be able to foretell with a certain de
gree of accuracy the tremendous responsi
bilities which will face world citizens—deci
sions and courses of action which will appall
the average Ph.D., much less the college grad
uate of four years. American educators for
the past six months have been proclaiming the
need for revised and intensified systems of
education to better eguip the averuge Ameri
can to handle these new problems.
Stanford has always been a progressive
and leading educational institution. However,
the Administration's apparent reluctance to
admit the existence of new permanent prob
lems threatens to leave Stanford in the wake
of changing educational trends. The majority
of the students seem guite aware of their new
obligations and are anxious to prepare them
selves for them, but the tools with which they
have to work are of a pre-war model. Granted
that it takes some time for reconversion, but
along just what line in the way of future policy
is the reconversion going to lead? N.W.

which the Atomic Age will reguire.
The post-war picture is already sufficiently
clear to be able to foretell with a certain de
gree of accuracy the tremendous responsi
bilities which will face world citizens—deci
sions and courses of action which will appall
the average Ph.D., much less the college grad
uate of four years. American educators for
the past six months have been proclaiming the
need for revised and intensified systems of
education to better eguip the averuge Ameri
can to handle these new problems.
Stanford has always been a progressive
and leading educational institution. However,
the Administration's apparent reluctance to
admit the existence of new permanent prob
lems threatens to leave Stanford in the wake
of changing educational trends. The majority
of the students seem guite aware of their new
obligations and are anxious to prepare them
selves for them, but the tools with which they
have to work are of a pre-war model. Granted
that it takes some time for reconversion, but
along just what line in the way of future policy
is the reconversion going to lead? N.W.
There is a good deal to be said for the
University Administration's attitude of view
ing the present abnormal college enrollment
and its accompanying problems as a tempo
rary situation which will settle down within
a period of a few years. This caution will un
doubtedly prevent costly permanent projects
loi which there will be no need in five years,
iind serve to hamper those who are inclined
to go off on tangents which eventually will
have to be changed because of future condi
tions. «
However, there are dangers in this position
which are becoming more evident every day.
In it. c ; effort to be cautious with regard to the
future, the Administration seems concerned
only with a short-term policy and is losing
sight of a long-range policy the type of pol
icy by which Stanford has guided its progress
in the past.
So great is the concern for day-to-day
pioblems that any visible and tangible objec
tives, pertaining to administrative, academic,
and social plans, which may exist are being
completely obscured. Instead the student
body is faced with a small navy of adminis-,
tralive officials all of whom will give a differ
ent answer to any question regarding Admin
istration policy, while those in a position to
determine policy remain silent allowing these
subordinates to interpret an apparently non
existent policy in a dozen different ways.
Only one undercurrent seems evident
among this confusing array, and that is the

apparent distrust of students' ability to handle
responsibilities here in college which parallel
responsibilities they have handled success
fully during the past four years and will again
be called upon to handle after they leave the
University. _
If this theme is to become the allusive Ad
ministration policy, it is hardly consistent with
the stepped-up training for responsibilities
which the Atomic Age will reguire.
