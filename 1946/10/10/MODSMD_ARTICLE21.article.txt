# HILL COUGHLIN
## BULL SESSION 
### 
Ceo, it's really buck! Just walked over to the
police department, slipped Gorcly the password,
waited while a burly cop wit' a gat on his hip un
locked the mop closet, and there before my awe
struck gaze was the great Stanford Axe.
11 looks just about the same. Whoever had the
thing hasn't be ;n using ft to open tin cans or drive
nails witn, anyway. It may have been used to be
head a chicken or two but it doesn't show.
I can now let out a big secret. I've known all
.•(long where it was. About three weeks ago, a mys
terious person 'called me one night and said in a
dramatic tone of voice, "The Axe is behind the third
book from the left on the seventh shelf of stack
824.7 c in the Libe."
Well. I went down and looked but all I found
was a librarian who had been lost since 1927.
Couldn't find stack 824.7 c.
And then the following week, this person called
a: ain. "The Axe is on the third seat from the center
ai.slt in the seventh row of the balcony at the Stan
ford Theater in Paly," I was told.
So I went down there, shelled out my hard
earned cash, and all I fount! was a Paly Hi girl. Well,
I tried but I didn't get it. The Axe, that is.
When my mysterious friend called again night
b"fore last I was pretty fed up with not finding it.
So I told him just what he could do with that Axe.
He must have misunderstood me. He shoved it in
the back of a Paly police car.
t. ijt
II is not likely that the Axe will go on public

display again until the case is returned or some other
method of chaining it down can be devised.
Rally Com ought to take advantage of all the
•spirit and publicity attendant upon the Axe's return
and see if arrangements could be made to display
it at tonight's U.C.L.A. rally.
Incidentally, this might be a good place to point
out that the Axe Yell didn't use to be restricted just
to the Cal game. Whenever really needed during
the season, it was roared out. Most of the returned
vets will remember the game against Washington in
1 i>4o when Albeit and the Rose Bowl Wow Doys were
trailing 10-0 late in the final half.
The Axe Yell really rocked the stadium then
and immediately following it the tide of the game
turned. Chuck Taylor stopped three Husky plays
cold and Stanford took possession. A few plays later
the first Card touchdown was scored and others
quickly' followed. Final score was 20-10.
It was considered entirely permissible to use it
against U.C.L.A. or the Trojans at the Coliseum in
LA. Matter of fact, il was usually used down there
since the Southland fans rather expected it. Cer
tainly, this Saturday's game is important enough to
rate it.

It is a cheering thought to realize that we won't
have to worry about jeering taunts from the Cal
rooting section at the Big Game concerning the
whereabouts of the Axe.
But they will probably come up with a chant of:
"Who's got the Axo case, who's got the Axe case,
etc.?"
