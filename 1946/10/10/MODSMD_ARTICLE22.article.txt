To the Editor:
In Monday's issue of the Daily your columnist.,
George Brunn, indulged in a bit of economic philoso
phizing on the subject of taxation and distribution
of the wealth.
If your columnist would go back over his Econ I
notes he probably would discover that one of the
main reasons for inequality of income is variance in
ability or talent of different men. lienry Ford's auto
rnolive business grew because Mr. Ford was a more
astute man than the other mechanics of his time.
Andrew Carnegie, an impoverished Scotch immi
grant lad who arrived in Pittsburgh in 1847, was
able to build up an industrial empire valued at five
hundred million dollars in but half a century. I
could cite many more examples of men with supe
rior business acumen who ascended the ladder of
business success, but repetition of success stories
tends to be boring. These men became captains of
industry because of their superior ability, daring,
cunning, perspicacity, or whatever else you choose to
call it.
(Jiu- present tax system is so devised as to tend
toward redistribution ot our national income, taking
it away from the hands of these capitalists and giving
it to the less fortunate in the form of unemployment
insurance, old age pensions, free medical care, etc.
One of the reasons that Ilies" unfortunates must be
supported by those with more initiative and back
bone is that they are improvident. They are the
people who have large families without any regard
as to how th >y will support them, figuring that some
one (the government with the aid of the capitalists'
money) will see to it that they do not starve or
suffer from lack of medical care. A corporation head
earning in excess of half a million dollars is taxed at
about 88 per cent of his income. Those earning
around $3,000 are taxed approximately 15 per cent
of their income. Surely it is apparent which indi
vidual is contributing the most, not only in absolute,
but in relative amounts, to the support of our gov
ernment.

To the Editor:
In the confusion wrought by the dragging of our
fe"ble and conflicting foreign policies into the dema

goguery of national politics, we have still no valid
reason to abandon our ancient concepts of sover
eignty and citizenship, that this nation represents
the best interests of all classes of our people better
than any foreign power; that full allegiance and mili
tary service are owed by all citizens; that all parties
tolerate the foreign policy of the legal government;
that agitation and conspiracy against the state by
extremist parties is treasonable; and that we are
justified in taking precautions against defeat and
domination.
Granted that these once-universal principles are
still popular in the country, if not with the Stanford
Daily, we must oppose the arming of any state whose
military policy might threaten our security or sov
ereignty; no international conference can yet take
any effective action, nor is there any indication that
any future conference could do so.
Only Russia, of all the warlike states, has the
power to attack us alone; therefore we are righteous,
logical, and justified in taking defensive measures
against the possibility of war with that country.
Among these measures should be a permanent Draft
Act; a firm stand against further Russian aggressions
in the Middle East, Europe, and China; the seizing
of naval bases in the Pacific; the prompt rehabilita
tion of Germany under our strict military govern
ment; the support of the Chinese Nationalist Govern
ment by lend-lease; the formation of extensive trade
agreements wilh the British, French, and Dutch em
pires; the pacifying of colonials; the formation of
friendly governments in Spain and Argentina; the
permanent occupation of Japan; the banning of sedi
tious extremist parties; the military use of atomic
weapons, jet and rocket propulsion devices, and other
new inventions to be placed under secret and strict
control; the active support of conservative and
friendly political parties in Europe; the decentraliza
tion of our home industry; a permanent federal in
junction against strikes in vital industries and
against violent picketing; the establishment of eco
nomic stability at home; the reorganization of the
military; and the founding of an effective American
intelligence system abroad. Our security has never
been adequately protected by treaties; we won the
late war not because we were on the side of the good,
but because we go! there fastest wilh the mostest.

notes he probably would discover that one of the

ability or talent of different men. lienry Ford's auto
rnolive business grew because Mr. Ford was a more
astute man than the other mechanics of his time.
Andrew Carnegie, an impoverished Scotch immi
grant lad who arrived in Pittsburgh in 1847, was
able to build up an industrial empire valued at five
hundred million dollars in but half a century. I
could cite many more examples of men with supe
rior business acumen who ascended the ladder of
business success, but repetition of success stories
tends to be boring. These men became captains of
industry because of their superior ability, daring,
cunning, perspicacity, or whatever else you choose to
call it.
(Jiu- present tax system is so devised as to tend
toward redistribution ot our national income, taking
it away from the hands of these capitalists and giving
it to the less fortunate in the form of unemployment
insurance, old age pensions, free medical care, etc.
One of the reasons that Ilies" unfortunates must be
supported by those with more initiative and back
bone is that they are improvident. They are the
people who have large families without any regard
as to how th >y will support them, figuring that some
one (the government with the aid of the capitalists'
money) will see to it that they do not starve or
suffer from lack of medical care. A corporation head
earning in excess of half a million dollars is taxed at
about 88 per cent of his income. Those earning
around $3,000 are taxed approximately 15 per cent
of their income. Surely it is apparent which indi

notes he probably would discover that one of the
main reasons for inequality of income is variance in
ability or talent of different men. lienry Ford's auto
rnolive business grew because Mr. Ford was a more
astute man than the other mechanics of his time.
Andrew Carnegie, an impoverished Scotch immi
grant lad who arrived in Pittsburgh in 1847, was
able to build up an industrial empire valued at five
hundred million dollars in but half a century. I
could cite many more examples of men with supe
rior business acumen who ascended the ladder of
business success, but repetition of success stories
tends to be boring. These men became captains of
industry because of their superior ability, daring,
cunning, perspicacity, or whatever else you choose to
call it.
(Jiu- present tax system is so devised as to tend
toward redistribution ot our national income, taking
it away from the hands of these capitalists and giving
it to the less fortunate in the form of unemployment
insurance, old age pensions, free medical care, etc.
One of the reasons that Ilies" unfortunates must be
supported by those with more initiative and back
bone is that they are improvident. They are the
people who have large families without any regard
as to how th >y will support them, figuring that some
one (the government with the aid of the capitalists'
money) will see to it that they do not starve or
suffer from lack of medical care. A corporation head
earning in excess of half a million dollars is taxed at
about 88 per cent of his income. Those earning
around $3,000 are taxed approximately 15 per cent
of their income. Surely it is apparent which indi
vidual is contributing the most, not only in absolute,
but in relative amounts, to the support of our gov
ernment.

To the Editor:
In the confusion wrought by the dragging of our
fe"ble and conflicting foreign policies into the dema

goguery of national politics, we have still no valid
reason to abandon our ancient concepts of sover
eignty and citizenship, that this nation represents
the best interests of all classes of our people better
than any foreign power; that full allegiance and mili
tary service are owed by all citizens; that all parties
tolerate the foreign policy of the legal government;
that agitation and conspiracy against the state by
extremist parties is treasonable; and that we are
justified in taking precautions against defeat and
domination.
Granted that these once-universal principles are
still popular in the country, if not with the Stanford
Daily, we must oppose the arming of any state whose
military policy might threaten our security or sov
ereignty; no international conference can yet take
any effective action, nor is there any indication that
any future conference could do so.
Only Russia, of all the warlike states, has the
power to attack us alone; therefore we are righteous,
logical, and justified in taking defensive measures
against the possibility of war with that country.
Among these measures should be a permanent Draft
Act; a firm stand against further Russian aggressions
in the Middle East, Europe, and China; the seizing
of naval bases in the Pacific; the prompt rehabilita
tion of Germany under our strict military govern
ment; the support of the Chinese Nationalist Govern
ment by lend-lease; the formation of extensive trade
agreements wilh the British, French, and Dutch em
pires; the pacifying of colonials; the formation of
friendly governments in Spain and Argentina; the
permanent occupation of Japan; the banning of sedi
tious extremist parties; the military use of atomic
weapons, jet and rocket propulsion devices, and other
new inventions to be placed under secret and strict
control; the active support of conservative and
friendly political parties in Europe; the decentraliza
tion of our home industry; a permanent federal in
junction against strikes in vital industries and
against violent picketing; the establishment of eco
nomic stability at home; the reorganization of the
military; and the founding of an effective American
intelligence system abroad. Our security has never
been adequately protected by treaties; we won the
late war not because we were on the side of the good,
but because we go! there fastest wilh the mostest.
