# AVC Favors Temporary Raise in G.I. Allowances
## 
### 
Alter an hour of intense discus
sion, perforated by sound Economic
principle from Professor Arthur
Mandelbaum of the economics de
partment, Stanford Chapter of AVC
went on record as favoring a raise
in GI subsistence allowances until
such time as Congress attacks the
basic problem of a living wage. The
question was raised and decided be
fore the regular meeting of the
chapter held in the Stanford Village
Auditorium last night.
When asked if tlie proposed raise
(S6D to $100 and $90 to $125) was in
flationary, Mr. Mandelbaum an
swered in essence a flat no. He
pointed out that inflation, as defined,
is already here, that it is people on
fixed wage incomes who always suf
fer, and that in the overall picture
the estimated increase in money
payed out ($400,000,000) would come
to but 1-4 of 1 per cent of the total
national income. He explained that
the measure could not be interpret
ed as a loan, for although expendi
tures on the national scale are going
down, taxes will always be with us.
There was considerable opposition
to the measure. Many veterans felt
that supporting the proposal would

set the veterans up as a special
group appearing to demand more
than they deserve. A motion that
the chapter should oppose any raise
at this time was defeated in a very
close vole, 16 to 20.
The proposal which finally passed.
"Stanford Chapter is in favor of a
raise in subsistence until such time
when Congress takes effective ac
tion to lower the high cost of liv
ing," was voted through with 28 to
5. This statement will lie forwarded
to national headquarters of AVC
where it will become a part of a na
tional resolution.
Friday, Oct. 18 was set as the date
for an AVC sponsored Village get
together dance to he held in the
Village center.
Next meeting will he Wednesday
night. Subject for discussion will he
the local housing and living prob
lems in relation to Stanford veter
ans.
