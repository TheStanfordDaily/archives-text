# Studio Opens Reading Series
## 
### 
Stanford's new Studio Theatre
began what looks to be a successful
season of smaller dramatic produc
tions last night with a staged read
ing of John Webster's famous clas
sic, "The Duchess of Malfi."
With a striking setting of velvet
curtains and red robes, the readers
were seated before a long table fac
ing the audience so that all facial
and hand expression was fully ef
fective. Scene changes and descrip
tions were accomplished by a reader
seated behind the players somewhat
in the manner of a chief justice.
After a short time the mood and
action of the play crossed the some
what static set made necessary be
cause it was a reading.
Outstanding performances were
given by Elaine Maltzman as the
Duchess of Malfi, John Mensel as
Antonio, Julio Francescutti as Fer
dinand, and David Hawes as Bosola.
Credit should also go to Norman
Philbrick who directed the reading
and is in general charge of the Studio
Theatre. The idea of presenting
smaller less formal productions in
addition to the regular Stanford
Players series is something that has
long been needed on this campus.
A fully staged and costumed pro
duction of "The Duchess of Malfi"
will also be presented on Nov. 7 at
San Jose State College.—Heintze
