### 
BERLIN, Oct. 9 (UP).â€”The four
power Allied Control Council, last
hope of convicted Nuernberg de
fendants, probably will announce in
a brief communique tomorrow that j
all 16 Nazi appeals for clemency
have been denied, two separate and
reliable American sources agreed \
today.
These sources hinted strongly at
the end of today's closely guarded
meeting that the council will uphold
the verdicts of the Nuernberg court,
denying nearly all if not all appeals
for mercy. A short communique to
that effect is expected at 6 p.m., Ber- j
lin time, (11 a.m. EST) tomorrow.
