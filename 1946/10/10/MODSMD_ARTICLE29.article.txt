# Trojans Laying Down: Cravath
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 9 (UP).—
Coach Jeff Cravath of the Univer
sity of Southern California Trojans
today charged that his players
"weren't trying" when they took a
21-0 crunching from Ohio State
Saturday.
And with the statement he sin
gled out two backs, Gordon Gray
and Ted Tannehill, star of a pre
war and last year's football teams,
respectively, as leaders in the "non
trying" group and relegated them to
membership on the second team,
"starting as of now."
"You can't win football games
when you don't want to win," said
jittery Jefferson as he plotted a
shakeup of his gridmen, defending
champions of the Pacific Coast Con
ference — and three consecutive
times a visitor to the Rose Bowl.
"The way we played against Ohio
State, we certainly didn't want to
take advantage of the Buckeyes. I
saw some boys on the field in my
lineup that did want to play foot
ball, however, and they're going to
be on my team from now on."
"I'll have nothing more to do with
prima donnas," he stated. "Certain
members of our team have been
taking liberties in reporting for
practice. Hereafter, a man who re
ports late for practice without a
legitimate excuse is going to be
bounced."
With that mouthful, Cravath in
dicated that any dullards in Trojan
uniform who don't want to play,
aren't going to. They can hustle
their evening vittles someplace else
besides the SC training table, he
said.
