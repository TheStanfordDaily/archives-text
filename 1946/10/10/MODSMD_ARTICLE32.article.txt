"We'll have a good team," was all
Coach Dave Tappan would say con
cerning his 1946 Stanford soccer
team, which is returning to the field
this season after a layoff of four
years. Thirty-five players turned
out for opening practices, which got
under way last week.
Tappan, former Swarthmore play
er and now a graduate student on
the Farm, is banking on two South
Americans — Ricardo Trejos and
Tony Ortega—to supply offensive
strength, while Jack Pagan is ex
pected to bulwark the rear line from
his' centerback position.
The season's schedule is still in
the tentative stage.
