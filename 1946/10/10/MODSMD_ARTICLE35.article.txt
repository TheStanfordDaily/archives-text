# Warner Reminisces; Still Says Nevers 'Greatest'
## 
### ST MILLAR 
Pop answered questions on many and varied subjects. Some
he didn't want printed. But he didn't sidestep any of them. He
refused publicly to criticize anything or anyone.
So if this interview sounds like Pop is all honey and roses,
that is the way he wants it to be. He doesn't want to hurt anyone.
But he is far from unopinionated. He is gruff but not biting,
critical but not bitter.

(Concluded From Yesterday)

He's been around a long time. +
Since way back in '95 when he [
bad played his last year of foot
ball and took up the coaching
reins at U. of Georgia. He showed
a picture of the first team he
coached. All the players—and he
—wore high turtle-neck sweaters
and had long curly hair. He told
me they wore the long hair for
some degree of protection, for
they didn't have helmets in those
days.
POP WAS HANDSOME
Mrs. Warner turned from the i
comic strip she was reading when
I asked which one was Pop. "Why, [
the handsomest man in Uie picture," I
she said.
And Pop was. He must have been
quite a lady-killer in those days.
Almost anyone who has followed I
football can fill in the crossword of
Pop's career. They can tell you how
he invented the wing-back system
in the early 1900s when the flying
wedge and other such plays were
abolished. They can tell you of his ;
success in building the great Car- 1
lisle gridiron eleven and his six un
defeated University of Pittsburgh |
teams. They can tell you how he i
came to Stanford, put her on the ;
football map, and developed some |
of the finest football players of this !
or any age.
NEVERS "THE GREATEST"
Who was his best? I asked Pop.
"I've always said Ernie Nevers," I
Pop replied. "He's the greatest. !
They say these guys Nagurski and j
Blanchard and Standlee hit hard,
but they couldn't hit harder than
Ernie. He was the greatest line
bucker ever. He could do every
thing, and you could depend on
him."
He was the best football player
of all at Stanford, according to
Pop. "And not only that ... he
was the best football player of
all—period," adds Mr. Warner.
Other Stanford men, not of Pop's
reign, came in for their share of
praise. "This Grayson was a good
man," said Pop, "and Frankie Al
bert is the best quarter-back ever
developed at Stanford.

critical but not bitter.

(Concluded From Yesterday)

He's been around a long time. +
Since way back in '95 when he [
bad played his last year of foot
ball and took up the coaching
reins at U. of Georgia. He showed
a picture of the first team he
coached. All the players—and he
—wore high turtle-neck sweaters
and had long curly hair. He told
me they wore the long hair for
some degree of protection, for
they didn't have helmets in those
days.
POP WAS HANDSOME
Mrs. Warner turned from the i
comic strip she was reading when
I asked which one was Pop. "Why, [
the handsomest man in Uie picture," I
she said.
And Pop was. He must have been
quite a lady-killer in those days.
Almost anyone who has followed I
football can fill in the crossword of
Pop's career. They can tell you how
he invented the wing-back system
in the early 1900s when the flying
wedge and other such plays were
abolished. They can tell you of his ;
success in building the great Car- 1
lisle gridiron eleven and his six un
defeated University of Pittsburgh |
teams. They can tell you how he i
came to Stanford, put her on the ;
football map, and developed some |
of the finest football players of this !
or any age.
NEVERS "THE GREATEST"
Who was his best? I asked Pop.
"I've always said Ernie Nevers," I
Pop replied. "He's the greatest. !
They say these guys Nagurski and j
Blanchard and Standlee hit hard,
but they couldn't hit harder than
Ernie. He was the greatest line
bucker ever. He could do every
thing, and you could depend on
him."
He was the best football player
of all at Stanford, according to
Pop. "And not only that ... he
was the best football player of
all—period," adds Mr. Warner.
Other Stanford men, not of Pop's
reign, came in for their share of
praise. "This Grayson was a good
man," said Pop, "and Frankie Al
bert is the best quarter-back ever
developed at Stanford.
Pop answered questions on many and varied subjects. Some
he didn't want printed. But he didn't sidestep any of them. He
refused publicly to criticize anything or anyone.
So if this interview sounds like Pop is all honey and roses,
that is the way he wants it to be. He doesn't want to hurt anyone.
But he is far from unopinionated. He is gruff but not biting,
critical but not bitter.
