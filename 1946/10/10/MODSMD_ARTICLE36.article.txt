# POP LIKED WOW BOYS
## 
### 
Though Pop maintains the ability
} of such men as Nevers in the past
[ and such teams as the '40 Wow Boys
j —whom he calls the best material
! one coach ever had at a single time
S in history—he is not prone to use
. the line that so many sportsmen
| who are past their prime do.
They say, ''It's not like the old
J days." Bat not Pop.
He is fully aware of evolution
in biology or in football. "The
game keeps improving," Pop said.
"There is constant development
and I'm sure that the average
team of today would outclass the
average team of 20 years ago."
But that does not mean to Pop
j that the practices of 20 years ago,
largely his practices, are necessarily
inferior to those of today. For the
T-formation is older than the War
i ner wingback formations.
"But the refinement of technique
and , improvement of player devel
] opment has helped the game con
t siderably," said Mr. Warner.
WANTS RULES CHANGE
Just as the physical part of the
game has improved, so Pop want
ed the spectators' part of the game
I to progress. Claiming that the
| spectators get a thrill from seeing
a first down made, Fop has for
I many years advocated scoring a
point for every F.D. to offset any
bad break that could possibly cost
the better team the ball game.
So Pop still lives football, even if
! it's from the easy chair instead of
! the sideline bench. And today, as he
j spends his time playing bridge for a
few hours a day at the faculty club
with other Stanford profs (some also
retired), living quietly at home with
his wife, a cat and a dog, and often
going to a nearby football game at
Stanford Stadium or up in the city,
i Pop Warner is fading into the ob
! scurity that cloaks a private citizen,
j But whatever he has done, and
| whatever he says, is always deserv
ing of public attention.
