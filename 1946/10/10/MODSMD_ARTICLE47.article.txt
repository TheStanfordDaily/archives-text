# Comet Meteors Make Celestial Fireworks
## 
### 
Shooting meteors of the Giaco
bini-Zinner comet streaked into the
earth's ionosphere Wednesday night
and put on a show of celestial fire
works for West Coast residents
wherever the sky was clear and the
moon not too bright.
Astronomers in the eastern states,
from Maine to Florida, sadly called
off expeditions to the open spaces
after hearing weather forecasts that
the entire area would be overcast.
Above the clouds, however, and
far into the ionosphere—which is
above the stratosphere—the meteors
coming from the comet's orbit were
scheduled to reach their maximum
brilliance at about 7 or 7:30 p.m.,
PST.
