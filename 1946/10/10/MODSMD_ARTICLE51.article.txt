shapcd metal plate on which the strings are
strung. I .veil in a spinet it ordinarily weighs
well over 100 pounds.
4 *Too liea\ \ ! thought W inter t\ Company,
who make pianos. (If von've ever moved a
piano, \on II agree.) '"Let's have \leoa make
an aluminum plate.
So, Winter's piano designers and \lcoa en
gineers put t heir combined experiences together
lo develop an aluminum plate. First, a strong
aluminum allov had to he found because (he
strings put an 111-ton pull on the plate. V
special allov was produced, hut . . .
\s the strings don't pull in the same direc
tion or with the same force, in time the plate
would creep, cause distortion, and Ih«* strings
gel out of tune.
Alcoa engineers found a wax to tell exactly

where and how great the strains were . . .
figured out how to hit lance t lie stresses ami then
stabilize the [date bv an Alcoa-developed heat
treat ing process.
The result: The first successful aluminum
piano plate, weighing only 1"> pounds instead
of 12."), with tone qualitv enhanced.
I hat piano plate offers this le-son l<>r young
