We can't show Cal, if our cards
remain at the Coliseum!
Don't throw those cards up in
the air Saturday afternoon, if you
want to dazzle Cal at the Big
Game. Rally Com is pleading with
all students to save the cards that
will be used for stunts because of
a card shortage. All cards will be
collected after half-time.
