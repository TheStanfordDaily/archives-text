### 
NANKING, China, Oct. 10 (UP).
â€” Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek
returned China to full war standing
today and, simultaneously, Commu
nists reported that Chiang's air force
had carried out two crippling at
tacks on Kalgan, besieged Commu
nist stronghold in North China.
Th" decree, affecting some 300,-
000,000 people, restored military
control over all civilian administra
tion and reinstated military con
scription for all ablcbodicd males
between 18 and 45 years of age.
The air raids on Kalgan were
the lirst reported on the city itself
since Nationalist troops launched
their offensive against the strate
gic redoubt. The report said four
planes dropped explosives at X
a.m.. followed by a 12-plane
bomber formation at noon.
"Considerable loss of life'' was
reported in the ancient city, capital
of Chahar province and situated
just south of the Great Wall. Pre
viously th" air field alone had been
raided.
Chiang's sweeping decree was
interpreted as a virtual abandon
ment of hope for an end to the
civil fighting which has been rag
ing sporadically over the half of
China north of the Yangtsc River.
Observers said it might herald a
full-scale civil war.
The standing committee of the
Kuomintang's Central Executive
Committee, meanwhile, re-clected
Chiang as its president.
