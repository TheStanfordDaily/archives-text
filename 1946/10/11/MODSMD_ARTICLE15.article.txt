### 
LONDON, Oct. 10 (UP). â€”The
Russian general staff in Budapest
today rescinded a mysterious order
which banned all foreign air travel
over Czechoslovakia and Hungary
for 24 hours, but still flatly forbade
any flights across Romania.
Military and diplomatic sources in
J Washington believed the Russians
( issued the order to conceal troop
movements and maneuvers. One
diplomatic source said the Russians
were conducting troop maneuvers in
western Hungary with live ammu
nition.
Adding to the mystery was the
i fact that the ban at first was sup
j posed to have affected Czechoslova
| kia, Hungary and Romania for five
I days, from Oct. 9 until Oct. 15. Then
it was altered as swiftly and mys
| toriously as it had been imposed.
Pan-American Airways yesterday
received this order from United
States Army Air Force headquar
ters in Weisbaden, Germany: "No
United Stales aircraft, military or
commercial, will be cleared to fly
over or land in Hungary, Romania
or Czechoslovakia. It is imperative
that provisions of this directive be
complied with."
