# Truman to Confer On Meat Problem
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 10 (UP).—
j The gathering political storm over
| meat shortages sent President Tru-
I man into an emergency huddle with
I his Democratic party aides late to
[ day and he announced that he would
: lake up the crisis wilh his full cabi
j net tomorrow.
It was the first time Mr. Truman
■ has taken a direct hand in the meat
parleys which his worried political
! advisers have been holding all this
| week, and some observers believed
the President was preparing to
j abandon his "wait and see" policy
i in favor of a more forceful line of
I action.
Senator Claude Pepper admitted
that he. one of the most ardent
; champions of price control, was
becoming doubtful of the practi
cability of the existing law and
might vote for its outright repeal.
In New York today, buying or
ders poured into the stock market
| around midafternoon on a Wall
i Street rumor that meat would be
| decontrolled in a matter of hours.
The rise wiped out forenoon
j losses that had ranged to two
points and lifted prices for the
day about $750.0(10.000. The gain
also wiped out nearly half the loss
I of (he previous session when
| prices had hit a new low since
April 10. 1945.
Bullishness was helped by an
! other and equally unproved rumor,
l that OPA would be wiped out, with
the exception of controls on rents,
I within 48 hours.
The day's heavy buying centered
I on the packing shares, where gains
I ranged to four points in Cudahv.
