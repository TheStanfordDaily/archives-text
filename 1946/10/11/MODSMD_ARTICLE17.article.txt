# Underdog Indians Go South Tonight
## 'Battle for Rose Bowl' Seen With U.C.L.A. Favored 3 to 1 
### LOU FLEMING 
Marchie Schwartz's undefeated Stanford Indians board tho
Lark tonight en route to their most important engagement of tho
year, Saturday's battle with Bert Laßrucherie's UCLA Bruins.
On the bad end of three to one odds, the Indians will be
fighting an uphill battle in the game that the dopesters pick to
i decide the 1947 Rose Bowl team.

♦ A capacity crowd of 100,0(10 fan:;
is expected at the immense Coli
seum to see the week-end's most
decisive game. Both teams are bat
ting 1.000 as they move into their
third match of the season, and with
the exception of Stanford's Pete
August and Jim Cox, the two titans
of Pacific Coast football will he ;>t
full strength.

An added incentive to win Sat'
urday's "crucial game" against
UCLA was the announcement
that Stanford's terrific eleven will
play in Honolulu Dec. 21 against
the University of Hawaii, pro
vided "we do not go to the Rose
Bowl." The quotes are Director
of Athletics A 1 Masters', who ar
ranged the game with Hawaiian
Director of Athletics Francois
d'Elisou. In the event the Cards
go, they will probably fly to the
Islands after finals, about Dec. 15
or 16.

If the Bruin line rates as high as
pre-game stories indicate, Stanford
may shift the accent of its offense to
the air. In that case it will be one
of the hottest aerial duels waged
this season, for passing is the
Bruins' offensive mainstay.
lii two games the UCLA squad
rolled up 411 yards through the air
compared to Stanford's 223. If the
attacks come down to earth, how
ever, the Redskins will boast, a slighl
statistical advantage. Paced by full
back Lloyd Merriman, the Indians
have rolled up 635 yards on the
ground this year against the Bruins'
577.
Realizing their aerial weakness,
the Redshirts spent much of their
drill time this week perfecting their
passes while the Bruins turned their
attention to the ground attack and
defense.
Coach Marchie summed up Stan
ford's big problem in the game. It's
not the formation of the Bruins, for
like Stanford they operate out. of
the now-traditional T. "It's a ques
tion of personalities," said the In
dians head football mentor.
And in Ernie Case, their pass
projecting quarterback, and C*:.«l
Rossi, the sticky fingered back,
the Bruins have some dangerous
personlities. But UCLA cannot
field a fullback the equal of Stan
ford's Merriman.
Looking deeper into the record
books, the teams aren't very far
apart statistically speaking. In their

I their 33-7 march through the Wash
j ington Huskies, simple addition
J gives the Bruins a total f>f 83 points;
| to the opponents' 20; their total net
I yardage adds up to 988. Stanford,
[ breezing 45-0 through Idaho and
33-7 over USF allowed only one
score by their opponents while
amassing 78 points; through tin* air
and on the ground they totalled 8. r >K
yards. Of their 13 touchdowns, the
Bruins made 5 in the air; Stanford,
scored 4 of their 12 on aerials
Phd Bengtson, Stanford's line
i coach, has one of the biggest
headaches of the game. With lit
tle or no competition in their
j first two appearances, the Indian
forward wall turned in perfect
showings. But faced with the
| UCLA line, called by many the
best in the West, they will be
I shoulder-pel high in trouble.
Unless they can hold their own.
the rambling running attack of the
Cardinals will be stalled before it
j starts.
At Thursday's last full-dress re
| hearsal, Stanford looked solid from
center to fullback. The squad ran
through their old and new' offensive
plays, showing terrific improvement
from their haphazard workout on
Monday.
Marchie, satisfied with the
i squad, scheduled only a 30-min
ute drill in sweat clothes Friday.
As the squadmen moved off the
practice (ield. he commented: "A
good drill. We're going to win."
And he looked as if he meant it.
Starting Saturday will be the

{ USF, with two exceptions. Charlie
Wakefield will fill the tackle posi
tion vacated -by injured Cox and
Dick Flatland will take over ailing
August's job at center. In the back
field will be Buck Brownson at
j quarter, Bob Anderson and George
! Quist at half, Merriman at fullback.

An added incentive to win Sat'
urday's "crucial game" against
UCLA was the announcement
that Stanford's terrific eleven will
play in Honolulu Dec. 21 against
the University of Hawaii, pro
vided "we do not go to the Rose
Bowl." The quotes are Director
of Athletics A 1 Masters', who ar
ranged the game with Hawaiian
Director of Athletics Francois
d'Elisou. In the event the Cards
go, they will probably fly to the
Islands after finals, about Dec. 15
or 16.

If the Bruin line rates as high as
pre-game stories indicate, Stanford
may shift the accent of its offense to
the air. In that case it will be one
of the hottest aerial duels waged
this season, for passing is the
Bruins' offensive mainstay.
lii two games the UCLA squad
rolled up 411 yards through the air
compared to Stanford's 223. If the
attacks come down to earth, how
ever, the Redskins will boast, a slighl
statistical advantage. Paced by full
back Lloyd Merriman, the Indians
have rolled up 635 yards on the
ground this year against the Bruins'
577.
Realizing their aerial weakness,
the Redshirts spent much of their
drill time this week perfecting their
passes while the Bruins turned their
attention to the ground attack and
defense.
Coach Marchie summed up Stan
ford's big problem in the game. It's
not the formation of the Bruins, for
like Stanford they operate out. of
the now-traditional T. "It's a ques
tion of personalities," said the In
dians head football mentor.
And in Ernie Case, their pass
projecting quarterback, and C*:.«l
Rossi, the sticky fingered back,
the Bruins have some dangerous
personlities. But UCLA cannot
field a fullback the equal of Stan
ford's Merriman.

books, the teams aren't very far
