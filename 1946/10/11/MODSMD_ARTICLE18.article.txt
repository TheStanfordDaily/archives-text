On a trial basis spring quarter was a policy
whereby women's living groups remained
open until 1:30 Saturday nights so that women
could bring their dates in after 12. The plan
w is instigated and promoted by living group
pre-sidv nts through their legislative medium,
Women's Conference. They felt that houses
should be open to students having no place
to (jo after 12; they thought there was wide
upread need for a plan of this type which
would make living groups more like home.
Certain rules were included in the plan's
final form. Among these were requirements
that every living group have a hostess on duty
or someone in charge of the living group be
tween 12 and 1:30; that girls could not bring
their dates in unless they had taken a late
leave. But for the most part each living group
could plan its "after the dance social hour"

as it wanted to. Hostesses in some houses ar
ranged for refreshments to be served.
Since the plan was on trial, a report was to
be made this fall on the success of the experi
ment and the advisability of continuing it. As
yet, there has been no report; consequently
the living groups are not open until 1:30 on
Saturdays.
Dean Stalnaker said that after the policy
was adopted in the spring, no great use was
made of the privilege, that interest was spas
modic. This situation resulted in spite of the
fact that the plan was presented to him with
tremendous fanfare, he said.
Because the response to the plan did not
warrant action by the Dean of Students' of
fice, Mr. Stalnaker said, any program to re
enact it will have to come from the women
students through their representatives on
Women's Conference. N. B.
