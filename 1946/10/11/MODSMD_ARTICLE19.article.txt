Hi.re it is. The story of how the Stanford Axe
was stolen, what has happened to the case which is
mi: sing, and why it was returned.
Tin' story was told to me yesterday by a Stan
foul student who is a close friend of one of the men
who slole the lamed Axe on the night of April 28.
He i k'-pt silent until now for fear of involving
th< i■ < ii who took it. Now, with the Axe returned,
h< 11 I free to reveal the incident.
Tt Axe was taken by students of the University
of California. The theft was not an involved, pre
arranged plot but a spontaneous affair.
Five Cal students, not four or six as has been
reported, were at Carmel with an automobile and a
light pickup truck. On the way home, one suggested
that they stop at Stanford and steal the Axe. Al
though his suggestion was riot at first taken seri
ously. they decided to stop and see if it could easily
be taken from its place in the Cellar.
They enter d the Cellar, bought a candy bar, and
looked the situation over. Seeing that the theft was
feasible, they threatened the Cellar attendant, picked
up the ens \ and started out the door. To an in
coming Stanford student, the only other person in
the Cellar, they explained they were "taking it to
a 112 .iternity." He held the door open for them while
they earn'd it out.
They loaded the ease in the back of the pickup
truck and started off. To their dismay, the other
automobile would not run. They pushed it with the
pickup ti uck to start it and then drove up Highway
101 t<> the Bay Bridge and across that to the Cal

campus while Farm students and police searched back
roads.
Instead of being the heroes they had expected to
he, they discovered upon their arrival at Cal that the
university was threatening to take extremely severe
measures against whoever had broken the pact be
tween the two schools.
They thus found it impossible to present the
Axe to Cal us had planned and instead it had
become a white elephant on their hands. To have
been found with it would have meant probable ex
pulsion.
The Axe was passed from members of one fra
ternity to another, none wanting to keep it for fear
of involving their house. It was kept not on campus
but in Berkeley at various places. They were faced
with the problem of how to get rid of it without
their identity being revealed.
Last weekend's conference between a Stanford
representative and Cal stndent body officers and
fraternity men paved the way for the return of the
famed Axe, which was discovered Tuesday night in
the back seat of a Palo Alto squad car.
That was the story as told to me by a Village stu
dent, a member of the Merchant Marine, who was
told the incident on board ship last summer by one
of the Cal men who participated in the theft.
Also cleared up was the mystery of what hap
pened to the case, which was not returned with the
Axe. Being too bulky to conceal, it was broken up
and thrown away in the Berkeley foothills.
So there is the last chapter in the mystery of the
latest stealing of the Axe. "80" has been written to
another legend 1 of the Cal-Stanford tradition.

who slole the lamed Axe on the night of April 28.
He i k'-pt silent until now for fear of involving
th< i■ < ii who took it. Now, with the Axe returned,
h< 11 I free to reveal the incident.
Tt Axe was taken by students of the University
of California. The theft was not an involved, pre
arranged plot but a spontaneous affair.
Five Cal students, not four or six as has been
reported, were at Carmel with an automobile and a
light pickup truck. On the way home, one suggested
that they stop at Stanford and steal the Axe. Al
though his suggestion was riot at first taken seri
ously. they decided to stop and see if it could easily
be taken from its place in the Cellar.
They enter d the Cellar, bought a candy bar, and
looked the situation over. Seeing that the theft was
feasible, they threatened the Cellar attendant, picked
up the ens \ and started out the door. To an in
coming Stanford student, the only other person in
the Cellar, they explained they were "taking it to
a 112 .iternity." He held the door open for them while
they earn'd it out.
They loaded the ease in the back of the pickup
truck and started off. To their dismay, the other
automobile would not run. They pushed it with the
pickup ti uck to start it and then drove up Highway
101 t<> the Bay Bridge and across that to the Cal

campus while Farm students and police searched back
roads.
Instead of being the heroes they had expected to
he, they discovered upon their arrival at Cal that the
university was threatening to take extremely severe
measures against whoever had broken the pact be
tween the two schools.
They thus found it impossible to present the
Axe to Cal us had planned and instead it had
become a white elephant on their hands. To have
been found with it would have meant probable ex
pulsion.
The Axe was passed from members of one fra
ternity to another, none wanting to keep it for fear
of involving their house. It was kept not on campus
but in Berkeley at various places. They were faced
with the problem of how to get rid of it without
their identity being revealed.
Last weekend's conference between a Stanford
representative and Cal stndent body officers and
fraternity men paved the way for the return of the
famed Axe, which was discovered Tuesday night in
the back seat of a Palo Alto squad car.
That was the story as told to me by a Village stu
dent, a member of the Merchant Marine, who was
told the incident on board ship last summer by one
of the Cal men who participated in the theft.
Also cleared up was the mystery of what hap
pened to the case, which was not returned with the
Axe. Being too bulky to conceal, it was broken up
and thrown away in the Berkeley foothills.
So there is the last chapter in the mystery of the
latest stealing of the Axe. "80" has been written to
another legend 1 of the Cal-Stanford tradition.
Hi.re it is. The story of how the Stanford Axe
was stolen, what has happened to the case which is
mi: sing, and why it was returned.
Tin' story was told to me yesterday by a Stan
foul student who is a close friend of one of the men
who slole the lamed Axe on the night of April 28.
