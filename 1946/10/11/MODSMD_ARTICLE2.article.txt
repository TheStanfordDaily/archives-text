# Danube Open To Navigation
## 
### 
PARIS, Friday, Oct. 11 (UP).—
The peace conference plenary ses
sion approved at 2 a.m. today a Ro
manian treaty in which the prin
ciple of free navigation on the vital
Danube River waterway received a
two-thirds majority over bitter So
viet protests.
Approval of the Romanian treaty,
second of five Axis satellite treaties
under consideration, leaves only the
Hungarian, Bulgarian and Finnish
treaties to be voted upon before
the peace conference adjournment
deadline next Tuesday.
Another proposal obligating Ro
mania to attend a meeting within
six months to establish a perma
nent international regime for the
vital waterway was approved 15
to (». Both issues now go to the
HiK Four Foreign Ministers' Coun
cil as formal conference recom
mendations.
Russia opposed free navigation,
contending instead that the problem
should be decided upon by the
Danube riparian states alone and
should not be included in the Bal
kan treaties.
The conference also voted after
two hours of argument over pro
cedure to prohibit motor torpedo
boats to the three Balkan nations
—Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary
—and to Finland.
This proposal, advanced by Sec
retary of State James F. Byrnes,
was opposed by Soviet Foreign Min
ister Viacheslav M. Molotov, who
as chairman supported a Polish ar
gument that it was a new proposal
and therefore out of order.
The conference, however, voted
11 to 7 to put the resolution to a
vote and then approved prohibi
tion of motor torpedo boats to all
Axis satellites by 15 to I!.
The conference also adopted with
out objection an article to return all
of Transylvania to Romania and by
a two-thirds vote a British proposal
to prohibit the resurrection of anti-
Semitism in Romania.
