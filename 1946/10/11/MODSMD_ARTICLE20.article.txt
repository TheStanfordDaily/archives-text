# BILL STRUTHERS
## QUAD-SIDE 
### 
A weekend, a week, and a good weekend coining
up. They alternate pleasantly and the sun shines on
Jill of them. You come up for air and realize the
quarter is well under way and still you haven't run
into all the people you've heard were back. Here's
some you may or may not have met:
Jack Hart well, whose claim to fame is a solo flight
through a fourth-floor Gncina window to the bushes
below, non-stop with a lough landing. The body is
hack in shape and carrying Jack through law school
now.
Yell-leader Bill Lippincotl, a little hair and a lot
of heard behind a voice and spirit that carries well,
looked good on the stadium boardwalk last Saturday.
Dave Costo transferred here from a Philadelphia
I'lui 4 "on named Drexel. Some people say; he was
> '« hi both ways when he first married a C'al gal,
then brought her to Stanford. Dave and Ruth were
staying in the guest room at the Tresidder homo
while waiting for their apartment to be finished.
Dave is the President's chauffeur. Sounds like a good
job, judging by the number of times I've seen Mr. T
pedalling his bike along the Quad.
Howard Hoffman, biz school boy, decided to start
the week right. He got to his Monday morning class
1i 'i minutes before eight. He sat alone in the empty
room, very pleased with himself, and began review
ing his notes. No. you wouldn't get old Hoffman flat
footed this morning. The rest of the class arrived
: nd each went straight to the professor's table and
left a piece of paper. What are those pieces of paper?
Howie asks. Seems there was an assignment he
missed. Some days you just can't win, says Hoffman.
Mary Larkin, a junior from Union, might not say
much, but when she does speak she covers the situ
ation thoroughly in a very few words. She and her
date had just left a dance, they were riding through
1 he campus in silence, when Mary looked out the
cai window and realized where she was. "But 1 don't
live in the cactus garden; I live in the Union," she
said.
Here s one to show how the war changed the cam
pus. CJus, the old Gncina bootblack, is now working
in a barber shop in town. Ask him why he deserted

the Rock and he'll answer something like this: "Them
jinny shoes is just too big."
II you want to know the moral of the drunken
CM., the impure woman, and the decadent French,
just ask Villager Jim Morris, back from duty with
an M.P. battalion in France.
There's one character you shouldn't meet —as
many did last night—without collecting a few of the
stories that go with him. Sergeant Casey, the name.
He's a short, small-nosed, red-faced little guy, about
forty-five, but doesn't show or act it. Large, thick,
round glasses that lit close to his face, usually wearing
an old sweatshirt and a beatup pair of sneakers. The
thing that makes Casey is that, surplus of old college
spirit. Really the rah-rah. He does the perennial
sophomore one better; he's a perpetual freshman.
Casey leads the best Axe yell, sings the most stirring
songs, and talks the best game. In fact, he's been
the number one Beltramo's quarterback for 25 years.
One of the current yarns on Casey is that he was
a Stanford student here when War One took him ovit.
He came back, couldn't go to school, no G.I. Bill of
Kights, but he did "join the band." He has known
every athlete and character who's gone through
Stanford. King-size characters at that. Casey claims
that he and Doodles Weaver composed "The Rose of
No Man's Land," and he'll sing it when he's had the
right combination of brew and buddies. As for fra
ternities, Casey has always preferred the D.U.'s,
Dekes, and Zetes. There's some speculation concern
ing the number of pledge pins he may have caged.
The amazing thing about Casey is his memory. When
a guy remembers all the Stanford teams for 25 years,
that's not too much. The Pacific Coast Conference
is doing better. But Casey keeps the Eastern teams
in mind too. He can tell you things like who kicked
the winning point of a 13 to 12 Columbia-Cornell
game back in '28. Further, he can tell you the names
of all the players and whether or not it rained that
day. Not that he was there, not that he's right—l
don't know anybody who's every checked him—but
he certainly sounds convincing. Casey explained
this ability once by saying he had been a newspaper
man. At the time he was working in a local ware
house; now lie's at the ball park back qf the S.P.
depot and still keeping liberal office hours at
Carina's.

There's one character you shouldn't meet —as
many did last night—without collecting a few of the
stories that go with him. Sergeant Casey, the name.
He's a short, small-nosed, red-faced little guy, about
forty-five, but doesn't show or act it. Large, thick,
round glasses that lit close to his face, usually wearing
an old sweatshirt and a beatup pair of sneakers. The
thing that makes Casey is that, surplus of old college
spirit. Really the rah-rah. He does the perennial
sophomore one better; he's a perpetual freshman.
Casey leads the best Axe yell, sings the most stirring
songs, and talks the best game. In fact, he's been
the number one Beltramo's quarterback for 25 years.
One of the current yarns on Casey is that he was
a Stanford student here when War One took him ovit.
He came back, couldn't go to school, no G.I. Bill of
Kights, but he did "join the band." He has known
every athlete and character who's gone through
Stanford. King-size characters at that. Casey claims
that he and Doodles Weaver composed "The Rose of
No Man's Land," and he'll sing it when he's had the
right combination of brew and buddies. As for fra
ternities, Casey has always preferred the D.U.'s,
Dekes, and Zetes. There's some speculation concern
ing the number of pledge pins he may have caged.
The amazing thing about Casey is his memory. When
a guy remembers all the Stanford teams for 25 years,
that's not too much. The Pacific Coast Conference
is doing better. But Casey keeps the Eastern teams
in mind too. He can tell you things like who kicked
the winning point of a 13 to 12 Columbia-Cornell
game back in '28. Further, he can tell you the names
of all the players and whether or not it rained that
day. Not that he was there, not that he's right—l
don't know anybody who's every checked him—but
he certainly sounds convincing. Casey explained
this ability once by saying he had been a newspaper
man. At the time he was working in a local ware
house; now lie's at the ball park back qf the S.P.
depot and still keeping liberal office hours at
Carina's.
A weekend, a week, and a good weekend coining
up. They alternate pleasantly and the sun shines on
Jill of them. You come up for air and realize the
quarter is well under way and still you haven't run
into all the people you've heard were back. Here's
some you may or may not have met:
Jack Hart well, whose claim to fame is a solo flight
through a fourth-floor Gncina window to the bushes
below, non-stop with a lough landing. The body is
hack in shape and carrying Jack through law school
now.
Yell-leader Bill Lippincotl, a little hair and a lot
of heard behind a voice and spirit that carries well,
looked good on the stadium boardwalk last Saturday.
Dave Costo transferred here from a Philadelphia
I'lui 4 "on named Drexel. Some people say; he was
> '« hi both ways when he first married a C'al gal,
then brought her to Stanford. Dave and Ruth were
staying in the guest room at the Tresidder homo
while waiting for their apartment to be finished.
Dave is the President's chauffeur. Sounds like a good
job, judging by the number of times I've seen Mr. T
pedalling his bike along the Quad.
Howard Hoffman, biz school boy, decided to start
the week right. He got to his Monday morning class
1i 'i minutes before eight. He sat alone in the empty
room, very pleased with himself, and began review
ing his notes. No. you wouldn't get old Hoffman flat
footed this morning. The rest of the class arrived
: nd each went straight to the professor's table and
left a piece of paper. What are those pieces of paper?
Howie asks. Seems there was an assignment he
missed. Some days you just can't win, says Hoffman.
Mary Larkin, a junior from Union, might not say
much, but when she does speak she covers the situ
ation thoroughly in a very few words. She and her
date had just left a dance, they were riding through
1 he campus in silence, when Mary looked out the
cai window and realized where she was. "But 1 don't
live in the cactus garden; I live in the Union," she
said.
Here s one to show how the war changed the cam
pus. CJus, the old Gncina bootblack, is now working
in a barber shop in town. Ask him why he deserted

the Rock and he'll answer something like this: "Them
jinny shoes is just too big."
II you want to know the moral of the drunken
CM., the impure woman, and the decadent French,
just ask Villager Jim Morris, back from duty with
an M.P. battalion in France.

some you may or may not have met:
Jack Hart well, whose claim to fame is a solo flight
through a fourth-floor Gncina window to the bushes
below, non-stop with a lough landing. The body is
hack in shape and carrying Jack through law school
now.
Yell-leader Bill Lippincotl, a little hair and a lot
of heard behind a voice and spirit that carries well,
looked good on the stadium boardwalk last Saturday.
Dave Costo transferred here from a Philadelphia
I'lui 4 "on named Drexel. Some people say; he was
> '« hi both ways when he first married a C'al gal,
then brought her to Stanford. Dave and Ruth were
staying in the guest room at the Tresidder homo
while waiting for their apartment to be finished.
Dave is the President's chauffeur. Sounds like a good
job, judging by the number of times I've seen Mr. T
pedalling his bike along the Quad.
Howard Hoffman, biz school boy, decided to start
the week right. He got to his Monday morning class
1i 'i minutes before eight. He sat alone in the empty
room, very pleased with himself, and began review
ing his notes. No. you wouldn't get old Hoffman flat
footed this morning. The rest of the class arrived
: nd each went straight to the professor's table and
left a piece of paper. What are those pieces of paper?
Howie asks. Seems there was an assignment he
missed. Some days you just can't win, says Hoffman.
Mary Larkin, a junior from Union, might not say
much, but when she does speak she covers the situ
ation thoroughly in a very few words. She and her
date had just left a dance, they were riding through
1 he campus in silence, when Mary looked out the
cai window and realized where she was. "But 1 don't
live in the cactus garden; I live in the Union," she
said.
Here s one to show how the war changed the cam
pus. CJus, the old Gncina bootblack, is now working
in a barber shop in town. Ask him why he deserted

the Rock and he'll answer something like this: "Them
jinny shoes is just too big."
II you want to know the moral of the drunken
CM., the impure woman, and the decadent French,
just ask Villager Jim Morris, back from duty with
an M.P. battalion in France.
There's one character you shouldn't meet —as
many did last night—without collecting a few of the
stories that go with him. Sergeant Casey, the name.
He's a short, small-nosed, red-faced little guy, about
forty-five, but doesn't show or act it. Large, thick,
round glasses that lit close to his face, usually wearing
an old sweatshirt and a beatup pair of sneakers. The
thing that makes Casey is that, surplus of old college
spirit. Really the rah-rah. He does the perennial
sophomore one better; he's a perpetual freshman.
Casey leads the best Axe yell, sings the most stirring
songs, and talks the best game. In fact, he's been
the number one Beltramo's quarterback for 25 years.
One of the current yarns on Casey is that he was
a Stanford student here when War One took him ovit.
He came back, couldn't go to school, no G.I. Bill of
Kights, but he did "join the band." He has known
every athlete and character who's gone through
Stanford. King-size characters at that. Casey claims
that he and Doodles Weaver composed "The Rose of
No Man's Land," and he'll sing it when he's had the
right combination of brew and buddies. As for fra
ternities, Casey has always preferred the D.U.'s,
Dekes, and Zetes. There's some speculation concern
ing the number of pledge pins he may have caged.
The amazing thing about Casey is his memory. When
a guy remembers all the Stanford teams for 25 years,
that's not too much. The Pacific Coast Conference
is doing better. But Casey keeps the Eastern teams
in mind too. He can tell you things like who kicked
the winning point of a 13 to 12 Columbia-Cornell
game back in '28. Further, he can tell you the names
of all the players and whether or not it rained that
day. Not that he was there, not that he's right—l
don't know anybody who's every checked him—but
he certainly sounds convincing. Casey explained
this ability once by saying he had been a newspaper
man. At the time he was working in a local ware
house; now lie's at the ball park back qf the S.P.
depot and still keeping liberal office hours at
Carina's.
A weekend, a week, and a good weekend coining
up. They alternate pleasantly and the sun shines on
Jill of them. You come up for air and realize the
quarter is well under way and still you haven't run
into all the people you've heard were back. Here's
