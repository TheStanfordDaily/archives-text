Dear Evnn T. Pugh:
The next time you ask me to go
over my Econ I notes you better
make sure you know what you're
talking about. I checked this ar
ticle with one of the professors who
leach Econ I here. Did you?
Another Stanford professor- who,
incidentally, also teaches Econ I
writes:
". . . it should be noted that the
security (my note: war bonds) hold
ers will be found mainly in the
upper income groups and among the
banking institutions. Consequently
(he additional taxation, even though
it is highly progressive, will prob
ably rest upon (ho lower income
groups much more in proportion to
their holdings of government secu
rities." (Bernard F. Haley in Amer.
Econ. Hev. Proceedings, Vol. XXX,
No. 5, Feb. 1941, p. 77.)
