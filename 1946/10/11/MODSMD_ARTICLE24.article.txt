# Meteors Flashing Across Sky 'Heard' by Stanford Scientists
## 
### 
Not content merely to sc? the shower of fiery meteors from the tail of
the Giacobini-Zinner comet flash across the sky last night, five Stanford
scientists listened to the whistle of the meteors diving into our atmosphere.
By means of sensitive radio receivers, Dr. Hugh Skilling, executive head
of the Electrical Engineering Department, R. A. Helliwell, Lawrence Man-

ning, William Evans, and O. G.
lard, Jr., heard a whistle varying in j
pitch each time a meteor came into !
view.
The trail of a meteor reflects
radio waves such as were sent out
by low-power signals from a trans
mitter here.
Best results, however, were «»b
-tained by tuning receivers to ordi
nary short-wave stations. The war
time increase in numbers of high
power short-wave broadcasting sta
tions has given more listeners op
portunity to hear the whistles.
it is believed (hat the Stanford
scientists are among the first to def
initely correlate meteors "heard"
with meteors "seen."
The group believes that study of
meteors by radio will provide val
uable data on the behavior of the
ionosphere, giving further clues to
the nature of the atmosphere 100
miles above the earth.
