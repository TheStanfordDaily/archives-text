# SMILEY FARKAS
## IT SAYS HERE: 
### 
Smiley Furkas wus again too lazy to write his column, but here is a
letter he received from H. D. Thoreau. It is undoubtedly more interesting
than anything Farkas might have had to say:
Dear Smiley:
"The following men will report («» Ted Gossard ... to direct parkin*;
al the Coliseum for (he USC-Washinglon Slate football game Friday night,
the UCLA-Oregon State game Saturday afternoon, and the professional
game Sunday afternoon:
"(iene I lock, Alex llanniiin, Tom Shanley, Fred Winter, Bob Howard,
Dick Frey, Earl Wallis. Boh Kloppenherg, Hob Webster, and Gordon Trigg."
The above two paragraphs, reprinted from a recent copy of the Daily
Trojan, organ of the Associated Students of the University of Southern
California, are interesting for two reasons.
First, they show the amazing array of basketball talent lurking in the
by-ways near Figueroa and Exposition streets.
Second, they show one way in which that university legitimately helps
deserving athletes, as well as other students, defray expenses. If you hear
any occupants ol the local linament lounge complain that our school isn't
taking care of them, point out that Gene Coldiron, healthy halfback in the
days of the decline and fall of "Tiny" Thornhill, is even now looking for
additional help to handle the eager autumn throng which invades the
sycamore glades surrounding the stadium every Saturday.
* * *
To turn back to the Trojan's hoop and hardwood herd, however, let me
refresh your memory: Kloppenherg, Webster, and Shanley were members
of last winter's fine live; Rock, Hannum, and Frey belonged to pre-war
USC teams, Rock being a small sensation; Winters and Howard are guard
transfers from Oregon State and Oregon, respectively, where they per
formed admirably; Trigg and Wallis are promising eome-latelies.
Add to this list Boh llendron. 6-foot 8-inch youngster, and Marty
Pelka and Fred Bertram, a couple of anonymous aces, and you have the
team which might well finish last in the Southern Division Pacific Coast
Conference basketball standings this coming season.
That bears repeating: I think U.S.C. will finish last in the 194(1-47
basketball race.
If you think that's awry, wait until you hear what comes next.
Stanford, with the following excellent material and the best coach in
the business, will have to fight hard to keep from finishing in the cellar.
Leading the Cards this winter will be Howie Dallmar, sophomore star
of the 1942 National Collegiate champions at Stanford, and later all
two varsity cage campaigns at Westvvood; John (Babe) Higgens, a trans
planted Indian who won all-conference honors at Cal during the war; Dave
Davidson, second in Big Seven Conference scoring only to all-American
Arnold Ferrin, while in Colorado's navy unit in '4.'5; Bill Stevenson and
Morley Thompson, a pair of frosh phenoms; Dick Berlin, a pre-war fresh
man liigh-scorer; all of last year's unconscious squad; and maybe Grant
Denmark and Dave Brown, two large and experienced boys who've seen
service with the St. Mary's Pre-Flight and Olympic Club teams.
Everett Dean's team this year should be improved 500 per cent over
the '4!)-'4(i outfit, but they look like a third place team in this heavy
competition.

AI Berkeley they swear up and down that their coming cagers will he
the best in the history of the school. I believe them, but. I also believe
that they'll have to be content with second place.
Andy Wolfe, high-scoring forward on last year's Bear five, will be just
another ball player when Nibs Price looks over his talent this fall. Chuck
Hanger and Jack Rocker are big and very good. Here are a few nnfl-e
names you'll hear from: Cuneo, Durkee, Hooper, Farrell, Wray, Walker.
Ilogehoom, and Wolfe's little brother, Bill.
Yes, a good runner-up team.
:!: $ * St
This leaves the championship to U.C.L.A. and they're the team to I
fake it.
Their center will be Don Barksdale, lanky Negro, who led all basketball
players in the country in scoring last winter while playing for the Camp
Ross five. Barksdale was a one-man sensation at Marin J.C. and at West- ,
wood before the war for half a season. Another Negro lad named Minor 1
single-handedly made Toledo U. one of the nation's best teams in '45, and !
hopes to do the same for the Bruins come December.
The entire Sacramento J.C. team has enrolled.at U.C.L.A. this fall.
This team won the national jaysee tourney last year and did very well
against the "semi-pros" in the A.A.U. championships at Denver. However, '
these live men, Bob Linck, John Stanich, Wayne Bolding, Elden Bennett,
and Doug Sale, will have trouble breaking into the Bruin's lineup.
A dozen pre-war lettermen including Dick West and Marv Lee are I
back also, plus last year's star, CJjuck Clustka. Red Speicher and Don !
Barker who were teammates of Barksdale's at Camp Ross for the past two
seasons have joined him at the southern campus. They played for Bowling
Green and Missouri before entering the army.
And so it goes, on and on.
Smiley, take my advice and get your basketball tickets early. There
are only t!0 shopping days left 'til our conference opener.—H. D. Thoreau-. i
