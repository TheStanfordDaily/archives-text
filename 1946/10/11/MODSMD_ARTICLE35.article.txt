# Cards Drop Bosox 12-3; Series Tied At Two All
## 
### 
BOSTON. Oct. 10 (UP).—Pitch
er George (Big Red) Munger and
the record-blasting bats of the St.
Louis Cardinals scored a 12 to 3
victory over Boston's Red Sox to
day and squared the World Series
at two games all.
Those Cardinal bats blasted 20
hits during the afternoon off six Red
Sox pitchers. That equalled the
World Series record set by the New
York Yankees on Oct. 7, 1021. The
six Red Sox pitchers also equalled
a World Series record.
The Red Sox got nine bits-—a to
tal of 29 sale base knocks for the
afternoon.
It was a hitter's field day, every
man in the Cardinal lineup bit
safely at least once. Country
Slaughter had four hits, including
a home run. Swarthy little Joe
Garagiola, the Cards kid catcher,
also had four. So did the veteran
Wally Moses of the Red Sox.
Bobby Doerr got two for four,
one a two-run homer.
Munger, a tough Texan out of the
army less than two months, had lit
tle else but a fast ball to uphold the
faith of Manager Eddie Dyer, who
gave him the assignment in order to
rest his weary hill stars. But Big
Red had a heart as big as a water
melon and it carried him out of re
peated jams through the cloudy,
chilly afternoon before the 33,045
fans.
The Red Sox had him in trouble
in almost every inning. But with
sparkling defensive play behind him
and those 20 Cardinal hits, there
was never a moment when the out
come was in doubt.
BOSTON, Oct. 10 (UP).—Ed
Barrow, who managed the Boston
Red Sox to their last world cham
pionship 28 years ago, said tonight
owner Tom Yawkey assured him
he never would trade Ted Will
iams.
"I told Yawkey to give the boy
bis head," Barrow said. "He'll
straighten out, I said, don't trade
him."
Yawkey smiled and replied "I
never will."

i BOSTON, Oct. 10 (UP).—lt was
i almost quiet enough to hear a bomb
drop in the Cardinal dressing room
today when tough Enos Slaughter,
the little guy with the big stick,
I dropped it.
"Whadda ya think," he whoop
ed above the roar of his happy
teammates, who had just pulver
ized l lit- Red Sox. 12 to 11. "I was
coming to the plate in that big
ninth inning and Umpire Charley
Berry says to me. 'Enos if you hit
i now you'll break a record for
| yourself and another for your
1 team.' So Clem Dreisewcnl. the
| Huston pitcher serves one in there
hig as a balloon, the best pitch 1
i had ail day long and I went after
i it.
"But I was trying too hard and I
] just popped up. If Berry hadn't told
;me that 1 probably would have
j whaled the ball out of the park."
Slaughter, the day's hitting hero,
wasn't too upset about it. For he
was the fellow, this underslung
: slugger from Koxboro, N.C., who
started the Cardinals off on their
[ 20-hit carnage with a tremendous
! second-inning home run.
! Manager Eddie Dyer was too ex
; plosively happy to worry about rec
| orcls.
"Boy we really were on the hit
parade," he said. '"And that Red
j Monger, did he pitch his heart out
after he got the ants out of his
pants."
Dyer said he was concerned about
i Munger in the early innings when
, the Red Sox were hitting his fast
I stuff lor booming outfield blows that
the • track team Cardinal outfield
j dragged down.
The Red Sox dressing room was
; as quiet as a library.
Manager Joe Cronin, taking the
1 defeat philosophically, said "if we're
gonna get beat it doesn't make much
difference what the score is."
But his manner belied his mood
| for he seemed concerned about
I sending either southpaw Mickey
Harris c. curveballer Joe Dobson
| against the Cards' lefthanded aee,
Howie Pollet.

a home run. Swarthy little Joe
Garagiola, the Cards kid catcher,

Wally Moses of the Red Sox.
Bobby Doerr got two for four,

Munger, a tough Texan out of the

tle else but a fast ball to uphold the
faith of Manager Eddie Dyer, who
gave him the assignment in order to
rest his weary hill stars. But Big
Red had a heart as big as a water
melon and it carried him out of re
peated jams through the cloudy,
chilly afternoon before the 33,045
fans.
The Red Sox had him in trouble

BOSTON. Oct. 10 (UP).—Pitch
er George (Big Red) Munger and
the record-blasting bats of the St.
Louis Cardinals scored a 12 to 3
victory over Boston's Red Sox to
day and squared the World Series
at two games all.
Those Cardinal bats blasted 20
hits during the afternoon off six Red
Sox pitchers. That equalled the
World Series record set by the New
York Yankees on Oct. 7, 1021. The
six Red Sox pitchers also equalled
a World Series record.
The Red Sox got nine bits-—a to
tal of 29 sale base knocks for the
afternoon.
It was a hitter's field day, every
man in the Cardinal lineup bit
safely at least once. Country
Slaughter had four hits, including
a home run. Swarthy little Joe
Garagiola, the Cards kid catcher,
also had four. So did the veteran
Wally Moses of the Red Sox.
Bobby Doerr got two for four,
one a two-run homer.
Munger, a tough Texan out of the
army less than two months, had lit
tle else but a fast ball to uphold the
faith of Manager Eddie Dyer, who
gave him the assignment in order to
rest his weary hill stars. But Big
Red had a heart as big as a water
melon and it carried him out of re
peated jams through the cloudy,
chilly afternoon before the 33,045
fans.
The Red Sox had him in trouble
in almost every inning. But with
sparkling defensive play behind him
and those 20 Cardinal hits, there
was never a moment when the out
come was in doubt.
BOSTON, Oct. 10 (UP).—Ed
Barrow, who managed the Boston
Red Sox to their last world cham
pionship 28 years ago, said tonight
owner Tom Yawkey assured him
he never would trade Ted Will
iams.
"I told Yawkey to give the boy
bis head," Barrow said. "He'll
straighten out, I said, don't trade
him."
Yawkey smiled and replied "I
never will."

i BOSTON, Oct. 10 (UP).—lt was
i almost quiet enough to hear a bomb
drop in the Cardinal dressing room
today when tough Enos Slaughter,
the little guy with the big stick,
I dropped it.
"Whadda ya think," he whoop
ed above the roar of his happy
teammates, who had just pulver
ized l lit- Red Sox. 12 to 11. "I was
coming to the plate in that big
ninth inning and Umpire Charley
Berry says to me. 'Enos if you hit
i now you'll break a record for
| yourself and another for your
1 team.' So Clem Dreisewcnl. the
| Huston pitcher serves one in there
hig as a balloon, the best pitch 1
i had ail day long and I went after
i it.
"But I was trying too hard and I
] just popped up. If Berry hadn't told
;me that 1 probably would have
j whaled the ball out of the park."
Slaughter, the day's hitting hero,
wasn't too upset about it. For he
was the fellow, this underslung
: slugger from Koxboro, N.C., who
started the Cardinals off on their
[ 20-hit carnage with a tremendous
! second-inning home run.
