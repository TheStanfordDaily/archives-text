### 
Two thousand Stanford Indians
will leave Palo Alto today for a
"Tepee Reservation" in Westwood.
Some Redskins took to the warpath
last night, but the main exodus of
Indians will leave on the Rooters'
Special tonight.
Ucians are deep in plans for
their Roundup in Westwood. the
climax to their Homecoming Week,
which will begin with the crown
ing of a Homecoming Queen at II
a.m. today.
Wild, rootin' Indians and Bruins
will begin tonight's celebration at
8 in a parade of floats to be followed
by a bonfire and a rally in the Greek
amphitheater. Tickets for the rally
can be secured at the "Reservation"
before the parade.
A rally dance will follow the pro
gram at 10:.'i0 p.m. in the men's and
women's gyms.
Tomorrow the scene will shift
from the U.C.L.A. campus to the
Coliseum where a predicted crowd
of !>. r »,(MK) or more will see the
U.C.L.A. - Stanford tilt. Card
stunts will he used by the Stan
ford rooting section for the first
time in four years.
Dave Heyler, Stanford chairman
for the U.C.L.A. festivities, has re
quested the co-operation of all
students in putting over the stunts.

Hey, you Cards, save those
cards! With the paper shortage
and all, they're the only ones
Rally Com will he able to get this
season. And if they aren't brought
hack from Los Angeles—no more
card stunts this year. None for
U.S.C., and none for Cal. The
Stanford rooting section would
look pretty silly without card
stunts, with the Bears and Tro
jans going to town across the
field. So Rally Com begs you—
on its collective bended knee, to
SAVE THOSE CARDS.

Every rooter will be required to
wear either a white short or sweat
er, no red shirts allowed, according
to Heyler. Rally Com has request
| ed all male rooters to wear their
rooters' caps since they hope to form
a red block "S." Megaphones, song
books, and feathers for the women
are also requisites.
