# Poll Returns Show Vet Living Expenses Average Monthly Rent $45, Food $60
## 
### 
Although the number of ballots
turned in to the AVC-Dean of Stu
dents' housing poll fell far short of
expectations (only 110 ballots were
received), returns were enough to
get a general idea about the present
situation at Stanford for married
students.
Lack of returns is taken to indi
cate that the present situation here
is not critical.
Surprisingly enough, most of the
returns indicate that most couples
are paying an average of $45 a
month, and feel that in light of
present conditions this is not too
high.
They are spending about $60 a
month for food. One baby jumps
that figure to $75. Average living
accommodations are two rooms, ex
cluding bath.
The majority of married veter
ans are living otf campus, hut
within a radius of three miles of
Quad. Seventy-five per cent of
the couples own their own cars.
Almost 90 per cent of the wives
are assisting in the support of
family expenses.
Nearly all have baths, or bath
privileges. Seventy-five per cent
have laundry and kitchen privi

; leges. Twenty-five per cent have
! garage privileges. While only 2 per
! cent have more than one child, al-
J most 20 per cent have one depend
{ ent. Seventy-five per cent of those
couples polled have no dependents.
Most of the couples polled (90 per
| cent) are looking for better accom
modations. Subsistence pay for vet
erans helps in making most couples
self-supporting, if added to funds
j obtained by both student and wife
working. About 25 per cent are par
tially dependent upon their savings,
j and about 1 per cent are working
! for their housing as caretakers,
j watchmen, and doing odd jobs. Five
| per cent own their own homes, and
j another 5 per cent own house trail
ers.
Couples with trailers would like
! to see space allotted within the
Village premises, for most rental
space for trailers is approximately
five miles from campus and costs
from $14 to $20 per month.
"Results of the pilot study were

; most interesting," stated Dean Stal
| naker, "and I intend to conduct a
! more intensive survey along the
! same lines in the near future."
A general opinion is that students
would like to have better living
i quarters nearer to campus at ap
proximately the same rents. They
'consider the present rate almost
their ceiling. Couples would like to
be closer to campus, although less
than 5 per cent live farther away
than Redwood City or Mountain
View.—C.R.
