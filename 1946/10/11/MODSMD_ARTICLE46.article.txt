# Hidden Nazi Files Sent to War Libe
## 
### 
The Hoover Library has received
.1!) cases of the most comprehensive
material on Belgium in World War
II in the United States, Miss Nina
Almond, librarian, says.
The documents, including both
Nazi and anti - Nazi propaganda,
were ordered destroyed by the Ger
man propaganda office in Brussels
as the Allied forces approached. An
S.S. guard was stationed to see that
the building's Belgian janitor
burned them; however, while the
sentry sought cover during the fre
quent air raids, the janitor hid much
of the propaganda ministry's files.
Included in the materials are
newspapers, government documents,
and periodicals issued by the Nazis,
underground resistence movements,
and the Allies.
The Belgian-American Education
Foundation in Brussels is collecting
materials for the library in recogni
tion of Mr. Hoover's work in feed
ing the Belgians during World
War I.
