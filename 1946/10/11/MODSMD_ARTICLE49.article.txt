# Prehistoric Hot Rod Flames in Freak Fire
## 
### 
A small fire broke out yesterday
morning at the Physics corner when
Robert G. Hoyt started his 1929
Packard and watched flames burst
forth from beneath the car.
A backfire ignited a small amount
of oil and gas which had dripped
from the car. The fire department
quickly extinguished the blaze with
only minor damage to the Packard.
