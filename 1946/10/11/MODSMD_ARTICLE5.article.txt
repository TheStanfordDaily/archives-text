# No Farm 'Fraternity Problem' Due Partly To Eating Clubs' Freedom
## 
### JACK OGLESBY 
In 1.92,1 the Encina Commons was
completed and made possible the
creation of more eating clubs.
Up until then, the three clubs of
| "The Little Quad'' were the Coyotes,
El Toro, and El Campo. In case
that first one sounds unfamiliar, the
name of the club today is Breakers.
The four clubs to occupy space
in the Commons were Los Arcos,
El Capitan, El Cuadro, and El Tigre,
Since the latter got their food
from the general kitchen of Encina
Commons, they came to be known
ill time as the "dependents" where
as the others, operating separated
dining rooms and kitchens, were
called "independents."' Other than
that, both groups were "independ
| cnt," running their own affairs and
being their own bosses as much as
the fraternities. •
The eating clubs offered some
thing rather unique to the stu
dents. For those who wanted the
companionship of a fraternity-like
group but who wished to main
tain personal independence as
much as possible, the clubs were
the perfect answer.
Many an outsider, wondering at
the absence of a "fraternity prob
lem" at Stanford University, found
his answer when he was told of the
eating clubs.
The common story on many a
campus is one of complete domina
tion by fraternities and sororities.
There a student either became one
of the members or was left almost

entirely outside the campus life.
At Stanford the situation has al
ways been different. The student
government offices, as well as other
j activity offices, have passed back
| and forth between Row and Hall.
As Dr. Tresidder remarked rc-
I cently, Stanford has never been
faced with the fraternity problem.
An impressive number of alumni
! feel that the eating clubs have been
i the reason why.
It\is interesting to note that not
until the clubs had been closed
three years due to the war did the
ugly cry of "fraternity problem"
| echo on the Farm.
Just what do the eating clubs do?
i Well, as has been said before, they
are a sort of fraternity without be
ing a fraternity. Besides meeting
j for meals, taking care of a club
; room, and holding meetings, they
' have been active in intramural
j sports —as any pre-war Stanfordite
' will be able to tell you. Locked
! away in store rooms awaiting the
reopening of the clubs are enviable
collections of silver cups.
The clubs held dances, sponsored
events, and did their share to add
to the color and activities of the
i campus. Their membership list,
throughout the years is spotted
wilh names that have starred on
the sports pages, or appeared on im
portant office doors both in the bus
iness world and in Stanford's Ad
ministration Building.
Since their beginning in 1911, the
clubs have played their part in

I Stanford life. They have had their
; ups and downs but have always
| been a permanent part of the Farm
J scene.
But during the war. lliey had
their hardest blow. Uncle Sam
wanted to form his own eating
club and so the members took off
and the eating club doors were
locked. While they were gone,
the University condemned "The
Little Quad" and had the building
moved to the ROTC grounds.
The facilities fed 130 men, and
the returning veteran club members
I found that they were sort of "for
j gotten men."
Recently the groups, acting
j through Intcrclub Council, obtained
| use of a dining room in Encina Com
mons. With this as a new beginning,
the clubs arc reorganizing with the
; hope that sometime in the future
1 the Stanford eating clubs will hold
; their pre-war position.

As Dr. Tresidder remarked rc-

faced with the fraternity problem.
An impressive number of alumni
! feel that the eating clubs have been
i the reason why.
It\is interesting to note that not
until the clubs had been closed
three years due to the war did the
ugly cry of "fraternity problem"

Just what do the eating clubs do?
i Well, as has been said before, they
are a sort of fraternity without be
ing a fraternity. Besides meeting
j for meals, taking care of a club
; room, and holding meetings, they
' have been active in intramural
j sports —as any pre-war Stanfordite
' will be able to tell you. Locked
! away in store rooms awaiting the
reopening of the clubs are enviable
collections of silver cups.
The clubs held dances, sponsored
events, and did their share to add
to the color and activities of the

throughout the years is spotted
wilh names that have starred on
the sports pages, or appeared on im
portant office doors both in the bus
iness world and in Stanford's Ad

Since their beginning in 1911, the
clubs have played their part in

I Stanford life. They have had their
; ups and downs but have always

J scene.
But during the war. lliey had
their hardest blow. Uncle Sam
wanted to form his own eating
club and so the members took off
and the eating club doors were
locked. While they were gone,
the University condemned "The
Little Quad" and had the building
moved to the ROTC grounds.
The facilities fed 130 men, and
the returning veteran club members
I found that they were sort of "for
j gotten men."
Recently the groups, acting
j through Intcrclub Council, obtained
| use of a dining room in Encina Com
mons. With this as a new beginning,
the clubs arc reorganizing with the
; hope that sometime in the future

; their pre-war position.

In 1.92,1 the Encina Commons was
completed and made possible the
creation of more eating clubs.
Up until then, the three clubs of
| "The Little Quad'' were the Coyotes,
El Toro, and El Campo. In case
that first one sounds unfamiliar, the
name of the club today is Breakers.
The four clubs to occupy space
in the Commons were Los Arcos,
El Capitan, El Cuadro, and El Tigre,
Since the latter got their food
from the general kitchen of Encina
Commons, they came to be known
ill time as the "dependents" where
as the others, operating separated
dining rooms and kitchens, were
called "independents."' Other than
that, both groups were "independ
| cnt," running their own affairs and
being their own bosses as much as
the fraternities. •
The eating clubs offered some
thing rather unique to the stu
dents. For those who wanted the
companionship of a fraternity-like
group but who wished to main
tain personal independence as
much as possible, the clubs were
the perfect answer.
Many an outsider, wondering at
