# Health Clinic Issue Debated
## 
### 
Conflict between the Santa Clara
County Medical Society and the
Palo Alto Clinic over the health
service supplied to Stanford stu
dents under a contract with the
University was no nearer solution
today after a three-way meeting of
representatives Wednesday evening
failed to produce any definite agree
ment.
Dean of Students John M. Stal
nakcr, who represented the Uni
versity at the meeting, said yes
terday. "We are still hoping to
work out a solution suitable to all
groups concerned; the University
is particularly interested in main
taining the high standard of
health service offered to Stan
ford students."
The Wednesday evening meeting
grew out of a protest by Santa Clara
County Medical Society members
that the contract with Stanford gave
the Palo Alto Clinic a monopoly and
denied students free choice of doc
tors.
Dr. George Houek, head of the
Student Health Service and mem
ber of the clinic, was present at the
meeting along with Dean Stalnaker,
members of a delegation from the
county society, and clinic members.
