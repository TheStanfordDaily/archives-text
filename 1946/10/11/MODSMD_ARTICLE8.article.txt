Stanford's Y.W.C.A. membership
drive ends today with the freshman
halls leading in the campaign re
sults tabulated so far. Five corri
dors at Branncr and seven at Roble |
have gone 100 per cent in the drive.
Final announcements of the mem- j
bership will be given Monday. The i
drive is an annual campus event i
and provides the Farm's "Y" with
funds for three quarters.
The organization's second func
tion of the quarter will be a tea

sponsors and hall directors.
The Stanford "Y" integrates all j
women's activities on campus, ac- j
cording to President Ellie Brill. The j
drive is stressing active participa- j
tion in Y.W.C.A. affairs.
