# Meat Shortage Subject Of Truman Talk Tonight
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 13 (UP). -The nation's meat-hungry citizens to
night awaited President Truman's decision on whether he intends to lift
price controls on meat, or kep them and risk the ire of the voters in the
congressional elections next month.
Best indications were (.hat Mr. Truman will stand by his guns and not

call for decontrol of moat when he
rocs on the air at 10 p.m., EST. to
morrow for a 15-minute discussion
of the Administration's entire sta
bilization program.
If anvone in the capital knew
what decision the President had
reached on the politically explo
sive issue, he was not talking. Ad
ministration sources, who cus
tomarily give "oIT the record"
comment, said the issue was too
hot—they jnst couldn't talk about
it.
But there were several factors
which seemed to indicate that Mr.
Truman's solution will not be de
control. They were:
1. A hint from high Agriculture
Department sources that the recent
formal petition from the OPA beef
advisory committee asking removal
of meat from price control would be
denied. They said announcement of
the decision would be held up until
"higher levels" outline Administra
tion policy—an apparent reference
to the President's speech.
2. The fact that Mr. Truman
plans to speak ahout the whole
stabilization program. It was be
lieved that he was ready to de
fend meat controls as long as any
part of the program remains.
3. Finally, Mr. Truman's long
fight for the Administration's "hold
the line" policy against inflation, a
fight in which he sometimes has
gone up against high Democratic
party leaders and members of his
own cabinet.
