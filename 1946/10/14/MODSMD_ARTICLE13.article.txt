## 
### 
PARIS, Tuesday, Oct. 14 (UP).â€”
The new constitution for the Fourth
Republic was approved by the
French people in yesterday's nat
ional referendum by the unexpect
edly small margin of slightly more
than 1,000,000 votes ,the Ministry of
the Interior announced today.
Complete returns from all pre
cincts except those in Corsica and
three North African departments
gave: for the constitution, 9,002,467;
against, 7.790.676.
The margin was so small and so
many voters stayed away from the
polls that observers conceded Gen.

: Charles DeGaulle a moral victory in
his fight against, the draft drawn up
by the three major political parties.
Party leaders, who had hoped for
lan overwhelming majority, were
i .surprised at the large number of
! abstentions and blamed them on De
Gaulle's opposition to the constit'J
i lion, which he said would lead
{ France "fust to anarchy" and then
to dictatorship."
