50 of them through the Swiss Rc- i
lief agency, which will be discon
tinued tins year, and (he remain- i
ing beds through the funds re- j
ccived by WSSF.
COST $4

Under the facilities now available,

cured within two years arc taken
into any of the sanatoriums.
It was pointed out by Miss Leila

University of California, who also
traveled in Europe all summer, that
Polish students won't even come to
i the clinics.

We know we have it, uiey say,
"but there just might be the chance
that we don't. What's the use of
going and finding out for sure?"
According to Miss Roosenburg,
tuberculosis is the biggest problem
of the four problems that face Eu
ropean students. The other three
problems are food, clothing, and
housing.
Mr. John M. Stalnaker, Stan

lone.'
CALLS FOR ACTION

thy for others,'' he stated. Finally
we need to do some actual work
rather than just sit back and talk."
"Perhaps you students," he ad
dressed the Conference, "are the
most hopeful group to lead the way
to world co-operation.
