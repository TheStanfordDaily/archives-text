# Delegation Tours Area For U.N. Site
## 
### 
Indications that the Peninsula
may have the inside track if the
United Nations decides to make its
home in the San Francisco Bay area
grow last week as consideration of
Stanford as a possible site con
tinues.
A delegation of San Francisco
civic leaders made an inspection
tour of the area west of Redwood
City on Wednesday to add the Crys
tal Springs Lakes to Moraga Valley
and Stanford areas as potential lo
cales for the world capital.
STANFORD CONSIDERED
Consideration of Stanford for the
U.N. site may bog down over the
10 square miles now required for
the capital.
It is understood that University
trustees are willing to discuss leas
ing property to the United Nations
providing the land requirement is
not too great.
ROUGH COUNTRY UNSUITABLE
Stanford owns approximately 8,800
acres on the Peninsula, of which be
tween 1,500 and 2,000 arc in use for
University purposes. This would
leave only 6,800 acres not actually in
use, much of it in rough country
unsuitable for a world capital.
Unless the 10 square miles now
considered a requirement are re
duced, Stanford would be out of the
running for the U.N. site.
TRESIDDER ON COMMITTEE
President Donald B. Tresidder
and Trustee Leland Cutler arc

committee.
