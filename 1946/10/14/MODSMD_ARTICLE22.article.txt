## Saturday Afternoon 
### 
A lesson in perspective was brought home
Saturday afternoon to a handful of Stanford
students who dutifully attended the World
Student Service Fund Conference at the Edu
cation Auditorium.
They meandered about the campus in the
afternoon's early hours, hearing reports of the
UCLA game from radios in the Cellar, passing
cars, or from the open windows of houses on
the Row. They arrived at the Conference de
pressed at the first quarter's scoring, as
though seme long-standing illusion had been
stolen from them. And they settled into their
chairs to hear Henriette Roosenburg and Mary
Ann Nicholson tell them stones about stu
dents abroad which they'd heard in essence
many times before.
None were prepared to realize that in fol
lowing their more and less important school
activities, they were oblivious of students ov
erseas whose lives depended on their actions.
Mary Ann Nicholson, recently returned
from a tour of European colleges and student
conferences, fired at delegates the same ques
tions she had been asked to answer. "What
do American students do in their spare time?
What are American students thinking about?
(The important things—like education, and

new wars?) Do they think about us? Do they
want to help us?"
Miss Roosenburg told of medical students
in Europe studying without books and with
out microscopes, of the 1,000-mile pilgrimage
of students in China who sought a place to sit
down and study. Mary Ann said students
abroad had learned that time was health
their only wealth.
So the question was posed, how are we
universities represented here going to exhort
the maximum of money from all students for
the cause of our foreign fellows? How are we
going to show each student body that through
our gifts this year we have but one more
chance to extend hope and faith to foreign
students, who are on the brink of having
neither?
The Conference adjourned at 9 p.m.—the
Conference that was to plan drives on each
campus to raise funds. Stanford students
learned then, or earlier, that Stanford had lost
its football game with UCLA. And they were
sorry for the sake of the team, the Rose Bowl,
the hopes they had. But they knew that some
thing infinitely more important remained to
replace their disappointment—a duty to give,
and make others give, for the cause of brother
hood, and education and world student relief.

hood, and education and world student relief.
A lesson in perspective was brought home
Saturday afternoon to a handful of Stanford
students who dutifully attended the World
Student Service Fund Conference at the Edu
cation Auditorium.
They meandered about the campus in the
afternoon's early hours, hearing reports of the
UCLA game from radios in the Cellar, passing
cars, or from the open windows of houses on
the Row. They arrived at the Conference de
pressed at the first quarter's scoring, as
though seme long-standing illusion had been
stolen from them. And they settled into their
chairs to hear Henriette Roosenburg and Mary
Ann Nicholson tell them stones about stu
dents abroad which they'd heard in essence
many times before.
None were prepared to realize that in fol
lowing their more and less important school
activities, they were oblivious of students ov
erseas whose lives depended on their actions.
Mary Ann Nicholson, recently returned
from a tour of European colleges and student
conferences, fired at delegates the same ques
tions she had been asked to answer. "What
do American students do in their spare time?
What are American students thinking about?
(The important things—like education, and

new wars?) Do they think about us? Do they
want to help us?"
Miss Roosenburg told of medical students
in Europe studying without books and with
out microscopes, of the 1,000-mile pilgrimage
of students in China who sought a place to sit
down and study. Mary Ann said students
abroad had learned that time was health
their only wealth.
So the question was posed, how are we
universities represented here going to exhort
the maximum of money from all students for
the cause of our foreign fellows? How are we
going to show each student body that through
our gifts this year we have but one more
chance to extend hope and faith to foreign
students, who are on the brink of having
neither?
The Conference adjourned at 9 p.m.—the
Conference that was to plan drives on each
campus to raise funds. Stanford students
learned then, or earlier, that Stanford had lost
its football game with UCLA. And they were
sorry for the sake of the team, the Rose Bowl,
the hopes they had. But they knew that some
thing infinitely more important remained to
replace their disappointment—a duty to give,
and make others give, for the cause of brother
hood, and education and world student relief.
