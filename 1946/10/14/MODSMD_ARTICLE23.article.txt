# BILL COUGHLIN
## BULL SESSION 
### 
Oi.e of the Row roughs has a problem. A rather
delicate and personal dilemma. When he and his
current shy young frosh go automobiling in the eve
ning, they just can't seem to find a quiet spot where
they can stop and chat a while.
It's a sad case of interruptions, always interrup
tions. They no sooner get a good conversation going
than someone happens along and bothers them.
, He 112 nally decided the other evening that the
situation definitely had to be taken in hand, so the
two of them started out to find a lonesome deserted
.spot whether they could be alone together.
They took to the hills and headed for Skyline.
They found a nice quiet unoccupied spot way up
there an I pulled off into a ravine and began their
conversation. The busy world and all its people
seemed millions of miles away.
Then, out of the darkness, another car pulled
lip beside them. A little man got out of the car and
began carrying large boxes and wires to a nearby
knoll.
Then he started:
"Hello, hello, this is amateur mobile radio station
WXt;*:i2 calling CQ, calling CQ. This is station
WX(;Y:i2 calling CQ. Calling CQ, calling CQ , . ."
So our couple, deciding they would get no peace
Iht re, came home in a bitter, hitler mood.
Some people jus! don't live right.

You think you have trouble saving money here?

Ha! Down at Ucla, it costs 50 cents a lecture for
the classes in their marriage course. That must be
some course. I don't pay by the lecture here and 1
still have a horrible time talking myself into going
to class.
It sounds like an interesting course, though. One
sex lecture scheduled is on "recreational dating vs.
serious courtship." That recreational dating sounds
like quite a deal. But that's Ucla for you. Up here
it would mean a coke at the Cellar.

This business of married vets living here at
school while their wives stay home due to the
housing shortage is leading to complications.
A long on the Row had an exchange dinner the
other night with one of the ex-sorority clubs. One
of the girls was making with the light patter and
racy sayings to one of the tong's more virile roughs
in whom she appeared interested.
"My name is Martha," she bubbled.
"That's a nice name," our boy replied; "maybe
it would do for my new baby."
The conversation reached an abrupt end.

The other day a bespectacled student slalked info
the Bookstore, leered over the counter at the sales
girl, and asked, "Have you got (lie equipment for
Anatomy 120?"
She had.

This business of married vets living here at
school while their wives stay home due to the
housing shortage is leading to complications.
A long on the Row had an exchange dinner the
other night with one of the ex-sorority clubs. One
of the girls was making with the light patter and
racy sayings to one of the tong's more virile roughs
in whom she appeared interested.
"My name is Martha," she bubbled.
"That's a nice name," our boy replied; "maybe
it would do for my new baby."
The conversation reached an abrupt end.

The other day a bespectacled student slalked info
the Bookstore, leered over the counter at the sales
girl, and asked, "Have you got (lie equipment for
Anatomy 120?"
She had.
Oi.e of the Row roughs has a problem. A rather
delicate and personal dilemma. When he and his
current shy young frosh go automobiling in the eve
ning, they just can't seem to find a quiet spot where
they can stop and chat a while.
It's a sad case of interruptions, always interrup
tions. They no sooner get a good conversation going
than someone happens along and bothers them.
, He 112 nally decided the other evening that the
situation definitely had to be taken in hand, so the
two of them started out to find a lonesome deserted
.spot whether they could be alone together.
They took to the hills and headed for Skyline.
They found a nice quiet unoccupied spot way up
there an I pulled off into a ravine and began their
conversation. The busy world and all its people
seemed millions of miles away.
Then, out of the darkness, another car pulled
lip beside them. A little man got out of the car and
began carrying large boxes and wires to a nearby
knoll.
Then he started:
"Hello, hello, this is amateur mobile radio station
WXt;*:i2 calling CQ, calling CQ. This is station
WX(;Y:i2 calling CQ. Calling CQ, calling CQ , . ."
So our couple, deciding they would get no peace
Iht re, came home in a bitter, hitler mood.
Some people jus! don't live right.

You think you have trouble saving money here?

Ha! Down at Ucla, it costs 50 cents a lecture for
the classes in their marriage course. That must be
some course. I don't pay by the lecture here and 1
still have a horrible time talking myself into going
to class.
It sounds like an interesting course, though. One
sex lecture scheduled is on "recreational dating vs.
serious courtship." That recreational dating sounds
like quite a deal. But that's Ucla for you. Up here
it would mean a coke at the Cellar.
