## HISTORY 1946 
### 
For an honest, conscientious man, President Tru
man does get into the darnedest situations. There
was the Wallace situation. Now there's the meat
situation. The key to his difficulties seems to be his
very honesty. He finds, as Mr. Roosevelt seldom did,
that there are some difficulties in reconciling his po
sition as head of the state with his position as head
ot the Democratic party.
In the Wallace situation, the former Secretary of
Commerce was allowed to make a pro-Russian
speech in the hope of appeasing not Russia, but the
lei I -wing, New York bloc' of Democrats. This was
lor political reasons. Then President Truman, as
head ol the state and a public servant, was forced
to publicly disagree with Wallace, which left things
in a far worse mess than they were in the first place,
from both points of view.
In the present meat shortage, the Democratic
politieos have asked that controls be lifted in the
hope that the voters, with a rib roast in every oven,
will remember "Roosevelt and Humanity" on the
first .Tuesday after the first Monday in November.
Again, the President's position as spokesman for the
country as a whole has so far kept him silent on the
matter. Whatever he does, large numbers of people
will not be pleased, and the longer he delays his
decision, the more bitter will the controversy be
come.
I he only advice that I feel qualified to give is this:
since Mr. Truman does not have the consummate
political acumen ol his predecessor, he should make
up his mind either to be a politician or a public serv
ant. Any man who tries to ride two horses at the
same time is likely to have a serious fall.

It appears that the coming week will be an event
ful one. Not only is President Truman's decision on
the meal situation expected todajy, but the Paris Con
ference will wind up, if things go according to plan,
October 15. Moreover, their appeals having been
denied by the Control Council, the men of Nuern
berg will make a token payment for their sins on
the gallows this week.
The Paris Conference is an advisory body; its
conclusions must be approved by the Big Four for
eign ministers. But, so far, its decisions iiave been
for the principles advocated by the United States.
Provisions for an autonomous Trieste have been ap
proved, and, in principle, free navigation of the Dan
ube has been accepted. Although the Soviet Union
and its friends have voted solidly against these meas
ures, they have accepted the restraints necessary to
expedite the work of the Conference. This is no
j uarantee that the whole battle will not have to
b re-fought between the foreign ministers, but any

co-operation, oven in little things, is gratifying in
these wary days.

From what I read in the Daily, the reasoning be
hind the local AVC's decision to support the move
for increased subsistence payments under the G.I.
Bill amounts to this: (he veteran should get his as
long as everyone else is getting theirs. Wilhout re
gard to the effect of the proposition on the national
economy, the attitude does not seem to me exactly
consistent with the AVC's famous motto "Citizens
first, veterans second." But certainly they are no
worse than any other veterans' organization.
There is one deal now before the public which, to
my mind, is as discreditable to the veteran as any
vets' organizations have ever been. This is an initia
tive proposition, Proposition No. 2, which will be on
the ballot Nov. 5. It would legalize dog racing and
betting on dog races. In return for 4 per cent of the
take for an old soldiers' home, the Veterans of For
eign Wars and the Disabled American Veterans have
given the proposition their official endorsements.
There are overwhelming moral, social, and eco
nomic arguments against legalized gambling. There
fore the promoters behind this project are putting it
before the public as a measure to help the veteran!
The joker in the deal is this: a few veterans might
benefit from increased support for an old soldiers'
home (although the state already has one), but a far
greater number of veterans would be deprived of
their own homes. There have already been an
nouncements of the magnificent dog tracks that will
be built, with every facility for the dogs and the
gambling public. But they will be built of lumber
and plaster, cement and steel; they will use wire and
fixtures, pipe, and mill-work. Today's veteran wants,
not housing for dogs and gamblers, not a refuge for
his old age, but a roof over his and the family's head.
One way to improve his situation is to prevent di
version of scarce housing materials wherever pos
sible, but here we have the sorry spectacle of two
of the largest veterans' groups endorsing a plan to
build not houses but dog tracks!
And just to make this round-up complete, there
are now Washington rumors circulating that the
vicious attack of the American Legion on Gen.
Omar Bradley will result in his removal in favor
of Harry Vaughan. Mr. Truman's military aide, one
of the boys from Missouri, who was just promoted to
brigadier general. I know of no man who has done
more for the veteran than Gen. Bradley, no one in
whom veterans have more confidence. And (he Le
gion's immediate grievance is that Bradley objected
to paying subsistence to anyone making more than
$200 a month!
