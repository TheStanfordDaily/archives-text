### BILL HORNBY 
October, 18! M, and 21.0 boys were
quartered in Encina together with
many of the professors. For $20 a
month they were living in one of
the most modern dormitories in
America.
The electric lighting system was
installed by November and gave un
certain service between 5 and 10:ti0
p.m. The plumbing gave out with
a rusty brown water, but every
room had a Bible and a big, red
wool L.S.J.U. blanket. Candles
were dished out by the Administra
tion to those who grew tired of
gambling on the lighting system. *
In the dining hall cold soup,
tough meat, and a continued pref
erence by the Chinese cooks for
prunes soon drove many resi
dents out of Encina toward May
field, Mcnlo Park, Palo Alto, or
the"Camp."
The latter was a group of cheap,
white, one-story frame buildings
originally built to house the work
men building the Quad. Standing
back of the Quad, just west of what
is now the Row, it soon became the
counterpart of the modern Cellar.
It was the only place where visitors
could get a meal, and soon many
of the student body joined them at
the clang of the large triangle which
served as dinner bell.
The small group of coeds were
faring better down in the original
Roblc Ilall, now Sequoia. The
parlor was done in pink and blue,
there were white blankets with
blue borders on the beds, and the
University provided Castile soap
and close supervision.
Waiting upon the completion of
their dining hall, the girls ate in a
group at Encina, marching down
two by two and avoiding the
stares of the hungry men who were
forced to wait until "the hens were
fed."
The ice was somewhat broken at
the first on-campus event, a "social"
given at Roble under candlelight,
the girls in "plain" ginghams and

calicos by special request of Jane
Stanford. Later Encina tried to re
ciprocate by giving a dance, but the
girls did not l'eel that the period
of coeducation had advanced far
enough to make dancing "proper."
Things went along pretty slow
socially, with nothing as exciting
as faculty and student grape
stealing expeditions to the Sena
tor's vineyard.
Later the Phi Psi's gave an ofT
campus affair in San Jose, but mixed
dancing at Roblo and Encina was
forbidden by the founders to nip
the alarming trend toward a non
serious younger generation.
In early 1892 the Phi Delts were
successful in getting the first fra
ternity house on campus, though
several chapters were previously
chartered sans dwelling. Lauro Hall,
now Madrono, had been built to
house bachelor faculty.
The latter not having the funds
to operate the hall, the Phi Delts
took over with faculty members tol
erated as "boarders." Soon other
fraternities obtained houses and
mixed dancing made the grade.
Isy late spring of the first year,
the mandolin club was well organ
ized, Japanese had replaced stu
dents as Encina janitors, and fac
ulty "at homes" on Alvarado Row
made that ten-building row of
professors' homes a social center.
Horse and buggy picnickers had

found their way to La Honda and
Ml. Hamilton, and the ladies of Ro
ble would pick their way across the
Holds by lantern at night to visit
the Jordans in Esconclite Cottage,
between modern Branner and Col
lege Terrace. There they would
hear the most romantic of early
Stanford legends, the saga of the
"Frenchman."
