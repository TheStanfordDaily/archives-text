## SLING TIME 
### 
Well, it's all over now; there'll be no Rose Bowl trip. But that one
should be easy to philosophize about—the Bruins are a great team,*and
Stanford has only a GOOD team. I've been doing a lot of thinking about
those boys, alone here in the office, with no women editors to bother me.
(Oh, hello, Mabel, come on in. What've you got, limeade? Yeah, pour
me a glass.)
What the Cardinal boys did in that game is worth talking about.
They were completely outclassed in that first half by a team that may
he one of the greatest of all time; hut the hoys came hack and fought out
the second half ON EVEN TERMS. That doesn't happen very often.
Usually a team that's 2(1 points in the rear at half-time will lose by half
a hundred points. Itut football squads that don't quit under any circum
stances seem to be a Stanford tradition.
Even though young Marehie Schwartz's team lost by 20 points, he
turned in one of the best coaching jobs of the year. How he ever got a
completely beaten team to come back and make a game of it is a minor
miracle. Alter the Idaho game, he knew he had a team; after U.S.F., he
knew it was a good team. Now he knows it isn't a great team, but it
certainly has some of the elements of greatness.
A lighting spirit is something you can't buy; either it's there, or it
isn't. Now all Stanford knows that their squad has it—and they can be
proud. There may be a couple of weaknesses—passing and signal calling,
perhaps—but there is still time to rectify that. The Cards have the stuff,
barring bad breaks, to go the rest of the way without another loss.
(Okay, Mabel, fill it up again. Gee, that's good limeade.)

Ernie Case was the difference that defeated Stanford. The Bruins have
every conceivable type of offensive weapon, but Ernie is the guy who
knows Aactly what tools he has at hand, and how to use them. If you'll
excuse a parody on a very old poem:
CASE, E., TO THE FLAT
Ernie Case, the Mighty Case, E.,
Led the Bruins with his play;
Stanford came, and rooters knew
That only he could save the day.
All expected a great struggle,
And people had gathered from afar;
The Bruins were tough, and that's no bull,
But Mighty Ernie was the star.
Oh, there was no joy at Stanford,
They didn't sing or shout;
Westwood's glee was boundless,
For Mighty Case, E., had won out.
Or:
ODE TO ERNIE
Ernie Case, we hate you up here—
Our Big Red Machine you threw out of gear;
Our plans would have run off without a hitch
Except for you, and that southpaw pitch.
I was going to make those last two lines "Our plans would have run off
without a hitch, except for you, you unfriendly fellow," but the editor
wouldn't like it.
Take it from one who played in the same backfield with Case in the '41
Spring practice at Westwood, you couldn't find a nicer guy—in or out of a
football suit. The only trouble is. he doesn't know he's too old to play
football. I wish someone had told him before he played us. ( Don't tickle
my ears, Mabel, you're distracting me.)

After Cal took that one-point beating from Oregon, a week ago, the
paper up there came out with "Cal Wins Statistical Victory." This week
they lucked out over Wedemeyer and Co. (on two pass interceptions).
I'm breathlessly awaiting today's issue of the Cal rag; if they follow
through, the head should read, "Gaels Defeat Bears Statistically." Anyone
llial thinks it will happen is more optimistic than I.

Saturday the Army was again shown that it should install a public
speaking course at West Point. After the game Bill Stern asked one of
his spotters, an Army major, what he thought of the struggle. Foot in
mouth, the man with the oak leaves stammered, "Sportsmanship on both
sides left nothing, uh, to be admired!" (Not now. Mabel, I'm busy. Go
gel the ice cubes yourself.)

completely beaten team to come back and make a game of it is a minor
miracle. Alter the Idaho game, he knew he had a team; after U.S.F., he
knew it was a good team. Now he knows it isn't a great team, but it
certainly has some of the elements of greatness.
A lighting spirit is something you can't buy; either it's there, or it
isn't. Now all Stanford knows that their squad has it—and they can be
proud. There may be a couple of weaknesses—passing and signal calling,
perhaps—but there is still time to rectify that. The Cards have the stuff,
barring bad breaks, to go the rest of the way without another loss.

Ernie Case was the difference that defeated Stanford. The Bruins have
every conceivable type of offensive weapon, but Ernie is the guy who
knows Aactly what tools he has at hand, and how to use them. If you'll
excuse a parody on a very old poem:
CASE, E., TO THE FLAT
Ernie Case, the Mighty Case, E.,
Led the Bruins with his play;
Stanford came, and rooters knew
That only he could save the day.
All expected a great struggle,
And people had gathered from afar;
The Bruins were tough, and that's no bull,
But Mighty Ernie was the star.
Oh, there was no joy at Stanford,
They didn't sing or shout;
Westwood's glee was boundless,
For Mighty Case, E., had won out.
Or:
ODE TO ERNIE
Ernie Case, we hate you up here—
Our Big Red Machine you threw out of gear;
Our plans would have run off without a hitch
Except for you, and that southpaw pitch.
I was going to make those last two lines "Our plans would have run off
without a hitch, except for you, you unfriendly fellow," but the editor
wouldn't like it.
Take it from one who played in the same backfield with Case in the '41
Spring practice at Westwood, you couldn't find a nicer guy—in or out of a
football suit. The only trouble is. he doesn't know he's too old to play
football. I wish someone had told him before he played us. ( Don't tickle
my ears, Mabel, you're distracting me.)

After Cal took that one-point beating from Oregon, a week ago, the
paper up there came out with "Cal Wins Statistical Victory." This week
they lucked out over Wedemeyer and Co. (on two pass interceptions).
I'm breathlessly awaiting today's issue of the Cal rag; if they follow
through, the head should read, "Gaels Defeat Bears Statistically." Anyone
llial thinks it will happen is more optimistic than I.

Saturday the Army was again shown that it should install a public
speaking course at West Point. After the game Bill Stern asked one of
his spotters, an Army major, what he thought of the struggle. Foot in
mouth, the man with the oak leaves stammered, "Sportsmanship on both
sides left nothing, uh, to be admired!" (Not now. Mabel, I'm busy. Go

You remember I said at the start of this column that I was all alone.
Well, an old friend dropped in to see me after I got started. His name is
Mablc, George Mabel.
Well, it's all over now; there'll be no Rose Bowl trip. But that one
should be easy to philosophize about—the Bruins are a great team,*and
Stanford has only a GOOD team. I've been doing a lot of thinking about
those boys, alone here in the office, with no women editors to bother me.
(Oh, hello, Mabel, come on in. What've you got, limeade? Yeah, pour
me a glass.)
What the Cardinal boys did in that game is worth talking about.
They were completely outclassed in that first half by a team that may
he one of the greatest of all time; hut the hoys came hack and fought out
the second half ON EVEN TERMS. That doesn't happen very often.
Usually a team that's 2(1 points in the rear at half-time will lose by half
a hundred points. Itut football squads that don't quit under any circum
stances seem to be a Stanford tradition.

CASE, E., TO THE FLAT
Ernie Case, the Mighty Case, E.,
Led the Bruins with his play;
Stanford came, and rooters knew
That only he could save the day.
All expected a great struggle,
And people had gathered from afar;
The Bruins were tough, and that's no bull,
But Mighty Ernie was the star.
Oh, there was no joy at Stanford,
They didn't sing or shout;
Westwood's glee was boundless,
For Mighty Case, E., had won out.
Or:
ODE TO ERNIE
Ernie Case, we hate you up here—
Our Big Red Machine you threw out of gear;
Our plans would have run off without a hitch
Except for you, and that southpaw pitch.
I was going to make those last two lines "Our plans would have run off
without a hitch, except for you, you unfriendly fellow," but the editor
wouldn't like it.
Take it from one who played in the same backfield with Case in the '41
Spring practice at Westwood, you couldn't find a nicer guy—in or out of a
football suit. The only trouble is. he doesn't know he's too old to play
football. I wish someone had told him before he played us. ( Don't tickle
my ears, Mabel, you're distracting me.)

After Cal took that one-point beating from Oregon, a week ago, the
paper up there came out with "Cal Wins Statistical Victory." This week
they lucked out over Wedemeyer and Co. (on two pass interceptions).
I'm breathlessly awaiting today's issue of the Cal rag; if they follow
through, the head should read, "Gaels Defeat Bears Statistically." Anyone
llial thinks it will happen is more optimistic than I.

Saturday the Army was again shown that it should install a public
speaking course at West Point. After the game Bill Stern asked one of
his spotters, an Army major, what he thought of the struggle. Foot in
mouth, the man with the oak leaves stammered, "Sportsmanship on both
sides left nothing, uh, to be admired!" (Not now. Mabel, I'm busy. Go
gel the ice cubes yourself.)

You remember I said at the start of this column that I was all alone.
Well, an old friend dropped in to see me after I got started. His name is
Mablc, George Mabel.
Well, it's all over now; there'll be no Rose Bowl trip. But that one
should be easy to philosophize about—the Bruins are a great team,*and
Stanford has only a GOOD team. I've been doing a lot of thinking about
those boys, alone here in the office, with no women editors to bother me.
(Oh, hello, Mabel, come on in. What've you got, limeade? Yeah, pour
me a glass.)
What the Cardinal boys did in that game is worth talking about.
They were completely outclassed in that first half by a team that may
he one of the greatest of all time; hut the hoys came hack and fought out
the second half ON EVEN TERMS. That doesn't happen very often.
Usually a team that's 2(1 points in the rear at half-time will lose by half
a hundred points. Itut football squads that don't quit under any circum
stances seem to be a Stanford tradition.
Even though young Marehie Schwartz's team lost by 20 points, he
turned in one of the best coaching jobs of the year. How he ever got a
completely beaten team to come back and make a game of it is a minor
miracle. Alter the Idaho game, he knew he had a team; after U.S.F., he
knew it was a good team. Now he knows it isn't a great team, but it
certainly has some of the elements of greatness.
A lighting spirit is something you can't buy; either it's there, or it
isn't. Now all Stanford knows that their squad has it—and they can be
proud. There may be a couple of weaknesses—passing and signal calling,
perhaps—but there is still time to rectify that. The Cards have the stuff,
barring bad breaks, to go the rest of the way without another loss.
(Okay, Mabel, fill it up again. Gee, that's good limeade.)

Ernie Case was the difference that defeated Stanford. The Bruins have
every conceivable type of offensive weapon, but Ernie is the guy who
knows Aactly what tools he has at hand, and how to use them. If you'll
