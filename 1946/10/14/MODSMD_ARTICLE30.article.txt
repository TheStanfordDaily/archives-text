# Redbirds Tie Series
## 
### 
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 13 (UP).—Pitch
ing courageously in the clutch.
Harry (The Cat) Brecheen squared
the St. Louis Cardinals with the
Boston Red Sox at three games all
in the World Series today when
once again he stilled the robust Bo
sox bats to win the sixth contest
4 to 1.
Brecheen, a slim, lithe left-han
der with a roundhouse curve and
plenty of heart, pitched his way
out of several holes as he blew
down the Red Sox with a sterling
seven-hitter and for the second
time brought his team even with
the favored American League
champions.
It was an early birthday present
to himself for the thin-faced tosser
from Broken Bow, Okla., who will
be 31 tomorrow, and it sent the
baseball classic the full seven-game
distance. It was the third time the
Cards had roared back to square
the series—and the second time
Brecheen accomplished the feat.
Taking advantage of the early
lead which his teammates had
given him, Brecheen coasted to
victory after early difficulties.
But it looked had for a time. Be
cause with one out in the first inn
ing. the confident Red Sox loaded
the bases on him and the home
folks feared the series was over.
Then there was York, the guy
with the biggest bat of them all
in this series. But Brecheen fed
him a double-play ball and step
ped rather shakily out of the jam.
With tomorrow being held open
for ticket sales —series tickets be
ing sold only in blocks of threes for
each home park—Dyer and Mana
ger Joe Cronin of the Red Sox an
nounced definitely that their start
ers would be Murray Dickson and
Dave (Boo) Ferriss in the seventh
game at Sportsman's Park Tuesday.
