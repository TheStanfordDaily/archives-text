# Bowling League Opens in Village
## 
### 
Tonight at 6:30 marks the open
ing of the Village bowling leagues
at the Village alleys. Eight teams
will compete in tonight's opener for
averages, and eight more will try
their skill tomorrow night.
Mr. Cunningham, operator of the
alleys, has announced that lie will
hold Monday and Tuesday nights
each week for leagues and if neces
sary, will extend this policy to other
evenings. Saturdays and Sundays,
however, will be held for open
bowling.
Each house has been urged to en
| ter a team, and there has been a
; good response, considering that the
, place has been open less than a
week.
