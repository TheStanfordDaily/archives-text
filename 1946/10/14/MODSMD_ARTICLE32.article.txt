# Intramural Point System Released by Warmerdam
## 
### 
As signups for fall quarter's intramural football program
slowly got under way last week, the director of Intramural Sports,
Cornelius Warmerdam, released the murals' point system, which
is used in determining the University Champion each year. The
living group team that garners the greatest number of points in

' the various sports of that year wins
the Intramural All-Year Champion
ship Trophy.
Classification of the activities into
three groups is the basis for the
point system. Touch football, bas
ketball, baseball, softball, and vol
leyball comprise the sports in Group
I. Teams entering in competition in
these sports are assigned to leagues
composed of from four to six teams
for a season of round-robin play.

All managers of intramural foot
ball teams will meet at 4 p.m. to
day in room 41 of the S.A.C. OlTi
cials will meet at 4:15 in room 17.

| Competition in an elimination tour
! nament for the University cham
pionship is the assignment for the
[ various league winners.
The entering teams in Group ll—
j horseshoes, tennis, handball, and
golf—are drawn into a bracket-form
! elimination tournament, in which
there will be consolation play
awarded to the two losers of the
semi-final round. A forfeiture of a
round of competition due to the
non-appearance of a team will re
sult in a loss of all points in the
sport for that team.
Group 111 is composed of track,
swimming, and relays, where all the
teams are pitted against each other
in one meet.
