# Indian Boxing Coach Returns
## 
### 
Stanford is blessed by more than j
just students from the returning
veteran ranks. Clayton Frye, for
five years the Farm's head boxing
coach, has once again taken up his j
duties as big chief of Stanford's ring i
gladiators.
Frye has been in tlie Navy dur- i
ing his three-year absence from
the Campus. Now he is hack to
prepare the boxing squad for its
first real season since he left.
The best Stanford did in the ring
during the war period whs an intra- !
mural tournament under the direc
tion of Vic Lindskog, former Stan- |
ford All-American and outstanding j
amateur boxer. Now Frye is work
ing with many of the men from that |
tourney, in addition to some good
returning boxers that came back |
this quarter.
Noteworthy among them is Frank
Hewitt, former Pacific Coast Inter- |
collegiate Tournament Finalist in
the welterweight class. Hewitt, if
he manages to tear himself away
from his Chappie duties long enough
to get in shape, should help make '
Stanford as strong in this depart- !
ment as any team on the coast. For |
backing him up is Bub Hudson, let
terman transfer from U.C.LA.
Other outstanding hopes are
Yank Levin and Sam Streetcr,
winners in their divisions in the
infra-mural championship last
year.
As it always has been, Stanford's
boxing season will be limited to
four matches, two each with Cal
and U.C.L.A. However, a few prac
tice sessions with local independent
schools may be placed on the
agenda.
