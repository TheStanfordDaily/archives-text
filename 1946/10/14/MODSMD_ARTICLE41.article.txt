# China Peace Hopes Weaken

### 
NANKING. China, Oct. 13 (UP).
Nanking peace negotiations ap
parently have gone up in the smoke
over Kalgan, where fires still burned
today, almost three days after its
capture by government troops.
United States Ambassador John
Leighton Stuart and Presidential
Envoy Gen. George C. Marshall
talked with Generalissimo Chiang
Kai-shek in an eleventh-hour effort
to patch up the government-Com
munist rupture, but observers con
ceded them little chance for suc
cess.
The Chinese capital was tensely
awaiting word from Shanghai,
where Gen. Chou En-lai, No. 1
Communist negotiator, was drafting
a message to Marshall.
In Nanking, a Communist spokes
man hinted the Communist dele
gation soon would return to Yenan.
He interpreted the government's
capture of Kalgan, in the face of
Communist warnings that it would
"divide China in two states," as a
"complete break'" in negotiations.
"If there's nothing for us to do in
Nanking, naturally we'll return to
Yenan," the spokesman said.
In Kalgan, the Communists' "mod
el city" of North China, it also ap
peared little could be salvaged.
Gen. Chen Cheng, commander of
China's armed forces, reported after
aerial reconnaissance that fires were
gutting all modern buildings, mu
nicipal offices and a railway station.
Kalgan's two tirfields were damaged
almost beyond repair.
Meanwhile, government troops
dispersing Communist remnants
along the Peiping-Suiyuan railway
captured Hsiahwayuan, 30 miles
southeast of Kalgan, the Chinese
Central News Agency reported.
