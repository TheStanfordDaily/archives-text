# It Was a Sad, Sad Weekend On the Farm
## 
### BETTYLU SULLIVAN 
When several thousand Stanford
I students pick up their goods and
chattels and take off for a weekend
in the south, the atmosphere around
(he campus is about as lively as a
tomb. The handful of students left
all but shouted to break the silence
as they rushed around trying to
look like a crowd.
Saturday afternoon the streets
were really looking like Pompeii as
everyone hung aiound the nearest
radio to hear the game. In the Cel
lar the radio was going full blast
and in the residences at least one
I radio was going and at least one
! claque of rooters was spurring the
j team on via short wave.
After the game an even greater
lethargy fell over the campus. Eve
ning found most in a gay whirl of
studying, some drowned their sor
rows in a show, or more potent stuff,
| and one enterprising young woman
I chaperoned a high-school dance,
j The rest of the time was taken up
j in post mortems and professional
; opinions about just what we should
i have done, what we did do, and
why.
All in all it's been a deadly weck-
J end. Please don't leave us to rattle
around here again.
