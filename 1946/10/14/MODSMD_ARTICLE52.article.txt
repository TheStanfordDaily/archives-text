## 
### 
If everyone in Roble didn't know
; before that five of their hashers Hew
i in a chartered plane to the U.C.L.A.
fracas, they did yesterday at high
I noon when the cardinal two-mo-
I tored job Hashed down out of the
I blue, shattering their sleepy Sun
; day.
j Amid cries of ''There they are,"
| nnd much waving of arms, the wait
ing group of stay-at-home hashers
piled into ears and raced out to the
Paly airport to greet the airborne
; rooters.
JIGGS PILOT
Pilot Jiggs McCaulley left his four
passengers. M;irty Tuller, Tom May,
Barbara Stofer, and Jim Miller,
with the reception committee at the
airport and returned the converted
Cessna Bobcat to Oakland, where
: Miller later picked him up in his
j car.
I "We climbed out of our red plane,
1 with earphones over our red and
' white rooters' caps, and megaphones
in hand," laughed McCaulley. The
| trip down was smooth and only took
two hours, which was just as well
because the girls had never been
i up before, the pilot said.
SMOOTH FLYING
The quintet reported perfect
weather and smooth flying for the
| return trip, which took one hour
and 50 minutes from Glendale to
I Palo Alto. The general comment
from the group was that it was the
j perfect w;iy to make the trip, cost
ing them only $25 apiece.
For an idea on how the flight cuts

down 011 traveling time, McCaulley
made the hop from Oakland to Paly
in nine minutes Saturday morning.
"All in all, we had a real fine trip,"
he commented.
