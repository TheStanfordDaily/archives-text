# Farm Cheers When Team Comes Home
## 
### JEAN BURNET BETH MacVICAR 
"Come Join the Band" and the ,
cheers of some 300 Stanford root- |
crs last night welcomed back to the !
Farm a football squad that had on J
Saturday gone down fighting to a
superior U.C.L.A. team. Quiet and
surprised, the team swung down off
the Daylight into a crowd that
wanted to demonstrate its allegiance
to the men who had tried to win
even when the score stood 20-0.
Two trains came and went before
the Daylight, 50 minutes late, pulled
in to the Southern Pacific station.
And as the impromptu rally ended, i
the crowd still wasn't positive if the '
team had heard their cheers. The 1
Indians had come and quietly gone.
With shouts of "Here it comes!"
all necks craned to catch sight of
the Daylight as it thundered
around the corner. The hand
struck ii |> the fight song, the hass j ,
drummer giving it all he had. The
train arrived. No stop. No team, j
Stunned, the hoarse singers stop
ped and the red-faced trombone
player paused to catch his breath.
Next to be serenaded was the 9:50 i
commuters' train, whose passen- j '
gei's waved obligingly to the wait- j
ing throng. Rumors that it was "all J
a Southern Pacific publicity stunt" j
started up from the impatient j 1
crowd. Wide-eyed 10-year-olds in ! ]
rooters' caps and Indian sweatshirts ! <
circulated through the singing Stan- j
fordilcs with the ever-present ques- i 1
tion "Where's the team?" on their
lips, but their queries wore drowned i
by lusty strains of "Give 'em the i
Ax-e-c-c-ay." I
Wondering just where the team
was, one loyal fan rushed over to j
the stationmaster and inquired with j
deep anxiety if the team was com
ing in on the train. "Wa-a-a-1-1, I
don't know,"he drawled, "but if
they aren't, I don't know what all
these people are doing over there."
Finally at 10:05 the second sec
tion of the orange Daylight ground j
to a stop before a dwindling but j
undaunted Farm cheering section. (,
The hand and the hoarse song
sters once more gave their all to J
"Come Join the Band." The train
left. No team. Suddenly Stan
"Raise Me Up on the Koof So I !
Can Lead the Yells" Shpetner i
rushed over shouting, "You can
quote me as having seen Mickey I 1
Titus!" ' !
Lost in the scramble of excited j
fans, Marchie Schwartz pushed his r
way unnoticed through the crowd 1
until the Coach Yell caught up with j
him. But no team. Then, coming j
down the platform from as last car,
a group of tired gridders were rec- J
ognized and quickly surrounded by j
a tight knot of admirers.
When the crowd finally melted
away, the coach said happily, "It I
was grand of tlje kids to come down. ;
All the fellows were tickled when |
they heard the music and the cheers I
as we pulled in."

Lost in the scramble of excited j
fans, Marchie Schwartz pushed his r
way unnoticed through the crowd 1
until the Coach Yell caught up with j
him. But no team. Then, coming j
down the platform from as last car,
a group of tired gridders were rec- J
ognized and quickly surrounded by j
a tight knot of admirers.
When the crowd finally melted
away, the coach said happily, "It I
was grand of tlje kids to come down. ;
All the fellows were tickled when |

"Come Join the Band" and the ,
cheers of some 300 Stanford root- |

Farm a football squad that had on J
Saturday gone down fighting to a
superior U.C.L.A. team. Quiet and
surprised, the team swung down off
the Daylight into a crowd that
wanted to demonstrate its allegiance
to the men who had tried to win
even when the score stood 20-0.
Two trains came and went before
the Daylight, 50 minutes late, pulled
in to the Southern Pacific station.
And as the impromptu rally ended, i
the crowd still wasn't positive if the '
team had heard their cheers. The 1
Indians had come and quietly gone.

the Daylight as it thundered
around the corner. The hand

train arrived. No stop. No team, j
Stunned, the hoarse singers stop

player paused to catch his breath.
Next to be serenaded was the 9:50 i
commuters' train, whose passen- j '
gei's waved obligingly to the wait- j
ing throng. Rumors that it was "all J

fordilcs with the ever-present ques- i 1
tion "Where's the team?" on their
lips, but their queries wore drowned i
by lusty strains of "Give 'em the i
Ax-e-c-c-ay." I
Wondering just where the team
was, one loyal fan rushed over to j
the stationmaster and inquired with j
deep anxiety if the team was com
ing in on the train. "Wa-a-a-1-1, I
don't know,"he drawled, "but if
they aren't, I don't know what all
these people are doing over there."
