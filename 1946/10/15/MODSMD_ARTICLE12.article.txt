# Greater Circulation Delays the Chappie
## 
### 
There shall lie no joy on the
Farm this Wednesday; the mighty
Chappy will not appeal*, lint all
is not lost! The October. (this is
still October) issue of the Stan
ford Chaparral will positively he
on sale next Wednesday, Oct. 23,
Boris Wolper, Chappie business
manager, announced today.
The delay is due partly to the
fact that so many off-campus sub
scriptions were sold that a larger
number of copies is being printed
than was originally contemplated.
Even with the increased numhci
of copies, Wolper advises every
one to get his copy early, as there
will still only he a limited num
ber of copies available.
Jackson Burke, assistant pro
duction manager of the Stanford
Press, was quoted as saying that:
l 'T his issue is so hot, we can't
put it on the presses until we
clear every other job."
