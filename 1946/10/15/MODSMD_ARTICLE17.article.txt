# Campus Auto Registration Begins Today
## 
### 
Registration of all automobiles of
student body members begins today
from 8:30 to 12 and 1 to 5 in spe
cial booths in the lobby of the
Administration Building.
The booths will be open daily un
til Oct. 31. Students arc asked to
bring their driver's licenses, stu
dent body cards, and registration
certificates for their motor vehicles
when they register. If these are
ready when the student registers,
there should be no long lines at the
booths.
Members of the Administration,
faculty members, and employees of
the University will receive written
instructions as to the procedure to
follow in obtaining the registration
stickers through the interdepart
mental mail.
This measure has been deemed
necessary because of the great con
gestion resulting from the largest
number of cars on campus in the
school's history. This move, com
bined with the expansion of park
ing facilities announced last week,
is expected to ease the situation
considerably.
