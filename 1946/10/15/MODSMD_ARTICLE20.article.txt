At the all-student A.S.S.U. elec

ing privileges on Excom, two repre
sentatives from Men's Row, one man
from Toyon, and one graduate
member at large; (2) two positions
on Men's Council, and one man on
the Stanford Athletic Control Coun
cil.
Proposed amendment number one
to the A.S.S.U. constitution con
cerns 2,000 students residing at
Stanford Village who arc presently
without representation on Excom.
VILLAGE AMENDMENT
When Excom representation was
changed from representation by
classes to representation by areas
last winter quarter, no provision
was made for representation in new
areas.
The amendment, designed to cur
red this oversight reads as follows:
"Excom shall have the power to
create voting members to represent
new areas added to the association."
If this provision is passed, legal ma
chinery will be set in motion to cre
ate new positions on Excom. Nomi
nations can then be submitted for a
later election.
Forty-four nominees have quali
fied for the elective positions by
maintaining a "C" average and by
being members in good standing of
the student body. Men's Council \
candidates have in addition fulfilled j
the requirement of 120 or more units
completed.
