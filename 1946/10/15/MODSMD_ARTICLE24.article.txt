## The
						Great Rugby Mystery 
### 
Defining the relative spheres of influence
of .student self government and ol university
administration is a difficult problem, and the
n suits of one such definitive failure are 21
very confused Stanfoid men central charac
ters in the "Great Rugby Mystery."
The 21 men of whom 6 are still on the
campus are members of the 1943 rugby team
..nd at this time they do not know whether or
not they are rugby members of Stanford's
Block S Society. The Block S Society includes
all t 1 :. gentlemen who have won varsity
letters in a major sport (or three letters in a
minor spori) and the awarding of membership
f-ntitles the student to wear the Block S swea
tor and to receive certain lifetime privileges
from the University.
The "Great Rugby Mystery" had its in
ception when the Executive Committee, on
April 21, 1943, in a burst ol generosity, aided
by political pressure from a large group of
well-meaning but misguided students, made
Rugby a major sport for the duration of the
war and gave Block S awards to members of
that year's excellent team with the proviso
that purchase of sweaters would be made by
the men earning them.
The recipients of this generosity received
one felt Block Sand nothing more. That was
three y.ears ago. It was the first and last
rugby team for the duration.
The motion was first brought up the year
befcre when captains of the 1942 and 1943
teams presented a petition on behalf of the
107 men playing rugby to make it-a major
sport. The captains backed up their argu
ments with letters of approval from Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur and Mr. Frank Fish Walker,
then Financial Vice-President of the Univer
sity. After vetoing the identical measure
passed in 1943, Excom tabled discussion of
the matter.
The next year, proponents of the change
exercised pressure against the wishes of Mr.
Alfred Masters and the Board of Athletic Con

trol. When the issue came before Excom, Mr.
Harry Maloney, the "Giand Old Man" of
Stanford Sports, went to the meeting to talk
against the motion. But after seeing the en
thusiasm of the rugby lobby, he allowed him
self to be talked out of his previous stand and
went on record in Excom minutes as favoring
the change in status.
Believing that rugby did not deserve this
new status, Mr. Masters, acting for the BAC,
relused to issue Block S cards. When the mat
ter came before the BAC, it was tabled indefi
nitely, and lost completely when that Board
passed out of existence last year.
Since that time, some of the men have
worn their Block S, others have not. Of those
wearing the sweater, almost everyone has
had one or two" embarassing experiences
when they were asked for their Block S cards
and been unable to produce.
Two issues appear to be at stake.
Specifically, the 21 men in all fairness
should have their status clarified by either re
ceiving all parts of a Block S award or none
at all. Of the two courses, the former would
seem to be easier since more than half of the
21 are already Block S winners in football and
the remainder would not even make a ripple
in Stanford's Block S pool.
Generally, the issue remains unsolved.
Overlooking the guestion of the wisdom of
Excom's decision, does Mr. Masters or any
other university administrator, however sin
cere his intentions, have the power to over
ride such student decisions with the resulting
inconsistency of final results?
The guestion is one familiar to all student
government, and it deserves an answer. Here
at Stanford, the answer can only be found by
a strong feeling of responsibility for its actions
on the part of Excom, a consideration of the
student viewpoint on the part of university
officials, and the existence of a higher review
body in the administration to pass quick and
final judgment on the inconsistencies of fu
ture diverse actions.—F.B.
