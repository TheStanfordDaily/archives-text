# CAMPUS OPINION

To the Editor:
For the past week, I have been reading articles
about the eating clubs. The only conclusion I can
draw from them is that, there is no future for them
nor is the Administration interested in seeing that
there will be. It is quite true that the Dean of Stu
dents' office has granted one dining room to six eating
clubs and that the club members will eat together.
Provisions allowing them to take new members into
the clubs weren't made, however.
11 was remarkably generous of the Administra
tion to allow them to eat together, but what value is
11 to the clubs If they can't perpetuate themselves?
The seventy members of these six clubs are riot per
manent students of Stanford. They will graduate
oine day. In fact I would say that the average mem
ber has only two quarters to go before graduating.
How can these clubs survive the present member
hip? No matter how you look at it, you cannot
â€¢: cape the fact a club needs members or else it
does not exist.
The Administration stated earlier this year that
it was interested in seeing the return of the eating
clubs to the campus. Is this, then, the Administra
tion's (iiial word on the eating clubs - an opportunity
for a slow but inevitable death? 1 should hope that.
,\uch is not the case and that a traditional institution
<<l Stanford Will be able to lake its rightful place in
the postwar years.

To the Editor:
Apropos of the discussion of mixed or unmixed
rooting sections, we have kept silent as long as we
can. We feel strongly in favor of segregation in the
rooting section. It has been traditional to have the
sexes segregated at the games. But we don't feel
the way we do just because of tradition as such;
this tradition has a basis in fact. In previous years
III" fellows and the gals were able to live apart for
two and a half hours without any ill effects. We
don't think things have changed that much in the
past four years. The guys and gal.s had a fine time,
able to express their own opinions of the officials,
without, however, falling to the low of California's
famous rooting section's cursing of the referee in
unison.
The matter becomes simply a question: do we go
to the games to see the play, to help perform the
card stunts, to root for our team, to form the "S"
with rooters' caps or is it a date affair at which the
fine plays ait* missed through gazing into the eyes of
our latest flame? We leel that the spirit in mixed
tooting sections cannot compare with that of segre
gated sections. In the past, our segregated section
has out-yelled rooting sections three times our size.
We wholeheartedly agree with the present policy of
Kally Com in the segregation of the rooting section.
