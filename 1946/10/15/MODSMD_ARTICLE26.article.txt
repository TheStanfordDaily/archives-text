# BILL COUGHLIN
## BULL SESSION 
### 
Well, everybody's back again, sleepy and bleary
ryed. Those who stayed at home had no trouble
yesterday spotting the ori'.vs that went south. They
looked definitely un-veni, un-vidi and un-vouy,
to paraphrase Rally Corn's horrible paraphrasing.
Those of you who made the trek and bought tip
lets and codlets on the Daylight, or discovered that
rooters' trains still have square wheels, or drove
hack roads looking for the shortest way to L.A.,
know all the details of the big weekend. But for
the benefit of the other ball who stayed home I add
a few notes.
Stanford's rooting section looked as large as
Ucla's used to be in the old pre-war days. The
Westwood side looked even larger than Cal formerly
did at the Game. (Cal now must undoubtedly
look like a Legion convention when they pack into
a stadium.)
Aft»r talking to people who sat at various points
around the Coliseum, it is apparent that the Indian
rooting section, tremendously outnumbered, made
almost twice as much noise as the huge Bntin sec
tion. The spirit was tremendous down there, even
after it was obvious the Indians were going to lose.
The Stanford band was larger than the Bruin ag
gregation, which contained many females. It marched
better and it played better. Only thing the West
wood musicians bad that we couldn't top was the two
drum majorettes.
Alter the game, an observer who didn't know the

outcome would have thought the Indians had won.
The Westwood rooters wandered listlessly out of
the stadium after the serenading while the Stan
ford band, followed by great numbers of singing
Farm rooters, played its way loudly out to the
busses.
The card stunts at halftime were noted as ex
cellent by (hose who sat on the other side of the
huge Coliseum. Rally Com can take a hard-earned
and well-deserved bow for that portion of the pro
ceedings. U.C.L.A. turned out some mighty fine
card tricks themselves but a few were so botched
it was hard to tell what they were trying to do.
Two Bruin ringers who sat with us in the root
ing section during the game were greatly impressed
by the effervescent Stanford spirit. They declared
that it was far greater than anything they had wit
nessed in Uclan sections. At the end of the game,
they declared that sitting in a Stanford rooting
section was "much more fun." So there.
And of course it is absolutely unnecessary to
mention that the boys on the team earned more re
spect and praise for the manner in which they played
and continued fighting all the way than any squad
that has played down there in quite a while.
Never have I seen a Stanford aggregation—team,
l«md, and rooting section—give the Southland a bet
ter impression of our school. It was a good week
end.
And. oh brother, those parlies Friday and Sat
urday nights!

know all the details of the big weekend. But for
the benefit of the other ball who stayed home I add
a few notes.
Stanford's rooting section looked as large as
Ucla's used to be in the old pre-war days. The
Westwood side looked even larger than Cal formerly
did at the Game. (Cal now must undoubtedly
look like a Legion convention when they pack into
a stadium.)
Aft»r talking to people who sat at various points
around the Coliseum, it is apparent that the Indian
rooting section, tremendously outnumbered, made
almost twice as much noise as the huge Bntin sec
tion. The spirit was tremendous down there, even
after it was obvious the Indians were going to lose.
The Stanford band was larger than the Bruin ag
gregation, which contained many females. It marched
better and it played better. Only thing the West
wood musicians bad that we couldn't top was the two
drum majorettes.
Alter the game, an observer who didn't know the

outcome would have thought the Indians had won.
The Westwood rooters wandered listlessly out of
the stadium after the serenading while the Stan
ford band, followed by great numbers of singing
Farm rooters, played its way loudly out to the
busses.
The card stunts at halftime were noted as ex
cellent by (hose who sat on the other side of the
huge Coliseum. Rally Com can take a hard-earned
and well-deserved bow for that portion of the pro
ceedings. U.C.L.A. turned out some mighty fine
card tricks themselves but a few were so botched
it was hard to tell what they were trying to do.
Two Bruin ringers who sat with us in the root
ing section during the game were greatly impressed
by the effervescent Stanford spirit. They declared
that it was far greater than anything they had wit
nessed in Uclan sections. At the end of the game,
they declared that sitting in a Stanford rooting
section was "much more fun." So there.
And of course it is absolutely unnecessary to
mention that the boys on the team earned more re
spect and praise for the manner in which they played
and continued fighting all the way than any squad
that has played down there in quite a while.
Never have I seen a Stanford aggregation—team,
l«md, and rooting section—give the Southland a bet
ter impression of our school. It was a good week
end.
And. oh brother, those parlies Friday and Sat
urday nights!
Well, everybody's back again, sleepy and bleary
ryed. Those who stayed at home had no trouble
yesterday spotting the ori'.vs that went south. They
looked definitely un-veni, un-vidi and un-vouy,
to paraphrase Rally Corn's horrible paraphrasing.
Those of you who made the trek and bought tip
lets and codlets on the Daylight, or discovered that
rooters' trains still have square wheels, or drove
hack roads looking for the shortest way to L.A.,
know all the details of the big weekend. But for
the benefit of the other ball who stayed home I add
