FROM THE DAILY'S VILLAGE DESK.- Meeting of house rep
resentatives at Village Center tonight at 7:30 launches student
government at Stanford's post-war housing project on its second
phase.
Summer Excom's proposed plan for student government

within tltc Villa}',e called lor a Vil
luge Conference com posed ol repre
sentatives from each house, a mni
cil, and Excoiri representative. Thus
fur houses have selected their offi
cers, completing the plan's lirs!
ptia.se.
Tonight's Conference meeting
must decide future trends of stu
dent. government at the Village, in- j
tramural spoils participation, so
cial plans, and proposed establish- j
ment of a Village weekly paper.
The Conference will study Ex- I
corn's student government sugges- i
lions.
Village needs are two-fold: there's i
the problem of cementing Village |
life with campus, and there's need
for internal student government to
decide problems growing up with
an expanding Village.
The Village may well become the
hub of campus society. Last week
bowling alleys opened; league play
began yesterday. "Village" is more
than just a name. Added to the al
ready established cleaners, soda
fountain, store, and barber shop, is
a new Roos Brothers store. Movies
are scheduled soon; potential for
| intramural sports is almost unlim
ited. The unfolding pattern of Vil
lage complexity calls for an active
Conference.
Village Director Wunde r 1 i c h
wants to sweep the "bugaboo" of
"barracks" from his "city." He feels
a director's position should parallel
that of a city manager's, with an
active Conference and Council do
ing most of the policy forming. Rig
id discipline left with the Army.
Like other "cities," the Village is
feeling effects of a San Francisco
strike. Uncompleted are rooms in
four newly opened barracks as floor
surfacers in the Buy Area continue
on strike. However, most rooms in
four newly opened dormitories as
floor surfacers in the area continue
en couples with children; 8 child
less couples now live in the Vil
lage.
| Village integration with ealnpus is
! the aim of Villagers and on-campus
students alike. Summer Excom's
lengthy, detailed survey, up for
consideration tonight by the Con
ference, is designed for mutual in
tegration.
Excom's plan calls for a Confer
ence—composed of "one representa
tive from each single men's build
ing, regardless of size." Women's
quarters are to be represented alsd
Meeting once weekly, the Confer
ence will elect from its own mem
bership a Council. The Council,
with legislative - executive power,
will formulate Village policy. Ex
com suggests "at least two members
shall be married students and no
more than three." Hall elections, as
recommended, would be held every
half year.
Whether these suggestions will be
adopted in whole or in part or
amended rests with tonight's Con
ference meeting — embarking on
phase two of Village government.
