# Winters Reads Poetry Today
## 
### 
Poems by American pools of the
17th and 18th centuries will be read
this afternoon at 4:15 in the Brings
Room of the Humanities Building
by Yvor Winters, associate profes
sor of English.
The reading will consist of four
poems by Edward Taylor, three by
Philip Freneau, and one by Joel
Barlow.
Edward Taylor was a Metaphysi
cal poet in the age of Pope. Philip
Freneau is one of our best patriotic
poets, and was long regarded as the
first American poet of any impor
tance. Joel Barlow writes in mock
heroic form, but expresses his nos
talgic love for the rural New Eng
land of his youth.
This poetry reading will begin a
series of six sponsored by the De
partment of English and given on
consecutive Tuesdays from 4:15 to
o in the Briggs Room.
