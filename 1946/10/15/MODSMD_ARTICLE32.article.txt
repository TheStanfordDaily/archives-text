riety, and not enough has been
written about the Brazilian people
themselves," Lawrence said.
The setting of two of his short
stories is also laid in Brazil. These
stories, entitled "The Shadow of a
Dream" which concerns a veteran's
readjustment to drab civilian life
after the comparatively glamorous
life of the service, and "Dom Pe
