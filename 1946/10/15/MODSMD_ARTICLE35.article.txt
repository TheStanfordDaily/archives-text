Pfui! Now I gotta go to Hawaii.
I don't want to go to Hawaii; I was
all set lor Pasadena. Even bought a
rootin' cap and a pompom. Now I'm
gonna trade 'cm in for a recipe for
breadfruit a la mode.
I've got good reason for all this
wot*, and I can name the guys re
sponsible for it, too. There's four of
'cm and they all play end. Fore
most for my dough it a bruiser
named Burr Baldwin, and he is
aptly named. Then there's three
other guys who answer to Tom
Fears, Roy Kurrasch and Phil Tins
ley.
If you saw Saturday's einhro
glio, you won't see four better
men playing that position this
year, and maybe for some seasons
lo come. Other schools may have
one guy as good, hut not four
that good.
Dick Hyland of the L.A. Times
put it very aptly when he said that
some wise gUy in the press box
claimed tluit all you had to do to
reverse the score was to give Stan
ford the Bruin ends. The guy that
said it might have been wise, but
he certainly was no fool.
The ends did all the damage to
the Farm, and here's how they did
it. U.C.L.A. has a host of good
backs, but Merriman and Co. are
just as good in most respects, bet
ter in a couple, and worse in a
couple. The two lines, from tackle
to tackle, are almost as evenly
matched as you would care to see.
So that left it up to the ends.
Our boys are fast—that shovel
lateral to a back skirting the flank
is still our best play—but when
they run into a brick wall they
have to stop. The ends were the
brick wall; they turned the end
runs in, scattered or took out the
interference, and then, lying flat
on the ground, would reach up
and trip the runner.
When wo tried the middle of the
line, the ends would come in and
snare the ball carrier from behind.
They rushed the passers and slowed
up the pass receivers. Other than ;
that they didn't do very much, j
Some of the other guys on the
Bruin squad did some damage of
their own, too.
They've got a beautiful passer
in (his Ernie Case kid. hut who
wouldn't look beautiful wilh a
couple of hallhawks like these
Bruin flankmcn? When Case
called an end around, the ends
made sure nobody was going to
turn it in; when Ucla went
through the line, the line backers
were well taken care of. And thai
was just about the ball game.
Except . . . the Indians powered :
their way to scoring territory three
times in the second half, and should
have had three touchdowns. At
least that's what it looked like from
the press box. Mickey Titus, Bear
Quist and Merriman made consid- |
erable yardage through the middle
in the latter half. Perhaps more of
the same would have closed the tal- j
ly gap more respectably.

There's one thing the Indians can
1)0 grateful about. Although they j
took a fearful beating, they handed
out more than they received, col- j
lecting only a large assortment of j
varied cuts and bruises. The Bru
ins, however, had two men (Fears J
and Malmberg) badly banged up,
plus bruises that more than equaled !
those of the Indians.
And a third Uclan was slowed
down considerably, little Cal Ros
si, who gave the Cards a had time
until big Freddie Boensch tackled
him and knocked him cold in the
second quarter. That did slow
the little man down; after that he i
went by Boensch on tiptoes.
The most heartening thing of all, j
though, was in the dressing room. !
Big Jim Reynolds—Stanford's per
ennial sophomoric alumnus — sta- j
tinned himself by the door and kept
repeating constantly to everyone
who entered:
"It's the last one we'll lose."
