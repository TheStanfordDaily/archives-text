I'LL BET HIS UNCLES HATE HIMâ€”Jerry Shipkey, nephew of Stanford greats of
other years, tacks up six points for the Uclan Bruins Saturday afternoon in the second
quarter. Shipkey went through the Injun line like a jet-propelled cannonbail, giving

safctyman Aub Devine (19) no chance for a play, while Bobby Anderson (17) gets
blocked out, superfluous piece of action on somebody's part.
