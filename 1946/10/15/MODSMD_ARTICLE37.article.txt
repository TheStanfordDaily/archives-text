# JV's Prep For Broncs
## 
### 
Stanford's junior varsity football
squad returned to active duty last
night when they held their first
workout since last Saturday. Stan
ford's B's will meet Santa ICara's
J.V.'s nÂ«xl Saturday in a prelimi
nary to the varsity clash.
Coach Ed Stamm has scheduled
varied workouts for the week so
that the squad can polish its all
around game. However, he will
avoid all but the briefest contact
work so that all possible injuries
will be thwarted.
Last contact work the team had
was last Thursday when Stamm
sent his men through a full-dress
game scrimmage. Since then most
of the boys have relaxed with a trip
to the Southland.
Three men who have been on the
injured list for the past few weeks
suited up to help Stamm fill the
gap left by the advancement of sev
eral men to the varsity. They are
Walker Smith and Jimmy Dooley,
ends, and Ralph Davis, first-string
fullback at the beginning of the
season. All three will be ready to
go this Saturday.
Little is known about the Santa
Clara bunch that the Card eleven
will have to face. However, they
lost to the California Ramblers by
a score ol 33 to G last week.
"But they should give us a good
game,'' says Stamm.
