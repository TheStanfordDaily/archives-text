# World Series Finale Today; Dave Ferriss Faces Dickson
## 
### 
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 15 (UP).—The
World Series' ends at Sportsman's
Park today when the St. Louis Car
dinals send little Murry Dickson
against big Dave (Boo) Ferriss of
the favored Boston Red Sox in the
seventh and final game of the 194G
classic.
This is only the tenth time in
series history that baseball's blue
ribbon event has gone the lull
seven-game distance. And the
fighting Cardinals, who three times
battled back to square the count,

ignored the 10 to 13 odds against
them.
The biggest job rested on the
shoulders of Dickson, a slim, wiry
righthander from Tracy, Mo., who
until this season was only a relief
ruler. Boston Manager Joe Cronin
believes that he has the antidote in
Ferriss, the husky Mississippian
who led American League pitchers
in percentage this season with 2, r >
wins and only six defeats. For
Ferriss never was in trouble as he
won the third game of the series —
and beat Dickson to boot.
