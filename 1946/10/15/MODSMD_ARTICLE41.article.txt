# Facilities Limit All Eating Clubs

### JACK OGLESBY 
In this last of a series of articles on Eating Clubs, their organ
ization will be discussed. It is rather unusual that a club or group
of clubs have to be more or less "explained" after existing 35
years. But Eating Clubs are strictly local. There is no national
organization to keep things going once local members leave.

Thus, after a period of three years
during which the clubs have been
closed, they have to start almost
from scratch. The turnover of stu
dents in a school is quite rapid when
you stop to think about it, and any
club that shuts its door for several
years is usually just about finished.
That the Eating Clubs have not
completely dried up and blown
away is a good indication of how
deep the roots are and what tre
mendous interest the members
and alumni have in retaining this
feature of Stanford life.
Each Eating Club used to include
between thirty and fifty members.
Of tlie seven clubs, three were in
dependent and ate in their own
buildings which formed "The Little
Quad."
CLUB PROCEDURE
A president, secretary-treasurer
and manager were elected once a
quarter or at other periods accord
ing to the club constitutions. A
rushing season was carried out at
the beginning of fall quarter. The
usual procedure was to invite pro
spective members to the club for
various meals, and make sure that
everyone got acquainted. It gener
ally operated in the same manner as
fraternities.
Meetings were held once a week
after dinner.
Any question one might ask
about the activities and organiza
tion of Eating Clubs can be an
swered by comparison to fraterni
ties. Take a fraternity, for exam
ple, subtract the sleeping facili
ties and the close ties of fraternity
life to which a certain number of
students object, and you have the
Eating Clubs.
EATING AT ENCINA
There are approximately a hun
dred and twenty members at Stan
ford today. Of these, however, sev
enty are able to eat' at the Encina
Commons. Last week, the univer
sity granted the return of one club
dining room. With a capacity of 72.
all the clubs will assemble to eat in
this one room.
Until the administration returns
more rooms or until new club
houses are built, the organizations
are faced with a tremendous prob
lem of self-perpetuation. Several of
the clubs, however, are proceeding
to make plans for obtaining new
members.
It is hoped that club rooms, al
though not dining rooms, can be
acquired before the quarter is
over. With these facilities, the
clubs hope to operate until dining
rooms can be found or built.
NEW MEMBERS WANTED
For those who are interested in
the clubs, it has been suggested that
they contact Ray Smith, president
of the Interclub Council.
The Council consists of represen
tatives from each club. A president
and secretary elected from the
group and the organization serves
to co-ordinate the activities of the
club in addition to representing the
clubs as a whole. Phil Chandler is
secretary at present.
This is almost the end of the
story of the Stanford Eating
Clubs. There are many things
left untold due to space and time,
but the high points have been
covered.
What the future of the clubs will
be will depend on what support
they get from the University. The
clubs have proven their worth in
the past and it seems logical that
the Administration will do its best to
maintain this Stanford institution.

spective members to the club for
various meals, and make sure that
everyone got acquainted. It gener
ally operated in the same manner as
fraternities.
Meetings were held once a week
after dinner.
Any question one might ask
about the activities and organiza
tion of Eating Clubs can be an
swered by comparison to fraterni
ties. Take a fraternity, for exam
ple, subtract the sleeping facili
ties and the close ties of fraternity
life to which a certain number of
students object, and you have the
Eating Clubs.
EATING AT ENCINA
There are approximately a hun
dred and twenty members at Stan
ford today. Of these, however, sev
enty are able to eat' at the Encina
Commons. Last week, the univer
sity granted the return of one club
dining room. With a capacity of 72.
all the clubs will assemble to eat in
this one room.
Until the administration returns
more rooms or until new club
houses are built, the organizations
are faced with a tremendous prob
lem of self-perpetuation. Several of
the clubs, however, are proceeding
to make plans for obtaining new
members.
It is hoped that club rooms, al
though not dining rooms, can be
acquired before the quarter is
over. With these facilities, the
clubs hope to operate until dining
rooms can be found or built.
NEW MEMBERS WANTED
For those who are interested in
the clubs, it has been suggested that
they contact Ray Smith, president
of the Interclub Council.
The Council consists of represen
tatives from each club. A president
and secretary elected from the
group and the organization serves
to co-ordinate the activities of the
club in addition to representing the
clubs as a whole. Phil Chandler is
secretary at present.
This is almost the end of the
story of the Stanford Eating
Clubs. There are many things
left untold due to space and time,
but the high points have been
covered.
What the future of the clubs will
be will depend on what support
they get from the University. The
clubs have proven their worth in
the past and it seems logical that
the Administration will do its best to
maintain this Stanford institution.
In this last of a series of articles on Eating Clubs, their organ
ization will be discussed. It is rather unusual that a club or group
of clubs have to be more or less "explained" after existing 35
years. But Eating Clubs are strictly local. There is no national
organization to keep things going once local members leave.

Thus, after a period of three years
during which the clubs have been
closed, they have to start almost
from scratch. The turnover of stu
dents in a school is quite rapid when
you stop to think about it, and any
club that shuts its door for several
years is usually just about finished.
That the Eating Clubs have not
completely dried up and blown
away is a good indication of how
deep the roots are and what tre
mendous interest the members
and alumni have in retaining this
feature of Stanford life.
Each Eating Club used to include
between thirty and fifty members.
Of tlie seven clubs, three were in
dependent and ate in their own
buildings which formed "The Little
Quad."
CLUB PROCEDURE
A president, secretary-treasurer
and manager were elected once a
quarter or at other periods accord
ing to the club constitutions. A
rushing season was carried out at
the beginning of fall quarter. The
usual procedure was to invite pro
spective members to the club for
various meals, and make sure that
everyone got acquainted. It gener
ally operated in the same manner as
fraternities.
Meetings were held once a week
