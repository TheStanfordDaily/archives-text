### 
What China needs is a moral and
intellectual renaissance, Dr. T. C.
Lin, visiting professor in Asiatic
studies, told members of the Chinese
American Friendship League in the
lower lounge of the Women's Club
house yesterday.
Diverging from the pre-announc
ed topic of "Current Problems in
Chinese Government," Dr. Lin
spoke on relations between United
States and China, stressing especi
ally the lack of understanding of
respective cultural and social aims.
WESTERN THOUGHT STUDIED
The Chinese government has ap
propriated a sum to be utilized in
founding libraries of western
thought in which the ordinary stu
dent might become better acquaint
ed with western ideas, Dr. Lin said.
Speaking of the present hostili
ties in China. Dr. Lin said that civil
war is unavoidable because of in
compatible ideologies complicated
by clashes of personality. He com
pares this with the present struggle
between Byrnes and Molotov.
EMPHASIS ON FACTS
Blasting American education, he
stressed that our colleges are plac
ing too great an emphasis on facts
and virtually none on values. Chi
nese education stressed values in
the past but now follows the same
pattern as American colleges.
Dr. Lin came to the United States
last year as a guest of the State De
partment. He has been lecturing in
the East, and will go to Europe next
year. He is currently giving two
courses at Stanford in Chinese civi
lization.
The talk by Dr. Lin was sponsored
by the Chinese American Friend
ship League. Discussions are held
on the first and third Mondays of
each month.
