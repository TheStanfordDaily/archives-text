### MARY VIRGINIA POND 
The Dutch student stood and j
j looked at Sequoia Hall, and .soon an I
American student walked toward j
j her. '"Why is this building empty?"
the Dutch student asked the Stan
ford student.
i"It is condemned—the roof may
j fall in," the Stanford student said.
"In Holland we would be glad to
| have this building, even if the roof
I had already fallen in," the Dutch |
j student replied.
STUDENTS' PLIGHT TOLD
Over in Cubberley Auditorium at
the World Student Service Fund [
Conference an American student j
who traveled in Europe this sum- I
mer addressed 120 students and fac- j
ulty who were there to hear what i
j was happening to their fellow stu- j
| dents abroad.
"We arrived at Victoria Station in
England," the American student j
| said. "The roof had fallen in, and !
! we could see the sky through it.
"A man walked up to us, when he ■
saw us all together in the group, ,
| and said, 'Do you want to buy this j
too?' That was the first prick," the
j American student said.
She went on. "Some time later
my pen was out of ink. I went up
to the hotel desk and filled it. A |
man came up. 'Don't you think
you're being just a bit cheap?' he
asked. 'Cheap?' I replied. I al
-1 most laughed and then I remem
bered. They can't even get ink
over here.
" 'I'm sorry, I'll pay for it,' I said.
He laughed. And I thought—l'm
just like all Americans. I take some
| thing and then offer to pay for it.
POLISH INCIDENT
"At the tea for all the delegates
at the International Student Service
| Conference in Cambridge, England,
[ I sat next to a Polish girl. I tried to j
) talk to her. She was wearing a !
brown suit, the one she had been j
wearing all week—her only one. I I
| was wearing my oldest suit too.
"She turned around and said, j
'I'm sorry I ever came to this i
Conference. I'm sorry I saw all
you American girls with your
fancy clothes. I don't think you'll
s help us or do us any good at all.'
Thai was the second prick."
"Now," the American student said. !
! "picture this Cubberley Auditorium
i with its red plush seats over in
; Czechoslovakia — at the Masaryk
University. See all the students sit- j
ting in it and the professor lectur
ing.
CLASSROOM JAILS
"Now picture it divided up into
75 cell blocks, each just big enough
for one cot. That's the way the lec
| ture halls are. The Gestapo in
j terned the students and their pro
i "essors there.
"The students who could get

away moved their laboratories,
the books, and what little food
they had down into the stalactite
caves and lived there. The Ger
mans were afraid to enter the
caves.
FACTS, NOT FOOD
Of students who spend their mon
ey for a mimeograph machine be
cause they think it is more impor
tant to learn, to remember what
their professors have to say, than it
is to eat.
Of students who helped Allied
aviators back to their bases and hid

refugee Jews —who spearheaded the
| resistance.
Of students whose one lesson
learned during the war was that
they were to be the leaders to
huilri out of the ruins—if they
lived.
The Dutch student said, '"The stu
dents in Europe don't believe in big
words. They heard them from Hit
ler, and they hear them from the
Peace Conference. But when you
act they begin to believe you. That
is why World Student Service Fund
is so important."


THE RUINS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAEN on the Normandy
Peninsula stand gutted as do the hollow buildings of other Euro
pean universities. The rebuilding of these universities depends upon
American students and their response to World Student Service Fund
this vear.
