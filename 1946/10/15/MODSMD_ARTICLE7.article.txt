# Truman Removes Controls On Meat, Livestock Prices

### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 (UP).—President Truman, in a sur
prise move to break the meat famine, announced tonight that all
price controls on livestock and meat will be lifted tomorrow.
Secretary of Agriculture Clinton P. Anderson said the direc
tive would become effective with the opening of business to
morrow morning.

The President, after a long study
of the meat situation with his top
government officials, said in a na
tionwide radio address that "there is
only one remedy left—that is to lift
controls on meat."
"Accordingly," Mr. Truman told
his radio audience, "the Secretary of
Agriculture and the Price Adminis
trator are removing all price con
trols on livestock, and food and feed
products therefrom—tomorrow."
CATTLE FROM MEXICO
At the same time, Mr. Truman
announced that he had ordered an
investigation into the feasibility of
importing cattle from Mexico.
As a result of this investigation,
he said the Mexican border "may be
opened at once."
The President said bitterly that
his hand was forced by "selfish in
terests" in the livestock industry
and a "reckless group" in Congress
who combined to defeat the admin
istration's original price control law
last summer.
These men, he said, "have been
determined for some time to wreck
price controls no matter what the
cost might be to our people."
"The people," he added, " will
know where the responsibility rests
if profiteering on meat raises prices
so high that the average American
cannot buy it."
SHOULD HAVE MEAT
Joseph B. Danzansky, Washington
representative of the National Asso
ciation of Meat Wholesalers and Re
tailers, said the people "should have
meat at reasonable prices" within
30 days as a result of the President's
action. He added that he didn't
think the possibility of opening the
Mexican border to cattle would af
fect the domestic supply.
"I think President Truman for
the first time in the entire situation
has demonstrated that face-saving
doesn't mean as much as the wel
fare of the people," he said. "I
think we can look forward confi
dently to a situation where the pub
lic is going to get meat and I think
that within 30 days we'll have meat
at reasonable prices that every
housewife can afford."
"This does not mean the end of
controls now," the President cau
tioned. "Some items, like rent, will
have to be controlled for a long
time to come. Other items, of
which there is now a grave short
age, will have to remain under con
trol until production of them has
been greatly increased."
