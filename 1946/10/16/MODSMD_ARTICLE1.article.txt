# Goering Suicides as 10 Hang; 'Get Industrialists'—Jackson
## 
### 
NUERNBERG, Germany, Wednesday, Oct. 16 (UP).—Ten Nazi
war criminals were executed by hanging today in Nuernberg
Prison, but the 11th, Reichmarshal Hermann Goering, committed
suicide by taking cyanide of potassium.
Goering killed himself in his cell at 10:45 o'clock last night,
it was announced.
He was under closest watch by a guard who kept him in
sight at all times through an opening in his ceil door. The guard
thought Goering was motionless. Suddenly the sentry heard
him make a strange noise. He called the corporal of the guard.
World War Criminal No. 1 was dead.
The other 10 condemned men in their cells were awaiting
death. A chill autumn wind moaned outside.
Prison authorities were reading out the death sentences. They
were nearing Goering's cell.
The cell sentry and the corporal of the guard called the prison
physician and chaplain. They found bits of glass in Goering's
mouth and from the odor identified the poison which killed him
as cyanide.
While officials started an investigation, Goering's 10 fellow
criminals paraded to the gallows in the early hours and were
hanged.
Goering was to have led the procession.
The prison gymnasium was used as the execution chamber.
Three gallows had been erected there under electric lights.
Two of them were used.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 15 (UP).—
Supreme Court Justice Robert H.
Jackson tonight recommended to
President Truman that, "many"'
German industrialists, politicians
and diplomats be brought to justice
through war crimes trials.
Endorsing the verdicts of the
Nuernberg tribunal in a formal
report to Mr. Truman, Jackson
said that "a considerable number
of industrialists and financiers,
leading cabinet ministers, top SS
and police officials, and militar
ists" should be prosecuted.
He advocated that these lesser
war criminals be tried by each of
the occupying powers within its
own zone. Thus each nation would
assume responsibility for the pris
oners in its own custody.
Jackson endorsed the Nuernberg
decisions as having:
"Put international law square
ly on the side of peace as against
aggressive warfare," he said, "and
on the side of humanity as against
persecution."
He said that "in the present de
pressing world outlook, it is pos
sible that the Nuernberg trial may
constitute the most important moral
advance to grow out of this war."
"There are many industrialists,
militarists, politicians, diplomats
and police officials whose guilt
does not differ from those who
have been convicted, except that
their parts were at lower levels
and have been less conspicuous,"
he said.

Prison, but the 11th, Reichmarshal Hermann Goering, committed
suicide by taking cyanide of potassium.
Goering killed himself in his cell at 10:45 o'clock last night,
it was announced.
He was under closest watch by a guard who kept him in
sight at all times through an opening in his ceil door. The guard
thought Goering was motionless. Suddenly the sentry heard
him make a strange noise. He called the corporal of the guard.
World War Criminal No. 1 was dead.
The other 10 condemned men in their cells were awaiting
death. A chill autumn wind moaned outside.
Prison authorities were reading out the death sentences. They
were nearing Goering's cell.
The cell sentry and the corporal of the guard called the prison
physician and chaplain. They found bits of glass in Goering's
mouth and from the odor identified the poison which killed him
as cyanide.
While officials started an investigation, Goering's 10 fellow
criminals paraded to the gallows in the early hours and were
hanged.
Goering was to have led the procession.
The prison gymnasium was used as the execution chamber.
Three gallows had been erected there under electric lights.
Two of them were used.

'NUERNBERG —AN ADVANCE'
WASHINGTON, Oct. 15 (UP).—
Supreme Court Justice Robert H.
Jackson tonight recommended to
President Truman that, "many"'
German industrialists, politicians
and diplomats be brought to justice
through war crimes trials.
Endorsing the verdicts of the
Nuernberg tribunal in a formal
report to Mr. Truman, Jackson
said that "a considerable number
of industrialists and financiers,
leading cabinet ministers, top SS
and police officials, and militar
ists" should be prosecuted.
He advocated that these lesser
war criminals be tried by each of
the occupying powers within its
own zone. Thus each nation would
assume responsibility for the pris
oners in its own custody.
Jackson endorsed the Nuernberg
decisions as having:
"Put international law square
ly on the side of peace as against
aggressive warfare," he said, "and
on the side of humanity as against
persecution."
He said that "in the present de
pressing world outlook, it is pos
sible that the Nuernberg trial may
constitute the most important moral
advance to grow out of this war."
"There are many industrialists,
militarists, politicians, diplomats
and police officials whose guilt
does not differ from those who
have been convicted, except that
their parts were at lower levels
and have been less conspicuous,"
he said.
