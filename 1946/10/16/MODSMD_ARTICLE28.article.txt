## Clubs—Final Answer? 
### 
Conditions facing the Eating Clubs as they
open Ibis noon testify clearly that their ren
ascence is only temporary. Seven clubs with
. total rnsmbership of 70 men, restricted to
oiui 72-man dining room for their home terri
tory, have no method of perpetuating them
selves after graduation, and no hopes of en
larging their present groups into the effective
i lit:-; they once were.
University officials are aware that their
answer the granting of one room in which
th ■ ? j ;a can eat together is not satisfactory.
The air. »al of 7,000 students foreclosed their
original intent to house all eating clubs at
Branner and Encina Commons. According to
Dr. Tresidder, "space for social activities is at
such a premium ihat we have been unable to
assign separate clubrooms to any of the eat
ing clubs, the International Club, Sequoia
Club, and several other worthy student
groups."
Should a simple answer present itself, the
University would surely give it. But the re
search of the University officials and Eating
Club representatives has found none.
To reserve dining room space or turn over
social-room space to the eating clubs would,
in the minds of these officials be detrimental
to the non-eating club men (about 800) who
eat at Encina Commons and live in the dor
mitory.
but for lack of a simple answer, the offi
cials must sooner or later decide whether in
co cnience to these students outweighs the
advantages offered to the University as a
whole by the forceful return of the clubs.
These adjustments, we believe, could be
made:
1. By staggering the dining hours of En

cina Commons, more than the present 900 per
sons could conveniently be fed. While the
Army fed its 2,000 at the Commons, it held
the dining room doors open one and one-half
hours at lunchtime instead of the three-quar
ters of an hour the doors are now open.
An additional room could be awarded to
the Eating Clubs on this basis, since the time
for a turnover in the dining rooms would be
lengthened. This would allow each club to
pledge 10 additional members.
2. The University rule for having men eat
where they live should be excepted for Eat
ing Club members, so that men living at the
Village or off campus will have equal oppor
tunity to join the clubs—as they have the
opportunity to join fraternities.
3. Until such time as building plans of
the University can be carried out, to provide
small dormitories with dining facilities for
groups like the clubs, the proposition might
be put to the men living in Encina: would it
be agreeable to you to have one of the study
rooms adjoining the lounge turned over to the
Eating Clubs? These men are not isolated
from the clubs, for many will have the choice
to join either a club or fraternity by the close
of this year.
In fewer words, the Eating Clubs must have
a priority in University plans, or they will
cease to exist. The Daily feels that this prior
ity is justified in the light of the positive goods
offered by the clubs—to wit, a balance for
fraternity organization, and an opportunity for
the more independent type of student to affili
ate himself with an active social organization
without thereby too closely restricting his
personal freedom.
