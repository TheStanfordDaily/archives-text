## BULL SESSION 
### 
(Editor's note: Whether women are allotted 2:30
late leaves depends on the decision of women
themselves. One-thirties were inaugurated during
the war hy the women, and a proposal to grant
these leaves last year was very quickly discounted
liy Women's Conference before it came to a vote
of house meetings. Miss Brown, acting chief coun
selor for women, made the statement yesterday that
the leaves could be granted if the women felt
tltey were justified.)
Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, real live
Sianl'ord girls us°d to be able to stay out until 2:30
a.m. That was way back before there was a nasty
old war.
Then along came Remember Pearl Harbor and
the dirty Japs (boooooooo) and the powers-that-be
decided that these Stanford girls certainly shouldn't
• t. \ out ho late at night with this war because maybe
a little yellow Jap would get 'em before 2:30 and,
besides, they certainly should be devoting all their
efforts to winning the war.
So from then on, all the real live Stanford girls
;.ii l ome not quite so alive had to be in by 1:30 so
they could get up the next morning and roll band
ages.
And so now the war is over. (Yes, it is, too, the
Daily said so.) And what has happened to this late
leave arrangement which had beon ballyhooed as a
wartime emergency measure? Nothing. Like so
many things that were slipped in under the guise of
wartime patriotism, it remains with us.
Now say what you will, there were many reasons
b( hind the 1:30 arrangement, regardless of those
that were stated publicly at the time. For one thing,
the bars all close a( 12. And that leaves an awful
lot of time to kill between 12 and 2:30. But of course
no nice Stanford girl ever goes into a bar so that
takes care of that. And if some un-nice eager one
does happen to frequent a tavern she can always
leave at 11 and still have two and a half hours for
whatever she plans on doing.
Besides, a judge has now ruled that the California
midnight closing is illegal and that may soon b'j
abolished. So what else is there?
There is the very touchy subject that we must
prevent the honor of our Stanford girls from being

compromised. Now it is quite obvious that if a girl
is going to get herself compromised she can get it
done by 1:30 (or 10:30 or 3 in the afternoon) as well
as by 2:30. Anyone who contends otherwise is re
fusing to face the facts.
For years, the women of Stanford stayed out until
2and I feel certain that their morals were no
lower than those of our present-day Farm girls.
And their grades didn't suffer as a result of staying
out that extra hour.
But of course there is no sense in condemning the
present system unless there are some arguments
against it. There are.
If a girl wants to go up to the City dancing on
occasion, she finds that she has to leave long before
the evening is over in order to get back down here
at 1:30. The orchestras quit playing at 1 and getting
down here in half an hour is mighty low flying. Of
course, she could leave earlier, but when that hap
pens very often the inclination is to stay down here
and go to a local pub and guzzle instead of heading
for the Cily at all.
Most parties that are given off-campus last until
around 1. Most people aren't ready to quit partying
at midnight but at 1 the majority are. If they are
any distance from campus at all, it again involves
some fast risky driving to get here. And believe me,
people will stay late and drive faster coming home
more often than they will leave early and drive
slow. It's human nature and all the regulations that
are passed won't change it.
Maybe I am giving Stanford women more credit
for good sense and intelligence than they deserve,
but it seems to me that by the time a girl is college
age if she doesn't know light from wrong and isn't
able to lake care of herself, then all the l:3o's in the
quarter aren't going to make much difference.
When a girl shows that she can't be trusted with
the responsibility of getting home at a reasonable
hour or staying at home to study when she should,
then is the time to clamp down on her. But why
penalize all of them?
Why keep this allegedly wartime measure? Are
Stanford's women too infantile to be trusted with an
occasional extra hour of late leave or are they mature
enough to be treated like the women of other col
leges?
