## QUAD-SIDE 
### 
A few left-overs, a bit from (ho weekend, then up
to date.
LEFT-OVER is this (he way Jean Burnet gave it
lo me: "Meredith Dunlap of Guthrie was pleasantly

surprised the other evening in the
Cellar when a guy got up from a
booth and with the proper amount
jf flourish presented her with a
-•ailing card, turned on his heel,
then sat down with his friends.
John VV. Croul,' the card said,
and written on the back was a
'ote of confidence, 'We all agree
you're a nice kid.'" A comment
in what—complexity of women or
jurrent competition?
Jim Kessle, ex - Excommer,
I .present resident adviser at the
A.T.O. liou.se, is not piddling with

campus politics as he used to. No longer a wheel of
hncina 3rd floor east or upper Row, Jim is now con
cerned with the big rough world where they play
for keeps. He spent the vacation as a delegate to the
Republican Central Committee convention in Sacra
mento.

Speaking ol politics, here's a candid comment from
a professor long known for objectivity and dark
glasses. The trouble with this school, he says in ef
fect, is that the old wheels and the old 8.M.0.C.'s
don't realize they're out-of-date retreads; we've got
a brand new set of wheels now.
One from the WEEKEND is that Bob Gallagher
of Sigma Nu and Mary Cutler of Lathrop House must
have been in a hurry to get to the U.C.L.A. campus.
They got off the Daylight in Glendale and climbed in
a cab. Bob, who is from New Jersey, got a lesson in
L.A. geography by listening to the cab meter sound
like a buzz saw.
BLACKWELL'S CORNER, 3 P.M., SUNDAY
LAST: Three northbound cars flying the red and
white (it looked like puce and green by then) paused,
refreshed, and talked over the game and a truck col
lision south of Bakersfield. The names: Malkah Wol
per of Jordan Rouse. Angelo Bova, Dave Cohen,
Paul Schute, Bora Hansen, all of the Village. Bill
Gearhart, Al Pande, Chuck Walters, all Row boys.
A.I and Laura Gossett (the baby stayed home), Dave
Duncan, and <i sailor hitch-hiking to Treasure Island.
