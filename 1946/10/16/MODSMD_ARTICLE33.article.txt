Presenting the story of the U.S.
Merchant Marine at war, the movie
tells the eventful voyage of the
Hannibal Victory from San Fran
cisco to the Philippines with 10.000
tons of war cargo. The merchant
ship ran alone to the mid-Pacific,
then joined a convoy to the Philip
pines. There her cargo was un
loaded under fire in time for the
final campaign which cleaned all
Japs out of the islands.
The Hannibal Victory, with a
weight of 10,800 deadweight tons,
was operated during the war for the
War Shipping Administration by
the American President Lines, Ltd.
She was named in honor of Mark
Twain's boyhood home town on the
Mississippi.
