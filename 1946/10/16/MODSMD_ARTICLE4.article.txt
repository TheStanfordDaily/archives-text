# Buss Suggests Deliberate, Slow Far Eastern Policy
## 
### 
A small Tuesday Evening Series
audience in Memorial Kail audito
rium last night heard Dr. Claude A.
Buss call for U.S. acceptance of
slow and deliberate handling of
American problems in the Far East.
The expert in Oriental affairs, now
acting professor of history at Stan
ford, pointed to the undue impa
tience among U.S. liberals over
American Far Eastern policy, par
ticularly that in Japan.
ON THE FENCE
Taking an "on the fence" analyti
cal attitude, the 42-year-old diplo
mat, author, and educator dealt
with America's problems in the Pa
cific in four sections.
Listing the number one problem
as a need for a world system with
machinery for settlement of inter
national disputes. Dr. Buss said in
effect that we live in "one world"
where European problems have Asi
atic overtones.
"Issues in the Far East can be

solved if there is a prelude of peace
in Europe," he said.
Dr. Buss ranked a need for a
rise in the standard of living for
Oriental peoples directly behind
that of a world peace organization.
TWO CONDITIONS
The former foreign service officer
told his audience that there must be
great economic aid forthcoming to
peoples of the Far East. He at
tached two conditions for the al
! lotting of economic help.
i (1) The common man must be
' benefited. (2) We must insist that
J no economic aid goes into the con
struction of military machines.
"Security" look third place on
Dr. Buss's list of American prob
lems in the Orient. He stated that
ownership of bases does not appear
the key to security in the Pacific.
"A Pacific ocean dominated by
U.S. military strength may mean
security for America but not secu
rity for other nations in the Pacific
basin. "
CONFLICTS
Treating the last problem on a
geographical basis. Dr. Buss gave
penetrating analyses of current con
flicts in China, Japan, and the Phil
ippines.
He predicted that U.S. support of
! Chiang Kai-shek will continue until
| Washington officials find overwhelm
i ing evidence calling for contrary ae-
I .ion.
Briefly reviewing the paradoxes
j in Philippine independence. Dr. Buss
discussed two U.S: congressional
bills designed to bolster Philippine
economic strength.
COMPENSATION
1 He explained that under the Tyd
ings Bill 400 million dollars will go
to the new republic as compensa
i tion for war damages if companion
j legislation, the Bell Bill, is accepted
i allowing U.S. industry to exploit
j Philippine natural resources on the
I same footing as Philippine industry.
Dr. Buss emphasized the psycho
| logical problem in the occupation
and administration of Japan. He
| said that many of the "gains" made
i by the ocupying forces exist pri
marily on paper.

A small Tuesday Evening Series
audience in Memorial Kail audito
rium last night heard Dr. Claude A.
Buss call for U.S. acceptance of
slow and deliberate handling of
American problems in the Far East.
The expert in Oriental affairs, now
acting professor of history at Stan
ford, pointed to the undue impa
tience among U.S. liberals over
American Far Eastern policy, par
ticularly that in Japan.
ON THE FENCE
Taking an "on the fence" analyti
cal attitude, the 42-year-old diplo
mat, author, and educator dealt
with America's problems in the Pa
cific in four sections.
Listing the number one problem
as a need for a world system with
machinery for settlement of inter
national disputes. Dr. Buss said in
effect that we live in "one world"
where European problems have Asi
atic overtones.
"Issues in the Far East can be

solved if there is a prelude of peace
in Europe," he said.
Dr. Buss ranked a need for a
rise in the standard of living for
Oriental peoples directly behind
that of a world peace organization.
TWO CONDITIONS
The former foreign service officer
told his audience that there must be
great economic aid forthcoming to
peoples of the Far East. He at
tached two conditions for the al
! lotting of economic help.
i (1) The common man must be
' benefited. (2) We must insist that
J no economic aid goes into the con
struction of military machines.
"Security" look third place on
Dr. Buss's list of American prob
lems in the Orient. He stated that
ownership of bases does not appear
the key to security in the Pacific.
"A Pacific ocean dominated by
U.S. military strength may mean
security for America but not secu
rity for other nations in the Pacific
basin. "
CONFLICTS
Treating the last problem on a
geographical basis. Dr. Buss gave
penetrating analyses of current con
flicts in China, Japan, and the Phil
ippines.
He predicted that U.S. support of
! Chiang Kai-shek will continue until
| Washington officials find overwhelm
i ing evidence calling for contrary ae-
I .ion.
Briefly reviewing the paradoxes
j in Philippine independence. Dr. Buss
discussed two U.S: congressional
bills designed to bolster Philippine
economic strength.
COMPENSATION
1 He explained that under the Tyd
ings Bill 400 million dollars will go
to the new republic as compensa
i tion for war damages if companion
j legislation, the Bell Bill, is accepted
i allowing U.S. industry to exploit
j Philippine natural resources on the
I same footing as Philippine industry.
Dr. Buss emphasized the psycho
| logical problem in the occupation
and administration of Japan. He
| said that many of the "gains" made
i by the ocupying forces exist pri
marily on paper.
