## Card Stunts

Chances are that most of us
'round campus have heard enough
about Uclans Case and Rossi —
probably more than we ever wanted
to hear about them —but you can't
laugh them off so easily.
Cal (short for Cal) Rossi, now a
junior at UCLA, will be back next
football season when the Bruins
play the Indians in the Stanford
Stadium; Case, who is a senior, will
not return, thank heaven.
The southpaw slinger and
kicker, shifty and tricky Rossi,
looks deceptively unsuitcd for
football when he's out of his grid
iron uniform, he is 5 feet 10
inches (all and weighs only 175
pounds, below average for foot
ballers on the collegiate level.
Speedy Rossi went to rival USC
after high school, then eiTtered the
Navy and was stationed at UCLA
under the training program. He
liked the campus a lot, and Coach
Laßrucherie showed so much lov
ing interest in him, that he decided
there and then to head Westwood
way after his discharge. And the
way things look, he's pretty well
set, and not in the least considering
a change of alma mater. C'est la
guerre.

The American Olympic Ski trials
have been set for March next year,
and in case you didn't know it, we
have a man on campus who is virtu
ally certain to cop a spot on the
team that will represent America
in the Winter Olympics to be held
at St. Moritz, Switzerland.
lie is Stanford ski team captain
Boh Blatt, older brother of ski
club president "Boots" Blatt. Bob
not only made quite a name for
himself and Stanford before the
war. hut he really went to town
last winter in Europe when he
spark-plugged the USFA and
USFET ski teams to some top
notch victories over highly rated
European skiers and other service
teams.
Can't remember that any Stanford
rough ever made a U.S. Winter
Olympic squad, so it'll be nice to
have one, especially if he's as good
as Bobbie Blatt.
In spite of the fact that I don't
like Rally Corn's pre-game stickers
football when he's out of his grid
headlight lenses are si ill covered
with mashed potatoes—it seems rea
sonably safe to suggest that we
"Lasso the Bronco" this week-end,
tie them up securely, and return
them to Santa Clara via parcel post,
sealed and C.O.D. On second
thought, I'll even pay the freight
charges.

The California Fish and Game
Commission announced that- the
state bear hunting season officially
opened yesterday, and that the bag
ging of bears will be legal until De
cember 31.
What a break for Marchie's boys
to know that they'll be within the
law, comes the big date with Ber
keley next month.
The bulletin further states that
the bears may be killed legally only
through the use of firearms or bows
and arrows. Still within the law,
sez I; bows and arrows fall within
the category of weapons used by
the Indian.
This little jewel from Sacramento
continues that the legal limit for the
season is two bears. Fine with us,
sez I, we only want the one at Cal.

as Bobbie Blatt.
In spite of the fact that I don't
like Rally Corn's pre-game stickers
football when he's out of his grid
headlight lenses are si ill covered
with mashed potatoes—it seems rea
sonably safe to suggest that we
"Lasso the Bronco" this week-end,
tie them up securely, and return
them to Santa Clara via parcel post,
sealed and C.O.D. On second
thought, I'll even pay the freight
charges.

The California Fish and Game
Commission announced that- the
state bear hunting season officially
opened yesterday, and that the bag
ging of bears will be legal until De
cember 31.
What a break for Marchie's boys
to know that they'll be within the
law, comes the big date with Ber
keley next month.
The bulletin further states that
the bears may be killed legally only
through the use of firearms or bows
and arrows. Still within the law,
sez I; bows and arrows fall within
the category of weapons used by
the Indian.
This little jewel from Sacramento
continues that the legal limit for the
season is two bears. Fine with us,
sez I, we only want the one at Cal.
Chances are that most of us
'round campus have heard enough
about Uclans Case and Rossi —
probably more than we ever wanted
to hear about them —but you can't
laugh them off so easily.
Cal (short for Cal) Rossi, now a
junior at UCLA, will be back next
football season when the Bruins
play the Indians in the Stanford
Stadium; Case, who is a senior, will
not return, thank heaven.
The southpaw slinger and
kicker, shifty and tricky Rossi,
looks deceptively unsuitcd for
football when he's out of his grid
iron uniform, he is 5 feet 10
inches (all and weighs only 175
pounds, below average for foot
ballers on the collegiate level.
Speedy Rossi went to rival USC
after high school, then eiTtered the
Navy and was stationed at UCLA
under the training program. He
liked the campus a lot, and Coach
Laßrucherie showed so much lov
ing interest in him, that he decided
there and then to head Westwood
way after his discharge. And the
way things look, he's pretty well
set, and not in the least considering
a change of alma mater. C'est la
guerre.

The American Olympic Ski trials
have been set for March next year,
and in case you didn't know it, we
have a man on campus who is virtu
ally certain to cop a spot on the
team that will represent America
in the Winter Olympics to be held
at St. Moritz, Switzerland.
lie is Stanford ski team captain
Boh Blatt, older brother of ski
club president "Boots" Blatt. Bob
not only made quite a name for
himself and Stanford before the
war. hut he really went to town
last winter in Europe when he
spark-plugged the USFA and
USFET ski teams to some top
notch victories over highly rated
European skiers and other service
teams.
Can't remember that any Stanford
rough ever made a U.S. Winter
Olympic squad, so it'll be nice to
have one, especially if he's as good
as Bobbie Blatt.
