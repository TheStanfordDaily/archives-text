# Schwartz Starts Drill For Krone Tilt Saturday
## 
### DON DAVIES 
Far from being discouraged by their 2G-6 loss to UCLA's [
amazing Bruins, Stanford's spirited varsity footballers returned
to the Farm Sunday vowing "It's the last one we'll lose." And
don't sell Marchie Schwartz short—they can do it.

Hoping to hop back into the win
column in a big way, the Schwartz
men are definitely out to scalp a
below-average Santa Clara outfit

j Saturday in the Stanford Stadium.
The Cards are more than just a lit—
I tie burned up about their loss down
j south and are in no mood to let-up
1 against the Broncos.
Coach Marchie gave his hoys a !
rest Monday, Itut they were back
i to the practice grind yesterday, j
and will work hard every after
noon (his week, especially stress
ing the Indians' weakness in the
passing department which in the
i Bruin game was as obvious as
squeaky shoes in church.
TEAM IN GOOD SHAPE
The squad escaped from the j
UCLA game with miscellaneous |
J minor injuries, and with the excep- |
tion of tackle Jim Cox, and center j
| Pete August, who were injured in j
, the USF tilt, the team will be at
i full strength against the Broncos.
Santa Clara's H)4(i outfit, while
a - far cry from the Santa Clara j
Sugar Bowl champions of a few
years back, is potentially a much
stronger team than their first
three games would indicate. The
Brones dropped their first two j
encounters to Fresno State and
Nevada, hut came hack last week
to edge out Portland University,
6-0. ,
PRENTICE SPKAINS ANKLE
Scouts who saw the Portland con
test were particularly impressed
with the kicking, of Bill Crowley,
who punted consistently well all af
ternoon, and was deadly accurate
with coffin corner boots.
Veteran halfback Bill Prentice se
verely sprained his ankle against
the Portlanders, but Bronc Coach
Len Casanova, who has had more
than his share of troubles this fall,
is hoping that the dependable Pren
tice will be back in the lineup by
Saturday.
Indian mentor Schwartz is not J
hesitant in stating that the Broncs
have a capable hall club, and can
always play over their heads in
the traditional Stanford game.
The Indians could profit by a les
son from recent history or recall
ing what happened to the 5 to I
favored St. Mary's Gaels against
"poor Cal" up at Berkeley last
Saturday.
Yesterday the boys started out by
working on defense against Bronco
plays. The latter part of the session
was devoted to sharpening their
own claws in the fond hope of run
ning up a few points on their own
account.
