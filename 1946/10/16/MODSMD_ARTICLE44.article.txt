WHATTAMAN MERRIMAN—That's what the L.A. Times said about fullback Lloyd Merriman (5), the
gentleman resting on his head. Merriman had just been tripped up by Bruin half Cal Rossi on the eight
yard line following a 42-yard jaunt. The burly looking lad wearing the No. 11 jersey is U.C.L.A. fullback
Jack Meyers, who is all set to pile onto Lloyd. He did. too. Incidentally, the Indians made quite an impres
sion down south. Vic Kelley, Bruin tub thumper (Don Liebendorfer's opposite number), admitted that "we'll
bring up a pretty lair ball club" for Cal. He added, "we did pretty well against a Stanford team that won't
lose another game all year." (Photo courtesy of L.A. Times)
