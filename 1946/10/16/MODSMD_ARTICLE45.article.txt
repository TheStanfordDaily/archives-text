# Harry the Cat Wins Again As Slaughter Breaks Tie
## 
### 
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Oct. 15 (UP).- The fighting St. Louis Car
dinals won the World Series today as Harry Walker knocked
home the winning run and the Redbirds choked off a ninth-inning
rally to defeat the Boston Red Sox, 4 to 3, in the seventh and final
game of the classic.

With the game squared by the
battling Boston Club in the top of
the eighth, Walker bopped a double
to left-center which sent Country
j Slaughter winging home with the
big run as a crowd of 36.143 sent up
a frenzied roar.
It was about as close, however,
as any game could have been and
a fitting climax to this 10th seven
game series. For Breclieen. who
had yielded only 11 hits in IS pre
vious innings against the Boston
bombers, was greeted by bascliits
oil the bats of the 'irst two men
who faced him in the ninth.
YORK LEADS OFF
Rudy York, whose violin-sized
bat won two games with homers,
started off with a single to left and
I Paul Campbell went in to run for
him. Bobby Doerr labeled a base
hit into left then and Campbell
stopped at second. That put the
winning run on base—and the vet
eran Pinky Higgins up.
But The Cat gave Higgins a pitch
which forced Doerr at second as
Campbell went on to third. Roy
| Partee was next and he popped foul
| to Stan Musial.
Tom Mcßridc, another pinch
hitter. grounded out, Red Schoen
dienst to Marion, and the delirious
crowd stormed down on the field
as the world champion Cardinals
carried Breclieen from the field.
This was the fourth time the Car
dinals had been in a seven-game
World Series, and they kept intact
their record of never losing one
which went the distance. And it
also was the first time the Red Sox
j had ever lost the classic, five pre
vious times Boston having come out
on top with the championship.
800 FERRIS BELTED
It was Dave (Boo) Ferriss, the big
Mississippian who copped the third
game of the series for Boston,
! against the wiry Dickson as the two

clubs went at it under the broiling
sun at Sportsman's Park. But the
battling Cards blasted 800 out of
the box in the fifth on two runs and
four hits.
Joe Dohson came in then to halt
the rally and for two more inn
ings. with little Mnrry putting ev
erything he had on the ball,
neither club scored. But they got
to the little Missourian in the
eighth, those savagely swinging
Red Sox.
Rip Russell, batting for Hal Wag
ner, came through with a single to
center and then rolled on to third
as George Metkovich pinch hit for
Dobson and whacked out a double
down the leftfield line. That was all
for Murry.
And stalking in from the bullpen
with his graceful, flowing stride
came The Cat.
The stands rocked with roars as
the fans greeted the slim, little fig
ure who twice had stopped these
Boston batters and now was coming
to the rescue with the blue chips
piled high in this playoff contest.

as George Metkovich pinch hit for
Dobson and whacked out a double
down the leftfield line. That was all
for Murry.
And stalking in from the bullpen
with his graceful, flowing stride
came The Cat.
The stands rocked with roars as
the fans greeted the slim, little fig

Boston batters and now was coming

piled high in this playoff contest.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Oct. 15 (UP).- The fighting St. Louis Car
dinals won the World Series today as Harry Walker knocked
home the winning run and the Redbirds choked off a ninth-inning
rally to defeat the Boston Red Sox, 4 to 3, in the seventh and final
game of the classic.

With the game squared by the
battling Boston Club in the top of
the eighth, Walker bopped a double
to left-center which sent Country
j Slaughter winging home with the
big run as a crowd of 36.143 sent up
a frenzied roar.
It was about as close, however,
as any game could have been and
a fitting climax to this 10th seven
game series. For Breclieen. who
had yielded only 11 hits in IS pre
vious innings against the Boston
bombers, was greeted by bascliits
oil the bats of the 'irst two men
who faced him in the ninth.
YORK LEADS OFF
Rudy York, whose violin-sized
bat won two games with homers,
started off with a single to left and
I Paul Campbell went in to run for
him. Bobby Doerr labeled a base
hit into left then and Campbell
stopped at second. That put the
winning run on base—and the vet
eran Pinky Higgins up.
But The Cat gave Higgins a pitch
which forced Doerr at second as
Campbell went on to third. Roy
| Partee was next and he popped foul
| to Stan Musial.
Tom Mcßridc, another pinch
hitter. grounded out, Red Schoen
dienst to Marion, and the delirious
crowd stormed down on the field
as the world champion Cardinals
carried Breclieen from the field.
This was the fourth time the Car
dinals had been in a seven-game
World Series, and they kept intact
their record of never losing one
which went the distance. And it
also was the first time the Red Sox
j had ever lost the classic, five pre
vious times Boston having come out
on top with the championship.
800 FERRIS BELTED
It was Dave (Boo) Ferriss, the big
Mississippian who copped the third
game of the series for Boston,
! against the wiry Dickson as the two

clubs went at it under the broiling
sun at Sportsman's Park. But the
battling Cards blasted 800 out of
the box in the fifth on two runs and
four hits.
Joe Dohson came in then to halt
the rally and for two more inn
ings. with little Mnrry putting ev
erything he had on the ball,
neither club scored. But they got
to the little Missourian in the
eighth, those savagely swinging
Red Sox.
Rip Russell, batting for Hal Wag
ner, came through with a single to
center and then rolled on to third
as George Metkovich pinch hit for
Dobson and whacked out a double
down the leftfield line. That was all
for Murry.
