# Excom Sets Re-election For Disqualified Ballots
## Electioneering Policy Discussed; Farm Radio Series May Be Given 
### 
Excom voted last night to hold the election for graduate mem
ber of Excom, Toyon representative, and the two members of
Men's Council in two weeks because of mistakes on yesterday's
ballots, handled by election board. Due to the electioneering of
a candidate, a policy that is outlawed in the constitution, mem-

bers discussed a possible remedy for - *
the absence of publication of candi
dates' qualities, and tabled the mat
ter until next week.
The mistakes in the ballots were:
One candidate for graduate mem
ber of Excom was not on the ballot;
one Toyon candidate was on the 1
Men's Row ballot; it was not indi- !
catcd on the Men's Council ballot j
that two men were to be elected.
Excom voted down a motion to
have*all ballots reviewed by Excom.
They thought the responsibility for
the ballots should be the election
board's.
ELECTIONEERING ADVOCATED
Because there was no publication
of the illegality of electioneering be
fore this election, Excom decided to i
take no action in this case. It was j
suggested that in the future, some |
means of stating qualifications and |
aims be given to the candidates.
With Excom taking it for granted
that electioneering is out. Tom Elke
made a bombastic speech urging
electioneering to get more interest
in ASSU elections. "Elections are
the most important thing in the
school," he said. "We are no longer
in our ivory tower, and no calm,
serene election will bring large
turnouts to the polls."
"GIVE IT A TRY"
He advocated giving electioneer
ing a try. A limit could be set and
enforced on campaign expenditures.
"Besides, he said, "fifty per cent or
more of the students don't have
enough money to spend to do any
harm. If a candidate puts something
down on paper and signs it, then he
has to back it up." If electioneering
cannot be established, Elke said the
Daily should devote most of one
issue to publishing statements.
Under the Amendment passed
yesterday, three members from the
Village will be elected by area in
two weeks. Village Council will set
the areas Tuesday which Excom
will vote on Wednesday. One addi
tional ofi-campus member at large
will also be elected.
BROADCASTS APPROVED
Excom gave approval to Bill Eil
ers to work on starting a series of
13 radio broadcasts from San Fran
cisco or San Jose giving a dramatic
or documentary sketch of some
phase of Stanford life. The pro- I
grams would last 15 minutes and
would be written and presented by
the students with ASSU backing.
Radio time would be free and ex
penses for script writers and trans
portation very slight.
"Since the Stanford radio station
cannot be established until far into
next quarter, this plan would give
the students a chance to show they
are responsible and can manage ra- J
dio work," Eilers said. The plan will I
be taken to the Committee on Pub- |
lie Exercises.
