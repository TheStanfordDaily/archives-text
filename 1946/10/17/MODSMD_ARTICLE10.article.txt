## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. .16 (UP).
Angered by charges of "dollar im
perialism" from Czechoslovakia and
Russia, the United States today
broke off negotiations on a Czech
request for $90,000,000 worth of
American monetary and economic
aid.
State Department officials re
vealed that discussions on a $50,-
000,000 U.S. Kxport-Import Bank
loan have been suspended and
that $10,000,000 of American sur
plus property earmarked for the
Czechs will he passed out else
where.
Abrupt cancellation of the deals
raised ibe possibility that an even
larger transact ion —Czechoslovakia's
pending request for a $350,000,000
international bank loan—may also
be imperiled.
Discussions on the $330,000,000
credit still arc in the preliminary
stage «ind Stale Department spokes
men gave no indication of their
views on it. But the United States
is the biggest contributor to the in
ternational bank through which
Czechoslovakia is trying to get that
loan and its recommendations un
doubtedly would weigh heavily in
the final decision.
Department officials made it
plain that the deals were broken
off because of the anti-American
statements made in the Soviet and
Czech press and by spokesmen
for those two countries at the
Paris Peace Conference.
