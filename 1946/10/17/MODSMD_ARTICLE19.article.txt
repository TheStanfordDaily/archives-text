# New Chappie Forges Ahead
## 
### 
Close - printed, slick - paged, the
Stanford Chaparral, long-time hair
infester of many a Stanford ward
boss, has finally sprung its shackles
and is on its way to the waiting
public.
New low price: twenty-five cents.
SCINTILLATING MAG
Th" scintillating publication will
be available for exam-weary, laugh
hungry Stanfordi 1 ettantcs on Wed
nesday. Oct. 23, at five prominent
places on Quad.
Also prominent, though less sta
ble, is saturnine, dynamic Business
Manager Boris Wolper. In a state
ment to the press he snapped:
"Maya. Shmaya â€” Buya Chaparral!
We're late coming out because we've
been translating some of the gags
from old Mayan tablet.s. The origi
nal gag-book, now choking up
presses, will cost ten rocks. A
Chappie's only a quarter. Wotta
bargain!"
MAYAN GAGS
No bargain himself, Editor-in
chicFrank Hewitt sportingly re
gards the Mayan competition. "Our
gag men go back to Neanderthal Man
for their jokes. Wo got no worries."
Meanwhile, beetle-browed, turbu
lent Stan Shpetner and hawk-faced,
lupine Al NovikofT weep on each
other's shoulders. "Who's this guy
Rossi?" they blubber.
