To the ftditoi:
.teim-nts made in "History 1940" - Daily, Oct.
14. I ii. to Ha effect that AVC supported an in
ri, i uL-istencv payments because "the veteran
;>« t In as long as everyone else is getting
without regard to the effect of the proposi
lion ii ihe national economy," it will be noted by
the who attended the discussion last week and/or
rho t ,vh«i read carefully the article in the Daily
foi tin meeting that, the statements made by
Mr i. rlon certainly do no! if fieri the attitude taken
by AVC.
V."' -1 onomic effect on the nation was discussed
tho. oi • lily, and, as Professor Mandelbaum pointed,
o : ti . raise would not tend to be inflationary.
The following are two of the most outstanding

arguments presented favoring the proposed raise:
(1) Because living costs are continually rising, Ihe
present subsistence allowance soon will not lie suf
ficient to cover the cost of room and hoard alone.
(2) Facts obtained from a recent survey taken in
(,'hicago show the average minimum cost of living
for an unmarried vet attending school in he slightly
greater than $100 per month.
Even alter theSe arguments were presented, a
motion ihat the Stanford chapter appose an increase
in subsistence payments was defeated by only five
votes. The motion that was finally approved by the
group reads, in pait- "that we support an increase
until the government takes effective action to
prevent the present cost of firing- from rising "
Sincerely yours.,

Dear Hal.
In the first place, th n Daily':, report of the last
AVC meeting quotes Professor Mandelbaum as fol
lows' "He pointed out that inflation, as defined, is
already here, that it is the people on fixed wage in
comes who always : ufler, and that in the overall
picture the estimated increase m money paid out
($400.000, uuo) would come to but one fourth of 1 per
cent of the national income In my opinion, this
boils down to "the veteran should get his as long as
everyone else is getting theirs."
In the second place, your version of the rest of
my comment, amounts to a misquotation. What I
wrote was, "Without regard to the effect of the prop
osition on the national economy, the attitude does not
to me exactly consistent with the AVC's famous
motto, '('itizens first, veterans second'."
My conclusion on the AV(' was, "Hut certainly
they are no woise than any other veterans' organi
zation." Do you contest that 7
Sincerely,
Ted Norton
