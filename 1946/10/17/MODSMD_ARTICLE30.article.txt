## BULL SESSION 
### 
Something has got to bo done about Litis laundry
situation, I haven't been able to send any out, since
the beginning of the quarter. Nobody will take it.
1 very tim" I open tny closet now 1 am buried in
n 1 > ap ut dirty clothes and it takes me at least 15
min u Us to dig my way out. Missed dinner the
other nit.lil. Ye.-.terday 1 went to three classes before
I di st ovi red a pair of dirty socks drap«d gracefully
ovc i my left ear.
112 Miinethhig doesn't happen soon I am going to
have to-start appearing on Quad in a pair of Ye
Daintie 'Ihow-away Diapers. I can't send my
laundry home. iVloiher cut her hand on a beer
' ;• >!•»• ut the beginning of the quarter and can't
take ii any more wash for u while. Besides, so
mif. ii blindly is now going through the P.O. thai
th. y are considering futtinp in a wringer instead
e>! a door.
Yt it niay afternoon, 1 went downtown to plead
wit: the plutocrats of the local wash concerns to
• il they would break down and take my laundry.
J' l place 1 hit there was a man standing behind
the counter pulling the buttons off a pair of shorts.
• you the manager?" I asked.
'o lie said, reaching for another pair of shorts,
"I in i!m- Official Button Puller-Offer. And I'm also
Fii t A'st Shirt Ripper." He l ipped a shirt to'dem
onstrate for me.
i i-' lively done," I admitted, "hut T'd like fo sre
the manager."
iiis secretary i:; over there," he pointed out.
' ihe scorned me when she discovered 1 didn't
have an appointment, but 1 talked her into letting
.ie in in see him for a minute. Then I stopped lick -
n g her hand and got off my knees.
A laxge gong sounded and I was ushered into
:t large, vast room, full of the scent of incense. The
Hoots were plush-carpeted ami heavy diapes cov
< n d (he walls. At the far end of the dimly lit room

the manager lounged with his feet on a tremen
dous mahogany desk, smoking an expensive cigar.
He pointed at me. "Speak," he commanded.
"Oh, sir," 1 said, "would your organization do my
laundry?"
"How much is there?" lie demanded.
"One shirt, one handkerchief, one pair of .shorts,
and one pair <>l socks every three weeks," I said
hopefully.
"Never," he roared.
"One handkerchief?" 1 pleaded
"What size?'" he asked.
"8 x 7," 1 said.
"Sony, no new customers," he said, and two giant
Nubian slaves dragged me away.
The next place 1 went to, I had to go up to Bay
Meadows to find the manager. 1 found him at the
thousand - dollar window betting on 200-1 shots.
Drawing tny towel closer around nie, I approached
him.
Touched by my shivering plight, he promised me
that his concern would do my laundry and on a
rush basis, too. They would have it back by early
December, J94b. 1 told him I couldn't wail, and
• talked out, ignoring the stable boy who was trying
to throw a blanket oil nie and enter me in the third
race
So that'i my plight lam reduced to selling my
dirty clothes to IVlose and buying new ones at Roos.
But diminishing marginal utility is crushing me.
I don't break even.
They won't let me in the rooting section any more
because all my white shirts are tattle-tale gray
What eari I do?
If each girl would do the laundry for her 2 7,
things Would work out nicely. Only trouble is I've
go! enough for 7 I it would lake at least three
girls.
II someone wants to volunteer, you can find me
on the Quad. I'm the guy wearing the laundry bag
