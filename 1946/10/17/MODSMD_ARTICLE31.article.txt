STRIKE TVVO
Ji I'illsburgh a union leader was sentenced to a
y-ar in jail because his workers went, on strike de
riving the city of light. Nobody is sending meat
packers and cattle ranchers to jail.
Vhonever workers go on strike they are de
);<;uii--ed roundly for putting their interests ahead of
i hp j,:jb 1 i«• Bui when the cattle farmers go on strike
- -are they denounced?
Y< I. Department of figures show that in
i l ' j i t year real wages have decreased 10 per cent:
in 1£45 the average family of four in the manu
t.iiiHing industries had weekly take-home pay of
Vl3 il in terms ol' 193H prices $33.47. A year later
tt'O same family gets $42.. r >B or just over thirty dol
lar in 1939 terms.
At the same time the profits in the meat business
Juive continued to be considerably above the highest
prewar years. The family of the typical cattle farmer
has been getting a lot more than $30 a week.
lo deprive the entire nation of meat week after
week seems certainly as much of a crime as turning
out a city s lights tor a day. But this does not appear
lo t ■other the Messrs. Knowland, Taft, Stassen, Reece
Mid 'heir supporters in the press. According to them
it i certainly not public spirited for labor lo strike
for a little higher wages, but there is nothing wrong
m strikes for higher profits. After all, cattle ranchers

and meat packers arc- business men. 112 ,e| them dictate
their own terms and our famous 110 per cent Ameri
can system of "free" enterprise will straighten out all
problem*.
Write.s Sen. Knowland, California's Republican
candidate lor the Senate, whose family publishes the
Oakland Tribune, and who is one of the men most re
sponsible for the higher prices you pay:
"When the 80th Congress meets 1 shall vote to
abolish OPA controls on agricultural products as
well as on consumer and durable goods."
Joe Q. Public already has two strikes against
himself: lirsl a coalition of reactionary politicians
made ettective price control impossible and h° had
to watch helplessly while their friend:-, grabbed the
money coming from his none-too-lull pocket.
Strike two is now being called as .Joe is told th;il
all shortages and higher prices are due solely to
New Deal bureaucracy. That's adding insult to in
jury.
Strike three might come the first Tuesday in No
vember when Joe will be asked to turn the govern
ment over to the men whose sole claim to fame is the
wreckage of OPA and their excellent job in making
certain that veterans can't get houses.
These men might win in November. They will
put us on tho road to sound, safe normalcy as they
did in 1920. There i.-, no rainbow at tlx-- end of lh.it
road but the atomic age model of 192!).

Joe Q. Public already has two strikes against
himself: lirsl a coalition of reactionary politicians
made ettective price control impossible and h° had
to watch helplessly while their friend:-, grabbed the
money coming from his none-too-lull pocket.
Strike two is now being called as .Joe is told th;il
all shortages and higher prices are due solely to
New Deal bureaucracy. That's adding insult to in
jury.
Strike three might come the first Tuesday in No
vember when Joe will be asked to turn the govern
ment over to the men whose sole claim to fame is the
wreckage of OPA and their excellent job in making
certain that veterans can't get houses.
These men might win in November. They will

Ji I'illsburgh a union leader was sentenced to a

in 1£45 the average family of four in the manu

At the same time the profits in the meat business
Juive continued to be considerably above the highest
prewar years. The family of the typical cattle farmer
has been getting a lot more than $30 a week.
lo deprive the entire nation of meat week after

out a city s lights tor a day. But this does not appear
lo t ■other the Messrs. Knowland, Taft, Stassen, Reece
Mid 'heir supporters in the press. According to them
it i certainly not public spirited for labor lo strike
for a little higher wages, but there is nothing wrong
