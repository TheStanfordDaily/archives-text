# Brenda Helser Aims For Olympic Games In 1948
## 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
"Are you Dan Endsley?" I nodded. And that's the way it all started. Brenda Helser is a mod
erately tall young lady, with dark hair, a swell complexion, and big brown eyes. A peach.

Her swimming exploits are com
mon knowledge, so I'll skip over
them. But the future is something
else. She lias her eyes glued on
the I IMS Olympics. During the
time she's hcen swimming the
Olympic Games have been pass
ed up twice, due to the exigencies
of war.
It's quite a feat to make the
Olympic team, you know. Past rec
ords don't count—everything de
pends on just one trial. You might
he the greatest swimmer in the
world, hut if you happen to have a
stomachache on the wrong day and
go unplaced, you're out.
I{i<! Brenda is fortunate in that
three of her events (she's a sprin
ter) are also Olympic events, so
she has three chances. My money
is on the girl to place in all three.
This little girl has been swimming
.since she was old enough to wade,
and she's got a closet full of cups
and trophies to prove it. She be
came a swimmer because—of all
things she was afraid of horses as
a child. Her, parents loved horses,
but she couldn't stand them. So
• he took up swimming to save the
family honor as sportsmen.
Her greatest short-range ambi
tion? She wants to bring the Am
erican women's 100-yard free
style record (held b,> Brenda Hel
ser) down to within five seconds
of the men's record (held by
Johnny Weismuller). And there's
a line chance she will, because
last year Johnny himself took
time to teach her a better stroke.
Science enters into swimming just
as everything else. The object is to
get the maximum propulsion out of
a minimum of effort. Weismuller
solvtffll the.problem years ago, but
rio one ever copied his style—the
"experts" just called him a freak.
But Brenda is an apt pupil, and she's
already cut three seconds off her
time in the hundred—which is phe
nomenal, at least.
Brenda used to swim for the
Multnomah Club is Portland, and
all baseball fans know that the
Portland Beavers have a pitcher
named Roy Helser. Naturally I
asked her if they were related.
"Oh. everyone asks me that," she
smiles, making me feel very un
original indeed.
It seems that one night after a
swimming meet a drunk stumbled
up to her. "Shay," he says. "Are
you Roy Helser's shishter?" No,
she's not. "Hish coushin?" No, no
relation at all. "Damn it!" he says,
"You jusht cosht me 25 bucks!"
Of course every interviewer has
to ask a sports star what her
greatest thrill was. "Ilmmm, I
think beating Ann Curtis in the
100 last year. It's not my race, but
my time was better than hers."
That, naturally, leads into the
celebrated and highly publicized
"feud" between the two mermaids.
Il seems that it is nothing but news
paper stuff. Even their coaches be
lieve it and keep them apart as
much as possible.
But the girls pulled a fast one
at the last Nationals. As usual,
the }jirls were kept apart during
the meet—but the only showers
were community affairs. Ann and
Brenda used to meet in the show
ers at about II p.m. and have
long—and friendly—conversations.
And nobody was ever the wiser,
and the newspaper "feud" goes
merrily on.
" Brerida was born right here on
the Stanford campus. She left school
in '4.''# but is back now and plans to
.stiik it out until she graduates. She
hope to manage that little trick be
fore the Olympics, although she's

only a sophomore. There's hard
work ahead.
Her ambition is to be an actress,
and she's already made strides in
that direction. I have seen the pirl.
Esther Williams, look out!
I could write on and on about
beauteous Brenda; she's easy to
look at and easy to writr about,
llul I have to yo home and study. . .

stomachache on the wrong day and

I{i<! Brenda is fortunate in that
three of her events (she's a sprin
ter) are also Olympic events, so
she has three chances. My money
is on the girl to place in all three.
This little girl has been swimming
.since she was old enough to wade,
and she's got a closet full of cups
and trophies to prove it. She be
came a swimmer because—of all
things she was afraid of horses as
a child. Her, parents loved horses,
but she couldn't stand them. So
• he took up swimming to save the
family honor as sportsmen.
Her greatest short-range ambi
tion? She wants to bring the Am
erican women's 100-yard free
style record (held b,> Brenda Hel
ser) down to within five seconds
of the men's record (held by
Johnny Weismuller). And there's
a line chance she will, because
last year Johnny himself took
time to teach her a better stroke.
Science enters into swimming just
as everything else. The object is to
get the maximum propulsion out of
a minimum of effort. Weismuller
solvtffll the.problem years ago, but
rio one ever copied his style—the
"experts" just called him a freak.
But Brenda is an apt pupil, and she's
already cut three seconds off her
time in the hundred—which is phe
nomenal, at least.
Brenda used to swim for the
Multnomah Club is Portland, and
all baseball fans know that the
Portland Beavers have a pitcher
named Roy Helser. Naturally I
asked her if they were related.
"Oh. everyone asks me that," she
smiles, making me feel very un
original indeed.
It seems that one night after a
swimming meet a drunk stumbled
up to her. "Shay," he says. "Are
you Roy Helser's shishter?" No,
she's not. "Hish coushin?" No, no
relation at all. "Damn it!" he says,
"You jusht cosht me 25 bucks!"
Of course every interviewer has
to ask a sports star what her
greatest thrill was. "Ilmmm, I
think beating Ann Curtis in the
100 last year. It's not my race, but
my time was better than hers."
That, naturally, leads into the
celebrated and highly publicized
"feud" between the two mermaids.
Il seems that it is nothing but news
paper stuff. Even their coaches be
lieve it and keep them apart as
much as possible.
But the girls pulled a fast one
at the last Nationals. As usual,
the }jirls were kept apart during
the meet—but the only showers
were community affairs. Ann and
Brenda used to meet in the show
ers at about II p.m. and have
long—and friendly—conversations.
And nobody was ever the wiser,
and the newspaper "feud" goes
merrily on.
" Brerida was born right here on
the Stanford campus. She left school
in '4.''# but is back now and plans to
.stiik it out until she graduates. She
hope to manage that little trick be
fore the Olympics, although she's

only a sophomore. There's hard
work ahead.
Her ambition is to be an actress,
and she's already made strides in
that direction. I have seen the pirl.

style record (held b,> Brenda Hel

of the men's record (held by
Johnny Weismuller). And there's
a line chance she will, because
last year Johnny himself took
time to teach her a better stroke.
Science enters into swimming just
as everything else. The object is to
get the maximum propulsion out of
a minimum of effort. Weismuller

already cut three seconds off her
time in the hundred—which is phe
nomenal, at least.
Brenda used to swim for the
Multnomah Club is Portland, and
all baseball fans know that the
Portland Beavers have a pitcher
named Roy Helser. Naturally I
asked her if they were related.
"Oh. everyone asks me that," she
smiles, making me feel very un
original indeed.
It seems that one night after a
swimming meet a drunk stumbled
up to her. "Shay," he says. "Are
you Roy Helser's shishter?" No,
she's not. "Hish coushin?" No, no
relation at all. "Damn it!" he says,
"You jusht cosht me 25 bucks!"
Of course every interviewer has
to ask a sports star what her
greatest thrill was. "Ilmmm, I
think beating Ann Curtis in the
100 last year. It's not my race, but
my time was better than hers."

long—and friendly—conversations.

merrily on.

"Are you Dan Endsley?" I nodded. And that's the way it all started. Brenda Helser is a mod
erately tall young lady, with dark hair, a swell complexion, and big brown eyes. A peach.

Her swimming exploits are com
mon knowledge, so I'll skip over
them. But the future is something
else. She lias her eyes glued on
the I IMS Olympics. During the
time she's hcen swimming the
Olympic Games have been pass
ed up twice, due to the exigencies
of war.
It's quite a feat to make the
Olympic team, you know. Past rec
ords don't count—everything de
pends on just one trial. You might
he the greatest swimmer in the
world, hut if you happen to have a
stomachache on the wrong day and
go unplaced, you're out.
I{i<! Brenda is fortunate in that
three of her events (she's a sprin
ter) are also Olympic events, so
she has three chances. My money
is on the girl to place in all three.
This little girl has been swimming
.since she was old enough to wade,
and she's got a closet full of cups
and trophies to prove it. She be
came a swimmer because—of all
things she was afraid of horses as
a child. Her, parents loved horses,
but she couldn't stand them. So
• he took up swimming to save the
family honor as sportsmen.
Her greatest short-range ambi
tion? She wants to bring the Am
erican women's 100-yard free
style record (held b,> Brenda Hel
ser) down to within five seconds
of the men's record (held by
Johnny Weismuller). And there's
a line chance she will, because
