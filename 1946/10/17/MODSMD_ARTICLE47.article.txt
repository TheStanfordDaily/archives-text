# Road a Little Humpy For Big Red Machine
## 
### DON DAVIES 
Marchie Schwartz' Big Red Ma
chine looked like a Model-T out of
gas yesterday afternoon in a prac
tice scrimmage with the Jayvees.
The small but alert Jayvee line was
breaking up play after play, and
Schwartz 1 boys can be thankful that
it was only their little cousins who
were doing the breaking up, and
not Santa Clara's Broncos.
Passing offense was again
stressed, but the Indians' air at
tack still looks more than just a
little weak. Only a handful of the
many passes thrown during the
practice session were completed.
One bright spot, however, was
Babe Biggins' snagging of several
long ones thrown by Ainslce Bell.
Babe is the end who caught that
long pass from Frank Forbes in
the last quarter of the UCLA
game.
Schwartz has two more drills
scheduled this week before Satur
day's game with Santa Clara. Pass
ing will be stressed both today and
tomorrow, but unless Coach Mar
chie can come up with a Dixie How
ell and a Don Hutson, the Cards will
have to stick pretty close to the
ground.
Despite the fact that the Santa
Clarans will go into Saturday's
contest as decided underdogs,
they are capable of upsetting the
Indians' big plans. You only have
to look into the records to see
how the Broncs have on occasion
risen to great heights against
heavily favored teams Irom the
Farm,
The 19M4 Vow Boys, who were
destined to go on to a Rose Bowl
victory over undefeated Southern
Methodist, were held to a 7-7 tie
by a heads-up Bronco outfit. Again
in 1940. the undefeated, untied Rose-
Bowl champions had to be satisfied
with a slim 7-6 win over Hie Broncs.
The rivalry between the two
schools dates back to a rugby con
test in 1914, when Stanford de
feated Santa Clara. 111-0. The first
American football game in 191!).
saw the Indians on top again. 13-
0. Stanford has won 15 of the 23
games played since 1919: Santa
Clara has won 7, and the 1934
contest ended in a tie. In the to
tal points scored department, the

Cardinals hold a 3915 to 220 edge.
The last game, before both schools
dropped the grid sport for the dura
tion, was in 1942, with the Broncos
upsetting a favored Stanford team,
14-6.
The kickoff for Saturday's game
in the stjdium is set for 2:30.
