# Farm Scribe Contributes Sports Article to Harpers

### BUZZ LOBDELL 
If you happen to thumb through
this month's edition of Harper s
Magazine, you will notice an article
called "West Coast Baseball: Too
Bin for Its Britches," by Dan EncLs
ley. This observation is o{ interest
to Stanford students because the
author of the piece is the same Mr.
Endsley who devotes much of his
spare time to writing sports for the
Stanford Daily.
The ex-aerial gunner who "likes
girls in green sweaters"—and is a
dyed-in-the-wool sports addict —
enrolled at Stanford in January,
1946, after four years in the Navy.
But let's follow his career after he
graduated from Fremont High in
Oakland. Immediately after gradu
ation he became sports editor of the
East Oakland News, an advertising
journal.
His job lasted for one issue, after
which he promptly got fired. It was
a case of being too good. The pub
lisher thought the excellent sports
coverage would outshine the ad
vertising and Dan was out of a job.
ENROLLS AT WESTWOOD
Deciding that college would be

the answer, Dan went down to
Westwood and enrolled at U.C.L.A.
As war threatened he joined the
RCAF but after Dec. 7 he trans
ferred into the Navy.
Upon discharge he settled down
on the Farm in pursuit of a degree
in journalism. His interest in base
ball coupled with the growing clam
or for a third major league led him
to write the story that was eventu
ally accepted by Harper's.
GRAHAM HELPS
During the process of writing the
story Endsley was greatly assisted
by Charley Graham, owner of the
San Francisco Seals, and Sam Brea
don. head man of the St. Louis Car
dinals.
When the black-haired, 26-year
old Endsley was asked how it felt
to crash the big time in sports re
porting, he stated that "the accept
ance of my story is only the first
vague preliminary step to success.
There is a lot of hard work ahead."

GRAHAM HELPS
During the process of writing the
story Endsley was greatly assisted
by Charley Graham, owner of the
San Francisco Seals, and Sam Brea
don. head man of the St. Louis Car
dinals.
When the black-haired, 26-year
old Endsley was asked how it felt
to crash the big time in sports re
porting, he stated that "the accept
ance of my story is only the first
vague preliminary step to success.
There is a lot of hard work ahead."
