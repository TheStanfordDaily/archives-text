# New Magazine Needs Articles
## 
### 
A new type of magazine, in which
anyone may express his opinion on
any controversial question, is in the
planning stage. The magazine will
make its debut under the name of
"Controversy."
A non-profit organization, "Con
troversy" will be financed by the
authors of the printed articles at
the rate of lVa cents per word.
"Controversy" will cater to the
new writer; but no one will be de
nied space, and anonymously writ
ten articles will be accepted.
The publishers, Charles Hirsch
mann and Maurice Loevner, are now
accepting manuscripts for the ini
tial issue. Further information may
be obtained by writing "Contro
versy," 516 North St. Clair Street,
Pittsburgh 6, Pennsylvania.
