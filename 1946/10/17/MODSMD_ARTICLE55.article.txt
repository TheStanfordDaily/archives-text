# Winter Social Calendar Open
## 
### 
Reg dance applications for winter
quarter will close â€¢ Wednesday, ac
cording to A.S.S.U. Vice-President
Millie Edwards, who urged that or
j ganizations needing financial aid
! apply.
The junior class sponsored two
| dances at the opening of this quar
j tor; Theta Sigma Phi and Sigma
j Delta Chi were awarded the spring
j quarter dance last year.
I Choice among applications will be
| based on financial need and the
plans submitted for handling the
I dance. Miss Edwards judges the
j dance to be one of the best-attended
of each quarter, since it is open to
the entire student body.
Social calendar for the quarter is
| jammed with small and closed
j dances, but includes few all-campus
j affairs, according to Miss Edwards.
: In order to relieve the crowd that
usually gravitates to an open house
or open dance, she recommends that
three or more be offered on each
occasion. Houses could agree among
themselves as to what weekend they
j would like to offer a full program
j of open dances to the campus.
