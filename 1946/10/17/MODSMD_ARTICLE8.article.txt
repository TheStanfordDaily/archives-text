## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. Hi (UP). —OPA announced tonight that price ceil
ings " ill he removed tomorrow on a long list of edible oils, Including
margarine, shortening, mayonnaise, salad dressing and cooking and salad
oils.
It was the first major decontrol directive by the agency since President

Truman issued his meat decontrol
order Monday night, and called for
a speed-up of the entile process of
eliminating governmental price reg
ulations wherever possible.
OPA said the oils were being
taken off the controlled list be
cause of the removal of ceilings
on livestock and all its byprod
ucts. It explained that the price
relationship between lard and the
vegetable oils would be too dis
torted if the controls remained.
OPA RAPS TRUMAN
Meanwhile, OPA'.s Consumers'
Advisory Committee took a sharp
rap at President Truman's action in
removing meat ceilings.
The committee, on" of several
such groups created by OPA, said
the action was "a body blow to the
consumer" and blamed the Presi
dent's move on "pressure by power
ful economic interests."
It urged consumers throughout
the country to organize boycotts
against foods and any other prod
ucts whose prices rise "unreason
ably," and to help OPA maintain
its surviving price controls, espe
cially on rents and building ma
terials.
CHICAGO, Oct. 16 (UP).—Farm
ers flooded the major markets with
hogs today, less than 24 hours after
removal of price ceilings, and prices
dropped from yesterday's all-time
highs.
PRICES RISE
Cattle prices, however, rose to
new heights, hitting $35.25 for top
steers and yearlings at Chicago, the
highest price in the history of the
livestock industry. They hit an all
time high of $2(> a hundredweight,
at. Oklahoma City and $30 at South
St. Paul.
Farmers seeking the boom
prices shipped at least 150,000
hogs to market, some of which
were described as underweight.
Despite the sharp increase in
farm -to - market shipments, there
still was little fresh meat on the
nation's butcher counters. House
wives did not quibble about the
price of the limited supplies of meat
they could find and some scattered
shops were reported doing a rush
ing business at prices ranging from
the old OPA ceiling to as high as
three times as much.
BREAK EXPECTED
There were indications that a
break might be coming in the hog
market. Some big packets were re
ported holding <>(T, waiting for prices
to drop further. In lowa, many buy
ers were refusing to buy hogs at
pries asked, and others wre bid
ding $3 lower.
