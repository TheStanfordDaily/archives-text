# Redskins Clash Saturday With Underdog Broncos
## 
### DON DAVIES 
"Santa Clara's Broncos or Santa Clara's Buncoes; Stanford's Champs
or Stanford's Chumps?" So read the lend of a San Francisco sports story
back in 1034 before the Vow Boys' important game with an underdog
Santa Clara team. The answer to the question was left in doubt as the
teams battled to a 7-7 tie.
But times have changed; and tomorrow Coach Marchio Schwartz's

Stanford footballers will again try 1
to find the right answer to this
question. Again the Indians arc
odds -on favorites, but tomorrow, J
just as in 1934, anything can hap- I
pen. Coach Marchie says, "In a tra
ditional game like this, it is hard ■
to say what the outcome will be." ;
Coach Charlie Wakefield, who
tinned in a good performance
down south last weekend, has i
been named game captain for to
morrow's contest. Almost (he i
same team that started against the
Bruins will get the call tomor
row.
The probable Stanford starting j
lineup will be as follows: left end, I
Dave DeSwarte; left tackle, Fred j
Bocnsch; left guard, Bill Hachten;
center, Dick Flatland; right guard.
Harv Bernhard; light tackle, Cap
lain Charlie Wakefield; right end,
Bob Ii all; quarterback, Buck
Brownson; left half, Don Zappct
tini; right half, George Quist; and
Lloyd Merriman at fullback.
ZAPI'ETTINI WILL START
The only change in this lineup
from last week is at the left half
spot, where Don Zappettini will be
starting for the first tim'j. Z;ip,
who has had trouble with his leg
this fall, will be in top shape for
tomorrow's game.
Schwartz put liis boys through
a heavy workout yesterday,
stressing defense as well as pass
ing. The Indians will go through
a lie lit drill this afternoon, run
ning; through some of their new
plays and working on their still
weak passing attack.
Assistant Coach Mai Elward has
scouted the Broncos' first three
games and carefully diagrammed
their plays. With the aid of El
ward's painstaking reports, Schwartz
has been able to give the team plen
ty of work against the Santa Clara
offense.
Physically, the Cards arc in
good shape. Lloyd Merriman, the
Farm's trump card, is ready to do
some of his best running tomor
row, as is big. powerful George
Quist. Quarterback Buck Brown
son can be the key to Stanford
success if he can develop a fair
degree of accuracy with his pass
ing.
LINE READY, BENGTSON SAYS
Line Coach Phil Bengtson reports \
that his big and rough forward wall
is ready for the Broncos. However,
Bengtson will miss the services of
Jim Cox and Pete August, who were
injured in the U.S.F. game. Cox's
ankle injury is still a question mark,
but he may be back in the lineup
in time for Cal—no sooner. The se
riousness of August's injury can't
be determined until more X-rays
are taken early next week.
Down on El ( amino Real, Coach
Len Casanova's Broncos arc ready
and willing to pull the week's
biggest upset. The Broncs have
been working hard all week on
defense against Stanford plays.
It's very probable that they've
done a lot of extra cramming on
how to stop our man. Merriman.
Reports from our Santa "Clara
grapevine tell us that Bronco half
backs. Bill Prentice, Vernon Hare,
Hall Haynes, and Dick Bauer, are
the fastest quartet of halves ever
to wear the Santa Clara colors.
Prentice, who injured his ankle in
the Portland game Sunday, will
probably be ready to start tomor
row. However, quarterback Johnny
Klarich, who has been injured all
season, will have to ride out to
morrow's game on the bench. The
quartcrbacking duties will be ca
pably handled by little—l6o pounds,
5 ft. 6 in.—but tricky Jimmy Crow
ley. who did some good kicking
against Portland.
BRONCO LOSSES MISLEADING
Although they have won only one
ot their first three starts, the Broncs'
record may be misleading. In all
three games they have rolled up
more than 200 yards from scrim
mage, which is enough to win many
ball games. But in three games they
have fumbled 25 times. They have
been good at making yardage and
first downs, but not points.
A tip-off to the fact that Casa
nova is after the Indians' scalps is
the fact that he kept two of his
Ih-sI linemen, end Cy Smith and
tackle Ed Alliquic, on the bencfr
dining the entire Portland game—
just so they'd he in good shape
for Stanford.
..Santa Clara's probable starting
lineup for tomorrow will be as fol
lows: left end. Smith: left tackle,
Falsarella; left guard. McDermid;
center,. Giacopu/./i; right guard,
llyrnc; right tackle. Alliquie; right
end. White; quarterback, Crowley;
left half, nauer; right half. Pren
tice; and Davis at fullback.
Tomorrow's stadium clash is not
going to be the pushover some of
the betting bennies would like us
to think it is. Just ask the '34 Vow
Boys how good a no-good Santa
Clara team can be!
The kickoff is slated for 2:30 to
morrow afternoon.

pably handled by little—l6o pounds,
5 ft. 6 in.—but tricky Jimmy Crow
ley. who did some good kicking
against Portland.
BRONCO LOSSES MISLEADING
Although they have won only one
ot their first three starts, the Broncs'
record may be misleading. In all
three games they have rolled up
more than 200 yards from scrim
mage, which is enough to win many
ball games. But in three games they
have fumbled 25 times. They have
been good at making yardage and
first downs, but not points.
A tip-off to the fact that Casa
nova is after the Indians' scalps is
the fact that he kept two of his
Ih-sI linemen, end Cy Smith and
tackle Ed Alliquic, on the bencfr
dining the entire Portland game—
just so they'd he in good shape
for Stanford.
..Santa Clara's probable starting
lineup for tomorrow will be as fol
lows: left end. Smith: left tackle,
Falsarella; left guard. McDermid;
center,. Giacopu/./i; right guard,
llyrnc; right tackle. Alliquie; right
end. White; quarterback, Crowley;
left half, nauer; right half. Pren
tice; and Davis at fullback.
Tomorrow's stadium clash is not
going to be the pushover some of
the betting bennies would like us
to think it is. Just ask the '34 Vow
Boys how good a no-good Santa
Clara team can be!
The kickoff is slated for 2:30 to
morrow afternoon.
"Santa Clara's Broncos or Santa Clara's Buncoes; Stanford's Champs
or Stanford's Chumps?" So read the lend of a San Francisco sports story
back in 1034 before the Vow Boys' important game with an underdog
Santa Clara team. The answer to the question was left in doubt as the
teams battled to a 7-7 tie.
But times have changed; and tomorrow Coach Marchio Schwartz's

Stanford footballers will again try 1
to find the right answer to this
question. Again the Indians arc
odds -on favorites, but tomorrow, J
just as in 1934, anything can hap- I
pen. Coach Marchie says, "In a tra
ditional game like this, it is hard ■
to say what the outcome will be." ;
Coach Charlie Wakefield, who
tinned in a good performance
down south last weekend, has i
been named game captain for to
morrow's contest. Almost (he i
same team that started against the
Bruins will get the call tomor
row.
The probable Stanford starting j
lineup will be as follows: left end, I
Dave DeSwarte; left tackle, Fred j
Bocnsch; left guard, Bill Hachten;
center, Dick Flatland; right guard.
Harv Bernhard; light tackle, Cap
lain Charlie Wakefield; right end,
Bob Ii all; quarterback, Buck
Brownson; left half, Don Zappct
tini; right half, George Quist; and
Lloyd Merriman at fullback.
ZAPI'ETTINI WILL START
The only change in this lineup
from last week is at the left half
spot, where Don Zappettini will be
starting for the first tim'j. Z;ip,
who has had trouble with his leg
this fall, will be in top shape for
tomorrow's game.
Schwartz put liis boys through
a heavy workout yesterday,
stressing defense as well as pass
ing. The Indians will go through
a lie lit drill this afternoon, run
ning; through some of their new
plays and working on their still
weak passing attack.
Assistant Coach Mai Elward has
scouted the Broncos' first three
games and carefully diagrammed
their plays. With the aid of El
ward's painstaking reports, Schwartz
has been able to give the team plen
ty of work against the Santa Clara
offense.
Physically, the Cards arc in
good shape. Lloyd Merriman, the
Farm's trump card, is ready to do
some of his best running tomor
row, as is big. powerful George
Quist. Quarterback Buck Brown
son can be the key to Stanford
success if he can develop a fair
degree of accuracy with his pass
ing.
LINE READY, BENGTSON SAYS
Line Coach Phil Bengtson reports \
that his big and rough forward wall
is ready for the Broncos. However,
Bengtson will miss the services of
Jim Cox and Pete August, who were
injured in the U.S.F. game. Cox's
ankle injury is still a question mark,
but he may be back in the lineup
in time for Cal—no sooner. The se
riousness of August's injury can't
be determined until more X-rays
are taken early next week.
Down on El ( amino Real, Coach
Len Casanova's Broncos arc ready

biggest upset. The Broncs have
been working hard all week on
defense against Stanford plays.
It's very probable that they've
done a lot of extra cramming on
how to stop our man. Merriman.
Reports from our Santa "Clara
grapevine tell us that Bronco half
backs. Bill Prentice, Vernon Hare,
Hall Haynes, and Dick Bauer, are
the fastest quartet of halves ever
to wear the Santa Clara colors.
Prentice, who injured his ankle in
the Portland game Sunday, will
probably be ready to start tomor
row. However, quarterback Johnny
Klarich, who has been injured all
season, will have to ride out to
morrow's game on the bench. The

some of his best running tomor
row, as is big. powerful George
Quist. Quarterback Buck Brown
son can be the key to Stanford
success if he can develop a fair
degree of accuracy with his pass
ing.
LINE READY, BENGTSON SAYS
Line Coach Phil Bengtson reports \
that his big and rough forward wall
is ready for the Broncos. However,
Bengtson will miss the services of
Jim Cox and Pete August, who were
injured in the U.S.F. game. Cox's
ankle injury is still a question mark,
but he may be back in the lineup
in time for Cal—no sooner. The se
riousness of August's injury can't
be determined until more X-rays
are taken early next week.
Down on El ( amino Real, Coach
Len Casanova's Broncos arc ready
and willing to pull the week's
biggest upset. The Broncs have
been working hard all week on
defense against Stanford plays.
It's very probable that they've
done a lot of extra cramming on
how to stop our man. Merriman.
Reports from our Santa "Clara
grapevine tell us that Bronco half
backs. Bill Prentice, Vernon Hare,
Hall Haynes, and Dick Bauer, are
the fastest quartet of halves ever
to wear the Santa Clara colors.
Prentice, who injured his ankle in
the Portland game Sunday, will
probably be ready to start tomor
row. However, quarterback Johnny
Klarich, who has been injured all
season, will have to ride out to
morrow's game on the bench. The
quartcrbacking duties will be ca
pably handled by little—l6o pounds,
5 ft. 6 in.—but tricky Jimmy Crow
ley. who did some good kicking
against Portland.
BRONCO LOSSES MISLEADING
Although they have won only one
ot their first three starts, the Broncs'
record may be misleading. In all
three games they have rolled up
more than 200 yards from scrim
mage, which is enough to win many
ball games. But in three games they
have fumbled 25 times. They have
been good at making yardage and
first downs, but not points.
A tip-off to the fact that Casa
nova is after the Indians' scalps is
the fact that he kept two of his
Ih-sI linemen, end Cy Smith and
tackle Ed Alliquic, on the bencfr
dining the entire Portland game—
just so they'd he in good shape
for Stanford.
..Santa Clara's probable starting
lineup for tomorrow will be as fol
lows: left end. Smith: left tackle,
Falsarella; left guard. McDermid;
center,. Giacopu/./i; right guard,
llyrnc; right tackle. Alliquie; right
end. White; quarterback, Crowley;
left half, nauer; right half. Pren
tice; and Davis at fullback.
Tomorrow's stadium clash is not
going to be the pushover some of
the betting bennies would like us
to think it is. Just ask the '34 Vow
Boys how good a no-good Santa
Clara team can be!
The kickoff is slated for 2:30 to
morrow afternoon.
"Santa Clara's Broncos or Santa Clara's Buncoes; Stanford's Champs
or Stanford's Chumps?" So read the lend of a San Francisco sports story
back in 1034 before the Vow Boys' important game with an underdog
Santa Clara team. The answer to the question was left in doubt as the
teams battled to a 7-7 tie.
But times have changed; and tomorrow Coach Marchio Schwartz's

Stanford footballers will again try 1
to find the right answer to this
question. Again the Indians arc
odds -on favorites, but tomorrow, J
just as in 1934, anything can hap- I
pen. Coach Marchie says, "In a tra
ditional game like this, it is hard ■
to say what the outcome will be." ;
Coach Charlie Wakefield, who
tinned in a good performance
down south last weekend, has i
been named game captain for to
morrow's contest. Almost (he i
same team that started against the
Bruins will get the call tomor
row.
The probable Stanford starting j
lineup will be as follows: left end, I
Dave DeSwarte; left tackle, Fred j
Bocnsch; left guard, Bill Hachten;
center, Dick Flatland; right guard.
Harv Bernhard; light tackle, Cap
lain Charlie Wakefield; right end,
Bob Ii all; quarterback, Buck
Brownson; left half, Don Zappct
tini; right half, George Quist; and
Lloyd Merriman at fullback.
ZAPI'ETTINI WILL START
The only change in this lineup
from last week is at the left half
spot, where Don Zappettini will be
starting for the first tim'j. Z;ip,
who has had trouble with his leg
this fall, will be in top shape for
tomorrow's game.
Schwartz put liis boys through
a heavy workout yesterday,
stressing defense as well as pass
ing. The Indians will go through
a lie lit drill this afternoon, run
ning; through some of their new
plays and working on their still
weak passing attack.
Assistant Coach Mai Elward has
scouted the Broncos' first three
games and carefully diagrammed
their plays. With the aid of El
ward's painstaking reports, Schwartz
has been able to give the team plen
ty of work against the Santa Clara
offense.
Physically, the Cards arc in
good shape. Lloyd Merriman, the
Farm's trump card, is ready to do
some of his best running tomor
