# Wartime Literature Featured in Library
## 
### 
An exhibit of books published in
the Western states during the war
years, 1C42 to 1945, is on display in
the University Library.
The exhibit is sponsored by the
"Rounce and Coffin Club" of Los
Angeles; a group of jurors selects
the best books published on the
West Coast. This year they selected
55 items which represent the best
work of 25 publishers.
A collection of pictures of Lt.
Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell and aides
on the north Burma front is on
exhibit in the Hoover Library.
