## Criticism or Action? 
### 
Criticism of student government is an in
door sport indulged in at one time or another
by almost eveiy Stanford student. In the opin
ion of many, the ASSU is run by a tight little
gioup of perennial BMOC's.
Unfortunately, healthy criticism is not
brought to the attention of those able to do
something about it, and the extent that student
government fails to represent the majority
views is largely due to the failure of the aver
ago student to take an active part in his cam
pus acmi listration.
Too many students exercise their right of
free speech to criticize without their concur
rent responsibility to take remedial action.
Student government at Stanford is repre
sentative system and those elected to Execu
tive Committee positions generally do a con
scientious job in attempting to represent the
group horn which they come. But this is a
difficult task without the knowledge of the

opinions and criticisms of their constituents.
Every student should know the name of
the Excom member representing him and
when he has an expression of opinion or criti
cism, he should express it to his representa
tive. To encourage such expression, the Daily
next week will print a list of Excorn members
and the areas they represent.
Not only do individual members welcome
contact with students, but anyone has the
privilege of attending and participating in the
weekly Wednesday evening meeting of the
Executive Committee held in the Excom Room
above the Union at 7:15. Virtually all major
decisions on student government emerge
from these meetings.
Representative government implies re
sponsibility on the part of the electorate, a
responsibility not of empty criticism but of
constructive action, a privilege available to
every Stanford student. F.B.
