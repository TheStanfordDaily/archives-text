(UP). â€” Prison medical officers
found a one-inch wound on the ab
domen of Reiehmarshal Hermann
Goering after his death and he may
have kepi there, just under his skin,
the poison container which enabled
him to commit suicide, a usually
reliable informant said tonight.
The disclosure followed an ear
lier announcement that the bodies
of Goering and the 10 German
war criminals who were hanged
had been cremated and the ashes
scattered secretly.
It came also after the disclosure
that during the war crimes trial
guards look from both Goering and
Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel shar
pened pieces of metal which might
have been used in suicide attempts.
The informant who reported the
wound on Coding's abdomen saw
the bodies of Goering and the hang
ed men after they were stripped for
official photographs.
His story was nol confirmed offi
cially but it was circumstantial.
Col. Burton C. Andrus, prison se
curity commandant, announced the
following communique issued by the
four Allied generals of the official
execution commission:
"The body of Hermann Wilhelm
Goering and the bodies of the war
criminals executed at Nuernberg
Oct. Hi, l!)4(i, in accordance with
the sentence of the international
military tribunal, have been cre
mated and the ashes dispersed .se
cretly."
Cremation and the scattering of
the ashes were in accordance with
the Allied policy of allowing on high
Nazi the privilege of a grave which
might become a shrine for German
fanatics.
