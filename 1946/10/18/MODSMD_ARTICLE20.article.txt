## BULL SESSION 
### 
T!k.:-;o of you who read Monday's column will
recall iho woes uf the lad who couldn't find a place
to park in (he evening with his girl and was dis
turb* d by the man with the amateur mobile radio
slat ion.
Well, he tried again the other night. It was a nice
moon > 'it night and he decided it was worth another
atU (iij I. So they drove around until they found a
nice, secluded spot on a wooded path.
ll was a lovely, quiet night and they had just
sell! :i down for a little intellectual conversation.
At that point, a horse put his head in the window
of the car. Disconcerting, to say the least. And
looking out, they discovered that with this horse
were other horses and people. Our romantic pair
were in the middle of a gay moonlight riding party
which had paused to admire the view or something.
So again our thwarted couple went home in a bitter,
bitter mood.
Crime doesn't pay.

Looks like I'm not the only one with laundry
trouble.
Why did Rally Com forbid the yell leaders to
giv< the Axe Yell at last week's U.C.L.A. rally? II
there ever was a more appropriate time for it, I
haven't seen it. With the Axe finally back after a
long disappearance and dramatically unveiled to the
student body at the rally, what better moment could
there have been for the Axe Yell?
The head yell leader went to the rally with the
intention of leading the yell but was told by Rally
Com that it shouldn't be given. Let's not get so
narrow-minded and prejudiced about that yell that
il can't be used on such an occasion as that one,
where it was definitely in keeping with all tradition.
Quite true, the Axe Yell is a very special yell and

.shouldn't be used indiscriminately. But it is asso
ciated very closely with Stanford, and people (such
as the near-capacity crowd in the Coliseum last Sat
urday) expect to hear it occasionally. II it is only
used once a year, that association will be lost and
before long other schools, specifically Cal, will be
using it since we don't.
Certainly, there was never a more fitting moment
for it than (hut rally last week.

Some of Stanford's best legends are rapidly being
lost due to the fact that no one is recording them.
Have you noticed in the local pubs that after a few
brews the vets begin gathering around and telling
"war stories." The more beer the more tales they
remember.
1 don't refer to the grim, grisly, "there I was flat on
my back at 30,000 feet" yarns, but to the humorous
anecdotes recounting the amazing adventures that
some of our Stanford lads ran into in various parts
of the globe.
Some, of course, aren't exactly printable but
those that are should certainly take a place in the
Farm's literature. Such as the yarn that one of our
bigger characters, who was in the Navy, always
tells after six brews and always precisely at 11 o'clock
in the evening. It concerns a pair of shoes that he
wore out that never touched land. That's what he
claims anyway. Took them on the ship new and
wore them completely out without ever stepping on
land with them.
Of course, there are those who contend he was on
a Richmond ferry that got lost in the fog and ended
up at Okinawa, but that's his story.
Anyway, in order to preserve the better of these
gems for posterity, 1 am herewith offering to buy
the beer at Rossotti's Friday afternoon for the person
who sends me the best war story this week. Or if
you don't drink beer, it'll be a double lime coke at
the Cellar and 1 11 tell you a l'eelthy joke to boot.
Any takers? •

Why did Rally Com forbid the yell leaders to

there ever was a more appropriate time for it, I
haven't seen it. With the Axe finally back after a
long disappearance and dramatically unveiled to the
student body at the rally, what better moment could
there have been for the Axe Yell?
The head yell leader went to the rally with the
intention of leading the yell but was told by Rally
Com that it shouldn't be given. Let's not get so
narrow-minded and prejudiced about that yell that
il can't be used on such an occasion as that one,
where it was definitely in keeping with all tradition.
Quite true, the Axe Yell is a very special yell and

.shouldn't be used indiscriminately. But it is asso
ciated very closely with Stanford, and people (such
as the near-capacity crowd in the Coliseum last Sat
urday) expect to hear it occasionally. II it is only
used once a year, that association will be lost and
before long other schools, specifically Cal, will be
using it since we don't.
Certainly, there was never a more fitting moment

Some of Stanford's best legends are rapidly being
lost due to the fact that no one is recording them.
Have you noticed in the local pubs that after a few
brews the vets begin gathering around and telling
"war stories." The more beer the more tales they
remember.
1 don't refer to the grim, grisly, "there I was flat on
my back at 30,000 feet" yarns, but to the humorous
anecdotes recounting the amazing adventures that
some of our Stanford lads ran into in various parts
of the globe.
Some, of course, aren't exactly printable but
those that are should certainly take a place in the
Farm's literature. Such as the yarn that one of our
bigger characters, who was in the Navy, always
tells after six brews and always precisely at 11 o'clock
in the evening. It concerns a pair of shoes that he
wore out that never touched land. That's what he
claims anyway. Took them on the ship new and
wore them completely out without ever stepping on
land with them.
Of course, there are those who contend he was on
a Richmond ferry that got lost in the fog and ended
up at Okinawa, but that's his story.
Anyway, in order to preserve the better of these
gems for posterity, 1 am herewith offering to buy
the beer at Rossotti's Friday afternoon for the person
who sends me the best war story this week. Or if
you don't drink beer, it'll be a double lime coke at
the Cellar and 1 11 tell you a l'eelthy joke to boot.
