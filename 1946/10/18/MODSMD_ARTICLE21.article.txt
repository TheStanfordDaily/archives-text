WHAT IS POLITICAL ACTION?
The signboards along the highway that usually
advertise scotch and real estate now scream at you
in big letters to "STOP PAC DICTATORSHIP." As
the usual election level* falls over the country a
thousand candidates are out 1o convince you of the
dangerous evil of the Political Action Committee.
This has now become a major issue and the scream
ing will increase as th« campaign moves towards its
November 5 climax (or anti-climax).
What's nil the shouting about? PAC Is essentially
an attempt by labt>r, especially the CIO, to exert
some influence in politics and to work toward the
election of candidates supporting labor interests.
There is nothing new in this idea. Businessmen
have strong organizations, such as the National As
sociation of Manufacturers, that keep politicians in
line. Farmers have a number of powerful groups
that back the "proper" candidates. Congressmen
from the silver states fight for the interests of a
handful of silver mine owners.
It's tough to win an election in the South with
out backing by the cotton growers. It's tough to
win an election in California without the backing
of Stanward Oil. It's very tough to get an office
in San Francisco over the opposition of the Catholic
Church.
These examples can be multiplied endlessly to
show that many groups take political action. They
would be the first to object if they were criticized.
Jt you were to forbid the Nal. Assoc. of Manufac
turers to support candidates and lobby in Washing
ton, il would complain loudly about this interference
with its democratic rights.
Yet we find the NAM in the front ranks of those
who profess horror when labor tries the same thing.
After all, says NAM, it's highly undemocratic, yes,

tyrannical, for labor to impose its will on the country.
Apparently political action is fine for business
men and even farmers (who usually are sensible and
vote Republican), but it is simply dreadful for dirty,
Red, Communist, Moscow-controlled workers to pull
the same stunt.
It does not matter that. PAC i.s not dirty, Red, and
run by Moscow its former head, Sidney Hillman,
got posthumous congratulations by newspapers ev
erywhere (including the Chronicle) for his anti-
Communist virtues, and its present leaders are no
more run by Moscow than the nearest Rotary.
Nor does it matter that PAC defends the interests
of a far larger group than most other pressure or
ganizations. To workers congressional action or lack
of it i.s more (ban fancy words, it's a matter of work
or no work, it's a matter of getting decent food, hous
ing, medical care. Nobody will speak for labor it
has to sp'-ak for itself.
The senile leadership of the Republican party is
gunning for the PAC. It is the same leadership that
hasn't had a constructive thought in 14 years, it is
(lie leadership lhat has sniped at bureaucracy, New
Deal proposals, and "bungling," but all it has ad
vocated when put on the spot is to do everything
the Democrats did but better.
It is the leadership that tries to solve 1!M(> prob
lems with ideas that were out of date in 184(i. It is
the leadership that has to resort to the demagoguery
of the PAC issue, not realizing that this makes the
United States ridiculous throughout the world. For
the United States i.s almost the only country in llu'
world that has no strong labor party and the oidy
country where objections to the existence of such a
party still receive serious consideration.
It i.s not hard to see why the world refuses to
recognize us as its saviors. Wo continue to sleep
walk, carrying a big stick.

the United States i.s almost the only country in llu'
world that has no strong labor party and the oidy
country where objections to the existence of such a

It i.s not hard to see why the world refuses to
recognize us as its saviors. Wo continue to sleep

WHAT IS POLITICAL ACTION?
The signboards along the highway that usually
advertise scotch and real estate now scream at you
in big letters to "STOP PAC DICTATORSHIP." As
the usual election level* falls over the country a
thousand candidates are out 1o convince you of the
dangerous evil of the Political Action Committee.
This has now become a major issue and the scream
ing will increase as th« campaign moves towards its
November 5 climax (or anti-climax).
What's nil the shouting about? PAC Is essentially
an attempt by labt>r, especially the CIO, to exert
some influence in politics and to work toward the
election of candidates supporting labor interests.
There is nothing new in this idea. Businessmen
have strong organizations, such as the National As
sociation of Manufacturers, that keep politicians in
line. Farmers have a number of powerful groups
that back the "proper" candidates. Congressmen
from the silver states fight for the interests of a
handful of silver mine owners.
It's tough to win an election in the South with
out backing by the cotton growers. It's tough to
win an election in California without the backing
of Stanward Oil. It's very tough to get an office
in San Francisco over the opposition of the Catholic
Church.
These examples can be multiplied endlessly to
show that many groups take political action. They
would be the first to object if they were criticized.
Jt you were to forbid the Nal. Assoc. of Manufac
turers to support candidates and lobby in Washing
ton, il would complain loudly about this interference
with its democratic rights.
Yet we find the NAM in the front ranks of those
who profess horror when labor tries the same thing.
After all, says NAM, it's highly undemocratic, yes,

tyrannical, for labor to impose its will on the country.
Apparently political action is fine for business
men and even farmers (who usually are sensible and
vote Republican), but it is simply dreadful for dirty,
Red, Communist, Moscow-controlled workers to pull
the same stunt.
It does not matter that. PAC i.s not dirty, Red, and
run by Moscow its former head, Sidney Hillman,
got posthumous congratulations by newspapers ev
erywhere (including the Chronicle) for his anti-
Communist virtues, and its present leaders are no
more run by Moscow than the nearest Rotary.
Nor does it matter that PAC defends the interests
of a far larger group than most other pressure or
ganizations. To workers congressional action or lack
of it i.s more (ban fancy words, it's a matter of work
or no work, it's a matter of getting decent food, hous
ing, medical care. Nobody will speak for labor it
has to sp'-ak for itself.
The senile leadership of the Republican party is
gunning for the PAC. It is the same leadership that
hasn't had a constructive thought in 14 years, it is
(lie leadership lhat has sniped at bureaucracy, New
Deal proposals, and "bungling," but all it has ad
vocated when put on the spot is to do everything
the Democrats did but better.
It is the leadership that tries to solve 1!M(> prob
lems with ideas that were out of date in 184(i. It is
the leadership that has to resort to the demagoguery
of the PAC issue, not realizing that this makes the
United States ridiculous throughout the world. For
the United States i.s almost the only country in llu'
world that has no strong labor party and the oidy
