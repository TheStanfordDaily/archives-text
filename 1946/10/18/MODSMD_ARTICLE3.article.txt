# Livestock Rush Floods Market
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Ocl. 17 (UP). —The
prices of steaks, chops and hams —
still "on the hoof" but which soon
will be in the butcher shops—gen
erally dropped today under pres
sure of the heaviest farm-to-mar
ket shipments this year.
Thousands upon thousands of ani
mals, including at least 117.000 hogs,
jammed the great Midwestern
stockyards as farmers rushed to sell
following the end of price controls.
The shipments indicated an early
end to the meat shortage.
GRAINS TUMBLE
Grain futures tumbled the full
five-cent limit just before the close
of the Chicago Board of Trade, with
one factor an anticipated drop in
feed grain demand because of the
increased livestock shipments.
Wheat closed five cents off but corn
and oats lifted slightly from the bot
tom. Corn finished 31-4 to 3 5-8
cents lower and oats lost 3 5-8 to
4 3-8.
PEAK SHIPMENTS
The livestock shipments sur
passed the rush last summer during
the price ceiling "holiday" and
packers reported difficulty in ob
taining enough help to handle the
record run. Long lines of trucks
filled with cattle, hogs and sheep
congested highways leading into the
stockyards. The situation was ag
gravated in spots by a heavy carry
over of animals from yesterday's
shipments and by a shortage of rail
road cars to haul the livestock away
from the yards after sale to ship
pers.
