So California is going up against Brother Bruin this week. Take my
advice, boys, you're in for a lough week-end; don't expect a breather.
We'd heard a lot about how great they were—a cinch for the Rose Bowl
and all that. So we arranged a trip to Los Angeles to see for ourselves.
We came, we saw, we concurred.
II Stanford couldn't do i(, I fail to see any faint glimmer of hope for
Berkeley. Of course no one expected much of I hem last week when they
ran up against Squirmin' Herman Wedemeyer, so perhaps they shouldn't
be counted out before the game. We'll see. But have your bandages and
liniment ready, gentlemen.
The Stanford Indians have their work cut out for them tomorrow,
make no mistake. Yeah, I know, by comparative scores the Cardinals are
exactly (M points better. But since when have comparative scores ever
meant anything? It's a traditional game—second only to the Stanford-Cal
series in number of games played—and anything is liable to happen in
that sort of a grid-lest.
Santa Clara's Broncos are pointing for this one, hoping to catch the
Schwart/men on the rebound. So you can come to (lie stadium expecting
a football game, not a track meet.
IMiif Drills Linemen
Line Coach Phil Bengtson has been working overtime this week getting
his sweaty behemoths ready for the fray. Tearing his curly locks, no less.
As the line goes, so goes the ball game, to coin a phrase.

Last week that was proven. Yes,
the Bruins had some great backs—
but Stanford has a lew good ones,
too. It just happened that on the
liii" the Westwood boys had just as
much natural ability as the Cards,
they were slightly bigger (in most
cases), and there were more of them.
But this week (he brogan should
be on the other pedal extremity,
ftven with Jim Cox and I'ete Au
gust out, it's hard to see how the
Broncos can match the Card front
line skirmishers.
Take Charley Wakefield, for in
stance. He was just a substitute
until Jim Cox got hurt. But he
filled the breach so well that he's
been appointed game captain this
week. In addition, he boots a long
ball, and will pull out of the line
to do same whenever needed. Rug
ged Lloyd Merriman or even rug
geder Bear Quist will plug the hole
up in front.
Then there's Harvey Bernhard.
Harve isn't as big as the men he's

been lacing (lie last three games, but don't let that worry you. He's the
only lineman who was moving the gigantic LJclans more often than not.
And don't lorget Dick Flatland. He filled in for Pete August against
the Bruins quite nicely. Expect more of the same.
There's no room to mention any more, but that doesn't mean they
haven't turned in some great games. They'll be mentioned later.
I\>H s o>rn—rr
Why go to football games? Read this column to see how they'll come
onl, and solve the traffic problem:
Trojan advances to meet rugged Husky;
Husky will snarl and the Trojan goes Inistky.
Cal fondly hopes to strangle the Bruin,
Hut plans will go wrong as Cal gets a chew in'.
State College of Wash meets the men of Tex Oliver;
The Oregons win, I'll bet my last dollivcr.
The St. Mary's (»aels and Fordham will tangle;
Herman and cohorts will win with a bangle.
And to finish this off with a nice little sizzle,
Cards to bop Hroucs, but they'll have to keep bi/.zle.
* * * *
Peripatetic Paragraphing: One of the Indians' married football players
has a very understanding wife who insists that he keep in top playing
condition at all times. She won't let him drink, smoke, dance, stay up
late, or—anything.
* * * *
I see by the papers that Bruin end Burr Baldwin was selected as
the nation's outstanding lineman last week. He deserves it; when he's
in (lie game the Bruins might as well have 12 men on the field, because
lie's as good a back as lie is a lineman. And the way he gets over be
hind the line to snag those spot passes! If the Stanford secondary came
up and stopped him he'd lateral to Roy Kurrasch. leaving the tackier
with nothing but a silly feeling. Hut if he wasn't bit he'd keep the ball
himself and run for 20 yards. You can't win!
* si* # *
This year many of the nation's gridball teams are eliminating a lot of
the traveling blues by flying to distant games. The boys arrive in no time,
fresh and ready to go. Might be worth a try for the Corvallis trip, eh. Mr.
Masters?

Cards to bop Hroucs, but they'll have to keep bi/.zle.

I see by the papers that Bruin end Burr Baldwin was selected as
the nation's outstanding lineman last week. He deserves it; when he's
in (lie game the Bruins might as well have 12 men on the field, because
lie's as good a back as lie is a lineman. And the way he gets over be

So California is going up against Brother Bruin this week. Take my
advice, boys, you're in for a lough week-end; don't expect a breather.
We'd heard a lot about how great they were—a cinch for the Rose Bowl
and all that. So we arranged a trip to Los Angeles to see for ourselves.
We came, we saw, we concurred.
II Stanford couldn't do i(, I fail to see any faint glimmer of hope for
Berkeley. Of course no one expected much of I hem last week when they
ran up against Squirmin' Herman Wedemeyer, so perhaps they shouldn't
be counted out before the game. We'll see. But have your bandages and
liniment ready, gentlemen.
The Stanford Indians have their work cut out for them tomorrow,
make no mistake. Yeah, I know, by comparative scores the Cardinals are
exactly (M points better. But since when have comparative scores ever
meant anything? It's a traditional game—second only to the Stanford-Cal
series in number of games played—and anything is liable to happen in
that sort of a grid-lest.
Santa Clara's Broncos are pointing for this one, hoping to catch the
Schwart/men on the rebound. So you can come to (lie stadium expecting
a football game, not a track meet.
IMiif Drills Linemen
Line Coach Phil Bengtson has been working overtime this week getting
his sweaty behemoths ready for the fray. Tearing his curly locks, no less.
As the line goes, so goes the ball game, to coin a phrase.

Last week that was proven. Yes,
the Bruins had some great backs—
but Stanford has a lew good ones,
too. It just happened that on the
liii" the Westwood boys had just as
much natural ability as the Cards,
they were slightly bigger (in most
cases), and there were more of them.
But this week (he brogan should
be on the other pedal extremity,
ftven with Jim Cox and I'ete Au
gust out, it's hard to see how the
Broncos can match the Card front
line skirmishers.
Take Charley Wakefield, for in
stance. He was just a substitute
until Jim Cox got hurt. But he
filled the breach so well that he's
been appointed game captain this
week. In addition, he boots a long
ball, and will pull out of the line
to do same whenever needed. Rug
ged Lloyd Merriman or even rug
geder Bear Quist will plug the hole
up in front.
Then there's Harvey Bernhard.
Harve isn't as big as the men he's

been lacing (lie last three games, but don't let that worry you. He's the
only lineman who was moving the gigantic LJclans more often than not.
And don't lorget Dick Flatland. He filled in for Pete August against
the Bruins quite nicely. Expect more of the same.
There's no room to mention any more, but that doesn't mean they
haven't turned in some great games. They'll be mentioned later.

meant anything? It's a traditional game—second only to the Stanford-Cal
series in number of games played—and anything is liable to happen in
that sort of a grid-lest.
Santa Clara's Broncos are pointing for this one, hoping to catch the
Schwart/men on the rebound. So you can come to (lie stadium expecting
a football game, not a track meet.
IMiif Drills Linemen
Line Coach Phil Bengtson has been working overtime this week getting
his sweaty behemoths ready for the fray. Tearing his curly locks, no less.
As the line goes, so goes the ball game, to coin a phrase.

Last week that was proven. Yes,
the Bruins had some great backs—
but Stanford has a lew good ones,
too. It just happened that on the
liii" the Westwood boys had just as
much natural ability as the Cards,
they were slightly bigger (in most
cases), and there were more of them.
But this week (he brogan should
be on the other pedal extremity,
ftven with Jim Cox and I'ete Au
gust out, it's hard to see how the
Broncos can match the Card front
line skirmishers.
Take Charley Wakefield, for in
stance. He was just a substitute
until Jim Cox got hurt. But he
filled the breach so well that he's
been appointed game captain this
week. In addition, he boots a long
ball, and will pull out of the line
to do same whenever needed. Rug
ged Lloyd Merriman or even rug
geder Bear Quist will plug the hole
up in front.
Then there's Harvey Bernhard.
Harve isn't as big as the men he's

been lacing (lie last three games, but don't let that worry you. He's the
only lineman who was moving the gigantic LJclans more often than not.
And don't lorget Dick Flatland. He filled in for Pete August against
the Bruins quite nicely. Expect more of the same.
There's no room to mention any more, but that doesn't mean they
haven't turned in some great games. They'll be mentioned later.

Why go to football games? Read this column to see how they'll come
onl, and solve the traffic problem:
Trojan advances to meet rugged Husky;
Husky will snarl and the Trojan goes Inistky.
Cal fondly hopes to strangle the Bruin,
Hut plans will go wrong as Cal gets a chew in'.
State College of Wash meets the men of Tex Oliver;
The Oregons win, I'll bet my last dollivcr.
The St. Mary's (»aels and Fordham will tangle;
Herman and cohorts will win with a bangle.
And to finish this off with a nice little sizzle,
Cards to bop Hroucs, but they'll have to keep bi/.zle.

Peripatetic Paragraphing: One of the Indians' married football players
has a very understanding wife who insists that he keep in top playing
condition at all times. She won't let him drink, smoke, dance, stay up
late, or—anything.

I see by the papers that Bruin end Burr Baldwin was selected as
the nation's outstanding lineman last week. He deserves it; when he's
in (lie game the Bruins might as well have 12 men on the field, because
lie's as good a back as lie is a lineman. And the way he gets over be
hind the line to snag those spot passes! If the Stanford secondary came
up and stopped him he'd lateral to Roy Kurrasch. leaving the tackier
with nothing but a silly feeling. Hut if he wasn't bit he'd keep the ball
himself and run for 20 yards. You can't win!

This year many of the nation's gridball teams are eliminating a lot of
the traveling blues by flying to distant games. The boys arrive in no time,
fresh and ready to go. Might be worth a try for the Corvallis trip, eh. Mr.
Masters?

So California is going up against Brother Bruin this week. Take my
advice, boys, you're in for a lough week-end; don't expect a breather.
We'd heard a lot about how great they were—a cinch for the Rose Bowl
and all that. So we arranged a trip to Los Angeles to see for ourselves.
We came, we saw, we concurred.
II Stanford couldn't do i(, I fail to see any faint glimmer of hope for
Berkeley. Of course no one expected much of I hem last week when they
ran up against Squirmin' Herman Wedemeyer, so perhaps they shouldn't
be counted out before the game. We'll see. But have your bandages and
liniment ready, gentlemen.
The Stanford Indians have their work cut out for them tomorrow,
make no mistake. Yeah, I know, by comparative scores the Cardinals are
exactly (M points better. But since when have comparative scores ever
meant anything? It's a traditional game—second only to the Stanford-Cal
