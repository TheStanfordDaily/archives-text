Indians don't seem to mind a thing
like betting odds—witness their up
set victory over Humboldt State
two weeks ago—and the little Cards
are anxious to send the little Bron
cos down Highway 101 wishing they
had stayed in Santa Clara.
Can they do it? Well, the boys
are in pretty good shape physi
cally, hut lirst-string backs Norm
Latlin and Paul Kent are still out
with injuries incurred in the

game is set for 12 noon.
Stanford's ambitious Junior Var
sity gridders precede their big Var
sity brothers into Stanford Stadium
tomorrow to run smack into a big,
strong Santa Clara Junior Varsity
outfit.
The Santa Clarans are favored in
the clash, but Coach Eel Stamm's
Indians don't seem to mind a thing
like betting odds—witness their up
set victory over Humboldt State
two weeks ago—and the little Cards
are anxious to send the little Bron
cos down Highway 101 wishing they
had stayed in Santa Clara.
Can they do it? Well, the boys
are in pretty good shape physi
cally, hut lirst-string backs Norm
Latlin and Paul Kent are still out
with injuries incurred in the
Santa Kosa game. But, John
Barnes is back in shape and can
be counted 011 for some depend
able work in the fullback spot,
and Jim Doolcy will lie able to
see some action at end.
Coaches Lin Wolle and Bob
Crane have been running their
backfield boys through a series of
new plays, and brushing them up on
some of their ,older plays.
The jayvees went through a heavy
offensive drill yesterday, and this
afternoon will work on defense
against Santa Clara plays. The
backfield will spend some time this
afternoon working on their passing
attack.
The tentative Stanford lineup for
tomorrow's preliminary contest will
be as follows: left end Doug Murray,
left tackle Howie Council, left guard
Don Fix. center Bili Shirey, right
Jim McKillip, right tackle Sid
Smith, right end Walker Smith,
quarterback Melton, right half
O'Neil, left half Peck, and Bill Lar
son, Fred Fank or John Barnes at
fullback.
Assistant Coach Boh Crane, who
scouted the Bronco JV-Cal Ram
bler game last Saturday, says the
Broncs looked good, in losing a
21-7 game to the strong, undefeat
ed Ramblers.
The Bronc Jayvees use a modified
T formation, and also run off some
tricky single wing plays. Steve
Smelko, Bronc quarter, is an accu
rate passer, and Rog Keck, end,
caught some long passes against the
Ramblers.
