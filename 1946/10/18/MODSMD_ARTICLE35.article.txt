DON ZAPPETTINI, hard-luck Indian backfield man, will no doubt
star! at left half against the Santa Clara Broncos tomorrow. Plagued
with a pulled muscle during practice sessions. Don has come hack strong
and is expected to live up to early season predictions which placed him
as first-string left half. This enthusiastic information was based upon
Zappettini's brilliant performance as a member of the 1)142 Farm fool
hall team.
