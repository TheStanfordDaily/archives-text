## 
### 
Quick thinking and a blocked j
kick proved the undoing of the Toy- |
on Tornadoes in a League II clash
yesterday, as Encina 5W walked of!
with a 6-0 victory. Both teams bat- I
tied fiercely on even terms through- J
out the entire game except for one
fatal lapse of weakness in the Toyon
line deep in their own territory. A 1 j
Wolf of the Encina team charged in, j
blocked a Toyon punt, and fell" on
the ball in the end zone.
In the League I clash, a strong |
Sigma Chi team routed Encina IW,
18-0. The fraternity men showed j
strength early in the game as they

returned a punt on a thrilling fifty
yard sprint to a touchdown. Mean
while a stubborn defense held the
freshman team in their own terri
tory during the entire game.
League V competition saw a well
organized and effective Delta Chi
squad completely dominate ihe Vil
lage 314 giidders, 21-0. But the
honor of Stanford Village was pre
served later in the afternoon as
Building 310 eked out an exciting
18-14 victory over Encina 4W. The
League VI struggle was one of the
day's most closely contested frays,
with the first-year men a constant
threat until the end of the game.
