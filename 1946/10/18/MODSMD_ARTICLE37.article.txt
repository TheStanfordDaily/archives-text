# Harriers Set Meet
## 
### 
Indian harriers, prepping for their
first meet Oct. 2U with Modesto
Junior College, will take to the Stan
ford golf course this afternoon for a
J trial three-mile jaunt. With only
[ two meets on the schedule to date.
| the cross-country boys will have a
short season. The only other date
I set is a home meet Nov. 2 with the i
San Francisco Olympic Club.
Al Masters, Stanford athletic
director, is working on additional
dates for the harriers, but delays
i«i correspondence have held up
release of the complete schedule.
Weiershauser said lie was partic
ularly anxious to take on the Uni
versity of California. A home and
home agreement may be reached
with the Bears if other dates
hoped for Vlon't come through.
The Pacific Coast Conference
meet at Spokane has already been
'< cancelled.
Jack Weiershauser, Stanford
track mentor, listed nine candidates
; from which the seven-man team
| that, will face the Modesto squad
i will be chosen. Best prospect ap
i pears to be Alonzo Lyons, freshman !
from Lewiston, Idaho, who won last
week's trials.
Two lettermen from last year's
track team are also likely candidates j
for the varsity. They are Frank j
Ganahl, Corona, and George Grimes, ;
Oxnard. To back up these hill 'n'
dale speedsters are the bare-looted
Daily sports scribe, John Figg-Hob
j lyn; Gordon Johnson, who chalked
| up a 4:35 mile while at Tufts in the
service; Bob Mclnery, Los Angeles; j
Cal l Schoder, a team member last j
season, and a duet of former letter- !
| men, Al Holubar and Bob Iverson.
Saturday's meet will be the first |
j cross-country date for the Indians j
since 1942, and as far as Weiershau- ;
! ser's records show, the first contest
on the books with Modesto Junior
j College. The meet will be run over
j the local greens and fairways for j
probably three miles. Starting time \
litis not been scheduled.

I set is a home meet Nov. 2 with the i

Al Masters, Stanford athletic
director, is working on additional
dates for the harriers, but delays
i«i correspondence have held up
release of the complete schedule.

'< cancelled.
Jack Weiershauser, Stanford

track team are also likely candidates j
for the varsity. They are Frank j
Ganahl, Corona, and George Grimes, ;
