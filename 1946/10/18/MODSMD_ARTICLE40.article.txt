# Unhappy 'Open City' Jolts Film Tradition
## 
### 
"Open City," the story of Rome under Nazi rule, will begin a week's
engagement at the Varsity Theater Sunday. Attendance should be re
quired of every American.
"Open City" is one of the truly great pictures of movie history. Made
immediately after the Allied victory in Italy and smuggled from the coun-

try, "Open City" is a harsh, bitter,
terrible condemnation of Fascism
and Nazism.
Realism and bitter hate glare from
every scene. There are no false he
roics, no long preaching speeches,
but the film's message is clear.
"Open City" shows what happens
to a people who have lost freedom.
It shows the Italy corrupted by 20
years of Fascism and crushed be- '
neath Nazi occupation that was
struggling vainly to keep soul and
heart above defeat. Essentially, it |
is a picture of the Italy of the pres
ent moment, still torn by an under
ground civil war.
CHILDREN ONLY HOPE
There is no victory in "Open i
City." There is no happy ending.
After the long, dirty parade of vio
lence which the picture portrays, |
only the children are left, and only J
the children are the hope of Italy, j
There are great performances in
"Open City." The pregnant heroine
who is killed by the Fascisti, the !
priest who shelters members of the
underground because he is a Chris
tian; Franceses, the rebel who sur
vives a block search by German !
soldiers â€”all are people that you will
not soon forget. They will outlive
a hundred pale Hollywood copies. J
BASED ON HATE
"Open City" is a picture which |
could never be made in America 112
simply because there is not that
much accumulated hate in the
United States. For hate is the ter
rible backdrop of "Open City," and j
the thing which will frighten the !
audience. Hate is the great force ,
and defect of the picture.
"Open City" should be required I
seeing for every person who thinks
Nazism is a possible system of gov
ernment, and for every person who
is sure that Fascism is only a word.
