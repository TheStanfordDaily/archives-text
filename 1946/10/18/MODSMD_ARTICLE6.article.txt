# 'Konko Bronco' Rally Tonight
## 
### 
Twice as big and twice as loud is
the keynote for tonight's "Konko
the Bronco'' rally at 7:30 in the Pa
vilion, when two teams of cheer
leaders lead the loyal Tribesmen
whooping for the resurgence of In
dian enthusiasm.
Trying out for the positions left
vacant by the resignations of Bill
Lippincott and Carl Data, two
teams of three men each will per
form. Try on tecs are Jack Davics,
Ed Lefcourt. Dick Miller, W. L.
Pratt, Bill Purdy, and Peter Wil
led. They were selected at pre
liminary tryouts earlier this week.

Stanford pom-poms will be sold
at the gates to the stadium to
morrow before the game. The
pom-poms, which were made by
Union Residence, will sell fin- 25
cents.

Coach Marchie Schwartz and
Captain Charlie Wakefield will bo
featured speakers at the rally. For
the second time this season, Joe
Soarcs will act as master of cere
monies. Songs will be sung by the
Union Trio, Guyla Runyon, Marky
Cleek, and Allison Dyce.
The Broncos will be busted, kon
ko-cd, or re-konko-ed — anyway,
soundly defeated — without benefit
of an official slogan from Rally
Committee. Phyl Sutherland and
Crawford Cooley, co-chairman of
the rally, both feel that the team
can win without a slogan Saturday.
At the general campus election
in two weeks, Ken Lcttich, re
maining veil leader, will run with
the six trying out tonight. The
man receiving the most votes will
be head yell leader and the sec
ond and third highest will he as
sistants.
