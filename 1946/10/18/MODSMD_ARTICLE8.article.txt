# Election Aftermath

(EDITORIAL)
When the students arc granted the power for self-government
by the President of this University, it is expected that they
carry out to the best of their combined ability the responsibilities
entrusted to them. Only on the face of competent execution
i can additional responsibility be legitimately requested from the
| President. And Wednesday, to wipe out past successes and to
endanger any proposed extension of power to the students, the
machinery of student government rattled dangerously on the
j verge of breakdown.
Excom is the critical committee''of student government. From
its chairman, the student body president, comes appointment to
such committees as the Election Board, and to the Excom ratify
j ing such appointments comes the obligation to see that such
| appointees carry out satisfactorily the work entrusted to them.
Yet when Excom was faced with the election results Wednes
day night—with three out of seven scheduled posts legally or
illegally filled—it took no action to assure the student body that
j Election Board's mistakes did not recur. The finger of blame in
I this case points not exclusively in the direction of Excom, Elec
! tion Board, or the student body, but at all throe.
"Excom," reads a story in yesterday's Daily, "voted down a
1 motion to have all ballots reviewed by Excom. They thought
J the responsibility for the ballots should be Election Board's."
j Obviously the responsibility must rest finally on Excom. And
in the face of continual election break-down, not only this time
I but last spring and the spring before, it is time they recognized it.
A program of procedure should either be handed to the Elec
tion Board or demanded from them for Excom approval, with
the understanding that such procedure would be carried out.
j It should include provision for checking in the records for rligi
bility of candidates and of persons signing Ihe blanks (many
women this time signed Men's Row or Council blanks); it should
set up responsibility for final preparation and proofreading of
ballots on one person, the chairman of Election Board; it should
include a schedule for Daily announcements as to election rules
concerning electioneering, nomination procedure, etc.; it should
list rules for electioneering, provision for voting lists to be pre
pared for each district; it should require that printed sheets be
drawn up concerning method of counting ballots (just about
"anybody" has been drafted to count votes in recent elections).
The worth of almost any Executive Committee can be traced
I in the final analysis to the pre-election campaigns. Excom must
take a stand that empowers the Board to bring about the best
1 possible election for every member—in terms of interest, accu
racy in balloting, and the eligibility of every candidate.

When the students arc granted the power for self-government
by the President of this University, it is expected that they
carry out to the best of their combined ability the responsibilities
entrusted to them. Only on the face of competent execution

endanger any proposed extension of power to the students, the
machinery of student government rattled dangerously on the

Excom is the critical committee''of student government. From
its chairman, the student body president, comes appointment to
such committees as the Election Board, and to the Excom ratify
j ing such appointments comes the obligation to see that such

Yet when Excom was faced with the election results Wednes
day night—with three out of seven scheduled posts legally or
illegally filled—it took no action to assure the student body that
