# Indians Shade Broncs, 33-26
## 
### DON DAVIES 
Santa Clara's Broncos aren't Buncos anymore!
"Pore little" Santa Clara gave the favored Stanford Indians
something to remember Saturday afternoon before 70,000 empty
seats, and a sprinkling of football enthusiasts, in the Stanford
stadium.
Even the hardened gang in the press box were wiping their

l»ows and oohing and ahhing be-'
fore the afternoon was over—it was
an exciting game. It was exciting,
despite sloppy blocking and tackling
on both sides, and despite too many
dropped handkerchiefs by the men
in the striped shirts.
The Broncs didn't walk oil the
field with a victory—but they look
ed good in losing, 33-26, better th;in
they've looked all year. And the
Cards, who were expected to win
by four touchdowns or more, looked
more than a little ragged. If it had
n't been for Lloyd Merriman, who
is a great football player on the field
as well as in the newspapers, the
Big Red Machine might have found
itself for sale cheap in a Santa Clara
used car lot.
Coach la'ii Casanova's outfit
had more than inspiration and de
termination, they had a quartet of
break-away hacks in M;»scs Cha
vez, Ilal Hayes, Vernon Hare,
and Dick Bauer, and they had the
accurate punting of Rill Crowley.
The Indians' margin of victory can
be boiled down to Merriman, plus
smooth-running Bob Anderson, plus
consistent George Quist, plus supe
rior power.
Willi five and a half minutes gone
in the first period, Merriman took
a fiat pass frqm Buck Brownson on
(lie Stanford 45 and galloped 55
yards to score. Charlie Wakefield
converted, the score was 7-0, and it
looked like the advertised route was
underway.
The Broncs must have forgotten
to read the newspapers, because
they roared right back to tic the
game up. Vein Hare intercepted a
Brownson pass on the Indian 38.
Chavez and Hare went over the
middle for two yards apiece, and on
third down Chavez flipped one into
the arms of teammate O'Sullivan
six yards from the Stanford end
/.one. The referee stepped in on the
next play and pushed Ihe Broncs
back 15 yards for holding. Deter
mined Dick Bauer took the ball and (
stepped off the 21 yards to the goal
for the TD. Chavez added the extra
point and the score stood 7-7.
Early in (he second stanza, San-
ta Clara threatened again, llall
I lay ne.s romped from his own 47
to the Card 5 yard line, but once
again a white handkerchief was
in the dirt, and another holding
penalty pushed the Broncs back
into their own territory and Crow
ley was forced to kick.
Merriman took Crowley's punt
and was forced out of bounds on his
own 11 yard stripe. In four plays
the Cards moved 89 yards to score
for the second time. On the first
play, Bob Anderson spun 20 yards
to the 34, Quist powered to the 38,
and then to the 42, but a backfield in
motion penalty moved the ball back
to the 33. On the fourth play, Mer
riman took a Hat pass from Brown
son, reversed his field, and sprinted
to the Santa Clara 10. Just before
he was forced out of bounds by
Haynes, Merriman lateralled to Bob
Anderson, who carried it the extra
10 yards into the end zone. Wake
field converted again, and Stanford
led 14-7.

Thirty seconds later, after Brown
son's kickofT had been returned to
the Santa Clara 43, Number 28
broke through tackle and raced 53
yards to a Bronco touchdown. Num
ber! 28, who wasn't even listed on
the program, turned out to be little
Frank Kelley, a converted jayvee.
Brownson blocked the try-for-ex
tra point, and Stanford still led, 14-
13.
Dick Madigan set up Stanford's
third tally, when he recovered
Frank Kelley's fumble on the Santa
Clara 44. Bob Anderson danced to
the 30, and two plays later made a
spectacular catch on the 14. Marty
Anderson skirted left end to the 11,
and Merriman crashed to a first
down on the 3. On the next play,
Bob Anderson waltzed through a
comfortable hole created by Billy
Hachten, to score. Quist added the
extra point and the half ended with
the score Stanford 21. Santa Clara
13.
On the first play of the final quar
ter, Wayne Erickson went around
left end for another 6 points. A bad
pass from center deprived Wake
field of a chance to make it three
for three and the score read 27-13.
With Schwartz' first and second
stringers taking a rest, the Broncs
started their tremendous rally.
Frank Forbes' pass from the Stan
ford 34 was intercepted by little Bill
Crowley, who ran down to the 14.
Vern Hare ploughed first to the 9,
then to 7. and finally to a first down
on the 4. Hayncs crashed over for
the touchdown. Chavez' kick was
wide, and the Stanford margin was
narrowed to 27-19.

Schwartz called his starters back I
into action, but the Brones were on !
the prowl, and an alert Bronc grab
bed the ball on the Stanford 24, af- I
ter Merriman had fumbled a bad
pass from Brownson. Vern Hare
caught the Cards flat footed, as he i
ran untouched 19 yards for a Santa j
Clara score. Chavez converted, and j
the Brones now trailed by one very I
slim point.
Just when they looked like they
were coining apart at the seams, j
the Indians snapped back, put to- j
gether eight plays for 7.5 yards and
the clincher. Bob Anderson ran
the Santa Clara kickolT back to
the Stanford 2!). Merriman picked
up one yard, Quist got eight more, j
Anderson crashed to the 41 and a ;
first down, Merriman went off
tackle to the midfield stripe, Quist *
moved down to the Santa Clara
27. Merriman ran nicely to the 40,
Bob Anderson outfoxed more j
than one Bronco, needling his way
33 yards to the S—and on the
eighth play Merriman powered
the remaining 8 yards. Wake
field's kick was wide, and the
score was :i;»-2(i.
Still determined to salvage at least
a tie, the 'Brones came back again j
in the last 3 minutes. After trying
two unsuccessful passes from the 32, i
Crowley, on third down, tossed a |
long one to end Chuck Shively, who i
moved all the way down to the j
Stanford 27. The Brones' last min- j
ute threat was broken up when Au
brey Devine intercepted a Crowley i
pass on the i) yard line, and the
game ended with the score Stan
lord 33, Santa Clara 2ii.

for the second time. On the first
play, Bob Anderson spun 20 yards
to the 34, Quist powered to the 38,
and then to the 42, but a backfield in
motion penalty moved the ball back
to the 33. On the fourth play, Mer
riman took a Hat pass from Brown
son, reversed his field, and sprinted
to the Santa Clara 10. Just before
he was forced out of bounds by
Haynes, Merriman lateralled to Bob
Anderson, who carried it the extra
10 yards into the end zone. Wake
field converted again, and Stanford
led 14-7.

Thirty seconds later, after Brown
son's kickofT had been returned to
the Santa Clara 43, Number 28
broke through tackle and raced 53
yards to a Bronco touchdown. Num
ber! 28, who wasn't even listed on
the program, turned out to be little
Frank Kelley, a converted jayvee.
Brownson blocked the try-for-ex
tra point, and Stanford still led, 14-
13.
Dick Madigan set up Stanford's
third tally, when he recovered
Frank Kelley's fumble on the Santa
Clara 44. Bob Anderson danced to
the 30, and two plays later made a
spectacular catch on the 14. Marty
Anderson skirted left end to the 11,
and Merriman crashed to a first
down on the 3. On the next play,
Bob Anderson waltzed through a
comfortable hole created by Billy
Hachten, to score. Quist added the
extra point and the half ended with
the score Stanford 21. Santa Clara
13.
On the first play of the final quar
ter, Wayne Erickson went around
left end for another 6 points. A bad
pass from center deprived Wake
field of a chance to make it three
for three and the score read 27-13.
With Schwartz' first and second
stringers taking a rest, the Broncs
started their tremendous rally.
Frank Forbes' pass from the Stan
ford 34 was intercepted by little Bill
Crowley, who ran down to the 14.
Vern Hare ploughed first to the 9,
then to 7. and finally to a first down
on the 4. Hayncs crashed over for
the touchdown. Chavez' kick was
wide, and the Stanford margin was
narrowed to 27-19.

Schwartz called his starters back I
into action, but the Brones were on !
the prowl, and an alert Bronc grab
bed the ball on the Stanford 24, af- I
ter Merriman had fumbled a bad
pass from Brownson. Vern Hare
caught the Cards flat footed, as he i
ran untouched 19 yards for a Santa j
Clara score. Chavez converted, and j
the Brones now trailed by one very I
slim point.
Just when they looked like they
were coining apart at the seams, j
the Indians snapped back, put to- j
gether eight plays for 7.5 yards and
the clincher. Bob Anderson ran
the Santa Clara kickolT back to
the Stanford 2!). Merriman picked
up one yard, Quist got eight more, j
Anderson crashed to the 41 and a ;
first down, Merriman went off
tackle to the midfield stripe, Quist *
moved down to the Santa Clara
27. Merriman ran nicely to the 40,
Bob Anderson outfoxed more j
than one Bronco, needling his way
33 yards to the S—and on the
eighth play Merriman powered
the remaining 8 yards. Wake
field's kick was wide, and the
score was :i;»-2(i.
Still determined to salvage at least
a tie, the 'Brones came back again j
in the last 3 minutes. After trying
two unsuccessful passes from the 32, i
Crowley, on third down, tossed a |
long one to end Chuck Shively, who i
moved all the way down to the j
Stanford 27. The Brones' last min- j
ute threat was broken up when Au
brey Devine intercepted a Crowley i
pass on the i) yard line, and the
game ended with the score Stan
lord 33, Santa Clara 2ii.
Santa Clara's Broncos aren't Buncos anymore!
"Pore little" Santa Clara gave the favored Stanford Indians
something to remember Saturday afternoon before 70,000 empty
seats, and a sprinkling of football enthusiasts, in the Stanford
stadium.
Even the hardened gang in the press box were wiping their

l»ows and oohing and ahhing be-'
fore the afternoon was over—it was
an exciting game. It was exciting,
despite sloppy blocking and tackling
on both sides, and despite too many
dropped handkerchiefs by the men
in the striped shirts.
The Broncs didn't walk oil the
field with a victory—but they look
ed good in losing, 33-26, better th;in
they've looked all year. And the
Cards, who were expected to win
by four touchdowns or more, looked
more than a little ragged. If it had
n't been for Lloyd Merriman, who
is a great football player on the field
as well as in the newspapers, the
Big Red Machine might have found
itself for sale cheap in a Santa Clara
used car lot.
Coach la'ii Casanova's outfit
had more than inspiration and de
termination, they had a quartet of
break-away hacks in M;»scs Cha
vez, Ilal Hayes, Vernon Hare,
and Dick Bauer, and they had the
accurate punting of Rill Crowley.
The Indians' margin of victory can
be boiled down to Merriman, plus
smooth-running Bob Anderson, plus
consistent George Quist, plus supe
rior power.
Willi five and a half minutes gone
in the first period, Merriman took
a fiat pass frqm Buck Brownson on
(lie Stanford 45 and galloped 55
yards to score. Charlie Wakefield
converted, the score was 7-0, and it
looked like the advertised route was
underway.
The Broncs must have forgotten
to read the newspapers, because
they roared right back to tic the
game up. Vein Hare intercepted a
Brownson pass on the Indian 38.
Chavez and Hare went over the
middle for two yards apiece, and on
third down Chavez flipped one into
the arms of teammate O'Sullivan
six yards from the Stanford end
/.one. The referee stepped in on the
next play and pushed Ihe Broncs
back 15 yards for holding. Deter
mined Dick Bauer took the ball and (
stepped off the 21 yards to the goal
for the TD. Chavez added the extra
point and the score stood 7-7.
Early in (he second stanza, San-

I lay ne.s romped from his own 47

the Indians snapped back, put to- j
gether eight plays for 7.5 yards and
the clincher. Bob Anderson ran
the Santa Clara kickolT back to
the Stanford 2!). Merriman picked
up one yard, Quist got eight more, j
Anderson crashed to the 41 and a ;
first down, Merriman went off
tackle to the midfield stripe, Quist *
moved down to the Santa Clara

Bob Anderson outfoxed more j
than one Bronco, needling his way
33 yards to the S—and on the
eighth play Merriman powered
the remaining 8 yards. Wake
field's kick was wide, and the
score was :i;»-2(i.
Still determined to salvage at least
a tie, the 'Brones came back again j
in the last 3 minutes. After trying
two unsuccessful passes from the 32, i
Crowley, on third down, tossed a |
long one to end Chuck Shively, who i
moved all the way down to the j
Stanford 27. The Brones' last min- j

game ended with the score Stan

Santa Clara's Broncos aren't Buncos anymore!
"Pore little" Santa Clara gave the favored Stanford Indians
something to remember Saturday afternoon before 70,000 empty
seats, and a sprinkling of football enthusiasts, in the Stanford
stadium.
Even the hardened gang in the press box were wiping their

l»ows and oohing and ahhing be-'
fore the afternoon was over—it was
an exciting game. It was exciting,
despite sloppy blocking and tackling
on both sides, and despite too many
dropped handkerchiefs by the men
in the striped shirts.
The Broncs didn't walk oil the
field with a victory—but they look
ed good in losing, 33-26, better th;in
they've looked all year. And the
Cards, who were expected to win
by four touchdowns or more, looked
more than a little ragged. If it had
n't been for Lloyd Merriman, who
is a great football player on the field
as well as in the newspapers, the
Big Red Machine might have found
itself for sale cheap in a Santa Clara
used car lot.
Coach la'ii Casanova's outfit
had more than inspiration and de
termination, they had a quartet of
break-away hacks in M;»scs Cha
vez, Ilal Hayes, Vernon Hare,
and Dick Bauer, and they had the
accurate punting of Rill Crowley.
The Indians' margin of victory can
be boiled down to Merriman, plus
smooth-running Bob Anderson, plus
consistent George Quist, plus supe
rior power.
Willi five and a half minutes gone
in the first period, Merriman took
a fiat pass frqm Buck Brownson on
(lie Stanford 45 and galloped 55
yards to score. Charlie Wakefield
converted, the score was 7-0, and it
looked like the advertised route was
underway.
The Broncs must have forgotten
to read the newspapers, because
they roared right back to tic the
game up. Vein Hare intercepted a
Brownson pass on the Indian 38.
Chavez and Hare went over the
middle for two yards apiece, and on
third down Chavez flipped one into
the arms of teammate O'Sullivan
six yards from the Stanford end
/.one. The referee stepped in on the
next play and pushed Ihe Broncs
back 15 yards for holding. Deter
mined Dick Bauer took the ball and (
stepped off the 21 yards to the goal
for the TD. Chavez added the extra
point and the score stood 7-7.
Early in (he second stanza, San-
ta Clara threatened again, llall
I lay ne.s romped from his own 47
to the Card 5 yard line, but once
again a white handkerchief was
in the dirt, and another holding
penalty pushed the Broncs back
into their own territory and Crow
ley was forced to kick.
Merriman took Crowley's punt
and was forced out of bounds on his
own 11 yard stripe. In four plays
the Cards moved 89 yards to score
for the second time. On the first
play, Bob Anderson spun 20 yards
to the 34, Quist powered to the 38,
and then to the 42, but a backfield in
motion penalty moved the ball back
to the 33. On the fourth play, Mer
riman took a Hat pass from Brown
son, reversed his field, and sprinted
to the Santa Clara 10. Just before
he was forced out of bounds by
Haynes, Merriman lateralled to Bob
Anderson, who carried it the extra
10 yards into the end zone. Wake
field converted again, and Stanford
led 14-7.

Thirty seconds later, after Brown
son's kickofT had been returned to
the Santa Clara 43, Number 28
broke through tackle and raced 53
yards to a Bronco touchdown. Num
ber! 28, who wasn't even listed on
the program, turned out to be little
Frank Kelley, a converted jayvee.
Brownson blocked the try-for-ex
tra point, and Stanford still led, 14-
13.
Dick Madigan set up Stanford's
third tally, when he recovered
Frank Kelley's fumble on the Santa
Clara 44. Bob Anderson danced to
the 30, and two plays later made a
spectacular catch on the 14. Marty
Anderson skirted left end to the 11,
and Merriman crashed to a first
down on the 3. On the next play,
Bob Anderson waltzed through a
comfortable hole created by Billy
Hachten, to score. Quist added the
extra point and the half ended with
the score Stanford 21. Santa Clara
13.
On the first play of the final quar
ter, Wayne Erickson went around
left end for another 6 points. A bad
pass from center deprived Wake
field of a chance to make it three
for three and the score read 27-13.
With Schwartz' first and second
stringers taking a rest, the Broncs
started their tremendous rally.
Frank Forbes' pass from the Stan
ford 34 was intercepted by little Bill
Crowley, who ran down to the 14.
Vern Hare ploughed first to the 9,
then to 7. and finally to a first down
on the 4. Hayncs crashed over for
the touchdown. Chavez' kick was
wide, and the Stanford margin was
narrowed to 27-19.

Schwartz called his starters back I
into action, but the Brones were on !
the prowl, and an alert Bronc grab
bed the ball on the Stanford 24, af- I
ter Merriman had fumbled a bad
pass from Brownson. Vern Hare
caught the Cards flat footed, as he i
ran untouched 19 yards for a Santa j

the Brones now trailed by one very I
slim point.

(lie Stanford 45 and galloped 55
yards to score. Charlie Wakefield
converted, the score was 7-0, and it
looked like the advertised route was
underway.
The Broncs must have forgotten
to read the newspapers, because
they roared right back to tic the
game up. Vein Hare intercepted a
Brownson pass on the Indian 38.
Chavez and Hare went over the
middle for two yards apiece, and on
third down Chavez flipped one into
the arms of teammate O'Sullivan
six yards from the Stanford end
/.one. The referee stepped in on the
next play and pushed Ihe Broncs
back 15 yards for holding. Deter
mined Dick Bauer took the ball and (
stepped off the 21 yards to the goal
for the TD. Chavez added the extra
point and the score stood 7-7.
Early in (he second stanza, San-
Santa Clara's Broncos aren't Buncos anymore!
"Pore little" Santa Clara gave the favored Stanford Indians
something to remember Saturday afternoon before 70,000 empty
seats, and a sprinkling of football enthusiasts, in the Stanford
stadium.
Even the hardened gang in the press box were wiping their

l»ows and oohing and ahhing be-'
fore the afternoon was over—it was
an exciting game. It was exciting,
despite sloppy blocking and tackling
on both sides, and despite too many
dropped handkerchiefs by the men
in the striped shirts.
The Broncs didn't walk oil the
field with a victory—but they look
ed good in losing, 33-26, better th;in
they've looked all year. And the
Cards, who were expected to win
by four touchdowns or more, looked
more than a little ragged. If it had
n't been for Lloyd Merriman, who
is a great football player on the field
as well as in the newspapers, the
Big Red Machine might have found
itself for sale cheap in a Santa Clara
used car lot.
Coach la'ii Casanova's outfit
had more than inspiration and de
termination, they had a quartet of
break-away hacks in M;»scs Cha
vez, Ilal Hayes, Vernon Hare,
and Dick Bauer, and they had the
accurate punting of Rill Crowley.
The Indians' margin of victory can
be boiled down to Merriman, plus
smooth-running Bob Anderson, plus
consistent George Quist, plus supe
rior power.
Willi five and a half minutes gone
in the first period, Merriman took
a fiat pass frqm Buck Brownson on
(lie Stanford 45 and galloped 55
yards to score. Charlie Wakefield
converted, the score was 7-0, and it
looked like the advertised route was
underway.

next play and pushed Ihe Broncs
back 15 yards for holding. Deter
mined Dick Bauer took the ball and (
stepped off the 21 yards to the goal
for the TD. Chavez added the extra
point and the score stood 7-7.
Early in (he second stanza, San-
ta Clara threatened again, llall
I lay ne.s romped from his own 47
to the Card 5 yard line, but once
again a white handkerchief was
in the dirt, and another holding
penalty pushed the Broncs back
into their own territory and Crow
ley was forced to kick.
Merriman took Crowley's punt
and was forced out of bounds on his
own 11 yard stripe. In four plays
the Cards moved 89 yards to score
for the second time. On the first
play, Bob Anderson spun 20 yards
to the 34, Quist powered to the 38,
and then to the 42, but a backfield in
motion penalty moved the ball back
to the 33. On the fourth play, Mer
riman took a Hat pass from Brown
son, reversed his field, and sprinted
to the Santa Clara 10. Just before
he was forced out of bounds by
Haynes, Merriman lateralled to Bob
Anderson, who carried it the extra
10 yards into the end zone. Wake
field converted again, and Stanford
led 14-7.

Thirty seconds later, after Brown
son's kickofT had been returned to
the Santa Clara 43, Number 28
broke through tackle and raced 53
yards to a Bronco touchdown. Num
ber! 28, who wasn't even listed on
the program, turned out to be little
Frank Kelley, a converted jayvee.
Brownson blocked the try-for-ex
tra point, and Stanford still led, 14-
13.
Dick Madigan set up Stanford's
third tally, when he recovered
Frank Kelley's fumble on the Santa
Clara 44. Bob Anderson danced to
the 30, and two plays later made a
spectacular catch on the 14. Marty
Anderson skirted left end to the 11,
and Merriman crashed to a first
down on the 3. On the next play,
Bob Anderson waltzed through a
comfortable hole created by Billy
Hachten, to score. Quist added the
extra point and the half ended with
the score Stanford 21. Santa Clara
13.
On the first play of the final quar
ter, Wayne Erickson went around
left end for another 6 points. A bad
pass from center deprived Wake
field of a chance to make it three
for three and the score read 27-13.
With Schwartz' first and second
stringers taking a rest, the Broncs
started their tremendous rally.
Frank Forbes' pass from the Stan
ford 34 was intercepted by little Bill
Crowley, who ran down to the 14.
Vern Hare ploughed first to the 9,
then to 7. and finally to a first down
on the 4. Hayncs crashed over for
the touchdown. Chavez' kick was
wide, and the Stanford margin was
narrowed to 27-19.

Schwartz called his starters back I
into action, but the Brones were on !
the prowl, and an alert Bronc grab
bed the ball on the Stanford 24, af- I
ter Merriman had fumbled a bad
pass from Brownson. Vern Hare
caught the Cards flat footed, as he i
ran untouched 19 yards for a Santa j
Clara score. Chavez converted, and j
the Brones now trailed by one very I
slim point.
Just when they looked like they
were coining apart at the seams, j
the Indians snapped back, put to- j
gether eight plays for 7.5 yards and
the clincher. Bob Anderson ran
the Santa Clara kickolT back to
the Stanford 2!). Merriman picked
up one yard, Quist got eight more, j
Anderson crashed to the 41 and a ;
first down, Merriman went off
tackle to the midfield stripe, Quist *
moved down to the Santa Clara
27. Merriman ran nicely to the 40,
Bob Anderson outfoxed more j
than one Bronco, needling his way
33 yards to the S—and on the
eighth play Merriman powered
the remaining 8 yards. Wake
field's kick was wide, and the
score was :i;»-2(i.
Still determined to salvage at least
a tie, the 'Brones came back again j
in the last 3 minutes. After trying
two unsuccessful passes from the 32, i
Crowley, on third down, tossed a |
long one to end Chuck Shively, who i
moved all the way down to the j
Stanford 27. The Brones' last min- j
ute threat was broken up when Au
brey Devine intercepted a Crowley i
pass on the i) yard line, and the
game ended with the score Stan
lord 33, Santa Clara 2ii.
