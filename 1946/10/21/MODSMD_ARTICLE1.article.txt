Santa Clara's Broncos aren't Buncos anymore!
"Pore little" Santa Clara gave the favored Stanford Indians
something to remember Saturday afternoon before 70,000 empty
seats, and a sprinkling of football enthusiasts, in the Stanford
stadium.
Even the hardened gang in the press box were wiping their

l»ows and oohing and ahhing be-'
fore the afternoon was over—it was
an exciting game. It was exciting,
despite sloppy blocking and tackling
on both sides, and despite too many
dropped handkerchiefs by the men
in the striped shirts.
The Broncs didn't walk oil the
field with a victory—but they look
ed good in losing, 33-26, better th;in
they've looked all year. And the
Cards, who were expected to win
by four touchdowns or more, looked
more than a little ragged. If it had
n't been for Lloyd Merriman, who
is a great football player on the field
as well as in the newspapers, the
Big Red Machine might have found

Coach la'ii Casanova's outfit

consistent George Quist, plus supe
rior power.
Willi five and a half minutes gone
in the first period, Merriman took
a fiat pass frqm Buck Brownson on
(lie Stanford 45 and galloped 55
yards to score. Charlie Wakefield
converted, the score was 7-0, and it
looked like the advertised route was
underway.
The Broncs must have forgotten
to read the newspapers, because
they roared right back to tic the
game up. Vein Hare intercepted a
Brownson pass on the Indian 38.
Chavez and Hare went over the
middle for two yards apiece, and on
third down Chavez flipped one into
the arms of teammate O'Sullivan
six yards from the Stanford end
/.one. The referee stepped in on the
next play and pushed Ihe Broncs
back 15 yards for holding. Deter
mined Dick Bauer took the ball and (
stepped off the 21 yards to the goal
for the TD. Chavez added the extra
point and the score stood 7-7.
Early in (he second stanza, San-
