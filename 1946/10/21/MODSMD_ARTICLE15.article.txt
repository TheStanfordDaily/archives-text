# Electioneering
## 
### 
(EDITORIAL)
From the maelstrom of post-election wrangling last week,
one clear-cut issue has emerged: Will elections hereafter allow,
as regular procedure, electioneering on the part of individual
candidates and their committees?
Before any proposal in favor of electioneering is accepted by
Excom, it must be understood that Election Board will oversee
and have the power to over-rule the programs of any candidate.
Otherwise, time and money will be wasted, campaign ethics will
be non-existent, and candidates will tend to be elected on the
basis of the most noise, and not on the highest qualifications.
Approval of electioneering would be a complete reversal of
ASSU policy for the past six or seven years, but in the face of an
enlarged student body and the passive attitude of the majority
of voters, a restricted electioneering policy must be initiated and
enforced. The absence of campaigning aggravates the defects
of the usual apathetic elections when everyone votes for the most
familiar name, and when undercover campaigning and trading
of votes seems to be the only way of getting a candidate elccied.
Student voters must be informed if they are going to be inter
ested enough to make the wisest choice.
Since the preferential system of voting is in effect and since
it depends for maximum effectiveness upon voters knowing each
candidate, there must be some electioneering. This could be
accomplished by making speeches and statements from candi
dates available to all voters. In the case of Excom district elec
tions, assemblies under Election Board supervision could be
held in each area. When the radio station is in operation, time
should be allotted to the various candidates. With Excom'r.
approval, the Daily can print statements from each candidate as
to his platform and qualifications. "Stump speeches" in various
living groups might be allowed for more important general elec
tions.
Should candidates bo allowed lo publish independently ai
their own expense pamphlets on their behalf? The answer to
this, we believe, is "No!" Private electioneering is not the answer
because of the disparity in ability of candidates to pay for cam
paigns. If no alternative devices are forthcoming, we suggest
that Election Board itself, acting as an impartial body, "be em
powered to print a mimeographed information pamphlet for all
important elections. Such a pamphlet would list the offices lo be
filled, the work they accomplish and their place in the govern
mental set-up, special requirements for candidates if any, and
the names and past records of all the candidates for each position.
Every student should be an actual not a potential voter, and
the only way to reach this goal is a dynamic policy on elections.
Every Stanford voter should have accurate and impartial infor
mation on offices and candidates so that each vole is a true one.
An interested and informed electorate is essential to fair elections
and high caliber student government.
