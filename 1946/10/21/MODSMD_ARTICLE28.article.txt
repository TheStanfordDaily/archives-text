## Women's Housing—Final Plan 
### 
Housing Committee has recommended a
plan far acquainting freshmen and transfer
women with the others on campus before
spriji j quarter room diawinq, which il passed
Ly Women's Conference today, will be used
this year. The proposed plan is both realistic
and idealistic in its approach. It was brought
b ! m ihe committee alter discussion on the
big :,!• t'■ rand informal parties plans was stale
ma! d because ol the obvious disadvantage::
of each.
■''in ii r; realized that it is impossible for
every new student to meet all women and see
each living group, tins plan provides lor every
living group to select three women who will
attend a corridor spread al Roble or Branner
an I discuss pertinent campus problems with
t'nr- new students. The mechanics of the plan
are such lhat each new student will meet and
talk with one girl from every house.
In addition, each corridor will be invited
on one informal party in each living group
ar< r), :,o that all girls will see one Row house,

one Union Unit house, and one Lagunita Casa.
Al the end ol the program, each new girl will
not only know one gill from each house, but
will also see a representative sample ol each
ol three types ol living groups. Provision will
be made lor new students to sign up to visit
any houses Ihey have not seen and are par
ticuluily interested in.
ldealistically the plan emphasizes the simi
larities lather than differences between girls
and living group.-; on the whole campus. It
presupposes that all living groups are equally
desirable, that most girls can be happy in any
house to which they are assigned, that all
Stanford giils are interested in problems that
affect Stanford as a whole instead ol the petty
diflerences between one group of girls and
another. With the emphasis not upon the sel
fish interests of individuals but upon inte
grating the various campus elements, it is a
plan that would not only provide a good so
cial program for this year, but also has ideals
thai can be embodied in any future policy.
