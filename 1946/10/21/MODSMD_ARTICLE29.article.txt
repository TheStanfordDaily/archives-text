# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
(Tai.ipus Opinion diverges slightly from its past
policy to present the views of an oil-campus per
son not of the student body. And (hough not a stu
«lc.il, the writer has formulated some very definite
«.pu:i;:;:s on Stanfordites which should be inter
rslinr i.> all. And while we hope lhal (he persons
Mrs. , r ! !:f refers to represent onlv a minority, "the
stinki 2 per cent"—it does bring home the fact
til it Ii y our off-campus conduct or misconduct we
represent Stanford to (he public. The letter im
plies the need for a definite feeling of responsibility
not only to ourselves but to the University in our
actions oIV (he campus.—Ed. note.)
Los Altos, Oct. 15.
T.. the llditoi:
'lot: following has been on my mind for some
time. Sine- leading Colliers "Heels Among the He
roc , 1 have resolved to write to you.
1 am toki that on your campus you have an Honor
Code .In.;! wh;d honor means to Stanford students,
I do not know. 1 don't care a great deal as long as
you stay in: ide your Eden to practise your peculiar
forms of el hies, morals, and social climbing. But
when you come out into the realm of real living we
nit astounded by your lack of honor—and even of
dec'-itcy. To my way of thinking the well-educated,
cull ui id. gracious man or woman is the most won
derful thing on earth. Their existing is a justifica
tion for this business we call civilization. But the
band of perennial adolescents which Stanford Uni
vi i' ity (ostein and caters to nauseates me. This fall
they are a pe^t.
V 1 urs of working on the peninsula in eating
pl&i i ; have given me many and varied experiences.
1 havi yet to meet anyone who serves food who
look' forward to serving a Stanford student. For
the most f;art they are ill bred, inconsiderate, de
manding, condescending snobs. This fall the ma
jority ut your spoiled brats are sloppy drunks. They
roll up to a Drive-In with fifteen or twenty minutes
between them and the campus dead-line for your

fair young maidens. They want SERVICE and they
want it QUICK. As one of (hem expressed it to me,
"Why in hell don't you get more help? There must
he lots of your kind of people looking for jobs."
The kitchens are being cleaned, utensils and foods
stored, employees getting ready to go home after
eight or nine hours of hard work. Hut the owner is
in business. The drunks are served. The bus boys
get out the hoses and wash down the parts of the
lot where the gallant Stanford gentlemen empty
themselves; then they clean the toilets after (lie
lovely Stanford ladies. What a picture it would
make for your year book on this page The Queens,
when sober and on campus on this page The Queens
at 1:20 A.M., out in the nasty, common world.
Your so-called "men, ' lately out of uniform, show
no evidence ol military discipline, mental develop
ment, or human understanding. I can readily be
lieve that they vote the straight Republican ticket,
and command enough English to "read" Esquire.
Also that they have parents to whom the war was a
financial bonanza. 1 have also heard of their prow
ess in uniform the proud uniform of the United
States of America in the gutters, and the brothels
of every town and city of the world. What an honor
to have one of them for an escort!
To us who serve food a drunk is a drunk, whether
he rolls up out of the street, or in a Cadillac paid
lor by some dopey parent. And a drunken female
is a mess whether she is in the business for a living,
or to wangle a society wedding. But—a good many
of your drunks pay their checks with their cars in
gear, and roll quickly away beiore we can discover
that we are short, changed. Will you let them know
that the owner never stands a loss? We make good
on all checks. And some time give them a few les
sons on how to drink. Jl isn't necessary to wallow.
When you publish your original compositions
please have one on how your queens make their
guarded chambers under the 1:30 dead-line, without
getting caught. 1 am standing in line for a copy.
