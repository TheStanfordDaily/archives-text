## BULL SESSION

While the Indians and the Broncos wore playing
tie- t,ic toe with our stadium scoreboard Saturday, 1
112: kkt d over to Berkeley to scout the Bears for San
•I -"is Obispo Polytechnic School and Slale Teachers
College (ok., gang, the old spell!) in advance of theii
contemplated lUi>3 home-and-home series.
What 1 saw was quite an eye-opener. -That big
Brui i line that was opening gaping bolus in the
St-inford forward vfall last week really took a beat
mg bom the inspired Cal forwards. The Uclan.s were
, very lucky that they didn't drop that game b»
tlieii Berkeley cousins.
'I he Bears have an end named Cunningham whose
playing was a standout, even over the Bruin flank
men, including Baldwin, the Westwood candidate
Jor All-America honors.
While it appealed at the start of the season that
■•i t rong Stanford team would go into the Big Game
hs-avy lavorjtes over the weak Bears, it now looks
.• though that tilt may be one of the closest of the
long series.
I Jon t sell the Bears short. They looked mighty
good Saturday.
The Cal rooting section stretched from the minus
10-yard line at one end ol the stadium to the 15-
yard line at the other end, with five yell leaders
running up and down to keep things fired up. Good
. pint and fine card stunts.
Ihe Uclan rooting section, on the other hand,
\\:r the most uninspired dispirited group that I have
ever seen. I hey had no card stunts and were almost
completely lifeless.

Of course, from what I hear, our own UNMIXED
rooting section was far from sharp down here. And
marked I>y such occurrences as counting off the
Santa Clara penalties, booing the rels, and counting
out our score. That sounds like stuff better left to
the Berkeley group, which, incidentally, was very
well-behaved Saturday and did none of that.
* * *
IJ.H.C. shows 11[> here next week-end in another
traditional halite. I understand that their hand,
which will invade our stadium in all its noisy glory,
numbers over 2M)! That's quite a gathering, regard
less of how many of them are Hollywood High stu
dents.
Alongside that, our outfit will look like Benny
Goodman's sextet out for an airing unless a few more
horn-blowers and drum-beaters turn out between
now and Saturday. The band meets tonight at 7 in
the Band House and anyone who would like to help
equalize that tremendous discrepancy between our
aggregation and the Trojan horde will be most wel
come.
Mo: I tragic accident of the quarter happened on
the Road to Rossotti's Friday afternoon. Some driv
ers have just got to be more careful, that's all. A
whole case of brew fell off the back of a beer truck
and smashed in the middle of the road.
As the driver was out brushing the debris off
the road, a carload of Stanfordiles bound for the
cocktail hour at Rossot's summed up the situation
neatly when they paused to inform him, "Be more
g__ J— careful. That stuff is hard to get.''

horn-blowers and drum-beaters turn out between
