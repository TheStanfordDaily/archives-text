# THE 						STANFORD STORY
## A 						Frenchman, His "Mistress" Moved Mayfield's Tongues 
### BILL HORNBY 
Late in 1874 Maylield fell heir to
iUs lirst great mystery. A French
man appeared in the dusty, saloon
ridden town advertising lor "100
hired hands not alraid to work," and
nearby lie bought 1,400 acres which
lie named "Ayjeshire Ranch."
On the ranch lit* huill a small
Collage, a replica ol Marie An
toinette's hideaway in the forests
of Versailles, l.e Petit Trianon.
There he housed Ids invalid wife,
two small children, ami a beau
tiful governess, Mile. Kugeuie
Clojjeiison, who was, according to
the hardy dames of IVlaylield. the
"FrenchmanV' mistress.
It soon became apparent tlu't the
"Frenchman" was a man of money
and luxurious lasle.s. He drove Ihe
workmen toward completion of two
projects, the establishment of a cat -
tle - breeding farm and the land
scaping of a truly baronial estate.
It was to be a place ol castles, ar
tificial lakes, and fine stock. Lux
ury French and feudal — was to
come to the Santa Clara Valley.
Workmen walled oIT an artificial
lake at (lie foot of Mystery Hill, be
tween the present Ryan High Volt
age laboratory and Coronado Road.
They began the construction of six
mysterious tunnels which radiated
out from the lake like the spokes of
a wheel. Back along the woods near
Matadero Creek they built a tower,
doorless and made of brick.
A foreigner with a bankroll, a
beautiful "mistress," mysterious
tunnels, "castles," and a line 1,440-
acre ranch was too much for May
field. This Peter Coutts, as he called
himself, soon was the center of
varied theories.
Those who knew the "inside
story" revealed that Coutts had

lied France for opposing Nupo- j
Icon 111 in his war with Prussia, j
murdering a French nobleman,
relieving the French army of $5,- '
000,000 in the role of an abscond
ing quartermaster, selling war
equipment to the Ceriuans, selling
had shells to the French army, j
or stealing money from a wealthy j
brother. •
The towers, said the experts, |
were the scene of solitary vigils j
where Coutts watched for his en- ;
; emies; the tunnels were for hiding.
In this aura of mystery, Coutts
continued to develop a beautiful
ranch and began lo build a hand- I
some castle on the Sigma Nu-Delta j
Tau Delta bill.
The Frenchman would hike over j
his acres in yellow-topped boots be- j
fore breakfast. After the train had
brought him his breakfast, ol French
bread fresh Irom San Francisco
each morning, Coutts would sur
vey the planting of foreign shrubs,
' or visit his 99 pure-blooded Hoi
steins and Ayreshires, each with its
individual silver bell engraved with
a French nickname.
The old man had a lot of fancy
projects, and his weekly payroll of
$5,000 arrived faithfully on the S.F.
train. He is supposed to have had
every gopher hole on his 1,400 acres
filled and to have supported son
! Albert's favorite sport, paying young
; friends two silver dollars not. to
| chase a single silver dollar thrown !
in ihe bushes.
Suddenly in 1882 the mysterious
Frenchman and his family packed
their trunks and left Ayreshire.
It was supposed he would return
to complete the estate, hut he ;
never came hack.
It lat'jr developed that his real
name was M. Paulin Caperon, pub- J
lisher of the lamed Parisian journal,
j "La Liberie." He had opposed Na- i
i poleon 111 in his move against Prus- j
j sia and had been exiled for life.
When political balances in France
! shifted, he was pardoned. Return
ing to France, he built in the woods
i near Paris the castle that was to |
have rested on a Stanford hill. In
' 1800 he died, not knowing the end
j less questions he had sent reeling
: through the heads of the Mayfield
citizenry.
Traces of the Frenchman remain.
The cottage he built for his family,
which was later to have been the
"love nest" of the young governess,
| became Eseondite Cottage, the first
home of David Starr Jordan, and is
i today the residence of Professor El

iot Black welder. It lies east of Por
tola Road, midway between (be
Quad and College Terrace. Across
the road is the Frenchman's stable,
now remodeled into a residence.
The University filled in the
Frenchman's lake in 1922. Once the
wonder of the countryside, between
the present Ryan Lab and Coronado
Road, today there is nut lung but a
depression and weeds.
The mysterious tunnels were
nothing lull an elaborate search
for an underground river which
Coutts "knew" existed and which
lie planned to use for irrigation.
The (ower on I'age IVlill Itoad was
intended to hold lip a water (auk,
not to hold hack the Frenchman's
enemies.
When Senator Stanford bought
the Frenchman's acres, he got the
legend too. Early student writers
covered the subject thoroughly,
from the Coutts pigs which once ate
their meals on the site of Memorial
Church to this "true story" of the
death of Coutts, reported in an ear
ly issue of the Stanford "Sequoia."
It seems that evil ones who were
set against the old man eventually
appeared, and the Frenchman and
his family and pretty Mile. Eugenie
hid in one of the tunnels. But it col
lapsed, and there they are today,
according to the Stanford "Sequoia."
