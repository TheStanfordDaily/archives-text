Let's hike a look at the football world through the eyes of n few other
people (or rather, as they might have seen it);
BILL LElSF.R—Squirmin' Herman Wedemeyer really put on a show
lor llu* New York customers today. All the experts say he's the greatest
hall hack ever, but as a matter of fact he was a little below average. He
really pulled a wingdinger by taking a wide reverse from Jack Verutti
bark in behind the line and throwing a 37-yard strike to Denny O'Connor
who was in the clear and ran the rest of the way to the Fordham goal line
without a hand being laid on him. I'll diagram the play in my column
later this week.
* $ * >►
I'KKSI'OTT SULLIVAN—The California Bears really showed lluy
have I lie stuff. They played a highly favored Bruin into the ground and
virtually ran him nut of the stadium. The country cousin from down
Wcslwood way was happy to escape with his liic. The Berkeley hoys
racked up 135 yards in total offense, while U.C.L.A. could make only
301 Oh \«'s, C'al Kossi liroke his leg in the first quarter, and Krnie Case
later broke his nose.
$ $ # #
HARRY BORBA It's a lie. The scoreboard must be wrong. It says
the fin.il score was Stanford 33. Santa Clara 2(>, but obviously there must
have been some mistake. The Broncos just aren't that good, but maybe
nobody remembered to tell them. Halfbacks who aren't listed on the pro
gram don't score touchdowns, but Frank Kelley did. Len Casanova looked
at his program, saw he had no such man, and pulled him out of the game.
« « !> *
DICK FRIENDLICH Man, those California Bears have a team! Take
a look at the statistics. No, not the part about U.C.L.A. gaining 32(5 gross
yards on the ground to Cal's 83. That doesn't mean a thing. Look at the
fumbles. Seven of them for the Bruins! That's because they were hit so
hard. Don't worry about Ucla's 13 first downs to Berkeley's (i. Did they
make any of them passing? No! Of course Cal could generate no sign
of a sustained drive and had their touchdown set up by a blocked k'vk,
bid they dominated the play. It's a wonder they lost.

BUI) SI'LNCKR—I hear the Pacific Coast Conference is planning to
become another Rig It). The first thing the Coast collegiate moguls will
have to learn is that they'll have to do more than raise prices to develop
a better league. Maybe they'd be better off if they concentrated on be
coming a good minor circuit before they let their big ideas run away
with them. What's that. Mr. Coast Conference President? Ah. your

JACK ROSENBAUM—What They're Doing Today:
LLOYD MERRIMAN is going to class. MARTY ANDERSON and
HARVEY BERNHARD are limping around on bad legs. HERMAN WE
DEMEYER is on bis way back from New York. CAL ROSSI is in the
hospital keeping his broken leg company. ERNIE CASE is wearing a cast
on his nose. CLIPPER SMITH is riding the night train back from Mem
phis. JACK ROSENBAUM is working for the San Francisco News.

Sights of the Week: George Quist, skinned nose and all, signing auto
graphs for two very sweet young things who were SO thrilled! Trainer
Jarvis plopping Bob Rohrer into a red-hot whirlpool bath on top of Lloyd
Merriman; both young gentlemen had a face full of feet. Lloyd Merriman
laterajing to Bob Anderson with such deception that Bob was in the end
zone playing catch with himself before anyone knew he had the ball.
Frank Kelley, Santa Clara's refugee from the jayvee squad, speeding to a
touchdown while usually staid reporters wildly asked each other who
number 28 was.

Peripatetic Paragraphing: Ace sportswriter Harry Borba asked me
after the game what kind of a bird was in that poem about the ancient
mariner. Later I looked through his story in vain for mention of an alba

from the birds.

Santa Clara's Broncos were high for the Stanford game, as usual.
Marchie Schwartz had nothing but the highest praise for Len Casanova
and his staff. But it wasn't just a case of the Broncs being unexpectedly
good; Ihe Stanfords were below par. Casftnova was working a seven and
eight man line all day—and he wouldn't have dared do that against a
team with a passing attack. Often the blocking and tackling were ragged
—and (lie deception in the behind-lhe-line hall handling was conspicu
ous by its absence. It was straight power that turned the trick. But in
the pinches, when they needed it.the boys really rolled. Which is prob
ably all one should ask for.

The Blundering Herd from down Figueroa Street way has suddenly
come to life. Until they prove otherwise, they'll again have to be called

day. It will take more than Stanford's fine running attack to beat them
h they play the way they did against Washington. 1 mean there'll have
to be some passing; otherwise they'll throw in a nine-man line and stop
the Indian runners cold.

BILL LElSF.R—Squirmin' Herman Wedemeyer really put on a show

hall hack ever, but as a matter of fact he was a little below average. He
really pulled a wingdinger by taking a wide reverse from Jack Verutti
bark in behind the line and throwing a 37-yard strike to Denny O'Connor
who was in the clear and ran the rest of the way to the Fordham goal line
without a hand being laid on him. I'll diagram the play in my column
later this week.

virtually ran him nut of the stadium. The country cousin from down
Wcslwood way was happy to escape with his liic. The Berkeley hoys
racked up 135 yards in total offense, while U.C.L.A. could make only
301 Oh \«'s, C'al Kossi liroke his leg in the first quarter, and Krnie Case

HARRY BORBA It's a lie. The scoreboard must be wrong. It says
the fin.il score was Stanford 33. Santa Clara 2(>, but obviously there must
have been some mistake. The Broncos just aren't that good, but maybe
nobody remembered to tell them. Halfbacks who aren't listed on the pro
gram don't score touchdowns, but Frank Kelley did. Len Casanova looked
at his program, saw he had no such man, and pulled him out of the game.

a look at the statistics. No, not the part about U.C.L.A. gaining 32(5 gross
yards on the ground to Cal's 83. That doesn't mean a thing. Look at the
fumbles. Seven of them for the Bruins! That's because they were hit so
hard. Don't worry about Ucla's 13 first downs to Berkeley's (i. Did they
make any of them passing? No! Of course Cal could generate no sign
of a sustained drive and had their touchdown set up by a blocked k'vk,

after the game what kind of a bird was in that poem about the ancient
mariner. Later I looked through his story in vain for mention of an alba
tross, but nowhere could it be found. Maybe he meant somebody was
from the birds.

Santa Clara's Broncos were high for the Stanford game, as usual.
Marchie Schwartz had nothing but the highest praise for Len Casanova
and his staff. But it wasn't just a case of the Broncs being unexpectedly
good; Ihe Stanfords were below par. Casftnova was working a seven and
eight man line all day—and he wouldn't have dared do that against a
team with a passing attack. Often the blocking and tackling were ragged
—and (lie deception in the behind-lhe-line hall handling was conspicu
ous by its absence. It was straight power that turned the trick. But in
the pinches, when they needed it.the boys really rolled. Which is prob
ably all one should ask for.

The Blundering Herd from down Figueroa Street way has suddenly
come to life. Until they prove otherwise, they'll again have to be called
(he Terrific Trojans—which denotes an interesting afternoon, come Satur
day. It will take more than Stanford's fine running attack to beat them
h they play the way they did against Washington. 1 mean there'll have
to be some passing; otherwise they'll throw in a nine-man line and stop
the Indian runners cold.
Let's hike a look at the football world through the eyes of n few other
people (or rather, as they might have seen it);
BILL LElSF.R—Squirmin' Herman Wedemeyer really put on a show
lor llu* New York customers today. All the experts say he's the greatest
hall hack ever, but as a matter of fact he was a little below average. He
really pulled a wingdinger by taking a wide reverse from Jack Verutti
bark in behind the line and throwing a 37-yard strike to Denny O'Connor
who was in the clear and ran the rest of the way to the Fordham goal line
without a hand being laid on him. I'll diagram the play in my column
later this week.
* $ * >►
I'KKSI'OTT SULLIVAN—The California Bears really showed lluy
have I lie stuff. They played a highly favored Bruin into the ground and
virtually ran him nut of the stadium. The country cousin from down
Wcslwood way was happy to escape with his liic. The Berkeley hoys
racked up 135 yards in total offense, while U.C.L.A. could make only
301 Oh \«'s, C'al Kossi liroke his leg in the first quarter, and Krnie Case
later broke his nose.

HARRY BORBA It's a lie. The scoreboard must be wrong. It says
the fin.il score was Stanford 33. Santa Clara 2(>, but obviously there must
have been some mistake. The Broncos just aren't that good, but maybe
nobody remembered to tell them. Halfbacks who aren't listed on the pro
gram don't score touchdowns, but Frank Kelley did. Len Casanova looked
at his program, saw he had no such man, and pulled him out of the game.

DICK FRIENDLICH Man, those California Bears have a team! Take
a look at the statistics. No, not the part about U.C.L.A. gaining 32(5 gross
yards on the ground to Cal's 83. That doesn't mean a thing. Look at the
fumbles. Seven of them for the Bruins! That's because they were hit so
hard. Don't worry about Ucla's 13 first downs to Berkeley's (i. Did they
make any of them passing? No! Of course Cal could generate no sign
of a sustained drive and had their touchdown set up by a blocked k'vk,
bid they dominated the play. It's a wonder they lost.

become another Rig It). The first thing the Coast collegiate moguls will
have to learn is that they'll have to do more than raise prices to develop
a better league. Maybe they'd be better off if they concentrated on be
coming a good minor circuit before they let their big ideas run away
with them. What's that. Mr. Coast Conference President? Ah. your
