# Tough Row to Hoe for UCLA As Foes Loom Even Rougher

### United Press 
It's four down and four to go as the Bruins of U.C.L.A. head for
what they hope will be their second bid to the Rose Bowl.
But the chances are that Coach Bert Laßrucherie's outfit is
going to find the last half of the schedule considerably more
bruising than the first half.

The Uelans get what should be a ♦
breather this week against the
thrice-defeated Santa Clara Bron
cos —and they'll need it. In edging
out a stubborn California outfit,
13-6, the Bruins lost the services of
their finest halfback, Cal Rossi, with
a broken leg. And they may find
Ernie Case, their sensational Infor
mation quarterback, considerably
the worse for wear with a broken |
nose.
Alter Santa Clara, the Bruins
draw undefeated Oregon, a better
than-usual Montana, and then the 1
"big one" against U.S.C.
The Bruins didn't look too sharp
in heating Brother Bear, and the J
Trojans of U.S.C. looked like the j
powerhouse of old in thumping
Washington, 28-o—so the future I
doesn't appear too rosy for the j
team that scored 12X points to
in the first four games.
While U.C.L.A. plays Santa Clara,
U.S.C. continues what it hopes will
be a comeback campaign against
Stanford; California goes north to
meet the Washington Huskies; Ore
gon State returns to action against
Washington State, and Idaho enter
tains Oregon in Pacific Coast Con
ference games. Montana goes out
side the loop to take on Utah State.
Among the independents, the most
overrated club in the West, the Uni
versity of San Francisco Dons, get
a well-earned rest. The Dons, af
ter winning their opener, have lost
the last three in a row.
Meanwhile, St. Mary's Col
lege. fresh from a slaughter of
I lie lordham Hani in New York,
routes hack to entertain Sail Fran
eisMi fans against the rugged Ne- j
vada eleven in Kezar Stadium.
