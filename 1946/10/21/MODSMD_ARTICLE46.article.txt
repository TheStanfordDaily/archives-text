# Funke Foilsmen Rip Indian Squad
## 
### 
Running into the experienced
Funke Fencing Academy at the
Men's Gym Friday night proved to
be a costly affair for the Indian
foilsmen. Stanford's Alfred Larson
and Phil Mitchell won the only two
bouts for the Indians, whereas the
Funke fencers chalked up 23 win
ning bouts to their credit.
The rest of Coach Elwyn Bugge's
squad was composed of James
Crooker, D:>.vid Erenson, Dean Whit
low, and Fred Williams, and though
losing their bouts to veteran fencers
of the Funke Academy, displayed
skill and ability which lacked only
experience.
