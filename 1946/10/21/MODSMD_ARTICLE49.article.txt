# Food, Service Improved Now Say Encina Residents
## 
### GEORGE CAULFIELD 
"Better food served in a more
pleasing manner" has been the goal
set for Encina Hall this quarter.
Judging by the opinions gathered
from a portion of the approximately
850 regular diners there, this goal
h;is been achieved â€” with vitamins
to spare.
UNIVERSITY NOW SERVES
Between the time that the Army
"evacuated" last spring and the
present quarter, the meal situation
at Encina Hall had been handled by
a private catering service. This
quarter, however, Stanford Univer
sity, in another "back to normalcy'
maneuver, again took over the re
sponsibility of feeding the throngs
of hungry mouths which abound in
the Encina Hall area.
William H. Miller. Director oi
Food and Housing at Stanford, stat
ed t hcit an earnest effort is being
made to see that Encina Hall meals
are up to the standards which pre
vail at all other campus living quar
ters.
During the period when the
Army Specialized Training Pro
gram flourished here, Encina llall
messing facilities often fed as
many as 2,000 military personnel.
However, the so - typically G.I.
habit of using metal compartment
trays was essentially the time
saver which made such a feat
possible.
At present trays are used but'are
combined with dishes in what may
be described as a more pleasing ar
rangement.
CAFETERIA STYLE CONTINUES
In pre-war years only 450 stu
dents relied on Encina for their
daily calorie intake. Until the num
ber of diners again drops to some
where near this figure, the present
cafeteria style of service will be
used; it has proven more efficient
in the feeding of larger numbers,
Mr. Miller said.
Not only Encina residents but also
nearly 250 Toyon men and 70 eating
club gourmets utilize the facilities
at the hall. Particularly enthusias
tic over the meals this quarter are
those who lived at Encinn previ
ously and can use this fact a.s a
basis for comparison.
Not a small factor in preparing

meals for large groups are the
present high prices and the short
ages of vital foodstuffs such as
meat and butter.
The Food and Housing Director,
extremely cognizant of the food sit
uation throughout the campus, ex
pressed an interest in student re
action to present menus.
Much constructive criticism which
has been brought before him has
already been integrated into the
ever-improving student feeding pro
gram.
