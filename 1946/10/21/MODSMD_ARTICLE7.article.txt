### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 20 (UP).â€”Meat
! was back on thousands of U.S. din
ner tables today for the first time in
weeks but many housewives, turn
ing thumbs down on sharply in
creased prices, still served meatless
meals or chickens.
A survey showed that butcher
j shops received a wide variety of
| meat cuts for sale yesterday but at
| prices which many meat - hungry
I housewives could not afford. Beef
| was plentiful in some cities, but all
| pork cuts except bacon were scarce.
Some meat industry spokesmen
{ predicted that when butcher shops
| arc replenished the frantic move
' mcnt of livestock to market will
j gradually subside and prices will
, level off".
