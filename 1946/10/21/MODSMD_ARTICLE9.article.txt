THIS AIN'T THE PROMISED LANDâ€”so you can stop trying to get
away, Moses. Chavez (18), who answers to Moses, takes oIT for a couple
of yards inside left end in Ihe waning moments of the first period in
Indian territory. He didn't get far, because Freddie Bocnsch (21#) and

Dave DeSwarle (3*) closed the gap to stop Chavez, while Harvey Bern
hard (40) comes up to lend a hand, and Bronco fullback Ed Barnctt (33)
crashes in too late to block out Bocnsch. (Photo courtesy of San Jose
