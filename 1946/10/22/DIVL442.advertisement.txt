The Ride-from-Paly
Corner
ffTJELLO! Hop in!" has been a Irn-
I 1 dition at Stanford since horse
and buggy days.
Before the University Avenue under
pass was opened in 1041, the "Ride-from-
Paly Corner" was by a little news stand
on the avenue at the Stanford side ol the
railroad tracks.
When the underpass was built, the
Ride-from-Paly Corner was moved to
Wilson's at the suggestion of a Daily edi
torial.
Outside Wilson's, the Daily noted,
there's an awning to protect students from
either rain or sun.
Inside Wilson's is a waiting bench, if
you'd like to use it, and a telephone, candy,
cokes, snacks, an cigarettes.
Make use of the Ride-from-Paly Cor
ner, Stanfordites. It's at University and
High Streets. And it's all yours!
