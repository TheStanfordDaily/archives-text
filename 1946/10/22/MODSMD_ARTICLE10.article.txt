# Eased Restrictions Give More Grain to Food Manufacturers
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 (UP). â€”The Agriculture Department tonight
cased its restrictions on ihe use of grain in an order that will mean about
1 16 per cent more for distillers, 6 per cent more for brewers, and about
j 15 per cent for breakfast food and other food manufacturers.
The Department said the step is possible in view of this year's record

corn and wheat crops.
85 PER CENT LIMIT
It added, however, that the 85
per cent limitation on the milling
j of flour for domestic use will have
to be continued in view of the
; worldwide shortage of wheat and
I flour.
The increase in grain for bever-
I age alcohol resulted from a change
| in the distillers' allocation formula
which will give them about 3,000,000
; bushels of grain a month, an in
; crease of '100,000 over the previous
' allocation.
BRIAVKRS <;i:t increase
Brewers will get an increase of
about 330.000 bushels of grain a
month. This will give them about
5,6t>0,000 bushH.s a month. On the
basis of normal brewing practices, a
bushel of grain measures out to a
barrel of beer.
The Department also authorized
flour millers to start brewing imme
diately on their November quotas
to meet domestic needs.
It said Hie maritime strike was
holding tip shipments of flour over
seas and millers might as well use
their current stocks to meet domes
tic needs and then make up Ibo ex
ports out of future production. Oth
erwise, one official said, many mill
ers might l)o forced to cut down
their operations.
