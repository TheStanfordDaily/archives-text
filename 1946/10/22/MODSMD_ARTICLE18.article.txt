; WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 (UP).
John L. Lewis demanded reopening
of the United Mine Workers' con
j tract with Ihe government today on
grounds that significant changes in
, the federal wage policy have ocetir
| red and that, the government is not
I living up to its pact for operation of
| the nation's soft-coal mines.
The boss of the AFL Mine Work
| er:. thus raised the prospect of a
strike against the government in
mid -Noveml cr under the union's
I traditional "no contract no work"
I policy.
He wrote Secretary of Ihe Into
i rior .J. A. Krug, federal custodian of
j bituminous mines seized last May
j 22, demanding lhal Ihe government

I ate a new agreement covering
j wages, hours and working condi-
I lions for his 450.00') soft coal miners.
The existing agreement provides
j that either Lewis or the government
may request a bargaining confcr
j enee on 10 days notice. If no agree
ment is reached within 20 'lays, the
: contract may be terminated.
In his two past negotiations for a
j contract both times wilh private
j owners I<ewis has filed notice of
his intention to strike under the
I Smilh-Connally Disputes ae
i tion the day that negotiations be
gan.
The tough-talking lIIMW Ik>.s
] bluntly accused Krug of "breach
j ing" Ihe government-union acree
! menl under which the mines have
been oj>e rated since Mr. Truman
j ordered them seized to end a strike
j last spring.
