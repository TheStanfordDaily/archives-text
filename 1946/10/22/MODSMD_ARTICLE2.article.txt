STUTTGART, Germany, Oct. 21 (UI J ).—American
military police raided five places in Stuttgart tonight,
seizing a number of Germans who were believed to
include suspects in the bombing of three U.S. Military 1
Governmcnl buildings Saturday evening,

Security officials refused to dis
close the purpose or Results of the
raids other than to fiay they were
"ordinary .security i;f»irls." But mil
itary police said some arrests were
made.
HOMES sear< lIED
The raids lasted two hours. They
were made by 60 military police
armed with submachine guns, sev
eral security officials and about 20
German police.
(>The London Daily Express re
ported that 300 American troops,
with tanks, and 200 German police
searched every home within four
blocks for hidden arms and for
werewolves who might have been
responsible for Saturday night's
bombings. Thirty Germans were
arrested, the dispatch said. It was
added that during the raid German
householders were told by loud
speaker to stay indoors.)
WEAPONS FOUND
They followed by a few hours dis
closure that six buried stores of
German weapons intended to arm
Nazi "werewolves" had been found
within 40 miles of Stuttgart shortly
before the three blasts rocked the
area.
Karl Weber, Stuttgart police chief,
announced a reward of 25,000 marks
($2,500) for capture of the Germans
who planted the bombs in three
Military Government buildings Sat
urday evening and hinted that the
death penalty might be imposed if
they were caught.
"These bombings are crimes wor
thy of death," he said.
The buried arsenals included
German carbines, machine guns
with spare barrels, hand grenades,
bayonets, anti-tank bazookas and
thousands of rounds of carbine am
munition.
C AC HES DISCLOSED
Most of the caches were found
near Ulm and New Ulm, 40 miles
cast of Stuttgart on the border be
tween Bavaria and Wuerttcmberg-
Iladen, in searches that extended
through Friday and Saturday.
Counter - intelligence agents and
public safety officials were led to
the caches by a former French sol
flier who as a prisoner of the Ger
mans was forced to help bury the
weapons in April and May, 1945,
during the German army's retreat
into the Baavrian redoubt.
ONE CACHE LOOTED
The French soldier said there had
been seven caches but one of them ,
already had been looted of its weap
ons when American agents reached
the spot, presumably by Germans
belonging to an underground or
ganization of the type responsible
for the Stuttgart bombings.
Two other weapon caches were
found near Stuttgart late in Sep
tember, it was disclosed.

BERLIN, Oct. 21 (UP).—Complete official returns
showed today that the anti-Communist Social Demo
eratic party swept to an overwhelming victory in Ber
lin'.s first postwar election, beating the Soviet-spon
sored Socialist Unity party even in the Russian zone.

Top American officers in Berlin's
four-power Military Government
were frankly pleased with the elec
tion results, but Col. Frank L. How
ley, Military Government director,
said, "It was not a vote for or
against any one of the occupying
powers."
COMMUNISTS LAST
The Social Democrats polled al
most half of the nearly 2,000,000
votes cast in the four-party race,
yetting 948,743 against 431,916 for
the second-place Christian Demo
cratic Union and 383,182 for the So
cialist Unity party, formed by a
merger of Communists and left
wing Socialists and sponsored by
Russia. The Liberal Democratic
party was fourth with 182,097 votes.
The Social Democrats led the l>al
lotine in all 20 of the city's boroughs I
and held clear majorities in seven.
On the basis of an unofficial division |
of the votes, they should win 64 j
seats on the city council, with the i
Christian Democrats receiving 29,
the Socialist Unity party 25 and the !
Liberal party 12. The city council, :
now composed of 70 per cent So- i
cialist Unity members, will write j
the new constitution for Berlin.
RUSSIAN ZONE DEMOCRATIC
In the eight boroughs in the Rus- ;
sian zone the Socialist Unity party l
ran second to the Social Democrats, !
although the Social Democrats were
the chief opponents of Communism i
and were under attack during the
campaign by the Russian - licensed i
press.
Dr. Arthur Werner, appointed
mayor of Berlin by the Russians and
retained under the four-power plan, |
said the vote was "the funeral of :
the present city council." He was I
expected to be replaced soon, prob- '
ably by Socialist Franz Neumann, ■
former Nazi concentration camp in
mate. who led the fight against, the
Socialist party merger with the j
Communists.
UNITY PARTY LOSES LEAD
Tin; Socialist Unity candidates j
were unable to maintain their lead- j
ership even in the Russian zone :
state and district elections, also held
yesterday, in which the Social Dem- ;
ocrats were not licensed to run.
The Unity party polled 3,473,000 !
in returns from Saxony, Thuringia j
and Brandenburg, but failed to win
a majority over the Christian Dem- !
oeratic Union and the Liberal Dem- i
ocratic party, whose combined total
was 3,517,500. In township and
county elections in the same areas
last month the Socialist Unity party
averaged more than 55 per cent of
the vote.

STUTTGART, Germany, Oct. 21 (UI J ).—American
military police raided five places in Stuttgart tonight,
seizing a number of Germans who were believed to
include suspects in the bombing of three U.S. Military 1
Governmcnl buildings Saturday evening,

Security officials refused to dis
close the purpose or Results of the
raids other than to fiay they were
"ordinary .security i;f»irls." But mil
itary police said some arrests were
made.
HOMES sear< lIED
The raids lasted two hours. They
were made by 60 military police
armed with submachine guns, sev
eral security officials and about 20
German police.
(>The London Daily Express re
ported that 300 American troops,
with tanks, and 200 German police
searched every home within four
blocks for hidden arms and for
werewolves who might have been
responsible for Saturday night's
bombings. Thirty Germans were
arrested, the dispatch said. It was
added that during the raid German
householders were told by loud
speaker to stay indoors.)
WEAPONS FOUND
They followed by a few hours dis
closure that six buried stores of
German weapons intended to arm
Nazi "werewolves" had been found
within 40 miles of Stuttgart shortly
before the three blasts rocked the
area.
Karl Weber, Stuttgart police chief,
announced a reward of 25,000 marks
($2,500) for capture of the Germans
who planted the bombs in three
Military Government buildings Sat
urday evening and hinted that the
death penalty might be imposed if
they were caught.
"These bombings are crimes wor
thy of death," he said.
The buried arsenals included
German carbines, machine guns
with spare barrels, hand grenades,
bayonets, anti-tank bazookas and
thousands of rounds of carbine am
munition.
C AC HES DISCLOSED
Most of the caches were found
near Ulm and New Ulm, 40 miles
cast of Stuttgart on the border be
tween Bavaria and Wuerttcmberg-
Iladen, in searches that extended
through Friday and Saturday.
Counter - intelligence agents and
public safety officials were led to
the caches by a former French sol
flier who as a prisoner of the Ger
mans was forced to help bury the
weapons in April and May, 1945,
during the German army's retreat
into the Baavrian redoubt.
ONE CACHE LOOTED
The French soldier said there had
been seven caches but one of them ,
already had been looted of its weap

the spot, presumably by Germans
belonging to an underground or
ganization of the type responsible
for the Stuttgart bombings.
Two other weapon caches were

BERLIN, Oct. 21 (UP).—Complete official returns
showed today that the anti-Communist Social Demo

Top American officers in Berlin's
four-power Military Government
were frankly pleased with the elec
tion results, but Col. Frank L. How
ley, Military Government director,
said, "It was not a vote for or

most half of the nearly 2,000,000
votes cast in the four-party race,

cratic Union and 383,182 for the So
cialist Unity party, formed by a
merger of Communists and left
wing Socialists and sponsored by
Russia. The Liberal Democratic
party was fourth with 182,097 votes.
The Social Democrats led the l>al
lotine in all 20 of the city's boroughs I
and held clear majorities in seven.
On the basis of an unofficial division |
of the votes, they should win 64 j
seats on the city council, with the i
