## Open Door to What? 
### 
China today is one of the major testing
grounds of American diplomacy and foreign
policy. The civil war now raging there is
rapidly being resolved into a U.S. vs. Russian
light for political domination of China; and
1 - Jess of which nation emerges victori
ous, 11 the high ideals voiced at San Francisco
ana Potsdam will have been blown to bits in
n conflict that is neither Russia's nor our busi
ness.
The immediate facts which prompt this
echloi ..! are that 50 American Marines have
been idle! since V-J Day while fighting with
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek's forces; and
the t the United States is spending valuable
money in supplying Chiang's men with
plan is, guns, and munitions.
We cannot confirm reports that Russia is
doing the same for the Communist forces op
posing Chiang; though undoubtedly the Com
rnun< .t drive in China is politically and ideal
ist'ca! 1 y Moscow-inspired.
1 inuring largely in the futile American
attempts that have been made to solve China's
p:.-.!<'•••nis is China's economic situation. China
is desperately poor and burdened by a stag
rj< i ii::• inflation. Yet we continue oui efforts
to l>.'i ;t< r a false economy by lending Chiang
enough money to temporally stabilize Chi
nese currency while, in fact, most of the
•funds cire spent on a tragically wasteful war.
We must realize that what may be good
for I' i United States economically and po-
Jiti lly may not be as good for China. Our
br<, . 1 of democracy simply cannot function
in a country where millions are starving,
where industry is at a standstill, and where 95
per cent of the population is illiterate.
Whether we like it or not, the truth is that
Chin.i will nave to grow to democracy through

socialism of some sort if she is to attain the
place among nations that she so rightfully
deserves.
For this reason we strongly advocate the
suggestion made by Brig. Gen. (ret.) Evans F.
Carlson Friday night at the China Conference
in San Francisco. He proposed that the con
ference draft a resolution to be presented to
President Truman suggesting that the U.S. and
Russia guarantee they would "neither seek
nor accept military bases in China, and that
neithci would furnish aid to the Chinese Com
munists or Central Government until peace is
made."
Such a request should have come from
the Chinese themselves. But Chiang Kai-Shek,
by his actions, seems to fear the loss of Amer
ican protection because it would probably
mean the loss of his control over the "official"
warring political faction in China. And his
refusal to make a concerted effort at compro
mise between the Central Government and
the Communists leads us to but one conclu
sion: he is more concerned with keeping the
power he has than he is in seeing China win
peace and a people's government.
Should General Carlson's suggestion be
come actuality, there is still much to be done
in China. Economically, socially, and cultur
ally China's needs are unlimited. But her
problem in this case is not one for the United
States, but rather one for the United Nations.
We can most effectively demonstrate our
advocacy of world co-operation by working
with the United Nations to help China solve
her problems and find her place as a nation
among nations. And only by backing up our
words with action can we prove the sincerity
of our often-voiced demands for international
co-operation. M.S.
