# BILL COUGHLIN
## BULL SESSION 
### 
Good morning, all you sloppy drunk Cadillac
drivers arid spoiled brats, stop lighting ten-dollar
bills under your morning coffee and hark ye to your
ol'l upchucking Bull-Sessioner.
If I'm going to get included in nasty old gen-
iik•_* that one yesterday, I'm going to write
in.v mother and tell her to tell my father to send me
a Cadillac • so I can go make like a bird at a drive-in.
Could it be that some of the people who served
the public during the war and discovered that they
could be as unpleasant as they pleased to the cus
tomers are now reaping some of the enmity they
: . d and discovering it has a bitter taste?
But the main point is, of course, that the entire
.* lu it nt body is being judged by the actions of a small
minority. If I were going to blindly question the
tic I a ins and morals of all drive-in carhops through
ob:,f rvations of a few I have known (I know what
you'r • thinking), I could certainly write a much
rnoiv scathing letter to the editor of the Carhops'
Journal than the one printed in Monday's Daily.
Ols, well, pardon me while 1 rush down for a
20-minute meal and a quick heave at the nearest
lood < in-wheels joint and then off to the local
broth I Hit weren't for these darn unmixed root
in;' sections, I wouldn't be so l'rustiated!
* * *
And so for the rest of today's column, I give you
sonic of iny mornin's mail —a letter from one whom
i suspect of being a local Chinese laiindiyman. But
anything to get my laundry done!
P'.ii Mr. Cougldin:
IVIy female sympathies were deeply moved when

I read your column a few days ago concerning your
laundry plight. I thought your solution of having
each girl on the campus take care of the washing of
2.7 men was most commendable, and I for one am
willing to help. 1 am sure it would he inspiring to
a visitor to walk along the Row on a sunlit after
noon and see all the campus cuties bent over tubs
and washboards, scrubbing the beer stains out of
levis. How could we furnish a cleaner example of
Stanford spirit?
I would be only too happy to include you in my
quota, Mr. Coughlin (or may 1 call you Bill?), even
if you do have an accumulation. The first washing
would be a little heavy, but after that we could start
witli a clean slate. I need the exercise anyway. When
a gill gets past two hundred pounds it is time to do
something to reduce. And besides, Bill, I think you're
cute. (Ed. note —This wench lias obviously never
seen Coughlin.)
Ever since I read your column I've looked for
you on the Quad to tell you I am willing (to do your
laundry, that is), but I haven't found you yet. (Ed.
note—l told yon so!) You said you would be weal
ing a laundry bag. Well, I found several girls wear
ing converted laundry bags, and several men who
were Sad Sacks, but I still haven't found you, Bill
dear.
1 hope we get together soon. (Coughlin's note—
We will it (lie editor will keep her nose out of my
htisint'ss.)
Lovingly yours,
Twann M;m
