i resident truman has given up any claim he
112 v< i had to lead the nation. He is a follower, lie
tried, at. first, to follow Roosevelt policies. In the fart*
til ; teat political and popular opposition, he gave
j'lound. Both the Wallace incident and the meat
control decision illustrate this. Now it would appear
lhat lit- is following the policies of a "middle-of-the
re.vi group of Democratic party leaders. Not, to
hi', credit, those of the Talmadge-Bilbo-Rankin" axis;
ii r those of the Wallaee-CIO entente.
At present the "boys from Missouri" seem to be
handing down the party line. Now, whatever the
Constitution may prescribe, the President, in fact,
must be a leader. And my conclusion i' that Truman
i a figurehead.
The question now posed is, who will, who can,
the Democrats put up for President in 1948? And
rii;, answer is, Secretary of State James Byrnes. J1 ♦ •
i < \pei ienced; he has served in the Senate and on
the Supreme Court; he wa:: Roosevelt's "assistant
president," and he has been acquiring considerable
practical knowledge of foreign affairs lately. Me is
irom the South, which means something in a Demo
cratic convention. And he has not been embroiled in
Ihe present confusion of domestic affairs.
To be sure, he is a conservative and no friend of
Russia, but both these qualities seem to have secured
him much popular support in the last few months.
II the present trend continues, that is to say, if the
American voter is to he faced with a choice between
two conservative parties in 1948, Byrnes' record in
ioi'ejgn affairs will not be an argument against him.
Certainly he would be an appealing candidate in
contrast to a Taft or a Dewey.
It is easy enough today for the confirmed "col

l
lectivist" to find some group or organization to tie
to. Reading from left to right, he can sign up with
the Communists or the Socialists, or one of the shades
of opinion represented by the PAC-Wallace-New
Republic-New D al spectrum. Avoiding any sug
gestion of a center or moderate point of view, we
shade off rapidly through the Old Guards of both
major parties, the "official" Catholic Church, the
Gerald L. K. Smiths and the Ku Klux Klan. But
those who care neither for Red Fascists nor Black
Fascists, thus-? who have some respect for demon
strable facts, some faith in the democratic process,
some belief in the worth and dignity of the individ
ual, these poor unfortunates are the orphans of mod
ern politics. Like Mercutio, the confused liberal
cries, "A plague on both your houses," and Mer
uit io's fate will probably be his, too.

My colleague Brunn posed the question last week
of why it was so "dreadful for dirty, Red, Commun
ist, Moscow-controlled workers" to organize for po
litical action. He denied the truth of the adjectives,
and pointed out that the NAM, the Catholic Church,
and various persons and corporations do the same
thing. My comment is this: the PAC is attacked
not. because it represents a portion of organized
labor, but because it is a powerful, nationwide, ef
fective organization. If, like the NAM, for instance,
it was principally a sounding-board and a Washing
ton lobby, those who disagree with it so violently
would not consider it woi th attacking. But because
it works in every precinct to "get out the vote," to
expose the records til unfriendly Congressmen, etc.,
because, in a word, it is efficient and effective, those
who oppose it attack it. In a way, it's a compliment.
