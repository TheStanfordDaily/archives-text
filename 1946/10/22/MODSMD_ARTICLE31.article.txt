# CAMPUS OPINION

To the Editor:
I am one of Stanford's veterans.
I am in this school because of the
generosity of the representatives of
the people of the United Slates who
passed (in recognition of services
rendered?) the "G.I. Bill of Rights."
Whatever the reason for the peo
ples' granting of this educational op
portunity, 1 am confident, that the
vast majority of veterans do not
feel that they have been paid for
something, but rather, are quite
grateful. They are, generally speak
ing, a class of students who are
here, not for the life of a country
club, but for an education. I am
sure that this class outnumbers the
class of drunken .snobs referred to t
by Mrs. Might (in yesterday's lei-I
>er).
There are many students at
Stanford who are here not be
cause it is one of the most expen
sive schools in the West, hut in
spite of that fact. They are here
through the fruit* of hard labor.
They are at Stanford because it is
one of the best institutions ot
learning in the nation.
There are many ol those who have
the advantage of wealth who have
a goal as serious as those of us who
are less fortunate. I would like to
suggest th;i! Mrs. Might, and any
who shale her Opinion, visit, the
halls of the main library on any
evening during the week and com
pare the number of Stanford men j
and women who are studying with
the number who are in the area's j
saloons.
My time on the Stanford campus j
has been short, but ol the "Queens
with whom 1 have become acquaint
ed there are far more who either
refuse to drink or drink moder
ately (may I say, "like ladies"), than
could by any stretch of the imagi
nation fit the description applied to
the coeds by Mrs. Might.
From personal experience I
dare to make the statement that
in the city of San Francisco dur
ing the past week there could he
found at least as many white hats
and corporal's stripes in the Geary
Theater and the Opera House as
there could in the brothels, and
more in any of the major motion
picture theaters than in the Presi
dent Follies. Yet Marcia would
be ashamed to be seen with a vet
eran.

Is not hers the attitude of millions
who judge vast numbers by their
acquaintance with a few? General
izations, impossible to be true, are
made about any group who have a
common identification. From nar
rowness (if attitude such as that ex
hibited by Mrs. Hight grow preju
dices against races, nationalities, and
religions.
Through such prejudices politi
cal demagogues become tyrants.
From such prejudices come the
deepest miseries and the greatest
oppressions that scourge the hu
man race.
Please, Mrs. Might, try to think of
j Stanford in terms of the University
I that il is, rather than as a reflection
j ol the bad impression that some so
cially maladjusted drunks may have
given you, and try to view even
these with compassion and remem
ber that their actions may well have
been Ihe result of certain l'al::e ideas
that have been implanted in their
minds and may be corrected if un
derstanding and reason are allowed
to take the place of animosity.
PleaSe, public opinion, try to
think of human beings, not as mem
bers of any general group, but as
individuals, and remember that the
average individual is basically a
rather decent sort of a person.
Sincerely,
Norman J. McMeekin
