## IT SEZ HERE:

Well, now, that was quite a day.
Hurrying to make a 9 o'clock, 1 dropped into the Cellar to pick up a
pack of cigarets, and bumped into Gene Martin. The stuff started Hying
thick and quick right then.
' Boy, are we in a mess; three good men out—Quist, Maity Anderson
and Bernhard." I swallowed my gum, did a double take and came back
quick.
"Quist! Quist! You're nuts, nothing's the matter with Quist!"
"The guy's on crutches. He's got a chipped bone in his knee. Marty
Anderson's also got a bad knee, maybe out the rest of the season."
"And Bernhard?"
"He's got a bad knee, too."
"Holy beiahbers." I made the BAC in nothing Hat, went in the front
door and collided with Marchie Schwartz coining in the hack door.
"What's this ahout Quist?"
"What's what about George?"
"lie's on crutches! One of the guys told nie lie's got a chipped hone in
his knee."
"What!! Quist! Holy bejabbers!"
We almost took Don Liebendorfer's door off the hinges going into his
office. "What about Quist?"
• Wisely waiting until we had cooled off, the local team's publico then
picked up the hot question.
"Dr. Roth thinks he has a chipped bone in his knee, and may be lost
lot some time. But of course, that's liable for revision later on."
1 followed Marchie back to his office, where we proceeded to look at
each other with unbelieving eyes, punctuated by confused headshakes.
"Holy hejahhers." "Yeah, Holy bejabbers."
We moped about a bit; Marchie answered a couple of phone calls, and
we read the morning papers. Al'tei v a while the gloom eased off and we
talked about the crowds the pros were drawing, and Cleveland's Paul
Drown. But we couldn't stay away from the team.
"What are you going to do, Marchie?"
He brushed il off. "Say, you know, nobody's said anything about Dick
Flatland; he didn't play the second hall because of a sore leg. But I don't
.see it in any paper."
"I was going to ask you ahont it. hut 1 forgot. What are you going to
do now?"
"Look, why don't you go up to the City wilh me and Phil (Bengtson)
and Harry Borba to the Football Writer's Luncheon at the Pi-ess Club."
1 accepted before he finished; and the trip up was marked by enforced
levity everyone thinking about what Southern Cal had done to Washing
ton last week. And also wondering what Stanford would do, this week.
Al the luncheon, the soup and turkey were polished off in short order
by the Fourth Estate and guests, whereupon Hal Wood of the United Press
called the meeting to order and asked if there were any complaints. A
couple of the writers did some complaining about the guards employed by
Stanford at football games, and "can't they tell the difference between a
typewriter and a radio?"
First on the agenda was Dean Simpson of College of the Pacific, who
related the woes of Amos Alonzo Stagg's 47-14 loss to Arizona, and asked
the assembled for commiseration next week when the Tigers tangle with
Northwestern.
Next was Bob Branzan of San Jose State who was elated by the Spar
tan triumph over Idaho even if it did come in the closing moments of the
game.
Then came Santa Clara's Len Casanova. "This Merriman guy is all
they said he was. I'd heard of him before he came back to Stanford.
When he was with the Norman (Okla.) Zoomers, his coach tried to get him
and Dick Flatland to go to Alabama, but they were determined to come
back to the Coast. He told me to look them up when they get back, and
I guess I have.
"Our hoys vindicated themselves in the Stanford game: first they
fumbled to set up the Indians' touchdowns, and then they retaliated hy
scoring themselves.
"What I can't understand, though, is why so many people congratu
lated us after we lost the game?"
Dick Boyle of S.F. State then wrung the towel describing how the
Gators lost to Cal Poly by 7-G.
After that came Troy's tub-thumper Dick Nash, and he filled a book.
"Washington helped us win by its futility; the Huskies had a net yardage
of minus ten, and they picked up a couple of yards in the final period
against our fourth string. Our line charged and our backs poured through
their tackles, first one and then the other."
"However, I will refuse to say that we have arrived. A few of our
'names' didn't play—Gray, McCardle and Tannehill. As it stands now our
backfield has Lilywhite at qb, Garlin and Battle at halves and Whitehead
and Musick alternating at full."
"In the line, Ferraro and Jim Callanan are terrific on defense, Callanan
being as good an end as you'll find in the West. And the whole team is
coming up here to give Stanford a hellova battle Saturday."
The next man's turn was Marchie. who proceeded to read off a list of
casualties: Quist, may have a chipped knee bone; Anderson, torn internal
knee ligament; Bernhard, bad knee; Rohrer, bad shoulder; Flatland, sore
leg; Hall and Eller. sore muscles; August, definitely not ready this Sat
urday.
"Quist is out for some time, and his loss hurts. He was our best
blocker, and a key man on defense hacking up the line. We're moving
Buddy Scott hack to center, Marty Feldman will play right and left
guard, and Ted Liljenwall will move to right guard. And the reports
from our scouts say that USC is going to give us a terrific battle
this week."
Next man up was Cal's Wickhorst: "Marchie, I could have told you

how much losing Quist hurts last
August, when we heard he trans- I
ferred to Stanford." Wickhorst then
congratulated St. Mary's Jim Phe- .
lan for putting the Coast back on
the gridiron map. He also couldn't
figure out why he got so many con- j
grats for losing a game. "Cal and
Santa Clara missed their chances to
score upsets last week, but there'll
still be plenty coming up."
Last but not least was Phelan and
the witty Irishman raconteered all
over the place about the three ball
games he saw in two days in New
York.
