How good are the Stanford Jay
j vees?
Against a big, powerful Humboldt
\ State team at Areata two weeks ago,
j they looked like world-beaters,
winning handily, 21-0. But in Sat
j urday's preliminary with a much
weaker Santa Clara Junior Varsity,
J they just didn't have it, losing a
heart breaker, 14-13.
Coach Ed Stamm has a better
team than the one that lost to Santa
Clara, and they will get a chance to
prove just how good they are when
they bump into the Jayvees from
the University of Southern Califor
nia in next Saturday's preliminary
j to the Stanford-USC clash in the
Indian stadium.
Stamm offers no excuses for the
Santa Clara defeat. The little Broncs
were steamed up and just like their
big brother Broncs they played way
| over their heads. Every time the
I little Indians would loaf, the Broncs
' would be right on their neck. Just
look at those two-blocked kicks
that the Broncos converted into
their only touchdowns.
The little Cards collected more
than their share of minor injuries.
Jim O'Neil's bruised shoulder is the
only one of serious consequence;
however X-rays this week will de
termine if O'Neil will be in the line
up for the USC game.
Halfback Paul Kent, who injured
| his ankle way back in the Santa
Rosa game, may be back in shape
in time for USC. Ends Jim Dooley
and Paul Ghillotti are also expected
to be back in uniform before Sat
urday.
