## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 (UP). -
An American move to obtain Allied
supervision of the forthcoming Bui- j
garian elections has been rejected '
by Russia's "rude interference" in!
the affairs of that former Axis sat
ellite, the State Department said to
day. i
' 1
Russias blunt dismissal of the i
American petition raised the pos- j
sibility that the United States may
refuse to accept the results of the
Oct. 27 elections as representative |
of the will of the Bulgarian people. !
In that event, this government al- j
most certainly would withhold rec- 1
ognition from whatever regime
wins.
MOSCOW PACT VIOLATED
The American request was based |
on the Big Four Moscow agreement |
providing for establishment of a
representative government in Bui- j
garia, and it was directed to the Al- \
lied Control Commission for Bui- 1
garia.
The Department said that it was j
turned down by Col. Gen. Sergei S. !
Biryusov, Soviet acting chairman of
the commission, who asserted that
the conduct of the election was the j
exclusive business of the Bulgarian j
government.
AMERICA INTERVENES
Gen. Walker M. Robertson, Amer- J
ican member of the Allied Commis- I
sion, introduced the United States' :
request on Oct. 1 on instructions |
from Secretary of State James F.
Byrnes.
Byrnes himself raised the issue on '
Sept. 24 in a letter to Kimon Geor
giev, president of the Bulgarian !
Council of Ministers, in which he
expressed American interest in the J
fair conduct of the October elcc- |
iions.
BULGARIA EVADES ISSUE
Georgiev replied that his govern- i
ment would see to it that the elec- 1
tions were fair and that government j
militia would be on hand to assure
order. Me also said that his govern- !
ment already has established free
'
dom of the press and free use of the i
radio for opposition parties, and
that opposition public meetings had j
not. been banned.
Biryusov replied on Oct. 4 that !
he was "very much surprised" at !
the American request and regarded
the conduct, of the elections as an [
internal affair of the Bulgarian gov- |
eminent. He pointed out Bul
garian opposition parties, which
boycotted the elections last Nov. 18, ;
have agreed to take part in this I
week's contest.
