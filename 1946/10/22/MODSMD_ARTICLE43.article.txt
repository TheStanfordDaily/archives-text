# Weakened Cardinals Prepare for Trojans
## 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
Hounded by injuries to key members of the squad, Stanford's varsity
footballers risked their all in an intensive scrimmage yesterday afternoon.
George Quist, Harvey Bernhard, and Marty Anderson are all wearing
crutches, and the troubles don't stop there. Bob Rohrer is out with a bad
shoulder, and several of the men who are practicing are wearing bandage?

in various places.
The scrimmage was not of the
dummy variety; the boys were
playing for keeps. Tackling was
sharp, although a few blocks were
missed here and there. The object
was to provide a little more game
experience for the men who haven't
as yet played a great deal.
Most of the first team men were
held*out of the scrum; they went
through signal drill down in the
corner of the field. New faces on
that said first team were Boh
Henry and Babe Iliggins at the
ends, Dick Madigan filling iti for
Harve Bernhard at guard, and
Gene Martin doing the same for
George Quist at right half.
BELL'S KNEE SEEMS OKAY
But the rest of the boys were
snicHking into each other with more
than a modicum of vigor. Ainslee
Bell, trick knee and all, was quar
terbaeking one team without any
visible ill effects. He connected
with several fine passes, one beauty
snuggling down into Mel Kendall's
arms in the end zone.
Joe (Buddy) Scott, made over in
to a tackle earlier this season, was
switched back to center to help fill
the gap left by Pete August. He
was doing quite well backing up the
line, thank you. Also showing well
at center were Fred Willey, a re
formed halfback.
Within three plays after the
start of the donnybrook all the

hoys were so muddied up their
best girls wouldn't have recog
nized them. It seems the field was
watered down earlier in the af
ternoon. Take it easy, hoys, Ore
gon State comes AFTER the Tro
jans.
CKAIIAN AT FULLBACK
At fullback on the gray team was
Jack Crahan, who hasn't seen a
great deal of action this season. He's
a big strong boy who needs nothing
but a little experience—which was
n't forthcoming while he had three
good men ahead of him. But Marty
Anderson is out, Gene Martin is
running at right half—and Lloyd
Merriman can't play all the time,
iron man though he is. Crahan was
running with power and blocking
with authority; he may be just tin
man to fill the bill.
This is the first time since the be
ginning of the season that Marchie
has taken a chance on a scrimmage.
But the erstwhile timid Trojans are
terrific again, and the boys needed
the work. There'll be more hard
drills before the week is out.
