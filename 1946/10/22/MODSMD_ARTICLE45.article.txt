# Traditional USC Pajamarino Returns; Frosh Men to Parade Friday Evening
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
Focusing attention on the return
of class spirit, pajama-clad males
of the class of oO will sport the lat
est and loudest in after-dark attire
for the return of the traditional Pa
jainarino Friday night.
The annual parade and rally was
shelved by Stanford during the war
years, but Sue Sargent and Ted

Holcomb, co-chairman of the event,
expect Friday's escapade to live up
to pre-war ratings.
ANNUAL EVENT
The Pajamarino, a pre-requisite
to the USC Kiuiie, has always afford
ed imaginative freshmen an oppor
tunity to show their dormant spirit.
In the 'HO's, an ambitious class ran
a ten-mile marathon, while a later

group of frosh males broke into the
inner sanctum of Roble.
All freshmen boys are to meet at
the top of the row at 7 p.m. Friday
attired in pajamas. The band will
march with them in a torchlight
procession down to the Pavilion
where the remainder of the student
body will already have gathered.
TO SERENADE WOMEN
All men will sit on the Encina side
of the gym, the women opposite
them, and the freshmen boys on the
floor.
Giving all freshmen women time
to return to Roble, the boys will
follow shortly, entertaining the wo
men with a serenade. The women
will reply in song.
FREE MOVIE FOR BOYS
Doors to the Varsity Theatre will
open at 8:30 for a free movie for the
freshmen boys. The aflair begin
ning at 9 will be strictly stag.
Men will be required to wear pa
jamas and carry a student body
card in order to see "The Spirit of
Stanford" starring Frankie Albert.
Cheer leaders will also be present
at the Varsity.
