# "I" Club Discusses University Systems
## 
### 
That Stanford students want
more of a chance to delve into the
humanities was shown when Inter
national Club members discussed
"What's Wrong with American Col
leges and Universities?" at their
meeting Sunday evening.
The discussion followed the club's
first banquet of the year, where
members feasted on Mexican meat
balls, frijoles, and tortillas.
Thereafter "I" Club, headed by a
three-man panel, picked the Ameri
can university system apart and put
it back together again the way
they'd like to see it. Miss Helen
Schrader, assistant debate director
at Stanford, and Mr. Dow Carpenter
and Mr. Frank Church, both Stan
ford students, made up the panel.
SUBJECT MATTER STRESSED
Dow pointed out that many stu
dents come to the university with
the idea that it is necessary to have
a degree to get a good job. "So they
take an econ class to make good on
the stock market or to have a step
ping stone to business.
"Or else they go to college just
for the sake of going to college. As
a result they have led the univer
sities to stress subject matter rath
er than give a cultural background,"
ho said.
Supporting this argument, French
quoted a Stanford student in one of
his classes as saying when the bell
had rung, "This class is sure a
hope to earn a living from poly sci?"
COURSES CONDENSED
"I" Club members who were en
gineering students complained that
they didn't have enough electives
in the engineering course itself nor
did they have a chance to take the
courses in humanities that they
would like to.
An Indian student expressed the
dilemma of many university stu
dents when he said, "The trouble is
not with the things taught but with
too much quantity. In one hour the
professor talks about Plato, Aris
totle, and Socrates and expects you
to know about them, but it can't be
done.
"By the time I get through Plato
and reading all about him, the pro
fessor is talking about the Chris
tian Era. And by the time I catch
up with my Western Civilization I
am behind in economics and Eng
lish."
DEMOCRACY QUESTIONED
Whether or not American colleges
and universities were promoting a
democratic spirit was contested by
several members. One student
pointed out that the university tried
to provide the mechanics of de
mocracy but that students needed
to be taught to think, to see issues
clearly.
He added, "We need more classes
where the professor has to be ready
to prove every point, where he has
to meet questions from a majority
of students."
The students themselves were
criticized for their apathy and for
a lack of critical attitude. The fact
that only 11 per cent of Stanford's
student body went to the polls to
vote was mentioned to show the
students' indifference.
FRIENDLY RELATIONSHIP
Good features of the American
university system included the
chance for a friendly, helpful, and
cordial relationship between the
student and the professor and the
co-educational system; "which goes

into the making of a well-rounded
personality."
The fact that a great number of
students can go to college and can
study in the field that they are most
interested in was also pointed out
as a strong point in American col
leges. •
However, it was argued that less
emphasis on grade getting and cur
riculum, on compulsory attendance
of classes would be an asset. "When
we are old enough to go to college
it seems that it's up to us whether
we want to go to class or not or
absorb the material or not," French
stated.

Good features of the American
university system included the
chance for a friendly, helpful, and
cordial relationship between the
student and the professor and the
co-educational system; "which goes

into the making of a well-rounded
personality."
The fact that a great number of
students can go to college and can
study in the field that they are most
interested in was also pointed out
as a strong point in American col
leges. •
However, it was argued that less
emphasis on grade getting and cur
riculum, on compulsory attendance
of classes would be an asset. "When
we are old enough to go to college
it seems that it's up to us whether
we want to go to class or not or
absorb the material or not," French
stated.
That Stanford students want
more of a chance to delve into the
humanities was shown when Inter
national Club members discussed
"What's Wrong with American Col
leges and Universities?" at their
meeting Sunday evening.
The discussion followed the club's
first banquet of the year, where
members feasted on Mexican meat
balls, frijoles, and tortillas.
Thereafter "I" Club, headed by a
three-man panel, picked the Ameri
can university system apart and put
it back together again the way
they'd like to see it. Miss Helen
Schrader, assistant debate director
at Stanford, and Mr. Dow Carpenter
and Mr. Frank Church, both Stan
ford students, made up the panel.
SUBJECT MATTER STRESSED
Dow pointed out that many stu
dents come to the university with
the idea that it is necessary to have
a degree to get a good job. "So they
take an econ class to make good on
the stock market or to have a step
ping stone to business.
"Or else they go to college just
for the sake of going to college. As
a result they have led the univer
sities to stress subject matter rath
er than give a cultural background,"
ho said.
Supporting this argument, French
quoted a Stanford student in one of
his classes as saying when the bell
had rung, "This class is sure a
hope to earn a living from poly sci?"
COURSES CONDENSED
"I" Club members who were en
gineering students complained that
they didn't have enough electives
in the engineering course itself nor
did they have a chance to take the
courses in humanities that they
would like to.
An Indian student expressed the
dilemma of many university stu
dents when he said, "The trouble is
not with the things taught but with
too much quantity. In one hour the
professor talks about Plato, Aris
totle, and Socrates and expects you
to know about them, but it can't be
done.
"By the time I get through Plato
and reading all about him, the pro
fessor is talking about the Chris
tian Era. And by the time I catch
up with my Western Civilization I
am behind in economics and Eng
lish."
DEMOCRACY QUESTIONED
Whether or not American colleges
and universities were promoting a
democratic spirit was contested by
several members. One student
pointed out that the university tried
to provide the mechanics of de
mocracy but that students needed
to be taught to think, to see issues
clearly.
He added, "We need more classes
where the professor has to be ready
to prove every point, where he has
to meet questions from a majority
of students."
The students themselves were
criticized for their apathy and for
a lack of critical attitude. The fact
that only 11 per cent of Stanford's
student body went to the polls to
vote was mentioned to show the
students' indifference.
