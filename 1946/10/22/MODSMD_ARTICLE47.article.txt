# New Expansion Aids Art Study
## 
### 
Two new classrooms are being
built for Stanford's Art Department
in space directly adjacent to the Art
Gallery. The Art Department has
expanded greatly and the graphic
arts building can no longer accom
modate the classes.
The new rooms are taking the
place of the arcade to the east side
of the gallery. They are high and
narrow and are equipped with sky
lights.
Space in this part of the Art Gal
lery has formerly been used by
various other departments includ
ing the Music Department. The mu
sic Department has also expanded
and to find more space has moved
its classrooms to The Knoll.
Stanford's Art Gallery will open
this morning with its second ex
hibit of the year.
The display includes 50 prints
owned by Stanford, some of which
are from the collections of David
Starr Jordan and Mrs. Michael
Stein.
The new exhibit will be up until
Nov. 10.
