### 
An intrepid Daily reporter, brav
ing all perils, today obtained the
first interview with Lena the Hyena,
Miss Lower Slobovia of 1946. Serv
ices will be held tomorrow in the
Chapel.
Just before he passed on. the mar
tyred Grunion Q. Schmeckenlip did
manage to record the following
words from Lena's lips(?): "%. &&
% !*■ *! W)&—!»&t — !*&—(/P) ♦
Roughly translated, with the in
valueless aid of S. Shpetner, no
doubt world-renowned language ex
pert (Nee how-mah!), Miss Hyena
had this to say: "I am leaving im
mediately on my native Slobovian
pogo stick for Stanfordeski Univer
sitat because I hear that*the long
awaited Stanford Chaparral will
finally be on sale tomorrow. I must
get there before they are sold out."'
For Lena's information, the Daily
authoritatively learned today that
the Chappie will be sold at the Post
Office, the Cellar, Engineering cor
ner, History corner, and Inner Quad
near the Memorial Court Wednes
day morning only.
There is absolutely no truth to
the rumor that a picture of Mrs.
Hight will be given away with ev
ery purchase, Business Manager
Boris Wolper announced.
