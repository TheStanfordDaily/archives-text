all but unknown to Napa residents
until RKO descended on the town.
After they had participated in the
production of the movie, the people
of Napa were very sorry that the
world premiere was not held there.

the play in the public library. He
saw clearly why the premiere was
not there, as you who go to see the
play tonight will understand.

NAI'A VALLEY LOCALE
Napa Valley is the locale for the
play, but it took the RKO Studio's
movie version to make the people of
that valley realize it. The sad, com
ic love and marriage of Tony Pa
tucci and Amy, the waitress, were
all but unknown to Napa residents
until RKO descended on the town.
After they had participated in the
production of the movie, the people
of Napa were very sorry that the
world premiere was not held there.
Then one of the citizens looked up
the play in the public library. He
saw clearly why the premiere was
not there, as you who go to see the
play tonight will understand.
