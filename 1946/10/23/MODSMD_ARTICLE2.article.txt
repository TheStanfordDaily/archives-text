# 'Humor' Talk Modern Tale
## 
### 
Humor had its hour last night
when Dr. Rudolph Altrocchi, au
thor and educator, discussed "Prim
itive Varieties" at the Tuesday Eve
ning Series program in Memorial
Hall auditorium.
.The chairman of the Italian de
partment at the University of Cali
fornia broke humor down into com
ponent parts, embellished each with
adequate illustrations, and then
neatly put it back together again.
Dr. Altrocchi traced the various
threads of humor down through the
ages, showing that humor of today
is essentially the humor of 19 or 20
centuries ago.
Refusing to frame any definition
of humor, Dr. Altrocchi explained,
"The greatest concepts are allergic
to definition; God and women are
defined only with difficulty."
The professor did point to incon
gruity as the basis for the world's
humor. And in spite of current ar
guments to the contrary, Dr. Al
trocchi made every assurance that
humor does exist, pointing to laugh
ter as its most obvious manifesta
tion.
The Cal professor, author of
"Sleuthing in the Stacks," defined
wit as "manufactured incongruity
with a barb."
"There is a cleverness and a clash
of meanness in wit; the incongruity
is never accidental."
Aiming his own barb at present
day humorists, Dr. Altrocchi said,
"The making of humor in our time
and country has been standardized.
It is sold by the gross to the gross
for the gross."â€”Haight
