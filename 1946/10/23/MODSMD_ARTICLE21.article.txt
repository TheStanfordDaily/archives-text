## Too Much for Too Few 
### 
The protagonists of two problems existing
on campus these days ought to get together.
All tho little groups on campus— profes
sional societies, hobby clubs, and campus ac
tivity committees are barely continuing their
troubled little existences for lack of interested
members and because they have rarely got
ten together to coordinate any activities
which will have vital uppeol or consequences
to th.• campus as a whole.
On th > other hand, there are literally hun
drod;, of students with the experience, inclina
lion or downright eagerness which would
qualify them to fill out the membership of
these clubs but they don't 'know what club
i:. what or why, or how or where or when.
Sighting these problems and the obvious
solution, three organizations on campus have
begun the groundwoik to set up an activities
iilc and orientation program for all students
Who are interested. Cap and Gown is collect
ing I he information from each extra-curricular
group about its program, facilities, purposes,
rin-i qualifications for membership. The Y.W.

C.A had already planned lo reconvert its rela
tively ineflective leadership forum into a
ground-up orientation program for women.
And the Know-Youi Stanford student commit
tee has formulated tentative plans to extend
the program to those areas throughout the
campus which have need of it.
Sidelight on their plans is the registration
of all students who have <j particular talent or
willingness tu work, on which Cardinals or
lixcom and similar all-campus groups tan feel
free to call at any time. This would be a re
vitalized version of the Cardinals activity file
which passed away some quarters ago.
The plan will require people to work, com
piling repoits, interviewing, and speaking in
living group areas about the existing oppor
tunities for extra-curricular activity. It will
necessitate a permanent committee to perpetu
ate the program. So we recommend that the
A.S.S.U. assume the over all organizational
rights of the program, and see if two bewild
ered campus groups those who sponsor ac
tivities and those who are searching for them
can get together, and soon.
