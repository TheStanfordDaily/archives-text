With over 1,000 students in Bianner, Toyon,
and Encina, the single Toyon switchboard is
being worked to capacity and is not providing
Ihe .service which conditions demand. Pre
viou ly, when the number of students serv
iced totaled less than '730. two switchboards
w<- < utilized to handle the demand. Now,
with more students using the lines, the op
erators are expected to struggle along with
one board.
Nine appeals have been made to the Ad
nimistiation during the fiist four weeks of the
quarter for an additional switchboard, but
thus far no positive answer or indication as
to a course of action has been forthcoming.
Meanwhile, local telephone officials assure
our opera Vrs that an additional board can be
obtained il conditions warrant it. Yet requests
for a traffic check on the Toyon board have
brought no results.

An interesting sidelight to the problem is
the fact that Branner, Toyon, and Encina are
without telephone communication between 12
noon and 6 p.m. on Saturdays because of a
shortage of student operators who are willing
to work during those hours. Civilian opera
tors will not fill this gap because of the low
wage scale under which they would have
to woik.
The problem seems insignificant when
compared with other University problems,
and yet it is of immediate importance to at
least one-seventh of the student body. The
need for an additional switchboard is obvious
to anyone who has ever attempted to place
a call through the single board's 10 out-going
lines. The decision as to whether or not an
additional board should be installed certainly
does not require four weeks' consideration. —
