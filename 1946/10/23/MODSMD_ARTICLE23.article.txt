# BILL COUGHLIN
## BULL SESSION 
### 
TYrhaps some of you noted the "SC" lhat was
burned on the lawn in front of the Ad Building pre
ceding last weekend's Santa Clara fracas. The deed
was done by some Santa Clara lads who arrived in
a hi*! black convertible, committed the foul deed
and disappeared back to their corral.
Some of our Stanford stalwarts decided that such
mi ollen.se deserved appropriate retaliation. Armed
with cans of kerosene and accompanied by two of
the Farm's fair sex, they headed southward in several
ears.
One at Iheir first problems was lo convince an
inquiring priest that they weren't Santa Clarans
trying lo sneak a couple of girls up to their rooms.
That hazard past, they proceeded with their plot.
A bewildered Bronco who stumbled upon them
"Was rather confused by wlial they were doing and
paused lo watch. One of the Stanfordites, mistaking
him for a fellow conspirator, handed him a can of
gasoline to hold.
'llit* Santa Claran obligingly held it for a while
and ihen, doing a quick double-take on the proceed
ing;, began lo souyd the alarm. Most of our men
(and women) escaped but four male unfortunates
wen captured. Two of them managed to convince
their captors that they were Paly Ili lads and, after
much questioning, were released. The other I wo, not
quite so glib, had their heads shaved.
But the expedition was successful, there was an

"SU" burned in ihe Santa Clara quad, and if flit?
two kids keep llieir hats on, no one will bo the
wiser.

Three of our more prominent Farm femmes got a
little bored in a lecture the other day and decided
to liven the proceedings up a bit. So they wrote
a very, very witty little petition stating that the pro!
was "illogical, stupid," etc., to which they signed
their names. Wanting all to share the benefits of
iheir great wit, they passed it around the class.
One of our quicker-minded lads slipped the fold
ed, signed paper into his pocket and, without the
hilarious trio seeing him, also slipped a similarly
folded piece of paper into the same pocket.
At the end of the class, making sure the funny
femmes saw him, he handed the similar-looking but
blank piece of paper to the prof. Naturally, the three
some assumed it was their signed petition berating
the prof and they went into a complete panic.
As the prof began to unfold the paper, one of the
threesome dashed up, snatched it out of his hand,
and rushed out the door, leaving a much-bewildered
professor silting with hi;-; mouth open, wondering
what was going on.
The three 8.W.0.C.'s still haven't quite recovered
from the shock of it all and have threatened to
mangle the lad who committed such a nasty mean
trick on them.

Three of our more prominent Farm femmes got a
little bored in a lecture the other day and decided
to liven the proceedings up a bit. So they wrote
a very, very witty little petition stating that the pro!
was "illogical, stupid," etc., to which they signed
their names. Wanting all to share the benefits of
iheir great wit, they passed it around the class.
One of our quicker-minded lads slipped the fold
ed, signed paper into his pocket and, without the
hilarious trio seeing him, also slipped a similarly
folded piece of paper into the same pocket.
At the end of the class, making sure the funny
femmes saw him, he handed the similar-looking but
blank piece of paper to the prof. Naturally, the three
some assumed it was their signed petition berating
the prof and they went into a complete panic.
As the prof began to unfold the paper, one of the
threesome dashed up, snatched it out of his hand,
and rushed out the door, leaving a much-bewildered
professor silting with hi;-; mouth open, wondering
what was going on.
The three 8.W.0.C.'s still haven't quite recovered
from the shock of it all and have threatened to
mangle the lad who committed such a nasty mean
trick on them.
TYrhaps some of you noted the "SC" lhat was
burned on the lawn in front of the Ad Building pre
ceding last weekend's Santa Clara fracas. The deed
was done by some Santa Clara lads who arrived in
a hi*! black convertible, committed the foul deed
and disappeared back to their corral.
Some of our Stanford stalwarts decided that such
mi ollen.se deserved appropriate retaliation. Armed
with cans of kerosene and accompanied by two of
the Farm's fair sex, they headed southward in several
ears.
One at Iheir first problems was lo convince an
inquiring priest that they weren't Santa Clarans
trying lo sneak a couple of girls up to their rooms.
That hazard past, they proceeded with their plot.
A bewildered Bronco who stumbled upon them
"Was rather confused by wlial they were doing and
paused lo watch. One of the Stanfordites, mistaking
him for a fellow conspirator, handed him a can of
gasoline to hold.
'llit* Santa Claran obligingly held it for a while
and ihen, doing a quick double-take on the proceed
ing;, began lo souyd the alarm. Most of our men
(and women) escaped but four male unfortunates
