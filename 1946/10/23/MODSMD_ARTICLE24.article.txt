B A I.LOTS AWAY!
November is in the air, election day draws close,
and we are about to be engulfed by the traditional
smear tactics without which no campaign seems to
be complete.
Here's a bet on which I am willing lo take all
comers and give 100:1 odds: the Republierats are
going lo win. Regardless of whether the Republicans
do or don't pick up a few more seats (and the former
■ eeins likely) the policies ol Congress won't change
Very much.
The same conservative group, the same effective
combination of Republicans at id southern Democrats,
will continue to wield power in Ihe 80th Congress as
it did in what is now called Ihe Wreck of the 791h.
Such unradical publications as the S.F. Chronicle
and "Time" agreed with their little brothers on Ihe
hit that the performance of the 79th was pitiful. It
ranged from almost normal misdemeanor on the
Poll Tax Bill to assault with intent to kill price con
trol.
The strange cure advocated by mosl papers is
more of the same. For while they point out (or did
until they caught election fever) that much of our
Congressional trouble stems from Ihe conservative
coalition, they urge you without batting an eyelash
to make it more conservative. One way to relieve
a man with a sore throat from pain is to cut off his
head.

Devoid, as usual, of clear-cut party issues, the
election sinks to Ihe unreliable level of voting for
personalities. Even this is not, always an issue—in
one fourth of the country the elections are, for prac
tical purposes, over. Thai's the South, Maine, and
Vermont.
In many other the people are democratically
given the choice of two politicians, both equally use
less. In some campaigns, however, there is a real
clash behind the tumult and shouting.
In Montana, for instance, Lief Erickson is trying
to beat 1 Anaconda and Montana Power ~a big order.
He is ;iid''d by disunity among the Republicans, a
large part of whom (including Governor Ford) are
prul of Democrat Burton Wheeler's machine.
In California, Will Rogers, Jr., is campaigning
on an outspokenly liberal platform against OPA-foe
Knowland. Here it, is more than a battle of words
lor ihe record is available. Rogers, in the term he
served in Congress before enlisting in the army, voted
consistently on the liberal side. Analysts, who usu
ally take u gloomy view of Congressional activities,
applauded the fight of a small handful of liberals
like Rogers.
Knowland, also a World War II vet, appointed by
Warren to till the term of Hiram Johnson, has a
l aii ly consistent conservative record, climaxed by his
fight against price controls. Think of him when you
pay $1 HI lor butler, and $1 30 a pound for steak.
