# '50 Frosh Frolic Friday, Revive Farm Tradition
## 
### 
This Friday evening the '50 frosh will make a stab at reviving one of
the Farm's famousest old traditions —The Freshman Pajamarino. The Pa-,
jamarino was starved out during the war by the freshman famine, but this

year's bumper crop at the "Encina
sylum" has prompted a resurrection
of tjic annual frosh frolic.
The old-timers wilt sadly I<• 11
you tile I'ajamarino ain't what it
used to was in the days when men
were men on the Earm, and tlx*
whole freshman class met in room
IliOO. 'those were the days. Then
tin* Pajamarino was a hell-rais
ing torchlight |>ee-raid that was a
blood brother of Sherman's March
(o the Sea.
With flaming torches and scream
ing sirens, the frisky frosh capered
up the How and extorted apples
from the benevolent D.U.'s. Then
they descended on a barricaded Ro
ble to "serenade" the cowering co
eds.
In those days there was a blight
on the moolah trees, ami it wasn't
until alter the class of '36 had de
molished three Paly theaters that
the custom of free movies got
started. It was just cheaper to hold
open house than to remodel after
ihe Pajamarino raided (he shows.
The Pajamarino is almost as old
as Stanford itself. It was first held
way back in 1904 when a noisy
freshman in the"Camp" (the Vil
lage is nothing new) was singing in
the tub after everyone else had gone
to bed. Before long the poor green
horn was running for his life with
the angry mob hot on his heels.
Up Alvarado and down Salva

ing in (he breeze. The howling
crowd grew as it passed each
sleeping house, and pretty soon
half the campus was running
around in its sleep-suits. They
never did catch the kid, but every
year since, the freshmen have
blown off steam by traipsing
around in their nighties.
