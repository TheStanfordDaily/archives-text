## Card Stunts 
### 
I know this is going to kill you,
but this trumpeter is turning into a
crusader as of light now. Crusade
lor what? Greyhound racing? Ping
pong? Indoor sports? No, but al
most.
It's minor sports, anil I don't
think some of them are receiving
enough interest or credit for what
they're worth, ISy far the greater
percentage of men on (his campus
who play anything are in some
minor sport, and being neglected
shamefully by the rest of the stu
dent body.
Let's start with the water polo
learn and swimmers in general. Now
that Cal Rossi broke his leg a week
too late to help us any, and it
doesn't look like Stanford will make
the Pacific Coast Football Cham
pionship this year, you don't have
to despair. There's one Pacific Coast
title the Indians should walk oft
with this season, and that's water
polo.
So far the Cards not only lead the j
league, but look like a mighty sure j
bet for the Pacific Coast Champion
ship this season.. And no wonder
with the healthy aggregation of
stars around.
Take the captain of the team,
for instance; Enunett Cashin broke
two world records at Stanford
before the war when he cut the
200-yard and 200-meter time by
!{ and seconds respectively.
Although the National Associa
tion hasn't met since the end of
the war to recognize his new rec- i
ords, his two titles are official.
And then there's A 1 Weeden of
the poloists, who took fifth place in j
the national 100-meter backstroke j
this summer. Together with the |
high-scorers of the team, Jim Arm
strong arid Harry Borchers, this out- J
fit looks really good, and is going J
places.
Also there's a man around the j
pool who got quite a break this
week. Fred Taioli, who took three |
second places in the AAU outdoor
championships at Sail Diego this j
summer, has received and accept
ed an invitation from Australia to
go there next spring for the Aus
tralian championships. He will lly
down under, with the Aussies
paying all the expenses. Not bad,
eh?
Why, even Coach Tom Haynie of j
the poloists held some six national
AAU titles and seven intercollegiate |
top-spots while at Michigan before i
the war. Look at it any way you I
want to, but Stanford has got top |
material around the water polo and I
swimming leagues, and there's no !
maybe about that.

1 think that Mickey Titus has his i
Work cut out for him this Saturday j
against U.S.C. With George Quist, j
lhc ace line-backer, out of the pic- j
lure, young Mickey will have a
great chance to show if he's as good j
as he's indicated so far.
Alternating with Gene Martin
and Freddy Parsons at right half
back positions, Titus should have
ample opportunity to prove his po
tentialities. Although he is in his
first year of college football, Titus
has been heading uphill fast this j
season, and gaining experience
every game as he is, should make
Marchy Schwartz very happy that
he's on our side.

Last week's Bronco scrap had
bad after-effects for me. Seems like
I stuck my neck out, and offered to i
pay freight charges home for the
Santa Clara boys if our team would
lasso them and tie them up secure
ly. Had a heck of a time at the Post
Office Saturday night; they said my j
little package hadn't been wrapped j
up tight enough.
I don't think so either, so will
the football team please use more
rope next Saturday when they
try to tic up the wooden horse
from Los Angeles. I hated that
embarrassing trouble at the Post
Office Saturday night,
