# Dr. Bailey Presents Ballads, Folk Songs at Poetry Reading
## 
### 
Margery Bailey can put on a great show. Yesterday afternoon she sang
<>!<! English folk songs and ballads to a large and appreciative audience in
the second of this quarter's poetry readings.
She first distinguished between folk songs and ballads. Folk songs
merely suggest a story, ballads tell one. Both employ the use of repetitious
verse. Both are authorless. ♦

She likened the folk song to the
drinking songs composed by the col
lege men of her day around the
table at some bar in Menlo. They
lake a melody and make up end
less verses to it.
Her first ballad was "Hangman,
Mold Your Hand," a sad story of
a Kentucky mountaineer whose
family repudiates him on the scaf
fold but whose lover saves him.
Dr. Bailey said that this situation
is inevitable in most ballads—the
pull between the family and the
true-love.
Her best act came in the singing
of "My Man, John." She sang the
roles of the stupid suitor, the arro
gant servant, and the disdainful
maiden. She was superb in all three
roles.
She then sang of men. Men who
love their girls on the mountains,
leave them with children, then
move on to another mountain.
"They're all alike," she sang.
Dr. Bailey apologized for her
voice. She needn't have. Its husky,
low quality made the songs even
more dramatic.—Milnor
