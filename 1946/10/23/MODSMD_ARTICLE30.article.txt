# All Hands on Deck! Say Card Rowers
## 
### 
Stanford oarsmen will take to the
water in a week, says Stan Cumber
patch, captain of this quarter's crew.
After long months of inactivity
crew members will spend at least
another week in making repairs to
shells and oars before rowing equip
ment can be considered seaworthy
enough to cope with the waters of
the Palo Alto Yacht Harbor.
Rowing practice is scheduled for
six days of the week with individual
members required to turn out on
three of these six days. The four
shells and one practice boat belong
ing to the club will not allow a space
for every crewman, so a definite
limit has been placed on the num-
I cr of men who may turn out at
any one practice session.
Although no schedule has been
made, the first meet will probably
lake place at the first of next quar
ter. Besides the regular varsity
meets, races will be scheduled for
junior varsity and frosh crews also.
Cumherpatch was elected to head
the club for the autumn quarter at
its second meeting, held last night
in the Union Nitery. Other choices
made were Bob Phillips, vice-cap
lain; Mel Savage, secretary-treas
urer; George Bevier, manager, and
Gerry Grunwald. Dick Smith, Stel
Andre, Jim Brannaman, Bob Hoyt,
I ,<>u Pennington, and Tony English,
members of the executive council.
Carl Pederson, mentor of past sea
ons, will take over the coaching
reins ueain this term.
