# Farm Holds Heavy Scrum; Feldman Joins Casualties
## 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
The old Reservation's hopes for a win against the Terrific
Trojans of U.S.C. dropped considerably last night as Marty Feld
man, slated for plenty of duty at various spots along the line,
suffered a pulled thigh muscle during an intensive scrimmage
under the lights. The seriousness of the injury has not yet been
determined.
Feldman, a gigantic 245-pounder, was counted upon to pro-

vide plenty of reserve strength in
I a line that has already lost' three
first stringers in four games—Jim
Cox, Pete August, and llarvey
Bernhard. The replacements have
been adequate enough, but the
injuries have cut deeply into the
depth at each position.
Yesterday's drill, after the us
\ ual calisthenics, started out with
i a live scrimmage against Trojan
plays as diagrammed by scout
Ray Hainmett, who has caught
I the act at the Figueroa Street
Theatre three times this season.
After seeing the southhinders in
| action against Washington last
week. Ray threw away his notes
| on the other two games.
Next March ie called another
I scrum to sharpen up the Redskins'
j bag of tricks, and to provide game
conditions for the youngsters who
have seen little or no action this
year. He might have to call on
some of them this week, and he'd
prefer to know what they can do in
advance.
The bruising contact work last
{ ed until long after the lights were
j turned on. hut came to a screech
| ing half after seven of the lti
rather ineffective bulbs quit try
j ing. But a dummy workout was
continued until 0:30. the regular
quitting time.
A 1 Morris, a rangy qb from San
Francisco, has been switched to
| right half to help take up some of
j the slack left by the injury to
George "Polar Bear" Quist. Freddy
Parsons was checking him out on
his assignments.
Back at fullback again was Gene
Martin, after a day of running at
right half. But Big Gene may split
his time between the two positions;
he knows them both like a book.
Ainslee Bell again got plenty of
offensive drill at qb without seem
ing to favor his knee — Marchie
Schwartz would like nothing better
than to see the southpaw get as of
fensive as possible against his for
mer teammates.

A 1 Morris, a rangy qb from San
Francisco, has been switched to
| right half to help take up some of
j the slack left by the injury to
George "Polar Bear" Quist. Freddy
Parsons was checking him out on
his assignments.
Back at fullback again was Gene
Martin, after a day of running at
right half. But Big Gene may split
his time between the two positions;
he knows them both like a book.
Ainslee Bell again got plenty of
offensive drill at qb without seem
ing to favor his knee — Marchie
Schwartz would like nothing better
than to see the southpaw get as of
fensive as possible against his for
mer teammates.
The old Reservation's hopes for a win against the Terrific
Trojans of U.S.C. dropped considerably last night as Marty Feld
man, slated for plenty of duty at various spots along the line,
suffered a pulled thigh muscle during an intensive scrimmage
under the lights. The seriousness of the injury has not yet been
determined.
Feldman, a gigantic 245-pounder, was counted upon to pro-

vide plenty of reserve strength in
I a line that has already lost' three
first stringers in four games—Jim
Cox, Pete August, and llarvey
Bernhard. The replacements have
been adequate enough, but the
injuries have cut deeply into the
depth at each position.
Yesterday's drill, after the us
\ ual calisthenics, started out with
i a live scrimmage against Trojan
plays as diagrammed by scout
Ray Hainmett, who has caught
I the act at the Figueroa Street
Theatre three times this season.
After seeing the southhinders in
| action against Washington last
week. Ray threw away his notes
| on the other two games.
Next March ie called another
I scrum to sharpen up the Redskins'
j bag of tricks, and to provide game
conditions for the youngsters who
have seen little or no action this
year. He might have to call on
some of them this week, and he'd
prefer to know what they can do in
advance.
The bruising contact work last
{ ed until long after the lights were
j turned on. hut came to a screech
| ing half after seven of the lti
rather ineffective bulbs quit try
j ing. But a dummy workout was
continued until 0:30. the regular
quitting time.
