# Stamm's Boys Point for S.C.
## 
### 
Coach Ed Stamm and his Stanford
Jayvees are pointing for USC —and
they aren't making any bones about
it. The little Indians would like
nothing better than to knock off the
Trojan Bs when they roar into
Stanford Stadium Saturday morn
ing.
The Jayvees are still burning
about that Santa Clara loss and have
been showing more life in practice
this week than they have for some
time. Stamm will drill the squad
the rest of the week on defense,
with the stress on dummy practice
for the linemen, and live tackling
for the backs.
Assistant Coaches Bob Crane and
Lin Wolfe will work with their
backs on kicking and ball-handling
finesse.
The USC Jayvees arc almost an
unknown quantity. Their roster is
shuffled constantly, with men going
to and from the Varsity. But if re
ports from Figueroa Street are ac
curate, the Trojan Jayvees are
loaded with experience and talent.
