# Favored Card Splashers Ready for Trojan Meet
## 
### 
Perched confidently upon the top rung of the Pacific Coast
Conference, the Stanford water polo team will defend its new
won laurels Saturday morning as U.S.C. invades the local pool.
This week's water battle will be the second meeting with
U.S.C. for the Indians, who swamped the southerners, 11-5,
earlier in the season. But the rugged contest down south was a

free-swinging affair which kept
officials constantly busy. So the wild
men from Troy, lacking finesse hut
terrific scrappers, could clip the
high-flying Indians.
Nevertheless, odds will favor the
smooth Farm mermen to repeat
their initial victory. Speed is the
keynote of the strong Indian team,
which consists of a number of the
members of Stanford's champion
ship swimming squad. In fact.
Coaches Tom Haynie and Ernie
Brandsten have difficulty in hiding
optimistic smiles when discussing
Stanford's chances for league hon
ors.
With two lopsided victories al
ready posted over U.C.L.A. and
U.S.C., the Indians are favored to
continue their supremacy over the
southern schools. Also, they should
add California to their list of vic
tims. The Bears showed very little
in dropping a 19-1 decision to the

Olympic Club, which squeezed past
Stanford in an exciting 10-9 game.
Saturday's game in the Encina
pool will officially open the home
schedule of the Indians. After the
expected wild clash with the rug
ged Trojans, local fans will be treat
ed to a renewal of the California
rivalry as the Indians entertain tin-
Bears on Nov. 2.
