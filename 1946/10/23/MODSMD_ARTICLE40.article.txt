# New Research Group Established on Farm

### BRUCE MITCHELL 
Aiding both industry and government in practical research is the aim
oj the new Stanford Research Institute under the direction of William F.
Talbot.
Tlie institute, established here three weeks ago, is not a department ol
the University and will have its own facilities when the unpredictable

building shortage eases. A board of
directors, which will be chosen in
a couple of weeks, will manage the
institute.
With the great growth of industry
on the West Coast, the need for
.such an institute to do research in
industrial fields has been felt. Small
industries will be able to have re
search done in well-equipped labo
ratories although they themselves
cannot afford to purchase the nec
essary equipment.
BUSINESS RESEARCH
Both government and industry
will be able to employ the institute
In do resereh at cost, plus an al
lowance to cover overhead. Almost
any projects will be undertaken by
the institute in fields of practical
research.
In the past most research has
been confined to the experimental
sciences, such as chemistry and bi
ology, but it has not been com
bined with business administration,
personnel relations, and marketing.
At the present time several of these
institutes are in existence in the
East, such as the Mellon Institute,
but this is the first one of its kind
on ihe West Coast.
SEPARATE STAFF
The institute is now using the
facilities and •personnel of the Uni
versity in its projects; however, it
plans to have its own staff and
facilities in due time. It is now
working on a project relating to
detergents for a New York chemical
concern.
Mr. Talbot, director of the re
search institute, received the Ph.D.
in chemistry at the State University
(»112 lowa. He has been employed by
the Du Pont Company, Gustavus J.
Esselen Company, and Dennison
Manufacturing Company. He came
to Stanford from the Sun Chemical
Corporation where he was technical
director and president of the fine
chemicals division. These concerns
are all in the East.
