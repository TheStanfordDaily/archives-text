# Mural Debate Favors Labor
## 
### 
The team of Carpenter - Stanton
defeated Natunewitz - Mallory yes
terday in the opening contest of the
intramural tourney held by Stan
ford debaters.
The tourney deals with the ques
tion, "Resolved, that labor should
be given a share in the management
of industry."
Stanton and Carpenter, speaking
on the affirmative side of the issue,
advocated a guaranteed annual
wage as a step toward labor peace.
Mallory and Natunewitz main
tained that labor was already too
powerful and should be curbed by
legislation, especially by laws for
bidding the closed shop. This will
make labor socially responsible,
they held.
Other contests this week include
Hawkes-Garrison vs. Crede-Newton
at 8 tonight in room 200S, and Kel
ton-Abelson vs. Carey-Mueller to
morrow afternoon. Tonight's clash
will be judged by Helen Schraeder,
assistant debate coach.
