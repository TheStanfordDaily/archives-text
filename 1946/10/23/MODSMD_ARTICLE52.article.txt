squat, no squint) locations.
Gorgeous, eager young freshman girls will he on the job to see that
everyone gets theirs. Stations have been set up at the Post Oflice, the
Cellar, the Engineering Corner, History Corner, and the Inner Quad
near Memorial Court, at which adolescent, honor-lacking, ill-bred, in
considerate, demanding, condescending, snobbish, hard-drinking, quick
eating, bird-putting. Republican-voting, Esquire-reading, Cadillac-driv
ing, check-skipping Stanford gentlemen and ladies can purchase $2,500
worth of Toy and entertainment for a measly 2. r > cents.
