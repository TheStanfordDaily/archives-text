# Student Lawyers Vie Tonight In Second Moot Court Trial
## 
### 
The second preliminary trial of Stanford's Moot Court will be held this
evening at 7:30 in room 100 of the Law School.
The object of the Moot Court is to give law students practical training
in preparing appellate briefs and speaking orally in appellate court.
All second-year law students are given an opportunity to participate
in the Moot Court preliminary trials. Teams of two men each are assigned
to both sides of a hypothetical case, which is given to them in the form of
a judgment handed down by a lower court on an agreed state of facts.

Each team prepares a written
argument in the form of a Brief
on Appeal and presents an oral
argument to a court consisting of
three "judges," two of whom are
third-year law students and one
â–  an outside lawyer.
Individual grades are given to
each "lawyer" and at the end of the
preliminary trials the 12 students
1 receiving the highest grades par-
I ticipate in another series of trials.
! The second trials are similar to the
j preliminary ones, except the writ
ten briefs and oral arguments are
j more elaborate and require more
| research and work on the part of
! the participants.

; nation trials, four are chosen to en
ter the final competition in which
! the briefs and arguments are very
i elaborate. Judges of the final trials
i will be a member of the California
I Supreme Court and two San Fran

ond of which is being presented
