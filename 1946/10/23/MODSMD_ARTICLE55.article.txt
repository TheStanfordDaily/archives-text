# Peace Without Bombâ€”Newell
## 
### 
A world government must .settle
international difficulties without the
use of the atom bomb, according
to Dr. Robert Newell, Stanford
Medical School physicist and a mem
ber of the radiological safety sec
tion at the Bikini atom bomb tests.
Dr. Newell spoke at the Biological
Science Department's weekly sem
inar.
Should any nation choose to use
the atom homhli it would be the
only one to survive, according to
the physicist. A nation would
stand to lose more by such a war
than it would by an adverse de
cision of a central government,
Dr. Newell also stated that "per
sons who die late from the effects of
radioactivity do so from destruction
of the bone marrow, the blood-pro
ducing organ."
