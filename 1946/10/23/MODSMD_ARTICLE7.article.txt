# Lewis's Contract Lags; Strike Looms
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 22 (UP).
John L. Lewis tonight threatened a
countrywide strike of 400,000 soft
coal miners Nov. 1 unless the gov
ernment meets his demand to re
open its contract with his United
Mine Workers on that date.
The UMW president, who asked
Secretary of the Interior J. A. Krug
yesterday to start new wage negoti
ations under the contract within 10
days, said in a letter to Krug to
night:
"Failure on your part to honor
this meeting will constitute another
breach of the contract, and will void
the Kiug-Lewis agreement."
