FLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y.,
Oct. 23 (UP). — President Tru
man warned the United Nations
at the opening of a historic gen
eral assembly today that they
must wipe out a fear of war
which has spread all over the
world.
To this end, the President said
as he addressed the delegates of
51 nations, the great powers inusl
speed up completion of World
War II treaties with ex-enemy
nations including Germany and
Japan so that the l!N can consoli
date peace on a lasting basis.
Assembly President Paul-Henri
Spaak opened this first annual gen
eral assembly to be held in the
United Slates at 4:18 p.m. EST and
after the brief formal opening cere
mony Mr. Truman, wearing a dark
blue double-breasted suit, started
his speech to warm applause.
CO-OPERATION NEEDED
It was a speech which warned
the UN earnestly that nearly 115
months after V-J Day the world
situation still is urgently serious.
It warned the big powers that they
piust work together efficiently and
without bickering to avoid fresh
disaster.
But the President at the same
time expressed a confident belief
that no country or people wanted
war, that there would be no war,
and that by good will and hard work
the world may look forward to a
better future.
President Truman said frankly:
A"VIERICA NS TR< >tJRI.ED
"... I must tell you that the
American people are troubled by
the failure of the Allied nations to
make more progress in their com
mon search for lasting peace. . . .
"The United Nations- as an or
ganization was not intended to .set
tle the problems arising immediately
out of the war. The United Nations
was intended to provide the means
for maintaining international peace
in the future after just settlement of
these problems was deliberately
consigned to negotiations among the
Allies as distinguished from the
United Nations. . . .
TREATIES FIRST STEP
"The United Nations cannot . . .
fulfill adequately its own respon
sibilities until the peace settle
ments have been made and unless
these settlements form a solid
foundation upon which to build a
permanent peace."
