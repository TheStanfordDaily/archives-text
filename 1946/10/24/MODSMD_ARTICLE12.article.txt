# Prize Play Scores Hit
## 
### 
Stanford's new Studio Theater
opened its first season of full pro
ductions with a fine performance of
Sidney Howard's play, "They Knew
What They Wanted," last night in
the Little Theater.
LAUGH-WINNER
Mr. Howard's play may lw a Pu
litzer Prize-winner of WI2 1 !, but the
laughs were still laughs to a some
what world-wearier 10-K! audience.
It is nice to think back to those
good old days before the atom
bomb, when people were only just
beginning to worry about Russia
and ihe Communists.
People are still people in the long
run, and especially in Napa Valley
where things don't change very
much over the years.
HANSEN, ROBERTSON GOOD
Exceptional performances in the
production were turned in by Mer
rill Hansen as Tony and Lorna Rob
ertson as Amy. Mr. Hanson not
only carried oil tlio. difficult. Italo-
Ameriean dialect with skill and ges
ture, but gave his role feeling and
the true Italian spirit.
Miss Robertson was an appealing
and thoroughly emotional Amy.
She never let the long emotional
scenes drop, and carried the mood
of the play along in those difficult
long speeches which the role de
mands.
SUPPORTERS ALSO GOOD
Capable supporting performances
were given by Newton Arnold as
the cynical doctor and Joseph Dye
as Father MeKee, the dogmatic and
somewhat illiterate parish priest.
Allen Fletcher, as Joe the fore
man, seemed miscast to this review
er although he carried through his
part with precision. A more robust
Joe, with a larger touch of brutal
ity, seemed ordered in contrast to
Tony's big-heart edness.
CREDIT TO DIRECTOR
Credit should also go to Marjoric
Walsh, the director of "They Knew
What They Wanted," for tlie play
was, except for the usual first-night
slip-ups, a good solid performance.

HEART TROUBLE?
DETROIT, Oct. 23 (UP).-A Lon
don surgeon today described a car
diac massage method for reviving
patients whose hearts have stopped
while they are on the operating
table.
Stanford's new Studio Theater
opened its first season of full pro
ductions with a fine performance of
Sidney Howard's play, "They Knew
What They Wanted," last night in
the Little Theater.
LAUGH-WINNER
Mr. Howard's play may lw a Pu
litzer Prize-winner of WI2 1 !, but the
laughs were still laughs to a some
what world-wearier 10-K! audience.
It is nice to think back to those
good old days before the atom
bomb, when people were only just
beginning to worry about Russia
and ihe Communists.
People are still people in the long
run, and especially in Napa Valley
where things don't change very
much over the years.
HANSEN, ROBERTSON GOOD
Exceptional performances in the
production were turned in by Mer
rill Hansen as Tony and Lorna Rob
ertson as Amy. Mr. Hanson not
only carried oil tlio. difficult. Italo-
Ameriean dialect with skill and ges
ture, but gave his role feeling and
the true Italian spirit.
Miss Robertson was an appealing
and thoroughly emotional Amy.
She never let the long emotional
scenes drop, and carried the mood
of the play along in those difficult
long speeches which the role de
mands.
SUPPORTERS ALSO GOOD
Capable supporting performances
were given by Newton Arnold as
the cynical doctor and Joseph Dye
as Father MeKee, the dogmatic and
somewhat illiterate parish priest.
Allen Fletcher, as Joe the fore
man, seemed miscast to this review
er although he carried through his
part with precision. A more robust
Joe, with a larger touch of brutal
ity, seemed ordered in contrast to
Tony's big-heart edness.
CREDIT TO DIRECTOR
Credit should also go to Marjoric
Walsh, the director of "They Knew
What They Wanted," for tlie play
was, except for the usual first-night
slip-ups, a good solid performance.
