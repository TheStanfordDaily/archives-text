## Honor Code—A Sleeping Beauty 
### 
Now that the Honor Code Standing Com
n it ■ has finally been appointed by Excom,
we'd like to drag out of its obscure setting the
Code which should dominate the spirit and
actions of every person who calls himself a
member of the Stanford student body.
During the war years, the Code was intro
duced in a cut-arid dried fashion to the new
.'students as they arrived on campus, and chalk
ed up as an accepted method of procedure for
the ii-«-t of students and the faculty without
actio., : j insure its enforcement or recognition
of it a . u working power.
The result has been that students return
ing guestiori what has become of the Code
which they once fought for, lived by, and
looked to as their greatest source of student
self government.
This matter was brought to the attention
of summer Excom by the Daily, with the rec
ojnrn ndation that a strong student-faculty
publicity committee be appointed to orient
2,000 new students to the wherefores of the
Code.
Nothing was done, and the Code now op
erate.-;, or barely operates, on a basis unsup
ported by the knowledge or conviction of the
majority. Currently, the Honor Code doesn't

get any guestioning from students, simply
because it's "always been around."
We suggest that the tardily-appointed
standing committee examine past procedures
and set up machinery which will make it not
a passive standing committee, but one which
carries out a ceaseless campaign to inform
faculty members and every student on the
vast freedom and concurrent responsibilities
of the Honor Code. One introductory letter to
each faculty member is not enough; one lec
ture to an incoming student or a pamphlet of
limited circulation is likewise not enough.
The Men's and Women's Councils should
re-examine and probably increase the scale
of penalties for violations of the Code, and
give adeguate publicity to any clear-cut poli
cies of enforcement established through their
trials.
If the Honor Code resumes its rightful place
in the minds of an uncertain student body, the
arguments concerning freedom of student or
ganizations will fall into a logical and ungues
tionable framework. We petition the Honor
Code Standing Committee to make ready now
a program for Excom approval which will do
a job we consider to be basic in the successful
operation of student government.

a job we consider to be basic in the successful
operation of student government.
Now that the Honor Code Standing Com
n it ■ has finally been appointed by Excom,
we'd like to drag out of its obscure setting the
Code which should dominate the spirit and
actions of every person who calls himself a
member of the Stanford student body.
During the war years, the Code was intro
duced in a cut-arid dried fashion to the new
.'students as they arrived on campus, and chalk
ed up as an accepted method of procedure for
the ii-«-t of students and the faculty without
actio., : j insure its enforcement or recognition
of it a . u working power.
The result has been that students return
ing guestiori what has become of the Code
which they once fought for, lived by, and
looked to as their greatest source of student
self government.
This matter was brought to the attention
of summer Excom by the Daily, with the rec
ojnrn ndation that a strong student-faculty
publicity committee be appointed to orient
2,000 new students to the wherefores of the
Code.
Nothing was done, and the Code now op
erate.-;, or barely operates, on a basis unsup
ported by the knowledge or conviction of the
majority. Currently, the Honor Code doesn't

get any guestioning from students, simply
because it's "always been around."
We suggest that the tardily-appointed
standing committee examine past procedures
and set up machinery which will make it not
a passive standing committee, but one which
carries out a ceaseless campaign to inform
faculty members and every student on the
vast freedom and concurrent responsibilities
of the Honor Code. One introductory letter to
each faculty member is not enough; one lec
ture to an incoming student or a pamphlet of
limited circulation is likewise not enough.
The Men's and Women's Councils should
re-examine and probably increase the scale
of penalties for violations of the Code, and
give adeguate publicity to any clear-cut poli
cies of enforcement established through their
trials.
If the Honor Code resumes its rightful place
in the minds of an uncertain student body, the
arguments concerning freedom of student or
ganizations will fall into a logical and ungues
tionable framework. We petition the Honor
Code Standing Committee to make ready now
a program for Excom approval which will do
a job we consider to be basic in the successful
operation of student government.
