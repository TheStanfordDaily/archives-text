## BULL SESSION

'ii i!ii: has been moving pretty smoothly around
camp.is considering the tremendous number of cars
that, are operated hereabouts. About the only tie-up
.1 have seen is the one at the P.O. every noon.
The idea of th" one-way street running behind
the Row from the P.O. to the Deke house was fine.
There's only one trouble. It's one-way in the wrong
direction; the signs ought to be the other way.
One of th" Row men was booming down it the
othei morning in the direction that the signs point
(Deke hous I .' to P. 0.) when a member of our local
police i.tall stopped.
"Whatsha name?" asked the gendarme.
"Whatuv 1 done?" asked our lad.
"NeV' r mind the act, just give me your name,"
said the cop.
"But first tell me, what have 1 done?" insisted the
victim.
' You see that sign over there, don'tcha?" asked
the officer.
"Y OS."
' Well, then, give me your name."
"But," said our boy, "that sign says it's one-way
in the way I'm headed."
"No," said the cop, "it can't." He took a look.
U did.
Mo the gendarme apologized profusely and went,
av.s y muttering to himself while the How man drove
happily <Â»fV with the smile of the just.

lint if that street were one-way in the other di
rection, it would certainly relieve a lot of the con
gestion around the P.O. If that doesn't clear it up,
i( mij'ht also be a good idea to restrict parking on

the Row side of the P.O. As it is now, there are
cars turning right from the left-hand side of the
street and left from the right-hand curb. Confusing,
to say the least.
And if some of those stupid Roble and Lagunita
girls who insist on riding their bicycles the wrong
way in the one-way street on the Union side of the
P.O. don't keep out of the way, I'm going to run 'em
down and sue 'em for getting blood on my fenders.

Some of the boys had quite a party the other
night. It was a hayride and things were going hi
lariously well until a wheel came off the wagon in
downtown Paly.
The majority of the couples started walking and
hitching back to campus but a few of the more in
genious lads unhooked the horses, piled their dates
on them, and headed homeward.
After tying up traffic several times and causing
a few near-collisions, they reached their destination,
one of the girls' hall on the Row. They rode the nags
up on the front porch, dismounted the girls, and told
them good-night.
But then the horses, apparently knowing a good
thing when they saw it, refused to budge from the
porch.
After attempting much persuasion, the boys got
disgusted and left their four-legged friends there.
Several of the girls reportedly swore never to touch
another brew after arriving home to find two horses
chatting on their front porch.
Eventually the police arrived, the animals were
persuaded to leave (they probably had 1:30's), and
the incident was closed, except for a little sweeping
up that was necessary the next morn.
