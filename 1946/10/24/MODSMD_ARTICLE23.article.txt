Our recently announced policy of refusing loans
1.0 unfriendly nations seems vefy reasonable at first
:;ight. After all, the argument runs, you wouldn't
lend money to someone who calls you names behind
your back. Similarly, what could be. more stupid
than helping nations who make nasty cracks about
your politics?
The difficulty with this apparently common sense
id< i is that it reasons from the particular to the
general. This is not only poor logic, but in the past
has meant nothing but trouble despite its popular
appeal.
We held, for example, that it is in accord with
the democratic tradition of free enterprise for a busi
ness man to sell to all comers. Therefore, we said, it ■
is: necessary that the government does not inter
foe with this activity. As a result your dollars
helped build Hitler's and Hirohito's war machine.
Or, for example, in the 18th century it was ar
gued that since persons get rich by accumulating a
lot of money it would be sound for nations to do
the same thing. The fallacy of this soon became
clear.
This attitude on loans, so proudly announced by
1 he State Department and proudly supported by the
press, means thai we have decided on two worlds,
not one. There will be nations iri our orbit, such as
Austria (rul°d by the church). Greece (ruled by

British guns), and China (ruled by a feudal clique).
These countries we will aid.
There are other states whose politics we don't like
because look too much toward Moscow. They
will not be aided. That is "realpolitik."
We have made the dividing line clear. There will
be two sharply defined worlds and mounting an
tagonism between them.
While the people of the United States have re
peatedly expressed their desire for an effective world
government, the State Department, led by that super
realistic South Carolinian Jimmy Byrnes, is taking
steps to prevent it. ft not merely refuses to discuss
the question, but is now making sure that all dis
cussion remains futile.
What do "two worlds" mean? It means that
United Nations can go home and save itself a lot of
work. It means two armed camps. It means war.
Not by 1950, but sooner or later. For if history shows
anything it shows that groups of equal sovereignty
with no common sovereignty above them cannot live
in peace.
The Slat'.- Department and the press aren't inter
ested in history. They are interested in being "prac
tical."
I am not recommending assorted dreams, plain
and fancy. I am recommending that we learn the
facts of life, that we begin to realize that certain con
ditions make for peace, and others for war, and that
we stop the traditional nauseating hypocrisy of pray
ing for the one and working for the other.

Our recently announced policy of refusing loans
1.0 unfriendly nations seems vefy reasonable at first
:;ight. After all, the argument runs, you wouldn't
lend money to someone who calls you names behind
your back. Similarly, what could be. more stupid
than helping nations who make nasty cracks about
your politics?
The difficulty with this apparently common sense
id< i is that it reasons from the particular to the
general. This is not only poor logic, but in the past
has meant nothing but trouble despite its popular
appeal.
We held, for example, that it is in accord with
the democratic tradition of free enterprise for a busi
ness man to sell to all comers. Therefore, we said, it ■
is: necessary that the government does not inter
foe with this activity. As a result your dollars
helped build Hitler's and Hirohito's war machine.
Or, for example, in the 18th century it was ar
gued that since persons get rich by accumulating a
lot of money it would be sound for nations to do
the same thing. The fallacy of this soon became
clear.
This attitude on loans, so proudly announced by
1 he State Department and proudly supported by the
press, means thai we have decided on two worlds,
not one. There will be nations iri our orbit, such as
Austria (rul°d by the church). Greece (ruled by

British guns), and China (ruled by a feudal clique).
These countries we will aid.
There are other states whose politics we don't like
because look too much toward Moscow. They
will not be aided. That is "realpolitik."
We have made the dividing line clear. There will
be two sharply defined worlds and mounting an
tagonism between them.
