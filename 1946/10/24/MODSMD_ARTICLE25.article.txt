# CAMPUS OPINION

To (he Editor:
It was my privilege to attend
the Conference on China and the i
Far Fast in San Francisco last
weekend. Since the facts pre
sented in this conference have for
the most part been withheld from
the public by the great free Amer- j
ican press, I would appreciate the
opportunity to present some of
them to Daily readers.
PHILIPPINES
1. In the Philippines the member
of the Japanese quisling govern
ment, Manuel Roxas, now Presi
dent, i.s engaged in hunting down
the guerilla fighters who so bravely
resisted the Japanese. Land has
been returned to the great land
holders, many of whom are the di
rect descendants of the original
Spanish conquerors, and the peas
ants are back in semi-slavery.
INDONESIA
2. Indonesia, with a population
over half that of the United States,
has formed a republic and declared
it will not return to the tyrannical
rule of the Dutch, whose exploita
tion and despotism almost exceeds
that of the Japanese. The United
States i.s arming Dutch troops to
regain this rich land.
KOREA
3. Korea, longest suffering of all j
countries dominated by the Japa- 1
i.s being run by an American
Military Government that allows
little more freedom than did the
Japanese. The Korean Independent,
organ of Koreans in America, has
this to say about it:
"The American military rulers
have brought to the Koreans
chains of enslavement instead of
civil liberties; starvation instead
of food, and danger of colonization
instead of freedom and independ
ence." '
CHINA
4. In China the United States gov- j
ernment i.s backing the almost un- |
believably corrupt totalitarian gov- !
ernment of Chiang Kai-shek in a I
civil war that threatens to engulf j
the whole world, by training,
equipping, and transporting his i
troops to the battle-front, and in |
some cases going so far as to guard |
his supply lines with American j

j troops. This policy resulted in the
failure of General Marshall in his
j attempt to bring the two warring
factors to form a democratic coali
! lion government, as Chiang was
made to feel he really had American
backing in the war and therefore
J he could wipe out his opposition and
1 maintain his dictatorship. That he
1 had good reason to think as he did
is shown partially by these figures:
Number of divisions trained for
Chiang by America before V-J Day,
20; since V-J Day, 40.
Lend-lease aid before V-J Day,
${>.'$1,000,000; since V-J Day,(! 02,-
000,000.
War surplus military supplies from
India-Burma since V-J Day, $500,-
000,000.
Cost of transporting Chinese ar
mies since V-J Day, $300,000,000.
The above figures are taken
from the Congressional Record of
July 2(>, 1046, and-may be regard
ed as conservative. The total value
of our aid to Chiang has been es
timated at over $4,000,000,000 since
the end of the war. The value of
the lives of 50 marines killed there
is more difficult to estimate, as is
the value of the lives of the thou
sands of Chinese in the war we
could stop.
General Carlson, Marine hero of
j Carlson's raiders, has proposed a
simple, workable suggestion for the
solution of China's problem revolv
ing briefly about (1) immediate
withdrawal of troops and withhold
ing of military aid by all foreign
powers to either side of the conflict
(Russia has withdrawn her troops
from all China except those in Port
Arthur and Yenan by agreement
with Chiang) and (2) joint U.S.-
Russian mediation of the dispute by
setting up a coalition government
I on democratic principles.
That our policies in the Far East
are imperialistic rather than demo
| cratic i.s evident. That they may in
j volve us in another war i.s at least a
possibility. If any group would like
to discuss further the implications
1 of our present policy and ways of
changing it I hope they will con
-1 tact me through the Daily.
