lective enrollment process, and
| they are eager to learn.
"So eager, in fact," Dr. Winbigler

! have told me that teaching the post

war Stanford student is an exhila-
I rating experience."
With regard to the Stanford Vil
lage, Dr. Winbigler said that the
installation is working out favorably
j from both the University's and the
! student's point of view.
