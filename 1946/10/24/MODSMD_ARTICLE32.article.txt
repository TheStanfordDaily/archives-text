Yesterday was a special .day in my life. I got a letter. Alright, so it was
a mimeographed throwaway; it came thru the mail didn't it? It wasn't
addressed tu me, but I got it. It was addressed to Mr. Donald B. Tresidder
and Mr. Tresidder passed it along to Mr. Masters oi S.A.C., who in turn
gave it to Mr. Liebendorfer. Mr. L. turned it over to Miss Mac Vicar of
the Daily. (Are you still with me?)
It lay on Miss MacV's desk until yesterday when I wandered into her
office looking for a match. That's when I got the letter, She didn't have
a match.
The "Downtown Athletic Club of New York City Incorporated" was
what the letterhead said. It also said "The Heisman Memorial Trophy
Award." One paragraph out of this letter, signed by William B. Alexander,
Director ol Athletics at Georgia Tech, who is also chairman of the Heis
man Award advisory committee, is worthwhile repeating:
"You may wish to have pointed out to your students that previous
winners of the Ileisman Trophy, Football's Greatest Award, have come
from many different colleges and that right on your own team there may
he a worthy contender."

You may not know
it, kid, but we do
have a "worthy
contender"for foot
ball's greatest a
ward. Who do I
mean? I'll tell ya
later, kid.
First, I wanna tell
you about the Heis
man Trophy. It was
named after John
W. Heisman, who
would rate a niche
in the Hall of Fame
for one thing a team
of his did if he had
never done any
thing else.
Back in 191G, when
he was coaching
Georgia Tech, the
Wrecks had sched
uled a little Ten
nessee school nam
ed Cumberland. I
won't say Tech was
pointing for a win
over the Tennessee
ans, but they cer
tainly weren't scar
ed of the outfit. The
score was Georgia
Tech 222, Cumber
land 0.

Anyway, in 1935, the DAC of NYC, Inc., decided to award a trophy to
the outstanding college football player in the country. The Club is one
of (he largest in the world, occupying an entire 36-story building in Man
hattan, and the members thought it would be a fitting honor to give a boy
that would last long after the newspaper clippings had faded away.
Consequently, Frank Eliscu, a well-known New York sculptor was
commissioned to create a bronze figure of a football player which when
properly enscribed would become the permanent possession of the win
ner each year.
As all club members do, they argued about various methods of balloting
tf> elect the winner, but finally the committee agreed that the sportswriters
and broadcasters would be the only impartial and qualified electors. Take
a bow boys; that's enough. These men are in a position to see the players
in action and scan press reports. More than 750 equally chosen from all
sections of the United States, now act as electors. I said I'd tell ya later,
didn't I?
Eliscu's bronze gridder was cast and first won by Jay Berwanger of
(he University of Chicago, coached by one Clark D. Shaughnessy, in 1935.
In 193(5. fleisman. who was then Director of Athletics at the Down
town Athletic Club died and the trophy was renamed the Hcisman Me
morial Trophy. Heisman bad been a coach for 37 years, from 1892 to 1927
at eight different colleges, so the renaming of the award seemed par
ticularly fitting and met with instant approval.
Incidently, Heisman was the man who sounded the death knell to the
old "T" formation —which was the original backfield formation of football.
In those days (circa turn of the century) the quarterback handled the ball
on every play, with the exceptions of punts and kickofi's, just like our
boys do it.
Heisman didn't like it, so he invented the direct snap from center
which permitted any man in the backfield to receive the ball and opened
the way for the power boys. But Heisman wasn't content with just power.
So he invented the spinner play and, some sources claim, the forward
pass. (Knute Rockne popularized it in 1915, but didn't invent it.)
Incidentally, that same Georgia Tech team that convinced Cumberland
it should play in its own league hereafter, played both Furman and Wake
Forest in one day the next year, which is quite a trick.
Heisman was twice president of the American Football Coaches Asso
ciation, and the organized and first president of the Touchdown Club,
and is listed along with Rockne, Warner, Stagg. Yost and Jones as Grid
iron Masters.
After Berwanger won it in '35, a couple of Yale boys took it home the
next two years, one of them being the only lineman ever to receive it.
Larry Kelley, who probably changed the rule book more than any other
player, got it for his work at end for the Elis, and teammate Clint Frank
was honored with it in '37.
Little Davey O'Brien of Texas Christian won it in '38, and Nile Kin
nick of lowa took the award in '39. Since then it has been won by Mich
igan's Tom Harmon in '40, Minnesota's Bruce Smith in '41, Georgia's
Frankie Sinkwich in '42. Notre Dame's Angelo Bertelli in '43, Ohio State's
Les Horvath in '44, and Army's Felix Blanchard last season.
The man who wins football's greatest individual award goes to New
York early in December with his coach where before a galaxy of past and
present football stars he is fittingly honored and presented with an indi
vidual Heisman Memorial Trophy. Okeh, okeh, I'll tell you.
His name is Lloyd Mcrriman. If you see a tall good-looking kid with
a shy smile and rusty red hair and a set of shoulders about so-o-o-o-o-o

wide, that's Lloyd Merriman. lie's
Stanford's IVIr. Football.
And he's good too. In the whole
country, there's only eight buys who
have lugged the ball for more yards
from scrum than he, and the only
one of the eight you've heard about
is Glenn Davis of Army, who ranks
fourth in the rushing status. Merri
man's net total is 367 yards in 67
tries, or a little over five yards per
try. He'd have about a hundred
yards more if the distance he car
ried passes against Santa Clara
counted, but it don't. His passing
average isn't bad either, he's thrown
three, completed two —both for 28
yards.
Only his kicking has been off.
Both times he tried to punt last
week, the Brone line seeped thru
and partially blocked both boots.
Of course, nobody's hailed him
as the greatest hark they ever saw.
except me—and the men on the
green sheet commend me for
showing the true spirit of a sopho
more. I even said he's as good in
his first year of collegiate football
as was Doc Blanchard in his at
Army, hut all that got was some
sagely nodding heads.
However, there's nobody on the
Coast who plays a better game at
fullback, and not even Blanchard
made the Heisman Trophy his first
year.

of (he largest in the world, occupying an entire 36-story building in Man
hattan, and the members thought it would be a fitting honor to give a boy
that would last long after the newspaper clippings had faded away.
Consequently, Frank Eliscu, a well-known New York sculptor was
commissioned to create a bronze figure of a football player which when
properly enscribed would become the permanent possession of the win
ner each year.
As all club members do, they argued about various methods of balloting
tf> elect the winner, but finally the committee agreed that the sportswriters
and broadcasters would be the only impartial and qualified electors. Take
a bow boys; that's enough. These men are in a position to see the players
in action and scan press reports. More than 750 equally chosen from all
sections of the United States, now act as electors. I said I'd tell ya later,
didn't I?
Eliscu's bronze gridder was cast and first won by Jay Berwanger of
(he University of Chicago, coached by one Clark D. Shaughnessy, in 1935.
In 193(5. fleisman. who was then Director of Athletics at the Down
town Athletic Club died and the trophy was renamed the Hcisman Me
morial Trophy. Heisman bad been a coach for 37 years, from 1892 to 1927
at eight different colleges, so the renaming of the award seemed par
ticularly fitting and met with instant approval.
Incidently, Heisman was the man who sounded the death knell to the
old "T" formation —which was the original backfield formation of football.
In those days (circa turn of the century) the quarterback handled the ball
on every play, with the exceptions of punts and kickofi's, just like our
boys do it.
Heisman didn't like it, so he invented the direct snap from center
which permitted any man in the backfield to receive the ball and opened
the way for the power boys. But Heisman wasn't content with just power.
So he invented the spinner play and, some sources claim, the forward
pass. (Knute Rockne popularized it in 1915, but didn't invent it.)
Incidentally, that same Georgia Tech team that convinced Cumberland
it should play in its own league hereafter, played both Furman and Wake
Forest in one day the next year, which is quite a trick.
Heisman was twice president of the American Football Coaches Asso
ciation, and the organized and first president of the Touchdown Club,
and is listed along with Rockne, Warner, Stagg. Yost and Jones as Grid
iron Masters.
After Berwanger won it in '35, a couple of Yale boys took it home the
next two years, one of them being the only lineman ever to receive it.
Larry Kelley, who probably changed the rule book more than any other
player, got it for his work at end for the Elis, and teammate Clint Frank
was honored with it in '37.
Little Davey O'Brien of Texas Christian won it in '38, and Nile Kin
nick of lowa took the award in '39. Since then it has been won by Mich
igan's Tom Harmon in '40, Minnesota's Bruce Smith in '41, Georgia's
Frankie Sinkwich in '42. Notre Dame's Angelo Bertelli in '43, Ohio State's
Les Horvath in '44, and Army's Felix Blanchard last season.
The man who wins football's greatest individual award goes to New
York early in December with his coach where before a galaxy of past and
present football stars he is fittingly honored and presented with an indi
vidual Heisman Memorial Trophy. Okeh, okeh, I'll tell you.
His name is Lloyd Mcrriman. If you see a tall good-looking kid with
a shy smile and rusty red hair and a set of shoulders about so-o-o-o-o-o

wide, that's Lloyd Merriman. lie's
Stanford's IVIr. Football.
And he's good too. In the whole
country, there's only eight buys who
have lugged the ball for more yards
from scrum than he, and the only
one of the eight you've heard about
is Glenn Davis of Army, who ranks
fourth in the rushing status. Merri
man's net total is 367 yards in 67
tries, or a little over five yards per
try. He'd have about a hundred
yards more if the distance he car
ried passes against Santa Clara
counted, but it don't. His passing
average isn't bad either, he's thrown
three, completed two —both for 28
yards.
Only his kicking has been off.
Both times he tried to punt last
week, the Brone line seeped thru
and partially blocked both boots.
Of course, nobody's hailed him
as the greatest hark they ever saw.
except me—and the men on the
green sheet commend me for
showing the true spirit of a sopho
more. I even said he's as good in
his first year of collegiate football
as was Doc Blanchard in his at
Army, hut all that got was some
sagely nodding heads.
However, there's nobody on the
Coast who plays a better game at
fullback, and not even Blanchard
made the Heisman Trophy his first
year.


HEISMAN MEMORIAL TROPHY
Yesterday was a special .day in my life. I got a letter. Alright, so it was
a mimeographed throwaway; it came thru the mail didn't it? It wasn't
addressed tu me, but I got it. It was addressed to Mr. Donald B. Tresidder
and Mr. Tresidder passed it along to Mr. Masters oi S.A.C., who in turn
gave it to Mr. Liebendorfer. Mr. L. turned it over to Miss Mac Vicar of
the Daily. (Are you still with me?)
It lay on Miss MacV's desk until yesterday when I wandered into her
office looking for a match. That's when I got the letter, She didn't have
a match.
The "Downtown Athletic Club of New York City Incorporated" was
what the letterhead said. It also said "The Heisman Memorial Trophy
Award." One paragraph out of this letter, signed by William B. Alexander,
Director ol Athletics at Georgia Tech, who is also chairman of the Heis
man Award advisory committee, is worthwhile repeating:
"You may wish to have pointed out to your students that previous
winners of the Ileisman Trophy, Football's Greatest Award, have come
from many different colleges and that right on your own team there may
he a worthy contender."

You may not know
it, kid, but we do
have a "worthy
contender"for foot
ball's greatest a

mean? I'll tell ya

First, I wanna tell
you about the Heis

named after John

would rate a niche
in the Hall of Fame
for one thing a team
of his did if he had
never done any
thing else.
Back in 191G, when
he was coaching
Georgia Tech, the
Wrecks had sched
uled a little Ten
nessee school nam
ed Cumberland. I
won't say Tech was
pointing for a win
over the Tennessee
ans, but they cer
tainly weren't scar

score was Georgia
Tech 222, Cumber

it should play in its own league hereafter, played both Furman and Wake
Forest in one day the next year, which is quite a trick.
Heisman was twice president of the American Football Coaches Asso
ciation, and the organized and first president of the Touchdown Club,
and is listed along with Rockne, Warner, Stagg. Yost and Jones as Grid
iron Masters.
After Berwanger won it in '35, a couple of Yale boys took it home the
next two years, one of them being the only lineman ever to receive it.
Larry Kelley, who probably changed the rule book more than any other
player, got it for his work at end for the Elis, and teammate Clint Frank
was honored with it in '37.
Little Davey O'Brien of Texas Christian won it in '38, and Nile Kin

Frankie Sinkwich in '42. Notre Dame's Angelo Bertelli in '43, Ohio State's
Les Horvath in '44, and Army's Felix Blanchard last season.
The man who wins football's greatest individual award goes to New
York early in December with his coach where before a galaxy of past and
present football stars he is fittingly honored and presented with an indi
vidual Heisman Memorial Trophy. Okeh, okeh, I'll tell you.
His name is Lloyd Mcrriman. If you see a tall good-looking kid with
a shy smile and rusty red hair and a set of shoulders about so-o-o-o-o-o

wide, that's Lloyd Merriman. lie's
Stanford's IVIr. Football.
And he's good too. In the whole
country, there's only eight buys who
have lugged the ball for more yards
from scrum than he, and the only
one of the eight you've heard about
is Glenn Davis of Army, who ranks
fourth in the rushing status. Merri
man's net total is 367 yards in 67
tries, or a little over five yards per
try. He'd have about a hundred
yards more if the distance he car
ried passes against Santa Clara
counted, but it don't. His passing
average isn't bad either, he's thrown
three, completed two —both for 28
yards.
Only his kicking has been off.
Both times he tried to punt last
week, the Brone line seeped thru
and partially blocked both boots.
Of course, nobody's hailed him
as the greatest hark they ever saw.
except me—and the men on the
green sheet commend me for
showing the true spirit of a sopho
more. I even said he's as good in
his first year of collegiate football
as was Doc Blanchard in his at
Army, hut all that got was some
sagely nodding heads.
However, there's nobody on the
Coast who plays a better game at
fullback, and not even Blanchard
made the Heisman Trophy his first
year.


HEISMAN MEMORIAL TROPHY
Yesterday was a special .day in my life. I got a letter. Alright, so it was
a mimeographed throwaway; it came thru the mail didn't it? It wasn't
addressed tu me, but I got it. It was addressed to Mr. Donald B. Tresidder
and Mr. Tresidder passed it along to Mr. Masters oi S.A.C., who in turn
gave it to Mr. Liebendorfer. Mr. L. turned it over to Miss Mac Vicar of
the Daily. (Are you still with me?)
It lay on Miss MacV's desk until yesterday when I wandered into her
office looking for a match. That's when I got the letter, She didn't have
a match.
The "Downtown Athletic Club of New York City Incorporated" was
what the letterhead said. It also said "The Heisman Memorial Trophy
Award." One paragraph out of this letter, signed by William B. Alexander,
Director ol Athletics at Georgia Tech, who is also chairman of the Heis
man Award advisory committee, is worthwhile repeating:
"You may wish to have pointed out to your students that previous
winners of the Ileisman Trophy, Football's Greatest Award, have come
from many different colleges and that right on your own team there may
he a worthy contender."

You may not know
it, kid, but we do
have a "worthy
contender"for foot
ball's greatest a
ward. Who do I
mean? I'll tell ya
later, kid.
First, I wanna tell
you about the Heis
man Trophy. It was
named after John
W. Heisman, who
would rate a niche
in the Hall of Fame
for one thing a team
of his did if he had
never done any
thing else.
Back in 191G, when
he was coaching
Georgia Tech, the
Wrecks had sched
uled a little Ten
nessee school nam
ed Cumberland. I
won't say Tech was
pointing for a win
over the Tennessee
ans, but they cer
tainly weren't scar
ed of the outfit. The
score was Georgia
Tech 222, Cumber
land 0.

Anyway, in 1935, the DAC of NYC, Inc., decided to award a trophy to
the outstanding college football player in the country. The Club is one
of (he largest in the world, occupying an entire 36-story building in Man
hattan, and the members thought it would be a fitting honor to give a boy
that would last long after the newspaper clippings had faded away.
Consequently, Frank Eliscu, a well-known New York sculptor was
commissioned to create a bronze figure of a football player which when
properly enscribed would become the permanent possession of the win
ner each year.
As all club members do, they argued about various methods of balloting
tf> elect the winner, but finally the committee agreed that the sportswriters
and broadcasters would be the only impartial and qualified electors. Take
a bow boys; that's enough. These men are in a position to see the players
in action and scan press reports. More than 750 equally chosen from all
sections of the United States, now act as electors. I said I'd tell ya later,
didn't I?
Eliscu's bronze gridder was cast and first won by Jay Berwanger of
(he University of Chicago, coached by one Clark D. Shaughnessy, in 1935.
In 193(5. fleisman. who was then Director of Athletics at the Down
town Athletic Club died and the trophy was renamed the Hcisman Me
morial Trophy. Heisman bad been a coach for 37 years, from 1892 to 1927
at eight different colleges, so the renaming of the award seemed par
ticularly fitting and met with instant approval.
Incidently, Heisman was the man who sounded the death knell to the
old "T" formation —which was the original backfield formation of football.
In those days (circa turn of the century) the quarterback handled the ball
on every play, with the exceptions of punts and kickofi's, just like our
boys do it.
Heisman didn't like it, so he invented the direct snap from center
which permitted any man in the backfield to receive the ball and opened
the way for the power boys. But Heisman wasn't content with just power.
So he invented the spinner play and, some sources claim, the forward
pass. (Knute Rockne popularized it in 1915, but didn't invent it.)
Incidentally, that same Georgia Tech team that convinced Cumberland
it should play in its own league hereafter, played both Furman and Wake
Forest in one day the next year, which is quite a trick.

HEISMAN MEMORIAL TROPHY
Yesterday was a special .day in my life. I got a letter. Alright, so it was
a mimeographed throwaway; it came thru the mail didn't it? It wasn't
addressed tu me, but I got it. It was addressed to Mr. Donald B. Tresidder
and Mr. Tresidder passed it along to Mr. Masters oi S.A.C., who in turn
gave it to Mr. Liebendorfer. Mr. L. turned it over to Miss Mac Vicar of
the Daily. (Are you still with me?)
It lay on Miss MacV's desk until yesterday when I wandered into her
office looking for a match. That's when I got the letter, She didn't have
a match.
The "Downtown Athletic Club of New York City Incorporated" was
what the letterhead said. It also said "The Heisman Memorial Trophy
Award." One paragraph out of this letter, signed by William B. Alexander,
Director ol Athletics at Georgia Tech, who is also chairman of the Heis
man Award advisory committee, is worthwhile repeating:
"You may wish to have pointed out to your students that previous
winners of the Ileisman Trophy, Football's Greatest Award, have come
from many different colleges and that right on your own team there may
he a worthy contender."

You may not know
it, kid, but we do
have a "worthy
contender"for foot
ball's greatest a
ward. Who do I
mean? I'll tell ya
later, kid.
First, I wanna tell
you about the Heis
man Trophy. It was
named after John
W. Heisman, who
would rate a niche
in the Hall of Fame
for one thing a team
of his did if he had
never done any
thing else.
Back in 191G, when
he was coaching
Georgia Tech, the
Wrecks had sched
uled a little Ten
nessee school nam
ed Cumberland. I
won't say Tech was
pointing for a win
over the Tennessee
ans, but they cer
tainly weren't scar
ed of the outfit. The
score was Georgia
Tech 222, Cumber
land 0.

Anyway, in 1935, the DAC of NYC, Inc., decided to award a trophy to
the outstanding college football player in the country. The Club is one
of (he largest in the world, occupying an entire 36-story building in Man
hattan, and the members thought it would be a fitting honor to give a boy
that would last long after the newspaper clippings had faded away.
Consequently, Frank Eliscu, a well-known New York sculptor was
commissioned to create a bronze figure of a football player which when
properly enscribed would become the permanent possession of the win
ner each year.
As all club members do, they argued about various methods of balloting
tf> elect the winner, but finally the committee agreed that the sportswriters
and broadcasters would be the only impartial and qualified electors. Take
a bow boys; that's enough. These men are in a position to see the players
in action and scan press reports. More than 750 equally chosen from all
sections of the United States, now act as electors. I said I'd tell ya later,
didn't I?
Eliscu's bronze gridder was cast and first won by Jay Berwanger of
(he University of Chicago, coached by one Clark D. Shaughnessy, in 1935.
In 193(5. fleisman. who was then Director of Athletics at the Down
town Athletic Club died and the trophy was renamed the Hcisman Me
morial Trophy. Heisman bad been a coach for 37 years, from 1892 to 1927
at eight different colleges, so the renaming of the award seemed par
ticularly fitting and met with instant approval.
Incidently, Heisman was the man who sounded the death knell to the
old "T" formation —which was the original backfield formation of football.
In those days (circa turn of the century) the quarterback handled the ball
on every play, with the exceptions of punts and kickofi's, just like our
boys do it.
Heisman didn't like it, so he invented the direct snap from center
which permitted any man in the backfield to receive the ball and opened
the way for the power boys. But Heisman wasn't content with just power.
So he invented the spinner play and, some sources claim, the forward
pass. (Knute Rockne popularized it in 1915, but didn't invent it.)
Incidentally, that same Georgia Tech team that convinced Cumberland
it should play in its own league hereafter, played both Furman and Wake
Forest in one day the next year, which is quite a trick.
Heisman was twice president of the American Football Coaches Asso
ciation, and the organized and first president of the Touchdown Club,
and is listed along with Rockne, Warner, Stagg. Yost and Jones as Grid
iron Masters.
After Berwanger won it in '35, a couple of Yale boys took it home the
next two years, one of them being the only lineman ever to receive it.
Larry Kelley, who probably changed the rule book more than any other
player, got it for his work at end for the Elis, and teammate Clint Frank
was honored with it in '37.
Little Davey O'Brien of Texas Christian won it in '38, and Nile Kin
nick of lowa took the award in '39. Since then it has been won by Mich
igan's Tom Harmon in '40, Minnesota's Bruce Smith in '41, Georgia's
Frankie Sinkwich in '42. Notre Dame's Angelo Bertelli in '43, Ohio State's
Les Horvath in '44, and Army's Felix Blanchard last season.
The man who wins football's greatest individual award goes to New
York early in December with his coach where before a galaxy of past and
present football stars he is fittingly honored and presented with an indi
vidual Heisman Memorial Trophy. Okeh, okeh, I'll tell you.
His name is Lloyd Mcrriman. If you see a tall good-looking kid with
a shy smile and rusty red hair and a set of shoulders about so-o-o-o-o-o

wide, that's Lloyd Merriman. lie's
Stanford's IVIr. Football.
And he's good too. In the whole
country, there's only eight buys who
have lugged the ball for more yards
from scrum than he, and the only
one of the eight you've heard about
is Glenn Davis of Army, who ranks
fourth in the rushing status. Merri
man's net total is 367 yards in 67
tries, or a little over five yards per
try. He'd have about a hundred
yards more if the distance he car
ried passes against Santa Clara
counted, but it don't. His passing
average isn't bad either, he's thrown
three, completed two —both for 28
yards.
Only his kicking has been off.

and partially blocked both boots.
