# Water Men Await U.S.C
## 
### 
Just how powerful the vaunted
! Stanford water polo team is will be
tested Saturday morning as the
U.S.C. swimmers descend upon the
! local pool. The cold-blooded may
hem is ticketed for a 10 o'clock get
away.
Down south the hulking Trojans
| looked disorganized as the Indians
[plastered them with an 11-5 de
feat. Which fact precipitated a wild
rush to the exits by the U.S.C fans,
j inquiring "What goes?" Such a lop
! sided defeat was not in keeping with
the accentuated sports program on
the Trojan campus. So a mammoth
reorganization campaign has been
: going on in preparation for Satur
| day's return match. The Trojans
are after revenge.
But swim experts look for very
little improvement in the Trojan
team; U.S.C. needs a lot more
than enthusiasm, of which they
have an abundance. On the other
hand, Stanford has not been
forced to any great lengths in its
| two opening Conference victories.
With their terrific speed poten
tial. the Indians have not yet had
cause to show their wealth of tal
ent. And after comparing Stanford
with other conference teams, one
wonders who will be able to ar
gue on equal terms with the
"loaded"' Indians.
Stanford's starting lineup looks
like a page out of the Pacific Coast
| Conference swimming record book,
i Using last spring's championship
! swimming squad as a nucleus,
J Coaches Tom Haynie and Ernie
Brandsten have organized a dream
team which has been tabbed to win
the water polo title. Competition on
i the squad is such that a number of
I swimming record holders must be
! content with substitute status.
