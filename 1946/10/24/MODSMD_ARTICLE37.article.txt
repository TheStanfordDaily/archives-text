# Troy Favored Over Farm 2-1-- "So We'll All Fight Harder"
## 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
There was lots of pepper out on the varsity practice field last night, in spite of the 2 to 1 odds
being quoted against them; more spirit and effervescence than at any time since the U.S.F. game.
That is the Schwartzmen's answer to the host of injuries that have dogged their footsteps. As one
player put it—after learning the latest quotations from the betting marts—"Okay, so we've had
some men hurt; so the rest of us will all fight a bit harder."

Coach Marchie Schwartz ran his
lads through another rugged drill
last nig Tit, but he didn't call for
much in the way of contact work.
Plenty of time was put on the of
fense, but he didn't neglect defense
against U.S.C. plays either. And af
ter it was all over, although they
{ must have been dog-tired, they ran
j all the way to the gym —yelling like
1 a real bunch of Indians all the way.
Captain for Saturday afternoon's
grid titanic will be Larrupin'
Lloyd Merriinan—he of the swivel
hips and twinkling toes. Inciden
tally, it is also the first time Mar
chie has trusted a backfield man
with the job. So sophomore Lloyd
will have even more responsibility
on his big shoulders.
FELDMAN OUT THREE WEEKS
Contrary to several rumors mak
ing the rounds on campus and in
San Francisco, none of the cripples
; are expected to play. Marly Fcld
man, who pulled a thigh muscle
Tuesday night, will probably be lost
to the team for three weeks. George
Quist and Harvey Bernhard have
I discarded their crutches, but are
: still far from able-bodied.
That's all on the debit side of
the ledger; on the credit side is
left guard Johnny Clark, who has
been on (he shelf since the Don
game three weeks ago. lie was
working out at his old spot last
night, and seemed as good as ever.
Of course there are other injuries
that might seem of great import un
der other circumstances, but in the
I face of REAL trouble they've hardly
i been mentioned. All will play their
usual game. Buck Brownson is hav
ing trouble with his foot, Dick Flat
land hurt his leg against the Broncs,
Bob Hall—well, there's no use going
on with this. Each has the same
personal therapy—ignore the aches
and pains and concentrate on l'oot
j ball.
TROY WORKING HARD
The Bovard Bombardiers — Tro-
I jans to you—are working just as
! hard for the game as the Indians.
| They, also, are staying' out on the
j practice field until long after the
| lights have been turned on. And

! they've been scrimmaging every
j night; first they run (he jayvees in
to the ground, then take on the
1 frosh.
With the exception of All-Coast
Ted Tannchill, who is out with a
broken collarbone, Troy should be
close (<» full strength. Mickey Mc-
Cardle and (Gordon Gray are re
ally convalescents, but word has
it that they're ready for some
football again.
Aubrey Devine, the little south
paw qb, sparkled for the Indians
j last night, both in the passing and
ball-handling departments. He con
nected with several long heaves un
der the lights—which, incidentally,
i were functioning at full strength for
j the first time this year.
