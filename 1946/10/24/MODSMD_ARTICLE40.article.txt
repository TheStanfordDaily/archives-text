# Javees Rarin' for Trojan Tilt
## 
### 
When the S.C. junior varsity rolls
into Stanford Stadium Saturday
morning, they will be greeted by a
spirited Stanford jayvee outfit that
is determined to pull an upset, that
could send the Trojan juniors back
to Figueroa Street with unfond
memories of their trip to the Farm.
Coach Ed Stamm sent his squad
j through a heavy scrum yesterday,
and will taper off today and tomor
row with passing defense and of
| tensive drills. Assistant Coaches Bob
; Crane and Lin Wolfe will work
with the backs in polishing up some
old T-tricks.
End Jim Dooley, who has been
j out since the Santa Rosa game, will
Ibe back in the lineup. However,
halfbacks Norm Lattin and Paul
Kent and end Paul Ghilotti are still
| on the injury list.
The Trojan junior varsity team,
I coached by Jerry Bowman, is load
! Ed with material, including several
| wartime S.C. varsity lettermen. The
j Trojan squad will also be bolstered
j by some big guns from the power
| ful, undefeated S.C. freshman team.
