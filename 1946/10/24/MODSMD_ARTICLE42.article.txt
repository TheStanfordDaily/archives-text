# Early Prints Shown At Farm Art Gallery
## 
### SUE ENGELHARD 
Prints by German, Dutch, Italian,
French, and Japanese artists are
being shown in the new exhibit at
the Stanford Art Gallery. The dis
play represents a story in the his
tory of printing that is older than
the Gutenberg Bible—one that has
survived to this day as a great art.
GERMAN INFLUENCE
The prints in the exhibit date 1
back to fifteenth-century Germany ■
and to the oldest technique of j
printing, wood engraving. Albrecht
Durer, four of whose prints are ex
hibited in the gallery, was the mas- i
ter engraver of this period and has
held the title to the present. He has i
been copied and recopied by many i
ispiring artists since, and has in
fluenced all schools of printed art. j
Two of his prints in the display are !
portraits. They show with stern i
detail the strong character of the ;
German subject.
REMBRANDT
The spirit of the Reformation was j
shown in the work of Lucas Cora- ■
nach, a friend of Martin Luther, J
who placed in his art his deep feel- j
ing for the new Protestant faith.
Only one of his engravings, a Cruci- |
fixion, is shown in the exhibit.
Dutch artists of the sixteenth cen- j
tury were led by the great painter ;
and etcher Rembrandt van Rijn, I
whose skill in the art of printing is I
second only to Durer. Rembrandt I
did most of his work in etching. ]
In fact, he revolutionized etching by !
occasionally using three methods at I
once in order to obtain different de- ]
grees of depth.
Two etchings by Rembrandt are j
shown in the exhibit, illustrating i
the different stages in his artistic j
career. The earliest is done in
heavy lines and the second is care- ;
lully etched with the utmost detail
and minute differences in depth.
ENGRAVING
Lucas van Leyden, a Dutch en
graver of this period, is to be noted
for his study of humanity in his
country's common and familiar set
lings. The two prints which are .
shown in the exhibit portray street I
scenes and the people of his time.
Italy's leader in the art of print
inn was Marcantonio, and though

he was not up to Durer or Rem
brandt in skill he is ranked with ,
them as being one of the three great
masters. His work is softer than .
that of Durer and the figures them
selves have the grace expressed in
the Italian paintings of the Renais
sance.
WOOD BLOCKS
Lithographs by Matisse, the great I
French artist of the twentieth cen
tury, give a modern tone to the ex- j
hibit. Lithography is one of the old
est techniques of printing, but has
been used by Matisse to great ad
vantage. Some of his lithographs in i
the exhibit are not valuable along, j
but they show the development of
his work and arc valuable in the
sequence. Mrs. Michael Stein pre
sented this collection of Matisse
lithographs to Stanford.
In addition to the European prints, j
the exhibit is displaying 11 Japanese !
woodblock prints made in the 18th
and 19th centuries. The prints, done
in color, are of typical Japanese fig- i
ures accompanied by lyrics written j
in characters in the background.
The prints in this exhibit were
donated to Stanford from the Jor
dan. Miller, Loeser, and Stein col- j
lections.
