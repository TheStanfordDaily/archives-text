## 
### 
Interclub Council voted yesterday
to temporarily dissolve Los Arcos
rating club because no active mem
bers are now on campus. Council
President Ray Smith added that the
club would be revived as soon as j
the situation warranted it.
Frank Creede, Toyon president,
reported to the council on the re
cent house meeting and discussion
fit "wing" control, telling the coun- i
cil members he was turning the re
sults of the club's voting over to
the Dean of Students.
Plans for membership drives and
social events, which might possibly ;
include a "Listening Party" before
the Oregon State game, were dis
cussed.
