U.N. ASSEMBLY lIALL, Flush
ing, N.Y., Oft. 2:i (UP). â€”The U.S.
Marines landed in Flushing Mead
ows today and shortly had the sit
uation so well in hand that their
"seeuri.lv precautions" delayed the
opening of the United Nations
General Assembly for 15 minutes.
The delay was caused by the in
ability nf a Secretariat messen
ger, a one-legged American war
veteran, to gain admission to the
Flushing Meadows hall.
The messenger was rushing
from the U.N.'s Lake Success
headquarters with mimeographed
copies of the opening address of
President Paul Henri Spaak. Sec
retary - (General Trygvc Lie or
dered the session delayed until
the copies arrived mi that an Eng
lish translation of the speech
could he dispensed with.
However, the messenger, unable
to persuade the Marines to let him
in, had to walk half a mile around
the periphery of the grounds be
fore he could g< t into the ball
where the impatient delegates
waited.
