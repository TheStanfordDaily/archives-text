# Union Question

### 
To the Editor of the Stanford Daily and the student body:
For the past several weeks everyone has heard quite a bit of
talk about building a new Student Union at Stanford. We, as a
committee, have been appointed by Excom to investigate the
feasibility of undertaking such a project. We realize that there
may be many divergent opinions concerning a new Student
Union, and in an effort to arouse these opinions we are writing
this letter.
There's been some talk, too, among students, alumni, and
faculty about a Stanford War Memorial. Quite naturally the
Union then becomes a candidate for the Memorial project, and
this idea is gaining considerable momentum.
When you read this, ask the person next to you if he favors
building a Student Union as a war memorial. The chances arc
he will say yes. And the chances are too that he's given the
question very* little consideration before he answers.
We on the committee feel that the Union is a logical candi
date for the War Memorial project. We believe that a War Me
morial should be a useful and living thing, and there certainly
can be little argument that a new Student Union would be the
most useful and living monument that could be built.
The Union we visualize might contain such sorely needed
facilities as a large ballroom for all-campus dances; a bigger and
better version of the Cellar; a large, well-equipped drug store
and magazine counter; facilities for minor sports activities such
as ping-pong, bowling, and billiards; adequate space for student
body offices and committee rooms; and accommodations for
visiting parents and guests of the University. Such a Union
might also include separate facilities for the faculty, such as a
lounge and private dining room.
Perhaps some of you have other ideas as to what should go
into the Union, or perhaps some of you feel that some of the
above-mentioned facilities are not present needs of the campus.
In any event, we would like to get your ideas on the subject.
Later on this quarter an all-campus survey will be made to deter
mine what the students think about the idea of a new Student
Union. Therefore, if you have any ideas that you think should
be put before the student body, or have any important opinions
concerning the proposed plan of a new Student Union, now is
the time to bring them forth. You may do this by writing a letter
to the Campus Opinion of the Daily, or by sending a letter to
the Union Planning Committee, Box 3013.

most useful and living monument that could be built.
The Union we visualize might contain such sorely needed
facilities as a large ballroom for all-campus dances; a bigger and
better version of the Cellar; a large, well-equipped drug store
and magazine counter; facilities for minor sports activities such
as ping-pong, bowling, and billiards; adequate space for student
body offices and committee rooms; and accommodations for
visiting parents and guests of the University. Such a Union
might also include separate facilities for the faculty, such as a
lounge and private dining room.
Perhaps some of you have other ideas as to what should go
into the Union, or perhaps some of you feel that some of the
above-mentioned facilities are not present needs of the campus.
In any event, we would like to get your ideas on the subject.
Later on this quarter an all-campus survey will be made to deter
mine what the students think about the idea of a new Student
Union. Therefore, if you have any ideas that you think should
be put before the student body, or have any important opinions
concerning the proposed plan of a new Student Union, now is
the time to bring them forth. You may do this by writing a letter
to the Campus Opinion of the Daily, or by sending a letter to
the Union Planning Committee, Box 3013.

To the Editor of the Stanford Daily and the student body:
For the past several weeks everyone has heard quite a bit of
talk about building a new Student Union at Stanford. We, as a
committee, have been appointed by Excom to investigate the
feasibility of undertaking such a project. We realize that there
may be many divergent opinions concerning a new Student
Union, and in an effort to arouse these opinions we are writing
this letter.
There's been some talk, too, among students, alumni, and
faculty about a Stanford War Memorial. Quite naturally the
Union then becomes a candidate for the Memorial project, and
this idea is gaining considerable momentum.
When you read this, ask the person next to you if he favors
building a Student Union as a war memorial. The chances arc
he will say yes. And the chances are too that he's given the
question very* little consideration before he answers.
We on the committee feel that the Union is a logical candi
date for the War Memorial project. We believe that a War Me
morial should be a useful and living thing, and there certainly
can be little argument that a new Student Union would be the
most useful and living monument that could be built.
