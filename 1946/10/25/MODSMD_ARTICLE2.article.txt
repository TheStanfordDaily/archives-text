# Meteor Detection By Radio Outlined
## 
### 
Larry Manning, research associ
ate in electrical engineering, dis
cussed the detection of meteors by
radio at the Stanford Radio Club
meeting Wednesday, according to
Stanley F. Kaisel, retiring presi
dent.
Mr. Manning said that even on
the clearest nights, many more me
teors can be "spotted" by radio
than by visual means. The job of
counting meteors will be made au
tomatic by using the radio method.
He also described the conditions
under which meteor signals can be
heard by anyone who owns a sen
sitive shortwave receiver.
New officers elected at the eve
ning session were Bertram Byland,
club president; Chester Carr, vice
president; Lester A. Roberts, secre
tary; and Edward M. Miller, treas
urer.
