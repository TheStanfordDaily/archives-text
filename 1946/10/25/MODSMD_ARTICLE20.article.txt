# 'GONNA BE TOUGH,'BUT...
## High Spirited Indians Ready 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
A spirited and determined Stanford football squad scam
pered through its last heavy workout yesterday afternoon, pre
paratory to meeting the big and muscular Trojans of U.S.C. on
the Stadium turf tomorrow. If anything, the* boys showed more
enthusiasm than the day before, which was the season's high
spot. They seemed unimpressed with the official odds, which
favor Troy by eight points, or 2 to 1.

When asked to comment on his
team's prospects, Coach Marchie
Schwartz merely said, "It's going to
be a tough game. I'll be damned
happy if we win it; when we win
it." But he seems mighty happy
about his team's attitude right now,
The rejuvenated Terrific Trojans
have already left (heir cloistered
(sic) towers and will arrive today.
They plan to stay at Pleasanton
until time to leave for Stanford
Stadium. In case you've forgotten,
the Fleet City Bluejackets oper
ated out of Pleasanton last year; it
could be wishful thinking on LI
Trojan's part.
The Figueroa Street operators arc
especially anxious to win this game;
it. would put them even for the 27-
year series. Up to now there has
been only -one tie, and prospects for
another one tomorrow are dim -
both teams have potent offenses.
FERRARO IS GIGANTIC
They're bringing along a carload
of monstrous characters, many of
whom were touted for various myth
ical "All" teams. Not the least of
thorn is giant tackle Johnny (Ele
phant Boy) Ferraro, a war-time All-
American, who figures to make Fred
Boensch earn his keep at the train
ing table.
There arc also a few other men
in that Tiojan line who have bad
plenty of newspaper clippings to
paste in their scrapbooks. Jim Cal
lanan, a former All-Coast end, had
two famous brothers lighting on
for old S.C. before he got there—
Howard and George. Another
member of a famous Trojan foot
ball family is Jackie Musick, one
of the year's finer guards.
Jeff Cravath started with a back
field full of stars, but all fell by the
wayside, either through injuries or
for other reasons. Vcrl Lillywhite,
last year's regular qb, is again hold
ing forth at that spot. The Trojan
headman is also stringing along
with two sub halfbacks in the starl
ing slots, Don Garlin and Art Bat
tle, who did right well against the
Huskies. In reserve are Terry Ra
gan, a speedster, and Henry Naumu,
a Japanese boy from Hawaii whom
Herman Wcdemeyer says is "lx'tter
than Spike Cordeiro." Also avail
able arc the two convalescents,
Mickey McCardle and Gordon Gray.
WAKEFIELD KICKS A MILE
Marchie Schwartz put his boy:;
through the usual last, night- de

and passing drill, and a short, punt-
