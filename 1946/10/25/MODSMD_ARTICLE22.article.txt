## A 						War Memorial Union? 
### 
"Ask the person next to you if he favors
building a Student Union as a War Memorial.
The chances are he will say yes." This quo
tation is lifted from the Student Union Com
mittee's open letter to the Daily, printed on
page one.
Ti e committee is calling upon the student
Lody for its mandate to continue plans for the
proposed Union. It wants to know 1) if Stan
lord students specifically want and would sup
port a U:von, and 2) once the students have
defined for themselves the needs#for a Union,
if they feel it should have top priority as a
Wdr Memorial.
Is the Union wanted and needed? Would
;i Union, as a central student gathering-place,
bp utilized to the full justification of an expen
diture running into the hundreds of thousands
of dollars? Are we using the present Union
J.icilities (e.g., the Nitery) to their maximum
cvtpacity; or are the facilities being ignored
because they are glaringly inadequate?
Are there some more fitting or more sorely
needed projects to which the students could
donate their money? For example, an Interna
tional House, or a new Medical Building in

San Francisco, or a reserve fund to retain or
to employ outstanding faculty members in the
face of high bidding from other universities.
The Union is a project not to be completed
in a few days or even a few years. The deci
sion for or against it should be made in the
light of probable future conditions, and for
the benefit of future students, not particularly
those now present on campus.
An observable trend toward "highway"
activities and interests away from campus
prompted students last year to begin investi
gation for a means to offset that trend. They
felt the need for a tangible centralization of
interest on the Stanford campus, to accent the
feeling of loyalty and responsibility to the
University. They decided on a student union
as the best possible answer. The Union Com
mittee does not want to push through the
Union without a clear-cut assurance that stu
dent opinion is behind it. We urge thorough
consideration of the question now, pleading
that students accept this major responsibility.
Campus Opinion letters to the Daily will
be turned over for consideration to the Union
Committee, and when noteworthy for all
campus consideration, printed in the Daily.

of dollars? Are we using the present Union
J.icilities (e.g., the Nitery) to their maximum
cvtpacity; or are the facilities being ignored

Are there some more fitting or more sorely
needed projects to which the students could
donate their money? For example, an Interna
tional House, or a new Medical Building in

San Francisco, or a reserve fund to retain or
to employ outstanding faculty members in the
face of high bidding from other universities.
The Union is a project not to be completed
in a few days or even a few years. The deci
sion for or against it should be made in the
light of probable future conditions, and for
the benefit of future students, not particularly
those now present on campus.
An observable trend toward "highway"
activities and interests away from campus
prompted students last year to begin investi
gation for a means to offset that trend. They
felt the need for a tangible centralization of
interest on the Stanford campus, to accent the
feeling of loyalty and responsibility to the
University. They decided on a student union
as the best possible answer. The Union Com
mittee does not want to push through the
Union without a clear-cut assurance that stu
dent opinion is behind it. We urge thorough
consideration of the question now, pleading
that students accept this major responsibility.
Campus Opinion letters to the Daily will
be turned over for consideration to the Union
Committee, and when noteworthy for all
campus consideration, printed in the Daily.
"Ask the person next to you if he favors
building a Student Union as a War Memorial.
The chances are he will say yes." This quo

page one.
Ti e committee is calling upon the student
Lody for its mandate to continue plans for the
proposed Union. It wants to know 1) if Stan
lord students specifically want and would sup
port a U:von, and 2) once the students have
defined for themselves the needs#for a Union,
if they feel it should have top priority as a
