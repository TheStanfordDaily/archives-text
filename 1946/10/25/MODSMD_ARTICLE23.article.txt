## BILL SESSION

..II you I'rosh men are going to gel gaily he
rli Ii i in vivid pajamas tonight, eh? Well, they'd
IjHut Ik.' loud. You're reviving an old Stanford tra
dition that faded with the war.
Hack in the "good ole days," the P.J.'s used to be
loud you could hear 'em in San Jose. And if you
happen to get belted with a ripe tomato tonight,
think nothing of it. It's just more tradition that's
: plashed all over your face.
And keep an eye open tonight for impersonators
in your midst. At the last big pajamarino, one of
the campus gals tucked "her hair up under a rooters'
cap. put or) a pair of gaudy P.J.'s, went to the rally
and the show downtown without the frosh men ever
pelting wise. She was slightly embarrassed at some
•if the comments she heard in the all-male audience
.it the Varsity but had a fine evening and a good
laugh on the freshmen. So tonight beware of the
curves.
And might I express an old, old sentiment with:
''To Hell With '50!"

If New York continues its inhospitable attitude,
il mis-lit well be that the UN will return to the place
of its birth, the San Francisco area. And it might
poM-ibly end up right here on the Peninsula, near
Stanford.
Can't you just see the sessions?
KEVIN (accusingly): The Russians last night
secietiy moved delegates into the back room at Ros
i.otli's which has been declared under our protecto
rate. 1 demand an explanation and restitution.
•VIOLOTOV: We took a plebiscite of the peoples
in the area involved and they voted for Russian rule.
I'll say no more until 1 talk to Joe.

BYRNES: Somebody stole my beer.
VIJAYALAKSHMI PANDIT NEHRU: The Am
erican press has viciously attacked our delegation
for birding in a drive-in. We are withdrawing our
support from the UN.
TRYGVE LIE: Gentlemen, gentlemen, I move we
make a move.
CHORUS: Aye, aye. (All exit, toward Rossotti's
with their arms around each other, singing "Beer,
Beer for Old UNO.")
Yes, world peace might definitely benefit from
such a move.

You're not going to believe this next item, 1 find
it hard to believe myself, but the guy swears it's the
truth, so help him. Remember the couple who have
been having such a terrible time finding a quiet
place to park alone together?
Well, last Sunday they decided the best thing
to do was desert the campus area entirely and get
away from people. So they drove all the way down
to Big Basin, found an old trail back up into the
hills and turned up that.
They continued until the trail was nothing more
than a path, bypassed a gate, and finally ended up
deep in the big woods.
There, alone at last, they took up the business
which had so often been interrupted. But the lad
got the feeling he was being watched.
So he glanced around and there, staring intently
in the window at them, was a large deer! Some
people just can't win.
The guy swears it really happened. Probably
the mercenary deer was just trying to learn how to
pick up a little doe.
