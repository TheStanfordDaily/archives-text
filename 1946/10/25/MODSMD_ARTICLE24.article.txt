## QUAD-SIDE

A few from the middle of the week.
One of Gordy-the-Cop's boys, armed with a
whistle and the law against bike riding on Inner
Quad, stopped a culprit, one S. D. Orintz, dismounted
him, and promptly wroti out a ticket. Eager law
students, lounging in front of their libe, had to be
held back. They wanted to charge in with text
books rampant, they wanted to help the unfortunate
Orintz beat the rap.
There's a character at Encina named Dushan An-
ius, a rather loud'guy who's known as Kilroy, not
because he writes on walls but because he comes
from Gilroy. Must be a character if substituting a
picture of his own head on a life-size portrait of
Superman means anything. Also Bob Knox of Toyon.
>.ingle, unattached, and unassigned; he's looking into
I he future when he says he's giving the best years
of his "wife" to Stanford: Across campus to Roble
is Kitty Royal, a very pleasant name, face, and voice.
She's from Virginia and brought with her a low
Southern drawl that's been called more than sensual.
( >ut of (he very near past is Stan "Moose" Wilson,
,s|)i ing quarter Bull-S'jssioner, old Hurlburt hasher,

who is vacationing here before he leaves for a State
Department job in Korea. From Building 308 in the
Village is Louis Orlopp, a farm boy from Orosi,
California, and proud of it; seems the falling price of
turkeys has disturbed him more than somewhat late
ly. Another farmer in his own cosy way is Ed Carter,
who married Stanford swimmer Marge Gestring;
they have a fine home and ten acres up on Skyline.
Ed can be found most any morning from 9 to 10
working crossword puzzles in the Cellar.
Here's one to straighten out a story about 40 first
year med students in the Village. Seems they're all
in the same building and all taking a course where
they buy a human skeleton just as the rest of us buy
a textbook. That makes 40 guys and 40 skeletons.
Being crowded and without closet space, what to do
with their skeletons was a problem. Daytime the
skeletons could have the bunks, but not at night.
They had to be stacked in a corner or put under the
bunks in pairs, so the story goes. But no, it doesn't.
The bones come apart and fit into a small box, not
hard to stow at all.
