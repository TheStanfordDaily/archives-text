# CAMPUS OPINION

To the Editor:
Tliere are cross-walks for pedestrians on the
Stanford campus, freshly painted and plainly marked
with upstanding signs which read, "Stop for Pedes
trians." Yet every day we can see motorists whizz
ing thru these cross-walks with no regard for the
pedestrians, who are left to halt, scurry and dodge
I heir way across the street as best they can. Today
about five p.m. two pedestrians essayed to cross a
street near the Physics Corner in one of these we 11 -
marked cross-walks. One motorist dutifully stopped;
two or three others forced the pedestrians to wait
while they whizzed thru at about 30 miles per hour
far too close for comfort, and from one of the motor
ists came a shouted remark which sounded very
much like "Want us to run over you?"
I am a motorist. I drive daily from Palo Alto
to "|he Farm." Then while going from my parked

car to classes I am, naturally, a pedestrian. While
1 am a motorist, I slow down or stop when I see
pedestrians in the marked cross-walks. While I
am a pedestrian, 1 believe I have a rij»ht to the same
consideration by other motorists.
Let's have observance of the rights of pedestrians
on the part of motorists, and let's have some cracking
down by the Stanford Police Depatment on the whiz
zers-lhru.
They would not get away with it in Palo Alto.
