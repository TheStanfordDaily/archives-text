## SLING TIME 
### 
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow—but tomorrow is another day.
It hasn't been so long since all the guessperts were picking Stanford to
make the rest of the schedule without a scratch. That was before the
injuries started to mount up—and before El Trojan pulled his long-delayed
renaissance. Yes, tomorrow is another day.
And it stacks up as one of the most strenuous afternoons of endeavor
the Cardinals have y r, t put in. That includes the Bruin encounter, which
wasn't exactly a Sunday school picnic. It was more like the Branner
variety.
According to all the form, all the records of past performance, all the
standards of physical condition, the Indians don't stand the slightest
ghost of a chance. The betting commissioners have already laid their
necks out on the chopping block, awaiting only the decapitating blow,
fint form sheets don't take one little thing into consideration—fighting
spirit, the will to win. That's what Stanford has ALWAYS had; that's
what Stanford has this year in even greater degree.
That spirit is what Marchie Schwartz must depend on tomorrow for
victory. It can't be just a blind, determined rush; the Stanfords don't have
the manpower. Spirit is important, but it must be an intelligent spirit—
each man out-thinking his opponent, as well as outplaying him.
(!un < lards dome Through?
Every movement of the backs behind the line has to be letter
perfect; each fake, each passing of the ball—every step. There can be no
missed blocks in the line, or anywhere else. A fighting team is known as
a squad with a lot of heart; the Cards must fight with their hearts AND
their heads. That's the only way this game can be won if the Trojans have
really found themselves.
Will the boys come through? I don't know. There are fellows on
team who have played good hall in every game. Some of them I think
are capable of playing GREAT ball. For instiliice, Fred Boensch. He
has played a sturdy, good game of ball in all four games. But if he
could forget how that protective mask bothers him, he might be one
of the greatest tackles in the country.
Then there's Mickey Titus. He's only 18 and under normal circum
stances would be playing for the frosh. But he's shown some very good
football at various times. If the pressure of filling in for a fine player like
George Quist inspires rather than depresses him, he may label himself as
a future gre^t.
And Gene Martin. The big boy is all set to do a yeoman job at two
positions. Little Dick Madigan has the fire, guts, and brains not only to
play a fine game himself, but to inspire the rest of his mates. That's only
a start on the list of names I could throw in here. But what's the use'.' It
all indicates the same thing.
Several Goo< I Men Out
Stanford is minus several men —several GOOD men—who had the bad
luck to be injured. Their replacements will fill in nobly; perhaps with no
drop in quality whatsoever. But there are fewer of them now—and foot
ball i.s no longer a 60-minute game for each player. It's too fast, too gruel
ing. But some of the boys may have to stay in there much longer than
they really should. It will take plenty of guts to do it, to keep playing at
top speed when their lungs are bursting, when every muscle aches.
If the Cards can play like they did in the second half of the U.C.L.A.
game, 1 think the odds are even. It's hard to tell. The men of Troy have
material every whit as good as that on the Farm —only more of it.
They were touted as the best in the West before the season opened. They
weren't then, but they may be now.
But there's always this to remember about U.S.C. teams —traditionally
they have been front-runners. If they can get off in front, they feel great
and really pour it on. But when they run up against unexpectedly tough
opposition, they fold. I'm not saying that's true of this team; I'm merely
dwelling on the past. In the series between the two schools, Stanford has
won 13 games to the Trojans' 12. Several of those games the Cards had
no business winning—they did it on sheer spirit, refused to accept defeat.
That could happen tomorrow.
If Stanford's boys can go in there and play the kind of game I've indi
cated, no one will ask more. Win or lose, the rest of us here at Stanford
will be as proud of our team as any previous student body has ever been
of a Rose Bowl champion. That's the way it looks from here; but tomor
row we'll know.

I'eculiar Prognostications
Last week's prognostications came out with a percentage of .750. but
I'm striking for bigger things. Everything would have been swell if it
hadn't been for those %*(•! Trojans. At least I'm honest; I could claim
that when I said "Trojan go bustky" I mean they'd bust loose with a flock
of touchdowns.
Here are this week's pearls; .
It's squirmin' Herman against Horace Gillom;
The Gaels to win. but Nevada may killom.
The Westwood Bruins meet Santa Clara;
Those poor Broncos—it iust ain't faira.*
Bears and Huskies play at Seattle;
Cal to cop, but expect a beattle.
Then to Pullman with Beaver and Cougar.
Washington State will need a luger.
Ducks will smack Vandals with a vim;
U. of Ida. is off the him.
That Cal-Husky encounter is the one of biggest interest. The Bears
are noted for a tough defense, but can't seem to get very offensive with
their opponents. This week they face a club that has been scored on 15
times in four games; if Berkeley can't score at least two on their own
hook (without breaks), we need worry no longer.
* * *
Peripatetic Paragraphing: If Howie Dallmar goes through and accepts
his offer to turn pro, it's going to be quite a blow to Everett Dean.
Stanford could reallv use him this year. But I can't find it in my heart
to blame the kid. If you were offered 10 grand under the same circum
stances. would you turn it down?
* n> *
Jim Armstrong, star forward on the top-flight water polo team, is j
nothing if not modest. I got the dope from him on the first game of the !
year, but he gave nary a mention of himself; he was just full of praise for !
everyone else. Finally I asked him if he scored any goals and he said, !
"Yes. I was lucky and got three; but you know how it is—when they set !
'em up for you, you can't miss." Of course he was only the high scorer
of the game .

Then to Pullman with Beaver and Cougar.

That Cal-Husky encounter is the one of biggest interest. The Bears
are noted for a tough defense, but can't seem to get very offensive with
their opponents. This week they face a club that has been scored on 15
times in four games; if Berkeley can't score at least two on their own
hook (without breaks), we need worry no longer.

Peripatetic Paragraphing: If Howie Dallmar goes through and accepts
his offer to turn pro, it's going to be quite a blow to Everett Dean.
Stanford could reallv use him this year. But I can't find it in my heart
to blame the kid. If you were offered 10 grand under the same circum

Jim Armstrong, star forward on the top-flight water polo team, is j
nothing if not modest. I got the dope from him on the first game of the !
year, but he gave nary a mention of himself; he was just full of praise for !
everyone else. Finally I asked him if he scored any goals and he said, !
"Yes. I was lucky and got three; but you know how it is—when they set !
'em up for you, you can't miss." Of course he was only the high scorer
of the game .
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow—but tomorrow is another day.
It hasn't been so long since all the guessperts were picking Stanford to
make the rest of the schedule without a scratch. That was before the
injuries started to mount up—and before El Trojan pulled his long-delayed
renaissance. Yes, tomorrow is another day.
And it stacks up as one of the most strenuous afternoons of endeavor
the Cardinals have y r, t put in. That includes the Bruin encounter, which
wasn't exactly a Sunday school picnic. It was more like the Branner
variety.
According to all the form, all the records of past performance, all the
standards of physical condition, the Indians don't stand the slightest
ghost of a chance. The betting commissioners have already laid their
necks out on the chopping block, awaiting only the decapitating blow,
fint form sheets don't take one little thing into consideration—fighting
spirit, the will to win. That's what Stanford has ALWAYS had; that's
what Stanford has this year in even greater degree.
That spirit is what Marchie Schwartz must depend on tomorrow for
victory. It can't be just a blind, determined rush; the Stanfords don't have
the manpower. Spirit is important, but it must be an intelligent spirit—
each man out-thinking his opponent, as well as outplaying him.
(!un < lards dome Through?
Every movement of the backs behind the line has to be letter
perfect; each fake, each passing of the ball—every step. There can be no
missed blocks in the line, or anywhere else. A fighting team is known as
a squad with a lot of heart; the Cards must fight with their hearts AND
their heads. That's the only way this game can be won if the Trojans have
really found themselves.
Will the boys come through? I don't know. There are fellows on
team who have played good hall in every game. Some of them I think
are capable of playing GREAT ball. For instiliice, Fred Boensch. He
has played a sturdy, good game of ball in all four games. But if he
could forget how that protective mask bothers him, he might be one
of the greatest tackles in the country.
Then there's Mickey Titus. He's only 18 and under normal circum
stances would be playing for the frosh. But he's shown some very good
football at various times. If the pressure of filling in for a fine player like
George Quist inspires rather than depresses him, he may label himself as
a future gre^t.
And Gene Martin. The big boy is all set to do a yeoman job at two
positions. Little Dick Madigan has the fire, guts, and brains not only to
play a fine game himself, but to inspire the rest of his mates. That's only
a start on the list of names I could throw in here. But what's the use'.' It
all indicates the same thing.
Several Goo< I Men Out
Stanford is minus several men —several GOOD men—who had the bad
luck to be injured. Their replacements will fill in nobly; perhaps with no
drop in quality whatsoever. But there are fewer of them now—and foot
ball i.s no longer a 60-minute game for each player. It's too fast, too gruel
ing. But some of the boys may have to stay in there much longer than
they really should. It will take plenty of guts to do it, to keep playing at
top speed when their lungs are bursting, when every muscle aches.
If the Cards can play like they did in the second half of the U.C.L.A.
game, 1 think the odds are even. It's hard to tell. The men of Troy have
material every whit as good as that on the Farm —only more of it.
They were touted as the best in the West before the season opened. They
weren't then, but they may be now.
But there's always this to remember about U.S.C. teams —traditionally
they have been front-runners. If they can get off in front, they feel great
and really pour it on. But when they run up against unexpectedly tough
opposition, they fold. I'm not saying that's true of this team; I'm merely
dwelling on the past. In the series between the two schools, Stanford has
won 13 games to the Trojans' 12. Several of those games the Cards had
no business winning—they did it on sheer spirit, refused to accept defeat.
That could happen tomorrow.
If Stanford's boys can go in there and play the kind of game I've indi
cated, no one will ask more. Win or lose, the rest of us here at Stanford
will be as proud of our team as any previous student body has ever been
of a Rose Bowl champion. That's the way it looks from here; but tomor
row we'll know.

I'eculiar Prognostications
Last week's prognostications came out with a percentage of .750. but
I'm striking for bigger things. Everything would have been swell if it
hadn't been for those %*(•! Trojans. At least I'm honest; I could claim
that when I said "Trojan go bustky" I mean they'd bust loose with a flock
of touchdowns.

It's squirmin' Herman against Horace Gillom;
The Gaels to win. but Nevada may killom.

they have been front-runners. If they can get off in front, they feel great
and really pour it on. But when they run up against unexpectedly tough
opposition, they fold. I'm not saying that's true of this team; I'm merely
dwelling on the past. In the series between the two schools, Stanford has
won 13 games to the Trojans' 12. Several of those games the Cards had
no business winning—they did it on sheer spirit, refused to accept defeat.
That could happen tomorrow.
If Stanford's boys can go in there and play the kind of game I've indi
cated, no one will ask more. Win or lose, the rest of us here at Stanford
will be as proud of our team as any previous student body has ever been
of a Rose Bowl champion. That's the way it looks from here; but tomor
row we'll know.

I'eculiar Prognostications
Last week's prognostications came out with a percentage of .750. but
I'm striking for bigger things. Everything would have been swell if it
hadn't been for those %*(•! Trojans. At least I'm honest; I could claim
that when I said "Trojan go bustky" I mean they'd bust loose with a flock
of touchdowns.
Here are this week's pearls; .
It's squirmin' Herman against Horace Gillom;
The Gaels to win. but Nevada may killom.
The Westwood Bruins meet Santa Clara;
Those poor Broncos—it iust ain't faira.*
Bears and Huskies play at Seattle;
Cal to cop, but expect a beattle.
Then to Pullman with Beaver and Cougar.
Washington State will need a luger.
Ducks will smack Vandals with a vim;
U. of Ida. is off the him.
That Cal-Husky encounter is the one of biggest interest. The Bears
are noted for a tough defense, but can't seem to get very offensive with
their opponents. This week they face a club that has been scored on 15
times in four games; if Berkeley can't score at least two on their own
hook (without breaks), we need worry no longer.

Peripatetic Paragraphing: If Howie Dallmar goes through and accepts
his offer to turn pro, it's going to be quite a blow to Everett Dean.
Stanford could reallv use him this year. But I can't find it in my heart
to blame the kid. If you were offered 10 grand under the same circum
stances. would you turn it down?
* n> *
Jim Armstrong, star forward on the top-flight water polo team, is j
nothing if not modest. I got the dope from him on the first game of the !
year, but he gave nary a mention of himself; he was just full of praise for !
everyone else. Finally I asked him if he scored any goals and he said, !
"Yes. I was lucky and got three; but you know how it is—when they set !
'em up for you, you can't miss." Of course he was only the high scorer
of the game .
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow—but tomorrow is another day.
It hasn't been so long since all the guessperts were picking Stanford to
make the rest of the schedule without a scratch. That was before the
injuries started to mount up—and before El Trojan pulled his long-delayed
renaissance. Yes, tomorrow is another day.
And it stacks up as one of the most strenuous afternoons of endeavor
the Cardinals have y r, t put in. That includes the Bruin encounter, which
wasn't exactly a Sunday school picnic. It was more like the Branner
variety.
According to all the form, all the records of past performance, all the
standards of physical condition, the Indians don't stand the slightest
ghost of a chance. The betting commissioners have already laid their
necks out on the chopping block, awaiting only the decapitating blow,
fint form sheets don't take one little thing into consideration—fighting
spirit, the will to win. That's what Stanford has ALWAYS had; that's
what Stanford has this year in even greater degree.
That spirit is what Marchie Schwartz must depend on tomorrow for
victory. It can't be just a blind, determined rush; the Stanfords don't have
the manpower. Spirit is important, but it must be an intelligent spirit—
each man out-thinking his opponent, as well as outplaying him.
(!un < lards dome Through?
Every movement of the backs behind the line has to be letter
perfect; each fake, each passing of the ball—every step. There can be no
missed blocks in the line, or anywhere else. A fighting team is known as
a squad with a lot of heart; the Cards must fight with their hearts AND
their heads. That's the only way this game can be won if the Trojans have
really found themselves.
Will the boys come through? I don't know. There are fellows on
team who have played good hall in every game. Some of them I think
are capable of playing GREAT ball. For instiliice, Fred Boensch. He
has played a sturdy, good game of ball in all four games. But if he
could forget how that protective mask bothers him, he might be one
of the greatest tackles in the country.
Then there's Mickey Titus. He's only 18 and under normal circum
stances would be playing for the frosh. But he's shown some very good
football at various times. If the pressure of filling in for a fine player like
George Quist inspires rather than depresses him, he may label himself as
a future gre^t.
And Gene Martin. The big boy is all set to do a yeoman job at two
positions. Little Dick Madigan has the fire, guts, and brains not only to
play a fine game himself, but to inspire the rest of his mates. That's only
a start on the list of names I could throw in here. But what's the use'.' It
all indicates the same thing.
Several Goo< I Men Out
Stanford is minus several men —several GOOD men—who had the bad
luck to be injured. Their replacements will fill in nobly; perhaps with no
drop in quality whatsoever. But there are fewer of them now—and foot
ball i.s no longer a 60-minute game for each player. It's too fast, too gruel
ing. But some of the boys may have to stay in there much longer than
they really should. It will take plenty of guts to do it, to keep playing at
top speed when their lungs are bursting, when every muscle aches.
If the Cards can play like they did in the second half of the U.C.L.A.
game, 1 think the odds are even. It's hard to tell. The men of Troy have
material every whit as good as that on the Farm —only more of it.
They were touted as the best in the West before the season opened. They
weren't then, but they may be now.

football at various times. If the pressure of filling in for a fine player like
George Quist inspires rather than depresses him, he may label himself as
a future gre^t.
And Gene Martin. The big boy is all set to do a yeoman job at two
positions. Little Dick Madigan has the fire, guts, and brains not only to
play a fine game himself, but to inspire the rest of his mates. That's only
a start on the list of names I could throw in here. But what's the use'.' It
all indicates the same thing.
Several Goo< I Men Out
Stanford is minus several men —several GOOD men—who had the bad
luck to be injured. Their replacements will fill in nobly; perhaps with no
drop in quality whatsoever. But there are fewer of them now—and foot
ball i.s no longer a 60-minute game for each player. It's too fast, too gruel
ing. But some of the boys may have to stay in there much longer than
they really should. It will take plenty of guts to do it, to keep playing at
top speed when their lungs are bursting, when every muscle aches.
If the Cards can play like they did in the second half of the U.C.L.A.
game, 1 think the odds are even. It's hard to tell. The men of Troy have
material every whit as good as that on the Farm —only more of it.
They were touted as the best in the West before the season opened. They
weren't then, but they may be now.
But there's always this to remember about U.S.C. teams —traditionally
they have been front-runners. If they can get off in front, they feel great
and really pour it on. But when they run up against unexpectedly tough
opposition, they fold. I'm not saying that's true of this team; I'm merely
dwelling on the past. In the series between the two schools, Stanford has
won 13 games to the Trojans' 12. Several of those games the Cards had
no business winning—they did it on sheer spirit, refused to accept defeat.
That could happen tomorrow.
If Stanford's boys can go in there and play the kind of game I've indi
cated, no one will ask more. Win or lose, the rest of us here at Stanford
will be as proud of our team as any previous student body has ever been
of a Rose Bowl champion. That's the way it looks from here; but tomor
row we'll know.

I'eculiar Prognostications
Last week's prognostications came out with a percentage of .750. but
I'm striking for bigger things. Everything would have been swell if it
hadn't been for those %*(•! Trojans. At least I'm honest; I could claim
that when I said "Trojan go bustky" I mean they'd bust loose with a flock
of touchdowns.
Here are this week's pearls; .
It's squirmin' Herman against Horace Gillom;
The Gaels to win. but Nevada may killom.
The Westwood Bruins meet Santa Clara;
Those poor Broncos—it iust ain't faira.*
Bears and Huskies play at Seattle;
Cal to cop, but expect a beattle.
Then to Pullman with Beaver and Cougar.
Washington State will need a luger.
Ducks will smack Vandals with a vim;
U. of Ida. is off the him.
That Cal-Husky encounter is the one of biggest interest. The Bears
are noted for a tough defense, but can't seem to get very offensive with
their opponents. This week they face a club that has been scored on 15
times in four games; if Berkeley can't score at least two on their own
hook (without breaks), we need worry no longer.

Peripatetic Paragraphing: If Howie Dallmar goes through and accepts
his offer to turn pro, it's going to be quite a blow to Everett Dean.
Stanford could reallv use him this year. But I can't find it in my heart
to blame the kid. If you were offered 10 grand under the same circum
stances. would you turn it down?

Jim Armstrong, star forward on the top-flight water polo team, is j
nothing if not modest. I got the dope from him on the first game of the !
year, but he gave nary a mention of himself; he was just full of praise for !
everyone else. Finally I asked him if he scored any goals and he said, !
"Yes. I was lucky and got three; but you know how it is—when they set !
'em up for you, you can't miss." Of course he was only the high scorer
of the game .
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow—but tomorrow is another day.
It hasn't been so long since all the guessperts were picking Stanford to
make the rest of the schedule without a scratch. That was before the
injuries started to mount up—and before El Trojan pulled his long-delayed
renaissance. Yes, tomorrow is another day.
And it stacks up as one of the most strenuous afternoons of endeavor
the Cardinals have y r, t put in. That includes the Bruin encounter, which
wasn't exactly a Sunday school picnic. It was more like the Branner
variety.
According to all the form, all the records of past performance, all the
standards of physical condition, the Indians don't stand the slightest
ghost of a chance. The betting commissioners have already laid their
necks out on the chopping block, awaiting only the decapitating blow,
fint form sheets don't take one little thing into consideration—fighting
spirit, the will to win. That's what Stanford has ALWAYS had; that's
what Stanford has this year in even greater degree.
That spirit is what Marchie Schwartz must depend on tomorrow for
victory. It can't be just a blind, determined rush; the Stanfords don't have
the manpower. Spirit is important, but it must be an intelligent spirit—
each man out-thinking his opponent, as well as outplaying him.
(!un < lards dome Through?
Every movement of the backs behind the line has to be letter
perfect; each fake, each passing of the ball—every step. There can be no
missed blocks in the line, or anywhere else. A fighting team is known as
a squad with a lot of heart; the Cards must fight with their hearts AND
their heads. That's the only way this game can be won if the Trojans have
really found themselves.
Will the boys come through? I don't know. There are fellows on
team who have played good hall in every game. Some of them I think
are capable of playing GREAT ball. For instiliice, Fred Boensch. He
has played a sturdy, good game of ball in all four games. But if he
could forget how that protective mask bothers him, he might be one
of the greatest tackles in the country.
Then there's Mickey Titus. He's only 18 and under normal circum
stances would be playing for the frosh. But he's shown some very good
football at various times. If the pressure of filling in for a fine player like
George Quist inspires rather than depresses him, he may label himself as
