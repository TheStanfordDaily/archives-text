U.N. ASSEMBLY lIALL, Flush
ing Meadows, N.Y., Ocl. 24 (UP). —
Mexico, Belgium and Peru charged
in the U.N. Assembly today that
abuse of the veto power impeded
peace and tarnished the prestige of
the U.N. Security Council.
U.N. Secretary General Trygve
Lie called for U.N. action to restore
liberty and democracy in Spain.
Belgium, accusing the Franco re
gime of harboring the Belgian Fas
cist traitor Leon Degrelle, announced
she would raise the issue at a later
stage of the Assembly meeting.
Thus at the outset of the annual
Assembly of the 51 United Nations,
two of the most delicate problems in
world politics were raised by the
small countries which have as big a
say as the great parliament of na
tions.
Dr. Francisco Castillo Najera, of
Mcxico. opening general debate, said
the problem of the veto power—"or
more precisely the form in which it
has been used"—was to blame for
lack of progress in consolidating
peace.
"What disturbs us," Castillo Na
jera said, "is the probability — not
alone the possibility—that the veto
will paralyze the best intentions of
our organization and with it the
principal hope of arriving at a per
manent peace."
Van Langenhove, of Belgium, said
he did not ask cancellation of the
veto power because all countries
were not yet disposed to yield to a
majority decision.
"What the Belgian delegation lias
fought and fights still is the exces
sive extension given to the veto rule
and the abuse made in its use . . . ,"
Van Langenhove said.
