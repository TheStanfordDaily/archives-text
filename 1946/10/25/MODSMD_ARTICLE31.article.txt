Stanford water polo fans will be
afforded their first glimpse of the
championship caliber Indian seven
tomorrow morning as U.S.C. visits
the Encina pool. All predictions a$
to the outcome are unanimous in
expecting Stanford to make their
initial home appearance a winning
one. In order not to conflict with
the afternoon football date, tomor
row morning's water battle is
scheduled for 10 o'clock.
News from the Trojan campus
has taken on an optimistic note,
even though the men of Troy looked
futile two weeks ago when the In
dians rolled up an 11-5 score down
south. Most of the brave enthu
siasm was centered around the re
appearance of a number of the key
men in pre-war U.S.C. teams,
teams. Whether Coach Bittke can
whip up an organized offensive with
the new talent is the important
question of the moment. The Tro
jans must improve their game a
great deal before they can hope to
stop the championship - bound In
dians.
