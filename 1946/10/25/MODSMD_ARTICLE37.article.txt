# Free Guidance Offered To Vets
## 
### 
A complete guidance service is available free of charge to all
veterans attending Stanford under Public Law 346 or 16. This
service, under the direction of Mr. George D. Barahal, Veterans
Administration representative on campus, was started this fall.
The guidance consists of a battery of tests and interviews

with vocational counselors. Apti
tude, Vocational Interest, Personal
ity, Achievement, and Performance
Tests are included in the survey.
Manual Dexterity Tests and the
Strong Vocational Interest tests are
included. The tests are designed to
(it the possible interests of every
person.
TEST APTITUDES
The object of this program is to
help the veteran decide the voca
ton lor which he is most suited. A
number of the persons already test
ed have found that their problem in
getting adjusted was caused by their
studying something which did not
fit their aptitude.
The Veterans' Guidance Bureau
has had demands far beyond the
number which it can cover imme
diately. Consequently, they are
booked up until the end of Novem
ber. Mr. Barahal explained that any
veteran who wishes to do so may
make an appointment at the office,
room 170, Ad Building, now and
he will be taken as soon as possible.
Any person with a particularly
pressing problem may be taken now
if at all possible.
EIGHT-HOUR TESTS
The tests and interviews take at
least eight hours, but this time is
scattered at the convenience of the
veteran. There is no obligation for
veterans at Stanford under the G.I.
Bill to accept the advice, but it may
get rid of any uncertainties as to
the field they are studying. These
tests would cost $30 to $50 any other
place.
All veterans who are studying un
der Public Law 16, pertaining to dis
abled veterans, must take this guid
ance before being eligible for this.
After the tests are taken, recom
mendations are made to the Veter
ans' Co-ordinator, who may approve
them. Having Mr. Day on campus
makes it possible to take care of
everything without sending the
cards to San Francisco.
PUBLIC LAW l(i
Mr. Barahal stated that there may
be a number of veterans at Stan
ford who are coming under the G.I.
Bill who might be eligible to come
under Public Law l(i. Any person
who has 10 per cent or more disa
bility may be eligible. Public Law
16 may entitle the veteran to a little
more pay, and there is no limit to
tuition expenses under this law.
