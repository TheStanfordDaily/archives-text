LONDON, Oct. 24 (UP).—Prime
Minister Clement Attlec and Win
ston Churchill attacked Russia again
today, leading observers to believe
the Labor and Conservative parties
may soon form a single front on
foreign policy.
Attlec. speaking before the Trades
Union Congress in Brighton, as
sailed the "wall of ignorance" the
Russian government has built
around her 180.000,000 people and
denounced the Soviet credo that
only a Communist country can be
democratic.
' Everyone who does not take or
ders from the Communists is de
scribed as a Fascist," Attlec said.
He also hit at the "fantastic mis
representation of the world outside"
of Russian newspapers.
"Democracy is a much - abused
word." Attlee declared. "It is often
used by those who have never un
derstood or practiced democratic
principles to mean achievement of
power by hook, or more often by
crook, by the Communist party,
while freedom means denial of lib
erty to all those who refuse to ac
cept the Communist philosophy."
