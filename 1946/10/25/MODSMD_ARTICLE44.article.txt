## Become a Student Cop 
### 
Men are urgently needed to act
as student cops for two important
events: the two U.S.C. dances this
coming Saturday night and the Big
Game Gaieties.
Those students interested should
call Ty Norton at 8819 or at the
A.S.S.U. office. All student police
will be paid 75 cents an hour for
their services.
