## 
### 
Cardinals is still working on
1 transportation to the Big Game for
students who do not intend to drive
1 to Berkeley, Nov. 23.
Mel Swift, Cardinals member,
said yesterday that a special train
ton Id be provided by Southern
Pacific, costing $1.05 from the
Palo Alto station to First and
Broadway in Oakland and mak
ing the run in about an hour and
a half. From there street cars
could be taken to the stadium for
1(1 cents. Milk, coke, and sand
wiches would be provided in the
club cars.
Swift said that contracting for the
special train would depend on the
j number of students who sign up.
Cardinals must guarantee several
hundred. He said exact procedure
for signing up will be announced
1 j very soon.
He added that at previous Big
Games the ear-parking problem at
1 the Cal stadium has induced many
t to take the train.
