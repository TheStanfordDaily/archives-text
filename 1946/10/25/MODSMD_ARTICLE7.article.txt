# Wage Controls May Be Removed Shortly
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 24 (UP).â€”
An indication that removal of
wage controls may begin soon be
cause of the sweeping decontrol
of foods and other consumer
products came from President
Truman today.
Mr. Truman sidestepped all di
rect comment on lite critical ques
tion of continuing wage restric
tions while the lid is coming off
all but the most essential and
scarce items entering into the na
tional cost of living.
But, when asked whether wage
controls would be lifted by Nov.
1, the President said the answer
to that question would be found
in the meat decontrol speech he
made 10 days ago.
At that time, he called attention
to the "close relationship between
wages and prices" and said that
the removal of wage controls
would be accelerated as the price
decontrol program gathers speed.
