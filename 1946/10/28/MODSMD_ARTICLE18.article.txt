### 
The music of Harry James and his orchestra will provide thi
background for this year's Big Game Dance at tho University
of California.
The affair, to be held in the Men's Gym at Cal, will begin a
0 o'clock on the evening of Nov. 23, following the Big Game

Climaxing three days of Home
coming activity at. Cal, which arc to
include a rally Thursday night, the
alumni reception Friday, the tra
ditional parade through Berkeley
and the "Axe-Travagarun" Friday
evening, the Biy Game Dance will
make its appearance after a three
year absence on the Farm.
The tradition of the Big Game
Dance was born only after much
struggle.
Hack in l!)Ii!) Larry Livingston
spearheaded a drive to provide the
first of these I ig social events.
Much opposition to the idea arose,
mostly over feats that student sup
port would fail to pay for the affair.
Given a 48 - hour deadline to
meet, a student committee set out
madly to obtain an orchestra
within (he financial limits set by
Exeom. Phones rang between Los
Angeles, San Francisco, and Brit
ish Columbia, over a dozen tele
grams were dispatched, and final
ly—just some five hours before
the deadline — contracts wen;
signed with Jimmy Grier's Or
chestra and the first Big Game
Dance was on its way.
Successive years have found
Stanfordites dancing to the hands
of Freddy Nagel (1940), Lu Walters
and Gene Knglandef (1941), and
Gary Nottingham (194<.').
The first affair went over the
top financially, despite alt pre
vious fears, when some 700 per
sons turned out at $5 per bid.
Bids for this year's Big Game
Dance will shortly go on salt! to
Stanford students at $"J. GO each.
