## That Stanford Spirit 
### 
While the reserve strength of the Stanford
football team was not enough to stop Troy on
the field, the reserves of "Stanford spirit"
demonstrated Saturday were more than
enough to stamp the USC contest as tops for
rooting section performance.
The yell leading, the singing, the co-opera
tion the students with Rally Com in the card
stunts and with their yell leaders, and the sus
tained spirit of the section was excellent.
Blame for the greatest foul-up of the after
noon rrri t go to the Trojan leaders, who, af
flicted v ith a weird conception of liming, de
cided to sing their school hymn in the stands
before crossing the field to serenade our sec
tion.
And then as the confused Stanfords opened
iif) with their own hymn, the Trojan circus
began its march across the field. The Stanford
sectJon was magnificent in attempting to com
ix !e with the full blast of the Trojan band, but
was losing ground until the band leader, rec
ognising the situation, stopped the carnage,
d< 'fed his plumed cap and waited for us to
finish. It was the only intelligent act by a
[JSC representative in the whole proceedings.
Afle, both hymns had been sung* any further
seieuading could only be anti-climactic.
In direct contrast with the glum silence of
tin? USC section throughout the first half was
fl.e :;plendid manner in which the Stanford
.section rose to its feet in the fourth quarter to

cheer the Indian team coming back up the
field after USC had blasted through to its final
touchdown and there was no further doubt as
to the ultimate winner.
The only suggestion we might offer our
yell leaders is that they set the pitch for the
"Roll on You Indian Team" yell. In pre-war
days, the yell leader always started the entire
section on pitch so that the effectiveness of
the sonorous chant was not diminished by the
"flatting out" of a large portion of the partici
pants. Otherwise, almost all the yell leaders
showed great improvement over their past
performances.
The Axe Yell in the second half was excel
lent, egualling in performance, if not in results,
the unforgettable Axe Yell in 1940 in the sec
ond half of the Washington-Stanford game
when the Indians, ten points behind, immedi
ately after the yell stopped another Husky
march deep in their own territory and then
erupted with three touchdowns and the game,
20 to 10.
Although the game was lost Saturday and
any remaining Rose Bowl hopes went a-glim
mering, the Stanford team has identified itself
as a hard-hitting, dangerous team that refuses
to admit defeat. And if the rooting section can
retain its high pitch of last Saturday for the
rest of the season, the team will know that the
student body is supporting them in the way
they richly deserve. F.B.

In direct contrast with the glum silence of
tin? USC section throughout the first half was
fl.e :;plendid manner in which the Stanford
.section rose to its feet in the fourth quarter to

cheer the Indian team coming back up the
field after USC had blasted through to its final
touchdown and there was no further doubt as
to the ultimate winner.
The only suggestion we might offer our
yell leaders is that they set the pitch for the
"Roll on You Indian Team" yell. In pre-war
days, the yell leader always started the entire
section on pitch so that the effectiveness of
the sonorous chant was not diminished by the
"flatting out" of a large portion of the partici
pants. Otherwise, almost all the yell leaders
showed great improvement over their past
performances.
The Axe Yell in the second half was excel
lent, egualling in performance, if not in results,
the unforgettable Axe Yell in 1940 in the sec
ond half of the Washington-Stanford game
when the Indians, ten points behind, immedi
ately after the yell stopped another Husky
march deep in their own territory and then
erupted with three touchdowns and the game,
20 to 10.
Although the game was lost Saturday and
any remaining Rose Bowl hopes went a-glim
mering, the Stanford team has identified itself
as a hard-hitting, dangerous team that refuses
to admit defeat. And if the rooting section can
retain its high pitch of last Saturday for the
rest of the season, the team will know that the
student body is supporting them in the way
they richly deserve. F.B.
While the reserve strength of the Stanford
football team was not enough to stop Troy on
the field, the reserves of "Stanford spirit"
demonstrated Saturday were more than
enough to stamp the USC contest as tops for
rooting section performance.
The yell leading, the singing, the co-opera
tion the students with Rally Com in the card
stunts and with their yell leaders, and the sus
tained spirit of the section was excellent.
Blame for the greatest foul-up of the after
noon rrri t go to the Trojan leaders, who, af
flicted v ith a weird conception of liming, de
cided to sing their school hymn in the stands
before crossing the field to serenade our sec
