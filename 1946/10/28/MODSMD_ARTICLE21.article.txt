Wliiittii weekend, whatta weekend!

What a I attle! It took the "Star Spangled Ban
ner" to slop it. It's surprising that no one was really
reriou.-ly hurl. Apparently the lesson taught by the
d( :11 h of one of the participants in a Row-Frosh fra

Th ■ Irosh really took the Roble beachhead with
a concerted invasion plan that looked as though
there was much previous organization to it.
In pre-war years, there were always enough po
lieemcn surrounding Roble so that it looked like a
Folic men's Ball, but Friday night the gendarmes
must have underestimated the Class of '50. (And
In control the brawl at the Pavilion, there was just
or..' .student cop. One man in that howling mob was
like using a w ter pistol to put out the Chicago
fire.)
The Irosh men got into Roble and in great num
bei, . It was quite a while before the last of them
was escorted politely and firmly out. The frosh
v/omi n showed they had a little spirit of their own
by throwing some of the invaders into the showers.
(Jeez, what a cold I've got today!)

S.C. may not go to the Rose Bowl but they've
certainly won the P C C. title for card stunts. It used
to be that Ucla yearly was the best in the West
when it came to waving the pretty pasteboards, but
that Trojan section Saturday had some of the most
original and neatly executed stunts seen in a long

After Saturday's game, Lloyd Merriman was wait
ing for his girl at one of the halls on the Row. lie
wits sipping a cup of coffee one of the girls had
given him while he passed the inevitably lengthy
time it takes a girl to get ready.
One of the sweete? young things in the house, not
recognizing him at first, offered to take his coffee
cup when he finished.
"Thank you," said Lloyd.
Then the light dawned on the soph gal.
"Thank YOU." she breathed in ecstasy and floated
off toward the kitchen. There, she put, the cup up
on a shelf, marked it with a sign stating that "Lloyd
Merriman drank from this cup" and insisting that it
remain unwashed. Then she went around telling
everyone about her GREAT moment.
She stiil hasn't gotten over it.

In the same tong, there seems to be an amazing
number of girls who talk in their sleep. (I've got
good ears, so shut up!) The best is one who every
time the sleeping porch door opens while she is
asleep invariably says, "Hello," to the newcomer.
And continues sleeping soundly.
But of course, the most interesting is the one who
one night recently gave a deep sigh and murmured,
"Kiss me." The other girls waited expectantly for
the rest of the little drama but all they heard was
another long sigh and then a silence more eloquent
than words. So they turned their attention to two
more who were arguing in their sleep, "Yes, it is";
"No. it isn't"; "Yes, it is"; "No, it isn't," etc.
Never a dull moment at that tong, but three
fellows in the house next door nearly fell off their
sleeping porch last week trying to hear what was
going on.
