Will' NOT A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS?
One argument advanced against the anticipat
r'l ( lection of a Republican Congress is that it
wouldn't be able to get along, or wouldn't want to
(i along, with the President. This argument is
based apparently on the premise that the results
of disagreement between the two blanches arc
necessarily bad. Without going back into the his
tory of all the administrations in which different
parties have controlled the executive and legis
lative departments, I can give one answer to the
proponents of this point of view.
That is to be drawn from the recent battle over
economic controls. There the Administration went
all mil lor price controls and the Republicans went
all out for their removal. Technically the Admin
istration won Ibis summer. A new price control bill
was passed. Actually, popular opinion and the eco
nomics of the free market together defeated the
Administration. Most controls have now been re
moved, by an Administration that fought to the
hitler end to retain (hem.
The adherents of the President, who guided him
to his stand in favor of price control, are human and
th rd'ore fallible. With the best intentions in the
world and with absolute faith in their .economics,
they attempted to continue war-time controls. The
Congress, and particularly the Republican members
of the Congress, refused to credit either the inten
tion . or the economics of the Administration group.
II the results of decontrol had been as disastrous as
the Administration prophets foretold, then repre-

sentative, constitutional government would have
been sadly discredited. So, the $fJ4 question is, what
are the results of decontrol likely to be?
Best current estimates of the results, based on
the developments of last week and on reasonable
forecasts, completely justify the independence and
determination of the Repiftdicans in Congress. N<Â»
one doubted that more meat would be available if
controls were removed. But the prices of meat,
after the skyrocketing reaction of the first few
days of decontrol, have already begun to decline.
Highly speculative cotton prices have broken
sharply. Certain standard indices of commodity
futures, forecasts of economic conditions to come,
have declined substantially. Many economists had
predicted the leveling-off and decline of prices
throughout 1i) 17; now it would appear that decon
trol has advanced the process.
The conclusion that I draw from the whole of the
foregoing discussion is that it might not be a bad
idea to elect a Republican Congress; a Congress that
will hot be satisfied with rubber-stamping the deci
sions of men from Missouri.
What do the Democrats stand for, anyway? A
good illustration of their current confusion is Will
Rogers, Jr., who is running for the job of Senator
from California, against the incumbent Senator
Knowland. Young Rogers has an excellent comhal
record and plenty of public spirit. But his support
ers include ex-Oklahomans, Roosevelts hist in from
New York, Southern Democrats, labor Democrats,
and Hollywood Democrats. He'll be an able man
indeed that can satisfy all of (hose constituents.
