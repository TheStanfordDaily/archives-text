## Mud and Smashed Plug Hats Produce Some Growing Pains 
### BILL HORNBY 
Once upon a time when Stanford
was very young, the number of
bulging biceps in the various classes
was a matter of direct concern to
each i'rosh, soph, junior, or senior.
Now-forgotten "class spirit" was
'.he prime mover for the extra-cur
ricular activities, and the black eye
and broken nose sometimes served
to place a man's class membership
and loyalty.
One of these early social occasions
was the frosh-soph mud fight, rele
gated in these more effete times to
the memories of the paunchy and
near-paunchy alums.
Stanford was new in the 1890's,
and i( was pioneer in spirit. A
desire to "show" the Eastern col
leges we could have thrilling class
rivalries too. plus a general lean
ing of the type of "rough" then in
school toward physical expres
sion. produced some wonderful
slaughter.
The frosh-soph rivalry began as
a brawl over which class numerals
should grace the old water tower.
Then organizers.stepped in to make
it sort of a mob touch football game,
with the carryirtf4 of the ball by
two or three hundred men secondary
to the proboscis rearranging.
Then came the "tie-up" which
made the supreme achievement the
kidnapping of numbers of the op
position. gagged and bound.
The conservatives kept trying to
tone down the annual affair, and in
1923 a mud fight on the bed of Lake
Lagunita was installed, supposedly
to pare down the permanent dam
age. Some rocks must have gotten
into the mud, for by 1928 this fight
was officially banned.
In mo and 1931 it returned,
and during the later '.'NTs the idea
of a frosh raid on the How gradu
ally took (he place of more sta
tionary corn hat. This came to an
end pre-war when a Beta was
killed in 1940 in a fall during an
Mil cilia raid.
The old Plug-Ugly fights used to

keep the juniors and seniors occu
pied while their younger brethren
were playing in the mud.
In 1894 the juniors began buying
plug hats to set them off from the
common herd. These "plugs" were
squat top hats heavily coated with
white lead. They were decorated
with every color and design lurking
in th" fertile undergraduate mind.
Gibson Girls, rainbows, Stanford
trees, corsets, etc., went up and
down the Quad on the heads of the
cocky juniors.
By 18£8 these hats had become
such a colorful part of the Stanford
scene that the idea of an annual
"Plug-Ugly" celebration to glorify
the institution took place. Until
1900 this was a comparatively harm
less bonfire rally during which a
huge "plug" was paraded. Gradu
ally the "Plug-Ugly" grew into a
show, sort of a one-class Gaieties.
The sophs and the seniors had
been frustrated in their desire to
smash the hats. In 1901 the sophs
demanded free admission to the
"IMug-Ugly" ceremonial. Denied,
(hey and (he seniors moved in and

began (he ha( - smashing which
became an annual event.
In 1905 the seniors broke up the
juniors' show by filching a script
and helping out with some additions
from the audience. That year the
juniors donned their hats as war
helmets. The thing ended up on the
Post Office steps with seniors, jun
iors, sophs, and frosh belting freely.
Later the slaughter adjourned to
the football field for more swinging
room.

Once upon a time when Stanford
was very young, the number of
bulging biceps in the various classes
was a matter of direct concern to
each i'rosh, soph, junior, or senior.
Now-forgotten "class spirit" was
'.he prime mover for the extra-cur
ricular activities, and the black eye
and broken nose sometimes served
to place a man's class membership
and loyalty.
One of these early social occasions
was the frosh-soph mud fight, rele
gated in these more effete times to
the memories of the paunchy and
near-paunchy alums.
Stanford was new in the 1890's,
and i( was pioneer in spirit. A
desire to "show" the Eastern col
leges we could have thrilling class
rivalries too. plus a general lean
ing of the type of "rough" then in
school toward physical expres
sion. produced some wonderful
slaughter.
The frosh-soph rivalry began as
a brawl over which class numerals
should grace the old water tower.
Then organizers.stepped in to make
it sort of a mob touch football game,
with the carryirtf4 of the ball by
two or three hundred men secondary
to the proboscis rearranging.
Then came the "tie-up" which
made the supreme achievement the
kidnapping of numbers of the op
position. gagged and bound.
The conservatives kept trying to
tone down the annual affair, and in
1923 a mud fight on the bed of Lake
Lagunita was installed, supposedly
to pare down the permanent dam
age. Some rocks must have gotten
into the mud, for by 1928 this fight
was officially banned.
In mo and 1931 it returned,
and during the later '.'NTs the idea
of a frosh raid on the How gradu
ally took (he place of more sta
tionary corn hat. This came to an
end pre-war when a Beta was
killed in 1940 in a fall during an
Mil cilia raid.
The old Plug-Ugly fights used to

keep the juniors and seniors occu
pied while their younger brethren
were playing in the mud.
In 1894 the juniors began buying
plug hats to set them off from the
common herd. These "plugs" were
squat top hats heavily coated with
white lead. They were decorated
with every color and design lurking
in th" fertile undergraduate mind.
Gibson Girls, rainbows, Stanford
trees, corsets, etc., went up and
