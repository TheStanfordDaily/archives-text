# BLESSED EVENT AT LIEBENDOREERS'
## 
### 
History did some repeating for itself Saturday afternoon as S.A.C. Pub
licity Director Don E. Liebendorfer's family added another member.
Fourteen years ago, on the day of another Stanford-Southern Califor
nia football game, Don Eâ€ž Jr., the Liebendorfers' first son. was born; and
Saturday at 5:17 John Terence Liebendorfer was born. Both mother and
child are doing nicely.
