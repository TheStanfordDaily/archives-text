# Water Poloists Swamp Trojan Varsity by 12-6
## 
### BOB BULLOCK 
Disposing of an impotent Southern California water polo team
with ease and dispatch, the rampaging Stanford Indians treated
a large crowd of excited local fans to an exhibition of perfection
with a 12-6 victory Saturday.
The issue was never in doubt at any point in the bruising

which saw the ehampionship-
J bound Indian splashers pile up a
I commanding 10-point lead before
j the Trojans could even scoi'e. Af
terwards the Stanford reserves were
I given a good workout, while the
| rugged Trojans fought back to score
I five anti-climactic markers in the
final quarter. But the damage had
been done, the Indians coasting in
to an easy lop-sided triumph.
As a result of Saturday morn
ing's victory, Stanford leads the
Conference race with three victo
ries and no defeats. Next week
end the Bears from Berkeley will
visit the Farm in a "crucial" meet
ing which may well decide the
championship.
t Outstanding in the brilliant offen
| sive pattern ol the locals, Harry
| Borchers led the Indians from his
center forward position by calmly
tossing home four points, and Jim
Armstrong continued his scoring
spree as he accounted for three of
j the overwhelming Stanford scores.
The remainder of the scoring was
i equally distributed between Em
mett Cashin, Duncan Pattic, Al
Weeden, Walter Lull and Bell, each
tallying one point for the Indian
j cause. At the same time the ster
! ling defensive play of Goalie Car
: penter kept Southern California at
J bay. He was aided by the combined
talents of Dick Narver, Silvio On
esti. Bill Rule, and Bill Ernst.
