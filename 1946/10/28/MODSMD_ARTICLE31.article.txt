### DON DAVIES 
Putting together a first-quarter
touchdown, and a second quarter
safety, Stanford's underdog Junior
Varsity footballers upset the Jav
vees from Southern California, 9-7,
in Saturday's stadium preliminary
to the Indian-Trojan varsity colli
sion.
Coach Ed Stamm's charges played
a good defensive game, holding the
Trobabes at bay until the final pe
riod. However, the"little Cards, with
the exception of Ken Peck, who
played a hangup game at right half,
showed little offensive punch.
The Indians jumped into the
lead in the first quarter when
Peck intercepted a Trojan pass on
his own 40-yard line, and romped
60 yards for six points. Little
Willie Alius trotted onto the field
just long enough to kick the extra
point and make the score 7-0.
Neither team could get moving in
the second period. The referees
provided the chief yardage gain and
loss, calling numerous long penal
ties. Lat? in the period, however,
the alert Stanford line added two
points to the Indian total.
Dean Dill, Trojan quarterback,
faded almost to his own goal line to
throw a long forward. Sid Smith,
Howie Council and Jim Fix broke
through the Trobabe line, chased
Dill into the end zone, and smeared
him for a safety. The score at half
time stood Stanford 9. USC 0.
The teams raced through the
shortened third period, exchang
ing kicks and penalties, with nei
ther team straying far from mid
field.
In the final quarter, the USC
squad came to life, and their ad
vertised offense started to click. Dill
threw a pass from his own 36 into
the arms of Bill Gibson on the 50,
and Gibson cut for the sidelines and
scampered 50 yards for a score. The
conversion by Gibson was good and
Stanford's lead was narrowed to 9-7.
The aggressive Trobabes threat
ened again when Dill intercepted
Dave Field's pass on the USC 42.
Dill connected with Gibson again
for 7 yards. A line buck netted 7
more, and on the next play a Dill to
Gibson pass moved the Trojans all
the way to the Stanford 26.
The Stanford forward wall tight
ened up and stopped the Trojan
drive on the 21.

squad came to life, and their ad
vertised offense started to click. Dill
threw a pass from his own 36 into
the arms of Bill Gibson on the 50,
and Gibson cut for the sidelines and
scampered 50 yards for a score. The
conversion by Gibson was good and
Stanford's lead was narrowed to 9-7.
The aggressive Trobabes threat
ened again when Dill intercepted
Dave Field's pass on the USC 42.
Dill connected with Gibson again
for 7 yards. A line buck netted 7
more, and on the next play a Dill to
Gibson pass moved the Trojans all
the way to the Stanford 26.
The Stanford forward wall tight
ened up and stopped the Trojan
drive on the 21.
Putting together a first-quarter
touchdown, and a second quarter
safety, Stanford's underdog Junior
Varsity footballers upset the Jav
vees from Southern California, 9-7,
in Saturday's stadium preliminary
to the Indian-Trojan varsity colli
sion.
Coach Ed Stamm's charges played
a good defensive game, holding the
Trobabes at bay until the final pe
riod. However, the"little Cards, with
the exception of Ken Peck, who
played a hangup game at right half,
showed little offensive punch.
The Indians jumped into the
lead in the first quarter when
Peck intercepted a Trojan pass on
his own 40-yard line, and romped
60 yards for six points. Little
Willie Alius trotted onto the field
just long enough to kick the extra
point and make the score 7-0.
Neither team could get moving in
the second period. The referees
provided the chief yardage gain and
loss, calling numerous long penal
ties. Lat? in the period, however,
the alert Stanford line added two
points to the Indian total.
Dean Dill, Trojan quarterback,
faded almost to his own goal line to
throw a long forward. Sid Smith,
Howie Council and Jim Fix broke
through the Trobabe line, chased
Dill into the end zone, and smeared
him for a safety. The score at half
time stood Stanford 9. USC 0.
The teams raced through the
shortened third period, exchang
ing kicks and penalties, with nei
ther team straying far from mid
field.
