## SLING TIME Fickle Fortune Frowns And There Goes a Game 
### 
It was a tough one to lose! damn tough, especially
after the way it started. But anyone fin the campus
who isn't proud of those boys after the battle they
put up can't be called a Stanford man. They played
their hearts out; with a little luck on their side, they'd
have turned the trick.
I mean the two long runs Lloyd .Merriman made
which were called hack. '1 he penalties were no
body s fault; just one of those things that happen.
Then there were the two occasions when Buck
Brownson decided to run on fourth down. If he'd
made it, he d be a hero. McCardle was doing the
same thing, and getting away with it. And so on.
But I'll say this—l've seen quite a few football
teams, and played on a couple myself, but this is the
one that goes down in my book as my favorite of
them all. For sheer spirit and will to win, I've never
seen their equal. They never had their daufbers down
once, although thoy were fighting against terrific
odds. Just remember that.
* * *
They were out-manned but not out-fought; out
scored but not out-spirited. I'd rather cheer for a
bunch ol fellows like that who lose than a squad of
quitters who run up big scores on weak opposition.
Madigan and Hachten played a great game at guard;
Flatland played his heart out at center. The big fel
low's replacement, Dorsey Kindler, did as well. Fieri
Boenseh played the type of ball of which I'd always
thought him capable. Charley Wakefield outplayed
the two men who were on his neck—until he was
almost too tired to stand up. The ends showed a 100
per cent improvement. The backs were magnificent.
>!« * *
Jeff Cravath deserves a lot of credit for the job
he's done in bringing the Trojans back into conten
tion. These Trojans had a bigger team with more
reserves, but they didn't lack for spirit either. It's
the first Trojan team I ever heard of that didn't
fold up after three touchdowns had been scored on
it. They 11 give the Bruins quite an argument next
month.
COME JOIN THE BAND
It was a great game and a great spectacle. The
40,000 people who could have come and didn't should
kick themselves. It was the sort of a colorful event
we used to see before the war. The two bands were
drilled to perfection, and the people who planned the
half-time events showed a lot of originality.
The friendly, sportsmanlike conduct of the Trojan
people was something to be remembered and emu
lated. All too often bad feeling is shown between root
ing sections, but there was nothing of that sort Sat
urday.

The Stanford band, although it also was out
manned, does not have to be ashamed. That writing
gentleman who claimed there were a lot of non-play
ing lingers should have his ears examined. In years
gone by. kids from nearby high schools were used,
but they all could play their instruments even as
Troy recruits from Hollywood High. But that is a
thing of the past for Stanford.
Let me assure (he esteemed gentleman from San
Francisco that there are no non-playing members,
and that all the handsin«i are regularly enrolled
students. They all blow lull time. I have this on
very good authority—a bandsman friend of mine,
who is the biggest wind I know.
* * *
Stanford might take a leaf from the Trojan note
book and hire a few girls to come join the band. The
Trojans had several, and they did mighty well. 1 was
especially interested in that lady who pounded the
kettledrums drawn by a team of children; she never
missed a beat. But their glockenspiel man was from
hunger.
BERKELEY BUBBLE BURSTS
The San Francisco sportswliters, always eager to
jump aboard the Berkeley bandwagon at the slightest
excuse, have had their fingers burned again. Wash
ington wasn't much, but she had too much for poor
Cal. The old Slinger told you after they beat St.
Mary's that the Gold and Blue men were all carrying
pockets full of rabbit feet.
Jack McDonald of the Call-Bulletin was the only
man among the press at the Cal-U.C.I/. A. game that
called the turn, ile pointed out that the Bruins
didn't use half their stuff against Cal; after Itossi
was hurt, Laßrucherie contented himself with send
ing his big men through the middle <»112 the line—he
was winning and didn't care to take foolish chances.
Ernie Case was throwing only long passes to Ship
key and Myers; the lethal short ones to Baldwin and
Kurraseh were kept in reserve. Even at that, with
the Bears knowing almost the exact spot where every
play was going, the West wood men ran up over 300
yards on the ground.
It should be an object lesson against ever going
overboard for anyone at any time, but wait and see;
it'll be the same old story again next year.

Aubrey Devine and Ainslee Bell went over to
the Trojan dressing room after the game; Aubrey
is the son of a former S.C. assistant coach, and Bell
played on Cravath's first Rose Bowl team, Jeff was
quite friendly, in spite of the fact that both boys
enrolled at the wrong (for him) school.

I mean the two long runs Lloyd .Merriman made
which were called hack. '1 he penalties were no
body s fault; just one of those things that happen.
Then there were the two occasions when Buck
Brownson decided to run on fourth down. If he'd
made it, he d be a hero. McCardle was doing the
same thing, and getting away with it. And so on.
But I'll say this—l've seen quite a few football
teams, and played on a couple myself, but this is the
one that goes down in my book as my favorite of
them all. For sheer spirit and will to win, I've never
seen their equal. They never had their daufbers down
once, although thoy were fighting against terrific
odds. Just remember that.

They were out-manned but not out-fought; out
scored but not out-spirited. I'd rather cheer for a
bunch ol fellows like that who lose than a squad of
quitters who run up big scores on weak opposition.
Madigan and Hachten played a great game at guard;
Flatland played his heart out at center. The big fel
low's replacement, Dorsey Kindler, did as well. Fieri
Boenseh played the type of ball of which I'd always
thought him capable. Charley Wakefield outplayed
the two men who were on his neck—until he was
almost too tired to stand up. The ends showed a 100
per cent improvement. The backs were magnificent.

Jeff Cravath deserves a lot of credit for the job
he's done in bringing the Trojans back into conten
tion. These Trojans had a bigger team with more
reserves, but they didn't lack for spirit either. It's
the first Trojan team I ever heard of that didn't
fold up after three touchdowns had been scored on
it. They 11 give the Bruins quite an argument next
month.
COME JOIN THE BAND
It was a great game and a great spectacle. The
40,000 people who could have come and didn't should
kick themselves. It was the sort of a colorful event
we used to see before the war. The two bands were
drilled to perfection, and the people who planned the
half-time events showed a lot of originality.
The friendly, sportsmanlike conduct of the Trojan
people was something to be remembered and emu
lated. All too often bad feeling is shown between root
ing sections, but there was nothing of that sort Sat
urday.

The Stanford band, although it also was out
manned, does not have to be ashamed. That writing
gentleman who claimed there were a lot of non-play
ing lingers should have his ears examined. In years
gone by. kids from nearby high schools were used,
but they all could play their instruments even as
Troy recruits from Hollywood High. But that is a
thing of the past for Stanford.
Let me assure (he esteemed gentleman from San
Francisco that there are no non-playing members,
and that all the handsin«i are regularly enrolled
students. They all blow lull time. I have this on
very good authority—a bandsman friend of mine,
who is the biggest wind I know.

Stanford might take a leaf from the Trojan note
book and hire a few girls to come join the band. The
Trojans had several, and they did mighty well. 1 was
especially interested in that lady who pounded the
kettledrums drawn by a team of children; she never
missed a beat. But their glockenspiel man was from
hunger.
BERKELEY BUBBLE BURSTS
The San Francisco sportswliters, always eager to
jump aboard the Berkeley bandwagon at the slightest
excuse, have had their fingers burned again. Wash
ington wasn't much, but she had too much for poor
Cal. The old Slinger told you after they beat St.
Mary's that the Gold and Blue men were all carrying
pockets full of rabbit feet.
Jack McDonald of the Call-Bulletin was the only
man among the press at the Cal-U.C.I/. A. game that
called the turn, ile pointed out that the Bruins
didn't use half their stuff against Cal; after Itossi
was hurt, Laßrucherie contented himself with send
ing his big men through the middle <»112 the line—he
was winning and didn't care to take foolish chances.
Ernie Case was throwing only long passes to Ship
key and Myers; the lethal short ones to Baldwin and
Kurraseh were kept in reserve. Even at that, with
the Bears knowing almost the exact spot where every
play was going, the West wood men ran up over 300
yards on the ground.
It should be an object lesson against ever going
overboard for anyone at any time, but wait and see;
it'll be the same old story again next year.

enrolled at the wrong (for him) school.

same thing, and getting away with it. And so on.
But I'll say this—l've seen quite a few football
teams, and played on a couple myself, but this is the
one that goes down in my book as my favorite of
them all. For sheer spirit and will to win, I've never
seen their equal. They never had their daufbers down
once, although thoy were fighting against terrific
odds. Just remember that.
* * *
They were out-manned but not out-fought; out
scored but not out-spirited. I'd rather cheer for a
bunch ol fellows like that who lose than a squad of
quitters who run up big scores on weak opposition.
Madigan and Hachten played a great game at guard;
Flatland played his heart out at center. The big fel
low's replacement, Dorsey Kindler, did as well. Fieri
Boenseh played the type of ball of which I'd always
thought him capable. Charley Wakefield outplayed
the two men who were on his neck—until he was
almost too tired to stand up. The ends showed a 100
per cent improvement. The backs were magnificent.

Jeff Cravath deserves a lot of credit for the job
he's done in bringing the Trojans back into conten
tion. These Trojans had a bigger team with more
reserves, but they didn't lack for spirit either. It's
the first Trojan team I ever heard of that didn't
fold up after three touchdowns had been scored on
it. They 11 give the Bruins quite an argument next
month.
COME JOIN THE BAND
It was a great game and a great spectacle. The
40,000 people who could have come and didn't should
kick themselves. It was the sort of a colorful event
we used to see before the war. The two bands were
drilled to perfection, and the people who planned the
half-time events showed a lot of originality.
The friendly, sportsmanlike conduct of the Trojan
people was something to be remembered and emu
lated. All too often bad feeling is shown between root
ing sections, but there was nothing of that sort Sat
urday.

The Stanford band, although it also was out
manned, does not have to be ashamed. That writing
gentleman who claimed there were a lot of non-play
ing lingers should have his ears examined. In years
gone by. kids from nearby high schools were used,
but they all could play their instruments even as
Troy recruits from Hollywood High. But that is a
thing of the past for Stanford.
Let me assure (he esteemed gentleman from San
Francisco that there are no non-playing members,
and that all the handsin«i are regularly enrolled
students. They all blow lull time. I have this on
very good authority—a bandsman friend of mine,
who is the biggest wind I know.

Stanford might take a leaf from the Trojan note
book and hire a few girls to come join the band. The
Trojans had several, and they did mighty well. 1 was
especially interested in that lady who pounded the
kettledrums drawn by a team of children; she never
missed a beat. But their glockenspiel man was from
hunger.
BERKELEY BUBBLE BURSTS
The San Francisco sportswliters, always eager to
jump aboard the Berkeley bandwagon at the slightest
excuse, have had their fingers burned again. Wash
ington wasn't much, but she had too much for poor
Cal. The old Slinger told you after they beat St.
Mary's that the Gold and Blue men were all carrying
pockets full of rabbit feet.
Jack McDonald of the Call-Bulletin was the only
man among the press at the Cal-U.C.I/. A. game that
called the turn, ile pointed out that the Bruins
didn't use half their stuff against Cal; after Itossi
was hurt, Laßrucherie contented himself with send
ing his big men through the middle <»112 the line—he
was winning and didn't care to take foolish chances.
Ernie Case was throwing only long passes to Ship
key and Myers; the lethal short ones to Baldwin and
Kurraseh were kept in reserve. Even at that, with
the Bears knowing almost the exact spot where every
play was going, the West wood men ran up over 300
yards on the ground.
It should be an object lesson against ever going
overboard for anyone at any time, but wait and see;
it'll be the same old story again next year.

Aubrey Devine and Ainslee Bell went over to
the Trojan dressing room after the game; Aubrey
is the son of a former S.C. assistant coach, and Bell
played on Cravath's first Rose Bowl team, Jeff was
quite friendly, in spite of the fact that both boys
enrolled at the wrong (for him) school.
It was a tough one to lose! damn tough, especially
after the way it started. But anyone fin the campus
who isn't proud of those boys after the battle they
put up can't be called a Stanford man. They played
their hearts out; with a little luck on their side, they'd
have turned the trick.
I mean the two long runs Lloyd .Merriman made
which were called hack. '1 he penalties were no
body s fault; just one of those things that happen.
Then there were the two occasions when Buck
Brownson decided to run on fourth down. If he'd
made it, he d be a hero. McCardle was doing the
same thing, and getting away with it. And so on.
