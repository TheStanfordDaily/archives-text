# Red Burn, Once Center of Farm, Home of Stanford Riding School
## 
### SUE ENGELHARD 
Stanford's Red Barn, 70 years ago the center of Senator Stan
ford's 1,100-acre stock farm, opened this fall as the University's
first school of riding.
The rapidly growing school with a beginning enrollment of
70 men and women, supplements the traditions of the Red Barn

with the interest in learning about
horses and the love for caring lor
them that Senator Stanford himself
had.
Back in the days when the Red
Barn was the focal point of the
world's greatest breeding and train
ing farm, a school of riding had
never been dreamed of. Instead the
site was lively with the caring for
blood horses and the scientific train
ing of trotters and thoroughbreds.
Eighty men spent their time car
ing for the horses while trainers,
harness makers, farmers, and black
smiths did their part to give the
stock farm its outstanding reputa
tion.
The horses were trained on sev
eral tracks, one a mile long. Bad
weather didn't stop the training, for
one of the paddocks was provided
with covering.
MOVIES DEVELOPED
Stanford's scientific method of
training revolutionized old prac
tices. Out of this grew an experi
ment which produced the world's
first motion pictures.
The senator doubted that the
running motion of a horse was as
graceful as the human eye perceiv
ed it. In order to prove his point he
set cameras at intervals around his
track and attached a thread to the
shutter of each camera. These
threads were extended across the
track in the path of the horse. As
the horse ran through the thread a
picture was snapped, resulting in a
quick succession of action shots.
STUDENTS LEARN
Today the same Red Barn is again
an important spot in Stanford life.
It is once more the home of horses,
though now only thirty-five head.
And it is students who are learning
today instead of horses.
The school is open from 1 to 5 ,
daily under the direction of Mr. and
Mrs. Ross for classes, private in
struction, and casual riding. Instruc
tion is given in both eastern and j
western styles and also in the gen- j
eral care of horses. It is hoped that
a ring will be built soon but until j
then the classes will take cross- j
country rides.
Registration fee for the riding 1
classes is $45.00 and a unit credit j
is given to upper division students.
Private instruction is given by Mr.
and Mrs. Ross at $4.00 per hour.
Horses for casual riding at $1.50 per
hour may be obtained by appoint
ment by calling the Red Bnrn at
2-571.'] any day between 8 and 5.


STANFORD'S BIG RED BARN stands just off the road to Sears
ville. Now surrounded by the greens of the golf course, it once was
the center of Senator Stanford's vast stock farm.
