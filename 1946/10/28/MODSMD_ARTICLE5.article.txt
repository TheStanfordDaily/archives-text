# Trojan Horde Edges Indians
## 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
Southern California's Trojans closed with a fourth-quarter
drive that wouldn't be denied, Saturday, to top the Stanford In
dians 28 to 20. It was the most thrilling and colorful gam? you or
anyone else can expect to s.ee for a long, long time—from the
spectacular pre-game band stunts until spectators poured onto
the field after the final play.
The underdog Cards, surprising everyone, had a touchdown
just six plays (and two minutes) after Veil Lillywhite's opening
kickoff over the goal. The drive was climaxed by Bob Ander
son's wide sweep around right end to pay dirt from 63 yards out.
Lloyd Merriman put on the key block. The educated toe of
Charley Wakefield made it 7 to 0, and 50,000 startled spectators
settled back into their seats.
Troy came back strong, Art Battle carrying the ball on live
out of six plays, but Dick Madigan and Bill Hachten stopped the
drive on their own 42, and Stanford took over. But Battle was
right in there to intercept a Brownson pass, and Troy had another
chance There was an exchange of punts,

and then came a break for Stanford.
Dick Flatland, who played a whale
of a game, fell on Don Garlin's fum
ble on the USC 20. Seven plays
pushed the ball across, Lloyd Merri
man bucking over from the one
after 30 seconds of play in the sec
ond quarter. Wakefield again con
verted.
Hut what had looked like a Tro
jan route suddenly hccamc a foot
hall game again. Play seesawed
hack and forth, with a had kick
by Stanford and an exchange of
fumbles. A 40-yard run by IJoyd
Merriman from punt formation
was called back because of an
illegal shift in the meantime. Af
ter receiving Wayne Erickson's
fumble on the Stanford 30. Troy
moved straight down the field for
its first TD. Johnny Naumu con
verted and the half ended with
the score Stanford 14, USC 7.
The Indians returned to the fray
with plenty of drive, and in just
three minutes had another touch
down. The climnx came when Lar
rupin' Lloyd took a screen pass
from Buck Brownson and rambled
half the length of the field to the
promised land. Taking the pass on
the line of scrimmage, he went down
the south sideline, cut back across
the field, and outran the entire Tro
jan squad. Charley Wakefield's
conversion attempt was blocked.
NEW TROJAN BACK FIELD HOT
But that was the end of the Stan
ford scoring. Stopped on the 20 in
one drive, Troy came back to make
the next one good. A so-called sec
ond string backfield of Naumu,
Mickey McCardle, Gordon Gray,
and Bobhy Musick were not to be
denied. Naumu, the slashing, driv
ing Hawaiian lad. plunged over
from the one, then kicked goal. But
Stanford still led, 20 to 14.
Boh Anderson ran Center Walt
McCormick's long kickofT back to
the Stanford 20. and three line
plays put the hall on the 20. Elect
ing to run on fourth down. Buck
Brownson fumbled for a loss of
one and Troy took over on the 2X.
Naumu went 21 yards on three
plays; then Bobby Musick fum
bled over the goal and End Doug
Essick recovered for the third
Figucroa TD. Naumu put Troy
ahead with that toe of bis. 21 to 20.
Later, after Naumu had missed a
field goal attempt. Lloyd Merriman
worked that same screen pass play
for a gain of 44 yards to the Trojan
•)(), but a clipping penalty set the
battling Indians back to their own
38. With fourth and two coming up,
Brownson again elected to try for
yardage, and Lloyd Merriman was
stopped about two inches short;
Troy took over on the Stanford 48.
IT WAS NAUMU AND MUSICK
From there, the boys from the
southland sewed up the ball game.
Naumu and Musick alternated at
pounding the tiring Stanford line,
and on the eighth play Bobby Mu
sick went over from eight yards out.
That man Naumu split the uprights
for the fourth consecutive time, and
the score was USC 28, Stanford 20.
To all intents and purposes the
game was over, hut Aubrey De-
Nine made a gallant attempt for
another score. He connected with
Bol;hy Anderson for 35 yards to
the three-yard line, but the clock
ran out before time could be call
ed. And that was that.
The Trojans made a great come
back after trailing, 20 to 7. Naumu,
Musick, and Gray would not be de
nied as they tore off large chunks of
yardage on play after play. Mickey
McCardle did a perfect job of sig
nal calling, and pulled a naked re
verse for 16 yards on fourth down at
a crucial moment.
ST ANF OKI) OUT MA NNEI >
The Stanford boys played a great,
heads-up brand of football for three
quarters to lead the highly favored
USC outfit, but they were out
weighed and outmanned. Lack of
reserves in the fourth quarter told
the tale; Jeff Cravath had plenty of
fresh men to throw in, while Mar
chie Schwartz had to try and rest
his boys one at a time.
The Card dressing room was as
quiet as a tomb after the game; it
hurt to lose when they had fought
so hard. But Marchic was proud
of his hoys, even in defeat. Stan
ford pulled out of the game in
fairly good physical shape; Bob
Anderson had a nasty gash under
his eye and Lloyd Merriman was
cut around the mouth, but both
will be ready for Oregon State.
Gene Martin received the worst

of the injuries; he got kicked in
the ankle twice in a very few min
utes, and may he lost for a couple
of weeks.
In contrast to the mausoleum
quiet Indian dressing room, hilarity
was king on the other side of the
gym. Newell (Jeff) Cravath was in
an expansive mood, with nothing
but praise for everyone and good
will toward all the world. "Lloyd
Merriman is the finest fullback I've
seen all year," he said. "And he's a
clean-cut, modest kid, too—l talked
to him after the game. I think lack
of reserve strength is what beat
Stanford."

Southern California's Trojans closed with a fourth-quarter
drive that wouldn't be denied, Saturday, to top the Stanford In
dians 28 to 20. It was the most thrilling and colorful gam? you or
anyone else can expect to s.ee for a long, long time—from the
spectacular pre-game band stunts until spectators poured onto
the field after the final play.
The underdog Cards, surprising everyone, had a touchdown
just six plays (and two minutes) after Veil Lillywhite's opening
kickoff over the goal. The drive was climaxed by Bob Ander
son's wide sweep around right end to pay dirt from 63 yards out.
Lloyd Merriman put on the key block. The educated toe of
Charley Wakefield made it 7 to 0, and 50,000 startled spectators
settled back into their seats.
Troy came back strong, Art Battle carrying the ball on live
out of six plays, but Dick Madigan and Bill Hachten stopped the
drive on their own 42, and Stanford took over. But Battle was
right in there to intercept a Brownson pass, and Troy had another
chance There was an exchange of punts,

and then came a break for Stanford.
Dick Flatland, who played a whale
of a game, fell on Don Garlin's fum

the score Stanford 14, USC 7.
The Indians returned to the fray
with plenty of drive, and in just
three minutes had another touch
down. The climnx came when Lar
rupin' Lloyd took a screen pass
from Buck Brownson and rambled
half the length of the field to the
promised land. Taking the pass on
the line of scrimmage, he went down
the south sideline, cut back across
the field, and outran the entire Tro
jan squad. Charley Wakefield's
conversion attempt was blocked.
NEW TROJAN BACK FIELD HOT
But that was the end of the Stan
ford scoring. Stopped on the 20 in
one drive, Troy came back to make
the next one good. A so-called sec

Mickey McCardle, Gordon Gray,

from the one, then kicked goal. But
Stanford still led, 20 to 14.

ran out before time could be call

hurt to lose when they had fought
so hard. But Marchic was proud

Southern California's Trojans closed with a fourth-quarter
drive that wouldn't be denied, Saturday, to top the Stanford In
dians 28 to 20. It was the most thrilling and colorful gam? you or
anyone else can expect to s.ee for a long, long time—from the
spectacular pre-game band stunts until spectators poured onto
the field after the final play.
The underdog Cards, surprising everyone, had a touchdown
just six plays (and two minutes) after Veil Lillywhite's opening
kickoff over the goal. The drive was climaxed by Bob Ander
son's wide sweep around right end to pay dirt from 63 yards out.
Lloyd Merriman put on the key block. The educated toe of
Charley Wakefield made it 7 to 0, and 50,000 startled spectators
settled back into their seats.
Troy came back strong, Art Battle carrying the ball on live
out of six plays, but Dick Madigan and Bill Hachten stopped the
drive on their own 42, and Stanford took over. But Battle was
right in there to intercept a Brownson pass, and Troy had another
chance There was an exchange of punts,

and then came a break for Stanford.
Dick Flatland, who played a whale
of a game, fell on Don Garlin's fum
ble on the USC 20. Seven plays
pushed the ball across, Lloyd Merri
man bucking over from the one
after 30 seconds of play in the sec
ond quarter. Wakefield again con
verted.
Hut what had looked like a Tro

hack and forth, with a had kick

was called back because of an
illegal shift in the meantime. Af
ter receiving Wayne Erickson's
fumble on the Stanford 30. Troy
moved straight down the field for
its first TD. Johnny Naumu con
verted and the half ended with
the score Stanford 14, USC 7.
The Indians returned to the fray
with plenty of drive, and in just
three minutes had another touch
down. The climnx came when Lar
rupin' Lloyd took a screen pass
from Buck Brownson and rambled
half the length of the field to the
promised land. Taking the pass on
the line of scrimmage, he went down
the south sideline, cut back across
the field, and outran the entire Tro
jan squad. Charley Wakefield's
conversion attempt was blocked.
NEW TROJAN BACK FIELD HOT
But that was the end of the Stan
ford scoring. Stopped on the 20 in
one drive, Troy came back to make
the next one good. A so-called sec
ond string backfield of Naumu,
Mickey McCardle, Gordon Gray,
and Bobhy Musick were not to be
denied. Naumu, the slashing, driv
ing Hawaiian lad. plunged over
from the one, then kicked goal. But
Stanford still led, 20 to 14.
Boh Anderson ran Center Walt
McCormick's long kickofT back to
the Stanford 20. and three line

Figucroa TD. Naumu put Troy

Later, after Naumu had missed a
field goal attempt. Lloyd Merriman

battling Indians back to their own

Brownson again elected to try for
yardage, and Lloyd Merriman was
stopped about two inches short;
Troy took over on the Stanford 48.
IT WAS NAUMU AND MUSICK
From there, the boys from the
southland sewed up the ball game.
Naumu and Musick alternated at
pounding the tiring Stanford line,
and on the eighth play Bobby Mu
sick went over from eight yards out.
That man Naumu split the uprights
for the fourth consecutive time, and
the score was USC 28, Stanford 20.
To all intents and purposes the
game was over, hut Aubrey De-
Nine made a gallant attempt for
another score. He connected with
Bol;hy Anderson for 35 yards to
the three-yard line, but the clock
ran out before time could be call

The Trojans made a great come
back after trailing, 20 to 7. Naumu,
Musick, and Gray would not be de
nied as they tore off large chunks of
yardage on play after play. Mickey
McCardle did a perfect job of sig

verse for 16 yards on fourth down at
a crucial moment.

Southern California's Trojans closed with a fourth-quarter
drive that wouldn't be denied, Saturday, to top the Stanford In
dians 28 to 20. It was the most thrilling and colorful gam? you or
anyone else can expect to s.ee for a long, long time—from the
spectacular pre-game band stunts until spectators poured onto
the field after the final play.
The underdog Cards, surprising everyone, had a touchdown
just six plays (and two minutes) after Veil Lillywhite's opening
kickoff over the goal. The drive was climaxed by Bob Ander
son's wide sweep around right end to pay dirt from 63 yards out.
Lloyd Merriman put on the key block. The educated toe of
Charley Wakefield made it 7 to 0, and 50,000 startled spectators
settled back into their seats.
Troy came back strong, Art Battle carrying the ball on live
out of six plays, but Dick Madigan and Bill Hachten stopped the
drive on their own 42, and Stanford took over. But Battle was
right in there to intercept a Brownson pass, and Troy had another
chance There was an exchange of punts,

and then came a break for Stanford.
Dick Flatland, who played a whale
of a game, fell on Don Garlin's fum
ble on the USC 20. Seven plays
pushed the ball across, Lloyd Merri
man bucking over from the one
after 30 seconds of play in the sec
ond quarter. Wakefield again con
verted.
Hut what had looked like a Tro
jan route suddenly hccamc a foot
hall game again. Play seesawed
hack and forth, with a had kick
by Stanford and an exchange of
fumbles. A 40-yard run by IJoyd
Merriman from punt formation
was called back because of an
illegal shift in the meantime. Af
ter receiving Wayne Erickson's
fumble on the Stanford 30. Troy
moved straight down the field for
its first TD. Johnny Naumu con
verted and the half ended with
the score Stanford 14, USC 7.
The Indians returned to the fray
with plenty of drive, and in just
three minutes had another touch
down. The climnx came when Lar
rupin' Lloyd took a screen pass
from Buck Brownson and rambled
half the length of the field to the
promised land. Taking the pass on
the line of scrimmage, he went down
the south sideline, cut back across
the field, and outran the entire Tro
jan squad. Charley Wakefield's
conversion attempt was blocked.
NEW TROJAN BACK FIELD HOT
But that was the end of the Stan
ford scoring. Stopped on the 20 in
one drive, Troy came back to make
the next one good. A so-called sec
ond string backfield of Naumu,
Mickey McCardle, Gordon Gray,
and Bobhy Musick were not to be
denied. Naumu, the slashing, driv
ing Hawaiian lad. plunged over
from the one, then kicked goal. But
Stanford still led, 20 to 14.
Boh Anderson ran Center Walt
McCormick's long kickofT back to
the Stanford 20. and three line
plays put the hall on the 20. Elect

one and Troy took over on the 2X.

plays; then Bobby Musick fum
bled over the goal and End Doug
Essick recovered for the third
Figucroa TD. Naumu put Troy
ahead with that toe of bis. 21 to 20.
Later, after Naumu had missed a
field goal attempt. Lloyd Merriman
worked that same screen pass play
for a gain of 44 yards to the Trojan
•)(), but a clipping penalty set the
battling Indians back to their own
38. With fourth and two coming up,
Brownson again elected to try for
yardage, and Lloyd Merriman was
stopped about two inches short;
Troy took over on the Stanford 48.
IT WAS NAUMU AND MUSICK
From there, the boys from the
southland sewed up the ball game.
Naumu and Musick alternated at
pounding the tiring Stanford line,
and on the eighth play Bobby Mu
sick went over from eight yards out.
That man Naumu split the uprights
for the fourth consecutive time, and
the score was USC 28, Stanford 20.
To all intents and purposes the
game was over, hut Aubrey De-
Nine made a gallant attempt for
another score. He connected with
Bol;hy Anderson for 35 yards to
the three-yard line, but the clock
ran out before time could be call
ed. And that was that.
The Trojans made a great come
back after trailing, 20 to 7. Naumu,
Musick, and Gray would not be de
nied as they tore off large chunks of
yardage on play after play. Mickey
McCardle did a perfect job of sig
nal calling, and pulled a naked re
verse for 16 yards on fourth down at
a crucial moment.
ST ANF OKI) OUT MA NNEI >
The Stanford boys played a great,
heads-up brand of football for three
quarters to lead the highly favored
USC outfit, but they were out
weighed and outmanned. Lack of
reserves in the fourth quarter told
the tale; Jeff Cravath had plenty of
fresh men to throw in, while Mar
chie Schwartz had to try and rest
his boys one at a time.
The Card dressing room was as
quiet as a tomb after the game; it
