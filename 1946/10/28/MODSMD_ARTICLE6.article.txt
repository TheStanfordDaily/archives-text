# The 						Village Experiment
## 
### 
(EDITORIAL)
We have a real job ahead of us to achieve maximum co
operation and minimum friction in a democratic way. It will be
a challenge to our unselfishness, judgment and goodwill." This
was the statement of Counselor Herbert Wunderlich, as the Vil
lage in mid-September prepared to receive some 3,000 Stanford
students and families.
In the few days before school began, men arrived at the Vil
lage, icok one look at the six miles of corridors and rows of
double bunks, and left. As a place to eat and sleep, the Village
didn't live up to what they wanted.
Today, midway in its first quarter of existence, the Village has
exhibited a spirit, a communal philosophy of civic government,
that will demand attention from the many elements on the campus
that are fumbling and grumbling about "rights," "responsibili
ties" and majority indifference.
The physical plant of the Village has been made immensely
more livable. Four-man partitioned cubicles with private desks,
and increased locker space have been arranged by the residents
themselves from the available furniture and the space left by
the many expected students who shunned Village life.
Despite the transportation difficulties and the shifting and
construction still going on, student residents have made the Vil
lage into more than a place just to eat and sleep. Their social
calendar is glutted with activities they have initiated themselves,
and the 'academic fraternities" like the law and business groups
have been able to arrange well-stocked libraries and study rooms.
Most important, they have set up with a maximum of inde
pendence the system of government which they choose to live
by. With all members voting, each house has set up its own
rules. Elected representatives from each house, sitting on a
council, examined a student-proposed constitution and are revis
ing it to fit their needs, including in it only powers which affect
the Village as a whole. On November 6, comes their first major
advance into A.S.S.U. government, and here again the distinction
is made between the influences of A.S.S.U. which apply to Vil
lage government and those that do not.
An extension of this very real experiment in self-government
can be noted in the philosophy which has been suggested by
Mr. Wunderlich and delegated to the student counselors in each
house. It is one of communal responsibility, an emphasis on
strengthening the democratic attitudes of each of the 1,300 indi
viduals who are members of the Village township.
Stated in words, the Village ideal is a hard bill of goods to
sell. It demands good sportsmanship and consideration and tol
erance, commodities easily defined but hard to apply. But the
Villagers are operating on the assumption that as long as ihey
live up to the responsibilities of government committed to them,
they will have their freedom to organize as they desire. But as
soon as one person falls down on his responsibility to his room
mate, his house, and to Stanford, his rights and those of others
at the Village are simultaneously impaired.
It's an experiment that could be well applied by every mem
ber of the Stanford student body.

pendence the system of government which they choose to live
by. With all members voting, each house has set up its own
rules. Elected representatives from each house, sitting on a
council, examined a student-proposed constitution and are revis
ing it to fit their needs, including in it only powers which affect
the Village as a whole. On November 6, comes their first major
advance into A.S.S.U. government, and here again the distinction
is made between the influences of A.S.S.U. which apply to Vil
lage government and those that do not.
An extension of this very real experiment in self-government
can be noted in the philosophy which has been suggested by
Mr. Wunderlich and delegated to the student counselors in each
house. It is one of communal responsibility, an emphasis on
strengthening the democratic attitudes of each of the 1,300 indi
viduals who are members of the Village township.
Stated in words, the Village ideal is a hard bill of goods to
sell. It demands good sportsmanship and consideration and tol
erance, commodities easily defined but hard to apply. But the
Villagers are operating on the assumption that as long as ihey
live up to the responsibilities of government committed to them,
they will have their freedom to organize as they desire. But as
soon as one person falls down on his responsibility to his room
mate, his house, and to Stanford, his rights and those of others
at the Village are simultaneously impaired.
It's an experiment that could be well applied by every mem
ber of the Stanford student body.

(EDITORIAL)
We have a real job ahead of us to achieve maximum co
operation and minimum friction in a democratic way. It will be
a challenge to our unselfishness, judgment and goodwill." This
was the statement of Counselor Herbert Wunderlich, as the Vil
lage in mid-September prepared to receive some 3,000 Stanford
students and families.
In the few days before school began, men arrived at the Vil
lage, icok one look at the six miles of corridors and rows of
double bunks, and left. As a place to eat and sleep, the Village
didn't live up to what they wanted.
Today, midway in its first quarter of existence, the Village has
exhibited a spirit, a communal philosophy of civic government,
that will demand attention from the many elements on the campus
that are fumbling and grumbling about "rights," "responsibili
ties" and majority indifference.
The physical plant of the Village has been made immensely
more livable. Four-man partitioned cubicles with private desks,
and increased locker space have been arranged by the residents
themselves from the available furniture and the space left by
the many expected students who shunned Village life.
Despite the transportation difficulties and the shifting and
construction still going on, student residents have made the Vil
lage into more than a place just to eat and sleep. Their social
calendar is glutted with activities they have initiated themselves,
and the 'academic fraternities" like the law and business groups
have been able to arrange well-stocked libraries and study rooms.
Most important, they have set up with a maximum of inde
pendence the system of government which they choose to live
by. With all members voting, each house has set up its own
rules. Elected representatives from each house, sitting on a
council, examined a student-proposed constitution and are revis
