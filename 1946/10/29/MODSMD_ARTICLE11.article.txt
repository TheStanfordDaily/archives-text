It can be done. Stanford has had
10 Rhodes scholars since 1904. Three
of its present faculty members were
also Rhodes Scholarship holders.
They are Dean Spaeth of the Daw
School, Professor Buck of the Po
litical Science Department, and
Francis Johnson, associate profes

So it's not impossible. But here's
a little tip from Professor Buck. If
vou want to be a Rhodes winner,
start directing your work to that
end from your sophomore year; and
come in and talk it over with Mr.
Buck as soon as you feel a definite

It can be done. Stanford has had
10 Rhodes scholars since 1904. Three
of its present faculty members were
also Rhodes Scholarship holders.
They are Dean Spaeth of the Daw
School, Professor Buck of the Po
litical Science Department, and
Francis Johnson, associate profes
sor of English,
So it's not impossible. But here's
a little tip from Professor Buck. If
vou want to be a Rhodes winner,
start directing your work to that
end from your sophomore year; and
come in and talk it over with Mr.
Buck as soon as you feel a definite
interest. You may not win, but you
will know better why you lost.
Would you bo interested in a
Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford Uni
versity by any chance? Well, they're
available but there arc a few little
preliminary details you will have to
take care of first. Here are the rec
ords of Stanford's five prospective
candidates to the coveted scholar
ships. After reading them, if you
still want to do what has to be done
before you can be considered, see
Professor Philip W. Duck of the
Political Science Department, chair
man of the Stanford Rhodes Schol
arship committee, who can tell you
what you want to know by virtue
of having been a Rhodes scholar
himself.

All right now. Who wants to try?
It can be done. Stanford has had
10 Rhodes scholars since 1904. Three
of its present faculty members were
also Rhodes Scholarship holders.
They are Dean Spaeth of the Daw
School, Professor Buck of the Po
litical Science Department, and
Francis Johnson, associate profes
sor of English,
So it's not impossible. But here's
a little tip from Professor Buck. If
vou want to be a Rhodes winner,
start directing your work to that
end from your sophomore year; and
come in and talk it over with Mr.
Buck as soon as you feel a definite
interest. You may not win, but you
will know better why you lost.
Would you bo interested in a
Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford Uni
versity by any chance? Well, they're
available but there arc a few little
preliminary details you will have to
take care of first. Here are the rec
ords of Stanford's five prospective
candidates to the coveted scholar
ships. After reading them, if you
still want to do what has to be done
before you can be considered, see
Professor Philip W. Duck of the
Political Science Department, chair
man of the Stanford Rhodes Schol
arship committee, who can tell you
what you want to know by virtue
of having been a Rhodes scholar
himself.
