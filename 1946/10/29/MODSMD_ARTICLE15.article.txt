'to make a clear distinction among
I the four classes in regard to ;.o
-| cial regulations. Privileges that
' may be granted will be done so on
i the assumption that, as a girl grows
j older scholastically and intellectu

j herself and to others for the intelli
| gent, use of the privileges.
If is very important that all wom
en understand the basis for any
! changes lhat may be made, and the
| fact that all changes will be on a
! trial basis.
