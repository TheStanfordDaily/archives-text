## Rally Com Revisions? 
### 
Speaking of the division of responsibility
and authority, as we so often are, we v/ant to
raise a few questions which may be answered
by Rally Committee and its Cardinal guar
dians.
Rally Committee members, individually
and often, have come to the Daily with com
plaints about their unjust treatment at the
hands of staff writers. Since complaints
against their work have not been inspired by
any an i-Rally Com sentiment, we conclude
that a sizeable part of the trouble lies in the
interior organization of the Committee, and
the unmerited veto power wielded over them
by Cardinals.
The confusion on the appointment of cheer
leaders resulted from an incoherent analysis
of the emergency situation, and from selection
of the six men without Rally Committee ap
proval as provided by the constitution. Try
outs, in the first place, should have been op
ened to all interested men, with selection by
lite entire Rally Committee, and with training
conducted by former yell leaders and appoin
tees from Rally Com until the February elec
tion.
The constitution should be revised to do
nway with the clauses affecting its efficient
operation.
At present, its constitution provides for
"class Iwo" membership, composed princi
pally of sophomores with a few freshmen,
from which only one-third of the members are

invited to stay on as juniors or "class one"
members. Isn't the hierarchy headed the
wrong way? Why continually eliminate ex
perienced members in favor of inexperienced
ones? It would be more sensible to choose
fewer freshman and sophomore members, al
lowing them to serve until graduation. More
members can be added to the junior and sen
ior groups by open tryouts each year, rather
than limiting any chance at membership to
the sophomore year. There are many trans
fers on campus now who, though anxious to
work, are eliminated by the tight constitu
tional rulings about Rally Com.
Under any arrangement, the choice of who
shall be the senior chairmen of Rally Commit
tee should be left up to Committee members,
rather than delegated to the past chairmen
and to Cardinals. Is it not probable that Rally
Com would serve better under leaders of their
own choice than under appointed ones?
Cardinals has authority, under the consti
tution, over many matters which are run ex
clusively by Rally Committee.
What is most important in any editorial
criticism is to point out the philosophy which
prompts it. We have this to say: unsatisfactory
work by any student committee will never be
condemned nor condoned by the Daily unless
we sincerely believe an improvement can be
made by so doing. So we're asking Rally Com
to accept our criticism in this light, and to ex
amine its inner workings for a better possible
way of doing things.
