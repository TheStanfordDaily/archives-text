To the Editor:
Tin re are some curious inconsistencies on page
I\v<i ol Thursday's Daily.
In Campus Opinion, Charles R. Kelley complains
of conditions in the Philippines and Korea. He in
vites discussion of changing our "imperialistic" poli
cies. The Philippines are an independent nation, with
an elected president who may or may not have been
a Quisling—at any rate, his people elected him.
Greene seems to think that the land in the Philip
pines has not been equitably distributed. He appar
ently wants us to do something about it.
In Korea we are already on hand, and doing a
bad job, he says. There may be much in what he
says, but Russia's role in Korea, and her gutting of
Far Eastern factories, conveniently goes unmention
ed. As to the suggestion that Korea is in danger of
American colonization, how silly can we get?
On Greene's presentation we seem damned if we
do and damned if we don't.
Incidentally, as a preface to the party line, Greene
takes a crack at the "great free American press." It's
perfectly true that great portions of the American
press, ranging from Hearst on the extreme right to
the Daily Worker on the extreme left, are yellow
journals—that is, they slant the news. The American
press is far from perfect—its advocacy of political
candidates through the use of news columns (in
which people have been taught to place confidence)
is particularly unfair. But in attacking our native
press, a lot of people of Mr. Greene's apparent per
suasion find it expedient not to contrast it with the
pre-digested, party-line pap which passes for news
in Russia.
George Brunn points out how wicked it was to
sell goods to Germany and Japan. He then points
out that it is wicked to REFUSE to loan goods and
money to our potential enemies of today.
Russia's idea of co-operation has been "You give
in and everything will be dandy." This attitude, and
(he Iron Curtain, has caused this nation, and many
other nations, to stiffen. Russia is the foremost ad
vocate of soverignty in the world today, as exempli
fied by the veto power matter. To quote a great
American truism, co-operation is not a one-way
.street. To toss away our weapons and help potential
enemies, would be just witless.
Lei Russia take away the veil and let her relieve

the world's suspicions—perhaps they are only hiding
dreadful poverty, but if their intentions are good,
the light shouldn't hurt them. Let's ALL disarm,
let's ALL give up sovereignty, but let's stop saying
that the American people are working for war be
cause they won't stick their collective head in the
sand. Such talk is a gratuitous insult to all of us.

To the Editor:
In partial reply to Charles R. Kelley's "Campus
Opinion" letter published Thursday, Oct. 24, I have
the following remarks:
I landed on Korea on Sept. 9, 1945, with General
Hodges' XXIV Corps from Okinawa. I found a
barely adequate organization of civilian life being
carried on with Japanese in all positions of respon
sibility from railway passenger agent through cor
poration heads and minor officials to include all
governmental positions not requiring manual labor
only. Even the lowest ranking beat-walker in the
police force was a Japanese.
The Koreans had not had any voice nor, more
important, experience in running their own affairs
for the last thirty years. That is the length of one
generation in the U.S. and probably one and a quar
ter generations in Korea.
Thus General Hodges saw fit to retain a minimum
of Japanese personnel in office until adequately
trained and capable Koreans could be found. This
meant a long and tedious system of examination and
verification of candidates for jobs from policemen to
mayor of Seoul, the capital city. Similarly, citizens
had to be found for responsible positions in industry
and in the national government.
And to make things worse, the Japanese had
flooded the country with paper money so that there
was a first-class inflation in progress. I paid 10c
apiece several times for eggs (what the heck, a man
expects to pay for luxuries).
Th e one lact in Mr. Kelley's article that tends to
disprove his statement is that he quotes an article
from the Korean Independent which is also publish
ed in Korea. The content, I assure you, has not been
restricted since the Japanese capitulated to the U.S.

pines has not been equitably distributed. He appar
ently wants us to do something about it.
In Korea we are already on hand, and doing a
bad job, he says. There may be much in what he
says, but Russia's role in Korea, and her gutting of
Far Eastern factories, conveniently goes unmention

American colonization, how silly can we get?
On Greene's presentation we seem damned if we
do and damned if we don't.
Incidentally, as a preface to the party line, Greene
takes a crack at the "great free American press." It's
perfectly true that great portions of the American
press, ranging from Hearst on the extreme right to
the Daily Worker on the extreme left, are yellow
journals—that is, they slant the news. The American
press is far from perfect—its advocacy of political
candidates through the use of news columns (in
which people have been taught to place confidence)
is particularly unfair. But in attacking our native
press, a lot of people of Mr. Greene's apparent per
suasion find it expedient not to contrast it with the
pre-digested, party-line pap which passes for news
in Russia.
George Brunn points out how wicked it was to
sell goods to Germany and Japan. He then points
out that it is wicked to REFUSE to loan goods and
money to our potential enemies of today.
Russia's idea of co-operation has been "You give
in and everything will be dandy." This attitude, and
(he Iron Curtain, has caused this nation, and many
other nations, to stiffen. Russia is the foremost ad
vocate of soverignty in the world today, as exempli
fied by the veto power matter. To quote a great
American truism, co-operation is not a one-way
.street. To toss away our weapons and help potential
enemies, would be just witless.
Lei Russia take away the veil and let her relieve

the world's suspicions—perhaps they are only hiding
dreadful poverty, but if their intentions are good,
the light shouldn't hurt them. Let's ALL disarm,
let's ALL give up sovereignty, but let's stop saying
that the American people are working for war be
cause they won't stick their collective head in the
sand. Such talk is a gratuitous insult to all of us.

To the Editor:
In partial reply to Charles R. Kelley's "Campus
Opinion" letter published Thursday, Oct. 24, I have
the following remarks:
I landed on Korea on Sept. 9, 1945, with General
Hodges' XXIV Corps from Okinawa. I found a
barely adequate organization of civilian life being
carried on with Japanese in all positions of respon
sibility from railway passenger agent through cor
poration heads and minor officials to include all
governmental positions not requiring manual labor
only. Even the lowest ranking beat-walker in the
police force was a Japanese.
The Koreans had not had any voice nor, more
important, experience in running their own affairs
for the last thirty years. That is the length of one
generation in the U.S. and probably one and a quar
ter generations in Korea.
Thus General Hodges saw fit to retain a minimum
of Japanese personnel in office until adequately
trained and capable Koreans could be found. This
meant a long and tedious system of examination and
verification of candidates for jobs from policemen to
mayor of Seoul, the capital city. Similarly, citizens
had to be found for responsible positions in industry
and in the national government.
And to make things worse, the Japanese had
flooded the country with paper money so that there
was a first-class inflation in progress. I paid 10c
apiece several times for eggs (what the heck, a man
expects to pay for luxuries).
Th e one lact in Mr. Kelley's article that tends to
disprove his statement is that he quotes an article
from the Korean Independent which is also publish
ed in Korea. The content, I assure you, has not been
restricted since the Japanese capitulated to the U.S.

On Greene's presentation we seem damned if we
do and damned if we don't.
Incidentally, as a preface to the party line, Greene
takes a crack at the "great free American press." It's
perfectly true that great portions of the American
press, ranging from Hearst on the extreme right to
the Daily Worker on the extreme left, are yellow
journals—that is, they slant the news. The American
press is far from perfect—its advocacy of political
candidates through the use of news columns (in
which people have been taught to place confidence)
is particularly unfair. But in attacking our native
press, a lot of people of Mr. Greene's apparent per
suasion find it expedient not to contrast it with the
pre-digested, party-line pap which passes for news
in Russia.
George Brunn points out how wicked it was to
sell goods to Germany and Japan. He then points
out that it is wicked to REFUSE to loan goods and
money to our potential enemies of today.
Russia's idea of co-operation has been "You give
in and everything will be dandy." This attitude, and
(he Iron Curtain, has caused this nation, and many
other nations, to stiffen. Russia is the foremost ad
vocate of soverignty in the world today, as exempli
fied by the veto power matter. To quote a great
American truism, co-operation is not a one-way
.street. To toss away our weapons and help potential
enemies, would be just witless.
Lei Russia take away the veil and let her relieve

the world's suspicions—perhaps they are only hiding
dreadful poverty, but if their intentions are good,
the light shouldn't hurt them. Let's ALL disarm,
let's ALL give up sovereignty, but let's stop saying
that the American people are working for war be
cause they won't stick their collective head in the
sand. Such talk is a gratuitous insult to all of us.

To the Editor:
In partial reply to Charles R. Kelley's "Campus
Opinion" letter published Thursday, Oct. 24, I have
the following remarks:
I landed on Korea on Sept. 9, 1945, with General
Hodges' XXIV Corps from Okinawa. I found a
barely adequate organization of civilian life being
carried on with Japanese in all positions of respon
sibility from railway passenger agent through cor
poration heads and minor officials to include all
governmental positions not requiring manual labor
only. Even the lowest ranking beat-walker in the
police force was a Japanese.
The Koreans had not had any voice nor, more
important, experience in running their own affairs
for the last thirty years. That is the length of one
generation in the U.S. and probably one and a quar
ter generations in Korea.
Thus General Hodges saw fit to retain a minimum
of Japanese personnel in office until adequately
trained and capable Koreans could be found. This
meant a long and tedious system of examination and
verification of candidates for jobs from policemen to
mayor of Seoul, the capital city. Similarly, citizens
had to be found for responsible positions in industry
and in the national government.
And to make things worse, the Japanese had
flooded the country with paper money so that there
was a first-class inflation in progress. I paid 10c
apiece several times for eggs (what the heck, a man
expects to pay for luxuries).
Th e one lact in Mr. Kelley's article that tends to
disprove his statement is that he quotes an article
from the Korean Independent which is also publish
ed in Korea. The content, I assure you, has not been
restricted since the Japanese capitulated to the U.S.

To the Editor:
Tin re are some curious inconsistencies on page
I\v<i ol Thursday's Daily.
In Campus Opinion, Charles R. Kelley complains
of conditions in the Philippines and Korea. He in
vites discussion of changing our "imperialistic" poli
cies. The Philippines are an independent nation, with
an elected president who may or may not have been
a Quisling—at any rate, his people elected him.
Greene seems to think that the land in the Philip
pines has not been equitably distributed. He appar
ently wants us to do something about it.
In Korea we are already on hand, and doing a
bad job, he says. There may be much in what he
says, but Russia's role in Korea, and her gutting of
Far Eastern factories, conveniently goes unmention
ed. As to the suggestion that Korea is in danger of
American colonization, how silly can we get?
On Greene's presentation we seem damned if we
do and damned if we don't.
Incidentally, as a preface to the party line, Greene
