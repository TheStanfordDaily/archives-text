Digging on down into the pile, I find a poem
which goes thusly:
Wo run around in Cadillacs and wire our dads for
money.
We find that life is sweet and made of milk and rum
and honey.
There isn't much that bothers us—we're here for
fun, that's all. ,
We ve found it takes a few good brews to keep us
on the ball.
Foi guys that study every ni«ht and comb the libes
for knowledge,

You'd better go and Took 'em up in any other college.
We excavate the schedules for a course that's not so
tough,
And know an afternoon per week is studying enough, j
Our teachers understand and know we aren't very j
bright.
They let us roam the highway circuit nearly every
night.
And so we live contented in a rosy atmosphere.
We learn to hold our liquor and ehug-a-lug our beer.
Our dates we end at drive-ins, where we wallow, il
is true;
And that is how we spend our time at dear old Stan
ford U.
—Iris Klorer
Next I find a note that says that in the second
race at Bay Meadows—oops, wrong file. Ah, here
we are. A note from one of the Village lads who :
hails from the fair state of New York. He came to
California to hibernate for the winter after reading
the ads and he's a little bitter about the cold weather
that hit the campus Sunday night.
After complaining that the clothes he washed
and hung out to dry were frozen solid, he concludes:
. . The clothes were not the only sufferers to
this freezing weather. I looked up and saw that the
trees were rubbing their palms together. There was
a shortage of milk for chow and I discovered the
reason. They had to milk the herd with ice picks.
It must have udderly ruined the cows. . .
If he thinks it's cold now, he should have been
here the winter it got so cold that even the Stanford
women seemed warm in comparison.
Well, I gotta study for a midterm. See yn in the \
libe.

Digging on down into the pile, I find a poem
which goes thusly:
Wo run around in Cadillacs and wire our dads for
money.
We find that life is sweet and made of milk and rum
and honey.
There isn't much that bothers us—we're here for
fun, that's all. ,
We ve found it takes a few good brews to keep us
on the ball.
Foi guys that study every ni«ht and comb the libes
for knowledge,

You'd better go and Took 'em up in any other college.
We excavate the schedules for a course that's not so
tough,
And know an afternoon per week is studying enough, j
Our teachers understand and know we aren't very j
bright.
They let us roam the highway circuit nearly every
night.
And so we live contented in a rosy atmosphere.
We learn to hold our liquor and ehug-a-lug our beer.
Our dates we end at drive-ins, where we wallow, il
is true;
And that is how we spend our time at dear old Stan
ford U.
—Iris Klorer
Next I find a note that says that in the second
race at Bay Meadows—oops, wrong file. Ah, here
we are. A note from one of the Village lads who :
hails from the fair state of New York. He came to
California to hibernate for the winter after reading
the ads and he's a little bitter about the cold weather
that hit the campus Sunday night.
After complaining that the clothes he washed
and hung out to dry were frozen solid, he concludes:
. . The clothes were not the only sufferers to
this freezing weather. I looked up and saw that the
trees were rubbing their palms together. There was
a shortage of milk for chow and I discovered the
reason. They had to milk the herd with ice picks.
It must have udderly ruined the cows. . .
If he thinks it's cold now, he should have been
here the winter it got so cold that even the Stanford
women seemed warm in comparison.
Well, I gotta study for a midterm. See yn in the \
libe.
Lots of odds unci ends today to clear away the
P.rut t hut's' been cluttering up the desk over the
w»'i kend. Getting so I can't find my bottle of ginger
«'de and I hale drinking the stuff straight. Coke,
llint is.

which was sent in to the Daily's biz staff for publi
