# THE 						STANFORD STORY
## 'Plug-Ugly' Brawls Deepen Class Feuds 
### 
(Continued from Monday)

In 1905 and '0(i the juniors began
to put up posters on the Quad ex
tolling their show. The seniors re
taliated at the 190G "Plug-Ugly" by
throwing firecrackers on the stage.
On attempting to rush the stage, they
were thrown back into the audience
by the infuriated juniors.
The seniors retreated to the
Quad and roped the entrances,
hut the junior hordes leaped the
barriers. A fine time was had by
all on the Quad and up to the
Post Office steps. From this year
(in the juniors' show assumed sec
ond plate to the "nice clean fun
«1" healthy boys," as one admirer
termed the fights.
In 1907 Ihe fight went indoors to
the assembly hall, due to poor
weather. One man was unconscious
for several hours. In 1908 the sen
iors kidnapped seven of the "Plug-
Ugly's" cast, and some others were
canned from school for risque lines
in the script. That year the Daily
reports that the battle did not reach
serious proportions "because of the
abundance of dust."
In 1909 the juniors put on their
show on the ball diamond, where a
screen stretched over the stage
proved unable to hold back the
seniors' offerings. In the post-show
fight a character named Peck suf
fered a broken back.
By 1910 the saner spirits had
stepped in. A student committee
applied the rules that there were to
be no fights over the junior posters

I for the show, no kidnapping of per
formers, and no disrupting of the
show itself.
The idea was to prevent the
massed rushes which had broken so
i mriny bones. Hat smashing was de-
I creed to be "as far as you should
go." The authorities were criticized
for the resulting "poor show."
In 1911 a running light 011 the
Quad sent Peck hack to the hos
pital. In 1!)12 a student advisory
hoard censored the script and the
i faculty objected to "indecent"
posters, both developments being
sidelights to a whale of a battle
011 the Quad.
In 1£ 13 the saner minds moved
the fight to the football field, but the
I campus as a whole was beginning
to doubt the wisdom of the mass
i fighting which had begun to be less
j fun and more murder.
By 1915, for reasons an observer
reported as "profane language, too
much alcoholic indulgence, and too
J many injuries," the students them
; selves voted the "Plug-Ugly" into
limbo —show, posters, carnage, and
| all.
Stanford was over its growing
! pains.

reports that the battle did not reach
serious proportions "because of the
abundance of dust."
