Today's piece .will be about football teams and football players. (When
the current grid season is over, I'm afraid Miss MacV. will have to find
someone else to blow the whistle on the sports page. I'm going back into
hibernation until Sept. '47.)
For those of you who don't patronize the pay-your-niekel-and-take
your-choice-papers, the Dippy will now present a short resume of what's
going on in the football world beyond the confines of the local game
preserve.
Before the season started, Stanford's Head Coach Marcliie Schwartz
told the legmen from The City that this was going to he a sad season for
alumni; and that every team could count on being knocked over at least
once, mebbe twice.
The statement seems to be slightly prophetic. In this whole wide sun
drenched land, there are but six football teams of Class A calibre that
have not taken it on the chin at least once.
Of these six, only one (UCLA) is on this side of the slope, and only
one (Notre Dame) is located in that stronghold of gridiron fame between
the Appalachian and Rocky ranges. What has usually been referred to as
the weak sister (circa 1940, et al) of football (the East) comes up with a
whopping three in Army, Penn and Harvard. Georgia is the Souths lone
entry.
The biggest crash was in the South, where Tennessee and North Caro
lina State fell with a resounding thud, and also in the Southwest, where
mighty Texas took the count last Saturday.
In case you didn't realize it. those three were genuine upsets as far
as the boys in the backroom were concerned. Texas was a l.'l-point fa
vorite over Rice; Tennessee was quoted at 14 1-2 points over Wake For
est; and North Carolina State was pegged at 26 points better than Vir
ginia Tech.
( Opposition (letting Tougher
There seems to be a pretty good chance for somebody else waking up
.some Sunday morning with a besmirched escutcheon, inasmuch as some
of these six teams have been living on borrowed time. Take Harvard, for
instance; the Crimson has used up enough luck this season to take care of
the whole Ivy League for a decade. Princeton lost to the Johnnies by o.ne
point, 13-12, and just last week beat a better than average Holy Cross
club by 13-6. The boys from the banks of the broad "A" tangle with
Rutgers this Saturday, and who knows?
It is likewise with the West's only unsullied record (of course, Ore
gon has a slight grey spot on its shield from its 0-0 masterpiece of fu
tility with Washington State). And the Bruins are playing just the team
that can knock them off their pedestal. Don't forget, this is (he same
St. Mary's club that UCLA rose up and hurled back just prior to the
close of last year. And Wedemeyer never forgets. And even if the
Uclans get past the Gaels, there's always Oregon at Portland (and il it
rains . . . ) the next week and Southern Cal on Big Game week.
Georgia is another one that will have its work cut out for itself this
week-end, when the Southerners tangle with Alabama and Harry Gilmer.
Tis true, Tennessee dunked the Crimson Tide, but it does not look beyond
the realm of possibility considering what Wake Forest did to the Vols.
Of the others, Army, Penn and Notre Dame will have what amounts to
another week of grace; Army tangling with a mediocre West Virginia
squad, Penn with an inept Princeton squad, and Notre Dame with the
green Navy. But next week, heads will roll as the Irish and the Cadets
mingle at Yankee Stadium.
That one has been billed as the "game of the century" ever since
Jan. 2, and it looks like for once the hilling will fulfill its claims. When
Davis, Blanchard and Co. collide with Lujack, Inc., the ensuing clang
should be about the biggest noise since V-.l Day.
The winner of that one should be the so-called national champion, even
if they do get knocked off later in the year, Army by Penn or Notre Dame
by USC. If that happened, and there were no undefeated teams left in
the nation, everyone will be able to say it was a good season. Sure, every
body lost, but then so did everyone win. Aw. hell, you just can't please
some people.
"I > assless Wonders* Twice as Good
We now come to the football players, and they're all Stanford men,
bless 'em. Art Levinson, former Daily Sports Editor and now custodian
of Yards Gained and Yards Lost (net and gross) for the locals, dropped in
to deposit a copy of the Cards yardage chart for this season. A pretty
impressive document it is, too.
In five games, the Indians (currently reported as the passless won
ders) have thrown 86 forwards, of which 29 have been completed. The
opposition has pitched 56 and 30 of those found their mark. The joker
comes in here: Stanford's passing yardage is 649 yards as compared with
the opponents .'127. Not bad for a bunch of passless wonders, racking up
twice as many yards as some of the good passing teams they've played.
However, it is on the ground that the Cards have been most impressive
this season, as they should be what with 1,263 yards in their favor as
against the 785 the other sides have run up. And that total is for five
games, too. ,
In all other aspects, the Indians seem to be just like any other team,
they've intercepted eight passes and had seven of theirs taken away;
they've punted 22 times for a 38.86 average while the opposition has booted
28 for a 38.32 average; they've rung up 62 first downs, 50 on foot, to 50
of which 40 were on the ground; they've fumbled 21 times and lost 10 of
'em, while the other side has dropped the ball 24 times and regained it
only nine; and they have been penalizd 25 times for a total of 245 yards
to 21 times for 227 yards. They've also scored 21 touchdowns and 11 con
versions for a total of 137 points while the rivals tallied 13 TD's and booted
nine for 87 points.

Well, now, that's not too bad, considering they've won three and lost
two. At least they haven't racked up any grand totals like plus one from
scrum like Berkeley did Saturday at Seattle.
But the individual yardstick is our pride and joy, for it is here that
you can see how good our boys are. And there's some very good boys there.
Take Lloyd Merriman. In five games he has lugged the ball all of 94
times. Thats a lot of times to leave yourself wide open for some pretty
vicious tackling. In those !)4 tries he's lost all of 35 yards: he's also
gained 533 yards (not counting the number of passes he's carried a long
long way) for a net total of 498. Bis average is 5.19 per play. If there's
a better man in nylon knickers let him come forward now and speak.
Our candidate for any honors the football world has to offer is hereby
presented for inspection.
But don't get me wrong; there's some other pretty good ball players on
the team. Wayne Erickson has the best average to date, 9.6 for 8 tries,
and Bob Anderson has a 9.5 average for 34 plays. His total is 315 minus
7 for a net of 308. which is good in anybody's league. Then there's George
Quist—until he got hurt last week—who carried 25 times and made 100
yards even for a tally of 4.
The rest of the backfield stats has Fred Sanderman with 5 for 36, Jack
Crahan with 5 for 35, Marty Anderson with 10 for 43. Don Zappetini with
12 for 46, Mickey Titus with 18 for 77, Gene Martin with 14 for 53, Aub
Devine with 8 for 23 and Fred Parsons with 7 for 12. Two of the quarter-

books; Brownson carrying seven for i
a plus five and a minus 31 or minus
3.7, and Forbes with 1 for minus 12.
Yessir, I'd say that was a pretty
fair combination of backs, and any- j
body that wants to challenge that
statement is hereby invited to share |
my seat on Jan. 2 when Barney Gu
yel will consume one dozen choco
late-covered cucumbers atop the j
Hoover Libe.

Well, now, that's not too bad, considering they've won three and lost
two. At least they haven't racked up any grand totals like plus one from
scrum like Berkeley did Saturday at Seattle.
But the individual yardstick is our pride and joy, for it is here that
you can see how good our boys are. And there's some very good boys there.
Take Lloyd Merriman. In five games he has lugged the ball all of 94
times. Thats a lot of times to leave yourself wide open for some pretty
vicious tackling. In those !)4 tries he's lost all of 35 yards: he's also
gained 533 yards (not counting the number of passes he's carried a long
long way) for a net total of 498. Bis average is 5.19 per play. If there's
a better man in nylon knickers let him come forward now and speak.
Our candidate for any honors the football world has to offer is hereby
presented for inspection.
But don't get me wrong; there's some other pretty good ball players on
the team. Wayne Erickson has the best average to date, 9.6 for 8 tries,
and Bob Anderson has a 9.5 average for 34 plays. His total is 315 minus
7 for a net of 308. which is good in anybody's league. Then there's George
Quist—until he got hurt last week—who carried 25 times and made 100
yards even for a tally of 4.
The rest of the backfield stats has Fred Sanderman with 5 for 36, Jack
Crahan with 5 for 35, Marty Anderson with 10 for 43. Don Zappetini with
12 for 46, Mickey Titus with 18 for 77, Gene Martin with 14 for 53, Aub
Devine with 8 for 23 and Fred Parsons with 7 for 12. Two of the quarter-

books; Brownson carrying seven for i
a plus five and a minus 31 or minus
3.7, and Forbes with 1 for minus 12.
Yessir, I'd say that was a pretty
fair combination of backs, and any- j
body that wants to challenge that
statement is hereby invited to share |
my seat on Jan. 2 when Barney Gu

Today's piece .will be about football teams and football players. (When
the current grid season is over, I'm afraid Miss MacV. will have to find
someone else to blow the whistle on the sports page. I'm going back into

For those of you who don't patronize the pay-your-niekel-and-take
your-choice-papers, the Dippy will now present a short resume of what's
going on in the football world beyond the confines of the local game
preserve.
Before the season started, Stanford's Head Coach Marcliie Schwartz
told the legmen from The City that this was going to he a sad season for
alumni; and that every team could count on being knocked over at least
once, mebbe twice.
The statement seems to be slightly prophetic. In this whole wide sun
drenched land, there are but six football teams of Class A calibre that
have not taken it on the chin at least once.
Of these six, only one (UCLA) is on this side of the slope, and only
one (Notre Dame) is located in that stronghold of gridiron fame between
the Appalachian and Rocky ranges. What has usually been referred to as
the weak sister (circa 1940, et al) of football (the East) comes up with a
whopping three in Army, Penn and Harvard. Georgia is the Souths lone
entry.
The biggest crash was in the South, where Tennessee and North Caro
lina State fell with a resounding thud, and also in the Southwest, where
mighty Texas took the count last Saturday.
In case you didn't realize it. those three were genuine upsets as far
as the boys in the backroom were concerned. Texas was a l.'l-point fa
vorite over Rice; Tennessee was quoted at 14 1-2 points over Wake For
est; and North Carolina State was pegged at 26 points better than Vir
ginia Tech.
( Opposition (letting Tougher
There seems to be a pretty good chance for somebody else waking up
.some Sunday morning with a besmirched escutcheon, inasmuch as some
of these six teams have been living on borrowed time. Take Harvard, for
instance; the Crimson has used up enough luck this season to take care of
the whole Ivy League for a decade. Princeton lost to the Johnnies by o.ne
point, 13-12, and just last week beat a better than average Holy Cross
club by 13-6. The boys from the banks of the broad "A" tangle with
Rutgers this Saturday, and who knows?
It is likewise with the West's only unsullied record (of course, Ore
gon has a slight grey spot on its shield from its 0-0 masterpiece of fu
tility with Washington State). And the Bruins are playing just the team
that can knock them off their pedestal. Don't forget, this is (he same
St. Mary's club that UCLA rose up and hurled back just prior to the
close of last year. And Wedemeyer never forgets. And even if the
Uclans get past the Gaels, there's always Oregon at Portland (and il it
rains . . . ) the next week and Southern Cal on Big Game week.
Georgia is another one that will have its work cut out for itself this
week-end, when the Southerners tangle with Alabama and Harry Gilmer.
Tis true, Tennessee dunked the Crimson Tide, but it does not look beyond
the realm of possibility considering what Wake Forest did to the Vols.
Of the others, Army, Penn and Notre Dame will have what amounts to
another week of grace; Army tangling with a mediocre West Virginia
squad, Penn with an inept Princeton squad, and Notre Dame with the
green Navy. But next week, heads will roll as the Irish and the Cadets
mingle at Yankee Stadium.
That one has been billed as the "game of the century" ever since
Jan. 2, and it looks like for once the hilling will fulfill its claims. When
Davis, Blanchard and Co. collide with Lujack, Inc., the ensuing clang
should be about the biggest noise since V-.l Day.
The winner of that one should be the so-called national champion, even
if they do get knocked off later in the year, Army by Penn or Notre Dame
by USC. If that happened, and there were no undefeated teams left in
the nation, everyone will be able to say it was a good season. Sure, every
body lost, but then so did everyone win. Aw. hell, you just can't please
some people.
"I > assless Wonders* Twice as Good
We now come to the football players, and they're all Stanford men,
bless 'em. Art Levinson, former Daily Sports Editor and now custodian
of Yards Gained and Yards Lost (net and gross) for the locals, dropped in
to deposit a copy of the Cards yardage chart for this season. A pretty
impressive document it is, too.
In five games, the Indians (currently reported as the passless won
ders) have thrown 86 forwards, of which 29 have been completed. The
opposition has pitched 56 and 30 of those found their mark. The joker
comes in here: Stanford's passing yardage is 649 yards as compared with
the opponents .'127. Not bad for a bunch of passless wonders, racking up
twice as many yards as some of the good passing teams they've played.
However, it is on the ground that the Cards have been most impressive
this season, as they should be what with 1,263 yards in their favor as
against the 785 the other sides have run up. And that total is for five
games, too. ,
In all other aspects, the Indians seem to be just like any other team,
they've intercepted eight passes and had seven of theirs taken away;
they've punted 22 times for a 38.86 average while the opposition has booted
28 for a 38.32 average; they've rung up 62 first downs, 50 on foot, to 50
of which 40 were on the ground; they've fumbled 21 times and lost 10 of
'em, while the other side has dropped the ball 24 times and regained it
only nine; and they have been penalizd 25 times for a total of 245 yards
to 21 times for 227 yards. They've also scored 21 touchdowns and 11 con
versions for a total of 137 points while the rivals tallied 13 TD's and booted
nine for 87 points.

"I > assless Wonders* Twice as Good
We now come to the football players, and they're all Stanford men,
bless 'em. Art Levinson, former Daily Sports Editor and now custodian
of Yards Gained and Yards Lost (net and gross) for the locals, dropped in
to deposit a copy of the Cards yardage chart for this season. A pretty
impressive document it is, too.
In five games, the Indians (currently reported as the passless won
ders) have thrown 86 forwards, of which 29 have been completed. The
opposition has pitched 56 and 30 of those found their mark. The joker
comes in here: Stanford's passing yardage is 649 yards as compared with
the opponents .'127. Not bad for a bunch of passless wonders, racking up
twice as many yards as some of the good passing teams they've played.
However, it is on the ground that the Cards have been most impressive
this season, as they should be what with 1,263 yards in their favor as
against the 785 the other sides have run up. And that total is for five
games, too. ,
In all other aspects, the Indians seem to be just like any other team,
they've intercepted eight passes and had seven of theirs taken away;
they've punted 22 times for a 38.86 average while the opposition has booted
28 for a 38.32 average; they've rung up 62 first downs, 50 on foot, to 50
of which 40 were on the ground; they've fumbled 21 times and lost 10 of
'em, while the other side has dropped the ball 24 times and regained it
only nine; and they have been penalizd 25 times for a total of 245 yards
to 21 times for 227 yards. They've also scored 21 touchdowns and 11 con
versions for a total of 137 points while the rivals tallied 13 TD's and booted
nine for 87 points.
Indian Harks Show High Averages
Well, now, that's not too bad, considering they've won three and lost
two. At least they haven't racked up any grand totals like plus one from
scrum like Berkeley did Saturday at Seattle.
But the individual yardstick is our pride and joy, for it is here that
you can see how good our boys are. And there's some very good boys there.
Take Lloyd Merriman. In five games he has lugged the ball all of 94
times. Thats a lot of times to leave yourself wide open for some pretty
vicious tackling. In those !)4 tries he's lost all of 35 yards: he's also
gained 533 yards (not counting the number of passes he's carried a long
long way) for a net total of 498. Bis average is 5.19 per play. If there's
a better man in nylon knickers let him come forward now and speak.
Our candidate for any honors the football world has to offer is hereby
presented for inspection.
But don't get me wrong; there's some other pretty good ball players on
the team. Wayne Erickson has the best average to date, 9.6 for 8 tries,
and Bob Anderson has a 9.5 average for 34 plays. His total is 315 minus
7 for a net of 308. which is good in anybody's league. Then there's George
Quist—until he got hurt last week—who carried 25 times and made 100
yards even for a tally of 4.
The rest of the backfield stats has Fred Sanderman with 5 for 36, Jack
Crahan with 5 for 35, Marty Anderson with 10 for 43. Don Zappetini with
12 for 46, Mickey Titus with 18 for 77, Gene Martin with 14 for 53, Aub
Devine with 8 for 23 and Fred Parsons with 7 for 12. Two of the quarter-

books; Brownson carrying seven for i
a plus five and a minus 31 or minus
3.7, and Forbes with 1 for minus 12.
Yessir, I'd say that was a pretty
fair combination of backs, and any- j
body that wants to challenge that
statement is hereby invited to share |
my seat on Jan. 2 when Barney Gu

the current grid season is over, I'm afraid Miss MacV. will have to find
someone else to blow the whistle on the sports page. I'm going back into

For those of you who don't patronize the pay-your-niekel-and-take
your-choice-papers, the Dippy will now present a short resume of what's
going on in the football world beyond the confines of the local game
preserve.
Before the season started, Stanford's Head Coach Marcliie Schwartz
told the legmen from The City that this was going to he a sad season for
alumni; and that every team could count on being knocked over at least
once, mebbe twice.
The statement seems to be slightly prophetic. In this whole wide sun
drenched land, there are but six football teams of Class A calibre that
have not taken it on the chin at least once.
Of these six, only one (UCLA) is on this side of the slope, and only
one (Notre Dame) is located in that stronghold of gridiron fame between
the Appalachian and Rocky ranges. What has usually been referred to as
the weak sister (circa 1940, et al) of football (the East) comes up with a
whopping three in Army, Penn and Harvard. Georgia is the Souths lone
entry.
The biggest crash was in the South, where Tennessee and North Caro
lina State fell with a resounding thud, and also in the Southwest, where
mighty Texas took the count last Saturday.
In case you didn't realize it. those three were genuine upsets as far
as the boys in the backroom were concerned. Texas was a l.'l-point fa
vorite over Rice; Tennessee was quoted at 14 1-2 points over Wake For
est; and North Carolina State was pegged at 26 points better than Vir
ginia Tech.
( Opposition (letting Tougher
There seems to be a pretty good chance for somebody else waking up
.some Sunday morning with a besmirched escutcheon, inasmuch as some
of these six teams have been living on borrowed time. Take Harvard, for
instance; the Crimson has used up enough luck this season to take care of
the whole Ivy League for a decade. Princeton lost to the Johnnies by o.ne
point, 13-12, and just last week beat a better than average Holy Cross
club by 13-6. The boys from the banks of the broad "A" tangle with
Rutgers this Saturday, and who knows?
It is likewise with the West's only unsullied record (of course, Ore
gon has a slight grey spot on its shield from its 0-0 masterpiece of fu
tility with Washington State). And the Bruins are playing just the team
that can knock them off their pedestal. Don't forget, this is (he same
St. Mary's club that UCLA rose up and hurled back just prior to the
close of last year. And Wedemeyer never forgets. And even if the
Uclans get past the Gaels, there's always Oregon at Portland (and il it
rains . . . ) the next week and Southern Cal on Big Game week.
Georgia is another one that will have its work cut out for itself this
week-end, when the Southerners tangle with Alabama and Harry Gilmer.
Tis true, Tennessee dunked the Crimson Tide, but it does not look beyond
the realm of possibility considering what Wake Forest did to the Vols.
Of the others, Army, Penn and Notre Dame will have what amounts to
another week of grace; Army tangling with a mediocre West Virginia
squad, Penn with an inept Princeton squad, and Notre Dame with the
green Navy. But next week, heads will roll as the Irish and the Cadets
mingle at Yankee Stadium.
That one has been billed as the "game of the century" ever since
Jan. 2, and it looks like for once the hilling will fulfill its claims. When
Davis, Blanchard and Co. collide with Lujack, Inc., the ensuing clang
should be about the biggest noise since V-.l Day.
The winner of that one should be the so-called national champion, even
if they do get knocked off later in the year, Army by Penn or Notre Dame

There seems to be a pretty good chance for somebody else waking up
.some Sunday morning with a besmirched escutcheon, inasmuch as some
of these six teams have been living on borrowed time. Take Harvard, for
instance; the Crimson has used up enough luck this season to take care of
the whole Ivy League for a decade. Princeton lost to the Johnnies by o.ne
point, 13-12, and just last week beat a better than average Holy Cross
club by 13-6. The boys from the banks of the broad "A" tangle with
Rutgers this Saturday, and who knows?
It is likewise with the West's only unsullied record (of course, Ore

St. Mary's club that UCLA rose up and hurled back just prior to the
close of last year. And Wedemeyer never forgets. And even if the
Uclans get past the Gaels, there's always Oregon at Portland (and il it
rains . . . ) the next week and Southern Cal on Big Game week.
Georgia is another one that will have its work cut out for itself this
week-end, when the Southerners tangle with Alabama and Harry Gilmer.
Tis true, Tennessee dunked the Crimson Tide, but it does not look beyond
the realm of possibility considering what Wake Forest did to the Vols.
Of the others, Army, Penn and Notre Dame will have what amounts to
another week of grace; Army tangling with a mediocre West Virginia

That one has been billed as the "game of the century" ever since

Davis, Blanchard and Co. collide with Lujack, Inc., the ensuing clang

"I > assless Wonders* Twice as Good
We now come to the football players, and they're all Stanford men,
bless 'em. Art Levinson, former Daily Sports Editor and now custodian
of Yards Gained and Yards Lost (net and gross) for the locals, dropped in
to deposit a copy of the Cards yardage chart for this season. A pretty
impressive document it is, too.
In five games, the Indians (currently reported as the passless won
ders) have thrown 86 forwards, of which 29 have been completed. The
opposition has pitched 56 and 30 of those found their mark. The joker
comes in here: Stanford's passing yardage is 649 yards as compared with
the opponents .'127. Not bad for a bunch of passless wonders, racking up
twice as many yards as some of the good passing teams they've played.
However, it is on the ground that the Cards have been most impressive
this season, as they should be what with 1,263 yards in their favor as
against the 785 the other sides have run up. And that total is for five
games, too. ,
In all other aspects, the Indians seem to be just like any other team,
they've intercepted eight passes and had seven of theirs taken away;
they've punted 22 times for a 38.86 average while the opposition has booted
28 for a 38.32 average; they've rung up 62 first downs, 50 on foot, to 50
of which 40 were on the ground; they've fumbled 21 times and lost 10 of
'em, while the other side has dropped the ball 24 times and regained it
only nine; and they have been penalizd 25 times for a total of 245 yards
to 21 times for 227 yards. They've also scored 21 touchdowns and 11 con
versions for a total of 137 points while the rivals tallied 13 TD's and booted
nine for 87 points.

Well, now, that's not too bad, considering they've won three and lost
two. At least they haven't racked up any grand totals like plus one from
scrum like Berkeley did Saturday at Seattle.
But the individual yardstick is our pride and joy, for it is here that
you can see how good our boys are. And there's some very good boys there.
Take Lloyd Merriman. In five games he has lugged the ball all of 94
times. Thats a lot of times to leave yourself wide open for some pretty
vicious tackling. In those !)4 tries he's lost all of 35 yards: he's also
gained 533 yards (not counting the number of passes he's carried a long
long way) for a net total of 498. Bis average is 5.19 per play. If there's
a better man in nylon knickers let him come forward now and speak.
Our candidate for any honors the football world has to offer is hereby
presented for inspection.
But don't get me wrong; there's some other pretty good ball players on
the team. Wayne Erickson has the best average to date, 9.6 for 8 tries,
and Bob Anderson has a 9.5 average for 34 plays. His total is 315 minus
7 for a net of 308. which is good in anybody's league. Then there's George
Quist—until he got hurt last week—who carried 25 times and made 100
yards even for a tally of 4.
The rest of the backfield stats has Fred Sanderman with 5 for 36, Jack
Crahan with 5 for 35, Marty Anderson with 10 for 43. Don Zappetini with
12 for 46, Mickey Titus with 18 for 77, Gene Martin with 14 for 53, Aub
Devine with 8 for 23 and Fred Parsons with 7 for 12. Two of the quarter-

books; Brownson carrying seven for i
a plus five and a minus 31 or minus
3.7, and Forbes with 1 for minus 12.
Yessir, I'd say that was a pretty
fair combination of backs, and any- j

For those of you who don't patronize the pay-your-niekel-and-take

going on in the football world beyond the confines of the local game
preserve.
Before the season started, Stanford's Head Coach Marcliie Schwartz
told the legmen from The City that this was going to he a sad season for
alumni; and that every team could count on being knocked over at least
once, mebbe twice.
The statement seems to be slightly prophetic. In this whole wide sun
drenched land, there are but six football teams of Class A calibre that
have not taken it on the chin at least once.
Of these six, only one (UCLA) is on this side of the slope, and only
one (Notre Dame) is located in that stronghold of gridiron fame between
the Appalachian and Rocky ranges. What has usually been referred to as
the weak sister (circa 1940, et al) of football (the East) comes up with a
whopping three in Army, Penn and Harvard. Georgia is the Souths lone
entry.
The biggest crash was in the South, where Tennessee and North Caro
lina State fell with a resounding thud, and also in the Southwest, where
mighty Texas took the count last Saturday.
In case you didn't realize it. those three were genuine upsets as far

Yessir, I'd say that was a pretty

Today's piece .will be about football teams and football players. (When
the current grid season is over, I'm afraid Miss MacV. will have to find
someone else to blow the whistle on the sports page. I'm going back into
hibernation until Sept. '47.)
For those of you who don't patronize the pay-your-niekel-and-take
your-choice-papers, the Dippy will now present a short resume of what's
going on in the football world beyond the confines of the local game
preserve.
Before the season started, Stanford's Head Coach Marcliie Schwartz
told the legmen from The City that this was going to he a sad season for
alumni; and that every team could count on being knocked over at least
once, mebbe twice.
The statement seems to be slightly prophetic. In this whole wide sun
drenched land, there are but six football teams of Class A calibre that
have not taken it on the chin at least once.
Of these six, only one (UCLA) is on this side of the slope, and only
one (Notre Dame) is located in that stronghold of gridiron fame between
the Appalachian and Rocky ranges. What has usually been referred to as
the weak sister (circa 1940, et al) of football (the East) comes up with a
whopping three in Army, Penn and Harvard. Georgia is the Souths lone
entry.
The biggest crash was in the South, where Tennessee and North Caro
lina State fell with a resounding thud, and also in the Southwest, where
mighty Texas took the count last Saturday.
In case you didn't realize it. those three were genuine upsets as far
as the boys in the backroom were concerned. Texas was a l.'l-point fa
vorite over Rice; Tennessee was quoted at 14 1-2 points over Wake For
est; and North Carolina State was pegged at 26 points better than Vir
ginia Tech.
( Opposition (letting Tougher
There seems to be a pretty good chance for somebody else waking up
.some Sunday morning with a besmirched escutcheon, inasmuch as some
of these six teams have been living on borrowed time. Take Harvard, for
instance; the Crimson has used up enough luck this season to take care of
the whole Ivy League for a decade. Princeton lost to the Johnnies by o.ne
point, 13-12, and just last week beat a better than average Holy Cross
club by 13-6. The boys from the banks of the broad "A" tangle with
Rutgers this Saturday, and who knows?
It is likewise with the West's only unsullied record (of course, Ore
gon has a slight grey spot on its shield from its 0-0 masterpiece of fu
tility with Washington State). And the Bruins are playing just the team
that can knock them off their pedestal. Don't forget, this is (he same
St. Mary's club that UCLA rose up and hurled back just prior to the
close of last year. And Wedemeyer never forgets. And even if the
Uclans get past the Gaels, there's always Oregon at Portland (and il it
rains . . . ) the next week and Southern Cal on Big Game week.
Georgia is another one that will have its work cut out for itself this
week-end, when the Southerners tangle with Alabama and Harry Gilmer.
Tis true, Tennessee dunked the Crimson Tide, but it does not look beyond
the realm of possibility considering what Wake Forest did to the Vols.
Of the others, Army, Penn and Notre Dame will have what amounts to
another week of grace; Army tangling with a mediocre West Virginia
squad, Penn with an inept Princeton squad, and Notre Dame with the
green Navy. But next week, heads will roll as the Irish and the Cadets
mingle at Yankee Stadium.
That one has been billed as the "game of the century" ever since
Jan. 2, and it looks like for once the hilling will fulfill its claims. When
Davis, Blanchard and Co. collide with Lujack, Inc., the ensuing clang
should be about the biggest noise since V-.l Day.
The winner of that one should be the so-called national champion, even
if they do get knocked off later in the year, Army by Penn or Notre Dame
by USC. If that happened, and there were no undefeated teams left in
the nation, everyone will be able to say it was a good season. Sure, every
body lost, but then so did everyone win. Aw. hell, you just can't please
some people.
"I > assless Wonders* Twice as Good
We now come to the football players, and they're all Stanford men,
bless 'em. Art Levinson, former Daily Sports Editor and now custodian
of Yards Gained and Yards Lost (net and gross) for the locals, dropped in
to deposit a copy of the Cards yardage chart for this season. A pretty
impressive document it is, too.
In five games, the Indians (currently reported as the passless won
ders) have thrown 86 forwards, of which 29 have been completed. The
opposition has pitched 56 and 30 of those found their mark. The joker
comes in here: Stanford's passing yardage is 649 yards as compared with
the opponents .'127. Not bad for a bunch of passless wonders, racking up
twice as many yards as some of the good passing teams they've played.
However, it is on the ground that the Cards have been most impressive
this season, as they should be what with 1,263 yards in their favor as
against the 785 the other sides have run up. And that total is for five
games, too. ,
In all other aspects, the Indians seem to be just like any other team,
they've intercepted eight passes and had seven of theirs taken away;
they've punted 22 times for a 38.86 average while the opposition has booted
28 for a 38.32 average; they've rung up 62 first downs, 50 on foot, to 50
of which 40 were on the ground; they've fumbled 21 times and lost 10 of
'em, while the other side has dropped the ball 24 times and regained it
only nine; and they have been penalizd 25 times for a total of 245 yards
to 21 times for 227 yards. They've also scored 21 touchdowns and 11 con
versions for a total of 137 points while the rivals tallied 13 TD's and booted
nine for 87 points.
Indian Harks Show High Averages
Well, now, that's not too bad, considering they've won three and lost
two. At least they haven't racked up any grand totals like plus one from
scrum like Berkeley did Saturday at Seattle.
But the individual yardstick is our pride and joy, for it is here that
you can see how good our boys are. And there's some very good boys there.
Take Lloyd Merriman. In five games he has lugged the ball all of 94
times. Thats a lot of times to leave yourself wide open for some pretty
vicious tackling. In those !)4 tries he's lost all of 35 yards: he's also
gained 533 yards (not counting the number of passes he's carried a long
long way) for a net total of 498. Bis average is 5.19 per play. If there's
a better man in nylon knickers let him come forward now and speak.
Our candidate for any honors the football world has to offer is hereby
presented for inspection.
But don't get me wrong; there's some other pretty good ball players on
the team. Wayne Erickson has the best average to date, 9.6 for 8 tries,
and Bob Anderson has a 9.5 average for 34 plays. His total is 315 minus
7 for a net of 308. which is good in anybody's league. Then there's George
Quist—until he got hurt last week—who carried 25 times and made 100
yards even for a tally of 4.
The rest of the backfield stats has Fred Sanderman with 5 for 36, Jack
Crahan with 5 for 35, Marty Anderson with 10 for 43. Don Zappetini with
12 for 46, Mickey Titus with 18 for 77, Gene Martin with 14 for 53, Aub
Devine with 8 for 23 and Fred Parsons with 7 for 12. Two of the quarter-

books; Brownson carrying seven for i
a plus five and a minus 31 or minus
3.7, and Forbes with 1 for minus 12.
Yessir, I'd say that was a pretty
fair combination of backs, and any- j
body that wants to challenge that
statement is hereby invited to share |
my seat on Jan. 2 when Barney Gu
yel will consume one dozen choco
late-covered cucumbers atop the j
