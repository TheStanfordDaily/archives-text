# Jerry Jackson Climbing To National Net Heights
## 
### ART LEVINSON 
If in several years you read accounts of Jerry Jackson win
ning the women's national tennis crown, you can chalk up an
other name on the racquet roster of famed Stanford performers.
Enrolled at Stanford this quarter as a frosh, Jerry is currently
seeded number five in the national women's junior division.

With a sparkling success behind the '
17-year-old San Diego girl, it seems \
Jerry's future climb up the tennis j
ladder is a surer thing than Army
whipping West Virginia this Satur
day.
PLAYEI) AT FOREST HILLS
Sitting on a bench at the women's
tennis courts last Sunday afternoon, |
Jerry talked about the junior girl's
national tournament at Philadelphia
last August where she reached the
quarter-finals before bowing out. j
Having nothing but praise for the j
East, her only complaint was the
grass tennis courts. "I was slipping
around so much on the grass, that
1 had to play in my stockings to
stand up," she remarked.
By virtue of being in the com
pany of the six best junior girl
tennis players in the nation, Jerry
was allowed to enter the Forest
Hills tourney in New York, but
she lost in the third round to a
,Canadian girl.
Last month the Eoble tennister
won the singles crown in the junior j
division of the Pacific Coast cham
pionships in San Francisco, and also
won the doubles crown with Arvilla
Maguire, a Cal student. Between
going to classes in the morning, and
travelling to San Francisco in the
afternoon to play tennis, Jerry
claims she's never been so confused
and bewildered in her life.
PLAYING SINCE 14
On a steady tennis diet since she
was 14, Jerry hopes to keep on play
ing while she's at Stanford. "There
aren't any more tournaments this
year, but I hope to play next sum
mer. I'll be in the senior women's
division then,; so the competition
will really be tough," the friendly
southern California girl told us.
There's no better place to play
tennis than in southern California,
Jerry asserts. To prove her point,
she started naming the ranking
players, and the majority of them
claim southern Cal as their home.
The credit for the bulk of the best
tennis players coming out of this
state goes to Perry Jones, secretary
of the Southern California Tennis
Association. Ruling the organization
with an iron hand, Jones arranges
all tournaments, says who'll play in
them, and whom they'll play. When
asked if the players resented this
virtual dictatorship, Jerry replied
that all the kids loved Mr. Jones,
because he sponsored trips to the
Eastern finals, and if it weren't for
him, a lot of the fine players would
never have gotten a chance to de
velop their tennis skill.
STUDY INTERFERES
Tennis for the Jackson girl is
currently relegated to second place.
"Studying keeps me so busy now,"
she remarked. "Western Civ, Span
ish. and English keep me away from
the tennis courts now, but I do man
age to find time to play with some
of the varsity fellows a few after
noons a week," Jerry added.
Asked if she planned to stay at
the tennis game after she finishes
college like Pauline Betz, Sarah
Cooke, and the like, Jerry wasn't
so certain. "I love playing tennis,
and all that goes with it: travel
ing. meeting people, and making
friends, but there is sure a lot of
work involved," Jerry replied.
But for a girl who took up tennis
four years ago because her mother
thought the exercise would be good
for her, we're more inclined to be
lieve that Jerry Jackson v/ill be
playing tennis for a long time, and
that she'll be ranked with the best
of them—if not THE best of them.

PLAYING SINCE 14
On a steady tennis diet since she
was 14, Jerry hopes to keep on play
ing while she's at Stanford. "There
aren't any more tournaments this
year, but I hope to play next sum
mer. I'll be in the senior women's
division then,; so the competition
will really be tough," the friendly
southern California girl told us.
There's no better place to play
tennis than in southern California,
Jerry asserts. To prove her point,
she started naming the ranking
players, and the majority of them
claim southern Cal as their home.
The credit for the bulk of the best
tennis players coming out of this
state goes to Perry Jones, secretary
of the Southern California Tennis
Association. Ruling the organization
with an iron hand, Jones arranges
all tournaments, says who'll play in
them, and whom they'll play. When
asked if the players resented this
virtual dictatorship, Jerry replied
that all the kids loved Mr. Jones,
because he sponsored trips to the
Eastern finals, and if it weren't for
him, a lot of the fine players would
never have gotten a chance to de
velop their tennis skill.
STUDY INTERFERES
Tennis for the Jackson girl is
currently relegated to second place.
"Studying keeps me so busy now,"
she remarked. "Western Civ, Span
ish. and English keep me away from
the tennis courts now, but I do man
age to find time to play with some
of the varsity fellows a few after
noons a week," Jerry added.
Asked if she planned to stay at
the tennis game after she finishes
college like Pauline Betz, Sarah
Cooke, and the like, Jerry wasn't
so certain. "I love playing tennis,
and all that goes with it: travel
ing. meeting people, and making
friends, but there is sure a lot of
work involved," Jerry replied.
But for a girl who took up tennis
four years ago because her mother
thought the exercise would be good
for her, we're more inclined to be
lieve that Jerry Jackson v/ill be
playing tennis for a long time, and
that she'll be ranked with the best
of them—if not THE best of them.
If in several years you read accounts of Jerry Jackson win
ning the women's national tennis crown, you can chalk up an
other name on the racquet roster of famed Stanford performers.
Enrolled at Stanford this quarter as a frosh, Jerry is currently
seeded number five in the national women's junior division.

With a sparkling success behind the '
17-year-old San Diego girl, it seems \
Jerry's future climb up the tennis j
ladder is a surer thing than Army
whipping West Virginia this Satur
day.
PLAYEI) AT FOREST HILLS
Sitting on a bench at the women's
tennis courts last Sunday afternoon, |
Jerry talked about the junior girl's
national tournament at Philadelphia
last August where she reached the
quarter-finals before bowing out. j
Having nothing but praise for the j
East, her only complaint was the
grass tennis courts. "I was slipping
around so much on the grass, that
1 had to play in my stockings to
stand up," she remarked.
By virtue of being in the com
pany of the six best junior girl
tennis players in the nation, Jerry
was allowed to enter the Forest
Hills tourney in New York, but
she lost in the third round to a
,Canadian girl.
Last month the Eoble tennister
won the singles crown in the junior j
division of the Pacific Coast cham
pionships in San Francisco, and also
won the doubles crown with Arvilla
Maguire, a Cal student. Between
going to classes in the morning, and

afternoon to play tennis, Jerry
claims she's never been so confused
