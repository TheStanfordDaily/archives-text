SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 28 (UP).
—The University of Southern Cali
fornia Trojans are the most power
ful football team in (he West today,
says Marchie Schwartz, head coach
at Stanford.
"Despite a record of three wins
against two losses, the Trojans arc
a better team than the undefeated
UCLA Bruins," says Marchie.
Schwartz should know—because
his team has played both clubs and
lost.
"My boys and I believe that if
UCLA and USC were to meet this
week-end, the Trojans would
win,'' Schwartz told the regular
Monday session of the Northern
California Football Writers' As
sociation. "The Trojans have bet
ter balance and are coining along
fast. They'll be very hard to stop
in the future."
Stanford lost to UCLA, 2C-6, early
in the season, and dropped a 28-20
thriller to the Trojans on Saturday.
Schwartz singled out Johnny
Naumu, the newest West Coast Ha
waiian sensation, as the most dan
gerous player on the Trojan squad.
"We weren't afraid of Bobby Mu
sick and the rest so much that last
half Saturday as we were of Naumu.
The boy is a terific breakaway run
ner."
