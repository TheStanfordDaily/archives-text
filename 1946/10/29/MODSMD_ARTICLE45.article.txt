# Varsity Team Prepares For Oregon State Game
## 
### AL MUNK 
Feeling none the worse off after their thrilling heart-breaker
with USC last Saturday, the Indian varsity footballers took to
the practice field again yesterday afternoon. It was really cold
on the Farm yesterday, but the squad went through a short one
hour drill after the usual Monday limbering-up exercises.

"I'm damn proud of the way you
played Saturday. OK, let's go!"
With that short introduction, Mar
chie Schwartz started his men off
on preparations for the Indians'
fourth conference game of the sea
son next Saturday. Slated to leave
Palo Alto sometime Thursday after
noon, the Stanford team will head
north to Corvallis to face the Ore
gon State Beavers in the eighteenth
game of the Stanford-OSC series.
After traversing the field twice
on signal drill, the light workout
switched to quarterbacking prac
tice for Aubrey Devine and Ainslie
Bell with the emphasis quite no
ticeable on passing.
Although the practice field turf
was very wet and slippery, a num
ber of long passes found receivers
able to hold onto the pigskin. Babe
Higgins and Wayne Erickson looked
best on the receiving end of the
long ones, with Devine connecting
to Erickson twice for 30-yard passes
that looked flat and fast. On long
passes Bell was a bit erratic yester
day afternoon, but he was deadly
accurate on short ones across center.
As far as injuries are concerned,
there is some good news. Marty
Feldman, who previously was re
ported as being out of the game for
three weeks will be back in action
for Stanford Saturday next, as will
Harvey Bernard and Gene Martin,
who was kicked in the ankles dur
: ing the Trojan tussle last Saturday.
Lloyd Merriman played his usual
brand of ball although he looks like
he went through a swinging door
the wrong way and got his face
caught.
After the showers, Marchie and
the team looked over the movies of
the USC game and studied up on
some of the Oregon State plays that
Stanford can expect to encounter
j next Saturday.
