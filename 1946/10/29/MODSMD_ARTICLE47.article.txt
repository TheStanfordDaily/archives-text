CHICAGO. Oct. 28 (UP).â€”With
five Big Nine schools reportedly
voting favorably, the Western Con

ter into an agreement with the Pa
cific Coast Conference for participa
tion in the annual Rose Bowl Game.
Purdue University's faculty ath
letic committee tonight formally ap
proved the proposal that the Big
Mine permit its members to partici
pate in the annual Rose Bowl clas
sic, making the fifth team in the
conference which reportedly has fa
vored such action.
Ohio State, Michigan. lowa and
Indiana purportedly favor partici
pation. with Illinois and Minne
sota opposing it. Northwestern
University and Wisconsin have
not yet balloted.
The five schools which reportedly
favor an annual rivalry between the
leaders of the Western Conference

and athletic directors.
The Purdue Athletic Department's
stand was presented to the Purdue
faculty members by Athletic Direc

football coach Cecil Isbell already
had been on record as favoring
participation by Big Nine members.
