# England Honors Dr. Terman
## 
### My JOANNE O'BRIEN 
Dr. Frederick E. Terman, dean of
the School of Engineering, recently
received a letter which stated in
part, "The King (of England) lias
been pleased to award you His Maj
esty's Medal for service in the cause
of freedom."
This medal is an award for the
scientific research work done by Dr.
Terman in electronic warfare at
Harvard University during the war
years. Late in December of 1941 he
was called upon by the Office of
Scientific Research and Development
to form the Radio Research Labo
ratory and to gather a staff of crack
physicists and radio men from all
over the country, and many of Stan
ford's professors and graduates par
ticipated. The scientists were to dis
cover and produce some device to
confuse enemy radar, which was
becoming all too efficient.
DEVELOPS DEVICES
These devices developed by Dr.
Terman and bis associates were of
(wo general types: aluminum foil,
called "window," and electronic
detectors and jammers. More than
pounds of the foil strips
were dropped in Europe alone,
sometimes covering the country
side so completely that it looked
like a snowfall. In the United
States almost the whole produc
tion of aluminum foil went into
and that explains why

there were no foil wrappings on
cigarettes and candy bars.
Aluminum was found to have the
best detrimental effect on the en
emy radar system. A 6-ounce bun
dle of G.OOO strips, dropped from

a plane and scattered in the air,
looked to a radar like three heavy
bombers. The German gunners
would then fire at the aluminum
strips instead of our planes. At the
first "window" raid in 15)43, a hor
rified German radar operator ex
claimed, "The planes are doubling
themselves."
ANTI-RADAR JAMMERS
The other type of anti-radar de
vices was the electronic detectors
or jammers which can be compared
to the static in the radio when the
electric razor is buzzing. The jam
mers attacked enemy radar receiv
ers with radio waves modulated by
random "noise," and drowned out
any radio echoes from the radar's
target.
The most spectacular work
done by these counterineasures
was on D-Day. and was one of the
chief reasons why the Germans
were caught fiat-footed in Nor
mandy. While the jammers were
smashing the German radar sys
tem along the whole coast of
Northern France, a few ships

and pianos feinted toward Calais
with great quantities of "window"
which made it look as if a huge
invading fleet were headed in that
direction.
GETS NAZI ACCLAIM
One of the Nazis' leading radar
scientists, a Professor Vilbig, wrote
on March 7, 11>45: . . Our defense
is practically blind. The awful de
struction of our cities, which tHe
enemy often-times carries out with
negligible losses, is an eloquent
proof of the effectiveness of these
jamming means used by the en
emy."
This quotation is a testimonial
to the success of Dr. Tcrman's
program. Stanford had the largest
representation and composed near
ly 15 per cent of the technical
staff. Forty-two professors ami
graduates from Stanford aided in
this research. Among them were
Skipworth A they. Dr. Felix Bloch,
Morton Hamermesh, Dr. Karl R.
Spangerherg. Oswald G. Villard,
Jr., Clark Call ill. Joseph M. Pet
tit, Dr. Edwin A. Yunker, I)r.
Robert R. Buss, Dr. Horace Over
acker. Dr. D. Taylor, and George
E. Ilulstede.

DR. FREDERICK E. TERMAN
Dr. Frederick E. Terman, dean of
the School of Engineering, recently
received a letter which stated in
part, "The King (of England) lias
been pleased to award you His Maj
esty's Medal for service in the cause
of freedom."
This medal is an award for the
scientific research work done by Dr.
Terman in electronic warfare at
Harvard University during the war
years. Late in December of 1941 he
was called upon by the Office of
Scientific Research and Development
to form the Radio Research Labo
ratory and to gather a staff of crack
physicists and radio men from all
over the country, and many of Stan
ford's professors and graduates par
ticipated. The scientists were to dis
cover and produce some device to
confuse enemy radar, which was
becoming all too efficient.
DEVELOPS DEVICES
These devices developed by Dr.
Terman and bis associates were of
(wo general types: aluminum foil,
called "window," and electronic
detectors and jammers. More than
pounds of the foil strips
were dropped in Europe alone,
sometimes covering the country
side so completely that it looked
like a snowfall. In the United
States almost the whole produc
tion of aluminum foil went into
and that explains why

there were no foil wrappings on
cigarettes and candy bars.
Aluminum was found to have the
best detrimental effect on the en
emy radar system. A 6-ounce bun
dle of G.OOO strips, dropped from

a plane and scattered in the air,
looked to a radar like three heavy
bombers. The German gunners
would then fire at the aluminum
strips instead of our planes. At the
first "window" raid in 15)43, a hor
rified German radar operator ex
claimed, "The planes are doubling
themselves."
ANTI-RADAR JAMMERS
The other type of anti-radar de
vices was the electronic detectors
or jammers which can be compared
to the static in the radio when the
electric razor is buzzing. The jam
mers attacked enemy radar receiv
ers with radio waves modulated by
random "noise," and drowned out
any radio echoes from the radar's
target.
The most spectacular work
done by these counterineasures
was on D-Day. and was one of the
chief reasons why the Germans
were caught fiat-footed in Nor
mandy. While the jammers were
smashing the German radar sys
tem along the whole coast of
Northern France, a few ships

and pianos feinted toward Calais
with great quantities of "window"
which made it look as if a huge
