# 'RO' Calls Cadence Again On Stanford Drill Fields
## 
### JOHN CAMPBELL 
The sharp bark of cadence once
again floats over ihe Stanford cam
pus, raising mixed feelings among
the veterans who had expected to
"leave that behind" when th»y once
again donned levis and yellow sox.
Anyone lured by the novelty of it
can follow the hup, two, three, four
to the drill lield where the Stanford
unit of the Reserve Officers' Train
ing Corps instructs future officers in
close order drill and military dis
cipline.
There are 74 students enrolled in
the local unit, which is commanded
by Col. J. P. Randolph, a veteran of
many missions over Europe.
The ROTC course, which leads
to a commission in the Army He
serve, is composed of two years'
elemental,\ work of general mili
tary training and two years' ad
vanced training, when the student
receives specialized instruction in
one branch of the Army. At the
present time the Field Artillery,
the Quartermaster Corps, the Air
Corps, and the Ordnance Depart
ment have units at Stanford.
Before the war Stanford ROTC
students spent six weeks in a sum
mer camp at Fort Old at the end of
the third year of training, and it is
expected that this program will be
followed again next year.
Veterans with at least a year of
service in any branch of the armed
services are given credit for the two
years of elementary instruction, and
are eligible immediately for the ad
vanced course. All undergraduates
are eligible and students in the
Graduate School of Business may

take quartermaster training.
The ROTC provided the leader
ship for the citizen armies of both
World Wars, and it has proved its
worth many times since being es
tablished in 1916.
Military training at Stanford
dates hack to 1S!I2 when Infantry
training was started. The roughs
didn't support it whole-heartedly,
and after several years the pro
gram was dropped.
The ROTC program at Stanford
is back in full swing after a few
years of inactivity during the war.
The local unit i.s prepared ior in
creased enrollment next quarter,
and has recently made the follow
ing promotions of cadet officers with
the rank of second lieutenant: Field
Artillery — Lucius Burwell, Philip
Feldman, Robert Martin, Theodore
Tennant; Quart ei master — Richard
Dobbins, John Hopwood, James
Welch; Air Corps — Robert Ames,
William Blake, Aubrey Devine.
