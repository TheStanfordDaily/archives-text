we hate bavin to say "No" so frequently.
• But we don't have a nearly large enough supply of
always popular Arrows in stock. It's far below your
demand . . . so that nasty negative often has to come
out, even if it chokes us to say it.
And even when we do have Arrows, we may not have
your correct size. (There's no point in buying a larger
Arrow, expecting the laundry to cut 'em down to size.
Arrow Shirts just don't shrink even I'bccause they're
Sanforized labeled.)
But keep on trying—Arrows are worth waiting for.

"An Arrow Shirt...or else!"
Lay that Crossbow down!
We realize it's still pretty difficult to walk into your
Arrow dealer and find a stack of Arrow Gordon
Oxfords or Arrow Douhlcrs . . . hut they will be

Our Arrow dealers arc doing their level best in a
tough situation. So don't hunt them up with \our
crossbow or Luger.
Keep dropping in on your favorite Arrow dealer
and the first thing you know lie will have just the
shirt you want!
