LONDON, Oct. 2!) (UP). —Winston Churchill, replying to Premier
Joseph Stalin's charge that he is a foremost "incendiary" of a third
world war, today called upon the United Nations to find out exactly how
many troops Russia—and other nations as well—have in Western Europe.
HOW MANY TROOPS?
Churchill expressed skepticism that Stalin's statement that Russia
has (>0 divisions in that area gave an accurate expression of the situation.
He said the essence of the matter was how many troops those divisions
contained.
REPLIES ARE VAGUE
Stalin replied last night to 31 questions submitted to him by Hugh
Buillie, president of the United Press.
His replies set off a chain of reaction throughout the world, the tone
of which generally depended upon whether Stalin's words fitted the pol
icy of tho nation involved.
WANTS DEFINITE ANSWER
Specifically, Churchill complained in a formal statement that the
term "division" did not mean much: "It is not possible to judge the
strength of an army unless not only the number of organized divisions
is known, but also and at the same time the total ration-strength."
CHURCHILL EXPLAINS TERM
By "ration strength," Churchill meant the numerical total of the men
in all the divisions on a given day.
His reply, written at hi.s home in Westerham, Kent, was restrained,
and, in fact, started with: "I have regard and respect for Premier Stalin
and always remember all we went through together."
