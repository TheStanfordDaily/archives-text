# International Monopolies Work For Totalitarianism—Kreps
## 
### 
Americans may realize the clanger to democracy of class, racial, and
political totalitarian forces, but few of us recognize economic totalitarian
ism as it exists under cartel domination, was the warning of Stanford
business economist Theodore J. Kreps last night.
Reasons he cited were (hat only recently—within the past si\ years—

has information become available
on the operations of cartels, and
also that moderns have a "pecul
iar blindness" to right action in
economic life.
Speaking to a large Tuesday Se
ries audience, Mr, Kreps, who has
had varied government experience,
asserted that information now shows
ineontrovertibJy that, wherever po
litical or social totalitarian systems
have been erected instigation and
financial backing has come from cor
poration, trust, combine, and mo
nopoly leaders. German industrial
ists and cartelists welcomed Nazism
to Germany; in fact they had self
admittedly laid plans for world
conflict prior to the rise of Hitler,
Mr. Kreps said recently published
documents and books show.
In Italy, Germany, Spain, Ja
pan, and France, Mr. Kreps point
ed out, industrialists, militarists,
large landowners, nobility, and
higher clergy —in general, the
conservatives—usually threw their
force behind fascist plans. It is
evident now. he said, that Ameri
can forces seeking to free Europe
during the war were aided by la
bor leaders, intellectuals, peasant
ry, lower clergy, and underground
organizations.
It was "one war," Mr. Kreps
said, a war between the economic
totalitarians and those who believed
in free competition, labor rights and
private business rights. Three eco
nomic ideologies are competing to
day—free enterprise, national and
international monopolies, and Com
munism.
Large networks of power, not
responsible to any representative
government, have set up their own
economic states, creating barriers
to free trade necessary to keep
the United Nations operating. For
mer cartel partners of Germans
bargain at council tables right
now. the speaker claimed.
Either government must give up
guaranteeing economic freedom or
| do away with cartel.-!, he affirmed,
j A vigorous enforcement of anti
i trust laws and a bill of rights as
' suring citizens of economic freedom
i is the answer Mr. Kreps proposed.

political totalitarian forces, but few of us recognize economic totalitarian
ism as it exists under cartel domination, was the warning of Stanford
business economist Theodore J. Kreps last night.
Reasons he cited were (hat only recently—within the past si\ years—

has information become available
on the operations of cartels, and
also that moderns have a "pecul
iar blindness" to right action in
economic life.
Speaking to a large Tuesday Se
ries audience, Mr, Kreps, who has
had varied government experience,
asserted that information now shows
ineontrovertibJy that, wherever po
litical or social totalitarian systems
have been erected instigation and
financial backing has come from cor
poration, trust, combine, and mo
nopoly leaders. German industrial
ists and cartelists welcomed Nazism
to Germany; in fact they had self
admittedly laid plans for world
conflict prior to the rise of Hitler,
Mr. Kreps said recently published
documents and books show.
In Italy, Germany, Spain, Ja
pan, and France, Mr. Kreps point
ed out, industrialists, militarists,
large landowners, nobility, and
higher clergy —in general, the
conservatives—usually threw their
force behind fascist plans. It is
evident now. he said, that Ameri
can forces seeking to free Europe
during the war were aided by la
bor leaders, intellectuals, peasant
ry, lower clergy, and underground
organizations.
It was "one war," Mr. Kreps
said, a war between the economic
totalitarians and those who believed
in free competition, labor rights and
private business rights. Three eco
nomic ideologies are competing to
day—free enterprise, national and
international monopolies, and Com
munism.
Large networks of power, not
responsible to any representative
government, have set up their own
economic states, creating barriers
to free trade necessary to keep
the United Nations operating. For
mer cartel partners of Germans
bargain at council tables right
now. the speaker claimed.
Either government must give up
guaranteeing economic freedom or
| do away with cartel.-!, he affirmed,
j A vigorous enforcement of anti
i trust laws and a bill of rights as
' suring citizens of economic freedom
i is the answer Mr. Kreps proposed.
