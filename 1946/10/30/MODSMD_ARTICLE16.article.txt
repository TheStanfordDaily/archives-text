(Herewith is printed the lii-st

conditions in other universities

enrollment. They arc intended to

vantages of Stanford's present ac

Think you have it rough al I he
Village? Tired of sitting two in a
seal in all your classes? Then litre
is the liniment for your crowded
campus aches and pains. Head this
article and find out how the coun
try's other colleges are hearing up
under the post-war flood of st u
d"nts. See how the other half lives
in gymnasiums, trailer campus, and
pup tents, and how they go to class
in cellars, made-over pool rooms,
and old used subway stations.
This week old John Harvard
comes under the knife for dissec
tion. The famed knowledge nook on
the Charles is fair bulging with a
record enrollment of nearly 18.000
students in all the various schools.
This is roughly double what they
had before the war, so naturally
things are just a trifle close in the
yard, which is alrcary so crowded
that there isn't room for an extra
telephone booth. *n fact, all those
who were late in filling out their
room applications arc "temporarily''
sojourning on double bunks in the
gym. All single rooms arc now
sleeping two men, all doubles three

I men, etc., on up to six men in u j
room.
Of course, the married students ;
, arc not interested in living in a
j room with six other men, so spe
i eial arrangements had to be made
for them. As a special favor to j
those who brought their families j
with them. Hahvahd has acquired i
; an old Boston hot' 1 ! which was built
in 1874. Here the husband and wife

But not everybody is so fortunate I

I think the cardboard houses nt the j

miles Hwav at Fort Devcns. There
are 400 of them, too. That's just
like having Encina located on
i Treasure Island. Every morning j

raring to no after a scintillating j
i two - hour trip on the good old
! B. & M. (affectionately known as
■the Bustem and Maime). But. it's
. not really as bad as it sounds since j
j the Fort Devcns trains have special j
j round wheels.
One bright spot in lhc picture is j
that the veterans needn't take their J
children to class with them while i

to pad out the a monlh. 'I li"
Hahvahd father can leave his
bounding offspring in the lovely
Quonset hut nursery. At least this
way junior will know first-hand
some of the horrors of the big war
that daddy is always talking about.
Any student who normally lives
in Greater Boston is still living in
Greater Boston. All those within ;i
45-minute commuting radius must,
live at home. Think of it 45 min
utes of Boston's zoos on wheels
twice a day. Or if you like to play
games you can try to lind your way
to school and back through its glo
rified alleys. Boston is the only city
in the world where they run the
street maps as crossword puzzles.
If flint isn't enough, there is snow
three feet deep on tlr* ground live
months out of the year.
To add insult to injury, on the
front page of the first issue of The
Crimson there was a 200-name list
of examination proctors. For the
sake of the Boston women, let us
hope that there is more chivalry al
Hahvahd than there is honor.
By now you should be feeling a
little better about your short 10-
minute trip to the luxurious Vil
lage, and after you shoo out the
man who has your bunk from ti to
12. you can sleep easy tonight and
dream sweet dreams about the poor
Harvard man who travels ,'52 miles
to sleep three deep on an army cot.
