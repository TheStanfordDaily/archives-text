A TTACK S l{ E A CTIC>N AKI US
Molotov's speech fitted in with
and supplemented the qucstion-and
answer interview which Premier Jo
sef Stalin less than 24 hours before
gave President Hugh Baillie of the
United 3 res.s.
Molotov, like Stalin, attacked
Winston Churchill and "reaction
aries." Like Stalin he criticized the
presence of British troops in Greece
but he went further to say that the
presence of Allied troops generally
in non-enemy territory was devel
oping uneasiness between peoples.
lIARCC II CRITICIZED
Molotov also strongly criticized
Bernard M. Baruch for his Ameri
can atomic energy control plan.
Baruch's plan, Molotov said, was
"unfortunately afflicted with a cer
tain degree of selfishness" or egoism.
While tho Baruch plan calls for
international control of atomic en
ergy, Molotov said, it really is an
attempt to protect "in a veiled form
the monopolistic position of the
United States in this field."
But. Molotov said, the United
States cannot keep its monopoly.
"Science and scientists cannot be
put in a box and kept under lock
and key."
MOLOTOV DEFENDS VETO
Molotov defended the Big Five
veto power at length, and forcefully.
Addressing the U.N. Assembly in a
speech which opened a new phase
of the meeting on a world parlia
ment, Molotov said that the con
tinued presence of Allied troops in
non-enemy territory was develop
ing uneasiness between peoples.

NEW YOI?K, Oct. 29 (UP).—Bernard M. Baruch,
U.S. delegate to the United Nations Atomic Energy
Commission, said tonight that the United States is
ready to accept the Ilussian plan for outlawing the
bomb and destroying our present stock but it must

►first know lliat all other countries
I are prevented from bomb-making
Baruch told the Ilerald-Tribunc
Forum that history records many
idealistic declarations but all lack
I teeth to make them compelling.
EXPLAINS U.S. ATTITUDE
"Frequently the American dele
: gation has been asked why we are
not ready to accept the Russians'
convention or treaty tu outlaw the
bomb and destroy our present
' stocks," he said. "The answer is
\ simple: we are ready to accept it.
In fact, we originally proposed a
| similar plan, but only as a part of
I lie whole. The treaty that will save
J the world must be realistic in its
j workability and effectiveness, in
; stead of merely an expression of
pious intent."
NO ULTERIOR MOTIVES
Baruch said he wished it were
in his power to make it crystal clear
that the United States has no ulte
i ior motives and that it desires to
] serve the world "and in so doing
serve itself."
"But there will be no surender of
i the bomb, unless and until we know
that all other countries are prevent
ed from doing the very thing we
| would be giving up-bomb-making,
j Are we to lw the only ones to dis
; arm? That way is suicide."
Baruch said that to prevent, the
diversion of atomic energy to war
Jit was necessary that an intermit ion
j al atomic agency ' begin at the raw
matei ials" and use every device of
| control.'
LICENSING NECESSARY
He raid licensing, inspection, ac
counting and operation and man
agement were necessary protective
! measures.
"When all this is agreed upon by
a treaty in final form," he said, "all
our know-how, stock of bombs and
j raw materials wili b:? turned over or
disposed of in accordance with the
treaty, which, of course, must he
! ratified under the constitutional
processes of each nation."
NO VETO UNDER Till. TREATY
Baruch emphasized that once the
i treaty was effective there could be
I no veto "against the daily opera-
I lions of the international agency and
i no veto against swift punishment of
; offenders.
He said that this "special proviso
in a special treaty" did not affect
the general veto rights of the Big
Five powers under the U.N. ehar-
I Icr.
