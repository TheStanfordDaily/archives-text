# DAILY EDITORIALS
## The 						Running Corpse? 
### 
It's the inherited custom for Daily edit
wrilers to make a plea for competent student
voters and candidates around election time.
Admitting that it's idealistic, but not impossi
ble, to suppose that everyone reading this
(-•dit will be voting next Wednesday, we have
.1 few brief words which will serve for an "I
told-you-so" if and when you don't like the
candidates elected.
Positions are open, and qualifications list
ed ii today's Daily, for three Village members,
off-campus member, Roble-Branner member,
.1 nd Encina member of Excom, plus the lead
ership spots of the freshman class. The im
portance to the student body of competent
Excom members cannot be overemphasized—
but it's sufficient to say that the privilege of
attending Stanford requires each student to
participate in its government to the extent of
getting good candidates on the ballot and vot
ing for them.
The plan for assemblies at the Village and
among the freshmen to acquaint candidates
and voters is an encouraging indication that

this election has been properly evaluated. A
similar assembly could be held at Toyon, and
candidates in the graduate Excom race could
speak at these meetings if they are interested
enough to try to win. (Nominations are closed
to the election for Toyon and graduate Excom
members, and Men's Council members, since
the ballots are already prepared from the dis
qualified elections two weeks ago.)
As an additional aid to student voters and
pent-up politicians, the Daily will print state
ments of aims or qualifications, up to 50 words
in length, for each candidate who wishes to
submit them.
The worth of student government is mea
sured by the performance of its officials. If
you don't believe in it, you won't nominate,
investigate, or vote. If you consider it a test
of responsible citizenship, you'll do all three.
So off we go again, with lots of candidates
hell-bent for Excom, Men's Council, and the
leadership of the freshman class. Let's hope
that for at least one week the apathetic corpse
of student responsibility revives and starts
running—for the polls.
