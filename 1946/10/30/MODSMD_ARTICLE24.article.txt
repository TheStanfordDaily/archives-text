## BULL SESSION 
### 
I was standing up on the Row the other night
looking at a great big house. There seemed to be a
lot ol people in it and fellows kept coming out with
gurrrrls.
C e, I thought to myself (there being no one else
around to think to), those gurrrrls look as though
they might be able to stay real late, maybe even
until 1:30. And so I thought I'd go in the great big
house and look around.
So I threaded my way among the 17 Cadillacs
parked out front and went in the large door. Inside
1 looked around for the weeping relatives and the
i'_,n saying a fine funeral was as low as $65 but the
only thing I saw was the housemother putting out a
cat which looked very much alive. The housemother
112 wasn't sure about.
The room was so neat that even a cigarette in
an ashtray looked like a burning rubbish pile.
Stacked in a neat pile on the hall table just below
the miiror was a copy of a week-and-a-half-old
Crescent City Gazette.
The whole room had the quiet hushed atmosphere
of a cathedral, broken only infrequently by gome
one screeching up the stairs, "HEY, Mabel, it's me,
Joe.' At this point a raucous feminine chorus al
ways screamed back, "WHO?" and Joe invariably
took his line over again until it sounded like the
second act of a Gilbert and Sullivan show.
In a darkened back room, a couple sat conversing
in low whispers and long pauses. Every five minutes
(he housemother would stalk into the room and stare
. t the in to see what they were doing. At this point,
l.c v.:.s always studying a December Alumni Review
while she glanced through a IS2G Quad. Which is
not what they were doing during the five-minute
intervals while the housemother was out in the
I: it ('hen bawling out the hashers.
In a far corner of the living room sat a fellow
n ading. Every few minutes he would grin lewdly.

I walked over to see what he was studying. He hid
it at first and then finally showed me. It was a panty
girdle ad on the sports page of the Daily.
"Look," he leered, "feelthy pictures." I left him
drooling and turned my attention to another fellow
waiting nervously on the edge of a chair that looked
as though it would collapse if you sneezed at it.
He was obviously awaiting a blind date. He
chewed nervously on his elbow. Occasionally he
would tear his handkerchief and twist it. Then down
the stairs came his date. There was the light patter
of baby feet on the stairway as she descended. Baby
elephant feet! She weighed at least 235 and the
house shook as she moved.
"I don't care if she does have a good personality
and a swell sense of humor," the fellow screamed,
"she's a beast." And he fled into the night.
The behemoth looked hopefully at me for a min
ute and then lumbered back up the stairs again. "Oh.
well," she muttered, "there's always the exchange
dinner next Wednesday," and disappeared from
sight.
Then 12 girls came in and took all the living room
furniture upstairs and put it in the bathtub.
"This is a sophomore sneak. We are sophomores.
This is an old tradition. This is done every quarter.
This is very, very funny," one of them explained to
me, as she hung several seniors tastefully from the
chandelier by their unmentionables.
At this point I said goodnight to the housemother,
who was chasing one of the hashers around the
dining room table despite his cries of "I'm a married
man. I'm a married man," and walked out into the
night.
I turned and looked back at the big house with
its bright lights, stumbled over a couple necking on
a motor scooter, and then left for my fluids seminar
at Rossotti's.

112 wasn't sure about.
The room was so neat that even a cigarette in
an ashtray looked like a burning rubbish pile.
Stacked in a neat pile on the hall table just below
the miiror was a copy of a week-and-a-half-old
Crescent City Gazette.
The whole room had the quiet hushed atmosphere
of a cathedral, broken only infrequently by gome
one screeching up the stairs, "HEY, Mabel, it's me,
Joe.' At this point a raucous feminine chorus al
ways screamed back, "WHO?" and Joe invariably
took his line over again until it sounded like the
second act of a Gilbert and Sullivan show.
In a darkened back room, a couple sat conversing
in low whispers and long pauses. Every five minutes
(he housemother would stalk into the room and stare
. t the in to see what they were doing. At this point,
l.c v.:.s always studying a December Alumni Review
while she glanced through a IS2G Quad. Which is
not what they were doing during the five-minute
intervals while the housemother was out in the
I: it ('hen bawling out the hashers.
In a far corner of the living room sat a fellow
n ading. Every few minutes he would grin lewdly.

I walked over to see what he was studying. He hid
it at first and then finally showed me. It was a panty
girdle ad on the sports page of the Daily.
"Look," he leered, "feelthy pictures." I left him
drooling and turned my attention to another fellow
waiting nervously on the edge of a chair that looked
as though it would collapse if you sneezed at it.
He was obviously awaiting a blind date. He
chewed nervously on his elbow. Occasionally he
would tear his handkerchief and twist it. Then down
the stairs came his date. There was the light patter
of baby feet on the stairway as she descended. Baby
elephant feet! She weighed at least 235 and the
house shook as she moved.
"I don't care if she does have a good personality
and a swell sense of humor," the fellow screamed,
"she's a beast." And he fled into the night.
The behemoth looked hopefully at me for a min
ute and then lumbered back up the stairs again. "Oh.
well," she muttered, "there's always the exchange
dinner next Wednesday," and disappeared from
sight.
Then 12 girls came in and took all the living room
furniture upstairs and put it in the bathtub.
"This is a sophomore sneak. We are sophomores.
This is an old tradition. This is done every quarter.
This is very, very funny," one of them explained to
me, as she hung several seniors tastefully from the
chandelier by their unmentionables.
At this point I said goodnight to the housemother,
who was chasing one of the hashers around the
dining room table despite his cries of "I'm a married
man. I'm a married man," and walked out into the
night.
I turned and looked back at the big house with
its bright lights, stumbled over a couple necking on
a motor scooter, and then left for my fluids seminar
at Rossotti's.
Ain't college life wonderful?
I was standing up on the Row the other night
looking at a great big house. There seemed to be a
lot ol people in it and fellows kept coming out with
gurrrrls.
C e, I thought to myself (there being no one else
around to think to), those gurrrrls look as though
they might be able to stay real late, maybe even
until 1:30. And so I thought I'd go in the great big
house and look around.
So I threaded my way among the 17 Cadillacs
parked out front and went in the large door. Inside
1 looked around for the weeping relatives and the
i'_,n saying a fine funeral was as low as $65 but the
only thing I saw was the housemother putting out a
cat which looked very much alive. The housemother
