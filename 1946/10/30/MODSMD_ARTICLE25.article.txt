KNOWLAND FOR SENATOR?
When the wild claims of both parties are dis
counted, William F. Knowland is found to be neither
■ n angel fighting for all good things nor the devil
in human shape.
What is most interesting about the man we are
asked to send to Washington is his normalcy. He is
respectable, safe, sound, conservative, he takes orders
from his party—^he.has in fact many of the peculiar
political virtues voters tind attractive.
When you read his speeches or hear him talk you
have the pleasant feeling that the world of 194(5 is
l he same as that of 1926 or 1906, except for dress and
car styles. Atom bombs, wars, rockets, thought of
one world or two are far away and not very real.
Solutions tor the troubles of today seem so simple
as seen by him. Shortages of goods? Knock out
controls. Lack of housing? The Bricker-Knowland
recipe: "turn industry and labor loose to do the job."
Labor troubles? Pass anti-strike laws, make the
unions keep their place. International difficulties?
That s too complex to drag into a campaign.
Little does it matter to Knowland and his G.O.P.
friends that existing supply means that removal of
ceilings would (and did) lead to considerably higher
prices and little increase in production; that high
er prices would cause unions to demand better wages
and accentuate our labor problems; that as far as
housing is concerned industry and labor have been
"loose" a long time now and millions of vets are
still looking for a place to live (the conservative ele
ments in Congress spearheaded by Republican lead

ership wrccked all housing legislation and now blame
the Administration).
If Knowland drove down Ei Camino—or any oili
er highway—he would see new stores, drive-ins,
movies mushrooming. Two minutes from his head
quarters a large store is being built and the architect
said he had no trouble at all getting materials—be
cause the store owners also control an influential
restaurant chain. Yes, industry has been turned
loose. Industry isn't suffering but the vet waiting for
his house is.
Knowland asks you to vote for him because he
has, among other accomplishments, "worked and
voted for sound labor-management policies." He
worked and voted for the Case Anti-Strike Bill, ac
cording to which free enterprise means freedom for
industry only, not for labor. He worked and voted
for the fantastic President's Labor Bill which, if
passed, would have made many strikers subject to
draft into the army and provide sweeping penalties
for strikers and union leaders. That's sound labor
management policy.
Knowland. friend of labor, worked hard to defeat
a bill that would have raised unemployment com
pensation to the munificent sum of $25 a week. Of
course he never had to support a family on twenty
dollars a week.
Tuesday the voters will have the choice whether
or not they want to return to the comfortable nor
malcy of the Harding-Coolidge-Hoover era—to the
good old ostrich policies of international irresponsi
bility and national hypocrisy.
