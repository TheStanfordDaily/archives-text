## CARD STUNTS 
### 
Apart from the beautiful brand of football Stanford played against the
Trojans Saturday, top news item of the week was Howie Dallmar leaving
the Farm to play professional basketball in the East. It all started Thurs
day morning when Howie got a long-distance phone call from a man who
offered the Indian hoop star around 10,000 smackers for one season's play
with the new American Basketball League. It wasn't the first phone call
of that sort that Howie Dallmar had received in his life, but it certainly
was the highest bid for his services he had ever received. After talking it
over with his folks, Howie decided to accept on Friday, packed his bags
over the week-end, and left the West Coast by air on Monday. He will
play ball with the Philadelphia Warriors for three months, and though the
final contract signed is short of the original offer, Howie's pay for ninety
days of basketball will still be slightly over the 9,500 dollar mark.
I had a talk with Howie just before he left, and he was feeling quite
badly about leaving Stanford and the basketball team. He asked that any
one who felt that he shouldn't have accepted the pro offer think over how
they would have acted if they got the same offer.
"I'm telling you. Al, I can't afford to (urn down that much dough for
just three months of work. I know how much the team might have de
pended on me, and it was a hard decision to make, but there's no two
ways about it. I know there are plcntj of good hall players to take my
place for Stanford, and 1 sure hope they go places next season."
As to Howie not being able to afford to turn clown such a luscious offer,
1 seriously agree with him. If the blame for turning college athletes to
wards the pro-leagues must be put at somebody's doorstep. I think it
should point at the men who wave those big bundles of greenbacks in the
faces of nice kids like Howie Dallmar. These men realize perfectly well
that no young man not yet out of college will turn back such easy money
just for the sake of his alma mater, It would be expecting more of Howie
than most of us would be willing to sacrifice if we were in the same spot.
In connection with what Howie had to say about there being plenty of
good basketball players to take his place this season, let's have a look
what the prospects are of finding men to take Howie's place and play for
the Injuns next season.
There's fresh team star Dave Davidson on the varsity lists this year.
Dave, who is tall—(i-foot-3—and rugged, is tops on rebound shots, and a
good prospect for forward position. Morley Thompson, who also got his
experience on the frosh team, is a fast player, with exceptionally good
eyes for long shots, and able to shoot with both hands. For the center or
guard spots, there are three fine players in Dick Berlin. Bob Rowe, and
Fred Oliver. Berlin also started play for Stanford on the frosh team in
'42, and has a terrific right-handed hook shot to boast of. Ilowe, besides
a good eye for long shots, has a great deal of drive and is tops in the
rebound department. Oliver, who is (i-foot-3, played two years of varsity
ball, one of them on the championship NCAA team in '42 together with
Ilowie Dallmar.
In addition Stanford can depend on the services of Bill Stevenson. Gus
Chavalas, and Milt Iverson. Stevenson, another 6-foot-3 player, is best
known as a tip-in artist on the team. Chavalas is a newcomer from Oak
land Tech High, having held the guard spot; on the All-Europe service team
during the summer of '45, and is a fast-starting, good ball passer. Iverson
played ball for a Navy service team, has a lot of drive and a good eye.
And that's not all. There's Bill Drehabl, a hard-driving forward from
Indiana; two twin brothers from the University of Utah's NCAA National
Championship team of '43 by the nam? of Bob and Fred Lewis, and Hugh
West from Cal Tech. Then there arc Bill Christensen, Tom Murphy, and
Bill Rodman who played on the '45 basketball team and are returning
lettermen with plenty of experience.
Four more promising players are not practicing out yet because they're
busy on Marchie's football team. They are Ainslie Bell, Buck Brownson,
Babe Higgins ancl Jack Crahan, and certainly need no further introduction.
Incidentally, Babe Higgins made all-Coast honors at Cal when he played
there under the Marine training program.
Since Coach Everett Dean has been East attending his father's funeral,
the boys have been working out with Assistant Coach Jack Dana who
played forward on the Stanford team in '42 and in '43. So far most of the
workouts have consisted of laps around the track, wind sprints, ball han
dling exercises, and work on developing shots, but as most of the men
have had some service experience, it is hard to say who could be expected
to (ill in the big gaps left by Howie Dallmar's loss. At any rate there are
plenty of men working the basketball abound these afternoons, and maybe
one of them can fill Dallmar's shoes.

The Intramural program is coming along fine. Under Dutch Warmer
dam's guiding hand, Intramural football and volleyball at present are the
two main sports, but golf and horseshoes are starting up this week, and
before the season is over, more than ten sports will appear on the Intra
mural program.
Up to date, 42 football games have been played, and 150 men have
seen action each day for four days in the football leagues. That may
seem like a lot of men to you. but Al Masters told me that if more men
want to play ball on this Intramural program, they can do so.
"I'd like to see a lot of veterans who take no P.T. come out and par
ticipate in the program. All are welcome, and we'll expand the program
as much as they want."
This seems like encouraging news from the Director of Athletics, so
anyone should feel free to take advantage of this policy. The Intramural
program is for men who want physical exercise and games in the after
noon. and those out now can verify the fun it is.
The outstanding football team of last week was the Firehouse squad.
They were hotter than a firecracker, and won their two games over Row
teams 23-0 and 47-0. Individual honors go to Delta Tau Ward Madera
who caught a 25-yard pass one-armed and ran 15 yards for a TD as the
Delta Taus rolled over the Toyon Tornadoes 4.3-0.
So far 5 games have been played in the newly started volleyball league,
and the only group that can be singled out are the Southern California boys
from Santa Monica who serve like eannonballs.

Boxing Coach Clayton Frye, national AAU middleweight champion of
'25. is working out with some of our rougher men in the gym most every
afternoon preparing for the coming boxing season. His right-hand man
around the ring Is Malcolm (Scoop) Mynderse, brother of Frank Mynderse
who used to be assistant boxing coach from '37 to '39. Although there is a
dearth of lighterweights. the other classes are well represented on campus.
Frank Hewitt, C'happie editor of the knock-em out calibre, and run
ncrup to John Ward in the Pacific Coast intercollegiate boxing tourna
ment of '42. is one of the better prospects for the Farm team. There's
also John McClure, who won the all-University middleweight title in
January of (his year, and "Yank" Levin, a veteran of the '41 Indian team
and title holder of the University light-heavy weight championship.
Peter Willett, a newcomer from Piedmont, looks very good in the ring
and is a welterweight Also a good prospective for the light heavyweight
< lass is Joe Cranmer. as are Ervvin Rosa, Walt Field, and Bob Hudson
who fought for (he UCLA varsity in '44.
1 here's no doubt that some roughs on campus are living up to their
cognomen.

over the week-end, and left the West Coast by air on Monday. He will
play ball with the Philadelphia Warriors for three months, and though the
final contract signed is short of the original offer, Howie's pay for ninety
days of basketball will still be slightly over the 9,500 dollar mark.
I had a talk with Howie just before he left, and he was feeling quite
badly about leaving Stanford and the basketball team. He asked that any
one who felt that he shouldn't have accepted the pro offer think over how
they would have acted if they got the same offer.
"I'm telling you. Al, I can't afford to (urn down that much dough for
just three months of work. I know how much the team might have de
pended on me, and it was a hard decision to make, but there's no two
ways about it. I know there are plcntj of good hall players to take my
place for Stanford, and 1 sure hope they go places next season."
As to Howie not being able to afford to turn clown such a luscious offer,
1 seriously agree with him. If the blame for turning college athletes to
wards the pro-leagues must be put at somebody's doorstep. I think it
should point at the men who wave those big bundles of greenbacks in the
faces of nice kids like Howie Dallmar. These men realize perfectly well
that no young man not yet out of college will turn back such easy money
just for the sake of his alma mater, It would be expecting more of Howie
than most of us would be willing to sacrifice if we were in the same spot.
In connection with what Howie had to say about there being plenty of
good basketball players to take his place this season, let's have a look
what the prospects are of finding men to take Howie's place and play for
the Injuns next season.
There's fresh team star Dave Davidson on the varsity lists this year.
Dave, who is tall—(i-foot-3—and rugged, is tops on rebound shots, and a
good prospect for forward position. Morley Thompson, who also got his
experience on the frosh team, is a fast player, with exceptionally good
eyes for long shots, and able to shoot with both hands. For the center or
guard spots, there are three fine players in Dick Berlin. Bob Rowe, and
Fred Oliver. Berlin also started play for Stanford on the frosh team in
'42, and has a terrific right-handed hook shot to boast of. Ilowe, besides
a good eye for long shots, has a great deal of drive and is tops in the
rebound department. Oliver, who is (i-foot-3, played two years of varsity
ball, one of them on the championship NCAA team in '42 together with
Ilowie Dallmar.
In addition Stanford can depend on the services of Bill Stevenson. Gus
Chavalas, and Milt Iverson. Stevenson, another 6-foot-3 player, is best
known as a tip-in artist on the team. Chavalas is a newcomer from Oak
land Tech High, having held the guard spot; on the All-Europe service team
during the summer of '45, and is a fast-starting, good ball passer. Iverson
played ball for a Navy service team, has a lot of drive and a good eye.
And that's not all. There's Bill Drehabl, a hard-driving forward from
Indiana; two twin brothers from the University of Utah's NCAA National
Championship team of '43 by the nam? of Bob and Fred Lewis, and Hugh
West from Cal Tech. Then there arc Bill Christensen, Tom Murphy, and
Bill Rodman who played on the '45 basketball team and are returning
lettermen with plenty of experience.
Four more promising players are not practicing out yet because they're
busy on Marchie's football team. They are Ainslie Bell, Buck Brownson,
Babe Higgins ancl Jack Crahan, and certainly need no further introduction.
Incidentally, Babe Higgins made all-Coast honors at Cal when he played
there under the Marine training program.
Since Coach Everett Dean has been East attending his father's funeral,
the boys have been working out with Assistant Coach Jack Dana who
played forward on the Stanford team in '42 and in '43. So far most of the
workouts have consisted of laps around the track, wind sprints, ball han
dling exercises, and work on developing shots, but as most of the men
have had some service experience, it is hard to say who could be expected
to (ill in the big gaps left by Howie Dallmar's loss. At any rate there are
plenty of men working the basketball abound these afternoons, and maybe
one of them can fill Dallmar's shoes.

The Intramural program is coming along fine. Under Dutch Warmer
dam's guiding hand, Intramural football and volleyball at present are the
two main sports, but golf and horseshoes are starting up this week, and
before the season is over, more than ten sports will appear on the Intra
mural program.
Up to date, 42 football games have been played, and 150 men have
seen action each day for four days in the football leagues. That may
seem like a lot of men to you. but Al Masters told me that if more men
want to play ball on this Intramural program, they can do so.
"I'd like to see a lot of veterans who take no P.T. come out and par
ticipate in the program. All are welcome, and we'll expand the program
as much as they want."
This seems like encouraging news from the Director of Athletics, so
anyone should feel free to take advantage of this policy. The Intramural
program is for men who want physical exercise and games in the after
noon. and those out now can verify the fun it is.
The outstanding football team of last week was the Firehouse squad.
They were hotter than a firecracker, and won their two games over Row
teams 23-0 and 47-0. Individual honors go to Delta Tau Ward Madera
who caught a 25-yard pass one-armed and ran 15 yards for a TD as the
Delta Taus rolled over the Toyon Tornadoes 4.3-0.
So far 5 games have been played in the newly started volleyball league,
and the only group that can be singled out are the Southern California boys
from Santa Monica who serve like eannonballs.

Boxing Coach Clayton Frye, national AAU middleweight champion of
'25. is working out with some of our rougher men in the gym most every
afternoon preparing for the coming boxing season. His right-hand man
around the ring Is Malcolm (Scoop) Mynderse, brother of Frank Mynderse
who used to be assistant boxing coach from '37 to '39. Although there is a
dearth of lighterweights. the other classes are well represented on campus.
Frank Hewitt, C'happie editor of the knock-em out calibre, and run
ncrup to John Ward in the Pacific Coast intercollegiate boxing tourna
ment of '42. is one of the better prospects for the Farm team. There's
also John McClure, who won the all-University middleweight title in
January of (his year, and "Yank" Levin, a veteran of the '41 Indian team
and title holder of the University light-heavy weight championship.
Peter Willett, a newcomer from Piedmont, looks very good in the ring
and is a welterweight Also a good prospective for the light heavyweight
< lass is Joe Cranmer. as are Ervvin Rosa, Walt Field, and Bob Hudson
who fought for (he UCLA varsity in '44.
1 here's no doubt that some roughs on campus are living up to their
cognomen.
Apart from the beautiful brand of football Stanford played against the
Trojans Saturday, top news item of the week was Howie Dallmar leaving
the Farm to play professional basketball in the East. It all started Thurs
day morning when Howie got a long-distance phone call from a man who
offered the Indian hoop star around 10,000 smackers for one season's play
with the new American Basketball League. It wasn't the first phone call
of that sort that Howie Dallmar had received in his life, but it certainly
was the highest bid for his services he had ever received. After talking it

"I'm telling you. Al, I can't afford to (urn down that much dough for
just three months of work. I know how much the team might have de
pended on me, and it was a hard decision to make, but there's no two
ways about it. I know there are plcntj of good hall players to take my
place for Stanford, and 1 sure hope they go places next season."
As to Howie not being able to afford to turn clown such a luscious offer,
1 seriously agree with him. If the blame for turning college athletes to
wards the pro-leagues must be put at somebody's doorstep. I think it
should point at the men who wave those big bundles of greenbacks in the
faces of nice kids like Howie Dallmar. These men realize perfectly well
that no young man not yet out of college will turn back such easy money
just for the sake of his alma mater, It would be expecting more of Howie
than most of us would be willing to sacrifice if we were in the same spot.
In connection with what Howie had to say about there being plenty of
good basketball players to take his place this season, let's have a look
what the prospects are of finding men to take Howie's place and play for
the Injuns next season.
There's fresh team star Dave Davidson on the varsity lists this year.
Dave, who is tall—(i-foot-3—and rugged, is tops on rebound shots, and a
good prospect for forward position. Morley Thompson, who also got his
experience on the frosh team, is a fast player, with exceptionally good
eyes for long shots, and able to shoot with both hands. For the center or
guard spots, there are three fine players in Dick Berlin. Bob Rowe, and
Fred Oliver. Berlin also started play for Stanford on the frosh team in
'42, and has a terrific right-handed hook shot to boast of. Ilowe, besides
a good eye for long shots, has a great deal of drive and is tops in the
rebound department. Oliver, who is (i-foot-3, played two years of varsity
ball, one of them on the championship NCAA team in '42 together with
Ilowie Dallmar.
In addition Stanford can depend on the services of Bill Stevenson. Gus
Chavalas, and Milt Iverson. Stevenson, another 6-foot-3 player, is best
known as a tip-in artist on the team. Chavalas is a newcomer from Oak
land Tech High, having held the guard spot; on the All-Europe service team
during the summer of '45, and is a fast-starting, good ball passer. Iverson
played ball for a Navy service team, has a lot of drive and a good eye.
And that's not all. There's Bill Drehabl, a hard-driving forward from
Indiana; two twin brothers from the University of Utah's NCAA National
Championship team of '43 by the nam? of Bob and Fred Lewis, and Hugh
West from Cal Tech. Then there arc Bill Christensen, Tom Murphy, and
Bill Rodman who played on the '45 basketball team and are returning
lettermen with plenty of experience.
Four more promising players are not practicing out yet because they're
busy on Marchie's football team. They are Ainslie Bell, Buck Brownson,
Babe Higgins ancl Jack Crahan, and certainly need no further introduction.
Incidentally, Babe Higgins made all-Coast honors at Cal when he played
there under the Marine training program.
Since Coach Everett Dean has been East attending his father's funeral,
the boys have been working out with Assistant Coach Jack Dana who
played forward on the Stanford team in '42 and in '43. So far most of the
workouts have consisted of laps around the track, wind sprints, ball han
dling exercises, and work on developing shots, but as most of the men
have had some service experience, it is hard to say who could be expected
to (ill in the big gaps left by Howie Dallmar's loss. At any rate there are
plenty of men working the basketball abound these afternoons, and maybe
one of them can fill Dallmar's shoes.

The Intramural program is coming along fine. Under Dutch Warmer
dam's guiding hand, Intramural football and volleyball at present are the
two main sports, but golf and horseshoes are starting up this week, and
before the season is over, more than ten sports will appear on the Intra
mural program.
Up to date, 42 football games have been played, and 150 men have
seen action each day for four days in the football leagues. That may
seem like a lot of men to you. but Al Masters told me that if more men
want to play ball on this Intramural program, they can do so.
"I'd like to see a lot of veterans who take no P.T. come out and par
ticipate in the program. All are welcome, and we'll expand the program
as much as they want."
This seems like encouraging news from the Director of Athletics, so
anyone should feel free to take advantage of this policy. The Intramural
program is for men who want physical exercise and games in the after
noon. and those out now can verify the fun it is.
The outstanding football team of last week was the Firehouse squad.
They were hotter than a firecracker, and won their two games over Row
teams 23-0 and 47-0. Individual honors go to Delta Tau Ward Madera
who caught a 25-yard pass one-armed and ran 15 yards for a TD as the
Delta Taus rolled over the Toyon Tornadoes 4.3-0.
So far 5 games have been played in the newly started volleyball league,
and the only group that can be singled out are the Southern California boys
from Santa Monica who serve like eannonballs.

Boxing Coach Clayton Frye, national AAU middleweight champion of
'25. is working out with some of our rougher men in the gym most every
afternoon preparing for the coming boxing season. His right-hand man
around the ring Is Malcolm (Scoop) Mynderse, brother of Frank Mynderse
who used to be assistant boxing coach from '37 to '39. Although there is a
dearth of lighterweights. the other classes are well represented on campus.
Frank Hewitt, C'happie editor of the knock-em out calibre, and run
ncrup to John Ward in the Pacific Coast intercollegiate boxing tourna
ment of '42. is one of the better prospects for the Farm team. There's
also John McClure, who won the all-University middleweight title in
January of (his year, and "Yank" Levin, a veteran of the '41 Indian team
and title holder of the University light-heavy weight championship.
Peter Willett, a newcomer from Piedmont, looks very good in the ring
and is a welterweight Also a good prospective for the light heavyweight
< lass is Joe Cranmer. as are Ervvin Rosa, Walt Field, and Bob Hudson
who fought for (he UCLA varsity in '44.
1 here's no doubt that some roughs on campus are living up to their
cognomen.
Apart from the beautiful brand of football Stanford played against the
Trojans Saturday, top news item of the week was Howie Dallmar leaving
the Farm to play professional basketball in the East. It all started Thurs
day morning when Howie got a long-distance phone call from a man who
offered the Indian hoop star around 10,000 smackers for one season's play
with the new American Basketball League. It wasn't the first phone call
of that sort that Howie Dallmar had received in his life, but it certainly
was the highest bid for his services he had ever received. After talking it
over with his folks, Howie decided to accept on Friday, packed his bags
over the week-end, and left the West Coast by air on Monday. He will
play ball with the Philadelphia Warriors for three months, and though the
final contract signed is short of the original offer, Howie's pay for ninety
days of basketball will still be slightly over the 9,500 dollar mark.
I had a talk with Howie just before he left, and he was feeling quite
badly about leaving Stanford and the basketball team. He asked that any
one who felt that he shouldn't have accepted the pro offer think over how
they would have acted if they got the same offer.
"I'm telling you. Al, I can't afford to (urn down that much dough for

should point at the men who wave those big bundles of greenbacks in the
faces of nice kids like Howie Dallmar. These men realize perfectly well
that no young man not yet out of college will turn back such easy money
just for the sake of his alma mater, It would be expecting more of Howie
than most of us would be willing to sacrifice if we were in the same spot.
In connection with what Howie had to say about there being plenty of
good basketball players to take his place this season, let's have a look
what the prospects are of finding men to take Howie's place and play for
the Injuns next season.
There's fresh team star Dave Davidson on the varsity lists this year.
Dave, who is tall—(i-foot-3—and rugged, is tops on rebound shots, and a
good prospect for forward position. Morley Thompson, who also got his
experience on the frosh team, is a fast player, with exceptionally good
eyes for long shots, and able to shoot with both hands. For the center or
guard spots, there are three fine players in Dick Berlin. Bob Rowe, and
Fred Oliver. Berlin also started play for Stanford on the frosh team in
'42, and has a terrific right-handed hook shot to boast of. Ilowe, besides
a good eye for long shots, has a great deal of drive and is tops in the
rebound department. Oliver, who is (i-foot-3, played two years of varsity
ball, one of them on the championship NCAA team in '42 together with
Ilowie Dallmar.
In addition Stanford can depend on the services of Bill Stevenson. Gus
Chavalas, and Milt Iverson. Stevenson, another 6-foot-3 player, is best
known as a tip-in artist on the team. Chavalas is a newcomer from Oak
land Tech High, having held the guard spot; on the All-Europe service team
during the summer of '45, and is a fast-starting, good ball passer. Iverson
played ball for a Navy service team, has a lot of drive and a good eye.
And that's not all. There's Bill Drehabl, a hard-driving forward from
Indiana; two twin brothers from the University of Utah's NCAA National
Championship team of '43 by the nam? of Bob and Fred Lewis, and Hugh
West from Cal Tech. Then there arc Bill Christensen, Tom Murphy, and
Bill Rodman who played on the '45 basketball team and are returning
lettermen with plenty of experience.
Four more promising players are not practicing out yet because they're
busy on Marchie's football team. They are Ainslie Bell, Buck Brownson,
Babe Higgins ancl Jack Crahan, and certainly need no further introduction.
Incidentally, Babe Higgins made all-Coast honors at Cal when he played
there under the Marine training program.
Since Coach Everett Dean has been East attending his father's funeral,
the boys have been working out with Assistant Coach Jack Dana who
played forward on the Stanford team in '42 and in '43. So far most of the
workouts have consisted of laps around the track, wind sprints, ball han
dling exercises, and work on developing shots, but as most of the men
have had some service experience, it is hard to say who could be expected
to (ill in the big gaps left by Howie Dallmar's loss. At any rate there are
plenty of men working the basketball abound these afternoons, and maybe
one of them can fill Dallmar's shoes.

The Intramural program is coming along fine. Under Dutch Warmer
dam's guiding hand, Intramural football and volleyball at present are the
two main sports, but golf and horseshoes are starting up this week, and
before the season is over, more than ten sports will appear on the Intra
mural program.
Up to date, 42 football games have been played, and 150 men have
seen action each day for four days in the football leagues. That may
seem like a lot of men to you. but Al Masters told me that if more men
want to play ball on this Intramural program, they can do so.
"I'd like to see a lot of veterans who take no P.T. come out and par
ticipate in the program. All are welcome, and we'll expand the program
as much as they want."
This seems like encouraging news from the Director of Athletics, so
anyone should feel free to take advantage of this policy. The Intramural
program is for men who want physical exercise and games in the after
noon. and those out now can verify the fun it is.
The outstanding football team of last week was the Firehouse squad.
They were hotter than a firecracker, and won their two games over Row
teams 23-0 and 47-0. Individual honors go to Delta Tau Ward Madera
who caught a 25-yard pass one-armed and ran 15 yards for a TD as the
Delta Taus rolled over the Toyon Tornadoes 4.3-0.
So far 5 games have been played in the newly started volleyball league,
and the only group that can be singled out are the Southern California boys
from Santa Monica who serve like eannonballs.

Boxing Coach Clayton Frye, national AAU middleweight champion of
'25. is working out with some of our rougher men in the gym most every
afternoon preparing for the coming boxing season. His right-hand man
around the ring Is Malcolm (Scoop) Mynderse, brother of Frank Mynderse
who used to be assistant boxing coach from '37 to '39. Although there is a
dearth of lighterweights. the other classes are well represented on campus.
Frank Hewitt, C'happie editor of the knock-em out calibre, and run
ncrup to John Ward in the Pacific Coast intercollegiate boxing tourna
ment of '42. is one of the better prospects for the Farm team. There's
also John McClure, who won the all-University middleweight title in
January of (his year, and "Yank" Levin, a veteran of the '41 Indian team
and title holder of the University light-heavy weight championship.
Peter Willett, a newcomer from Piedmont, looks very good in the ring
and is a welterweight Also a good prospective for the light heavyweight
< lass is Joe Cranmer. as are Ervvin Rosa, Walt Field, and Bob Hudson
who fought for (he UCLA varsity in '44.
1 here's no doubt that some roughs on campus are living up to their
cognomen.
Apart from the beautiful brand of football Stanford played against the
Trojans Saturday, top news item of the week was Howie Dallmar leaving
the Farm to play professional basketball in the East. It all started Thurs
day morning when Howie got a long-distance phone call from a man who
offered the Indian hoop star around 10,000 smackers for one season's play
with the new American Basketball League. It wasn't the first phone call
of that sort that Howie Dallmar had received in his life, but it certainly
was the highest bid for his services he had ever received. After talking it
over with his folks, Howie decided to accept on Friday, packed his bags
over the week-end, and left the West Coast by air on Monday. He will
play ball with the Philadelphia Warriors for three months, and though the
final contract signed is short of the original offer, Howie's pay for ninety
days of basketball will still be slightly over the 9,500 dollar mark.
I had a talk with Howie just before he left, and he was feeling quite
badly about leaving Stanford and the basketball team. He asked that any
one who felt that he shouldn't have accepted the pro offer think over how
they would have acted if they got the same offer.
"I'm telling you. Al, I can't afford to (urn down that much dough for
just three months of work. I know how much the team might have de
pended on me, and it was a hard decision to make, but there's no two
ways about it. I know there are plcntj of good hall players to take my
place for Stanford, and 1 sure hope they go places next season."
As to Howie not being able to afford to turn clown such a luscious offer,
1 seriously agree with him. If the blame for turning college athletes to
wards the pro-leagues must be put at somebody's doorstep. I think it
should point at the men who wave those big bundles of greenbacks in the
faces of nice kids like Howie Dallmar. These men realize perfectly well
