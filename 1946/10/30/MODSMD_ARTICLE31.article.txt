sistant Coach Mai Elward put the
J.V. "Greens" through a series of
I Beaver plays that are likely to face
Stanford up at Corvallis this week

j into a long, defensive scrimmage

imitating the Beavers' off-center T
and old-time Z formation plays.
With Buck Brownson, Ainslie

j quarterback spot, three separate of
fensive teams concentrated on fast.

some nice, long passing by Devine
and Bell. On the receiving end of
| some of the better passes were Jack
Eller and Ed Burke, with some fine
; connections good for 30 yards or
more. Jack Crahan and Bob An
j derson also did some pretty heaving
| as Don Zappetini snagged a couple
! in the end zone; fast Jack Eller did
some fancy holding on to short over
j center drops by Bell.


WE MAY NOT GO TO THE ROSE BOWL THIS YEAR... but one of our varsity squads is headed
for a championship. The Indian water polo squad works out in the Encina pool where Jim Armstrong,
