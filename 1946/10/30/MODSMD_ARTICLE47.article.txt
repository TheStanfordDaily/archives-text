Kesslcr, a varsity debater for the
Farm in his undergraduate days,
and a member of the Santa Clara
County Republican Committee, is
slated to speak for the Republican
party. Democratic politics will be
upheld by Malcolm Barrett, debate
squad member.
Details of the forum are organized
by Hal Keely and Len Her/berg of
the AVC; Leland T. Chapin, debate
coach; and Bob Bennett, debate
manager.
