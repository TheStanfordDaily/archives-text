# Fans Awaken For 'Big Sleep'
## 
### 
If you nre tired from tho.se mid
terms and would like to seo .some
one else get heat up for a change,
"The Big Sleep," now playing at the
Stanford Theater, is good, tough de
tective cinema.
Of course there isn't much emo
tion displayed. The story is by
Raymond Chandler, who wrote "The
Blue Dahlia," "The High Window,"
and "Farewell, My Lovely," which
the studio big wheels later turned
into "Murder, My Sweet." Mr.
Chandler does not like anybody
who does not snarl, carry a rod, or
who would not bump off his own
mother for the family jewels.
Added to this is the face of Lau
ren "Baby" Bacall, and her husband
who is named Humphrey Bogart.
They spend most of the picture
looking about as friendly as a ses
sion of the Big Four foreign min
isters, but that only adds to the
slam-bang story.
The story is all about dirty pitch
ers, murders (about three of them)
and in a more general way, love.
Humphrey gets beat up at least once
by a goon squad, and by and large
a generally grisly time is had by all.
If you like that sort of thing, "The
Big Sleep" is good Chandler, good
Bogart, and pretty good Bacall. With
all of them together murder's a
pleasure.—Heintze
