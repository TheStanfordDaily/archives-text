## 
### 
Cardinals in their meeting last
night started the wheels turning on
preparations for the Big Game and
its accompanying festivities. Sign
ups will begin Monday for floats to
be entered in the Big Game parade,
which is held each year just before
the rally and bonfire, which usually
falls on the Thursday before the
game. All living groups are invited
to get up floats and to compete in
the parade for prizes.
The prizes are awarded to floats
in five divisions: fraternities, Wo
men's Row houses, Village, women's
halls, and men's halls. All those
planning to participate in the pa
rade arc urged to sign up their float
ideas and living groups as soon as
i possible.
Cardinals also announced the
transportation arrangements for
the Big Game. All those not wish
ing to drive to the game may go
on a special train which will run
from the Palo Alto station, across
the Dunharton Bridge, to First
and Broadway in Oakland. From
there, students will go by char
tered streetcar to Berkeley. The
trip will take about an hour and a
half, and Stanford students should
be on the Cal campus by noon.
"We must guarantee 600 people
for the trip before we can get the
special train," declared Mel Swift,
Cardinal in charge of the trip. "The
sign-up date will be announced in
| the near future, and the trip will
I cost $1.05."
Milk, cokes, and sandwiches will
| be served in the train's club car.
Since parking facilities are limit
ed at Berkeley, all students are
