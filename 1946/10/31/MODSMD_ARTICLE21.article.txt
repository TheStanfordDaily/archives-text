I (may) be used at indoor or outdoor
| rallies or at any student functions."
Stanford Fire Chief John Mar
[ ston last week recommended to
1 Rally Com that torches be exclud
j ed from rallies in view of the dan
ger they presented to students.
However, torches for the S.C. rally
j last Friday were inspected by the
| Fire Department and approval of
I their use was granted.
Chief Marston is now on his va
: cation. According to Fire Depart
| mont Captain Henry W. Jones no
i inspection was made of the torches
| used last night, However, he said,
i "they are the same construction
| type torches used in all the rallies
Iso far." The torches arc made by

Bonnie Hanson, co-chairman of
Rally Com, stated that Rally Com
I wishes to thank Sher, Madigan, and
| others who kept the fire from sprea
| others who kept the fire from
j spreading by their quick thinking.
