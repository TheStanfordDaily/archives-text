### 
In the passing of Mike Kresge the Stanford
Daily has lost one of its "old guard." His
loyalty and competence will be difficult to
replace.
His death leaves no comforting rationali
zations by which his friends can face the loss.
A very human life and a promising career
have been snapped in an accident that never
should have happened.
As a student, newspaperman, and faculty
member, Mike gave tremendously to his
school and profession. His major study con

cerned making newspaper style more plain
and readable. He did not like wordy display,
in writing or in living.
His excellent writing style was backed by
a regard for scholarship and truth rare in jour
nalism.
We would like to note his passing in a way
that wouldn't violate his own standards. For
a worthwhile person like Mike, we don't
choose to pad out with flowery words our ;
feelings of sympathy for his family, and for
ourselves. —The Stanford Daily.
