To the Editoi.
1 notice by the Stanford Daily of Oct. 24 thai.
University Trustee Paul C. Edwards asks for sug
gestions "for an appropriate University war memo
rial."
1 also note that the Daily suggests that "a suit
able memorial should be in a form that will be CON
TINUOUSLY USEFUL AND BENEFICIAL TO THE
ENTIRE STUDENT BODY."
As a person who has lived in the vicinity of Stan
ford since 1926, had a son who attended Stanford
Univeisity, and is at present an employee of the
Stanford Post Office since Sept. 12, 1943, I have been
able to make some vital observations and I am con
vinc )d that Stanford's greatest need is a NEW POST
OFFICE.
What else on the campus would be more "con
tinuously useful and beneficial to the entire student
body"? I ask.
I understand that a new Union has been sug
ger-Ld, but it seems to me that Stanford has far
out-rown the present Post Office and the need for
a new building is paramount and vital.
The present structure is quite inadequate both
externally from the standpoint of the public and
internally from the standpoint of the employee.
Externally, all one has to do is observe the long,
continuous line at the general delivery, parcel post,
and stamp windows, if one has not been lucky to get
one of the limited number of boxes. Also,*if you
witnessed the crowd at the Post Office at daybreak
a few weeks avo. when the woefully few boxes went
on sale, you would be convinced how far the de
mand exceeded the supply. I understand-some folks
brought their sleeping bags so they would be among
the firft to be the lucky ones when the Post Office
opened. are only some of the external inade
quacies but these are self-evident.
Internally, the present Post Office is not con
ducive to efficiency or service both to the public and
the employees. Because of the quite limited floor
space, it is exceedingly difficult to handle the much
increased parcel post efficiently and the public has
to wait and is inconvenienced while the clerk searches
diligently for the right parcel. Also there has been
an increase in the staff and the employees, believe
it or not, actually rub elbows to get about. Also
the sanitary accommodations are most primitive and
very poorly located for convenience.
I have never heard of a memorial Post Office,
but the Post Office at Stanford being Stanford prop
illy could very easily become a valuable and useful
memorial. I am quite sure if the Stanford public was

asked to consider a new Post Office it would receive
a very unanimous YES vote.
I earnestly suggest you give my plea for a new
Post Ofiiee as an "appropriate University war memo
rial" your serious and active consideration and may
be some day real soon we will be able to renew our
laded hopes for something bigger and better.
Sincerely yours,
Robert D. Collyer
To the Editor:
We would like to voice our opinion on a matter !
which we feel might become a University policy
unless a definite stand is taken. The facts are as
follows:
On Sept. 26* 1946. the Board of Directors of the
Women's Athletic Association approved the sugges
tion that W.A.A. underwrite a concert for $1.0()0 to
be given in February by Charles Weidman. A date
was cleared through Public Exercises and a letter
sent to Dean Stalnaker to obtain University approval.
Orchesis is to sponsor the concert.
A few days ago an answer was received from
Mr. Stalnaker giving the University's approval with
a few minor changes. We quote:
"The Committee on Public Exercises feels that
it would be a splendid thing to go forward with
your plans to present Charles Weidman in a con
cert.
' A few changes will be necessary, however, to
make the program entirely acceptable. It is felt
that the management of the concert should be the
responsibility of the Committee on Public Exer
cises. with Orchesis as the sponsor; in other words,
we to do the work and Orchesis to get the credit
line. Any proceeds from the concert will be de
posited to (he account of the University."
We feel that this is unfair and that if the above
policy is carried out, other student organizations will
receive the same treatment in the future.
It has been publicly announced that Stanford
University has received more endowments in the
last year than any other university in the country.
We're wondering:
1. If it's necessary for profits from student or
ganizations to be taken by the University, when, if
they remained with the organization, they could be :
used to benefit other students; and
2. If a student organization is willing to incur !
expenses and therefore take a chance on loss, is it |
not reasonable that it should also enjoy the profits?
