## BULL SESSION 
### 
Yesterday morning when the subject of a surprise
quiz in Poli Sci was announced, so many people
stood up to leave that it looked as though the band
was playing the Star Spangled Banner. A few Je
hovah's Witnesses remained to take a stab at the test
but the majority scampered for the exits.
It was the greatest self-confessed mass display
of ignorance in the history of American education.
Guess- everyone is just giving up on that $50 prize
for an outstanding- Poli Sci student.

The current discussion on the possibility of Stan
lord's policy on campus queens being changed to
permit the election and subsequent glorification of
these beauteous damsels brings to mind what recent
ly occurred at Colorado U.
The Colorado campus was having an election for
queen of the school and there were so many write-in
votes for Lena the Hyena that it became obvious she
was going to win the election.
So the committee burned all the ballots and
appointed a queen who was not one of the original
candidates. The original beauties then served as the
queen's court.
How about it. girls? Do you think your popu
larity can top Lena's?

One of our local smoothies wanted to make a ter
rific impression on a girl a friend was getting him a
blind dale with. He had heard that the girl had a
few small eccentricities so he had his buddy intro
duce him as a psych major.
The gal has an unusual habit of trying to divide
things evenly by 5. If that doesn't work she tries 3
and then 4 and if it still doesn't tome out even she
is unhappy. Counts her step on the way to class
and things like that. Then if they don't divide evenly
by 3, 4, or 5. it spoils her whole day.
So the girl and our hero and his friend all went
down for a coke at the Cellar together and our boy
was introduced to her as planned. He asked her all
sorts of important-sounding questions about her life,
whether she had insomnia, if she could recall frus
trating incidents from her childhood, and so on.
Really made a terrific impression and she was con
vinced she had really found a man to psycho-ana
lyze her.
He concluded by saying he could learn more if
he had her in a reclining position in a dark room—
at which point his buddy nearly gave the whole gag
away by exploding with laughter.
But when last heard from, the relationship was
continuing nicely and Freud was spinning in his
grave.

He concluded by saying he could learn more if
he had her in a reclining position in a dark room—
at which point his buddy nearly gave the whole gag
away by exploding with laughter.
But when last heard from, the relationship was
continuing nicely and Freud was spinning in his
grave.
Yesterday morning when the subject of a surprise
quiz in Poli Sci was announced, so many people
stood up to leave that it looked as though the band
was playing the Star Spangled Banner. A few Je
hovah's Witnesses remained to take a stab at the test
but the majority scampered for the exits.
It was the greatest self-confessed mass display
of ignorance in the history of American education.
Guess- everyone is just giving up on that $50 prize
for an outstanding- Poli Sci student.

The current discussion on the possibility of Stan
lord's policy on campus queens being changed to
permit the election and subsequent glorification of
these beauteous damsels brings to mind what recent
ly occurred at Colorado U.
The Colorado campus was having an election for
queen of the school and there were so many write-in
votes for Lena the Hyena that it became obvious she
was going to win the election.
So the committee burned all the ballots and
appointed a queen who was not one of the original
candidates. The original beauties then served as the
queen's court.
How about it. girls? Do you think your popu
larity can top Lena's?

One of our local smoothies wanted to make a ter
rific impression on a girl a friend was getting him a
blind dale with. He had heard that the girl had a
few small eccentricities so he had his buddy intro
duce him as a psych major.
The gal has an unusual habit of trying to divide
things evenly by 5. If that doesn't work she tries 3
and then 4 and if it still doesn't tome out even she
is unhappy. Counts her step on the way to class
and things like that. Then if they don't divide evenly
by 3, 4, or 5. it spoils her whole day.
So the girl and our hero and his friend all went
down for a coke at the Cellar together and our boy
was introduced to her as planned. He asked her all
sorts of important-sounding questions about her life,
whether she had insomnia, if she could recall frus
trating incidents from her childhood, and so on.
Really made a terrific impression and she was con
vinced she had really found a man to psycho-ana
lyze her.
He concluded by saying he could learn more if
he had her in a reclining position in a dark room—
at which point his buddy nearly gave the whole gag
away by exploding with laughter.
