I met a guy the other day who thought he was being very witty about
the whole thing. "Do you think Stanford will ever win another game?"
he asked, very very pleased with himself. He was a big fellow, bigger
than a lot or even most of the guys on the squad. But somebody once told
him his face was his fortune, and lie swallowed it—hook, line, etc. Not
him, he wasn't going to get his profile messed up like the other guys do
every Saturday. Besides, he hasn't the "mental temperament" to play
lootball. So I told him: "The only difference between you and a baboon
is that a baboon has a green nose. And I'm not so sure it wouldn't look
better on you." Then 1 ran.
Do I think Stanford will ever win any more football games? Sure I
do. There isn't any reason wh> they shouldn't win five more this season,
unless the five teams thev meet (Oregon State, Washington, Washing
ton State, Cal and Hawaii) get awfully good between now and the day
we play them.
The last time the Farm journeyed to Corvallis to tussle with the Bea
vers, a guy named Martin Chaves took the Indians apart singlehanded in
a sea of mud. In case you didn't know, Chaves and eight more of his
pals from that 1941 squad are playing again for Lon Stiner this season.
It's raining in Corvallis again this week: I have it on indisputable proof,
arid it will be raining again this Saturday. How do I know? Marty Feld
man told me. He said his back's aching—so it's sure to rain there '
Saturday.
Let it rain, that's all I gotta say. let it rain. And the deeper it gets on
(he field, the better our bov Bobby Anderson will like the going. Boy,
will the w rite-i'or-pay boys in The City have a field day if NCAA 50-
yard freestyle champ Anderson really moves in the sea of mud. And an
amphibious gent like the Wioth.v redhead should be worth his weight in
gold on the kind of field the Aggies call home.
What kind of a team are the Beavers? They're good, they're very good ;
—on their own ground. They played UCLA in the Coliseum in the open
ing game of the season. They lost, 50-7, in a game that was marked by ;
one team getting every break in the books. The temperature was over
90 on the floor of the stadium; nothing, not a single thing the Beavers 1
tried would work; and nothing the Bruins tried wouldn't work. Just one |
of those things. But the Bevos came back, and hold a (J-0 win over El
Trojan and a 13-12 verdict over Washington State.
The reports from Portland pegged the Aggies as a good big team after
their reversal of USC. and their close call with the Cougars can be put
clown to the game being played at Pullman (ugh) and to a sudden awak
ening of WSC. Eut, the Aggies can be had, and will be had as Saturday's
score should show.
After ihe OSC outfit has been dealt with satisfactorily (don't quote
me), the Cards should have a comparatively easier time against the two
"Scourges of the North." The Huskies have been a puzzle all year. Are
they as good as they appear on one Saturday, or as poor as they appear
on the next? St. Mary's (whom Stanford hasn't played in 1!) years) came
from a long way behind to nip the Huskies, 24-20. in the opener at Seat- i
tie, and everybody came hack and said that Washington was a terrific
team. So what happens?
The next week, the Uclans go north and all but chase the Huskies
clean on up to the Canadian border. 39-13, that one was and the best
crack of the day was that "the only mistake Washington made was in |
showing up." But Pest Welch's outfit bounced back and slapped WSC
down 21-7 the next week. Then, the Huskies went south to L.A. to wras- j
sle the Trojans and receipted for a 28-0 shellacking. Last week they played
host to Cal and were pegged to lose by odds of 1-2. Yep, that's right; the
Berkeley Bear made the magnificent total of one yard by rushing from
scrimmage and gathered in another 20-6 defeat.
'I his Saturday, the Huskies have an open date (which they should
win) and then head south for the Farm. By the time they get here, they
should really he in fine shape. They will he, too, Arnie Weinmeister
(Washington's answer to fullback Lloyd Merriman) is back after being
gone for a month, and unless they want to ruin a good thing they'll he
in line fettle. It seems that there is something in the air about here that
is marvelous in causing injured football players from foreign fields to
recuperate in a hurry. Everybody's in top shape when they play here
—everybody hut Stanford.
As for the Cougars, all they have is Billy Lippencott and a lotta nerve, j
and Lippencott just got back in shape after having been out for quite ;
some time. The Cougars have beaten only Idaho (32-0) and have a score
less tie on the books with Oregon that they gained in the mud at Eugene.
Ore. Oregon, by the way, is the only major conference team Stanford !
doesn't play this season—and if they do things to USC at the Coliseum
this Saturday and to UCLA at Portland next week, Tex Oliver will have
a Rose Bowl team in his last year at the U. of O. To get back to the
Cougars, they invade Berkeley this week-end, and if they lose I'm gonna !
take a week off. (Maybe I oughta take a week off anyway.)
If I hadn't seen California's entry in the conference last year, I'd say
(hat this year's club was the greatest thing of all time—for futility. It
seems that if a university of some 20.000 souls can't find at least eleven
men who can play football, they ought to give up. Oh sure, I know they
heat St. Mary's and broke Cal Rossi's leg and held UCLA to 1 .*»-(». And
I say. "So What!" How are they going to avoid being drawn and quar
tered liv the Cougars. Trojans and Beavers? And after that they play
Stanford,
Don't worry, they'll give us a fight. If they didn't play but one game
;i year and that against Stanford, they'd put on the greatest show of all
time. No matter how bad they are, they still play good against the j
Indians.
Just how bad they are is yet to be seen. Against Wisconsin, they
gained 34 yards, against UCLA 24. and one against Washington. All in all |

Id say that was about the worst of
fense in the whole country, and that
includes CCNY. But you can bet
the family heirlooms they'll go
against us. The offense will click
like the cylinders in a Cadillac and
the defense will be something tre
mendous. They'll develop a (lock of
passers and runners and kickers and
their rooting section will be as
nasty as il ever was. And they'll be
tough to beat.
Me? I pick Stanford to win by
.'!() points. If Cal wins all its re
maining games, and Stanford
loses all i(s remaining games, I'll
slill pick Stanford to win—by 2!>
points.

The reports from Portland pegged the Aggies as a good big team after
their reversal of USC. and their close call with the Cougars can be put
clown to the game being played at Pullman (ugh) and to a sudden awak
ening of WSC. Eut, the Aggies can be had, and will be had as Saturday's
score should show.
After ihe OSC outfit has been dealt with satisfactorily (don't quote
me), the Cards should have a comparatively easier time against the two
"Scourges of the North." The Huskies have been a puzzle all year. Are
they as good as they appear on one Saturday, or as poor as they appear
on the next? St. Mary's (whom Stanford hasn't played in 1!) years) came
from a long way behind to nip the Huskies, 24-20. in the opener at Seat- i
tie, and everybody came hack and said that Washington was a terrific
team. So what happens?
The next week, the Uclans go north and all but chase the Huskies
clean on up to the Canadian border. 39-13, that one was and the best
crack of the day was that "the only mistake Washington made was in |
showing up." But Pest Welch's outfit bounced back and slapped WSC
down 21-7 the next week. Then, the Huskies went south to L.A. to wras- j
sle the Trojans and receipted for a 28-0 shellacking. Last week they played
host to Cal and were pegged to lose by odds of 1-2. Yep, that's right; the
Berkeley Bear made the magnificent total of one yard by rushing from
scrimmage and gathered in another 20-6 defeat.
'I his Saturday, the Huskies have an open date (which they should
win) and then head south for the Farm. By the time they get here, they
should really he in fine shape. They will he, too, Arnie Weinmeister
(Washington's answer to fullback Lloyd Merriman) is back after being
gone for a month, and unless they want to ruin a good thing they'll he
in line fettle. It seems that there is something in the air about here that
is marvelous in causing injured football players from foreign fields to
recuperate in a hurry. Everybody's in top shape when they play here
—everybody hut Stanford.
As for the Cougars, all they have is Billy Lippencott and a lotta nerve, j
and Lippencott just got back in shape after having been out for quite ;
some time. The Cougars have beaten only Idaho (32-0) and have a score
less tie on the books with Oregon that they gained in the mud at Eugene.
Ore. Oregon, by the way, is the only major conference team Stanford !
doesn't play this season—and if they do things to USC at the Coliseum
this Saturday and to UCLA at Portland next week, Tex Oliver will have
a Rose Bowl team in his last year at the U. of O. To get back to the
Cougars, they invade Berkeley this week-end, and if they lose I'm gonna !
take a week off. (Maybe I oughta take a week off anyway.)
If I hadn't seen California's entry in the conference last year, I'd say
(hat this year's club was the greatest thing of all time—for futility. It
seems that if a university of some 20.000 souls can't find at least eleven
men who can play football, they ought to give up. Oh sure, I know they
heat St. Mary's and broke Cal Rossi's leg and held UCLA to 1 .*»-(». And
I say. "So What!" How are they going to avoid being drawn and quar
tered liv the Cougars. Trojans and Beavers? And after that they play
Stanford,
Don't worry, they'll give us a fight. If they didn't play but one game
;i year and that against Stanford, they'd put on the greatest show of all
time. No matter how bad they are, they still play good against the j
Indians.
Just how bad they are is yet to be seen. Against Wisconsin, they
gained 34 yards, against UCLA 24. and one against Washington. All in all |

Id say that was about the worst of
fense in the whole country, and that
includes CCNY. But you can bet
the family heirlooms they'll go
against us. The offense will click
like the cylinders in a Cadillac and
the defense will be something tre
mendous. They'll develop a (lock of
passers and runners and kickers and
their rooting section will be as
nasty as il ever was. And they'll be
tough to beat.
Me? I pick Stanford to win by
.'!() points. If Cal wins all its re
maining games, and Stanford
loses all i(s remaining games, I'll
slill pick Stanford to win—by 2!>
points.
I met a guy the other day who thought he was being very witty about
the whole thing. "Do you think Stanford will ever win another game?"
he asked, very very pleased with himself. He was a big fellow, bigger
than a lot or even most of the guys on the squad. But somebody once told
him his face was his fortune, and lie swallowed it—hook, line, etc. Not
him, he wasn't going to get his profile messed up like the other guys do
every Saturday. Besides, he hasn't the "mental temperament" to play
lootball. So I told him: "The only difference between you and a baboon
is that a baboon has a green nose. And I'm not so sure it wouldn't look
better on you." Then 1 ran.
Do I think Stanford will ever win any more football games? Sure I
do. There isn't any reason wh> they shouldn't win five more this season,
unless the five teams thev meet (Oregon State, Washington, Washing
ton State, Cal and Hawaii) get awfully good between now and the day
we play them.
The last time the Farm journeyed to Corvallis to tussle with the Bea
vers, a guy named Martin Chaves took the Indians apart singlehanded in
a sea of mud. In case you didn't know, Chaves and eight more of his
pals from that 1941 squad are playing again for Lon Stiner this season.
It's raining in Corvallis again this week: I have it on indisputable proof,
arid it will be raining again this Saturday. How do I know? Marty Feld
man told me. He said his back's aching—so it's sure to rain there '
Saturday.
Let it rain, that's all I gotta say. let it rain. And the deeper it gets on
(he field, the better our bov Bobby Anderson will like the going. Boy,
will the w rite-i'or-pay boys in The City have a field day if NCAA 50-
yard freestyle champ Anderson really moves in the sea of mud. And an
amphibious gent like the Wioth.v redhead should be worth his weight in
gold on the kind of field the Aggies call home.
What kind of a team are the Beavers? They're good, they're very good ;
—on their own ground. They played UCLA in the Coliseum in the open
ing game of the season. They lost, 50-7, in a game that was marked by ;
one team getting every break in the books. The temperature was over
90 on the floor of the stadium; nothing, not a single thing the Beavers 1
tried would work; and nothing the Bruins tried wouldn't work. Just one |
of those things. But the Bevos came back, and hold a (J-0 win over El

doesn't play this season—and if they do things to USC at the Coliseum
this Saturday and to UCLA at Portland next week, Tex Oliver will have
a Rose Bowl team in his last year at the U. of O. To get back to the
Cougars, they invade Berkeley this week-end, and if they lose I'm gonna !
take a week off. (Maybe I oughta take a week off anyway.)
If I hadn't seen California's entry in the conference last year, I'd say
(hat this year's club was the greatest thing of all time—for futility. It
seems that if a university of some 20.000 souls can't find at least eleven
men who can play football, they ought to give up. Oh sure, I know they
heat St. Mary's and broke Cal Rossi's leg and held UCLA to 1 .*»-(». And
I say. "So What!" How are they going to avoid being drawn and quar
tered liv the Cougars. Trojans and Beavers? And after that they play
Stanford,
Don't worry, they'll give us a fight. If they didn't play but one game
;i year and that against Stanford, they'd put on the greatest show of all
time. No matter how bad they are, they still play good against the j
Indians.
Just how bad they are is yet to be seen. Against Wisconsin, they
gained 34 yards, against UCLA 24. and one against Washington. All in all |

Id say that was about the worst of
fense in the whole country, and that
includes CCNY. But you can bet
the family heirlooms they'll go
against us. The offense will click
like the cylinders in a Cadillac and
the defense will be something tre
mendous. They'll develop a (lock of
passers and runners and kickers and
their rooting section will be as
nasty as il ever was. And they'll be
tough to beat.
Me? I pick Stanford to win by
.'!() points. If Cal wins all its re
maining games, and Stanford
loses all i(s remaining games, I'll
slill pick Stanford to win—by 2!>
points.
I met a guy the other day who thought he was being very witty about
the whole thing. "Do you think Stanford will ever win another game?"
he asked, very very pleased with himself. He was a big fellow, bigger
than a lot or even most of the guys on the squad. But somebody once told
him his face was his fortune, and lie swallowed it—hook, line, etc. Not
him, he wasn't going to get his profile messed up like the other guys do
every Saturday. Besides, he hasn't the "mental temperament" to play
lootball. So I told him: "The only difference between you and a baboon
is that a baboon has a green nose. And I'm not so sure it wouldn't look
better on you." Then 1 ran.
Do I think Stanford will ever win any more football games? Sure I
do. There isn't any reason wh> they shouldn't win five more this season,
unless the five teams thev meet (Oregon State, Washington, Washing
ton State, Cal and Hawaii) get awfully good between now and the day
we play them.
The last time the Farm journeyed to Corvallis to tussle with the Bea
vers, a guy named Martin Chaves took the Indians apart singlehanded in
a sea of mud. In case you didn't know, Chaves and eight more of his
pals from that 1941 squad are playing again for Lon Stiner this season.
It's raining in Corvallis again this week: I have it on indisputable proof,
arid it will be raining again this Saturday. How do I know? Marty Feld
man told me. He said his back's aching—so it's sure to rain there '
Saturday.
Let it rain, that's all I gotta say. let it rain. And the deeper it gets on
(he field, the better our bov Bobby Anderson will like the going. Boy,
will the w rite-i'or-pay boys in The City have a field day if NCAA 50-
yard freestyle champ Anderson really moves in the sea of mud. And an
amphibious gent like the Wioth.v redhead should be worth his weight in
gold on the kind of field the Aggies call home.
What kind of a team are the Beavers? They're good, they're very good ;
—on their own ground. They played UCLA in the Coliseum in the open
ing game of the season. They lost, 50-7, in a game that was marked by ;
one team getting every break in the books. The temperature was over
90 on the floor of the stadium; nothing, not a single thing the Beavers 1
tried would work; and nothing the Bruins tried wouldn't work. Just one |
of those things. But the Bevos came back, and hold a (J-0 win over El
Trojan and a 13-12 verdict over Washington State.
The reports from Portland pegged the Aggies as a good big team after
their reversal of USC. and their close call with the Cougars can be put
clown to the game being played at Pullman (ugh) and to a sudden awak
ening of WSC. Eut, the Aggies can be had, and will be had as Saturday's
score should show.
After ihe OSC outfit has been dealt with satisfactorily (don't quote
me), the Cards should have a comparatively easier time against the two
"Scourges of the North." The Huskies have been a puzzle all year. Are
they as good as they appear on one Saturday, or as poor as they appear
on the next? St. Mary's (whom Stanford hasn't played in 1!) years) came
from a long way behind to nip the Huskies, 24-20. in the opener at Seat- i
tie, and everybody came hack and said that Washington was a terrific
team. So what happens?
The next week, the Uclans go north and all but chase the Huskies
clean on up to the Canadian border. 39-13, that one was and the best
crack of the day was that "the only mistake Washington made was in |
showing up." But Pest Welch's outfit bounced back and slapped WSC
down 21-7 the next week. Then, the Huskies went south to L.A. to wras- j
sle the Trojans and receipted for a 28-0 shellacking. Last week they played
host to Cal and were pegged to lose by odds of 1-2. Yep, that's right; the
Berkeley Bear made the magnificent total of one yard by rushing from
scrimmage and gathered in another 20-6 defeat.
'I his Saturday, the Huskies have an open date (which they should
win) and then head south for the Farm. By the time they get here, they
should really he in fine shape. They will he, too, Arnie Weinmeister
(Washington's answer to fullback Lloyd Merriman) is back after being
gone for a month, and unless they want to ruin a good thing they'll he
in line fettle. It seems that there is something in the air about here that
is marvelous in causing injured football players from foreign fields to
recuperate in a hurry. Everybody's in top shape when they play here
—everybody hut Stanford.
As for the Cougars, all they have is Billy Lippencott and a lotta nerve, j
and Lippencott just got back in shape after having been out for quite ;
some time. The Cougars have beaten only Idaho (32-0) and have a score
less tie on the books with Oregon that they gained in the mud at Eugene.

lootball. So I told him: "The only difference between you and a baboon
is that a baboon has a green nose. And I'm not so sure it wouldn't look
better on you." Then 1 ran.
Do I think Stanford will ever win any more football games? Sure I
do. There isn't any reason wh> they shouldn't win five more this season,
unless the five teams thev meet (Oregon State, Washington, Washing
ton State, Cal and Hawaii) get awfully good between now and the day
we play them.
The last time the Farm journeyed to Corvallis to tussle with the Bea
vers, a guy named Martin Chaves took the Indians apart singlehanded in
a sea of mud. In case you didn't know, Chaves and eight more of his
pals from that 1941 squad are playing again for Lon Stiner this season.
It's raining in Corvallis again this week: I have it on indisputable proof,
arid it will be raining again this Saturday. How do I know? Marty Feld
man told me. He said his back's aching—so it's sure to rain there '
Saturday.
Let it rain, that's all I gotta say. let it rain. And the deeper it gets on
(he field, the better our bov Bobby Anderson will like the going. Boy,
will the w rite-i'or-pay boys in The City have a field day if NCAA 50-
yard freestyle champ Anderson really moves in the sea of mud. And an
amphibious gent like the Wioth.v redhead should be worth his weight in
gold on the kind of field the Aggies call home.
What kind of a team are the Beavers? They're good, they're very good ;
—on their own ground. They played UCLA in the Coliseum in the open
ing game of the season. They lost, 50-7, in a game that was marked by ;
one team getting every break in the books. The temperature was over
90 on the floor of the stadium; nothing, not a single thing the Beavers 1
tried would work; and nothing the Bruins tried wouldn't work. Just one |
of those things. But the Bevos came back, and hold a (J-0 win over El
Trojan and a 13-12 verdict over Washington State.
The reports from Portland pegged the Aggies as a good big team after
their reversal of USC. and their close call with the Cougars can be put
clown to the game being played at Pullman (ugh) and to a sudden awak
ening of WSC. Eut, the Aggies can be had, and will be had as Saturday's
score should show.
After ihe OSC outfit has been dealt with satisfactorily (don't quote
me), the Cards should have a comparatively easier time against the two
"Scourges of the North." The Huskies have been a puzzle all year. Are
they as good as they appear on one Saturday, or as poor as they appear
on the next? St. Mary's (whom Stanford hasn't played in 1!) years) came
from a long way behind to nip the Huskies, 24-20. in the opener at Seat- i
tie, and everybody came hack and said that Washington was a terrific
team. So what happens?
The next week, the Uclans go north and all but chase the Huskies
clean on up to the Canadian border. 39-13, that one was and the best
crack of the day was that "the only mistake Washington made was in |
showing up." But Pest Welch's outfit bounced back and slapped WSC
down 21-7 the next week. Then, the Huskies went south to L.A. to wras- j
sle the Trojans and receipted for a 28-0 shellacking. Last week they played
host to Cal and were pegged to lose by odds of 1-2. Yep, that's right; the
Berkeley Bear made the magnificent total of one yard by rushing from
scrimmage and gathered in another 20-6 defeat.
'I his Saturday, the Huskies have an open date (which they should
win) and then head south for the Farm. By the time they get here, they
should really he in fine shape. They will he, too, Arnie Weinmeister
(Washington's answer to fullback Lloyd Merriman) is back after being
gone for a month, and unless they want to ruin a good thing they'll he
in line fettle. It seems that there is something in the air about here that
is marvelous in causing injured football players from foreign fields to
recuperate in a hurry. Everybody's in top shape when they play here
—everybody hut Stanford.
As for the Cougars, all they have is Billy Lippencott and a lotta nerve, j
and Lippencott just got back in shape after having been out for quite ;
some time. The Cougars have beaten only Idaho (32-0) and have a score
less tie on the books with Oregon that they gained in the mud at Eugene.
Ore. Oregon, by the way, is the only major conference team Stanford !
doesn't play this season—and if they do things to USC at the Coliseum
this Saturday and to UCLA at Portland next week, Tex Oliver will have
a Rose Bowl team in his last year at the U. of O. To get back to the
Cougars, they invade Berkeley this week-end, and if they lose I'm gonna !
take a week off. (Maybe I oughta take a week off anyway.)
If I hadn't seen California's entry in the conference last year, I'd say
(hat this year's club was the greatest thing of all time—for futility. It
seems that if a university of some 20.000 souls can't find at least eleven
men who can play football, they ought to give up. Oh sure, I know they
heat St. Mary's and broke Cal Rossi's leg and held UCLA to 1 .*»-(». And
I say. "So What!" How are they going to avoid being drawn and quar
tered liv the Cougars. Trojans and Beavers? And after that they play
Stanford,
Don't worry, they'll give us a fight. If they didn't play but one game
;i year and that against Stanford, they'd put on the greatest show of all
time. No matter how bad they are, they still play good against the j
Indians.
Just how bad they are is yet to be seen. Against Wisconsin, they
gained 34 yards, against UCLA 24. and one against Washington. All in all |

Id say that was about the worst of
fense in the whole country, and that
includes CCNY. But you can bet
the family heirlooms they'll go
against us. The offense will click
like the cylinders in a Cadillac and
the defense will be something tre
mendous. They'll develop a (lock of
passers and runners and kickers and
their rooting section will be as
nasty as il ever was. And they'll be
tough to beat.
Me? I pick Stanford to win by
.'!() points. If Cal wins all its re
maining games, and Stanford
loses all i(s remaining games, I'll
slill pick Stanford to win—by 2!>
points.
I met a guy the other day who thought he was being very witty about
the whole thing. "Do you think Stanford will ever win another game?"
he asked, very very pleased with himself. He was a big fellow, bigger
than a lot or even most of the guys on the squad. But somebody once told
him his face was his fortune, and lie swallowed it—hook, line, etc. Not
him, he wasn't going to get his profile messed up like the other guys do
every Saturday. Besides, he hasn't the "mental temperament" to play
lootball. So I told him: "The only difference between you and a baboon
is that a baboon has a green nose. And I'm not so sure it wouldn't look
