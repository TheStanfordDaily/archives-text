# Card Jayvees Drill For Friday Scrum
## 
### 
While Marchie Schwartz pilots
his Big Red Machine up to Cor
vallis to lace the dangerous O.S.C.
Beavers, Coach Ed' Stamm's jayvees
step into the Farm football spotlight
Friday afternoon with a game
scrimmage against the varsity stay
at-homes.
The scrimmage, the only football
fare on campus this week-end, is
slated for 4 p.m. on the varsity
practice field. A capacity crowd of
football enthusiasts, unable to make
the trip north, is expected to jam
the practice field stands.
Stamm's jayvees came out of the
S.C. game with no serious injuries,
and a minimum of pore muscles and
minor bruises. The little Cards will
probably b-> at full strength for the
first time this year when they travel
up to Davis on November ?) for a
game with the strong Cal Aggies.
Stamm and his assistants, Lin
Wolfe and Bob Crane are more than
pleased over the Indians' victory
over th â–  favored Trobabes. Stamm
summed things up by saying, "The
boys played heads-up ball, and their
spirit was something to be proud
of."
