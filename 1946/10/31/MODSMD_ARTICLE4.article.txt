# Controls Go Off on Shoes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 30 (UP).â€”
The administration killed all price
controls on shoes, leather, hides and
skins tonight in a surprise order
that promised to add millions of dol
lars to the nation's $2,000,000,000
annual shoe bill.
Reconversion Director John R.
Steelman announced the move from
the White House, linking it with
President Truman's recent directive
decontrolling livestock prices.
Steelman said his order would be
come effective immediately, but
OPA Chief Paul Porter announced
that it would be operative at 12:10
a.m., 'EST, Thursday.
The surprise nature of the Steel
man order was indicated by the fact
that the shoe and leather industries
have made no application for de
control.
OPA itself granted a nine per cent
price increase in domestically tan
ned calfskins only last night, sug
gesting that the agency was una
ware of the impending decontrol
order.
