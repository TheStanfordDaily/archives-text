# Upsets Due This Week
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. 30 (UP).
—This is (he week til the underdog.
High-scoring St. Mary's Gaels
are a two-touchdown underdog in
their battle against favored UCLA.
California is a slight favorite to
defeat Washington State in their
j "battle over nothing."
Twice-beaten USC is the people's
choice to down undefeated Univer
j sity of Oregon.
Stanford, beaten by USC. is fa
vored to whip Oregon Slate, a
club which turned back the same
USC.
Idaho, which hasn't won a battle
all year, is expected to taste victory
at the expense of Montana.
All this makes room for the dang
dest bunch of upsets in West Coast
gridiron history—and if it comes
about, it will be no surprise to the
harassed bookies. They've been
taking it on the chin all season.
Why the odds should be so long
—and so many points offered—on
these games doesn't show in the
statistics.
California, with the weakest at
tack in the West, is • rated a six
points better than WSC. The Bears
netted exactly one yard in their last
outtng as they took a 20-G drubbing
from Washington. Against Wiscon
sin they made 34, and against UCLA
24.
Coach Frank Wickhorst's team
has won one, lost four; Washington
State has won over Idaho, tied with
undefeated Oregon and lost to USC
(13-7), and Oregon State (13-12) —
proving that it puts up a good bat
tle with the best of them.
St. Mary's Gaels potentially have
one of the highest scoring teams in
the country. They do not have the
line to cope with the big UCLA out
fit, but it is a good chance that if
the Bruins score four touchdowns,
the Gaels will collect at least three.
In winning five in a row, UCLA has
scored lfil points to 39 for the oppo
sition. St. Mary's has counted 156
in winning four and losing one,
against 54 for the opposition.
Stanford admittedly is one of
the finest teams in the West to
watch in action—but while look
ing nice, the Indians have dropped
two, won three games. On the
other hand. Oregon State, after a
terrific walloping in their opener
at the hands of UCLA, lias won its
last three in a row.
How the odds-makers pick 'em is
a mystery.
But the fact, remains that this Sat
urday could prove a great day for
the underdogs.

the finest teams in the West to
watch in action—but while look
ing nice, the Indians have dropped
two, won three games. On the
other hand. Oregon State, after a
terrific walloping in their opener
at the hands of UCLA, lias won its
last three in a row.
How the odds-makers pick 'em is
a mystery.
But the fact, remains that this Sat

SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. 30 (UP).
—This is (he week til the underdog.
High-scoring St. Mary's Gaels
are a two-touchdown underdog in
their battle against favored UCLA.
California is a slight favorite to
defeat Washington State in their
j "battle over nothing."
Twice-beaten USC is the people's
choice to down undefeated Univer
j sity of Oregon.
Stanford, beaten by USC. is fa
vored to whip Oregon Slate, a
club which turned back the same
USC.
Idaho, which hasn't won a battle
all year, is expected to taste victory
at the expense of Montana.
All this makes room for the dang
dest bunch of upsets in West Coast
gridiron history—and if it comes
about, it will be no surprise to the
harassed bookies. They've been
taking it on the chin all season.
Why the odds should be so long
—and so many points offered—on
these games doesn't show in the
statistics.
California, with the weakest at
tack in the West, is • rated a six
points better than WSC. The Bears
netted exactly one yard in their last
outtng as they took a 20-G drubbing
from Washington. Against Wiscon
sin they made 34, and against UCLA
24.
Coach Frank Wickhorst's team
has won one, lost four; Washington
State has won over Idaho, tied with
undefeated Oregon and lost to USC
(13-7), and Oregon State (13-12) —
proving that it puts up a good bat
tle with the best of them.
St. Mary's Gaels potentially have
one of the highest scoring teams in
the country. They do not have the
line to cope with the big UCLA out
fit, but it is a good chance that if
the Bruins score four touchdowns,
the Gaels will collect at least three.
In winning five in a row, UCLA has
scored lfil points to 39 for the oppo
sition. St. Mary's has counted 156
in winning four and losing one,
against 54 for the opposition.
Stanford admittedly is one of
the finest teams in the West to
watch in action—but while look
