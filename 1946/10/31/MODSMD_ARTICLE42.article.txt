# League-Leading Cardinals Battle Berkeley Watermen
## 
### 
California's "up and down" water poloists will visit the Farm
Saturday morning in an attempt to halt the Indian dash to the
Coast Conference bunting. In meeting the Bears, the confident
Stanford splashers will be facing their most important hurdle
thus far in the season. The crucial battle is slated for 10 o'clock
in the Encina pool.

With a pair of easy victories over
U.S.C. and one at the expense of the
U.C.L.A. Bruins, the Indians are
resting upon the top of the Con
ference heap. Only threat to Stan
lord's undisputed championship sta
tus is the pesky Bear entry, which
boasts a win in its only league game.
And with a return match scheduled
for Berkeley on Big Game weekend,
California could conceivably break
th-j bubble of Stanford invincibility
and end up with the championship.
But comparative scores against
U.S.C. and the Olympic Club point
toward an Indian victory Saturday.
While the league - leading Indians
disposed of the Trojans with a min
imum of effort, 12-6, the battling
Californians fought desperately to
squeeze out an exciting 6-5 win over
U.S.C. Also, in matches with the
seasoned Olympic Club mermen,
Stanford emerged with the more im
pressive record. In a tight contest
which could have gone either way,
the Indians dropped a thrilling 9-10
verdict to the Clubbers. California
did the Indians one better by out
lasting the Olympic Club in an
other one-point decision, but in a
return match the Bears fell com
pletely apart in losing a 1-19 de
bacle.
Thus the unpredictable Bears will
probably cause Stanford fans some
anxious moments this Saturday.
Word from the Berkeley campus is
that California will be at top physi
cal trim for the important meeting.
Led by Captain Stan Morketter, who
copped third position in the A.A.U.
sprint finals last year, California is
expected to furnish local fans with
one of the best games of the season.
