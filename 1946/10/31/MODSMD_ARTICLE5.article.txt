SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 30 (UP).
The Committee for Maritime Un
ity told striking longshoremen and
licensed engineers today to prepare
for a winter-long strike along the
West Coast.
In one of the most ominous state
ments yet made in the month-long
walkout, the CMU said the two
striking unions -the CIO Marine
i Engineers and the CIO Internation
al Longshoremen's and Warehouse
men's Unionâ€”were settling down
for a struggle into next year.
