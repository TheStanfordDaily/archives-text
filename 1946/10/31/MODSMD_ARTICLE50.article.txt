### AL MUNK 
Stanfords varsity footballers held their last practice on home
territory yesterday afternoon as Coach Marchie Schwartz sent
the squad through a well-rounded scrimmage. Early this after
noon the 36-man Indian squad leaves Palo Alto hellbent for
Corvallis where they will face the Oregon State College Bea
vers Saturday afternoon.

After opening calisthenics, the 4
squad split up into offensive block
ing and defensive charging groups
lis the Jayvee "Greens" again simu
lated O.S.C. plays for the benefit of
the charging lines. Quarterbacks
Devine, Bell, and Brownson did
some signal calling.
On passing plays Aubrey Devine
and Ainslie Bell did some of the
best heaving seen for a long time
as Wayne Erickson and Don Zap
patini showed up on the receiv
ing end. In running scrimmage
against a dummy reinforced line it
was Bobby Anderson, Lloyd Merri
man, and Mike Titus who did the
honors for the afternoon.
On the whole, th-s team did not
give the impression that they were
particularly afraid of the Beaver
game next Saturday, as the practice
mood was spirited but with a show
of clear confidence. For a change
the passing seemed to be accurate
and to the point of receiver, -while
the blocking for the runners' was
well timed and showed some good
close interference running.
Protection Kr punting and the
blocking of opponents' puns were
the last two items on the afternoon's
menu for the varsity gridders as the J
week's practice on the Farm closed.
Inasmuch as the starting line-up
against the Oregon State Beavers is
concerned, Marchie intends starting 1
about the same team that initiated
action against the Trojans in last j
Saturday's battle, and it should |
prove to be a satisfactory starting i
line-up for the game in the north.
