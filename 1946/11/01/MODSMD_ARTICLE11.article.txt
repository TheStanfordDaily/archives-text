# Big Red Grid Machine Favored In Saturday's Battle At Corvallis
## Madigan Leads Cards 
### AL MUNK 
The gears in the Big Red ma
chine's transmission should be
meshing again tomorrow.
According to dopesters in the
City, the Injuns should have enough
j strength to shift the gear lever from
last week's reverse position into a
new forward speed. Though the
OSC Beavers bested the Trojans
from USC earlier in the season, and
the visitors from Los Angeles took
unfair advantage of our Farm hos
pitality last week-end, Stanford's
I varsity gridders roll into the Cor

favorites to down the Oregon State
team.
Indian mentor Marchie Schwartz
and iiis 36-man squad boarded the
j Cascade at 3 o'clock yesterday af
ternoon to travel north for the
eighteen Ih game of the OSC-
Stanford rivalry.
The first. 17 games were played
j over a period of 27 years, starting
! in 1919, and statistics show that the
i Indians won 13 of the tussles, tied
j one, and permitted the Orange and
Black to walk off the field victors in
three starts, including the '41 Ore

I During all those years Stanford rati

the one that dropped a 6-0 decision
to the Beavers. Traditionally slow
starting, Southern California hadn't,
played real football until they roll
ed down Palm Drive last Saturday,
and that accounts for the mix-up in
! the odds.
Oregon State will be Stanford's
; first conference opponent that docs
not operate from a routine T forma
tion most of the time. The Beaver
j team likes to employ an off-center
Z formation of the type that Cali
fornia's Stub Allison used to call a
j "short punt formation." Working
■out of this single-wing off-balance
formation, the OSC team is strong
, on pass offensive because they have
the services of a right-handed left
j halfback and a left-handed right,
! halfback.
The ground rushing attack,
Stanford's steady standby during
the season so far, will probably be
Marchie's faithful point gainer,
but it is possible that the Indian
air attack will blossom out this
week-end. Stanford's ability to
take to the air for points has been
