The vaccine, wliieli provides tem
porary immunity to specific types
of influenza, has been developed to
a high peak of efficacy, according to
Dr. George 11. Ilouck, Health Serv
ice head.
Used by the Army during the war,
the vaccine provides protection sev
en to eight days after Ihe single
injection. Immunity lasts from four
or five months to a year.
Dr. Houck emphasizes that the
vaccine is effective only against "A"
and "B" type influenza but that
these types include 90 per cent of
the cases developed between great
epidemics. Students with asthma,
severe hay fever, or known sensi
tivity to chicken eggs are warned
not to take the immunization.
Reaction to the immunization is
of the same frequency and severity
as that to typhoid vaccine. At the
most this entails a mild case of in
fluenza.
