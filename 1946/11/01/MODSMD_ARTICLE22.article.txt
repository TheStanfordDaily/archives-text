## The 						Freedom to Think 
### 
Being an educational institution, Stanford
and its teaching methods will naturally be
under constant examination by its students, its
fellow universities, and thinking people
throughout the nation. The students them
selves should be most deeply concerned, yet
Ihey are rarely heard effectively because the
majority are not aware until after graduation
of any deficiency in their preparedness for a
life in a complex "world outside." However,
this year a significant portion of returned stu
dents have commented on the fact that the
educational plan at Stanford and at most places
in the nation, does not provide the essentials
which will turn out people who know how to
think.
Facts are no good without an understand
ing of how to use them. Decisions are shakily
made without a clear picture of alternative ac
tions and probable effects. Students need a
guiding hand; under the present system it has
been shown that students on their own at Stan
ford don't know where they're going.
Dynamic education, not static training, is
what a university must provide to its students
as potential or actual citizens in a free society.
Through their formative years, there must be
discipline and guidance whiqh will impress
upon students their importance as individuals
individuals who must be responsible in a
democracy for their private and social actions.
Students must be given an indoctrination to the
culture, the method of thinking, which has
brought about and which keeps functioning the
democratic principles dominant in the United
States.
The requisite guidance must be undertaken
by the educational institutions of our nation.
As college freshmen, and high school stu
dents with a hit-or-miss education, young peo
ple presume to know what they want. But their
choice of occupation and the attitudes they
foster are not a result of conscious free choice,
but the result of their willy-nilly contact with
realistic educational experiences.
The anarchy of the present elective system
at Stanford guarantees to no one the well-bal

anced education which will create a free
thinking person. Students take what is easiest,
what vaguely appeals to them as a result of
previous experience, or what is nominally sup
posed to guarantee their competence as
teacher, engineer or chemist.
As yet, the university program has pro
gressed no farther than offering a provocative
course in Western Civilization, a requirement
in English and a foreign language, and an un
disciplined natural and social science elective
requirement.
What is called for is something similar to
the Harvard plan—a two-year course of re
quirements before entrance into specialized
professional or practical training. Require
ments should include a thorough grounding
in history tied to the problems of today; an
understanding of the wheels of our economy
and the alternative economic systems of the
world; a knowledge of physics in our physics
dominated society; a training in English and
the art of expression; training in logic and
semantics, and an over-all philosophy which
will tie education into a comprehensible whole.
This not only involves required studies but a
philosophical inculcation for the professors
which will encourage them to transcend the
boundaries of the specific subjects they teach.
Mechanics for a liberal arts program of this
sort were tentatively suggested last November
by the Consulting Committee on Undergradu
ate Studies. Last spring the- faculty heard a
discussion from Dr. Buck of Harvard, leader in
the investigation which led to that university's
adoption of a plan for general education. His
talk, in urging acceptance of Stanford's report,
was convincing and in our judgment unan
swerable.
Yet the plan has not been accepted by the
faculty or adopted by the University. We think
Stanford is lagging behind the universities of
the East which are already launched, on their
programs; we believe today's generation of
students needs above all things the chance to
learn how to become thoughtful citizens in a
society that is already questioning the worth
of democracy.

semantics, and an over-all philosophy which
will tie education into a comprehensible whole.
This not only involves required studies but a
philosophical inculcation for the professors
which will encourage them to transcend the
boundaries of the specific subjects they teach.
Mechanics for a liberal arts program of this
sort were tentatively suggested last November
by the Consulting Committee on Undergradu
ate Studies. Last spring the- faculty heard a
discussion from Dr. Buck of Harvard, leader in
the investigation which led to that university's
adoption of a plan for general education. His
talk, in urging acceptance of Stanford's report,
was convincing and in our judgment unan
swerable.
Yet the plan has not been accepted by the
faculty or adopted by the University. We think
Stanford is lagging behind the universities of
the East which are already launched, on their
programs; we believe today's generation of
students needs above all things the chance to
learn how to become thoughtful citizens in a
society that is already questioning the worth
of democracy.
Being an educational institution, Stanford
and its teaching methods will naturally be
under constant examination by its students, its
fellow universities, and thinking people
throughout the nation. The students them
selves should be most deeply concerned, yet
Ihey are rarely heard effectively because the
majority are not aware until after graduation
of any deficiency in their preparedness for a
life in a complex "world outside." However,
this year a significant portion of returned stu
dents have commented on the fact that the
educational plan at Stanford and at most places
in the nation, does not provide the essentials
which will turn out people who know how to
think.
Facts are no good without an understand
ing of how to use them. Decisions are shakily
made without a clear picture of alternative ac
tions and probable effects. Students need a
guiding hand; under the present system it has
been shown that students on their own at Stan
ford don't know where they're going.
Dynamic education, not static training, is
what a university must provide to its students
as potential or actual citizens in a free society.
Through their formative years, there must be
discipline and guidance whiqh will impress
upon students their importance as individuals
individuals who must be responsible in a
democracy for their private and social actions.
Students must be given an indoctrination to the
culture, the method of thinking, which has
brought about and which keeps functioning the
democratic principles dominant in the United
States.
The requisite guidance must be undertaken
by the educational institutions of our nation.
As college freshmen, and high school stu
dents with a hit-or-miss education, young peo
ple presume to know what they want. But their
choice of occupation and the attitudes they
foster are not a result of conscious free choice,
but the result of their willy-nilly contact with
realistic educational experiences.
The anarchy of the present elective system
at Stanford guarantees to no one the well-bal

anced education which will create a free
thinking person. Students take what is easiest,
what vaguely appeals to them as a result of
previous experience, or what is nominally sup
posed to guarantee their competence as
teacher, engineer or chemist.
As yet, the university program has pro
gressed no farther than offering a provocative
course in Western Civilization, a requirement
in English and a foreign language, and an un
disciplined natural and social science elective
requirement.
What is called for is something similar to
the Harvard plan—a two-year course of re
quirements before entrance into specialized
professional or practical training. Require
ments should include a thorough grounding
in history tied to the problems of today; an
understanding of the wheels of our economy
and the alternative economic systems of the
world; a knowledge of physics in our physics
dominated society; a training in English and
the art of expression; training in logic and
semantics, and an over-all philosophy which
will tie education into a comprehensible whole.
