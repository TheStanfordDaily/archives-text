To I he Editor:
In yesterday morning's edition, the Daily printed
an excerpt from the constitution which read in part:
' There shall be no expenditure of money for cam
paign purposes. There shall be no written campaign
ing of any type. There shall be no publication or dis
tribution of any campaign material on campus other
than that contained in the Stanford Daily."
Since we may assume that the purpose of the
various campus elections, and particularly those for
positions on Excom, is to provide effective student
representation, it becomes obvious that the above
provisions of the constitution serve only to defeat
that purpose.
In all probability Article IV. Section 2-h, was
conceived with the very best of intentions, but. as
the old saying goes, the streets of hell are paved with
good intentions. The framers of our constitution
were no doubt trying to curb the practice of winning

campus elections by sheer weight of campaign prop
aganda and ballyhoo. They felt, and rightly, that
elections should not be won solely on a basis of
organization and unlimited financial resources. Ar
ticle IV, Section 2-h, effectively checked those abuses,
but in so doing it made campus elections little more
than popularity contests.
Perhaps you would like a specific example? Take
then the recent election for representatives to the
men's athletic board where Fred Boensch polled far
more votes than all other candidates combined.
With all due respect to Boensch, just how many of
the students who cast their ballots for him had any
idea how he stood on athletic policy (save that he
favored a winning football team)? In a small college,
where all of the students lived on campus, such a
constitutional provision might be wise, but when
seven thousand students are scattered over a large
area as they are here at Stanford it is outmoded
and unrealistic.
Outright repeal may not be the answer. Per
haps regulations limiting the amount of campaign
expenditures or the type and size of printed mate
rial should be made. The important point, however,
is that until some changes are made effective student
government is impossible.
