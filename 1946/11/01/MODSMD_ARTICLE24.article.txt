## BULL SESSION 
### 
Every time I see a girl going in or out of Branner,
it looks as illegal as all shucks. I still can't get used
to the idea of women living down there. It always
seems illicit to watch them wandering freely in and
out of what used to be a men's dorm.
One girl during the initial days of her stay here
k'jpt inadvertently (she says) going into the Toyon
entrance. Took her quite a while to get straightened
out. But. of course, she is the same girl who, during
her pre-reg period as a frosh, went roaming into
Encina thinking it was part of the Quad.
Is the rumor true that the Toyon lads have their
Branner tunnel almost completed?

New instructions to football officials of the Pacific
Coast Conference have put a squelch on the activi
ties of rooting sections.
The officials have been told:
"If the rooting sections yell, or count off the
yards as an official steps off a penalty, the official
will keep on stepping off more penalty until the
yelling or counting stops."
The new ruling was reported in the S.F. Chron
icle and presumably comes from the office of the
Pacific Coast Conference Commissioner.
At Cal, that could lead to an official's walking
all the way to Los Angeles, stepping off a penalty.
And don't look so righteous. There's been a lot of

that developing around here in our UNMIXED root
ing section.
But regardless of the element of "sportsmanship
involved, the ruling sets a dangerous precedent for
football. When the teams on the field are penalized
for the actions of the spectators in the stands, things
have gone a little too far.
Fouls have been called in basketball for partisan
yelling in the stands, particularly during free throws
and the like, but fortunately that practice had not
until now been extended to football.
For eleven guys who are beating their brains out
for the old Alma Mater down on the field to be
unfairly penalized because some jokers in the stands
have gotten plastered out of their hip flask and
started screaming at the ref is about as unfair as
anything could be.
Next thing we know, the home team will be get
ting penalized because a drunk in the 59th row hit
the usher with a beer bottle. And didn't say, "Par
don me," when he burped.
Of course, the solution might be for the opposing
schools to get together before the game and offer
to count off the penalties for each other.
Or perhaps, save the penalties and count 'em off
during the half while the team is off the field. It
would be just about as sensible a procedure as this
new ruling is.
One, two, three, four, five, you black-and-white
shirted P.C.C. officials!
