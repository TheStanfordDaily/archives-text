# Play Tryouts Open To All; Frosh, Too
## 
### 
First-quarter freshmen may now
try out for parts in two long one
act plays to be given next quarter.
Tryouts will be held next Tuesday
and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. in room
205 in the Memorial Auditorium and
Thursday and Friday at 3 p.m. in
the main theater on the Macbeth
set. The plays, two recent Broad
way hits, are "My Heart's in the
Highlands," by William Saroyan,
and "John Doe," by Bernard Dryer.
Any Stanford student may try
out for these plays, providing he
will be here next quarter. Actors in
the three one-act plays to be given
next week may try out by arrange
ment with Mr. A. N. Vardac. The
show will be given Jan. 15-18. Re
hearsals begin Nov. 11, but there
will be no rehearsals during dead
week and exams.
