## SLING TIME 
### 
I I
Tomorrow Marchie's Men have another chance to get back into win
ning stride, but it's no cinch. After a had opener in Los Angeles, the
Beavers have come back witli a rush; they haven't lost another game.
Among the victims were the Thundering (then Blundering) Herd from
Figueroa Tech. Lon Stiner's ball club is mighty tough to beat up in its
own home territory—especially when it rains, which it usually does.
The State Constitution ol Oregon provides that there must be at least a
drizzle every Saturday afternoon throughout the gridball season.
The Stanford Indians have not been tested on a wet field yet this
season—and the T formation depends on split-second timing. With the
underfooting a bit slimy, it will be tough keeping to the schedule.
In addition, several more young gentlemen have joined the injured
list. Gene Martin and Buck Brownson, word lias it. will play little—if
any. Schwartz also plans to use Boh Hall and Lloyd Merriman spar
ingly if at all possible; they still have weary hones from that punishing
squahhle with USC. Harvey Bernhard and Marty Feldman are hack to
reinforce the guard slots, hut it's doubtful that they'll he up to their
usual standard.
So take a tip; don't go spotting a lot of points in any friendly little
wager you might make. Stanford figures to win. The spirit is good.
They'll fight hard. But there'll be no high score. If the game turns out
to be easy, Schwartz will rest some of his men. And it could be a rough,
tough, even contest. The Beavers have a lot of good men back from a
victorious Rose Bowl team, and they'll be playing under conditions they
know and like. A combination of Stanford injuries and a slow, muddy
field could tip the scales Oregon's way.
(lonlrasls in Sportsmanship
A lot of good sportsmanship has been shown by opposing rooting sec
tions on the Coast this season. But for a contrast in sportsmanship, let's
take a little trip down to South Carolina, to the South Carolina-Clemson
game of last weekend. In case you didn't know, the South Carolinians are
called the Gamecocks, and they have —had—a fighting cock for a mascot.
Some of the brave (?) Clemson rooters formed a task force at half-time,
and swooped across the field. They returned with the South Carolina
mascot. Then they publicly wrung the innocent creature's neck.
I like to think that nothing as nasty as that could ever happen out
here—even at Berkeley. There can't he any possible excuse—except the
warped minds of the mob's leaders. Football provides excitement, hut
such actions can't he condoned on the grounds of high spirits. Fortu
nately Clemson lost the game.
Among the spectators was Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, who is
one of the trustees of Clemson College. He couldn't have been pleased at
what he saw; it will be interesting to see what line of action he takes, if
any.

Another case of poor sportsmanship comes from another Southern
state, Mississippi. The state college refuses to allow Nevada's star Negro
players on the field down there. It isn't the first time; early this season
Oklahoma City U. pulled the same deal on Fresno State. Back in '40
Texas A & M came out for a game with UCLA and deliberately injured
Jackie Robinson and Ray Bartlett, two colored halfbacks. UCLA has not
played the Aggies since—and won't.
It seems to me there's only one possible solution—STOP I'LAYINfI
SOUTHERN TEAMS. If they can't participate in the sport on the same
basis as everyone else, let them stay home and play with each other.
Footlmll. the last time I heard, was still a sport—not warfare. Let's keep
it that way.
I Yen liar Prognostications
This week, as a result of practically no requests, I will continue to pick
the Coast games in rhyme. The percentage now stands at .777. A nice
round number, that. Stand back:
Broncos and Dons will meet at Kezar;
The Bronc is due for a smack on the Bczar.
Ladies and gentlemen, horses and mules,
If you pick the Gaels, you're a pack of fules.
Oregon's Ducks meet Southern Cal;
The Trojans are rollin', so vot de hal.
The Cougar at Berkeley will make merry.
But I will pick the Golden Berry.
The Cards will beat the Black and Orange,
But they'll have to do some scorange.
Who was that character that said it was impossible to rhyme "orange?"
One of us is obviously wrong. Obviously.
IYripalWic Paragraphing
There was one thing about those Trojans—their women all looked like
movie stars. Hubba, hubba' ll' any of you are interested, I would gladly
trade every coed at Stanford for a mere hundred little beetles like the two
Trobabes I saw as 1 went in the gate. (Honey, you KNOW I'm kidding!)

As indicated before, Stanford would do well to let a few of its instru
ment-playing femmes into the band. Don't worry about the marching:
any fool can learn to drill. I learned, didn't I? Another welcome and
attractive innovation would he a few pulchritudiiious dium majorettes
and yell leaders. II there aren't any such on campus, there are still plenty
of high schools around. Before the war, Stanford brought a drum major
ette all the way down here from San Leandro High.

The Trojans were lucky they didn't have to look at that dastardly card
stunt they pulled, of Lena the (ack)! Hyena. Gad, it was horrible. Some
of the less astigmatic sportswriters upchucked all over the press box, just
like it was a drive-in and they could afford Cadillacs. On their money
they should have Cadillacs!
* * * *
It seems that Stanford is the only Bay Area team that does not play
St. Mary's. Yes, I know the Cards broke off relations with very good
reason. But more than a few years have passed: it's an altogether differ
ent generation of players. There is a new coaching regime at Moraga.
Even the school's administration lias had a complete turnover. There is
no reason in the world why the Gaels shouldn't he on the Stanford
schedule next year. After all, we play them in other sports—is that
consistent?

Embarrassing moments: the Slinger was resting his weary bones down
in the Encina Cellar the other p.m., carrying on an uplifting conversation
with a friend. Seated alongside were Jack Weiershauser and Gene Cold
iron of the athletic staff, who didn't know the Slinger from Adam's hat.
The talk got around to sports columns, and Coldiron hazarded the opinion
that Sling Time was better than It Sez Here.
That was more than Weiershauser could stand. "What!" he what ted.
"Sling Time can't hold a candle to what Farkas writes! It stinks!" The
<ngument went on, <ind I sat theie enjoying it all, incognito (rooting for
Coldiron, of coursc), until little i

Sunshine at my right blurts out.
"Say Dan, do you write that stuff
in the daytime or at night?" A dull,
stifling silence descended over the
little group. Don't worry about it.
Jack; my own mother once insinu
ated that my natural field would be
more in the line of digging ditches.
