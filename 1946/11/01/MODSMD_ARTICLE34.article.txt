RENO. New, Oct. 31 (UP).-,Stu
dent sentiment favoring cancella
tion of Nevada's Nov. 1G football
game with Mississippi State grew
steadily today as officials of each
school waited for the other to take
the next step in their dispute over
Nevada's two star Negro players.
Nevada's board of athletic con
trol is awaiting a reply from the
southern college to a request for
clarification of a letter from Missis
sippi State declaring that appear
ance of the two players on the
southern field would lead to "an
unfortunate commotion."
Graduate Manager Joseph T. Mc-
Donnell said today that an answer
from the southern college was "two
days overdue" but that further ac
tion would await their reply.
The two players involved are
halfback William Bass, captain of
last year's colored Ail-American
College eleven, and Horace Gillom.
candidate for All-Coast end honors.
Both are war veterans. Leading
campus opposition to playing the
game if the two players are barred
were ex-GI students.
