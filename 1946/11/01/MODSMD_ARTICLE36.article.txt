# Water Polo Record Goes On Block Against Bears
## 
### BOB BULLOCK 
Stanford's "white hope" for a conference championship, the
water polo team, will meet stern opposition on its road to the flag
tomorrow morning in the California Bears. As a result of last
week's easy win over hapless USC, the Indians share the league
lead with the unpredictable Bears, who also sport an undefeated
record. The important meeting is slated for 10 o'clock in the
Encina Pool.
Coaches Ernie Brandsten and Tom Haynie, who are leading

the Indians toward what is expected
to be their most successful season,
have decided to string along with
the same starting seven that plas
tered the Trojans. Before the hap
less men from Troy recovered from
Stanford's shock troops, the Indians
were safely leading by ten points.
Unfortunately the Bears promise to
throw up a more powerful defense
than the futile Trojans.
In fact, enthusiasm is at a fever
pitch on the Berkeley campus,
where the Bear tinmen are gun
ning for an upset. After a disap
pointing practice schedule which
saw the Olympic Club hold them
to a split, California's splashers
roared hack to sink USC. 6-5, in
the opening Conference game.
Thus, with UCLA as well as the
Trojans virtually eliminated from
contention, the Bears could grab
water polo honors by tripping the
high-flying Indians.
But although the Stanford mer
men recognize the abilities of Cali
fornia. they go into tomorrow's tra
ditional game supremely confident
of victory. Odds agree with the
prowess of the Indians, who were
tabbed early in the season to annex
the Conference title. Tomorrow's
battle will mark the half-way mark
in the Conference schedule for the
Indians, who have emerged on top
in all three games.
The favored Indians will be lead
by the deadly accuracy of Harry
Borchers and Jim Armstrong, who
are engaged in a friendly feud for
scoring honors. Borchers, operating
from center forward position, has
chalked up eleven points in the
three Stanford wins. Meanwhile.
Armstrong continued his automatic
score production with three against
USC to run his total to nine points
for the season.
William Carpenter, scrappy In
dian goalie, will no doubt see a lot of
action against the California offense.
The inner wall of defense for Stan
ford will consist of A 1 Weeden, Dick
Narver. and Duncan Pattie.
