### 
Official confirmation of the re
port that Stanford has been award
ed three prefabricated buildings for
library and office space from the
Federal Works Agency has been
received in the office of Business
Manager Alf Brandin.
Exact date for setting up the
buildings depends on the completion
J of planning between University Ar
chitect Eldridgc T. Spencer and
F.W.A. engineers. They will deter
mine such questions as exact loca
tion of the buildings behind the
main library, and the construction
of partitions into the desired num
| ber of study and officc rooms within
j each building.
Stanford applied for the buildings
| under stress of its increased en
rollment, and received first indi
rect word on a news wire Monday
night that the F.W.A. had granted
them.
