# Hall Leads Varied Life As Football Coach, Chaplain
## 
### JOANNE O'BRIEN 
Visiting Chaplain George J. Hall
has had varied experience as chap
lain at schools and naval stations, as
an ofiicer on the U.S.S. Panamint,
the ship on which scientists made
their observations at Bikini Atoll,
and something of a record as a
member of a football team on which
there were four Phi Beta Kappas.
After doing part of his under
graduate work at the University
of Virginia, Chaplain Hall trans
ferred to the University of the
South in Sewanee, Tenn., and re
reived his Bachelor of Arts and
his B.D. It was at the Univer
sity of the Souih that he played
football on the team, which be
cause of its inadequacy for win
ning games had the sports scribes
raving over its scholastic aver
age for lack of other news. Chap
lain Hall there did graduate work
at the General Theological Semi
nary in New York City for two
years.
lie served as assistant at Saint
Thomas' Church in New York and
as chaplain of Trinity Prep School
in New York until 1940, when he
returned to his alma mater, the
University of the South, as chap
lain. professor of English Bible and
Church History, and assistant foot
ball coach.
Fn February of 1!)45 he became
a Navv chaplain and was stationed
for eight months at Pineypoint,
Aid. Navy Chaplain Hall sailed
from San Francisco on June 12,
Htffi, to take part in Operation
Crossroads at Bikini Atoll. He
left in a group of three ships. The
one he was on, the U.S.S. Pana
mint. with the scientists, was
called by the sailors "the brain
â€¢ rust"; the U.S.S. Appalachian,
with newsmen and radio equip
ment. "the big noise"; and the
I'.S.S. Blue Ridge, with high
ranking Army and Navy officers,
"the consolidated brass."
Chaplain Hall was able to ob
serve both blasts quite clearly, and
he says"the thing that struck me
was the difference in the attitudes
of the men on the ship before each
blast. At the first one, everyone
was tense, hearing the ticking of
the metronome, wondering whether
a tidal wave would engulf the ship
or not. The minutes preceding the
drop of the second bomb showed a
group of people who had already
conquered the atomic bomb, some
so unconcerned that they were
playing cards below deck and were
not on hand to watch the inde
scribable spectacle."
Chaplain Hall was discharged on
Aug. 21 and came to Stanford as
acting chaplain on Sept. 15.
As for the future. Chaplain Hall
has no definite plans but would
like to continue to work with
young people and get to know
the Stanford students better. "The
Memorial Church belongs to the
students and I am only here to
minister to their needs," he said.
