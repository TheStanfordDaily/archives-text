"The Respective 'Merits of Both
Parties" served as political gun fod
der last night.
James Kessler and Malcolm Bar
rett debated this question before an
enthusiastic Cubberley Auditorium
audience. The American Veterans
Committee and the Stanford Debate
Council sponsored the debate-dis
eussian which provided each speak
er with 10 minutes to state his case
and then the opportunity to stand
by to answer questions thrown his
way by the politically wise specta
tors.
'TOMATO THROWING'
Barrett, member of the debate
team, accused the Republicans of
"throwing political tomatoes."
Kessler, graduate law student, de
scribed the present condition of the
country as "an awful mess."
In answer to Kessler's criticism of
the bureaucratic tendencies of the
Democrats, Barrett defined a bu
reaucrat as "a Democrat who has
a job a Republican wants."
ACCUSES OPA
"Why do we have veterans living
in blueprints today?" queried Kess
ler. He described the OPA as "one
of the fundamental reasons for
shortages in the United States to
day."
Dr. Leland T. Chapin acted as
moderator and enforced the pre
arranged one-hour limit on the
meeting although both debaters and
persons in the audience were show
ing signs of increasing blood pres
sure as the deadline arrived.
G.O.P. HARANGUE
A G.0.P.-minded spectator start
ed to ask Barrett a question and
ended up with a five-minute har
angue. He deplored the Democrats'
use of the word liberalism. "They
have taken a perfectly good word
and distorted it." Barrett termed
the speech "a Western Civ lecture."
Barrett compared the two foreign
policies. "The Democrats arc using
constructive statesmanship, while
the Republicans thrive on destruc
tive criticism."
PRAISES KNOW!,AM)
Kessler, in one of the fÂ»'w specific
mentions of the California political
race, told of Knowland's good at
tendance record in Congress. He
also mentioned the fact that the in
cumbent Senator has been named to
three prominent committees.
Barrett claimed that "a vote for
Knowland would be a vote for the
party of reaction." He advocated
the election of Rogers.
