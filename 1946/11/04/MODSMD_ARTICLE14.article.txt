SACRAMENTO, Nov. 3 (UP;.~
The general election campaign wa3
virtually all over but the voting in
California tonight, and 3,000.000
voters were expected to take care
of that Tuesday.
Polls open throughout the slat*.-
at 7 a.m., and close at 7 p.m. in all
areas except San Francisco where
they close at 8 p.m.
Top interest in the state was de
voted to the U.S. Senate contest, al
though nationally the emphasis was
on House of Representatives con
tests because of the possibility of
the Republicans gaining control of
the House.
William F. Knowland, the incum
bent Senator, is a Republican and a
victory for him would not mean a
net gain for Republicans in the up
pe House. A win for his opponent,
Will Rogers, Jr., on the other hand,
would be a shot in the arm for the
Democrats.
Opponents for Attorney General

are Democrat Edmund Brown of
San Francisco and Fred N. Howser
of Los Angeles, district attorneys of
their home counties.
In congressional districts 13 con
tests are scheduled. Democrats hold
10 of these now and Republicans '>■
Four State Senate and 23 State Asl
sembly racs are to be decided.
Considered hottest among 17 bal
lot propositions were No. 2, to legal
ize betting on dog racing; No. 11, to
set up a State Fair Employment
Practices Commission; No. 1, a
$100,000,000 bond issue for home
loans to veterans; No. 4, to allow
business loans to veterans, and No.
3, setting a $2,400 minimum salary
for school elementary teachers.
A dispute between Attorney Gen
eral Robert W. Kenney on one side
and election officials and the Gov
ernor on the other over a Kenny
opinion ' that initiative petitions
could be circulated in polling areas
enlivened the closing days of the
campaign.

The general election campaign wa3
virtually all over but the voting in

voters were expected to take care
of that Tuesday.
Polls open throughout the slat*.-
at 7 a.m., and close at 7 p.m. in all
areas except San Francisco where
they close at 8 p.m.
Top interest in the state was de

tests because of the possibility of
the Republicans gaining control of
