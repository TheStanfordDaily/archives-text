## Those Library Lights 
### 
Equalled only by Union coffee as a peren
nial source of student complaint are the lights
in Stanford's libraries. Purchase of new cof
fee-percolators in the Union may solve the
"hot java" situation, but the anguished cries
of the sufferers from "10 o'clock eye strain"
continue to greet our ears. The letter from
Mr. Vatcher printed below is typical of many
received by the Daily.
And on the basis of actual light meter tests,
those complaints are completely justified.
To help determine whether or not those li
brary iuauaches were the result of poor light
ing cr too much Econ 1, a Weston Foot-Candle
Meter was obtained from Palo Alto High
School and actual tests were made in every
portion of the library.
In using the meter, certain lighting values
are defined according to the Illumination Engi
neering Society Code, which is used by the
high school. These values are defined in this
manner:
3 10 Foot Candles Adequate for Stairs,
Hallways, Warehouses, Auditoriums.
10 20 Foot Candles —Retail Stores, Class
rooms, General Offices.
20 30 Foot Candles —Offices doing close
work. Drafting rooms.
It would seem logical that lighting for a
Library, where theoretically there is continual
reading of books (many in fine print) or study
of more or less illegible class notes, should be
superior to that of the average classroom, but
by any standards, the lights in our libraries
are entirely inadequate, and the amount of
needless eye strain incalculable.
The foot candle power of the lighting at
desk level in the Reading Room of the Main
Library averaged between 8 and 9 foot candles
at table level. The highest reading obtained
was 11 F.C. (barely above the absolute mini
mum prescribed) on two tables in the center
of the library, the lowest was 4 F.C. (barely
adequate for stairways) at the end of the room.
Only slight improvement was found in the
Timothy Hopkins Room, where one table with
14 F.C. rating topped the entire library but the

other three tables were no better than the
reading room.
Even worse was the Periodical Room where
students must peer at small print in the gloom
of an average of 7 foot candles of light.
In both rooms, lowest readings were ob
tained at desks and tables which need light
the most —the reference shelves where Stan
fordites must pore through dictionaries, en
cyclopediae, etc.
Downstairs in the Reserve Book Room, one
finds only very slight improvement. Readings
ranged from lows of 6 to 7 foot candles of
light in the rear portion of the room to highs
of 13 and 14 in the front. Desks directly below
lights registered from 9 to 11 foot candles,
while others averaged two to three foot can
dles less.
Stanford's newest library in the Education
Building found that the esthetic beauty of its
modernistic ceiling lights could not deter the
relentless judgment of the photo-electric cell
of the light meter. Readings went from a low
of 7 F.C. to a high of 10, while the small study
room to the side averaged only 5 foot candles
of light at desk level.
In the light (or rather the gloom) of these
findings, it takes no illumination engineer to
realize that inadequate lighting is not a product
of over-active student imagination, but a
highly justified complaint.
V/hen huge sums of money are spent for
other purposes, the value received from spend
ing the relatively small amount required to
bring the lights up to standard should be ob
vious. If the expense of providing individual
fluorescent lamps for each desk (as they have
at the University of California) is too great, the
library could at least increase the wattage of
the bulbs now used, lower the chandeliers
several feet, and obtain reflectors to replace
the archaic chandeliers now in existence.
We need make no argument for the value
of good eyesight, the necessity for protecting
our eyes in the modern world of the printed
page. Eyestrain can and should be eliminated
by improved lighting methods.—F.B.

at the University of California) is too great, the

Equalled only by Union coffee as a peren
nial source of student complaint are the lights
in Stanford's libraries. Purchase of new cof
fee-percolators in the Union may solve the
"hot java" situation, but the anguished cries
of the sufferers from "10 o'clock eye strain"
continue to greet our ears. The letter from
Mr. Vatcher printed below is typical of many
received by the Daily.
And on the basis of actual light meter tests,
those complaints are completely justified.
To help determine whether or not those li
brary iuauaches were the result of poor light
ing cr too much Econ 1, a Weston Foot-Candle
Meter was obtained from Palo Alto High
School and actual tests were made in every
portion of the library.
In using the meter, certain lighting values
are defined according to the Illumination Engi
neering Society Code, which is used by the
high school. These values are defined in this
manner:
3 10 Foot Candles Adequate for Stairs,
Hallways, Warehouses, Auditoriums.
10 20 Foot Candles —Retail Stores, Class
rooms, General Offices.
20 30 Foot Candles —Offices doing close
work. Drafting rooms.
It would seem logical that lighting for a
Library, where theoretically there is continual
reading of books (many in fine print) or study
of more or less illegible class notes, should be
superior to that of the average classroom, but
by any standards, the lights in our libraries
are entirely inadequate, and the amount of
needless eye strain incalculable.
The foot candle power of the lighting at
desk level in the Reading Room of the Main
Library averaged between 8 and 9 foot candles
at table level. The highest reading obtained
was 11 F.C. (barely above the absolute mini
mum prescribed) on two tables in the center
of the library, the lowest was 4 F.C. (barely
adequate for stairways) at the end of the room.
Only slight improvement was found in the
Timothy Hopkins Room, where one table with
14 F.C. rating topped the entire library but the

other three tables were no better than the
reading room.
Even worse was the Periodical Room where
students must peer at small print in the gloom
of an average of 7 foot candles of light.
In both rooms, lowest readings were ob
tained at desks and tables which need light
the most —the reference shelves where Stan
fordites must pore through dictionaries, en
cyclopediae, etc.
Downstairs in the Reserve Book Room, one
finds only very slight improvement. Readings
ranged from lows of 6 to 7 foot candles of
light in the rear portion of the room to highs
of 13 and 14 in the front. Desks directly below
lights registered from 9 to 11 foot candles,
while others averaged two to three foot can
dles less.
Stanford's newest library in the Education
Building found that the esthetic beauty of its
modernistic ceiling lights could not deter the
relentless judgment of the photo-electric cell
of the light meter. Readings went from a low
of 7 F.C. to a high of 10, while the small study
room to the side averaged only 5 foot candles
of light at desk level.
In the light (or rather the gloom) of these
findings, it takes no illumination engineer to
realize that inadequate lighting is not a product
of over-active student imagination, but a
highly justified complaint.
V/hen huge sums of money are spent for
other purposes, the value received from spend
ing the relatively small amount required to
bring the lights up to standard should be ob
vious. If the expense of providing individual
fluorescent lamps for each desk (as they have
