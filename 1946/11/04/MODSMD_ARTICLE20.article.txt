# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
To ihe Editor:
Four years ago I wrote to the then editor of the
Daily in regard to the lighting in tlie main library.
I expressed to him what I knew to be the opinion of
many of the students, namely, that the lighting in the
library was completely insufficient for normal study
conditions. The editor was very understanding and
took up the issue in the Daily.
Shortly thereafter. I was called to active duty.
B\;t from the trend of conditions at the time I left
1 ielt and hoped that something would be done.
However, it being impracticable to make any im
provements during the war years, nothing was done.
Now. four years later, I have returned to Stanford
to find the same situation extant. The condition is
one which should be corrected. 1 believe that if ev
eryone gets behind the idea, w? could get something
done.
It took the bringing of candles, lanterns, etc., to
the library one evening several years ago to cause
th • administration at U.C.L.A. to take notice of the
poor lighting situation. But they got lights.
As to how to accomplish a change. Perhaps it
could be done .by a donations campaign. No one
would be unwilling. I believe, to contribute. Espe
cially since it affects each one personally.
Maybe someone else has so;ne ideas.
Hopefully,

To the Editor:
Mr. Brunn's column of Wednesday, 30 October,
concerning the candidacy of Senator Knowland (R..

Calif.) contains at least two patent misstatements of
fact which should be corrected prior to the balloting
on Tuesday.
First of all, I recommend that Mr. Brunn lay aside
the propaganda of organized labor and read the pro
visions of H.R. 4908, known as the Case Bill, for
which Senator KnoWland voted "Yea" on 25 May
1946. He will find lhat it is in reality a reasoned
piece of legislation which attempts to affix a degree
of responsibility to labor's participation in industrial
relations which has, in far too many instances in the
past, been one of total irresponsibility.
Secondly, if Mr. Brunn will go to the Congres
sional Record, Volume £2, No. 102, pages 6010 and
6011. he will find there remarks by the same Senator
Knowland in opposition to Section 7—the draft-the
strikers clause—of the President's emergency labor
legislation, H.R. 6578. In the course of his statement,
Knowland said. .. It seems to me, Mr. President,
that our task is to develop legislation which will
protect the fundamental rights of labor and collective
bargaining; but collective bargaining was never
meant to be collective bludgeoning."
On page 6023 of the same issue of the Congres
sional Record, Mr. Brunn will find that Knowland
joined with 69 other Senators in striking from H.R.
6578 this odious Section 7. In consequence of these
matters of record, Mr. Brunn's characterization of
Senator Knowland as an arch foe of organized labor
is not in accord with the facts and should be re
tracted.

library was completely insufficient for normal study
conditions. The editor was very understanding and
took up the issue in the Daily.
Shortly thereafter. I was called to active duty.
B\;t from the trend of conditions at the time I left
1 ielt and hoped that something would be done.
However, it being impracticable to make any im
provements during the war years, nothing was done.
Now. four years later, I have returned to Stanford
to find the same situation extant. The condition is
one which should be corrected. 1 believe that if ev
eryone gets behind the idea, w? could get something
done.
It took the bringing of candles, lanterns, etc., to
the library one evening several years ago to cause
th • administration at U.C.L.A. to take notice of the
poor lighting situation. But they got lights.
As to how to accomplish a change. Perhaps it
could be done .by a donations campaign. No one
would be unwilling. I believe, to contribute. Espe
cially since it affects each one personally.
Maybe someone else has so;ne ideas.

To the Editor:
Mr. Brunn's column of Wednesday, 30 October,
concerning the candidacy of Senator Knowland (R..

Calif.) contains at least two patent misstatements of
fact which should be corrected prior to the balloting
on Tuesday.
First of all, I recommend that Mr. Brunn lay aside
the propaganda of organized labor and read the pro
visions of H.R. 4908, known as the Case Bill, for
which Senator KnoWland voted "Yea" on 25 May
1946. He will find lhat it is in reality a reasoned
piece of legislation which attempts to affix a degree
of responsibility to labor's participation in industrial
relations which has, in far too many instances in the
past, been one of total irresponsibility.
Secondly, if Mr. Brunn will go to the Congres
sional Record, Volume £2, No. 102, pages 6010 and
6011. he will find there remarks by the same Senator
Knowland in opposition to Section 7—the draft-the
strikers clause—of the President's emergency labor
legislation, H.R. 6578. In the course of his statement,
Knowland said. .. It seems to me, Mr. President,
that our task is to develop legislation which will
protect the fundamental rights of labor and collective
bargaining; but collective bargaining was never
meant to be collective bludgeoning."
On page 6023 of the same issue of the Congres
sional Record, Mr. Brunn will find that Knowland
joined with 69 other Senators in striking from H.R.
6578 this odious Section 7. In consequence of these
matters of record, Mr. Brunn's characterization of
Senator Knowland as an arch foe of organized labor
is not in accord with the facts and should be re
tracted.
