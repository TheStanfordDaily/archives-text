## BULL SESSION 
### 
While most of the campus was huddled over ra
dios in Dinah's and elsewhere Saturday afternoon,
some of us trekked north to Kezar to watch some
ol Stanford's foimer gridiron stalwarts cavort for the
l-lay-for-pay S.F. 49-ers.
It reminded me of the old Rose Bowl days of 1940
to sec Frankie Albert slipping the pigskin to Norm
Slandlee while Bruno Banducci and Hank Norberg
did some fine blocking in the lin". It's sure a shame
that the moguls ol the S.F. club can't snag Kmetovic
and Gallarncau from the other pro clubs that have
l hem. It would really be a tremendous drawing card
to see that 1940 backfield in action again.
Albert s passing is as sensational as it ever was.
I can't help thinking that his southpaw pitching and
inspired quarterbacking would put this year's Stan
ford club right into the Rose Bowl. But, of course,
that's sports-speculating better left to my colleagues
on 3.
It's interesting to not 1 the difference between the
spectators at a pro game and those at a college tilt. A
terrific run of 50 or tiO yards is marked by much
cheering and exclamation at a college game. But in
a pro game, the reaction is usually, "Whyinell didn't
he go all the way?" Thn crowd at a professional
game expects to see things like that. They pay for
terrific ball and if they don't see it they are dis
appointed.
Following an amazing run of 60 yards Saturday,
the most excited comment I heard was, "Jeez, he
sure got tackled hard, didn't he?" In what was

probably the most spectacular play seen in the Bay
Region this fall, the Buffalo Bisons scored their first
touchdown against the '49-ers with a faked field goal
and scr .'en pass. Yet no one seemed particularly im
pressed with it.
There aie several advantages that pro ball has for
the spectator over college ball. For one thing, it's
faster with fewer timeouts. The blocking and tack
ling are of a quality that you seldom see en a college
club. And it's usually wide-open football all the
way. The pros know that they are putting on a show
for an audience and they do a good job of it. You
seldom see a pro club get ahead and then begin
playing conservative to stall for time and hold the
ball. They don't Ret paid for that.
But in spite of all that, the college games don't
suffer in comparison with the pros. A college game
in which you are highly partisan for one team and
beat the guy in front of you over the head with a
coke bottle when lie hollers that "Siwa<-h U is a
bunch of bums" is a heck of a lot more fun. That
old college rah-rah adds a lot of spirit and color to
a game that makes it much more interesting.
And without card stunts to look at and a band to
listen to, the halftime period can seem mighty dull.
No. unless you are an ardent football fan who appre
ciates all the finer points of the game of football, you
will have a lot better time and a lot more fun rooting
for Old Siwnsh than watching a play-for-pay eleven.
But it does beat staying home and listening to the
radio.

ball. They don't Ret paid for that.
But in spite of all that, the college games don't
suffer in comparison with the pros. A college game
in which you are highly partisan for one team and
beat the guy in front of you over the head with a
coke bottle when lie hollers that "Siwa<-h U is a
bunch of bums" is a heck of a lot more fun. That
old college rah-rah adds a lot of spirit and color to
a game that makes it much more interesting.
And without card stunts to look at and a band to
listen to, the halftime period can seem mighty dull.
No. unless you are an ardent football fan who appre
ciates all the finer points of the game of football, you
will have a lot better time and a lot more fun rooting
for Old Siwnsh than watching a play-for-pay eleven.
But it does beat staying home and listening to the
radio.
While most of the campus was huddled over ra
dios in Dinah's and elsewhere Saturday afternoon,
some of us trekked north to Kezar to watch some
ol Stanford's foimer gridiron stalwarts cavort for the
l-lay-for-pay S.F. 49-ers.
It reminded me of the old Rose Bowl days of 1940
to sec Frankie Albert slipping the pigskin to Norm
Slandlee while Bruno Banducci and Hank Norberg
did some fine blocking in the lin". It's sure a shame
that the moguls ol the S.F. club can't snag Kmetovic
and Gallarncau from the other pro clubs that have
l hem. It would really be a tremendous drawing card
to see that 1940 backfield in action again.
Albert s passing is as sensational as it ever was.
I can't help thinking that his southpaw pitching and
inspired quarterbacking would put this year's Stan
ford club right into the Rose Bowl. But, of course,
that's sports-speculating better left to my colleagues
on 3.
It's interesting to not 1 the difference between the
spectators at a pro game and those at a college tilt. A
terrific run of 50 or tiO yards is marked by much
cheering and exclamation at a college game. But in
a pro game, the reaction is usually, "Whyinell didn't
he go all the way?" Thn crowd at a professional
game expects to see things like that. They pay for
terrific ball and if they don't see it they are dis
appointed.
Following an amazing run of 60 yards Saturday,
the most excited comment I heard was, "Jeez, he
sure got tackled hard, didn't he?" In what was

probably the most spectacular play seen in the Bay
Region this fall, the Buffalo Bisons scored their first
touchdown against the '49-ers with a faked field goal
and scr .'en pass. Yet no one seemed particularly im
pressed with it.
There aie several advantages that pro ball has for
the spectator over college ball. For one thing, it's
faster with fewer timeouts. The blocking and tack
ling are of a quality that you seldom see en a college
club. And it's usually wide-open football all the
way. The pros know that they are putting on a show
for an audience and they do a good job of it. You
seldom see a pro club get ahead and then begin
playing conservative to stall for time and hold the
ball. They don't Ret paid for that.
