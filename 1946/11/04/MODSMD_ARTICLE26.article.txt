# Dan Endsley SLING TIME
## 
### 
The first part of this colyum is about Jerry Jackson, the Farm's pre
cocious young Tennis Tomato. All right, so there's a football game to talk
about. Ever since old Sgt. Slinger interviewed Brenda Helser he finds it
hard to concentrate on the more manly game. As a matter of fact, for a
time I seriously considered giving up football altogether in favor of cover
ing the women's pool like a blanket. Wet blanket, of course.
This Jackson girl plays a lot of the net game for her o ge and weight;
she may well be California's next Helen Wills, Alice Marble, Pauline Betz,
or what have you. I wouldn't want to embarrass anyone by mentioning
names, but in her practice sessions with the tennis squad (composed of
men) she has chalked up a few victories —according to the particular
grapevine I patronize.
Of course the only excuse I have for writing up the girl just after a
titanic gridiron struggle (poetic, huh?) is the fact that we had a cut made
of her to run along with Art Levinson's sterling interview—but, transpor
tation between here and Redwood City being what it is, the dog team
arrived a day late and we were left holding the bag; I mean the picture.
However, the tall, slim young miss is so easy on the orbs that it would
be a veritable crime if we kept her tintype to ourselves. Not being of
an exclusive bent, we present her herewith as a public service to the male
element on campus. Feast your eyes and howl, you wolves. Jeeves,
hand me my racket; I have business on the tennis court!
110, Hum, Football Again
For the first time this year, Stanford's Cardinals have been horse
collared, left scoreless. Of course all agree that the G.S.C. Beavers have
a good, heavy team, but they couldn't have pulled the trick without the

aid of a sloppy, slippery fields Since
the Indians were underdogs, one
might say they won a moral victory;
and since the Beavers had a statis
tical advantage, they must be cred
ited with the immoral victory.
Of course the game could have
been won, but it's useless to go back
and replay the game; Monday morn
ing quarterbacking is always easy.
Let's just point out that, while
Stanford didn't win, on the other
hand it didn't lose, and let it go at
that.
Next week we can expect a dry
field for the tilt with the in-and-out
Washington Huskies; that is, they've
been an in-and-out squad up to now
—but nine days ago they may have
hit their stride against Br'r Berke
ley Bear. And Saturday they scored
a thumping win over Open Date
Tech.
So Stanford may, as usual, play
them just as they hit their season's
peak. But with another week's rest
some of the Card cripples and inva
lids may be able to discard their
casts, crutches, et al, and lend more
than a inodicunvof assistance to the
I
cause. At any* rate, don't concede
your wagers just yet: I can assure
you thr,. f-tanfoid will show up for
the game. At least the Cards have
motto: Never -ay tie.

A StucTjT in F'utility. - I never
would have believed thai ft 'earn
could look bad while scoring 47
points, but Saturday I saw it with
my own eyes. The Berkeley branch
of U.C.L.A. looked far from devs
tating as it rolled over the Cougars'
alleged football team; said team
looked like Washington State's ar
gument in favor of birth control.
However, it has to be admitted
that the Cougars had a lot of early
bad luck. First Jackie Jensen got
sprung on a long TD run; then, af
ter the kickoff, the Cougars pulled
a poorly executed quick-kick which
was blocked and the Bears scored
again; finally, after Ihe second kick
oil', the boys- from Pullman fumbled
into a Cal lineman's hands on their
own three—all of which resulted in
a 20-point Berkeley lead with the
first quarter only half gone.
Washington State, after that a bit
down in the mouth, could do noth
ing right—and Cal could do nothing

wrong. The game was sloppily played throughout, and both teams looked
very bad. But that doesn't mean there aren't some good individual players
on the Blue and Gold squad. This Frosh Jack Jensen is a fine halfback,
and Freshman John Cunningham—age 20. height 6 feet 3, weight 225 —is
probably a better end than any on the Farm. Of course he's just a kid;
wait till he grows up.
I'm afraid the Californians are in for a rude awakening at Los Angeles
next week. The Trojans ran up 43 points on a previously undefeated
Oregon squad. They are not Ihe same team that was held to a lucky win
in thp opener by the Cougars—and they have no reason to take it easy
on Cal, as the Bruins did. They'll probably try to run up a score, so hold
your y its.
The Rose Bowl-bound Westwooders did some very unpleasant things
to Wedemeyer and Co. Friday night. They just had too much of every
thing. Ernie Case called his usual perfect game, but Burr Baldwin was
Ihe individual star; he scored 18 points—which is quite a few for an end.
1' he hadn't had a broken nose he might have done better. All he did was
run over a blocked Wedemeyer punt for the first TD, take a spot pass down
the middle for the second, then duplicate the effort later just for luck.
On one of his dashes to the goal he ran right through Squirmin' Herman's
t,:ckle. Laßrucherie used 44 men, clearing the bench in the course of the
4(> to 20 slaughter.
* * # *
What Tliev Said —
Tex Oliver (before his team played the Trojans): We couldn't score
on W.S.C. because the field was so muddy. If we have that kind of a field
at Portland next Saturday, U.C.L.A. won't score on us, either. (Marchie
Schwartz would probably agree.)
Jimmy Phelan: Remember that Stanford outfit of 1940? Well. U.C.L.A.
has the same kind of a crew, only more of it.
Phil Sorboe (young Cougar coach): California has the best team we've
played all year (! !)
Dick Friendlich (halftime at Berkeley): I wish Cal had the ball more
often; they call running plays and it uses up more time.
Smiley Farkas: If Bill Lippincott was All-Coast last year, I'm glad I
only saw two games.

Peripatetic Paragraphing: As you all know, Vic Schmidt (Coast Con
ference Commish) recently put out an order to the effect that when root
ing sections count off penalties the referee is to keep walking until'they
stop. Obviously he overlooked the fact that it's always the OPPOSING
rooting section that does the counting—never the one whose team is being
penalized. Now he's come out with another; no officials will be allowed
to fly to games. It must have taken a brilliant mind to think up those
little gems—but then, there's a chance he won't be with us much longer.

One of the City reporters, commenting on the Nevada-Mississippi State
mess, called the latter state the land "full of magnolia and Senator Billbo."
The senator got all the best of that comparison; I've known him to be
likened to something not quite so sweet-smelling that also sits out in the
> ard.
# ♦ * *
This Nevada deal has quite a few angles; the colored boys don't want
their teammates to give up the trip, and the rest of the squad doesn't
want to go without them. The Nevada prexy is an old southern gen'leman
who has agreed to make a speech at Mississippi State on the eve of the
game. Will he be swayed by his early training in white supremacy, or is
he now a Western gentleman? Of course Nevada should not make the
n ip under the circumstances, but he could force the team to go.

See what I mean?
The first part of this colyum is about Jerry Jackson, the Farm's pre
cocious young Tennis Tomato. All right, so there's a football game to talk
about. Ever since old Sgt. Slinger interviewed Brenda Helser he finds it
hard to concentrate on the more manly game. As a matter of fact, for a
time I seriously considered giving up football altogether in favor of cover
ing the women's pool like a blanket. Wet blanket, of course.
This Jackson girl plays a lot of the net game for her o ge and weight;
she may well be California's next Helen Wills, Alice Marble, Pauline Betz,
or what have you. I wouldn't want to embarrass anyone by mentioning
names, but in her practice sessions with the tennis squad (composed of
men) she has chalked up a few victories —according to the particular
grapevine I patronize.
Of course the only excuse I have for writing up the girl just after a
titanic gridiron struggle (poetic, huh?) is the fact that we had a cut made
of her to run along with Art Levinson's sterling interview—but, transpor
tation between here and Redwood City being what it is, the dog team
arrived a day late and we were left holding the bag; I mean the picture.
However, the tall, slim young miss is so easy on the orbs that it would
be a veritable crime if we kept her tintype to ourselves. Not being of
an exclusive bent, we present her herewith as a public service to the male
element on campus. Feast your eyes and howl, you wolves. Jeeves,
hand me my racket; I have business on the tennis court!
110, Hum, Football Again
For the first time this year, Stanford's Cardinals have been horse
collared, left scoreless. Of course all agree that the G.S.C. Beavers have
a good, heavy team, but they couldn't have pulled the trick without the

aid of a sloppy, slippery fields Since
the Indians were underdogs, one
might say they won a moral victory;
and since the Beavers had a statis
tical advantage, they must be cred
ited with the immoral victory.
Of course the game could have
been won, but it's useless to go back
and replay the game; Monday morn
ing quarterbacking is always easy.
Let's just point out that, while
Stanford didn't win, on the other
hand it didn't lose, and let it go at
that.
Next week we can expect a dry
field for the tilt with the in-and-out
Washington Huskies; that is, they've
been an in-and-out squad up to now
—but nine days ago they may have
hit their stride against Br'r Berke
ley Bear. And Saturday they scored
a thumping win over Open Date
Tech.
So Stanford may, as usual, play
them just as they hit their season's
peak. But with another week's rest
some of the Card cripples and inva
lids may be able to discard their
casts, crutches, et al, and lend more
than a inodicunvof assistance to the
I
cause. At any* rate, don't concede
your wagers just yet: I can assure
you thr,. f-tanfoid will show up for
the game. At least the Cards have
motto: Never -ay tie.
# * *
A StucTjT in F'utility. - I never
would have believed thai ft 'earn
could look bad while scoring 47
points, but Saturday I saw it with
my own eyes. The Berkeley branch
of U.C.L.A. looked far from devs
tating as it rolled over the Cougars'
alleged football team; said team
looked like Washington State's ar
gument in favor of birth control.
However, it has to be admitted
that the Cougars had a lot of early
bad luck. First Jackie Jensen got
sprung on a long TD run; then, af
ter the kickoff, the Cougars pulled
a poorly executed quick-kick which
was blocked and the Bears scored
again; finally, after Ihe second kick
oil', the boys- from Pullman fumbled
into a Cal lineman's hands on their
own three—all of which resulted in
a 20-point Berkeley lead with the
first quarter only half gone.
Washington State, after that a bit
down in the mouth, could do noth
ing right—and Cal could do nothing

wrong. The game was sloppily played throughout, and both teams looked
very bad. But that doesn't mean there aren't some good individual players
on the Blue and Gold squad. This Frosh Jack Jensen is a fine halfback,
and Freshman John Cunningham—age 20. height 6 feet 3, weight 225 —is
probably a better end than any on the Farm. Of course he's just a kid;
wait till he grows up.
I'm afraid the Californians are in for a rude awakening at Los Angeles
next week. The Trojans ran up 43 points on a previously undefeated
Oregon squad. They are not Ihe same team that was held to a lucky win
in thp opener by the Cougars—and they have no reason to take it easy
on Cal, as the Bruins did. They'll probably try to run up a score, so hold
your y its.
The Rose Bowl-bound Westwooders did some very unpleasant things
to Wedemeyer and Co. Friday night. They just had too much of every
thing. Ernie Case called his usual perfect game, but Burr Baldwin was
Ihe individual star; he scored 18 points—which is quite a few for an end.
1' he hadn't had a broken nose he might have done better. All he did was
run over a blocked Wedemeyer punt for the first TD, take a spot pass down
the middle for the second, then duplicate the effort later just for luck.
On one of his dashes to the goal he ran right through Squirmin' Herman's
t,:ckle. Laßrucherie used 44 men, clearing the bench in the course of the
4(> to 20 slaughter.
* * # *
What Tliev Said —
Tex Oliver (before his team played the Trojans): We couldn't score
on W.S.C. because the field was so muddy. If we have that kind of a field
at Portland next Saturday, U.C.L.A. won't score on us, either. (Marchie
Schwartz would probably agree.)
Jimmy Phelan: Remember that Stanford outfit of 1940? Well. U.C.L.A.
has the same kind of a crew, only more of it.
Phil Sorboe (young Cougar coach): California has the best team we've
played all year (! !)
Dick Friendlich (halftime at Berkeley): I wish Cal had the ball more
often; they call running plays and it uses up more time.
Smiley Farkas: If Bill Lippincott was All-Coast last year, I'm glad I
only saw two games.

See what I mean?
The first part of this colyum is about Jerry Jackson, the Farm's pre
cocious young Tennis Tomato. All right, so there's a football game to talk
about. Ever since old Sgt. Slinger interviewed Brenda Helser he finds it
hard to concentrate on the more manly game. As a matter of fact, for a
time I seriously considered giving up football altogether in favor of cover
ing the women's pool like a blanket. Wet blanket, of course.
This Jackson girl plays a lot of the net game for her o ge and weight;
she may well be California's next Helen Wills, Alice Marble, Pauline Betz,
or what have you. I wouldn't want to embarrass anyone by mentioning
names, but in her practice sessions with the tennis squad (composed of
men) she has chalked up a few victories —according to the particular
grapevine I patronize.
Of course the only excuse I have for writing up the girl just after a
titanic gridiron struggle (poetic, huh?) is the fact that we had a cut made
of her to run along with Art Levinson's sterling interview—but, transpor
tation between here and Redwood City being what it is, the dog team
arrived a day late and we were left holding the bag; I mean the picture.
However, the tall, slim young miss is so easy on the orbs that it would
be a veritable crime if we kept her tintype to ourselves. Not being of
an exclusive bent, we present her herewith as a public service to the male
element on campus. Feast your eyes and howl, you wolves. Jeeves,
hand me my racket; I have business on the tennis court!

For the first time this year, Stanford's Cardinals have been horse
collared, left scoreless. Of course all agree that the G.S.C. Beavers have
a good, heavy team, but they couldn't have pulled the trick without the

aid of a sloppy, slippery fields Since
the Indians were underdogs, one
might say they won a moral victory;
and since the Beavers had a statis
tical advantage, they must be cred
ited with the immoral victory.
Of course the game could have
been won, but it's useless to go back
and replay the game; Monday morn
ing quarterbacking is always easy.
Let's just point out that, while
Stanford didn't win, on the other
hand it didn't lose, and let it go at
that.
Next week we can expect a dry
field for the tilt with the in-and-out
Washington Huskies; that is, they've
been an in-and-out squad up to now
—but nine days ago they may have
hit their stride against Br'r Berke
ley Bear. And Saturday they scored
a thumping win over Open Date
Tech.
So Stanford may, as usual, play
them just as they hit their season's
peak. But with another week's rest
some of the Card cripples and inva
lids may be able to discard their
casts, crutches, et al, and lend more
than a inodicunvof assistance to the
I
cause. At any* rate, don't concede
your wagers just yet: I can assure
you thr,. f-tanfoid will show up for

A StucTjT in F'utility. - I never
would have believed thai ft 'earn
could look bad while scoring 47
points, but Saturday I saw it with
my own eyes. The Berkeley branch
of U.C.L.A. looked far from devs
tating as it rolled over the Cougars'
alleged football team; said team
looked like Washington State's ar
gument in favor of birth control.
However, it has to be admitted
that the Cougars had a lot of early
bad luck. First Jackie Jensen got
sprung on a long TD run; then, af
ter the kickoff, the Cougars pulled
a poorly executed quick-kick which
was blocked and the Bears scored
again; finally, after Ihe second kick
oil', the boys- from Pullman fumbled
into a Cal lineman's hands on their
own three—all of which resulted in
a 20-point Berkeley lead with the
first quarter only half gone.
Washington State, after that a bit
down in the mouth, could do noth
ing right—and Cal could do nothing

wrong. The game was sloppily played throughout, and both teams looked
very bad. But that doesn't mean there aren't some good individual players
on the Blue and Gold squad. This Frosh Jack Jensen is a fine halfback,
and Freshman John Cunningham—age 20. height 6 feet 3, weight 225 —is
probably a better end than any on the Farm. Of course he's just a kid;
wait till he grows up.
I'm afraid the Californians are in for a rude awakening at Los Angeles
next week. The Trojans ran up 43 points on a previously undefeated
Oregon squad. They are not Ihe same team that was held to a lucky win
in thp opener by the Cougars—and they have no reason to take it easy
on Cal, as the Bruins did. They'll probably try to run up a score, so hold
your y its.
The Rose Bowl-bound Westwooders did some very unpleasant things
to Wedemeyer and Co. Friday night. They just had too much of every
thing. Ernie Case called his usual perfect game, but Burr Baldwin was
Ihe individual star; he scored 18 points—which is quite a few for an end.
1' he hadn't had a broken nose he might have done better. All he did was
run over a blocked Wedemeyer punt for the first TD, take a spot pass down
the middle for the second, then duplicate the effort later just for luck.

bad luck. First Jackie Jensen got
sprung on a long TD run; then, af
ter the kickoff, the Cougars pulled
a poorly executed quick-kick which
was blocked and the Bears scored
again; finally, after Ihe second kick
oil', the boys- from Pullman fumbled
into a Cal lineman's hands on their
own three—all of which resulted in
a 20-point Berkeley lead with the
first quarter only half gone.
Washington State, after that a bit
down in the mouth, could do noth
ing right—and Cal could do nothing

wrong. The game was sloppily played throughout, and both teams looked
very bad. But that doesn't mean there aren't some good individual players
on the Blue and Gold squad. This Frosh Jack Jensen is a fine halfback,
and Freshman John Cunningham—age 20. height 6 feet 3, weight 225 —is
probably a better end than any on the Farm. Of course he's just a kid;
wait till he grows up.
I'm afraid the Californians are in for a rude awakening at Los Angeles
next week. The Trojans ran up 43 points on a previously undefeated
Oregon squad. They are not Ihe same team that was held to a lucky win
in thp opener by the Cougars—and they have no reason to take it easy
on Cal, as the Bruins did. They'll probably try to run up a score, so hold
your y its.
The Rose Bowl-bound Westwooders did some very unpleasant things
to Wedemeyer and Co. Friday night. They just had too much of every

1' he hadn't had a broken nose he might have done better. All he did was
run over a blocked Wedemeyer punt for the first TD, take a spot pass down
the middle for the second, then duplicate the effort later just for luck.

See what I mean?
The first part of this colyum is about Jerry Jackson, the Farm's pre
cocious young Tennis Tomato. All right, so there's a football game to talk
about. Ever since old Sgt. Slinger interviewed Brenda Helser he finds it
hard to concentrate on the more manly game. As a matter of fact, for a
time I seriously considered giving up football altogether in favor of cover
ing the women's pool like a blanket. Wet blanket, of course.
This Jackson girl plays a lot of the net game for her o ge and weight;
she may well be California's next Helen Wills, Alice Marble, Pauline Betz,
or what have you. I wouldn't want to embarrass anyone by mentioning
names, but in her practice sessions with the tennis squad (composed of
men) she has chalked up a few victories —according to the particular
grapevine I patronize.
Of course the only excuse I have for writing up the girl just after a
titanic gridiron struggle (poetic, huh?) is the fact that we had a cut made
of her to run along with Art Levinson's sterling interview—but, transpor
tation between here and Redwood City being what it is, the dog team
arrived a day late and we were left holding the bag; I mean the picture.
However, the tall, slim young miss is so easy on the orbs that it would
be a veritable crime if we kept her tintype to ourselves. Not being of
an exclusive bent, we present her herewith as a public service to the male
element on campus. Feast your eyes and howl, you wolves. Jeeves,
hand me my racket; I have business on the tennis court!
110, Hum, Football Again
For the first time this year, Stanford's Cardinals have been horse
collared, left scoreless. Of course all agree that the G.S.C. Beavers have
a good, heavy team, but they couldn't have pulled the trick without the

aid of a sloppy, slippery fields Since
the Indians were underdogs, one
might say they won a moral victory;
and since the Beavers had a statis
tical advantage, they must be cred
ited with the immoral victory.
Of course the game could have
been won, but it's useless to go back
and replay the game; Monday morn
ing quarterbacking is always easy.
Let's just point out that, while
Stanford didn't win, on the other
hand it didn't lose, and let it go at
that.
Next week we can expect a dry
field for the tilt with the in-and-out
Washington Huskies; that is, they've
been an in-and-out squad up to now
—but nine days ago they may have
hit their stride against Br'r Berke
ley Bear. And Saturday they scored
a thumping win over Open Date
Tech.
So Stanford may, as usual, play
them just as they hit their season's
peak. But with another week's rest
some of the Card cripples and inva
lids may be able to discard their
casts, crutches, et al, and lend more
than a inodicunvof assistance to the
I
cause. At any* rate, don't concede
your wagers just yet: I can assure
you thr,. f-tanfoid will show up for
the game. At least the Cards have
motto: Never -ay tie.

A StucTjT in F'utility. - I never

could look bad while scoring 47
points, but Saturday I saw it with
my own eyes. The Berkeley branch
of U.C.L.A. looked far from devs
tating as it rolled over the Cougars'
alleged football team; said team
looked like Washington State's ar
