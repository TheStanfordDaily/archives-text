# Indian Splashers Shade Cal, 7-6, to Cop PCC Lead
## 
### BOB BULLOCK 
As a result of Saturday's thrilling 7-6 victory over a de
termined gang of California splashers, the Stanford Water Polo
team owns undisputed possession of first place in the Pacific
Coast Conference. A large, enthusiastic crowd of Indian fans
went home happy from the Encina pool, but not before the

under-dog Bears had given the bril
liant Stanford team a grade-A scare.
During the riotous last quarter of
the melee, neither team was able to
! score—a fine tribute to the sensa
tional defensive work of both
squads. Yet the final quarter did
not lack action despite the absence
of scoring. The Indians were pro
tecting a slim one-point lead at the
time, and a break- hrough by the
Bears would have > tanged the en
tire complexion of the game.
Actually, Stanford was the ag
gressive party during the final few
minutes of the battle, as they at
tempted to clinch the victory.
Three successive times the Cali
fornia goalie made spectacular
saves to thwart the Indians. And
when the Bears finally were able
to get possession of the ball. Car
dinal goalie Bud Carpenter baited
away every scoring thrust.
In the opening few minutes of
the game, Stanford jumped into a
two-point lead with a pair of me
chanically executed plays. A com
plete rout of the Berkeley entry
seemed in the offing because of the
ease in which the Indians scored.
But the Bears dispelled such visions
by tossing in two neat points of
their own to knot the count.
Back came the aroused Indians
with three successive scores to bar
rel into their largest lead of the day,
5-3. Joe Widman, who led the Bears
with three markers, picked this mo
ment to display some tricky ma
neuvering in two back-hand shots
for scores. The Indians still were
clinging to a 5-4 lead, and despite a
wild battle the half ended with the
same Stanford advantage.
California still had some fight left
as they tied the score at 5 all. Stan
ford's hopes for an undefeated lea
gue season seemed to be waning; the
stubborn visitors were obviously
"high 5 ' for an upset But Emmett
Cashin, Indian fon rd, noncha
lantly ntled in his thud marker for
the day to put Stanford back into a
lead they never relinquished.
One of the most spectacular shots
of the year killed all Bear hopes for
victory. After beating his center
forward opponent to the Lall on the
center tip, Jim Armstrong took aim
from the middle of the pool and un
corked a powerful heave which
caught the Bear goalie out of posi
tion. The ball crashed into the cage
and Stanford lead 7-5. California
died right there, but the Bears
countered again to narrow the mar
gin to one point.
Stanford's tired splashers em
erged from the game as strong
favorites to cop the PCC cham
pionship. Only two hurdles re
main for (he Indians, one each
with California and UCLA, both
schools having already fallen be
fore the brilliant speed of Stan
ford.
The same seven men that started
the game for Stanford played the
entire rugged battle without substi
tution. Emmett Cashin scored three
important points for scoring honors,
with veteran Harry Borchers fol
lowing with two. One marker each
was pushed in by Dick Narver and
Jim Armstrong. Meanwhile the
spectacular last quarter defense
thrown up by Duncan Patty, Ai
Weeden, and Bud Carpenter pro
tected the slim Indian one-point
lead.

During the riotous last quarter of
the melee, neither team was able to
! score—a fine tribute to the sensa
tional defensive work of both
squads. Yet the final quarter did
not lack action despite the absence
of scoring. The Indians were pro
tecting a slim one-point lead at the
time, and a break- hrough by the
Bears would have > tanged the en
tire complexion of the game.
Actually, Stanford was the ag
gressive party during the final few
minutes of the battle, as they at
tempted to clinch the victory.
Three successive times the Cali
fornia goalie made spectacular
saves to thwart the Indians. And
when the Bears finally were able
to get possession of the ball. Car
dinal goalie Bud Carpenter baited
away every scoring thrust.
In the opening few minutes of
the game, Stanford jumped into a
two-point lead with a pair of me
chanically executed plays. A com
plete rout of the Berkeley entry
seemed in the offing because of the
ease in which the Indians scored.
But the Bears dispelled such visions
by tossing in two neat points of
their own to knot the count.
Back came the aroused Indians
with three successive scores to bar
rel into their largest lead of the day,
5-3. Joe Widman, who led the Bears
with three markers, picked this mo
ment to display some tricky ma
neuvering in two back-hand shots
for scores. The Indians still were
clinging to a 5-4 lead, and despite a
wild battle the half ended with the
same Stanford advantage.
California still had some fight left
as they tied the score at 5 all. Stan
ford's hopes for an undefeated lea
gue season seemed to be waning; the
stubborn visitors were obviously
"high 5 ' for an upset But Emmett
Cashin, Indian fon rd, noncha
lantly ntled in his thud marker for
the day to put Stanford back into a
lead they never relinquished.
One of the most spectacular shots
of the year killed all Bear hopes for
victory. After beating his center
forward opponent to the Lall on the
center tip, Jim Armstrong took aim
from the middle of the pool and un
corked a powerful heave which
caught the Bear goalie out of posi
tion. The ball crashed into the cage
and Stanford lead 7-5. California
died right there, but the Bears
countered again to narrow the mar
gin to one point.
Stanford's tired splashers em
erged from the game as strong
favorites to cop the PCC cham
pionship. Only two hurdles re
main for (he Indians, one each
with California and UCLA, both
schools having already fallen be
fore the brilliant speed of Stan
ford.
The same seven men that started
the game for Stanford played the
entire rugged battle without substi
tution. Emmett Cashin scored three
important points for scoring honors,
with veteran Harry Borchers fol
lowing with two. One marker each
was pushed in by Dick Narver and
Jim Armstrong. Meanwhile the
spectacular last quarter defense
thrown up by Duncan Patty, Ai
Weeden, and Bud Carpenter pro
tected the slim Indian one-point
lead.
As a result of Saturday's thrilling 7-6 victory over a de
termined gang of California splashers, the Stanford Water Polo
team owns undisputed possession of first place in the Pacific
Coast Conference. A large, enthusiastic crowd of Indian fans
went home happy from the Encina pool, but not before the

under-dog Bears had given the bril
liant Stanford team a grade-A scare.
