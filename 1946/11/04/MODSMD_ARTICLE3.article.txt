# Big Reds Falter, Tie OSC
## Heavy Footing Slows Attack 
### AL MUNK 
The ignition was on, the- engine
was running, bul Ihe gearshift just
wouldn't stay in low.
: And the few moments when some
one managed to jam the gearlever
of the big, Red machine into gear,
the big wheels spun helplessly on
| the soft turf they were riding.
But soft grpund or not, Stanford's
I varsity griddcrs had to leave Bel)
I Stadium at Corvallis content with a
scoreless tie against the Beavers of
Oregon State College. Though the
Beavers had the edge statistically,
I it was the big Indian who had more
opportunities to score as the red
I machine rolled up to the Beaver
j door 3 times, but no one on Mar
| chic's team had the right key to lit
I the lock.
Throughout the entire contest
the Cardinals tried to lake to ihe
air for a fling at the scoring col
umn. lint either the passer was
unaldc to find an unmolested re
ceiver, or if the pigskin got into
the air, the man For whom it was
intended would f;iil to hold onto
the slippery hall. Of 21 attempted
passes, only 3 were completed by
the Indians. All in all, the threat
of a bumblebee attack was omin
ously absent as tne hit-tune of the
afternoon was a Stanford arrange
ment of Fumble-Boogie.
The game not oIT to a good start
; as Stanford capitalized on a 1.0-yard
| run around left end by Mickey Titus
i and in 3 short, plunges put Ihe hall
| on the Oregon State 1.2-yard line for
| a first down. On the next play
j Lloyd Merriman caught one of the
j afternoon's rarely completed passes
j out of the guiding hand of Aubrey
Devine, and that put the front
wheels of the red machine on the
Beaver 3. Then Titus took the ball
and submarined over center for one
vital yard and a first down on the
1 OSC 2. At this point the Cardinals
i had the best set-up of the entire
j afternoon, and as the while-hel
| meted Indians lined up on the 2
j with four chances to score before
j them, it looked like a sure thing.
On the first, try Merriman fum
bled the ball on the 11, but recover
|ed himself. Out to redeem himself
{ Lloyd raced around left end for a
I 6-yard gain on the second play of
i the crucial series. It was third and
I 5 to go for a TD when Stanford's
! Bobby Anderson had bad luck and
i fumbled the ball on the 8. only to
have it recovered by OSC's Dick
j Lorenz. That ended the Indians'
most considerable threat of the af-
I ternoon, and not until late in the
fourth period did it look like Mar
| chic's boys were heading for pay
| dirt again.
The second period was mostly a
I see-saw affair as neither Beaver
nor Indian was able to penetrate
beyond their opponent's 40-yard
line when in possession of the ball.
It was in the third period that
Oregon State's threats came clos
est to paying off as the Beavers
started a sustained drive on their
own 41. Their back lie Id combina
tion of Tvvenge, Carpenter, and
Samuels was good for I first
downs that brought the Orange
and Black lads down to (he In
