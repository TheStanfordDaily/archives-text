# Bruins, Trojans Meet "Crucial' Foes
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 3 (UP).—Two Los Angeles football teams, both rolling toward a visit
to the Rose Bowl, dominate play in the Far West this week-end as they take on Pacific Coast Con
ference foes in another pair of "crucial" contests.

The undefeated UCLA Bruins,
who haven't been fully extended in
winning six encounters, travel north
to tackle Oregon. The USC Trojans
stay at home to entertain the un
predictable University of California
eleven.
These games will be the final
warm-ups for the important cross
town meeting between the Bruins
and Trojans Nov. 23. USC is idle
Nov. 16, while UCLA will be getting
a breather against Montana.
On the basis of their performances
yesterday the two Los Angeles en
tries are far and away the class of
the conference. While the Trojans
have been defeated twice (by Ohio
State and Oregon State), they have
come along fast in their last three
engagements. Yesterday the men of
Troy ran wild with a 43-0 slaughter
of previously unbeaten University
of Oregon.
That should spell ruin for Cali
fornia this coming Saturday, hut
Coach Frank Wickhorst's team, as
uncertain as the weather, either,
hits developed previously latent
talents, or drew a weak foe in
Washington State last week as
they won, 47-14.
In the game up north, UCLA faces
the Herculean task of trying to run
up as big a score as the Trojans did
against Oregon. It is doubtful if this
can be accomplished in the north
country.
Saturday will be a heavy day in
conference play, with Oregon State
drawing a breather against winless
Idaho at Corvallis; and Washington
visiting the Stanford campus.
Outside the conference, the play
also hits the season's peak. Among
the major independents University
of San Francisco meets Kansas State
at Kezar Stadium in an intersec
tional; powerful Nevada takes on
Santa Barbara State; Santa Clara
travels south to meet University of

Arizona at Tucson and St. Mary's is
idle.
Friday night College of Pacific is
host to San Jose State; and San Di
ego State plays Loyola in Los An
geles. In an Armistice Day game,
Fresno State entertains the Univer
sity of Hawaii.
