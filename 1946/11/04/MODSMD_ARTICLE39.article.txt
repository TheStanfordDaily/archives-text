# Tonight's Hot Jazz Session To Feature Turk Murphy
## 
### BUZZ LOBDELL 
Following its policy of bringing
in-pcrson jazz artists to the campus,
the Stanford Hot Jazz Society will
feature Turk Murphy, trombone
player, and Vivian Boarman, music
ciitic and record collector, in a ses
sion tonight in the "Y" rooms of the
Women's Clubhouse at 8 o'clock.
Tonight's program illustrates
the purpose of the club, that of
presenting jazz music and its cre
ators as one of America's genuine
contributions to musical culture.
Equipped with this belief in the
merit of hot music and spurred
on by student interest, two Stan
lord students, Joanne Shipp and
Jiianitn Moore, organized the club
during winter quarter of 1945.
Since its conception, the club has
provided its members with a con
venient method of exchanging their
opinions and records on jazz music.
Under the present leadership of Nan
Wright and Henry Russell, the so
ei"ty has formulated plans for a fu
ture jazz concert by student musi
cians.
The main attraction of tonight's
conclave is a familiar figure to
Stanford's jazz lovers since he is
one of the key men in the Lu
Walter Verba Bucna Jazz Band
which is currently making a stand
at the Dawn Club in San Fran
cisco.
Turk has played with the Watt'jr
group since its organization in San
Francisco before the war. On leave
from the Navy, he joined other
members of the band in backing the
N<'W Orleans cornetist, Bunk John
son, in several San Francisco jazz
concerts. Murphy plays a vigorous,
wide-open, tailgate trombone heav
ily influenced by Kid Ory, although
he has developed a distinctive style
of hi.s own.
A program or records will be pre
sented by Vivian Boarman from her
private collection and Bob Helm and
Hurry Mordecai, clarinet and banjo
players in Walter's band, may also
be present.
