SAN I' RANCISCO, Nov. 4 (UP). —Campaigning for the first postwar
general election was completed in California tonight and Republican con
fidence in victories nationally was matched against Democratic faith in
their .'J to 2 edge in Ihe voting registration in the slate.
The voting will decide contests for U.S. Senator, Attorney General, and
Lieutenant Governor, and elect 111 Congressmen, four Slate Senators, and
2.'5 Assemblymen. Ten Congressmen, 17 Slate Senators, and 57 Assembly
men were elected at the primary.
With Governor Earl Warren winning both major party nominations in
the primary, top interest was directed to the U.S. Senatorial contest. It
pitted William F. Knowland, Republican, appointed to the office by Warren
a year ago, against Will Rogers, Jr., Democrat, son of the late humorist.
A heavy vote, estimated at 70 per cent of the registration by Secretary
of State I' rank M. Jordan, was expected. That would mean that some
.'1,000.000 residents of the state would turn out, since 4,38.'5,9G3 are regis
tered.
The race for Lieutenant Governor also took on added significance as a
result of Warren's primary victory. The victory strengthened belief that
Warren would be a national candidate in JSMB and that the Lieutenant
Governor elected tomorrow would succeed to the governorship.
Also on the long ballot confronting voters were 17 propositions. High
est interest was evident in No. 2, to legalize dog racing, and No. 11, to sot
up a Fair Employment Practices Commission.
i:i CONGRESS SKATS
Of the 1.5 Congress scats at stake, 10 now are held by Democrats and
three by Republicans. The Republicans believed they had their best
chances in the Fourth District in San Francisco, the Seventh in Alameda
County, and the Fourteenth in Los Angeles County.

NEW YORK, Nov, 5 (UP). —The United States votes a new Congress
into power today. Political opinion and countrywide straw ballots in
dicate that the Republicans will win control of the House and cut sharply
into Democratic strength in the Senate.
The entire membership of the House and one-third of the Senate are
at stake in this first, post-war election —the first since the late Franklin D.
Roosevelt ran against Thornns E. Dcwcy for a fourth term in 1014.
REPUBLICANS TRY FOR 20 SEATS
Republican:; must win 2(5 House seats and 10 Senate posts to control
the 80th Congress. They are confident of a House victory, but aren't
claiming more than an even break in the Senate. Most political observers
agree.
The key slates in the election are cxpected to be largely in the East.
Republicans are claiming a Senate victory in New York, Ohio. Pennsyl
vania, and Massachusetts, and think they have better than an even chance
of picking up Senate seats in Delaware, West Virginia, Maryland, and
Rhode Island.
DEMOCRATS EXPECT WEST HOLD
West of the Mississippi, Democrats claim they'll hold their lines, despite
strong Republican efforts to win in Now Mexico, Washington, Missouri,
and California. Democrats predict they'll pick up at least two Senate
seats- Kentucky and California—but Republicans contend they'll offset
those with victories elsewhere.
Some observers think the Senate race will result in a tie —48 Republi
cans and 48 Democrats. Should this happen, a major fight, would develop
over Senate organization. The country has no Vice-President, now, which
means that the Senate must elect its own presiding officer for the next,
two years.
