## 
### 
The effects of war in the German
occupied areas and the courage and
patience with which the helpless
people of Europe and China endured
and fought back the forces of Fas
cism were the topics vividly brought
out by student speakers participat
ing in the"I was there" program of
"I" Club.
A 1 Strain headed the panel of stu
dent speakers. He and three other
Stanford students who also attend
ed the meeting, travelled in Europe
this summer and took some horses
to Poland in relief work.
With the help of colored slides
Al Strain brought home to the
audience the terrible destruction
which Poland underwent under
the Nazi rule. Describing the
present conditions, he said "the
Polish people have no houses,
practically no clothes and very
little to eat. Most of the people
are underfed, and due to the Nazi
rule all children arc under-nour
ished.
He showed a photograph of a typi
cal Pole family and surprised every
body in saying that the boy who
looked about three was really eight
years old. "Two out of three Pole
children suffer from tuberculosis,
but under existing conditions only
one out of one thousand patients can
be given medical aid," Strain said.
He showed some slides of present
day America with its holiday re
sorts and swimming pools and stat
ed, "Is it not a challenge to our ci
vilization that so big a difference in
standards of living should exist l>e
tween two countries which are sep
arated by only a ten days journey
by sea and a ten-hour flight by air!"
!Vlarie-Josc de Saint Hlanquat
from France and Kary Fischer
from Czechoslovakia spoke about
the underground movements in
their countries and the role that
students played in them.
