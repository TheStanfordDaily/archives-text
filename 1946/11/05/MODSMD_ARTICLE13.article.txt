Calling for the friendship and
confidence of the American people,
Dr. Karl Gruber, Austrian Minister
of Foreign Affairs, told his audi
enc in Cubberley Auditorium yes
terday afternoon that his country
needs help in its struggle for inde
pendence.
"A universal system is the only
one to give the little state a chance;
we must have a new universal sys
tem which will allow free trade,
abolish customs barriers, and solve
the problems of currency and divi
sion of labor," he said.
The 37-year-old diplomat, war
time leader of the Austrian under
ground, spoke critically of the four •
power division in Europe.
"Such a division might work
when there are unified views, but
with different philosophies repre
sented the difficulties increase."
In outlining the difficulties his
country faces, Dr. Gruber discussed
the drain of occupation forces on
Austria. He explained that 30 per
cei)t. of the budget goes for the sup
port of occupying armies and that
of this 50 per cent goes to the Rus
sians.
The Austrian Foreign Minister
emphasized that Austria's record
under Nazi domination is no better
and no worse than that of other
countries overrun by Germany.
Discussing the current problem
of denazification. Dr. Gruber said,
"House cleaning will not be
enough: the fight against fascism
is a moral issue. We must give
the-people something positive; we
must prove that democracy is
worth more than dictatorship."
The former underground leader
pointed out the strategic location of
Austria in the European tinderbox.
"It divides the Slavic peoples from
the peoples of Western Europe; it
separates Germany and Italy; and
it is a cultural and intellectual cen
ter."
Sp"aking of conflicts in ideology,
Dr. Gruber said, "I want the deci
sion for a change in the economic
system of my country to come from
the people themselves. No system
must, be forced on them."
Dr. Gruber was introduced by
President Donald B. Tresidder.
Making a swing through the
West with Dr. Gruber is the Aus
trian ambassador to Washington,
Dr. Eudwig von Kleinwaeehter.

Bay Area.
Calling for the friendship and
confidence of the American people,
Dr. Karl Gruber, Austrian Minister
of Foreign Affairs, told his audi
enc in Cubberley Auditorium yes
terday afternoon that his country
needs help in its struggle for inde
pendence.
"A universal system is the only
one to give the little state a chance;
we must have a new universal sys
tem which will allow free trade,
abolish customs barriers, and solve
the problems of currency and divi
sion of labor," he said.
The 37-year-old diplomat, war
time leader of the Austrian under
ground, spoke critically of the four •
power division in Europe.
"Such a division might work
when there are unified views, but
with different philosophies repre
sented the difficulties increase."
In outlining the difficulties his
country faces, Dr. Gruber discussed
the drain of occupation forces on
Austria. He explained that 30 per
cei)t. of the budget goes for the sup
port of occupying armies and that
of this 50 per cent goes to the Rus
sians.
The Austrian Foreign Minister
emphasized that Austria's record
under Nazi domination is no better
and no worse than that of other
countries overrun by Germany.
Discussing the current problem
of denazification. Dr. Gruber said,
"House cleaning will not be
enough: the fight against fascism
is a moral issue. We must give
the-people something positive; we
must prove that democracy is
worth more than dictatorship."
The former underground leader
pointed out the strategic location of
Austria in the European tinderbox.
"It divides the Slavic peoples from
the peoples of Western Europe; it
separates Germany and Italy; and
it is a cultural and intellectual cen
ter."
Sp"aking of conflicts in ideology,
Dr. Gruber said, "I want the deci
sion for a change in the economic
system of my country to come from
the people themselves. No system
must, be forced on them."
Dr. Gruber was introduced by
President Donald B. Tresidder.
Making a swing through the
West with Dr. Gruber is the Aus
trian ambassador to Washington,
Dr. Eudwig von Kleinwaeehter.
The two diplomats (lew to I-os
Angeles from New York last week
and are spending this week in the
Bay Area.
