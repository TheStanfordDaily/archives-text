# Reports on Earnings Due from Vets Today
## 
### 
Today is the last day for veter
ans to report on their earnings
for August, September, and Octo
ber. Failure to file this report
will probably result in not re
ceiving the subsistence check for
November, according to George
Barahal, veterans' director.
The slips which were included
in the October checks for re
porting income from "productive
labor" should be left with the
Veterans Administration, second
floor of the Administration Build
ing. or forwarded to the regional
olfice.
Slips were also included in the
September checks of veterans at
tending summer quarter. If these
have been filed previously, it is
not necessary to file again.
If the single veteran's monthly
earnings do not exceed $175 or the
married veteran's $200, there will
be no deduction. However, re
gardless of total income, the re
port must be made. Hashers who
work for their meals must esti
mate their earnings.
