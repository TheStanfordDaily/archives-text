## Cast Ballot Today! 
### 
In the first peace time general election
since 1940, more than 4,300,000 California
voters will today elect state, district and
county officials, their senator and representa
tive, and decide on 17 state propositions.
Stanford voters, according to where they
registered, will cast their ballots at the Old
Union Nitery or the Stanford Elementary
School, or one of the 43 polling places in Palo
Alto.
Only one definite fact stands out among
the confusion of the campaigns:
The citizen who v/ill not take time to vote
today can blame himself in part for conditions
later which do not suit him.
The attitude that "one vote more or less
doesn't matter" is just the attitude that tears

down the value of a representative system and
enables organized minorities to dominate the
majority.
The chances are that a person who takes
the stand now that because he is in college
and not directly concerned with civil life and
therefore is not qualified to express an opin
ion, will also in later life, when working with
a particular firm and generally confining his
activities to one community, take a stand-off
ish attitude toward elections outside his own
immediate scope.
The pleasure of living under a democratic
government carries with it the responsibility
of concerning ourselves about candidates
whose election will affect us either directly
or indirectly.â€”N.W.
