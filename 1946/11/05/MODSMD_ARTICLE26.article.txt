To the Editor:
Mr. Dan Page, in his article in Thursday's Daily
concerning conditions at Harvard University under
the pressure of increased enrollment, temporarily
digresses from the subject to include a paragraph on
lhi' absence of honor at that university. From the
existence of the examination-proctor system at Har
vard he draws the conclusion that honor at Harvard
leaves much to be desired.
Any student worthy of the name today, at Har
vard or anywhere else, would declare that the exam
ination-procU.r system is an educational anachro
nism. and as such, indefensible. 1 cannot see that its
continued piesence in many universities at the pres
ent time .should cast any reflection upon their stu
ck ill bodies. To say that it does thus reflect is to my
w.y of thinking a palpably unfair generalization.

A lew mild observations on Ted Norton's article
the other morn in .;, in regard to OPA removal—
1. Since when does .'»() per cent, or less, of popular
opinion, plus a powerfully backed lobby in Wash
ington. constitute popular opinion? By actual poll,
70 to 80 per cent of the public wanted continuance
of OPA.
2. The National Association of Manufacturers
spent several hundred thousand dollars in its battle
against OPA. Meat packers are buying up huge
tracts of land on which to hold animals for some
time, obviously not until prices get lower. The cost
ol living, by conservative estimate, has gone up 10
per cent since the lid was first taken off on July 1.
In vi .'W of all these facts, it can surely be seen that
the widely circulated rumor that only price control
stands in the way of stabilization of prices is a well
formulated fiction. Those who fought price control
did so, not for the good of the public they
would have us believe, but for the good own
pocket boo ks. The short-sighted
Mr. Norton praises so highly are going to find that
they cannot plunge this country into disaster without
themselves being sucked up in what they have cre
ated.

At their luncheon meeting last Tuesday, the
members of Klahoya nominated Ramona "Randy"
Walker as off-campus representative on Excom.
Since Klahoya is the only organized group of off
campus women, the members were eager to support
a woman from their group who could represent them
as well as the off-campus students at large.
In order that other off-campus women may meet
her, Klahoya wishes to extend an invitation to
all women living outside the campus residences and
the Village to its luncheon meeting Tuesday noon,
today, in the Lower Lounge of the Women's Club
hou.-.\ Because of our limited space and facilities,
we are unable to include the men, but we sincerely
hope that all off-campus women will take advantage
of this opportunity to meet our candidate:
Student elections constitute a vital part of campus
government and give the opportunity to select ca
pable leaders and representatives. Certainly to vote
intelligently we should meet the candidates and be
come familiar with their background and experience
as well as the principles for which they stand.
Cordially yours,
Marianna Olmstead
President of Klahoya
On? of the issues developing in the current cam
paign is "Electioneering." As a candidate, I stand
unalterably opposed to any change in the existing
restrictions oh campaigning.
My campaign is one of meeting with the voters
of my district and discussing sanely and intelligently
the issues of the campaign. I'm against mounting a
stump and making wild promises. I'm against allow
ing expenditures on posters and throw-aways, since
such measures do not provide the voters with any
truer understanding of the character of the candi
dates.
A change in the A.S.S.U. constitution would cer
tainly add a note of realism to campus elections, but
I feel that it is a cigar and clollar-vote realism, a
realism of the type Stanford can get along very well
without.

Mr. Dan Page, in his article in Thursday's Daily
concerning conditions at Harvard University under
the pressure of increased enrollment, temporarily
digresses from the subject to include a paragraph on
lhi' absence of honor at that university. From the
existence of the examination-proctor system at Har
vard he draws the conclusion that honor at Harvard
leaves much to be desired.
Any student worthy of the name today, at Har
vard or anywhere else, would declare that the exam
ination-procU.r system is an educational anachro
nism. and as such, indefensible. 1 cannot see that its
continued piesence in many universities at the pres

A lew mild observations on Ted Norton's article
the other morn in .;, in regard to OPA removal—
1. Since when does .'»() per cent, or less, of popular
opinion, plus a powerfully backed lobby in Wash
ington. constitute popular opinion? By actual poll,
70 to 80 per cent of the public wanted continuance
of OPA.
2. The National Association of Manufacturers
spent several hundred thousand dollars in its battle
against OPA. Meat packers are buying up huge
tracts of land on which to hold animals for some
time, obviously not until prices get lower. The cost
ol living, by conservative estimate, has gone up 10
per cent since the lid was first taken off on July 1.
In vi .'W of all these facts, it can surely be seen that
the widely circulated rumor that only price control
stands in the way of stabilization of prices is a well
formulated fiction. Those who fought price control
did so, not for the good of the public they
would have us believe, but for the good own
pocket boo ks. The short-sighted
Mr. Norton praises so highly are going to find that
they cannot plunge this country into disaster without
themselves being sucked up in what they have cre
ated.

At their luncheon meeting last Tuesday, the
members of Klahoya nominated Ramona "Randy"
Walker as off-campus representative on Excom.
Since Klahoya is the only organized group of off
campus women, the members were eager to support
a woman from their group who could represent them
as well as the off-campus students at large.
In order that other off-campus women may meet
her, Klahoya wishes to extend an invitation to
all women living outside the campus residences and
the Village to its luncheon meeting Tuesday noon,
today, in the Lower Lounge of the Women's Club
hou.-.\ Because of our limited space and facilities,
we are unable to include the men, but we sincerely
hope that all off-campus women will take advantage
of this opportunity to meet our candidate:
Student elections constitute a vital part of campus
government and give the opportunity to select ca
pable leaders and representatives. Certainly to vote
intelligently we should meet the candidates and be
come familiar with their background and experience
as well as the principles for which they stand.
