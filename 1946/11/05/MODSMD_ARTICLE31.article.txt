It was such a lovely day; I got up at the crack of dawn. Dawn, you
know, cracks at about 9:45 a.m. at Dibble. (Ed. note: He means Stanford
Village). 1 jumped out of bed and ran into the shower room, then I ran
back to bed. Don't exert yourself, the doctor said, and I don't. Think I'll
drop around and see Marchie, I said to mys •If; it's a good idea (this is still
me talking). So I did.
"Can I go up to the football luncheon with you?" "Glad to have you."
So I went. The fried chicken was very good. So were some of the com
ments offered.
First man up was Joe Verducci of Poly (a high school, stupid). "We
play our 'Big Game against Lowell (yeah, another high school) Armistice
Day. It's only a high school game, but since it's only 60 cents for adults,
you can't go wrong. And these games usually wind up as a better contest
than some you pay $3. GO for."
Mike Voyne of Lowell was next up, "We've got a team that could
compare With the pros for size, not a little team like Joe has, but after
the ball's snapped you'll see they're strictly high school. But high school
kids have a lot of spirit, and they never give up."
Wendell Broyle of Washington took the lloor, and for a tub-thumper
he didn't do very good. All he said was, "Arnie Weim u'ister, our great
fullback prospect who has been injured all season, will probably play at
tackle against Stanford Saturday. His leg will stand up better there.
Sam Robinson will probably start at full for us."
Jimmy Phelan of St. Mary's was the next man to open up, to wit:
"U.C.L.A. is a good team, and frankly, 112 don't know how to beat 'em.
They have a lot of men down there, and they're all good. They have two
great tackles in Chambers and Malmberg; one of the finest ends in (he
country in Burr Baldwin—and their other ends are exceptional. In Don
Paul they have one of the finest centers in the West, and their guards are
good too.
"In the backfield, Ernie Case is their wheelhorse, quarterbacking from
the T, and is the most important man. Shipkey is next at right half, and
Myers at fullback. They have any number of scatbacks—Ernie Johnston,
Rowland, Roasch, and others. They used 51 players against us and they
were all good.
"Comparing them with U.S.C'., whom I saw play four times, I would
say that from tackle to tackle they're about even. The Bruin ends are a
lot better and there is no comparing the backfields. the Bruins being
that nr.ch better."
Phelan then went on to add: "At the next meeting of the coaches'
football rules committee, I'm going to recommend that the rule regarding
a blocked punt be changed. There's too much chance of a kid getting hurt
in a pileup. lt d be better if the ball was regarded as having been fum
bled."
Dick Friendlich of the Chronicle (rah!) askecl Phelan whom he would
prefer to have on his team, Baldwin or Nevada's Gillom.
"I'd take Baldwin. Gillom is a tremendous end, with his kicking, block
ing, and pass catching, but Baldwin is as good and is better,on defense.
"About my own team I'd like to say this: We played a rough game Sun
day and an even rougher one Friday of the same week. Weclemeyer played
almost 60 minutes in both games and you couldn't ask any more of any
body."
San Francisco State's Dick Boyle got a good laugh by telling the boys
how warm if was at Seals' Stadium, last Friday.
Our boy Marchie pitched the next inning. "I don't want to talk about
Oregon State—that's behind us. ! want to talk abou this hot and cold
Washington club. I think they'll be hot for us. Jimmy Phelan said
they're good, and my scout Ray Hammelt says the personnel is very
good, and Pest's team possesses great potentialities.
"Provo, Hatch, Biddle, and Robinson are very good in the backfield.
They have a good passing attack, but mostly they run—and they run very
well. Their pass defense is slightly terrific; against Cal and W.S.C. they
allowed three completions and intercepted seven. That's pretty good.
"They run from the T with the flanker already out or from the box
with a man in motion, and they also run and pass from the punt forma
tion. This stuff is getting pretty technical, so we'll go back to the men.
"This Dick Hagen—it says here—is impossible to run around, he's
that good. McGovern the center is a fine line backer except that he's
hot-headed and rough . . . oops. And they've got a good line. We expect
Weinmeister at fullback. lie's best at that spot and we're planning our
defense for him there. If he plays tackle, we haven't lost anything.
"Ottele and Hempstead are good quarters, Provo is a very good half,
and si)j is Hatch. Austin is another good man, but he's weak at —oh, oh,
I shouldn't have said that.
"For ourselves, Popsy Keblusek the guard was lost until he showed
up this morning and told me his leg was okeh. Gene Martin hurt his in
jured ankle again, and unless he's in tip-top shape, he won't play.
'"As far as the game up north is concerned, it was just as hard for
Oregon State as it was for us. We both had two or three scoring chances
but couldn't make it. Usually a scoreless tie is pretty futile, but people
came up after the game and told me that they had never seen a better
scoreless tie."
The "boy coach" wound it up with: "We expect the Huskies to be hot
when they meef us. We're improving weekly and we haven't reached our
peak yet."
C.O.P.'s Art Farcy tolcl about Hawaii's tricky offense and the wonder
show they put on. "They're not fast so much as they're tricky." And he
told of the ovation Amos Alonzo Stagg got back in Chicago. Over 200
men he had coached while back East feted him, and among them were 18
season captains.
The Broncos' Len Casanova was next: "Forrest Hall was the most dan
gerous back we faced all season. We also lost Bill Prentice again with
the same ankle injury." (Buzz McGee of the '49-ers took over here to
whisper to us; "In the pros a man isn't injured until he's flat on his back
in a cast.")
Cal's Frank Wiokhorst came on then and agreed with Phelan about the
blocked kick rule change. "We weren't that good against Washington State,
and they're not that bad. It just happened that we could do no wrong.

"We used 40 men, i'.nd Harry Da- j -
vis (Memorial Stadium nose coun
ter) told me he saw me looking
around and ducked out of sight be
fore I put him in."
Wick went on: "I want to add
that we've got to give a lot of credit
to the veterans playing this year
That's why these teams are hot and
cold. They lose one week and the
next they're right back in there.
"The Trojans are big. but Cal may
do it."

the T, and is the most important man. Shipkey is next at right half, and
Myers at fullback. They have any number of scatbacks—Ernie Johnston,
Rowland, Roasch, and others. They used 51 players against us and they
were all good.
"Comparing them with U.S.C'., whom I saw play four times, I would
say that from tackle to tackle they're about even. The Bruin ends are a
lot better and there is no comparing the backfields. the Bruins being
that nr.ch better."
Phelan then went on to add: "At the next meeting of the coaches'
football rules committee, I'm going to recommend that the rule regarding
a blocked punt be changed. There's too much chance of a kid getting hurt
in a pileup. lt d be better if the ball was regarded as having been fum
bled."
Dick Friendlich of the Chronicle (rah!) askecl Phelan whom he would
prefer to have on his team, Baldwin or Nevada's Gillom.
"I'd take Baldwin. Gillom is a tremendous end, with his kicking, block
ing, and pass catching, but Baldwin is as good and is better,on defense.
"About my own team I'd like to say this: We played a rough game Sun
day and an even rougher one Friday of the same week. Weclemeyer played
almost 60 minutes in both games and you couldn't ask any more of any
body."
San Francisco State's Dick Boyle got a good laugh by telling the boys
how warm if was at Seals' Stadium, last Friday.
Our boy Marchie pitched the next inning. "I don't want to talk about
Oregon State—that's behind us. ! want to talk abou this hot and cold
Washington club. I think they'll be hot for us. Jimmy Phelan said
they're good, and my scout Ray Hammelt says the personnel is very
good, and Pest's team possesses great potentialities.
"Provo, Hatch, Biddle, and Robinson are very good in the backfield.
They have a good passing attack, but mostly they run—and they run very
well. Their pass defense is slightly terrific; against Cal and W.S.C. they
allowed three completions and intercepted seven. That's pretty good.
"They run from the T with the flanker already out or from the box
with a man in motion, and they also run and pass from the punt forma
tion. This stuff is getting pretty technical, so we'll go back to the men.
"This Dick Hagen—it says here—is impossible to run around, he's
that good. McGovern the center is a fine line backer except that he's
hot-headed and rough . . . oops. And they've got a good line. We expect
Weinmeister at fullback. lie's best at that spot and we're planning our
defense for him there. If he plays tackle, we haven't lost anything.
"Ottele and Hempstead are good quarters, Provo is a very good half,
and si)j is Hatch. Austin is another good man, but he's weak at —oh, oh,
I shouldn't have said that.
"For ourselves, Popsy Keblusek the guard was lost until he showed
up this morning and told me his leg was okeh. Gene Martin hurt his in
jured ankle again, and unless he's in tip-top shape, he won't play.
'"As far as the game up north is concerned, it was just as hard for
Oregon State as it was for us. We both had two or three scoring chances
but couldn't make it. Usually a scoreless tie is pretty futile, but people
came up after the game and told me that they had never seen a better
scoreless tie."
The "boy coach" wound it up with: "We expect the Huskies to be hot
when they meef us. We're improving weekly and we haven't reached our
peak yet."
C.O.P.'s Art Farcy tolcl about Hawaii's tricky offense and the wonder
show they put on. "They're not fast so much as they're tricky." And he
told of the ovation Amos Alonzo Stagg got back in Chicago. Over 200
men he had coached while back East feted him, and among them were 18
season captains.
The Broncos' Len Casanova was next: "Forrest Hall was the most dan
gerous back we faced all season. We also lost Bill Prentice again with
the same ankle injury." (Buzz McGee of the '49-ers took over here to
whisper to us; "In the pros a man isn't injured until he's flat on his back
in a cast.")
Cal's Frank Wiokhorst came on then and agreed with Phelan about the
blocked kick rule change. "We weren't that good against Washington State,
and they're not that bad. It just happened that we could do no wrong.

"We used 40 men, i'.nd Harry Da- j -
vis (Memorial Stadium nose coun
ter) told me he saw me looking
around and ducked out of sight be
fore I put him in."
Wick went on: "I want to add
that we've got to give a lot of credit
to the veterans playing this year
That's why these teams are hot and
cold. They lose one week and the
next they're right back in there.
"The Trojans are big. but Cal may
do it."
It was such a lovely day; I got up at the crack of dawn. Dawn, you
know, cracks at about 9:45 a.m. at Dibble. (Ed. note: He means Stanford
Village). 1 jumped out of bed and ran into the shower room, then I ran
back to bed. Don't exert yourself, the doctor said, and I don't. Think I'll
drop around and see Marchie, I said to mys •If; it's a good idea (this is still
me talking). So I did.
"Can I go up to the football luncheon with you?" "Glad to have you."
So I went. The fried chicken was very good. So were some of the com
ments offered.
First man up was Joe Verducci of Poly (a high school, stupid). "We
play our 'Big Game against Lowell (yeah, another high school) Armistice
Day. It's only a high school game, but since it's only 60 cents for adults,
you can't go wrong. And these games usually wind up as a better contest
than some you pay $3. GO for."
Mike Voyne of Lowell was next up, "We've got a team that could
compare With the pros for size, not a little team like Joe has, but after
the ball's snapped you'll see they're strictly high school. But high school
kids have a lot of spirit, and they never give up."
Wendell Broyle of Washington took the lloor, and for a tub-thumper
he didn't do very good. All he said was, "Arnie Weim u'ister, our great
fullback prospect who has been injured all season, will probably play at
tackle against Stanford Saturday. His leg will stand up better there.
Sam Robinson will probably start at full for us."
Jimmy Phelan of St. Mary's was the next man to open up, to wit:
"U.C.L.A. is a good team, and frankly, 112 don't know how to beat 'em.
They have a lot of men down there, and they're all good. They have two
great tackles in Chambers and Malmberg; one of the finest ends in (he
country in Burr Baldwin—and their other ends are exceptional. In Don
Paul they have one of the finest centers in the West, and their guards are
good too.
"In the backfield, Ernie Case is their wheelhorse, quarterbacking from

scoreless tie."
The "boy coach" wound it up with: "We expect the Huskies to be hot

peak yet."
C.O.P.'s Art Farcy tolcl about Hawaii's tricky offense and the wonder
show they put on. "They're not fast so much as they're tricky." And he
told of the ovation Amos Alonzo Stagg got back in Chicago. Over 200
men he had coached while back East feted him, and among them were 18
season captains.
The Broncos' Len Casanova was next: "Forrest Hall was the most dan
gerous back we faced all season. We also lost Bill Prentice again with
the same ankle injury." (Buzz McGee of the '49-ers took over here to
whisper to us; "In the pros a man isn't injured until he's flat on his back
in a cast.")
Cal's Frank Wiokhorst came on then and agreed with Phelan about the
blocked kick rule change. "We weren't that good against Washington State,
and they're not that bad. It just happened that we could do no wrong.

"We used 40 men, i'.nd Harry Da- j -
vis (Memorial Stadium nose coun
ter) told me he saw me looking
around and ducked out of sight be

Wick went on: "I want to add
that we've got to give a lot of credit
to the veterans playing this year
That's why these teams are hot and
cold. They lose one week and the
next they're right back in there.
"The Trojans are big. but Cal may
do it."
It was such a lovely day; I got up at the crack of dawn. Dawn, you
know, cracks at about 9:45 a.m. at Dibble. (Ed. note: He means Stanford
Village). 1 jumped out of bed and ran into the shower room, then I ran
back to bed. Don't exert yourself, the doctor said, and I don't. Think I'll
drop around and see Marchie, I said to mys •If; it's a good idea (this is still
me talking). So I did.
"Can I go up to the football luncheon with you?" "Glad to have you."
So I went. The fried chicken was very good. So were some of the com
ments offered.
First man up was Joe Verducci of Poly (a high school, stupid). "We
play our 'Big Game against Lowell (yeah, another high school) Armistice
Day. It's only a high school game, but since it's only 60 cents for adults,
you can't go wrong. And these games usually wind up as a better contest
than some you pay $3. GO for."
Mike Voyne of Lowell was next up, "We've got a team that could
compare With the pros for size, not a little team like Joe has, but after
the ball's snapped you'll see they're strictly high school. But high school
kids have a lot of spirit, and they never give up."
Wendell Broyle of Washington took the lloor, and for a tub-thumper
he didn't do very good. All he said was, "Arnie Weim u'ister, our great
fullback prospect who has been injured all season, will probably play at
tackle against Stanford Saturday. His leg will stand up better there.
Sam Robinson will probably start at full for us."
Jimmy Phelan of St. Mary's was the next man to open up, to wit:
"U.C.L.A. is a good team, and frankly, 112 don't know how to beat 'em.
They have a lot of men down there, and they're all good. They have two
great tackles in Chambers and Malmberg; one of the finest ends in (he
country in Burr Baldwin—and their other ends are exceptional. In Don
Paul they have one of the finest centers in the West, and their guards are
good too.
"In the backfield, Ernie Case is their wheelhorse, quarterbacking from
the T, and is the most important man. Shipkey is next at right half, and
Myers at fullback. They have any number of scatbacks—Ernie Johnston,
Rowland, Roasch, and others. They used 51 players against us and they
were all good.
"Comparing them with U.S.C'., whom I saw play four times, I would
say that from tackle to tackle they're about even. The Bruin ends are a
lot better and there is no comparing the backfields. the Bruins being
that nr.ch better."
Phelan then went on to add: "At the next meeting of the coaches'
football rules committee, I'm going to recommend that the rule regarding
a blocked punt be changed. There's too much chance of a kid getting hurt
in a pileup. lt d be better if the ball was regarded as having been fum
bled."
Dick Friendlich of the Chronicle (rah!) askecl Phelan whom he would
prefer to have on his team, Baldwin or Nevada's Gillom.
"I'd take Baldwin. Gillom is a tremendous end, with his kicking, block
ing, and pass catching, but Baldwin is as good and is better,on defense.
"About my own team I'd like to say this: We played a rough game Sun
day and an even rougher one Friday of the same week. Weclemeyer played
almost 60 minutes in both games and you couldn't ask any more of any
body."
San Francisco State's Dick Boyle got a good laugh by telling the boys
how warm if was at Seals' Stadium, last Friday.
Our boy Marchie pitched the next inning. "I don't want to talk about
Oregon State—that's behind us. ! want to talk abou this hot and cold
Washington club. I think they'll be hot for us. Jimmy Phelan said
they're good, and my scout Ray Hammelt says the personnel is very
good, and Pest's team possesses great potentialities.
"Provo, Hatch, Biddle, and Robinson are very good in the backfield.
They have a good passing attack, but mostly they run—and they run very
well. Their pass defense is slightly terrific; against Cal and W.S.C. they
allowed three completions and intercepted seven. That's pretty good.

Cal's Frank Wiokhorst came on then and agreed with Phelan about the
blocked kick rule change. "We weren't that good against Washington State,
and they're not that bad. It just happened that we could do no wrong.

"We used 40 men, i'.nd Harry Da- j -
vis (Memorial Stadium nose coun
ter) told me he saw me looking
around and ducked out of sight be
fore I put him in."
Wick went on: "I want to add
that we've got to give a lot of credit
to the veterans playing this year
That's why these teams are hot and
cold. They lose one week and the
next they're right back in there.
"The Trojans are big. but Cal may
do it."
It was such a lovely day; I got up at the crack of dawn. Dawn, you
know, cracks at about 9:45 a.m. at Dibble. (Ed. note: He means Stanford
Village). 1 jumped out of bed and ran into the shower room, then I ran
back to bed. Don't exert yourself, the doctor said, and I don't. Think I'll
drop around and see Marchie, I said to mys •If; it's a good idea (this is still
me talking). So I did.
"Can I go up to the football luncheon with you?" "Glad to have you."
So I went. The fried chicken was very good. So were some of the com
ments offered.
First man up was Joe Verducci of Poly (a high school, stupid). "We
play our 'Big Game against Lowell (yeah, another high school) Armistice
Day. It's only a high school game, but since it's only 60 cents for adults,
you can't go wrong. And these games usually wind up as a better contest
than some you pay $3. GO for."
Mike Voyne of Lowell was next up, "We've got a team that could
compare With the pros for size, not a little team like Joe has, but after
the ball's snapped you'll see they're strictly high school. But high school
kids have a lot of spirit, and they never give up."
Wendell Broyle of Washington took the lloor, and for a tub-thumper
he didn't do very good. All he said was, "Arnie Weim u'ister, our great
fullback prospect who has been injured all season, will probably play at
tackle against Stanford Saturday. His leg will stand up better there.
Sam Robinson will probably start at full for us."
Jimmy Phelan of St. Mary's was the next man to open up, to wit:
"U.C.L.A. is a good team, and frankly, 112 don't know how to beat 'em.
They have a lot of men down there, and they're all good. They have two
great tackles in Chambers and Malmberg; one of the finest ends in (he
country in Burr Baldwin—and their other ends are exceptional. In Don
Paul they have one of the finest centers in the West, and their guards are
good too.
"In the backfield, Ernie Case is their wheelhorse, quarterbacking from
the T, and is the most important man. Shipkey is next at right half, and
Myers at fullback. They have any number of scatbacks—Ernie Johnston,
Rowland, Roasch, and others. They used 51 players against us and they
were all good.
"Comparing them with U.S.C'., whom I saw play four times, I would
say that from tackle to tackle they're about even. The Bruin ends are a
lot better and there is no comparing the backfields. the Bruins being
that nr.ch better."
Phelan then went on to add: "At the next meeting of the coaches'
football rules committee, I'm going to recommend that the rule regarding
a blocked punt be changed. There's too much chance of a kid getting hurt
in a pileup. lt d be better if the ball was regarded as having been fum
bled."
Dick Friendlich of the Chronicle (rah!) askecl Phelan whom he would
prefer to have on his team, Baldwin or Nevada's Gillom.
"I'd take Baldwin. Gillom is a tremendous end, with his kicking, block
ing, and pass catching, but Baldwin is as good and is better,on defense.
"About my own team I'd like to say this: We played a rough game Sun
day and an even rougher one Friday of the same week. Weclemeyer played
almost 60 minutes in both games and you couldn't ask any more of any
body."
San Francisco State's Dick Boyle got a good laugh by telling the boys
how warm if was at Seals' Stadium, last Friday.
Our boy Marchie pitched the next inning. "I don't want to talk about
Oregon State—that's behind us. ! want to talk abou this hot and cold
Washington club. I think they'll be hot for us. Jimmy Phelan said
they're good, and my scout Ray Hammelt says the personnel is very
good, and Pest's team possesses great potentialities.
"Provo, Hatch, Biddle, and Robinson are very good in the backfield.
They have a good passing attack, but mostly they run—and they run very
well. Their pass defense is slightly terrific; against Cal and W.S.C. they
allowed three completions and intercepted seven. That's pretty good.
"They run from the T with the flanker already out or from the box
with a man in motion, and they also run and pass from the punt forma
tion. This stuff is getting pretty technical, so we'll go back to the men.
"This Dick Hagen—it says here—is impossible to run around, he's
that good. McGovern the center is a fine line backer except that he's
hot-headed and rough . . . oops. And they've got a good line. We expect
Weinmeister at fullback. lie's best at that spot and we're planning our
defense for him there. If he plays tackle, we haven't lost anything.
"Ottele and Hempstead are good quarters, Provo is a very good half,
and si)j is Hatch. Austin is another good man, but he's weak at —oh, oh,
I shouldn't have said that.
"For ourselves, Popsy Keblusek the guard was lost until he showed
up this morning and told me his leg was okeh. Gene Martin hurt his in
jured ankle again, and unless he's in tip-top shape, he won't play.
'"As far as the game up north is concerned, it was just as hard for
Oregon State as it was for us. We both had two or three scoring chances
but couldn't make it. Usually a scoreless tie is pretty futile, but people
came up after the game and told me that they had never seen a better
scoreless tie."
The "boy coach" wound it up with: "We expect the Huskies to be hot
when they meef us. We're improving weekly and we haven't reached our
peak yet."
C.O.P.'s Art Farcy tolcl about Hawaii's tricky offense and the wonder
show they put on. "They're not fast so much as they're tricky." And he
told of the ovation Amos Alonzo Stagg got back in Chicago. Over 200
men he had coached while back East feted him, and among them were 18
season captains.
The Broncos' Len Casanova was next: "Forrest Hall was the most dan
gerous back we faced all season. We also lost Bill Prentice again with
the same ankle injury." (Buzz McGee of the '49-ers took over here to
whisper to us; "In the pros a man isn't injured until he's flat on his back
in a cast.")
