A week ago, Nevada officials re
quested Noble to explain a refer
ence to "an unfortunate commotion"
in a letter from officials of the j
Southern college apparently refer
ring to Nevada's intention of play
ing the two colored stars.
Today, they received the follow
ing telegram from Noble:
"ft is not the custom in the South
for members of the Negro race to I
compete in athletics with or against
members of the white race nor
members of the white race to com
pete against members of the Negro |
race in athletic contests.
McDonnell immediately convened j
the Board of Athletic Control which
shortly thereafter canceled the
game.
In a telegram to Noble, the board
declared: "After due consideration j
of your letter and wire and after
receiving legal advice, we are of the
opinion that it is impossible for us
to reach any agreement. There- j
fore, we have voted to cancel our ;
game with no penalty to accrue to !
either school."
Hundreds of letters and telegrams
concerning the racial dispute have
reached University officials, the
overwhelming majority urging that
Nevada cancel the game.
Sentiment among the 1,700 mem
bers of the Nevada student body, 75
per cent of them former G.l.'s, was
reported to be 100 per cent behind
the cancellation move.
