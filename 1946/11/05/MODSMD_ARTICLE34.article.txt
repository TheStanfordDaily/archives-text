# Jayvees Prep For Cal Aggies
## 
### 
Coach Ed Stamm and his junior
varsity footballers are knuckling
down to a week of hard work be
fore traveling up tc Davis Saturday
for their game wiih the powerful
Cal Aggies. The Jayvees looked
more than a little ragged in an in
tra-squad scrimmage Friday.
Stamm put his charges through a
long signal drill yesterday, with
plenty of live tackling and offensive
blocking. This afternoon the stress
will again be on offensive plays, and
the rest of the week will be spent
on defensive work.
Once again injuries are plaguing
the little Cards. Starting halfback
Fred Fank broke his ankle last week
in practice, and will be benched for
the rest of the season. First-string
guard Bill Edlund's knee injury will
also keep him out for the rest of the
year.
The 1946 Aggies, who have one of
the better teams seen on the Davis
campus in recent years, were held
to a 7-7 tie by the Humboldt State
Lumberjacks last Saturday. The
Card juniors battered the Lumber
iacks 21-0 Oct. 5.
