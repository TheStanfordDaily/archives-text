## 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
The Big Red Machine took a light drill yesterday afternoon to clear the
gears of the mud and muck that accumulated during the trip to Corvallis.
'Ihere was no heavy contact work of any kind; the boys merely shook out
the kinks and ran through a lew new plays in an abbreviated session that
lasted only an hour.
Game captain for Saturday's battle with the Washington Huskies will
be Harvey Bernhard, stellar guard who hails from Seattle. This will be
the second successive Saturday that a right guard has skippered the squad
—against Oregon State it was Dick

Madigan.
Coach Marehie Schwartz an
nounced yesterday that scatback
Freddy Parsons will be shifted from
l ight to left half, and that Don Zap
petini will move to full. Zap will
still be used at left half from time
to time, but more depth is needed
at fullbacfc since Marty Anderson's
injury. Parsons hasn't seen much
action at right half because
Schwartz likes to use a big man who
can back up the line.
