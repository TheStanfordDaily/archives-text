## 
### 
In a short meeting last night,
Toyon Club members adopted a cor
ridor representation amendment by
a two-thirds majority vote.
The amendment calls for one rep
resentative from each of the hall's
five wings to act on the executive
committee.
It was also announced by the
club's president, Frank Creede, that
Hal Roberts' orchestra has been ob
tained for the pre-Big Game Dance
on November IG.
The new amendment is not to be
confused with the "wing plan" that
was voted down three weeks ago,
Creede stressed. Whereas the for
mer proposal split the hall into sep
arate units, each with a president
and other officers, this amendment
merely assures fair representation
for everyone in the hall's centralized
government, he said.
