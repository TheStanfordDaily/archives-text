### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Nov. 4
(UP). —The Security Council in a
rare display of unanimity cleared
the Spanish issue from its agenda
today, making it possible for the
United Nations General Assembly
to take concrete action against the
government of Generalissimo Fran
cisco franco.
The Assembly now can act on
Polish proposals that the United
Nations break diplomatic relations
with the Franco regime and bar
Spain from participating in any
agency connected with U.N.
The unity displayed by the Secu
rity Council in its 64-minute meet
ing today, however, did not mean
that all the powers had come to
favor a move against Franco so
strong as a diplomatic rupture in
formed sources said. The American
and British delegations were re
ported still undecided how far to
go in backing the Polish proposals,
and probably would not know their
position until later consultations
with higher levels.
