JERUSALEM, Nov. 4 (UP).â€”A
usually reliable informant t;aid to
night that the Irgun Zvai Leu mi and
Stern underground organizations
had agreed to collaborate and "work
under the same flag."
This report coincided with anoth
er that at least two top criminal in
vestigation officials, who have made
a specialty of studying the Jewish
underground movement, left by
plane for Rome today to join in the
inquiry to the bombing last Thurs
day of the British embassy.
There was no confirmation here
that a "communique" issued in
Rome, accepting responsibility for
the embassy bombing in behalf of
the Irgun organization, was authen
