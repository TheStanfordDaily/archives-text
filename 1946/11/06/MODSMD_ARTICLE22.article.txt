# Al Masters Slates S.A.C. Position on Rugby Block S Awards
## 
### 
To Martin Anderson, A.S.S.U.
President:
This is in response to your con
versation with me in regard to the
rugby award situation. May I
state right at the outset that my
position lias heen to pro'tect the
Hlock "JS" award from political
abuses, and when I make this
statement I will have to go hack
and give you a little explanation.
Prior to (he season of ll!4o, rug
by was played at Stanford on a
very informal basis at the request
of the coaches and players. The}
did not want it to become even a
minor sport. The season of IIMI!
was played and then shortly
thereafter a small clique banded
together and decided they could
push through a Block "S" award
in rugby because at the time the
war was on. and no one was par
ticular!,v interested. Mr. Harry
Maloncv, who was then in charge
of rugby, stated to me on the af
ternoon of the Kxecutive Commit
tee meeting at which this action
was taken that he was not in fa
vor of making rugby a major
sport and would not promote for
it. I found afterward that be ae-

tually attended I lie committee
meeting mid did promote ('» make
rugby a major sport contrary t<»
his understanding with me. May
I also emphasize again that Ibis
meeting took place after the rug
liy meeting had been completed,
so in my opinion the award of a
Block "S" to members of a team
which had already completed its
season was entirely illegal. I still
feel it is.
May I refer you to my letter of
April 2(5. l!)4:i, to the Executive
Committee? I will quote in part:
"This list nf players is submitted
not in accordance with rules
adopted but by names submitted
by Mr. Malone\ as it is impos
sible to make the awards on the
basis of the rule, which is: "any
player who eompejed one-half of
the playing time against Califor
nia." Mr. Maloney did not keep
competition records on this basis.
However, the Executive Commit
tee of April 21, saw lit to
proceed to gr;yit the Hloek "S"
award'to the individual members
of the team regardless of whether
or not they had completed their
required tir:'\ The committee

was advised by me after Ibis ac
tion (hat I had no money appro
priated for the purpose of buying
award sweaters for rugby and

they would have to buy their own.
and. further. I did not feel thai
they were entitled to their Block
cards.
Bear in mind that the sport of
nigby had nut even heen classi
fied as a minor sport, and because
of political action was raised from
an informal sport with 110 stand
ing to one of major standing.
'I lu-re has heen considerable past
precedence wherein activities have
heen granted letters but the old
Hoard of Athletic Control did not
pay for the award. For example,
rifle shooting and horse polo. It.
therefore, appeared thtyt the old
Hoard of Athletic Control was
within its riehts to take the same
position on this rugby deal. I be
lieve I am correct in stating that
the Associated Students have
never issued or had the authority
to issue Block "S" cards. That has
been done by the old Hoard of
Athletic Control and is now being
done by the Stanford Athletic
Council.
I gave you this background to
show you why I have taken the
position I have taken in the past
and I again wish to repeat that I

have taken il only for the purpose
«»f protecting (he value of the
Block "S" award. I would think
thai your Executive Committee
would want to take the same po
sition and. further, I would think
that the hoys on the team would
not want to aceept an award un
der such conditions. However,
after reviewing the situation, if
your committee still feels that
such past procedure should he
supported and the Stanford Ath
letic Council should Riant Block
"S" cards to the members <»112 the
rugby team. I see no further rea
son to try by myself to protect
the value of the Block "S" cards
in this particular situation even
though the whole procedure was
illegal. If your committee so re
quests, I will issue Block "S"
cards to those who don't already
hold them.
I wi i h to thank your committee
for returning rugby to a minor
sport standing, thereby correcting
a past error in judgment.
Respectfully yours,
Alfred R. Masters
Director of Athletics and Physi
cal Education
