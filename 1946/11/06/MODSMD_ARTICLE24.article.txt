## 
### 
NEW YORK, Wednesday, Nov. 6 (UP). —Republicans had won or were

had won or were leading in contests for 218 House Seats and for 49 in the
Senate—a bare majority of each House of Congress. *
The Republicans had won 82 House seats and were leading in con
tests for i:>(» others. Twenty House scats already won verc taken from
Democratic incumbents.
The Republicans won six Senate scats from Democrats in Idaho, New
York, Massachusetts, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Ohio. They were lead
ing in Missouri, Nevada, Utah and Wisconsin for seats which they do not
hold in the present Senate.
Returns from those four states remain inconclusive, and the standings
easily could shift, especially in Nevrda and Utah where vast distances
delay tabulations.
Incomplete returns gave considerably more assurance of a Republican
House than of a Republican Senate, although many contests were close.
There was always a possibility that the last ballot in the last precinct
would have to be counted before it would be known whether the Demo
cratic party had been ousted from control of either the House or Senate.
Democrats had elccted 12!> members of the House and were leading
in .">0 contests shortly after midnight (KST) for a potential total of 170
seats. In six contests Democrats were leading for seats held by Republi
cans. Republicans were leading in 1!! contests for scats held by Demo
crats.
Republicans had elected 12 Senators, six to scats held by Democrat:;.
Democrats had elected six Senatorial candidates. Democrats were leading
in six contests and Republicans in nine.
Democrats had elected seven and Republicans 10 Governors. The
0.0.P. took one gubernatorial office from the Democrats in Massachusetts.
Democrats were leading in contests for six and Republicans were leading
in contests for 10 governorships.
Governor Thomas K. Dewey achieved a spectacular personal political
triumph in re-election as Governor of New York by a whopping plu
rality. He carried the state ticket to victory with hint. The Republican
tide swept New England, except Rhode Island, the Middle Atlantic and
Lake states, where returns were reasonably conclusive.
Senator Arthur H. Vandenbcrg, R., Mich., was piling up a two-to-one

lead in his re-election race although
he has been so busy with United
j Nations and Peace Conference af
fairs that he never went home to
make a campaign speech.
