## Why Vote 'Preferential'? 
### 
You're voting today because you want to
say something about who's going to repre
sent you in the student governmentâ€”on Ex
com, on the Councils, and in the class govern
ment. The preferential system of voting was
initiated to insure to each voter the maximum
effectiveness for his ballot, and we herewith
explain, in the words of a past Election Board
Chairman, why you should make careful and
complete selections for v first, second, third and
fourth choices:
"First choice votes are counted and tallied,
and the ballots are arranged in piles so that
each pile contains the first choice ballots of
a single candidate.
"If no candidate receives a majority of first
choices, the one receiving the lowest number
of first choices is dropped from the voting
list and the votes credited to him are dropped
from the tally sheet.
"The second choice votes on the ballots
of this candidate are counted and the ballots
placed in the piles of those receiving these
second choices. These are tallied and counted
and the candidate having a majority of the
votes is the winner.

"If still a majority has not been reached,
the candidate with the lowest number of votes
is scratched out of the race. The second-choice
votes on the ballots of this candidate are
counted and the ballots placed in the piles of
those receiving these second choices. How
ever, if these second choices are for a candi
date already disgualified, the third choice is
counted. If a majority vote has been reached
after this tally, no further counting is neces
sary.
"If no election has resulted, the procedure
is repeated until a majority vote is reached.
In doing this, the preference for candidates
already dropped is ignored and the next pref
erence for a name still on the voting list is
counted."
From this explanation, it can be seen that
your third or fourth choice can pack as much
wallop in the election as can your first. So
on those ballots asking for a preferential vote,
don't make a willy-nilly pattern of X's in the
squares. If you vote wisely, the all-around
selections of the student body will emerge as
victorious candidates.
