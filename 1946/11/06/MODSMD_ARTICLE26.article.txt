# Commentary on Council

### 
Men's Council has lately been the subject
oi much general campus criticism which has
done more to confuse students concerning this
branih of their government than it has to help
them understand its purpose and method of
operation, which are primary requisites to
constructive criticism.
The purpose of the organization, as stated
in the preamble of the Council's Rules of Pro
cedure, is to act as a student control group
with "jurisdiction over such disciplinary mat
ters as shall be delegated to it by the Presi
dent of the University and by the Constitution
and By-Laws of the Associated Students."
This control is restricted to male students
and such male non-students as submit them
selves to it voluntarily, and in the past has
included traffic violations, complaints of al
leged violations of the fundamental standard
of conduct, the Honor Code, and other matters
of conduct.
The Council is elected by the men of the
Student Body. It acts in reality as a jury on
natters of discipline, and its judgments are
final, subject to the discretion of the President
of the University, who has absolute right of
review in all cases.
During the past few years the efficiency
of the Council dropped considerably with the
result that records were carelessly kept, and
at present are incomplete, minutes of past
meetings have teen lost, and penalties for
similar violations have been inconsistent. The
effect of this past laxness is beginning to carry
over to the present Council.

Thus far this quarter the Council has func
tioned with three members who have been
kept so busy with a massive number of traf
fic violations that they have given little atten
tion to the other purposes of the group. The
suggestion to Excom that additional members
be appointed to the Council until such time as
permanent ones could be elected was met
with apathy and dismissed.
After today's election Men's Council will
again be operating with a full membership.
Its work is already cut out for it.
Its Rules of Procedure should be made
specific enough to establish a general policy
for offenses that will provide penlties com
mensurate with the violation.
Closer co-ordination must be achieved!
with Women's Council in order that equal
penalties will be meted out to both men and
women for the same violation.
There should be a greater accent on mat
ters pertaining to Honor Code violations and
general discipline than on the more-or-less
routine traffic violations.
A permanent system of keeping records j
must be established, which may help in con- i
junction with a revised Rules of Procedure, to
serve as a precedence in future cases.
The responsibility for disciplinary matters
pertaining to campus men rests with this stu
dent-elected group. If Men's Council is not
able to handle this responsibility in a compe
tent manner, students will eventually lose j
jurisdiction over this phase of college life.—

Men's Council has lately been the subject
oi much general campus criticism which has
done more to confuse students concerning this
branih of their government than it has to help
them understand its purpose and method of
operation, which are primary requisites to
constructive criticism.
The purpose of the organization, as stated
in the preamble of the Council's Rules of Pro
cedure, is to act as a student control group
with "jurisdiction over such disciplinary mat
ters as shall be delegated to it by the Presi
dent of the University and by the Constitution
and By-Laws of the Associated Students."
This control is restricted to male students
and such male non-students as submit them
selves to it voluntarily, and in the past has
included traffic violations, complaints of al
leged violations of the fundamental standard
of conduct, the Honor Code, and other matters
of conduct.
The Council is elected by the men of the
Student Body. It acts in reality as a jury on
natters of discipline, and its judgments are
final, subject to the discretion of the President
of the University, who has absolute right of
review in all cases.
During the past few years the efficiency
of the Council dropped considerably with the
result that records were carelessly kept, and
at present are incomplete, minutes of past
meetings have teen lost, and penalties for
similar violations have been inconsistent. The
effect of this past laxness is beginning to carry
over to the present Council.

Thus far this quarter the Council has func
tioned with three members who have been
kept so busy with a massive number of traf
fic violations that they have given little atten
tion to the other purposes of the group. The
suggestion to Excom that additional members
be appointed to the Council until such time as
permanent ones could be elected was met
with apathy and dismissed.
After today's election Men's Council will
again be operating with a full membership.
Its work is already cut out for it.
Its Rules of Procedure should be made
specific enough to establish a general policy
for offenses that will provide penlties com
mensurate with the violation.
