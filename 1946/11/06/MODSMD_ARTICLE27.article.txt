## BULL SESSION 
### 
Every so often a campus lad gets himself involved
in Ihc problem of having dates with different girls
lor the siinvj weekend. One of the boys ran into just
litis problem recently.
liis true love was coming up from down south
and he had made previous arrangements for the
weekend with one of the local beauties before his
L.A. chick had informed him sh'f was coming up.
He finally decided die only solution to the prob
lem was to inform the girl from down south that he
was in the hospital and tell her not to come. Which
he did. But unfortunately she was of a highly sus
picious nature and informed our boy that she was
definitely going to mak? the trip and that if he wasn't
in die hospital when she got here, he would be short
ly thereafter.
1 hat rather threw the lad and he began racking
his brain (to coin a phrase) for a solution. The date
ot her arrival dr?w closer and closer and he still
hadn't solved his problem.
Then the day before she was due.the health serv
ice called him. Previously, he had had an X-ray
taken by them for a sore back. When he went down
again in answer to their call, they informed him he
had a broken back, shoved him in the hospital, and
put him in a cast.
But they just couldn t understand why he was so
happy about it.

Don t forget to pause a moment this morning on
your way to the Cellar for that cup of java and
cast a ballot in ih? A.S.S.U. elections. You may think
it isn't worth a few moments of your valuable Cellar
time but these are the people who are going to be
your student government. »

Now maybe student government doesn't seem too
important to you. That's 0.k., too. It's your opinion.
But at the same time, these candidates are the people
you're going to be screaming about later when you
say. "Those blank?ty-b!ank blanks are a worthless
bunch of bums that never use their heads and why
isn't somebody in there that knows what the score
is?"
Well, if you don't vote today, you haven't got
much right to scream later about the decisions made
by Excorn. Men's Council, and the class officers that
are on the ballot. If you want a legitimate right to
complain about student government, you'd better
vote today.

A smooth rough was really operating the other
night at a dance given by one of the girls' halls. He
had suggested casually to his girl that they take a
stroll and look at the boalhouse and where the lake
ought to be. So they were up walking around the
"lake."
They stopped for a moment and the lad leaned
back against a tree, just prior to making his move.
Tlvn he felt something crawling on him. Then some
thing else. ANTS! He had leaned back into a nest of
the little beasts. He made a quick decision, and
romance ran a bad second.
He rushed his date home and raced back to the
tong where he dove for the shower and washed away
his tormentors.
Love ain't a picnic, son.

Just heard that "T.V.8." stands for "Better Vote
Today" backwards. Keeristopher!

They stopped for a moment and the lad leaned
back against a tree, just prior to making his move.
Tlvn he felt something crawling on him. Then some
thing else. ANTS! He had leaned back into a nest of
the little beasts. He made a quick decision, and
romance ran a bad second.
He rushed his date home and raced back to the
tong where he dove for the shower and washed away
his tormentors.
Love ain't a picnic, son.

Just heard that "T.V.8." stands for "Better Vote
Today" backwards. Keeristopher!
Every so often a campus lad gets himself involved
in Ihc problem of having dates with different girls
lor the siinvj weekend. One of the boys ran into just
litis problem recently.
liis true love was coming up from down south
and he had made previous arrangements for the
weekend with one of the local beauties before his
L.A. chick had informed him sh'f was coming up.
He finally decided die only solution to the prob
lem was to inform the girl from down south that he
was in the hospital and tell her not to come. Which
he did. But unfortunately she was of a highly sus
picious nature and informed our boy that she was
definitely going to mak? the trip and that if he wasn't
in die hospital when she got here, he would be short
ly thereafter.
1 hat rather threw the lad and he began racking
his brain (to coin a phrase) for a solution. The date
ot her arrival dr?w closer and closer and he still
hadn't solved his problem.
Then the day before she was due.the health serv
ice called him. Previously, he had had an X-ray
taken by them for a sore back. When he went down
again in answer to their call, they informed him he
had a broken back, shoved him in the hospital, and
put him in a cast.
But they just couldn t understand why he was so
happy about it.

Don t forget to pause a moment this morning on
your way to the Cellar for that cup of java and
cast a ballot in ih? A.S.S.U. elections. You may think
it isn't worth a few moments of your valuable Cellar
time but these are the people who are going to be
your student government. »

Now maybe student government doesn't seem too
important to you. That's 0.k., too. It's your opinion.
But at the same time, these candidates are the people
you're going to be screaming about later when you
say. "Those blank?ty-b!ank blanks are a worthless
bunch of bums that never use their heads and why
isn't somebody in there that knows what the score
is?"
Well, if you don't vote today, you haven't got
much right to scream later about the decisions made
by Excorn. Men's Council, and the class officers that
are on the ballot. If you want a legitimate right to
complain about student government, you'd better
vote today.

A smooth rough was really operating the other
night at a dance given by one of the girls' halls. He
had suggested casually to his girl that they take a
stroll and look at the boalhouse and where the lake
ought to be. So they were up walking around the
"lake."
