# Don Cossacks Sing to Enthusiastic Audience
## 
### 
Still exhibiting enthusiasm and
spirit alter 2*5 years of conceit tours,
the Original Don Cossack Choir, un
der the direction of diminutive
Serge Jaroff, did not fail to please a
responsive audience at the first Con
cert Series program of the year Fri
day night in Memorial Auditorium.
Singing to a full house, the Cos
sacks presented three groups of
songs: spiritual, folk, and military.
Each group was marked by a
mood fitting the type of song, and
the Cossacks seemed to feel and
; project that mood without obvi
; ous ell'ort.
The number that perhaps endear
| ed them most to the audience was a
j song written by one of the chorus
members telling of their history,
J how the chorus was founded, their
journey to the United States, and
j the happiness they found in their
adopted country. The song ended
with a medley of four American
military songs (air corps, navy,
army, and marines' hymns) in Eng
lish. The chorus of Russian accents
giving a spirited rendition of these
! songs, caused no small amusement
to the audience and did much to
break the slight reserve evident
during the first part of the program.
Intermissions were highlighted
by a display of Russian dancing
by two Cossack dancers, and their
gay. exhausting antics drew
laughter and prolonged applause
from the audience.
Much of the credit for the Cos

sacks' fine performance must go to
their director, Serge Jaroff. His fine
sense of timing and tone, and his
obvious success as a disciplinarian
are two major factors contributing
to the chorus' constant popularity.
Still the most remarkable feat of

a chorus like theirs is the marvelous
tone achieved in the songs. The
hushed quality of the spiritual songs,
the gay lilt to the melodic folk
songs, and the robust quality in the
military group are the result of fine
voices well trained. —Shelton.
