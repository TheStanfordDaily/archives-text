## CARD STUNTS 
### 
Dutch Warmerdam and the intramurals had a mighty busy time last
week. Four hundred forty-three men participated in 26 touch football
games during four days of play, while the volleyball leagues turned out
12 games and 228 participants.
And that's not all. Goif gets under way this week with .'{9 two-man
teams signed lip for 'mural competition. If all this football and volley
ball and golf and what-have-you keeps up at this rate, and I have my
math straight, there'll be about 75(1 men out for 'mural sports during a
week, and that ain't hay.
So with all due respect to the men who organized this program, will
all the fellows who are doing their part in this fine turn-out please step
before the curtain and take a well-deserved round of applause.
Turning the spotlight on some of the finer points of the intramural
program of last week, I find that the Breakers deserve the title of "'most
improved" team in the football leagues. They downed the previously
unbeaten Sigma Chi's 20-6, and in doing so featured some short, sharp
passes that were as nice as any seen for a long time.
The Firehouse continued on its fire-trail as it blazed by the Encina
IK team 51-0 in a slaughter-house demonstration of fine running and
plenty of good blocking. Outstanding for the Firehouse boys were the
Pfyl brothers. Monte and Frank, who did most of the scoring for their
team as they passed and ran the hall all over the place.
Looming up as a better-than-average team are the Question Marks,
who have three victories to their credit in three starts in League V. En
cina 2E finally left the cellar of their league as they wailoped the Phi Sigs
44-12 for their first win in three games and pulled up even with the Phi
Sigs in the League IX race. The closest game of the week was played in
League II competition on Thursday when the Theta Chi's defeated En
cina SW, 6-0, on the very last play of the game with a pass by Davis.
The best records in the football leagues go to three teams that have
run up a high total of points without permitting their opponents to cross
their goal line. Topping them all are the Firehouse boys, who scored 121
points in three games, while the Betas ran up 97 digits and the Legal
Eagles 55 to their opponents' zero. At present there are 16 unbeaten teams,
but excluding upsets this week the number will be reduced to 13, Besides
Army and Notre Dame, that is.

The Bailie of Stanford vs. Stanford
When Stanford beat the Cal water polo team last Saturday the score
was 7-6. But Cal had the help of four Stanford men to make the game
that close.
Here's what happened. The referee was a former Indian by the name
of Bob Fraser. The timekeeper, Norton Thornton, is an old Stanfordite.
The two goal scorers hailed from the Farm. And so on. Anyway, just
before the end of the half. Indian poloist Dick Narver threw a beautiful
goal from way out. The timekeeper got so interested in the play that he
forgot to look at his stop watch and didn't realize that the time had run
over three seconds. So he blew the whistle quick like a bunny, and then
ran over to the referee to explain what happened.
Naturally they didn't want anyone to think they were favoring the
Cards, so they ruled the goal out and brought the score to a narrow Red
lead. This could have cost the Farm team the game, but they went ahead
and won anyway—in spite of the super-honest Indian officials.
Oh, yes, where do you think Bear Coach Hal Wetherbe hails from?
That's right, you guessed it! Stanford.

One of our minor sports that has been hiding in the shade lately is
gymnastics. Only a handful of men have been working out in the gym
room, and it may be that lots of fellows have forgotten that the gym team's
season is just around the corner.
Team mentor Husky Hunt —University of Indiana gym team of 12—
has a variety of instruments clown in the Men's Gym, and would like to
.see a great many of the new men on campus come on down and work
out. He feels that if enough men show interest in this sport, in time Stan
ford could get into the Pacific Coast competition .
Some of the men working around the parallel bars and horses these
afternoons look pretty sharp. Jerry Stewart who was on the gym team
last year, is a versatile performer; Lawrence Ainsworth is a specialist
in rope climbing and on the still rings. Exercising on the parallel bars
is Ward Chennel's top event, while Paul Freeman works on the side
horse and the high horizontal bar.
The regular gymnastic season is in winter and in spring, but since the
10 to 15-man squad will take a long time in training and preparation for
their competition, this is the time that all good men should come to the
aid of Husky.
By the way, Lloyd Merriman was in Husky's gym class this spring,
and look what he can do now. Here's your chance, men. Take it.
From Seashore lo Snowbank
Captain of the Crew Association Stan Cumberpatch came into the office
the other night and asked for help. The crew is having its first race of
the season on Nov. 23 against Cal and are anxious to have some more fel
lows turn out for the Varsity. They haven t even picked a coxswain yet,
so ali who have had any experience in crew will be more than welcome.
The boys work out at the Yacht Harbor from 1 to 6, leaving the
S.A.C. at I in the afternoon. The match with the Bears is mainly for
experience since this is not the regular crew season, hut the Indians
will float as many shells as can be readied by then.
California's "Admiral" Ky Ebright, coach of the Blue and Gold crew,
will be on campus tonight to give a talk and show a movie of the Cal crew
and its techniques. The meeting will be in room 100 on the Quad at 7:30;
all interested in meeting the crew members and seeing the movies of the
Cal men should make it a point to attend. Your help will be appreciated
bv the men who are trying to carry Stanford s colors on water.

With the skiing season just around the corner, campus snow enthu
siasts are looking forward to the team tryouts that the Indians will hold
on Ml. Rose over Thanksgiving holidays. There are quite a number of
top skiers around Stanford this quarter, and ski team captain Boh Blatt
will have plenty of material with which to put his squad together.
Tops among promising team tryouts will undoubtedly be Ski Club
President Boots Blatt. who has done quite a bit of racing already. Bill
and Tito Sigal of Palo Alto are two more* students who can be expected
to add their skiing abilities to the squad; Don Williams from Seattle and
the University ol Washington is another newcomer with racing expeiience,
as is Howard Ives from Minnesota.
Three recent transfers from the Scandinavian countries. Jan Mauritz
and Hal Ditlcv-Sinumsen from Norway and I II Ramni-Ericson from
Sweden, will be welcome additions and power for the Stanford cross
country and jumping events.
It won't be long now until "Ski Heil" will be the password on campus
and heavy ski boots the fashion, so you'd better dust off those hickory
boards and get set for the season.
