### 
Showing no lack of spirit after
their 1-0 loss to USF last Saturday,
the Stanford soccer team worked
out yesterday afternoon in prepara
-1 tion for their meeting with Menlo
Junior College this corning Satur
day.
Coach Dave Tappan had this to
say about Stanford's entrant in the
California Intercollegiate Soccer
Conference:
"We have a good club this year.
: As usual, we'll be pointing for Cal.
j Last Saturday we outplayed the
USF squad in defense, but it's our
offense that needs sharpening."
The captain of the soccer team is
| Ira Halstaum, who is from India.
! However, he is not the only foreign
student on the squad. One of the
star forwards on the club is Ricardo
Tregos, hailing from Costa Rica,

cans, one Turk, and one Chinese.
These foreign boys really get in and
play the sport, too.

month is as follows:

Nov. 23—Cal.
Nov. 30—San Mateo J.C. \
