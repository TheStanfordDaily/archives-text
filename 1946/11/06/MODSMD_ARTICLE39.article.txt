# JVs Drill For Cal Ags
## 
### 
With a whole new bag of T (tricks,
Stanford's offense-minded Jayvees
travel up to Davis Saturday for a
game with the dangerous Cal Ag
gies. Coaches Ed Stamm, Lin Wolfe,
and Bob Crane put their Junior In
dians through another long, hard
workout yesterday, with lots of
work on passing, offense and de
fense.
The Jayvees will spend some more
time this afternoon on passing, and
will also work on some new plays
to spring on the Davis boys.
X-ray reports have confirmed the
report yesterday that halfback Fred
Fank will be out for the rest of
the season with a broken ankle.
Starting guard Bill Edlund will also
be benched for the rest of the year
with a knee injury.
Gene Coldiron scouted the Cal
Aggies last Saturday in their game
with the Humboldt State Lumber
jacks. The Lumbermen were lucky
to hold the Mustangs lo a 7-7 tie.
A 25-mile an hour wind effectively
stalled the Aggies' explosive pass
ing attack, and ill-timed fumbles
and penalties mired their ground
offensive.
Coldiron was more than a little
impressed with Coach Vernard B.
Hickey's outfit, and warns Stamm
that the Aggies are going to be
hard to get along with next Satur
day. They have a dead-eye passer
in Stan Brown, and a pair of de
pendable ends in Jeff Van Heusen
and John Ward.
The Card Jayvees leave by bus
for the Davis field early Saturday
morning, with the kickoff set for
2:15.
