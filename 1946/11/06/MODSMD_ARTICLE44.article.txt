# Cards Drill Against Husky Plays; Cripples Return
## 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
The Stanford football team got a big mental lift last night
when the injured George Quist and Marty Anderson showed up
for practice, along with Pete August, who has been working out
lightly for several days. None of the boys are expected to play
Saturday, but their very presence is good for morale.

Marchie sent his boys through a •
defensive drill against Washington
plays, with George Quist, in sweat
clothes, emulating the highly re
garded Larry Hatch at left half. The
Polar Bear was slinging the ball
downfield with a vim and, although
rusty from lack of practice, he go'
plenty of distance. Aubrey Devine
was subbing for Dick Ottele, the
Husky quarterback.
Most of the afternoon was spent
on offensive drill, correcting some
of the little flaws that have shown
up in the past. There was no bod
ily coniact work, but the boys
were piling into the dummies with
a lot of steam. Pete August took
his regular turn among the cen
ters and didn't seem to he favor
ing the gimpy knee that has kept
him out of action since tho game
with University of San Francisco.
A few pass plays were called, but
Marchie and his aides seemed most
interested ir. polishing their ground
attack. Al Morris has made a quick
job of learning his new assignments
at right half and is looking steadily
better; Freddy Parsons and Don
Zappetini put in their first day at
their new positions.
The footballers wound up their
drill with a few fast lunges at the
tackling dummy and raced into the
showers, ready to tear the training
table apart. But the heaviest prac
tices of the week arc yet to come.
