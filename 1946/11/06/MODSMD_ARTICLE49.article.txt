### DAN PAGE 
Attention all amateur I-lawk
shaws! Hark to the sad plight of
Mr. Chips, who has lost his chain.
Poor Mr. Chips (sob) is really Rob
ert Collyer, the special-delivery
man who brings all those extra-spe
cial, Chanel No. 5-drenched letters
to other people's doors.
But Mr. Chips is about to say
goodbye to the whole thing if some
one doesn't find the chain oft his
trusty motor-scooter, which slipped
off somewhere between Paly and
the Post Office.
Mr. Chips says that in spite of the
Post Office motto, he is getting fairly
well fed up with pushing his Cush
man around all day. So if you see a
greasy old chain lying around, just
kick it in the gutter. Pick it up and
rush it off to Mr. Chips at the P.O.
