# Dr. Dodds Reads Hudson's Poetry
## 
### 
Representative selections of po
etry by the late Hoyt Hudson were
read by John Dodds, Dean of the
School of Humanities, yesterday af
ternoon at the Tuesday poetry-read
ing series.
Mr. Hudson, who was professor of
English at Stanford from 1942 to
1944, died here in June of 1944.
The informal atmosphere of the
Briggs room of the Humanities
Building was the perfect setting for
the qui"t dignity and humor of the
poems, as was the low, sometimes
satirical voice of Dean Dodds.
