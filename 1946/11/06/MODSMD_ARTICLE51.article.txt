# Larger Gaieties Chorus Needed
## 
### 
"Although this article appears on
the back page of the paper, it is of
front-page importance. We can't
have a good Gaieties unless we get a
larger chorus. We prefer men, but
we will welcome both sexes at the
chorus rehearsal tomorrow night at
7 in the Ram's Head Room. The
men's chorus is also to attend this
rehearsal," announced Gaieties Di
rector Bob Ashley.
Contrary to the rehearsal sched
ule, the skit rehearsal order for to
night is as follows: Branner at 7, and
Dibble, Bay Bridge and Registration
Intro at 8. The vocalists will re
hearse as scheduled.
