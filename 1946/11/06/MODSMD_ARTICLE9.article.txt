# Nature Has Its Comics

A Tuesday Evening Series audi
enee found a little of human nature
in nature last night as Dr. Olin Se
wall Pettingill, Jr., presented an
illustrated lecture in Memorial Au
ditorium on ''Wilderness Mischief."
Nagging female bitterns and "Cas
per Milquetoast" males joined with
inquisitive bears and frustrated
goldfinches in acting out a comedy
in nature that might have been a
successful Hollywood scenario.
A staff lecturer for the Audubon
Society and one of the world's fore
most natural scientists, Dr. Pettin
gill provided running comment on
the film he took in, northern Michi
gan.
Taking his audience through the
successive "communities" of nature,
Dr. Pcttingill illustrated in excellent
colored shots that what is called
human nature is also nature's na
ture.
In a bit of fine photography a fe
male bittern scolded a hen-pecked
male, a frustrated goldfinch looked
about helplessly for his mate who
had flown the nest.
Raccoons, chipmunks, golden go
phers, black bears, turtles, and por
cupines all had starring roles in Dr.
Pettingill's wildlife epic.
Of the turtles he said, "nature was
being a bit cynical in giving them a
hard shell and a slow wit."
Dr. Bailey Willis, emeritus of ge
ology, introduced Dr. Pcttingill.â€”
