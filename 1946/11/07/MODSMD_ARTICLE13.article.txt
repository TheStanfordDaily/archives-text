# Excom Hears Vote Dispute
## 
### 
Excom last night admitted that
yesterday's election was illegal be
cause the polls at the Village did not
open early enough to meet con
stitution requirements, but voted
against having a re-election in the
anticipation of a resultant smaller,
more unrepresentative group of
voters.
No provision was made, how
ever, to investigate whether or not
the illegality would have made a
difference in election results.
The committee also voted not to
award the 1943 rugby team mem
bers their BJoi'k "S" cards, giving
thorn full Block "S" privileges, be
cause Excom had been illegal in
making rugby a major sport. Ex
com has the power to pass on Block
"S" awards, but the decision can
not take effect until the following
season, a stipulation that was not
followed in the 1943 case. Team
members, however, will keep their
fell letters and sweaters which were
given to them at the time.
Stan Shpetner pointed out that
polls .-it the Village were not open
between 7 and 8 a.m.—just from 11.
a.m. to 3 p.m. In addition, Village
students who tried to vote on cam
pus in the morning could not do so
as there were no ballots at campus
booths until later in the day. He
said that many students were dis
enfranchised because of this over
sight. and therefore are laughing at
Stanford's student government.
Shpetner called for a recount
<»112 the graduate member on the
Excom ballot. Results of that
election are unofficial until the
recount is made.
Bob Ay res, Election Board chair
man, reported that on one ballot
requiring a large number of choices,
a person was elected simply because
a number of students marked the
ballot in a diagonal design. The
candidate having a large plurality
of votes on the first ballot lost the
election by a narrow margin.
In discussion tightly administered
by A.S.S.U. President Martin An-

Here's how your Excom mem
bers voted last night on major
issues:
Awarding of Block "S" cards—
For. Thoreau and Streeter; against,
Cos)igan. I'ower, Wilbur, Burke.
Approving of yesterday's elec
tion — For, Thorcau, Costigan,
Power, Wilbur, Burke; against,
Streeter.

dcrson, members suggested reme
dies for these election system vils.
Ayrcs asked for a longer period
of time between nominations and
elections to give Election Board
more time to investigate nomina
tion blanks and check ballots. It
was suggested that when there
are a large number of candidates
on one ballot, a primary be run
off to eliminate some of them; and
Burke said. ' You are almost sure
to have errors when counting
ballots with a lot of names."
Having addresses as well as names
on student body cards to check vot
ing districts was also brought up.
Anderson appointed Burke, H. D,
Thoreau. and Ay res to go over the
constitution and suggest possible
amendments.

students who tried to vote on cam
pus in the morning could not do so
as there were no ballots at campus
booths until later in the day. He
said that many students were dis
enfranchised because of this over
sight. and therefore are laughing at
Stanford's student government.
Shpetner called for a recount
<»112 the graduate member on the
Excom ballot. Results of that
election are unofficial until the
recount is made.
Bob Ay res, Election Board chair
man, reported that on one ballot
requiring a large number of choices,
a person was elected simply because
a number of students marked the
ballot in a diagonal design. The
candidate having a large plurality
of votes on the first ballot lost the
election by a narrow margin.

Here's how your Excom mem
bers voted last night on major
issues:
Awarding of Block "S" cards—
For. Thoreau and Streeter; against,
Cos)igan. I'ower, Wilbur, Burke.
Approving of yesterday's elec
tion — For, Thorcau, Costigan,
Power, Wilbur, Burke; against,
Streeter.

dcrson, members suggested reme
dies for these election system vils.
Ayrcs asked for a longer period
of time between nominations and
elections to give Election Board
more time to investigate nomina
tion blanks and check ballots. It
was suggested that when there
are a large number of candidates
on one ballot, a primary be run
off to eliminate some of them; and
Burke said. ' You are almost sure
to have errors when counting
ballots with a lot of names."
Having addresses as well as names
on student body cards to check vot
ing districts was also brought up.
Anderson appointed Burke, H. D,
Thoreau. and Ay res to go over the
constitution and suggest possible
amendments.
Excom last night admitted that
yesterday's election was illegal be
cause the polls at the Village did not
open early enough to meet con
stitution requirements, but voted
against having a re-election in the
anticipation of a resultant smaller,
more unrepresentative group of
voters.
No provision was made, how
ever, to investigate whether or not
the illegality would have made a
difference in election results.
The committee also voted not to
award the 1943 rugby team mem
bers their BJoi'k "S" cards, giving
thorn full Block "S" privileges, be
cause Excom had been illegal in
making rugby a major sport. Ex
com has the power to pass on Block
"S" awards, but the decision can
not take effect until the following
season, a stipulation that was not
followed in the 1943 case. Team
members, however, will keep their
fell letters and sweaters which were
given to them at the time.
Stan Shpetner pointed out that
polls .-it the Village were not open
between 7 and 8 a.m.—just from 11.
a.m. to 3 p.m. In addition, Village
students who tried to vote on cam
pus in the morning could not do so
