WASHINGTON, Nov. (i (UP).
The United Slates served notice to
night that it wants exclusive trus
teeship over all the Japanese man
dale islands in the far Pacific and
the right to fortify them secretly
without supervision or interference
by the United Nations.
In simultaneous announcements
by President Truman and the State
Department, the government re
vealed that it will ask the U.N. Se
curity Council shortly for sweeping
trustee powers over all the mandate
islands torn from Japan by Ameri
can arms.
In effect, the trusteeship would
make the entire central Pacific
from San Francisco to Tokyo Hay
an American preserve in every
thing hut name.
Foreign aircraft could be barred
from fljing over the island bases

and lli" islands themselves could he
closed "lor security reasons" at any
time the United States decides to
do : o.
The American decision, which
seemed certain to provoke furious
debate in the U.N. Security Coun
cil, constituted a major victory for
Army and Navy leaders who had
insisted that the Pacific! bases won
at so high a cost in blood should be
retained permanently as security
outposts.
The initial trusteeship proposal
embraces only the Marshall, Car
oline and Marianas Islands, which
were mandated to Japan after
World War I. hut ultimately it is
anticipated that it will he extend
ed to the Kyukyu and Volcano
Islands, including Okinawa and
Iwo Jima.
The State Department sftid a draft

of the tru.steeship plan already has
hern submitted to the U.N. Security
Council in New York and to New
Zealand and the Philippines govern
ment for preliminary study before
it is presented formally to (he
Council.
The plan would provide:
1. That the United States shall
he entitled to establish military,
naval and air bases in the trust
territories, erect fortifications, sta
tion and employ armed forces
there, and make use of local vol
unteer forces for local defense and
security.
2. Thai air traffic rights to for
eign planes are subject to separate
agreements between the United
States and any other country
wishing to use the islands as stop
ping points.
X The United States may per-

Mit U.N. representatives fo in
spect the islands periodically, but
may close off all or part of them
hI any time it deems such action
necessary for security reasons.
â€¢I. The United States will prom
ise to foster the economic, politi
cal. and social development of the
native peoples in the trust terri
tories and guarantee the fun
damental freedoms of religion,
speech, press, assembly and mi
gration.
5. Inhabitants of the territories
will receive the full diplomatic
and consular protection of the
United States at any. time they
may travel outside the direct ju
risdiction of the American Hay.

agreement may not he terminated
or altered without the consent of
