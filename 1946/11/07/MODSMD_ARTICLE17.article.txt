### 
An estimated 21 per cent of the Stanford student body, 1,528 voters, went to the polls yester
day to ballot their choices for 11 student government positions. Balloting was lightest in Stan
ford Village where Bill Heyl, Robert Kapsein, and Roy Anderson were elected to Excom positions.
Under the preferential system of balloting and counting all elections were close and no candi
dates were given a majority on the first counting. Many of the elections went into as high as 15 or
16 countings before a candidate reached a majority.
Almort half of the freshman class, 532 voters, participated in yesterday's election to appoint
Bill Whiteford as president, and Nancy Ferguson as secretary-treasurer of the class of '50. Stan
Shpetner and Dick Bartle were top two out of the 1,299 votes cast for the Men's Council positions.
