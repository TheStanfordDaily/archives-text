# Relief Fund Goal $14,000
## 
### 
Fourteen thousand dollars is the
goal for Stanford's Fall Relief Fund
Drive which begins Monday and
ends Nov. 16.
This year's Relief Fund will go to
the Community Chest, World Stu
dent Serviec Fund. Infantile Paraly-
I sis Fund, and Floating Fund for em
ergency drives.
Replacing the Stanford War Fund
Drive which was held on the cam
pus the past few years, Lhe 1946 Re
lief Fund will ask for a $2 contribu
tion from each individual student.
However, it is hoped that Stan
| ford students will feel willing to
contribute more individually be
: cause of the great relief needs exist
; ing all over the world, according to
| Janet Ossman, drive chairman.
Symbol of the drive will be Four
Feathers — representing the four
charities to which the fund will con
tribute. The drive this fall will be
the only ail-campus drive for this
quarter and is one of the three regu-
I lar drives held each year.
Drive booths will go up on campus
Monday morning at 9 in front of the
Cellar and the Post Office. Collect
ors will be stationed at the booths
from 9 a.m. until 2 p.m. every day
through Friday.
Resident and Stanford Village stu
, dents are asked to make their con
tributions through their dormitories,
j Off-campus students will be con-
I (acted by mail and are asked to
make their contributions at the
i booths. Students wishing to make
i pledges may mail them in by Nov.
| 31.
