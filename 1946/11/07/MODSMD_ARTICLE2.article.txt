# Rally Friday For Huskies
## 
### 
Tribes from the Far North will
be featured guests at the pre-game
Washington rally in the Pavilion at
7Friday light.
A mock Washington rooting sec
tion attired in purple and gold will
exchange yells with the Stanford
rooters. New and unusual Wash
ington yells will be led by the Uni
versity's cheer leaders, who have
braved the snows of the Evergreen
State or ihe trip.
Washington's coach is making the
trip by Husky team to appear at
Friday's rally, according to Jean
Strong and Sam Brenner, co-chair
men of the program.

Stanford rooters are reminded
by Rally Com that counting out
the penalties at a football game
game could result in a penalty
against the home team. This is
a new rule being enforced by all
Pacific Coast Conference officials.
The committee has requested
every student's co-operation to
avoid penalizing Stanford's eleven
for the action of their rooting
section.

The head Husky dog is, at the
present time, being persuaded to
make a short speech following the
talk by his coach, the two chairmen
said.
Washington's junior band, almost
six strong, is accompanying the
team south to provide music for the
Husky rooting section at the rally.
The floor of the gym will be trans
formed in a football gridiron for the
night. Stanfordites will witness a
preview of Saturday's game.
