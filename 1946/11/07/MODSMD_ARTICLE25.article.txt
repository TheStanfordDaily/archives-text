## Not to Be Laughed At 
### 
With the almost final counting of election
returns, Excom is fully staffed and physically
ready to operate according to the constitu
tion's outlines. For those ' students newly
elected to Excom spots, for those who remain
as the "represented" in this student govern
ment, we will herein attempt to explain what
place you do and can occupy in the over-all
set-up.
Excom (the Executive Committee) is em
powered by the A.S.S.U. constitution to con
trol n)l organized student body activities, and
has the general power to adopt by-laws and
regulations for student conduct subject to the
provisions of the constitution and regulations
of the University. It is the legislative body of
the Associated Students.
The twelve representatives holding Excom
seats are elected from living group areas
rather than along class lines as was done for
merly, to insure direct channels of informa
tion passing up to, and down from, Excom
through house meetings.

Students wishing to address Excom can
individually seek their representative who
lives in most cases close to them, or can reg
ister their opinions on subjects for Excom at
tention through the consolidated medium of
house meetings. Any student may, on his
own initiative, come personally to Excom's
Wednesday night meetings to address the
Committee.
In the same way, most representatives
have specific living group governments
through which to pass Excom decisions for
review or to call for student opinion about
topics pending on Excom's agenda. It is in
cumbent upon each representative to contact
his area in this way, or otherwise make-him
self available to his constituents for an ex
change of opinion and information.
Living group representation was approved
by a student referendum in 1944, in the belief
that student life at Stanford centers primarily
around the house in which each person lives.
