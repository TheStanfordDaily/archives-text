# BILL COUGHLIN
## BULL SESSION 
### 
It's a quiet, slightly overcast afternoon here in
the Shack and the office is cluttered with coke bottles
and characters.
How a diiily paper ever gets put out over here
coniinues to be a never-ending source of amaze
ment. Nobody seems to know what they're doing
I j•»i t' :\y all get together and do it around a big desk
and f:ie result is the Stanford Daily on your door
step every morning.
Since 1 find myself short of witty topics for the
morning's column, come and spend an afternoon
with us here in the Shack.
The place today is plastered with "T.V.8." signs,
which I; test rumors have it mean either "to Village
Ball" (are they giving one?.) or "Toyon Victory
Ball" (are they giving one?). Personally, I think
it stands for "Toxim Volibus Boxae," an old Latin
phrase taken from Cicero's second speech before the
Roman St n te and meaning "Make all checks pay
able to Stanford University or the Board of Trustees
will up the tuition another fifteen."
The editor and business manager of this rag have
taken ofi on their roller-skates for the Ad Building
to test some new typewriters by dropping them off
the balcony down there. If they still write, we don't
want 'em..
This office is honored by the presence of the
Sports Ed and another nameless face who are busy
discussing life and lewd songs. Am informed by the
sports wheel that Eastern Kentucky State Teachers'
College (oh. yes, there is, too; it's in eastern Ken
tucky) has a rather unusual yell. While the team is
driving down the field toward the goal, they shout,
"Give it to 'em, give it to 'em." After the touchdown

(they scored one back in 1937), the yell leader asks
the rooting section, "How do you l'eel?" The section
answers, "SATISFIED." Maybe Rally Com isn't so
bad, after all.
Out in the City Room (who are we trying to
kid'.') some of the political lights are discussing the
national election results. Loudest moan is, "Jeezle.
just because Truman is one doesn't mean they're all
bad!" Reporters are beginning to file in now and
pound out the little items on organ recitals and
Klahoya picnics that keep you all on the edge of
your chairs in your 8 o'clocks every morning. The
night editor is beginning to tear his hair in distress
at ihe night-long job facing him.
The beauty of the staff runs a comb through her
silken locks, plops some more lipstick on her puss,
and crosses her legs to give the boys a break. Three
beat their heads against the nearest wall and another
swings, howling, from the chandelier. Otherwise,
she is ignored.
This office is adorned with maps of Japan and
China, photos of several grid stalwarts toward
which the editor bows low three times every day
at 5 o'clock, and several back issues of the Daily.
One states in large black type, '"Invasion of Europe
On." Another points out that "Modern Man Is Ob
solete." Perhaps we're being traded in on newer,
speedier models, men. I'd better check that item.
I'm informed by another character who wanders
in that a good item might be the fact that (he "Me
moirs of Hecate County," over which there was such
a terrific censorship brawl resulting in its being
banned from sale in L.A., was sold OVER the counter
at Stanford's Bookstore. I inform said character that
I don't publicize such nasty books.

I j•»i t' :\y all get together and do it around a big desk
and f:ie result is the Stanford Daily on your door
step every morning.
Since 1 find myself short of witty topics for the
morning's column, come and spend an afternoon
with us here in the Shack.
The place today is plastered with "T.V.8." signs,
which I; test rumors have it mean either "to Village
Ball" (are they giving one?.) or "Toyon Victory
Ball" (are they giving one?). Personally, I think
it stands for "Toxim Volibus Boxae," an old Latin
phrase taken from Cicero's second speech before the
Roman St n te and meaning "Make all checks pay
able to Stanford University or the Board of Trustees
will up the tuition another fifteen."
The editor and business manager of this rag have
taken ofi on their roller-skates for the Ad Building
to test some new typewriters by dropping them off
the balcony down there. If they still write, we don't
want 'em..
This office is honored by the presence of the
Sports Ed and another nameless face who are busy
discussing life and lewd songs. Am informed by the
sports wheel that Eastern Kentucky State Teachers'
College (oh. yes, there is, too; it's in eastern Ken
tucky) has a rather unusual yell. While the team is
driving down the field toward the goal, they shout,
"Give it to 'em, give it to 'em." After the touchdown

(they scored one back in 1937), the yell leader asks
the rooting section, "How do you l'eel?" The section
answers, "SATISFIED." Maybe Rally Com isn't so
bad, after all.
Out in the City Room (who are we trying to
kid'.') some of the political lights are discussing the
national election results. Loudest moan is, "Jeezle.
just because Truman is one doesn't mean they're all
bad!" Reporters are beginning to file in now and
pound out the little items on organ recitals and
Klahoya picnics that keep you all on the edge of
your chairs in your 8 o'clocks every morning. The
night editor is beginning to tear his hair in distress
at ihe night-long job facing him.
The beauty of the staff runs a comb through her
silken locks, plops some more lipstick on her puss,
and crosses her legs to give the boys a break. Three
beat their heads against the nearest wall and another
swings, howling, from the chandelier. Otherwise,
she is ignored.
This office is adorned with maps of Japan and
China, photos of several grid stalwarts toward
which the editor bows low three times every day
at 5 o'clock, and several back issues of the Daily.
One states in large black type, '"Invasion of Europe
On." Another points out that "Modern Man Is Ob
solete." Perhaps we're being traded in on newer,
speedier models, men. I'd better check that item.
I'm informed by another character who wanders
in that a good item might be the fact that (he "Me
moirs of Hecate County," over which there was such
a terrific censorship brawl resulting in its being
banned from sale in L.A., was sold OVER the counter
at Stanford's Bookstore. I inform said character that
I don't publicize such nasty books.
It's a quiet, slightly overcast afternoon here in
the Shack and the office is cluttered with coke bottles
and characters.
How a diiily paper ever gets put out over here
coniinues to be a never-ending source of amaze
ment. Nobody seems to know what they're doing
