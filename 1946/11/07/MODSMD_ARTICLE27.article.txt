AUSTRIA—THE BAND PLAYS ON
Austrians are the inventors of a pretty bitter kind
ol humor. They call it gallows-humor and an ex
ample of it was given by the little country's foreign
minister, Karl Gruber, when he spoke here the other
day.
He told the story of the German plane that set
out with a load of bombs to check black-out regu
lations. First he Mew over Berlin. Everything OK
there. Over Munich he saw a few lights, dropped
a bomb, the lights went out, and he flew on. Vienna
he found brightly lit. In anger he dropped all his
bombs, the lights went out, and on flashed a sign:
Welcome to Austria,"
Austrians have a jot of things to be bitter about.
Their last fairly normal days ended in 1914 with the
outbreak of the war. They were on the losing side
and 1919 saw their country reduced to a little area,
: ornewhat less than one-fourth the size of California.
A little country with six million people, a third
of them living in Vienna. A little country of scenic
mountains but inadequate agriculture or industry
to support itself. A little country surrounded by
tariff walls, that made it almost impossible to export
or import. Even a proposed customs union with
Germany was forbidden.
The people made grim jokes, watched helplessly
while their children got rickets due to lack of milk,
and went on. Savings were wiped out by an infla
tion that lasted till 1924. The slow progress that was
made in the years of "prosperity" that followed was
wiped out by the depression.
Considering the odds they did a fairly good job.
The low cost apartments built by the Social Demo
crats in Vienna became famous throughout the
world. A model health insurance plan brought ade
quate medical service to the many who could not
otherwise afford it. Austria became a pleasant coun
try tor tourists. Poverty was hidden behind pictu
resque fronts.
Democratic government came to a sudden end in
1!).')4 when an unpleasant little man named Dolfuss
and his "Christian Socialists" (party names don't
mean a thing in Europe) formed a one-party church
dominated government, remodeled along Mussolini's
lines. Bitter jokes increased.
Independence ended one March evening in 1938
when German troops and brown and black-shirted
gangs marched down the streets, singing "Today we
own Germany, tomorrow the world." Ironic humor
hit a new high.
In the next seven years—seven lean years—Aus
trians were gestapoed. starved, bombed, and finally
liberated. In those years a lot of people were
Nazis like a lot of people in other conquered na
tions. The desire to be on the "right" side of the
fence is wide-spread.
Liberation brought nominal independence and
four occupation armies that af the moment eat up

30 per cent of the budget (half of that to the Rus
sians). It brought Soviet troops that looked at Vi
enna's model workers' homes and could not or would
not believe that the Proletariat lived in them. Loot
ing broke out. It brought orders from Moscow for
the removal of a large amount of machinery and
other equipment under the pretense that they were
German assets.
The country's sole oil well—it isn't as big as the
average Texas well—is Russian controlled. The So
viets don't need it: they are selling it to the Czechs,
the Austrians get almost none of it.
Liberation also brought the revival of the old
Christian Socialists. They call themselves the Peo
ple's Party now (that's an insult to the people), and
put on a pseudo-liberal front, but many of its lead
ers are the same people who didn't like democracy
in 1934. Despite Gruber's pious assurances that the
Catholic Church (98 per cent of Austrians are Cath
olic) is now out of politics, it is still a potent force.
The People's Party, at present the strongest, listens
carefully to the Archbishops and the Cardinal.
Why all this discussion about a country whose
main interest for you, if any, lies in fine art, beau
til id scenery, good liquor, and enjoyable women?
First of all, twice in a row events in it have led
to world wars. The Austrian archduke was mur
dered in Sarajewo in 1914 and two months later this
was used as pretext for declaring war on Serbia.
Within three days of that World War I was on. In
1938 the Anschluss was the first major step (outside
of the Rhineland occupation in 1935) in Nazi ag
ression, Sudetenland. Czechoslovakia, Poland, and
World War II followed.
Secondly it is typical in many ways of the plight
of the small European countries, a plight that has
always meant trouble. Between the two wars na
tions like Austria existed in a state of suspended ani
mation too strong to die, too weak to live. Left to
themselves they became helpless victims of aggres
sion. Czechoslovakia, Holland, Belgium, Denmark,
Norway . . . the list is long.
If we create a similar set-up now we will get
similar results. We will again get a lot of bitter
humor coupled with a lot of poverty and little
peace.
We need a situation where people can get enough
to eat (they get less than 1200 calories in Austria
now -we get and need about 3500) and where the
countries are strong enough to have some measure
of political, as well as economic security. In the
Danube area — Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Austria —
the only way this might be achieved is by uniting
them into a common democracy. That would give
them the necessary resources to produce and the
strength for defense.
There are many difficulties in the way. It's not
popular. Grubcr doesn't like it, our State Depart
ment doesn't. Think it over.
