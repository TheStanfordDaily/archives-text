# Forward Pass Credited For Better Grid Shows

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 6 (UP).—The greatest offensive cam
paign in all football history is well past the mid-way mark with
indications that the nation's gridiron ensembles will set an all
time scoring record this year.
And take it from a pair of former Notre Dame athletes who
now are very successful coaches, the fans love it.

Marchie Schwartz, heacl coach at
Stanford, and Buck Shaw, former
Santa Clara and California mentor,
now head man of the San Francisco
'49ers of the All-America Confer
once, have seen nothing like it.
"This is the most entertaining
football season in the history of
the game," says Schwartz. "The
coaches are enjoying their work;
the players are having fun scor
ing a lot of touchdowns—and the
fans are turning out in rccord
brcaking numbers to see some of
the finest entertainment ever of
fered."'
Schwartz and Shaw were unani
mous in their belief that football
rules have nothing to do with the
hi'h-scoring tendencies that have
been developed this year.
"This is the way football should
be played," exclaims Shaw. "It al
ways was my contention to put a
limitation on the defense to get
away from all those scoreless ties or
0-0 games.
"However, the coaches took that
into their own hands by oldening
up the game with the forward
passing attack. There was a time,
a few years back when the for
ward pass was used only as a des
peration offensive weapon: now it
is an integral part of the attack.
"Just a few years ago the average
team used passes on only five to 10
per cent of its plays. Now the ordi
nary club uses the pass for at least
a third of the plays—and with a
good passer, closer to 50 per cent."
Schwartz believes the nation's
football fans owe Clark Shaugh
nessy, former Stanford and now
Maryland head coach, a debt of
gratitude for the great offensive
displays.
"Before Shaughnessy came West
to Stanford to popularize the T-for
mation, lootball was strictly a power
game," Marchie explains. "Ho op
ened up the defenses with his pass
ing attack and made high scoring
the most entertaiping type of foot
ball."
Discounting the runaway scores of
GG-0, which have been going on
since the inception of the game,
here are some of the 1946 games in
which the count totalled 50 or more
points, with the loser getting at
least 20:
Army 4G, Cornell 21; UCLA 46,
St. Marys 20; Boston College 34,
Michigan State ?0; Louisiana State
•'!4, Mississippi 21; Mississippi State
48. University of San Francisco 20:
Northwestern 27, Ohio State 39;
Stanford 33. Santa Clara 26.
"The difference," explains Shaw,
is (hat (he coaches have become
offensive minded and do not pay
as much attention to the defense
as (hey did in by-gone days."
To which Mr. Schwartz adds a
fervent "amen." Because Marchie's
team has scored 137 points to the
opposition's 87 in winning three,
losing two and tying one. Included
in the list were a hectic 20-28 loss
to USC and a wild 33-26 win over
Santa Clara.
