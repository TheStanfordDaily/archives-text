SOUIH BEND. Ind., Nov. 6 (UP)
Johnny Lujack, passing ace and
star quarterback of the Notre Dame
football team, sprained his ankle in
practice today and may not be able
to start in the game against Army
in New York Saturday.
Dr. Joseph Caton. squad physi
cian, said he was uncertain how
serious the injury was and that
an examination tomorrow morn
ing would determine whether Lu
jack would he able to play.
The Connellsville, Pa., quarter
back, playing his second year at
Notre Dame, is the key man in the
T formation which the Irish use. If
his -inkle were stiff, it would inter
fere with his piloting and running
and probably affect his value.
The injury occurred near the
end of practice. The first team
hackficld w as working on pass de
fense, a Notre Dame spokesman
said, and Lujack and Frank Kosi
kouski, second team ynd, went
into the air together after the ball.
If Lujack is unable to start Sat
urday, his place in the lineup prob
ably will be taken by George Rat
terman, second team player who has
played approximately 50 minutes in
the five Notre Dame games this
year.

his Army football team through a
scrimmage today in preparation
for Notre Dame on Saturday, ap
peared unworried about the nu
merically superior Irish manpower
and said "it is possible to have too
much personnel."
Most of Notre Dame's backing
comes from the fact that the Irish
have three or four good teams, while
Army has only a few first-rate subs.
