# Merriman Has Rest; Husky Star Injured
## 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
Lloyd Merriman caused heart palpitations and cold shivers
among the partisan press last night when he failed to show up
for football practice—until Don Liebendorfer, the Indian tub
thumper, announced he was just resting. He's received quite a
mauling in the past few games, and Coach Marchie Schwartz
♦feels a little concentrated loafing

j will do him more good than bruising
drills. He's expected out tonight.
The spirit is good and the boys
should be high for the game when
the Washington Huskies roll into
Stanford Stadium Saturday after
noon. The weatherman hasn't
made any predictions as yet, but
if there isn't a change for the bet
ter soon, it will he the coolest
game day so far (his season. Thai's
muscle - pulling weather, my
friends.
WEINMEISTER HURT AGAIN
Pest Welch's Purple and Gold
eleven, although an in-and-out club,
is supposed to have one of the best
ground attacks on the Coast. Word
from Seattle has it that Arnie Wein
meister, the behemotbic fullback
: tackle, has reinsured his leg and
may not even make the trip. But he
has an understudy at (he fullback
post who has grabbed off a few
headlines on his own account—Sam
Robinson.
The Huskies use variations on
(lie T which, though not as tricky
as (be s(raigh( Shaughnessy stuff,
seem to furnish a hit of power
through (lie line. There is usually
a flanker (o (he right or left, but
often the backs pull a quick chor
us-girl shift (hat throws them in
to (be old Notre Dame box.
Dick Ottele runs the team from
the qb position and does most of
the passing, but left half Larry
Hatch gets in his share of flinging
too. In the straight Notre Dame
plays he gets the ball on a direct
snap from center.
lIAMMETT SHOWS PLAYS
Last night Marchie had a group of
boys working against Husky plays
as diagrammed by Scout Ray Ham
mett —with Hammett himself acting
out the part of Dick Ottele at quar
terback. George Quist again took
the left half slot and Marty Ander
son rounded out his most strenuous
session since his injury by running
the flanker plays from right half.
Mickey Titus and Fred Sander
man looked pretty good on pass
defense. Sanderman has been
looking better and better as the
season progresses. He was hamp
ered at the beginning by bad legs,
but has done a good job of work
ing himself into shape.
At the other end of the field Mar
chie was lending his personal at
tention to a dummy scrimmage in
which plays, new and old, were be
ing honed to a bright sparkle. The
masterpiece will be unveiled to the
public view this Saturday.
Bobby Anderson, the amphibious
footballer, sparkled like a blue dia
mond in this part of the drill. He
was snagging flat passes to both
sides in the deep twilight, when he
couldn't even be expected to see the
ball. Buck Brownson's timing and
his passing also looked sharp.

WEINMEISTER HURT AGAIN
Pest Welch's Purple and Gold
eleven, although an in-and-out club,
is supposed to have one of the best
ground attacks on the Coast. Word
from Seattle has it that Arnie Wein
meister, the behemotbic fullback
: tackle, has reinsured his leg and
may not even make the trip. But he
has an understudy at (he fullback
post who has grabbed off a few
headlines on his own account—Sam
Robinson.
The Huskies use variations on
(lie T which, though not as tricky
as (be s(raigh( Shaughnessy stuff,
seem to furnish a hit of power
through (lie line. There is usually
a flanker (o (he right or left, but
often the backs pull a quick chor
us-girl shift (hat throws them in
to (be old Notre Dame box.
Dick Ottele runs the team from
the qb position and does most of
the passing, but left half Larry
Hatch gets in his share of flinging
too. In the straight Notre Dame
plays he gets the ball on a direct
snap from center.
lIAMMETT SHOWS PLAYS
Last night Marchie had a group of
boys working against Husky plays
as diagrammed by Scout Ray Ham
mett —with Hammett himself acting
out the part of Dick Ottele at quar
terback. George Quist again took
the left half slot and Marty Ander
son rounded out his most strenuous
session since his injury by running
the flanker plays from right half.
Mickey Titus and Fred Sander
man looked pretty good on pass
defense. Sanderman has been
looking better and better as the
season progresses. He was hamp
ered at the beginning by bad legs,
but has done a good job of work
ing himself into shape.
At the other end of the field Mar
chie was lending his personal at
tention to a dummy scrimmage in
which plays, new and old, were be
ing honed to a bright sparkle. The
masterpiece will be unveiled to the
public view this Saturday.
Bobby Anderson, the amphibious
footballer, sparkled like a blue dia
mond in this part of the drill. He
was snagging flat passes to both
sides in the deep twilight, when he
couldn't even be expected to see the
ball. Buck Brownson's timing and
his passing also looked sharp.
Lloyd Merriman caused heart palpitations and cold shivers
among the partisan press last night when he failed to show up
for football practice—until Don Liebendorfer, the Indian tub
thumper, announced he was just resting. He's received quite a
mauling in the past few games, and Coach Marchie Schwartz
♦feels a little concentrated loafing

j will do him more good than bruising
drills. He's expected out tonight.
The spirit is good and the boys
should be high for the game when
the Washington Huskies roll into
Stanford Stadium Saturday after
noon. The weatherman hasn't
made any predictions as yet, but
if there isn't a change for the bet
ter soon, it will he the coolest
game day so far (his season. Thai's
muscle - pulling weather, my
friends.
