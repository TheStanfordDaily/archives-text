# Injun Watermen, Spartans Tangle
## 
### 
Safely established as overwhelming favorites to take the
Pacific Coast Conference Water Polo Championship, the league
leading Stanford Indians will retire from the rigors of league com
petition this week. But the vacation may not develop into such a
bieather after all, as the sensational Indian splashers have
scheduled two rugged practice games -one with San Jose State
and one with the Olympic Club. Tonight at 8:30 they will battle
the Spartans in the San Jose Pool.

Water polo fortunes have been
none too brilliant, for the Spartans
this season, so the rampaging In
dians will go into the game as heavy
favorites. Returning to competition
after a war-time lapse, San Jose has
been faced with a gigantic reorgan
isation job. As a result, the hapless
Spartans have absorbed whippings
at the hands of the Olympic Club
and California. Meanwhile, Stan
ford has chalked up a thrilling 7-6
victory over the Bears and fought
the Olympic Club on equal terms.
Coaches 'l'«m Ilaynie and Ernie
Brandsten hope to take advantage
of the Indian superiority tonight
and give the hard-working first
string some rest. In last Satur
day's crucial California battle, ev
ery starting merman played the
entire game without substitution.
As a result, the Stanford coaching
staff will attempt to shift the load
of tonight's fight to the second
string.
Following the San Jose tilt, the
Indians will return to the Farm to
play host to the Olympic Club is a
Saturday afternoon game. Stan

ford will no doubt be pointing for
a special victory over the Club, since
the San Francisco splashers squeez
ed out a 9-10 win over the Indians
in their last meeting. Revenge
would be sweet for the loc;:ls; the
defeat is the only one that mars
their record. Also, a number of the
members of the Club team are Stan
ford alumni who will be determined
to make their return to the Farm a
winning one.
