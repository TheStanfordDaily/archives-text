# ASSU Governs For 55 Years

### HELEN PINKERTON 
From the first "Plug-Ugly" battles to the recent Pajamarino
storming of Roble, and from the first Student Body election, Oct.
9, 1891, to the election yesterday, responsibility for government
of their own activities has rested on the Stanford students
themselves.

After the first loosening of the
ties which bound faculty and stu
dents so closely together during the
terrible six years of financial dis
pute, conflict arose over student
conduct which could not be handled
in the amicable manner that existed
in the original "Stanford Family."
What became a tug-of-war be
tween the bolder students on the
one hand and the Faculty Com
mittee for Student Affairs on the
other culminated in a crack-down
in 1 !H)G, The campus had been
"wide open" as far as liquor was
concerned, with beer-busts, haz
ing parties, and tubbing a nightly
affair at fraternities and Encina,
which nvas aptl.v called "the mad
house."
After the fatal shooting of a
drunken student in Menlo, the
Trustees acted to bar liquor from
tin- campus and responsibility for
decent conduct was assumed offi
cially by the students. The first
move toward actual student control
was the formation of the University
Conference.
The University Conference,
composed of upper-classmen, was
appointed in 1908 to consult with
the President, the Student Advis
er, Almon E. Roth, then A.S.S.U.
president, and with the Academic
Council. Students expressed their
ideas through the Conference and
worked with the Faculty Com
mittee on Student Affairs.
Forerunners to our present Men's
and Women's Councils were made
subsidiaries of the Conference and
had power to make disciplinary
rules and act in behalf of the Stu
dent Body.
In 1912, with a majority student
vote for "student control," the
framework of government was com
plete.
There was an A.S.S.U. organiza
tion. headed by a president and a
vice-president, who embodied the
legislative and executive functions,
and the two councils which were
the third branch of democratic gov
ernment, the judiciary.
Today Farm student govern
ment is a complex network o! or
ganizations, all subsidiary to the
A.S.S.U. Executive Committee,
and each activity is open to any
student who cares to become a
part of it.
Following is a brief outline of
the student groups, their functions,
and how students may enter the ac
tivity.
EXCOM—President Marty Ander
son. Vice-President Millie Edwards,
and elected representatives from
living areas each Wednesday night
consider and pass the bulk of stu
dent legislation. The Student Man
ager, appointed by the Graduate
Manager, has charge of A.S.S.U.

funds. Excom meetings are open to
all studntts.
WOMEN'S CONFERENCE — The
co-ordinating force of women stu
dents—under the A.S.S.U.—this pol
icy-making and legislative body is
composed of representatives from
all women's living groups, graduate
and off-campus women. Conference
sets up the women's social regula
tions that Women's Council en
forces.
COUNCILS, MEN'S AND WOM
EN'S — These two groups of five
members each have been given the
school's judiciary power. They try
violations of the fundamental stand
aid, the Honor Code, of traffic and
miscellaneous rules and regula
tions. Council members serve a
year, are elected by student vote
in the spring elections.
Women's Council is responsible
for Honor Code education of fresh
man women and in their judicial
work act as an advisory and educa
tional as well as a punitive body.
Under Council's supervision, liv
ing group committee's handle late
leave and social regulations.
CARDINALS — Cardinals plans
and handles almost all A.S.S.U.
functions from dances, rallies, and
drives to welcoming visitors and
miscellaneous problems which ema
nate from Excom. Cardinals, a self
perpetuating organization, each year
appoints successors to carry on its
work.
