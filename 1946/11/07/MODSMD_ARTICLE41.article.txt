Howard Martin and Jack Little's
"Melody Masters" will provide the
music for Union Residence's "Cod
fish Ball" Saturday night. The
"Melody Masters" were organized
this fall, and consist of a group of
Stanford students. They have played
at the Branner formal, and at the
Soph Barn Dance last weekend.
The dance will take place in the
Women's Clubhouse, which will be
turned into an imaginary Fisher
men's Wharf in order to fit the
"Codfish Ball" theme. Tickets for
the dance are being sold to the
whole campus in the A.S.S.U. office
thus week at $2.40 a couple. The
proper attire will be dressy-sport,
and the dance will be held from 9
to 1.
Nets, clam shells, menus of fa
mous restaurants, anchors, and life
preservers will help add to the sea
side atmosphere, said June Sword,
co-chairman for the dance. Re
freshments will be served in the
downstairs gallery and will consist
of coffee, chips, pretzels, and cheese
and crackers.
