# Republicans Plan Overhaul: Low Taxes, Balanced Budget, Lessened Business Controls
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 6 (UP).â€”The Republican Party, trium
phantly in control of Congress for the first time in 16 years,
girded itself tonight for the task of overhauling Democratic do
mestic policies with the aim of lowering taxes and balancing the
budget while lessening government controls on business.

Party leaders were quick in af
firming their determination that
"bureaucracy" and wartime emer
gency powers of the executive
branch mu.st go, but were just as
quick to affirm their continued re
liance upon the "bi-partisan" for
eign policy to which President Tru
man has adhered.
But fears of a domestic stale
mate between a Democratic White
Mouse and a Republican Congress
for the two years remaining of
President Truman's term were
manifest. Sen. J. William Fill
bright, leading Democratic inter
nationalist, suggested that his
party make a contribution to na
tional unity by turning the pres
idency over to the Republican
party al once. Mis idea was backed
by the Chicago Sun in a front
page open letter to the President
signed bv Marshall Field, its pub
lisher.
Fulbriuht thought President Tru
man should appoint Arthur 11. Van
den berg, chief foreign spokesman
of the Republican party, Secretary
of State, and thus put him in line
of succession. Then, according to
the Fulbright plan, Mr. Truman
would resign, Vandenberg would
become President for the remainder
of the Truman term, and the He
publican party would control both
elective branches of the national
government.
In Washington, President. Truman
and other Democratic leaders re
fused comment but Republican Na
tional Chairman Carroll ITeeee said:
"It is a matter between the Presi
dent and his conscience,"
Nationwide returns, complete or
almost complete, showed that the
Republicans had won 245 House
seats, an overwhelming majority.
They won 2l> more seats in the
Senate, giving thein a clear-cut
majority in that body too.
Three Senate races still remained
in doubt. They were in Maryland,
West Virginia and New Mexico.
