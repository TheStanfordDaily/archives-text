# BIG RED MACHINE SET TO HIT HUSKIES
## Merriman May Be on Sidelines 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
Oh woe! Oh woe! Stanford's Indians go gunning for their
second conference victim tomorrow in the Stadium in the shape
of Washington's hot and cold Shaggy Dogs—a 2 1-2 favorite no
less—but by the light of last night's full moon, the chances ap
peared a good deal slimmer than that.

Mr. Football—listed in the bawl
out as Lloyd Merriman—has been
pegged by Coach Marchie Schwartzt
to start his seventh straight ball
game for the Tribe, but unless the
pulled leg muscle in his calf does
j some miraculous recovering be
; tween now and wnistle-blowing
j time (2 p.m.) it's a safe bet he'll ne
benched long before the teams
change sides.
CRAHAN FULLBACK
Unless the calf gets unpulled, the
fullbacking chores will fall to Jack
Crahan — erstwhile fourth-stringer
i —who has been advancing week by
| week up the ladder with a couple of
! precipitous boosts from cruel Fate.
I That last character has deprived the
J Injuns of Gene Martin, definitely
out for this one at least, and Martin
j Anderson, not yet back entirely for
| this one.
Other than that. Stanford is in
fine shape. As Schwartz said:
i "We do not 'fear Purdue' as Mr.
! Stagg did. hut we have respect for
Washington."
FORWARD WALL STEADY
The forward wall is pretty much
the same as it has been all season—
I Dave DeSwarte and Bob Hall pa
trolling the flanks, Charlie Wake
field and Fred Boensch holding
i down the tackles, Bernhard and Bill
Hachten ditto to the guards, and
Dick Flatland working out of the
pivotspot.
In the backfield (oh woe) either
Aubrey Devine or Jack Brownson
will do the signal calling. Boli
Anderson and Mickey Titus will
run from the halfback slots and,
for a while anyway, Merriman
will do the fullbacking.
The Shaggy Dogs (ugh) showed
|up at Pleasanton last night, 36
| strong, but without some beaten up
i gridders of their own. Arnie Wein
j meister, Gerry Austin and Jim
| Thompson are the Washingtonions
left behind nursing various sprains
and breaks, which leaves Pest
' Welch's crew in about the same boat
the Ipjuns are currently residing in.
NICE SAFE SCORE
Meaning that neither team will
I bo at its full offensive strength, and
which precludes any thought of a
plethora of TDs on the part of
i either eleven. A nice safe score, say
Stanford 14, Washington 6, seems to
i be imminent.
A possible Huskic line would
have Dick liagen and Gail Bruce
or Hank Meluskv at the ends, Dim
Tadirh and Ralph Foster at tac
kles, Bob Levenhagen and John
Zegar at guards and Dick McGov
crn at center—making it a big
bruising line that likes to push the
opposition around. The hackfields
have Dick Otelle at qb, Fred Provo
and Larry Hatch at the halves and
Sam Robinson at full—and that's
a high-powered ground attack
plus some good passing.

peared a good deal slimmer than that.

Mr. Football—listed in the bawl
out as Lloyd Merriman—has been
pegged by Coach Marchie Schwartzt
to start his seventh straight ball
game for the Tribe, but unless the
pulled leg muscle in his calf does
j some miraculous recovering be
; tween now and wnistle-blowing
j time (2 p.m.) it's a safe bet he'll ne
benched long before the teams
change sides.
CRAHAN FULLBACK
Unless the calf gets unpulled, the
fullbacking chores will fall to Jack
Crahan — erstwhile fourth-stringer
i —who has been advancing week by
| week up the ladder with a couple of
! precipitous boosts from cruel Fate.
I That last character has deprived the
J Injuns of Gene Martin, definitely
out for this one at least, and Martin
j Anderson, not yet back entirely for
| this one.
Other than that. Stanford is in
fine shape. As Schwartz said:
i "We do not 'fear Purdue' as Mr.
! Stagg did. hut we have respect for
Washington."
FORWARD WALL STEADY
The forward wall is pretty much
the same as it has been all season—
I Dave DeSwarte and Bob Hall pa
trolling the flanks, Charlie Wake
field and Fred Boensch holding
i down the tackles, Bernhard and Bill
Hachten ditto to the guards, and
Dick Flatland working out of the
pivotspot.
In the backfield (oh woe) either
Aubrey Devine or Jack Brownson
will do the signal calling. Boli
Anderson and Mickey Titus will
run from the halfback slots and,
for a while anyway, Merriman
will do the fullbacking.
The Shaggy Dogs (ugh) showed
|up at Pleasanton last night, 36
| strong, but without some beaten up
i gridders of their own. Arnie Wein
j meister, Gerry Austin and Jim
| Thompson are the Washingtonions
left behind nursing various sprains
and breaks, which leaves Pest
' Welch's crew in about the same boat
the Ipjuns are currently residing in.
NICE SAFE SCORE
Meaning that neither team will
I bo at its full offensive strength, and
which precludes any thought of a
plethora of TDs on the part of
i either eleven. A nice safe score, say
Stanford 14, Washington 6, seems to
i be imminent.
A possible Huskic line would
have Dick liagen and Gail Bruce
or Hank Meluskv at the ends, Dim
Tadirh and Ralph Foster at tac
kles, Bob Levenhagen and John
Zegar at guards and Dick McGov
crn at center—making it a big
bruising line that likes to push the
opposition around. The hackfields
have Dick Otelle at qb, Fred Provo
and Larry Hatch at the halves and
Sam Robinson at full—and that's
a high-powered ground attack
plus some good passing.
Oh woe! Oh woe! Stanford's Indians go gunning for their
second conference victim tomorrow in the Stadium in the shape
of Washington's hot and cold Shaggy Dogs—a 2 1-2 favorite no
less—but by the light of last night's full moon, the chances ap
peared a good deal slimmer than that.
