# Four Feather Relief Drive Starts Monday; $14,000 Goal
## 
### 
Stanford's Four Feather Relief
Fund drive, which gets under way
Monday with a goal of $14,000 to be
raised by the end of the week, will
be a "student to student" drive,
according to Janet Ossman, drive
chairman.
The fund, which will have to be
raised by at least a $2 contribution
from every Stanford student, will
go to Community Chest, World Stu
dent Service Fund (WSSF), Infan
tile Paralysis Fund, and Floating
Fund for emergency drives.
WORLD-WIDE All)
In the end the total raised will
go to relieve needs all over the
world. World Student Service
Fund, the American counterpart
of World Student Relief, will send
tubercular students in Europe to
the International Sanatorium in
Lcysin, Switzerland.
At the present time WSR head
quarters in Geneva report that with
present facilities only one out of
every 1.000 tubercular students in
Europe can be cured. The m l will
die if they don't get help, and over
10 per cent of Europe's students
have tuberculosis.
FOOD SENT STUDENTS
In addition WSSF sends food to
students abroad, thousands of
whom arc at the present time
living on only 950 to 1,200 calo

tics of food a day, while Ameri
can students live on from U,400 lo
3,t>o() calorics a day.
Textbooks and other necessary
study equipment, clothing, and
housing facilities are also provided
by the Fund.
The Community Chest uses its
fund to give hospital, food, and
clothing aid to needy families and
homes, and to support Scouts, Y.M.-
C.A. and Y.W.C.A. recreation proj
ects, and other character - building
organizations necessary for the de
velopment of the community.
The proportion that goes for the
Floating Fund is a reserve which
can be used when emergency needs
arrive tl Â«t Stanford students wish
to contribute to without having an
extra drive.
