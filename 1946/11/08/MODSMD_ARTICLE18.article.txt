## Student Union—Yes or No? 
### 
The Union Planning Committee two weeks
ago called for discussion on the proposal that
Stanford erect as a War Memorial a costly
Union. Committee members have asked if
the student body specifically wants and v/ould
support a Union, and if the Union should' hold
top priority as a War Memorial, once the need
for it has been defined. The Committee ex
pects that additional ideas for a War Memorial
will be offered —and wants them to be heard
and evaluated seriously before any decision
is made on the Union question.

Below are printed campus opinions con
taining comment on the Union and War Me
morial. In printing them, we want to remind
the students that a questionnaire will be issued
to them soon exploring their opinions on the
purpose, possible facilities, and degree of
need for the Union. Poll results will largely
determine the fate of the Union proposal, as
well as alternatives, such as those printed be
low. So it is a matter not to be lightly con
sidered.
