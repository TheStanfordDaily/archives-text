To the Editor:
I agree that we need a new Student Union; but
first 1 should like to know what the contemplated
cost of the new Union is, and secondly how much
money is available. A good new Student Union
would probably cost a great deal, and if we have a
million dollars at our disposal, then we could pro
ceed to build; otherwise, we had better not consider
a Union until adequate funds are available, for we
should build a good one when we build it.
II we do not have enough money available to
build an adequate Student Union, then why not build
an International House? Can you think of a more
appropriate war memorial? Such a memorial would
be a real tangible effort toward reaching the goal
for which they—the follows whom we are memorial
izing - fought; a goal which I suppose we could de
fine as "permanent peace."
The magnitude of the problem of achieving per
manent peace overwhelms us. We can hardly imag
ine a solution, let alone project and participate in
one. We shrug our shoulders and say, "What can
we do?"
I.i<: answer is quite simple—we can start right
her at home and promote international understand
ing in our own small but nevertheless very important
way. We can build an International House as a
memorial to the Stanford veterans who died in
World War 11. A great number of universities in
the United States have international houses: Cal,
Chicago, Colorado, etc.
A University the size of Stanford should have an
Intel national House. Why not?

To the Editor:
I wrote in to the Daily last week * advocating
a new and enlarged Post Office as a War Memorial.
A member of the War Memorial Committee has cor
responded with me and he states:
"I agree with you completely that a more ade
quate Post Office is a prime need on the campus. But
I'm afraid that the committee will be more prone to
con icier some memorial less governmental than a
Post Office would be."
Members of the committee have all promised to
bring the suggestion for a new Post Office as a War
Memorial before the committee when they convene;
but it will probably be shuffled into the dim, uncer
tain future unless our voices cry out for more than
consideration. We must have action and have it
now.
The situation as I see it is this: the government
can't do anything because Stanford owns the land
and the building and leases the property to the
United States. Therefore the problem is a Stanford
problem and it's up to the Stanford public to make
their wants known to the proper authorities. If it
can't in itself be a war memorial because of the
"governmental" label, let's go beyond that and insist
that something be done within the proposed Union
itself, in order to get the new Post Office quickly in
answer to the need.
Since Stanford receives considerable revenue

from the government on a yearly basis, let's ask in
stead of a new Post Oflice building that we request
and urge the powers that be to consider a new Union
equipped properly to house the Post Oflice adequate
ly and efficiently. That will not take away the reve
nue that Stanford receives from the government and
it could not be considered a "governmental project."
There are some ideal sites available for such a Union,
and having the Post Office centrally located would
certainly be "beneficial and serviceable" to every
body. We must make one request and that is that
plenty of space be allowed so that the public and
employees won't have to put up With the cramped
conditions that exist now. However, if there is no
hope for a materialization of a new Union until no
one knows when, that won't alleviate or solve a need
which is immediate, will it?
Robert D. Collyer
To the Editor:
The letter of the Union Planning Committee print
ed in the Daily contained the words "there certainly
can be little argument that a new Student Union
would be the most useful and living monument that
could be built." Admitting the need for a new Union,
I suggest that there is, however, another project
which would be more suitable as a War Memorial.
It would seem that the most appropriate memo
rial would be one which would contribute directly
to the maintenance of peace—to the securing of the
purpose for which those whom the memorial would'
commemorate fought. There are many ways which
a memorial to contribute to peace could be expressed.
One would be the endowment of Stanford Inter
national Exchange Fellowships, so that by the mu
tual association of students of various countries the
people of the nations could come to know each other
better, and so contribute to peace. As pointed out in
a recent meeting of the U:N.E.S.C.O.. this is one of
the most important contributions that could- be made.
At the center of such a project could be an Inter
national House on campus, containing living quarters
"for both foreign and American students, and also
assembly halls for civic organizations, a dining room
and perhaps a large social room, and perhaps study
facilities for students in international relations.
This project would have the dignity, usefulness,
and high purpose appropriate to a War Memorial
and, by contributing to peace, it would fittingly re
member those who fought in the recent war. Fur
ther. such a project could be advantageously corre
lated with the Hoover Memorial Library.
There is one thing more. There seems to be a real
chance that the United Nations headquarters will be
located in the Bay Area, perhaps only a few miles
from Stanford. In such an eventuality hundreds of
internationally minded students from all over the
world would be drawn to this area. This would
create an unparalleled opportunity for the students
of Stanford, through their War Memorial, to con
tribute to permanent peace.
The writer invites other students to write the
Daily their views on this proposal.

can be little argument that a new Student Union
would be the most useful and living monument that
could be built." Admitting the need for a new Union,
I suggest that there is, however, another project
which would be more suitable as a War Memorial.
It would seem that the most appropriate memo
rial would be one which would contribute directly
to the maintenance of peace—to the securing of the
purpose for which those whom the memorial would'
commemorate fought. There are many ways which
a memorial to contribute to peace could be expressed.
One would be the endowment of Stanford Inter
national Exchange Fellowships, so that by the mu
tual association of students of various countries the
people of the nations could come to know each other
better, and so contribute to peace. As pointed out in
a recent meeting of the U:N.E.S.C.O.. this is one of
the most important contributions that could- be made.
At the center of such a project could be an Inter
national House on campus, containing living quarters
"for both foreign and American students, and also
assembly halls for civic organizations, a dining room
and perhaps a large social room, and perhaps study
facilities for students in international relations.
This project would have the dignity, usefulness,
and high purpose appropriate to a War Memorial
and, by contributing to peace, it would fittingly re
member those who fought in the recent war. Fur
ther. such a project could be advantageously corre
lated with the Hoover Memorial Library.
There is one thing more. There seems to be a real
chance that the United Nations headquarters will be
located in the Bay Area, perhaps only a few miles
from Stanford. In such an eventuality hundreds of
internationally minded students from all over the
world would be drawn to this area. This would
create an unparalleled opportunity for the students
of Stanford, through their War Memorial, to con
tribute to permanent peace.

To the Editor:
I agree that we need a new Student Union; but
first 1 should like to know what the contemplated
cost of the new Union is, and secondly how much
money is available. A good new Student Union
would probably cost a great deal, and if we have a
million dollars at our disposal, then we could pro
ceed to build; otherwise, we had better not consider
a Union until adequate funds are available, for we
should build a good one when we build it.
II we do not have enough money available to
build an adequate Student Union, then why not build
an International House? Can you think of a more
appropriate war memorial? Such a memorial would
be a real tangible effort toward reaching the goal
for which they—the follows whom we are memorial
izing - fought; a goal which I suppose we could de
fine as "permanent peace."
The magnitude of the problem of achieving per
manent peace overwhelms us. We can hardly imag
ine a solution, let alone project and participate in
one. We shrug our shoulders and say, "What can
we do?"
I.i<: answer is quite simple—we can start right
her at home and promote international understand
ing in our own small but nevertheless very important
way. We can build an International House as a
memorial to the Stanford veterans who died in
World War 11. A great number of universities in
the United States have international houses: Cal,
Chicago, Colorado, etc.
A University the size of Stanford should have an
Intel national House. Why not?

To the Editor:
I wrote in to the Daily last week * advocating
a new and enlarged Post Office as a War Memorial.
A member of the War Memorial Committee has cor
responded with me and he states:
"I agree with you completely that a more ade
quate Post Office is a prime need on the campus. But
I'm afraid that the committee will be more prone to
con icier some memorial less governmental than a
Post Office would be."
Members of the committee have all promised to
bring the suggestion for a new Post Office as a War
Memorial before the committee when they convene;
but it will probably be shuffled into the dim, uncer
tain future unless our voices cry out for more than
consideration. We must have action and have it
now.
The situation as I see it is this: the government
can't do anything because Stanford owns the land
and the building and leases the property to the
United States. Therefore the problem is a Stanford
problem and it's up to the Stanford public to make
their wants known to the proper authorities. If it
can't in itself be a war memorial because of the
"governmental" label, let's go beyond that and insist
that something be done within the proposed Union
itself, in order to get the new Post Office quickly in
answer to the need.
Since Stanford receives considerable revenue

from the government on a yearly basis, let's ask in
stead of a new Post Oflice building that we request
and urge the powers that be to consider a new Union
equipped properly to house the Post Oflice adequate
ly and efficiently. That will not take away the reve
nue that Stanford receives from the government and
it could not be considered a "governmental project."
There are some ideal sites available for such a Union,
and having the Post Office centrally located would
certainly be "beneficial and serviceable" to every
body. We must make one request and that is that
plenty of space be allowed so that the public and
employees won't have to put up With the cramped
conditions that exist now. However, if there is no
hope for a materialization of a new Union until no
one knows when, that won't alleviate or solve a need
which is immediate, will it?

quate Post Office is a prime need on the campus. But
I'm afraid that the committee will be more prone to
con icier some memorial less governmental than a
Post Office would be."
Members of the committee have all promised to
bring the suggestion for a new Post Office as a War
Memorial before the committee when they convene;
but it will probably be shuffled into the dim, uncer
tain future unless our voices cry out for more than
consideration. We must have action and have it
now.
The situation as I see it is this: the government
can't do anything because Stanford owns the land
and the building and leases the property to the
United States. Therefore the problem is a Stanford
problem and it's up to the Stanford public to make
their wants known to the proper authorities. If it
can't in itself be a war memorial because of the
"governmental" label, let's go beyond that and insist
that something be done within the proposed Union
itself, in order to get the new Post Office quickly in
answer to the need.
Since Stanford receives considerable revenue

from the government on a yearly basis, let's ask in
stead of a new Post Oflice building that we request
and urge the powers that be to consider a new Union
equipped properly to house the Post Oflice adequate
ly and efficiently. That will not take away the reve
nue that Stanford receives from the government and
it could not be considered a "governmental project."
There are some ideal sites available for such a Union,
and having the Post Office centrally located would
certainly be "beneficial and serviceable" to every
body. We must make one request and that is that
plenty of space be allowed so that the public and
employees won't have to put up With the cramped
conditions that exist now. However, if there is no
hope for a materialization of a new Union until no
one knows when, that won't alleviate or solve a need
which is immediate, will it?
Robert D. Collyer
To the Editor:
The letter of the Union Planning Committee print
ed in the Daily contained the words "there certainly
can be little argument that a new Student Union
would be the most useful and living monument that
could be built." Admitting the need for a new Union,
I suggest that there is, however, another project
which would be more suitable as a War Memorial.
It would seem that the most appropriate memo
rial would be one which would contribute directly
to the maintenance of peace—to the securing of the
purpose for which those whom the memorial would'
commemorate fought. There are many ways which
a memorial to contribute to peace could be expressed.
One would be the endowment of Stanford Inter
national Exchange Fellowships, so that by the mu
tual association of students of various countries the
people of the nations could come to know each other
better, and so contribute to peace. As pointed out in
a recent meeting of the U:N.E.S.C.O.. this is one of
the most important contributions that could- be made.
At the center of such a project could be an Inter
national House on campus, containing living quarters
"for both foreign and American students, and also
assembly halls for civic organizations, a dining room
and perhaps a large social room, and perhaps study
facilities for students in international relations.
This project would have the dignity, usefulness,
and high purpose appropriate to a War Memorial
and, by contributing to peace, it would fittingly re
member those who fought in the recent war. Fur
ther. such a project could be advantageously corre
lated with the Hoover Memorial Library.
There is one thing more. There seems to be a real
chance that the United Nations headquarters will be
located in the Bay Area, perhaps only a few miles
from Stanford. In such an eventuality hundreds of
internationally minded students from all over the
world would be drawn to this area. This would
create an unparalleled opportunity for the students
of Stanford, through their War Memorial, to con
tribute to permanent peace.
The writer invites other students to write the
Daily their views on this proposal.

To the Editor:
I agree that we need a new Student Union; but
first 1 should like to know what the contemplated
cost of the new Union is, and secondly how much
money is available. A good new Student Union
would probably cost a great deal, and if we have a
million dollars at our disposal, then we could pro
ceed to build; otherwise, we had better not consider
a Union until adequate funds are available, for we
should build a good one when we build it.
II we do not have enough money available to
build an adequate Student Union, then why not build
an International House? Can you think of a more
appropriate war memorial? Such a memorial would
be a real tangible effort toward reaching the goal
for which they—the follows whom we are memorial
izing - fought; a goal which I suppose we could de
fine as "permanent peace."
The magnitude of the problem of achieving per
manent peace overwhelms us. We can hardly imag
ine a solution, let alone project and participate in
one. We shrug our shoulders and say, "What can
we do?"
I.i<: answer is quite simple—we can start right
her at home and promote international understand
ing in our own small but nevertheless very important
way. We can build an International House as a
memorial to the Stanford veterans who died in
World War 11. A great number of universities in
the United States have international houses: Cal,
Chicago, Colorado, etc.
A University the size of Stanford should have an
Intel national House. Why not?
