Unless you are a speed demon
with piles of little yellow subpoe
nas, you probably know next to
nothing about the Men's Council.
To help clear up all the doubt and
confusion surrounding this branch
of the A.S.S.U., herewith follows a
Pocket 'Guide to Men's Council.
It tells all—who, what, and why
Men's Council is. Also what it does,
because in spite of many recent
criticisms, it really does do things.
Men's Council is made up of
five members of the student body
who are elected in the A.S.S.U.
elections — remember? It was
once suggested that the members
be appointed rather than elected.
liut an amendment to that effect
was voted down by the student
body. Right now Men's Council
consists of Chairman John Church,
Roland (Ted) Lee, Joseph Clark,
and since yesterday, Stan Shpet
ner and Dick Bartle.
The Men's Council was set up to
provide Stanford men with a stu
dent - operated disciplinary board.
The constitution states that: "The
Men's Council shall have charge of
the settlement of all cases of a dis
ciplinary nature in all matters per
taining to the male student body of
Stanford University. ... It shall
be the duty of the Council to hear
all cases which may come before
it. It shall take action in the form
of a recommendation of the dispo
sition to be made of the case."
That line about trying all cases
which come before it has led the

Council to handle a pretty hie
variety of problems. At lirst the
majority of the cases had to do
with violations of the Honor Code.
For this the Five Young Men
dished out suspensions and added
hours to the nuir.oer required for
the student's graduation.
What with the coming of the
automobile, the Council began to
spend more and more oi its time
on traffic violations and speeding
cases. Today about half of all cases
considered are traffic cases, for
which the Five Young Men dole out
fines. Their power and influence
are illustrated by the fact that in
IS3B they received a check from an
alumnus for a traffic fine given in
1932.
At one time the Council han
dled quite a few liquor violations,
hut since the quality of students
has gone up and the quality of
liquor has gone down to the point
where those things just don't hap
pen any more.
The Men's Council is always on
the alert to protect the fledgfing
freshmen in their first venture out
into the mean old world. They have
several times punished the sopho
mores for raiding the babes in En
cina.
The Council aiso decided that
Roughs Day was getting too rough,
and scratched it off the list of Farm
traditions. During the present war,
they went all out for defense and
cracked down on all blackout viola
tors.

of a recommendation of the dispo
sition to be made of the case."
That line about trying all cases
which come before it has led the

Council to handle a pretty hie
variety of problems. At lirst the
majority of the cases had to do
with violations of the Honor Code.
For this the Five Young Men
dished out suspensions and added
hours to the nuir.oer required for
the student's graduation.
What with the coming of the
automobile, the Council began to
spend more and more oi its time
on traffic violations and speeding
cases. Today about half of all cases
considered are traffic cases, for
which the Five Young Men dole out
fines. Their power and influence
are illustrated by the fact that in
IS3B they received a check from an
alumnus for a traffic fine given in
1932.
At one time the Council han
dled quite a few liquor violations,
hut since the quality of students
has gone up and the quality of
liquor has gone down to the point
where those things just don't hap
pen any more.
The Men's Council is always on
the alert to protect the fledgfing
freshmen in their first venture out
into the mean old world. They have
several times punished the sopho
mores for raiding the babes in En
cina.
The Council aiso decided that
Roughs Day was getting too rough,
and scratched it off the list of Farm
traditions. During the present war,
they went all out for defense and
cracked down on all blackout viola
tors.

Unless you are a speed demon
with piles of little yellow subpoe
nas, you probably know next to
nothing about the Men's Council.
To help clear up all the doubt and
confusion surrounding this branch
of the A.S.S.U., herewith follows a
Pocket 'Guide to Men's Council.
It tells all—who, what, and why
Men's Council is. Also what it does,
because in spite of many recent
criticisms, it really does do things.
Men's Council is made up of
five members of the student body
who are elected in the A.S.S.U.
elections — remember? It was
once suggested that the members
be appointed rather than elected.
liut an amendment to that effect
was voted down by the student
body. Right now Men's Council
consists of Chairman John Church,
Roland (Ted) Lee, Joseph Clark,
and since yesterday, Stan Shpet
ner and Dick Bartle.
The Men's Council was set up to
provide Stanford men with a stu
dent - operated disciplinary board.
The constitution states that: "The
Men's Council shall have charge of
the settlement of all cases of a dis
ciplinary nature in all matters per
taining to the male student body of
Stanford University. ... It shall
be the duty of the Council to hear
all cases which may come before
it. It shall take action in the form
of a recommendation of the dispo
sition to be made of the case."
