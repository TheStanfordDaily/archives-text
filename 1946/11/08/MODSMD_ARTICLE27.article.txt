# Cal Aggies Favored Over Indian Jayvees
## 
### 
Despite the 2-1 odds against them. Coach Ed Stamm's spirited Jayvees
have hopes oi' upsetting the powerful Cal Aggies at Davis tomorrow.
Coach Vern Mickey's Aggies have different ideas about the afternoon's
festivities and are pointing for a lopsided win over the Card juniors.
Stamm's men go through a light drill this afternoon, with more work

on passing unci defense against the
Aggie T.
Dave Field, who rates this
week's starting call at quarter
hack, is, despite his lack of ex
perience, a highly capable field
general and a good passer. While
Field is on the bench, Dave Mel
ton can he called on for some able
subbing at the QB spot.
The .starling call at left half g%es
to Ken Peck, who turned in a bang
up performance against the S.C.
Jayvees. Peck is a consistent yard
gainer and a heads-up defensive
back. .
Jim O'Neill, who injured his
shoulder several weeks ago, is
back in shape and ready for his
best game at the right half start
ing position. Big John Barnes
again earns the starting fullback
berth.
The Card line, well-drilled and
hard-hitting from end to end, is
anchored by capable wingmen Doug
Murray and Walker Smith. Howie
Council and Sid Smith are the Jay
vees' number one pair of tackles.
Council plays a rough, smart game
at left tackle from the word go, and
Smith ably handles the right tackle
assignments.
Starting guards Don Fix and Jim
McKillip are big and hard to push
around. Fix at left guard and Mc-
Killip at right. In the middle of
the strong forward wall is starting
center Bill Shirey, who filled in
ably when Bob Regier went up to
the varsity. However, Regior re
turned to the Jayvees this week and
will see action tomorrow at his old
center spot.
Little Willie Alius and his mag
ic loe will definitely travel up to
Davis. Atus, who played at left
half earlier in the season, suffered
a nerve injury in his shoulder and
is trotted on the field only for
extra-point and field goal tries,
lie never misses!
The Jayvees l<?ave for Davis at 8
a.m. tomorrow. The kickoff will be
at 2:15.
