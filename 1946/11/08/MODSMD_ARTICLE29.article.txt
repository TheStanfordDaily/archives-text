# Card Mermen Seek Revenge; Meet Olympic Club Tomorrow
## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon's invasion of the Encina pool by the veteran
Olympic Club water polo team will afford the rugged Stanford splash
er? a chance to avenge their one and only loss of the season. Early in
the season, the PCC league-leading Indians visited the San Francisco
club, only to drop a 10-9 decision. Since that opening conit?st, Stanford

has methodically chalked up four
straight wins over conference op
ponents. The "revenge" match will
start at 1:15 tomorrow afternoon at
the Encina pool.
The Indians' chances to reverse
the score at the expense of the
Olympic Club have increased
weekly as the locals rounded their
deadly offensive into top form. At
the present time, with decisive vic
tories over U.S.C., U.0.L.A., and
California gracing the record.
Stanford will actually enter the
game as slight favorites.
Playing the game in a foreign pool
may hamper the Olympic Club to
some extent. The San Francisco
plunge is a great deal shorter than
the regulation Stanford pool, so the
rapid pace of the speedy Indians
may submerge the Clubbers. Of
course, the youthful enthusiasm in
the Indian squad will probably add
to the misery of the Olympic Club,
which is not exactly composed of
youngsters.
But the veteran mermen from
San Francisco have an amazing
ability of cutting down vaunted col
lege teams when least expected.
California found this fact out after
squeezing out a one-point victory.
The Olympic Club merely came
back in a return match and humili
ated the Bears, 11-1. Thus the out
come of tomorrow's meeting will
probably not follow the form charts
at all.
Indian hopes for victory will
again rest upon the seven rug
ged men who have started most
of their winning games. The scor
ing depart moot will no doubt be
ably handled In a brilliant front
line that has averaged 11 points
per game against league oppo
nents. Itarry Rorchers at center
forward position leads the team
with 1.1 markers, while Jim Arm
strong has pushed in 10 points for
the Indin I mnictt Cashin, who
was high-point man in the cru
cial California game, will open to
morrow's game at his forward po
sition.
In the baekfield, Stanford will
start Duiican Patty. A 1 Wooden, and
Dick Nir \e; The defense thrown
up b' tli • Indians in the Bear gam?
was im outstanding factor in the
win. Bud Carpenter will be en
trusted with protecting the goal
against the strong Olympic offen
sive.
Origin,! Ih the Olympic Club
game wa.s scheduled for late after

Tomorrow afternoon's invasion of the Encina pool by the veteran
Olympic Club water polo team will afford the rugged Stanford splash
er? a chance to avenge their one and only loss of the season. Early in
the season, the PCC league-leading Indians visited the San Francisco
club, only to drop a 10-9 decision. Since that opening conit?st, Stanford

has methodically chalked up four
straight wins over conference op
ponents. The "revenge" match will
start at 1:15 tomorrow afternoon at
the Encina pool.
The Indians' chances to reverse
the score at the expense of the
Olympic Club have increased
weekly as the locals rounded their
deadly offensive into top form. At
the present time, with decisive vic
tories over U.S.C., U.0.L.A., and
California gracing the record.
Stanford will actually enter the
game as slight favorites.
Playing the game in a foreign pool
may hamper the Olympic Club to
some extent. The San Francisco
plunge is a great deal shorter than
the regulation Stanford pool, so the
rapid pace of the speedy Indians
may submerge the Clubbers. Of
course, the youthful enthusiasm in
the Indian squad will probably add
to the misery of the Olympic Club,
which is not exactly composed of
youngsters.
But the veteran mermen from
San Francisco have an amazing
ability of cutting down vaunted col
lege teams when least expected.
California found this fact out after
squeezing out a one-point victory.
The Olympic Club merely came
back in a return match and humili
ated the Bears, 11-1. Thus the out
come of tomorrow's meeting will
probably not follow the form charts
at all.
Indian hopes for victory will
again rest upon the seven rug
ged men who have started most
of their winning games. The scor
ing depart moot will no doubt be
ably handled In a brilliant front
line that has averaged 11 points
per game against league oppo
nents. Itarry Rorchers at center
forward position leads the team
with 1.1 markers, while Jim Arm
strong has pushed in 10 points for
the Indin I mnictt Cashin, who
was high-point man in the cru
cial California game, will open to
morrow's game at his forward po
sition.
In the baekfield, Stanford will
start Duiican Patty. A 1 Wooden, and
Dick Nir \e; The defense thrown
up b' tli • Indians in the Bear gam?
was im outstanding factor in the
win. Bud Carpenter will be en
trusted with protecting the goal
against the strong Olympic offen
sive.
