# AVC Argues GOP Victory
## 
### 
The possible effects that last Tues
day's elections will have on the
American way of life brought forth
diverse opinions from George Brunn
and Ted Norton at last night's Amer
ican Veterans Committee meeting at
the Village.
Norton discussed the state propo
sitions and interpreted their ac
acceptance or denial by the voters.
He concluded that the people "chose
wisely."
BRUNN COMMENTS
Brunn used the national elections
as a basis for comment. He called
the Republican promise to balance
the budget as a "miracle that I
would like to see."
The two speakers agreed that no
great change in foreign policy
would be forthcoming.
The meeting, which was held in
the Village dining hall instead of
the auditorium because af a mix-up
in dates, was also an election meet
ing. Frank Maggipinto, graduate
student, was chosen as AVC chair
man. He will hold office for six
months.
OFFICERS ELECTED
Other officers selected included:
Verona Hardy, vice-chairman; Lau
ra Pat ton, secretary; and Jack Col
burn, treasurer. Committee heads
elected were Hayden Scott, mem
bership and publicity, and Dick
Ryan, program.
Four delegates were chosen ten
tatively for an AVC pre-state con
vention meeting to be held in San
Francisco on Sunday, Nov. 17.
