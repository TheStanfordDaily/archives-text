# Hoop Team Cut For First Tilt
## 
### 
The varsity basketball squad was
taken to the shearers yesterday and
came out of it with two teams of 24
hoopsters each.
The division of Ihe eourtmen into
"A" and "B" squads brought the
: varsity almost down to its future
conference strength. A few revi
sions and changes are still in the
offing, and promotions and demo
tions may te affected prior to the
curtain raising game Nov. 25 with
| San Jose State.
When questioned as to the In
dian's chances during the coming
1 season. Coach Everett Dean replied,

"Your guess is as good as mine. We
have plenty of material, but the
quality is an unknown factor. Some
of the boys are really good, but the
loss of Howie Dallmar and the
greenness of the squad will tend to
make things a little tough for us."
Coach Dean also revealed that
the Cardinal hoopsters will go on
the road during Christmas vacation
to meet basketball teams in the
Midwest. Among the games sched
uled in that "hot-bed" of basketball
are contests with Michigan, Bradley
Tech, and Michigan State. The
cross-country trek will be the first
post-war expedition for the Indian
hoopsters.
The "A"' squad, or varsity, now is
composed of Berlin, Cashel. Che
valis, Christiansen. Iverson. Irwin,
King, Layman, Loddy, Lewis 8.,
Lewis F., Murphy. Meredith, Oliver.
Rowe, Sloat. Stephenson, Thomp
son, Wallis, West. Wood. Yardley,
Davidson, and Drehobl.
