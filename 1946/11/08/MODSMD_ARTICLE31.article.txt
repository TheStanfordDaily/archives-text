# Indian Foilsmen Face Cal Grads
## 
### 
The Stanford foilsmen will battle
the California Fencing Club in the
Men's Gym at 8 tonight in what will
probably be the last match of the
season for the Indian competitors.
The California team is not the
regular Bear squad, but a club made
up of graduate students and other
U.C. men not eligible for the offi
cial Blue and Gold fencing team.
Representing the Cardinals will
be Coach Elwyn Bugge's regular
five-man team, James Ciooker,
Fred Williams, Alfred Larson, Phil
Mitchell, and Dave Evenson. The
Berkeley club members have done
a lot of fencing already and are ex
perienced foilsmen who should give
their Indian hosts an excellent
match.
