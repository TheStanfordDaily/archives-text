# Sex Con fusion Told old by Mead
## 
### 
American children are confused about their own sex. Boys
have feminine consciences from being brought up by mother
and girls are told not to be sissies. From this confusion stems
American alcoholism, because the boys cannot live up to their
mother's expectations, and mother takes out her frustration at
having to stay home by pushing son.

Thus Dr. Margaret Mead, speak-
inn to an over-flowing audience in |
Cubberley Auditorium yesterday, /
traced the "Patterns of Sex Differ
ence in Contemporary United
Slates."
The "jungle" of our civilization j
h;is its roots in pioneer women who
took over entire management of the 1
home, breaking down the patriar
chal European system. Also when
families came to America, children
were able to defy paternal author
ity and leave home to earn their
own living.
DUAL ROLE FOR BOYS
American hoys are around wo
men all during their early life.
They are told to be gentlemanly
and at the same time to "stand up
for their rights." The boys are j
confused ami as a result have in
vented the "chip on the shoulder
custom" to have an excuse for
fighting. Dr. Mead pointed to the
Pearl Harbor attack as the "chip
on the shoulder" excuse on an in
ternational scale.
In a national poll Dr. Mead said
it was indicated that mother stood |
in men's minds for "duty" and fa
ther for "indulgence."
The main confusion, which causes
most pain to the girl in our society,
is that both boys and girls are
brought up alike until the girl mar
ries. She is then told that she is a i
woman, and despite her desire and
expectation of entering a profession, '
she must stay home and bring up
the children.
SHOCK ILLUSTRATED
To bring home the effect of this
shock to the men in the audience, I
Dr. Mead cited the radical change
the draft made in the lives of the
men and the effect it would have on
a boy if he were compelled to be
come a farmer upon marriage, de
spite his preparation and desire to
be something else.
This sudden discontinuity causes j
an odd kind of woman, the an
thropologist said. "Mom" will al
ways feci that she has "given up
everything" and will make the
children "pay for it the rest of
their lives." She throws the bur
den of her frustration on the son
and expects great things of him,
often greater than he has the abil
ity to achieve.
LET FATHER IN HOME
The failure of American men to |
take responsibility for anything but 1
mechanical things around the home |
must be changed and "father must
be let into the home," Dr. Mead as
serted.
On a national scale, she main
tained, Americans must take re- ;
sponsibility for their actions. We
must no longer be the well-mean
ing "sucker" or the "chip on the
shoulder" nation, but must invest
our male interest in machinery in
keeping the machinery of the world
in running order,â€”Pinkerton.
