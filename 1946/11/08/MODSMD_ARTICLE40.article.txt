Only two bright spots are evident
in Europe today, according to Eva
Schiff, youth director of the West
ern Division of American Brother
hood. the National Conference of
Christians and Jews, who spoke at
a YWCA meeting Wednesday.
One of the bright spots was the
International Conference of Chris
tians and Jews at Oxford, Eng
land, which Miss SehilV attended
(his summer as the only youth
delegate from the Western United
States. The World Federation of
Democratic Youths in Paris was
the other encouraging organization
she discovered in her tour of Hol
land,* Switzerland, Belgium, and
France.
The International Conference of
Christians and Jews was attended
by 130 delegates from 15 nations.
The conference was divided into six
commissions including the youth
group which was composed of 25
students and headed by Miss Schiff.
According to her the feeling that
Christians and Jews could work to
ward brotherhood pervaded the
meeting. The delegates were not
interested in passing resolutions.
They wanted to accomplish some
thing tangible.
As a result of the conference the
international organization was set
up as a permanent committee in
Paris and is affiliated with the
U.N. A workshop on anti-Semi
tism was organized in Zurich,
Switzerland, and, stated Miss
SchifY, the Christian and Jewish
delegates found they could work
together to accomplish definite
aims.
The workshop will be backed fi
nancially by other international or
ganizations. Educators, religious
leaders, sociologists and psycholo
gists will be recruited to prevent
further occurrence of the anti-Sem
itic feeling that Hitler planted in
Europe.
