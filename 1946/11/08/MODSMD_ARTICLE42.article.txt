# Barclay Lashes at Resignation Ideas; Says Parliamentary Rule Not for U.S.
## 
### 
Professor Thomas S. Barclay, Pro
fessor of Political Science at Stan
ford, very definitely does not favor
the recent suggestion put forth that
President Truman retire after ap
pointing a Republican Secretary of
State to succeed to the presidency.
There could be no doubt of that af
ter an interview with him last night.
Asked to comment upon the pro
posal, Professor Barclay permitted
this direct quotation: "The sugges
tion is grotesque. Our national poli
tics under a parliamentary regime
would be more disorganized and
disintegrated than they now are.
Only (he innocent or the ignorant
would be wi'ling to exchange presi
dential government for an even
more uncertain form. Presidential
government has many faults, but it

is better adapted to the United
States than a parliamentary system
could be."
Regarding the outcome of the
recent election. Professor Barclay
stated that it illustrates clearly
the pendulum theory of political
action in which the American
electorate shifts hack and forth at
intervals, although keeping well
within the constitutional patterns
and practices of our government.
"A President who exercises strong
leadership is charged with being a
dictator," declared the professor,
"and one who lets Congress go its
own blundering way is charged with
being ineffective. Many people seem
to want both types at the same
time."
Of further significance in the elcc

tion, Professor Barclay pointed out,
was its demonstration of the Ameri
can practice of voting against some
one or something, rather than for a !
specific program of action by re- j
sponsible leadership.
"In California," he said, "(he
situation is complicated by the pe
culiar double-filing system and by '
a phony non-partisanship which
violates every principle of party
government."
Yes, the professor is a Democrat, j
In addition to his work at Stanford
he has been a presidential elector, j
a delegate to two national conven
tions, and a member of parly com- i
mittees for the past 15 years.—Dun- !

Texas; Senator Arthur 11. Vandenberg of Michigan, recently mentioned as successor to Truman in a pro
posed presidential resignation (see page 1. column 1); and Mr. Molotov. Man at extreme right, unidentified.
Professor Thomas S. Barclay, Pro
fessor of Political Science at Stan
ford, very definitely does not favor
the recent suggestion put forth that
President Truman retire after ap
pointing a Republican Secretary of
State to succeed to the presidency.
There could be no doubt of that af
ter an interview with him last night.
Asked to comment upon the pro
posal, Professor Barclay permitted
this direct quotation: "The sugges
tion is grotesque. Our national poli
tics under a parliamentary regime
would be more disorganized and
disintegrated than they now are.
Only (he innocent or the ignorant
would be wi'ling to exchange presi
dential government for an even
more uncertain form. Presidential
government has many faults, but it

is better adapted to the United
States than a parliamentary system
could be."
Regarding the outcome of the
recent election. Professor Barclay
stated that it illustrates clearly
the pendulum theory of political
action in which the American
electorate shifts hack and forth at
intervals, although keeping well
within the constitutional patterns
and practices of our government.
"A President who exercises strong
leadership is charged with being a
dictator," declared the professor,
"and one who lets Congress go its
own blundering way is charged with
being ineffective. Many people seem
to want both types at the same
time."
Of further significance in the elcc

tion, Professor Barclay pointed out,
was its demonstration of the Ameri
can practice of voting against some
one or something, rather than for a !
specific program of action by re- j
sponsible leadership.
"In California," he said, "(he
situation is complicated by the pe
culiar double-filing system and by '
a phony non-partisanship which
violates every principle of party
government."

In addition to his work at Stanford

tions, and a member of parly com- i
