# Hale Creates Vigorous 'Macbeth' Despite Poor Student Cast and Adolescent Audience
## 
### GEORGE MOORE 
Returning to the Stanford boards
after an understandable absence,
the genius of Shakespeare as rep
resented by "Macbeth" proved to be
a near-intolerable burden to the
pair of top-flight professional ac
tors to whom must go the greater
share of credit for any praise be
stowed.
As the tragic schemer, Richard
Hale not only had to overcome the
vast quantity of poor reading in
dulged in by a student supporting
cast, but also the completely un
necessary obstacle of an audience
which was partially adolescent in
fact and disgracefully so in re
sponse. Nevertheless, Hale created
a Macbeth of vigor and fire. His
remarkable voice was employed to
full advantage in projecting the
great poetry of the lines while n'jv
er obscuring their dramatic values.
As Lady Macbeth, Margaret Wy
cherlv exhibited .1 madne&s fiisci

nating to behold and appalling to
contemplate. Save for an occasion
ally jumped cue, her magnificent
stature as a tragic actress was
wholly equal to the shouldering of
the aforementioned burden.
Fortunately, there were excep
tions to the mangling of the minor
roles. During his brief life on the
stage, the Duncan of William Mel
ton typified regal dignity and gra
cious pomp. Mel Ellet as Banquo
was consistently accurate both in
characterization and reading. How
ever. the most impressive student
performance was given by John
Menzel as the drunken porter as he
plied th'? audience delightfully with
his near-infallible sense of the wit
of the part. To Director F. Cowles
Strickland must go great credit for
blending Hale and Miss Wycherly
with the residual student cast.
The play continues tonight and
tomorrow night at 8:15.
