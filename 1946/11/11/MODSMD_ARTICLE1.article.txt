# Ballots Burned Before Recount
## 
### 
While student politicians awaited
the outcome of the ballot recount
for the position of graduate mem
ber on Exeom, A.S.S.U. President
Martin Anderson and Election
Board Chairman Bob Ayres offi
cially announced that the ballots,
left in the Nitery last Wednesday
night, had been burned by the Un
ion janitor.
Results of the Excom-contested
election had given Roberta Mace a
100 - voto preferential advantage
over Boris Wolper for the graduate
position.
RECOUNT PENDING
Miss Mace's victory was acknowl
edged by Excom "pending a re
count." Stan Shpetner, recently
elected to Men's Council, asked for
the recount at the last Excom meet
ing on the grounds that "the count
ing was very fouled up and differed
greatly on several separate counts."
Ayres had delegated Tom Win
ters, Election Board member, to
"watch the ballots" while Ayres
made his election report to Excom.
Winters left the Nitery while Tom
Elke, also on Election Board, was
checking reports there. Elke later
gathered up the ballots, locked the
Nitery door, and left.
DOOR LOCKED
Ayres, returning from Excom
with instructions for a recount, tried
the Nitery door, found it locked,
and went home.
When he returned to the Nitery
at 8:30 Thursday morning, Ayres
was unable to find the ballots for
the recount. He contacted the Un
ion janitor, who reported he had
swept up the room earlier and at
length he admitted he had burned
the ballots there.
SPECIAL MEETING
Election Board, in a special meet
ing yesterday afternoon, outlined a
draft plan for proposed changes in
A.S.S.U. elections which will be
submitted to Excom Wednesday by
H. D. Thoreau and Carl Burke.
The plan asks for an increase in
the time period between nomina
tions and election, and a change in
electioneering provisions and the
preferential system of voting.
All plans for the recount were
burned up with the disputed bal
lots, and final decision on election
results rests with Excom at its
meeting Wednesday.
