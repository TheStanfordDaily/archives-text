# Hawaii Invites Debate Team
## 
### 
An invitation has been received
by the Stanford Debating Team
from the University of Hawaii, ac
cording to Leland T. Chaplin, Farm
coach.
Topic for debate will be the de
sirability of Hawaiian statehood.
The island university wants Stan
ford to take the negative side of the
question, but final arrangements
will probably have one man from
each school on the affirmative, one
on the negative.
The entire debate squad meets
at 5 p.m. tomorrow in room 200-S
to discuss the island trip as well
as plans for the Western Associa
tion tourney, Nov, 25, 2(i, 27 and
the Pacific Forensic League tour
nament at the beginning of April.
' We have had a large number of
invitations for forensic activities and
while we have sufficient personnel,
we are limited by our budget," Mr.
Chapin said.
Farm teams for the Western Asso
ciation contest, in which .'5O coast
colleges are expected to clash, have
not yet been selected. Dow Carpen
ter, Eric Johnson, Bob Bennelt and
Malcolm Barrett are among the
likely choices for varsity positions
