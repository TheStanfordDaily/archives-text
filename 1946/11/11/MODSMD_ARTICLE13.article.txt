### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 (UP).—
I With future price controls now
j squarely in the lap of the consumer,
{ informed sources predicted tonight
| that additional war-time curbs will
j be abandoned.
President Truman plainly passed
the price ball to ihe people in his
night. He reportedly was convinced
that the election results reflected a
mass desire to be rid of government
I restrictions.
On the heels of his decontrol of
j all prices except those on rents, su
j gar and rice, these developments
j were in prospect:
1. Early increases in rent ceil
ings, though not on an across
the-board basis.
2. Abolition of the Civilian Pro
duction Administration's low-cost
clothing program.
:>. .funking of limitations on
| men's suits—opening the way to
j return of two - pants suits and
| vests.
4. Removal of a 30-day restric
tion on charge accounts, and pos
sible relaxation on installment
buying restrictions.
5. Repeal of controls on tex
tile production.
(!. Abolition of CPA priority
controls on installation of tele
phones.
