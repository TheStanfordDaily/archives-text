WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 (UP).
â€”General Dwight I). Eisenhower,
Chief of Staff, is planning to re
tire '"just as soon as he can do so
gracefully," Army Times, a week
ly unofficial service publication,
said today.
It quoted military sources as
saying that Eisenhower is "irri
tated by the apparent lack of a
clear-cut White House policy to
ward the Army, particularly in
connection with fiscal matters.''
The publication said that Gen.
Omar N. Bradley, Veterans Ad
ministrator, was the man most of
ten mentioned as Eisenhower's
successor. It said, however, that
"any talk that Eisenhower has
picked Bradley to succeed him as
Chief of StalT is erroneous as well
as premature."
The paper said sonic reports bad
Eisenhower as the next U.S. am
bassador to Great Britain "where
he enjoys a popularity almost
equal to that be holds in the Uni
ted States."
"Another group," the Publica
tion said, "says Eisenhower will
Ko into private industry and one
report even has him being con
sidered for the Democratic presi
dential nomination in 1!)4X."
