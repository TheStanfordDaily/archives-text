# Armistice Day to Be Observed Quietly Here
## 
### 
Armistice Day will be commem
orated quietly at Stanford today,
says John M. Stalnakcr, Dean of
Students, because the day com
memorating the ending of the
second World War has become
more important. However, a
wreath will he placed in the Me
morial Theater, which was con
structed in honor of those men
who were killed in World War I.
