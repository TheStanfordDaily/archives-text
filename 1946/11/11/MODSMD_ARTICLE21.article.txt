# Film Depicts Nomad Life
## 
### 
"Grass," a documentary film re
cording the migration of a nomad
tribe in Persia, will be shown to
morrow night at 7:30 on the Tues
day Evening Series program in Me
morial Hall. The program is free of
charge and open to the public.
A silent film, "Grass" follows the
migration of the nomadic Baktyari
tribes across central Persia as they
search for the grazing land which
means the difference between life
and starvation for their flocks.
The spectacle of 50,000 people
floating and swimming their flocks
across a treacherous river and
toiling over a 12,000-foot mountain
range has made the film one of the
epics of the struggle for existence
in pastoral life.
"Grass" was filmed and produced
by Mei ian Cooper, Ernest Schoed
sack, and Marguerite Harrison, the
first foreigners to travel through the
territory of the Baktyari migration,
an area extending approximately
350 miles from the lowlands of the
Persian Gulf to the high mountain
valleys fringing the central Persian
plateau.
