## The 						Freedom to Think (Part II) 
### 
We took the stand last week that education
as it is served up by Stanford and most other
schools and universities in this country is
largely a hit-or-miss proposition. We stated
our belief that Stanford should adopt a plan
similar to Harvard's whereby each student by
required courses is exposed to those methods
of thought which will make students better
able to cope with the problems of our civiliza
tion.
From here, we wish to justify our insist
ence that this is an important matter. The
Jap?., c "O and Germans, to mold a strong unit
of citizens, foisted on millions of human be
ings an unnatural, national ideal. For effici
ency and effective action, these civilizations
are unmatched in modern history. But to pin
down the United States' ideal to a workable
formula, as it is manifested in most universi
ties, would be difficult.
What the American ideal is and should be
is liberty and justice for all." By its very na
ture it is an international rather than national
ideal. It is an ideal which demands govern
ment restrictions to guarantee liberty to all,
and places on the individual, rather than some
institution outside the individual, the final re
sponsibility for seeing that neither he nor his
government abuse his liberty.
It is only through the recognition of this

ideal that our government can come any
where near matching the efficiency of the
totalitarian governments of Japan and Ger
many.
This ideal of personal responsibility, alone
fitting to human dignity, must be taught and
reinforced by the schools of this country.
Education alone obliterates intolerance. Each
person attending Stanford must be liberated
from false conceptions through being exposed
to all beliefs that are provably or tentatively
valid, and prepared to consider all problems
with all those methods of thought which are
relevant. To say that a student of science is
prepared to handle adequately complex so
cial problems is as asinine as to say that a
student who refutes science completely is a
well-rounded, free-thinking person.
If our democratic government is to work
efficiently, its citizens must be prepared to
live up to its ideal of liberty through individ
ual responsibility. And no person is prepared
who has not learned to think above and be
yond his own interests, who has not received
at least an introduction to all valid methods of
thinking.
We ask again that Stanford adopt a plan
of education which will provide these things
to each student through a system of required
studies.

person attending Stanford must be liberated
from false conceptions through being exposed
to all beliefs that are provably or tentatively
valid, and prepared to consider all problems
with all those methods of thought which are
relevant. To say that a student of science is
prepared to handle adequately complex so
cial problems is as asinine as to say that a
student who refutes science completely is a
well-rounded, free-thinking person.
If our democratic government is to work
efficiently, its citizens must be prepared to
live up to its ideal of liberty through individ
ual responsibility. And no person is prepared
who has not learned to think above and be
yond his own interests, who has not received
at least an introduction to all valid methods of
thinking.
We ask again that Stanford adopt a plan
of education which will provide these things
to each student through a system of required
studies.
We took the stand last week that education
as it is served up by Stanford and most other
schools and universities in this country is
largely a hit-or-miss proposition. We stated
our belief that Stanford should adopt a plan
similar to Harvard's whereby each student by
required courses is exposed to those methods
of thought which will make students better
able to cope with the problems of our civiliza
tion.
From here, we wish to justify our insist
ence that this is an important matter. The
Jap?., c "O and Germans, to mold a strong unit
of citizens, foisted on millions of human be
ings an unnatural, national ideal. For effici
ency and effective action, these civilizations
are unmatched in modern history. But to pin
down the United States' ideal to a workable
formula, as it is manifested in most universi
ties, would be difficult.
What the American ideal is and should be
is liberty and justice for all." By its very na
ture it is an international rather than national
ideal. It is an ideal which demands govern
ment restrictions to guarantee liberty to all,
and places on the individual, rather than some
institution outside the individual, the final re
sponsibility for seeing that neither he nor his
government abuse his liberty.
It is only through the recognition of this

ideal that our government can come any
where near matching the efficiency of the
totalitarian governments of Japan and Ger
many.
This ideal of personal responsibility, alone
fitting to human dignity, must be taught and
reinforced by the schools of this country.
Education alone obliterates intolerance. Each
person attending Stanford must be liberated
from false conceptions through being exposed
to all beliefs that are provably or tentatively
valid, and prepared to consider all problems
with all those methods of thought which are
relevant. To say that a student of science is
prepared to handle adequately complex so
cial problems is as asinine as to say that a
student who refutes science completely is a
well-rounded, free-thinking person.
If our democratic government is to work
