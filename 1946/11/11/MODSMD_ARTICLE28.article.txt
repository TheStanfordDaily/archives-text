about the matter constructively.

For instance, list the changes made in recent years
in administration, in departmental heads, in faculty,

see that from these individual moves an over-all
plan for Stanford's tomorrow is gradually emerging.
Therefore, be impatient about the slowness of the
plan, if you will, or about the failure to make clear
the relation of the individual changes to the whole
design, or criticize the plan itself, but it seems poor
gratitude indeed for hard-working men if we fail
to recognize that at least the men of the administra

they are headed.
Further, a fair analysis of the situation demands
that we recognize two additional facts: the many
and unique obstacles existing at Stanford to be over
come before any plan can succeed, and the difference
in viewpoint and in the conception of time by the
administration and by us as students.
One of the major obstacles is that so many ad
ministration and faculty are new to Stanford, and
besides having to learn the routine, they must at
the same time deal with a huge increase in enroll

Also, we as students are, you might say, "here

All this notwithstanding, we. do lack a clear-cut
statement from the I'niversity of their objectives
and of the plan for achieving them. Having that,
even if they were not completed in our day, we
could at least feel that progress was being made,

To the Editor:
1 read Friday's editorial with great interest; it was
a thoughtful presentation of a most important prob
lem. The general premise is that, our present edu
cational system is not adequately geared to the needs
of our complex modern society. Everyone will ad
mit this fact; the difficulty lies in changing it.
Certain doubts are raised in my mind as to the
proposed solution. The basis of the Chicago-Harvard
plan is that an integrated and more or less rigid
program of study be required of each student. The
professional thinkers and scientists (professors) give
the student what he needs to know, the essentials of
a liberal education. These specialists have accumu
lated the required information; the task of the stu
dent is to assimilate it.
I cannot help wondering if that is really the way
that students develop habits of critical thought. The
clue to the matter is provided in this statement from
Friday's editorial: "Students must be given an indoc
trination to the culture, the metho- of thinking which
has brought about . . . democratic principles domi
nant in the United States." Can you indoctrinate
culture and the method of thinking? Is not the best
preparation for thinking, thinking itself, rather than
memorizing the conclusions of some scholar?
I do not think that the wording of the above quo
tation is accidental, although most proponents of the
plan, sensitive to possible attack, would avoid these
phrases. It appears to me that the underlying philos
ophy of the Harvard-Chicago plan is essentially au
thoritarian in attempting to impose knowledge from
above, instead of developing a critical attitude and
habits of thinking from below. No one can deny the
importance of facts as tools; without them accurate
thought is impossible. But it is important to re
member that they are just tools.
Many students have discovered the difficulties of
pursuing lines of individual interest—music, poli
tics. scientific tinkering, or just doing some outside
reading for a provocative course—and still main
taining an adequate academic standing. Stiff compe
tition and the high standards of graduate and pro
fessional schools already intensify the problem.
Would not imposing a rigid curriculum make things
still worse? '
This is not to be construed as denying the value
ol these educational experiments, and I am sure
that there is much to be learned from them. I have
written this letter only because I am somewhat
alarmed to se° many intelligent people accepting the
principle of the Harvard-Chicago plan without real
izing its fundamental character.
I do not know precisely how our educational
system should be reformed. It is difficult to separate
this from our other social problems. It seems likely
that we v/ill have to start on the elementary level,
in the child's more formative years, and attempt to
treat the system as an integrated whole. Unfortu
nately, I am not qualified to formulate a positive and
comprehensive program, but I do believe that since
thinking is an individual process, men educated to
meet the complexities of modern life cannot be
turned out on an assembly line.

To the Editor:
1 read Friday's editorial with great interest; it was
a thoughtful presentation of a most important prob
lem. The general premise is that, our present edu
cational system is not adequately geared to the needs
of our complex modern society. Everyone will ad
mit this fact; the difficulty lies in changing it.
Certain doubts are raised in my mind as to the
proposed solution. The basis of the Chicago-Harvard
plan is that an integrated and more or less rigid
program of study be required of each student. The
professional thinkers and scientists (professors) give
the student what he needs to know, the essentials of
a liberal education. These specialists have accumu
lated the required information; the task of the stu
dent is to assimilate it.
I cannot help wondering if that is really the way
that students develop habits of critical thought. The
clue to the matter is provided in this statement from
Friday's editorial: "Students must be given an indoc
trination to the culture, the metho- of thinking which
has brought about . . . democratic principles domi
nant in the United States." Can you indoctrinate
culture and the method of thinking? Is not the best
preparation for thinking, thinking itself, rather than
memorizing the conclusions of some scholar?
I do not think that the wording of the above quo
tation is accidental, although most proponents of the
plan, sensitive to possible attack, would avoid these
phrases. It appears to me that the underlying philos
ophy of the Harvard-Chicago plan is essentially au
thoritarian in attempting to impose knowledge from
above, instead of developing a critical attitude and
habits of thinking from below. No one can deny the
importance of facts as tools; without them accurate
thought is impossible. But it is important to re
member that they are just tools.
Many students have discovered the difficulties of
pursuing lines of individual interest—music, poli
tics. scientific tinkering, or just doing some outside
reading for a provocative course—and still main
taining an adequate academic standing. Stiff compe
tition and the high standards of graduate and pro
fessional schools already intensify the problem.
Would not imposing a rigid curriculum make things
still worse? '
This is not to be construed as denying the value
ol these educational experiments, and I am sure
that there is much to be learned from them. I have
written this letter only because I am somewhat
alarmed to se° many intelligent people accepting the
principle of the Harvard-Chicago plan without real
izing its fundamental character.
I do not know precisely how our educational
system should be reformed. It is difficult to separate
this from our other social problems. It seems likely
that we v/ill have to start on the elementary level,
in the child's more formative years, and attempt to
treat the system as an integrated whole. Unfortu
nately, I am not qualified to formulate a positive and
comprehensive program, but I do believe that since
thinking is an individual process, men educated to
meet the complexities of modern life cannot be
turned out on an assembly line.

To the Editor:
Y;>ur editorial "The Freedom to Think" has raised

;i ii k displays excellent thought, there are other
fact: which in all fairness must be added if we are
to si-.- the picture as a whole and be able to think
about the matter constructively.
First, a careful distinction should be drawn be
tween the situation of having no progressive plans
for education and that of having a plan, but launch
ing it whhout benefit of trumpet blasts and rolling
di urns.
Not 100 long ago 1 would have agreed that Stun

no though! for tomorrow. Then, work on a com
mittee took me into most of the administrative and
(iepartiueuts'.l offices, so that gradually the pieces
hegan tit tit together until I saw a long-range and
exlrin.ely progressive program emerging at Stan
ford.
For instance, list the changes made in recent years
in administration, in departmental heads, in faculty,
in curricula, and, it seems to me, you cannot fail to
see that from these individual moves an over-all
plan for Stanford's tomorrow is gradually emerging.
Therefore, be impatient about the slowness of the
plan, if you will, or about the failure to make clear
the relation of the individual changes to the whole
design, or criticize the plan itself, but it seems poor
gratitude indeed for hard-working men if we fail
to recognize that at least the men of the administra
tion are concerned, are working, and do know where
they are headed.
Further, a fair analysis of the situation demands
that we recognize two additional facts: the many
and unique obstacles existing at Stanford to be over
come before any plan can succeed, and the difference
in viewpoint and in the conception of time by the
administration and by us as students.
One of the major obstacles is that so many ad
ministration and faculty are new to Stanford, and
besides having to learn the routine, they must at
the same time deal with a huge increase in enroll
ment and its accompanying problems. Also it must
he recognized that all at Stanford are not of the
• pinion that a drastic change is what is needed.
Also, we as students are, you might say, "here
today and gone tomorrow." and we are necessarily
more concerned with changes now, this quarter. Yet
those planning Stanford's future, will be here tomor
row and must do what they feel will in the long run
tyuild the best possible university—and major
ehrngos. if they are to last, cannot be made rashly.
All this notwithstanding, we. do lack a clear-cut
statement from the I'niversity of their objectives
and of the plan for achieving them. Having that,
even if they were not completed in our day, we
could at least feel that progress was being made,
and when these individual changes were mode we
would see how they fitted into a comprehensive
whole. Then, no longer in the dark, we could bet

To the Editor:
1 read Friday's editorial with great interest; it was
a thoughtful presentation of a most important prob
lem. The general premise is that, our present edu
cational system is not adequately geared to the needs
of our complex modern society. Everyone will ad
mit this fact; the difficulty lies in changing it.
Certain doubts are raised in my mind as to the
proposed solution. The basis of the Chicago-Harvard
plan is that an integrated and more or less rigid
program of study be required of each student. The
professional thinkers and scientists (professors) give
the student what he needs to know, the essentials of
a liberal education. These specialists have accumu
lated the required information; the task of the stu
dent is to assimilate it.
I cannot help wondering if that is really the way
that students develop habits of critical thought. The
clue to the matter is provided in this statement from
