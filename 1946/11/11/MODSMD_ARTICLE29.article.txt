An Open Lett -r to Excom:
Nice goint-, Excom! Resembling the weak sisters
11 nit you are, and appeasing a situation that called for
a definite stand, you really performed like trained
seals.
The S.A.C. could not sway the Excom of 1943 over
this issue, so the S.A.C. simply shelves the problem
. nd waits a few years. Then three years later when
the majority of the members of Excom don't have
any conception <>I the real issue, it is very easy for
the S.A.C. to paint a picture of injustice and illegal
procedure 011 the part of this 1943 Excom. So you
feel that you must make amends by appeasing the
S.A.C. and leaving the award only half an award.
You don't seem to mind injustice and illegal pro
cedure wh«n it is in accord with the S.A.C.'s wishes.
Last winter during rutfby season this sport was re
moved from a major sport status to that of a minor
sport. You say now that such a move cannot be put
into effect until the year following the passage of
th" legislation, but in that case (he Excom went
ri ;ht ahead and awardod minor sport letters to the
1945 Rugby team which should have had the major
sport letters.
Please keep in mind that in 1043 the S.A.C. wrote

the authorizations for Block "S" awards, so that the
members of the team could draw these felt "S's"
from the Encina Gym Store. I feel sure that the 1943
Excom thought that the cards would be delivered to
the players as well, but the war emptied the school
and the old B.A.C. went out of existence without
taking any stand.
It all fits so perfectly. Why didn't the B.A.C. send
such a letter as was printed in last Tuesday's Daily,
when the issue was being decided back in 1943? I'll
tell you why. Because the letter would not have
been heeded; because the Excom of that time wanted
it mad'? known that the students could award appre
ciation in the way of a letter to deserving fellow
students without the dictatorial say-so of the S.A.C.
You seem to agree with the S.A.C.'s desire to
"protect the Block 'S' award." Then why is it
that you have permitted the men in question to con
tinue wearing the letter when you think they have
not earned it.
But never fear, if you feel that the award was
unjust and illegal, I will never w?ar the Block "S"
again. It will go into the closet alone; with all the
other skeletons of past S.A.C. and Exfom "just
decisions."

th" legislation, but in that case (he Excom went
ri ;ht ahead and awardod minor sport letters to the
1945 Rugby team which should have had the major
sport letters.
Please keep in mind that in 1043 the S.A.C. wrote

the authorizations for Block "S" awards, so that the
members of the team could draw these felt "S's"
from the Encina Gym Store. I feel sure that the 1943
Excom thought that the cards would be delivered to
the players as well, but the war emptied the school
and the old B.A.C. went out of existence without
taking any stand.
It all fits so perfectly. Why didn't the B.A.C. send
such a letter as was printed in last Tuesday's Daily,
when the issue was being decided back in 1943? I'll
tell you why. Because the letter would not have
been heeded; because the Excom of that time wanted
it mad'? known that the students could award appre
ciation in the way of a letter to deserving fellow
students without the dictatorial say-so of the S.A.C.
You seem to agree with the S.A.C.'s desire to
"protect the Block 'S' award." Then why is it
that you have permitted the men in question to con
tinue wearing the letter when you think they have
not earned it.
But never fear, if you feel that the award was
unjust and illegal, I will never w?ar the Block "S"
again. It will go into the closet alone; with all the
other skeletons of past S.A.C. and Exfom "just
decisions."

An Open Lett -r to Excom:
Nice goint-, Excom! Resembling the weak sisters
11 nit you are, and appeasing a situation that called for
a definite stand, you really performed like trained
seals.
The S.A.C. could not sway the Excom of 1943 over
this issue, so the S.A.C. simply shelves the problem
. nd waits a few years. Then three years later when
the majority of the members of Excom don't have
any conception <>I the real issue, it is very easy for
the S.A.C. to paint a picture of injustice and illegal
procedure 011 the part of this 1943 Excom. So you
feel that you must make amends by appeasing the
S.A.C. and leaving the award only half an award.
You don't seem to mind injustice and illegal pro
cedure wh«n it is in accord with the S.A.C.'s wishes.
Last winter during rutfby season this sport was re
moved from a major sport status to that of a minor
sport. You say now that such a move cannot be put
into effect until the year following the passage of
th" legislation, but in that case (he Excom went
ri ;ht ahead and awardod minor sport letters to the
1945 Rugby team which should have had the major
