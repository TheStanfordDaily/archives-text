Officials of the Cornell Univer
sity Medical College have an
nounced that Dr. Frederick H. Car
penter, who earned his master's and
doctor's degrees at Stanford, was
one of the five men credited with
th • discovery of a process of mak
ing synthetic penicillin.
Dr. Vincent du Vigneaud, spokes
man for the group at the New York
I Hospital—Cornell Medical Center,
! announced that this achievement,
which he and Carpenter and three
other biochemists had made, makes
possible entirely new types of peni
cillin. It "opens the way to the syn
thesis of a series of entihely
and different penicillins which
might be useful against diseases not
affected by present kinds of peni-
S cillin," Dr. du Vigneaud said.
Dr. Carpenter left Stanford to
work with Dr. du Vigneaud on ex-
I periments in the chemistry of nu
! cleic acids. While at Stanford Dr.
Carpenter received his bachelor's
degree in 1940, his master's in 1941,
and his doctor's in 1944, all in the
I field of biochemistry.
