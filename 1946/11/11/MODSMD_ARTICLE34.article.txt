The School of Medicine has re
cently undertaken a two-year con
tract for the Army Air Corps, Dr.
Victor E. Hall, Stanford professor of
physiology, said. The purpose of
the research is to study body tem
perature control. The problem to
be solved is "Why does the body
prefer RB.(> degrees F. to any other
temperature?"
Dr. Hall said that there will be
few results given on the project
during the next two months mainly
because of the difficulty in securing
special scientific equipment.
Associate director Is Dr. John
Field. The two directors have three
assistants: Dr. Ronald Grant from
McGill University, Montreal; Mr.
Basil Panzer, Dutch citizen from
Austria who previously taught at
U.C.L.A.; and Mrs. Tillie Goldsmith,
