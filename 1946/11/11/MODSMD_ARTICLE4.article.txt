No recount can be had on the
election for graduate Excom mem
ber now that ballots have been
burned. There is no recourse
now, for those persons disenfran
chised by the change in voting
time and place for Village stu
dents. And few would question
the decisions of Excom in acquit
ting students who had election
eered against the provisions of the
constitution.
However, there are explicit
clauses in the constitution which
establish what Excom should do
in such cases. If a recount is
asked, no election is final until
the recount is satisfactorily com
pleted. If the constitution says
polls will be open at certain times,
an election is strictly illegal for
polls are not open at those times.
And if it states that no candidate
shall electioneer, one who violates
that statement is automatically
disqualified.
But this editorial is not aimed
against past decisions of Excom.
It is to point out that Excom has
an alternative to its present atti
tude toward the constitution.
We think it fair to recommend
that Excom stop pointing at min
ute provisions of the constitution
to justify its actions on the one
hand and on the other hand to
set completely aside other of its
written provisions. We think a
definite stand on the powers of
the constitution would clear up
action and revive the fading pos
sibility that student government
can stand on its own feet.
