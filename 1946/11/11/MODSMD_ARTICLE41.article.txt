# Water Polo Team Wins Two More
## 
### 
Last week-end's pair of water polo ;
practice games proved to be just !
hat, practice, for the rampaging
Stanford Indian splashers as they
chalked up two easy wins in prepa
ration for their league encounter
with UCLA here next Saturday.
Thursday night the Card mermen i
raveled to San Jose where they i
.>ave the hapless Spartans a lesson J
n polo fundamentals, 15-7. The i
Olympic Club was the second vic
tim as the Indians swamped them,
3-2, in the local pool Saturday.
Everyone on the Stanford squad
had a hand in ihe San Jose rout with J
the scoring evenly divided among
the Indian stalwarts. After the first
string threatened to chase the Spar- I
tans right out of the pool, Card ;
coaches Tom Haynie and Ernie I
Brandsten mercifully jerked most
:>f the red-hot starting lineup and
substituted freely. Even then the j
brilliant forward line combination j
of Harry Borchers, Jim Armstrong,
ind Emmett Cashin managed to
pour in four points apiece to lead
(he attack.
Saturday the game turned out to
be quite a battle, but the Olympic
Club faltered in their vaunted of
fensive thrusts as they only scored \
.'wo buckets. Meanwhile the Indians J
were not doing too much more, yet j
their eight quick markers proved to j
lie more than enough to win. The |
shining star on the Stanford squad i
was Dick Narver who turned in his |
usual brilliant performance at his j
•hack position.
News from down South was all
good for the championship-bound j
mdians, as they have virtually j
•linched the league flag as a result j
of PCC games played over the week ;
i nd. The California Bears, who
; ,ave Stanford some uneasy moments j
before dropping a 7-6 decision, fal
tered before USC and dropped a
»0- 8 count which virtually elimi
nates them from the race. Even to
tie the Indians, the Bears would
'iave to win all of their remaining
»ames while Stanford dropped its
two.
Thus the Indians could grab the
PCC championship next Saturday
as they meet the lowly UCLA
Bruins, who have yet to win a I
conference game in three starts. One j
>112 these losses was pinned on the j
Bruins by Stanford in a 14-3 debacle ;
in which the Uclans looked very !
unorganized. Saturday's game will |
probably be much closer, but the I
"Indians should come through with j
ihe victory and the championship.

Saturday the game turned out to
be quite a battle, but the Olympic
Club faltered in their vaunted of
fensive thrusts as they only scored \
.'wo buckets. Meanwhile the Indians J
were not doing too much more, yet j
their eight quick markers proved to j
lie more than enough to win. The |
shining star on the Stanford squad i
was Dick Narver who turned in his |
usual brilliant performance at his j
•hack position.
News from down South was all
good for the championship-bound j
mdians, as they have virtually j
•linched the league flag as a result j
of PCC games played over the week ;
i nd. The California Bears, who
; ,ave Stanford some uneasy moments j
before dropping a 7-6 decision, fal
tered before USC and dropped a
»0- 8 count which virtually elimi
nates them from the race. Even to
tie the Indians, the Bears would
'iave to win all of their remaining
»ames while Stanford dropped its
two.
Thus the Indians could grab the
PCC championship next Saturday
as they meet the lowly UCLA
Bruins, who have yet to win a I
conference game in three starts. One j
>112 these losses was pinned on the j
Bruins by Stanford in a 14-3 debacle ;
in which the Uclans looked very !
unorganized. Saturday's game will |
probably be much closer, but the I
"Indians should come through with j
ihe victory and the championship.

Last week-end's pair of water polo ;
practice games proved to be just !
hat, practice, for the rampaging
Stanford Indian splashers as they
chalked up two easy wins in prepa
ration for their league encounter
with UCLA here next Saturday.
Thursday night the Card mermen i
raveled to San Jose where they i
.>ave the hapless Spartans a lesson J
n polo fundamentals, 15-7. The i
Olympic Club was the second vic
tim as the Indians swamped them,
3-2, in the local pool Saturday.
Everyone on the Stanford squad
had a hand in ihe San Jose rout with J
the scoring evenly divided among
the Indian stalwarts. After the first
string threatened to chase the Spar- I
tans right out of the pool, Card ;
coaches Tom Haynie and Ernie I
Brandsten mercifully jerked most
:>f the red-hot starting lineup and
substituted freely. Even then the j
brilliant forward line combination j
