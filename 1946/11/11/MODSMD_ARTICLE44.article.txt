Today we are going to talk of football players, particularly about
Stanford's men. And also a little bit about the team in general and about
the prospects in the remaining games. Not much»of an assignment, I'll
admit, but it'll fill the space.
In the "T" formation such as is utilized at the Farm, the quarterback
is the most important man on the team. On him depends whether or not
the outfit will go, also in which direction. Up to now there has been a
great deal of comment —all adverse—about the qbing of the Big Reds.
Cracks like "How dumb can they get?" "What's the matter with our quar
terbacking?" "Who do they think they are—Albert?" etc. and so on clutter
up the usually serene atmosphere of the Farm.
QUARTERBACKS?
This piece may well turn into a defense of the signal callers, but it is
not blindly so. Our quarterbacks are just guys like you and me, with a
certain amount of ability and physique, and they do the best they can
under the circumstances. It takes no great amount of courage or ability
to say to a crony that "if I couldn't call plays and pass better than that
I wouldn't be out for the team," because the odds are well weighted
against you that you couldn't and aren't.
The major part of the qbing this season has fallen on two kids who are
playing their first year of varsity ball at Stanford. They are Jack Brown
son and Aubrey Devine, Jr. Two other qb's have seen some action from
time to time. They are Frankie Forbes and Ainslie Bell. The latter will
not be back after this season, and for that reason alone —and none other—
we will confine our statements to the former pair.
BROWNSON I BOSH STAB
Brownson was a frosh star back in '42 before he went to war with the
Navy Air. While in the Navy he played some ball for the Norman (Okla.)
NAS Zoomers—the same team that Lloyd Merriman and Dick Flatland
were on—in 1944. So much for the past; it is the present and the future
we are interested in.
Brownson is a 173-pound 6-foot 22-year-old lad who has the gall of
a burglar and has been cussed out more (not to his face, I'll bet) than
any other member of the team. He is a fair passer and a good signal caller
and he loves to take chances. He has a particular penchant for calling
running plays on fourth down instead of punting—and because of that he
has been made responsible for blunders which to a large degree were not
his fault.-
The celebrated "fourth down fumble" in the U.S.C. game gave him
a measure of notoriety among the writing gentry. We can answer it—and
the other criticisms for doing the same things under similar conditions
upon other occasion—by stating that the opposition team cannot score
touchdowns when you have the ball.
With football being played the way it is today—a wide open high
scoring game—it makes little difference whether the opposition gets the
ball on your 20-yard line or on its own 20-yard line. Granted the odds
are more in favor of them scoring from your 20. but we haven't seen many
teams this year that couldn't overcome the intervening GO yards with im
punity if they had the men to do it.
So the object is to hold on to the ball and score-touchdowns yourself.
The days of Punt and Pray died in 1939 or thereabouts and scoreless ties
on a dry field are things of the past. Every play a coach and his staff
dreams up is potentially a "perfect play" and should go for a touchdown;
if every faking and blocking assignment were carried out perfectly, every
play would go to pay dirt. Football will never be quite like that—but it's
awfully close right now under the systems being used.
NOBODY PERFECT
Probably the biggest defect is the men playing the game. They aren't
perfect—merely good in greater or lesser degree, and because of that mis
cues occur. But what is a quarterback if he does not have an ultimate
faith in the ability of the men he is working with?
It is knowing that he has the men who can do what he asks of them in
a huddle that constitutes a great deal of the effectiveness of the quarter
back. In this respect Brownson is the best qb we have. This coupled to
his brassiness in refusing to follow timeworn grid trails and customs makes
him a very good quarterback. His passing has been something else though.
Up to now, Jack lias thrown a pass with his arm cocked back like a
man waving a cowbell on New Year's Eve. Ihe other day Marchie
Schwartz took him aside and told him to pluck the hall out of his car.
It makes for shorter passes but much better control of the ball. His
passing record should improve 50 per cent from now on in.
