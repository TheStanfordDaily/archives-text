The Cardinal foilsmen ran into
some tough Berkeley opponents at
the Men's Gym Friday night as the
Indian squad bowed to the invading
California Fencing Club 24 to 1 in
the last match of this season for
Coach Elwyn Bugge's team?
Saving the Indian team from a
complete rout was James Crooker's
only Cardinal win of the evening
as Fred Williams, Alfred Larson,
Phil Mitchell, and Dave Evenson
were unable to hold ground in any
of their five bouts against the ex
perienced U.C. graduate students of
the club.
