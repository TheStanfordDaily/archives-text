# Council's Social Duties Explained
## 
### DERRY KIMBALL 
VVoinen's Council originated when
Stiiiiford women first took the re
sponsibility for the government of
the yeomen on campus in 1911 in
the form of the Judicial Board of
Women's Conference.
Council was at first the executive
branch of Conference. The separa
tion of the two took place when
chairmanship of Council and the
presidency of Conference were
made into two separate offices. An
important step in their develop
ment was taken in 1920 when for
the first time Women's Council co
dified their rules, regulations, aims,
and ideals in a "Rule Book" which
was distributed to all the women.
PUNITIVE BODY
Women's Council has jurisdiction
over the violations of social regula
tions, the Fundamental Standard,
and the Honor Code. As well as
being a punitive body, the duty of
Council is to educate and advise the
women.
FEW EXPULSIONS
The powers of punishment range
from locking in to probation and
expulsion. Only when Council feels
there is no hope to bring the indi
vidual into conformity with the
standards of the University or in
eases where the individual is a det
rimental influence to other students
is expulsion recommended. An ex
pulsion case may be appealed only
to Dr. Tresidder.
To be qualified for membership
women must have a C average and
130 units. The candidates are nomi
nated by the nominating committee
or by petition. The five members
are elected by the women students
in the A.S.S.U. elections. Two mem
bers are elected winter quarter and
three sprint* quarter. Staggering the
terms in this way allows some ex
perienced members on each Coun
cil.
FIVE MEMBERS
The positions on Council are:
chairman, Carol Kellogg; vice-chair
man, Mary Ed Davie; secretary,
Gloria Cassidy; clerk, Jean Gait;
scholarship and supplies chairman,
Margaret Wade. Except for the
chairman who is elected by the
group, the members choose which
position they will fill.
Members for the Summer Coun
cil are appointed by the chairman
of the Council during spring quar
ter subject to the approval of Ex- ,
com and the President of the Uni
versity.
The Council has the power to
grant special late leaves. Most late
leave violations are handled by
sub-committees. Cases may be ap
pealed from the regular house com
mittee's to Women's Council.
CIVIL DISPUTES
Disputes of civil nature between
students may be handled by the ap
propriate Council or by both Men's
and Women's Councils jointly upon
written consent of both complain
ant and defendant to Council's ju
risdiction. The Council, however,
has no machinery for the enforce
ment of judgments#
Women's Council may censor
campus productions as to costum- j
ing and dialogue. Complaints of al- :
leged violations of the Fundamen
tal Standard, Honor Code, or other i
matters of conduct may be made to j
any member of Council.
CHARGE STATEMENT
If a charge is anything more se
rious than a late leave violation, the
.summons to the offender must con
tain a statement of charge. The
Council may use the testimony of
any individual in consideration of
a ease.
In contrast to Men's Council,
Women's Council has never had any
of its jurisdiction taken from it.
The office for Women's Council
has recently been changed to room
3 above the Nitery on the third
floor. The new phone number is ;
25754. The new office was the for
mer Debate Council room.

If a charge is anything more se
rious than a late leave violation, the
.summons to the offender must con
tain a statement of charge. The
Council may use the testimony of
any individual in consideration of
a ease.
In contrast to Men's Council,
Women's Council has never had any
of its jurisdiction taken from it.
The office for Women's Council
has recently been changed to room
3 above the Nitery on the third
floor. The new phone number is ;
25754. The new office was the for
mer Debate Council room.
VVoinen's Council originated when
Stiiiiford women first took the re
sponsibility for the government of
the yeomen on campus in 1911 in
the form of the Judicial Board of
Women's Conference.
Council was at first the executive
branch of Conference. The separa
tion of the two took place when
chairmanship of Council and the
presidency of Conference were
made into two separate offices. An
important step in their develop
ment was taken in 1920 when for
the first time Women's Council co
dified their rules, regulations, aims,
and ideals in a "Rule Book" which
was distributed to all the women.
PUNITIVE BODY
Women's Council has jurisdiction
over the violations of social regula
tions, the Fundamental Standard,
and the Honor Code. As well as
being a punitive body, the duty of
Council is to educate and advise the
women.
FEW EXPULSIONS
The powers of punishment range
from locking in to probation and
expulsion. Only when Council feels
there is no hope to bring the indi
vidual into conformity with the
standards of the University or in
eases where the individual is a det
rimental influence to other students
is expulsion recommended. An ex
pulsion case may be appealed only
to Dr. Tresidder.
To be qualified for membership
women must have a C average and
130 units. The candidates are nomi
nated by the nominating committee
or by petition. The five members
are elected by the women students
in the A.S.S.U. elections. Two mem
bers are elected winter quarter and
three sprint* quarter. Staggering the
terms in this way allows some ex
perienced members on each Coun
cil.
FIVE MEMBERS
The positions on Council are:
chairman, Carol Kellogg; vice-chair
man, Mary Ed Davie; secretary,
Gloria Cassidy; clerk, Jean Gait;
scholarship and supplies chairman,
Margaret Wade. Except for the
chairman who is elected by the
group, the members choose which
position they will fill.
Members for the Summer Coun
cil are appointed by the chairman
of the Council during spring quar
ter subject to the approval of Ex- ,
com and the President of the Uni
versity.
The Council has the power to
grant special late leaves. Most late
leave violations are handled by
sub-committees. Cases may be ap
pealed from the regular house com
mittee's to Women's Council.
CIVIL DISPUTES
Disputes of civil nature between
students may be handled by the ap
propriate Council or by both Men's
and Women's Councils jointly upon
written consent of both complain
ant and defendant to Council's ju
risdiction. The Council, however,
has no machinery for the enforce
ment of judgments#
Women's Council may censor
campus productions as to costum- j
ing and dialogue. Complaints of al- :
leged violations of the Fundamen
tal Standard, Honor Code, or other i
matters of conduct may be made to j
any member of Council.
