# Washington, Bad Breaks Beat Cards
## 
### GEORGE CAULFIELD 
Thre was little resemblance be
tween the Husky from Washington
and a docile 3-1 underdog Satur
day.
Playing as if they had just fin
ished reading their pre - season
write-ups, the fast-improving Uni
versity of Washington eleven gave
25,000 Stadium spectators their
quota of thrills and surprises and
coincidentally earned themselves a
2.1-15 victory over the Indians of
Stanford.
In a game highlighted by bril
liant pass plays and see-saw scor
ing. the Husky line proved the
winning margin. The same ar
rangement of brawn and brain
which held the California Rear
hackfield to a single yard gained
from scrimmage two weeks ago
bottled up previously active Red
skin ball carriers.
Of all the Stanford backs only
Lloyd Merriman was able to find a
hole in the Washington forward
wall. The Farm's candidate for All-
Coast honors was able to average
over five yards per carry and
showed little if any evidence of the
thigh injury which had threatened
to bench him.
The northerners were superior
in practically all departments and
earned their margin of victory.
Monday morning quarterbacks
however can point to the opening
play of the fourth quarter and ra
tionalize some sort of obscure vic
tory. Again the figure of Merri
man enters the picture.
In what many thought the best
run of the day, Stanford's Mr. Foot
| ball crashed .through the Husky left
: guard and scampered through mobs
of Coach Pest Welch's best "shag
: gy dogs" to carry the pigs] In 44
j yards and to a supposed touchdown.
But an eager Cardinal lineman had
anticipated the play and was called
j offside by an official, nullifying
, what would have been the tying
touchdown.
The scoring was nicely distrib
uted among the quarters. Wash
ington opened the touchdown pa
rade with a 72-yard drive in the
first period. Sam Robinson, full
back. culminated the drive with
a six-point thrust off tackle. The
conversion was good.
Stanford then hit the scoring col
umn in one of those freak plays.
; Washington lined up. Signals were
called. A snappy shift was neatly
executed. Then the ball was cen
l tered, apparently an unforeseen oc
j currence. The ball shot back to the
; Washington goal. Marshall Dallas
raced back to grab the ball for the
Huskies. As he leaped on the ball
Stanford linemen halted him from
participating in any further ofTcn
,sive action by pinning him to the
ground. Two points for the Big Red
Machine.
The next touchdown was the most
spectacular of the day. Tom Gos
selt. Husky end, snagged a long 26-
yard pass thrown his way by Fred
Provo. Already behind the Stan
lord safety men, he sped 35 yards
to paydirt. The conversion was
good.
Bob Anderson made a two-yard
touchdown thrust and the Stan
ford hand performed the usual
half - time festivities while the
scoreboard read IJ-S.
The Indians pulled ahead in the
third quarter. A Brownson-to-
Mcrriman pass clicked for six
points. Marty Feldman's conversion
gave Stanford a one-point lead.
Husky back Kiddle crashed over
from the Indian three and the
completed conversion ended tin
clay's scoring.
Washington outgained the Indians
on the ground and through the air,
.'>3o yards to 192. The first-down to
tals were 16 and 10.
Harvey Bernhard was the only
casualty and may he out of the
Wushinplon State pamc.

Thre was little resemblance be

and a docile 3-1 underdog Satur
day.
Playing as if they had just fin
ished reading their pre - season
write-ups, the fast-improving Uni
versity of Washington eleven gave
25,000 Stadium spectators their
quota of thrills and surprises and
coincidentally earned themselves a
2.1-15 victory over the Indians of
Stanford.
In a game highlighted by bril
liant pass plays and see-saw scor
ing. the Husky line proved the
winning margin. The same ar
rangement of brawn and brain
which held the California Rear
hackfield to a single yard gained
from scrimmage two weeks ago
bottled up previously active Red
skin ball carriers.
Of all the Stanford backs only
Lloyd Merriman was able to find a
hole in the Washington forward
wall. The Farm's candidate for All-
Coast honors was able to average
over five yards per carry and
showed little if any evidence of the
thigh injury which had threatened
to bench him.
The northerners were superior
in practically all departments and
earned their margin of victory.
Monday morning quarterbacks
however can point to the opening
play of the fourth quarter and ra
tionalize some sort of obscure vic
tory. Again the figure of Merri
man enters the picture.
In what many thought the best
run of the day, Stanford's Mr. Foot

j yards and to a supposed touchdown.
But an eager Cardinal lineman had
anticipated the play and was called
j offside by an official, nullifying
, what would have been the tying
touchdown.
The scoring was nicely distrib
uted among the quarters. Wash
ington opened the touchdown pa
rade with a 72-yard drive in the
first period. Sam Robinson, full
back. culminated the drive with
a six-point thrust off tackle. The
conversion was good.

raced back to grab the ball for the
Huskies. As he leaped on the ball
Stanford linemen halted him from
participating in any further ofTcn
,sive action by pinning him to the
ground. Two points for the Big Red
Machine.
The next touchdown was the most
spectacular of the day. Tom Gos
selt. Husky end, snagged a long 26-
yard pass thrown his way by Fred
Provo. Already behind the Stan
lord safety men, he sped 35 yards
to paydirt. The conversion was
