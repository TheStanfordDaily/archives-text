# Honor Code Battle Was Long And Bitter in Stanford History
## 
### JOHN AVERILL 
(Following is the lirst of four
installments of a story on the his
tory of the Honor Code, and how
this most prized of Stanford tra
ditions was achieved after a loot
hattle with administration and
facility members.
Tin view of the widespread in
difference to student government
and the Honor Code evident
among many of us today, we feel
that this story can serve two im
portant purposes: one of empha
sizing the importance of the Hon
or Code in our school and every
day lives, and the other of reiter
ating that the student control we
have is ours only so long as we
continue to show the respect and
ability to exercise the responsi
bilities vested in each of us.—

"l pledge myself neither to
give nor receive unpermitted
aid in any examination."
This statement is the sub
stance of the Honor Code, a
fundamental termed by many
as the most cherished of Stan
ford traditions — a tradition
whose history depicts a 30-year
struggle for a system of honor
able scholastic endeavor.
The fight for the adoption of
the Code can best be related by
describing that which raged for
student government. The two
struggles were concurrent.
For many years after the found
ing of the University in 1891, stu
dent government was non-existent.
All affairs were handled by ap
pointive faculty committees. The
administration, resisting the spo
radic student agitation, refused to
relax the grip on student affairs
and policy.
And through fear that the stu
dents could not properly govern
their own numbers, the faculty
dogmatically persisted in one
viewpoint: fhe more glamorous
side of student government was
what the students wished rclin

(fit is lied. At the first appearance
of prosaic reviews and unpleasant
disciplinary judgments, thc\ fell,
interest would vanish.
Nevertheless, the students, indi
vidually and at times collectively,
' continued to bombard the adminis
; tration and its councils for a share
in policy. The demands and re
quests were in vain. It was the stu
dents' determination that did more
! in forging a change of attitude
among the faculty. A feelim* that
5 possibly the students could and
: would take the responsibility was
developing.
From the outset, the Univer
sity's policy of proctoring exami
nations was resented. Those stu
dents and facU'.ty members who
felt the system an affront to stu
dent integrity proposed an honor
system in IJIO4. It failed in gain
ing acceptance for one reason:
there was honor but no system.
Lacking was a provision for stu
dent control. Roth factions agreed
thai only if the students ihem

i selves acted through their own
councils, could the concept he
made workable.
Bui surprisingly enough this in
; eiclent of 1904 didn't bring the cov
eted delegation of powers to the
student body. And so again came
another period of bitter stalemates.
! Demands, ultimatums, refusals, and
j condemnations blasted the campus
| as the one group eagerly sought and
the other as jealously guarded the
reins of student control. The proc
tor system v/as retained and as a
result student-faculty animosity as
sumed near-serious proportions.
Eight years passed, and the in
cessant battering was taking ef
fect. In I!M2 a wary faculty con
sented to a limited form of stu
dent government. But the quali
fying implication was evident to
all. The proffered morsel was
cautiously sniffed, verbal battles
rocked the slender supporting
strands, hut the expected vora
cious plunge for the prize just
didn't occur.
Then, fearing a withdrawal of the
offer, the women students voted ac
ceptance. Similar action by the men
soon followed, thus signaling that
, the experiment at long last would
begin.

Eight years passed, and the in
cessant battering was taking ef

sented to a limited form of stu
dent government. But the quali
fying implication was evident to
all. The proffered morsel was
cautiously sniffed, verbal battles
rocked the slender supporting
strands, hut the expected vora
cious plunge for the prize just
didn't occur.
Then, fearing a withdrawal of the
offer, the women students voted ac
ceptance. Similar action by the men
soon followed, thus signaling that
