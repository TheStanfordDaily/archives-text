"lie who wants to live must iilso fight. and he who does not want
to light in this world of eternal struggle does not deserve life." This
is the inscription that Adolf Hitler had placed on the University of
Sorhonne in Paris and which the students there resisted through the
underground and resistance movement during the war.
For these students who so earnestly desired to preserve their uni
versity life and who arc now without the means to do so—without
the hooks, the paper and pencils, and lahoratorv equipment—Stan
lord's Relief Drive is heing held this week.
