LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y.. Nov. 11
(UP). â€” Soviet Russia challenged
Great Britain today to give strife
torn Palestine independence or a
United Nations trusteeship.
Armistice Day at U.N. was
marked by one of the hottest hat
tics vet as Soviet Ambassador
N'kolai Novikov accused the Uni
ted States, (ireat Britain and
South Africa of delay, inconsist
ency and charter violations on
trusteeship.
Chief developments were:
1. Novikov in a speech of nearly
one hour to the trusteeship commit
tee said that Britain's failure to pro
pose a trusteeship for Palestine
raised the question of what reasons
the British might have for "avoid
ing" such action.
2. The Soviet ambassador ac
cused American Delegate John
Foster Dulles of "inconsistency"
in asking that the committee defer
debate on (he question of who are
"states directly concerned"' with
trusteeship agreements.
3. NovikofT described the Union
of South Africa's proposal to annex
Southwest Africa as a "flagrant
violation" of the U.N. Charter and
said Russia must reject the propo
sal.
4. The American delegation an
nounced that its "almost final deci
sion" on the Spanish issues was to
oppose strongly a diplomatic or eco
nomic break with the Franco gov
ernment because "it might be un
successful or lead to civil war."
5. The political and security com
mittee approved a resolution rec
ommending that the Security Coun
cil reconsider the rejected member
ship applications of Ireland, Por
tugal, Transjordan, Albania and
Mongolia.
