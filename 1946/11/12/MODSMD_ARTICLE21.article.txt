WASHINGTON, Nov. 11 (UP)
—President Truman offered a
two-year political truce to the
Republicans today and they ac
cepted it—with reservations.
The Chief Executive, recognizing
the "serious difficulties" which he
will have in dealing with the Re
publican - controlled Congress con
vening Jan. 3, declared:
"As President of the United States
I am guided by a simple formula:
to do in all cases, from day to day,
without regard to narrow political
considerations, what seems to me to
be best for the welfare of all our
people. Our search for that wel
fare must always be based upon a
progressive concept of government.
"I shall co-operate in every
proper manner with members of
the Congress, and my hope and
prayer is that this spirit of co
operation will he reciprocated."
Republican leaders welcomed th<>
offer but some said the party would
place its own interpretation on what
he meant by a "progressive con
cept" of government.
Republican National Chairman
Carroll Reecc, who directed last
Tuesday's CJ.O.P. election triumph,
predicted the country would ap
plaud Mr. Truman's promise to
"meet good will with good will"
during the two-year KOth Con
gress.
"Accepting it at full face value,"
he said, "I am confident the Presi-

i dent will find an abundance of good
will among the Republican leader
| ship and membership of Congress
The President's statement, his
first on the outcome of the elec
tion, made it plain that he has
no intention of resigning ;>s sug

I Answering a barrage of questions
; at a crowded, special news confer
i encc, Mr. Truman said he knew of
I no contemplated resignation by any

The Chief Executive and Republi
! can leaders agreed that a bi-parti-
I san approach to foreign policy must
be continued.
"it has been a national and not
a party program." Mr. Truman
! said. "It will continue to be a
national program in so far as the
Secretary of State and I are con
cerned. I firmly believe that our
Republican colleagues who have
worked intelligently and co-op
eratively with us in the past will
do so in the future."
