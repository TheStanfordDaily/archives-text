# DAILY EDITORIALS
## A 						Long-standing Battle 
### 
Front page space will be devoted to the
Honor Code throughout this week, in the be
lief that no more important news could be
printed in our Daily. We present John Aver
ili's history of the Honor Code, which can
serve more adequately than any admonitions
or preachings to illustrate the meaning of the
Code. It honors the integrity of every indi
vidual at Stanford while demanding respect
for the rights of others. It is a "system" which
put:' into practise the ideal of American gov
criii'ip. t a minimum of control to effect the
maximum in liberty.
To us at the Daily, watching the borderline
cases of honor in the classroom and study
hall.'?, th»' seeming lack of failh by professors

i
who set up their own rules for examinations, it
becomes something worth fighting for.
Unfortunately the battle presents itself ev
ery year—or as often as the persons who pre
scribe to the nledge show their lack of faith
in it. But as past history illustrates, the Daily
and student leaders are willing to repeat the
fight in the belief that the Honor Code is the ,
most important and all-pervading right pos
sessed by the student body.
If the Code can turn out only ten per cent j
of Stanford's students bred in its ideal, we i
would think the right was worth protecting, j
But the Code clearly implies that its worka- j
bility relies on the co-operation of every stu
dent and faculty member. You . . . and you
. . ; and you.
