# Responsibility of Privilege
## 
### 
How many women students know that they
arc members of the Stanford Women's Club?
1 low many know that the Women's Club runs
the Women's Clubhouse, use of which is ex
tended to all Stanford men and women, and
in addition, to many off-campus groups?
Out of every woman's tuition fee, one dol
lar goes to the Women's Club, making that
student a member automatically. The dollar
that is received by every woman is the main
source of income for the club and is used for
the upkeep of the clubhouse. For this low cost
women may use the clubhouse at any time as
individuals and for group functions if they
make reservations. Men are privileged to use
it under the same conditions.
Subscriptions for a proposed women's
building were started in 1908. The clubhouse
was built and furnished largely from small
sums of money donated by campus and other
women's organizations. The clubhouse is ad
ministered by a Board of Directors which in
cludes two faculty women members, Dean of
Women's representative, seven alumnae, Wo
men's Conference president or her represen

tative, and one representative from every liv- j
ing group area. It is therefore obvious that
women students and men (-because of their
privilege of using the building) have a respon- j
sibility for the upkeep of the clubhouse.
There is evidence however that students
are not upholding this responsibility. Coffee
cups and milk bottles are left around—maga
zines and newspapers are always out of place |
—furniture is not moved back to its proper
place. In short, individuals are careless and
are not making an effort to keep things clean.
Organized groups are much more co-opera- j
tive in cleaning up after their meetings or
parties but they are neglecting to make reser
vations. It is true that any group may use the
clubhouse, but because of the large number
of activities on campus and the inadequate
space to accommodate them, reservations are i
absolutely necessary.
The clubhouse does not have a staff of |
workers that can clean up after every meeting,
dance, tea or after individuals who eat th?ir
lunches there. Clean-up goes hand in hand
with the privilege of the hospitality of the club- ■
house.—N.B.
