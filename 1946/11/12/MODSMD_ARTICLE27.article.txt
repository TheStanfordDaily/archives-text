# BILL COUGHLIN
## BULL SESSION 
### 
In order to form a more perfect union, establish
justice, promote the general welfare, and keep
Coughlin from flunking out. Bull Session will honor
the pages ot the Daily with its absence for a period
of one week.
During this period, read the edits. (Coughlin

says they're the biggest laugh in the paper, any
how.)
And watch next Monday's Daily for a gala, four
star reopening of 8.5., same time, same station, with
a new, renovated, scholastieally sound Coughlin. He
should live so long!
