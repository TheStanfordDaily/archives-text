i'i:aci: or politics
Ii now appears that the French Communist party,
with about lit) per cent of the popular support, is the
lnr"c: ( single party in the new French legislature.
I'he present government is a Communist-Socialist-
MKP (Popular Hepuhlican Movement) coalition, and
the new government Will also h;tve to be a coalition.
The Communists made substantial gains, as I said,
and now arc claiming the right to designate the new
Premier,-but it must be noted that the smalit-r parties
ol the Center and Right also made gains. The So
i-i.ili-.ts and the MHP do not control a majority of
the legislature. Uut if the Communists insist on
heading the government, the other major parties may
look elsewhere--to the more conservative groups—
lor their majority. II the Communists will compro
mise at less than the premiership, the present coali
tion can continue. (The recent Chilean presidential
elections posed the same question. The new presi
dent ol Chile was elected only with Communist sup
port. but the comrades accepted three cabinet posts
of "medium" importance as their share.) The re
luctance of governments to entrust substantial pow
ers to those whose allegiance may be divided is nat
ural enough.
The situation in France is a mild example of a
trend apparent in several other places on the globe,
the development of extremist political groups which,
in power, have no compunctions about resorting to
force to put down their opponents. Obvious ex
amples are the Yugoslavian and Polish regimes, but
they are by no means alone.
In China, we see open warfare between Commu

nists and the Kuomintang. Neither represents a ma
jority, and the United States is apparently realizing
that neither side represents the moderate, popular,
democratic government that we would like to sup
port. There are rumors of resurgent Fascist think
ing in Italy, and more than rumors of strong popu
lar support for the Italian Communists. The Greek
government is undoubtedly reactionary and holding
down its Red opposition only by force. The Philip
pine government of Hoxas is conservative and per
haps unpopularly pro-U.S., and it is using force
against its agrarian Hukbalahap opponents.
President Truman's fervent appeal for peace,
made at Arlington yesterday, is one issue on which
he can unite the country. Yet the fact must be faced
that from war, death, and famine grow no moderate
faiths. And from the extremes of revolution and re
habilitation can, not must, but can come another
war. Our own Herbert Hoover graced the recent
Republican victory with a statement that our choice
of "the light" would serve as a good example to the
several nations veering in the other direction. In my
opinion, if we treat our international problems not
from the point of view of economic, political, or mili
tary advantage but from the point of view of long
term peace, then we will be a good example indeed.
The foregoing implies some criticism of the recent
American declaration demanding an uninspected
trusteeship over the Pacific islands that we took from
Japan. It can be pointed out that the alternative was
to retain them without anyone's a worse
precedent than at least formal submission to the
U.N., but not much worse than our "or else" ap
proach.

with about lit) per cent of the popular support, is the
lnr"c: ( single party in the new French legislature.
I'he present government is a Communist-Socialist-
MKP (Popular Hepuhlican Movement) coalition, and
the new government Will also h;tve to be a coalition.
The Communists made substantial gains, as I said,
and now arc claiming the right to designate the new
Premier,-but it must be noted that the smalit-r parties
ol the Center and Right also made gains. The So
i-i.ili-.ts and the MHP do not control a majority of
the legislature. Uut if the Communists insist on
heading the government, the other major parties may
look elsewhere--to the more conservative groups—
lor their majority. II the Communists will compro
mise at less than the premiership, the present coali
tion can continue. (The recent Chilean presidential
elections posed the same question. The new presi
dent ol Chile was elected only with Communist sup
port. but the comrades accepted three cabinet posts
of "medium" importance as their share.) The re
luctance of governments to entrust substantial pow
ers to those whose allegiance may be divided is nat
ural enough.
The situation in France is a mild example of a
trend apparent in several other places on the globe,
the development of extremist political groups which,
in power, have no compunctions about resorting to
force to put down their opponents. Obvious ex
amples are the Yugoslavian and Polish regimes, but
they are by no means alone.
In China, we see open warfare between Commu

nists and the Kuomintang. Neither represents a ma
jority, and the United States is apparently realizing
that neither side represents the moderate, popular,
democratic government that we would like to sup
port. There are rumors of resurgent Fascist think
ing in Italy, and more than rumors of strong popu
lar support for the Italian Communists. The Greek
government is undoubtedly reactionary and holding
down its Red opposition only by force. The Philip
pine government of Hoxas is conservative and per
haps unpopularly pro-U.S., and it is using force
against its agrarian Hukbalahap opponents.
President Truman's fervent appeal for peace,
made at Arlington yesterday, is one issue on which
he can unite the country. Yet the fact must be faced
that from war, death, and famine grow no moderate
faiths. And from the extremes of revolution and re
habilitation can, not must, but can come another
war. Our own Herbert Hoover graced the recent
Republican victory with a statement that our choice
of "the light" would serve as a good example to the
several nations veering in the other direction. In my
opinion, if we treat our international problems not
from the point of view of economic, political, or mili
tary advantage but from the point of view of long
term peace, then we will be a good example indeed.
The foregoing implies some criticism of the recent
American declaration demanding an uninspected
trusteeship over the Pacific islands that we took from
Japan. It can be pointed out that the alternative was
to retain them without anyone's a worse
precedent than at least formal submission to the
U.N., but not much worse than our "or else" ap
proach.
