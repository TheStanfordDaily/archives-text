# Women Favor New Election
## 
### 
Women's Conference yesterday
voted unanimously in favor of re
running the recent A.S.S.U. elec
tion, which was declared illegal. The
plan voted on was to repeat the en
tire election, and make clear that it
is not necessary to vote for every
person on the ballot, but only for
those whom the voter knows would
be best qualified for the position.
A discussion of the Housing
Com plan for representatives in
the freshman social program fol
lowed. The report was made on
last Sunday's sponsor meeting at
which a group felt that housing
should be the topic of discussion
for the first talk instead of tradi
tions, as had been originally sched
uled by Housing Com.
After lengthy discussion, Confer
ence voted to go ahead with this
meeting as planned, rather than pro
mote housing as a problem so early
in the year.
The suggestion was made that
Klahoya Club have an exchange
luncheon with Roble and Branner,
in order to provide a way for the
girls living off campus to get ac
quainted with those living in fresh
man halls.
Carol Kellogg, chairman of Wo
men's Council announced that the
council office has been moved to the
old Debate Council Room, above
the Nitery. The new telephone
number is 2-5754. An Honor Code
discussion will be held tonight at
7:15 p.m. in the Excom Room, to
which everyone is asked to come
and talk on the system.
