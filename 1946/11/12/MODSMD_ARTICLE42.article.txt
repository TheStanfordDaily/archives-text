# College Paper Features Local Car Hop's Letter
## 
### 
The University of Utah Chronicle
has used Mrs. Marcia Ann Hight's
letter to the Stanford student body
as the basis for an editorial. The
article stressed the fact that the
public eye is constantly on univer
sity students, and that one bad act
can blank out many worthy actions
of the school.
The editorial says: "Although
' University of Utah students do not
have the reputation that the school
mentioned in the letter does, it will
certainly drive home the point th;it
we must make a special effort to
conduct ourselves properly at all
i times. Let's make certain that our
paper never receives such a letter."
Mrs. Hight's letter was reprinted
with the editorial.
