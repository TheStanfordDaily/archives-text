IT WAS FOURTH AND 12â€”when Buck Brownson pulled one out of his bag of tricks
to produce a touchdown. The Huskies held on their own 14. and sent the Tribe reeling
back two more in the third quarter and this is where OB Brownson uncorked a short
screen pass to Lloyd Mcrriman. Mr. Football picked it up and proceeded to threadneedie

and Charlie Wakefield on Gordy Ilungar) to the jjoal line, where Fred Provo and Sam
Kobinson watched him romp across. (Photo courtesy of San Francisco Chronicle.)
