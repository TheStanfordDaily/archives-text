## 
### 
CHICAGO. Nov. 11 (UP).â€”The Western Conference's official ballot in
favor of annual participation in the Rose Bowl game was cast today, it
was learned authoritatively".
Northwestern was the last school to vote on the post-season issue and
was reported to have voted affirmatively. The final vote thus Was 7 to 2

in favor of Rose Bowl play. The
negative votes were cast by Illinois i
and Minnesota.
Professor Frank E. Richart of II- :
linois, chairman of the Big Nine's i
faculty committee, is expected to
make a formal announcement of j
the passage of the proposal within |
the next 48 hours.
The delay in announcing the
vote is to permit the dispatch of
an official letter by the Western
Conference lo the chairman of the
Pacific Coast Conference's faculty
committee outlining the action
taken.
Two weeks ago Commissioner i
Kenneth L. Wilson of the Western j
Conference revealed that when the !
formal vote was completed, the Big
Nine would request a meeting with
Coast Conference representatives to j
work out final details of the Bowl
agreement.
This request Ls expected to be
embodied in Richart's letter and it j
was held likely the conferences (
would make a joint official an- I
nouncement of their preliminary
action together with a date and site
of the faculty group meeting before
the end of the week.
The negotiations arc expected
to be accelerated now to permit
completion of details in time for
the Big Nine - Coast Conference
had made "no definite commit
ments" of acceptance. Others,
however, were doubtful the Big
Nine would have gone so far on
the proposition unless it' had ad
vance assurances (he Coast was
receptive to the agreement.
In the past, the Coast Conference I
led the movement to arrange the
annual "tie-up" with the Big Nine. I
Revelation of the Big Nine's for- I
mal vote on the Bowl issue and th"
probable early get-together with
the Coast representatives came at ,
a time Rose Bowl rumors were j
springing up throughout the na- j
t ion.
