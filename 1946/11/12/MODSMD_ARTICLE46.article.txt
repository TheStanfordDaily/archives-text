# 'Little Big Game' Next for Jayvees
## 
### 
Coach Ed Stamm gave his Jayvees
a rest yesterday, but they'll be back
to the practice field tonight to be
gin a two weeks' get-ready-for-
Cal campaign. There is no Jayvee
game scheduled next Saturday, but
Stamm is planning at least one
scrimmage before the Little Big
Game with the Cal Ramblers Nov.
23 at Berkeley.
The Indian Juniors are more than
just a little disappointed about that
14-14 tie with the Cal Aggies at
Davis Saturday. The Aggies took
j advantage of a couple of breaks and
! a strong wind to hold the Stanford
outfit. The tie keeps the Jayvees'
| season record at the .500 mark, with
two wins, two losses, and one tie.
The first Little Big Game since
1942 promises to be quite an affair.
The Cal boys may be slightly fa
vored on the basis of their" record
of 5 victories out of 7 games. The
Ramblers have racked up 156
points, while holding their seven
opponents to Oil points.
Earlier in the season the Ramblers
won a 20-14 victory over the Santa
Clara Junior Var ity team that
edged out the Card Juniors 14-13.
The Berkeley Juniors nosed out the
Cal Aggies, 21-14. Last Saturday
at Los Angeles the Ramblers drop
ped a l!)-7 contest to the SC Jayvees.
Coach Ed Stamm's Jayvees knocked
off this same Trojan squad, 9-7, Oct.
26.
But comparative scores mean lit
tle or nothing in a Little Big Game!
