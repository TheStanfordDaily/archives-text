## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Nov. 11 (UP).—Dick Hagen, University of Wash
ington end, is one oi' the finest wingmen in all collegiate football today,
in the opinion ol Marchie Schwartz, Stanford coach.
"This Ilagen is the greatest defensive end we've run up against all
vear," Schwartz told the Northern California football writers today.

"Prior to our game with Wash
ington Saturday we had heard
that Ilagen was very tough. So
all week, I warned our quarter
backs to call no running plays
around Hagen's end. And we
practice all week — not to run
those plays.
"And what happens? Our quar
terbacks call six plays around the
end where Ilagen is on defense.
And we never gained a yard in
the whole six tries!"
This Hagen, incidentally, is quite
a football player. He was the man
who practically tore the California
line to pieces when the Huskies
thumped the Bears up north. Twen
ty-two years old, he is playing his
third year of football at Washington.
He stands six feet one and tips the
scale at 195.
He probably will win one of the
Pacific Coast Conference all-star
berths, along with Burr Baldwin,
the U.C.L.A. great, who shines more
on the offensive side.
