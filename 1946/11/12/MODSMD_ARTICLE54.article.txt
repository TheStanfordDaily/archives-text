# Varsity Polishes Passing Game
## 
### 
Nursing the usual collection of
bumps, bruises, sprains and sore
muscles that show up after any foot
ball game, Stanford's Indians start
ed propping for Washington State's
Cougars—who invade Palo Alto
Saturday—and from the looks of
the first day's practice it appears
that a passing game is indicated.
The Tribe threw the ball all over
the field last night in their workout,
and it was mostly short stuff;
screens, hooks, flats, and spots, and
it looked good, despite the encroach
ing twilight.
Coach Marchie Schwartz was a
bit shorthanded on the practice field,
Assistant Coaches Phil Bengtson and
Ray Hammett being in Fresno to
see Hawaii upset the Bulldo»s, 7-2,
; while an all too obvious handfull
of players were not out.
Harve Bernhard, the Seattle boy
who captained the Redskins against
his hometowners last week, is cur
| rently getting about with the aid of
crutches, and is possibly being mea
! sured for a cast for his right knee—

the result of a strained "knee liga
ment.
Among the others who failed to
put in an appearance due to some
physical disability or other, (all of
more or less minor seriousness) were
(ulp) Lloyd Merriman, George
Quist, Mickey Titus. Pinkie Phlegei
and Pete August. All, with the ex
i ception of Bernhard a,re expected
!back out today.
