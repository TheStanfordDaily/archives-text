# Stanford Skiers Await Approaching Snow Treks
## 
### BUZZ LOBDELL 
"Here's to the trail and the mountain top and here's to the skier who
dares" —it won't be long before the ski lodges of Northern California re
sound and re-echo with this popular refrain sung by relaxing .Stanford
skiers rehashing the spills and thrills of a day's activity in the snow.
With the approaching wind-up of the football season and the dawn of

another ski season, Joe and Jane*
Indian will exchange their rooters' !
caps and pom-poms for ski boots ;
and first-aid kits, and weekend
treks to the snow will replace foot- :
ball trips as the order of the day.
LOOKING AT WEATHER
All skiers and would-be skiers
are scanning' the weather reports
and praying for an early snowfall
in the mountains, and the more
blase of the Stanford skiing circle
are already trying to figure the an
gles in order to avoid the "snow
bunnies" and so-called ''Sunday
skiers." It might be in order to take
;i brief whirl around the snow cir
cuit and find out where Stanford
will ski.
The spot where you will be most
likely to see your friends is the
Badger Pass Lodge in the Yosem
ite National Park. Long the main
hangout for Stanford ski enthusi
asts, Yosemite offers many runs of
varying dogrees of difficulty de
signed for all types of skiers and a
comfortable, roomy lounge espe
cially adaptable for that skier who
enjoys his skiing in front of a roar- i
ing fireplace while sipping a hot
buttered sarsaparilla.
PASS RESERVATIONS
An added incentive for making
Badger Pass your center of opera
tions is the announcement by the
Stanford Ski Club that it has ar
ranged for a standing weekend •
block of over a hundred reserva- ;
lions for its members. Members of 1
the club are also eligible for free
ski lessons and special discounts on
ski tow rates and ski equipment at
Badger Pass. As long as we are
beating the drum for Yosemite it
might be added that a new barge
tow has been installed which will
accommodate a thousand skiers an
hour. This will eliminate standing
in line to get on a tow.
DONNER LODGE
Another popular rendezvous for
Stanford skiers is the Donner Sum- i
mit area, located 40 miles this side
of Reno. Such names as Soda
Springs, Sugar Bowl, and Donner
Summit Lodge should bring back
pleasant memories of past snow ex
cursions to those who have skied in
this locale. The Donner Summit
area is well populated with ski
lodges and offers many runs rang
ing from the easily negotiated runs
at Soda Springs to the difficult,
tricky Mt. Disney grade located at
the back door of Sugar Bowl.
Weil, that about does it. Here's
to a bigger and better ski season and
we'll be seeing you on crutches
around Quad after that first trip.
