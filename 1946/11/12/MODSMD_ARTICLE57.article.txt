# Dr. Lee, Crist Debate A-Bomb
## 
### JOANNE O'BRIEN 
Another verbal battle on the
question of atomic control was held
last night at the Palo Alto Com
munity Forum weekly meeting as
Dr. Russell V. A. Lee and Frank L.
Christ presented opposing views on
the question.
Dr. Lee. prominent Palo Alto
physician. Stanford graduate and
faculty member, strongly urged
the acceptance of the Baruch Plan
for international control of the
bomb stating that we are faced
either with an atomic race for su
premacy or stringent preventative
measures that would prevent com
plete devastation.
"To say that there is any secret in
the atomic bomb is utter rubbish,"
Dr. Lee stated. "Any nation can de
velop such bombs and there are
many sources of uranium existing
all over the world."
The Baruch Plan would create an
Atomic Development Authority
composed of scientists and states
men from every country and be a
part of the United Nations. Through
' this Atomic Development Authority
complete control could be gained of
all atomic bombs and make further
development impossible.
First of all, the Authority would
confiscate all bombs now in exist
ence and keep them intact undei its
supervision. There would also be a
research commission provided to in
spect all countries and if any evi
dence were found that such illegal
production existed it would be
stopped immediately.
"We must bury our preconceiv
ed ideas of precious national sov
ereignty and selfishness. We must
give up the idea that 'now we've
got it. let's keep it.' "
Mr. Crist, attorney and Stanford
graduate, presented arguments
advocating control by this coun
try. and stated that to this date
nations are not culturally or po
litically ready to accept such a
plan.
"It would fall through just as
prohibition did during the 20's. We
couldn't stop bootlegging then and
we would not be able to stop the
manufacture of atomic bombs now."
For an example, he cited the fact
, that in Russia there are vast ex
panses of territory in which to hide
just such operations.
"I'll admit that it is a grand and
marvelous idea but as conditions
prevail I don't think it's going to
work."
"Until other nations let their
people think, until the people are
allowed to control their own gov
ernment's policy, there is no prac
tical hope for such an idea." he
said.
During the last war poisonous gas
was used, find yet it was not em
ployed in this war. There are other
more terrible weapons than the
atomic bomb—for instance, bacterial
warfare. If we are going to outlaw
one, why not them all, lie stated.
Mr. Russell Varian, Stanford phy
sicist, contributed to the discussion
following the main presentation and
stated, "There is no defense for the
atomic bomb that would be com
pletely effective as yet."
Dr. Eugene Staley, formerly of the
Stanford faculty, was moderator for

ployed in this war. There are other
more terrible weapons than the
atomic bomb—for instance, bacterial
warfare. If we are going to outlaw
one, why not them all, lie stated.
Mr. Russell Varian, Stanford phy
sicist, contributed to the discussion
following the main presentation and
stated, "There is no defense for the
atomic bomb that would be com
pletely effective as yet."
Dr. Eugene Staley, formerly of the
Stanford faculty, was moderator for
the meeting.
Another verbal battle on the
question of atomic control was held
last night at the Palo Alto Com
munity Forum weekly meeting as
Dr. Russell V. A. Lee and Frank L.
Christ presented opposing views on
the question.
Dr. Lee. prominent Palo Alto
physician. Stanford graduate and
faculty member, strongly urged
the acceptance of the Baruch Plan
for international control of the
bomb stating that we are faced
either with an atomic race for su
premacy or stringent preventative
measures that would prevent com
plete devastation.
"To say that there is any secret in
the atomic bomb is utter rubbish,"
Dr. Lee stated. "Any nation can de
velop such bombs and there are
many sources of uranium existing
all over the world."
The Baruch Plan would create an
Atomic Development Authority
composed of scientists and states
men from every country and be a
part of the United Nations. Through
' this Atomic Development Authority
complete control could be gained of
all atomic bombs and make further
development impossible.
First of all, the Authority would
confiscate all bombs now in exist
ence and keep them intact undei its
supervision. There would also be a
research commission provided to in
spect all countries and if any evi
dence were found that such illegal
production existed it would be
stopped immediately.
"We must bury our preconceiv
ed ideas of precious national sov
ereignty and selfishness. We must
give up the idea that 'now we've
got it. let's keep it.' "
Mr. Crist, attorney and Stanford
graduate, presented arguments
advocating control by this coun
try. and stated that to this date
nations are not culturally or po
litically ready to accept such a
plan.
"It would fall through just as
prohibition did during the 20's. We
couldn't stop bootlegging then and
we would not be able to stop the
manufacture of atomic bombs now."
For an example, he cited the fact
, that in Russia there are vast ex
panses of territory in which to hide
just such operations.
"I'll admit that it is a grand and
marvelous idea but as conditions
prevail I don't think it's going to
work."
"Until other nations let their
people think, until the people are
allowed to control their own gov
ernment's policy, there is no prac
tical hope for such an idea." he
said.
During the last war poisonous gas
was used, find yet it was not em
ployed in this war. There are other
more terrible weapons than the
atomic bomb—for instance, bacterial
warfare. If we are going to outlaw
