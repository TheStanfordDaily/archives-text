# Women's Conference Governs Activities of Women Students
## 
### DOT DISHON 
Originally organized as part of
I Women's Council, in 1920 Women's
Conference became the only legis
j lative and governing body for wo
i men.
The purpose of conference is to
further interests which are pe
jculiar to women students, and to
i co-ordinate graduate, off-campus,
! and undergraduate women. The or
| ganization makes all the laws con
j eerning women students, while Wo
men's Council enforces these laws.
Members of conference are its offi
cers, the presidents of all under
graduate living groups, the presi
dent of Klahoya, and a member
I elected by graduate students. House
presidents discuss the issues which
i have arisen at conference, and the
women in each living group have
! the opportunity of expressing their
; ideas and opinions which should be

, carried back to conference by the ,
j presidents.
PROBLEMS
The main problem confronting
1 the organization is that of reaching
: all women students, of arousing
their interests in student and cam
pus activities, and of seeing that
their views are carried back to the
student leaders who decide on poli
cies and programs.
There are several committees
which come under the jurisdiction
of conference, although they have
I separate meetings and are com
prised of different members. These
are:
Housing Committee — This group
! decides the policies concerning wo
men's housing and plans the method
in which these will be carried out.
It is composed of a chairman, ap
pointed by conference, and two rep
resentatives from each living group.
Social Regulations Committee—
Under the direction of the vice
president of conference, this group
considers the effectiveness of exist
ing social regulations and makes
recommendations for changes in the
| social regulations.
Vo-Com —This committee has the
responsibility of informing the wo
i men students of vocational oppor
tunities and is composed of a chair
j man, appointed by conference, and
seven to twelve members,
i Nominating Committee — The
| function of this group is to nomi
-1 natc candidates for those A.S.S.U.
