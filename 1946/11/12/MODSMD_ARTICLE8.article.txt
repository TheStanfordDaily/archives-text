# Merriman and Morgan Give Views on Code
## 
### 
The Honor Code as a tradition
of Stanford might be compared to
the sportsmanship tradition of its
athletic teams. Hard blocking and
tackling have never been discou
raged on our footl»all teams; how
ever, dirty and underhanded
methods of gaining an advantage
over opponents are definitely un
wanted. Unfair scholastic advan
tages may he viewed as synony
mous and are looked upon with
the same distaste.
The testing ground of character
is the Honor Code; just as the ath
letic field is the test of sportsman
ship. These tests arc the basis of
mutual trusts which develop in
the competitive world later. —

under the odious proctoring sys

emerging from a dark cellar into
Californa sunshine. As I have said
before, if Stanford students could
realize the boon they have in the
Honor Code, they would fight for
it like real Indians.—B. Q. Mor
gan, professor of German.
