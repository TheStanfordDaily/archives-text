# Students Fought For Honor Code
## 
### JOHN AVERILL 
(Student agitatiory for a system of self-government began almost at
the outset ol Stanford's history. Resentment grew against the proctor
.system which governed the taking of examinations.
(After eight years of verbal battling, the faculty consented to a lim
ited form ot student government, which was cautiously examined by the
students. And upon their acceptance, the experiment began.
(Second in a series of four articles on the Honor Code follows. The
series is designed to show the importance of the Honor Code to the school
and to reiterate that the student control we have is ours only if we
continue to show that we can accept responsibility.)

Student control as it exists today didn't spring completely
from that concession of 1912. Many students could not forego
the passive attitude that irresponsibility had bred, while others
interpreted the faculty movement as being a license for un
controlled freedom of action. Both groups were an obstacle to
the conscientious leaders who, lacking an unqualified and posi
tive support, found themselves in the difficult situation of trying
to erect a suitable framework on a quasi-solid foundation.
The new student government remained under the watchful
scrutiny of the faculty committees. In 1915 President Branner
appointed various professors to v/atch-dog councils that carefully

and minutely surveyed the students' j
progress. Professors Murray O.
Wildman and David M. Folsorn suc
cessively headed committees on stu
dent affairs.
SUCCESS ACKNOWLEDGED
Both men agreed on student suc
cess in forwarding cordial feelings j
between students and faculty and j
showing a keen sense of fairness in
judging discipline cases. Control j
failed, they stated, in not organizing j
the executive side of government |
and not creating a sense of student |
responsibility.
The long-smoldering fire blazed |
when in the same year Chancellor i
David Stari' Jordan declared:
JORDAN JELLS VIEWS
"I was in favor of student control J
of student behavior when the plan j
was first brought forward. The ideal |
is, of course, that every student I
should have character, determina- j
lion, and sense enough to control his j
own behavior.
"In a few cases where this is not !
true it is better that the student j
body should take the responsibility i
through its proper committees. It
should thus help the University to j
eliminate all those who are doing j
the University more harm than the •
good the institution is able to do I
them.
MUTUAL DUTIES DEFINED
"It is not a part of the University's
duty to give its instructions to those
who are personally dishonest or
whose dissipated habits are likely
to bring disgrace upon the institu
tion. Those should not be punished,
but simply eliminated if they can
not be brought to an appreciation of
their own duty to themselves and
to the University in such matters.
"So far as I have been able to j
watch the working of student con- i
trol it has been reasonably satis- j
factory. The chief weakness arises j
from lack of interest. It is not often ;
that the committee has occasion to j
act. When the occasion does arise, j
it is vitally essential that those con- |
eerned should be interested and >
firm."
INCREASES DEMAND
Dr. Jordan's statement scored a j
further, inerfwse in demands for
an h oft or system. Such a code had
been adopted in the Law SchooLand
had proved a distinct success—and
to a degree that prompted many I
law students to hold their fellows j
of different academic fields in con- j
tempt.
Following this lead, other depart- j
merits borrowed, in various dis- j
guises, the Law School's code. A ;
setback was registered in that year, |
however, when students of the ITis- |
tory Department failed to display j
sufficient enthusiasm for the incep
tion of a similar system.
PUBLICATIONS HACK DRIVE
Nevertheless, the campaign per- j
sisted. Student publications were I
especially vociferous. The Decern- j
ber 1916 Sequoia carried an article j
entitled "Honor System at Prince- !
ton" in which a history of that J
school's code was related. After !
studying the unusual success which !
several Southern schools obtained I
with an honor system, Princeton |

student leaders had placed the is
sue before their fellows. A unani
mous demand resulted in the in
auguration of the Princeton Code of
18£3. Since that time, stated the
article, the code has become "a
Princeton way of life."
Th« cry at Stanford had greatly
multiplied by 1921. War veterans
returned to school and, wishing to
be treated as men, resented the ap
parent lack of faith that many pro
lessors displayed during examina
tions. There were also protests and
condemnations of the amount of
cheating that was then prevalent.
Code advocates felt an honor sys
tem was the only answer./
In April of '21 the Stanford Il
lustrated Review, in discussing the
cheating question, compared the
systems of Princeton and Harvard.
Harvard, said the Review, chose
the proctor system to insure fair
ness during examinations; Princeton
chose the honor system. In other
words, "The proctor system keeps
the students honest while the honor
system makes them honest,"

Accenting the current know
thc-Honor Code campaign, mem
bers of the Code standing com
mittee met last night to devise
methods of better publicizing the
Honor System to the whole stu
dent body.
Emphasizing that talks on the
Code to be the most effective
means of instilling understanding
and comprehension of the system,
Chairman AI Forbes declared,
"The Committee will send a
speaker to any living group desir
ing a discussion of the Code."
Forbes also brought to the
group's attention that if the code
is to be retained, it must work
properly. For this reason, he stat
ed. it is necessary that each stu
dent be thoroughly acquainted
with it.

The Review, stressing the success
which various Stanford departments
had had wilh a code, also made a
vigorous call for the adoption of the
system throughout the University.
Finally, ontMay 24. 1921. the Daily
Palo Alto, predecessor of the Daily,
blared:
"The Stanford faculty, acting \ipon
a petition from the students, has
approved the plan for an honor
system in examinations throughout
the University. The honor system
will be put into effect in the final
examinations of the present quar
ter in July."


SCHOOL IN BLKLIN—This is (lie Thomas A. Robert high school
in Berlin, recently opened in the OMGUS American sector, with an
enrollment of 2011 students. Edwin M. Hoyne, formerly of Michigan
General State College, is principal. School was named for American
colonel killed in Normandy.
