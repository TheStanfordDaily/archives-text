## Excom Meets the Outside World 
### 
Now that Stanford has played its way into
th eighth week of autumn quarter, the issues
which clearly concern the students are emerg
j a id demanding the attention of policy
i J ors throughout the University.
Often these policy makers have dealt
rnlc?ly with the student issues receiving the
most momentary publicity, and rarely have
1:.. i the foresight to inaugurate themselves a
'..uly actionable policy.
Tonight, the official student policy makers
■Mi ! ;< cutive Committee will have the oppor
tune to step beyond the confining day-to-day
com. iderations of most agendas, and make a
,!( , in the direction of far-sighted action.
At the instigation of student body presi
■i< mt Martin Anderson, an unofficial investi
?.j.itioi) has been conducted throughout the
< >i ; a to determine what place Stanford can
l in international student affairs.
The resultant program, drafted by inter
<• i indents, will be presented for Excom
■ ation tonight, and asks for the forma
tion < [ a committee which will:
]) Investigate the advisability of Stan
fo.'i':; joining with existing organizations of
students from all over the world; and
2) Organize the methods by which Stan
i id's student body can be introduced to the
f.' nomic, political, and cultural problems in
overseas areas. It is proposed that

Stanford students travel abroad during sum
mer and return in autumn with analytical re
ports of what they have seen.
Such a program must not be half-heartedly
accepted or rejected by Excom. If the plan is
to succeed at all, it needs the all-out aid, criti
cal analysis and financial support of the Asso
ciated Students; those persons participating
directly in the program must be Stanford's ma
ture, deep-thinking leaders.
To give the necessary support, Excom
members must first realize their power to set
the pace for the student body—they can
either continue to foster the undirected activi
ties and attitudes of most Stanford students, or
they can establish a policy of international
participation which will emphasize and spread
their acceptance of international ideals.
Excom is in a position now where she can
be of positive help in turning out students who
are mentally and emotionally aware enough
of world problems to be valuable assets as
citizens.
Stanford students will not be in a position
to criticize the world outside until they have
consciously, eyes open, "walked about" out
side. They have no right to moan that affairs
outside are being poorly handled until they
have accepted their share of the effort to make
them go right.
It's Excorn's decision; we hope sound
thinking will go into it.

f.' nomic, political, and cultural problems in
overseas areas. It is proposed that

Stanford students travel abroad during sum
mer and return in autumn with analytical re
ports of what they have seen.
Such a program must not be half-heartedly
accepted or rejected by Excom. If the plan is
to succeed at all, it needs the all-out aid, criti
cal analysis and financial support of the Asso
ciated Students; those persons participating
directly in the program must be Stanford's ma
ture, deep-thinking leaders.
To give the necessary support, Excom
members must first realize their power to set
the pace for the student body—they can
either continue to foster the undirected activi
ties and attitudes of most Stanford students, or
they can establish a policy of international
participation which will emphasize and spread
their acceptance of international ideals.
Excom is in a position now where she can
be of positive help in turning out students who
are mentally and emotionally aware enough
of world problems to be valuable assets as
citizens.
Stanford students will not be in a position
to criticize the world outside until they have
consciously, eyes open, "walked about" out
side. They have no right to moan that affairs
outside are being poorly handled until they
have accepted their share of the effort to make
them go right.
It's Excorn's decision; we hope sound
thinking will go into it.
Now that Stanford has played its way into
th eighth week of autumn quarter, the issues
which clearly concern the students are emerg
