'I u (lie Editor:
i in que: lion has been raised as to what would
Ik- most fitting memorial to those Stanford stu
v.iio cave tlieir lives that such universities as
■ lord mi hi continue to exist. What contribution
student body can "we, the living" make that
• ii i = i"ii'imeaning to the words "that they may not
died in vain"? This is a serious question that
d( < rves a serious answer.
i' ir.a, let us decide:
ih-i'i anything that we can do while students
wit! contribute to advancing the objectives of
i i: : ionai peace and of the common welfare of
nl -iid'.' Are these vague, meaningless words or
tlicy be interpreted into action by the students
M.io of the leading educational institutions of the
' !? If we can make some contribution to l'urther
■ il\ of these objectives perhaps we can add to the
tiling of Lincoln's solemn words.
.suggestion is that we students should sup
p< ami lake an active part in making Stanford Uni
itj in ei'.ucational light to which the peoples of
*''orl<i look with respect, an institution to which
. 11 1 . ni/.ation such as the United Nations (wher
> vjt it may be located) may look for assistance in
i in'hi vement of its goals. How?
I. I'ii ;t. there should be established an Institute
"I International AfTairs or Relations (such as there
t Y; . Princeton, Johns Hopkins, Columbia, Vir
■ 'ina. . v,. nell. U.S.C., and others of the leading uni
v< 'ties of this country).
Such an institute would have the purpose of (a)
'< -opi rating with the United Nations Educational,
ii' 1 ic and Cultural Organization in the carrying
i it .1 its program, and (b) to train Americans and
■! n Indents for leadership in international af
('•) The study of international affairs as a basis
■ hl;( ral education. It would include the present
i h>n ol Pacific-Asiatic-Russian Studies, plus di
" ii oi European Studies and Afro-Indian-Mo
i'.'i' Studies, and the existing Hoover Library
■ ' n. Revolution, and Peace. Professorial chairs
' M have to b" established at high salaries. This
i require the finest, men available including,
I' ii illy, retired statesmen. One of the functions
' h an institute could be to sponsor discussion
1 "ii (.'in-rent problems in international rela
i . Such an institute should not only receive stu
nt sup-port but be correlated with student activi
ties.
'' Second, as has already been proposed, an In
11.11 i.> n. i! House should be built —a place where
ri<-. us can meet, live with, and get to know stu
dent of ether lands. Again, such a house's activities
be closely integrated into campus affairs. Such
priced is especially important in the light of plans
'< ml.v miniated for greatly increased Student Ex-
Congress passed this summer the Fulbright
i' : which will finance by sale of surplus property a
'■I-wide exchange of students and professors. It
tim,ned that once the program gets under way
1 tMI.OOO American# and 50,000 students of other coun
' i will Im exchanged. Stanford will have its share

of those .students. Another program awaiting Con
gressional approval will have the Secretary of State
finance the exchange of students, professors, scien
tists, technicians, government officials, book facili
ties, throughout the world. The State Department
already has a program of exchange scholarships
within the Western Hemisphere. Add to the U.S.
program those run by other countries and the inter
national scholarships made available by millions of
dollars of private funds, and the result in the years
ahead is to be international education of hundreds
of thousands. What part is Stanford going to play in
this spreading of mutual good-will and understand
ing throughout the world? Is Stanford going to take
the responsibility of leadership which her position
demands? If so, we should start now to make plans
in that direction.
111. Thirdly, in continuation of these aims, Stan
ford should have her own World Scholarship and
Fellowship Program so that she will have outstand
ing students to develop into world leaders from ev
ery state in the Union and from every country in
the world.
IV. Fourthly, we students should support the
measure to be discussed by Excom this week, Stan
lord's participation in World Student Organizations.
V. Fifthly, we should support a student radio sta
tion which could develop, in co-operation with
UNESCO, into a worldwide station dedicated to in
creasing international co-operation and understand
ing.
Any one of these ideas could be developed into
a War Memorial Project or all of them could be in
corporated into a War Memorial Program. The
important thing is that students think and then take
action of some kind. There needs to be discussion,
there needs to be practical thinking and visionary
thinking. Above all, we need to be an alive student
body! A student body that is interested in the prob
lems of today. A student body that demonstrates this
interest by taking part in student body government.
A student body that is dynamic and interested in
international affairs is a student body that puts its
democracy into action by participating in student
government. What better way could there be to
show our exchange students that democracy works
than by making it work right here on campus? Who
knows, maybe some day there will be Soviet stu
dents here. But is there evidence that we want to
make democracy work? Is there evidence in the
recent 20 per cent vote? Is there evidence in the
last two elections being illegal?
Hey! Guys and gals, let's get off the dime. Our
campus life won't be any better than we make it.
There are twice as many of us here now as there
were before the war. Let's show twice the life and
twice the thinking. Most of us are veterans. Most
ol us are supposed to have learned what, we were
fighting for, what our buddies died for. Let's show
it. Let's show that Stanford students CAN make a
contribution to lasting peace. That is a challenge—
will we accept it?
