# Branner Runs Date Bureau
## 
### MARJORIE SAMPSON 
"Tall, dark and handsome." Those
seem to be the prime requisites of
Branner girls for blind dates ac
quired through their newly in
stalled Date Committee. Men who
do not fit into that category do have
hope though, as the girls also like
them "not too intelligent."
Men who like sports — they are
probably thinking of football play
ers and the like—are looked upon
with great favor, and other desir
able males, according to 'the girls'
applications, are those who are "lots
of fun." Though, on one applica
tion from a Branner girl there was
written, where it asked what kind
of a man she liked, "Anything, so
long as he doesn't chew tobacco."
The men also have definite ideas
on the type of girl they want to go
out with. Most of them aren't too
particular. All they ask is that the
girl ix' very beautiful, have a won
derful personality, and not be too
intelligent. That's all. The men,
though, have a tendency to over
rate both their good looks and their
height.
Experimenting in a new "boy
meets-girl" technique lor Stanford,
Branner has started the first date
bureau in campus history. Date
Com. designed to bring together
men and women with similar likes
and dislikes, has been loaded nearly
to capacity with applications from
Farm men. As a rsult of all these
'calls coming in for blind dates, and
since there just aren't enough Bran
ner girls to go around, members of
the Date Com have been kept busy
the whole time.
Dale Com has set up a system
whereby both Branner girls and
men from all over the campus can
sign up for blind dates for when
ever they want them. Once a man
has had an interview with a mem
ber of (he commijt.ee and has filled
out his application, he can phone
Date Com a Jew days in advance of
the day he wants a date, and the
committee will arrange it for him.
Everyone who signs an applica
tion, either man or woman, de
scribes himself, tells his main in
terests, and the type of person he
wants to go out with. This applica
tion is put on a special cross-filing
system, and in this way dates can
be arranged between people who
have similar interests.

"Tall, dark and handsome." Those
seem to be the prime requisites of
Branner girls for blind dates ac
quired through their newly in
stalled Date Committee. Men who
do not fit into that category do have
hope though, as the girls also like
them "not too intelligent."
Men who like sports — they are
probably thinking of football play
ers and the like—are looked upon
with great favor, and other desir
able males, according to 'the girls'
applications, are those who are "lots
of fun." Though, on one applica
tion from a Branner girl there was
written, where it asked what kind
of a man she liked, "Anything, so
long as he doesn't chew tobacco."
The men also have definite ideas
on the type of girl they want to go
out with. Most of them aren't too
particular. All they ask is that the
girl ix' very beautiful, have a won
derful personality, and not be too
intelligent. That's all. The men,
though, have a tendency to over
rate both their good looks and their
height.
Experimenting in a new "boy
meets-girl" technique lor Stanford,
Branner has started the first date
bureau in campus history. Date
Com. designed to bring together
men and women with similar likes
and dislikes, has been loaded nearly
to capacity with applications from
Farm men. As a rsult of all these
'calls coming in for blind dates, and
since there just aren't enough Bran
ner girls to go around, members of
the Date Com have been kept busy
the whole time.
Dale Com has set up a system
whereby both Branner girls and
men from all over the campus can
sign up for blind dates for when
ever they want them. Once a man
has had an interview with a mem
ber of (he commijt.ee and has filled
out his application, he can phone
Date Com a Jew days in advance of
the day he wants a date, and the
committee will arrange it for him.
