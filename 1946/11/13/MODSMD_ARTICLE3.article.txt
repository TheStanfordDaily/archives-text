# Student Reporters Inspect Three San Francisco Firms
## 
### 
The old success formula—brains, initiative, and hard-work—
are one thing the new Atomic Age didn't leave behind. The
! college graduate with the newly-won sheepskin must still face
! a long climb upward from the bottom rung of the ladder in
business and industry.

So learned a group of 11 bay area
college newspaper reporters yester
day as they toured the plants and
j interviewed the executives of three
{ San Francisco business firms.
1 The tour, similar to one taken re
j cently by San Francisco newspaper
j men, was sponsored by the National
I Association of Manufacturers,
j There are jobs awaiting the col
lege graduate, all the executives ad
i mitted that, but (he men were in
general agreement that the man
with the degree is no farther along
: the road to success in industry when
!he graduates than the man who
1 never saw the inside of a university
classroom.
Bui they felt that he does have
; the background, initiative, -and
! trained mind which make for steady
| advancement in the industrial cor-
I poration over the non-college man.
Mr. A. D. Lay ton, vice-president
jof Crown Zellerbach Corporation,
' second largest producer of news
print in the U.S., told the college
I reporters that his company con
| stantly seeks young people with a
good education, men to learn the
business "from the bottom up."
i He recommended a Mechanical or
: Chemical Engineering course as the
best college training for work in tlw:
I Zellerbach corporation.'
I Mr. E. C. Lipman, vice-president
j of The Emporium department store,
felt that college training is of no
; great immediate help in making ad
vancement in the retail store busi
! i less.
He advised that the college grad
i uate plan on two or three years
learning all phases of the business
much as he would take a post
graduate university course. Mr.
Lipman stressed that opportunities
for women are almost equal to
those for men.
Opportunities in the expanding
i garment industry on the Pacific
Coast are limited to graduates in
sales, advertising, engineering, and
art, according to Mi - . Joseph Caruso,
production engineer of the Lilli-Ann
Company. Jobs _for the university
man begin at the bottom in this in
i dustry, also.
Lunching with Capt. Andrew C.
; Shephard, Commander Minecraft,
Pacific Fleet, on the U.S.S. Terror
] docked at Treasure Island, Ihe
; group learned of the Navy's need
for officers in the post-war Navy, a
future some college men may be in
terested in.—Haight.
