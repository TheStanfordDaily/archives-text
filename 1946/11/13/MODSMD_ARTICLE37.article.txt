## CARD STUNTS 
### 
The case of Howie Dallmar is all closed. But during the weekend that
iowie left the Farm for the East to play professional basketball, his coach
v;us away from Stanford. While Howie was trying to make up his mind
vhether to accept the $9,500 offer or not, he also kept worrying about what
oach Everett Dean would have to say about the whole business.
Hoop mentor Dean is hack with us again now, and even though his
nswer is too late to' inlluence Howie's decision in any way, his opinion
bout the whole affair pretty well sums up what most Stanfordites felt
vhen Howie made his decision. This is how basketball coach Dean feels
oncerning this matter:
"The loss of Ilowie Dallmar was a great shock to Stanford basketball
fans, and especially to the team and coach. While I was definitely op
posed to Howie going 'pro' before graduating. 1 do not blame him, but
instead place the blame on the professional organization that made the
offer. As far as I know, other professional organizations are doing a good
job in avoiding the signing of college players until alter graduation. It
seems that the new basketball league has made an unsportsmanlike
move which will give them trouble sooner or later."
With this. Howie's case is closed tighter than ever, and the main in
erest of the basketball team and its fans should be directed toward the
oming season. First game will be against San Jose State on Nov. 25, and
vith or without Howie Dallmar, the Indian team will be in there? fighting.

Intramural sportsters were at it again last week, and in a big way at
hat. Three hundred and forty-three men were playing football, 200
oughs were out on the volleyball courts, 70 eager beavers were swinging
;olf clubs in the 'mural program, and 48 of the students participated in
he horseshoe competition. Which all adds up to a grand total of 661
Stanford mon engaged in intramurals during the week.
Laying Dutch YVarmerdam's statistics aside. 1 find that the number
of unbeaten football teams in the program has been cut down to II
stalwarts. The I'lii Dells fell victim to the Biz School, (i to 0. the V 312
(sounds like some rocket weapon, doesn't it) defeated the Theta Deits
7 to li. the V 20S (another one) knocked out the D.U.'s HI to 6, while the
A.K.L.'s forfeited their game.
This may lead to arguments, but the Question Marks' Bob Fair is
nobably the best passer in the football leagues. His team defeated the
'hi Psi's 32 to 0, and made every TD with Bob's passing. An excellent
eceiver .for Bob's slinging is the Questior? Marks' Bob Hughey.

Thursday this week will see two crucials played, one in League X
.hen the Legal Eagles meet V 210, and in League V when the Question*
Marks tangle with the S.A.E.'s. All four of these ball clubs are undefeated,
ind these tilts will just about settle the league championships in each
ase. All leagues are'coming into home stretch this week, as all league
»lay ends on Nov. 1!), with the first playoffs scheduled for Nov. 20 and 21,
vhile the semi-finals and finals are slated for the 25th and 26th of this
month.
A team which is starting to look powerful is V 210 as they toyed with
l'oyon IE to the tune of 53-0. On the whole, league leaders are well
distributed, with How teams leading three leagues, Village clubs top
ping three leagues and tied for first place in another league, and inde
pendents and graduate schools like Legal Eagles. Biz School. El Toro,
rirehousc. and Question Marks leading the balance of the leagues.
In volleyball competition the leagues are now past midseason with eight
unbeaten teams left in five leagues. All leaders are Row teams except in
ueague IV where the Biz School shares top honors with the Phi Psi's. The
\>est outfits in volleyball are the Theta Delts. who have won four games
>ncl lost none, and the Kappa Sigs with a 3 to 0 league score in their
I'avor. Both these clubs will meet for the championship play-offs, and the
.est of the leagues will settle their decisions this week before the finals
tart next week.
The mural golf competition got under way with a bang when 19 first
round eliminations were played during the week. Ten further golf matches
are scheduled for this week as this new phase of 'mural sports produced
i great deal of enthusiasm. The horseshoe competition is also coming along
fine with a double-elimination tourney going full blast. Results of the
lirst two matches saw the Sigma Nu's defeat the S.A.E.'s while the V 214
pitched out the A.K.L.'s by 161 to 119.
Just to add a bit of humor at this point, I thought you might like to
hear about the escapades of one of our Farm men last Monday after
noon. Seems thi> particular gentleman—l wouldn't mention his name—
was taking his girl friend for a sightseeing tour of the campus, and
wanted to include the Men's Gym on the itinerary. So he and his girl
walked right into the men's pool where the hardy swimming students
were diving from the hoard in their birthday suits.
Boy, was that girl embarrassed and mad—from now on she intends
using an official plan of the University before looking around.

The University Tennis Tournament is moving right along with six
Jndian netters in the quarter-final rounds, and top-seeded Arnie Beisser
already in a semi-final spot.
The six in the quarter-finals are Lucian Barbour, Doug Tuck, Dave
Basham, Bob Keenan. Bob Lewis, and Bob Rutledge, and with net play
•ontinuing daily, it won't be long before coach Elwyn Buggo will be able
to invite the students to come down to the courts for the final match and
University championship.

The campus postoffice pulled a fast one last week. Jake Irwin, who
has handled sales for Ihe Encina Gym store during the past 25 years, was
lo receive a bill from E. 13. Thurber's Sporting Goods store (plug) for 24
dozen bike supporters delivered to the Men's Gym some time ago. The
good old P.O. didn't think Jnke should get the bill, and so forwarded it
lo Jane Irwin, an Oakland girl who __

graduated from the Farm this year.
Jane very politely typed the follow
ing reply:
Board of Athletic Control
Stanford University, California
To whom it may concern:
I really wish I could oblige Mr.
Ernie Thurber by paying him
$135.30, but as that is impossible
at this time. I am sending this
bill on to you.
I suppose it was intended for
Mr. Ernie Irwin, although the
poor misguided sole (Ed. note:
She meant soul, no doubt) who
addressed the envelope wrote
"Jake Irwin."
I hope this reaches you without
further mishap and that the 24
doz. bike supporters (whatever
they are!) arrived intact.

Thursday this week will see two crucials played, one in League X
.hen the Legal Eagles meet V 210, and in League V when the Question*
Marks tangle with the S.A.E.'s. All four of these ball clubs are undefeated,
ind these tilts will just about settle the league championships in each
ase. All leagues are'coming into home stretch this week, as all league
»lay ends on Nov. 1!), with the first playoffs scheduled for Nov. 20 and 21,
vhile the semi-finals and finals are slated for the 25th and 26th of this
month.
A team which is starting to look powerful is V 210 as they toyed with
l'oyon IE to the tune of 53-0. On the whole, league leaders are well
distributed, with How teams leading three leagues, Village clubs top
ping three leagues and tied for first place in another league, and inde
pendents and graduate schools like Legal Eagles. Biz School. El Toro,
rirehousc. and Question Marks leading the balance of the leagues.
In volleyball competition the leagues are now past midseason with eight
unbeaten teams left in five leagues. All leaders are Row teams except in
ueague IV where the Biz School shares top honors with the Phi Psi's. The
\>est outfits in volleyball are the Theta Delts. who have won four games
>ncl lost none, and the Kappa Sigs with a 3 to 0 league score in their
I'avor. Both these clubs will meet for the championship play-offs, and the
.est of the leagues will settle their decisions this week before the finals
tart next week.
The mural golf competition got under way with a bang when 19 first
round eliminations were played during the week. Ten further golf matches
are scheduled for this week as this new phase of 'mural sports produced
i great deal of enthusiasm. The horseshoe competition is also coming along
fine with a double-elimination tourney going full blast. Results of the
lirst two matches saw the Sigma Nu's defeat the S.A.E.'s while the V 214
pitched out the A.K.L.'s by 161 to 119.
Just to add a bit of humor at this point, I thought you might like to
hear about the escapades of one of our Farm men last Monday after
noon. Seems thi> particular gentleman—l wouldn't mention his name—
was taking his girl friend for a sightseeing tour of the campus, and
wanted to include the Men's Gym on the itinerary. So he and his girl
walked right into the men's pool where the hardy swimming students
were diving from the hoard in their birthday suits.
Boy, was that girl embarrassed and mad—from now on she intends
using an official plan of the University before looking around.

The campus postoffice pulled a fast one last week. Jake Irwin, who
has handled sales for Ihe Encina Gym store during the past 25 years, was
lo receive a bill from E. 13. Thurber's Sporting Goods store (plug) for 24
dozen bike supporters delivered to the Men's Gym some time ago. The
good old P.O. didn't think Jnke should get the bill, and so forwarded it
lo Jane Irwin, an Oakland girl who __

graduated from the Farm this year.
Jane very politely typed the follow
ing reply:
Board of Athletic Control
Stanford University, California
To whom it may concern:
I really wish I could oblige Mr.
Ernie Thurber by paying him
$135.30, but as that is impossible
at this time. I am sending this
bill on to you.
I suppose it was intended for
Mr. Ernie Irwin, although the
poor misguided sole (Ed. note:
She meant soul, no doubt) who
addressed the envelope wrote
"Jake Irwin."
I hope this reaches you without
further mishap and that the 24

they are!) arrived intact.

So goes life on the Farm for all

fun.
The case of Howie Dallmar is all closed. But during the weekend that
iowie left the Farm for the East to play professional basketball, his coach
v;us away from Stanford. While Howie was trying to make up his mind
vhether to accept the $9,500 offer or not, he also kept worrying about what
oach Everett Dean would have to say about the whole business.
Hoop mentor Dean is hack with us again now, and even though his
nswer is too late to' inlluence Howie's decision in any way, his opinion
bout the whole affair pretty well sums up what most Stanfordites felt
vhen Howie made his decision. This is how basketball coach Dean feels
oncerning this matter:
"The loss of Ilowie Dallmar was a great shock to Stanford basketball
fans, and especially to the team and coach. While I was definitely op
posed to Howie going 'pro' before graduating. 1 do not blame him, but
instead place the blame on the professional organization that made the
offer. As far as I know, other professional organizations are doing a good
job in avoiding the signing of college players until alter graduation. It
seems that the new basketball league has made an unsportsmanlike
move which will give them trouble sooner or later."
With this. Howie's case is closed tighter than ever, and the main in
erest of the basketball team and its fans should be directed toward the
oming season. First game will be against San Jose State on Nov. 25, and
vith or without Howie Dallmar, the Indian team will be in there? fighting.

Intramural sportsters were at it again last week, and in a big way at
hat. Three hundred and forty-three men were playing football, 200
oughs were out on the volleyball courts, 70 eager beavers were swinging
;olf clubs in the 'mural program, and 48 of the students participated in
he horseshoe competition. Which all adds up to a grand total of 661
Stanford mon engaged in intramurals during the week.
Laying Dutch YVarmerdam's statistics aside. 1 find that the number
of unbeaten football teams in the program has been cut down to II
stalwarts. The I'lii Dells fell victim to the Biz School, (i to 0. the V 312
(sounds like some rocket weapon, doesn't it) defeated the Theta Deits
7 to li. the V 20S (another one) knocked out the D.U.'s HI to 6, while the
A.K.L.'s forfeited their game.
This may lead to arguments, but the Question Marks' Bob Fair is
nobably the best passer in the football leagues. His team defeated the
'hi Psi's 32 to 0, and made every TD with Bob's passing. An excellent

The University Tennis Tournament is moving right along with six
Jndian netters in the quarter-final rounds, and top-seeded Arnie Beisser
already in a semi-final spot.
The six in the quarter-finals are Lucian Barbour, Doug Tuck, Dave
Basham, Bob Keenan. Bob Lewis, and Bob Rutledge, and with net play
•ontinuing daily, it won't be long before coach Elwyn Buggo will be able
to invite the students to come down to the courts for the final match and
University championship.

The campus postoffice pulled a fast one last week. Jake Irwin, who
has handled sales for Ihe Encina Gym store during the past 25 years, was
lo receive a bill from E. 13. Thurber's Sporting Goods store (plug) for 24
dozen bike supporters delivered to the Men's Gym some time ago. The
good old P.O. didn't think Jnke should get the bill, and so forwarded it
lo Jane Irwin, an Oakland girl who __

graduated from the Farm this year.
Jane very politely typed the follow
ing reply:
Board of Athletic Control
Stanford University, California
To whom it may concern:
I really wish I could oblige Mr.
Ernie Thurber by paying him
$135.30, but as that is impossible
at this time. I am sending this
bill on to you.
I suppose it was intended for
Mr. Ernie Irwin, although the
poor misguided sole (Ed. note:
She meant soul, no doubt) who
addressed the envelope wrote
"Jake Irwin."
I hope this reaches you without
further mishap and that the 24
doz. bike supporters (whatever
they are!) arrived intact.

So goes life on the Farm for all
the athletes and Gym store manag
ers and what-have-you. But it's
fun.
The case of Howie Dallmar is all closed. But during the weekend that
iowie left the Farm for the East to play professional basketball, his coach
v;us away from Stanford. While Howie was trying to make up his mind
vhether to accept the $9,500 offer or not, he also kept worrying about what
oach Everett Dean would have to say about the whole business.
Hoop mentor Dean is hack with us again now, and even though his
nswer is too late to' inlluence Howie's decision in any way, his opinion
bout the whole affair pretty well sums up what most Stanfordites felt
vhen Howie made his decision. This is how basketball coach Dean feels
oncerning this matter:
"The loss of Ilowie Dallmar was a great shock to Stanford basketball
fans, and especially to the team and coach. While I was definitely op
posed to Howie going 'pro' before graduating. 1 do not blame him, but
instead place the blame on the professional organization that made the
offer. As far as I know, other professional organizations are doing a good
job in avoiding the signing of college players until alter graduation. It
seems that the new basketball league has made an unsportsmanlike
move which will give them trouble sooner or later."
With this. Howie's case is closed tighter than ever, and the main in
erest of the basketball team and its fans should be directed toward the
oming season. First game will be against San Jose State on Nov. 25, and
vith or without Howie Dallmar, the Indian team will be in there? fighting.

Intramural sportsters were at it again last week, and in a big way at
hat. Three hundred and forty-three men were playing football, 200
oughs were out on the volleyball courts, 70 eager beavers were swinging
;olf clubs in the 'mural program, and 48 of the students participated in
he horseshoe competition. Which all adds up to a grand total of 661
Stanford mon engaged in intramurals during the week.
Laying Dutch YVarmerdam's statistics aside. 1 find that the number
of unbeaten football teams in the program has been cut down to II
stalwarts. The I'lii Dells fell victim to the Biz School, (i to 0. the V 312
(sounds like some rocket weapon, doesn't it) defeated the Theta Deits
7 to li. the V 20S (another one) knocked out the D.U.'s HI to 6, while the
A.K.L.'s forfeited their game.
This may lead to arguments, but the Question Marks' Bob Fair is
nobably the best passer in the football leagues. His team defeated the
'hi Psi's 32 to 0, and made every TD with Bob's passing. An excellent
eceiver .for Bob's slinging is the Questior? Marks' Bob Hughey.

Thursday this week will see two crucials played, one in League X
.hen the Legal Eagles meet V 210, and in League V when the Question*
Marks tangle with the S.A.E.'s. All four of these ball clubs are undefeated,
ind these tilts will just about settle the league championships in each
ase. All leagues are'coming into home stretch this week, as all league
»lay ends on Nov. 1!), with the first playoffs scheduled for Nov. 20 and 21,
vhile the semi-finals and finals are slated for the 25th and 26th of this
month.
A team which is starting to look powerful is V 210 as they toyed with
l'oyon IE to the tune of 53-0. On the whole, league leaders are well
distributed, with How teams leading three leagues, Village clubs top
ping three leagues and tied for first place in another league, and inde
pendents and graduate schools like Legal Eagles. Biz School. El Toro,
rirehousc. and Question Marks leading the balance of the leagues.
In volleyball competition the leagues are now past midseason with eight
unbeaten teams left in five leagues. All leaders are Row teams except in
ueague IV where the Biz School shares top honors with the Phi Psi's. The
\>est outfits in volleyball are the Theta Delts. who have won four games
>ncl lost none, and the Kappa Sigs with a 3 to 0 league score in their
I'avor. Both these clubs will meet for the championship play-offs, and the
.est of the leagues will settle their decisions this week before the finals
tart next week.
The mural golf competition got under way with a bang when 19 first
round eliminations were played during the week. Ten further golf matches
are scheduled for this week as this new phase of 'mural sports produced
i great deal of enthusiasm. The horseshoe competition is also coming along
fine with a double-elimination tourney going full blast. Results of the
lirst two matches saw the Sigma Nu's defeat the S.A.E.'s while the V 214
pitched out the A.K.L.'s by 161 to 119.
Just to add a bit of humor at this point, I thought you might like to
hear about the escapades of one of our Farm men last Monday after
noon. Seems thi> particular gentleman—l wouldn't mention his name—
was taking his girl friend for a sightseeing tour of the campus, and
wanted to include the Men's Gym on the itinerary. So he and his girl
walked right into the men's pool where the hardy swimming students
were diving from the hoard in their birthday suits.
Boy, was that girl embarrassed and mad—from now on she intends
using an official plan of the University before looking around.

offer. As far as I know, other professional organizations are doing a good
job in avoiding the signing of college players until alter graduation. It
seems that the new basketball league has made an unsportsmanlike
move which will give them trouble sooner or later."
With this. Howie's case is closed tighter than ever, and the main in
erest of the basketball team and its fans should be directed toward the
oming season. First game will be against San Jose State on Nov. 25, and
vith or without Howie Dallmar, the Indian team will be in there? fighting.

Intramural sportsters were at it again last week, and in a big way at
hat. Three hundred and forty-three men were playing football, 200
oughs were out on the volleyball courts, 70 eager beavers were swinging
;olf clubs in the 'mural program, and 48 of the students participated in
he horseshoe competition. Which all adds up to a grand total of 661
Stanford mon engaged in intramurals during the week.
Laying Dutch YVarmerdam's statistics aside. 1 find that the number
of unbeaten football teams in the program has been cut down to II
stalwarts. The I'lii Dells fell victim to the Biz School, (i to 0. the V 312
(sounds like some rocket weapon, doesn't it) defeated the Theta Deits
7 to li. the V 20S (another one) knocked out the D.U.'s HI to 6, while the
A.K.L.'s forfeited their game.
This may lead to arguments, but the Question Marks' Bob Fair is
nobably the best passer in the football leagues. His team defeated the
'hi Psi's 32 to 0, and made every TD with Bob's passing. An excellent
eceiver .for Bob's slinging is the Questior? Marks' Bob Hughey.

Thursday this week will see two crucials played, one in League X
.hen the Legal Eagles meet V 210, and in League V when the Question*
Marks tangle with the S.A.E.'s. All four of these ball clubs are undefeated,
ind these tilts will just about settle the league championships in each
ase. All leagues are'coming into home stretch this week, as all league
»lay ends on Nov. 1!), with the first playoffs scheduled for Nov. 20 and 21,
vhile the semi-finals and finals are slated for the 25th and 26th of this
month.
A team which is starting to look powerful is V 210 as they toyed with
l'oyon IE to the tune of 53-0. On the whole, league leaders are well
distributed, with How teams leading three leagues, Village clubs top
ping three leagues and tied for first place in another league, and inde
pendents and graduate schools like Legal Eagles. Biz School. El Toro,
rirehousc. and Question Marks leading the balance of the leagues.
In volleyball competition the leagues are now past midseason with eight
unbeaten teams left in five leagues. All leaders are Row teams except in
ueague IV where the Biz School shares top honors with the Phi Psi's. The
\>est outfits in volleyball are the Theta Delts. who have won four games
>ncl lost none, and the Kappa Sigs with a 3 to 0 league score in their
I'avor. Both these clubs will meet for the championship play-offs, and the
.est of the leagues will settle their decisions this week before the finals
tart next week.
The mural golf competition got under way with a bang when 19 first
round eliminations were played during the week. Ten further golf matches
are scheduled for this week as this new phase of 'mural sports produced
i great deal of enthusiasm. The horseshoe competition is also coming along
fine with a double-elimination tourney going full blast. Results of the
lirst two matches saw the Sigma Nu's defeat the S.A.E.'s while the V 214
pitched out the A.K.L.'s by 161 to 119.
Just to add a bit of humor at this point, I thought you might like to
hear about the escapades of one of our Farm men last Monday after
noon. Seems thi> particular gentleman—l wouldn't mention his name—
was taking his girl friend for a sightseeing tour of the campus, and
wanted to include the Men's Gym on the itinerary. So he and his girl
walked right into the men's pool where the hardy swimming students
were diving from the hoard in their birthday suits.
Boy, was that girl embarrassed and mad—from now on she intends
using an official plan of the University before looking around.

The University Tennis Tournament is moving right along with six
Jndian netters in the quarter-final rounds, and top-seeded Arnie Beisser

The six in the quarter-finals are Lucian Barbour, Doug Tuck, Dave
Basham, Bob Keenan. Bob Lewis, and Bob Rutledge, and with net play
•ontinuing daily, it won't be long before coach Elwyn Buggo will be able
to invite the students to come down to the courts for the final match and

The campus postoffice pulled a fast one last week. Jake Irwin, who
has handled sales for Ihe Encina Gym store during the past 25 years, was
lo receive a bill from E. 13. Thurber's Sporting Goods store (plug) for 24
dozen bike supporters delivered to the Men's Gym some time ago. The
good old P.O. didn't think Jnke should get the bill, and so forwarded it
lo Jane Irwin, an Oakland girl who __

graduated from the Farm this year.
Jane very politely typed the follow
ing reply:
Board of Athletic Control
Stanford University, California
To whom it may concern:
I really wish I could oblige Mr.
Ernie Thurber by paying him
$135.30, but as that is impossible
at this time. I am sending this
bill on to you.
I suppose it was intended for
Mr. Ernie Irwin, although the
poor misguided sole (Ed. note:
She meant soul, no doubt) who
addressed the envelope wrote
"Jake Irwin."
I hope this reaches you without
further mishap and that the 24
doz. bike supporters (whatever
they are!) arrived intact.
Very truly yours

So goes life on the Farm for all
the athletes and Gym store manag
ers and what-have-you. But it's
fun.
The case of Howie Dallmar is all closed. But during the weekend that
iowie left the Farm for the East to play professional basketball, his coach
v;us away from Stanford. While Howie was trying to make up his mind
vhether to accept the $9,500 offer or not, he also kept worrying about what
oach Everett Dean would have to say about the whole business.
Hoop mentor Dean is hack with us again now, and even though his
nswer is too late to' inlluence Howie's decision in any way, his opinion
bout the whole affair pretty well sums up what most Stanfordites felt
vhen Howie made his decision. This is how basketball coach Dean feels
oncerning this matter:
"The loss of Ilowie Dallmar was a great shock to Stanford basketball
fans, and especially to the team and coach. While I was definitely op
posed to Howie going 'pro' before graduating. 1 do not blame him, but
instead place the blame on the professional organization that made the
offer. As far as I know, other professional organizations are doing a good
job in avoiding the signing of college players until alter graduation. It
seems that the new basketball league has made an unsportsmanlike
move which will give them trouble sooner or later."
