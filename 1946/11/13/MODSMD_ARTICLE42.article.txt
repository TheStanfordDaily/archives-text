# Hall, Brown Lead Gridders
## 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
For the first time this season the
Stanford pigskinners will have co
captains for a grid tilt when Dave
Brown and Bob Hall lead the not
so-big Red Machine onto the Sta
dium turf against Washington State
Saturday. The boys play left and
right end, respectively, so it can be
assumed that they'll start.
Pete August, who opened the
season at center, will be lost for
the rest of the year. His bad knee
didn't hold up too well during his
short period of play against the
Huskies, and he's turned in his
suit. He'll undergo surgery soon.
Harvey Bcrnhard injured his
other knee (he was first injured in
the Santa Clara game) and may go
under the knife too.
Most of the other men are in shape
and ready, although Aubrey Devine
has a sole throat and wasn't at prac
tice last night, and George Quist is
taking it easy. Gene Martin was
running under a full head of steam
and seemed to be in good shape, and
Marty Anderson was doing a lot of
running, with only a slight limp.
The Varsity looked at the weird
Cougar attack as portrayed by
some of the Jayvec boys, but there
was no contact work. In the early
part of the afternoon Mareliie
Schwartz sent bis backs and ends
through a passing drill. Jack Cra
han. Lloyd Mcrriman's under
study, was tossing them long and
well.
Speaking of Merriman, Bud Spen
cer of the San Francisco News has
already selected an All-Coast team
â€”and Lloyd is on it. That should be
no surprise to those who have seen
him play. Spencer, a Stanford grad,
mentioned no other Farm players.
