# Foreign Students Bolster Cardinal Soccer Squad
## 
### B.L. ARMS 
Stanford has a good soccer team this year. One of the reasons
for this is the fact that many of the foreign students registered
here in school are from countries where soccer is played all the
year and is followed with interest comparable to football in the
United States. These boys have naturally turned out for the
Stanford team.

Stocky Ricardo Trcjos, who is
playing a bang-up game at center
forward this year, hails from
Cbsta Rica, where soccer is played
si\ months out of the year and is
the national sport. Ricardo is a
senior'and a major in electrical
engineering. He believes Stanford
has a good team this year consid
ering how little the sport is played
in America. Ricardo's main ambi
tion now is "to win USE again."'
THEY PLAY IT IN TURKEY
Coming from Turkey where soe- j
cer is the national sport to play for !
Stanford is Kamil Guenes. He is a
first lieutenant in the Turkish Army j
and played a good brand of soccer
when he was attaining his commis
sion at the War College in Turkey. !
Short, fiery Ara Galstaum comes 1
from Calcutta, India, and played a
lot of soccer at St. Joseph's Col
lege in India before coming to Stan
ford. Ara is a first-year student
and expects to be around here for
a long time, and incidentally play a
lot of soccer for the Cardinals.
"Of course we play a better
game in India." he commented,
"but for the short time you Amer
icans play here in the States I
think you nlay a very good brand
of soccer."
ANIXIN CHINA. TOO
The next foreign student we met j
on the soccer field was K. S. Quan,
a short, slight Chinese with a per
petual smile on his face, who hails
from Manila. He agreed that soccer
was about the same here as it is in
the Philippines with the exception
that the fellows are a little bigger
in America. With an apologetic
"tank you" Quan again joined the
group practicing on the field.
The last foreign player we saw
was Tony Ortega, a Nicaraguan
who has been playing soccer in
South America ever since he was
old enough to walk. Tony is of

medium height ami looks very
rugged in his soccer uniform. He
played on (he Nicaraguau national
team which played Costa Itica in
I!M2. so you can see he is no new
comer to the sport and is definitely
an asset to the Stanford squad.
