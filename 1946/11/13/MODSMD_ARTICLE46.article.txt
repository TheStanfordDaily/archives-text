With a 10-point safety margin the
Stanford cross country "B" team
beat the San Mateo Junior College
Bulldogs in a two-mile race over
the Indian golf course Tuesday af
ternoon. Dave Church of San Ma
teo turned on a terrific spurt of
speed in the last ten yards to take
first place clocked at 9:58, but the
Indians monopolized five of the next
seven places to win 34-44.
Big Bill Davis of the Indians set
the pace until the last fifty yards
when Stanford's Bob Iverson, A 1

sprinted up the final hill. Church
hit the line a scant two paces ahead
of Iverson.
