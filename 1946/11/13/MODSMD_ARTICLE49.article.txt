# Title-Bound Indian Mermen Face Spartans Again Today
## 
### 
Stanford's tireless water polo team will appear in its third game in
six days this afternoon at 4:15 as they meet the San Jose Spartans in the
Encina Pool. The practice battle will be a return match between the two
schools, with the Indian splashers favored as a result of their 15-7 win
over the Spartans last Thursday.
But today's game may not lie such a cinch for the championship
bound Stanford mermen, for lhc> must defeat over-confidence as well
as the Spartans. With Friday afternoon's league tussle against U.CJLA.
gaining added significance in the standings, the Indians will probably be
looking beyond the San Jose team to the important Bruin game. If the
Indians can defeat the Bruins, they will win the I'.C.C. pennant once
and for all. So, they may underestimate the Spartans in their desire
to whip the Uclans on Friday.
Nevertheless, the Indians displayed such effortless class in defeating
the Spartans and the Olympic Club last week, they should take the San
Jose team in stride. Except for the 10-9 loss to the Olympic Club in
their first outing, the Indian splashers have not been defeated this season.
Indications are that they will continue their six-game winning streak.
