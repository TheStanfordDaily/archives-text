"Are we devils or are we men?"
Hubert Hefl'ncr. professor of dra
! malic literature and executive head
I of Department of Speech and Dra
j ma, attempted to answer this ques
tion yesterday afternoon in another
' of this quarter's poetry-readings.
Mr. Ilefi'ner read from the poetry
of Shakespeare, Tennyson, Pope, T.
S. Eliot and others. Each interpreted
man to his own satisfaction, usually
i according to the age in which he
I lived.
"This modern scientific, age tends
■ to reject the old myth concerning
J divine creation," Mr. Ilefi'ner said.
; "But, life in itself, as a purely bio-
I logical process, has no meaning.
! Therefore, man has himself given
meaning to life. He does this through
religion, art, and philosophy." These
poems that Mr. Heffnor read helped
to give meaning to life.
A favorite of the audience was a
selection from Pope's "Essay on
Man." It was a good example of
| Pope's skeptical attitude toward
I man. He said that man is confused,
j 'born but to die." He is "created
I half to rise, half to fall." He is the
| 'great lord of all things, prey to all."
He admires and knows much wis
' dom, can follow the reasonings of
Plato, but is a fool.
But best liked was T. S. Eliot's
"We Are the Hollow Men." He says
man is quiet and meaningless as
dried grass, a shape without form.
He is not "lost, violent souls but
hollow men, stuffed men." He ends,
"This is the way the world ends, not
with a bang but with a whimper."—
