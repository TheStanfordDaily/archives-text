<!( LOl 'ionizations and clubs. Sohie of these are organized and are directly
iv.' >onsil)le to Excom, while others are purely social or honorary bodies,
;m ! are not responsible to that legislative body.
:5o much confusion reigns and so many issues present themselves that

it is impossible to correlate all
(ii mizations under one heuding.
11 vever, every club or student
:;i .i); must have its constitution
and by-laws passed upon by Excoin.

Many of the clubs, both honorary
ai.d social, are directly supported
b,v Students' Organizations Fund,
w\ t'li consolidates and co-ordinates
ac ounts of the various student or
'j; i/.at ions into one fund. Some
e 1 bs may be supported by this
I d, but not necessarily be subject
to Excom. This is an effort to pre
.st. I some of the more important
oi ani/'.ations and their functions:
AMS HEAD was created for
tl <> students who participate in
stauing of student - controlled
p. ductions. such as the One-Act
I J \s. Spring Show, and Big Game
G (.ties. It is honorary, its mem-
I). s being chosen on a point system
hi ed upon participation in these
pi ductions. Ram's Head's function
is to promote drama on campus and
to choose songs, skits, and plays for
its various productions.
TAN'OKI) CONCERT SERIES
w; s ( itemized when some music
on hu: iasts d "cided in 192(5 that
St; nford students should be intro
du iecl to the finer aspects of their
society. Their function is to bring
; l ists to the campus at a minimum
co: t to students. They are now self
supporting and operate under the
A.S.S.U.
'■'or the interest of debaters I)E-
Wu'il. SOCIETY was set up under
DEBATE C OUNCIL. As one of the
ol lest Stanford clubs, it handles all
ii eicollegiate debating between
S. mt'ord and other universities. The
•ii nual Cal-Stanford debate, in op
oi it ion for 52 years, is the oldest
ci !1< 'iate forensic battle. It is in
di ectly responsible to Excom.
SK! CLUB was organized in the
el ill of the Stanford winter and is
o] on to all amateur skiers on cam
]i: s. Every winter weekend and
d iin : Christinas holidays, the club
ai .anges facilities at Yosemite for
it. members at a reduced rate. They
al-io arrange for skiing lessons un
der the same arrangement. It has
no connection with Excom.
C AMP': THE CIIAI'IME
When the staffs of the Daily and
tl e Stanford Chaparral ceased to
J; ugh at the same jokes in 1900. a
< o' p of Chapari alites established
i HAMMER ANI) COFFIN SO
< lI.TV. breaking off from the older
1 .i.-s Club. It is a purely honorary
o pan Nation, and its members
moose the editor of the Chaparral.
The name, according to the humor
ni; :a:.ine's underground, originated
when Morris Oppenheim, a member
0 the dissenting group, announced
that all Press Club members should
"be socked down with a hammer,
tossed in a coffin, and sealed away."
KI AIIOYA CLUB is a social or
ganization for all off-campus wom
en. It is independent of Excom. As
a :'ioup, its members give dances,
hold lunch meetings and discus
: ions, and arrange other social func
-1 oils which living groups would or
dinarily provide.
ORCIIESIS is an honorary dance
j roup for women. Its members
jive a Dance Concert every spring
( uarter and assist in the dances
iven in Gaieties each year. Mem-
I ership is made upon recommenda
ion of the modern dance instructor,
./Irs. Miriam Lidster.
To promote more friendship bc
: ween foreign and American stu
dents. and to trade ideas upon an
ntci national basis, the INTERNA
' lONAL CLUB was established.
Anyone, both foreign and American
l udents, may become a member.
Meetings are usually held in Amer
ican homes so that the foreign stu
dents may become more acquainted
with life in the United States.
THE STUDENT FEDERALISTS
arc purely a discussion group, es
tablished for promoting the idea of
world government. It was created
last spring quarter, after the origi
nal institution as the "Atomic Con
trol Society." It is not connected
with Excom.
