# Council Punishes Code Violators
## 
### 
Carol Kellogg, chairman of Wom
en's Council, yesterday issued this
statement about the Honor Code:
"The Honor Code is a tradition
which has been deeply imbedded
in the hearts of Stanford students—
along with a strong desire to "make
it work." There have been viola
tions of the Code, however, and un
fortunately the tre nd in this direc
tion has been increasing,
j "Women's Council is one of two
bodies which have been given the

(See story on page 1)

power to enforce the Code and pun
ish violators, but this power has
been misconstrued by some students
who feel that a possible offender is
promptly expelled from school the
minute the Council hears of a vio
lation. This is certainly not the
case.
i "We realize that no one wants to
report a student if he feels that he
will be responsible for the person's
having to leave college. But the
i fact that a student appears before
'■ us for violating the Code does not
I mean that he has actually done so.
"Careful research is made on the
I subject: testimonies are given in
privately held hearings, and names
and facts are withheld from publi
cation. The whole thing may have
; been a misunderstanding on the
part of one or several students and.
if so. the case is dismissed. If there
has been an actual violation. Coun
! ci I takes the action which it deems
necessary in order "to deal with the
offender.
i"The Honor Code is a student re
-1 sponsibility and in order to make it
I effective we must turn away from
j the idea that a student is "doing
wrong" in reporting another stu
dent. The administration has shown
its trust a net confidence in us, the
| student body, by giving us the
: Honor Code, and ii is up to us to
! prove that we are worthy of that
trust."
