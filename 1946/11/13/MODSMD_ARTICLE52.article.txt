# Home-town Papers Best Read—Bush
## 
### 
"Contents of hometown daily
newspapers of average size are read
' more intensively than are the met
ropolitan papers with their greater ,
| number of pages."
These are the results of a second
i series of readership studies con
ducted by Dr. Chilton R. Bush, head
j of the division of journalism.
Dr. Bush found that the average
1 reader—male or female—reads only
15 per cent of the items in papers
of larger size, as compared with 25
■) per cent in papers of ]2 to 1(> pages. (
Pi'idership of graphic .matter of
' very large display advertisements
i varied scarcely at all between the
1 large and small papers. Small pa
! pels were better read for classified
i advertisements, reading matter, and
small and medium-size display ads.
The higher readership of the small
I and medium-size display ad., in the
12- to 16-page papers as compared
with papers of 22 to 44 pages, more
than equalizes the difference in mil
, line rates.
Since the reader of both sizes of
: papers has about the same reading
i time available, the smaller paper is
more intensively read. Dr. Bush
concluded.
