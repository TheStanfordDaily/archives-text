# Farm Shows Homer's Art
## 
### 
Stanford's Art Gallery is now dis- j
playing a collection of .55 engravings I
made from! the art work of Winslow j
Homer, an American artist of the i
Civil War period.
The engravings, made in black
and white from woodblocks, show
Civil War incidents, rural scenes ol
both south and north, and Marine i
settings.
Winslow Homer began his career
as an illustrator, principally for
Harper's Weekly. During the Civil
War he served at' the front as a â– 
combat artist and therefore was j
able to catch the true life of the
common soldier.
PIONEER NATURALIST
Homer was a pioneer naturalist
in a romantic era. and because of i
the frankness and honesty with j
which he expressed the life around j
him. he is regarded as an American j
"Old Master." He made contempo- ,
raiy and common life interesting by
bowing the ordinary but always
remembered scenes ol homelile and
childhood. Homer loved to draw
children and was among the first to
feature the "American Girl."
Gay plantation life is shown in j
his illustrations of southern balls
and pictures of slaves singing as
they worked. The old fashioned \
Yankee farm is expressed through j
barn-dance settings and scenes such
as in "Husking the Corn in New j
England."
Homer is well known for bis pic- |
lures of the sea, especially those j
done in oils. These engravings which
have retained much of the fprii,a>
of gray skies, and wind are some of
his best works. "Dad's Coming'' is
one of the most expressive ilh -ira
t,ions, showing a mother and two
children looking out across a still
sea. The engraving "Winter at Sea" '
captures the excitement of a sunn j
where sailors are trying to hold [
their sail against the snow and wind
EN(;RAYINGS SINCERE
Homer had a fine, decorative feel
ing for his medium but the figures
in many cases seem stiff and un
natural. He expressed his subject
well, but it was through the sincer- i
ity for his subject that his engrav
ings attained their greatness rather !
than through his artistic skill.
Some figures, however, seem very
natural. "The Army of the Foij- j
mac r. Sharp Shooter on Picket 1
Duty" showing a soldier in a tree J
holding a gun. is drawn with both j
skill and feeling.
The exhibit, selected by Lloyd
Goodrich research curator of the j
Whitney Museum of American Art.
will be shown until Dec. 1.
