OUR PRICE
POLICY
Price ceiling is off on men's
clothing .... What now? *
t
We have maintained a policy of giving our
customers quality merchandise at a fair
price since 1906. We have no desire to
change our policy now, nor do we believe
that our many reputable manufacturers will
likewise be so inclined.
Increased manufacturing costs may cause
some necessary increase in prices by manu
facturers. Wideman's prices will always be
in line with our established policy of fair
dealings.
