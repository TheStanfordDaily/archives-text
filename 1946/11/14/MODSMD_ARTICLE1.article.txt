When any group of people are
able to govern successfully a part
of their lives by rules which are
founded on the faith of the indi
vidual's honesty, then that group
has made a mighty contribution to
society.
The Honor Code al Stanford
has been one of our proudest tra
ditions. It is a compliment to ev
ery Stanford student that the stu
dent body lias been able to gov
ern itself along those high prin
ciples.
The Code at Stanford is in a
serious position. If il does not
work, it must be abandoned. That
would mean that though it worked
in the past, the present students
are unable to carry it onâ€”once a
success, now a failure.
If the Honor Code is to continue
to function, it will require active
support, not passive assent.

(Although a limited form of
j student government and respon-
I sihility was granted in I!M2, it
, wasn't until IH2I (hat an honor
, system for examinations for the
I entire University was put into ef
fect. It had first been set lip in
the Law School and was then
adopted by other individual de
partments.
(Third in a series of four arti
cles on the Honor Code follows.
The series is designed to show the
importance of the Honor Code to
the school and reiterate that the
student control we now have is
ours only if we continue to show
that we can accept rsponsihility.)
By JOHN AVERILL
The great moment was the re
sult of a concerted movement in
which thousands of individual
petitions requesting the inaug
uration of the system had been
filed.
NO PUOCTOIUNO
In essence, the act meant that in -
structors would leave the room af
ter issuing the examination papers,
leaving the responsibility to the stu
dents that the test would be carried
out fairly and honorably. Cheating,
if it occurred, was to be reported
to the instructor by the students
along with the name of the violator.
Charges would be heard and tried
by committees composed of and
elected by the students. Judgments
; could be appealed to Ihe President
of the University. The President
would automatically review any
sentence that requested removal
from the school.
SPIRIT <>I SYSTKM
Even so, the honor system wasn't
! accepted as close to heart as hoped.
There seemed to be reticence on the
nart of some students to turn in of
fenders. As early after the Code's
adoption as 1924, an article was
printed in the Daily Palo Alto re
lating that the system had come
under fire. Teachers were turning
in more offenders than were the
students. Of course, it was acknowl
: edged, the instructor had, in a sense,
more opportunity as when ho dis
covered duplicate papers, but the
defenders realized it was near im
possible for cheating to go on and
j some student not know of it. The
article also related how the system
: had been abandoned at the Uni
versity of Illinois after proving im
practifcal, and that it was under
question at Cornell.
Fortunately, however, the spirit
of the system began to slowly per
vade the University, and a collec
tive fondness of its positive objec
tivity began to show aomng the stu
dents. More and more a realization
of its meaning and its value to Stan
-1 ford was felt. As an old alumnus
put it, "We planted the roots deep."

The Honor Code lias always
epitomized Jo me the high per
sonal standards which we always
connect with Stanford. II is the
one material symbol of the fun
damental code of personal con
duct to which all Stanford men
and women adhere. As such, it is
the duty and privilege of all stu
dents to enforce its provisions.
