# Student Travel Abroad Gets Excom's Support
## 
### 
Organization of Ihe Stanford International Survey Committee won unanimous approval by
Excorn last night in a lengthy discussion-packed meeting, the first attended by the newly elected
members.
They voted to rocommcnd to the S.A.C. that Block S cards be granted to the 1943 Rugby
Team, and decided that a recount in the election of Graduate member to Excom was not justified
in view of the past decision that election was legal.

The plans for the Stanford In
ternational Survey Committee
were introduced hy Neil A.len,
! who leads a group of students
who have been working since the
first of the quarter for the official
establishment of a committee that
will act to affiliate Stanford stu
dents wit li students throughout
the world.
Allen was assisted in presenting
the plan hy Bob Hoyt, who has
worked with him during the past
month. Allen was named chairman
of the committee by Excom last
night and Hoyt was made viee
| chairman.
I A number of sub-committees will
j be set up to give the plan a working
i framework. Appointment of these
i students will be made by Allen and
i Hoyt out of the entire student body
! with reports on the group's progress
j to be made to Excom. The Survey
j will officially represent the Stanford
I student body and will be entirely
! financed from student funds.
Excom, at the same time, granted
$150 to the Survey to finance the
trip of a delegate to an interna
tional students' conference to be
held in Chicago during the latter
part of December. Designation of
the delegate will be decided by
Excom at their next meeting.
Excom's decision not to hold a 10
I count on the contested election of
; Roberta Mace as graduate member
; came after much discussion involv
ing faults in the present election
system. This particular election
i was contested last week by Stan
1 Shpetner and other groups as a
means of contesting the entire etec-
I tion results because of failure of
some of the polls to open on time,
and confusion as to where student.;
were to vote.

A special meeting of Exeom
will l»e held Friday afternoon at
3 to decide on whether or not lo
approve the W.A.A.'s proposed
dance concert. Excom will hear
from Joan McDonough, student
manager, on the policy of profit
and underwriting of A.S.S.U.-
sponsored functions in this regard.

In upholding its previous deci
j sion that the election was legal,
Excom did not feel justified in
I calling for a recount in this in
stance inasmuch as Miss Mace
carried the office with as much
strength as other candidates who
j were elected.
After voting to reconsider the
j rugby question, Excom moved to
| recommend to the S.A.C. that the
full privileges of the Block "S"
award be granted to the 194.'} rugby
| team. This action followed three
j weeks' investigation of the prob
! lem, and passed with but one nega
tive vote which v/as cast by Mickey
! Titus.
Titus stated: "A.S.S.U. 194J Ex
com acted in direct opposition to
our constitution which states the
status of a sport should he estab
lished previous to the season.
Thus, as I'M:; Excom acted after
season, this action was unconsti
tutional. This action is not against
the men concerned hut is in sup
port of a strong constitution.
Passing this motion would mean
that last spring's 1946 rugb\ team
would he likewise entitled to
lilock 'S' awards."
AI Forbes, chairman of the Honor
j Code Committee, submitted in writ
J iny a plan of the activities which the
! committee is undertaking this quar
| ter and has planned for next quar
j tor. Plans include messages to the
j faculty, articles in the Daily, poi
! crs, and talks to students.
In an effort to bring the Honor
Code problem more forcibly before
the student body, Exeom declared
il elf in itself in favor of third pari'
student action in warning an of
fender, and then turning in the vio
■ lator.
Exeom also approved the charter
jof the Stanford Graduate Chapter
! of Junior Statesmen of America, and
the Portuguese Club.
