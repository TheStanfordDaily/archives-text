## Feathers Shmeathers! 
### 
When $1,100 is all 7,000 Stanford students
can contribute in two days to an all-purpose
relief drive, we must conclude that they have
come scurrying back to the Quad for refuge
in the nearest Ivory Tower.
World Students Service Fund, Infantile
Paralysis Fund, Community Fund, and a float
ing fund for emergency relief drives are the
foui agencies being covered by the S2 you
give to the Four Feathers Relief Drive. That
makes 50 conts apiece, which isn't much to

ask of our relatively bulging pockets.
Even the $14,000 goal that drive chairmen
must reach by tomorrow afternoon looks
pretty small in comparison with the millions
necessary to treat adeguately the needs of
those who will benefit by your contributions.
So the next time you pull your hand out of
your pocket, pull out a couple of bucks along
with it and give them to your drive collector
or plunk them down on the nearest collecting
booth. Believe us, it won't hurt.â€”M.S.
