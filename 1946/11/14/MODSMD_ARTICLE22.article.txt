# Down with the Eager Ones
## 
### 
There is a growing tendency on this cam
pus which we think is one of the poorest
things of all times. What v/e mean is this busi
ness of making dates a full week in advance
and often sooner. It's getting so that engage
ments for one week-end are made during the
preceding one. The result is that anyone who
wait:: until Monday to start asking is just out
of luck!
We understand that this is not a one-sided
complaint. That is, there are just as many
women as men who object to this trend. How
over, there is a certain weak-kneed per cent
that is fouling the situation up.

The time has come, therefore, to trip up
some of these eager beavers. This then is a
call for the strong to make a stand against this
mal-practice. Something's gotta be done.
On this platform we will stand or fall:
Men: No asking for dates before Monday
evening.
Women: No accepting dates until Monday
evening.
Everybody: No cheating.
Daters of the Farm unite! You have nothing
to lose but your temporary gains!- Jack Og
lesby.
