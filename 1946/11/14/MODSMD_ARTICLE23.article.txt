11 w<• should apply to your first-night review of
"Macbeth" the same professional standards that the
reviewer r -quires of student actors, his performance
is at least as inadequate as theirs.
It was easy enough to find flaws in the individual
readings, but the effect of the production as a whole
.seemed to many to be quite powerful. Mr. Moore's
judgment on the matter may well be superior, but
il i .1 matter to which, judging from his review, he
gave no consideration at all.
There are many things involved in any stage pro
duction besides acting, although word and body
movement arc oi course the most important. Can
your reviewer find nothing at all to praise in the
staging and costuming? Henry Holt's music was un
obtrusive, as it should be, but was it so unobtrusive
as to be completely unnoticed by our critic?

Orchids to Mr. Moore for his completely legiti
mate exasperation with (he bobby-sox audience.
Even there, however, those of u.s who have returned
to college a bit beyond the normal college age may
be accused of intolerance. Maybe we too once were
as silly as the average Stanford lower division group.
Could be.

Unfortunately, there was not enough space al
lotted to enable me to say all I would have liked to
say. I did enjoy the production because it was
Shakespeare on the stage where he belongs and be
cause it was "Macbeth" which I like.
But my enjoyment was in spite of the many
shortcomings and was not based on critical standards
adequate enough to warrant a statement of it ap
pearing in print.—George Moore
