QUARTERLY LETTER HOME
Fall, 194G
Dear Folks:
In case you are worried—l arrived here safely,
selling the mule and kyacks to the Union Public
Dining Room—"as a publicity gag," they said.
Now that the rains have started, the Drofnats
branch of Architects Anonymous is drafting plans
for the War Memorial Gambling Ship on Lake La
gunita. They're getting campus support through
;i series of drives. The first one is called Four Feath
ers; the one n .'Xt quarter is Three Roses. You'd
better burn this communique as everything is very
hush-hush. Shhh — it's a surprise for Dean Stalnaker
shhh. He is sure we want a new Union or post
office. Will he be tickled!
Bawled Ups came out last week. I found that
Conquests Nos. 1 through 9 (inclusive) are married;
No. 10 is down to Irt's last convertible. So that leaves
me with Conquest No. 11. He's the one that lives in

a tree house on Palm Drive. The authorities couldn't
decide whether he lived on or oft campus, so they
issued his bike a cardinal red parking sticker with
Buy Meadows brown polka dots. Well, at least he's
interesting—l found that out reading the ads. May
be you've seen them: "57 is such an interesting age."
Thanks so much for the African violets. It was
such a thoughtful birthday present. Every time a
leaf falls off a whole new plant sprouts up —grows on
wood, coke bottles, rugs, ashes, clothes, everything.
My room is certainly colorful. Of course, that doesn't
help my allergy, but the Health Service says you can
get used to almost anything.
Hope you don't mind my sending this letter col
lect but I've run out of those home-addressed
stamped post cards you gave me when I came here
as a freshman in '38. And also we're saving money
for the Sunday Movie Series. We go every quarter
to see "Prisoner of Zenda.",
If you don't hear from me again it's because I'm
concentrating on my education: seven books, three
t 'rm papers, makeups, incompletes, and two late
midterms to go. But don't worry—l have till Mon
day. Anyway, I have it .all figured out. If I get
straight A s on my finals, I can bring my average up
to a C.
Your ever-loving
Sis

me with Conquest No. 11. He's the one that lives in

a tree house on Palm Drive. The authorities couldn't
decide whether he lived on or oft campus, so they
issued his bike a cardinal red parking sticker with
Buy Meadows brown polka dots. Well, at least he's
interesting—l found that out reading the ads. May
be you've seen them: "57 is such an interesting age."
Thanks so much for the African violets. It was
such a thoughtful birthday present. Every time a
leaf falls off a whole new plant sprouts up —grows on
wood, coke bottles, rugs, ashes, clothes, everything.
My room is certainly colorful. Of course, that doesn't
help my allergy, but the Health Service says you can
get used to almost anything.
Hope you don't mind my sending this letter col
lect but I've run out of those home-addressed
stamped post cards you gave me when I came here
as a freshman in '38. And also we're saving money
for the Sunday Movie Series. We go every quarter
to see "Prisoner of Zenda.",
If you don't hear from me again it's because I'm
concentrating on my education: seven books, three
t 'rm papers, makeups, incompletes, and two late
midterms to go. But don't worry—l have till Mon
day. Anyway, I have it .all figured out. If I get
straight A s on my finals, I can bring my average up
to a C.
Your ever-loving
Sis

QUARTERLY LETTER HOME
Fall, 194G
Dear Folks:
In case you are worried—l arrived here safely,
selling the mule and kyacks to the Union Public
Dining Room—"as a publicity gag," they said.
Now that the rains have started, the Drofnats
branch of Architects Anonymous is drafting plans
for the War Memorial Gambling Ship on Lake La
gunita. They're getting campus support through
;i series of drives. The first one is called Four Feath
ers; the one n .'Xt quarter is Three Roses. You'd
better burn this communique as everything is very
hush-hush. Shhh — it's a surprise for Dean Stalnaker
shhh. He is sure we want a new Union or post
office. Will he be tickled!
Bawled Ups came out last week. I found that
Conquests Nos. 1 through 9 (inclusive) are married;
No. 10 is down to Irt's last convertible. So that leaves
me with Conquest No. 11. He's the one that lives in

a tree house on Palm Drive. The authorities couldn't
decide whether he lived on or oft campus, so they
issued his bike a cardinal red parking sticker with
Buy Meadows brown polka dots. Well, at least he's
interesting—l found that out reading the ads. May
