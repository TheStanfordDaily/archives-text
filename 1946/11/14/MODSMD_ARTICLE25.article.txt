PUZZLE FOlt FOOLS: PALESTINE
For us in the wide open spaces it is hard to under
tand why there should be so much trouble in a
little country like Palestine. Fifteen Palestines would
fii comfortably into California, yet the citadel of the
cross, the half-moon and the star of David has seen
more violence recently than the Wild West in its
wildest days.
Wc read of bridges being blown up, air-fields at
tacked, bombs thrown into hotels and banks. We
hear of rigidly enforced curfews, see pictures of
British soldiers patrolling with tommyguns. We see
rvwsreels of refugees, fresh from the concentration
camps of Germany and Poland, herded into English
concentration camps on Cyprus because they wanted
to come to Palestine.
Why should three groups of people clash so des
perately over that small strip of land, neither rich
in natural resources nor especially fertile?
To thousands of Jews it is the country where to
find peace and a new life—a life without storm
troopers, Gestapo, pogroms, extermination camps.
These are the people who own nothing, have no
homes; no country wants them—only in Palestine,
the land of their ancestors, do they see a future.
The Arabs aren't too happy about this. They
don't see why the Jews after 2.000 years should have
the right to come back and kick them out. While
Joe Q. Arab knows little about politics and usually
cares less, his shrewd leaders want the Middle East
for Arabians only.
Between these two sides the British tread the
perilous path of imperialism. In its 1946 version
this amounts to having your cake and eating it.
Thev want to hang on to Palestine, mainlv for stra-

tegic reasons centered on oil without which the Em
pire cannot run. An important oil line goes through
Palestine. The English figure that if they don't con
trol the country some other big nation will, endan
gering supply of this vital fuel.
At the same time both Arabs and Jews must be
kept fairly content since conditions do not permit
outright suppression as in other colonies. It's all
right, apparently, for Moslems and Hindus to slaugh
ter each other in India, but too much shooting in
Palestine might blow up the works.
The British have clamped down severely on Jewish
immigration, deporting all illegal immigrants to the
island of Cyprus. This pleases the Arabs, but makes
the Jews mad (activities of the Jewish underground
are beginning to approach guerilla warfare).
London's plan for partitioning the country into
quasi-independent zones (with England retaining
considerable control) has so far pleased neither the
Arabs nor the Jews.
To make things worse Bevin & Co. have been
highly reluctant to let U.N. attempt a settlement.
This is remarkable in view of the fact that Palestine
is a League of Nations mandate, making it the re
sponsibility of the United Nations to determine its
status.
There is no easy solution. U.N. might reduce the
violence somewhat, but in these days of power
politics where most nations are out to grab what
the# can Palestine will probably continue to be a
headache for diplomats, a promised land for Jews,
and a threat to sovereignty for Arabs. In a world
of nations fighting for power we can hardly expect
peace.

Why should three groups of people clash so des

To thousands of Jews it is the country where to
find peace and a new life—a life without storm
troopers, Gestapo, pogroms, extermination camps.
These are the people who own nothing, have no
homes; no country wants them—only in Palestine,
the land of their ancestors, do they see a future.
The Arabs aren't too happy about this. They
don't see why the Jews after 2.000 years should have
the right to come back and kick them out. While
Joe Q. Arab knows little about politics and usually
cares less, his shrewd leaders want the Middle East
for Arabians only.
Between these two sides the British tread the

this amounts to having your cake and eating it.
Thev want to hang on to Palestine, mainlv for stra-

tegic reasons centered on oil without which the Em

Palestine. The English figure that if they don't con

At the same time both Arabs and Jews must be
kept fairly content since conditions do not permit
outright suppression as in other colonies. It's all
right, apparently, for Moslems and Hindus to slaugh

Palestine might blow up the works.
The British have clamped down severely on Jewish
immigration, deporting all illegal immigrants to the
island of Cyprus. This pleases the Arabs, but makes
the Jews mad (activities of the Jewish underground
are beginning to approach guerilla warfare).
London's plan for partitioning the country into
quasi-independent zones (with England retaining
considerable control) has so far pleased neither the
Arabs nor the Jews.
To make things worse Bevin & Co. have been
highly reluctant to let U.N. attempt a settlement.
This is remarkable in view of the fact that Palestine
is a League of Nations mandate, making it the re
sponsibility of the United Nations to determine its
status.
There is no easy solution. U.N. might reduce the
violence somewhat, but in these days of power
politics where most nations are out to grab what
the# can Palestine will probably continue to be a
headache for diplomats, a promised land for Jews,
and a threat to sovereignty for Arabs. In a world
of nations fighting for power we can hardly expect
peace.
PUZZLE FOlt FOOLS: PALESTINE
For us in the wide open spaces it is hard to under
tand why there should be so much trouble in a
little country like Palestine. Fifteen Palestines would
fii comfortably into California, yet the citadel of the
cross, the half-moon and the star of David has seen
more violence recently than the Wild West in its
wildest days.
