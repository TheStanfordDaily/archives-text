# Today's Police Far Cry From One-Man Beginning
## 
### JACK DAVIES 
Off in a remote corner of the Corporation Yard is a small office to
which many a dejected Stanfordite treks, parking tag in hand.
From here stems the network of the Stanford University police force,
; a unit which, through the years, has protected the Farm against many a
| Cal intrusion and guided the Indians over countless warpaths.

Back in If 10-12 Stanford's guard
ian was a single man coming on
| duty each night. This officer, a
I deputy sheriff, supervised the sev
j era! watchmen scattered over re-
I mote sections of the Farm. About
| that time it was common for "the
force" to make its tours on horse
back. Doubtless their main concern
i was keeping some rough's "surrey
with the fringe on top" from getting
bogged down in the Cactus Garden.
ENLARGES TO II
Later steps enlarged the depart
i ment to include additional deputies
j on the state payroll who patrolled
the campus on assigned days. As
j the flow of Maxwells increased, it
j became necessary to hire a full—
j time day officer l'oi traffic duties.
A far try from these early ef
forts is today's compact, efficient
organization. Through 24 hours
of the day Gordy Davis, Stan
ford's present police chief, directs
the work of an 11-man force cov
ering the campus proper as well
as Stanford Village.
Two patrol cars and a motorcycle
! maintain constant check on traffic
j and security of persons and prop
!ci ty. Both patrol cars have two-
I way radio linking them into local
and statewide law enforcement net
works. Close liaison is fostered with
j the Palo Alto authorities.
ADDS GLAMOUR
Glamour has not been the share
| of this campus agency. Through the
years, the most stirring pages of lo
cal police history have been written
by Cal men attempting to interrupt
the solace of-Hhe Quad. According
to Mr. Davis, the return of the Axe
j earlier this quarter was likely the
j greatest special event in the annals
of the campus force.
From his earliest days at Stan
ford, back in 15)30, right up through
j present happenings, Mr. Davis re
j marks that he is "highly impressed
with the spirit of co-operation"
I found among Stanford men and
women.
In talking with other officers of
the force, this reporter found the
i same reaction among them all.
According to one, "the hoys know
when they are wrong and under
stand that we are trying to regu
late things for the best interests
i of everyone."
