JERUSALEM. Nov. 13 (UP).â€” Six
policemen were killed, at least 10
were wounded and other casualties
were caused today by mine blasts
here, at Tel Aviv, and on an inter
urban line between Jerusalem and
Jaffa.
As a result the government to
night suspended indefinitely all
railroad traffic between Jerusalem
and Jaffa because of the danger of
sabotage. Previously night trains
had been suspended.
