# Bad Weather Good News For Invading Cougars
## 
### 
The weatherman gave Washington States' hopes a shot in the
arm!
The Cougars thrive in the mud, are not a bit upset about the
prospects of rain and mud for their clash with Marchie Schwartz'
Indians in the Stadium Saturday.

Coach Marchie called off yester
day's practice early yesterday when
it got a little too wet, but the Big
Tied Machine will be back to its
I'reen-fenced workshop today. Chief
mechanic Marchie has a lot of work
!o do on the ol' buggy to get it in
s>ood running order before Saturday.
The Varsity will work out against
the first-string Jayvees again today,
with the stress on passing.
Phil Sorboe's Cougars have had
a dismal year, they would like
nothing better than getting back in
to the win column at Stanford's ex
pense. The only bright spot of the
VVSC season is a 32-0 win over the
hapless Idaho Vandals (everybody
beats Idaho!) and a scoreless tie
with Tex Oliver's Oregon Ducks.
In the season's opener the boys
from Pullman surprised everybody
by holding the highly rated SC Tro
jans to a 13-7 win, but as we found
out the Trojans were in an early
season slump. Against their cross
state rivals, the Washington Hus
kies—l mean Shaggy Dogs—they lost
L'l-7. The following week the Cou
gars were nosed out by Oregon
State 13-12. and two weeks ago at
Berkeley fell apart at the seams
against Cal, losing 47-14.
But Sorboe has had two -weeks to
overhaul his outfit, and reports from
Pullman tell us that the Cougars
will be at full strength for the first
time in four weeks. Back in uniform
far the first time will be dangerous
fullback Dick Abrams, center Andy
Lazor, tackle Elmo Bond, and end
Francis Lacoka.
