# Bidault Urges Swift Action
## 
### 
PARIS. Nov. 13 (UP).â€”Premier
Georges Bidault, in a surprise move,
has urged that a permanent govern
ment for the new Fourth Republic
be established immediately after the
First meeting of the National Assem
bly Nov. 28, instead of awaiting
election of a French president, it
was reported today.
Bidault was said to favor swift
creation of a permanent cabinet on
the grounds that many foreign and
domestic questions, including sta
bilization of the tottering franc,
were too serious to await the two
months' delay necessary for elect
ing a Council of the Republic and
a president.
Taking concrete action to back
up the proposal, Bidault's cabinet,
at its first meeting since the Com
munist victory in last Sunday's
elections, voted today to resign en
masse when the Assembly convenes.
