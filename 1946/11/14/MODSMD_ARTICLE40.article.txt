# Indian Water Poloists Submerge San Jose, 9-5
## 
### BOB BULLOCK 
Despite the inclement weather
that threatened to postpone the
game, Stanford's water polo team
ground out a hard-fought 9-5 vic
tory over San Jose in the local pool
yesterday afternoon. Confusion
reigned during the last half of the
water battle as the contest was com
pleted in a slight drizzle, with dark
ness necessitating use of the pool's
overhead lights.
The final score does not complete
ly indicate how decisively the visit
ing Spartans were beaten. Again
the red-hot Indian starting lineup
was given a well-earned rest in the
later stages of the game. With Stan
ford leading 7-3 at the beginning of
the last quarter, Coaches Tom Hay
nie and Ernie Brandsten inserted
practically an entire new team.
SEVENTH WIN
But the San Jose* mermen could
do nothing with the second string
either, and the Indians upped their
advantage to 9-3 before the Spar
tans could retaliate. Two last-min*
lite markers narrowed the margin
to a respectable four-point margin
just as time ran out. The Indians
came out of the pool with their sev
enth straight triumph, only one de
feat blotting their record for the
entire season.
Speed again figured in the Stan
ford victory as every sprint to cen
ter pool after a score went to the
amazing Tribe until far into the last
quarter. Thus the Indians gained
ball control on every succession of
plays and so were on the offense
during a major part of the game.
Meanwhile, the Spartans were be
wildered by the blinding speed
which carried the Indians to point
after point.
CARPENTER STARS
The four important points of vie

j lory were piled up at the offset of
; the game before the Spartans could
i solve the sparkling defense of 13ud
Carpenter, Indian goalie. But with
Stanford leading 4-0 at the begin
ning of the second quarter, San Jose
came to lile and played on equal
terms with the Tribe from then on.
Ed RudollT buoyed Spartan hopes
in a single-handed effort which pro
duced four markers, high for the
afternoon. But the well-co-ordi
nated Indian offense split the scor
ing between five men. Harry Bor
chers. Stanford sprint star, and Jack
Carpenter, who led the Indians in
the second half, each contributed
three points to the Stanford score.
PLAY BRUINS FRIDAY
One point apiece was chalked up
by Jim Armstrong, Walter Lull, and
Emmett Cnshin. Incidentally. Arm
strong's bucket was a terrific shot
from a difficult angle which as
tounded the small audience. Other
Indians who saw action in the con
test are Don Hester, Pete Hatch,
Dick Narver, A 1 Weeden, Sil On
esti. Bill Ernst, and Bill Rule.
The Indians will return to league
hction Friday afternoon in the local
pool against the UCLA Bruins. Ac
tion is slated to get under way at
4:15.

Despite the inclement weather
that threatened to postpone the
game, Stanford's water polo team
ground out a hard-fought 9-5 vic
tory over San Jose in the local pool
yesterday afternoon. Confusion
reigned during the last half of the
water battle as the contest was com
pleted in a slight drizzle, with dark
ness necessitating use of the pool's
overhead lights.
The final score does not complete
ly indicate how decisively the visit
ing Spartans were beaten. Again
the red-hot Indian starting lineup
was given a well-earned rest in the
later stages of the game. With Stan
ford leading 7-3 at the beginning of
the last quarter, Coaches Tom Hay
nie and Ernie Brandsten inserted
practically an entire new team.
SEVENTH WIN
But the San Jose* mermen could
do nothing with the second string
either, and the Indians upped their
advantage to 9-3 before the Spar
tans could retaliate. Two last-min*
lite markers narrowed the margin
to a respectable four-point margin
just as time ran out. The Indians
came out of the pool with their sev
enth straight triumph, only one de
feat blotting their record for the
entire season.
Speed again figured in the Stan
ford victory as every sprint to cen
ter pool after a score went to the
amazing Tribe until far into the last
quarter. Thus the Indians gained
ball control on every succession of
plays and so were on the offense
during a major part of the game.
Meanwhile, the Spartans were be
wildered by the blinding speed
which carried the Indians to point
after point.
CARPENTER STARS
The four important points of vie

j lory were piled up at the offset of
; the game before the Spartans could
i solve the sparkling defense of 13ud
Carpenter, Indian goalie. But with
Stanford leading 4-0 at the begin
ning of the second quarter, San Jose
came to lile and played on equal
terms with the Tribe from then on.
Ed RudollT buoyed Spartan hopes
in a single-handed effort which pro
duced four markers, high for the
afternoon. But the well-co-ordi
nated Indian offense split the scor
ing between five men. Harry Bor
chers. Stanford sprint star, and Jack
Carpenter, who led the Indians in
the second half, each contributed
three points to the Stanford score.
PLAY BRUINS FRIDAY
One point apiece was chalked up
by Jim Armstrong, Walter Lull, and
Emmett Cnshin. Incidentally. Arm
strong's bucket was a terrific shot
from a difficult angle which as
tounded the small audience. Other
Indians who saw action in the con
test are Don Hester, Pete Hatch,
Dick Narver, A 1 Weeden, Sil On
esti. Bill Ernst, and Bill Rule.
