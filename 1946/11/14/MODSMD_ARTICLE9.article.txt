# Floats Due On Friday
## 
### 
Sign-ups for the Big Game floats
have been very slow, especially
from women's How houses, fraterni
ties, and the Village, according to
Cardinal Ann Lilienthal. She has
asked that all groups planning to
enter floats in the parade do so as
soon as possible, as tomorrow is the
deadline.
Miss Lilienthal also announced
that if halls or houses wanted to
combine their efforts and ideas, the
float would be judged, but only un
der the name of one living group,
and only one prize would be given.
Prizes to be awarded for the win
ning floats will be on display in the
Cellar from next Monday until the;
parade.
Cardinals expects the parade and
the floats to be as elaborate as the
Homecoming at U.C.L.A., with such
names submitted for floats as "Mer
ry-Go-Round" and "Big Red Ma
chine." *
Ideas are to be turned in to the
A.S.S.U. ofiiec between !) and 5 to
day and tomorrow.
