# G.O.P. Maps Tax Cut, Cud Of Controls
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 (UP).
House Republican leaders
agreed tonight on an eight-point
legislative program calling for
a 20 per cent cut in across-the
board" personal income taxes,
elimination of all federal wartime
emergency controls, and a balanced
national budget.
The decision was reached by mem
bers of the House Republican steer
ing committee who also voted to sup
port legislation to limit future presi
dential terms to eight years. The
late President Roosevelt was elected
lo four terms of four years each.
Rep. Joseph W. Martin, Jr., of
Massachusetts, slated to be House
speaker when the 80th Congress con
venes next Jan. 3, announced the
results of the steering committee's
discussions almost simultaneously
with a similar announcement by
Sen. Robert A. Taft, of Ohio, on the
outcome of today's. Senate Republi
can steering committee meeting.
Both groups are scheduled to con
fer in joint session tomorrow.
Taft, prominent contender for
Ihe I!MX CiOP presidential nomina
lion, announced that his group also
discussed taxes and the federal
. budget. He expressed personal
agreement with his House collea
gues that individual income taxes
could be cut. And he added his
belief that the budget could he
reduced to $30,000,000,000 next
year.
Both House and Senate groups ap
pealed to have steered clear of party
disputes over leadership. Taft said
he hadn't decided whether he wants
the post of Senate leader. Martin
said his House group held aloof from
the contest for House leadership now
raging among Reps. Charles A. Hal
lcck, of Indiana, and Thomas A. Jen
kins and Clarence J. Brown, both of
Ohio.
The group also announced these
major actions at its morning and af
ternoon sessions:
APPROPRIATIONS—
Rep. John Taber, of New York,
who will be the new House appro- 1
priations committee chairman, out- j
lined plans to scrutinize thoroughly !
all federal bureau requests for funds. 1
Replying to criticism that its pro !
gram would mean drastic cuts in na-
tional defense outlays, the commit
tee announced:
"National defense will be ade
quately provided for, but new appro
priations will be trimmed to meet
the necessary obligations of the gov
ernment."
An "across-the-board" cut, it said,
"will operate to diminish by 20 per
cent the amount of withholding taxes
which now cuts into the pay enve
lope before the recipient receives it."
FEDERAL CONTROLS—
The President's war powers must
be "terminated as fast as consistent
with wisdom, and the powers be
longing under the constitution to the
states returned to them."
HOUSING—
The banking and currency com
mittee will undertake "intensive"
studies to find ways to "eliminate
restraints now holding up proper
progress."
LABOR—
"The committee was in full agree
ment that labor legislation which will
be constructive, but emphatically not
punitive, is an early necessity in the
80th Congress. The first considera
tion must be the welfare of the whole
nation which will necessarily em
brace the welfare of both labor and
management."
FOOD SHORTAGES—
The Republican i'ood study com
mittee will continue its inquiry into
ways of relieving shortages of sugar,
soaps, fats, and oils.
The Senate committee, through
Taft, announced that it wasn't trying
to write a GOP program for the new
Congress, but merely was trying to
explore some of the important prob
lems that may arise in the next two
years of Republican legislative-
Democratic executive rule.

lems that may arise in the next two
years of Republican legislative-

WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 (UP).
House Republican leaders
agreed tonight on an eight-point
legislative program calling for
a 20 per cent cut in across-the
board" personal income taxes,
elimination of all federal wartime
emergency controls, and a balanced
national budget.
The decision was reached by mem
bers of the House Republican steer
ing committee who also voted to sup
port legislation to limit future presi
dential terms to eight years. The
late President Roosevelt was elected
lo four terms of four years each.
Rep. Joseph W. Martin, Jr., of
Massachusetts, slated to be House
speaker when the 80th Congress con
venes next Jan. 3, announced the
results of the steering committee's
discussions almost simultaneously
with a similar announcement by
Sen. Robert A. Taft, of Ohio, on the
outcome of today's. Senate Republi
can steering committee meeting.
Both groups are scheduled to con
fer in joint session tomorrow.
Taft, prominent contender for
Ihe I!MX CiOP presidential nomina
lion, announced that his group also
discussed taxes and the federal
. budget. He expressed personal
agreement with his House collea
gues that individual income taxes
could be cut. And he added his
belief that the budget could he
reduced to $30,000,000,000 next
year.
Both House and Senate groups ap
pealed to have steered clear of party
disputes over leadership. Taft said
he hadn't decided whether he wants
the post of Senate leader. Martin
said his House group held aloof from
the contest for House leadership now
raging among Reps. Charles A. Hal
lcck, of Indiana, and Thomas A. Jen
kins and Clarence J. Brown, both of
Ohio.
The group also announced these
major actions at its morning and af
ternoon sessions:
APPROPRIATIONS—
Rep. John Taber, of New York,
who will be the new House appro- 1
priations committee chairman, out- j
lined plans to scrutinize thoroughly !
all federal bureau requests for funds. 1
Replying to criticism that its pro !
gram would mean drastic cuts in na-
tional defense outlays, the commit
tee announced:
"National defense will be ade
quately provided for, but new appro
priations will be trimmed to meet
the necessary obligations of the gov
ernment."
An "across-the-board" cut, it said,
"will operate to diminish by 20 per
cent the amount of withholding taxes
which now cuts into the pay enve
lope before the recipient receives it."
FEDERAL CONTROLS—
The President's war powers must
be "terminated as fast as consistent
with wisdom, and the powers be
longing under the constitution to the
states returned to them."

mittee will undertake "intensive"
