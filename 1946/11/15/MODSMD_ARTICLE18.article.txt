# Student Control Based on Honor System
## 
### JOHN AVERILL 
(Previous to 1920 only a limited
form of student government and
responsibility was evident at
Stanford. In 1921. however, an
honor system for examinations
for the entire University was put
into effect, the spirit of which, al
though regarded skeptically at
lirst. began slowly to pervade the
University.
(The daily herewith presents the
last of four articles explaining the
history of the Honor Code in an
attempt to show the importance
of the code to the school and to
reaffirm that current student con
trol will remain ours only if we
continue to show that we can ac
cept student responsibility.—The
Editor)

With the Code becoming en-

trenched within the classroom, the
results soon carried over to the out
side to be embodied in th? now fa
mous "Fundamental Standard.
Phrased by Dr. Jordan, the
"Standard reads 111 part:
"Students are expected to show
both within and without the Uni
versity such respect for order,
morality, personal honor, and the
lights of others, as is demanded of
good citizens. , . .
"A spirit of equality must be
maintained within the University.
To this end we commend and will
uphold the University authorities in
prohibition of excessive expendi
tures and other excesses on the part
of students, and the formation or
growth of any organization, custom,
or social function that tends to the
development of exclusive or un
democratic castes within the Uni

versity and to exclude from the in
stitution anyone whose conduct is
inconsistent with the spirit ex
pressed by the founders.
"All cases of conduct unbecom
ing a Stanford student are sub
ject (o the disciplinary action of
the appropriate Council for Stu
dent Control."
Thus the tradition grew and be
came as much "Stanford" as the
Quad itself. On the system's suc
cess Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, pres
ent Chancellor, stated:
"The Honor System worked be
cause it was a system with a sys
tem. The Code would have failed it
the initiative had not been placed
on the student. Within the result
ing development of mental charac
ter lies the system's strength."
Dr. Wl.bur is one of the lirst
to admit that the system has not

always functioned at its potential, j
Strong leaders are necessary for |
its operation, hag periods result j
when these leaders leave school,
the recent war being an example.
The spirit of the Code can also
he diminished. This has happened
many times, through national
stress or emergency, through at
tack and ridicule by cynics, but
mostly through the attempts by
ovcrzcalous students to stretch the
provisions of the Code to absurd
lengths. Such Quixotism, declares
Dr. Wilbur, arouses a .conflict
among the student body that
harms the whole system.
The tost still lies in the future, |
but then as now. the Code will '
stand as: ". . . a means for the
student to fulfill the trust of the
administration and to express his j
own honesty and integrity."

Thus the tradition grew and be
came as much "Stanford" as the

cess Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, pres
ent Chancellor, stated:
"The Honor System worked be
cause it was a system with a sys
tem. The Code would have failed it
the initiative had not been placed
on the student. Within the result
ing development of mental charac
ter lies the system's strength."
Dr. Wl.bur is one of the lirst
to admit that the system has not

always functioned at its potential, j
Strong leaders are necessary for |
its operation, hag periods result j
when these leaders leave school,
the recent war being an example.
The spirit of the Code can also
he diminished. This has happened
many times, through national
stress or emergency, through at
tack and ridicule by cynics, but
mostly through the attempts by
ovcrzcalous students to stretch the
provisions of the Code to absurd
lengths. Such Quixotism, declares
Dr. Wilbur, arouses a .conflict
among the student body that
harms the whole system.
The tost still lies in the future, |
but then as now. the Code will '
stand as: ". . . a means for the
student to fulfill the trust of the
administration and to express his j
own honesty and integrity."
(Previous to 1920 only a limited
form of student government and
responsibility was evident at
Stanford. In 1921. however, an
honor system for examinations
for the entire University was put
into effect, the spirit of which, al
though regarded skeptically at
lirst. began slowly to pervade the
University.
