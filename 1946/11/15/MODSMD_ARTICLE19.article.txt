# Excom Debates Profit Policy
## 
### 
W.A.A.'s proposed dance con
cert, which involves the policy of
profit and underwriting of A.S.S.U.-
sponsored functions, will be decided
today by Excotn in a special meet
ing at the Nitery at 3 p.m.
WA. originally proposed to fi
nanc ally sponsor the concert with
the understanding that they receive
the profits from it. Dean John Stal
naker, in a lettci to W.A.A. giving
approval for the concert, stated:
"Jt is felt that the management
of (he concert should be the re
sponsibility of the Committee on
Public Exorcises, with Orchesis as
the sponsor; in other words, we
to do the work and Orchesis to
gel the credit line. Any proceeds
from the concert will be deposited
to the account of the University."
Excom will hear from Joan Mc-
Donough, student manager, and re
view both sides of the question in
an attempt to set a policy for such
functions.
