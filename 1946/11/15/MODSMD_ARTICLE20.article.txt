An A.S.S.U. Publicity Committee
which would bring order out of the
publicity chaos and a more inten

now under consideration by Excom.
Bill Eilers, in presenting the plan
at last Wednesday night's Excom
meeting, told the members that a
publicity committee would more ad
equately publicize campus events
and nive more accurate information
to the public.
Excom tabled the proposal for
further discussion.
Campus plays, all-campus dances,
drives, meetings, and special events
would receive co-ordinated, inten
sive publicity by the committee.
lie explained that the committee
would use Daily coverage, posters,
and the newly approved campus ra
dio station in its publicity efforts.
The current "Four Feathers"
drive could be publicized by the
proposed committee through the of
fice of the Director of Information,
he added.
A director of publicity would head
the committee. A secretary, news
writer, radio writer, and a poster and
.si«n expert — all students — would
serve on the committee and head
separate staffs, Eilers explained.
