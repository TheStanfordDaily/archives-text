# One-Acts Score, Reviewer Says

### 
Stanford's Studio Theater banned
out three Hits last night in their first
production of three one-art plays,
all by Stanford playwrights.
All three plays —"The Enemy,"
"Papa Traverses," and "Rehabilita
tion"—were successes. ''Rehabilita
tion" by Glen Haley look top hon
ors. and superior performances by
Ruth Fisher, Harold Todd, and Don
ald Liggett helped the fine vehicle
along.
Direction of "Rehabilitation"
was by Julio Franccscutto and
was naturalistic, well- <med. and
sin'toth. All players were allowed
full characterization.
"Papa Traverses," written by
Newton Arnold, was a light, but
funny comedy about Shakespeare.
Although there were a few eggs
laid, most of the play was originally
funny. Margaret Cox as Julia was
.superior.
Milton Valentine's "The Enemy"
was a too-familiar topic to veter
ans, that of the overbearing non
com, but its morals sometimes ran
away with its action. The character
of the Prof, while well acted, wa
little more than a talking textbok
(as some professors are).
While final action of the pla.\
may conceivably have occurred,
its plau.sibf.ity is doubtful. That
murder should go unpunished
even in the Army is hard to be
lieve.—lleintzc
