## Honor Code—Vital Test 
### 
'"Ihe honor code is in a serious position.
If it does not work, it must be abandoned,"
said Martin Anderson, ASSU President at
Wednesday night's Excom meeting. There
is no dcyibt that the Code is facing another,
and possible most severe, test since its in
ception.
Many of Stanford's veterans have seen
"honor codes" openly flouted in Officer Candi
date Schools, Cadet Schools, and other service
schools, and have lost faith in any honor sys
tem. A.id the tremendous number of new
sLudenLs ihio year made it impossible to have
the careful indoctrination in the Code usually
given at time of entrance. Others say that
they will not be a Gestapo to report to their
friends.
Some argue that application of the Code to
all branches of academic work—lab reports,
home problems, etc. . . . draws too fine a
line. But these persons are actually begging
the main question. Recognizing this situation,
most professors base only a small portion of
the quarterly grade on home work, establish
methods of preventing duplicating home work,
or encourage mutual assistance. Here, there
is no general rule, the individual teacher
draws the line.
Fundamental to the code is conduct during
tests, ihe major grade determinants. Those
who have been in proctored classes where
cheating is a battle of wits between teacher
and student and the teacher is forced into the
role of detective have no resire to return to
thai situation.
The Stanford Honor Code was born of
struggle by students who felt that at college
age they v/ere mature enough to establish

their own code of honor. The struggle was
not an easy one, as those who have read John
Averill's feature story for the past four days
well know, and the struggle is not yet won.
It is never won until every Stanford student
makes the Honor Code the touchstone of his
campus existence.
Signing the pledge on Registration Day
was not just another registration formality, we
v/ere pledging to uphold the Stanford Honor
Code unequivocally. If you believe it was a
formality, or a statement signed under duress
and therefore not binding, you have no place
at Stanford. You have no right to destroy the
fought-for rights of the majority.
We of Stanford must feel the existence of
the code as the foundation of all student ac
tivity, of our own personal and academic
freedom. This applies not only to our personal
conduct but to enforcement of the code in re
gard to others. This "third person responsi
bility" bears no relation to childhood "tattling"
or to a "Gestapo" but is a mature recognition
of individual responsibility to prevent the de
structive activity of an unregenerate minority.
There can be no equivocation.
This week marks the beginning of a cam
paign by the Honor Code Committee assisted
by the Daily to make every student realize the
necessity for a synthesis of his own personal
honor with Stanford honor as delineated in
the Code.
In this, one of its greatest tests, it is neces
sary to have a re-awakening of the entire stu
dent body, a re-affirmation by everyone of us
of our belief in the principles of the Code. It
is absolutely essential to the survival of the
proudest tradition of Stanford life.—F.B.
