To the Editor:
A distinguished San Frimcisco woman, whose
Stanford son was lost in the war, is just back from
Europe, from a trip with other American volunteers
and professional women to see what American Girl
Scout. 1 could dn to help their small European sisters
toward a strong and normal maturity. She says the
older women, the women whose wisdom and courage
must help their own youngsters in the program, are
: o tired, so worn, so discouraged. They are just
alj 1 o to live through the day, through the week. They
can't yet summon strength to build the future for
their children.
Europe's youth—the opposite numbers of our
American college people—are trying to train them
st Ives to rebuild their part of the world. Many
universities are wrecks, their books burned, their
professors who fought in the war killed, those who
fought in the underground liquidated. The students
are tired, sick with malnutrition, with tuberculosis.
'1 In \ lack the little material tools of education, like
paper, like pencils.
'I heir schoolrooms are unheated and their clothes

are inadequate for cold. The depressions of having
killed, of being hunted and hated, of seeing their
families bombed out, their homes wiped out, their
prospects for living gone, still grip them. But they
are trying to train themselves for their countries'
future. They have courage. They need friends.
Have you at Stanford thought that there is one
word we use hoth for war and peace? VVe make
war. And we make peace. Those men in New York
are only making a pattern for peace. We really
make it, everyone of us. Whatever it is, it is the
inheritance of your generation. The more you help
your own European, and Asiatic contemporaries,
toward strong bodies and trained, constructive
minds, the surer your peace will be. And isn't that
what you fought for, overseas and here at home?
All of us who have been Stanford students our
selves, and know what that high privilege means
through life, wish you so well in your drive. May
you earn the right to face Thanksgiving this year,
with your proud Four Red Feathers in the center
of your tables.—Dare Stark McMullin.
