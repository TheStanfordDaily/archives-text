(Kdil. Nolo: For a few more belly-laughs before
C'otighlin comes back, we present former Bull Ses
sioncr Cathy Owen, who is one of the more adjusted
members of the civilian Stanford population.)
So the campus isn't the same. You left, it as a
nice healthy human and came back as a nice healthy
human being, and what are you greeted by—a bunch
of war-time civilian psych cases. All that it will
lake to nurse these, shattered minds back to nor
malcy is a little patience." tolerance, and understand-
There have been complaints this quarter that girls
;:ren't answering their phone calls. That's just from
force of habit as far as the girls are concerned. For
the past three or four years, they have been building
up a reflex to run in the opposite direction at the
ring of a phone or a buzzer. Those were the days
when they knew that the only person who would
he calling them would be their mothers, begging for
an advance in their allowances so that they could
buy an extra quart of beer for company dinner. Start
I >< is l - war education along these lines gently by send
ing your favorite phone dodger a telegram. Then
when you get her out, explain things. Should keep
your conversation from dragging.
One slightly fictitious fellow was complaining the
other day about a Civilian-shattered girl he'd taken
out for a session at Dinah's. Wh n n this girl was de
livered a straight shot, she promptly poured the
liquid down her date's back and started rubbing it
vigorously up and down his vertebrae. Stop to real
ize that during the war this was one of the girls who

spent all her spare time working in the uniform of
a Nurse's Aids—l 942-1916 equivalent of Rally Com.
Those were the days when a girl spent her big-game
3:3o's rubbing alcohol-soaked backs at the hospital.
Tolerance, time lor adjustment, please.
Don't feci hurt if a girl snatches your Hi-Y pin
from your chest. Give it to her. She needs that
symbol of belonging that she lost when the ASTP
left campus, hiking the arm patches, which she had
displayed on the sleeve of her raincoat throughout
the war, with them.
About this business of non-fraternization in the
rooting sections. You don't like it. but there's a sound
basis for it. I think the Administration might have
done well in divulging this information at the be
ginning of the football season. It would have saved
a great deal of misunderstanding. You see. the girl
of war-time Stanford was not educated in the ways
of football. Consequently, she learned to release her
more savage impulses on a yo-yo. You can see how
disastrous it would have been if these uneducated
beings had been left unsegregated this season. As
was expected, odd things happened at those first few
games. I'm happy to report, though, that there have
been fewer and fewer yo-yos present at each suc
ceeding game. The return of fraternization will un
doubtedly come with the total healing of these minds.
As you can see, this problem cannot be treated
fully in one issue. Studies of mental conditions fill
books. One last point along the lines of tolerance,
however. The next time your date flights at a drive
in. sympathy, please. Just a case of maladjusted,
nervous indigestion.
