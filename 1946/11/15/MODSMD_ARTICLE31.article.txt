Ideas for Big Game floats may be
turned in at the A.S.S.U. office un
til 5 p.m. today. Float entries have
been slow up till now, according to
Cardinal Ann Lilienthal, especially
from women's Bow houses, frater
nities, and the Village.
Miss Lilienthal also announced
that halls can combine in making a
float, but that it would be judged in
only one of the categories and the
prize, if it won, would be awarded
to only one of the groups.
The prizes to be awarded will be
on display in the Cellar from Mon
day until the day of the parade.
Judges for the parade will be sta
tioned at a platform in front of Me
morial Arch to view and judge the
floats as the parade goes from the
Phvsics corner to the Pavilion.
