# Atheist Wins Radio Battle, To Speak Over KQW Sunday
## 
### 
Robert Pi. Scott of Palo Alto, well-known proponent of atheism, will
i air his views over KQW at 8:.'50 a.m. Sunday climaxing a six-year attempt
| to answer attacks which he claims have been made during regularly
I scheduled church broadcasts.
Scott filed a petition with the Federal Communications Commission on

* March 27, 1945, asking for the revo-
I cation of the licenses of KPO, KQW.
and KFRC because Ihose stations
refused him time for talks on
atheism, but carried religious pro
j grams and direct arguments against
| atheism. Existence or non-existence
of a Divine Being, he argued, is a
' controversial issue.
FCC HEARING
At a hearing presided over by
Commissioner Clifford J. Durr last
January in San Francisco, Scott was
' allowed to ask each station whether
'it would provide time for such
broadcasts. The stations claimed
that the subject was not "contro
versial," that discussion would not
| be in the public interest, and that,
even if "controversial," was "not of
sufficient public moment."
Last July 19 the FCC issued a
I dissertation denying Scott's request
for revocation of the licenses of
KQW, KPO, and KFRC but declar
| ing: ". . . freedom of religious be
lief carries with it freedom to dis
believe" and "if freedom of speech
is to have any meaning ... it must
be extended as readily to ideas
which we disapprove of or abhor,
as to ideas which we approve."
GETS AIR TIME
The FCC warned that "an organi
zation or idea may be projected into
the realm of controversy by virtue
of being attacked" and "holders of
| a belief should not be denied the
right to answer attacks on them or
their belief solely because they are
few in number."
On the basis of the FCC decision.
KQW has decided to give Seott air
time to determine whether there is
sufficient interest in atheism in this
] area to justify future broadcasts.
