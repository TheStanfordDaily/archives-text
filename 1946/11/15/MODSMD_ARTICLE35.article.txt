George J. Ilall, visiting chap
lain at Memorial Church, yester
day declared that "Robert 11.
| Scott's doctrine of atheism, as with
any such doctrine, is mere opin
ion and not fhe result of careful
thought or judicious observation
of nature."
"He is doing what appears to be
impossible: finding positive reasons
for a negative belief. Instead of
trying to prove that something is
true, he is attempting to prove an
untruth," Mr. Hall declared.
"The promulgating of such ideas
by such a blanketing, yet personal,
medium as radio is unfortunate. It
transcends the American ideal of
freedom of speech," he added.
