Make Way for the Mourners, Friends,
Hie Kose Howl's 011 Its Deathbed
So a Rose Bowl tie-up with the so-called Big Nine is finally in the bag.
The bigwigs in the Coast Conference have been working on that deal for
a long time. Let's hope they're satisfied with their work, because nobody
else will be. What it means is the death of the Rose Bowl as the nation's
top New Year's Day grid attraction. Oh sure, football filberts will still
read about it in the newspapers, but their interest will be cursory rather
than rabid. The Rose Bowl has been a national institution; how could
the moguls who control it dare to localize it in this way?
The Big Nine was too good to participate in the name —until they K<»t
to thinking about ail that nice money they could split up. They kept
the Coast Conference cooling its heels out in the anteroom, hat in hand,
for over a decade. Now they suddenly decide to take over, at a time
when their teams are the poorest in years. And when they whistle, the
(dast Conference jumps, like a dog begging for scraps oIT the table.

II Should lie Army or Georgia
Granted, in a normal year the Big Nine develops some of the country's
top squads. But this isn't a normal year; the leader of their loop, Illinois,
has already lost two games and is a cinch to lose at least one more. Even
il the Big Nine is now ready to participate, how can they have the gall to
muscle in this year? The Coast has an undefeated team, an aspirant for
the mythical national championship. The only way they can hope to get
recognition as the country's best team is by playing—and beating—the
best the East has to offer. The best team East of here may be Army, or
Georgia, or Notre Dame, but it certainly isn't Illinois or any other Big
Nine squad. Both Army and Georgia have shown interest, and one should
be invited.
Even if the Coast Conference, steeped in its inferiority complex, actu
ally feels it's best to make an iron-clad agreement with the typhoons
Irom the Middle West—and the Coast Conference president hints that
acceptance is just a formality—the magnanimous (?) offer of the Big
Nine is little short of presumptuous. They don't even guarantee td send
out their best team. In fact, should the same team win their champion
ship two years in a row, the prospective agreement expressly provides
that a lesser team will be chosen. (Note: a typhoon is a big wind.)
01 course the Coast Conference should not have a monopoly on the
game from this end, eilher; when Santa Clara or some other independent
has the best team on the Coast, they should be selected as the Western
delender. But that's an entirely different angle. It's a shame the N.C.A.A.
hasn't co-ordinated all the bowl games so a national champion can be
decided, as in basketball and track.

Watch Out for Those Cougars
Tomorrow afternoon the Washington State Cougars will probably hit
their season's peak. That's what the Indians have been up against ever
since the U.C.L.A. game. Yes, the boys from Pullman looked futile against
Cal, but they showed promise up at Burglary, Calif., even while appearing
as helpless as any college team I've ever seen.
The Bears got three very fortunate breaks in the first eight minutes,
and snatched a 20-point lead. After that they could do nothing wrong
and Coach Phil Sorboe's men could do nothing right. The Cal tackles
were weak—at least that day—and the Cougars did nothing about it.
In the first quarter halfback I)on Paul (a go'od man) was sprung over
tackle for a touchdown. Throughout the rest of the afternoon the Cou
gars would invariably run their first play over tackle for about eight
yards; then they'd throw two incomplete passes and kick.
The Cougars had another cute little trick that didn't get them any
where. They line up in aba 1 mean illegitimate T formation, with two
men back and a flanker. Then suddenly the qb will run back about five
yards, making it a short punt formation, and the ball is' snapped immedi
ately. At least halt' a dozen times the qb got the ball and faded back for
a pass—only to find all his receivers covered.
'1 hen he'd run back 20 or .'5O yards toward his own goal, with half the
Cal team chasing him. Each time he'd squirm his way out of the clutches
nl YYiekhorst's Willies and make it back to the line of scrimmage. Then,
with 1(1 or 2(1 yards of uninhabited turf stretched invitingly before him.
he d stop and throw a pass which would be batted down immediately.
They should have had AT LEAST two more touchdowns.
You can safely bet a case of the best pre-war giggle water that they
won't be pulling any such stupid boners against Larrupin' Lloyd & Co.
Phil Sorboe (pronounced Sarbo) is a pretty wise young character. His
boys took last Saturday off, so they've been concentrating on this game
lor Iwo weeks. For the first time this year, his squad is at full strength.
So 111 pick the injury-riddled Stanfords anyhow, by a score of 26 to 13.

won't be pulling any such stupid boners against Larrupin' Lloyd & Co.
Phil Sorboe (pronounced Sarbo) is a pretty wise young character. His
boys took last Saturday off, so they've been concentrating on this game
lor Iwo weeks. For the first time this year, his squad is at full strength.
So 111 pick the injury-riddled Stanfords anyhow, by a score of 26 to 13.

So a Rose Bowl tie-up with the so-called Big Nine is finally in the bag.
The bigwigs in the Coast Conference have been working on that deal for
a long time. Let's hope they're satisfied with their work, because nobody
else will be. What it means is the death of the Rose Bowl as the nation's
top New Year's Day grid attraction. Oh sure, football filberts will still
read about it in the newspapers, but their interest will be cursory rather
than rabid. The Rose Bowl has been a national institution; how could
the moguls who control it dare to localize it in this way?
The Big Nine was too good to participate in the name —until they K<»t
to thinking about ail that nice money they could split up. They kept
the Coast Conference cooling its heels out in the anteroom, hat in hand,
for over a decade. Now they suddenly decide to take over, at a time

II Should lie Army or Georgia
Granted, in a normal year the Big Nine develops some of the country's
top squads. But this isn't a normal year; the leader of their loop, Illinois,
has already lost two games and is a cinch to lose at least one more. Even
il the Big Nine is now ready to participate, how can they have the gall to
muscle in this year? The Coast has an undefeated team, an aspirant for
the mythical national championship. The only way they can hope to get
recognition as the country's best team is by playing—and beating—the
best the East has to offer. The best team East of here may be Army, or
Georgia, or Notre Dame, but it certainly isn't Illinois or any other Big
Nine squad. Both Army and Georgia have shown interest, and one should
be invited.
Even if the Coast Conference, steeped in its inferiority complex, actu
ally feels it's best to make an iron-clad agreement with the typhoons
Irom the Middle West—and the Coast Conference president hints that
acceptance is just a formality—the magnanimous (?) offer of the Big
Nine is little short of presumptuous. They don't even guarantee td send
out their best team. In fact, should the same team win their champion
ship two years in a row, the prospective agreement expressly provides
that a lesser team will be chosen. (Note: a typhoon is a big wind.)
01 course the Coast Conference should not have a monopoly on the
game from this end, eilher; when Santa Clara or some other independent
has the best team on the Coast, they should be selected as the Western
delender. But that's an entirely different angle. It's a shame the N.C.A.A.
hasn't co-ordinated all the bowl games so a national champion can be
decided, as in basketball and track.

Watch Out for Those Cougars
Tomorrow afternoon the Washington State Cougars will probably hit
their season's peak. That's what the Indians have been up against ever
since the U.C.L.A. game. Yes, the boys from Pullman looked futile against
Cal, but they showed promise up at Burglary, Calif., even while appearing
as helpless as any college team I've ever seen.
The Bears got three very fortunate breaks in the first eight minutes,
and snatched a 20-point lead. After that they could do nothing wrong
and Coach Phil Sorboe's men could do nothing right. The Cal tackles
were weak—at least that day—and the Cougars did nothing about it.
In the first quarter halfback I)on Paul (a go'od man) was sprung over
tackle for a touchdown. Throughout the rest of the afternoon the Cou
gars would invariably run their first play over tackle for about eight
yards; then they'd throw two incomplete passes and kick.
The Cougars had another cute little trick that didn't get them any
where. They line up in aba 1 mean illegitimate T formation, with two
men back and a flanker. Then suddenly the qb will run back about five
yards, making it a short punt formation, and the ball is' snapped immedi
ately. At least halt' a dozen times the qb got the ball and faded back for
a pass—only to find all his receivers covered.
'1 hen he'd run back 20 or .'5O yards toward his own goal, with half the
Cal team chasing him. Each time he'd squirm his way out of the clutches
nl YYiekhorst's Willies and make it back to the line of scrimmage. Then,
with 1(1 or 2(1 yards of uninhabited turf stretched invitingly before him.
he d stop and throw a pass which would be batted down immediately.
They should have had AT LEAST two more touchdowns.

game from this end, eilher; when Santa Clara or some other independent
has the best team on the Coast, they should be selected as the Western
delender. But that's an entirely different angle. It's a shame the N.C.A.A.
hasn't co-ordinated all the bowl games so a national champion can be

Watch Out for Those Cougars
Tomorrow afternoon the Washington State Cougars will probably hit
their season's peak. That's what the Indians have been up against ever
since the U.C.L.A. game. Yes, the boys from Pullman looked futile against
Cal, but they showed promise up at Burglary, Calif., even while appearing
as helpless as any college team I've ever seen.
The Bears got three very fortunate breaks in the first eight minutes,
and snatched a 20-point lead. After that they could do nothing wrong
and Coach Phil Sorboe's men could do nothing right. The Cal tackles
were weak—at least that day—and the Cougars did nothing about it.
In the first quarter halfback I)on Paul (a go'od man) was sprung over
tackle for a touchdown. Throughout the rest of the afternoon the Cou
gars would invariably run their first play over tackle for about eight
yards; then they'd throw two incomplete passes and kick.
The Cougars had another cute little trick that didn't get them any
where. They line up in aba 1 mean illegitimate T formation, with two
men back and a flanker. Then suddenly the qb will run back about five
yards, making it a short punt formation, and the ball is' snapped immedi
ately. At least halt' a dozen times the qb got the ball and faded back for
a pass—only to find all his receivers covered.
'1 hen he'd run back 20 or .'5O yards toward his own goal, with half the
Cal team chasing him. Each time he'd squirm his way out of the clutches
nl YYiekhorst's Willies and make it back to the line of scrimmage. Then,
with 1(1 or 2(1 yards of uninhabited turf stretched invitingly before him.
he d stop and throw a pass which would be batted down immediately.
They should have had AT LEAST two more touchdowns.
You can safely bet a case of the best pre-war giggle water that they
won't be pulling any such stupid boners against Larrupin' Lloyd & Co.
Phil Sorboe (pronounced Sarbo) is a pretty wise young character. His
boys took last Saturday off, so they've been concentrating on this game
lor Iwo weeks. For the first time this year, his squad is at full strength.
So 111 pick the injury-riddled Stanfords anyhow, by a score of 26 to 13.

The bigwigs in the Coast Conference have been working on that deal for
a long time. Let's hope they're satisfied with their work, because nobody

II Should lie Army or Georgia
Granted, in a normal year the Big Nine develops some of the country's
top squads. But this isn't a normal year; the leader of their loop, Illinois,
has already lost two games and is a cinch to lose at least one more. Even
il the Big Nine is now ready to participate, how can they have the gall to
muscle in this year? The Coast has an undefeated team, an aspirant for
the mythical national championship. The only way they can hope to get
recognition as the country's best team is by playing—and beating—the
best the East has to offer. The best team East of here may be Army, or
Georgia, or Notre Dame, but it certainly isn't Illinois or any other Big
Nine squad. Both Army and Georgia have shown interest, and one should
be invited.
Even if the Coast Conference, steeped in its inferiority complex, actu
ally feels it's best to make an iron-clad agreement with the typhoons
Irom the Middle West—and the Coast Conference president hints that
acceptance is just a formality—the magnanimous (?) offer of the Big
Nine is little short of presumptuous. They don't even guarantee td send
out their best team. In fact, should the same team win their champion
ship two years in a row, the prospective agreement expressly provides
that a lesser team will be chosen. (Note: a typhoon is a big wind.)

a long time. Let's hope they're satisfied with their work, because nobody
else will be. What it means is the death of the Rose Bowl as the nation's
top New Year's Day grid attraction. Oh sure, football filberts will still
read about it in the newspapers, but their interest will be cursory rather
than rabid. The Rose Bowl has been a national institution; how could
the moguls who control it dare to localize it in this way?
The Big Nine was too good to participate in the name —until they K<»t
to thinking about ail that nice money they could split up. They kept
the Coast Conference cooling its heels out in the anteroom, hat in hand,
for over a decade. Now they suddenly decide to take over, at a time
when their teams are the poorest in years. And when they whistle, the
(dast Conference jumps, like a dog begging for scraps oIT the table.

II Should lie Army or Georgia
Granted, in a normal year the Big Nine develops some of the country's
top squads. But this isn't a normal year; the leader of their loop, Illinois,
has already lost two games and is a cinch to lose at least one more. Even
il the Big Nine is now ready to participate, how can they have the gall to
muscle in this year? The Coast has an undefeated team, an aspirant for
the mythical national championship. The only way they can hope to get
recognition as the country's best team is by playing—and beating—the
best the East has to offer. The best team East of here may be Army, or
Georgia, or Notre Dame, but it certainly isn't Illinois or any other Big
Nine squad. Both Army and Georgia have shown interest, and one should
be invited.
Even if the Coast Conference, steeped in its inferiority complex, actu
ally feels it's best to make an iron-clad agreement with the typhoons
Irom the Middle West—and the Coast Conference president hints that
acceptance is just a formality—the magnanimous (?) offer of the Big
Nine is little short of presumptuous. They don't even guarantee td send
out their best team. In fact, should the same team win their champion
ship two years in a row, the prospective agreement expressly provides
that a lesser team will be chosen. (Note: a typhoon is a big wind.)
01 course the Coast Conference should not have a monopoly on the
game from this end, eilher; when Santa Clara or some other independent
has the best team on the Coast, they should be selected as the Western
delender. But that's an entirely different angle. It's a shame the N.C.A.A.
hasn't co-ordinated all the bowl games so a national champion can be
decided, as in basketball and track.

Watch Out for Those Cougars
Tomorrow afternoon the Washington State Cougars will probably hit
their season's peak. That's what the Indians have been up against ever
since the U.C.L.A. game. Yes, the boys from Pullman looked futile against
Cal, but they showed promise up at Burglary, Calif., even while appearing
as helpless as any college team I've ever seen.
The Bears got three very fortunate breaks in the first eight minutes,
and snatched a 20-point lead. After that they could do nothing wrong
and Coach Phil Sorboe's men could do nothing right. The Cal tackles
were weak—at least that day—and the Cougars did nothing about it.
In the first quarter halfback I)on Paul (a go'od man) was sprung over
tackle for a touchdown. Throughout the rest of the afternoon the Cou
gars would invariably run their first play over tackle for about eight
yards; then they'd throw two incomplete passes and kick.
The Cougars had another cute little trick that didn't get them any
where. They line up in aba 1 mean illegitimate T formation, with two
men back and a flanker. Then suddenly the qb will run back about five
yards, making it a short punt formation, and the ball is' snapped immedi
ately. At least halt' a dozen times the qb got the ball and faded back for
a pass—only to find all his receivers covered.
'1 hen he'd run back 20 or .'5O yards toward his own goal, with half the
Cal team chasing him. Each time he'd squirm his way out of the clutches
nl YYiekhorst's Willies and make it back to the line of scrimmage. Then,
with 1(1 or 2(1 yards of uninhabited turf stretched invitingly before him.
he d stop and throw a pass which would be batted down immediately.
They should have had AT LEAST two more touchdowns.
You can safely bet a case of the best pre-war giggle water that they
won't be pulling any such stupid boners against Larrupin' Lloyd & Co.
Phil Sorboe (pronounced Sarbo) is a pretty wise young character. His
boys took last Saturday off, so they've been concentrating on this game
lor Iwo weeks. For the first time this year, his squad is at full strength.
So 111 pick the injury-riddled Stanfords anyhow, by a score of 26 to 13.

I'eculiar Prognostications
Old Sgt. Slinger has been receiving plenty of comments about his dog
gerel (which is so doggy that trees attract the Friday Daily like a magnet),
hut he's going to keep writing it anyway. Fifteen games have been worked
over to date, with 10 wins, three losses, and two ties, for a phenomenal
percentage ol .709 —or .7692307, if you're a perfectionist. I have at least
one fan; fellow columnist Ted Norton says it's the work of a singular
genius. How'd he know I wasn't married?
Montana meets Ucla; that's enough said.
The Grizzlies to win? You should drop dead.
Oregon's hopes are on Jake Leicht,
But the Huskies will win without a feicht.
Forrest Hall U. goes on a spree;
If Utah wins, the beer is on me.
The Meager Beavers will spank poor Cal; *
Come on, you Bears, get on the ball
Gaels over Broncos in their scramble;
The Broncs will look like Little Black Samble.
Cards whip Cougars in mighty struggle;
Stow 'em in the tepee! Uggle, uggle!
Oi maybe I should have used "Fight fiercely, struggle struggle!" If Rally
coin is collecting silly, inane yells. I'll gladly donate one free of charge.
By adapting an old high school yell. I come up with "Bananas! Bananas!
Two for five; Fight 'em! Beat 'em! Skin 'em alive!
There, I said it. Now I'll go wash my typewriter out with soap.
