# Big Nine Approves Rose Bowl Tie-up
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Nov. 14 (UP). —The Western Conference today formally
approved the signing of a five-year agreement with the Pacific Coast Con
ference for annual participation in (he Rose Bowl.
The announcement of the Big Nine's formal approval was made by
Prof. Frank E. Richart of the University of Illinois, chairman of the con
ference's faculty committee.

I ne Pacific Coast Conference has
called a special meeting for Tues
day, Nov. !!(, at IJerkeiev in order
to consider the proposition. The
Big Nine will be officially repre
sented at the important coast ses
sion.
Speed in handling the negotiations
is considered vital by both groups,
as the Big Nine is particularly anxi
ous to start the series with the forth
coming New Year's Day game. De
spite reports that Army's mighty un
bryiten, but once-tied, team is being
considered by the coast, it is felt the
meeting next Tuesday may wipe out
the Cadet's last hope for the bid.
The original proposal for a Big
Nine-Coast Conference "tie-up"
for the Rose Bowl was made sev
eral years ago by the Pacific group.
In one previous ballot, the Big
Nine declined. However, this fall,
sentiment was found to have shift
ed and another formal vote was
undertaken.
The proposed Big Nine agreement
to cover a five-year period would
find a Western Conference team op
posing the coast champion for the
first three seasons. Thereafter, the
Big Nine could either send one of its
own members or select an independ
ent team or the representative of
some other conference in the "East."
Under the Western Conference
plan all member schools would
share in the receipts of the game.
The "visiting" team share of the
Rose Bowl game is approximately
$100,000.
A Big Nine team could not ac
cept a bowl hid more than once
every third season.
In order to overcome strong fac
ulty opposition to "lengthening the
season," squads would be dismissed
after the final regularly scheduled
contest and then recalled for inten
sive practice sometime around Dec.
15, which would permit two full
weeks of conditioning.
