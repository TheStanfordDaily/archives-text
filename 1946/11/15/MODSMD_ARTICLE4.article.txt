# Titus Injured, Martin to Sub

The Cougar has something up his
| sleeve.
And yet the men who know their
! bets the best tell vis the Indians arc
j 3 to 1 or 13-point favorites to corral
j the Cougar in the Stadium tomor
| row afternoon.
j A 205-pound quarterback, Gordy
j Brunswick, is going to start at the
| quarterback spot for the Washing
j ton Staters in place of regular start
i er Dean Eggers. Brunswick is a
I long, long passer—up in Pullman
they say he can throw the ball 50
I yards without much strain. Could
be Phil Sorboe is planning a little
razzle-dazzle long-distance passing
I against the Indians in the stadium
tomorrow afternoon.
ZANY GROUND ATTACK
The Washington Staters have one
of the zaniest, most unconventional
I ground attacks seen on the Western
slopes in many years. They haven't
! been able to get their attack mov-
I ing in hieh gear this year (except
| maybe agai ft Idaho), but they ?re
I potentially dangerous.
Sorboe is going to call on able
halfback Bill Lippincott to do the
signal caii'ng Saturday. The Lip,
who has been injured most ol' the
year, is a big, tough, and fast run
ner as well as a heady field general.
Coach Marchie Schwartz' Cards
went through another long, hard
workout yesterday in the mud of
their practice field. The Jayvees
were again utilized to run through
the W.S.C. plays, against the first
stringers, and then against the re
serves.
SIGNAL DRILL IIELl)
The Cougar attack, even when
executed by the inexperienced Jay
vees, was confusing to Marchie's
boys. The rest of the afternoon and
evening were spent on a business
like signal drill.
Two more doses of bad news for
the Indians' hopes tomorrow —half
Mickey Titus, suffering from a
pointer, will not play Saturday;
right half George Quist will be on '
the sidelines again. Both boys
should be ready for the Big Game,
but that right half spot is looking
a little too vacant for comfort for
the W.S.C. clash.
The starting lineup for the In
dians tomorrow will find game co
captains Bob Hall and Dave Brown ;
