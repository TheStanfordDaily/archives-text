# Titus Injured, Martin to Sub

The Cougar has something up his
| sleeve.
And yet the men who know their
! bets the best tell vis the Indians arc
j 3 to 1 or 13-point favorites to corral
j the Cougar in the Stadium tomor
| row afternoon.
j A 205-pound quarterback, Gordy
j Brunswick, is going to start at the
| quarterback spot for the Washing
j ton Staters in place of regular start
i er Dean Eggers. Brunswick is a
I long, long passer—up in Pullman
they say he can throw the ball 50
I yards without much strain. Could
be Phil Sorboe is planning a little
razzle-dazzle long-distance passing
I against the Indians in the stadium
tomorrow afternoon.
ZANY GROUND ATTACK
The Washington Staters have one
of the zaniest, most unconventional
I ground attacks seen on the Western
slopes in many years. They haven't
! been able to get their attack mov-
I ing in hieh gear this year (except
| maybe agai ft Idaho), but they ?re
I potentially dangerous.
Sorboe is going to call on able
halfback Bill Lippincott to do the
signal caii'ng Saturday. The Lip,
who has been injured most ol' the
year, is a big, tough, and fast run
ner as well as a heady field general.
Coach Marchie Schwartz' Cards
went through another long, hard
workout yesterday in the mud of
their practice field. The Jayvees
were again utilized to run through
the W.S.C. plays, against the first
stringers, and then against the re
serves.
SIGNAL DRILL IIELl)
The Cougar attack, even when
executed by the inexperienced Jay
vees, was confusing to Marchie's
boys. The rest of the afternoon and
evening were spent on a business
like signal drill.
Two more doses of bad news for
the Indians' hopes tomorrow —half
Mickey Titus, suffering from a
pointer, will not play Saturday;
right half George Quist will be on '
the sidelines again. Both boys
should be ready for the Big Game,
but that right half spot is looking
a little too vacant for comfort for
the W.S.C. clash.
The starting lineup for the In
dians tomorrow will find game co
captains Bob Hall and Dave Brown ;
I at right and left end, respectively;
I Charles Wakefield, right tackle: Fred
! Boensch at left; Dick Madigan at
j right guard, Bill Hachten at. left,
! and Dorsey Kindler holding down
the pivot post.
BROWNSON AT QUARTERBACK
.Buck Brownson will probably get
the call at quarterback again. Gene
I Martin will be running at left half
| and Bob Anderson at right. And.
I of course, Lloyd Merriman will be
i displaying his All-Coast brand of
| ful(backing.
One of the Abrams boys—Dick
! and Bob—is going to be unhappy
i after the game tomorrow. Dick
| Abrams, 210-pound fullback, is
■ Washington State's game captain.
! His younger brother Bob is Stan
ford's 213-pound right tackle. Dick
: played tackle for Stanford in '42.
but transferred to Washington State
when he got out of the service.
If Phil Sorboe wants to sleep a
little better tonight all he has to do
is read over that lengthy Card in-
Kiry list. The Cards have never
been in this bad shape. Five key
men will be watching the Cougar
clash from the sidelines — Finney
Cox, Pete August, Harv Bernhard,
George Quist. and Mickey Titus.
Marty Anderson's knee is still a
question mark, but he may be called
upon tomorrow. Marty ran through
yesterday's practice without any
visible limp.

ZANY GROUND ATTACK

of the zaniest, most unconventional
I ground attacks seen on the Western
slopes in many years. They haven't
! been able to get their attack mov-
I ing in hieh gear this year (except
| maybe agai ft Idaho), but they ?re
I potentially dangerous.
Sorboe is going to call on able
halfback Bill Lippincott to do the
signal caii'ng Saturday. The Lip,
who has been injured most ol' the
year, is a big, tough, and fast run
ner as well as a heady field general.
Coach Marchie Schwartz' Cards
