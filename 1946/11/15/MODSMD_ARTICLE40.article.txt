# Jayvees Prep For Ramblers
## 
### 
Still upset about that Cal Aggie tie
Saturday, Coach Ed Stamm and his
Jayvees ;ire hard at work this week
to iron out the rough spots and pick
up a few new tricks to pull on the
Cal Ramblers November 23.
The little Indians came back from
Davis with only a few minor in
juries. Halfback Ken Peck hurt his
ankle but will be back in uniform
for today's practice. Center Bob
Regier dislocated his hand, but will
also be back in the lineup in time
for the Cal game.
Stamm has nothing but praise for
the excellent strategy of the Aggies.
Twice the Card Juniors marched the
length of the field, only to lose the
ball within a few yards of the Aggie
goal, and be set back deep in their
own territory with smartly executed
quick kicks.
Keeping his record perfect. Little
Willie Altus made his seventh and
eighth conversions of the year
against the Aggies.- And Big Ed
Stamm was mighty glad that he had
Little Willie and his magic toe along
on that Davis trip.
