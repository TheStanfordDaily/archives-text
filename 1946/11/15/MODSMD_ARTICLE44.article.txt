Late this afternoon when (he results of the U.C.L.A. game are posted,
Stanford sports inns will know il the vaunted Indian Water Polo team is
undisputed champion of the Pacific: Coast Conference. By chalking up a
win over the lowly Bruins, the Tribe splashers can clinch the pennant once
and for all. The game will start at 4:15 in the Enema pool.

Even if the visiting Uclans man
age to pull the biggest upset of the
season by tripping the Indians, the
second-place California Bears will
only be able to tie the league-lead
ing locals. In that case, next Satur
day's Bear-Indian meeting in Berke
ley would develop into a crucial tilt.
But if previous records can be valu
ed, Stanford should be able to put
an end to the suspense this afternoon.
Down south the Bruin support
ers have been clieering wildl> as
the U.C.L.A. mermen finally came
through with a victory, over Cal
Tech. Otherwise the Bruin season
has been a disastrous one with the

of the cellar position in the confer
ence. Stanford contributed to the
sorry U.C.L.A. record by easily
whipping the Bruins early in the
season.
Seven consecutive times the In
dians have emerged from water bat
tles with a victory and they will be
heavily favored to make it ei,t>ht this
