# Job Shortage For G.I. Grads?
## 
### 
That the G.l.'s search for jobs af
ter college will be no easy task was
(he conclusion drawn yesterday by
a group of college newspapermen
and women after an all-day tour of
East Bay manufacturing plants.
The tour, organized by the Na
tional Association of Manufacturers,
was planned to show the opportuni
ties for college graduates in local
industry.
"We want men who are willing
to start at the bottom and work
up," was the comment most fre
quently given. "Any young man
who desires to work hard, who
is willing to get along with peo
ple and who experts no soft of
lice job to begin with will find a
place," was the answer of How
ard Hopgard of Parallin Products
Inc.. to a question concerning the
college man's chances in industry.
Mr. Hopgard also stated his dis
satisfaction with the veteran's un
willingness to work in menial po
sitions, and said that most college
graduates today want to step into
executive positions without qualify
ing experience.
"Veterans seem to think they
have lost too much time in the
service, and that they are therefore
entitled to a more senior status in
the business world," he explained.
Other organizations visited by
the reporters were General Elec
trie's East Oakland apparatus
plant, the Sunshine Biscuit Com
pany. and the Marchant Machine
Calculator Company.â€”Hcintzc
