# FOUR FEATHERS CAMPAIGN EXTENDED
## Policy Stand Bars W.A.A. Concert Bid 
### 
W.A.A. was refused permission to
present the Charles Weidman Con
cert on the proposed basis that 50
per cent of the profits go to the
University, at a special meeting of
Excom Friday afternoon.
The executive group authorized
the Student Manager, Joan MeDon
ough, to deliver their decision to
the Dean of Students, the President
of the University and the Board of
Trustees for their consideration
when I lie proposed financial policy
pertaining to student functions,
which is being drafted by Dean John
M. Stalnaker, comes up for discus
sion.
CONCERT AGREEMENT
Controversy over the concert
arose when W.A.A. appealed direct
to the Committee on Public Exer
cises for approval of their plans
without first obtaining the approval
of the Student Manager and Excom.
Dean Stalnaker, acting for the
Committee on Public Exercises, re
plied in a letter to W.A.A. that such
a concert would be approved but
that "any proceeds from the concert
will be deposited to the account of
the University."
W.A.A. then sent a committee to
Dean Stalnaker, and concluded with
him a written agreement that "the
distribution of all profits above ex
plicit costs shall be divided on a
fifty-fifty basis."
VOTED DOWN
When the problem was finally
brought before Excom for approval.
Excom, acting on the recommenda
tion of Miss McDonough, refused to
allow the Concert on the proposed
basis because it might set a prece
dent and influence the policy which
Dean Stalnaker is drawing up to
govern such matters.
Excom also approved the sale of
tom-toms to the student body prior
to the Big Game.
