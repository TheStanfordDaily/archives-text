# Last-Minute Touchdown Brings Victory to Indians
## 
### DON DAVIES 
It was Stanford's game, but it took (»0 minutes of good, bad, and indif
ferent football for the Indians to convince the Washington State Cougars.
Phil Sorboc's Washington Staters were apparently unimpressed by the
pro-game odds (hat sent Marehic Schwartz's boys into the game as i-1
favorites, for the Cougars fought the Indians on better than even terms
♦ most of the afternoon.

The 12,000 passive spectators
dwarfed into the massive stadium
had to look twico at the big score
board after the final gun to make
sure that it read Stanford 27, Wash
ington State 26.
Obviously saving their Sunday
punch for the big one next week,
the Cards were anything but fired
up. Too much of the time they
looked as if they just didn't care.
Lloyd Merriman watched most of
the game from the bench. Marchie
was just making sure that Lloyd
would be around and ready for that
cross - bay jaunt next Saturday
morning.
The Cougar had something up its
sleeve. The long prayer passes by
205-pound Gordy Brunswick were
always a scoring threat, and his
running was dangerous.' Phil Sor
boe's unconventional offense was
confusing, and the Cougar's defen
sive formations were baffling. They
lined up in everything from a o-5-
2-1 to a 7-2-2-1 defense.
The less said about that first
quarter the better. Both the In
dians and the Cougars looked bad.
The tackling and defensive play in
general was sloppy, and neither
team showed any offensive spark.
Only bright spot in the first pe
riod was Bob Anderson's 52-yard
broken field run from his own 36
to the W.S.C. 13. But the referee
dug down deep for a handkerchief
and a penalty for too much time in
putting the ball in play, nullifying
the run.
In the second quarter the Cards
started playing ball long enough to
roll 57 yards in eight plays for their
first score. Wayne Erickson opened
the drive by intercepting a Bruns
wick pass on the Stanford 43. Jack
Brownson tossed one to end Bob
Hall at midfield. Hall slipped as he
caught the pass, but regained his
footing in time to advance down to
the 38. Fullback Don Zappettini ran
nicely around right end to the 29,
and Brownson completed another
pass to Hall, who ran to the 20. Er
ickson circled left end for five more,
and then cut off tackle 12 yards to
the three. Ben Cardinalli hit center
for two more, and Zappettini cross
bucked the rest of the way. Marty
Feldman's try for extra point was
good and Stanford led, 7-0.
Instead of curling up on the con
ference doormat and sleeping this
one out. the Cougars snarled back
with a 65-yard sustained drive and
a touchdown. Starting from the 35,
Jerry Williams hit left guard for
six, and right guard for five. Bruns
wick, Dean Eggers, and Bill Lip
pincott, 1945 All-Coaster, took turns
crashing the Indian line, and in five
plays were four yards from the goal.
The press box was flustered on the
next play when Number 51, listed
as a guard in the program, crashed
over for the touchdown. Number 51
was Bob Keiser, who deserted his
guard spot to play most of the game
at quarterback.
John Godfrey kicked the extra
point and the game was all tied up,
7-7.
The confusing Cougars tried an
on-side kick, but alert Bill Hach
ten was on it, and the Cards too l,
over on their own 46. Pvlerriman
picked up nine yards around left
end. But a possible Indian drive
was stalled when Don Paul, who
wasn't even listed on the progi'am,
intercepted an Ainslie Bell pass and
returned it to the W.S.C. 37.
On the next play, Brunswick
tossed one of those long, long for
wards into the arms of Paul way
down on the Stanford 17. Bruns
wick personally escorted the laall to
the 6-yard line; Keiser moved to
the two; and Paul walked untouched
into the end zone for 6 points. God
frey's conversion was good, and the
Cougars walked off the feld at half
time with a 14-7 lead.
Just five minutes and 13 plays
after the third quarter kickoff by
W.S.C.. the Indians had marched 72
yards for their second touchdown.
Merriman, Anderson, and Gene
Martin each took cracks through
and around the Cougar line, moving
from their own 28 to the W.S.C. 39.
Bob Anderson loped 28 beautiful
yards to the 11. Martin added two
more over left guard, and Merriman
plunged to the four. Anderson car
ried it on a straight buck to the two.

and Merriman crashed over for the
TD. Feldman's conversion tied the
score at 14-14.
A few minutes later the Indians
pulled the play that the fans will be
talking about for a long, long time.
Ainslee Bell's pass was intercepted
by W.S.C. end Francis Bacoka- near
midfield. He started to run, but was
almost trapped by a group of red
jerseys. Someone yelled "lateral,"
and he lateraled. It was Dave Browri
who yelled and it was Dave Brown
who grabbed the lateral and raced
toward the W.S.C. goal. Just before
he was forced out of bounds on
about the 10 - yard line, Brown
threw a lateral of his own to Bob I
Hall who was thrown out on the !
10. On the next play, Bob Ander- j
son skirted the left flank for 10 j
yards and a score. Feldman made j
his third conversion and the score .

Once again the Cougars came
right back. With second down on
the W.S.C. 25, Brunswick faded
deep and, given lots of time, got off
a beautiful high pass, over 50 yards, '
into the arms of Paul, who went the j
remaining 25 yards on the ground. |
The play was good for 75 yards and
6 points. Godfrey's kick was block
ed by a swarm of Stanford linemen, j
and the Indians held a one-point |
advantage, 21-20.
The fourth quarter opened with l
the Cougars threatening again. A
fumble on the 18-yard line gave
W.S.C. possession cn the Stanford
19. On the crucial fourth-down
and-goal-to-go play, end Ted Burke
broke through and smeared Bruns
wick way back to the 23.
But the Cougars roared right back |
again. After the Indians were forced
to kick, Williams and Keiser moved
deep into Stanford territory. With
a first down on the 27, Paul made
it look much too easy by waltzing
untouched around right end for what
looked like the winning touchdown.
Dyson's conversion try was wide,
and the score, with less than seven
minutes left to play, was Washing
ton State 26, Stanford 21.
Again the Indians got steamed up
and tarted to drive, but were stalled
five yards short of midfield. Char
lie Wakefield's tremendous kick
rolled dead on the W.S.C. goal line,
but the referee ruled it rolled an
inch too far, and moved the ball out
to the 20.
The ref put the Cougars back on i
the 15 for taking too much time in
putting the ball in play, and the
next play the Ir.'lian line smeared
Keiser back to the 10, for taking
too much time in getting his pass
away.
Paul was forced to kick. Bob An
derson took it near midfield and re- 1
turned to the W.S.C. 35. Anderson
spun nicely to the 25, and the In
dians were on the move. Anderson
took a bullet pass from Bell, and
loped over for 6 points and the ball
game. It made no difference that
Feldman's try for extra point was
wide; the score still l'ead Stanford

a first down on the 27, Paul made
it look much too easy by waltzing
untouched around right end for what
looked like the winning touchdown.
Dyson's conversion try was wide,

Only bright spot in the first pe

to the W.S.C. 13. But the referee
dug down deep for a handkerchief
and a penalty for too much time in
putting the ball in play, nullifying
the run.
In the second quarter the Cards
started playing ball long enough to
roll 57 yards in eight plays for their
first score. Wayne Erickson opened
the drive by intercepting a Bruns
wick pass on the Stanford 43. Jack
Brownson tossed one to end Bob
Hall at midfield. Hall slipped as he
caught the pass, but regained his
footing in time to advance down to
the 38. Fullback Don Zappettini ran
nicely around right end to the 29,
and Brownson completed another
pass to Hall, who ran to the 20. Er
ickson circled left end for five more,
and then cut off tackle 12 yards to

six, and right guard for five. Bruns
wick, Dean Eggers, and Bill Lip
pincott, 1945 All-Coaster, took turns
crashing the Indian line, and in five
plays were four yards from the goal.
The press box was flustered on the
next play when Number 51, listed
as a guard in the program, crashed
over for the touchdown. Number 51
was Bob Keiser, who deserted his
guard spot to play most of the game
at quarterback.
John Godfrey kicked the extra
point and the game was all tied up,

The confusing Cougars tried an
on-side kick, but alert Bill Hach

On the next play, Brunswick
tossed one of those long, long for

A few minutes later the Indians
pulled the play that the fans will be

Ainslee Bell's pass was intercepted
by W.S.C. end Francis Bacoka- near
midfield. He started to run, but was
almost trapped by a group of red
jerseys. Someone yelled "lateral,"
and he lateraled. It was Dave Browri
who yelled and it was Dave Brown
who grabbed the lateral and raced
toward the W.S.C. goal. Just before
he was forced out of bounds on
about the 10 - yard line, Brown
threw a lateral of his own to Bob I
Hall who was thrown out on the !

Just five minutes and 13 plays
after the third quarter kickoff by
W.S.C.. the Indians had marched 72
yards for their second touchdown.
Merriman, Anderson, and Gene
Martin each took cracks through
and around the Cougar line, moving
from their own 28 to the W.S.C. 39.
Bob Anderson loped 28 beautiful
yards to the 11. Martin added two
more over left guard, and Merriman
plunged to the four. Anderson car

and Merriman crashed over for the
TD. Feldman's conversion tied the
score at 14-14.
A few minutes later the Indians
pulled the play that the fans will be
talking about for a long, long time.
Ainslee Bell's pass was intercepted
by W.S.C. end Francis Bacoka- near
midfield. He started to run, but was
almost trapped by a group of red
jerseys. Someone yelled "lateral,"
and he lateraled. It was Dave Browri
who yelled and it was Dave Brown
who grabbed the lateral and raced
toward the W.S.C. goal. Just before
he was forced out of bounds on
about the 10 - yard line, Brown
threw a lateral of his own to Bob I
Hall who was thrown out on the !
10. On the next play, Bob Ander- j
son skirted the left flank for 10 j
yards and a score. Feldman made j
his third conversion and the score .

Once again the Cougars came
right back. With second down on
the W.S.C. 25, Brunswick faded
deep and, given lots of time, got off
a beautiful high pass, over 50 yards, '
into the arms of Paul, who went the j
remaining 25 yards on the ground. |
The play was good for 75 yards and
6 points. Godfrey's kick was block
ed by a swarm of Stanford linemen, j
and the Indians held a one-point |
advantage, 21-20.
The fourth quarter opened with l
the Cougars threatening again. A
fumble on the 18-yard line gave
W.S.C. possession cn the Stanford
19. On the crucial fourth-down
and-goal-to-go play, end Ted Burke
broke through and smeared Bruns
wick way back to the 23.
But the Cougars roared right back |
again. After the Indians were forced
to kick, Williams and Keiser moved
deep into Stanford territory. With
a first down on the 27, Paul made
it look much too easy by waltzing
untouched around right end for what
looked like the winning touchdown.
Dyson's conversion try was wide,
and the score, with less than seven
minutes left to play, was Washing

Again the Indians got steamed up

five yards short of midfield. Char

rolled dead on the W.S.C. goal line,

dug down deep for a handkerchief

In the second quarter the Cards
started playing ball long enough to
roll 57 yards in eight plays for their
first score. Wayne Erickson opened
the drive by intercepting a Bruns

Brownson tossed one to end Bob
Hall at midfield. Hall slipped as he
caught the pass, but regained his

crashing the Indian line, and in five
plays were four yards from the goal.
The press box was flustered on the
next play when Number 51, listed
as a guard in the program, crashed
over for the touchdown. Number 51
was Bob Keiser, who deserted his
guard spot to play most of the game
at quarterback.
John Godfrey kicked the extra
point and the game was all tied up,
