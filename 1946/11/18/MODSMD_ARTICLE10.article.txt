# Last-Minute Touchdown Brings Victory to Indians
## 
### DON DAVIES 
It was Stanford's game, but it took (»0 minutes of good, bad, and indif
ferent football for the Indians to convince the Washington State Cougars.
Phil Sorboc's Washington Staters were apparently unimpressed by the
pro-game odds (hat sent Marehic Schwartz's boys into the game as i-1
favorites, for the Cougars fought the Indians on better than even terms
♦ most of the afternoon.

The 12,000 passive spectators
dwarfed into the massive stadium
had to look twico at the big score
board after the final gun to make
sure that it read Stanford 27, Wash
ington State 26.
Obviously saving their Sunday
punch for the big one next week,
the Cards were anything but fired
up. Too much of the time they
looked as if they just didn't care.
Lloyd Merriman watched most of
the game from the bench. Marchie
was just making sure that Lloyd
would be around and ready for that
cross - bay jaunt next Saturday
morning.
The Cougar had something up its
sleeve. The long prayer passes by
205-pound Gordy Brunswick were
always a scoring threat, and his
running was dangerous.' Phil Sor
boe's unconventional offense was
confusing, and the Cougar's defen
sive formations were baffling. They
lined up in everything from a o-5-
2-1 to a 7-2-2-1 defense.
The less said about that first
