A standing ovation from ap
proximately 3,000 students at
eight Bay Area colleges including
.'lftO from Stanford greeted Pierre
Monteux as he appeared to con
duct the San Francisco Symphony
for the first of this season's Thurs
day student concerts.
Howard Skinner, manager of the
Symphony, pioneered in schedul
ing special series which is without
parallel in the history of the ma
jor symphony orchestras of this
country.
The students' response to the
program which featured the
Brahms' third symphony and Ha
vel's "Daphnis and Chloc" suite
was enthusiastic and appreciative.
This may he an indication that
should a similar series he arrang
ed for next year, the entire .'{.200
seats in the Opera House will be
taken by the colleges.
