# Coal Check Under Way
## 
### 
PITTSBURGH. Nov. 17 (UP).—
The nation's steel industry was tak
ing final inventories of its fuel sup
plies tonight and made tentative
plans to curtail operations to con
serve coal in the face of the threat
ened mine shutdown by John L.
Lewis' United Mine Workers.
With coal inventories generally
below normal because of a heavy
rise in demand by industry in gen
eral, the steel companies plan for a
gradual shutdown of operations in
the event of a strike to permit more
economical operation of coke ovens
and blast furnaces.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 (UP).
—President Truman has deter
mined that the time has come lo
decide whether the government
or John L. Lewis is the more
powerful and has committed the
Administration to slug it out with
the coal miners' boss, a high offi
cial said today.
That disclosure of Mr. Truman's
attitude came as Secretary of the
Interior J. A. Krug went over
Lewis' head with a notice to the
rank and file of the United Mine
Workers (AFL) that they were
expected to remain at work under
their contract with the govern
ment.

''A coal strike would sharply cur
tail steel operations within a week,"
a spokesman for the U.S. Steel Cor
poration said.
'"Steel producers have not been
able to build up normal coal sup
plies since the 59-day suspension of
mining last spring. Nearly all mills
will be forced to reduce output im
mediately in the event of a general
walkout at the mines," the spokes
man said.
In Detroit spokesmen for the au
tomotive industry reported that a
coal strike and its resultant loss of
steel would have an immediate ef
fect on production of automobiles.
