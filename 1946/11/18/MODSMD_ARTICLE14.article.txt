## 
### 
Written surveys will be distrib
uted today on the advisability
of a Student Union as a war memo
-1 rial. The surveys will be distributed
i to 400 students in proportion to liv—
! ing areas, and the results of thus
; poll will greatly influence plans for
! a Stanford War Memorial.
Living groups will distribute sur
veys to their members, and 126 sur
| veys will be given to off-campus
| students in front of the Union
| Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
I by Roble women.
"It is hoped," announced Stu
j dent Union Chairman Patty Whit
| temore, "that only people who
think seriously about the project
will fill out and return the sur
| veys." The surveys arc to here
; turned by Wednesday evening,
and the results of the poll wi.l be
announced at the Excom meet
in? Wednesday night.
The following is a copy of the
; survey to be distributed:
"This survey is being taken to de
termine .student opinion on the most
immediate needs of the University.
"A new Student Union, to be built
| as a war memorial or by separately
; created funds, has been proposed.
A committee appointed by Dr. Tres
j idder is now at work considering a
war memorial project, and there-
I suits of this survey will be made
■ available to that committee.
! "In considering the needs of the
i University, these facts appear per
: tinent. Any project undertaken now
| will not be finished for several years
! and will have to serve that func
tion for many years after that time.
I A working estimate of the Stanford
student body size for the next few
i years is about 5.000, a third of whom
j will be graduate students.
"1. In light of these considera
tions do you feel the most imme
diate need at Stanford is a Stu
dent Union or some other build
ing or project?
"2. If you choose a Student
Union, what facilities do you think
should he included in the Union,
remembering that the facilities of
a new Union will he limited by
the funds available?
If you answered 'some other
| building or project,' what would
you prefer, and why do you con-
I sidcr this the most essential proj
' cct?
"1. Whether this project is built
by memorial funds or already ex
isting funds, it will he necessary
to supplement this amount lo a
; considerable extent. What addi
tional methods of obtaining the
money can you suggest?"
