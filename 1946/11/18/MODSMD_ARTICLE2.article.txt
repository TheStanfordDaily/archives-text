# Atomic Bombs Can Be Worse
## 
### 
PRINCETON. N. J.. Nov. 17 (UP).
—Atomic bombs can now be made
far more cheaply, and with more
destructive force than those which
blasted Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Albert Einstein and eight other sci
entists asserted today in appealing
for a $1,000,000 atomic energy edu
cation fund.
The present cost of making an
atomic bomb was estimated at $1,-
000,000 to $2,000,000 by Dr. Harold
C. Urey, vice-chairman of the emer
gency committee of atomic scientists
which was recently incorporated to
raise the national educational fund.
The scientists, in a joint state
ment, listed five facts "accepted by
all scientists" in addition to mass,
reduced cost of bomb production
with which the committee intends
to acquaint the American public.
These points were:
There is no military defense
against the atomic bomb and none
is to be expected.
Other nations can rediscover our
secret processes by themselves.
Preparedness against atomic war
is futile, if attempted will ruin the
structure of our social order.
If war breaks out, atomic bombs
will be used and they will surely
destroy our civilization.
There is no solution to this prob
lem except international control of
atomic energy, and ultimately, the
elimination of war.
