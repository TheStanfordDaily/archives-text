## Union—A Fitting Memorial? 
### 
A survey, drav/n up after careful considera
tion and research by the Student Union Com
mittee, will be answered by 400 students today
and tomorrow to serve as a guide for future
action by the Committee and those who will
determine the use of the War Memorial Fund.
Since last spring, we have heard increasing
talk ■'bout the desirability of a large Union on
campus, until it is assumed by most students
that the Union is the foremost candidate for
memorial funds.
Alternative suggestions have been volun
teered by siudents through random discussion
and campus opinion letters. Several of them
back up the Stanford International Survey
which Excom initiated Wednesday night, and
would further Stanford's efforts to educate its
students along lines of international thought.
They are listed below.
War Memorial professorships, in interna
tional relations, and an international institute
to educate future statesmen and broaden the
base of average student thought have been
proposed. An international house in which
American and foreign students would live to
gether to match and exchange their ideologies
is a third suggestion. The money could go to
finance exchange undergraduate scholarships
with universities in Asia, South America and
Europe. Or it could be used to extend the pro
gram for summer travel abroad with the un
derstanding that the whole student body
would benefit through published reports and
assemblies from the experiences of those chos
en to make the trips.
All of these suggestions are made with the
fundamental purpose of better educating the
student body to an understanding of world
problems, and as a working memorial to fur
ther international peace.
Stanford's special delivery man, Mr. Chips,
has gained supporters for his request that the
funds be used for an enlarged post office, but
he has agreed that an adequate post office
could be included in the Union. Some students
have pointed out the need for improved facili
ties in the Stanford Medical School in San
francisco, and ask that the funds be spent
there. Heard also have been requests that the
money be used to retain at, and secure for,
Stanford leading professors in the face of
financial competition from other universities.
Despite this unfinished list of alternative
proposals, the Union has garnered many sup
porters. They state that the Union would be a
tangible memorial to war dead, supplying a
needed gathering place for a much-scattered
student body and a diversion from "highway"
activities. Such facilities as a large ballroom,

rooms for visitors, an enlarged Cellar, bowling
alleys, and reading rooms might be included
in the Union.
According to Patty Whittemore, Union ;
Committee chairman, plans will continue for
the Union if supported by student opinion i
whether or not it is awarded the War Memorial i
Fund. Results of the poll will be presented to I
the War Memorial Committee; if a Union is
selected, at least five years and probably more
will be necessary before the Union is erected.
Meanwhile University Architect Eldredge !
Spencer has blueprints in his office for a re- j
vised and expanded group of Union buildings
and student body offices, to be undertaken !
sometime in the future.
Opinion pro and con the building of a |
Union is seemingly consolidated by these ar
guments:
1) PRO: "The University is reaching such
a size, in stature as well as physically, that it
now needs a central building around which to
build its social functions as well as to take care
of the numerous visitors to the campus. Addi
tional recreational facilities are needed on
campus to counteract the present scattering of
the student body as to residence, and to en- j
courage an interest in on-campus activity.
"The educational benefits of a central
meeting-place exist in the mingling of students !
and their ideas. Present student body commit
tee rooms and offices are inadequate, and a
sufficiently large ballroom does not exist on
campus. Several student activities (e.g., Chap
arral and Daily) for years have been housed in
'temporary' buildings, and could donate their
building funds to an all-inclusive Union build
ing."
2) CON: "Stanford would be merely per
petuating its ivory tower existence by foster
ing a Union to serve only its own students and
by passing up the opportunity to serve world
peace. As a residence university, Stanford
will always have the living group as its central
social unit, leaving the Union relatively un
used. A Union would take too long to build.
"The present facilities have not been thor
oughly investigated for maximum use. When
the present upswing in enrollment is over,
they will be completely sufficient for student
needs."
Only four hundred students will be privi
leged to answer the survey. Therefore, it must
not be filled out indiscriminately, but with
great regard for the best interests of all stu
dents. The question before those to be inter
viewed is "Will a student Union be a living
and fitting memorial to those who died in the
second World War?"

2) CON: "Stanford would be merely per
petuating its ivory tower existence by foster
ing a Union to serve only its own students and
by passing up the opportunity to serve world
peace. As a residence university, Stanford
will always have the living group as its central
social unit, leaving the Union relatively un
used. A Union would take too long to build.

Only four hundred students will be privi
leged to answer the survey. Therefore, it must
not be filled out indiscriminately, but with
great regard for the best interests of all stu
dents. The question before those to be inter
viewed is "Will a student Union be a living
and fitting memorial to those who died in the
second World War?"
A survey, drav/n up after careful considera
tion and research by the Student Union Com
mittee, will be answered by 400 students today
and tomorrow to serve as a guide for future

determine the use of the War Memorial Fund.
Since last spring, we have heard increasing
talk ■'bout the desirability of a large Union on
campus, until it is assumed by most students
that the Union is the foremost candidate for
memorial funds.
Alternative suggestions have been volun
teered by siudents through random discussion
and campus opinion letters. Several of them
back up the Stanford International Survey
which Excom initiated Wednesday night, and
would further Stanford's efforts to educate its
students along lines of international thought.
They are listed below.
War Memorial professorships, in interna
tional relations, and an international institute
to educate future statesmen and broaden the
base of average student thought have been
proposed. An international house in which
American and foreign students would live to
gether to match and exchange their ideologies
is a third suggestion. The money could go to
finance exchange undergraduate scholarships
with universities in Asia, South America and
Europe. Or it could be used to extend the pro
gram for summer travel abroad with the un
derstanding that the whole student body
would benefit through published reports and
assemblies from the experiences of those chos
en to make the trips.
All of these suggestions are made with the
fundamental purpose of better educating the
student body to an understanding of world
problems, and as a working memorial to fur
ther international peace.
Stanford's special delivery man, Mr. Chips,
has gained supporters for his request that the
funds be used for an enlarged post office, but
he has agreed that an adequate post office
could be included in the Union. Some students
have pointed out the need for improved facili
ties in the Stanford Medical School in San
francisco, and ask that the funds be spent
there. Heard also have been requests that the
money be used to retain at, and secure for,
Stanford leading professors in the face of
financial competition from other universities.
Despite this unfinished list of alternative
proposals, the Union has garnered many sup
porters. They state that the Union would be a
tangible memorial to war dead, supplying a
needed gathering place for a much-scattered
student body and a diversion from "highway"
activities. Such facilities as a large ballroom,

rooms for visitors, an enlarged Cellar, bowling
alleys, and reading rooms might be included
in the Union.
According to Patty Whittemore, Union ;
Committee chairman, plans will continue for
the Union if supported by student opinion i
whether or not it is awarded the War Memorial i
Fund. Results of the poll will be presented to I
the War Memorial Committee; if a Union is
selected, at least five years and probably more
will be necessary before the Union is erected.
Meanwhile University Architect Eldredge !
Spencer has blueprints in his office for a re- j
vised and expanded group of Union buildings
and student body offices, to be undertaken !
sometime in the future.
Opinion pro and con the building of a |
Union is seemingly consolidated by these ar
guments:
1) PRO: "The University is reaching such
a size, in stature as well as physically, that it
now needs a central building around which to
build its social functions as well as to take care
of the numerous visitors to the campus. Addi
tional recreational facilities are needed on
campus to counteract the present scattering of
the student body as to residence, and to en- j
courage an interest in on-campus activity.
"The educational benefits of a central
meeting-place exist in the mingling of students !
and their ideas. Present student body commit
tee rooms and offices are inadequate, and a
sufficiently large ballroom does not exist on
campus. Several student activities (e.g., Chap

Meanwhile University Architect Eldredge !
Spencer has blueprints in his office for a re- j
vised and expanded group of Union buildings
and student body offices, to be undertaken !
sometime in the future.
Opinion pro and con the building of a |
Union is seemingly consolidated by these ar
guments:
1) PRO: "The University is reaching such
a size, in stature as well as physically, that it
now needs a central building around which to
build its social functions as well as to take care
of the numerous visitors to the campus. Addi
tional recreational facilities are needed on
campus to counteract the present scattering of
the student body as to residence, and to en- j
courage an interest in on-campus activity.
"The educational benefits of a central
meeting-place exist in the mingling of students !
and their ideas. Present student body commit
tee rooms and offices are inadequate, and a
sufficiently large ballroom does not exist on
campus. Several student activities (e.g., Chap
arral and Daily) for years have been housed in
'temporary' buildings, and could donate their
building funds to an all-inclusive Union build
ing."
2) CON: "Stanford would be merely per
petuating its ivory tower existence by foster
ing a Union to serve only its own students and
by passing up the opportunity to serve world
peace. As a residence university, Stanford
will always have the living group as its central
social unit, leaving the Union relatively un
used. A Union would take too long to build.
"The present facilities have not been thor
oughly investigated for maximum use. When
the present upswing in enrollment is over,
they will be completely sufficient for student
needs."
Only four hundred students will be privi
leged to answer the survey. Therefore, it must
not be filled out indiscriminately, but with
great regard for the best interests of all stu
dents. The question before those to be inter
viewed is "Will a student Union be a living
and fitting memorial to those who died in the
second World War?"
A survey, drav/n up after careful considera
tion and research by the Student Union Com
mittee, will be answered by 400 students today
and tomorrow to serve as a guide for future
action by the Committee and those who will
determine the use of the War Memorial Fund.
Since last spring, we have heard increasing
talk ■'bout the desirability of a large Union on
campus, until it is assumed by most students
that the Union is the foremost candidate for
memorial funds.
Alternative suggestions have been volun
teered by siudents through random discussion
and campus opinion letters. Several of them
back up the Stanford International Survey
which Excom initiated Wednesday night, and
would further Stanford's efforts to educate its
students along lines of international thought.
They are listed below.
War Memorial professorships, in interna
tional relations, and an international institute
to educate future statesmen and broaden the
base of average student thought have been
proposed. An international house in which
American and foreign students would live to
gether to match and exchange their ideologies
is a third suggestion. The money could go to
finance exchange undergraduate scholarships
with universities in Asia, South America and
Europe. Or it could be used to extend the pro
gram for summer travel abroad with the un
derstanding that the whole student body
would benefit through published reports and
assemblies from the experiences of those chos
en to make the trips.
All of these suggestions are made with the
fundamental purpose of better educating the
student body to an understanding of world
problems, and as a working memorial to fur
ther international peace.
Stanford's special delivery man, Mr. Chips,
has gained supporters for his request that the
funds be used for an enlarged post office, but
he has agreed that an adequate post office
could be included in the Union. Some students
have pointed out the need for improved facili
ties in the Stanford Medical School in San
francisco, and ask that the funds be spent
there. Heard also have been requests that the
money be used to retain at, and secure for,
Stanford leading professors in the face of
financial competition from other universities.
Despite this unfinished list of alternative
proposals, the Union has garnered many sup
porters. They state that the Union would be a
tangible memorial to war dead, supplying a
needed gathering place for a much-scattered
student body and a diversion from "highway"
activities. Such facilities as a large ballroom,

rooms for visitors, an enlarged Cellar, bowling
alleys, and reading rooms might be included
in the Union.
According to Patty Whittemore, Union ;
Committee chairman, plans will continue for
the Union if supported by student opinion i
whether or not it is awarded the War Memorial i
Fund. Results of the poll will be presented to I
the War Memorial Committee; if a Union is
selected, at least five years and probably more
will be necessary before the Union is erected.
