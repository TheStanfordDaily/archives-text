# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
I strode briskly into the Shack and stalked into
my office, looking as scholastic as possible.
There was a little girl sitting there.
"I'm back," I announced, turning my best profile
to the light.
She chewed vigorously on her bubble gum.
"I'm back," I repeated a little louder.
"Who are you?" she said, blowing a very large
bubble.
"Why, I'm Coughlin," I said, and there was a
trumpet flourish offstage left.
"Who?'' inquired my small friend.
"Coughlin," I said. "I write Bull Session."
"Oh." she said, and birded into the wastebasket.
"I'm back," I pointed out again.
"Been somewhere?" she asked.
"Certainly," I said. "I haven't written a column
for a whole week and now I'm going to start again.'
"Well, we can't win 'em all," she shrugged.
"Where ya been?"
"Studying," I said.
"YcYah? You probably been drunk all week."
"No, honest. Two times two is four. Four times
four is 16. Sixteen times 16 is the first ten amend
ments form the Bill of Rights and William the Con
queror landed in 1056. See?"
"In 1066," she said, and blew a very large bubble.
I wiped the gum ofT the end of my nose, kicked
her in the face, and threw her into a nearby rotary

press. Then I went over to the mirror.
"I'm back," I said to my reflection.
"Doggone if you're not. Gee, it's sure good to
see you again," said my reflection. "Sure have
missed your column. It's really fine to have you
back."
"Thank you," I said and smiled modestly. I re
turned to my desk, dusted off my typewriter, and
with a smug smile settled down to give the world the
benefit of my genius. But something was sticking to
the seat of my pants. I s,tood up and looked in the
chair. i
Bubble gum!
>h * *
Seems to have been quite a week that I missed.
Rally Com admitted defeat and didn't even try to
hold a rally. One of the Daily staff got his tooth
broken off when a drive-in girl shoved a tray in
his face. And the best football game in the stadium
Saturday was played between the halves! Indeed an
amazing week.

There is now another girl in my office. She just
pulled her dress about three feet over her head. Of
course, she's only about thiee years old but after
years of association with Stanford women, an unin
hibited act like that can really unnerve a man. I'm
getting out of here and going back to the books.
Hmm, wonder if it really was 1066? •

"Studying," I said.
"YcYah? You probably been drunk all week."
"No, honest. Two times two is four. Four times
four is 16. Sixteen times 16 is the first ten amend
ments form the Bill of Rights and William the Con
queror landed in 1056. See?"
"In 1066," she said, and blew a very large bubble.
I wiped the gum ofT the end of my nose, kicked
her in the face, and threw her into a nearby rotary

press. Then I went over to the mirror.
"I'm back," I said to my reflection.
"Doggone if you're not. Gee, it's sure good to
see you again," said my reflection. "Sure have
missed your column. It's really fine to have you
back."
"Thank you," I said and smiled modestly. I re
turned to my desk, dusted off my typewriter, and
with a smug smile settled down to give the world the
benefit of my genius. But something was sticking to
the seat of my pants. I s,tood up and looked in the
chair. i
Bubble gum!

Seems to have been quite a week that I missed.
Rally Com admitted defeat and didn't even try to
hold a rally. One of the Daily staff got his tooth
broken off when a drive-in girl shoved a tray in
his face. And the best football game in the stadium
Saturday was played between the halves! Indeed an
amazing week.

There is now another girl in my office. She just
pulled her dress about three feet over her head. Of
course, she's only about thiee years old but after
years of association with Stanford women, an unin
hibited act like that can really unnerve a man. I'm
getting out of here and going back to the books.
Hmm, wonder if it really was 1066? •
I strode briskly into the Shack and stalked into
my office, looking as scholastic as possible.
There was a little girl sitting there.
"I'm back," I announced, turning my best profile
to the light.
She chewed vigorously on her bubble gum.
"I'm back," I repeated a little louder.
"Who are you?" she said, blowing a very large
bubble.
"Why, I'm Coughlin," I said, and there was a
trumpet flourish offstage left.
"Who?'' inquired my small friend.
"Coughlin," I said. "I write Bull Session."
"Oh." she said, and birded into the wastebasket.
"I'm back," I pointed out again.
"Been somewhere?" she asked.
"Certainly," I said. "I haven't written a column
for a whole week and now I'm going to start again.'
"Well, we can't win 'em all," she shrugged.
"Where ya been?"
"Studying," I said.
"YcYah? You probably been drunk all week."
"No, honest. Two times two is four. Four times
four is 16. Sixteen times 16 is the first ten amend
ments form the Bill of Rights and William the Con
queror landed in 1056. See?"
