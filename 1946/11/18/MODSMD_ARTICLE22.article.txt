# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
If you noticed that some of the sophomores on
the football team were slightly lethargic Saturday,
don't blame the boys themselves
Chalk it up to one of the more pleasant traditions
oi college life—"Hell Week." Some of them have
been through this informal initiation period for the
past few days. Others are still in the preparatory
stages of hazing and will get their "hell" in a few
more weeks.
Despite the fact that all of the fraternities—or
their representatives in Interfraternity Council—last
spring agreed that there would be no more "Hell
Week" at Stanford and no further beating of pledges,
a lew of the more "manly"—or is the word "child
i.h" houses have continued the practice.
To cite an example, one particular house put a

group of pledges through such a period of beatings,
sleepless nights, and absurd exercises last spring
during track season. One of the trackmen benefited
from this period of playful recreation to the extent
that instead of winning his event in an important
me"t that weekend, he was not even able to place.
This house has so much school spirit that they
have been doing the same thing to a couple of mem
bers of the football team during the past few days.
This is not a condemnation of fraternities by any
means, but it is a condemnation of those few houses
wlpeh may be endangering the freedom, or even the
existence, of fraternity life at Stanford by their asi
nine conduct.
