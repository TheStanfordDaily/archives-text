# Gaels Rip Broncos; Wedy Hot
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 17 (UP).
â€”Herman Wedemeyer, St. Mary's
College's one-man football team,
came back from his early 0-13 defi
cit to turn back a determined Santa
Clara eleven, 28-19, in a wild grid
game watched by 57,000 fans in Ke
zar Stadium today.
Coach Jim Phelan kept Squirmin'
Herman, the Hawaiian hurricane, on
the bench during the first period
and while he was there the Broncos
ran up a 13-0 edge on the Gaels'
second stringers.
But when Wedemeyer and
quarterback Dennis O'Connor
went into the game at the start of
the second period, it was a differ
ent story. In 12 minutes of play
Wedy was mainly responsible for
21 points and enough to tuck the
game away.
HERMAN TAKES OVER
The first time he got his hands on
the ball he went 12 yards around
end; the second time he passed 23
to end John Johnson, and the third
time into the end zone to end Ed
Ryan. He then kicked the extra
point.
Three minutes later Wedemeyer
took the ball on his own 23-yard
line, out around end, eluded a trio
of would-be taeklers and squirmed
07 yards for a touchdown without
interference.
With three minutes to go before
the half he passed from the 21 to
halfback Paul Crowe on the one
yard line and from there freshman
lull Willie Modroin plunged over
for the counter.
WEDY WAS BRILLIANT
It was a brilliant performance
for the All-American halfback
and he added further to it by com
ing back in the fourth quarter to
spark another touchdown drive.
This time he set up the scoring by
skirting end for 16 yards to the
Santa Clara fourteen. From there
he hung onto the ball while fak
ing half a dozen passes, then calm
ly handed the pigskin to Crowe,
who trotted through the scattered
Bronco defenses unmolested for a
touchdown.
Coach Len Casanova's team was
a powerhouse on the field when
Wedemeyer and O'Connor were on
the bench. With A 1 Martin, a fresh
man quarterback, in the starring
role, they took to the air and went
on a 51-yard march early in the first
period, with Martin rambling 10
yards for the touchdown.
The Broncos made it 13-0 in the
first period of the second quarter
after a 33-yard ground attack, with
Martin again hitting pay dirt.
The game was characterized by
over-eagerness which resulted in
three cases of pass interference be
ing called, and a fist fight near the
end of the game that sent two play
ers to the sidelines.
