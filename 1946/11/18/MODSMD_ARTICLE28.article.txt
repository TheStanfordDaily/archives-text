# Stamm Points For 'Little Big Game'
## 
### 
Just five more practice days 'till
Cal! All year Coach Ed Stamm and
his Stanford Jayvees have been
pointing for those cocky Cal Ram
blers. Next Saturday's traditional
Little Big Game will find the Card
Juniors more than just a little fired
up, and more than just a little will
ing to knock the Ramblers clear out
of Strawberry Canyon. The game
will be played as a preliminary to
ihe Stanford-Cal game in the Ber
keley Memorial Stadium.
The Jayvees enjoyed four days of
hard work last week. The first
stringers worked out against the
Varsity, helping Marchie Schwartz
ve\ ready for Washington State. The
reserves scrimmaged among them
selves. Among the reserves show
ing promise in last week's workout
were fullback Wes Fry, who stood
out as a linebacker, and did some
nice running. Buck Thompson
worked well at halfback.
Frank Brooks looked good at the
pivot post, Roger Bowles turned in
a good job at guard, as did tackle
Jack Bratt; ends A 1 Kirscher and
Frank la√ürohme are wingmen de
serving of special mention.
Stamm has five more hard prac
tice sessions scheduled before the
team ventures over to Berkeley.
There will be lots of work on signal
drills, passing, and pass defense.
