# Yankees Decision Forty-Niners, 10-9
## 
### 
NEW YORK. Nov. 17 (UP).—The
New York Yankees won the eastern
division championship of the All-
American Football Conference to
day when they came from behind
with a fourth-period touchdown to
nose out the San Francisco 49'ers
10 to 9.
The triumph, coupled with Brook
lyn's 19 to 14 defeat by Los Angeles,
assured the Yankees of a playoff
berth against the western division
winner although they still have
three games to play.
Harvey Johnson's 25th consecu
tive conversion of the season—he
hasn't missed one all year—proved
the margin of victory. His unerring
toe earlier had accounted for a field
goal.
The game was played on a muddy
gridiron and in steady rain which
kept the crowd in Yankee Stadium
down to 18(195 paid.
