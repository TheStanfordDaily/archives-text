# Bears Wallop Indian Harriers
## 
### 
At Berkeley, Saturday, Coach
Jack Weirshauser's Indian cross
country team ran intdk an impassa
l.ie, undefeated California outfit and
a rain-drenched course; the result
was a decisive 20 to 39 trouncing for
the Farm thinclads. The Bears'
frosh harrier sensation, Dan Sea
mount, led the pack all the way to
the tape, finishing with the unim
pressive time of 22 minutes 2 sec
onds.
Stanford's first man in was Al
onzo Lyons, who placed fourth.
Other men who placed for (he
Cardinals were Frank Ganahl,
fifth; Gordon Johnson, seventh;
George Grimes, twelfth, and John
FigK-Hohlyn. thirteenth.
Saturday's disastrous affair was
the first time that the Indians had
run a four-mile course, tor all pre
vious Card meets have been of the
three-mile variety. As the meet
started, rain began to fall, and with
in a lew moments the course, a clay
surfaced mountain road, became a
slippery, treacherous morass; the
times, consequently, were quite poor
and showed little one way or the
other.
