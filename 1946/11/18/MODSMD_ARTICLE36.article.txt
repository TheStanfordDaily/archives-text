# Cardinal Mermen Clinch Title
## 
### 
It took two overtime periods and
some rifle-like shots by Harry Bor
chers for the Indian water polo team
to down a scrappy underdog UCLA
squad before 300 spectators, Friday
afternoon in the Encina Pool, 7-5.
The victory cinched the confer
ence crown for the Stanford nata
: tors, and left only one contest on
the schedule—the Big Game against
; Cal this week-end.
With the starting Card seven rest
ing on the sidelines in preparation
for the Cal match, the Uclans moved
j into the lead early in the first quar
ter, 2-0. Scores by Ernest and On
es! i tied things as the quarter ended.
The second period saw the Indians
j take over the scoring parade as
j Narver and Lull tallied and sent the
Cards winging away, 4-2.
In the fourth quarter with the
i scoreboard reading 5-3 in favor of
| the local mermen the Bruins began
j tearing up the watercress patch.
Sparked by the sensational sprint
; work of Davis and the passing of
Blanchard. the Los Angeles version
of the "Gold-Dust Twins," the
j Uclans managed to advance the ball
; into Stanford territory. Shots by
' Hulbert and Cozens rang the bell,
and that tied up the ball game at
j five all.
The first overtime saw the regular
j starters enter the fray, but the Car
\ dinals seemed a bit baffled and the
I attack stalled without a score.

The opening sprint of the second <
overtime was won by Cashin for the
Red Machine, the first captured by
Stanford since the first half had
ended. Shots by Narver and Bor
chers were stopped by Nixon the
UCLA All-Coast goalie. But Stan
ford, in the person of Borchers
would not be denied. A rifle heave
by Mr. B hit the mark and the In
dians were ahead, 6-5.
The sprint after the score was won
by Davis, but the pass back was in
tercepted—and that was the game
as Borchers powered another fling
into the goal to fix the conference
laurels securely on the Indian's
head.
