# Shavian Caesar Comes to Screen
## 
### GEORGE MOORE 
Bernard Shaw sure took somebody lor a ride when he adapted
his play "Caesar and Cleopatra" for Gabriel Pascal to bring to
the screen starring Vivien Leigh and Claude Rains.
The 90-year-old boy wonder apparently cast sly sidelong
glances at Plutarch and Shakespeare while nudging the audience j

disrespectfully in the ribs. As a
movie, "Caesar and Cleopatra" is
little more than an expensive ve
hicle for a good deal of Shavian wit
and dexterous manipulation of his
tory passing for plot.
SUPERSPECTACLE
The publicity agents have her
alded it as a superspectacle of brute
passion along the steaming Nile with
the result that a good bit of the
charm and appeal of the film is al
most lost in the splendor of the sets.
It all shows that sometimes four
million dollars and a technicolor
camera can be too much of a good
thing.
The greater part of the picture
is broad farce and sly innuendo un
til Cleopatra begins plotting treach
ery with the Egyptian nurse whose
name wo can't pronounce and
wouldn't dare try to spell. But
through the action leading to the
sinister activities, we expected to
see Groucho Marx or Bob Hope
dart out from under a papyrus plant
and take a rightful place in the cast.
As Caesar with a lifted eyebrow,
a gift of gab, an unfathomable mor
al consciousness and an unbeatable
military strategy, Claude Rains does
his finest job we've seen. His main
task was to play Caesar as Shaw
created him; as a proud conqueror
who congratulates the Sphinx on
being as great as himself and as a
delighted practical joker who shows
the maiden Cleopatra how to con
duct herself as a queen.
CLEOPATRA 0'IIARA
Vivien Leigh shows how Scarlett
O'Hara would have reacted had
Scarlett been both less shrewd and
queen of Egypt. As far as we could
tell Shaw's Cleopatra is a credible
forerunner of Shakespeare's hero
ine of "Antony and Cleopatra."
Though of course not as many-sided
as Caesar, Miss Leigh is no less
fascinating as a little girl who learns
the meaning of being a queen and
develops a mind of her own.
The supporting cast is generally
excellent. The most obvious fea
ture player is Stewart Granger as
a Sicilian soldier of fortune who at
taches himself to the royal menage
of Alexandria. We wondered how
Cleopatra could keep her hungry
hands off him but we were reas
sured by the final scene which
showed her leaning comfortably
against him as she flaps her skirt
at the departing Romans.
Flora Robson is terrifyingly won
derful as Cleopatra's duenna. The
visual contrast between the two
females is really horrible but Miss
Robson's acting anything but. In
fact it's very fine.
IRISH ROMAN
A purely Shavian touch is the
character of Britannicus, a British
captive whom Caesar keeps as per- \
sonal secretary and confidant. Only !
an Irishman could have created
such an individual to represent <
Victorian England drifting around :
ancient Alexandria. Pie is the big
gest kick of the picture.
"Caesar and Cleopatra" will be
shown at the Stanford Theater this
week.

alded it as a superspectacle of brute
passion along the steaming Nile with
the result that a good bit of the
charm and appeal of the film is al
most lost in the splendor of the sets.
It all shows that sometimes four
million dollars and a technicolor
camera can be too much of a good
thing.
The greater part of the picture
is broad farce and sly innuendo un
til Cleopatra begins plotting treach
ery with the Egyptian nurse whose
name wo can't pronounce and
wouldn't dare try to spell. But
through the action leading to the
sinister activities, we expected to
see Groucho Marx or Bob Hope
dart out from under a papyrus plant
and take a rightful place in the cast.
As Caesar with a lifted eyebrow,
a gift of gab, an unfathomable mor
al consciousness and an unbeatable
military strategy, Claude Rains does
his finest job we've seen. His main
task was to play Caesar as Shaw
created him; as a proud conqueror
who congratulates the Sphinx on
being as great as himself and as a
delighted practical joker who shows
the maiden Cleopatra how to con
duct herself as a queen.
CLEOPATRA 0'IIARA
Vivien Leigh shows how Scarlett
O'Hara would have reacted had
Scarlett been both less shrewd and
queen of Egypt. As far as we could
tell Shaw's Cleopatra is a credible
forerunner of Shakespeare's hero
ine of "Antony and Cleopatra."
Though of course not as many-sided
as Caesar, Miss Leigh is no less
fascinating as a little girl who learns
the meaning of being a queen and
develops a mind of her own.
The supporting cast is generally
excellent. The most obvious fea
ture player is Stewart Granger as
a Sicilian soldier of fortune who at
taches himself to the royal menage
of Alexandria. We wondered how
Cleopatra could keep her hungry
hands off him but we were reas
sured by the final scene which
showed her leaning comfortably
against him as she flaps her skirt
at the departing Romans.
Flora Robson is terrifyingly won
derful as Cleopatra's duenna. The
visual contrast between the two
females is really horrible but Miss
Robson's acting anything but. In
fact it's very fine.
IRISH ROMAN
A purely Shavian touch is the
character of Britannicus, a British
captive whom Caesar keeps as per- \
sonal secretary and confidant. Only !
an Irishman could have created
such an individual to represent <
Victorian England drifting around :
ancient Alexandria. Pie is the big
gest kick of the picture.
"Caesar and Cleopatra" will be
shown at the Stanford Theater this
week.
Bernard Shaw sure took somebody lor a ride when he adapted
his play "Caesar and Cleopatra" for Gabriel Pascal to bring to
the screen starring Vivien Leigh and Claude Rains.
The 90-year-old boy wonder apparently cast sly sidelong
glances at Plutarch and Shakespeare while nudging the audience j

disrespectfully in the ribs. As a
movie, "Caesar and Cleopatra" is
little more than an expensive ve
hicle for a good deal of Shavian wit
and dexterous manipulation of his
tory passing for plot.
