# Gaieties Hold Full Rehearsal
## 
### GEORGE ECKSTEIN 
Yesterday afternoon the Big Game
Gaieties had its first rehearsal with
the orchestra. The happiness, gleÂ«,
and excited comments floating
around the Memorial Auditorium
indicate that this will be the great
est Gaieties of all time, and they're
not kidding.

Gaieties tickets go on sale to
day and tomorrow from 8 to 5 at
the History corner. They can also
he obtained Wednesday, Thurs
day and Friday from !) to 5 in the
A.S.S.U. office. All seals are re
served at prices of 55 cents, 85
cents, and Si. 15. Curtain times
arc at 8:15 Wednesday and Fri
day nights and 2:30 at the Friday
matinee.

As Director Bob Ashley says,
"There are laughs a million, thrills
a minute, songs a score, ancl costs
not much." The orchestra under
the direction of Art McCue sounds
at the first rehearsal like it has
been playing the Gaieties' songs
from childhood. They're that good.
The vocalists are outstanding, and
their material is equally as good.
The skits are well written, excel
lently directed, and hilariously act
ed. All in all this is a show that
mustn't be missed. For confirma
tion see the Gaieties either Wed
nesday, Friday afternoon, or Fri
day night.
There will be a dress rehearsal
tonight. The entire cast is to report
to the Auditorium at 6:45. The
make-up crew is also due at this
time.
