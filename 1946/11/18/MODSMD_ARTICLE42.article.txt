## 
### 
In order to avoid any misun
derstanding of his attitude to
ward Robert 11. Scott of Palo Aito
who made a talk on atheism over
KQW yesterday morning. Visit
ing Chaplain George .1. Hall made
the following statement:
"Although I disagree with the
doctrine Mr. Scott put forth on his
broadcast. I feel that he had ev
ery right to speak his mind as
does every citizen. A free radio
is as important to America as a
free press. My sentiments were
expressed best by Voltaire when
he said. 'Though I may despise
what you say, I shall defend to
the death your right to say it'."
