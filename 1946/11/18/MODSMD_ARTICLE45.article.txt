# 'Dig 'Em a Grave'--- Lies in Stadium Past
## 
### DAN PAGE 
All those empty seats at last Saturday's game made the Stan
ford Stadium look awful big. And it is. It's the biggest college
stadium in the country. Fact is there are only two municipal
ones which can top our 90,000 seating capacity. Chicago's Sol
diers' Field seats 110,000 and the good old L.A. Coliseum han
dles 101,000.
Our massive sunken bowl stands as tribute to the spirit and

j accomplishment of the men who
built it. Six months after the first
' subscription campaign was initiated,
Stanford's football team scored the
I dedicating touchdown in the open
! ing five plays of the 1921 Big Game.
! The on-campus drive for funds was
i oversubscribed by almost half. The
j financial meeting was held on Wed
nesday, May 25, 1921—the following
I Wednesday the ground was broken,
j SPADE YELL
At that time it was planned that
I the spade used would take the place
of the Axe as an athletic symbol.
For the occasion Rally Com, or
somebody, dreamed up a new ''Axe
Yell." To wit:
Dig. dig-dig; dig-dig; dig-dig.
Dig. dig-dig; dig-dig; dig-dig.
j Dig 'em a grave, a grave, a grave.

Which undoubtedly explains why

ORIGINALLY SEATED <>0.000
As originally finished at a cost of
[ $204,000. the stadium was a sunken
horseshoe, open at the south end
and seating 00.000. They just dug a

hole 23 feet deep and piled the dirt
around the edge. Then they graded
the slopes, put up seats inside and
trees outside, and started selling
tickets.
In 1925 the south end was round
ed out to provide another 12.000
seats. The dirt for this came from
a pit off to one side. That's why we
have a sunken baseball diamond.
COMPLETED IN l!) 28
In 1928 the wood and gummed -
cement superstructure was added,
bringing the seating up to the pres
ent 90.000. It has been the same
ever since, except for new sents, and
an $11,000 paint job last summer.
So, there she stands—the third
largest stadium in the country. And
next Saturday we all leap on our
pogo sticks and trot up to a dinky
little place in the hills that only
seats a measly 80,175 counting the
press box. Poor Cal.

ORIGINALLY SEATED <>0.000
As originally finished at a cost of
[ $204,000. the stadium was a sunken
horseshoe, open at the south end
and seating 00.000. They just dug a

hole 23 feet deep and piled the dirt
around the edge. Then they graded
the slopes, put up seats inside and
trees outside, and started selling
tickets.
In 1925 the south end was round
ed out to provide another 12.000
seats. The dirt for this came from
a pit off to one side. That's why we
have a sunken baseball diamond.
COMPLETED IN l!) 28
In 1928 the wood and gummed -
cement superstructure was added,
bringing the seating up to the pres
ent 90.000. It has been the same
ever since, except for new sents, and
an $11,000 paint job last summer.
So, there she stands—the third
largest stadium in the country. And
next Saturday we all leap on our
pogo sticks and trot up to a dinky
little place in the hills that only
seats a measly 80,175 counting the
press box. Poor Cal.
All those empty seats at last Saturday's game made the Stan
ford Stadium look awful big. And it is. It's the biggest college
stadium in the country. Fact is there are only two municipal
ones which can top our 90,000 seating capacity. Chicago's Sol
diers' Field seats 110,000 and the good old L.A. Coliseum han
dles 101,000.
Our massive sunken bowl stands as tribute to the spirit and

j accomplishment of the men who
built it. Six months after the first
' subscription campaign was initiated,
Stanford's football team scored the
