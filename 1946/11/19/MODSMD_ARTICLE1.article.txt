# Farm Has One More Day To Fill $9,000 Gap in Relief Goal
## Four Feathers Drive Terminates Today 
### 
Today is the last day for all Stanford residences to turn in their
contributions to the Four Feathers Relief Drive to Elaine Woodin,
drive treasurer, at the Nitery.
These contributions will determine how much nearer Stan
ford students have reached their relief fund goal of 514,000 than

(lie $5,138 which had been turned '
into the drive by last Saturday.
According to Janet Ossinan,
drive chairman, it is expected that
contributions yet to come in from
a majority of Village dormitories j
and a few remaining Row houses
may raise the total to between six
and eight thousand dollars at least.
Elaine Woodin will receive the do- i
nations from 2:30 until 4 p.m. in the :
Nitery. Off-campus students who j
are mailing their contributions in
are urged to do so as soon as possi
ble. Pledges are to be in by Nov. 31.
At this time the final goal reached ;
can be determined.

E<l. Note:—When in a War Bond
Drive last year Stanford gave
000 in an uncxtenderi week-long
drive, the $5,138 given this past week
for a lagging Four Feathers appeal
looks a hit inadequate.
Certainly the excuse cannot he
given that this appeal is less neces
sary, for this money will be used for
peace rather than for war.
Only eight houses have gone 100
per cent and yet it may he said with
conviction that I lie responsibility for
financing peace lies with every
house. Several houses have contrib
uted nothing, and at least eleven
have low percentages.
What excuses have we?

Stanford's Four Feathers drive
was organized and directed by Stan
ford students, and the money given
by the students will go to the char
ity agencies in the following per
centages:
FUND DISTRIBUTION
Community Fund 40 per cent,
World Student Service Fund .'l5
per cent, Inlantile Paralysis JO per

As soon as the final amounts are
turned in, the money will be turned
over to those agencies in those per
centages, stated Janet Ossman.

booth's chairman, and Patty Peter
son, covrespondence chairman.
Joan Law had charge of the ofT
campus committee and was assisted
by Bob Peterson, Bob Ober, and Jack
Seidel.
VILLAGE COLLECTORS
General chairman at the Village
included Richard Ryan, Joe Alford,
and Joan Richards.

Row houses, and Virginia Vernon.
Hilltop House.

STUDENTS THANKED
The relief drive committee wishes
to thank all Stanford students who
contributed their time and money to
the drive.
Today is the last day for all Stanford residences to turn in their
contributions to the Four Feathers Relief Drive to Elaine Woodin,
drive treasurer, at the Nitery.
These contributions will determine how much nearer Stan
ford students have reached their relief fund goal of 514,000 than

(lie $5,138 which had been turned '
into the drive by last Saturday.
According to Janet Ossinan,
drive chairman, it is expected that
contributions yet to come in from
a majority of Village dormitories j
and a few remaining Row houses
may raise the total to between six
and eight thousand dollars at least.
Elaine Woodin will receive the do- i
nations from 2:30 until 4 p.m. in the :
Nitery. Off-campus students who j
are mailing their contributions in
are urged to do so as soon as possi
ble. Pledges are to be in by Nov. 31.
At this time the final goal reached ;
can be determined.

E<l. Note:—When in a War Bond
Drive last year Stanford gave
000 in an uncxtenderi week-long
drive, the $5,138 given this past week
for a lagging Four Feathers appeal
looks a hit inadequate.
Certainly the excuse cannot he
given that this appeal is less neces
sary, for this money will be used for
peace rather than for war.
Only eight houses have gone 100
per cent and yet it may he said with
conviction that I lie responsibility for
financing peace lies with every
house. Several houses have contrib
uted nothing, and at least eleven
have low percentages.
What excuses have we?

Stanford's Four Feathers drive
was organized and directed by Stan
ford students, and the money given
by the students will go to the char
ity agencies in the following per
centages:
FUND DISTRIBUTION
Community Fund 40 per cent,
World Student Service Fund .'l5
per cent, Inlantile Paralysis JO per
cent, and floating fund for emer
gency drives 15 per cent.
As soon as the final amounts are
turned in, the money will be turned
over to those agencies in those per
centages, stated Janet Ossman.
