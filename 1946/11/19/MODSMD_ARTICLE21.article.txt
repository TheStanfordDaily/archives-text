# Farm Ready For Cal Men

j Is yellow your favorite color?
: Would you like lo see the Farm all
• painted yellow? Well, the only rea
j son it isn't, is that bands of intrepid
: frosh have been losing sleep for the
; past three nights, just to protect the
j campus from our little Cal pals.
The campus is being guarded by
| a system of patrol cars and sentries
provided by Encina men, who don't
I intend to permit a repeat perform
j ance of Sunday morning's raid,
j when a Cal task force waited until
! the guards retired and then smeared
i several foul "C's" on the Quad.
NIGHTLY GUARD DUTY
After spending an entire right on
; guard duty, one can well realize
why the visitors from Berkeley are
j not breaking through our defenses.
| Throughout the night Cadillacs
crept stealthily around the Farm
j with lights dimmed. Vigilant roughs
i patrolled the Quad and kept watch
J over our coveted works of archi
tecture, and Gordy's blue - coated
boys co-operated beautifully.
Unidentified cars were either
i chased far off the campus or stop
: ped and thoroughly checked. Chilled
Quad guards rotated with crews of
j the patrol cars, and frequent stops
I were made for hot coffee and ham
! burgers. At no time, however, was
: the campus insufficiently protected.
WARNING SYSTEM
A fool-proof warning system has
been devised, and in a test alarm
300 Encina men were on the Quad
within two minutes.
Several cars, apparently from
Cal, sped up Palm Drive, decided
their job was too hot to handle,
! and lost no time in disappearing in
| the distance. Otherwise, all was
| quiet on the Farm.
! Let's not forget that the week has
I only begun—we may expect more
j invasions by those jeep - driving
peasants.
