# TAKE OFF THAT RED DRESS!
## 
### 
When Joan Frazier, University of
California student, walked past the
huge Bear rooting section Saturday
at Berkeley wearing a brilliant red
dress, the usual "Take Off That Red
Dress" went up. And that's exactly
what Joan did. It was part of a
homecoming clay stunt to "warm"
the Bears for next Saturday's Big
Game with the Indians from Stan
-1 ford.
