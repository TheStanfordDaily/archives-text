# Trans-Bay A Artistic Excursions Add Color to Rival Campuses

Unless Kilroy now spells his name with a "C," there j
j'is evidence on the campus that several University of
California artists have chosen Stanford landmarks as |
worthy of their artistic endeavors.
A huge letter "C" mysteriously appeared in front
of the Hoover War Library entrance. Persons appar- i

ently not schooled in staid Bcrkc
] Icy tradition did the painting. The
letter was scrawled in black paint
| instead of the more plausible blue
or gold.
PALM DRIVE PAINTED
Palm Drive was not neglected.
TrafTic signs displayed splotches of
i blue and gold. Even the pavement
itself showed signs of contact with
ill-handled paint brushes.
Freshmen from Encina have been
I guarding the multi-entranced cam
pus for the past few nights. The
campus policc squad has been in
! creased substantially so that any
more attempts at vandalism can be
! coped with.
PEACE PACT RECALLED
Police Chief Gordv Davis re
called the peace pact to suspend
i pre - Big Game hostilities which
Stanford and California agreed to
in 1942.
"I hope everybody stops and
thinks before further acts of van
dalism are committed, and before
i they consider invading either cam
! pus with intent to mutilate or de
stroy school property."
The pact was decided upon after
inter-campus destruction appeared
to be on the upswing rather than
tapering off Both student bodies
favored such a plan.

Students at the University of California at Berke
ley went to classes Monday morning on a campus that
had broken out in a rash of red. Sorority houses, dor
mitories, and other buildings were painted a bright,
cardinal "S."
Bear student officials have deduced that the red

painting-spice is the work of Stan
ford students.
Gregory Sheehan, chairman of
(he "Bit; C" guard committee, said,
"We make a point of never excit
ing those hot-blooded Indians, hut
if they want war, we'll give it to
them."
The Daily has received anony
mous telephone calls, one of which
claimed that a red "S" was pasted
to the west side of the Cal stadium.
The letter was painted on paper
and the paper tacked to the stadium
walls.
SAT I IKK GATE WELDED
Other reports claim that the
Bears' famous Sather Gate had been
daubed a brilliant red and then the
gate had been welded shut.
California officials claim that the
raids arc in retaliation for the sev
eral yellow "C's" that "somebody"
had painted on the Farm campus.
Among the places that got their
share of red "S's" were the Theta
Upsilon sorority house, the Delta
Tlieta sorority, and Shleman Court.
RAIDING ANTICIPATED
The Cal campus is now agog with
rumors of retaliation, according to
San Francisco papers, and raiding
preliminary to the Big Game this
Saturday is likely to continue.

eral yellow "C's" that "somebody"
had painted on the Farm campus.
Among the places that got their
share of red "S's" were the Theta
Upsilon sorority house, the Delta
Tlieta sorority, and Shleman Court.
RAIDING ANTICIPATED
The Cal campus is now agog with
rumors of retaliation, according to
San Francisco papers, and raiding
preliminary to the Big Game this
Saturday is likely to continue.
Unless Kilroy now spells his name with a "C," there j
j'is evidence on the campus that several University of
California artists have chosen Stanford landmarks as |
worthy of their artistic endeavors.
A huge letter "C" mysteriously appeared in front
of the Hoover War Library entrance. Persons appar- i

ently not schooled in staid Bcrkc
] Icy tradition did the painting. The
letter was scrawled in black paint
| instead of the more plausible blue
or gold.
PALM DRIVE PAINTED
Palm Drive was not neglected.
TrafTic signs displayed splotches of
i blue and gold. Even the pavement
itself showed signs of contact with
ill-handled paint brushes.
Freshmen from Encina have been
I guarding the multi-entranced cam
pus for the past few nights. The
campus policc squad has been in
! creased substantially so that any
more attempts at vandalism can be
! coped with.
PEACE PACT RECALLED
Police Chief Gordv Davis re
called the peace pact to suspend
i pre - Big Game hostilities which
Stanford and California agreed to
in 1942.
"I hope everybody stops and
thinks before further acts of van
dalism are committed, and before
i they consider invading either cam
! pus with intent to mutilate or de
stroy school property."
The pact was decided upon after
inter-campus destruction appeared
to be on the upswing rather than
tapering off Both student bodies
favored such a plan.

Students at the University of California at Berke
ley went to classes Monday morning on a campus that
had broken out in a rash of red. Sorority houses, dor
mitories, and other buildings were painted a bright,
cardinal "S."
Bear student officials have deduced that the red

painting-spice is the work of Stan
ford students.
Gregory Sheehan, chairman of
(he "Bit; C" guard committee, said,
"We make a point of never excit
ing those hot-blooded Indians, hut
if they want war, we'll give it to
them."
The Daily has received anony
mous telephone calls, one of which
claimed that a red "S" was pasted
to the west side of the Cal stadium.
The letter was painted on paper
and the paper tacked to the stadium
walls.
SAT I IKK GATE WELDED
Other reports claim that the
Bears' famous Sather Gate had been
daubed a brilliant red and then the
gate had been welded shut.
California officials claim that the
raids arc in retaliation for the sev
eral yellow "C's" that "somebody"
