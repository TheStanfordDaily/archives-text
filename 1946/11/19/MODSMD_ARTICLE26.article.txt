# Science Backs Milk Complaint
## 
### TOM SELF 
Complaints by Stanford students that the milk allowance at
University dining halls is inadequate received support today
from scientists.
Science has concluded that it takes more than a pint a day to

â–ºkeep the doctor away. This is the
substance of a disclosure by the de
partment of nutrition service of the
National Dairy Council, on the basis
of reports issued by nationally
known scientists who are determin
ing the amount of calcium required
to maintain good health.
Calcium, the scientists say, is nec
essary for teh formation and main
tenance of bones and teeth, for co-
I agulation of the blood, for normal
! heart action, and for the proper
j functioning of all muscles and
! nerves. Of all foods, milk is un-
I equaled as the best provider of cal
cium.
"MAROIN OF SAFETY"
Findings made public by Milton
! Hull, president of the National
| Daily Council in the November is
| sue of the Dairy Council Digest em
phasized that a pint of milk daily
would provide for maintenance only
! and not for a "margin of safety."
! Hult added, "There is need, evi
dently, for reconsideration of the
' calcium allowances for the post
j adolescent period. Since bone de
i velopment continues for a number
jof years beyond adolescence, if
I seems obvious that the customary
| pint-a-day adult milk recommen
dation falls short of providing ade
quate amounts of calcium during the
j half-decade or so immediately pre
j coding full adulthood."
LIMITED CONSUMPTION
! University regulations now limit
I the milk consumption at dining
halls to one bottle a meal. This
seems to fall between the "mainte
nance level" and the "margin of
safety" level prescribed by the sci
entists. In previous quarters two
! bottles a meal were permitted at
| some halls.
| Stanford Village dining hall, the
I boarders say, averages one or two
I glasses of milk a day. That allow
j ance barely approaches the "main
- tenance level."
j COMPLAINTS ON ALLOWANCE
Complaints, notably from girls,
: have charged that the milk allow
ance at University dining halls is
| inadequate.
Fraternities, on the other hand,
have a more liberal milk allowance.
Alpha Sigma Phi, for example, af
i tor conducting a survey which
j showed an aftcrage milk consump
! tion of five glasses a day, fixed their
j allowance at that figure.
