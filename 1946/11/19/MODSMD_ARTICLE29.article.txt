# DAILY EDITORIALS
## For International Consciousness 
### 
Without standing against the proposal for
a new and enlarged student Union, we wish
to turn our editorial thumbs down on the
Union as a war memorial.
A memorial, we feel, is best worth having
which will serve to establish more firmly
those ideals for which Stanforjd students in the
second World War died. To -turn our eyes
inward to the four corners of the Quad, to at
tend foremost to our own social comfort as
students, is not to abet in any measure the
spirit which now demands international peace.
The desirability of a new Union cannot be
denied, and is worthy of continued effort on
the part of the students and alumni who wish
to see Stanford become a well-integrated and
socially self-sufficient campus. But there is no
crying need for a Union—the present facili
lies almost but not quite fill the bill. Further
more, the University's building plans include
provision for such a Union as we now ask.
So the Union is a probability for ihe not
too dim future, and will not be lost if the War
MGmorial Committee rejects it.
We are strongly in favor of a war memorial
which will emphasize Stanford's important
position in the course of world events, which
will strengthen her place as an educational
institution bent on sending out many hun
dreds of responsible citizens and leaders each
year. The liberal ideal for which Stanford
stands and soldiers die is worthy of subsidy
by d memorial fund.

Stanford cannot, we think, pass up this
opportunity to contribute positively to under
standing among world peoples, or to the edu
cation of her students along lines of interna
tional thought.
As a result, the support of the Daily will
go to whatever proposal best answers the
need for education of students for interna
tional citizenship. Surpassing the proposals
for an international institute, an international
house, and War Memorial professorships, are
those for sending students abroad to learn and
report first hand the conditions of foreign
countries and, specifically, universities.
A plan to sponsor exchange scholarships
and summer travel abroad not in a meager
but an all-out way, would seem to us the most
important step to take, to be supplemented as
the funds allow with such plans within the
University as have been suggested above. It
is time Stanford stopped dissipating its bound
less energies and funds into so many direc
tions that none make sense. It is time that a
positive direction be given to our planning—
a direction that would lead outside the Ivory
Tower.
When the War Memorial Committee de
cides to what cause to award its funds, we
hope the decision will be based on 1) a deter
mination to prevent the necessity for a third
war memorial, and 2) a thorough examination
of the needs confronting the college student
in this postwar world.
