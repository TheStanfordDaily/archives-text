# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
(Ld. note: We herewith present what we wish
were tlie true "campus opinion" on the Four
Feathers Drive.)
To the editor:
It appears that the well-known Stanford
considerateness, so highly vaunted following
the appearance of Mrs. Right, has given itself
a kick in the pants this past week.
We are again tritely referring to the Four
Feathers appeal which is obviously as worthy
a cause as keeping Rosotti's kids in shoes.
By failing to come through Stanford has
shown itself shortsighted as well as just plain
selfish.
Shortsighted because if the "arsenal of
democracy" doesn't supply textbooks for the
world of students to read, other countries with
philosophies perhaps not in tune with ours
will be willing to do so. And this would cer
tainly injure America's "liberal" intentions.
Selfish because two bucks from an Ameri
can, no matter how poor he may be, is a small
amount compared to two bucks from a citizen
of any other country.
We hope Stanford never has to appeal to
any other country for money to buy books.
Probably bread would return on the waters
and people elsewhere would be "just too
broke."— Marion Morrow.
Darling Editor, Ma'am.
!.'( memorials, viz. What makes a university great
is not the magnifieence of its union, the charm of its
pre iiknt. the number of its departments, and some
time:, not even the standing of its football team.
I'or what in tlie last analysis is most important is
(lie faculty—provided (here are students and a good
infer-library loan sy.sletn. Now it would be nice to

have a fabulous lounge, an innerspring beauty
dance floor, a better post office, decent dormitories,
decent food, decent classrooms, and a decent heating
system.
Nevertheless, all these are secondary to our (pro
fessed) purpose here; and what we best could do is
endow some War Memorial Professorships, for one,
a War Memorial Professorship in the History of the
Ancient Near East. For another, perhaps, a War Me
morial Professorship in International Relations, if it
were put in the department of anthropology. To set
up a new school, however, when already we are ex
tended beyond our means, and paying $166.65 ( tuition
per quarter, would be going hog wild.
One trouble with a magnificent ballroom is that it
still would be underheated or overheated and the
band would still play too loud.
But I also propose a possible alternative, viz.
Build all committee-people swanky quarters adja
cent to the country club and fence them off; then
build a swanky office building for the happiness of
the administration, and put a well and a moat
around if. Then let the rest of us get an education
and dance in the Pavilion if necessary.
Yea verily, CYCLONE COVEY.

To the editor:
What do we need? A union! The Daily has print
ed letters advocating using the War Memorial fund
for (1) a post office, (2) an international house, and
(.'») a scholarship fund.
(1) Our present post office is much more adequate
for its purpose than is. the Cellar. A post office is a
dead, cold thing; with no other function than to dis
tribute mail. Our building serves this need. A stu
dent union has a LIVING PURPOSE, that of en
couraging good conversation, of providing recreation.
Our Cellar is not large enough 'o serve this need. (2)
An international house is fine—but why give candy
to a lew before the many have bread? Only a minor
ity would profit from a house, but a new UNION
would satisfy the majority. (3) A scholarship fund is
dispersed and then intangible. As a "Memorial," a
solid, concrete building would force itself on the
consciousness of the student body.
'Iherelore. a new Union is the logical alternative.
