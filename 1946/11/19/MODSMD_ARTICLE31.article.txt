# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
A I was coming in the Palm Drive entrance a
little past midnight the other night (0.k.. so it was 3
a.m.), my path was blocked, a red lantern waved at
me. and when I stopped, my car was surrounded by
hostile-looking people peering in my windows.
"He doesn't look like a jeepful of Cal students,"
one said after much thought.
He doesn't look like much of anything, as a mat
ter of fact," said another.
To hell with Rally Com," I said real quickly,
thinking maybe there had been a revolution or some
thing and I should establish my principles.
Wonder what that means?" mused one of them,
turning a blinding light in my face. "Perhaps it's
some sort of password. Maybe he is a Cal student."
Oh yeah?" I snarled, trying to look as much like
I >r. Tresidder as possible.
"Sing the second verse of 'Come Join the Band,'"
challenged one of them.
'I hey couldn't catch me on that one. 1 told them
I didn't know it. What Stanford student does?
"What's the most read column in the Daily?" they
shot at me. That one was easy.
"The panty-girdle ads," I told them.
They nodded approval and put the wheels back nn
my ear. But as they were putting the motor back in,
one of them sighted the bucket of whitewash which
tin Administration has given me to use on the column.
"Aha,' he screamed, "he's going to paint dirty
words on the Quad."
I raced ofi down Palm Drive, followed by a howl
ing mob. However, I hid in the Cactus Gardens and
yiggled loudly when they approached.
"Oh, John, stop," I quavered in my most girlish
tr< ble. "I have to be in by 1:30. Wait until Big Game
nicht, I have a 3:30 then. An hour and a half just
i n't time enough to finish. Besides, if we're going

to pl;ty chess, why don'l we gel a brighter flashlight."
My pursuers retreated in confusion and 112 wended
my weary way home. But don't think the frosh class,
traditional protectors of the Farm premises, aren't
keeping an effective watch on the campus this week.
You can spot them patrolling the roads at night and
standing guard on the Quad.

PCC and Big Nine representatives meet today to
discuss the pending arrangements to make the Rose
Bowl the exclusive property of those two conferences.
The Big Nine seems to be coming to the conference
with a very condescending attitude.
There are all sorts of clauses to the agreement
which the Big Nine is insisting on. The arrangement
does not guarantee that the top team from that con
fcrence will come West each year. It even gives them
the option of not coming at all during the last Iwo
years of the five-year contract, but sending anyone
they might choose to replace them.
After being very haughly about the playing of
post-season games for many years, the Big Nine has
now voted to cut themselves in on the juicy Rose
Bowl plum at a time when the calibre of the teams
in their conference is definitely low.
Army has practically stated that they will accept
a Rose Bowl bid. If the PCC sn;ns an agreement with
the Big Nine (which will probably send twice-beaten
Illinois to the Bowl) and turns down an opportunity
to invite Army, the prestige of the Rose Bowl till
will take a tremendous drop. There are undoubtedly
many advantages of a tie-up with the Big Nine which
would prevent unseemly "shopping around" lor a
Rose Bowl opponent each fall, but the PCC does no!
have to make innumerable concessions and lose all
semblance of dignity in leaping at the Big Nine's
haughty arrangement.
It looks too much like a shotgun wedding to me.

PCC and Big Nine representatives meet today to
discuss the pending arrangements to make the Rose
Bowl the exclusive property of those two conferences.
The Big Nine seems to be coming to the conference
with a very condescending attitude.
There are all sorts of clauses to the agreement
which the Big Nine is insisting on. The arrangement
does not guarantee that the top team from that con
fcrence will come West each year. It even gives them
the option of not coming at all during the last Iwo
years of the five-year contract, but sending anyone
they might choose to replace them.
After being very haughly about the playing of
post-season games for many years, the Big Nine has
now voted to cut themselves in on the juicy Rose
Bowl plum at a time when the calibre of the teams
in their conference is definitely low.
Army has practically stated that they will accept
a Rose Bowl bid. If the PCC sn;ns an agreement with
the Big Nine (which will probably send twice-beaten
Illinois to the Bowl) and turns down an opportunity
to invite Army, the prestige of the Rose Bowl till
will take a tremendous drop. There are undoubtedly
many advantages of a tie-up with the Big Nine which
would prevent unseemly "shopping around" lor a
Rose Bowl opponent each fall, but the PCC does no!
have to make innumerable concessions and lose all
semblance of dignity in leaping at the Big Nine's
haughty arrangement.
It looks too much like a shotgun wedding to me.
A I was coming in the Palm Drive entrance a
little past midnight the other night (0.k.. so it was 3
a.m.), my path was blocked, a red lantern waved at
me. and when I stopped, my car was surrounded by
hostile-looking people peering in my windows.
"He doesn't look like a jeepful of Cal students,"
one said after much thought.
He doesn't look like much of anything, as a mat
ter of fact," said another.
To hell with Rally Com," I said real quickly,
thinking maybe there had been a revolution or some
thing and I should establish my principles.
Wonder what that means?" mused one of them,
turning a blinding light in my face. "Perhaps it's
some sort of password. Maybe he is a Cal student."
Oh yeah?" I snarled, trying to look as much like
I >r. Tresidder as possible.
"Sing the second verse of 'Come Join the Band,'"
challenged one of them.
'I hey couldn't catch me on that one. 1 told them
I didn't know it. What Stanford student does?
"What's the most read column in the Daily?" they
shot at me. That one was easy.
"The panty-girdle ads," I told them.
They nodded approval and put the wheels back nn
my ear. But as they were putting the motor back in,
one of them sighted the bucket of whitewash which
tin Administration has given me to use on the column.
"Aha,' he screamed, "he's going to paint dirty
words on the Quad."
I raced ofi down Palm Drive, followed by a howl
ing mob. However, I hid in the Cactus Gardens and
yiggled loudly when they approached.
"Oh, John, stop," I quavered in my most girlish
tr< ble. "I have to be in by 1:30. Wait until Big Game
nicht, I have a 3:30 then. An hour and a half just
