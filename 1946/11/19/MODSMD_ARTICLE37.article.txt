# Cardinal Backs Point for 'Big Game'
## Cal Line Will Be Tough Row to Hoe 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
Stanford will win the Big Game!
ItVs as simple as that. All the Big
Red Machine has to do is bottle up
Jackie Jensen and Billy Reinhard,
chase Dick Erickson out of the park,
snow big John Cunningham under,
rock Harry Pieper back on his rock
ers, keep Ron Sockolov from getting
mad, break Bob Dal Porto's leg,
break Boots Erbs other leg, and com
mit other such bits of mayhem for a
full 60 minutes.
If the Cards can do that they'll get
a scoreless tie at the least. And, if,
by some chance Merriman, Ander
son, Erickson, Martin, Titus, and a
few dozen others manage to break
loose, they can win the ball game.
Simple, isn't it?
Oh yeah? Listen sucker, the clay
the odds are posted the (arm will
he favored by 2 to I and 7 points
even; and anybody who bites on
thai bait is favoring the wrong in
stitution with their presence. Try
Napa or Agnew.
This Big Game is going to be like
every other Big Game. Take a coin,
flip it (once) and there's your favor
ite. Princeton's series with Rutgers
goes back to 18(if); Army and Navy
carry more weight (as a general
rule); USC and UCLA are looking
for the Rose Bowl; but Stanford and
Cal will play a game that equals any
in rugged play.
And that's your Big Game. The
Indians will be slightly favored by
tli' odds-makers (remember our
games with Washington and Wash
ington State). Why will they be fa
vored? For one thing, they can
score touchdowns—so can the Bears,
although their offense is strictly neg
ative. But Berkeley has the defense
so has the Farm, if it can be called
that.
And the Indians have Lloyd
Merriman, and he's what makes
the team go. At full strength, the
Card hackfields are the equal of
any on the Coast, and that goes for
USC and UCLA, with their pile
drivers, scatmcn and tossers.
The tentative starting backfield for
the locals has Ains Bell at quarter,
Bob Anderson at left half, Merriman
at full, and either George Quist or
Mickey Titus at right. Neither Quist
nor Titus are as yet in top shape, but
the nod will probably go to Mickey,
he being in the better condition.
Backing these stalwarts up are
Jack Brownson, and Aub Devine at
q, Sabu Erickson, Fred Parsons, and
Fred Sanderman at lh. Gene Martin,
A 1 Morris and Ben Cardinalli at rh,
and Marty Anderson, Fred Zappet
tini and Jack Crahan at 112.
I'iledrivers? Titus, Quist, Mar
tin. Merriman. Scatmcn? B & M
Anderson, Parsons, Erickson. San
derman. Merriman. Tossers? Bell,
Brownson, Devine, Merriman. If
you know of any better combina
tions on the Coast, let us in on it,
we'd like to see 'em. too.
II Stanford is going to win the 49th
Big One at Berkeley this Saturday,
it's the Indian backfield that'll win
it. If California is going to win this
contest, it's the Bear line that'll win
it.
And don't think the Bears don't
have the line to run us out of the
park. Offensively, ihe whole team is
probably the grandest conglomera
tion of left-footed individuals State
U. could possibly scare up. But de
fense is their meat—and how they
like to make a good team look like
Cal on offense.
It's all in the line. Maybe it's the
climate up there. Maybe it's the
peculiar perverseness that is Cal's
own. Maybe—aw nuts. They've got
a line that gets fired up for every
game and goes out and plays just
like it had a backfield that won't
(rip over the chalklines.
They're big. fast, awesome and
slightly terrific. They play every
game like it was for the national
championship. Put 'em in front of
the Farm's backfield and you'd have
the national champions. And if Cal
wins the Big Game, it's because guys
like Cunningham, Sockolov, Pieper,
Groesfsema, Baker, Turner, Dodds,
and Franz went out there and played
like they wanted to win it.

by some chance Merriman, Ander
son, Erickson, Martin, Titus, and a
few dozen others manage to break
loose, they can win the ball game.
Simple, isn't it?
Oh yeah? Listen sucker, the clay
the odds are posted the (arm will
he favored by 2 to I and 7 points
even; and anybody who bites on
thai bait is favoring the wrong in
stitution with their presence. Try
Napa or Agnew.
This Big Game is going to be like
every other Big Game. Take a coin,
flip it (once) and there's your favor
ite. Princeton's series with Rutgers
goes back to 18(if); Army and Navy
carry more weight (as a general
rule); USC and UCLA are looking
for the Rose Bowl; but Stanford and
Cal will play a game that equals any
in rugged play.
And that's your Big Game. The
Indians will be slightly favored by
tli' odds-makers (remember our
games with Washington and Wash
ington State). Why will they be fa
vored? For one thing, they can
score touchdowns—so can the Bears,
although their offense is strictly neg
ative. But Berkeley has the defense
so has the Farm, if it can be called
that.
And the Indians have Lloyd
Merriman, and he's what makes
the team go. At full strength, the
Card hackfields are the equal of
any on the Coast, and that goes for
USC and UCLA, with their pile
drivers, scatmcn and tossers.
The tentative starting backfield for
the locals has Ains Bell at quarter,
Bob Anderson at left half, Merriman
at full, and either George Quist or
Mickey Titus at right. Neither Quist
nor Titus are as yet in top shape, but
the nod will probably go to Mickey,
he being in the better condition.
Backing these stalwarts up are
Jack Brownson, and Aub Devine at
q, Sabu Erickson, Fred Parsons, and
Fred Sanderman at lh. Gene Martin,
A 1 Morris and Ben Cardinalli at rh,
and Marty Anderson, Fred Zappet
tini and Jack Crahan at 112.
I'iledrivers? Titus, Quist, Mar
tin. Merriman. Scatmcn? B & M
Anderson, Parsons, Erickson. San
derman. Merriman. Tossers? Bell,
Brownson, Devine, Merriman. If
you know of any better combina
tions on the Coast, let us in on it,
we'd like to see 'em. too.
II Stanford is going to win the 49th
Big One at Berkeley this Saturday,
it's the Indian backfield that'll win
it. If California is going to win this
contest, it's the Bear line that'll win
it.
And don't think the Bears don't
have the line to run us out of the
park. Offensively, ihe whole team is
probably the grandest conglomera
tion of left-footed individuals State
U. could possibly scare up. But de
fense is their meat—and how they
like to make a good team look like
Cal on offense.
It's all in the line. Maybe it's the
climate up there. Maybe it's the
peculiar perverseness that is Cal's
own. Maybe—aw nuts. They've got
a line that gets fired up for every
game and goes out and plays just
like it had a backfield that won't
(rip over the chalklines.
They're big. fast, awesome and
slightly terrific. They play every
game like it was for the national
championship. Put 'em in front of
the Farm's backfield and you'd have
the national champions. And if Cal
wins the Big Game, it's because guys
like Cunningham, Sockolov, Pieper,
Groesfsema, Baker, Turner, Dodds,
and Franz went out there and played
like they wanted to win it.
Stanford will win the Big Game!
ItVs as simple as that. All the Big
Red Machine has to do is bottle up
Jackie Jensen and Billy Reinhard,
chase Dick Erickson out of the park,
snow big John Cunningham under,
rock Harry Pieper back on his rock
ers, keep Ron Sockolov from getting
mad, break Bob Dal Porto's leg,
break Boots Erbs other leg, and com
mit other such bits of mayhem for a
full 60 minutes.
If the Cards can do that they'll get
a scoreless tie at the least. And, if,

ite. Princeton's series with Rutgers
goes back to 18(if); Army and Navy
carry more weight (as a general
rule); USC and UCLA are looking
for the Rose Bowl; but Stanford and
Cal will play a game that equals any
in rugged play.
And that's your Big Game. The
Indians will be slightly favored by
tli' odds-makers (remember our
games with Washington and Wash
ington State). Why will they be fa
vored? For one thing, they can
score touchdowns—so can the Bears,
although their offense is strictly neg
ative. But Berkeley has the defense
so has the Farm, if it can be called
that.
And the Indians have Lloyd
Merriman, and he's what makes
the team go. At full strength, the
Card hackfields are the equal of
any on the Coast, and that goes for
USC and UCLA, with their pile
drivers, scatmcn and tossers.
The tentative starting backfield for
the locals has Ains Bell at quarter,
Bob Anderson at left half, Merriman
at full, and either George Quist or
Mickey Titus at right. Neither Quist
nor Titus are as yet in top shape, but
the nod will probably go to Mickey,
he being in the better condition.
Backing these stalwarts up are
Jack Brownson, and Aub Devine at
q, Sabu Erickson, Fred Parsons, and
Fred Sanderman at lh. Gene Martin,
A 1 Morris and Ben Cardinalli at rh,
and Marty Anderson, Fred Zappet
tini and Jack Crahan at 112.
I'iledrivers? Titus, Quist, Mar
tin. Merriman. Scatmcn? B & M
Anderson, Parsons, Erickson. San
derman. Merriman. Tossers? Bell,
Brownson, Devine, Merriman. If
you know of any better combina
tions on the Coast, let us in on it,
we'd like to see 'em. too.
II Stanford is going to win the 49th
Big One at Berkeley this Saturday,
it's the Indian backfield that'll win
it. If California is going to win this
contest, it's the Bear line that'll win
it.
And don't think the Bears don't
have the line to run us out of the
park. Offensively, ihe whole team is
probably the grandest conglomera
tion of left-footed individuals State
U. could possibly scare up. But de
fense is their meat—and how they
like to make a good team look like
Cal on offense.
It's all in the line. Maybe it's the
climate up there. Maybe it's the
peculiar perverseness that is Cal's
own. Maybe—aw nuts. They've got
a line that gets fired up for every
game and goes out and plays just
like it had a backfield that won't
(rip over the chalklines.
They're big. fast, awesome and
slightly terrific. They play every
game like it was for the national
championship. Put 'em in front of
the Farm's backfield and you'd have
the national champions. And if Cal
wins the Big Game, it's because guys
like Cunningham, Sockolov, Pieper,
Groesfsema, Baker, Turner, Dodds,
and Franz went out there and played
like they wanted to win it.
