Slowly but surely, just like finals,
the end of the intramural football
play is coming 'round the corner,
and in a few days the campus will
! kiiow who the best 'mural teams are.
Semi-finals fur the playoffs are
! slated for Monday afternoon, the
; 25th. and the championship lilt
will come off Tuesday afternoon
J next week.
! The closest game in last week's in
tramural competition found the
Dekes edging out the KA's 8-G in a
hotly contested fight, while the En
cina 5E outfit upset the league leader
V312 by 13-6.
By far the best showing of the
week was turned in by the Alpha
Delts as they trounced the league
leading Biz School 20-0 to throw
their league into a three-way tic
for top spot. The League X cham
pionship was accorded the V2lO as
J they whipped the hitherto unhcat
! en Legal Eagles 32-0.
In another game the KA's defeated
Encina 3E 12-10, but both teams
wanted to play more football and so
an extra quarter was played, off the
record of course. Seems like the fel
lows are enjoying their 'mural play
quite a bit, which is the best argu
ment for the whole program.

The University's tennis tourna
ment is moving right along, and the
four semi-final spots have been
filled.
One of the semi-finalists will
probably be unable to finish out
the fight, howevi r, seeing as how
he got himself shot in the leg din -
ing a scuffle with a deputy sheriff
this week-end. Bob Keenan of the
Beta's had upset seeded Dave
Basham 4-(>. (5-2. 8-(> last week, and
was considered to have a good
chance at the tennis title.
The other three semi-final berths
are occupied by top-ranking Arnie
' Beisser. Lucien Barbour, and Bob
Lewis, one-half of the Lewis twins'
basketball combination of the Indian
team.

Stanford's wrestling squad got off
to a late start this season, but never
theless the class now has 30 members
who show a lot of improvement in
their work-outs at the basketball pa
vilion every afternoon.
Vein Jones, who won the Illinois
state wrestling championship in
J '42, is the watchful student coach
under whose direction the Indian
grapplcrs are practicing their holds
in anticipation of a tough schedule
for next season.
Wrestling gets under way as a
minor sport during winter quarter,
and from the looks of the line-up, the
Stanford men will have to be rugged
to win the majority of their matches.
Last year was the first time the Car
dinals went in for intercollegiate
competition, and as a result experi
enced grapplers are few and far be
tween.
Friday afternoon this week all
the volunteers from the squad are
heading south to San Jose for a
practice match in which each In
j dian will wrestle a man in bis own
weight and experience class, a
I meet expected to help all competi
tors gain confidence and experi
ence for the coming season.
Vern is looking for newcomers,
whether they are experienced or not,
and so il' you are interested in win
ning a letter or learning a few holds,
drop over to the front lobby of the
basketball pavilian any afternoon
from four to six and see Vern. He'll
show you how it's done.
