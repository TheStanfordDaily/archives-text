# Montana On Way Out?
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 18 (UP).—
An attempt to remove the University
of Montana from the Pacific Coast
Conference will be made at the or
ganization's semi-annual meeting
next month, a responsible conference
official .said tonight.
Both results and procedure are
vague because a similar question
has never arisen. Presumably the
school would be asked to withdraw,
and if it refused, no publicity would
be given the move.
The "invitation," long advocated
by some of the California schools in
the conference, would be based on
these arguments:
I—Montana is outside the "normal
geographical area" of the conference.
California, Oregon, and Washington
are Pacific Coast states, ar.d the Uni
versity of Idaho is only nine miles 1
across the line from Washington j
State College.
2 —The University, beaten fll-7
Saturday by University of California
at Los Angeles, fails to provide foot
ball competition for other conference
rivals.
3 —lt never has fully participated j
in the conference athletic program,
holding to football and a limited en
try in track and field championships. I
In 21 seasons of competition, Mon
tana has never beaten a conference
member except Idaho, who has fallen 1
to the Grizzlies seven times.
Excluding the Idaho series, Mon
tana has scored only 180 points to
opponents' 1,709.
Some California members have
wanted to eliminate Idaho from the
conference also, but the northern >
members point out that Idaho t;ikes
a full part in other northern division
sports on a near-even basis. Idaho
even took the northern division bas
ketball title last season.
