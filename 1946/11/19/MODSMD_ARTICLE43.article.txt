# Rose Bowl Invitation For Army to Be Decided Today
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Nov. 18 (UP). —Army's great football team was in an ex
cellent spot tonight to get the Rose Bowl invitation it is waiting for, pro
vided the Big Nine Conference waives its priority in a meeting with the
Pacific Coast Conference tomorrow.
There seemed to be a definite possibility that representatives of the

Big Nine would pass up an appear- .
j ance in the coming New Year's Day j
game in a gesture of tribute to the I
! Cadets, who haven't lost a football I
game in three years.
Executives of the two major con- J
ferences meet tomorrow at 10 a.m. j
to make the finaf draft in a long
projectecl plan which would close
the lucrative Rose Bowl game at
Pasadena for five years to all but
j their colleges or schools designated
by them. •
The Big Nine last week voted for
a five-year pact that would let it
1 pick the Eastern representative, and
j the meeting here will determine if ;
i the proposal will be accepted.
Dean Stanley Freeborn of the
University of California, chairman
I of the faculty committee of the Pa
| cific circuit, said today that com
plete action, with a "yes" or "no"
decision, would be made at this ses
[ sion.
Freeborn said that a faculty rep
resentative and graduate manager
from every school in the Pacific
; Conference would b? present at the
j meeting. Commissioner Victor O.
Schmidt also will be here.
However, there is considerable
pressure from responsible men in
the West to delay signing of the pact
until the 1948 game. Because the
i Army team would be receptive to
a Rose Bowl bid, sports editors of
1 major Pacific Coast newspapers are
: asking that the contract be delayed.
