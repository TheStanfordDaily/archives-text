# Government Stalls Lewis' Mine Strike
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Nov. 18 (UP).â€”
The government today won the first
round of a showdown fight with
John L. Lewis by obtaining a tem
porary federal court injunction re
straining the United Mine Workers'
boss from closing the soft-coal mines
at midnight Wednesday.
Federal District Court Judge T.
Alan Goldsborough, granted the re
straining order on application of
U.S. Attorney General Tom C.
Ciuik. He gave Lewis until Nov. 27

to show cause why the injunction
should not be made permanent.
Goldsborough, in effect, held that
under the United Mine Workers'
traditional policy of "no contract,
no work," Lewis would be calling
an illegal strike against the govern
ment if he went ahead with his an
nounced intention of terminating
the union's federal wage contract
Wednesday.
The restraining order backed the
position taken by President Truman
who declared that Lewis could not
legally reopen the union's contract
with the government. He served no
tice that he was ready to fight Lewis
id 1 the way on this issue.
In his petition for the injunction,
Clark warned Lewis clearly that he
and his UMW aides might be liable
to criminal prosecution if the min
ers walk out.
