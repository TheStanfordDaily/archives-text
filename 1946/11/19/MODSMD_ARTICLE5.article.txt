# Stegner Reads Housman Verse
## 
### 
Wallace Stegner will read from the
poetry of A. E. Housman this after
noon at 4:15 in the Briggs room of
the Humanities Building. This will
he the last in this quarter's series of
poetry-readings.
Housman, who died only recently,
was a strange combination of pre
cise, cantankerous, Latin scholarâ€”
and poet. As a Latin scholar he in
sisted on absolute accuracy. As a
poet, he belonged to the class of epi
curean-stoics.
The epicureans lived the philoso
phy of "eat, drink, and be merry, :!"or
tomorrow we die." To them, the im
portant part of this motto was "to
morrow we die." They were insist
ent on death. The stoics were con
cerned with man's conduct in the
face of death. Housman's poetry
contains both this preoccupation
with death and the way in which
men should exist before death.
"Housman was a poet with a very
narrow range, Mr. Stegner criti
cized. "But. he was first class within
this range. lie only wrote about six
poems, but these poems are perfect."
