# Club Hears Top Songs

### BIPAN CHANDRA 
For two hours Gilbert and Sulli
van reigned in the sitting room of
Edwin J. Thomas where the"I"
Club meeting was held last Sunday.
Professors Bayard Q. Morgan and
Philip W. Buck entertained the
members with some of the best
compositions of the two great com
posers.
Introducing Gilbert and Sullivan
to the foreign students, Mr. Morgan
said, "They are two of the wittiest
Englishmen of all times, and we all
have been brought up in their great
tradition." He expressed a hope
that coming generations will not
lose this tradition.
Mr. Morgan opened the singing'
with a song from "Patience," and
Mr. Buck continued by presenting
"I have got them on my list." Mr.
Buck went on to present a few
verses of his own composition, com
posed after this great song by Gil
bert and Sullivan. The verses
caught the imagination of the au
dience and some of them are pre
sented below:
(Note: Mr. Buck wrote these
verses in the "dark" days of 1945
when it was difficult for even him
to find a male face in the classes.)
Since the women conquered Stan
ford. I must take a new look
round.
To make my little list, to make
my little iist:
For in the Stanford faculty, great
crowds of folk they've found,
Who never would he missed, who
never would he missed.
The man who calls her sketches
daubs, when she had callcd
them art,
The scientist who makes her take
all frogs and cats apart.
That terribly annoying member of
the Stanford staff.
The man who tells a joke in class—
and grades her on her laugh!
And every sort of campus clown
and classroom humorist.
They'd none of them be missed,
they'd none of them be
missed.
The girls who sob their way
through college, I am very
glad to say,
I've put them on my list, they're
on mv little list:
Who, were they graded on their
tears, deserve at least an "A,"
They never would he missed, they
never would he missed.
They've not the least idea of what
a question is about,
l>ut know a lot of other things, and
always blurt them out;
The one who, four days in the
week, a homely, dowdy lass.
On Fridays brings her suitcase and
new hair-do to class,
And looks a chic creation of a very
French modiste—
She never would be missed, she
never would he "missed"!
After some time, the members of
the"I" Club also joined in and
many a soft and high tune of Gil
bert and Sullivan echoed through
the sitting room. When the meeting
ended, some members were still
trying to sing, "I've been working
on the railroad all the live-long
day."

van reigned in the sitting room of
Edwin J. Thomas where the"I"
Club meeting was held last Sunday.
Professors Bayard Q. Morgan and
Philip W. Buck entertained the
members with some of the best
compositions of the two great com
posers.
Introducing Gilbert and Sullivan
to the foreign students, Mr. Morgan
said, "They are two of the wittiest
Englishmen of all times, and we all
have been brought up in their great
tradition." He expressed a hope
that coming generations will not
lose this tradition.
Mr. Morgan opened the singing'
with a song from "Patience," and
Mr. Buck continued by presenting
"I have got them on my list." Mr.
Buck went on to present a few
verses of his own composition, com
posed after this great song by Gil
bert and Sullivan. The verses
caught the imagination of the au
dience and some of them are pre
sented below:
(Note: Mr. Buck wrote these
verses in the "dark" days of 1945
when it was difficult for even him
to find a male face in the classes.)
Since the women conquered Stan
ford. I must take a new look
round.
To make my little list, to make
my little iist:
For in the Stanford faculty, great
crowds of folk they've found,
Who never would he missed, who
never would he missed.
The man who calls her sketches
daubs, when she had callcd
them art,
The scientist who makes her take
all frogs and cats apart.
That terribly annoying member of
the Stanford staff.
The man who tells a joke in class—
and grades her on her laugh!
And every sort of campus clown
and classroom humorist.
They'd none of them be missed,
they'd none of them be
missed.
The girls who sob their way
through college, I am very
glad to say,
I've put them on my list, they're
on mv little list:
Who, were they graded on their
tears, deserve at least an "A,"
They never would he missed, they
never would he missed.
They've not the least idea of what
a question is about,
l>ut know a lot of other things, and
always blurt them out;
The one who, four days in the
week, a homely, dowdy lass.
On Fridays brings her suitcase and
new hair-do to class,
And looks a chic creation of a very
French modiste—
She never would be missed, she
never would he "missed"!
After some time, the members of
the"I" Club also joined in and
many a soft and high tune of Gil
bert and Sullivan echoed through
the sitting room. When the meeting
ended, some members were still
trying to sing, "I've been working
on the railroad all the live-long
day."
