# Winter Quarter Will See Leadership Forum Revival
## 
### 
Stanford has revived another of
its prewar activities with the re-es
tablishment of the Leadership In
stitute Forum.
The Forum, which is an informal
bull session for discussion of mat
ters of vital importance to Stanford
students, is being organized again
in an effort to renew lagging in
terest in student affairs. The turn
out of only 21 per cent in the recent
election is a good example of this
indifference.
FACULTY AIR VIEWS TOO
Proponents of each side of an is
sue will be given a chance to state
their arguments, and then it will be
thrown open for comment from the
people in attendance. Faculty mem
bers are often invited to air their
views, as well as leading student
officers.
FLOOR OPEN TO ALL
"If you're dissatisfied with some
phase of student government or ad
ministration policy, this is a good
chance to express your opinion to
the individuals who will represent
you at EJccom and various other
meetings," Doug Crawford, chair
man of the Forum, stated.
"Before the war seventy or eighty
people were usually present at these
round-table discussions. It is hoped
that the same interest will be shown
on such things as electioneering,
the proposed Student Union build

ing, or other controversial issues,"
Crawford added. ,
STARTS NEXT QUARTER
Although discussions will not be
scheduled until winter quarter, a
committee is being formed now to
arrange for these future meetings.
Any students who are interested
in working on this committee or
who have suggestions for issues that
should be given consideration,
should contact either Doug Craw
ford at the Phi Sigma Kappa house,
or Gordon Ness at the Daily Shack
or at Village 157.
