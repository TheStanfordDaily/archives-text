### 
NANKING. Nov. 19 (UP).â€”A bat
tle for the Communist stronghold of
Yenan loomed menacingly in China
today as relations between the
Communists and Chiang Kai-shek's
government hit the lowest point in
years.
While both sides became increas
ingly suspicious of possible military
moves, the Generaiissimo was re
ported to be pressing his party into
new efforts to win followers from
the opposition.
A high official source told the
United Press that Chiang said his
troops can crush the Communist
army in five months- but political
suppression will take five years.
