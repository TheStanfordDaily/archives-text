# Traditional Big Game Gaieties Curtain Rises tonight; 150 Students in Cast
## 
### 
Tonight at 8:15 the curtain goes up on this year's edition of
the Big Game Gaieties. Under the direction of Bob Ashley, this
extravaganza is reported to be "the greatest thing since 7-up."
Campus opinion has indicated that the show with a cast of approxi
mately 150 Farm students including the 110-mcmbcr chorus and a full
orchestra will be a real hit.
As Stan Shpetncr, one of the show's stars, put it, "I'm in it!" A 1 Novi
kofT echoed Stan's feelings with a curt, "Me too!"
All other comments were equally as enthusiastic except for one non
entity who wailed, "I hate Gaieties!" After shaving his head everyone
felt much better.
The music in the show is out of this world. The kick-ofT for the in4<>
Gaieties get:; under way with the Overture, and the chorus tells you what
it's all about "On Registration."
Other big musical scores for the "first half" include "What Has Hap
pened to Me?", "Team for Two," and the "Carhop's Lament."
In between the musical scores the ca:;t reviews what goes on in campus
life on the Farm in such acts as "Oh, Doctor," "Dibble Time," "Willis
Schmiller," and "Hold That Line."

Starting the".second half' the Ga
ieties chorus will entertain with
"Half-Time Music," and follow with
a song and dance number, "Top of
the Muck." Other second-half song
hits will include "This World of
Mine," "Looks Like a Victory," and
the finale when the whole cast will
go all ovit to "Give 'Em the Axe."
Under the direction of F. M. Scott
111 the music reportedly should re
place the hit parade. Such vocalists
as Rena Jean Black, Gaieties star
from way back, Shirley Sleeper,
Roger Starr, Bob Gettys, and Don
O'Ncil will be there to put. the songs
over. Art IvlcCue will conduct the
orchestra.
And between the musicals in the
"second half" the rest of the ea;;t
will discuss the "Man in Commo
tion," take "Time Out for Lunch,"
agree that "It Looks Like a Vic
tory," and prepare to give them the
"Axe in the Head."
Tickets arc going, going, almost
gone. There arc still many for
Friday afternoon, which is sup
posed to be the best performance
of the lot. Friday night has been
completely sold out, and Wednes
day night is as good a* sold out.
Tickets may he obtained in the
ASSU office from J) until 5 today,
tomorrow, and Friday.
Bob Ashley has summed it up
with, "It seems a shame that a show
of this magnitude has to close after
three performances. If wo were on
Broadway, wc would probably out
last. "Tobacco Road," but that's the
price of a college show."
The entire cast is due in the Little
1 Theater at (5:45 tonight. If you don't
show up on time, you'll be sorry!
Free programs will be given out
i to the cast. For everybody else they
j don't cost a ccnt."
Lights! Music! Action!
