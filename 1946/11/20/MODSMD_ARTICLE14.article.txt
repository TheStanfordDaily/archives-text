# White a 'Must' For Big Game
## 
### 
A complete white rooting section
at the game Saturday is a necessity
if Stanford rooters are to make up
in quality for Cal's size, according to
Bob Leefcldt, arrangement chair
man for Rally Com.

The rooting section will be di
vided as has been the tradition
at all Cal games.

All rooters are requested to wear
white sweaters or shirts and will
not be admitted to the section if
they are not properly attired.
"Of course we don't want Stan
ford rooters to freeze to death car
rying out the tradition," said Lee
feldt, "hut we ask that all sweaters
and shirts be worn under a white
garment.
Women wearing bandanas should
wear white ones. The committee,
however, does not expect to carry
out the white theme in the event of
a heavy rain.
