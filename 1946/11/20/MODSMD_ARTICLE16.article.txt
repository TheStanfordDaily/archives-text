# Weather Threatens Big Game Activities
## Cal-Stanford Guard Against Game Week Paint Smearing 
### 
With a hint of more raids from the Cal Bears of Berkeley,
Stanford's freshmen were guarding all campus entrances against
"marauders" from across the bay yesterday.
Guards have been placed around both campuses after yellow
"C's" and red "S's" have been found on the Quad and in Eshel
man Court on the Berkeley campus.

On the Cal campus Dean of Stu- i
dents Hurford E. Stone has urged j
Berkeley students not to retaliate ,
j for the paint daubing or the "S"
burned in acid on the UC stefdium j
turf. Student Body President Ed
' ward Welch has urged undergradu
ate students to spend their efforts
lon the coming week-end of activi
j ties of Cal's Homecoming Week.
Here on the Farm campus univer-
I sity authorities have stored the
1 famed Stanford Axe in a bank
vault.
As an outcome of the whole epi
sode, The San Francisco News com
| mented on the affair in its editorial
i page last night:
"We wondered if the presence of
so many mature veteran students
on the two campuses would dis
courage the juvenile practice of
daubing paint over buildings and
ground before the Big Game this
year. Apparently not. The Red
'S' has appeared on the Berkeley
campus, and threats from that
quarter indicate the Golden 'C
will mysteriously make its appear
ance down on the Farm. The prac
tice always has seemed to us a
waste of academic effort as well
as of good paint."
The Hoover War Library was
smeared with paint again yester
day. Someone has painted in the
score of the Big Game on the bulle
tin board of games in front of the
j stadium, 21-0 in favor of the Blue
! and Gold.
No more reports have been forth
coming from the Berkeley campus
since the California Stadium in
Strawberry Canyon was "hung"
with the Stanford "S."
