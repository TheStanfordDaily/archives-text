# Frosh Needed To Build Fire
## 
### 
Rain and lack of freshman labor
are periling Stanford's traditional
Big Game bonfire. The "Dirty
Golden Bear" will not be roasted if
more co-operation is not forthcom
ing immediately.
j Bob Stephens, Cardinal member
! in charge of the bonfire, announced
last night that frosh turnout to build
their fire has been cut down by un
pleasant weather and by expendi
ture of freshman energy in guard
ing the campus entrances against
] Cal invasions.
The bonfire, if it is held at all,
will take place in the open field
behind Branner Hall, Stephens
said. Heavy rains have flooded the
bottom of Lake Lagunita, usually
dry at this time of year.
Trucks hauling wood, poles, and
odds and ends of lumber for con
struction of the pyre have mired in
! the wet ground. Twenty freshmen
worked on the trucks all day yes
terday and 15 dug up poles.
In past years all of Encina's res
idents, numbering usually 500,
have spent days prior to the fire
gathering material from local
firms and the surrounding area.
Bill Whitcford, frosh president, is
directing freshman activity. Tom
Milburn is supervising procurement
of material and Tom Martzloff is or
j gariizing construction.
Freshman women, under Nancy
Spackman and Carl Bruno, will
| serve doughnuts and coffee to men
, working on the bonfire Thursday.
