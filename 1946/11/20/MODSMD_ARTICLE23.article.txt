## Hashers Aren't Gypped 
### 
Complaints have come into our office that
hashers working for only part of their meals,
mainly those that hash in the main Union or
Union Unit dining rooms, are getting gypped
they aren't getting the cost of the number
of meals they hash refunded from their board.
From investigating the situation we conclude
tli.it the complaints are unfounded, that hash
ers are getting a sguare deal, the reasons for
v/iiich follow.
Hashing is not a refund for meals. Students
do not hash for their meals, but are simply
reimbursed for their jobs out of the income
the University receives for their meals. In the
University's bookkeeping system, the wages
a student receives for hashing are applied on
the income received from him for his meals.
So the student who thinks that because his
board rate has gone up he should receive
r-nough more from hashing per meal to cover
the increased price of a meal has not under
stood the situation. It would be an extremely
difficult bookkeeping problem for the Univer
sity to figure out the cost of each meal so the
student could be paid this amount. The cost
of each meal wonid be indeterminable in
most cases.
The University has devised a system of
payment for hashing which we think is fair

and fairly easy from the bookkeeping angle.
Full-time hashers, those working three meals
a day in any dining hall, pay no board. It is
figured that their board rate of $135 per quar
ter which allows approximately $1.65 for
meals per day is about equal to the wage they
are entitled to for hashing three meals every
day.
Students, however, that hash for only part
of their meals so that they are not entitled to
a full board refund, are paid at the rate of 75
cents an hour, and receive 60 cents for every
meal they hash since it is figured that on the
average each meal takes only 45 minutes of
their time. The 60 cents per meal hashed be
comes a refund on the students' board.
If a student hashes two meals a day he
receives $1.20 refund on board per day. There
fore he is only paying 45 cents for his third
meal. Or at this rate, if he hashes three meals
a day, receiving 60 cents a meal,- he would
be refunded $1.80 per day which is more
than he is paying for his daily meals. We are
simply showing that 60 cents per meal is a
fair wage. Actually the wage and the meal
cost have no connection. That particular wage
rate is one that approximates board costs and
is therefore considered fair payment for the
job. So full-time and part-time hashers receive
approximately the same wage.—N.B.

of meals they hash refunded from their board.
From investigating the situation we conclude
tli.it the complaints are unfounded, that hash
ers are getting a sguare deal, the reasons for
v/iiich follow.
Hashing is not a refund for meals. Students
do not hash for their meals, but are simply
reimbursed for their jobs out of the income
the University receives for their meals. In the
University's bookkeeping system, the wages
a student receives for hashing are applied on
the income received from him for his meals.
So the student who thinks that because his
board rate has gone up he should receive
r-nough more from hashing per meal to cover
the increased price of a meal has not under
stood the situation. It would be an extremely
difficult bookkeeping problem for the Univer
sity to figure out the cost of each meal so the
student could be paid this amount. The cost
of each meal wonid be indeterminable in
most cases.
The University has devised a system of
payment for hashing which we think is fair

and fairly easy from the bookkeeping angle.
Full-time hashers, those working three meals
a day in any dining hall, pay no board. It is
figured that their board rate of $135 per quar
ter which allows approximately $1.65 for
meals per day is about equal to the wage they
are entitled to for hashing three meals every
day.
Students, however, that hash for only part
of their meals so that they are not entitled to
a full board refund, are paid at the rate of 75
cents an hour, and receive 60 cents for every
meal they hash since it is figured that on the
average each meal takes only 45 minutes of
their time. The 60 cents per meal hashed be
comes a refund on the students' board.
If a student hashes two meals a day he
receives $1.20 refund on board per day. There
fore he is only paying 45 cents for his third
meal. Or at this rate, if he hashes three meals
a day, receiving 60 cents a meal,- he would
be refunded $1.80 per day which is more
than he is paying for his daily meals. We are
simply showing that 60 cents per meal is a
fair wage. Actually the wage and the meal
cost have no connection. That particular wage
rate is one that approximates board costs and
is therefore considered fair payment for the
job. So full-time and part-time hashers receive
approximately the same wage.—N.B.
Complaints have come into our office that
hashers working for only part of their meals,
mainly those that hash in the main Union or
Union Unit dining rooms, are getting gypped
they aren't getting the cost of the number
of meals they hash refunded from their board.
