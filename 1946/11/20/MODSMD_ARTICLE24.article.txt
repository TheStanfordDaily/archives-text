II this doggone rain »dosn't stop, tomorrow's bon
fire will be under about 15 feet of Lagunita water and
the float parade will have to do just that.
The Indian gridders may have to rely heavily on
Bobby Anderson's swimming ability Saturday to
M'ore against the Bears in the puddle that the Berke
ley stadium will be if the rain continues. Perhaps
il would b'.' better to put the water polo team in. Or
issue water wings to the varsity instead of shoulder
pads.

Have you noticed that all of Stanford's yummy
.sweater "iris have definitely taken a turn for the
worse in this rainy weather? Wrapped up in those
impulsive raincoats they look more like bundles for
Britain than anything else.
Three of our local beauties were standing in front
ol Lagunita yesterday in their waterproof cocoons
when a man came along and threw them into a truck,
thinking they were bags of dirty laundry someone '
had left there. Carried them all the way into Paly
before they convinced him otherwise. (0.K., so I'm
exaggerating a little. It was only halfway to Paly.
No Stanford girl would £o all the way.)

If the news stories in today's Daily seem to be
a little watered down, it's because the Shack is leak
in" like a sieve in a heavy sea. A little man came
over a lew minutes a.t-o to see about fixing it.
"Where's the leak?" he asked, standing in the

middle of a great puddle and ignoring the rain which
was pouring through the roof.
"The ceiling," I indicated, whispering to him very
confidentially.
"Darn if it ain't," he said, struggling to keep his
head above water.
He paddled around the Shack investigating the
numerous holes through which the torrent was
pouring.
' "Wal," he concluded, "it won't leak tomorrow."
"How you going to fix it?" I asked.
"1 ain't," he said. "But it ain't gonna rain tomor
row." And then he left. Maybe he was the weather
man. 1 don't know. But the Daily is still all wet.
And no remarks!

The following item appears under the headline,
"THE DARK TRAIL OF DRINK," in the Clipsheet,
a board of temperance release.
"Poppy and Mommy, they were arguing and they
got pretty excited and Poppy said, 'I'll fix you,' and
he went and got a gun and Poppy shot Mommy."
Don't you just adore baby-talk?
Perhaps some of you noticed the q"aint utilitarian
pot that adorned the spire of our chapel for a few
days. Well, the boys from the Firehouse climbed up
and removed it the other day. And where did they
put it?
In the Firehouse with all their other intramural
trophies!
