CRACK-DOWN TO CRACK-UP
We in the United States are justly proud of a
number ol things, especially our standard of living,
lh< highest in the world, and the great extent of per
onal liberty. Yet few people are aware of existing
plans to weaken, if not destroy, these achievemnts.
In the recent elections three states outlawed the
' loscd shop. Minnesota's Senator Ball intends to in
troduce a bill outlawing it throughout the country.
Republican leaders have expressed their intention
in revise the Act—labor's bill of rights—and
to pass once more the Case Bill.
All this is officially designed to "make labor more
responsible," to "deprive unions of too-great power."
The San Francisco Chronicle, one of the more intelli
gent newspapers, has stated condescendingly that if
labor behaves itself (that is, if it does whatever
business wants it to do) it might perhaps not be
necessary to forbid closed shops.
It is remarkable that those who clamor loudest
for making labor responsible also clamor loudest
against any attempt to make business responsible.
II is asserted on the one hand that unions should
not have the power to deprive a community of
necessary services. Is it not also true that business
should not have the power to deprive it of neces
sary goods, such as meat?
Union monopolies are vigorously attacked as un
democratic. But what is the National Association
ol Manufacturers doing to crack, for example, the
copper and aluminum monopolies? It is said that
unions should not be able to force all workers in a
plant to be union members. But is it all right for

industries to loree producers to join associations that
determine how much they can produce and at what
prices? These associations are prevalent in industry
today and have been highly successful in persuading
unwilling businessmen to see the light.
Again price controls arc denounced as unwar
ranted government interference. It is less well-known
that under business sponsorship every state, except
Vermont, has passed laws setting ceilings on some
commodities. Strangely enough they are not de
nounced. Nor do farmers denounce government
subsidies and guaranteed minimum prices.
It is high time that this hypocritical altitude
undergo a thorough change. Ft is high time not
only because this attitude is absurd in its irration
ality, hut also because it can lead to nothing hut
trouble.
Labor will no longer be pushed around. It is
watching two things carefully: anti-labor legislation
and prices. Dun & Bradstreet—hardly run by the
ClO—announced the other day that wholesale food
prices have increased over 50 per cent during the
past twelve months. Wages have not.
If prices continue to increase, and apparently
they will for some time, and if restrictive labor laws
are adopted, we will see the biggest wave of strikes
of all times. Labor will fight—not just in one or two
towns, but everywhere, in every city and in every
state.
Thus the planned crack-down might well lead
to a period of internal strife approaching civil war
that would end both our high standard of living
and our cherished personal freedom.
