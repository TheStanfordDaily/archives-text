# Coast Conference-Big Nine Bowl Tie-up Hits Snag
## Northern Schools Rumored Holding Out for Army Bid 
### 
BERKELEY, Nov. 19 (UP).—An official spokesman of the West
ern and Pacific Coast conferences' Rose Bowl meeting an
nounced tonight that the only issue blocking agreement on a
five-year pact covering the annual classic was whether the first
game will be played this year or in 1948.
The statement was made by a fully responsible official of

the PCC at a dinner recess in the
day-long meeting of the two dynas
ties which seeks to establish the
Rose Bowl tilt as a private affair
for the next half-decade. The offi
rial declined to be quoted by name.
But he said debate was centered
around whether a Big. Nine team
will come west this year into the
Bowl for a battle with the West's
top conference team or whether the
contract will be dated to begin Jan,
2, thus leaving the field open for
.some other top team in the coun
try—possibly Army.
All delegates to the conference
maintained a "sealed lips" atti
tude toward the proceedings to
day—described as a "meeting of
minds" of the Midwest and West
to determine the choice of Rose
Bowl opponents.
OREGONIANS LEAVE EARLY
Representatives from Oregon left
tlu- conference and headed home
ward shortly before the dinner re
cess with announcement that they
will be full in accord with "what
ever is decided" by their brother
members in the Coast Conference.
The historic meeting began
shortly after 10 a.m. with Dean
Stanley Freeborn of the Univer
sity of California presiding. The
five-man delegation from the Big
Nine was on hand together with
representatives of the ltt PCC
schools. The University of Wash
ington and Oregon delegates ar
rived 'late, having been grounded
at Eugene, Ore., by poor Hying
weather.
At the initial session, Commis
sioner Kenneth L. (Tug) Wilson, of
the Big Nine, presented his confer
ence's proposal for the staging of
the game between champions, or
their representatives, of the two
leagues.
CLOSED SESSION CALLED
Immediately afterward, the West
Coast body conferred in a closed
session to consider the Midwestern
proposition. In the event the PCC
delegates reach an agreement, it
was reported, they were to take an
immediate poll of the group and
announce the results to the Big
Nine at another joint meeting.
II the results favor a "merger"
between the conferences, a three
man committee from Pasadena,
headed by Hal Reynolds, was to
lie called in and informed of the
decision regarding the game.
The agreement as proposed be
tween the two conferences would
match the PCC champions against
the Big Nine winner, or a team se-
I' cled by the Midwestern winner.
Any single Big Nine team would
only be permitted to go to Pasadena
once in three years under the plan.
A team which won the Western
Conference title two years running
wo 11 Id choose anothet team to rep
resent the Big Nine for the second
year.
ARMY STILL MAS CHANCE
Still to be settled, however, was
the question of whether the
northern division of the PCC,
which contains the six schools in
Washington, Oregon. Idaho and
Montana, would press its fight to
have the great Army team play
in the 1 !M7 (this year) game and
thereby delay the start of the
PCC - Big Nine series until the
l!M8 contest.
The Rose Bowl classic, oldest of
(he post-season games, usually nets
the visiting team approximately
$,S0.0()() and, after passing up this
choice figure for almost 25 years,
the Big Nine voted recently, 7 to 2.
to change its mind.
