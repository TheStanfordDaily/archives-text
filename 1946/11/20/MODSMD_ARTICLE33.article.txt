# 'All' Teams- Here Again
## 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
Best you hit for the storm cellar,
friends, tine yearly hurricane of
"All" teams is on us already—All-
American, All-Coast, All-this-and
that, and what have you. The foot
ball season is still far from over,
but some of the various "experts"
evidently don't need the full returns
before arriving at their momentous
decisions.
First under the wire with an All-
American squad is ace New York
U.P. man Oscar Fraley. At ends he
has Hank Foldberg, Army, and Burr
Ba'dwin, U.C.L.A.; tackles, George
Connor, Notre Dame, and Walt
Barnes, L.S.U.; guards, Joe Steffy,
Army, and John Mastrangelo, Notre
Dame; center, Charles Bednarik,
Penn; qb. John Lujack, Notre Dame;
halves, Glenn Davis, Army, and
Charlie Trippi, Georgia; fb, Doc
Blanehard, Army.
Listed on the second squad are
Sqtiirmin' Herman Wedemeyer
and Stanford's own Lloyd Merri
man. It's a funny thing about these
eastern pickers—they never seem
much impressed with western
players, who have managed to win
the Shrine game about two times
out of three. Fraley. for instance,
lists only FOUR men from schools
west of the Mississippi among his
choices.
Sam Baiter, a radio sports com
mentator, has confined himself to
the Coast with his team. Ends, Bald
win and Horace Gillom. Nevada;
tackles, Ferraro, S.C.. and Cham
bers, U.C.L.A.: guards, Garzoni, S.C.,
and Zeger, Washington; center,
Paul, U.C.L.A.; qb. Case, U.C.L.A.;
halves, Wedemeyer, St. Mary's, and
Rossi. U.C.L.A.; and fb, Merriman.
Baiter's picks may well repre
sent the concensus of opinion
among Coast sports authorities,
with the possible exception of Fer
raro and Rossi. The elephantine
Johnny Ferraro has had trouble
untracking himself this year, and
Rossi has been 011 the sidelines
half the season with a broken leg.
That Forrest Hall is a pretty good
half too, you know.
Bud Spencer, Stanford grad and
sports editor of the San Francisco
News, dashed off his Coast picks a
full week ago. He agrees with Bai
ter in eight positions, but names Jim
McPartland of St. Mary's over Fer
raro at tackle, Forrest Hall of U.S.F.
over Rossi, and—of all things—
Mickey McCardle of S.C. over Ernie
"Whattaman" Case at qb.

Rossi. U.C.L.A.; and fb, Merriman.
Baiter's picks may well repre
sent the concensus of opinion
among Coast sports authorities,
with the possible exception of Fer
raro and Rossi. The elephantine
Johnny Ferraro has had trouble
untracking himself this year, and
Rossi has been 011 the sidelines
half the season with a broken leg.
That Forrest Hall is a pretty good
half too, you know.
Bud Spencer, Stanford grad and
sports editor of the San Francisco
News, dashed off his Coast picks a
full week ago. He agrees with Bai
ter in eight positions, but names Jim
McPartland of St. Mary's over Fer
raro at tackle, Forrest Hall of U.S.F.
over Rossi, and—of all things—
Mickey McCardle of S.C. over Ernie
"Whattaman" Case at qb.
Best you hit for the storm cellar,
friends, tine yearly hurricane of
"All" teams is on us already—All-
American, All-Coast, All-this-and
that, and what have you. The foot
ball season is still far from over,
but some of the various "experts"
evidently don't need the full returns
before arriving at their momentous
decisions.
First under the wire with an All-
American squad is ace New York
U.P. man Oscar Fraley. At ends he
has Hank Foldberg, Army, and Burr
Ba'dwin, U.C.L.A.; tackles, George
Connor, Notre Dame, and Walt
Barnes, L.S.U.; guards, Joe Steffy,
Army, and John Mastrangelo, Notre
Dame; center, Charles Bednarik,
Penn; qb. John Lujack, Notre Dame;
halves, Glenn Davis, Army, and
Charlie Trippi, Georgia; fb, Doc
Blanehard, Army.
Listed on the second squad are
Sqtiirmin' Herman Wedemeyer
and Stanford's own Lloyd Merri
man. It's a funny thing about these
eastern pickers—they never seem
much impressed with western
players, who have managed to win
the Shrine game about two times
out of three. Fraley. for instance,
lists only FOUR men from schools
west of the Mississippi among his
choices.
Sam Baiter, a radio sports com
mentator, has confined himself to
the Coast with his team. Ends, Bald
win and Horace Gillom. Nevada;
tackles, Ferraro, S.C.. and Cham
bers, U.C.L.A.: guards, Garzoni, S.C.,
and Zeger, Washington; center,
Paul, U.C.L.A.; qb. Case, U.C.L.A.;
halves, Wedemeyer, St. Mary's, and
Rossi. U.C.L.A.; and fb, Merriman.
