# Hard Work Ahead For Banquet Boys
## 
### 
The rain isn't making Coach Ed
Stamm and his Jayvees happy,
either. The Jay vets were washed
out of their practice field yesterday,
and spent the afternoon chalktalk
ing and making plans for their Ber
keley invasion Saturday.
Stamm is giving the Indian Jun
iors some new plays to spring on the
Ramblers, and if the weatherman
will co-operate they're going to
work hard the rest of the week on
signal drills and dummy blocking
and tackling drills. Lin Wolfe and
Crunch Crane will be working with
the backs on passing and kicking.
The Jayvees will go into the Little-
Big Game as decided underdogs.
The Cal Ramblers have won five out
of their seven games, running up
156 points to their opponents' 59.
The little Bears have a big. fast, and
offensively powerful outfit.
