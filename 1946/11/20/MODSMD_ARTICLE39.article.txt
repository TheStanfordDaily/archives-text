# Indians Plough Through Muddy Drill—Just in Case
## 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
"We're going out today for two reasons. One is that it might
rain Saturday, so we may as well get used to playing in it. The
other is that most of you have been out in this stuff before, either
slogging through the mud or flying missions in it, and we
thought you'd like to go out in it again—-knowing that nobody'll
take a shot at you."

"Okeh, let's get out there and
fight."
That's the way Coach Marchie
Schwartz sent the Big Red Machine
out to practice yesterday, and that's
the way they responded to it.
It was a good practice, too. de
spite the rain. The first and sec
ond teams paired off against each
other, each side calling four plays,
and restricting themselves mostly
to running the hall.
IT WAS NO SECRET
The thirds and fourths paired off
in another corner of the rugby field
—which was practically bone dry
despite the rain—and went through
the same motions, with the excep
tion that they were more inclined
to tossing the ball around.
There was no need for Marchie
to attempt to make this session a
secret one like Monday's; except
for the team and a couple of news
papermen who didn't know en
ough to come in out of the rain,
the joint was deserted.
George Quist, still a question
mark as to starting at right half
Saturday against Cal in the 41) th Big
Game at Berkeley, was out for the
! second straight day minus pads and
; showed quite a bit of semblance to
his former self in tearing through
the line during the light contact
drill.
Mickey Titus, who will start if
Quist doesn't; Marty Anderson, who
traded off with Lloyd Merriman at
full, and Freddy Sanderman, the
second-string left half, were three
other backs who shone like beacons
in the dismal downpour.
LINEMEN WORKED HARD
In the line, the first stringers,
good men all, performed like the
faithful workhorses they are. and
the seconds, thirds, etc., likewise
pcrf(>rmed faithfully.
According to Marchie, the Mof
fat Field meteorologists maintain
i a northwest wind is coming up to
blow all the wetness away from
this regioji. and a rumor from
Berkeley has it that the tarpaulin
has been out on the Memorial Sta
dium field since before the rains
came.
If the weatherman's wrong (an
j unthinkable situation), 'twill be a
boon to the Bears, inasmuch as a
wet field will play more hob with
the Farm's precision T and timing
I and superior speed. The lumbering

Cals will probably be just as happy
to wallow in the mud at Berkeley
Saturday as were the Beavers at
Corvallis some weeks ago.
BEARS SING BLUES
Coach Frank Wickhorst of the
B'ars has been singing the blues
this week, moaning aloud about
the casualties that have hit his
squad. Harry Picper, game cap
tain and one of the top centers on
the Coast, is a doubtful player due
to injuries, as are seatbacks Jack
Jensen, Neil Thrains. and Boh
DalPorto and linemen Rod Franz
and Dave Hirsehler.
The locals are a little better off,
with the return of Quist and Titus
and with no serious injuries due to
the Cougars.

full, and Freddy Sanderman, the
second-string left half, were three
other backs who shone like beacons
in the dismal downpour.
LINEMEN WORKED HARD
In the line, the first stringers,
good men all, performed like the
faithful workhorses they are. and
the seconds, thirds, etc., likewise
pcrf(>rmed faithfully.
According to Marchie, the Mof
fat Field meteorologists maintain
i a northwest wind is coming up to
blow all the wetness away from
this regioji. and a rumor from
Berkeley has it that the tarpaulin
has been out on the Memorial Sta
dium field since before the rains
came.
If the weatherman's wrong (an
j unthinkable situation), 'twill be a
boon to the Bears, inasmuch as a
wet field will play more hob with
the Farm's precision T and timing
I and superior speed. The lumbering

Cals will probably be just as happy
to wallow in the mud at Berkeley
Saturday as were the Beavers at
Corvallis some weeks ago.
BEARS SING BLUES
Coach Frank Wickhorst of the
B'ars has been singing the blues
this week, moaning aloud about
the casualties that have hit his
squad. Harry Picper, game cap
tain and one of the top centers on
the Coast, is a doubtful player due
to injuries, as are seatbacks Jack
Jensen, Neil Thrains. and Boh
DalPorto and linemen Rod Franz
and Dave Hirsehler.
The locals are a little better off,
with the return of Quist and Titus
and with no serious injuries due to
the Cougars.
"We're going out today for two reasons. One is that it might
rain Saturday, so we may as well get used to playing in it. The
other is that most of you have been out in this stuff before, either
slogging through the mud or flying missions in it, and we
thought you'd like to go out in it again—-knowing that nobody'll
take a shot at you."

"Okeh, let's get out there and
fight."
That's the way Coach Marchie
Schwartz sent the Big Red Machine
out to practice yesterday, and that's
the way they responded to it.
It was a good practice, too. de
spite the rain. The first and sec
ond teams paired off against each
other, each side calling four plays,
and restricting themselves mostly
to running the hall.
IT WAS NO SECRET
The thirds and fourths paired off
in another corner of the rugby field
—which was practically bone dry
despite the rain—and went through
the same motions, with the excep
tion that they were more inclined
to tossing the ball around.
There was no need for Marchie
to attempt to make this session a
secret one like Monday's; except
for the team and a couple of news
papermen who didn't know en
ough to come in out of the rain,
the joint was deserted.
George Quist, still a question
mark as to starting at right half
Saturday against Cal in the 41) th Big
Game at Berkeley, was out for the
! second straight day minus pads and
; showed quite a bit of semblance to
his former self in tearing through
the line during the light contact
drill.
Mickey Titus, who will start if
Quist doesn't; Marty Anderson, who
traded off with Lloyd Merriman at
full, and Freddy Sanderman, the
second-string left half, were three
other backs who shone like beacons
in the dismal downpour.
