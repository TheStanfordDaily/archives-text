# Program of Fine Music Draws Capacity Audience
## 
### 
j Foul weather failed to keep lovers of fine music home last night as
students and townspeople crowded Memorial Hall auditorium for a Tues
| day Evening Series program of music performed by the Stanford Uni
versity Symphony and the University Chorus.
A pictorial presentation of Arturo Toscanini's "Hymn of the Nations"

completed an hour of great music
| excellently performed.
The orchestra under the direc
tion of Jan Popper and the chorus
directed by Mack Evans gave per
formances which indicate that
Stanford has a bright future in
music.
Filling the vast Memorial Hall
I stage, the orchestra and 100-voice
I chorus showed by last night's pres
! entation that music need not take
a back-seat to drama or athletics
for student participation and all
campus enjoyment.
The orchestra opened the pro
gram with the sprightly overture to
Mozart's '"Marriage of Figaro." The
chorus followed with Praetorius'
j "Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming."
The first stanza was sung unac
companied; the melody was taken
as a three-part canon for wom
en's voices, men's. voices, and
strings. The presentation was one
of the finest on a program of ex
cellent choral work.
Beta Popper, whose voice is fa-
I miliar to Stanford music lovers,
presented' three Czech songs with
orchestra accompaniment.
The orchestra whirled through
Strauss' "Perpetuum Mobile," and
I the chorus joined the instrumental
-1 ists in a performance of a Negro
; spiritual from the original "Porgy"
j by Dubose Hey ward.
The audience joined the orches
tra and choir in singing "America,"
I closing the first part of the program.
A playing of maestro Arturo Tos
i canini's own vex'sion of Verdi's
"Hymn of the Nations," filmed by
the OWI for its overseas branch,
completed the hour of music on the
' Series program.
Although the film starred Jan
i Peerce, the NBC Symphony Or
chestra, and (he Westminster
Choir, the maestro himself stole
the performance in the superb
close-up shots of his powerful
conducting technique.
For those who have heard per
formances by orchestras under Tos

canini's baton, the shots of the great
Italian conductor leading the NBC
Symphony in the "Hymn of the Na
tions" was a rare treat.
The sound track of the film was
poor but it failed to dull the bril
liance of Toscanini's performance.â€”
