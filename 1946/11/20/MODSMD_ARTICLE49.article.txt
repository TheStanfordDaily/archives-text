# A.E. Housman Liked His Ale
## 
### 
A. E. Housman had only a few
things to say poetically—only those
things which hit him hard. These
he said with impeccable grace. But
he also said them over and over
again.
This was evident yesterday af
ternoon as Wallace Stegner, pro
fessor of English, read from Hous
man's verse in the last of this quar
ter's poetry readings.
Ilousman was mainly interested
in fundamentals—life and death,
particularly death. Ilis main
theme is that death is inevitable;
we're all born under the sentence
of death. lie ca.ls death the "long
sleep," and describes it as the de
stroyer of young beauty, young
love. Hut death is also a comfort
er: it keeps static people at the
height of their glory, emotions in
all their color. In "To an Athlete
Dying Young." Housman rejoices
that the athlete's garland will be
unwithered, that he won't live to
see his "name die before the
man."
Life to Housman waS worse than
death. Life was full of trouble.
Only drinking could release man
momentarily from his painful life.
"Malt does more than Milton can
to justify the ways of man," he says.
Man sits in a tavern while the tem
pest without hurls his plans to emp
tiness. Housman says of our troub
les, "bear them we can, and can
we must. Drink your ale."
