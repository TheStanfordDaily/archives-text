WASHINGTON, Nov. 19 (UP).â€”
Spreading wildcat strikes left almost
100,000 soft coal miners idle tonight
and the government prepared to dim
the lights in the coal-burning east
ern states if John L. Lewis persists
in ignoring a federal injunction
against the general mine shutdown
set for tomorrow midnight.
The army promised tonight to help
maintain peace in I lie coal fields if
the administration wants help in its
wage contract fight.
Meanwhile steel industry spokes
men ignored or denied today a
statement of a high CIO official that
steel companies will shut down im
mediately in event of a coal strike.
