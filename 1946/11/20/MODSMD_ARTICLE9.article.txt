### 
UNITED NATIONS ASSEMBLY HALL, Flushing,
N.Y., Nov. 19 (UP).—The United Nations General As
sembly took a slap at the Security Council today by
urging that it reconsider the rejected membership ap
plications of Ireland, Portugal, Outer Mongolia, Al-

bania and Transjordan.
The Assembly also passed, over
the objections of the United
States. Russia and France, a res
olution designed to strip from the
Security Council some of its
powerful hold over future mem
bership applications.
Delegates from Afghanistan, Ice
land and Sweden sat in the Assem
bly for the first time today. Those
three nations were approved by the
Security Council last August at the
same time it. turned down the other
five applications.
The Assembly started a long
day by electing Belgium, Colom
bia and Syria to the Security
Council and naming the United
States, Venezuela, New Zealand
and Lebanon to the Economic and
Social Council. Then it bogged
down on naming two more mem
bers of the latter body.
All are to replace present mem
bers of the two bodies Jan. 1.
The resolutions on membership
merely "recommended Security
Council action, but that is as strong
as the Assembly can go, and its ac
tion was a reflection of the Assem
bly's displeasure with the Council's
stand on the membership issue.
The steering committee met im
mediately after the Assembly ad
journed and put on its agenda
without objection a I krninian
resolution to have the next mect

ing of the Assembly in Europe.
The proposal now must be argued
in (he Assembly.
The voting became an issue of
j East and West representation on
i the Economic and Social Council
after four of (he six open places
had been filled. Russia and her
adherents pushed for the election
of Byelo-Russia and the re-elec
tion of Yugoslavia while the West
ern powers backed the Nether
lands and Turkey.

NEW YORK, Nov. 19 UP). —Russian Foreign
Minister Viachcslav Molotov has informed Italy that
Russia favors direct negotiations between Italy and
Yugoslavia for a settlement of the Trieste problem
and th? future Italian-Yugoslav frontier, it was made

known tonight.
It was indicated that Russia
made known its approval of di
rect negotiations in hope of win
ning better terms for Yugoslavia
than the foreign ministers have
given in the Italian treaty draft
which they are now completing.
Molotov gave his views in a let
ter to Pietro Quarino, Italian am
bassador to Moscow, who is now
in New York as a member of an
Italian ambassadorial delegation.
The United States replied cool
ly that Ita.y and Yugoslavia might
negotiate if they wished but that
the Big Four would decide whe
ther any agreement could be ap
proved.
The idea of negotiations origi
nated in an offer hv Marshal Tito
of Yugoslavia to Italian oCniinu
nist leader I'almiro Togliatti to
give up claims to Trieste il Italy
ceded the city of Gori/.ia to Yu
goslavia.
lint since then the Big Four
had broken the bottleneck which
(lie Trieste problem had present
ed.and seemed near agreement
on linal treaties for Italy. Roma
nia. Bulgaria. Hungary, and Fin
land. Hence Molotov's Setter, if he
tried to delay the treaty writing
until Italy and Yugoslavia sought
direct negotiations, might prove a
complication. He has been con"
ciliatorv. however, in recent days.
