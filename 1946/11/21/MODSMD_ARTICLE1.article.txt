# One-third of Miners Idle, Truman to Tight It Out'
## 
### 
PITTSBURGH, Nov. 20 (UP).—
Over one-third of the nation's soft
coal miners were idle today, pro
duction dipped sharply and Penn
sylvania's anthracite miners pre
pared to walk out if the courts
crack down on John L. Lewis.
Over 148.000 miners—4B,ooo more
than yesterday—were on strike late
today in Pennsylvania, West Vir
ginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Virginia,
Alabama, Indiana and Illinois.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 20 (UP).
—With the zero hour for a na
tion-wide soft coal walkout al
most at hand, AFL President
William F. Green tonight threw
his support behind UMW boss
John L. Lewis and challenged the
government to dig coal with ei
ther injunctions or hayoncts.
Lewis himself remained silent
on the critical question he must
decide hy tonight — whether to
obey a federal injunction to call
off the walkout or defy it and risk
a iail sentence for contempt of
court.

There was every indication that
the soft coal mines would be shut
clown well before the midnight zero
hour set by John L. Lewis for void
ing the United Mine Workers' gov
ernment contract. Arid there was
the further possibility that the min
ers will not work even if Lewis
should surrender to the govern
ment's anti-strike injunction.
UMW district leaders in the-east
ern Pennsylvania anthracite fields
warned of "trouble" and a sympa
thy work stoppage if Lewis were
jailed for defying the government
injunction. They said their warn
ing was not to be taken to mean
they were terminating the anthra
cite contract.
The latest count showed that
Kentucky was hit hardest by new
walkouts today as 17,800 men struck
to swell the state idle total to
33,900. The count for other states:
West Virginia, 38,000: Pennsylvania,
20,465; Alabama, 17,000: Virginia,
8,000; Indiana, (3,300; and Ohio,
6,000.

KEY WEST, Fla., Nov. 20 (UP).
—Still without word of a truce offer
or a surrender from John L. Lewis,
President Truman tonight weighed
last-minute reports from Washing
ton on the coal crisis but showed no
sign of backing down from his
"fight -it - out" stand toward the
UMW leader.
Mr. Truman received a first-hand
report from Reconversion Director
John R. Steelman and the latter's
top adviser, Judge John Caskie Co
lett. who joined the presidential va
cation party this afternoon after
flying from Washington.
The President later brought
Steelman's report up to the minute
with developments reported to him
from Washington.
With the deadline for the coal
mine walkout only a few hours
away, Mr. Truman appeared deter
mined to stand firm on the "fight"
orders he gave Attorney General
Tom C. Clark and Interior Secre
tary J. A. Krug before he left Wash
ington Sunday.
