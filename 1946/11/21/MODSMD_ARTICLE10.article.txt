# Gaieties Enthusiastically Received on First Night
## 
### HILL COUGHLIN 
{ Bright and shiny as a Cal raider's
| shaven head, last night's Big Game
j Gaieties met with an enthusiastic
i reception from a capacity first-night
| audience, although the rumored ap
pearance of Cal captives failed to
materialize.
This year's production ran more
j smoothly on its first night than most
Gaieties do in their final appearance.
| From out front, it appeared that the
j handicap of not being able to use
I the auditorium for rehearsals during
j the past few days bothered the cast
| very little.
I Star of the show was a wistful
I character, listed variously in the
| program as Rocnir Loebrown, B.
j Nirroc, and Corbrown Rinlee, but
j who bore an amazing resemblance
I to a Brown lee Corrin who appeared

There will be two more per
formances of the 1946 Gaieties.
There will be a matinee tomorrow
afternoon and a final evening
presentation tomorrow night.

| in several Gaieties in pre-war years,
j His flair for comedy is as good as
| ever.
The overtures before the first'
and second acts, consisting of hits

from past Gaieties, carried a touch
of nostalgia for old Stanfordites.
Possibly it is a little unfair to
compare tlie music of this year's
show with the outstanding sensa
tions of the past.
But, don't underrate the songs of
last night's show. "Once in a Life
time" and "This World of Mine,"
both well presented, were the top
numbers. Barbara Rittcrsbacher,
ably assisted by Bob Gettys, proved
herself the best songstress of the
cast in the former number. Roger
Starr, who was a little shaky on his
first number, came back in great
style on "This World of Mine." Eliz
abeth Spies' silhouette dancing in
this latter number was very well
done.
Another cleverly written song,
"Team for Two," was ably vocal
ized by Ilena Jean Black. Shir-
Icy Sleeper's singing in "Carhop's
Lament" was good but the mike
marred it. She doesn't need one.
Although a few lacked strong
enough punch lines, the skits were
good foi a lot of hearty laughs.
Stan Shpetner's grotesque charac
ters were well played.
Unfortunately space limits listing
all those who contributed so nicely
to the evening's entertainment.
