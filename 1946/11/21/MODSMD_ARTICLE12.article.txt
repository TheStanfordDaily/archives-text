Pictured at. the left is one result
of a week's in tor-school raiding be
tween Stanford and the University
of California, done in violation of
the peace pact signed in 1942 by the
student body presidents of both
schools.
Far from a matter of pranks, the
raiding will have the possible con
sequence of expulsion for students
involved from both campuses, ac
cording to Dean Stalnaker of Stan
ford and Dean of Students Stone of
California. Stone issued a state
ment earlier this week that expul
sion would follow for Cal students
proven to have raided the Stanford
campus. Names of students involved
in the Encina captures Tuesday
night arc already known to the au
thorities of both schools.
That Stanford's slate is far from
clean was obvious from the report
ed incidents occurring throughout
the week at Berkeley. Dean Stal
naker said last night that more stu
dents from Stanford had been re
ported guilty of violations than Cal
students.
