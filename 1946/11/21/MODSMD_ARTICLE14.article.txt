# Indian Section To Wear White
## 
### 
Five thousand rooters vs. fifteen
thousand Cal rooters!
In order to compete in appear
ance with the size of the Cal sec
tion, all Stanford rooters must wenr
white sweaters or shirts, according
to Bob Leefeldt, arrangement chair
man of Rally Com.
No one will be admitted to the
section if the.v arc not properly at
tired. Women wearing bandanas
should wear white ones.
"If the weather is cold, students,
of course, should dress warmly,"
said Leefeldt, "All we ask is that
you wear all the sweaters you want
under a white garment.
The committee, however, docs not
expect to carry out the white theme
in the event of a heavy rain.
The white section is* a "must" in
order to put over the Block "S"
according to Leefeldt. Hooters
caps may still be purchased at the
Shack for $1. The caps must be
pulled down over the forehead at
the game Saturday to make the
"S" efYective.
Additional feathers from Eoos
Brothers will be given out at the
Cal game. All rooters arc urged to
bring their megaphones, and the
women, their pom poms and feath
ers.
The section, as tradition states,
will he divided at the Big Game.
