## Why Let George Do It? 
### 
Now that the quarter is almost over, it's
time lor us to gripe about something that has
been bothering us increasingly since the en
rollment went over the 7,000 mark. The over
all indifference as to what goes on around
here and to the problems, big and small,
which student leaders face every day is ap
palling. And it all gees back to one startling
fact: responsibility for conduct of student gov
ernment and student activities is centered in
the hands of no more than about 20 students.
The ■■■[ that student government manages to
roll on without threat of sabotage or loss of
power is due entirely to the vigilance, loyalty,
and interest of the 20 and their perhaps poorly
founded faith in a relatively apathetic student
body.
The unfortunate thing about it all is that
student leaders have to study, too; and the
constant pressure of classes, studies, and re
sponsible student activities tends to detract
from their abilities as student leaders. Few of
the other 6,980 seem to realize this; and those
that do offer little in the way of competent help
in the form of committee work or anything
else.
The prevailing complex seems to be either
one of "let George do it" or "the Irreplaceable
man." And it is this attitude that throws upon
student leaders petty responsibilities which
they should never have to assume.
There is a crying need for competent stu
dents who are willing to undertake the jobs
that a student executive, by the very nature of

his office, should delegate to others. However,
the lack of those students, or their failure to
show their faces for one reason or another,
threatens to make the holding of any leading
office an unwelcome chore.
Those students who do hold lesser posi
tions in the hierarchy of student offices find
themselves overwhelmed with an avalanche
of conflicting and overlapping functions to
perform —functions given them because they
have proven their ability in the many small
jobs leading to positions of responsibility in
A.S.S.U. activities.
Meanwhile, the rest of the students sit by
without interest or participation. When stu
dent officers accomplish something construc
tive and worthwhile, there is little comment.
When an activity or project fails, the gripes fly
from students who, by their indifference, are
the direct cause for its failure.
There is an answer. It lies not in the stu
dent leaders and their few overworked assist
ants, but rather in the 6,000 other men and
women existing here today. It lies in their
potential ability to make Stanford a better
place by active participation in campus life.
The next time something fouls up in stu
dent government, don't get mad and do noth
ing. Offer your help to see that that particular
error won't happen again, or that that particu
lar activity can be made better by your par
ticipation, no matter how small, in it.
And quit putting all the blame and work
on George. He needs a rest. —M.S.
