## BULL SESSION 
### 
Weli, it looks as though the man who came to
look ;il our leaking Daily Shack knew what he was
talking about. It's stopped raining and, by gosh, it
i in't ! ■ .king any more.
Ho ii appears that tonight's festivities will not
be a washout after all. Yesterday's jolly-up and last
night's Gaieties marked the real opening of Stanford's
Big Game activities and the on-campus celebration
reaches a p-?ak tonight with the float parade, rally,
and bonfire.
It's been a little more gradual than it used to be
but that old Big Game Week excitement has been
building up. It's a funny thing, but no matter what
i cokls Cal and Stanford go into this game with, it
almost always turns out to be a terrific battle in
which anything can happen. And visually does (to
corn the phrase). And no matter how poor spirit has
been in a season, it always builds to a tremendous
peak for this one game.
But it is certainly going to be rough on the frosh
today trying to build a respectable bonfire. There's
not much available scrap material. One year, a San
Jcy.o firm contributed thousands of wooden beer
rases which really helped to brew the bear in fine
tyle. But the lumber shortage this fall will really
tax the ingenuity of the Class of '50.
II tonight's float parade is anything like those in
days of yore, I can heartily recommend it to you.
You don't realize what amazing ingenuity is devel
oped on the Farm until you review those floats. Ev
erything from Lady Godiva to the Campanile. Don't
miss it.

From all the post-midnight activity on campus the
past few nights, it seems our guards against raiders
from C;il have been quite vigilant, Have heard sub

stantial rumors that several of our visitors from
across the bay have had their craniums shaved as a
souvenir of their visit to the Farm.
Vague stories have been circulating that a Cal
man is being held prisoner in Encina. In connection
with this, it is even stated that he was put on his
honor to remain in the room while his captors went
off to class. And he stayed, unguarded! That I find
hard to believe. But maybe he likes it here.

Much color should be added to Saturday's game
by the usual banter between the two rooting sections.
In past Big Games, there has always been a lot of
shouting back and forth between the two sections,
both of the usual "Who's got the Axe?— Who's gonna
get it?—Cal, in the neck!" variety and also other
spontaneous yells that may occur to the yell leaders
as appropriate though corny. It's all good clean (?)
fun and all a part of the tremendous spectacle that
is the Stanl'ord-Cal Big Game.

Here's an item for Rally Corn's attention. A Daily
reader writes in to suggest that we need a mascot.
Navy has its goat, Army its mule. And so, he sug
gests, Stanford should find a real, live, red-blooded
American Indian who is out of work and give him a
job as mascot for the Big Red Machine!
It's something to think about. Maybe we should
have one. Get yours now. Don't be outmoded with
a pom-pom, or a tom-tom. Get your American In
dian today. Only $1. You can beat on him at the
Big Game.
And after the season's over, you can use him to
do your laundry and say, "Here!" for you at your 8
o'clocks.
Get your buck for a buck.
