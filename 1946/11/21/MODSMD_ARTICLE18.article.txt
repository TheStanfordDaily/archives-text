lite Republican' battle-cry seems to be' ''econ
omy.' To be sure, not all the words of wisdom seep
in " down from the caucuses and committees repre
sent official Republican policy, if any such there be.
but tlu? politicos of the Grand Old Party seem in
■ übstantial agreement on the point, "economy." Now,
in spite of all the denunciation of "big government,"
bureaucracy," "economic controls," and so on, it
appears that the first of the agencies of government
to be trimmed and pruned are the armed forces.
When there was a war on, our money was poured out
to win it. along with our "sweai, blood, toil, and
tears.' . Now that war is in the past, it is proper thaf
military expenditures be reduced. In fact, they have
already been reduced; in fact, they have already been
slashed to a point that leaves the Navy with two,
count 'em, two, battleships in service, and that
leaves General Eisenhower muttering about his res
ignation, il rumor can be believed.
The practical politician can see, of course, that re
ductions in fatm benefits, for instance, or old-age
pension or Social Security payments might lose votes,
l>u(, ••/•nerally speaking, the Army, Navy, and Air
Forces don't vote. And there are always the gond
ii ailed souls who will insist that the nation can
b< i be defended by hot lunches for the elementary
. ( bonis, and who will cry "fie" on the nasty mili
i.uist who asks for enough money to hold maneuvers
occasionally.
Out there can be no argument on any logical
ba: is with the conclusion that an ineffective, under
trength, untrained military force, still equipped
twenty years from now with the materiel left over
from the recent conflict, is as bad or worse than
no armed services at all! If the American people

have an idea that the l Marines or the/ Seventh Cav
alry are waiting in the wings, ready to dash on and
extricate them from the results of a strong foreign
policy, the American people will look pretty silly
when their nick-of-time boys are outpointed by the
Ruritanian State Police.
And that leads up to another conclusion. The
conservative groups in this country are the propo
nents of the "get tough with Russia" policy. In the
northern United States, the conservatives, politically,
are the Republicans. Who then, logically, should
support measures for a strong Army, etc? The Re
publicans. But who, actually, are proposing, in the
sacred name of economy to still further reduce mili
tary expenditures? The Republicans! The British
M.P.'s who recently "revolted" in the House of Com
mons against Cabinet demands for permanent con
scription could think more clearly. They made the
point that only if Britain was to continue a "get
tough with Russia" were such armaments needed.
This is not to be construed as an attack on Rus
sia. It is an attack on the stupid and short-sighted
policy of trying to save money by starving the serv
ices in peacetime. Such has been our policy after
every war, and we have paid dearly for it in every
next war! In a sense, this application of "economy"
is a retreat to isolationism. We have, right or wrong,
certain international commitments, not least of which
is our obligation to contribute a quota to the armed
forces of the United Nations. This obligation and
others, less solemn but apparently not less binding,
require the maintenance of military forces. If we are
to deliberately fail to do our part in international
affairs in these instances, who can say that we will
live up to our pledges in others?
