"Thieves in the Night" by Ar
thur Koestler. $2.75.
Arthur Koestler, a former Com
munist and citizon of many lands,
now an Englishman and the author
of "Thieves in the Night." is one of
the most well regarded writers of
present - day literature. Whether
"Thieves in the Night" will add to
his reputation as a fictional writer
is doubtful.
JEW VS. ARAB
For there is not much that is fic
tional about "Thieves in the Night." ,
The book tells the story of a Jew- |
ish communal settlement in Pales- 1
tine during the years preceding the |
Second World War, from the time I
it is established in unfriendly Arab |
country until it sends some of its
offspring to form another commu
nity in the desert. Woven into this
evolution are the stories of Joseph,
an English Jew; Simon, hi'' friend; j
and Dina, the victim of German
brutality.
But these characters are only in
cidental. The main purpose of the
book is to present the conflict, not
only between Jew and Arab, but
also between Jew and Jew. and Jew
and English administrator.
INTERESTING PROPAGANDA
The result is something not quite
fiction and not entirely fact. As a
fairly objective document of the is
sues involved in the Holy Land war,
"Thieves in the Night" is a success
ful piece of propaganda, for Arthur
Koestler (like Joseph Conrad before
him) writes English prose far more
successfully than most Englishmen.
As a novel and a work of fiction,
however, "Thieves in the Night" is
not really a novel at all. Koestler's
main purpose was probably not to
write a good novel but a good piece
of interesting propaganda, and in
this respect "Thieves in the Night"
is highly successful. For anyone
who wants to know what the issues
are in Palestine today, the book
should be required reading.
