# Indian Wrriors Primed To Skin Hears Saturday
## 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
Stanford will win the Big Game!
We went down to the Stadium yesterday evening to watch the varsity cavort, and after
watching them for half an hour, we'll venture the opinion that the quoted odds of 2 to 1 or even
odds plus seven points for Cal are strictly underlays.

The boys looked good—and that
Indian backfield is something peo
ple called "Dream Backfield" back
before the war. The Farm line is
slill (he nicest bunch of guys you'll
ever meet —but don't meet them
during a football game. At least, not
during Saturday's epic clash at
Berkeley.
What's this about an epic clash?
Nothing chum, it's only the 49th
Big Tussle twixt the University of
California at Berkeley and I.eland
Stanford. Junior, University. What
is it for? Nothing much—in the
standings—and other than that
just for a hunk of steel they call
"The Stanford Axe."
A r.d if that's all they're rasslin'
about, why are 80,000 people con
gratulating themselves because
they've got tickets for this to-do?
It's college football in all its frivo
lous pageantry and panoply, with a
dash of pomp thrown in (Gov. War
ren will be there).
Mentor Marchie of the Tribe stat
ed affirmatively that George Quist,
the ailing right half, will start at
rh for the Farm, and that Dick Flat
land had finally nosed out Dorsey
Kindler for the center slot. The
only change in personnel of note is
that Gene Martin will alternate be
tween filling in for the right half
and left half.
On the Stadium floor, Marchie
sent the third and fourth strings up
to the north goal to dope out the
Cal plays the JayveeS were trying
out under the aegis of Scout Mai
Elward and Line Coach Phil Bengt
son.
The first and second stringers
worked out at the other end of the
field, the firsts trying local offensive
formations against the seconds Cal
defensive lineups.
Alter an hour of that, the boys
adjourned to the regular j ractice
field to work on their offense under
the lights.
With the exception of those
vripples who are out for the sea
son, all the Indians were hack in
shape and suited up. Quist, wear
ing pads for the first time since
the Washington tilt of two weeks
ago, looked very much like his old
self as he slashed through the
"Bear" line time and again on
slants and bucks.
Wayne Erickson and Mel Kendall,
who sustained a pair of sprained
ankles against the Cougars were go
ing at full strength again. Kendall,
the rangy end for whom great things
are predicted next season, was par
ticularly delighted to be back in
shape and even ran around the field
at full speed just to prove it to the
press.
Little Sabu, the scat half, was al
ternating out of the left-half slot
u ith Bobby Anderson, and if the
ankle was hurting him, he didn't
show it.
Merriman—without mention of
whom no story about the Indians
is complete — was nearing top
shape again (looking as good as
ever) despite a leg knot, while
Buck Brownson, who was calling
signals for the first in place of
Ains Beil, was also looking ex
tremely sharp.
And the line—well. DeSwarte, Bo
ensch, Hachten, Flatland. Madigan,
Wakefield and flail were beginning
to look like boys with a slow burn
on; oncl by Saturday it should break
out into a roaring blaze.
It's like we said . . . Stanford will
win the Big Game.


GENE MARTIN. Stanford's back of all trades, who will alternate
replacing light and left half in Saturday's game.

Mentor Marchie of the Tribe stat
ed affirmatively that George Quist,
the ailing right half, will start at
rh for the Farm, and that Dick Flat
land had finally nosed out Dorsey
Kindler for the center slot. The
only change in personnel of note is
that Gene Martin will alternate be
tween filling in for the right half
and left half.
On the Stadium floor, Marchie
sent the third and fourth strings up
to the north goal to dope out the
Cal plays the JayveeS were trying
out under the aegis of Scout Mai
Elward and Line Coach Phil Bengt
son.
The first and second stringers
worked out at the other end of the
field, the firsts trying local offensive
formations against the seconds Cal
defensive lineups.
Alter an hour of that, the boys
adjourned to the regular j ractice
field to work on their offense under
the lights.
With the exception of those
vripples who are out for the sea
son, all the Indians were hack in
shape and suited up. Quist, wear
ing pads for the first time since
the Washington tilt of two weeks
ago, looked very much like his old
self as he slashed through the
"Bear" line time and again on
slants and bucks.
Wayne Erickson and Mel Kendall,
who sustained a pair of sprained
ankles against the Cougars were go
ing at full strength again. Kendall,
the rangy end for whom great things
are predicted next season, was par
ticularly delighted to be back in
shape and even ran around the field
at full speed just to prove it to the
press.
Little Sabu, the scat half, was al
ternating out of the left-half slot
u ith Bobby Anderson, and if the
ankle was hurting him, he didn't
show it.
Merriman—without mention of
whom no story about the Indians
is complete — was nearing top
shape again (looking as good as
ever) despite a leg knot, while
Buck Brownson, who was calling
signals for the first in place of
Ains Beil, was also looking ex
tremely sharp.
And the line—well. DeSwarte, Bo
ensch, Hachten, Flatland. Madigan,
Wakefield and flail were beginning
to look like boys with a slow burn
on; oncl by Saturday it should break
out into a roaring blaze.
It's like we said . . . Stanford will
win the Big Game.

Stanford will win the Big Game!
We went down to the Stadium yesterday evening to watch the varsity cavort, and after
watching them for half an hour, we'll venture the opinion that the quoted odds of 2 to 1 or even
odds plus seven points for Cal are strictly underlays.

The boys looked good—and that
Indian backfield is something peo
ple called "Dream Backfield" back
before the war. The Farm line is
slill (he nicest bunch of guys you'll
ever meet —but don't meet them
during a football game. At least, not
during Saturday's epic clash at
Berkeley.
What's this about an epic clash?
Nothing chum, it's only the 49th
Big Tussle twixt the University of
California at Berkeley and I.eland
Stanford. Junior, University. What
is it for? Nothing much—in the
standings—and other than that
just for a hunk of steel they call
"The Stanford Axe."

gratulating themselves because
they've got tickets for this to-do?
