# Big Nine in Rose Bowl On Five-Year Contract
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Nov. 20 (UP). —It
will be Illinois or Michigan against
UCLA or USC in the Rose Bowl
Jan. 1, 1C47.
With the great Army team elim
inated as the result of the West
ern Conference - Pacific Coast
Conference pact signed here early
this morning, the nation's two
greatest football circuits take over
a monopoly on the country's old
est post-season gridiron classic.
Meanwhile, representatives of the
two conferences sat back and await
ed the public reaction to the first
inter-conference tie-up of its kind
in collegiate football history.
Army, the "people's choice" for
the Eastern entry this year, was not
without its defenders at the long
drawn out "meeting of the minds"
yesterday. In fact, it was the insist
ence of several of the Pacific Coast
Conference members that Army be
invited this year which stretched a
scheduled five-hour meeting into
14 hours.
The terms of the five-year con
tract featured these points:
1. Each conference is to designate
its own representative and this pre
sumably would be its championship
football team.
2. For the first three years the
Western Conference will select one
of its own member teams.
3. For the fourth and fifth years
the Western Conference will be at
liberty to nominate a competitor
from outside its own ranks. How
ever, the team selected will be sub
ject to approval and invitation of
the Pacific Coast Conference. In
the event the two groups fail to
agree on an outside nominee, then
the Western Conference must send
a member team.
When the sessions broke up this
morning there was no official re
port on how the balloting went,
but it was certain that the West
ern (Big Nine) Conference held
out for immediate operation of
the contract.
They were opposed by a bloc from
the Coast circuit, reportedly headed
by UCLA and USC, which favored
the pact, but did not wish to put it
into effect until Jan. 1, 1948 —pre-
sumably so that Army could be in
vited this year.
The Big Nine opinion, however,
as expressed by a member who re
fused to have his name used, was
that Army had been proselyting
players from colleges and should
"not lie considered."
"For years the Pacific Coast and
Western conferences," a member
i told United Press, "have stood for
purity in collegiate athletics and we
believe the unity of the two confer

ences in the future will help to re
turn the national collegiate football
picture to its pre-war status."
Representatives of both organiza
tions hoped that the pact would he
made permanent for all time to
come.
To handle the details in running
the Hose Bowl Game, an interim
committee was set up. composed of
commissioners Victor O. Schmidt of
the PCC and Kenneth L. (Tug) Wil
son of the Big Nine; representatives
from each of the two conferences;
plus a Tournament of Roses repre
sentative, who would act in an ad
visory capacity.

from outside its own ranks. How
ever, the team selected will be sub
ject to approval and invitation of
the Pacific Coast Conference. In
the event the two groups fail to
agree on an outside nominee, then
the Western Conference must send
a member team.
When the sessions broke up this
morning there was no official re
port on how the balloting went,
but it was certain that the West
ern (Big Nine) Conference held
out for immediate operation of
the contract.
They were opposed by a bloc from
the Coast circuit, reportedly headed
by UCLA and USC, which favored
the pact, but did not wish to put it
into effect until Jan. 1, 1948 —pre-
sumably so that Army could be in
vited this year.
The Big Nine opinion, however,
as expressed by a member who re
fused to have his name used, was
that Army had been proselyting
players from colleges and should
"not lie considered."
"For years the Pacific Coast and
Western conferences," a member
i told United Press, "have stood for
purity in collegiate athletics and we
believe the unity of the two confer

ences in the future will help to re
turn the national collegiate football
picture to its pre-war status."
Representatives of both organiza
tions hoped that the pact would he
made permanent for all time to
come.
To handle the details in running
the Hose Bowl Game, an interim
committee was set up. composed of
commissioners Victor O. Schmidt of
the PCC and Kenneth L. (Tug) Wil
son of the Big Nine; representatives
from each of the two conferences;
plus a Tournament of Roses repre
sentative, who would act in an ad
visory capacity.

With the great Army team elim
inated as the result of the West
ern Conference - Pacific Coast
Conference pact signed here early
this morning, the nation's two
greatest football circuits take over
a monopoly on the country's old
est post-season gridiron classic.
Meanwhile, representatives of the
two conferences sat back and await
ed the public reaction to the first
inter-conference tie-up of its kind
in collegiate football history.
Army, the "people's choice" for
the Eastern entry this year, was not
without its defenders at the long
drawn out "meeting of the minds"
yesterday. In fact, it was the insist
ence of several of the Pacific Coast
Conference members that Army be
invited this year which stretched a
scheduled five-hour meeting into
14 hours.
The terms of the five-year con
tract featured these points:
1. Each conference is to designate
its own representative and this pre
sumably would be its championship
football team.
2. For the first three years the
Western Conference will select one
of its own member teams.
3. For the fourth and fifth years
the Western Conference will be at
liberty to nominate a competitor
from outside its own ranks. How
ever, the team selected will be sub
ject to approval and invitation of
the Pacific Coast Conference. In
the event the two groups fail to
agree on an outside nominee, then
