# Bear Meat Traditional
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
Judgment day for the California
tree climber has arrived! The lethal
business of cremating the lowly
Golden Bear on the Stanford grill
will be carried out tonight just as
has been the custom for 53 previous
barbecues.
The first roasting of the Gold and
Blue took place in 1892. The Bear
was cooked to a tender de
spite reports that bear meat, on sale
for the first time, was going to be
;i little tough that year. Little Oskie
was walloped by the Indian under
dogs 14-10.
TROLLEY BURNED
Most famous of the yearly bon
fire's was that of '29. The class of
33 generated by Sarge Tom Casey
derailed the Toonerville Trolley
which ran from Paly to the campus,
broke it up, and put it in the blaze.
The practically defunct street-car
company gallantly announced that
they hadn't wanted the street car
anyway. But for a company who
thought that their facilities were
just so much junk, the Peninsula
Railroad Company led 200 fresh
men a merry chase hiding their
"prize" in a dark recess of Paly.
Cal was taken that year to the tune
of 21-6.
'2!) was also the year that NBC
made their first broadcast of the
rally.
It was not even necessary in '33
to give the Bears a refined hot
loot for the Redshirts pushed over
their Berkeley brothers 7-3.
•DOODLES' ON HAND
Ten thousand rooters gathered in
1935 to watch the grizzly do a slow
burn. The Axe was on hand for the
first time in any rally. Ex-Farm
rough Doodles Weaver, of the fables
ol the same name, provided the
punch for the rally where the song
sensation of the evening was "Get
the Big Red Toboggan" to the tune
ol "Put on Your Old Grey Bonnet."
The funeral pyre of '35 cost the
alma mater $100.
Eager Cal set ofi the '36 bonfire
prematurely. After Stanford had
squelched the blaze, the do-or-die
Californians did not even stop at
setting an incendiary bomb in the
material. Two immortal roughs
(two minutes of silence is observed
lor them at every bonfire) discov
ered the misslc before it blew up.
1 hat was the night Stanford women
rated "Jeemy" Coffis the ladies' fa
orite on the squad. He is now a
local coach at a San Francisco high
s< hool.

It was not even necessary in '33
to give the Bears a refined hot
loot for the Redshirts pushed over
their Berkeley brothers 7-3.
•DOODLES' ON HAND
Ten thousand rooters gathered in
1935 to watch the grizzly do a slow
burn. The Axe was on hand for the
first time in any rally. Ex-Farm
rough Doodles Weaver, of the fables
ol the same name, provided the
punch for the rally where the song
sensation of the evening was "Get
the Big Red Toboggan" to the tune
ol "Put on Your Old Grey Bonnet."
The funeral pyre of '35 cost the
alma mater $100.
Eager Cal set ofi the '36 bonfire
prematurely. After Stanford had
squelched the blaze, the do-or-die
Californians did not even stop at
setting an incendiary bomb in the
material. Two immortal roughs
(two minutes of silence is observed
lor them at every bonfire) discov
ered the misslc before it blew up.
1 hat was the night Stanford women
rated "Jeemy" Coffis the ladies' fa
orite on the squad. He is now a
local coach at a San Francisco high
s< hool.
Judgment day for the California
tree climber has arrived! The lethal
business of cremating the lowly
Golden Bear on the Stanford grill
will be carried out tonight just as
has been the custom for 53 previous
barbecues.
The first roasting of the Gold and
Blue took place in 1892. The Bear
was cooked to a tender de
spite reports that bear meat, on sale
for the first time, was going to be
;i little tough that year. Little Oskie
was walloped by the Indian under
dogs 14-10.
TROLLEY BURNED
Most famous of the yearly bon
fire's was that of '29. The class of
33 generated by Sarge Tom Casey
derailed the Toonerville Trolley
which ran from Paly to the campus,
broke it up, and put it in the blaze.
The practically defunct street-car
company gallantly announced that
they hadn't wanted the street car
anyway. But for a company who
thought that their facilities were
just so much junk, the Peninsula
Railroad Company led 200 fresh
men a merry chase hiding their
"prize" in a dark recess of Paly.
Cal was taken that year to the tune
of 21-6.
'2!) was also the year that NBC
made their first broadcast of the
rally.
It was not even necessary in '33
