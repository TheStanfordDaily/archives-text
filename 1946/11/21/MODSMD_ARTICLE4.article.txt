# USSR Army Size Asked

### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N. Y„ Nov. 20
(UP). —Russia offered today to re
veal the size and location of all its
armed forces abroad, but the United
States demanded to know, too, the
details of the Soviet armies inside
Russia.
The traditional United Nations
roles of Russia and the U.S. were
reversed at a crowded, excited meet
ing of the general assembly's politi
cal and security committee.
Soviet Foreign Minister Viaches
lav M. Molotov was conciliatory.
But the vehemence of the reply of
Sen. Tom Connaliy, D.Tex., on be
half of the United States startled
delegates. Even American listeners
were surprised by the tone of Con
nally's speech, which apparently had
been prepared in expectation of a
bitter attack by tht Russians con
cerning American troop dispositions.
Molotov did not evade entirely
the question of the size of Soviet,
forces at home. He said that would
come up when the same committee
within a few days tackles the gen
eral question of disarmament, add
ing "we shall be able to reach an
agreed decision when we get down
to it."
