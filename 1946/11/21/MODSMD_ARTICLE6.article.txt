# Special Game Leave Given Instead of 1:30
## 
### 
The 3:30 late leave which Wom
en's Council granted women for
this Saturday night is to be taken
in place of a 1:30 leave, and does
not constitute a non-quota or an
automatic leave. Any girl who
takes a 3:30 on Saturday night
must be in by 12 Friday night
unless she has a floater or a mid
week leave to take on Friday
night.
When taking the Saturday 3:30
leave, women should sign out on
a 1:30 slip, cross off the 1:30 and
write 3:30 above it. Women are I
urged to contact Council mem
bers if there arc any questions.
