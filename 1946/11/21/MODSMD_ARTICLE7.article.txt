# Excom Hears Selection Plan
## 
### 
Acting as a committee to investi
gate possible changes in election
procedure, H. D. Thoreau and Carl
Burke proposed a program to Ex
com last night which would include
primaries and thus exclude finaÂ»l
ballots carrying more than four
persons per office.
The plan would also eliminate
any more than three counts to be
taken on any one ballot.
They advocated a plan for elec
tioneering allowing candidates an
opportunity to campaign within a
specified limit of from $10 to $25.
Each candidate's budget would he
approved by Election Board and
< hecked closely to avoid favorit
ism.
The committee suggested nomi
nation blanks be signed by student
body members at large, and time
and place for polls be left up to
Election Board,
The proposed plan gives the de
cisive authority to Election Board
with approval by Excom. Repre
sentatives will take the suggestions
back to their areas for discussion.
Excom elected Neil Allen, chair
man of the Stanford Interna
tional Survey Committee, as the
official A.S.S.U. delegate to the
Chicago Student Conference Dec.
27-29. Three representatives will
he sent and Allen will he respon
sible for a report to Excom upon
his return.
A group of students to be chosen
by the selection committee of the
survey group will travel to Europe
next summer. According to Allen,
"We want everyone in the student
body to be interested in this project
or it will be useless. If anyone
wants to contact me about it in the
near future they may leave their
names at the A.S.S.U. office or call
me at the A. t .O. house."
Fncina's 1913 constitution with
a few changes was approved and
will go into effect next quarter.
The changes include the election
of only one wingman instead of
two from each corridor who will
serve for only one quarter.
Graduate sponsor Ken Lissant
from Encina also brought up the
question of a policy on interviewing
and selecting sponsors lor the fresh
man- hall. The question was re
ferred for further investigation.
