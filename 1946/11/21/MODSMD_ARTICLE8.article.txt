# Five Cal Raiders Captured, Shaved By Patrol
## 
### 
At least one University of Cali
fornia student felt the wrath of the
Stanford Axe on his head last night
when five raiders from Berkeley
descended on the Farm campus.
A California senior and pre
mcd student, who gave his name
as Hill MaeLcish to the Stanford
freshman who questioned him,
had bis head shaved and painted
with a Cardinal "S."
MacLeish could not be reached
for questioning, but freshman class
members claim he is a veteran of
three years' service in the Marine
Corps and has a wife and child.
Freshmen were on the alert for
tb" raiders when the alarm in En
cina Hall was sounded late Tues
day evening. The Class of '50 gave
chase by automobile and succeeded
in capturing the five Berkeley men.
All five students bad their heads
shaved when Encinamcn found a
can of yellow paint, in one of the
two ears used by the raiders.
University policemen succeeded
in getting two of (hi' raiders away
from the freshmen, two were re
leased, and MacLeish was held.
Yesterday morning the captive
Berkeley student was led in front
of Roble Hall and forced to sere
nade the freshman women. Later
in the morning MacLeish led a
"sing" in the Encina Commons and
during the afternoon he helped
build the Big Game bonfireâ€”under
expert direction from the Class of
'50.
