# HEAVILY FAVORED CARDS FACE RAIN
## It's a Toss-up,' Says Marchie; Team Ready 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
Jiu;t how good the Stanford Indians arc will be decided tomorrow afternoon when the Farm
•squad invades Beikeley to do battle with the U.C. Golden Boars in the 49th renewal of the Big j
Game.
At present the Indians are riding a 2 to 1 crest as favorites (even and seven points), and also i
have the Axe the famed symbol for the possession of which both schools knock themselves
out.
Disregarding the odds quoted in the City, the Tribe's Sachem, Marchie Schwartz, still stout
ly maintained that "the game is a tossup." The coach went further in that vein: "It's just too
ton I'll a battle to dope out in ad- .

vanee."
Well, lie's the coach and he's got
;i right to be pessimistic—if you can
call it that. But the rest of the team
thinks the Berkeley Bear can he
had, and the Injun is willing to risk
his skin to try it.

Raincoats and umbrellas will
not he out of order at Berkeley
tomorrow.
The weatherman predicts heavy
rain today and showers tomorrow
for the San Francisco Bay Area.
Strong winds approaching gale
velocity will strike Northern Cal
ifornia today, bringing cooler
weather and showers tomorrow,
forecasters announce.

Tho Indians can take this game, [
hut not without a fight. If it rains, j
or the field's muddy or slow, it'll
be that much more of a fight. Wet i
grounds will hamper the scats, Bob
Anderson, Wayne Erickson, Lloyd j
Merrimati, et al.
But even if it's wet, the Tribe
has enough power in George i
<iuist, Mickey Titus, Gene Martin
and Mcrriman to make the small
steady gains that make for good
football and touchdowns—but not
from a spectator's viewpoint.
And if the turf is wet, and the ,
ball is dry, then look for Ains Bell,
Jack Brownson and Aub Devine to
do a lot of passing to Dave De-
Swarte, Bob Hall, Titus, Erickson,
Anderson, Dave Brown and Jack
Eller.
If the going is slow, then it'll
be up to the forward wall of the )
Farm — DcSwarte, Fred Boensch, i
Bill Hachtcn, Dick Flatland. Dick
Madigan. Charlie Wakefield, and j
I lit!l—to take the brunt of battle J
upon themselves to see that the
backs have holes to plow through, j
For Bear partisans, the word is j
none too good. With Jackie Jensen, I
their No. 1 offensive weapon, in- [
jured, Bob Dal Porto (Quist's oppo- j
site number), still doubtful; Harry j
Pieper, the game captain and bul
wark of- the line at center, a very
doubtful player; and Rod Franz,
star guard, also out with a bum
leg. the chances of the vaunted Blue
and Gold line to spring an upset are
fairly dim.
Inasmuch as both teams are
playing on the same field and with
the same ball, it stands to reason j
that what affects one side affects |
the other. But not to the same i
degree or proportion. Stanford
has more to lose by the field be
ing wet in the way of timing and
precision for the T-formation, in
the loss of superior speed.
Cal, on the other hand, has much ;
less speed in its offense, and will not i
lose much there; with Jensen hurt, j
the Bear chances are about the
same. And as far as timing and pre- j
cision on Frank Wickhorst's squad i
are concerned—they don't exist in j
nearly the same measure they do at j
Stanford.
So it's all up to the weather—the |
slower the field the harder it will 1
be for the Tribe to get going. And j
if the weather stays good (which is j
doubtful), the Injuns should breeze j
home, the vaunted Bear line not- !
withstanding.
