## End of a Season 
### 
And there's the game to go! Big Game
spirit, rising all week, last night climbed high
as th > flames of the traditional bonfire, and
showed every sign of keeping hotly ablaze
for Saturday's game. It's been a terrific show
for Stanford's thousandsâ€” tKbse here through
the wai when Big Game was only a cherished
rumor, and those returning from war who have
waited to see if old traditions would fit into
a new Farm.
The ingenuity and physical endurance of
F-vt.-ry student who has participated in the
progiarn has been marvelous to watch those
who slaved to build a successful Gaieties, a
KMrins of exhibition floats, a seventy-foot bon

fire, a flawless frosh patrol, an hour-long rally,
a louder band, and a deeply respected var
sity merit the lasting applause of a student j
body that has not been disappointed i/i its
first Big Game week in four years.
What happens in Saturday afternoon's
wind-up will land deeply on the memories of
all, because everybody cares a whale of a
lot who wins. But win or lose, we'll celebrate
into the wee small hours of Sunday the fact <
that Stanford has shown throughout its nine- ;
game season, and most especially through
out its Big Game week, an over-all loyalty
to school, to sportsmanship, and to team which
sits well on the name of Stanford.
