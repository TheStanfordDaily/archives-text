# The 						Big One Comes Back
## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon, Stanford's up and
down football team will charge out onto the
tinf of Berkeley's Memorial Stadium—an inva
sion not to be sneered at in the lair of the
<il 1-too-numerous California Golden Bears.
The occasion will be the 49th renewal of the
Big Game, an occasion the meaning of which
has almost been lost to most of the current
generation on the Farm. It is an occasion of
great festivities during the preceding week—
as you have seen—jolly-ups, Gaieties, rallies,
bonfires, Axe Yells, and uncounted speeches.
Tomorrow it will be a show of pomp and
panorama; 80,000 people is a lot of humanity
to crowd into a concrete bowl; and if a third
of Ihem are student rooters it should make
for more noise than has been heard since
Baker Day.

It will be a fine show; Big Games always
are. And the Daily can ask but one thing of
the Stanford students. We are going to Berke
ley as the guests of the University of Califor
nia. Let's act like guests. The time for paint
ing big red "S's" is over for this year: next
year there'll be another time. The shaven
heads, the defaced buildings, the ruined lawns
— all of it is over for this year. Let's forget
it now.
Let's go up and have a good time-—whether
we win, lose or draw, it'll be a lot of fun and
a good show. If there's any fighting to be
done, we suggest we confine it to the 22 men
who are wearing the colors of their respective j
schools and whom each side will cheer on i
to greater feats on the gridiron.-—Smiley Far- i
