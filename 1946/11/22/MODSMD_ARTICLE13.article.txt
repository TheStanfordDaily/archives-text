# BILL COUGHLIN
## BULL SESSION 
### 
Atrial assault has entered into the Cal-Stanford
feuding.
hi an air raid on the Cal campus yesterday after
noon, three planes bombarded the Bears with 65,000
pieces of common household tissue carrying the
slogan, "Wipe Out the Bears."
The raid, from which all of our planes returned
safely alter encountering no flak or fighter oppo
ilion, was entitled "Operation Scott."
Two of the planes, an AT-6 and an Aeronca
Champion, dropped the tissue while the third, a
Slinson, flew lop cover.
Our intrepid airmen, returning from their peril
on:, mission, stated, "Geez, we've been buying the
.•.tuff for months."
Seems like an awful lot of people are getting un
necessarily bothered about the item in yesterday's
Daily describing a captured Cal raider which read,
. . a California senior and pre-med student, who
gave his name as Bill MacLcish . .
That is not the guy's name. Before printing the
article, the Daily checked with Cal and there is no
Indent registered there under that name.
Give the kids over here credit for a little intelli
v,ellce at least. The Daily isn't out to crucify any
body. The real names of all the raiders, incidentally,
were already known by the administrations of both
universities.

There just wasn't room enough in yesterday's

review to give a pat on the back to everyone who
contributed to making this year's Gaieties a success.
But now that I have my own pasture here on the sec
ond page to roam around in (and no remarks from
you!), I can toss a few more bouquets.
Heard several sour characters inquiring, "What
was so hot about that?" after Wednesday night's
opening. What did they expect, a N.Y. superproduc
tion? Don't forget the Gaieties is a student show
and thus limited in the extent of what can be done
in the same manner as are all student activities.
If those cynics know a way to put on a large ex
travaganza like the Gaieties and still keep from
flunking out of school, I'm sure Bob Ashley and the
rest of the Gaieties crew would like to hear from
them.
A large portion of the credit for this year's suc
cess must go to the behind-scenes personnel, the
stage crew. And I'm sure the cast will be the first to
agree. The timing on the curtains, lighting cues,
and so on, was very well done on the opening night,
an unusual feat.
If you're going to this afternoon's or tonight's per
formance, be sure and notice that scenery. It's pretty
doggone good. Everything from the Golden Gale
Bridge to a drive-in.
But I'm sure that everyone will notice that the
two outstanding things in the Gaieties appear in
the first skit. You'll see what I mean when you sco
them.

the first skit. You'll see what I mean when you sco
them.
(What've they got—the Outlaw?— Op.)
Atrial assault has entered into the Cal-Stanford
feuding.
hi an air raid on the Cal campus yesterday after
noon, three planes bombarded the Bears with 65,000
pieces of common household tissue carrying the
slogan, "Wipe Out the Bears."
The raid, from which all of our planes returned
safely alter encountering no flak or fighter oppo
ilion, was entitled "Operation Scott."
Two of the planes, an AT-6 and an Aeronca
Champion, dropped the tissue while the third, a
Slinson, flew lop cover.
Our intrepid airmen, returning from their peril
on:, mission, stated, "Geez, we've been buying the
.•.tuff for months."
Seems like an awful lot of people are getting un
necessarily bothered about the item in yesterday's
Daily describing a captured Cal raider which read,
. . a California senior and pre-med student, who
gave his name as Bill MacLcish . .
That is not the guy's name. Before printing the
article, the Daily checked with Cal and there is no
Indent registered there under that name.
Give the kids over here credit for a little intelli
v,ellce at least. The Daily isn't out to crucify any
body. The real names of all the raiders, incidentally,
were already known by the administrations of both
universities.

There just wasn't room enough in yesterday's

review to give a pat on the back to everyone who
contributed to making this year's Gaieties a success.
But now that I have my own pasture here on the sec
ond page to roam around in (and no remarks from
you!), I can toss a few more bouquets.
Heard several sour characters inquiring, "What
was so hot about that?" after Wednesday night's
opening. What did they expect, a N.Y. superproduc
tion? Don't forget the Gaieties is a student show
and thus limited in the extent of what can be done
in the same manner as are all student activities.
If those cynics know a way to put on a large ex
travaganza like the Gaieties and still keep from
flunking out of school, I'm sure Bob Ashley and the
rest of the Gaieties crew would like to hear from
them.
A large portion of the credit for this year's suc
cess must go to the behind-scenes personnel, the
stage crew. And I'm sure the cast will be the first to
agree. The timing on the curtains, lighting cues,
and so on, was very well done on the opening night,
an unusual feat.
If you're going to this afternoon's or tonight's per
formance, be sure and notice that scenery. It's pretty
doggone good. Everything from the Golden Gale
Bridge to a drive-in.
But I'm sure that everyone will notice that the
two outstanding things in the Gaieties appear in
the first skit. You'll see what I mean when you sco
them.
