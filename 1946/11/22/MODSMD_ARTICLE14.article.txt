IJuteh Treat" Big Game weekend. The idea that the

(hey split the costs. That may well he doubly true
'his year, and I know that most of the harried males
on campus would be greatly relieved to have at least
I lie fixed costs shared by their dates.
There are going to be more people on more func
' i'»ns this year than ever before, and it's going to be
a strictly mutual weekend as far as fun is concerned.
I think it should be as to the old traditional cost
: baring too.
The average evening date costs lots more this year
than before, so the tradition is even more needed
than ever. Every "rough" I've talked to has wished
l bat this question could be mentioned without any
on- person being called for it. It's a tradition that
I think should be revived—l hope the Stanford
women come through on this one.

I w.-is very interested in George Brunn's article
opposing the suggested legislation which would re-
Irict labor's powers, especially on the closcd shop
i sue. Mr. Brunn writes clearly and concisely. But
he ignores what would seem the most logical solu
tion to a very pressing problem—most logical in the
sense that a war was just fought to decide it. That
question is, How shall we carry on a peaceful, dy
namic. interrelated society and still prevent the Big
from forcing th<? Small to conform to their will, re
gardless of justice and individual rights of man?
In the present case Mr. Brunn apparently figures
that if the Small could be made strong, everything
would iron itself out. If unions were given complete

monopolistic powers, such as the type that big indus
tries hold over small producers by making them join
organizations that restrict output and peg prices- il
the unions could do similar things, only maybe just
a few added on, since they are weaker, then the prob -
lem would be solved.
I hold that two wrongs do not make a right. 11
is better in the long run to abolish evils which are
peculiar to powerful monopolies—both in business
and labor. This could be done by establishing a series
of effective "anti-trust laws" for labor, and by a
more vigorous enforcement of those already in effect
against business cartels.

To the Editor:
This is a warning that Stanford—both the student
body and the administration—would do well to keep
its eye on the '"Village," as the latest member of the-
Stanford family.
There is a spirit of unity there that exists among
no other living group, either on or off campus, that
others would do no harm to themselves to investi
gate and initiate into their own living groups. While
it may be easy to pass off the excuse for this unity by
saying, "Well, they have a lot in common—a war,
you know," yet does that make this spirit unsuitable
for other living groups?
The Villagers have been given the chance to oper
ate under more freedom than any other living group
has ever known. In my opinion, they have proven
themselves capable of handling this freedom with
intelligent government and sensible social activities.
Indeed, the administration of the University may
take the Village as an example of how the entire
student body could live in a new era of student free
dom.
Remember, we're only "versatile villagers," not
"city slickers."

This is a warning that Stanford—both the student
body and the administration—would do well to keep
its eye on the '"Village," as the latest member of the-
Stanford family.
There is a spirit of unity there that exists among
no other living group, either on or off campus, that
others would do no harm to themselves to investi
gate and initiate into their own living groups. While
it may be easy to pass off the excuse for this unity by
saying, "Well, they have a lot in common—a war,
you know," yet does that make this spirit unsuitable
for other living groups?
The Villagers have been given the chance to oper
ate under more freedom than any other living group
has ever known. In my opinion, they have proven
themselves capable of handling this freedom with
intelligent government and sensible social activities.
Indeed, the administration of the University may
take the Village as an example of how the entire
student body could live in a new era of student free
dom.
Remember, we're only "versatile villagers," not
"city slickers."
