# Indians, Bears Spend Half Century Fending
## 
### BOYD HAIGHT 
In March, 1892, the California football captain told a college reporter,
"The Stanford team is nothing but green kids; they play fair football but
they can't do anything against us."
And 54 years of Stanford-California rivalry got under way.
The "kids" from Stanford won that first game with Cal, going on to

I win four more and tie three in the
first eight years of gridiron rivalry
I between the two schools.
California supporters began to
■ cast about for alibis. One writer
I came up with, "Time and time again
! athletes have entered Stanford after
I failing entrance examinations at
! Cal."
Such comment died out after Cal
ifornia gained the winning column.
In 1899 a big Bear eleven smothered
Stanford 30 to 0 for California's first
win over the boys from the Farm.
l iy this time partisanship, even
in the staid Victorian era, was at.a
high pitch when the teams clashed
in the "big game," and Stanford-
Cal rivalry was firmly established.
From the beginning the boys on
the teams took the game seriously,
training for the conflict as they
trained for no other game. In 1894
the Stanford squad went into a se
cret practice session in a ravine
near Woodside five days before the
game. The Cal boys paraded their
talents in practice at the Haight
Street Stadium a week before the
clash.
The next year the Cal team spent
10 clays at Del Monte prepping for
the game while the Stanford grid
ders worked out at Congress
Springs in the Santa Cruz Moun
tains.
In 1806, 11,000 fans were on hand
for the Bear-Indian encounter. By
■ 1899 some showmanship was intro
i duced as the rival teams rolled out
(on the playing field in omnibus
buses a half-hour before the game.
"The two teams were greeted by
great cheers as they were hauled
around the stadium before masses
of madly excited people," a report
er wrote.
A vigorous reaction to the "bru
talities" of football swept the coun
i try in the first decade of the cen
tury and Bear-Indian rivalry on the
I gridiron was switched to rugby in
I 1906.
Stanford won so many games
I that Cal supporters began accusing
Stanford of offering improper in
ducements to high school athletes.
The conflict off the gririron grew so
hot that in 1915 athletic relations
between the two universities were
broken off.
For the next three years Stanford
| played its "Big Game" with Santa
j Clara, but the Bear still remained
j the Indian's chief rival.

Stanford won so many games
I that Cal supporters began accusing
Stanford of offering improper in
ducements to high school athletes.
The conflict off the gririron grew so
hot that in 1915 athletic relations
between the two universities were
broken off.
For the next three years Stanford
| played its "Big Game" with Santa
j Clara, but the Bear still remained
j the Indian's chief rival.
In March, 1892, the California football captain told a college reporter,
"The Stanford team is nothing but green kids; they play fair football but
they can't do anything against us."
And 54 years of Stanford-California rivalry got under way.
The "kids" from Stanford won that first game with Cal, going on to

I win four more and tie three in the
first eight years of gridiron rivalry
I between the two schools.
California supporters began to
■ cast about for alibis. One writer
I came up with, "Time and time again
! athletes have entered Stanford after
I failing entrance examinations at
! Cal."
Such comment died out after Cal
ifornia gained the winning column.
In 1899 a big Bear eleven smothered
Stanford 30 to 0 for California's first
win over the boys from the Farm.
l iy this time partisanship, even
in the staid Victorian era, was at.a
high pitch when the teams clashed
in the "big game," and Stanford-
Cal rivalry was firmly established.
From the beginning the boys on
the teams took the game seriously,
training for the conflict as they
trained for no other game. In 1894
the Stanford squad went into a se
cret practice session in a ravine
near Woodside five days before the
game. The Cal boys paraded their
talents in practice at the Haight
Street Stadium a week before the
clash.
The next year the Cal team spent
10 clays at Del Monte prepping for
the game while the Stanford grid
ders worked out at Congress
Springs in the Santa Cruz Moun
tains.
In 1806, 11,000 fans were on hand
for the Bear-Indian encounter. By
■ 1899 some showmanship was intro
i duced as the rival teams rolled out
(on the playing field in omnibus
buses a half-hour before the game.
"The two teams were greeted by
great cheers as they were hauled
around the stadium before masses
of madly excited people," a report
er wrote.
A vigorous reaction to the "bru
talities" of football swept the coun
