W ill (.lal Make Merry with Merriman?
I hat Bear Line Plays a Manly Game
What -forgive such a horrible thought—if Lloyd Merriman should be
injured early in the game tomorrow? Now stop right here and think, be
fore you go throwing any empty beer bottles or rusty chamber pots in this
direction. It's something that could happen. I don't mean to insinuate that
Lurrupin' Lloyd is a one-man team; there is no such thing, regardless of
what you might read from time to time. But he's about as valuable as a
man could be.
The California forward wall is noted up and down the Coast for its
rugged play -and there's never a rumor about dirty %tctics. A hard
cluu-'-ing, ferocious, clean team can leave as many mangled bodies in its
wak< as the dirtiest that ever played.
Perhaps you remember the Cal-U.C.L.A. game. Two and three Bears
covered star half Cal Rossi on every play, to make sure he wouldn't ramble
the distance. He was sidelined with a broken leg early in the fray, after
which Wickhorst's men concentrated on Ernie Case. He sustained a broken
nose in the last quarter. The Westwooders could have won in a walk,
practically naming the score—but rather than take needless chances at
lui iher injuries they turned conservative and beat Cal at their own game.
Don t ",et me wrong; I'm not charging Cal with dirty play. Rather, I'm
congratulating them. That's the way the game should be played. But
when a star player is smacked hard every time he takes the ball by two
and three big men, something's got to give. His own linemen have to be
a:; rough as the opposition—or more so.

(lonverletl (lalifornian Tells All
All of which leads up to a letter received here in the office. The Daily's
policy has always been to ignore unsigned missives, but this one seems so
pertinent that I've decided to run it as part of this column:
To the Editor:
I'm a former California student who decided to finish his education at
Stanford. The place grows 011 one and I now find my allegiance definitely
settled on the Farm. That's the reason for this letter which, for obvious
reasons, is anonymous.
As a student, I watched California teams for three years before the
war and mister. I don't envy that Stanford line ff it plays against the Bears
the same way it played against Washington and W.S.C. Believe me, those
Bears are ROUGH AND TOUGH.
1 supp >se big guys like Fred Boensch, Charley Wakefield. Bill Hachten,
< t al, are nice to their folks and eat with the right spoon, etc.. but brother,
they don't look tough enough to be on the same field with the Berkeley
hoys. The same goes for most of the rest of the Stanford linemen. I
couldn't help wondering last Saturday if those boys really liked football
and il they would really WANT to win against California enough to get
lough. Believe me, they'd better get a little mean, in self defense, or they'll
come out of the Big Game looking and feeling like they had been put
through a meat grinder.
Of course, there are a few tough boys on our (imagine me saying ''our")
club Dick Madigan is the outstanding example. But poor little Madigan
is just too small. The Bears will push him around like a bag of feathers.
A Converted Californian.
There was more to the letter, but it was in the same vein, and we're
short of space. It's something to think about. Word from Berkeley has it
that the Bear linemen are determined to run the Card forward wall right ;
out of the Stadium. Sgt. Slinger thinks Stanford's team is from two to
lour touchdowns better than Berkeley—on a dry field. The weatherman
says it'll rain, putting everybody back on even terms. I think the Cards
are going to get hot and pull the game out, but they'll have to be awfully
high.
La Belle Dame Sans Clothing
Please forgive me. Mr. Keats; go on back to your grave. I'm just leading
up to the little incident at Burglary, Calif., last Saturday, in which one
Joan Frazier appeared before the Cal rooting section wearing a red dress, j
Ol course the boys started chanting the usual line, and danged if she
DIDN'T take it ofT. at that. But she had a blue bathing suit underneath,
cuss it.
I hate to do this, but I'll have to inform my public (all two of you)
that it wasn't original. They pulled the same gag back a decade ago, when :
old Sgt. Slinger was in high school. I can't remember what foundation
the tomato was wearing but it WASN'T a bathing suit.
Incidentally, the Stanford rooters almost received such a treat at the
U.C.L.A. tilt. The editor of the Daily was approached on the matter; she
was asked to walk in front of the section at half-time, clad in a blue
number. When the Roughs chanted '"Take off that blue dress!" she was
to (ling it over her head and presto, there she'd be in a red bathing suit.
Unfortunately she refused to have anything to do with the stunt. She
flidn t have a red bathing suit. It's probably just as well, though—knobby
knees.
I Yen liar Prognostications
Sgt. Slinger wishes to correct an unfortunate misunderstanding he
unwittingly caused in the middle of last week's cornfield. The offending
line read, "If, Utah wins, the beer's on me." Now of course it's obvious |
that I meant I d set em up for Forrest Hall, the Don half—not every barfly
veteran on campus. Happily I'm informed that Mr. Hall is still in training
and can t imbibe, so I'll have to drink the two cases myself.
Last week's prophecies sent Peculiar Progs up to a marvelous .785) for
the season. But today's cinches (they can't lose) will really make the old !
percentage so;u\ Here they come, so make way. Women and children first:
Trojan is out to put Bruin in red;
What a laugh, friends, they'd best stay in bed.
Dons lasso Cowboys, that's what I pick;
They've at last found a team they can lick.
Ducks tackle Beavers on turf that's quite pasty;
Beavers don't mind 'cause a Duck dinner's tasty.
Montana plays Wash., and it's really a sin;
The Grizzlies? Migawd, they should pay to get in.
Indians crush Bears in struggle so gay;
Til payday all Berkeley is bound to Owe Kay.

Incidentally, the Stanford rooters almost received such a treat at the

was asked to walk in front of the section at half-time, clad in a blue

Army and Notre Dame in the Coliseum on Christmas Day. That's fine,
I,ut it doesn't go far enough—they should hold the game ON NEW YEAR'S

I hat Bear Line Plays a Manly Game
What -forgive such a horrible thought—if Lloyd Merriman should be
injured early in the game tomorrow? Now stop right here and think, be
fore you go throwing any empty beer bottles or rusty chamber pots in this
direction. It's something that could happen. I don't mean to insinuate that
Lurrupin' Lloyd is a one-man team; there is no such thing, regardless of
what you might read from time to time. But he's about as valuable as a
man could be.
The California forward wall is noted up and down the Coast for its
rugged play -and there's never a rumor about dirty %tctics. A hard
cluu-'-ing, ferocious, clean team can leave as many mangled bodies in its
wak< as the dirtiest that ever played.
Perhaps you remember the Cal-U.C.L.A. game. Two and three Bears
covered star half Cal Rossi on every play, to make sure he wouldn't ramble
the distance. He was sidelined with a broken leg early in the fray, after
which Wickhorst's men concentrated on Ernie Case. He sustained a broken
nose in the last quarter. The Westwooders could have won in a walk,
practically naming the score—but rather than take needless chances at
lui iher injuries they turned conservative and beat Cal at their own game.
Don t ",et me wrong; I'm not charging Cal with dirty play. Rather, I'm
congratulating them. That's the way the game should be played. But
when a star player is smacked hard every time he takes the ball by two
and three big men, something's got to give. His own linemen have to be
a:; rough as the opposition—or more so.

(lonverletl (lalifornian Tells All
All of which leads up to a letter received here in the office. The Daily's
policy has always been to ignore unsigned missives, but this one seems so
pertinent that I've decided to run it as part of this column:
To the Editor:
I'm a former California student who decided to finish his education at
Stanford. The place grows 011 one and I now find my allegiance definitely
settled on the Farm. That's the reason for this letter which, for obvious
reasons, is anonymous.
As a student, I watched California teams for three years before the
war and mister. I don't envy that Stanford line ff it plays against the Bears
the same way it played against Washington and W.S.C. Believe me, those
Bears are ROUGH AND TOUGH.
1 supp >se big guys like Fred Boensch, Charley Wakefield. Bill Hachten,
< t al, are nice to their folks and eat with the right spoon, etc.. but brother,
they don't look tough enough to be on the same field with the Berkeley
hoys. The same goes for most of the rest of the Stanford linemen. I
couldn't help wondering last Saturday if those boys really liked football
and il they would really WANT to win against California enough to get
lough. Believe me, they'd better get a little mean, in self defense, or they'll
come out of the Big Game looking and feeling like they had been put
through a meat grinder.
Of course, there are a few tough boys on our (imagine me saying ''our")
club Dick Madigan is the outstanding example. But poor little Madigan
is just too small. The Bears will push him around like a bag of feathers.
A Converted Californian.
There was more to the letter, but it was in the same vein, and we're
short of space. It's something to think about. Word from Berkeley has it
that the Bear linemen are determined to run the Card forward wall right ;
out of the Stadium. Sgt. Slinger thinks Stanford's team is from two to
lour touchdowns better than Berkeley—on a dry field. The weatherman
says it'll rain, putting everybody back on even terms. I think the Cards
are going to get hot and pull the game out, but they'll have to be awfully
high.
La Belle Dame Sans Clothing
Please forgive me. Mr. Keats; go on back to your grave. I'm just leading
up to the little incident at Burglary, Calif., last Saturday, in which one
Joan Frazier appeared before the Cal rooting section wearing a red dress, j
Ol course the boys started chanting the usual line, and danged if she
DIDN'T take it ofT. at that. But she had a blue bathing suit underneath,

(lonverletl (lalifornian Tells All
All of which leads up to a letter received here in the office. The Daily's
policy has always been to ignore unsigned missives, but this one seems so
pertinent that I've decided to run it as part of this column:
To the Editor:
I'm a former California student who decided to finish his education at
Stanford. The place grows 011 one and I now find my allegiance definitely
settled on the Farm. That's the reason for this letter which, for obvious
reasons, is anonymous.
As a student, I watched California teams for three years before the
war and mister. I don't envy that Stanford line ff it plays against the Bears
the same way it played against Washington and W.S.C. Believe me, those
Bears are ROUGH AND TOUGH.
1 supp >se big guys like Fred Boensch, Charley Wakefield. Bill Hachten,
< t al, are nice to their folks and eat with the right spoon, etc.. but brother,
they don't look tough enough to be on the same field with the Berkeley
hoys. The same goes for most of the rest of the Stanford linemen. I
couldn't help wondering last Saturday if those boys really liked football
and il they would really WANT to win against California enough to get
lough. Believe me, they'd better get a little mean, in self defense, or they'll
come out of the Big Game looking and feeling like they had been put
through a meat grinder.
Of course, there are a few tough boys on our (imagine me saying ''our")
club Dick Madigan is the outstanding example. But poor little Madigan
is just too small. The Bears will push him around like a bag of feathers.
A Converted Californian.
There was more to the letter, but it was in the same vein, and we're
short of space. It's something to think about. Word from Berkeley has it
that the Bear linemen are determined to run the Card forward wall right ;
out of the Stadium. Sgt. Slinger thinks Stanford's team is from two to
lour touchdowns better than Berkeley—on a dry field. The weatherman
says it'll rain, putting everybody back on even terms. I think the Cards
are going to get hot and pull the game out, but they'll have to be awfully
high.
La Belle Dame Sans Clothing
Please forgive me. Mr. Keats; go on back to your grave. I'm just leading
up to the little incident at Burglary, Calif., last Saturday, in which one
Joan Frazier appeared before the Cal rooting section wearing a red dress, j
Ol course the boys started chanting the usual line, and danged if she
DIDN'T take it ofT. at that. But she had a blue bathing suit underneath,
cuss it.
I hate to do this, but I'll have to inform my public (all two of you)
that it wasn't original. They pulled the same gag back a decade ago, when :
old Sgt. Slinger was in high school. I can't remember what foundation
the tomato was wearing but it WASN'T a bathing suit.
Incidentally, the Stanford rooters almost received such a treat at the
U.C.L.A. tilt. The editor of the Daily was approached on the matter; she
was asked to walk in front of the section at half-time, clad in a blue
number. When the Roughs chanted '"Take off that blue dress!" she was
to (ling it over her head and presto, there she'd be in a red bathing suit.
Unfortunately she refused to have anything to do with the stunt. She
flidn t have a red bathing suit. It's probably just as well, though—knobby
knees.
I Yen liar Prognostications
Sgt. Slinger wishes to correct an unfortunate misunderstanding he
unwittingly caused in the middle of last week's cornfield. The offending
line read, "If, Utah wins, the beer's on me." Now of course it's obvious |
that I meant I d set em up for Forrest Hall, the Don half—not every barfly
veteran on campus. Happily I'm informed that Mr. Hall is still in training
and can t imbibe, so I'll have to drink the two cases myself.
Last week's prophecies sent Peculiar Progs up to a marvelous .785) for
the season. But today's cinches (they can't lose) will really make the old !
percentage so;u\ Here they come, so make way. Women and children first:
Trojan is out to put Bruin in red;
What a laugh, friends, they'd best stay in bed.
Dons lasso Cowboys, that's what I pick;
They've at last found a team they can lick.
Ducks tackle Beavers on turf that's quite pasty;
Beavers don't mind 'cause a Duck dinner's tasty.
Montana plays Wash., and it's really a sin;
The Grizzlies? Migawd, they should pay to get in.
Indians crush Bears in struggle so gay;
Til payday all Berkeley is bound to Owe Kay.

Peripatetic Paragraphing—ln another column you'll find a story relat

Army and Notre Dame in the Coliseum on Christmas Day. That's fine,
I,ut it doesn't go far enough—they should hold the game ON NEW YEAR'S

What -forgive such a horrible thought—if Lloyd Merriman should be
injured early in the game tomorrow? Now stop right here and think, be
fore you go throwing any empty beer bottles or rusty chamber pots in this
direction. It's something that could happen. I don't mean to insinuate that
Lurrupin' Lloyd is a one-man team; there is no such thing, regardless of
what you might read from time to time. But he's about as valuable as a
man could be.
The California forward wall is noted up and down the Coast for its
rugged play -and there's never a rumor about dirty %tctics. A hard
cluu-'-ing, ferocious, clean team can leave as many mangled bodies in its
wak< as the dirtiest that ever played.
Perhaps you remember the Cal-U.C.L.A. game. Two and three Bears
covered star half Cal Rossi on every play, to make sure he wouldn't ramble
the distance. He was sidelined with a broken leg early in the fray, after
which Wickhorst's men concentrated on Ernie Case. He sustained a broken
nose in the last quarter. The Westwooders could have won in a walk,
practically naming the score—but rather than take needless chances at
lui iher injuries they turned conservative and beat Cal at their own game.
Don t ",et me wrong; I'm not charging Cal with dirty play. Rather, I'm
congratulating them. That's the way the game should be played. But
when a star player is smacked hard every time he takes the ball by two
and three big men, something's got to give. His own linemen have to be

W ill (.lal Make Merry with Merriman?
I hat Bear Line Plays a Manly Game
What -forgive such a horrible thought—if Lloyd Merriman should be
injured early in the game tomorrow? Now stop right here and think, be
fore you go throwing any empty beer bottles or rusty chamber pots in this
direction. It's something that could happen. I don't mean to insinuate that
Lurrupin' Lloyd is a one-man team; there is no such thing, regardless of
what you might read from time to time. But he's about as valuable as a
man could be.
The California forward wall is noted up and down the Coast for its
rugged play -and there's never a rumor about dirty %tctics. A hard
cluu-'-ing, ferocious, clean team can leave as many mangled bodies in its
wak< as the dirtiest that ever played.
Perhaps you remember the Cal-U.C.L.A. game. Two and three Bears
covered star half Cal Rossi on every play, to make sure he wouldn't ramble
the distance. He was sidelined with a broken leg early in the fray, after
which Wickhorst's men concentrated on Ernie Case. He sustained a broken
nose in the last quarter. The Westwooders could have won in a walk,
practically naming the score—but rather than take needless chances at
lui iher injuries they turned conservative and beat Cal at their own game.
Don t ",et me wrong; I'm not charging Cal with dirty play. Rather, I'm
congratulating them. That's the way the game should be played. But
when a star player is smacked hard every time he takes the ball by two
and three big men, something's got to give. His own linemen have to be
a:; rough as the opposition—or more so.

(lonverletl (lalifornian Tells All
All of which leads up to a letter received here in the office. The Daily's
policy has always been to ignore unsigned missives, but this one seems so
pertinent that I've decided to run it as part of this column:
To the Editor:
I'm a former California student who decided to finish his education at
Stanford. The place grows 011 one and I now find my allegiance definitely
settled on the Farm. That's the reason for this letter which, for obvious
reasons, is anonymous.
As a student, I watched California teams for three years before the
war and mister. I don't envy that Stanford line ff it plays against the Bears
the same way it played against Washington and W.S.C. Believe me, those
Bears are ROUGH AND TOUGH.
1 supp >se big guys like Fred Boensch, Charley Wakefield. Bill Hachten,
< t al, are nice to their folks and eat with the right spoon, etc.. but brother,
they don't look tough enough to be on the same field with the Berkeley
hoys. The same goes for most of the rest of the Stanford linemen. I
couldn't help wondering last Saturday if those boys really liked football
and il they would really WANT to win against California enough to get
lough. Believe me, they'd better get a little mean, in self defense, or they'll
come out of the Big Game looking and feeling like they had been put
through a meat grinder.
Of course, there are a few tough boys on our (imagine me saying ''our")
club Dick Madigan is the outstanding example. But poor little Madigan
is just too small. The Bears will push him around like a bag of feathers.
A Converted Californian.
There was more to the letter, but it was in the same vein, and we're
short of space. It's something to think about. Word from Berkeley has it
that the Bear linemen are determined to run the Card forward wall right ;
out of the Stadium. Sgt. Slinger thinks Stanford's team is from two to
lour touchdowns better than Berkeley—on a dry field. The weatherman
says it'll rain, putting everybody back on even terms. I think the Cards
are going to get hot and pull the game out, but they'll have to be awfully
high.
La Belle Dame Sans Clothing
Please forgive me. Mr. Keats; go on back to your grave. I'm just leading
up to the little incident at Burglary, Calif., last Saturday, in which one
Joan Frazier appeared before the Cal rooting section wearing a red dress, j
Ol course the boys started chanting the usual line, and danged if she
DIDN'T take it ofT. at that. But she had a blue bathing suit underneath,
cuss it.
I hate to do this, but I'll have to inform my public (all two of you)
that it wasn't original. They pulled the same gag back a decade ago, when :
old Sgt. Slinger was in high school. I can't remember what foundation
the tomato was wearing but it WASN'T a bathing suit.
Incidentally, the Stanford rooters almost received such a treat at the
U.C.L.A. tilt. The editor of the Daily was approached on the matter; she
was asked to walk in front of the section at half-time, clad in a blue
number. When the Roughs chanted '"Take off that blue dress!" she was
to (ling it over her head and presto, there she'd be in a red bathing suit.
Unfortunately she refused to have anything to do with the stunt. She
flidn t have a red bathing suit. It's probably just as well, though—knobby
knees.
I Yen liar Prognostications
Sgt. Slinger wishes to correct an unfortunate misunderstanding he
unwittingly caused in the middle of last week's cornfield. The offending
line read, "If, Utah wins, the beer's on me." Now of course it's obvious |
that I meant I d set em up for Forrest Hall, the Don half—not every barfly
veteran on campus. Happily I'm informed that Mr. Hall is still in training
and can t imbibe, so I'll have to drink the two cases myself.
