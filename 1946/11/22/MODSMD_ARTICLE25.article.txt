LOS ANGELES, Nov. 21 (UP). —The City Council today invited Army to meet Notre Dame in a
post-season football game here a week before the Rose Bowl game which cold-shouldered the
Military Academy.
The council's resolution was approved unanimously and struck a high note in a series of re
bukes to the Pacific Coast Conference which yesterday shut out the Army from a Rose Bowl bid
by signing a "closed shop" agreement with the Big Nine Conference.

, Councilman Harold Harby, who j
; introduced the resolution, immedi- |
ately telephoned both the Military
Academy and Notre Dame to press !
! the city's invitation and said he re
-1 eeived a "cordial" response and j
j promises to consider the bid.

Alumni of the University of i
| Southern California, which fought |
I the tie-up to the last vote, were j
| threatening to demand that the Tro
| jans pull out of the conference.
Southern California's Athletic
Director Willis (). Hunter, speak- !
ing for his school and U.C.L.A., j
who meet Saturday to decide the j
West's representative in the New
Year's classic, announced the two
local schools went down fighting
the Big Nine agreement.
The Rev. John J. Cavanaugh,
: president of Notre Dame, informed
Harby that his school has had a
rule against post-season games since
1924. but he added:
"Our relations with the Army
have been of the best and their re
action to this invitation might have
a bearing on our own decision."
Football fans took more direct
action themselves as (>OO persons |
who signed themselves "disgusted
but hopeful fans of the Rose Bowl" ;

withdrawal from the game in fa

their objections to the Big Nine
agreement and elimination of Army '
from the bid.
