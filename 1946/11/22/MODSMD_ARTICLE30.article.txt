# Van Dine Tells Of Dutch Valor
## 
### 
The courage and sufferings of the
Dutch people under Nazi rule were
described by Miss Elsa Van Dine,
Belgian astronomer and lecturer, to
the American Association of Uni
versity Women yesterday afternoon
at their regular meeting.
"You cannot imagine how it
crushes a people to he starved,
deprived of all the necessities of
life, with hardly any entertain
ment during the dark, unlightcd
nights."
Miss Van Dine said that every
thing they I'ead, saw, and touched
was permeated with "Nazi rubble."
Propaganda during the war period
would have been amazingly effec
tive if it had not been for the life
saving broadcasts coming from Eng
land, to which most of the popula
tion listened, even though it was
illegal. "After hearing the Nazi side
day after day. you begin thinking
that all they say.could not be lies,
and that is an unhealthy attitude."
Tulip bulks, nourishing though
not tasty, kept many of the Hol
landers alive during the winters.
"In the spring, however, the tu
lips wanted to bloom and not he
eaten, and we were in a more
desperate situation than ever."
The Dutch underground was very
active during the war, and if a Hol
lander was not being helped by this
organization, he belonged to it.
Forged ration books had to be pro
vided to the 250.000 people who were
in hiding every month, and yet
hardly one was missed.
"When the Americans came, ev
eryone had the childish notion
that ruined houses would rise mi
raculously from the ruhhle. food
would be plentiful, and every
thing would be the same as be
fore. Of course, this could not
be, hut the relief that did come
was wonderful."
