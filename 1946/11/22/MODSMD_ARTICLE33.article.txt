# Mineral Science School Created
## 
### 
Establishment of a new School of Mineral Sciences, combining what
were formerly the Departments of Geology and Mining, was announced
yesterday by Dr. Donald B. Tresidder, University President.
LEVORSEN TO HEAD SCHOOL
Dean of the new school, created by action of the University's Board
of Trustees, will be Professor A. Irving Levorsen, who has been head
of the Department of Geology.
Activities of the new school will start Jan. 1. Formerly the Depart
ment of Geology was in the School of Physical Sciences. The Depart
ment of Mining was in the School of Engineering.
FARM'S TENTH SCHOOL
The new dean of what will become Stanford's tenth School joined
the Stanford faculty in September, 1945. He is a past president of the
American Association of Petroleum Geologists, was formerly an inde
pendent research geologist in Tulsa. Okla., and before going into inde
pendent research work was the chief geologist of the Tidewater Oil
Company.
Dr. Tresidder said that the purpose of joining the two departments
was their common interest in minerals and rocks; the fact that basic
training in both fields is similar; and that laboratory techniques com
mon to both fields would enable sharing of facilities, techniques, and
ideas.
Dr. Tresidder estimated that the new school would have an enroll
ment of 100 or more students.
