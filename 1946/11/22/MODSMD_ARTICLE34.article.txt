# Freshmen On the Ball Organize Efficient Guard
## 
### JACK OGLESBY 
A guard defense comparable to the Army's system, and in many re
spects better, has been protecting the campus from invading Cal men for
the past three days.
The class of '50, which has maintained the iron ring, is receiving praise
from upper classmen as being one of the most "on the ball" classes for

several years.
Although the sentinel system
has been run on an entirely vol
unteer basis, it has not lacked in
organization. The frosh's first re
sponsibility had been to guard the
bonfire itself, but the turnout for
the protection of the campus as a
whole has been most effective—
according to several surprised
Cal-men.
Dave Davison was appointed head
of the guard to take care of the
bonfire when the class was getting
plans under way for its building.
He succeeded, with the aid of
between fifty and a hundred men
Wednesday night, in frustrating
the attempts of the Berkeleyitcs.
The Fire Department loaned their
lighting equipment to his crew
and thus the fire was fully illu
minated during the entire night.
A searchlight was kept continu
ously probing the darkness 011 the
outer ring of the area.
Supplementing this watch around
the fire pile itself, were sentinels
throughout the campus. Under the
direction of Wes Fry, six to eight j
cars patrolled the streets and
formed blockades all Wednesday 1
night.
Fry drew up a map of the cam- j
pus which he used to station cars
and road blocks at strategic
places. He appointed men to ,
cars and, during the watch, made j
the rounds checking each post.
Two cars were posted in the \
front of the Quad to sound their •
horns and give the alarm when
ever the enemy got that far into the j
campus.
Patrolling the Quad on foot were
hundreds of men under the direc- t
tion of Rob Christ. They succeeded ■
in fouling up some attempts at !
painting yellow "C's" on buildings, j
Those who did not actually stand
one of the six-hour guard shifts or j
do patrol work stood by at Encinu j
and came rushing to the aid of the
others when the various alarms |
were sounded. The fire burned last
night on schedule.
As one undergraduate put it, "If |
you don't believe it, ask Call"
