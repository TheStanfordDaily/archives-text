# Lewis, UMW To Appear Monday for Contempt
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 21 (UP).—John L. Lewis was cited for
contempt of court today and ordered to appear in the Federal
District Court here Monday to show cause why he should not be
jailed or fined for refusing to call off the soft coal strike.
Cited with Lewis was the United Mine Workers (AFL) Union

which he heads and whose 400,000 *
soft coal miners walked out last |
midnight in defiance of an anli- j
strike injunction issued by the Fed- !
eral Court Monday.
Judge T. Alan Goldsborough, who J
issued the original injunction and j
approved the contempt proceedings, j
ruled that Lewis and the union :
would have to stand trial Wednes
day, Nov. 27, if they fail to clear >
themselves at Monday's hearing.
Goldsborough approved the con- !
tempt citation on a petition from the (
Justice Department which was sup
ported by affidavits from Secretary !
of the Interior J. A. Krug, Secretary
of War Robert P. Patterson and six j
other government agency heads.
He directed that Lewis and the
UMW be brought into court on civil !
rather than criminal contempt
charges. Undei v the civil charge,
there is no limit to the jail sentence
or fine which Goldsborough could
impose, whereas the criminal charge
carries a maximum penalty of only
$1,000 fine and six months' impris
onment.

WELCH, YV.Va., Nov. 21 (CP).
—Two members of the United
Mine Workers were killed in an
isolated section of mountainous
McDowell Connty near here to
night hy an independent coal op
erator who refused to stop haul
ing coal, state police reported.
Richard Parsons, prosecuting
attorney of McDowell County,
and state police are investigating
the shooting. Names of the men
involved were not known by the
state police at headquarters in
Welch because investigating olli
cers had not yet returned from
the scene of the shooting.

Assistant Attorney General John
F. Sonnett set forth in the govern
ment petition that Lewis and the
UMW "wilfully, wrongfully and de
liberately disobeyed and violated"
the temporary injunction issued
Monday.
Lewis' defense was expected to
be that he did not order a strike
but merely terminated the UMW's
wage contract with the govern
ment as of midnight Wednesday.
The government charges that his
contract termination notice actually
was a strike call, since the soft coal
miners operate on a ''no contract,
no work" principle.
