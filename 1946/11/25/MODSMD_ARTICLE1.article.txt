# INDIANS HAPPY -- AXE TO STAY HOME
## Swiss Rescue Americans From Plane Crush in Alps 
### 
MEIRINGEN, SWITZERLAND,
Nov. 24.—UP.—Two tiny Swiss
skiplanes, shuttling between
Meiringen airport and 10,500-
foot Gault Glacier, today
brought down in a little over
live hours 12 Americans who
had been marooned among the
loftiest peaks of the Alps since
last Tuesday with a wrecked
C-53 transport.
From Meiringen, they were hur
ried by ambulance and automobile
to Intcrlaken, where a United States
Army hospital train was waiting to
take them to Vienna. Not counting
sundry cuts and bruises, only one
of the Americans was injured. He
was S Sgt. Wayne G. Folsom of
Postville, la., the transport's crew
chief, whose knee was broken.
SWISS CLIMB DOWN
Hans Cuchi, a member of the 73-
man Swiss rescue party that reached
the Americans yesterday, froze his
feet and hurt a leg. He was brought
down to a hospital on one of the
first flights. His 72 companions will
get down the mountain as they got
up—by climbing.
The first American to be brought
down, Brig. Gen. Loyal M. Hanes
of Manchester, la., chief of Gen.
Mark W. Clark's advisory mission in
Austria, landed at Meiringen at 11:30
a.m. (5:30 a.m., E.S.T.). The last,
Capt. Ralph Tate, Jr., who was the
transport's pilot, reached Meirin
gen at 4:30 p.m. (10:35 a.m., E.S.T.).
Swiss Major Pista V. Hitz, making
a final flight to set the Americans'
personal belongings, said the rescue
was completed just in time, because
another storm was blowing up.
EXTRA PASSENGER
When the 10th and 11th Ameri
cans were brought down, it was es
tablished that there actually was a
12th person on the plane. He was
George Harvey of Iron Mountain,
Mich., a civilian working for the
Army as an oil and lubricants spe
cialist at Munich. The official pas
senger list had contained only 11
names.
Captain Tate, the pilot, said he
was following the regular flight
course from Munich to Marseilles,
via Dijon and around the Alps, when
strong winds blew him into the
mountains. He said that when he
realized where he was, he tried to
gain altitude, but the heavy, fall
ing snow held him down. The gla
cier loomed up suddenly in front of
him, he said, and he made a "forced
landing" on it.

MEIRINGEN, SWITZERLAND,
Nov. 24.—UP.—Two tiny Swiss
skiplanes, shuttling between
Meiringen airport and 10,500-
foot Gault Glacier, today
brought down in a little over
live hours 12 Americans who
had been marooned among the
loftiest peaks of the Alps since
last Tuesday with a wrecked
C-53 transport.
From Meiringen, they were hur
ried by ambulance and automobile
to Intcrlaken, where a United States
Army hospital train was waiting to
take them to Vienna. Not counting
sundry cuts and bruises, only one
of the Americans was injured. He
was S Sgt. Wayne G. Folsom of
Postville, la., the transport's crew
chief, whose knee was broken.
SWISS CLIMB DOWN
Hans Cuchi, a member of the 73-
man Swiss rescue party that reached
the Americans yesterday, froze his
feet and hurt a leg. He was brought
down to a hospital on one of the
first flights. His 72 companions will
get down the mountain as they got
up—by climbing.
The first American to be brought
down, Brig. Gen. Loyal M. Hanes
of Manchester, la., chief of Gen.
Mark W. Clark's advisory mission in
Austria, landed at Meiringen at 11:30
a.m. (5:30 a.m., E.S.T.). The last,
Capt. Ralph Tate, Jr., who was the
transport's pilot, reached Meirin
gen at 4:30 p.m. (10:35 a.m., E.S.T.).
Swiss Major Pista V. Hitz, making
a final flight to set the Americans'
personal belongings, said the rescue
was completed just in time, because
another storm was blowing up.
EXTRA PASSENGER
When the 10th and 11th Ameri
cans were brought down, it was es
tablished that there actually was a
12th person on the plane. He was
George Harvey of Iron Mountain,
Mich., a civilian working for the
Army as an oil and lubricants spe
cialist at Munich. The official pas
senger list had contained only 11
names.
Captain Tate, the pilot, said he
was following the regular flight
course from Munich to Marseilles,
via Dijon and around the Alps, when
strong winds blew him into the
mountains. He said that when he
realized where he was, he tried to
gain altitude, but the heavy, fall
ing snow held him down. The gla
cier loomed up suddenly in front of
him, he said, and he made a "forced
landing" on it.
