# Missing Trophy Rumor False; Big Blade Here
## 
### SMILEY FARKAS 
With little more effort than it
takes to give the "Axe Yell,"
Stanford's Indians put together
i couple of breaks, some fine
'ine plays and some terrific
quarterbacking, and coupled
the works to the running of a .
tew fleet backs and a bit of left
handed passing—all of which
added up to a 25-6 triumph for
he Tribe over California in the
19th Big Game.
The breaks were the recovery of a
trio of Bear fumbles and the in
terception of an equal number of
passes. Two of the touchdowns were
directly due to the interceptions,
while the fumbles effectively trim
med the claws and fangs of the Cals.
INDIANS MAI)
The line play was the work of
about a dozen men, and the Indians
were mad! The job guys like Fred
die Boensch, Dave DeSwarte, Bill
Hachten, Charlie Wakefield, Dick
Flatland, Dick Madigan, Bob Hall,
and the kids that did the subbing
for them—Finney Cox, Dorsey Kin
dlor, Pinkie Phleger, Marty Feld
man, Dave Brown, A 1 Rau, Don
Phelps, Jim Hoey, Ed Keblusek, Bob
Berryman, Ted Burke—was about as
magnificent as you could at;k for
and get these days.
The terrific quarterbacking was i
the work of a kid named Ainslie
Bell, who, if he decides to remain
in school another year, could very j
easily carve himself a niche along- :
side Frankie Albert. The lad called
the best game the Cards played this
year—and it was his left hand that
flipped two touchdown passes and
completed eight of the 1(5 thrown.
172 FROM SCKUM
The backs were the same old I
Stanford backs that have been run- ]
ning all season: Lloyd Morriman,
Bobby Anderson, Wayne Erickson, |
George Quist, Mickey Titus, Gene i
Martin, Marty Anderson. The boys j
took of! around the ends and
crunched through the middle to
rack up 172 yards from scrum. j
It was a well-played game from j
the victors' viewpoint, and the j
Bears—well, Berkeley should have !
stood in bed again. The vaunted
"best defensive line on the coast" !
looked like it had forgotten to bring
its press notices along to show the
Stanford boys. The Card forward
wall wasn't impressed.
HALL INTERCEPTS
The clock had only ticked o(T
I about six minutes when the first In
i dian break broke up the ball game.
: Neither team had gotten any place j
until then, and the Bears tried some
tricky stuff. Didn't work: Hall in
j tercepted on Cal's 24. Quist went
; through right tackle on a trap play
! and was knocked out of bounds on
| the 3. Quist, B. Anderson and Mer
! riman made a yard in three cracks
j at the middle and then Bobby went
| around left end to tally. Marty
I Feldman converted out of Bell's fin -
I gers.
LLOYI) HURT
The game see-sawed until well in
the second period when Mcrriman
j took off on a 17-yard run on an
other trap play. Lloyd was hurt on
that one and didn't get back into
the game; but his absence fired the
Cards to greater feats. Bell flipped
a 27-yard pass to Wayne Erickson
i on the Bear 14. Wayne made seven
j more through the line, and Titus
made it first clown on the three. Af
| ter Marty Anderson lost in two tries,
; Bell passed to Wayne in the end
zone.
Marty redeemed himself right af
i ter the kickofT by intercepting Boots
| Erb's aerial on the 2.3 and carrying
it back to the Bear 7. Bell passed
on the first play to Dave Brown in
I the end zone, and Dave wrapped
his arms and legs around the ball in
holding on to it.
TD No. 1
TD No. 4 for the Tribe came in
the third canto. The Bears broke
up one scoring threat but the In
| dians started on their own 42 and
came back in eight plays with a
score, with Bobby Anderson swim
ming through a sea of Blueshirts
1 for 1(5 yards for the tally. That
made it 25 to 0, and, after George
j Quist was injured, Marchie ran the
third string in—and Cal finally
1 romped through the subs to score,
with Jack Swancr doing it all sin
glehandedly. He rated the TD; he
looked like the only football player
Cal had on the field Saturday.
In the dressing room, the Indians
were quiet and accepted the plaud
its of the crowd like the swell bunch
of guys they arc. Marchie said it
was their best gam?, but the coach
looked worried about Merriman and
his pulled thigh tendon, and George
Quist in the U.C. infirmary.

The Axe went to Berkeley
Saturday and got back to Stan
ford again, but how it happened
reads like E. Phillips Oppen
aeim or Edgar Wallace.
A plan, on the part of Rally
Com, was worked out to get
'he Axe to the Berkeley
Stadium. Several 'mysterious'
phone calls reached Rally Corn
ind student officials here prior
'o Saturday's game, asking
ibout plans to protect the Axo
and deliver it to the stadium. All
calls and inquiries received the
same answer: "It's being taken by
Rally Com on the bus going t') the
game."
BUNDLE FOR BERKELEY
Indeed, Rally Com did climb
aboard the bus with an imposing
looking bundle. But it wasn't the
Axe. The trophy was whisked to
Berkeley unostentatiously in a pri
vate car under watchful eyes.
The football team brought it onto
the field and left it to be guarded
by a segment of the frosh patrol
which had been guarding the cam
pus during Big Game week.
WARREN TO ANDERSON
After the final gun the trophy was
carried across the field where Gov
ernor Warren made the presenta
tion. Following this, several mem
bers of the Indian varsity carried
the Axe into the locker rooms
where it was placed on a pile of
equipment.
At this stage, its return to the
campus started — but without any
plans. Somebody was supposed to
cart the trophy back to the Farm.
But either those asked were not re
turning Saturday night or would
have none of the resultant respon
sibility for carrying it.
Somebody suggested it be placed
in one of the equipment trunk.s
which were being taken back to the
Farm Saturday night. It appears
that no one knew or saw who put
the Axe in the trunk, but it was
placed there.
WHO'S GOT THE AXE?
Sunday, one of the city newspa
pers called the Daily and asked if
j the Axe had been safely returned.
Phone calls went out to everyone
who should or would know if the
trophy was back here. No one
knew.
Finally Sam McDonald of the
S.A.C. Corp Yard called in to say
the truck with the equipment was
in his carc. Then Fred Weintz, as
sistant football manager, and three
men from Stanford Village — Dick
Leland, .Ed Whittemore, and .John
Petersen — walked into the Daily
Shack, picked up the Daily sports
editor, and went down to see Sam
McDonald.
FIVE YOUNG MEN
The five men opened three equip
ment trunks—no Axe —but in the
fourth they found it! Wrapped up
in a red blanket, it lay on a pile of
pads and helmets. "Okeh, now we've
got it; what do we do with it?"
Leave it where it was found?
Take it to the Village? Give it to
the police? That was the best idea.
They took it to the police station
they didn't want it, and finally to
the Daily office. There they got in
dignant about having it. "What if
we'd been Cal men?" they wanted
to know. At any rate, after having
their picture taken with the trophy,
the five men gave it to the police
sergeant who had reconsidered
and he put it away for safe keep
ing.
All five men live at the Vilage,
and all five are in their first year at
the Farm.

pers called the Daily and asked if
j the Axe had been safely returned.
Phone calls went out to everyone
who should or would know if the
trophy was back here. No one
knew.
Finally Sam McDonald of the
S.A.C. Corp Yard called in to say
the truck with the equipment was
in his carc. Then Fred Weintz, as
sistant football manager, and three
men from Stanford Village — Dick
Leland, .Ed Whittemore, and .John
Petersen — walked into the Daily
Shack, picked up the Daily sports
editor, and went down to see Sam
McDonald.
FIVE YOUNG MEN
The five men opened three equip
ment trunks—no Axe —but in the
fourth they found it! Wrapped up
in a red blanket, it lay on a pile of
pads and helmets. "Okeh, now we've
got it; what do we do with it?"
Leave it where it was found?
Take it to the Village? Give it to
the police? That was the best idea.
They took it to the police station
they didn't want it, and finally to
the Daily office. There they got in
dignant about having it. "What if
we'd been Cal men?" they wanted
to know. At any rate, after having
their picture taken with the trophy,
the five men gave it to the police
sergeant who had reconsidered
and he put it away for safe keep
ing.
All five men live at the Vilage,
and all five are in their first year at
the Farm.
With little more effort than it
takes to give the "Axe Yell,"
Stanford's Indians put together
i couple of breaks, some fine
'ine plays and some terrific
quarterbacking, and coupled
the works to the running of a .
tew fleet backs and a bit of left
handed passing—all of which
added up to a 25-6 triumph for
he Tribe over California in the
19th Big Game.
The breaks were the recovery of a
trio of Bear fumbles and the in
terception of an equal number of
passes. Two of the touchdowns were
directly due to the interceptions,
while the fumbles effectively trim
med the claws and fangs of the Cals.
INDIANS MAI)
The line play was the work of
about a dozen men, and the Indians
were mad! The job guys like Fred
die Boensch, Dave DeSwarte, Bill
Hachten, Charlie Wakefield, Dick
Flatland, Dick Madigan, Bob Hall,
and the kids that did the subbing
for them—Finney Cox, Dorsey Kin
dlor, Pinkie Phleger, Marty Feld
man, Dave Brown, A 1 Rau, Don
Phelps, Jim Hoey, Ed Keblusek, Bob
Berryman, Ted Burke—was about as
magnificent as you could at;k for
and get these days.
The terrific quarterbacking was i
the work of a kid named Ainslie
Bell, who, if he decides to remain
in school another year, could very j
easily carve himself a niche along- :
side Frankie Albert. The lad called
the best game the Cards played this
year—and it was his left hand that
flipped two touchdown passes and
completed eight of the 1(5 thrown.
172 FROM SCKUM
The backs were the same old I
Stanford backs that have been run- ]
ning all season: Lloyd Morriman,
Bobby Anderson, Wayne Erickson, |
George Quist, Mickey Titus, Gene i
Martin, Marty Anderson. The boys j
took of! around the ends and
crunched through the middle to
rack up 172 yards from scrum. j
It was a well-played game from j
the victors' viewpoint, and the j
Bears—well, Berkeley should have !
stood in bed again. The vaunted
"best defensive line on the coast" !
looked like it had forgotten to bring
its press notices along to show the
Stanford boys. The Card forward
wall wasn't impressed.
HALL INTERCEPTS
The clock had only ticked o(T
I about six minutes when the first In
i dian break broke up the ball game.
: Neither team had gotten any place j
until then, and the Bears tried some
tricky stuff. Didn't work: Hall in
j tercepted on Cal's 24. Quist went
; through right tackle on a trap play
! and was knocked out of bounds on
| the 3. Quist, B. Anderson and Mer
! riman made a yard in three cracks
j at the middle and then Bobby went
| around left end to tally. Marty
I Feldman converted out of Bell's fin -
I gers.
LLOYI) HURT
The game see-sawed until well in
the second period when Mcrriman
j took off on a 17-yard run on an
other trap play. Lloyd was hurt on
that one and didn't get back into
the game; but his absence fired the
Cards to greater feats. Bell flipped
a 27-yard pass to Wayne Erickson
i on the Bear 14. Wayne made seven
j more through the line, and Titus
made it first clown on the three. Af
| ter Marty Anderson lost in two tries,
; Bell passed to Wayne in the end
zone.
Marty redeemed himself right af
i ter the kickofT by intercepting Boots
| Erb's aerial on the 2.3 and carrying
it back to the Bear 7. Bell passed
on the first play to Dave Brown in
I the end zone, and Dave wrapped
his arms and legs around the ball in
holding on to it.
TD No. 1
TD No. 4 for the Tribe came in
the third canto. The Bears broke
up one scoring threat but the In
| dians started on their own 42 and
came back in eight plays with a
score, with Bobby Anderson swim
ming through a sea of Blueshirts
1 for 1(5 yards for the tally. That
made it 25 to 0, and, after George
j Quist was injured, Marchie ran the
third string in—and Cal finally
1 romped through the subs to score,
with Jack Swancr doing it all sin
glehandedly. He rated the TD; he
looked like the only football player
Cal had on the field Saturday.
In the dressing room, the Indians
were quiet and accepted the plaud
its of the crowd like the swell bunch
of guys they arc. Marchie said it
was their best gam?, but the coach
looked worried about Merriman and
his pulled thigh tendon, and George
Quist in the U.C. infirmary.

The Axe went to Berkeley
Saturday and got back to Stan
ford again, but how it happened
reads like E. Phillips Oppen
aeim or Edgar Wallace.
A plan, on the part of Rally
Com, was worked out to get
'he Axe to the Berkeley
Stadium. Several 'mysterious'
phone calls reached Rally Corn
ind student officials here prior
'o Saturday's game, asking
ibout plans to protect the Axo
and deliver it to the stadium. All
calls and inquiries received the
same answer: "It's being taken by
Rally Com on the bus going t') the
game."
BUNDLE FOR BERKELEY
Indeed, Rally Com did climb
aboard the bus with an imposing
looking bundle. But it wasn't the
Axe. The trophy was whisked to
Berkeley unostentatiously in a pri
vate car under watchful eyes.
The football team brought it onto
the field and left it to be guarded
by a segment of the frosh patrol
which had been guarding the cam
pus during Big Game week.
WARREN TO ANDERSON
After the final gun the trophy was
carried across the field where Gov
ernor Warren made the presenta
tion. Following this, several mem
bers of the Indian varsity carried
the Axe into the locker rooms
where it was placed on a pile of
equipment.
At this stage, its return to the
campus started — but without any
plans. Somebody was supposed to
cart the trophy back to the Farm.
But either those asked were not re
turning Saturday night or would
have none of the resultant respon
sibility for carrying it.
Somebody suggested it be placed
in one of the equipment trunk.s
which were being taken back to the
Farm Saturday night. It appears
that no one knew or saw who put
the Axe in the trunk, but it was
placed there.

and deliver it to the stadium. All
calls and inquiries received the
same answer: "It's being taken by

game."
BUNDLE FOR BERKELEY
Indeed, Rally Com did climb
aboard the bus with an imposing
looking bundle. But it wasn't the
Axe. The trophy was whisked to
Berkeley unostentatiously in a pri
vate car under watchful eyes.
The football team brought it onto
the field and left it to be guarded
by a segment of the frosh patrol
which had been guarding the cam
pus during Big Game week.
WARREN TO ANDERSON
After the final gun the trophy was
carried across the field where Gov
ernor Warren made the presenta
tion. Following this, several mem
bers of the Indian varsity carried
the Axe into the locker rooms
where it was placed on a pile of
equipment.
At this stage, its return to the
campus started — but without any
plans. Somebody was supposed to
cart the trophy back to the Farm.
But either those asked were not re
turning Saturday night or would
have none of the resultant respon
sibility for carrying it.
Somebody suggested it be placed
in one of the equipment trunk.s
which were being taken back to the
Farm Saturday night. It appears
that no one knew or saw who put
the Axe in the trunk, but it was
placed there.
WHO'S GOT THE AXE?
Sunday, one of the city newspa
pers called the Daily and asked if
j the Axe had been safely returned.
Phone calls went out to everyone
who should or would know if the
trophy was back here. No one
knew.
Finally Sam McDonald of the
S.A.C. Corp Yard called in to say
the truck with the equipment was
in his carc. Then Fred Weintz, as
sistant football manager, and three
men from Stanford Village — Dick
Leland, .Ed Whittemore, and .John
Petersen — walked into the Daily
Shack, picked up the Daily sports
editor, and went down to see Sam
McDonald.
FIVE YOUNG MEN
The five men opened three equip
ment trunks—no Axe —but in the
fourth they found it! Wrapped up
in a red blanket, it lay on a pile of
pads and helmets. "Okeh, now we've
got it; what do we do with it?"
Leave it where it was found?
Take it to the Village? Give it to
the police? That was the best idea.
They took it to the police station
they didn't want it, and finally to
the Daily office. There they got in
dignant about having it. "What if
we'd been Cal men?" they wanted
to know. At any rate, after having
their picture taken with the trophy,
the five men gave it to the police
sergeant who had reconsidered
and he put it away for safe keep
ing.
All five men live at the Vilage,
and all five are in their first year at
the Farm.
With little more effort than it
takes to give the "Axe Yell,"
Stanford's Indians put together
i couple of breaks, some fine
'ine plays and some terrific
quarterbacking, and coupled
the works to the running of a .
tew fleet backs and a bit of left
handed passing—all of which
added up to a 25-6 triumph for
he Tribe over California in the
19th Big Game.
The breaks were the recovery of a
trio of Bear fumbles and the in
terception of an equal number of
passes. Two of the touchdowns were
directly due to the interceptions,
while the fumbles effectively trim
med the claws and fangs of the Cals.
INDIANS MAI)
The line play was the work of
about a dozen men, and the Indians
were mad! The job guys like Fred
die Boensch, Dave DeSwarte, Bill
Hachten, Charlie Wakefield, Dick
Flatland, Dick Madigan, Bob Hall,
and the kids that did the subbing
for them—Finney Cox, Dorsey Kin
dlor, Pinkie Phleger, Marty Feld
man, Dave Brown, A 1 Rau, Don
Phelps, Jim Hoey, Ed Keblusek, Bob
Berryman, Ted Burke—was about as
magnificent as you could at;k for
and get these days.
The terrific quarterbacking was i
the work of a kid named Ainslie
Bell, who, if he decides to remain
in school another year, could very j
easily carve himself a niche along- :
side Frankie Albert. The lad called
the best game the Cards played this
year—and it was his left hand that
flipped two touchdown passes and
completed eight of the 1(5 thrown.
172 FROM SCKUM
The backs were the same old I
Stanford backs that have been run- ]
ning all season: Lloyd Morriman,
Bobby Anderson, Wayne Erickson, |
George Quist, Mickey Titus, Gene i
Martin, Marty Anderson. The boys j
took of! around the ends and
crunched through the middle to
rack up 172 yards from scrum. j
It was a well-played game from j
the victors' viewpoint, and the j
Bears—well, Berkeley should have !
stood in bed again. The vaunted
"best defensive line on the coast" !
looked like it had forgotten to bring
its press notices along to show the
Stanford boys. The Card forward
wall wasn't impressed.
HALL INTERCEPTS
The clock had only ticked o(T
I about six minutes when the first In
i dian break broke up the ball game.
: Neither team had gotten any place j
until then, and the Bears tried some
tricky stuff. Didn't work: Hall in
j tercepted on Cal's 24. Quist went
; through right tackle on a trap play
! and was knocked out of bounds on
| the 3. Quist, B. Anderson and Mer
! riman made a yard in three cracks
j at the middle and then Bobby went
| around left end to tally. Marty
I Feldman converted out of Bell's fin -
I gers.
LLOYI) HURT
The game see-sawed until well in
the second period when Mcrriman
j took off on a 17-yard run on an
other trap play. Lloyd was hurt on
that one and didn't get back into
the game; but his absence fired the
Cards to greater feats. Bell flipped
a 27-yard pass to Wayne Erickson
i on the Bear 14. Wayne made seven
j more through the line, and Titus
made it first clown on the three. Af
| ter Marty Anderson lost in two tries,
; Bell passed to Wayne in the end
zone.
Marty redeemed himself right af
i ter the kickofT by intercepting Boots
| Erb's aerial on the 2.3 and carrying
it back to the Bear 7. Bell passed
on the first play to Dave Brown in
I the end zone, and Dave wrapped
his arms and legs around the ball in
holding on to it.
TD No. 1
TD No. 4 for the Tribe came in
the third canto. The Bears broke
up one scoring threat but the In
| dians started on their own 42 and
came back in eight plays with a
score, with Bobby Anderson swim
ming through a sea of Blueshirts
1 for 1(5 yards for the tally. That
made it 25 to 0, and, after George
j Quist was injured, Marchie ran the
third string in—and Cal finally
1 romped through the subs to score,
with Jack Swancr doing it all sin
glehandedly. He rated the TD; he
looked like the only football player
Cal had on the field Saturday.
In the dressing room, the Indians
were quiet and accepted the plaud
its of the crowd like the swell bunch
of guys they arc. Marchie said it
was their best gam?, but the coach
looked worried about Merriman and
his pulled thigh tendon, and George
Quist in the U.C. infirmary.

The Axe went to Berkeley
Saturday and got back to Stan
ford again, but how it happened
reads like E. Phillips Oppen
aeim or Edgar Wallace.
A plan, on the part of Rally
Com, was worked out to get
'he Axe to the Berkeley
Stadium. Several 'mysterious'
phone calls reached Rally Corn

I the end zone, and Dave wrapped
his arms and legs around the ball in
holding on to it.
TD No. 1
TD No. 4 for the Tribe came in
the third canto. The Bears broke
up one scoring threat but the In
| dians started on their own 42 and
came back in eight plays with a
score, with Bobby Anderson swim
ming through a sea of Blueshirts
1 for 1(5 yards for the tally. That
made it 25 to 0, and, after George
j Quist was injured, Marchie ran the
third string in—and Cal finally
1 romped through the subs to score,
with Jack Swancr doing it all sin
glehandedly. He rated the TD; he
looked like the only football player
Cal had on the field Saturday.
In the dressing room, the Indians
were quiet and accepted the plaud
its of the crowd like the swell bunch
of guys they arc. Marchie said it
was their best gam?, but the coach
looked worried about Merriman and
his pulled thigh tendon, and George
Quist in the U.C. infirmary.

The Axe went to Berkeley
Saturday and got back to Stan
ford again, but how it happened
reads like E. Phillips Oppen
aeim or Edgar Wallace.
A plan, on the part of Rally
Com, was worked out to get
'he Axe to the Berkeley
Stadium. Several 'mysterious'
phone calls reached Rally Corn
ind student officials here prior
'o Saturday's game, asking
ibout plans to protect the Axo
and deliver it to the stadium. All
calls and inquiries received the
same answer: "It's being taken by
Rally Com on the bus going t') the
game."
BUNDLE FOR BERKELEY
Indeed, Rally Com did climb
aboard the bus with an imposing
looking bundle. But it wasn't the
Axe. The trophy was whisked to
Berkeley unostentatiously in a pri
vate car under watchful eyes.
The football team brought it onto
the field and left it to be guarded
by a segment of the frosh patrol
which had been guarding the cam
pus during Big Game week.
WARREN TO ANDERSON
After the final gun the trophy was
carried across the field where Gov
ernor Warren made the presenta
tion. Following this, several mem
bers of the Indian varsity carried
the Axe into the locker rooms
where it was placed on a pile of
equipment.
At this stage, its return to the
campus started — but without any
plans. Somebody was supposed to
cart the trophy back to the Farm.
But either those asked were not re
turning Saturday night or would
have none of the resultant respon
sibility for carrying it.
Somebody suggested it be placed
in one of the equipment trunk.s
which were being taken back to the
Farm Saturday night. It appears
that no one knew or saw who put
the Axe in the trunk, but it was
placed there.
WHO'S GOT THE AXE?
Sunday, one of the city newspa
pers called the Daily and asked if
j the Axe had been safely returned.
Phone calls went out to everyone
who should or would know if the
trophy was back here. No one
knew.
Finally Sam McDonald of the
S.A.C. Corp Yard called in to say
the truck with the equipment was
in his carc. Then Fred Weintz, as
sistant football manager, and three
men from Stanford Village — Dick
Leland, .Ed Whittemore, and .John
Petersen — walked into the Daily
Shack, picked up the Daily sports
editor, and went down to see Sam
McDonald.
FIVE YOUNG MEN
The five men opened three equip
ment trunks—no Axe —but in the
fourth they found it! Wrapped up
in a red blanket, it lay on a pile of
pads and helmets. "Okeh, now we've
got it; what do we do with it?"
Leave it where it was found?
Take it to the Village? Give it to
the police? That was the best idea.
They took it to the police station
they didn't want it, and finally to
the Daily office. There they got in
dignant about having it. "What if
we'd been Cal men?" they wanted
to know. At any rate, after having
their picture taken with the trophy,
the five men gave it to the police
sergeant who had reconsidered
and he put it away for safe keep
ing.
All five men live at the Vilage,
and all five are in their first year at
the Farm.
With little more effort than it
takes to give the "Axe Yell,"
Stanford's Indians put together
i couple of breaks, some fine
'ine plays and some terrific
quarterbacking, and coupled
the works to the running of a .
tew fleet backs and a bit of left
handed passing—all of which
added up to a 25-6 triumph for
he Tribe over California in the
19th Big Game.
The breaks were the recovery of a
trio of Bear fumbles and the in
terception of an equal number of
passes. Two of the touchdowns were
directly due to the interceptions,
while the fumbles effectively trim
med the claws and fangs of the Cals.
INDIANS MAI)
The line play was the work of
about a dozen men, and the Indians
were mad! The job guys like Fred
die Boensch, Dave DeSwarte, Bill
Hachten, Charlie Wakefield, Dick
Flatland, Dick Madigan, Bob Hall,
and the kids that did the subbing
for them—Finney Cox, Dorsey Kin
dlor, Pinkie Phleger, Marty Feld
man, Dave Brown, A 1 Rau, Don
Phelps, Jim Hoey, Ed Keblusek, Bob
Berryman, Ted Burke—was about as
magnificent as you could at;k for
and get these days.
The terrific quarterbacking was i
the work of a kid named Ainslie
Bell, who, if he decides to remain
in school another year, could very j
easily carve himself a niche along- :
side Frankie Albert. The lad called
the best game the Cards played this
year—and it was his left hand that
flipped two touchdown passes and
completed eight of the 1(5 thrown.
172 FROM SCKUM
The backs were the same old I
Stanford backs that have been run- ]
ning all season: Lloyd Morriman,
Bobby Anderson, Wayne Erickson, |
George Quist, Mickey Titus, Gene i
Martin, Marty Anderson. The boys j
took of! around the ends and
crunched through the middle to
rack up 172 yards from scrum. j
It was a well-played game from j
the victors' viewpoint, and the j
Bears—well, Berkeley should have !
stood in bed again. The vaunted
"best defensive line on the coast" !
looked like it had forgotten to bring
its press notices along to show the
Stanford boys. The Card forward
wall wasn't impressed.
HALL INTERCEPTS
The clock had only ticked o(T
I about six minutes when the first In
i dian break broke up the ball game.
: Neither team had gotten any place j
until then, and the Bears tried some
tricky stuff. Didn't work: Hall in
j tercepted on Cal's 24. Quist went
; through right tackle on a trap play
! and was knocked out of bounds on
| the 3. Quist, B. Anderson and Mer
! riman made a yard in three cracks
j at the middle and then Bobby went
| around left end to tally. Marty
I Feldman converted out of Bell's fin -
I gers.
LLOYI) HURT
The game see-sawed until well in
the second period when Mcrriman
j took off on a 17-yard run on an
other trap play. Lloyd was hurt on
that one and didn't get back into
the game; but his absence fired the
Cards to greater feats. Bell flipped
a 27-yard pass to Wayne Erickson
i on the Bear 14. Wayne made seven
j more through the line, and Titus
made it first clown on the three. Af
| ter Marty Anderson lost in two tries,
; Bell passed to Wayne in the end
zone.
Marty redeemed himself right af
i ter the kickofT by intercepting Boots
| Erb's aerial on the 2.3 and carrying
it back to the Bear 7. Bell passed
on the first play to Dave Brown in
I the end zone, and Dave wrapped
his arms and legs around the ball in
