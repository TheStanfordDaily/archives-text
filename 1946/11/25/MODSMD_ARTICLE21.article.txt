## Big Game Aftermath 
### 
The rooting and scalping and frenzy is all
over for another year, but the aftermath of
Biy Game week now lies in the hands of
Men's Council. For violating the Stanford-
California peace pact and the Fundamental
Standard, nine Farm men have already been
penalized 20 hours of work at the Convales
cent Home, a bill for damages, and probation
during winter quarter. Additional cases will
be directed to the Council, with its decisions
subject lo approval of the president.
To you who think these penalties are too
harsh, cr that Stanford's trips to Cal were
merely "good clean fun," we want to make a
few points clear.
As of 1942 and the no-raiding peace pact
between the rival student bodies, vandalism
in any form was outlawed. We like to think
that agreements once made can be kept.
When I he fitudents show such signs of weak

ening as were reported last week, the alterna
tives plainly become two: the student bodies
of both schools should either abandon the
agreement, or the students themselves, as its
perpetrators, should take action to enforce it.
Pranks accomplished with red paint and
saws and welding torches should be punished
to the full extent of the law despite the senti
ment that all comes under the heading of Big
Game fun. Ingenious devices have in the past
been employed by Stanford students to avoid
vandalism, yet throw the fear of the Axe into
California rooters. They could have been used
again.
Rumor has it that Big Game week is noth
ing without Cal visitors on campus, arid trips
to Berkeley by the Farmers. But we agree that
when damage is done and violations of the
pact are proven, action should be taken— and
taken by the students themselves.
