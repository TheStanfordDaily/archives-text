# Who's Got the Axe?
## 
### 
First we called Martin Anderson and asked
him "Where's the Axe?" Then we tried to lo
cate Murray Prusmack, team manager, but he
wasn't to be found. Fred Weintz told us it was
probably somewhere with the equipment be
ing lugged back from the Big Game. We call
ed Masters, and Sam McDonald, and members
of Rally Committee, but no one was sure about
the Axe and whether it had gotten safely
home to the Farm.
At 7 p.m., when Daily reporters were still
trying to track down the disappearance rumor,
in walked five men from the Village—not
members of Rally Committee, not football
players, not anyone who should have had the
trophy—and rested the Axe on our desk.
Now we were giad to see it. We thought
it was just fine having the Axe on our desk
where the staff could see it, after all their

work. But having it turn up in the Daily Shack
in just such fashion seemed somewhat anti
climactic after all the hullabaloo that went into
bringing it back to the Farm on Saturday.
Smiley tells us it was offered to him for
safekeeping after the game. He didn't take it,
though, because it meant lugging the weighty
plaque half-way across Berkeley to his car,
and worrying about guarding it through Big
Game evening in the city.
Once upon a time, down here at our Farm,
we had an Axe Society, whose specific pur
pose it was to protect and transport the Axe
to and from each Big Game and rally. They
tended to such details as where the Axe would
be exhibited, and probably would have found
a case for it by now. At any rate we think an
Axe Society is in order again—to keep the
trophy out of our office and back on Cellar dis
play where it belongs.
