# BILL COUGHLIN
## BULL SESSION 
### 
Everything happens to me! After all the excite
ment and hubba-hubba, I missed the Big Game.
I am probably the only Stanford man ever to
drive to Berkeley, spend the afternoon within sight
of the stadium, and not see the game.
Playing iy a traditional game (rah!) that our tong
has every y_ar with our Cal chapter prior to the big
Iracas in the afternoon, I got mashed in the chest and
began spitting blood (gruesome, ain't it?).
So I was immediately carted to the Cal hospital,
within a hundred yards of the stadium.
"I was playing football and got hit and began
spitting blood ..." I started. At this point, a doctor
and two nurses grabbed me and threw me down on a
stretcher and tossed a blanket over me.
"You know. I think ..." I tried again.
"Shut up," said the doctor.
"But . . ."
"Shut up," said the nurses.
"I'm from Stanford," I shouted.
"Aha," they said. One of the nurses immediately
began muttering something to the other about shav
ing my head and painting a "C" on it.
"Take him to X-ray," the doctor ordered. "See
if he's got any busted ribs."
"II lie hasn't, I'll bust one," the nurse threatened,
waving a blue and gold pom-pom in my lace.
"Nuts to you," I said, "Stanford's going to \yin
G. ' It later tinned out my prediction was correct.
So the nurse Wheeled me off down the hall toward
X-ray while a speaker somewhare blared, "Calling
Dr. Kildare, calling Dr. Kildare." I stared at the
ceiling, expecting Lionel Barry more to bend over me
any minute, with a Cal rooter's cap on.

The nurse smiled down at ine. I smiled back. "I
hope it's a boy," 1 murmured sweetly. It later turned i
out my prediction was incorrect. Thank gawd.
They took about six or seven X-rays of me, which i
I autographed for them, and then wheeled me up- ;
stairs and rolled me into a bed.
"Lie quietly," the nurse said. "You are under i
observation and may be here a day or two."
"But the Game," I struggled in my best Rover Boy j
voice, "I gotta get to the game. I just gotta." My ■
ribs sounded like the carillon playing "The Sturdy j
Golden Bear."
I stared out the window at the stadium and
listened to the radio describing the game. One of the
nurses brought a Stanford sticker and stuck it up
over my bed. Someone had placed a white chrysan
themum with a red "S" on it in a glass of water by j
my bed.
The nurses brought me in a tray of food. Stuck
in the grapefruit was a cardboard blue "C." On the
tray was a little blue and gold football player made
of pipe-cleaners kicking a football which was a J
pecan. The nurses joked with me about the game j
and told me I'd better look out for ground glass in j
the food because the cook hated Stanford.
Finally, after I had watched the crowds pour |
from the stadium and it had grown dark, they told
me that the X-rays looked all right and that if I
f?lt O.K. I could leave.
The nurses, who were all really very nice, told me
goodbye, I dressed, and left. As I was going out the
door and down the stairs, I heard one of the doctors !
whisper to another, "Funny, but keeping him out
of the game didn't seem to do a bit of good."
It was a great Big Game.

of the game didn't seem to do a bit of good."
It was a great Big Game.
Everything happens to me! After all the excite
ment and hubba-hubba, I missed the Big Game.
I am probably the only Stanford man ever to
drive to Berkeley, spend the afternoon within sight
of the stadium, and not see the game.
Playing iy a traditional game (rah!) that our tong
has every y_ar with our Cal chapter prior to the big
Iracas in the afternoon, I got mashed in the chest and
began spitting blood (gruesome, ain't it?).
So I was immediately carted to the Cal hospital,
within a hundred yards of the stadium.
"I was playing football and got hit and began
spitting blood ..." I started. At this point, a doctor
and two nurses grabbed me and threw me down on a
stretcher and tossed a blanket over me.
"You know. I think ..." I tried again.
"Shut up," said the doctor.
"But . . ."
"Shut up," said the nurses.
"I'm from Stanford," I shouted.
"Aha," they said. One of the nurses immediately
began muttering something to the other about shav
ing my head and painting a "C" on it.
"Take him to X-ray," the doctor ordered. "See
if he's got any busted ribs."
"II lie hasn't, I'll bust one," the nurse threatened,
waving a blue and gold pom-pom in my lace.
"Nuts to you," I said, "Stanford's going to \yin
G. ' It later tinned out my prediction was correct.
So the nurse Wheeled me off down the hall toward
X-ray while a speaker somewhare blared, "Calling
Dr. Kildare, calling Dr. Kildare." I stared at the
ceiling, expecting Lionel Barry more to bend over me
any minute, with a Cal rooter's cap on.

The nurse smiled down at ine. I smiled back. "I
hope it's a boy," 1 murmured sweetly. It later turned i
out my prediction was incorrect. Thank gawd.
They took about six or seven X-rays of me, which i
I autographed for them, and then wheeled me up- ;
stairs and rolled me into a bed.
"Lie quietly," the nurse said. "You are under i
observation and may be here a day or two."
"But the Game," I struggled in my best Rover Boy j
voice, "I gotta get to the game. I just gotta." My ■
ribs sounded like the carillon playing "The Sturdy j
Golden Bear."
I stared out the window at the stadium and
listened to the radio describing the game. One of the
nurses brought a Stanford sticker and stuck it up
over my bed. Someone had placed a white chrysan
themum with a red "S" on it in a glass of water by j
my bed.
The nurses brought me in a tray of food. Stuck
in the grapefruit was a cardboard blue "C." On the
tray was a little blue and gold football player made
of pipe-cleaners kicking a football which was a J
pecan. The nurses joked with me about the game j
and told me I'd better look out for ground glass in j
the food because the cook hated Stanford.
Finally, after I had watched the crowds pour |
from the stadium and it had grown dark, they told
me that the X-rays looked all right and that if I
f?lt O.K. I could leave.
The nurses, who were all really very nice, told me
goodbye, I dressed, and left. As I was going out the
door and down the stairs, I heard one of the doctors !
whisper to another, "Funny, but keeping him out
of the game didn't seem to do a bit of good."
