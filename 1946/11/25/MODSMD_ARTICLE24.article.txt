UNITKD (?) NATIONS
The "little" countries complain angrily about the
veto power, under which no action in the Security
Council is possible without an affirmative vote by the
Big Five. The Big Five have made it clear that they
won't give it up.
The U.S. delegation has proposed to limit veto
use to "important matters," but it would still be up
to the discretion of every country to decide what is
important. The Russians won't hear of this—they
want no limitation of any kind.
With the veto in operation U.N. is little more than
a spectacular discussion forum as far is its most im
portant aim, maintenance of peace, is concerned.
While the American proposal would enable more
efficient handling of minor issues, action is blocked
on any item of importance. The Big Five do not
agree on Palestine, Greece, Spain, atomic control,
trusteeships—and these are the issues that must be
settled.
It is doubtful, however, whether anything more
would be accomplished without the veto. Not one
of the Big Five nations would accept an unfavorable
decision on any matter it considers vital. U.N. would
not have much power to enforce it and if it tried the
country concerned might withdraw.
Veto or no veto, U.N. can therefore only act when
the large countries agree, which they don't often do.
Hopes that the present organization can keep the
peace are hopes only, hopes that will not be ful
filled.
This loose association of sovereign nations re

sembles in many respects the ineffectual confedera- i
tion of sovereign American stales that preceded the
U.S. It, too, depended entirely on the good will and
co-operation of the states and hence found itself
stymied on most significant issues.
Only when the people of each of the thirteen 1
states delegated a considerable degree of their sov
ereignty to a higher authority to form the United
States was effective government possible.
This is not intended to be a history lesson. U.N.
has been in operation for a year and a half. It has
not even agreed on a place to disagree. It took months
of argument to reach any kind of decision on the
fate of a srrtall city on the Adriatic. No atomic con
trol is in sight. Nothing has been done and nothing
will be to curb Soviet control over the Balkans, Brit
ish domination of Greece and Palestine. American j
intervention in China.
The statesmen, who know precisely how meaning
less U.N. is at present, are continuing power politics !
on a new grand scale. The old idea that if you can
just get people to sit down at a table together they
will work out a reasonable solution has not worked 1
here.
Discussion of the veto power is a waste of time.
It serves only to obscure the problem, the problem
of whether we shall continue to have a streamlined
brand of the same international politics that have
always meant war or whether we can be aroused
to work for a government of. lor. and by the people
of the world.

won't give it up.
The U.S. delegation has proposed to limit veto
use to "important matters," but it would still be up
to the discretion of every country to decide what is
important. The Russians won't hear of this—they
want no limitation of any kind.
With the veto in operation U.N. is little more than
a spectacular discussion forum as far is its most im
portant aim, maintenance of peace, is concerned.
While the American proposal would enable more
efficient handling of minor issues, action is blocked
on any item of importance. The Big Five do not
agree on Palestine, Greece, Spain, atomic control,
trusteeships—and these are the issues that must be
settled.
It is doubtful, however, whether anything more
would be accomplished without the veto. Not one
of the Big Five nations would accept an unfavorable
decision on any matter it considers vital. U.N. would
not have much power to enforce it and if it tried the
country concerned might withdraw.
Veto or no veto, U.N. can therefore only act when
the large countries agree, which they don't often do.
Hopes that the present organization can keep the
peace are hopes only, hopes that will not be ful
filled.
This loose association of sovereign nations re

sembles in many respects the ineffectual confedera- i
tion of sovereign American stales that preceded the
U.S. It, too, depended entirely on the good will and
co-operation of the states and hence found itself
stymied on most significant issues.
Only when the people of each of the thirteen 1
states delegated a considerable degree of their sov
ereignty to a higher authority to form the United
States was effective government possible.
This is not intended to be a history lesson. U.N.
has been in operation for a year and a half. It has
not even agreed on a place to disagree. It took months
of argument to reach any kind of decision on the
fate of a srrtall city on the Adriatic. No atomic con
trol is in sight. Nothing has been done and nothing
will be to curb Soviet control over the Balkans, Brit
ish domination of Greece and Palestine. American j
intervention in China.
The statesmen, who know precisely how meaning
less U.N. is at present, are continuing power politics !
on a new grand scale. The old idea that if you can
just get people to sit down at a table together they
will work out a reasonable solution has not worked 1
here.
Discussion of the veto power is a waste of time.
It serves only to obscure the problem, the problem
of whether we shall continue to have a streamlined
brand of the same international politics that have
always meant war or whether we can be aroused
to work for a government of. lor. and by the people
of the world.
