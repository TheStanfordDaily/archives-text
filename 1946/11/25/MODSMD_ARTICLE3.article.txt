# Railroad Slowdown Due to Coal Strike
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Nov. 24 (UP). â€”
Railroads throughout the nation
curtailed and rearranged train
schedules tonight, effective at
1:59 p.m., because of the strike of
the United iVlinc Workers, but re
ports indicated the traveling pub
lic generally would be less incon
venienced than it was during the
UMW strike of last May.
Although the railroads, in com
pliance with an order of De
fense Transportation, discontinued
scores of trains, they effected a
large percentage of fuel savings
by combining trains. And since
May, many railroads have ob
tained diesel locomotives, which
burn oil.
Chicago, the nation's largest
railroad center, will be hardest
hit by curtailment in services, be
cause so many railroads have ter
minals here.
