# Farm Crew Beats Cal; Others Lose
## 
### 
It was Big Game day in more
sports than varsity football at Ber
keley Saturday afternoon. Six Stan
ford teams journeyed across the bay
but only two were able to return
home as victors. The biggest victory
for the Farm was the varsity foot
ball 25-6 triumph over the Golden
Bear (see story page 1).
The only other triumph for the
local lads was in the 1,000-meter
crew race on the Oakland Estuary
Saturday morning when Coach Carl
Pederson's squad swept to a length
and-a-half victory over the heavily
favored Bears.
The Indians had only a two-week
practice session behind them, while
the Bears have been in training
since last spring. The winning time
was 3 minutes and 27 seconds for
Ihe course.
Spectators lining the bridge
spanning the estuary and the float
belonging to the Bears' rowing
club saw the Indian shell spurt
to a slight eighth-of-a-length lead
at the outset of the contest. A
brisk wind and an incoming tide
favored both shells and for the
first hundred yards or so it was a
bow-to-bow race.
The Cal shell, however, deviated
slightly from its intended course,
which gave the Indians an opportu
nity to stretch hteir lead to a full
shell length.
At the bridge—lso yards from the
finish—it was Stanford by a length
and a half and the race was in the
bag. The Indians had started with
a 37-stroke count per minute and
finished with a beat of 34 strokes.
In the stroke position was Bill
Whitford; No. 7, Mark Ansell; 6,
Bob Hoyt; 5, Norm Schreiber; 4,
Bob Phillips; 3, Gerry Grunwald; 2,
Mel Savage; 1, George Benedict; and
coxswain, Student Coach Lou Lind
say.
JV CREW LOSES
Stanford's Jayvees, most of them
rowing their first race, were slow to
co-ordinate their stroke, allowing
the Cal crew to take the lead in the
second contest of the morning. The
Bears were in full command from
start to finish, with the Indians clos
ing the winning yap to three lengths
at the finish line.
Stroke for the Jayvees was Bob
Scothorn; No. 7. Ward O'Malley; 6,
Ted Sheridan; 5, Jim Benniman; 4.
Jay Tuott; 3. Stan Cumberpateh; 2.
Hoyt Leisure; 1, Karl Wente; and
coxswain. George Oppe.l.
Varsity coxswain Lindsay was
unable to take the traditional

dunking because of a war injury,
s*o the crew chose Whitford as his
proxy and dunked the protesting
stroke in the cold waters of the
estuary.
Next race for the ,Stanfords will
be against U.C.L.A. next quarter,
with the remaining races to be run
off in the spring.
WATER POLOISTS LOSE
In the other events, the Indians
didn't do as well. The champion
ship water polo team, unbeaten
since it dropped a 10-9 decision to
the Olympic Club in the first game
of the season, took an 8 ?o (5 defeat
from the Berkeleyans in the Cal
pool Saturday morning.
A tipped shot by Joe Widman
of the Bears in the last .'lO seconds
gave the Blue and Gold their de
cisive point. The goal killed a
Farm rally which brought the
score to 7-6 in favor of the Bears.
Dick Narver had narrowed the
count by swimming the length of
the pool to blaze a tally into the
nets. Widman's. score came a min
ute later and handed the Indians
their second setback of the other
wise very successful — including
the PCC Southern Division title
—season.
The leading scorer of the contest
was Cal's Don Beanston who made
three scores, while for the Farm

Harry Borchers pounded home two
tallies.
GRIDDERS LOSE, 13-6
The Jayvee gridders, out to emu
late their big brothers, instead re
ceipted for a 13-6 victory on
Edwards Field at Berkeley. The
Stammmen had been originally
scheduled for the preliminary game
at Memorial Stadium, but the con
dition of the turf there forced the
switch in location so as not to chop
up the field before the Big Game. '
The Cal Ramblers rammed
across two quick touchdowns in
the third period to give them the
winning margin. Jack Sloan ran
a Stanford punt hack to the Indian
28 from where the Ramblers
worked the hall down to the 1-
yard line, at which stage Will
Lotter carried it across.
A minute later, the Ramblers re
covered a Cardinal fumble and that
drive was climaxed five plays later
when Bill Montague broke through
left tackle to go 19 yards to tally.
Mohn converted.
The lone Indian tally came in the
final frame when Dave Melton
pitched a short pass to Earl Stites
in the flat. The Farm end then gal
loped 42 yards to avert a shutout
for the local team.
BOOTERS LOSE, 4-1
The final Farm Joss at the hands of
the Bears was in soccer where the
Indians took a 4 to 1 licking from
the undefeated and league-leading
Berkeley team. The loss virtually
eliminated Stanford from the league
title.

The Bears tallied in the second
frame on Tom Wood's boot, and
came back after the half with thiee
more tallies, Phil Arnot and Pete
Moreno scoring in the third period—
where the Farm booters racked up
their lone tally—and Israel Wein
burg in the fourth.

GRIDDERS LOSE, 13-6
The Jayvee gridders, out to emu
late their big brothers, instead re
ceipted for a 13-6 victory on
Edwards Field at Berkeley. The
Stammmen had been originally
scheduled for the preliminary game
at Memorial Stadium, but the con
dition of the turf there forced the
switch in location so as not to chop
up the field before the Big Game. '
The Cal Ramblers rammed
across two quick touchdowns in
the third period to give them the
winning margin. Jack Sloan ran
a Stanford punt hack to the Indian
28 from where the Ramblers
worked the hall down to the 1-
yard line, at which stage Will
Lotter carried it across.
A minute later, the Ramblers re
covered a Cardinal fumble and that
drive was climaxed five plays later
when Bill Montague broke through
left tackle to go 19 yards to tally.
Mohn converted.
The lone Indian tally came in the
final frame when Dave Melton
pitched a short pass to Earl Stites
in the flat. The Farm end then gal
loped 42 yards to avert a shutout
for the local team.
BOOTERS LOSE, 4-1
The final Farm Joss at the hands of
the Bears was in soccer where the
Indians took a 4 to 1 licking from
the undefeated and league-leading
Berkeley team. The loss virtually
eliminated Stanford from the league
title.

The Bears tallied in the second
frame on Tom Wood's boot, and
came back after the half with thiee
more tallies, Phil Arnot and Pete
Moreno scoring in the third period—
where the Farm booters racked up
their lone tally—and Israel Wein
burg in the fourth.
It was Big Game day in more
sports than varsity football at Ber
keley Saturday afternoon. Six Stan
ford teams journeyed across the bay
but only two were able to return
home as victors. The biggest victory
for the Farm was the varsity foot
ball 25-6 triumph over the Golden
Bear (see story page 1).
The only other triumph for the
local lads was in the 1,000-meter
crew race on the Oakland Estuary
Saturday morning when Coach Carl
Pederson's squad swept to a length
and-a-half victory over the heavily
favored Bears.
The Indians had only a two-week
practice session behind them, while
the Bears have been in training
since last spring. The winning time
was 3 minutes and 27 seconds for
Ihe course.
Spectators lining the bridge
spanning the estuary and the float
belonging to the Bears' rowing
club saw the Indian shell spurt
to a slight eighth-of-a-length lead
at the outset of the contest. A
brisk wind and an incoming tide
favored both shells and for the
first hundred yards or so it was a
bow-to-bow race.
The Cal shell, however, deviated
slightly from its intended course,
which gave the Indians an opportu
nity to stretch hteir lead to a full
shell length.
At the bridge—lso yards from the
finish—it was Stanford by a length
and a half and the race was in the
bag. The Indians had started with
a 37-stroke count per minute and
finished with a beat of 34 strokes.

first hundred yards or so it was a
bow-to-bow race.
The Cal shell, however, deviated
slightly from its intended course,
which gave the Indians an opportu
nity to stretch hteir lead to a full
shell length.
At the bridge—lso yards from the
finish—it was Stanford by a length
and a half and the race was in the
bag. The Indians had started with
a 37-stroke count per minute and
finished with a beat of 34 strokes.
In the stroke position was Bill
Whitford; No. 7, Mark Ansell; 6,
Bob Hoyt; 5, Norm Schreiber; 4,

say.
JV CREW LOSES
Stanford's Jayvees, most of them
rowing their first race, were slow to
co-ordinate their stroke, allowing

second contest of the morning. The
Bears were in full command from
start to finish, with the Indians clos
ing the winning yap to three lengths
at the finish line.

Hoyt Leisure; 1, Karl Wente; and

s*o the crew chose Whitford as his
proxy and dunked the protesting
stroke in the cold waters of the
estuary.
Next race for the ,Stanfords will
be against U.C.L.A. next quarter,
with the remaining races to be run
off in the spring.
WATER POLOISTS LOSE
In the other events, the Indians
didn't do as well. The champion
ship water polo team, unbeaten
since it dropped a 10-9 decision to
the Olympic Club in the first game
of the season, took an 8 ?o (5 defeat
from the Berkeleyans in the Cal
pool Saturday morning.
A tipped shot by Joe Widman
of the Bears in the last .'lO seconds
gave the Blue and Gold their de
cisive point. The goal killed a
Farm rally which brought the
score to 7-6 in favor of the Bears.
Dick Narver had narrowed the
count by swimming the length of
the pool to blaze a tally into the
nets. Widman's. score came a min
ute later and handed the Indians
their second setback of the other
wise very successful — including
the PCC Southern Division title
—season.
The leading scorer of the contest
was Cal's Don Beanston who made
three scores, while for the Farm

Harry Borchers pounded home two
tallies.
GRIDDERS LOSE, 13-6
The Jayvee gridders, out to emu
late their big brothers, instead re
ceipted for a 13-6 victory on
Edwards Field at Berkeley. The
Stammmen had been originally
scheduled for the preliminary game
at Memorial Stadium, but the con
dition of the turf there forced the
switch in location so as not to chop
up the field before the Big Game. '
The Cal Ramblers rammed
across two quick touchdowns in
the third period to give them the
winning margin. Jack Sloan ran
a Stanford punt hack to the Indian
28 from where the Ramblers
worked the hall down to the 1-
yard line, at which stage Will
Lotter carried it across.
A minute later, the Ramblers re
covered a Cardinal fumble and that
drive was climaxed five plays later
when Bill Montague broke through
left tackle to go 19 yards to tally.
Mohn converted.
The lone Indian tally came in the
final frame when Dave Melton
pitched a short pass to Earl Stites
in the flat. The Farm end then gal
loped 42 yards to avert a shutout
for the local team.
BOOTERS LOSE, 4-1
The final Farm Joss at the hands of
the Bears was in soccer where the
Indians took a 4 to 1 licking from
the undefeated and league-leading
Berkeley team. The loss virtually
eliminated Stanford from the league
title.

The Bears tallied in the second
frame on Tom Wood's boot, and
came back after the half with thiee
more tallies, Phil Arnot and Pete
Moreno scoring in the third period—
where the Farm booters racked up
their lone tally—and Israel Wein
burg in the fourth.
It was Big Game day in more
sports than varsity football at Ber
keley Saturday afternoon. Six Stan
ford teams journeyed across the bay
but only two were able to return
home as victors. The biggest victory
for the Farm was the varsity foot
ball 25-6 triumph over the Golden
Bear (see story page 1).
The only other triumph for the
local lads was in the 1,000-meter
crew race on the Oakland Estuary
Saturday morning when Coach Carl
Pederson's squad swept to a length
and-a-half victory over the heavily
favored Bears.
The Indians had only a two-week
practice session behind them, while
the Bears have been in training
since last spring. The winning time
was 3 minutes and 27 seconds for
Ihe course.
Spectators lining the bridge
spanning the estuary and the float
belonging to the Bears' rowing
club saw the Indian shell spurt
to a slight eighth-of-a-length lead
at the outset of the contest. A
brisk wind and an incoming tide
favored both shells and for the
