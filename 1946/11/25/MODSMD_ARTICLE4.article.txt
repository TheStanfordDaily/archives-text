### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 24 (UP).
â€”In a final press conference before
their scheduled departure for Bos
ton today, members of the United
Nations sub-committee again indi
cated their keen interest in the San
Francisco Presidio as a possible site
for permanent U.N. headquarters.
The 15 committeemen and their
party of secretaries and interpre
ters were to take oft for Boston at
(5 p.m. in a chartered American Air
lines plane. They ' will remain in
Boston until Wednesday to inspect
three locations and will return to
New York Wednesday night.
GROUP IMPRESSED
At today's press conference, Dr.
Eduardo Zuleta, chairman of the
U.N. headquarters committee, said
his group had been especially im
pressed by "the very important pos
sibilities inherent in the San Fran
cisco Presidio."
He said the "already existing fa
cilities, accessibility and natural
beauty" of the mid-city Army post
made it seem ideal for the United
Nations' purposes.
NO DECISION
"We have stated before, no final
decision can be made now," Zuleta
said. "Our report will go to the
full headquarters committee and
then the General Assembly will
make the choice of a permanent
site."
He said the sub-committee's re
port would probably be submitted
during the first week of December.
During their tour of the San
Francisco Bay area the committee
considered the Presidio, the Crystal
Springs area on the San Francisco
Peninsula, and several sites in the
East Bay and Monterey.
