# Reserves Form New Unit
## 
### 
Major Leon M. Henderson, commanding officer of the United States
Marine Corps Organized Reserve Squadron for the 12th Marine Reserve
District, has announced that the newly formed squadron is open for addi
tional enlistments.
The squadron, which operates from the Oakland Airport, will accept

enlistment from all ex-Marines, who
retain their discharge rank, and all |
honorably discharged men of the
Army, Navy, and Coast Guard, who
will be given the rank equivalent to
that held at discharge.
Squadron activity at present in- '
eludes three monthly meetings, two |
nightly two-hour meetings, and one
week-end four-hour meeting.
The squadron has been designated
as VMF-141. one of the famous j
Marine Corsair Squadrons that op- 1
crated in the South Pacific during
the war. The squadron is at pres
ent fully complemented with pilots
but additional ground officers can
be joined.
Half the squadron personnel are
men attending Bay Area colleges
and universities, thus Stanford vet
erans may be interested in this or
ganization. Transportation to the
airport involves about one hour's

drive via the Dumbarton bridge and
with a group from Stanford already
participating it is felt transportation
costs can be kept at a minimum for
each man.
All interested men should contact
Grant Metzger, Business School or
Box 12137; Ken Bennett, Theta Xi
house; or Howard Rhode, A.T.O.
house.
