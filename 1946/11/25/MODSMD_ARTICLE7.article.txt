# Trial Near; Lewis Sits, Marks Time

### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 24 (UP).—
John L. Lewis was letting time run
out tonight with no move to call off
the four-day-old coal strike and
thus escape the consequences of
the biggest government crackdown
aimed at a labor union in recent
years.
Barring a last-minute move by
Lewis, he must be prepared to fight
when he goes to court when he goes
to court at 10 a.m. (EST) tomorrow
to defend himself against contempt
of court charges. In pushing con
tempt proceedings, the government
was brandishing the threat of a jail
sentence for Lewis and huge fines
for both him and the striking Uni
ted Mine Workers (AFL).

NEW YORK, Nov. 24 (UPU).—
Former Secretary of the Interior
Harold L. Ickes today urged that
the government request dismissal
of its injunction in the soft coal
strike tomorrow, asserting that the
court action had won a following
for United Mine Workers Chief
John L. Lewis which lie could not
win himself.

An authoritative source said
the government was ready to rec
ommend jail for Lewis and fines
of about $200,000 daily for him
ifnd the union if he should be
adjudged guilty of contempt.
Those recommendations were re
ported discussed with .President
Truman by his top advisers in an
80-minute conference at the White
House late yesterday, immediately
after the Chief Executive returned
from his Florida vacation.
The United Press informant
gave no indication of how $200, -
000 daily fines would he assessed
between the union and Lewis.
The UMW has a treasury bal
ance, as of last Ju'y 1, of about
$13,500,000, which would last 67
days if liquidated at $200,000 a day.
Lewis' salary is $25,000 a year
now, but the UMW convention last
month authorized the executive
board to raise it by an undeter
mined amount.
