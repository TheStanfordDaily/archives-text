# New Late Leave Plan Rewards Plus Grade, Restricts Girls Minus
## 
### 
A new proposed late leaves plan was introduced yesterday
to Women's Conference. Mary Ann Bardin, chairman of the
Social Regulations Committee, brought the plan before Con
ference and spoke on the basic policy of the proposed plan.
This policy includes the fundamental standard in that it ex-

presses the idea that as a l pro - *
presses academically she is progress- I
ing socially, and is able to handle |
increased privileges. These privi- |
loges will be given with the idea !
that the girls will be able to assume
increased responsibilities with them.
This is the main reason for making |
the changes.
The biggest changes in the plan
are in floaters for sophomores and
seniors. Under the new plan soph
omores will have ten 1:110 floaters
instead of five, and seniors with
a C average will have unlimited
1 ::>o's.

Another difference will be in late
leaves of women who are minus. A
distinction will be made between
those who are totally minus and
those who are minus for only one
quarter. The latter will revert one
class, and have late leaves given to
those in the class just below, while
the girls who are totally minus will
have leaves of a first-quarter fresh
man.
The new plan, if approved, will
go into effect next quarter and will
be on a trial basis until next fall.
Klcven topics for discussion on
Yocnm will be voted on by the
living groups tonight, and the six
having the largest number of
votes will be the main part of
Vocom's program this year.
