## 
### MEL HOFFMAN 
"We arc facing a better day for
education in California," stated Roy
W. Cloud, speaking to the meeting
of the California Student Teachers' |j
Association yesterday afternoon in j
the School of Education social room. !
Mr. Cloud, speaking on "Implica- j
lions of the November Voting on
Propositions for Education," dis- |
cussed the improved instruction and
teaching opportunities that will be
brought about by the passage of
proposition No. 3.
California leathers, he said, will
now receive at least $2,44)0 a year,
and state support of schools will
be increased to $120 annually per
pupil. Previously, teachers were
sometimes paid less than $1,800 a
year, and inost schools received
about $90 per pupil from the state.
"California has the highest aver
age salary for teachers in the Uni

ted States," said Mr. Cloud, "but it
is a miserably poor average. It is
my hope to make the salary sched
ule run from a minimum of $2,400
;;to a maximum of $4,000 annually for
! classroom teachers. If we can do
| that, we can get a fairly decent
I school system in California."
Of the Ki.OOft teachers in Cali
fornia. 12,300 have emergency cre
dentials, according to Mr. Cloud.
Any person can get a temporary
credential if lie has completed two
years at any college.
"The increased population in Cal
j ifornia means that many additional
] teachers are required," continued
■ Mr. Cloud. In the June graduation
at the University of California,
i however, only 15 oul of 2,000 stu
dents were going into teaching. The
increase in salaries will cause more
students to plan on entering the
i teaching profession in California."
