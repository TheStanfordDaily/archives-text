# Colleges Uncover Fraternity Machine
## 
### 
Existence of Thcta Nu Epsilon,
behind-the-scerfes political organi
zation, was uncovered on the Uni
versity of Oregon campus last week,
and denounced by the Daily Emer
ald as a proponent of fascism in
student affairs.
The society, whose members are
drawn from leaders in Greek-letter
social fraternities, is a secret na
tional organization seeking control
of student government, campus
newspapers, fraternity memberships,
and prom lists. It is reportedly sup
ported by alumni finances and has
as its purpose the defense and glo
rification of the Greek-letter sys
tem.
MEMBERSHIP CARD FOUND
A T.N.E. membership card was
found on the Oregon campus, prov
ing the long-suspected existence of
the organization as a dominating
force in student politics.
Student government at the Uni
versity of Southern California was
blasted wide open last year when

the T.N.E.-clominated student Sen
ate was disbanded by President von
KlcinSmid, and the student body
president and secretary were re
moved from office. Said Time mag
azine at this juncture, "Led by the
campus newspaper, Daily Trojan,
fraternity men howled their indig
nation. But non-fraternity men,
sick of T.N.E. domination, hailed
the president's action. Said one:
They ought to suspend every mem
ber'."
NON-FRAT VETS WARNED
S.C.'s battle was started when
T.N.E. members presumed to warn
fraternity-shunning veterans not to
seek campus office or promote their
own social society, Trovets. It end
ed last Nov. 14 when veterans were
granted representation on the 20-
man student Senate, but not until
a month-long battle had been fought
over the issue.
The Oregon Emerald, in its de
nunciation of T.N.E., quoted Hitler's
"'Mein Kampf": "The admiration for

every great deed must lie bathed in
pride at the fact that lie who hap
pily performed it was a member of
one's own people." It pointed to
the fact that in some fraternities and
sororities individual independence
and freedom of choice arc mini
mized and subordinated to the wel
fare and prestige of the organiza
tion. T.N.E.'s activities in fixing
student body elections in favor of
selected fraternity members were
branded as fascistic and undemo
cratic. as they prevented freedom of
balloting and upheld the political
power of a limited group of campus
citizens.
"The T.N.E, is dangerous," read
the editorial, "because the students
who arc playing this game of poli
tics are not children. The T.N.E.
members are men whose positions
of leadership on the campus will
enable them to enter political fields
of wider scope, and as their influ
ence grows, to alTect hundreds of
pcopl? with their undemocratic
doctrines."
