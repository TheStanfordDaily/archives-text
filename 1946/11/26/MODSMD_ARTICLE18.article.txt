PITTSBURGH, Nov. 25 (UP).
â€”The coal-starved steel indus
try today laid off thousands of
workers and planned to slash

| and open hearth furnaces wore
j banked.

Carnegie - Illinois Steel Corp.,
! the nation's greatest steelmaker,
| announced tonight that operations
in the Pittsburgh district would be
reduced tomorrow to .'l5 per cent
| of capacity, compared with 104 per
! cent the week before last. Seven
additional blast furnaces will l>e
j taken out of operation to make a
| total of 11 down and 10 still oper
ating.
| The National Tube Co. works at
: MeKeesport, Pa., will be cut to
j about 50 per cent tomorrow when
J two of four blast furnaces go down
i and a seamless pipe mill will be
I closed. Several thousand workers
I will be made idle on a part-time or

UNKM PI X>YM ENT
At Johnstown, Pa., Bethlehem
Steel Co. has laid off 8,000 of 14,000
I workers at its Cambria plant, and a
further layoff of 3,000 workers was
expected soon.
Jones & I-uigblln Steel Corp.
announced a slash of .'JO per cent
in ingot production at its Pitts-
I burgh and Aliquippa, Pa., mills.
Some 1.100 of the company's 10,-
I 000 were furloughed.
Other steel producers would make.'
j no estimate of how many workers
j had been laid off, but it was appar
j ent. that many thousands were idle,
j and thousands more were working
on reduced schedules.

John L. Lewis and his United
j Mine Workers were ordered to
| trial tomorrow for contempt in
! the soft coal strike by Federal
| Judge T. Alan Goldsborough.
The outcome of the trial will
decide whether any labor leader
can successfully buck the national
government, and both sides have
I treated the ease as such.
CONTEMPT CITED
Assistant U. S. Attorney General
John F. Sonnett submitted a brief
stating that Lewis and his United
Mine Workers (AFL) are in con
| tempt because they refused to obey
a temporary injunction issued by
Goldsborough a week ago forbid
| ding the strike.
UMW Attorney Welly K. Hopkin:;,
I dapper, soft-spoken Texan, agreed
i that the order had been ignored
But he said Goldsborough had had
no right to issue it and Lewis was
| entirely within his rights in termi
| nating the union's wage contract
with the government as of midnight
last Wednesday.
"Wp are prepared to argue this
Nov. 27," he said.
His client then was ordered to
return to the Federal District
; Court at Ift a.m., EST, tomorrow
for a formal trial in which Golds
i borough will be empowered to
impose any punishment he sees
fit if be finds I-ewis and the UMW
guilty of contempt.
RhlPOui FINE ASKED
There was increasing belief that
the government would not press for
I a jail sentence for Lewis, and his
UMW aides but would ask Golds
borough to hand out stiff fines in
the hope that the union leaders
; might call off the strike rather than
I risk depleting the union treasury,
j Hopkins made one attempt to win
! a postponement of tho contempt
j trial, and he was overruled quickly
on Sonnet t's objection that each
i day's delay was causing the coun
i try "irreparable damage." Judge
| Goldsborough said both the con
tempt charges and a government
petition to make his temporary an
jti - strike injunction permanent
! would be held on schedule tomor
j row, with the contempt issue taking
i precedent.
