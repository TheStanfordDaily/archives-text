After many years of feminine
hullaballoo, and several weeks of
work by a committee to change
social regulations, Stanford wom
en have a victorious plan before
tliem. If approved, as of winter
quarter, increased 1:30 late leaves
will be granted on trial to sopho
more, junior, and senior women;
and a woman who went minus one
quarter for the sake of the boy
friend will not be locked in with
first-quarter freshmen but will
receive the privileges accorded to
women one class below her.
It's a step in the right direction
—as wc women grow older intel
lectually and scholastically, we
are given the benefit of increas
ing trust to conduct our social and
academic lives with wisdom. No
longer will we have to plot our
parties four and five weeks ahead
of time, to allocate our floaters to
the best possible use, but will feel
relatively free to make midweek
dates and know we "have the
leave."
With the increase in leaves
comes an increase in individual
responsibility — not only will
women who violate their respon
sibility lose their own leaves, but
will endanger the whole system
which is set up on a trial basis.
Who knows, if we're successful,
we may someday have nerve to
ask for two-thirties.
