LAKE SUCCESS. N.Y., Nov. 25
(UP). â€” United Nations delegates
from India and the Union of South
Africa clashed in bitter personal
acrimony today at a committee
hearing on charges of raci-l dis
crimination in South Africa.
India, primarily through Mrs. Vi
jayalakshmi Pandit, has demanded
that the U.N. intervene in South
Africa's treatment of South Afri
can citizens of Indian descent. She
charges gross racial discrimination
in violation of the U.N. charter.
