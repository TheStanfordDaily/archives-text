The Civilian Production Adminis

offices for vigorous enforcement, of
the coal-saving "brown out" effec

states and the District of Columbia.
Edward Falek, director of the
Office of Emergency Control, which
was re-established at CPA for tho
coal crisis, warned that "severe
sanctions" will be imposed on via-,
lators, including discontinuance of
electric services to willful offender .
The dim-out order calls for elim
ination of practically all exterior
lighting in commercial, industrial,
governmental, and other non-resi
dential establishments and an over
all cut of 25 per cent in int rior
lighting.
Falek telephoned all CPA regional
compliance directors and ordered
special investigators into the field
to check up on observance of the
order. He also wrote utility com
panies requesting their assistance.
