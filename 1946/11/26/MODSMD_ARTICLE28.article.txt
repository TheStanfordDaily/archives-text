## 'Driving'—Without Accidents 
### 
Why did the Four Feathers Drive fail, or
did it fail? It is true that the $14,000 goal was
not reached, but the committee did not ex
pect to collect that much money. That par
ticular goal was set by multiplying the $2
quota por student by Stanford's 7,000 students.
It is unlikely that every student would con
tribute S2.
But the quota was not too high- last year
lli'- minimum for every student was $4. A $2
quola was set this year because the committee
kml >od that charity drives everywhere were
ilot going over very well and it did not want
lo work a hardship on the number of veterans
who are living on a limited allowance. But
evon with the quota cut in half, the drive fell
down greatly.
There are two reasons for this failure—the
lack of individual care and responsibility, and
-t I ck of organization by the committee for the
drive. A drive committee should realize that
Stanford students, sad as it may be, do not
give for the sake of giving. They'll buy straw
berry shortcake at the Strawberry Brunch or
qo out to the Con Home and work on Labor
Day, but only because it is "the thing to do."
Therefore a committee should use an appeal
that will make contributing "the thing to do."
And in the future, drives can and should be
better organized. Here's what the committee
slipped up on in the Four Feathers drive:
1. The receipt cards were not printed in
time. Ordinarily drive collectors meet a week
ah J of time to discuss the drive and pick up
the cards, but since there were no cards until
the beginning of the drive, the committee did
not feel it should ask them to attend an extra
meeting.
2. Therefore collectors, one from each liv
ing group, slipped up on their jobs. In most
cases they did not contact the members of
their living group and explain the purpose of
the drive. They just emphasized that every
one was to pay $2 for a drive. So in very few
cases was more than the $2 minimum collect
ed. In some houses there was no attempt at

collection at all. Students were told they
could turn their money in to "so-and-so" if
they wanted to.
3. The drive had little publicity. There
were few posters put up, and no public speak
ing at rallies, assemblies, or house meetings.
The committee planned to collect at a rally
which was called off and at the Sunday movie,
but those plans fell through. Janet Ossman,
committee head, admitted that a dance or
some similar function should have been held.
An auction such as we had for war bond
drives would have been impractical, she said.
Buying war bonds was more appealing as it
was an investment, not a charity, and there
are few scarce things to auction off any more,
she said. But if scarce things are necessary
what about Kleenex, soap flakes, or a bottle
of milk?
4. About 2500 students live off campus,
causing a collection problem we didn't have
last year. They were sent donation cards by
mail, but most of them were ignored. An
auction, posters, or a dance would have
helped in off-campus collections. But most
important the booths were not kept open as
they should have been. When they were
open, large amounts were collected from
these students, but much of the time the booth
runners, freshman girls, just didn't show up
on time. They evidently didn't think it was
important.
In planning a drive, the chairman goes
over the report from the last drive, a report
which does not discuss all the little details
and problems that come up, solving of which
largely determines the success or failure of
the drive. Stanford has had drives for so
many years that it should be possible to work
out a rule of procedure guide for future chair
men. The guide should include all small de
tails that must be taken care of in any drive
and a time for beginning them. It should be
complete, discussing all problems that are
even likely to corne up, should be supple
mented after each drive, and should be re
quired reading for every chairman.—N.B.

helped in off-campus collections. But most
important the booths were not kept open as
they should have been. When they were
open, large amounts were collected from
these students, but much of the time the booth
runners, freshman girls, just didn't show up
on time. They evidently didn't think it was
important.
In planning a drive, the chairman goes
over the report from the last drive, a report
which does not discuss all the little details
and problems that come up, solving of which
largely determines the success or failure of
the drive. Stanford has had drives for so
many years that it should be possible to work
out a rule of procedure guide for future chair
men. The guide should include all small de
tails that must be taken care of in any drive
and a time for beginning them. It should be
complete, discussing all problems that are
even likely to corne up, should be supple
mented after each drive, and should be re
quired reading for every chairman.—N.B.
Why did the Four Feathers Drive fail, or
did it fail? It is true that the $14,000 goal was
not reached, but the committee did not ex
pect to collect that much money. That par
ticular goal was set by multiplying the $2
quota por student by Stanford's 7,000 students.
It is unlikely that every student would con
tribute S2.
But the quota was not too high- last year
lli'- minimum for every student was $4. A $2
quola was set this year because the committee
kml >od that charity drives everywhere were
ilot going over very well and it did not want
lo work a hardship on the number of veterans
who are living on a limited allowance. But
evon with the quota cut in half, the drive fell
down greatly.
There are two reasons for this failure—the
lack of individual care and responsibility, and
-t I ck of organization by the committee for the
drive. A drive committee should realize that
Stanford students, sad as it may be, do not
give for the sake of giving. They'll buy straw
berry shortcake at the Strawberry Brunch or
qo out to the Con Home and work on Labor
Day, but only because it is "the thing to do."
Therefore a committee should use an appeal
that will make contributing "the thing to do."
And in the future, drives can and should be
better organized. Here's what the committee
slipped up on in the Four Feathers drive:
1. The receipt cards were not printed in
time. Ordinarily drive collectors meet a week
ah J of time to discuss the drive and pick up
the cards, but since there were no cards until
the beginning of the drive, the committee did
not feel it should ask them to attend an extra
meeting.
2. Therefore collectors, one from each liv
ing group, slipped up on their jobs. In most
cases they did not contact the members of
their living group and explain the purpose of
the drive. They just emphasized that every
one was to pay $2 for a drive. So in very few
cases was more than the $2 minimum collect
ed. In some houses there was no attempt at

collection at all. Students were told they
could turn their money in to "so-and-so" if
they wanted to.
3. The drive had little publicity. There
were few posters put up, and no public speak
ing at rallies, assemblies, or house meetings.
The committee planned to collect at a rally
which was called off and at the Sunday movie,
but those plans fell through. Janet Ossman,
committee head, admitted that a dance or
some similar function should have been held.
An auction such as we had for war bond
drives would have been impractical, she said.
Buying war bonds was more appealing as it
was an investment, not a charity, and there
are few scarce things to auction off any more,
she said. But if scarce things are necessary
what about Kleenex, soap flakes, or a bottle
of milk?
4. About 2500 students live off campus,
causing a collection problem we didn't have
last year. They were sent donation cards by
mail, but most of them were ignored. An
auction, posters, or a dance would have
helped in off-campus collections. But most
important the booths were not kept open as
they should have been. When they were
open, large amounts were collected from
these students, but much of the time the booth
