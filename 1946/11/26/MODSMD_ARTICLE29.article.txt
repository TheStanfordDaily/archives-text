## BULL SESSION 
### 
People are beginning to look a little less like walk
in:' vhouls now after the terrilic weekend and the
iJi '4 Game of is taking its place alongside the
memories of 48 other Big Games.
But there are a few footnotes to add before closing
ihe book. There are all the little reports that keep
trickling in about "Didja hear what happened Sat
urday night?" and the small flurry over the disap
pearance of the Axe after the game. Funny how un
important the incident seemed in comparison to the
frantic excitement it would have aroused if the Axe
had ben misplaced before the game.
'I here's the campus character who returned to
the parage where he had parked his car during
Saturday night's celebrating and found the garage
locked. He climbed in through a small window and
located his car among several hundred others but in
his slightly befuddled condition couldn't figure out
how to work the air pressure equipment that opened
(he doors. So he climbed back out the window and
took a train down to campus.
There's the picture in Sunday morning's Chron
icle. supposedly ot California's rooting section, but
containing a bevy of Stanford beauties.
There Ye all the celebrations Saturday night in
Ihe City's spots, with happy Indians chanting
Who's got the Axe?" and "Poor Cal" while the
nioro; e Briar supporters had little to say.
There's the laugh at one party when two' vets
•piling out dirty words in Morse code on the tin
horns the management provided got an awfully nasty
look from one of the girls. Turned out she too had

been in the service :»n<l know code. The lads' faces
were almost as red as those of campus bigwigs who
didn't know where the Axe was when they should
have.
And there's the beauty of the return to campus
late Sunday with the sun setting behind the purple
hills and the chapel glowing in the waning sunlight—
and "AUTEN'S' spelt out in the sky above it!

One of Stanford's better known profs was stand
ing in front of Encina the other day reading a copy
of life while waiting for the bus. Running across
a picture of a scantily dressed young lovely, he
paused to admire it.
Two grad students whom he knew happened to
pass by and he called them over to enjoy the bit of
art. As they were gazing admiringly upon the print
ed page, the local police car cruised by, paused, con
tinued on its way, and then turned to cftine back.
At this point, the bus arrived, the prof climbed
on. and the two grad students walked off. They were
soon stopped by the gendarme in the squad car.
"Who v/as that little guy?" he asked them.
"There's been a fellow selling dirty pictures on cam
pus, lately that we're trying to catch."
The two grads assured the cop that the man in
question was a high-ranking Farm professor and
above suspicion.
The payoff came later when the professor, in
formed of the incident, added the classic comment:
"Well, a professor at Stanford has to make a living
some way."
