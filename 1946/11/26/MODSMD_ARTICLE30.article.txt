To lli.s Most Glorious Debased, Satan. Ruler of All
Hells:
Your latest communique was hilarious. We Jun
ior Devils spent a riotous evening of laughter over
your detailed accounts of how the fascist seeds were
s lowing in America . . . so, despite the fall of Hitler
and llirohilo fascism i.s not dead, and we can still
destroy all nobility in mankind and trap the human
brutes! What a joke!
But we'll save our most raucous enjoyments for
the final triumph. In the meantime Stanford will play
its role in the ruin of humanity. We aren't able to
us" the students as terrorists . . . yet. They're too
civilized and intelligent. But we are keeping them
from interfering with our destructions elsewhere,
and we will maneuver them into unwitting accept
ance of our plans.
Most Corrupted Satan, these are our policies;
We keep Stanford wrapped up in itself. Our
"All outside is a myth except S.F7' campaign has
succeeded so well that few think about how others
live. Also, we provide an engrossing attraction on
campus for restless minds . . . Row against Hall,
house against house, etc. The worm quarrels with
the centipede and the raven eats them both.
We discourage the students from thinking, for of
course thought i.s beyond our powers. So flirting,
football, bigger and better playing—that's the thing
to do, and of course everyone is doing the thing to
do. Talking about politics and world affairs is poor
taste. There are a misguided few who insist on get

ting an education, .so we let them cram. But never
think!
We are also having jolly fun messing up the
American Dieam. It doesn't mean equality of races
and creeds, or civil liberties for the poor and perse
cuted as well as the wealthy, or a conscientious citi
zenry. No; these ideas are dangerous. Instead, Un-
American Dream means gracious, gay, unconcerned
living, with a minimum of controls.
Hell, boss, Most Debased, we have Stanford sewed
up. But there i.s one problem. Many students seem
to have strange notions about the dignity of man,
and sometimes feel disturbed by the course of world
events. They are a nuisance—what if they should talk
things over, or worse, act in groups to educate others
and put pressure on American leaders to govern for
the welfare of all? We aren't sure we can fool these
students. They may know that in a changing world
a society must evolve to remain harmonious, and of
course we want to keep American institutions static
and dead so all the social tensions can come out at
once in a delightful catastrophic explosion. Great
Satan, you know how people who foresee explo
sions cause us trouble. But we will handle them;
first, we'll make them think they are vastly out
numbered and they'll be scared to open their mouths,
and second, we'll keep them lazy until it's too late.
That's the news to date; we are doing excellently.
Now may we have some plutonium to play with?
Avariciously yours,
The Leland Stanford Junior Devils
