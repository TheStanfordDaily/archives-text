If \ oii'it Sick of Hearing About
The Rose Bowl, Don't Head I his

The first part of this eolyum will be about tha infamous Rose Bowl
deal—again—so if you're fed up on the whole disgusting business and
care to hear no more about it, turn over to page 2 and feast your eyes
on Coughlin's pornographic patter. It'.s good; even I read it, as a matter
of fact. Or better yet, you could study. If you take the time to read the
sports page, you're no Phi Beta Kappa.
The point I want to make is this—the only excuse for the existence
(»!' college football is the fact that it is a student activity; of, by. and for
the students. If it isn't, it should be. If it isn't run on an amateur basis,
or is controlled rigidly from above without regard for student wishes,
it would !>c best to disband and let the professionals take over.
And what did the students have to say about this deal? Nothing, be
cause they weren't even asked. If they had been, I'm sure they would
never have placed themselves in the position of a ne'er-do-well accepting
favors from a solid, supercilious, overbearing neighbor.
That's what it boils down to. For 22 years tin* Big Nine passes itself
oil' as too pure to involve itself in commercialized bowl games. Then it
suddenly decides to take over, and delivers an ultimatum to that eflect—
either the Coast Conference accepts immediately, or they can wait an
other 22 years. Of course the obvious play was for the Coast fathers
to till them they could go to hell in a bucket—but they missed their cue.
"Coast Sold Rose Howl Birthright"
Comment all over the country has been bad. Paul Zimmerman of the
L.A. Times says,"The Pacific Coast Conference sold the Rose Bowl birth
right for a bundle of high-sounding phrases about athletic responsibility."

Ned Cronin of the L.A. News says,
"This whole Rose Bowl arrangement
places the Pacific Coast Conference
in the position of being dictated to
by the Big Nine. The Pacific Coast
Conference has always been able to
stand on its own feet before with
out the Big Nine governing its poli
cies and administration. And how
can they sit there with straight faces
in Berkeley and say Army was elim
inated because it proselyted play
ers?"
The Los Angeles examples have
been used because that's where
feeling was highest. It's a South
land team that must go into the
Bowl New Year's Day with noth
ing to win and everything to lose.
If Westwood beats Illinois, the
cardboard Big Nine champ, ev
eryone says, 'So what?"—but if
they lose they're a bunch of bums.
What a situation.
Throughout the rest of the coun
try the comment has not been ex
actly favorable, but now that the
first furore is over the Easterners

are lapsing into indifference. Yes
terday there was a dispatch over the United Press Sports Wire—emanating
from New York—which was a round-up on the various bowls. They dis
posed of the Rose Bowl with a minimum of comment—"The Rose Bowl,
of course, has sold itself down the river." Nothing else—but most signifi
cant were all the things they could have said, and didn't. In other words,
the national indifference predicted from this corner has already arrived.
It's a dirty shame.
I wonder if the Coast moguls bothered to think through on all the
possible consequences. For instance, Illinois is the Big Nine titiist this
year. If they win again they can't make another trip west next year;
the second-placer will come. Then if both those teams repeat in their
league the third year, the THIRD-place team will come. That's how the
agreement reads, my friends. Its enough to make you hight without a
drive-in.
Is li True What They Say About Cal?
Nearly every sports writer on the Coast went overboard on the alleged
defensive qualities of the California line. How anyone can call them a
defensive team when they've had an average of three touchdowns scored
against them in each game i.s beyond me, but that's neither here nor there,
now that the season's over. What gripes me is the fact that the Stanford
line stalwarts haven't received the recognition due them. They go in there
and push the vaunted Bears around all afternoon, and the guessperts at
tribute it all to Cal's below-average performance. How could Cal get
below its average for this year? •
From end to end the Palo Altos were the masters of the Berkeleys;
at no point were they outplayed. Dave DeSwarte and Bob Hall played
their best game of the season at end. Fred Boensch turned in a per
formance that at least equaled what he did against the Trojans.
Charlie Wakefield was blocking all over the field on offense, and his
kicking was as good as ever. Dick Madigan used his 170 pounds like it
was 270. Dick Flatland played his best game, and called defensive forma
tions well to boot. Bill Hachten looked like the best guard in the Con
ference. And their replacements did all right, too. Believe me, this isn't
just a praise job to make someone feel good; all hands played a wonderful
game.

And don't think I'm going to leave out Jim Cox. Although out for
nearly two months, and still limping, the Fireball came back and played
as good a bit of tackle as you're likely to see for many Big; Games to
conic. Just his presence on the field was worth points to the Cards, but
he really held up his end. Maybe next year Marchic should take all his
linemen out and break their legs.
Of course everyone knows how good the backs were, because they're
more spectacular. They already have plenty of press clippings from the
past week-end. After Merriman and Quist were injured, the other boys
really made up for their loss—Erickson, Titus, Martin, both Andersons—
and there were more.
Kroni Wonder Team to Blunder ream
As usual, Jack McDonald of the Call-Bulletin turned out to be the
sharpest observer. After commenting on the other writers and how they
played up Cal's poor game rather than Stanford's good one. he adds:

"Had the Bears played good
football Saturday this, indeed,
would have been 'news,' the kind
worthy, we'd say. of reporting in
stud-horse type. But since all
they did was play some more had
football this space is not featur
ing the fact at all.''
Cal's poor football is hard to fig
ure. They have plenty of good ma
terial over there, but seldom come
up with a winner—no matter who
the coach is. This year was no ex
ception; the Bears had several play
ers who would have been welcomed
anywhere on the Coast.
I can think of only one possible
answer; the Bears have too much
tradition behind them. There was
Andy Smith's Wonder Team, and
Stub Allison's Thunder Team—
and the logical outcome is Wick
horst's Blunder Team. All their
winners have featured power and
nothing else. Times have changed;
a dip of the wrist can score a
touchdown in seconds, but the
Bears still score their points the
hard way. Naturally they lose.

cant were all the things they could have said, and didn't. In other words,
the national indifference predicted from this corner has already arrived.
It's a dirty shame.
I wonder if the Coast moguls bothered to think through on all the
possible consequences. For instance, Illinois is the Big Nine titiist this
year. If they win again they can't make another trip west next year;
the second-placer will come. Then if both those teams repeat in their
league the third year, the THIRD-place team will come. That's how the
agreement reads, my friends. Its enough to make you hight without a
drive-in.
Is li True What They Say About Cal?
Nearly every sports writer on the Coast went overboard on the alleged
defensive qualities of the California line. How anyone can call them a
defensive team when they've had an average of three touchdowns scored
against them in each game i.s beyond me, but that's neither here nor there,
now that the season's over. What gripes me is the fact that the Stanford
line stalwarts haven't received the recognition due them. They go in there
and push the vaunted Bears around all afternoon, and the guessperts at
tribute it all to Cal's below-average performance. How could Cal get
below its average for this year? •
From end to end the Palo Altos were the masters of the Berkeleys;
at no point were they outplayed. Dave DeSwarte and Bob Hall played
their best game of the season at end. Fred Boensch turned in a per
formance that at least equaled what he did against the Trojans.
Charlie Wakefield was blocking all over the field on offense, and his
kicking was as good as ever. Dick Madigan used his 170 pounds like it
was 270. Dick Flatland played his best game, and called defensive forma
tions well to boot. Bill Hachten looked like the best guard in the Con
ference. And their replacements did all right, too. Believe me, this isn't
just a praise job to make someone feel good; all hands played a wonderful
game.

And don't think I'm going to leave out Jim Cox. Although out for
nearly two months, and still limping, the Fireball came back and played
as good a bit of tackle as you're likely to see for many Big; Games to
conic. Just his presence on the field was worth points to the Cards, but
he really held up his end. Maybe next year Marchic should take all his
linemen out and break their legs.
Of course everyone knows how good the backs were, because they're
more spectacular. They already have plenty of press clippings from the
past week-end. After Merriman and Quist were injured, the other boys
really made up for their loss—Erickson, Titus, Martin, both Andersons—
and there were more.
Kroni Wonder Team to Blunder ream
As usual, Jack McDonald of the Call-Bulletin turned out to be the
sharpest observer. After commenting on the other writers and how they
played up Cal's poor game rather than Stanford's good one. he adds:

"Had the Bears played good
football Saturday this, indeed,
would have been 'news,' the kind
worthy, we'd say. of reporting in
stud-horse type. But since all
they did was play some more had
football this space is not featur
ing the fact at all.''
Cal's poor football is hard to fig
ure. They have plenty of good ma
terial over there, but seldom come
up with a winner—no matter who
the coach is. This year was no ex
ception; the Bears had several play
ers who would have been welcomed
anywhere on the Coast.
I can think of only one possible
answer; the Bears have too much
tradition behind them. There was
Andy Smith's Wonder Team, and
Stub Allison's Thunder Team—
and the logical outcome is Wick
horst's Blunder Team. All their
winners have featured power and
nothing else. Times have changed;
a dip of the wrist can score a
touchdown in seconds, but the
Bears still score their points the
hard way. Naturally they lose.

The Polar Bear's Okay
If \ oii'it Sick of Hearing About
The Rose Bowl, Don't Head I his

The first part of this eolyum will be about tha infamous Rose Bowl
deal—again—so if you're fed up on the whole disgusting business and
care to hear no more about it, turn over to page 2 and feast your eyes
on Coughlin's pornographic patter. It'.s good; even I read it, as a matter
of fact. Or better yet, you could study. If you take the time to read the
sports page, you're no Phi Beta Kappa.
The point I want to make is this—the only excuse for the existence
(»!' college football is the fact that it is a student activity; of, by. and for
the students. If it isn't, it should be. If it isn't run on an amateur basis,
or is controlled rigidly from above without regard for student wishes,
it would !>c best to disband and let the professionals take over.
And what did the students have to say about this deal? Nothing, be
cause they weren't even asked. If they had been, I'm sure they would
never have placed themselves in the position of a ne'er-do-well accepting
favors from a solid, supercilious, overbearing neighbor.
That's what it boils down to. For 22 years tin* Big Nine passes itself
oil' as too pure to involve itself in commercialized bowl games. Then it
suddenly decides to take over, and delivers an ultimatum to that eflect—
either the Coast Conference accepts immediately, or they can wait an
other 22 years. Of course the obvious play was for the Coast fathers
to till them they could go to hell in a bucket—but they missed their cue.
"Coast Sold Rose Howl Birthright"
Comment all over the country has been bad. Paul Zimmerman of the
L.A. Times says,"The Pacific Coast Conference sold the Rose Bowl birth
right for a bundle of high-sounding phrases about athletic responsibility."

Ned Cronin of the L.A. News says,
"This whole Rose Bowl arrangement
places the Pacific Coast Conference
in the position of being dictated to
by the Big Nine. The Pacific Coast
Conference has always been able to
stand on its own feet before with
out the Big Nine governing its poli
cies and administration. And how
can they sit there with straight faces
in Berkeley and say Army was elim
inated because it proselyted play
ers?"
The Los Angeles examples have
been used because that's where
feeling was highest. It's a South
land team that must go into the
Bowl New Year's Day with noth
ing to win and everything to lose.
If Westwood beats Illinois, the
cardboard Big Nine champ, ev
eryone says, 'So what?"—but if
they lose they're a bunch of bums.
What a situation.
Throughout the rest of the coun
try the comment has not been ex
actly favorable, but now that the
first furore is over the Easterners

are lapsing into indifference. Yes
terday there was a dispatch over the United Press Sports Wire—emanating
from New York—which was a round-up on the various bowls. They dis

football this space is not featur

Cal's poor football is hard to fig
ure. They have plenty of good ma
terial over there, but seldom come
up with a winner—no matter who
the coach is. This year was no ex
ception; the Bears had several play
ers who would have been welcomed
anywhere on the Coast.
I can think of only one possible
answer; the Bears have too much
tradition behind them. There was
Andy Smith's Wonder Team, and
Stub Allison's Thunder Team—

winners have featured power and

a dip of the wrist can score a
touchdown in seconds, but the
Bears still score their points the
hard way. Naturally they lose.


GEORGE QIIIST
The Polar Bear's Okay
If \ oii'it Sick of Hearing About
The Rose Bowl, Don't Head I his

The first part of this eolyum will be about tha infamous Rose Bowl
deal—again—so if you're fed up on the whole disgusting business and
care to hear no more about it, turn over to page 2 and feast your eyes
on Coughlin's pornographic patter. It'.s good; even I read it, as a matter
of fact. Or better yet, you could study. If you take the time to read the
sports page, you're no Phi Beta Kappa.
The point I want to make is this—the only excuse for the existence
(»!' college football is the fact that it is a student activity; of, by. and for
the students. If it isn't, it should be. If it isn't run on an amateur basis,
or is controlled rigidly from above without regard for student wishes,
it would !>c best to disband and let the professionals take over.
And what did the students have to say about this deal? Nothing, be
cause they weren't even asked. If they had been, I'm sure they would
never have placed themselves in the position of a ne'er-do-well accepting
favors from a solid, supercilious, overbearing neighbor.
That's what it boils down to. For 22 years tin* Big Nine passes itself
oil' as too pure to involve itself in commercialized bowl games. Then it
suddenly decides to take over, and delivers an ultimatum to that eflect—
either the Coast Conference accepts immediately, or they can wait an
other 22 years. Of course the obvious play was for the Coast fathers
to till them they could go to hell in a bucket—but they missed their cue.
"Coast Sold Rose Howl Birthright"
Comment all over the country has been bad. Paul Zimmerman of the
L.A. Times says,"The Pacific Coast Conference sold the Rose Bowl birth
right for a bundle of high-sounding phrases about athletic responsibility."

Ned Cronin of the L.A. News says,
"This whole Rose Bowl arrangement
places the Pacific Coast Conference
in the position of being dictated to
by the Big Nine. The Pacific Coast
Conference has always been able to
stand on its own feet before with
out the Big Nine governing its poli
cies and administration. And how
can they sit there with straight faces
in Berkeley and say Army was elim
inated because it proselyted play
ers?"
The Los Angeles examples have
been used because that's where
feeling was highest. It's a South
land team that must go into the
Bowl New Year's Day with noth
ing to win and everything to lose.
If Westwood beats Illinois, the
cardboard Big Nine champ, ev
eryone says, 'So what?"—but if
they lose they're a bunch of bums.
What a situation.
Throughout the rest of the coun
try the comment has not been ex
actly favorable, but now that the
first furore is over the Easterners

are lapsing into indifference. Yes
terday there was a dispatch over the United Press Sports Wire—emanating
from New York—which was a round-up on the various bowls. They dis
posed of the Rose Bowl with a minimum of comment—"The Rose Bowl,
of course, has sold itself down the river." Nothing else—but most signifi
cant were all the things they could have said, and didn't. In other words,
the national indifference predicted from this corner has already arrived.
It's a dirty shame.
I wonder if the Coast moguls bothered to think through on all the
possible consequences. For instance, Illinois is the Big Nine titiist this
year. If they win again they can't make another trip west next year;
the second-placer will come. Then if both those teams repeat in their
league the third year, the THIRD-place team will come. That's how the
agreement reads, my friends. Its enough to make you hight without a
drive-in.
Is li True What They Say About Cal?
Nearly every sports writer on the Coast went overboard on the alleged
defensive qualities of the California line. How anyone can call them a
defensive team when they've had an average of three touchdowns scored
against them in each game i.s beyond me, but that's neither here nor there,
now that the season's over. What gripes me is the fact that the Stanford
line stalwarts haven't received the recognition due them. They go in there
and push the vaunted Bears around all afternoon, and the guessperts at
tribute it all to Cal's below-average performance. How could Cal get
below its average for this year? •
From end to end the Palo Altos were the masters of the Berkeleys;
at no point were they outplayed. Dave DeSwarte and Bob Hall played
their best game of the season at end. Fred Boensch turned in a per
formance that at least equaled what he did against the Trojans.
Charlie Wakefield was blocking all over the field on offense, and his
kicking was as good as ever. Dick Madigan used his 170 pounds like it
was 270. Dick Flatland played his best game, and called defensive forma
tions well to boot. Bill Hachten looked like the best guard in the Con
ference. And their replacements did all right, too. Believe me, this isn't
just a praise job to make someone feel good; all hands played a wonderful
game.

And don't think I'm going to leave out Jim Cox. Although out for
nearly two months, and still limping, the Fireball came back and played
as good a bit of tackle as you're likely to see for many Big; Games to
conic. Just his presence on the field was worth points to the Cards, but
he really held up his end. Maybe next year Marchic should take all his
linemen out and break their legs.
Of course everyone knows how good the backs were, because they're
more spectacular. They already have plenty of press clippings from the
past week-end. After Merriman and Quist were injured, the other boys
really made up for their loss—Erickson, Titus, Martin, both Andersons—
and there were more.
Kroni Wonder Team to Blunder ream
As usual, Jack McDonald of the Call-Bulletin turned out to be the
sharpest observer. After commenting on the other writers and how they
played up Cal's poor game rather than Stanford's good one. he adds:

"Had the Bears played good
football Saturday this, indeed,
would have been 'news,' the kind
worthy, we'd say. of reporting in
stud-horse type. But since all
they did was play some more had
football this space is not featur

been used because that's where
feeling was highest. It's a South
land team that must go into the
Bowl New Year's Day with noth
ing to win and everything to lose.
If Westwood beats Illinois, the
cardboard Big Nine champ, ev
eryone says, 'So what?"—but if
they lose they're a bunch of bums.
What a situation.
Throughout the rest of the coun
try the comment has not been ex
actly favorable, but now that the
first furore is over the Easterners

are lapsing into indifference. Yes
terday there was a dispatch over the United Press Sports Wire—emanating
from New York—which was a round-up on the various bowls. They dis
posed of the Rose Bowl with a minimum of comment—"The Rose Bowl,
of course, has sold itself down the river." Nothing else—but most signifi
cant were all the things they could have said, and didn't. In other words,
the national indifference predicted from this corner has already arrived.
It's a dirty shame.
I wonder if the Coast moguls bothered to think through on all the
possible consequences. For instance, Illinois is the Big Nine titiist this
year. If they win again they can't make another trip west next year;
the second-placer will come. Then if both those teams repeat in their
league the third year, the THIRD-place team will come. That's how the
agreement reads, my friends. Its enough to make you hight without a
drive-in.
Is li True What They Say About Cal?
Nearly every sports writer on the Coast went overboard on the alleged
defensive qualities of the California line. How anyone can call them a
defensive team when they've had an average of three touchdowns scored
against them in each game i.s beyond me, but that's neither here nor there,
now that the season's over. What gripes me is the fact that the Stanford
line stalwarts haven't received the recognition due them. They go in there
and push the vaunted Bears around all afternoon, and the guessperts at
tribute it all to Cal's below-average performance. How could Cal get
below its average for this year? •
From end to end the Palo Altos were the masters of the Berkeleys;
at no point were they outplayed. Dave DeSwarte and Bob Hall played
their best game of the season at end. Fred Boensch turned in a per
formance that at least equaled what he did against the Trojans.
Charlie Wakefield was blocking all over the field on offense, and his
kicking was as good as ever. Dick Madigan used his 170 pounds like it
was 270. Dick Flatland played his best game, and called defensive forma
tions well to boot. Bill Hachten looked like the best guard in the Con
ference. And their replacements did all right, too. Believe me, this isn't
just a praise job to make someone feel good; all hands played a wonderful
game.

And don't think I'm going to leave out Jim Cox. Although out for
nearly two months, and still limping, the Fireball came back and played
as good a bit of tackle as you're likely to see for many Big; Games to
conic. Just his presence on the field was worth points to the Cards, but
he really held up his end. Maybe next year Marchic should take all his
linemen out and break their legs.
Of course everyone knows how good the backs were, because they're
more spectacular. They already have plenty of press clippings from the
past week-end. After Merriman and Quist were injured, the other boys
really made up for their loss—Erickson, Titus, Martin, both Andersons—
and there were more.
Kroni Wonder Team to Blunder ream
As usual, Jack McDonald of the Call-Bulletin turned out to be the
sharpest observer. After commenting on the other writers and how they
played up Cal's poor game rather than Stanford's good one. he adds:

"Had the Bears played good
football Saturday this, indeed,
would have been 'news,' the kind
worthy, we'd say. of reporting in
stud-horse type. But since all
they did was play some more had
football this space is not featur
ing the fact at all.''
Cal's poor football is hard to fig
ure. They have plenty of good ma
terial over there, but seldom come
up with a winner—no matter who
the coach is. This year was no ex
ception; the Bears had several play
ers who would have been welcomed
anywhere on the Coast.
I can think of only one possible
answer; the Bears have too much
tradition behind them. There was
Andy Smith's Wonder Team, and
Stub Allison's Thunder Team—
and the logical outcome is Wick
horst's Blunder Team. All their
winners have featured power and
nothing else. Times have changed;
a dip of the wrist can score a
touchdown in seconds, but the
Bears still score their points the
hard way. Naturally they lose.

If \ oii'it Sick of Hearing About
The Rose Bowl, Don't Head I his

The first part of this eolyum will be about tha infamous Rose Bowl
deal—again—so if you're fed up on the whole disgusting business and
care to hear no more about it, turn over to page 2 and feast your eyes
on Coughlin's pornographic patter. It'.s good; even I read it, as a matter
of fact. Or better yet, you could study. If you take the time to read the
sports page, you're no Phi Beta Kappa.
The point I want to make is this—the only excuse for the existence
(»!' college football is the fact that it is a student activity; of, by. and for
the students. If it isn't, it should be. If it isn't run on an amateur basis,
or is controlled rigidly from above without regard for student wishes,
it would !>c best to disband and let the professionals take over.
And what did the students have to say about this deal? Nothing, be
cause they weren't even asked. If they had been, I'm sure they would
never have placed themselves in the position of a ne'er-do-well accepting
favors from a solid, supercilious, overbearing neighbor.
That's what it boils down to. For 22 years tin* Big Nine passes itself
oil' as too pure to involve itself in commercialized bowl games. Then it
suddenly decides to take over, and delivers an ultimatum to that eflect—
either the Coast Conference accepts immediately, or they can wait an
other 22 years. Of course the obvious play was for the Coast fathers
to till them they could go to hell in a bucket—but they missed their cue.
"Coast Sold Rose Howl Birthright"
Comment all over the country has been bad. Paul Zimmerman of the
L.A. Times says,"The Pacific Coast Conference sold the Rose Bowl birth
right for a bundle of high-sounding phrases about athletic responsibility."

Ned Cronin of the L.A. News says,
"This whole Rose Bowl arrangement
places the Pacific Coast Conference
in the position of being dictated to
by the Big Nine. The Pacific Coast
Conference has always been able to
stand on its own feet before with
out the Big Nine governing its poli
cies and administration. And how
can they sit there with straight faces
in Berkeley and say Army was elim
inated because it proselyted play
ers?"
The Los Angeles examples have
been used because that's where
feeling was highest. It's a South
land team that must go into the
Bowl New Year's Day with noth
ing to win and everything to lose.
