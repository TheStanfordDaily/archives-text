# Thompson Stars As Cards Top Spartans
## 
### ART SHAPIRO 
The Big Red Basketball Machine started off with a flourish
last night, sputtered a bit, and then purred home to a 45 to 33
victory over the Spartans of San Jose State. After leading 25 to 16
at the half-way mark the Cardinals began to unravel along the
seams. Lead by Taylor and Sontagg, the State boys surged back
to within 5 points of the Stanford courtmen.

Then the heavens opened and the'
ball game was fini as far as the
i Spartans were concerned. Scores by
j Davidson and Thompson shut the
| door on San Jose, and from there
| on in it was all Stanford.
scorer for the Indians was
Morley Thompson who garnered 14
points for the cause. Sontagg with
!) markers was high man for San
} Jose.
The scoring started within a
minute of the opening horn.
Thompson taking a pass from
down court, whirled, twisted and
dumped in a beautiful shot from
the side court. The parade of Car
dinal scores continued as Thomp
son hit the mark again, then Dav
idson, and so on down until the
score stood at 20 to 3 with only ten
minutes elapsed in the first half.
A fuse blew, a piston failed, and
I the Machine began to groan a bit
as the Spartans started on the come
back trail. Taylor contributed two
field goals, Inman and Wilson tallied
with another two and the margin
had dwindled down nine counters,
j Each squad hit the hoops for five
more points and thats how the
score stood at the half, 25 to 16.
The second half started out as a
nightmare and turned into a dream.
The Indians began to throw the ball
I around as if it were a hot potato,
| no one wanted to hang onto it and
no one did. San Jose took over the
offensive and almost continuously
I dominated the play under the net.
The Spartans kept coming and
Indians kept going. With the
scoreboard reading 31 to 2(i, the
, Stanford hoopmen suddenly found
their long-lost attack and applied
the crusher to a well meaning but
outclassed San Jose State five.
Morley Thompson sparkled like a
round-cut diamond. Fast, a clever
j ball handler, and endowed with a
I crowd-raising jump shot, Morley
was the boy to give the Varsity the
! push they needed, and push he did.
Dave Davidson, Bill Drehobl, and
| Bill Stephenson tallied seven mark
[ ors apiece, and Dick Berlin came
through with four more to round out
I the starting quintet's scoring punch.
