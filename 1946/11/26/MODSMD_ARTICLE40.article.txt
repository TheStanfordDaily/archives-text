DECISION CAUSES REPLAY
The important playoff game be
! tween the Dekes and Village 208
will be replayed today after yester
day's protest. In yesterday's game,
| the Dekes were awarded a 6-0 vie
| tory on a pass interference penalty
| in the end zone, but the decision
| was proven faulty.
The protested penalty was call
ed as McDonough was running for
a pass from Deke halfback Johns.
The referee ruled interference in
the end/.one and gave the Dekes
6 points. The rules, however, state
that a pass interference play in the
endzone can result only in the ball
being placed on the one-vard line,
and not in a touchdown.
In a third playoff game, the Betas
I walked over El Toro 26-7. Paul
Nieto stood out as he scored three
J of the four Beta tallies.
The undefeated champions of
S League V, the Questionmarks,
! romped to a 27-0 victory over Vilâ€”
! lage 216.
