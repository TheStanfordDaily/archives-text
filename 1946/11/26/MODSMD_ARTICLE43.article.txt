### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 25 (UP). Fifteen carloads of police
stood by helplessly today while Southern California Trojan stu
dents captured 10 carloads of UCLA supporters who raided the
campus to qloat over their 13 to 6 qridiron victorv Saturday.

Nearly 10.000 students took part
in the cross-town collegiate brawl
which flared during a victory cele
bration on the UCLA campus.
TKOJANS LOSE PANTS
The trouble began when four Tro
jans delivered the traditional vic
tory bell, symbol of football su
premacy between the two schools,
to the Westwood campus. Jubilant
Uelans deprived them of their pants
and sent them back to Troy with a
10-car escort.
When Bruin supporters began
roaring through the campus. I'SC
students poured from classrooms,
surrounded the intruders and
stripped their cars of wiring,
sparkplugs, fenders, seats and
tires. The cars then were smear
ed with paint.
A Bruin jeep was lettered with
such insults as "Here's a Dirty
Bruin" and "UCLA's Unlucky Day"
and pushed into a pool in front of
Doheny Library.
CO-EDS MANHANDLED
Fifteen Bruin co-eds who at

tempted to avoid capture by lock
ing themselves in their cars were
manhandled before they were res
cued by I'SC sorority sisters.
Male Bruins were forced to wash
the "Tommy Trojan" statue, eat
grease and then submit to head
shaving. The Trojan statue had
been daubed with black and blue
paint by raiding Bruins last Friday
night.
