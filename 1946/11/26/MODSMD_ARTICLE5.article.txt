# Nazi Literature Received by Libe
## 
### 
Hoover Library has received 10
boxes of German books and docu
ments on the ex-German colonies
issued during the National Socialist
period from Ernest J. Cramer, an
ex-ASTP student at Stanford.
Some of the documents explain
the German need and desire for the
return of the ex-German colonies.
However, many are serious politi
cal and economic surveys on the
colonies and the colonial problems
to be solved.
The problems covered include
such fields as economics, politics,
geography, and anthropology. Also
included are books of travel and
poems and songs of the colonial
peoples.
