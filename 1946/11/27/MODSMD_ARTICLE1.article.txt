# Sicilian to Broadcast First Program Jan. 6
## 
### 
An evening of special broadcasts will mark the taking to the
air of the Stanford Broadcasting Station next January 6. Tentative
arrangements are being made to feature a Hollyr/ood guest star
to appear in Memorial Auditorium before a student and parents
audience.

+ On .subsequent evenings during
! the two-month trial period a regu
lar schedule, probably from 7 p.m.
to midnight, will be filled and
broadcast to the five named living
groups on campus.
Plans now are to have the main
studios in the Village with facilities
for broadcasts to originate on cam
pus, probably in Memorial Hall.
Studio and control room facilities
are already built at the Village and
j turntables and control equipment
will be installed during Christmas
! vacation.
A staff of more than ten announc
ers will be needed a.s well as copy
writers, advertising salesmen, engi
neers. and business oflice personnel.
Bill Eilers, one of the student mem
bers of the committee which has
been investigating the station, stat
ed that tryouts would probably be
held early next quarter, but that
anyone wishing to work on the sta
tion over Christmas should contact
him at Tamarack, P.A. 87- r )2.
During the second month of op
eration, a listener survey will be
held to determine program prefer
i ences of the students, best broad
cast times, best types of advertising,
and other related matters.
Eilers has suggested that two five
minute newscasts be given during
an evening's schedule, at 7:30 and
11 :-30. Both campus and world news
would be handled in co-operation
! with the Daily.
