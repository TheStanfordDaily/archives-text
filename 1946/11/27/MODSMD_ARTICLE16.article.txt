### BOB TAYLOR 
There's been a lot of talk around the campus lately about
the International Survey Committee, just what is it and how
did it begin around here? These are leading questions and de
serve to be answered.
The Stanford International Survey Committee was born, after

years of conjecture regarding simi
lar plans, by the action and per
sistence of A.S.S.U. President Mai
tin Anderson shortly after his elec
tion last spring.
A preliminary conference was
held in the spring, at which linn-
Anderson appointed Niel Allen tn
bring forth the idea for considera -
tion at the beginning of autumn
quarter. Thereupon Allen began in
vestigating methods of organization
of a functional body to commence
action. Bob Hoyt joined him in
November, and together under An
derson's direction they formulated
the organizational structure whifch
was approved by Excom Nov. 13
The primary purpose of I.S.C. I:
to send Stanford students abroad on
summer tours to observe existing
conditions, economic, political, and
cu'tural, in interesting areas, and
report those observations to the
student body. The plan as visual -
ized by Anderson will bring to th«
student body a clearer understand
ing of the people of foreign land: ,
their ideas, and the influences prev
alent thai work to shape their live:..
Four students will be selected thi;*
winter for tours next summer. They
will be sent to areas that are and
will continue to be important in our
lives. Upon returning, their ac
quaintance, gained through actual
contact with the people and <on
ditions in these countries, will be
fully transmitted to the student
body.
The representatives will be cho
sen during winter quarter. The r
students will receive instruction:; in
the spring from the foreign commit,
tee, departing in the summer fot
approximately two months. Hep"i
will be submitted to the stiid-nf.
body on their return in autumn
quarter, and then filed for refer
ence. The project will be finan •<!
by A.S.S.U. funds.
Selection will be executed on ■ >
basis of academic and activity ;et
ord, followed by an interview o)
prospective representatives by the
selection committee, which is com
posed of three faculty member;, and
three students.
Applications will be accepted
starting on the opening day of win
ter quarter.
