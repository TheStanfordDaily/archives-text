## Blast the Status Quo 
### 
With a feeble salute to what might have
been, and with lull knowledge that only revo
lution can straighten out the future, we will
devote a few paragraphs of our farewell aut
umn Daily to an analysis of the student atti
tudes which this quarter have led the student
body into new and saddening depths of com
placency.
Admitting that there has been no wilful
attempt to do wrong, we will wrathfully say
that there has been no honest attempt on the
part of the majority of individuals to do what
they will admit, if shown, is right! Most stu
dents have ceased to hold to the objectives
which are important in this day and in this
place: 1) getting an education; 2) learning to
accept and carry responsibility; 3) determina
tion of truth and right.
finding a mate and preparing to make
millions are the tv/o most obvious student ob
jectives in autumn quarter, 1946. Furthermore,
most students holding these objectives aren't
slaving over either, but expect to accomplish
both by merely letting four years of college
grind away underneath them.
The vast majority are attending the all
c.tmpus dances every Friday and Saturday
nights, tearing off to Rosotti's after every two
o'clock class, laughing at general moral laxity
all under the heading of doing what the
"crowd" thinks is acceptable.
Sad, but true, the crowd itself doesn't know
wli.it its objectives are, and in consequence,
wo follow its lead and sprawl our college ac
tivities over an incomprehensible scale into
hundreds of dead-end directions.
It's not that we haven't the ability to evalu
ate but that we forget why we're here, who

we are, and what we want to be. We are
caught in the whirlpool of Stanfordism and
"being collegiate," and allow ourselves to be
swirled about without any attempts to stand
on our own feet. We have ceased to determine
our lives for ourselves—or even to try.
Fact is, there's no one to blame but all of
us. We all laugh gaily at whatever truths ex
isted in Mrs. Hight's letter, at clever methods
for concealing liquor in campus rooms, at the
way we're "flunking out —honestly!" when
we don't have to. We shrug resignedly to
hear the the Four Feathers Drive failed, that
student elections have for a long time been
casually illegal, that only a few students
bother to attend the Y's lecture programs, or
turn in Flonor Code violators, or cared about
being good at whatever campus jobs they took
on. These are the things we stand against as
a self-governing university community.
The situation demands an overhaul of
values and objectives from all students—so
that studying becomes the important thing, so
that intellectual progress has a place instead
of moral indilference. It demands from those
persons and organizations who are nominally
the leaders —Excom, the fraternities, campus
publications, Phi Betes, and house presidents
an active stand against any drop in moral
standards, against liquor and Honor Code vio
lations, against indifference to those things
which are important not only to students but
to world citizens.
It demands a deep-reaching recognition of
individual responsibility. Every student must
learn to be true to the ideals he yells about,
and make his activities support them—wheth
er it be as a very private person or as a student
body officer.

we are, and what we want to be. We are
caught in the whirlpool of Stanfordism and
"being collegiate," and allow ourselves to be
swirled about without any attempts to stand
on our own feet. We have ceased to determine
our lives for ourselves—or even to try.
Fact is, there's no one to blame but all of
us. We all laugh gaily at whatever truths ex
isted in Mrs. Hight's letter, at clever methods
for concealing liquor in campus rooms, at the
way we're "flunking out —honestly!" when
we don't have to. We shrug resignedly to
hear the the Four Feathers Drive failed, that
student elections have for a long time been
casually illegal, that only a few students
bother to attend the Y's lecture programs, or
turn in Flonor Code violators, or cared about
being good at whatever campus jobs they took
on. These are the things we stand against as
a self-governing university community.
The situation demands an overhaul of
values and objectives from all students—so
that studying becomes the important thing, so
that intellectual progress has a place instead
of moral indilference. It demands from those
persons and organizations who are nominally
the leaders —Excom, the fraternities, campus
publications, Phi Betes, and house presidents
an active stand against any drop in moral
standards, against liquor and Honor Code vio
lations, against indifference to those things
which are important not only to students but
to world citizens.
It demands a deep-reaching recognition of
individual responsibility. Every student must
learn to be true to the ideals he yells about,
and make his activities support them—wheth
er it be as a very private person or as a student
body officer.
With a feeble salute to what might have
been, and with lull knowledge that only revo
lution can straighten out the future, we will
devote a few paragraphs of our farewell aut
umn Daily to an analysis of the student atti
tudes which this quarter have led the student
body into new and saddening depths of com
placency.
Admitting that there has been no wilful
attempt to do wrong, we will wrathfully say
that there has been no honest attempt on the
part of the majority of individuals to do what
they will admit, if shown, is right! Most stu
dents have ceased to hold to the objectives
which are important in this day and in this
place: 1) getting an education; 2) learning to
accept and carry responsibility; 3) determina
tion of truth and right.
finding a mate and preparing to make
millions are the tv/o most obvious student ob
jectives in autumn quarter, 1946. Furthermore,
most students holding these objectives aren't
slaving over either, but expect to accomplish
both by merely letting four years of college
grind away underneath them.
The vast majority are attending the all
c.tmpus dances every Friday and Saturday
nights, tearing off to Rosotti's after every two
o'clock class, laughing at general moral laxity
all under the heading of doing what the
"crowd" thinks is acceptable.
Sad, but true, the crowd itself doesn't know
wli.it its objectives are, and in consequence,
wo follow its lead and sprawl our college ac
tivities over an incomprehensible scale into
hundreds of dead-end directions.
It's not that we haven't the ability to evalu
ate but that we forget why we're here, who

we are, and what we want to be. We are
