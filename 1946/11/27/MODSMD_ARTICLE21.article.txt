# BILL COUGHLIN
## BULL SESSION 
### 
Whcreinell did llie quarter go to? Seems like it
v/;i :n't iiioie than a couple ol' days ago that I was
pelting my brains b'.>at in (so that's why he's that
way!) battling the brutal mob on Reg Day.
And now here it is the last paper of the quarter.
Almost finals week. And".30" for Coughlin as the
Daily's Bull-Sessioner. Somebody must have stolen
a page or so of! my calendar. What happened to Oc
tob-r and where did November go to? Probably out
to Kossotti's for a beer together.

So being of feeble mind and horribly unsound
body, 1 can herewith consider myself privileged to
follow the repulsive tradition of bequeathing a list
of things to my successor. There are all sorts of
odds and ends stacked here in my Use on a Rainy
Day file.
And so to the poor wretch who falls heir to this
large blank space on page 2, I leave the following
in:,l ructions:
Use the item about the Stanford girl who tried
to pick up a couple of soldiers in the City and
I a i I' d miserably. If you can't find room for it, sell it
to Chappie. They'll print anything.
Investigate and find out if it's true some Stan
lord professors are monitoring their classes during
examinations, I'll give you a few names. What
have we got an Honor Code for if it isn't going to
be trusted.
Agitate for the formation of an Axe Society.

Smiley is getting tired of going out and rounding up
the Axe every time some wheel on campus loses
track of it.
Take all of Rally Com up lo a small room in the
War Libe and lock them in together. They've all
worked real hard and need a rest. Then throw the
key in the lake. They might get out during basket
ball season.
Find out why world-famous Stanford professors
stand up in front of a class and spend the entire
course reading out. of somebody else's book. Why
should .students pay $500 tuition and room and board
when they could get the same thing and more out
of a correspondence course?
Keep lots of pornographic patter in the column
so that Endsley will have something to chuckle over
while he drinks his morning coffee. And the Ad
ministration to gag over.
See if you can locate a nice dark parking place
for that notorious couple of mine to be alone in.
The last time they tried it (parking, that is) a blood
hound chased them.
find out who stole the wheel off my unicycle. It's
just harder than hell to pedal without it.
And last but not least, if you happen to spend
your last Big Game in the U.C. hospital and then
someone comes up to you and nudges you in the
libs hard and says, "Say, that was a terrific gag
you made up about missing the Big Game," then
KICK HIM IN THE TEETH FOR ME, WILL YOU?
See ya.
