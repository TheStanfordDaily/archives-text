## HISTORY 1946 
### 
This being the lust '"History" of the quarter, a
briel recapitulation of significant events seems ap
propriate. For one thing, this Autumn Quarter has
seen the end of the OPA. Those who lought for the
removal ol controls, predicted that removal of price
(••ilmes would stimulate production and speed re
conversion, and that the resulting increase in goods
available would bring prices down 4ml end the in
flationary situation that unquestionably existed.
Supporters of OPA predicted increased and disas
trous inflation. What has happened? Most prices
rose sharply with the removal of controls and then
settled back to points not much above ceiling. In
some cases, a flood of hoarded commodities poured
into the market and prices sagged below the old
(filings. Without doubt the unwinding of OPA's
red tape has encouraged businessmen in general
and small business men in particular. But as things
stand now, there is no clear answer. Disaster has
not struck us, but there certainly are not two cars
in every garage. Predictions point to a sharp busi
ness decline early next year, but how serious it
will Ik? and how long it will last we will know next
year.
NO NF.WS IS OOOI) NEWS
I he international picture has not changed much,
which, to my mind, is encouraging. So many people
have devoted so much time and energy to finding
dark catastrophe in every move of every power and
party that it is reassuring to find that the old boat
is still riding the waves. The Russophobes, Anglo
phobes, etc.-phobes, who predict war at the drop
of a hat (and are willing to drop the hat, too) seem,
so far, to be living in a harassed, neurotic world of
their own. So fur the several nations, large and
• mall, whatever we may think of their intentions,
are co-operating. They may not be accomplishing

much, but they are not fighting any wars. 1 would
point out to those who wonder shrilly why the UN
doesn t do something that most of the present prob
lems arise out of the peace treaties settling the late
war, and point out that the several powers are doing
their best not to involve the UN in any responsibility
for these treaties. It was a fundamental weakness of
the League of Nations that it was created by the
Versailles Treaty.
The most outstanding development in domestic
politics was the Republican victory in the congres
sional elections. Many people have predicted many
things to come from this change of horses, but after
a long and more or less impartial look at the situa
tion I leel justified in repeating my former conclu
sion that, whatever the GOP-men say, they will not
turn tin* political and economic arrangements of this
country either upside-down or right-side-up. Both
parties are committed to one foreign policy, both
have their eyes on the 48 election, and an effective
balance of power in the federal government has been
brought into existence.
Ihursday is Thanksgiving Day, and we have much
for which to be thankful, humbly thankful. W«*
should be thankful for a country not ravaged by war;
one in which we can worry about when and at what
price we can produce steaks and new cars, not how
we are to produce enough bread to keep alive. We
should be thankful still that the war is over, and the
veteran and his family should be thankful that he
is home again. We shoujd be thankful that there is
no prospect of war in the immediate future, and that
the nations together are attempting to prevent all
war. We should be thankful that we are sliil free
to elect such a government as we choose, and, as an
anti-climax, we should be thankful that in Calil'or
nia we can along without coal.
