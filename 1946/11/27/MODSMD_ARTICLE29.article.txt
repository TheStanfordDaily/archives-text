Lessons in How to Kick
A Man When He's Down

Rally round, chums; last stop for the season.
We see by the papers, that there is a movement underway to evict
Frank Wiekhorst from his present coaching position at Berkeley. It seems
that just about everybody has an opinion about his coaching abilities, but
everybody hasn't the space to run it in the paper. Well, we've got an
opinion, too, and we've got space.
We're not too impressed by Wiekhorst: when he worked for Stub Alli
son at C'al prior to the late unpleasantness, he built the Slubber some
mighty fine lines—like the ">7 Thunder Team with Stockton, Schwartz,
Ilerwig, etc. Early 111 is year California made him head coach, with more
attending whoop-de-doo and hocus-pocus than we've seen since OSS
went out of business.
Everybody- bar none—thought it would be a fine thing having Wick
as mentor to the Bears. Some people even figured on Berkeley putting
out one of the "best" teams on the Coast this year, about the fifth or
sixth "best."
Well, Berkeley didn't produce, and Wiekhorst didn't produce. So now
the very same wolves, with one or two noticeable exceptions, have de
scended upon the old homestead, and the working over they're giving the
man isn't pleasant to watch or read about at all.
In all fairness to a man who is at least honest—which is more than we
can say for a certain morning rag in the city which has been raking him
over the coals anonymously—we feel inclined to stick in our oar in his
defense. We don't think Wick is a great coach; since Rockne, Yost. Jones
passed away, and Warner retired we know of only one "great coach" still
in business: 87-year-old Amos Alonzo Stagg of College of Pacific.
For the rest of the coaching fraternity, we'll say there are some very
good men in the business today; but we don't think they're great. We
won't even put Wiekhorst in with the very good ones—but he's a coach
and lie's done another tolerable job with his line this season.
With a few glaring exceptions, we would like to forward the proposi
tion that as a very general rule line coaches do not make the best head
coaches. Yeah, we know, Leahy et al. But this rule is just general.
The fishwrupper up in the City is barking at the wrong tree: they were
in favor of Wick getting the job over Charley Erb. and they're also the
first one to throw him to the wolves. It for no other reason than il he
sticks around we'll win another Big Game next year, we're in favor of
Cal keeping Wiekhorst.
The Poor Man's All-America
More opinions: everybody is wondering how they re going to put eleven
men on an All-American selection this year. We're wondering too, and
we've still got space to till so here goes. Endsley says 1 m a damn tool, so
I'm gonna pick an All-America squad of 58 men instead. The paper you re
reading, at the moment is the STANFORD DAILY, so don t be surprised
al anything you see. Stand back:
For the ends we have UCLA's Baldwin. Nevada s (tilloin. Washington s
Ha gen, Army's Poole and Foldberg, Texas' Bechtol, Illinois Bauman, (JSCs
Hardy, Notre Dame's O'Conner. Had enough?
The tackles would be Penn's Savitsky. Georgia Tech s Davis, UCLA s
Chambers, Ohio State's C'suri. Army's Bryant. St. Mary's McPartland, No
tre Dame's Sullivan. Nuff? ,
For the guards we have Illinois' Agase. Notre Dame's Mastrangelo,
Ohio State's Amling, Army's Steffy, USC's Garzoni, Texas' Jungmichel,
Stanford's Ilachtcn, Washington's Zeger. Whoa?
The centers: Alabama's Maniha. Notre Dame's Walsh, Georgia Tech's
Duke, USC's McCormick, UCLA's Paul. Uncle?
At the quarterback post we have entered: Illinois' Rykovich, Notre
Dame's Lujack, Auburn's Tidwell, Army's Tucker. St. Mary's O Conner,
UCLA's Case. Arkansas' Scott. Quit?
At left half is: Michigan's Chappius, Alabama's Gilmer, Georgia's Trippi.
North Carolina's Justice, Army's Davis, St. Mary's Wedemeyer, USF's Hall,
Washington's Provo, Stanford's AndersQn, Oklahoma A&M's Fenimore.
Halt?
Running out of the right half spot: Illinois' Young. Mississippi State's
Me Williams, UCLA's Rossi. Notre Dame's Brennan, Penn's Mi nisi. Oregon
State's Samuels. Stop?
The fullbacks are: Ohio State's Whisler, Army's Blanchard. USC's Mu
siek. Stanford's Merriman, Texas' Layne. Yale's Jackson. Yipe?
The ones that are in bold face are Endsley's 33-man squad; the rest
nre also good men whom it is hard to eliminate. If you've got any beefs
see Endsley. Me? I pick 'em all.

Thanks to the shortsightedness of
Editor Beth Mac Vicar, the Stanford
Daily is probably the only paper on
the Pacific Coast without a Thanks
; iving editorial. To which we sol
emnly say thanks—and amen.
In case anybody needs a reason
for Thanksgiving we offer this—
I lie football season has come to a
close as far as the Daily is con
cerned and we won't have to read
any more "Peculiar Prognostica

However, there's some fairly good
football still to be played before

coaches. Yeah, we know, Leahy et al. But this rule is just general.
The fishwrupper up in the City is barking at the wrong tree: they were

The Poor Man's All-America
More opinions: everybody is wondering how they re going to put eleven
men on an All-American selection this year. We're wondering too, and
we've still got space to till so here goes. Endsley says 1 m a damn tool, so
I'm gonna pick an All-America squad of 58 men instead. The paper you re
reading, at the moment is the STANFORD DAILY, so don t be surprised
al anything you see. Stand back:

The ones that are in bold face are Endsley's 33-man squad; the rest

Lessons in How to Kick
A Man When He's Down

Rally round, chums; last stop for the season.
We see by the papers, that there is a movement underway to evict
Frank Wiekhorst from his present coaching position at Berkeley. It seems
that just about everybody has an opinion about his coaching abilities, but
everybody hasn't the space to run it in the paper. Well, we've got an
opinion, too, and we've got space.
We're not too impressed by Wiekhorst: when he worked for Stub Alli
son at C'al prior to the late unpleasantness, he built the Slubber some
mighty fine lines—like the ">7 Thunder Team with Stockton, Schwartz,
Ilerwig, etc. Early 111 is year California made him head coach, with more
attending whoop-de-doo and hocus-pocus than we've seen since OSS
went out of business.
Everybody- bar none—thought it would be a fine thing having Wick
as mentor to the Bears. Some people even figured on Berkeley putting
out one of the "best" teams on the Coast this year, about the fifth or
sixth "best."
Well, Berkeley didn't produce, and Wiekhorst didn't produce. So now
the very same wolves, with one or two noticeable exceptions, have de
scended upon the old homestead, and the working over they're giving the
man isn't pleasant to watch or read about at all.
In all fairness to a man who is at least honest—which is more than we
can say for a certain morning rag in the city which has been raking him
over the coals anonymously—we feel inclined to stick in our oar in his
defense. We don't think Wick is a great coach; since Rockne, Yost. Jones
passed away, and Warner retired we know of only one "great coach" still
in business: 87-year-old Amos Alonzo Stagg of College of Pacific.
For the rest of the coaching fraternity, we'll say there are some very
good men in the business today; but we don't think they're great. We
won't even put Wiekhorst in with the very good ones—but he's a coach
and lie's done another tolerable job with his line this season.
With a few glaring exceptions, we would like to forward the proposi

Lessons in How to Kick
A Man When He's Down

Rally round, chums; last stop for the season.
We see by the papers, that there is a movement underway to evict
Frank Wiekhorst from his present coaching position at Berkeley. It seems
that just about everybody has an opinion about his coaching abilities, but
everybody hasn't the space to run it in the paper. Well, we've got an
opinion, too, and we've got space.
We're not too impressed by Wiekhorst: when he worked for Stub Alli
son at C'al prior to the late unpleasantness, he built the Slubber some
mighty fine lines—like the ">7 Thunder Team with Stockton, Schwartz,
Ilerwig, etc. Early 111 is year California made him head coach, with more
attending whoop-de-doo and hocus-pocus than we've seen since OSS
went out of business.
Everybody- bar none—thought it would be a fine thing having Wick
as mentor to the Bears. Some people even figured on Berkeley putting
out one of the "best" teams on the Coast this year, about the fifth or
sixth "best."
Well, Berkeley didn't produce, and Wiekhorst didn't produce. So now
the very same wolves, with one or two noticeable exceptions, have de
scended upon the old homestead, and the working over they're giving the
man isn't pleasant to watch or read about at all.
In all fairness to a man who is at least honest—which is more than we
can say for a certain morning rag in the city which has been raking him
over the coals anonymously—we feel inclined to stick in our oar in his
defense. We don't think Wick is a great coach; since Rockne, Yost. Jones
passed away, and Warner retired we know of only one "great coach" still
in business: 87-year-old Amos Alonzo Stagg of College of Pacific.
For the rest of the coaching fraternity, we'll say there are some very
good men in the business today; but we don't think they're great. We
won't even put Wiekhorst in with the very good ones—but he's a coach
and lie's done another tolerable job with his line this season.
With a few glaring exceptions, we would like to forward the proposi
tion that as a very general rule line coaches do not make the best head
coaches. Yeah, we know, Leahy et al. But this rule is just general.
The fishwrupper up in the City is barking at the wrong tree: they were
in favor of Wick getting the job over Charley Erb. and they're also the
first one to throw him to the wolves. It for no other reason than il he
sticks around we'll win another Big Game next year, we're in favor of
Cal keeping Wiekhorst.
The Poor Man's All-America
More opinions: everybody is wondering how they re going to put eleven
men on an All-American selection this year. We're wondering too, and
we've still got space to till so here goes. Endsley says 1 m a damn tool, so
I'm gonna pick an All-America squad of 58 men instead. The paper you re
reading, at the moment is the STANFORD DAILY, so don t be surprised
al anything you see. Stand back:
For the ends we have UCLA's Baldwin. Nevada s (tilloin. Washington s
Ha gen, Army's Poole and Foldberg, Texas' Bechtol, Illinois Bauman, (JSCs

Lessons in How to Kick
A Man When He's Down

Rally round, chums; last stop for the season.
We see by the papers, that there is a movement underway to evict
Frank Wiekhorst from his present coaching position at Berkeley. It seems
that just about everybody has an opinion about his coaching abilities, but
everybody hasn't the space to run it in the paper. Well, we've got an
opinion, too, and we've got space.
We're not too impressed by Wiekhorst: when he worked for Stub Alli
son at C'al prior to the late unpleasantness, he built the Slubber some
mighty fine lines—like the ">7 Thunder Team with Stockton, Schwartz,
Ilerwig, etc. Early 111 is year California made him head coach, with more
attending whoop-de-doo and hocus-pocus than we've seen since OSS
went out of business.
Everybody- bar none—thought it would be a fine thing having Wick
as mentor to the Bears. Some people even figured on Berkeley putting
out one of the "best" teams on the Coast this year, about the fifth or
sixth "best."
Well, Berkeley didn't produce, and Wiekhorst didn't produce. So now
the very same wolves, with one or two noticeable exceptions, have de
scended upon the old homestead, and the working over they're giving the
man isn't pleasant to watch or read about at all.
In all fairness to a man who is at least honest—which is more than we
can say for a certain morning rag in the city which has been raking him
over the coals anonymously—we feel inclined to stick in our oar in his
defense. We don't think Wick is a great coach; since Rockne, Yost. Jones
passed away, and Warner retired we know of only one "great coach" still
in business: 87-year-old Amos Alonzo Stagg of College of Pacific.
For the rest of the coaching fraternity, we'll say there are some very
good men in the business today; but we don't think they're great. We
won't even put Wiekhorst in with the very good ones—but he's a coach
and lie's done another tolerable job with his line this season.
With a few glaring exceptions, we would like to forward the proposi
tion that as a very general rule line coaches do not make the best head
coaches. Yeah, we know, Leahy et al. But this rule is just general.
The fishwrupper up in the City is barking at the wrong tree: they were
in favor of Wick getting the job over Charley Erb. and they're also the
first one to throw him to the wolves. It for no other reason than il he
sticks around we'll win another Big Game next year, we're in favor of
Cal keeping Wiekhorst.
The Poor Man's All-America
More opinions: everybody is wondering how they re going to put eleven
men on an All-American selection this year. We're wondering too, and
we've still got space to till so here goes. Endsley says 1 m a damn tool, so
I'm gonna pick an All-America squad of 58 men instead. The paper you re
reading, at the moment is the STANFORD DAILY, so don t be surprised
al anything you see. Stand back:
For the ends we have UCLA's Baldwin. Nevada s (tilloin. Washington s
Ha gen, Army's Poole and Foldberg, Texas' Bechtol, Illinois Bauman, (JSCs
Hardy, Notre Dame's O'Conner. Had enough?
The tackles would be Penn's Savitsky. Georgia Tech s Davis, UCLA s
Chambers, Ohio State's C'suri. Army's Bryant. St. Mary's McPartland, No
tre Dame's Sullivan. Nuff? ,
For the guards we have Illinois' Agase. Notre Dame's Mastrangelo,
Ohio State's Amling, Army's Steffy, USC's Garzoni, Texas' Jungmichel,
Stanford's Ilachtcn, Washington's Zeger. Whoa?
The centers: Alabama's Maniha. Notre Dame's Walsh, Georgia Tech's
Duke, USC's McCormick, UCLA's Paul. Uncle?
At the quarterback post we have entered: Illinois' Rykovich, Notre
Dame's Lujack, Auburn's Tidwell, Army's Tucker. St. Mary's O Conner,
UCLA's Case. Arkansas' Scott. Quit?
At left half is: Michigan's Chappius, Alabama's Gilmer, Georgia's Trippi.
North Carolina's Justice, Army's Davis, St. Mary's Wedemeyer, USF's Hall,
Washington's Provo, Stanford's AndersQn, Oklahoma A&M's Fenimore.
Halt?
Running out of the right half spot: Illinois' Young. Mississippi State's
Me Williams, UCLA's Rossi. Notre Dame's Brennan, Penn's Mi nisi. Oregon
State's Samuels. Stop?
The fullbacks are: Ohio State's Whisler, Army's Blanchard. USC's Mu
siek. Stanford's Merriman, Texas' Layne. Yale's Jackson. Yipe?
The ones that are in bold face are Endsley's 33-man squad; the rest
nre also good men whom it is hard to eliminate. If you've got any beefs
see Endsley. Me? I pick 'em all.

Thanks to the shortsightedness of
Editor Beth Mac Vicar, the Stanford
Daily is probably the only paper on
the Pacific Coast without a Thanks
; iving editorial. To which we sol
emnly say thanks—and amen.
In case anybody needs a reason
for Thanksgiving we offer this—
I lie football season has come to a
close as far as the Daily is con
cerned and we won't have to read
any more "Peculiar Prognostica
tions." We'll give the Slinger
c redit for this, though, he had 20
wins. 4 losses, and a pair of ties
lor an average of .s;»!5. .800 is con
sidered perfect in this business.
Not had, kid, and I don't mean the
poetry, cither.
However, there's some fairly good
football still to be played before
Jan. 2, '47. not the least of which is
the annual eastern Big Game twixt
Army and Nnvy at Philadelphia this
Saturday. Should be good—l'll pick
Army (I'm brave). Another goody
is the south's Big Game with Geor
gia and Georgia Tech vying for some
soi l of honors or other. Me?—l take
Trippi.
