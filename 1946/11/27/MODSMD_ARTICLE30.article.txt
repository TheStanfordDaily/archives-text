# Hoopmen Meet Spartans Again Tonight at Sail Jose
## 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
Stanford's basketbrawlers carry on where they left off against
San Jose State when they travel down to the Spartan Gym to
night to renew the battle. Victors Monday night by a score of
45 to 33, the prospects call for another win—but it isn't a fore
gone conclusion. The Staters have always been tough to beat
on their home hardwood.

Coach Everett Dean intends to
open with the same team —Morley
Thompson and Hill Drehobl at the
forwards. Bill Stephenson at cen
ter. Dick Berlin and Dave David
son at the guards. The aforesaid
'lhompson is expected to carry the
offensive load, hut Dave Davidson
didn't look had up till the time
hew as waved out of the game via
the fouls route. He had already
bucketed seven points, which ain't
had—for a guard.
Tho Spartans also are expected to
open with the same starting quintet
—Maggetti anci Sontagg at the tor
wards, Robinson at center, Holmes
and Inrnan at tlie guards. These lads
all looked like they had two left

This is in the nature of a be
lated credit line for Daily photogs
Phil Welch and Boh Dillon. They
snapped plenty of fine shots for
the sports section this year—not
all of which we were able to run
—and more often than not the
dope on the sports desk for the
evening forgot to give them a
mention. Sad though it is to re
late. the responsible parties were
usually Smiley Farkas or Dan
Endsley.
I'll il and Bob also did much of
the shutter-clicking for the Big
Game issue. Whether it was ac
tion shots or stills, they always
turned out good work. The sports
section appreciates all the time
donated—at no salary whatsoever
—and hopes to he forgiven for
forgetting credit lines in the face
of more world-shaking events—
like football games, for instance.
