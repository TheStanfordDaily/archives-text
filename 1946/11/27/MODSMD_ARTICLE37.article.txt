United Nations site delegates, who
were in this vicinity Friday, ex
pressed much interest in a tract of
land between Redwood City and
Woodside, according to Alvin C. Eu
rich, academic vice-president.
Saturday, 22 of the delegates at
tended the Big Game, sitting direct
ly behind the Indian rooting section.
They were observed showing fur
ther interest in the speed and power
of the Big Red Machine.
The delegates are now in Boston
examining that city's offering for a
permanent location. Their decision
probably will be announced Mon
day.
Mr. Enrich believes that the site
committee, however, is more inter
ested in the Presidio than in the
Woodside land, as the former al
ready has living facilities and is
more available to San Francisco.
If the U.N. should locate near
Stanford, Mr. Eurich says that they
would serve as a laboratory for Farm
students and faculty interested in
international relations. "There would
be a considerable impact on the
University," he said. "Scholars
would come here from all over the
world, much as they did to Geneva
in the "20's."
"There would be considerable ex
changing of views and research be
tween U.N. personnel and Stanford
faculty and students." The docu
ments in the Hoover War Library
would be of tremendous value to
the U.N., he said.
The general reaction of the site
delegates, Mr. Eurich believes, is
that they would be quite welcome :
in this area. The friendliness of San
Francisco to the Conference in 1945
jvas very impressive to the dele
gates, according to Mr. Eurich.
