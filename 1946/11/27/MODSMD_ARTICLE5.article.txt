# Wittgenstein Piano Recital Draws Capacity Audience
## 
### 
Stanford students and townspeople crowded Memorial Hall last night
to hear one-armed concert pianist Paul Wittgenstein perform on the final
Tuesday Evening Series program of the autumn quarter.
A good share of the audience may have come to hear how one-armed
niano nlavint> sounded. Those who were curious and those who eame to

hear a recital of'fine music were not
disappointed.
The capacity audience heard an
amazing hour's recital by the left
handed pianist who lost his right
arm in World War I.
In Mi'. Wittgenstein's own words,
"One-handed piano playing should
.sound like good music well per
formed." Audience response to Mr.
Wittgenstein's performance of works
hy Bach-Brahms, Liszt, Godowsky,
and Saint-Saens, indicated the cal
iber of his playing.
Continued applause brought Mr.
Wittgenstein back for an encore af
ter the concluding number, his own
arrangement of the Liszt-Verdi "Ri
goletto-Paraphrase."
In a short lecture on one-handed
piano playing, the conceit star ex
plained that the left hand is the
more effective of the two hands for
one-handed playing. The fingers arc
stronger and the leaping and jump
ing necessary are made easier.
Tuesday Evening Series programs
will be resumed on Jan. 7.â€”Haight
