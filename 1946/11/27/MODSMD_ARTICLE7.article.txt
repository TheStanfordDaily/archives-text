# University Will Open KSU on Trial
## 
### 
Approval of plans for a campus broadcasting station, to be
started Jan. 6, 1947, on a two-month experimental basis, was
announced today by President Donald B. Tresidder.
The station, which will be audible in Stanford Village and
five of the university's major housing units, will be financed for
the trial period through a $1,500 university appropriation.
"Because of the educational possibilities which arc evident
in such a project, it has been decided that this is something
which the university should sponsor in order to determine
whether or not a permanent and more elaborate program should
be undertaken as an additional educational opportunity for stu
dents at Stanford," Dr. Tresidder stated.
"In a very real sense, the radio station should serve as a
laboratory for the training of students and thereby becomes a
part of the educational program of the university."

Only Stanford Hears
Peninsula residents will not be able to hear the station since
it will operate on a "carrier-current" transmission system in
which radio energy is sent through house wiring rather than
sent out from transmission towers.
During the experimental period, the station will utilize radio
facilities at Memorial Hall, campus auditorium and theater, and

I at Stanford Village. Broadcasts will be made from both the hall
and the Village.
A program line will be run to Encina and Toyon halls, moil's
housing units, and to Branner Hall, women's residence. One
rebroadcasting transmitter will serve these buildings. Another
transmitter will serve housing units at Stanford Village. Another
program line will be run to Roble Hall and Lagunita Court, wo
men's residences, where a third transmitter will bo located.
(loimnittee Appointed
Dr. Tresidder said that a committee of three faculty and ad
ministrative representatives and of three students, the latter to
be selected from nominations made by the Associated Students,
will be appointed to aid in establishment of the station and to
co-operate in the development of programs.
Plans for the campus station were made by a faculty-student
committee composed of Professor Hubert C. Heffner, chairman,
executive head of the Department of Speech and Drama; David
E. Faville, professor of marketing in the Graduate School of Busi
i ness; Thorns P. Carpenter, general secretary of the university;
and Robert Collins, William Eilers, and Robert E. Heller, repre
senting the students.
Professor Hugh H. Skilling of the Electrical Engineering De
partment was technical consultant of the committee.
Heller, Eilers, and Robert E. Peck were the students who con

ducted the research in engineering, advertising and program
ming for presentation to the committee.
New Instructor Will Help
Dr. Tresidder said that it is anticipated that John V. Zuckei
man, who will join the Stanford faculty Jan. 1 as director of the
Stanford Radio Workshop and Audio-Visual Aids Program, will
be able to be of great assistance to the campus station. Mr.
Zuckerman at present is chief of the Armed Forces short-wave
operations at Los Angeles and has had wide experience in radio
work.
Establishment of the radio station has been facilitated by the
loan of a central control board from the National Broadcasting
Company.
Report Due After Trial Period
At the end of the two-month trial period, Dr. Tresidder stated,
the student-faculty committee which is to be appointed will make
recommendations on the feasibility of making the radio station
a permanent program, to provide training for students in til© field
of broadcasting.
Students living in the five major housing units and at Stan
ford Village will be able to tune in on the station by setting their
radio dials on a wave length which will be announced later,
Professor Heffner announced.

in such a project, it has been decided that this is something
which the university should sponsor in order to determine
whether or not a permanent and more elaborate program should
be undertaken as an additional educational opportunity for stu
dents at Stanford," Dr. Tresidder stated.
"In a very real sense, the radio station should serve as a
laboratory for the training of students and thereby becomes a
part of the educational program of the university."

Only Stanford Hears
Peninsula residents will not be able to hear the station since
it will operate on a "carrier-current" transmission system in
which radio energy is sent through house wiring rather than
sent out from transmission towers.
During the experimental period, the station will utilize radio
facilities at Memorial Hall, campus auditorium and theater, and

I at Stanford Village. Broadcasts will be made from both the hall
and the Village.
A program line will be run to Encina and Toyon halls, moil's
housing units, and to Branner Hall, women's residence. One
rebroadcasting transmitter will serve these buildings. Another
transmitter will serve housing units at Stanford Village. Another
program line will be run to Roble Hall and Lagunita Court, wo
men's residences, where a third transmitter will bo located.
(loimnittee Appointed
Dr. Tresidder said that a committee of three faculty and ad
ministrative representatives and of three students, the latter to
be selected from nominations made by the Associated Students,
will be appointed to aid in establishment of the station and to
co-operate in the development of programs.
Plans for the campus station were made by a faculty-student
committee composed of Professor Hubert C. Heffner, chairman,
executive head of the Department of Speech and Drama; David
E. Faville, professor of marketing in the Graduate School of Busi
i ness; Thorns P. Carpenter, general secretary of the university;
and Robert Collins, William Eilers, and Robert E. Heller, repre
senting the students.
Professor Hugh H. Skilling of the Electrical Engineering De
partment was technical consultant of the committee.
Heller, Eilers, and Robert E. Peck were the students who con

ducted the research in engineering, advertising and program
ming for presentation to the committee.
New Instructor Will Help
Dr. Tresidder said that it is anticipated that John V. Zuckei
man, who will join the Stanford faculty Jan. 1 as director of the
Stanford Radio Workshop and Audio-Visual Aids Program, will
be able to be of great assistance to the campus station. Mr.
Zuckerman at present is chief of the Armed Forces short-wave
operations at Los Angeles and has had wide experience in radio
work.
Establishment of the radio station has been facilitated by the
loan of a central control board from the National Broadcasting
Company.
Report Due After Trial Period
At the end of the two-month trial period, Dr. Tresidder stated,
the student-faculty committee which is to be appointed will make
recommendations on the feasibility of making the radio station
a permanent program, to provide training for students in til© field
of broadcasting.
Students living in the five major housing units and at Stan
ford Village will be able to tune in on the station by setting their
radio dials on a wave length which will be announced later,
Professor Heffner announced.
Approval of plans for a campus broadcasting station, to be
started Jan. 6, 1947, on a two-month experimental basis, was
announced today by President Donald B. Tresidder.
The station, which will be audible in Stanford Village and
five of the university's major housing units, will be financed for
the trial period through a $1,500 university appropriation.
"Because of the educational possibilities which arc evident
in such a project, it has been decided that this is something
which the university should sponsor in order to determine
whether or not a permanent and more elaborate program should
be undertaken as an additional educational opportunity for stu
dents at Stanford," Dr. Tresidder stated.
