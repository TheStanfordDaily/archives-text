## 
### 
Doodles Weaver, noted comedian and Stanford alumnus, guest-starred
last night on the premier broadcast of KSU. the Stanford student-oper- j
a ted station.
With a full house witnessing the comedy revue from the Memorial j
Auditorium, the broadcast over carrier lines reached Encina, Roble, j

Lagunita, Branner, and Stanford
Village.
Weaver's routines included a re
cap of college - day antics. Other
skits starred Professor Georges Le
maitre, Ray Hammett, assistant
football coach, and Bones Hamilton,
Vow Boy gridder.
RECEPTION GOOD
Reception on the station, which
was built during the Christmas hol
idays, was reported very clear. No
difference was noted between clear
channel stations and KSU. which
operates on specially Constructed
carrier lines.
Bill Eiiers, program director, di
rected this first broadcast, and the
script was written by A. Barney
Gugel, former Chaparral editor.
KSU's station orchestra, Howard
Martin and his "Melody Masters,"
provided the music for the show.
MUSIC AND SPORTS
Besides the feature broadcast
from the stage of Memorial Audito
rium, other shows aired last night
included a transcribed musical se
ries entiteld "Music to Study By."
Another feature was a 15-minute
sports commentary by Art Levin
son, KSU sports director.
Bob Heller, graduate communi
cations engineer, and former KARM
engineer, manages the station lo
cated at the Village. Bill Eiiers, a
former CBS news analyst, is pro
gram director, and Bob Peck is ad
vertising director.
ADVERTISING LATER
Approval for the operation of
KSU was given late last quarter
by the Stanford Administration,
along with a $1,500 loan to buy
basic equipment. Advertising will
pay for future equipment, but no
advertising will be solicited for at
least two weeks, according to Peck.
A greatly increased staff will be
needed, Bob Heller said, and more
appointments will be made in the
near future.
PROGRAM TIMES
Located at 590 kilocycles on reg
ular radio bands, the station will
air programs Sunday through
Thursday nights from 7 to 11. After
a trial operation of two months, it
is expected that listening facilities
will be expanded to all living
groups on the campus.
