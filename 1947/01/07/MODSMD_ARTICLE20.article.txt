### 
In view of the unprecedented j
number of parking violations on
the campus during the autumn i
quarter, Stanford Police Chief Gor- |
don R. Davis yesterday called the j
attention of students to the new j
parking regulations which went into |
effect at the beginning of the cur- j
rent school year.
Chief Davis said that most of I
the violations have centered
around the reserved parking ar- :
eas which are limited to members
of the Academic Council (pro
fessors, associate professors, as
sistant professors) and others with
equivalent rating. Only automo
biles with black stickers are en
titled to park in the reserved
areas, he emphasized.
The black sticker is identical in {
design with the other three colors j
evident on all University cars. The j
red sticker indicates an automobile |
registered as property of an on- j
campus resident, cither student or |
staff member. Green stickers are j
found on cars registered from Stan- |
ford Village. Brown stickers indi- I
cate cars registered to students and j
staff members living in various J
communities outside of the Uni- |
versity proper.
Chief Davis pointed out that i
only 200 reserved parking spaces
are available on the campus to
service the 470 individuals en
titled to use them. He estimated
that there arc about 3,300 student
and faculty cars regularly oper
ating on the Stanford campus at
present.
The Stanford police chief also
wished to call the attention of new
students and new owners of cars
to campus regulations requiring
registration of motorized vehicles
with the campus police. The police
office is located in the Corporation
Yard adjacent to the stores ware
house, immediately back of the
main Union Residence.
At the time of automobile reg
istration, students should have in
their possession driver's license,
registration certificate for auto
mobile and student body card.
They will be expected to supply
the following information: local
and home addresses, make and
type of car. license number, and
state in which license was issued.
