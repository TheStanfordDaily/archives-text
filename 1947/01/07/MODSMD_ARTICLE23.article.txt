i registered yesterday. Eighty per
1 cent of the men students registered

j rush of those who did not register
I yesterday.
; ONE MIX-UP
The only serious mix-up of the
j day, yesterday, came when veterans
j having their excess funds for books
i okayed stood in the same line as
j those applying for excess funds.
Veterans who are registering today
are advised that if their reg book is
already stamped "books" on page
one, they do not have to wait,
through the long line in room 122 in
order to apply for excess funds, since

application was made last quarter.
( These veterans may go straight to
| another desk in room 122 to pick up
j their credit cards.
j The majority of the 515 new un
| dergraduate and graduate students
j who have been accepted for winter
! quarter, of whom three-fourths are
| veterans, fill vacancies as a result of
! graduations and interruption in stu-
I dents' attendance.

| another desk in room 122 to pick up
j their credit cards.
j The majority of the 515 new un
| dergraduate and graduate students
j who have been accepted for winter
! quarter, of whom three-fourths are
| veterans, fill vacancies as a result of
! graduations and interruption in stu-
I dents' attendance.
