# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Hangover 
### 
.... of a few things that even the EDITORS
weren't able to get into The Daily what with
the shortage of last-day publishing space. A
few pats on the back that we're turning into
New Year's resolutions .... we absolutely
promise to give Ellie Brill more public credit
for a rejuvenated, purposeful 'Y' program
that's 'way out front —and the same for Miss
Pat, 'Y' secretary, whose cheerful, encourag
ing leadership goes a lot deeper into campus
life than you think . . ditto for Caiol Kellogg
of Women's Council (the new late-leave regu
lations, we think, show a pretty enlightening
attitude concerning the Stanford woman's abil
ity to take responsibility)
We also resolve to give Rally Com credit
when credit is due (like for the fine job Dave
Heyler did with tne cnrd stunts at the Big
Gc'm:) . . . criticism, when due, we hope
will be meted out fairly and with an open
mind to any and all who deserve it ... . Daily
photographers will hereafter emerge from

their limbo-like obscurity with credit lines un
der their photos in the paper .... we will give
Student Manager Joan McDonough public ap
plause for doing a terrific job of supporting
and protecting student rights
We expect to hold forth for and back up
bettei student-faculty relations . . . . A S.S.U.
efforts to compile an activity file, and to publi
cize and co-ordinale all activities so that every
one can have a "chance to do his bit .... a
deeper sense of responsibility among so-call
ed leaders in student government .... the
Stanford International Survey which is seek
ing to promote international understanding
through a student travel fund and exchange
scholarships.
We will oppose extension of University
authority into what is rightfully student terri
tory by the only means we know: insistence
on active student interest and participation in
student affairs and on conduct worthy of the
rights students seek to keep.—M.S.
