# KSU—Bon Voyage
## 
### 
"Doodles didn't diddle-daddle"—and neith
er did the complete cast of announcers, musi
cians, actors, and technicians who inaugurated
KSU last night on the Stanford air waves. That
stjudents could put on a show with profes
sional polish and enough enthusiasm to cover
up the rough spots was hugely gratifying to
those who have worried and plugged and an
ticipated the station's opening.
The Daily will ignore all those timid souls
who warn that newswise the station will be
stealing our stuff. We are giving it to them,
in the belief that by helping each other, both
of us will attain higher standards. In every
possible way, we're going to plug KSU as an
area of training, responsibility, and worth
while student activity—it will mean a great
deal to every person on campus if the station
is a success.
Student publications, conversations, and
dramatic productions too often reflect a genial
moral indifference. Here's hoping the radio
station, as a most potent force for leadership
will not be satisfied by the borderline, but
will aim high, and stay high. That in itself
will be a tough job.

We hope, too, that the "co-ordination" of
the University's Radio Workshop and the sta
tion, under Mr. John Zuckerman, will volun
tarily become a true co-operative enterprise,
so that the student station can eventually and
naturally untie itself from any suspicious or
restrictive topside control. Only superior pro
grams will be proof of the station's worth, so
whatever help the Workshop can give is to
be appreciated, rather than avoided as a
means of being violently independent.
Station moguls aren't worried about being
financially self-operating, so their future, we
repeat, depends entirely upon the content of
programs. We have a statement from the Uni
versity's official news release that the final
management arrangements of the station will
be made at the end of a two-month trial period.
From the quality of last night's program, the
natural growth to come in experience, and the
mature programs planned for the future, we
are confident that the station is well on the
way toward taking its rightful place in student
extra-curriculum. Nice going, Bill Eilers and
company—and bon voyage.

Student publications, conversations, and
dramatic productions too often reflect a genial
moral indifference. Here's hoping the radio
station, as a most potent force for leadership
will not be satisfied by the borderline, but
will aim high, and stay high. That in itself
will be a tough job.

We hope, too, that the "co-ordination" of
the University's Radio Workshop and the sta
tion, under Mr. John Zuckerman, will volun
tarily become a true co-operative enterprise,
so that the student station can eventually and
naturally untie itself from any suspicious or
restrictive topside control. Only superior pro
grams will be proof of the station's worth, so
whatever help the Workshop can give is to
be appreciated, rather than avoided as a
means of being violently independent.
Station moguls aren't worried about being
financially self-operating, so their future, we
repeat, depends entirely upon the content of
programs. We have a statement from the Uni
versity's official news release that the final
management arrangements of the station will
be made at the end of a two-month trial period.
From the quality of last night's program, the
natural growth to come in experience, and the
mature programs planned for the future, we
are confident that the station is well on the
way toward taking its rightful place in student
extra-curriculum. Nice going, Bill Eilers and
company—and bon voyage.
