Right off there ought to be a story on regis
tration, so ... . seems that this fellow got up
real early yesterday morning to avoid the rush
down at the Registration Building. He got
there while the line was short all right and
everything seemed to be working out fine.
One trouble!
His name began with "W" and he hadn't
heard of the new system yet. The officer at
the door told him to come back later . . . way
later, that is. Better yet he shoulda stood in
bed!
For those of you who might some day like
to iget your hands on him, the name of the
new telephone operator at Toyon 3121 is Bob
Totman. .
"Last guarter it wasn't so bad," he tells us.
'â€¢'Now everybody knows everybody and so
everybody phones everybody!" With five
switchboards maybe they could handle the
traffic, he figures, but the one board they have
is taking a beating.
It got so last guarter whenever you asked
anyone what the chances were of getting a
new board, people just laughed and walked
off. I asked again. Totman laughed and
walked off.
Those of you who listened to the local sta
tion last night know most of the facts about
the Doodles Weaver trip to L.A. via taxi.
Well, anyway, Doodles gave the program
director the hopping jangles last night. The
day went by and by and by and time for the
broadcast got closer and etc. And no Doodles.
If you didn't listen in to find out if he made it,
you're out of luck; I'm not going to tell! You
should tune in, fella.

Taxi's aren't so depen4able these days, any
way.
One more reg story: This veteran got in the
seat card line and waited for about four hours.
Getting up to the window, he learned that up
per division students don't need seat cards.
Oh, well, it's better than standing in line for
four hours with a raincoat and spoon, huh,
chum?
The Eating Club members are happy. The
administration assigned one of the larger din
ing rooms in Encina Commons to them. Last
guarter the clubs reached a point where each
table had to appoint a breath leader. Members
were given numbers and on the leader's sig
nal the odd numbers would inhale and the
even would exhale.
You think I'm kidding?!
One of Stanford's coeds got a job selling
perfume at a department store during the
vacation. She was doing fine until a rather
embarrassed looking male came up to the
counter and asked for something "really
good."
The young lady had been reading Reid's
"Theory of Value," but didn't remember any
thing about perfume in it, so she called the
head of the department. The customer was
taken care of and our coed got a guick lesson
in value of perfumes. It's all worked out on
a scale she tells us. The more dollars per
ounce, the better the perfume . . . "and don't
tell ME the nose knows!"
Something that has me a little worried now
that I've thought it over is the statement by a
pretty, young thing that her new philosophy
of life is based on the mystery novels she
read during the vacation. That's all. You fig
ure it out.
