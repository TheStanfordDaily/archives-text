# "Notorious" Notorious
## 
### 
Some night this week when the
heating system in your barracks or
boudoir flubs out and you haven't
got even a mildly tepid date, drop
inlet the Stanford Theater to see
"Notorious," the theory that
one scene about halfway through
the epic will take ihe chill oft even
the Daily coke machine.
Th'.» scene is a Hollywood apart
ment in Rio where Gary Grant and
Ingrid Bergman are established in
what promises to be a slick shack
up paid for by the FBI, in whose
employ our principals find them
selves. The action is a jet-propelled
clinch which takes off from the bal
cony, spirals into a telephone con
versation in the living room and
zooms out the front door.
THREE-MINUTE SMOOCII
Sounds easy, but during this one
long shot — running about three
minutes—the mouths of the luscious
Ingrid and the stolid Cary are never
farther apart than a highly unsani
tary two inches. But the great dis
appointment of the scene is when
get - away time comes for Cary,
They do a slow three-legged race
over to the door, rub noses, and
out he goes. The wretch doesn't
even kiss her goodbye alter all that,
which is, I suppose, a frustrating
manifestation of the Hitchcock sus
pense technique.
That scene is the cleverest of a
number of scenes which were past
ed together to make the movie, but
the depressing part of the affair is
that while most of the individual
sequences are well done, they don't
add up to a cohesive whole. Hitch
cock and Ben Hecht, who collabo
rated on the scenario, did not
achieve the total effect which the
drama could have had. To misquote
some philosopher, the whole was
not greater than the sum of its
parts, which it should have been.
HORDE OF NASTIES
However, the usual horde of un
usual nasties whom Hitchcock near
ly always works into his efforts are
present with the characterization of
the nastiest of them all being mag
nificently handled by a newcomer
to Hollywood. Her name is Ma
dame Konstantin and if she man
ages to stick it out in the southern
Sensation City a lot of movies will
be better because of it.
Claude Rains wiggles his eye
brows and employs his soft, gravel
voice convincingly enough to make
you hate him and still feel sorry
for him in a curious admixture of
his old "heavy" parts and his more
recent roles of benign old gentle
men. Not to mention Caesar.
But like we said, if it's a cold wet
night, drop in and get toasted down
to your tootsies by the carryings-on
of Bergman and Grant. You might
even stick around to see that one
scene a second time. We did.—

not greater than the sum of its
parts, which it should have been.
HORDE OF NASTIES
However, the usual horde of un
usual nasties whom Hitchcock near
ly always works into his efforts are
present with the characterization of
the nastiest of them all being mag
nificently handled by a newcomer
to Hollywood. Her name is Ma
dame Konstantin and if she man
ages to stick it out in the southern
Sensation City a lot of movies will
be better because of it.
Claude Rains wiggles his eye
brows and employs his soft, gravel
voice convincingly enough to make
you hate him and still feel sorry
for him in a curious admixture of
his old "heavy" parts and his more
recent roles of benign old gentle
men. Not to mention Caesar.
But like we said, if it's a cold wet
night, drop in and get toasted down
to your tootsies by the carryings-on
of Bergman and Grant. You might
even stick around to see that one
scene a second time. We did.—
George Moore
Some night this week when the
heating system in your barracks or
boudoir flubs out and you haven't
got even a mildly tepid date, drop
inlet the Stanford Theater to see
"Notorious," the theory that
one scene about halfway through
the epic will take ihe chill oft even
the Daily coke machine.
Th'.» scene is a Hollywood apart
ment in Rio where Gary Grant and
Ingrid Bergman are established in
what promises to be a slick shack
up paid for by the FBI, in whose
employ our principals find them
selves. The action is a jet-propelled
clinch which takes off from the bal
cony, spirals into a telephone con
versation in the living room and
zooms out the front door.
THREE-MINUTE SMOOCII
Sounds easy, but during this one
long shot — running about three
minutes—the mouths of the luscious
Ingrid and the stolid Cary are never
farther apart than a highly unsani
tary two inches. But the great dis
appointment of the scene is when
get - away time comes for Cary,
They do a slow three-legged race
over to the door, rub noses, and
out he goes. The wretch doesn't
even kiss her goodbye alter all that,
which is, I suppose, a frustrating
manifestation of the Hitchcock sus
pense technique.
That scene is the cleverest of a
number of scenes which were past
ed together to make the movie, but
the depressing part of the affair is
that while most of the individual
sequences are well done, they don't
add up to a cohesive whole. Hitch
cock and Ben Hecht, who collabo
rated on the scenario, did not
achieve the total effect which the
drama could have had. To misquote
some philosopher, the whole was
not greater than the sum of its
parts, which it should have been.
