Stone Cold I)ea<! in the Rose Itowl; Or
Murder by Any Other Name Is Slill Messy
It was cold, premeditated murder; there's no other name for it. What
the Illini did to the Bruins in Pasadena, I mean. Never was one team so
hot, the other so cold. The erstwhile mighty Uclans were not even vaguely
reminiscent of the squad that manhandled Oregon State, throttled Wash
ington, scalped Stanford, and pulverized St. Mary's. A good—not great—
Illinois team looked like the greatest aggregation of stars that ever donned
moleskins.
As usual, the story of the game is told in the line play. If Ucla's
forward wall did any blocking or tackling at all, throughout the entire
afternoon, it was not apparent from the press box. The final result was
a triumph for solid, fundamental football—hard hlockingand hard tack
ling. Fancy stuff is nice, but it seems the too-often despised funda
mentals are still prime requisites.
The Agase brothers Alex and Lou —lived up to advance billing. They
opened holes in the enemy line so wide that Buddy Young slashed through
without being touched. They also made possible the devastating smashes
of Julie Rykovich. who had a day Doc Blanchard might well be proud of.
The freres Agase hit so hard they literally knocked themselves out—
more than once —but, after a short breather on the bench, they'd be back,
breathing fire and brimstone. That's no joke, son; the Bruins undoubt
edly thought they were in Hell—or at least a hell of a place.
Of Mortuaries and Appendices
Capt. Max Wenskunas- supposedly a candidate for a marble mortuary
slab with a recalcitrant appendix —was perhaps the liveliest ghost on the
field as he dominated defensive play from his center position. Don Paul
of U.C.L.A. is a fine center, but he was completely overshadowed by the
allegedly ailing Illinois lad.
And so it went, all down the line. At no point were the California
boys able to match the hellions from the Mid-West. Even Ail-American
Burr Baldwin spent a very unhappy afternoon; best end on the field
was a colored boy named Owens from—that's right—lllinois. The Burr
afterward revealed that he was under orders not to charge that works
against some teams, but not the Illini. Laßruchcrie was of course wor
ried about Buddy Young's end sweeps—and well he might be —but in
guarding against them he left the door open for Kykovich's pulverizing
smashes over tackle.
It's hard to figure a game like that—so completely a reversal of form
that a saliva test seems called for—without laying oneself wide open to
charges of rationalizing. Needless to say, however, the Illinois squad was
not that good—nor was U.C.L.A. that bad. The game will have to be
listed under the "One of Those Things" Dept.
Of course the Mid-Westerners—first Western Conference invader
since the days of "Back to Normalcy"—had the perfect material for pep
talks. Unwanted by the majority of the sports writers and by the Bruins
themselves, their record was made to appear much worse than it really
was. Naturally they got sore and played the game of their lives.
Ucla W as Sailing But the Tide Went Out
The same thing held true for the Bruins, in an inverse ratio. Unde
feated and untied, masters of all they'd surveyed, they were forced into
a game they didn't really want to play. It's quite understandable that
they were caught at tide's ebb.
Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to imply the Bruins are a better
team. That would be hard to do in the face of a 45-point avalanche;
but I DO mean to say that the Bruins could put up a much better
fight than they did in the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day.
Perhaps this would be a good time to crow and say "I told you so."
Here's what Sgt. Slinger wrote last Nov. 26: "It's a Southland team that
must go into the Bowl New Year's Day with nothing to win and everything
to lose. If Westwood beats Illinois, the cardboard Big Nine champ, every
one says, 'So what?'—but if they lose they're a bunch of bums. What a
situation!' I might quote that statement if I were one to gloat over fallen
gladiators, but of course I wouldn't think of it.
If the Coast Fathers had used their heads and invited Army, things
would have been vastly different. Army undoubtedly would have won
but the Bruins, rank longshots, would have had no cause to get fat
headed. They would have played over their heads and, I'm sure, kept
the score within respectable bounds. As it was, they looked like a
bunch of equine posteriors—and they were the champs of the entire
Coast.
Kudos for the best pick of the day went to Harry Borba of the San
Francisco Examiner, who picked the score at 47 to 14 —just two points off.
The only trouble is, he tabbed the Bruins to win. That would look pretty
good in type—U.C.L.A. 47, Illinois 14. Yessir, that's right pretty. Sgt.
Slinger figured Illinois to be a little tougher—say about 47 to 19. Oh, well,
as Confucius once said, you can't win em all.
li s INol So Tough in the Islands
Never Say Die Dept.: Ernie Case and some other Ucla seniors winged
across to Hawaii for a post-season island campaign. The boys walloped
the Leilehua Alumni 34 to 7. With monumental disregard for the facts,
they blled themselves as the Rose Bowl Stars.
While I have you over in Hawaii. I might as well mention our own
Mud Bath Bowl. Usually sunny Hawaii pulled a nasty trick and the
game, after one postponement, was played under weeping skies. Both
teams looked like Sepia Swimmers or—as Marty Feldman puts it—
fugitives from a minstrel show.
At the final gun Stanford had out-natated the Hawyiians by a score of
18 to 7, and Marty Anderson had put on quite a show for his home folks.
Jim Cox. again in good health, played about half the game. The climax
was reached when Bear Quist pulled a Bobby Anderson play around the
end for a touchdown. The enemy was completely befuddled and the lum
bersome towhead just dog-trotted across.
