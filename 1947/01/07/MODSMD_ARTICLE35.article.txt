ference of conferences today recommended a five-plank platform

Aimed at tightening definitions of amateurism and standard-

izing eligibility rules, the five prin- H
ciples included a comprehensive de
scription of ctiriateurism; institutional
control and responsibility; need of
sound academic standards; tight
control of financial aid to athletes
and the matter of recruiting players.
The conference emphasized the
necessity of "a firm agreement by 1
institutions which accept these prin
ciples," which will be actcd upon at |
a joint meeting of the NCAA Wed- ,
nesday.
"They must confine their inter
collegiate competition to contests
with institutions which avow the
same principles and conduct their

tive," the' conference stated.

nition.
2. Institutional control and re- j
sponsibility: The control and respon
sibility for conduct of both intercol
legiate and intramural athletics

ceed tuition and-or stated fees ex
cept when total aid awarded is es
tablished by governmental grant
