A fine athlete, an excellent stu
dent and a splendid example of
all that is best in the Stanford
scene will be missed in the days
to come.
Dave DeSwarte, 21) - year - old
sophomore football ami track star
and a potential Phi Beta Kappa,
was buried last week at Wilniette,
111. The tail, good-looking young
ster, a member of the Beta Theta
I'i fraternity, was instantly killed
the day after New Year's when
be was bit by a train at a grade
crossing in his home town.
Not because he was a line ath
lete—there are many of them—
nor because he was an excellent
student—there are many of them
—but because he was a swell guy
with a brilliant future before
him, we say he will be missed.
So long, kid.
