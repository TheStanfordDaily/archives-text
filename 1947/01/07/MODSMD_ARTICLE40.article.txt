# Cagers Open League Play This Weekend at UCLA
## 
### 
Stanford's cagers, with a none-too-successful road trip to the
Midwest behind them, fixed their sights on another target for
this week-end when they journey south to wrassle UCLA's
Bruins in a Southern Division PCC twinbill Friday and Saturday
nights.»
The Bruins, paced by Don Barksdale and Davage Minor, have

had trouble rounding into shape so
far, their Eastern swing being a sad
tale and their home stands to date
likewise being a slight disappoint
ment for a squad loaded with indi
vidual brilliants.
However, no matter how far down
you grind the Bruins, they must still
be considered the better club in this
series. The Indians will have the
same trouble on the hardwood they
had on the gridiron—lots of effort,
but little experience.
They're green, so green that only
Bolt Lewis, Babe Biggins and Bill
Christiansen tin the varsity have
ever played varsity ball before. All
the rest, center Bill Stephenson,
forward .Morley Thompson, guards
Dick Berlin and Captain Dave Da
vidson. of the starters are playing
their tirst season on a varsity.
These four green peas, and Higgins
are the probable starting lineup—
unless they get worse or somebody
gets better. They handle themselves
well on a court, are sharp under the
backboard, and know what to do
with the ball.
Despite their record of 4 wins and
3 losses (one won on the road), a
play-by-play chart of their games
shows them to have been in all their

games until the closing minutes.
Take any green team, put 'em a few
points behind with a couple of min
utes to go, and then start counting
the mistakes they make as they press
for the ball.
So the Tribe took it on the chin,
Michigan won, 45-37; Michigan
State, 57-45; Bradley Tech, 56-51;
Mainline 33-26; Kansas, 54-52; Den
ver. 48-47. Only Carleton fell before
the Cards, 54-41. So far this season
the Farm has tallied 566 points to
558 against, giving them an average
of 17.2 to 46.5. (Figures courtesy of
SAC News Director Don E. Lieben
dorfer.)
The top individual scorers are
Stephenson. 144; Davidson, 117;
Thompson. 7!!: Berlin, 48; lliggins,
48; Lewis. 154; Chavalas. 31; Dro
hohl, 31.
Incidentally, ticket sales for the
first Cal series January 17 and 18,
will be Tuesday the 14th. starting at
8:30 a.m. Better get your ducats
early, there's just too many of us
to get into the pavilion all at once
and still have room enough for a
basketball game.

Stanford's cagers, with a none-too-successful road trip to the
Midwest behind them, fixed their sights on another target for
this week-end when they journey south to wrassle UCLA's
Bruins in a Southern Division PCC twinbill Friday and Saturday
nights.»
The Bruins, paced by Don Barksdale and Davage Minor, have

had trouble rounding into shape so
far, their Eastern swing being a sad
tale and their home stands to date
likewise being a slight disappoint
ment for a squad loaded with indi
vidual brilliants.
However, no matter how far down
you grind the Bruins, they must still
be considered the better club in this
series. The Indians will have the
same trouble on the hardwood they
had on the gridiron—lots of effort,
but little experience.
They're green, so green that only
Bolt Lewis, Babe Biggins and Bill
Christiansen tin the varsity have
ever played varsity ball before. All
the rest, center Bill Stephenson,
forward .Morley Thompson, guards
Dick Berlin and Captain Dave Da
vidson. of the starters are playing
their tirst season on a varsity.
These four green peas, and Higgins
are the probable starting lineup—
unless they get worse or somebody
gets better. They handle themselves
well on a court, are sharp under the
backboard, and know what to do
with the ball.
Despite their record of 4 wins and
3 losses (one won on the road), a
play-by-play chart of their games
shows them to have been in all their

games until the closing minutes.
Take any green team, put 'em a few
points behind with a couple of min
utes to go, and then start counting
the mistakes they make as they press
for the ball.
So the Tribe took it on the chin,
Michigan won, 45-37; Michigan
State, 57-45; Bradley Tech, 56-51;
Mainline 33-26; Kansas, 54-52; Den

the Cards, 54-41. So far this season
the Farm has tallied 566 points to
558 against, giving them an average
of 17.2 to 46.5. (Figures courtesy of
