# Rubber Project Given Stanford
## 
### 
Stanford University has received
a grant of approximately $150,000
from the Office of Naval Research
for an eight-month research project
on natural rubber, it was an
nounced yest nday by Dr. Donald B.
Tresidder, University President.
The project, to be carried on at
Salinas and in the University's lab
oratories, will be administered by
the newly established Stanford Re
search Institute.
Dr. William F. Talbot, director of
the institute, explained that the aim
of the research program will be to
develop sturdier, more productive
rubber - yielding plants than can
now be grown in the United States
so th&t, in the event of another na
tional emergency, the country will
not be caught short of potential nat
ural rubber supplies.
Dr. Talbot said that the Research
Institute's objective will be to de
velop, through studies of giiayule
and other plants, new types of
plants which will give such a large
yield of rubber that they could, if
necessary, meet the country's need
for natural rubber without inter
fering with its food economy.
