# So Tax Cuts; Armament; Labor Legislation: Truman
##

u
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 (UP). —President Truman today asked
the Republican 80th Congress to prohibit unjustified strikes by
legislating compulsory arbitration, to refrain from cutting taxes
at the expense of national debt reduction, and to guard against
hasty, premature disarmament.

The 20th President to face an
opposition Senate or House or
both, Mr. Truman told a joint ses
sion that ' if the country is to
achieve "a state of well-being"
among its own people as well as
those of other nations, "the Con
gress and the President during the
next two years, must work to
gether."
Unless ihey do, he said in his per
sonally delivered, 6,000-word, state
of the union message which put la
bor-management problems at the
top of his legislative program, "we
shall be risking the nation's safety
and destroying our opportunities for
progress."
But despite this plea for unity,
the President humped immediately
into firm Republican opposition to
his all-embracing domestic and
foreign program, which lie said
was designed to bring about "col
lective security for all mankind."
A quick survey among prominent
GOP Senate and House members,
made while the chief executive's ad
dress was being broadcast to the
country—and for the first time by
television—from the crowded, Kleig
lighted House chamber, showed that
many viewed the program as too
general and merely a re-hash of ear
lier White House pronouncements.
The President served notice that
his budget plans leave no margin
for the multi-billion-dollar tax
cuts promised by the GOP in the
194(5 election campaign.
In his message to Congress, the
President ran up a clear danger sig
nal to the GOP bloc led by Rep. Har
old Knutson, R-Minn, which has
pledged itself to cut 1947 income
taxes 20 per cent on incomes up to
$300,000 a year.
Mr. Truman said he intends to
give the nation a balanced budget
for the next fiscal year, and he made
it clear that any budgetary surpluses
should be used for reducing the na
tional debt rather than cutting taxes.
At the same time, he asked for
legislation to continue until June 30,
1948, the wartime excise tax rates
which are scheduled to expire next
June.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 (UP).—
President Truman told Congress to
day that the United States will not
disarm until the United Nations'
system of collective security has
been established.
"We live in a world in which
strength on the part of the peace
loving nations is still the greatest
deterrent to aggression," he said in
the foreign-policy section of his
message on the state of the union.
"This is an age when an unfore
seen attack could come with un
precedented speed. We must be
strong enough to defeat, and thus
to forestall any such attack."
The President said this country
would be willing to take the lead in
"collective disarmament" as soon as
the United Nations organization is
equipped to maintain the peace,
lie did not go into detail on
American atomic policy, but he
linked it to military policy and in
dicated strongly that the same the
sis of no disarmament without col
lective security holds good for this
country's atomic secrets and bomb
stockpiles.
The President warned that Ameri
can military forces are barely suffi
cient to meet the obligations involv
ed in the nation's foreign policy and
he hinted that the army may ask for
a resumption of the draft if the cur
rent drive for volunteers falls short.
He said the differences which have
arisen between this country and
Russia "should not be allowed to ob
scure the fact that ihe basic interests
of both nations lie in ihe early mak
ing of a peace under which the peo
ples of all counlries may return, as
free men and women, to the essen
tial tasks of production and recon
struction.

sonally delivered, 6,000-word, state
of the union message which put la
bor-management problems at the
top of his legislative program, "we

and destroying our opportunities for
progress."
But despite this plea for unity,
the President humped immediately
into firm Republican opposition to
his all-embracing domestic and
foreign program, which lie said
was designed to bring about "col
lective security for all mankind."
A quick survey among prominent
GOP Senate and House members,
made while the chief executive's ad

general and merely a re-hash of ear
lier White House pronouncements.
The President served notice that
his budget plans leave no margin
for the multi-billion-dollar tax
cuts promised by the GOP in the
194(5 election campaign.
In his message to Congress, the
President ran up a clear danger sig
nal to the GOP bloc led by Rep. Har
old Knutson, R-Minn, which has
pledged itself to cut 1947 income
taxes 20 per cent on incomes up to
$300,000 a year.
Mr. Truman said he intends to
give the nation a balanced budget
for the next fiscal year, and he made
it clear that any budgetary surpluses
should be used for reducing the na
tional debt rather than cutting taxes.
At the same time, he asked for
legislation to continue until June 30,
1948, the wartime excise tax rates
which are scheduled to expire next
June.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 (UP).—
President Truman told Congress to
day that the United States will not
disarm until the United Nations'
system of collective security has
been established.
"We live in a world in which
strength on the part of the peace
loving nations is still the greatest
deterrent to aggression," he said in
the foreign-policy section of his
message on the state of the union.
"This is an age when an unfore
seen attack could come with un
precedented speed. We must be
strong enough to defeat, and thus
to forestall any such attack."
The President said this country
would be willing to take the lead in
"collective disarmament" as soon as
the United Nations organization is
equipped to maintain the peace,
lie did not go into detail on
American atomic policy, but he
linked it to military policy and in
dicated strongly that the same the
sis of no disarmament without col
lective security holds good for this
country's atomic secrets and bomb
stockpiles.
The President warned that Ameri
can military forces are barely suffi
cient to meet the obligations involv
ed in the nation's foreign policy and
he hinted that the army may ask for
a resumption of the draft if the cur
rent drive for volunteers falls short.
He said the differences which have
arisen between this country and
Russia "should not be allowed to ob
scure the fact that ihe basic interests
of both nations lie in ihe early mak
ing of a peace under which the peo
ples of all counlries may return, as
