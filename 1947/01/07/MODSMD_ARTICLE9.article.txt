# Gen. Marshall Recalled For China Report
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 (UP).â€”
President Truman tonight re
called Gen. George C. Marshall
from China to report "in person"
on the critical situation there.
The former Army Chief of Stall",
who has been the President's per
sonal peace emissary in China for
a year, is expected to leave Nan
king by plane tomorrow.
American officials have nothing
hut praise for the work Marshall
has done in China, although his
main objective, the establishing
of peace between the Communists
and the Nationalists, has not been
achieved.
These officials insist that it is
China which has failed rather
than Marshall. The general, they
say, has done everything humanly
possible to help China's warring
political factions reconcile their
differences.
Marshall's recall set in motion
plans to review the entire Far
Eastern situation, especially Uni
ted States relations with China
and the Soviet Union in that area.
A few hours before the White
House announcement the State
Department announced dispatch
of firm notes to Soviet Russia and
China about the failure to reopen
Daircn, Manchuria, as a free port
and to eliminate Soviet military
control.
