# Two Stanford Men, Dews, Tatum, Win 1947 Rhodes Scholarships to Oxford
## 
### 
Two Stanford men have cleared j
the last hurdle that stood between i
them and coveted Rhodes Scholar- I
ship awards to Oxford University, j
England. They are Frank D. Tatum, j
Jr., Los Angeles, and O. Edmund j
Dews, Ashland, Ore. It is the first 1
record in Stanford's annals of two
candidates having been appointed
from here in one year.
The appointment of the two men
was made known Dec. 19 by Dr.
Frank Aydelotte, American secre
tary to the Rhodes trustees, when
he released the names of the 48 men
selected from the United States for
scholarships. Both Tatum and Dews
were chosen on the basis of their I
scholastic standings, extracurricular j
activities, and war service records, j
The men will take up residence
at Oxford in October of this year,
where they are assured of at least
two years' study in fields of their
choice. A third year at whatever
university they desire is also made
possible by the scholarship, which j
provides an annual stipend of $1,700 i
to each student.
BOTH PHI BETES
Tatum, who was nominated by
the California Rhodes committee, is
a first-year law student at Stan
ford. He earned a degree in engi
neering in 1942, became a Phi Beta
Kappa. was intercollegiate golf
champion, and a member of the In
terfraternity Board of Control. He
intends to study law at Oxford and
use his engineering knowledge in
future work as a patent lawyer.
Dews was nominated by the Ore
gon committee, his residence as a
teacher at Oregon State College at
Ashland placing him under their
jurisdiction. He too was a Phi Beta
Kappa at Stanford, was prominent
in international relations groups, j
and did considerable independent j
study. His work in the Army Air j
Corps as a meteorologist gave him
scientific training which he intends
to combine with a study of modern
history at Oxford preparatory to
entering the field of history of sci
ence.
BOTH OVER AGE
Since both men are over the nor- i

| mal ape considered for Rhodes
| Scholarships — Tatum is 26; Daws,
I 25 — they could not have received
| the award had it not been for their
j war service, which permits an age
j extension to 31 years for 1946 can
| didates.
Next selection of Rhodes candi
dates will be made next October.
Philip W. Buck, political science
professor, who is the Stanford rep
resentative for the Rhodes commit
tee, urges all interested men to con
fer with him as soon as possible in
order that their preparations may
conform to the requirements neces
sary for scholarships.

Two Stanford men have cleared j
the last hurdle that stood between i
them and coveted Rhodes Scholar- I
ship awards to Oxford University, j
England. They are Frank D. Tatum, j
Jr., Los Angeles, and O. Edmund j
Dews, Ashland, Ore. It is the first 1
record in Stanford's annals of two
candidates having been appointed
from here in one year.
The appointment of the two men
was made known Dec. 19 by Dr.
Frank Aydelotte, American secre
tary to the Rhodes trustees, when
he released the names of the 48 men
selected from the United States for
scholarships. Both Tatum and Dews
were chosen on the basis of their I
scholastic standings, extracurricular j
activities, and war service records, j
The men will take up residence
at Oxford in October of this year,
where they are assured of at least
two years' study in fields of their
choice. A third year at whatever
university they desire is also made
possible by the scholarship, which j
provides an annual stipend of $1,700 i
to each student.
BOTH PHI BETES
Tatum, who was nominated by
the California Rhodes committee, is
a first-year law student at Stan
ford. He earned a degree in engi
neering in 1942, became a Phi Beta
Kappa. was intercollegiate golf
champion, and a member of the In
terfraternity Board of Control. He
intends to study law at Oxford and
use his engineering knowledge in
future work as a patent lawyer.
Dews was nominated by the Ore
gon committee, his residence as a
teacher at Oregon State College at
Ashland placing him under their
jurisdiction. He too was a Phi Beta
Kappa at Stanford, was prominent
in international relations groups, j
and did considerable independent j
study. His work in the Army Air j
Corps as a meteorologist gave him
scientific training which he intends
to combine with a study of modern
history at Oxford preparatory to
entering the field of history of sci
ence.
BOTH OVER AGE
Since both men are over the nor- i

| mal ape considered for Rhodes
| Scholarships — Tatum is 26; Daws,
I 25 — they could not have received
| the award had it not been for their
j war service, which permits an age
