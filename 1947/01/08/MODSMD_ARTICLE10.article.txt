The first West Coast production
of two Ion;; one-act plays, "John
Doe" by Bernard Dryer and "My
Heart's Â»n the Highlands" by Wil
liam Saroyan, will be presented
Jan. 15-18 in the Little Theater
by the Stanford Players.
"John Doe" is a very unusual play
of experimental nature and is said
to be one of the finest plays that
have ever been written in modern
times. It will be given in a space
setting.
"My Heart's in the Highlands"
was Saroyan's opening work that
started him on his road to success.
New talent is being featured in
these plays. Jackie Sheeley, an
eight-year-old from Palo Alto, and
Philip Laylander, a graduate stu
dent in geology, are two of these
talented new faces that will star in
the twin bill. Sheeley plays the
part of Johnnie in Saroyan's corn
ed 3', and Laylander is billed in both
plays.
Dr. B. Q. Morgan of the faculty is
one of the principals in "My Heart's
in the Highlands." and Robert So
rensen, a graduate student in the
Drama Department, plays a leading
role in "John Doe."
These plays are a part of the
Studio Theater and are directed
by a member of the faculty, I)r.
A. N. Vardac. They open their
four-day run Jan. 15.
