### 
I Stanford's registration figures fell
I below enrollment estimations last
I night when, after the second day of
j registration, the total number of
! students who signed up was 7.001.
H. Donald Winbigler, registrar
and executive secretary of the com
mittee on admissions, explained
that the registration figure fell be
low the estimated 7,500 students be
i cause members of the class of 1945
who had been drafted and hoped
to return to Stanford this quarter
had not been released from the
j service in time.
TAPE TAKES TIME
These students did not have time
i after their release from service to

I file the necessary papers to re-enter
I Stanford.
The registrar's office now expects
about the same total enrollment as
of autumn quarter 1946. By the
middle of last quarter 7,234 students
I had registered at Stanford.
This winter quarter's registration
I figure doubled the figure for the
j same quarter in 1946. At the be
ginning of winter quarter 1946,
3,073 students were registered at
Stanford.
LINES C ALM. ORDEKLY'
Yesterday's registration was calm
and orderly, according to Mr. Win
bigler.
"The initial eight o'clock line was

j cleared up in 20 minutes," said Mr.
Winbigler. "and I thought all-in-all
the registration procedure was a
: decided improvement over last
I quarter's rush. However, there will
always be a few linos that students
J have to contend with."
"Today's registration will clear
| up with the last-minute rush of
i students who have missed trains
or busses and couldn't get back to
Stanford in time, but there will still
be a fine for registering late," said
Mr. Winbigler.
Final figures for the breakdown
between upper and lower division
students have not been completed
I as-yet.
