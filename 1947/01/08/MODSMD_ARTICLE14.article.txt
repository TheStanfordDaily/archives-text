On hearing the news that Secre
tary of State Byrnes had resigned
and that President Truman had
named General George C. Marshall
as Byrnes' successor, the following
comments were made:
Graham H. Stuart, professor of
political science, said that Byrnes'
resignation at this critical time is
very unfortunate, especially in view
of his strong stand at Stuttgart,
which marked such an important
change in our foreign policy, and
his excellence and improvement in
the last six months as noted by i
Time Magazine and the Saturday
Evening Post.
Stuart also said that General
Marshall is an able man, and thai
his experience in China has given
him an idea of the Russian reac
tion.
Philip W. Buck, also a professor
of political science, commented that
there was no political reason for
Byrnes' resignation, but that it was
a matter of health. Buck said that
Marshall is a man of much expe
rience and his acceptance of the
post would mean a continuance of
the bi-partisan foreign policy.
One student said, laughing, that
Byrnes was just waiting until he
got his picture in Time magazine
before retiring.
