WASHINGTON. Jan. 7 (UP).—
Gen. George C. Marshall today de
livered a blistering "Plague on both
your houses" to China's warring
factions — Generalissimo Chiang
Kai-shek's National Government
and the Chinese Communist party—
raising strong doubts that he would
return to Nanking as President
Truman's peace envoy.
Never in recent diplomatic his
tory has an American official, while
still in his post in a foreign coun
try. issued such a bitter indictment.
He blamed "extremist elements of
both sides" for frustrating "time
and again" sincere efforts to achieve
peace, and left no douht that neither
can expect American help until
they put their houses in order.
FEUDAL CONTROL'
His blast was issued by the State
Department 15 hours after the Pres
ident had announced Marshall's re
call for a personal report. The doc
ument was labeled "a personal
I statement" and it disclosed that
I Marshall was admitting failure ot
I his 13-month mission. He leaves
! Nanking tomorrow by plane.
Marshall directed his fire without
i qualification at both sides. He said
that the "irreconcilable groups"'
within the Kuomintang party of
Chiang, which is the National Gov
ernment, were interested only in
"preservation of their own feudal
control of China."
He - charged that the "dyed in the
I wool Communists" used the most
j drastic measures to gain their ends
I at the expense of the Chinese peo
| P'e.
And he added that Chinese Com
-1 munist propaganda—without regard
■ to truth or facts—showed a deter
| mined purpose to arouse "bitter ha
| tied of Americans."
