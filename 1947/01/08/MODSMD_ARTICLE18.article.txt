LAKE SUCCESS. N.Y.. Jan. 7
(UP). —Protests from small coun
tries tonight prevented the United j
Nations Security Council from vot- j
ing immediate approval of the Big j
Four agreement to set up a free !
territory of Trieste.
The carefully worked-out plan i
had been scheduled to go through 5
the Security Council without objec- j
tions.
Australia. however, charged
that sonic parts of the Big Four
agreement violated the U.N. char
ter, and Syria, which became a
Security Council member .only I
today, fjave timid support to the 1
Australian argument.
Poland, Colombia and Belgium
asked for more time to study the
plan.
Although the United States origi
nally asked for immediate approval
of the plan, the Council decided to !
delay a final vote until later this i
week.
Under the Big Four agreement :
on Trieste, the Security Council
would accept the responsibility of
ruling the free territory and of
guaranteeing it against aggres
sion.
The free territory, made up of the
Italian city of Trieste and the adja
cent area, will be established for- ]
mally as soon as the Italian peace
treaty is signed early next month.
Australia's Norman J. O. Makin
sounded the first little country
complaint against the program when
he charged the Security Council
did not have authority to assume
responsibility for guaranteeing the
independence of the territory. This
guarantee is a key point in the
Trieste program worked out by the
foreign ministers of the United
States. Great Britain, Russia and
France. *

WASHINGTON. Jan. 7 (UP).—
I The United Stales today again ac
; cused the Polish provisional gov
j eminent of reneging on its pledge

i by using "reprehensible methods"
| against democratic elements in Po
i land.
Secretary of State James F.
J Byrnes disclosed at a press confer
! ence that ho had appealed to Rus
sia and Great Britain to join in call
ing the violation of the Potsdam
I agreement to Poland's attention in
I a "most friendly but in a most in-
I sistent manner."
j Poland has ignored previous U.S.
j notes on the matter.
Byrnes released the texts of iden
tical notes which have been deliv
ered to the Soviet Government in
Moscow and the British ambassa
dor here. They contained reports
by Vice-Premier Stanislaw Miko
