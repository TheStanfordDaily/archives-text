# BYRNES QUITS JOB
## General Marshall Takes State Department Post 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 (UP).—Secretary of State James F. Byrnes resigned tonight and Presi
dent Truman announced that he would name as his successor Gen. George C. Marshall, former
Army Chief of Staff.
Marshall had been called back from his post as President Truman's special peace envoy to
China and is epected within 10 days. Byrnes' resignation will take effect January 10 or as soon
thereafter as Marshall is formally sworn into office.

The Byrnes resignation, although
rumored for months, came as a sur
prise especially since it becomes ef
fective almost on the eve of the big
four foreign ministers council meet
ing in Moscow to begin negotiations
on the German and Austrian peace
treaties.
TRIED TO Ql IT EARLIER
In announcing the most important
shift in President Truman's Cabinet
since Byrnes succeeded Edward R.
Stettinius, Jr., as Secretary of State
in July, 1945, the White House re
, vealed that Byrnes first asked to be
relieved of his job last April 16.
But Mr. Truman persuaded him to
stay on.
At that time he told President
j Truman in a letter that his doctors
! had warned him to "slow down." In
I a letter dated Dec. 19, he suggested
j that the important change be made
I before the talks on Germany and
j Austria begin in Moscow in March.
MAY PLEASE MOSCOW
Byrnes' resignation came only
1 three days after Bernard M. Barucli
I quit his job as American representa
| tive on the United Nations Atomic
! Energy Commission and only about
four months after his row with
Henry A. Wallace over foreign pol
icy ended in Wallace's resignation
as Secretary of Commerce.
The change in the American Sec
| retary of State is expected to please
j the Soviet Union. Marshall had
j much more experience than Byrnes
! with the Russians during the war.
I He sat in on all the important war
! time conferences, whereas Byrnes
had had no experience in foreign
policy matters when he took over
! the top Cabinet post.
BITTER EXPERIENCE
Byrnes has had bitter experience
with the Soviets—having fought in
private council meetings for months
over the satellite treaties and then
having carried his fight against their
kind of peace treaties to the public
at last summer's Paris peace confer
ence.
Marshall's wartime experience in
planning America's war effort, his
close relationship with the late Pres
ident Roosevelt, and his national and
international prestige as a soldier
and statesman, will give him a good
start in his new job.
J 'MAJOR LOSS'
First reaction was that Byrnes'
| resignation was a "major loss" but
i it was accompanied with expressions
j of "total confidence" in Marshall.
The decision to announce the shift
; in the top Cabinet appointment was
made at a White House conference
; between Byrnes and the President
late today. Byrnes returned to his
office at 5:30 p.m. EST.
The announcement was made
about an hour later while Byrnes
was in conference in his office with
all of his top aides who probably
will submit their resignations as soon
as Marshall takes over.
HEALTH ONLY REASON
This is a customary formality.
Marshall will decide which will stay
on.
j Byrnes left for his hotel at 7:15
i p.m. without making a statement.
Friends of both the President and
j Byrnes emphasized (hat poor health
; and nothing else was behind his rcs-
I ignation.

i
said, rests with the "liberals" in j
both the present government and j
the Communist and other minority I
parlies. But he confessed that these
men —"a splendid group of men"—
as yet lack political power to exer
cise any influence. But, looking to
the future, he said:
"Successful action on their part
under the leadership of Generalis- j
simo Chiang Kai-shek would, I be
lieve, lead to unity through good
government."
Marshall called special attention j
to the liberals within the Commu- j
nist party.
FOR U.S. UNDERSTANDING
. . There is," he said, "a defi
nite liberal group among the Com
munists, especially of young men
who have turned to the Commu
nists in disgust at the corruption
evident in the local governments—
men who would put the interest of
the Chinese people above ruthless
measures to establish a Communist
ideology in the immediate future."
The general admitted that he had
expressed all of the views in his j
statement privately to most of the i
Chinese individuals concerned. He j
said he felt it his duty to express
them publicly at this time to help
the American people attain a par-
I tial understanding of this problem.
