## Another Tradition Down the Drain

With a bit of grim foresight supplied by
past Reg Days, we considered doing what
Doodles Weaver once did. Legend says that
Doodles, arriving in the jam-packed Ad Build
ing of a reg morning, took off v/ith a sneer for
the strugglers and a gleam in his eye. Two
hours later, he was back on the scene—pre
ceded by two Nubian slaves (or reasonable
facsimiles) bearing trumpets. Seven miles of
registering students cleared a path whilst the
trumpets blared, and two voices announced,
"Weaver will now register!"
Anyway—Doodles registered with less trou
ble than most that day. Remembering what
Rg j Days used to be, and the Daily's perennial
icp'esentation of then., we thought he was
pretiy smart

But lo and behold, ALL IS DIFFERENT, as
of the last two days! No more gripes and
groans. No more time for war veterans to tell
stories in the reg lines, or make dates in front
of the tuition window. No more lazy hours in
which to count the many different kinds of
noses worn by 7,000 different kinds of stu
dents. For us, registration was over in a few
minutes.
Yep, reg days have changed, and are we
glad. Pre-registration and the alphabetic
breakdown for reg book collection-time are
the principal reasons—and Messrs. John Stal
naker and H. D. Winbigler are the principal
engineers for this miracle of improvement.
It's time for us chronic gripers to say a gra
cious "th-mk you "
