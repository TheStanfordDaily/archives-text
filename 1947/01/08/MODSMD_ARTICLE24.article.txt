# New Beginnings
## 
### 
How lucky ail ot us St infoid students are
for the "new beginnings" which the Univer
sity calendar hands out three times a year. In
every reg day we see a bigger bubble of hope
than at any time during the quarter just ended
and a resolve to clean up the tired incom
pletes, to miss not one Tuesday Series lecture,
go heretofore impossible plusses, and give up
highway hours for a squint in the art gallery,
the 'Y' rooms or the International Club meet
ings.
Too often, these resolutions go astray,
Jiough the alluring clean slate is always
p.esent at the take-off. We allow ourselves
to become bored v/ith the tedium of classes,
and make excuses to escape the library and
the learning which v/e professedly came here
to get. But until that happens to this quarter,
our hopes rise high and we think of things we
could do--things that might happen:
We could accost a Civ professor in the Cel
lar and chat with him over a black coffee, or
spend an afternoon with the University presi
dent on a "Tresidder Hike," or we might get
the after-class habit of consulting our Russian
professor on how things are, over in Russia.
(The faculty won't mind.) It's a snap we'd
gain valuable friends that way, in places many
have thought to look.
If classes seem too full, and our courses
don't fill the desired bill, we can delve a good

deal deeper than the classroom and textbook
assignments we're given: there are so many
books in the library that most of us haven't
the nerve to start reading them until we're
seniors—but this quarter we could try; we
won't ignore the discussion groups that living
groups or faculty members or the 'Y' arrange;
we'll listen a fraction more carefully to the
passing remarks of professors and friends
who sometimes surprise us v/ith truths, with
inspiration, with the answers to questions we
have pursued almost in vain.
With the publicity splurges of campus or
ganizations who are seeking neophytes, some
of us may try our wings for the first time. If
we are thoughtful in choosing, if we do not
try to spread ourselves so thin that we cover
nothing, we may find a channel for new
friendships and vocationally valuable experi
ences. We must choose well —but above all
must be unafraid to be low man on some al
ready-established BMOC's totem pole, must
not keep up our assumed aloofness from any
activities which make worthwhile contribu
tions to Stanford life.
Maybe this quarter will turn out like many
of the rest; but we v/ish you luck in making
this a better one. How fine it would be if all
of us grew up a little, and turned our thoughts
back to the business of giving as well as tak
ing, to the business of seriously going to
school.

the after-class habit of consulting our Russian
professor on how things are, over in Russia.
(The faculty won't mind.) It's a snap we'd
gain valuable friends that way, in places many
have thought to look.
If classes seem too full, and our courses
don't fill the desired bill, we can delve a good

deal deeper than the classroom and textbook
assignments we're given: there are so many
books in the library that most of us haven't
the nerve to start reading them until we're
seniors—but this quarter we could try; we
won't ignore the discussion groups that living
groups or faculty members or the 'Y' arrange;
we'll listen a fraction more carefully to the
passing remarks of professors and friends
who sometimes surprise us v/ith truths, with
inspiration, with the answers to questions we
have pursued almost in vain.
With the publicity splurges of campus or
ganizations who are seeking neophytes, some
of us may try our wings for the first time. If
we are thoughtful in choosing, if we do not
try to spread ourselves so thin that we cover
nothing, we may find a channel for new
friendships and vocationally valuable experi
ences. We must choose well —but above all
must be unafraid to be low man on some al
ready-established BMOC's totem pole, must
not keep up our assumed aloofness from any
activities which make worthwhile contribu
tions to Stanford life.
Maybe this quarter will turn out like many
of the rest; but we v/ish you luck in making
this a better one. How fine it would be if all
of us grew up a little, and turned our thoughts
back to the business of giving as well as tak
ing, to the business of seriously going to
school.
How lucky ail ot us St infoid students are
for the "new beginnings" which the Univer
sity calendar hands out three times a year. In
every reg day we see a bigger bubble of hope
than at any time during the quarter just ended
and a resolve to clean up the tired incom
pletes, to miss not one Tuesday Series lecture,
go heretofore impossible plusses, and give up
highway hours for a squint in the art gallery,
the 'Y' rooms or the International Club meet
ings.
Too often, these resolutions go astray,
Jiough the alluring clean slate is always
p.esent at the take-off. We allow ourselves
to become bored v/ith the tedium of classes,
and make excuses to escape the library and
the learning which v/e professedly came here
to get. But until that happens to this quarter,
our hopes rise high and we think of things we
could do--things that might happen:
We could accost a Civ professor in the Cel
lar and chat with him over a black coffee, or
spend an afternoon with the University presi
dent on a "Tresidder Hike," or we might get
the after-class habit of consulting our Russian
professor on how things are, over in Russia.
