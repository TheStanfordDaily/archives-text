"How funir; can you get?" they asked me—and I
told them I v.as overripe with this sort of guff, and
maybe I am.
Doodles Weaver isn't the greatest comic of all
time, that joker that was throwing shoes in the bal
cony stole the whole show I thought. But I guess we
just had a BIG, overwhelming storehouse of energy
to work off after that last Christmas vacation. It's
pretty for sure that is that there were a lot of the
Farm roughs that made a vacation of just renewing
the brewing.
Well, the SAE's have done it again. Anything to
get pledges. I don't know where they are putting
them all but they must have an annex for them in
the alley. Latest thing to attract the men to the steps
of that manly tang is a simple little thing eallcd a
PA system.
Main feature is to repel the Stanford woman by
announcing her various charms (weight, height, etc.),
to all the members about. And all this direct from
the steps of the house that B.C. Miller made. But
the average coed goes for this sort of stuff anyway.
And name me three girls that go to the post office
to get mail—spelled with an "i."

TIME, energetic, fact-grasping, ego-hungry news
mag, has just pulled the trick of the week. Seems
that Secretary Byrnes, who was recently nominated
as the "Man of the Year," has lasted just one week.
Now that would even pull the covers off of C.B. Luce.

If you could thread your way through the Cadil
lacs at Santa Anita you could find several Farm wo
men (?) making hand over fist with the money.
Among the more enterprising of these females was
a gal mimed Dish who practically put on a hat and
made like a Western Union boy to carry money to
the till to place on the horses.
When the horse came in she got paid off too be
cause she was so cute and carried her money so
nicely. It ain't easy boys.
And an escaped GI from Toyon tells me that Gordy
and His Gang were on the prowl over the holidays.
Along with a nice collection of pistols to add lo his
ever-increasing armory it is told Gordy even got
himself a couple of beers to drink at the Boathouse
this Spring Quarter. Who peeks for drawers in the
drawers of Branner?—Dick Keusink
