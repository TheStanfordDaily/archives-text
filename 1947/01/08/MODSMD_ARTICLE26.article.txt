## HISTORY 1947 
### 
TIME's "man of the year" for 1946 didn't last very
far into 1947. As the headlines have doubtless in
formed you. Secretary Byrnes has resigned, and will
be replaced by Gen. Marshall. The reason assigned
is Byrnes' poor health, and this is supposed to be
the truth. Marshall is reported to have been reluctant
to take the job, but was drafted for it as one of the
few available "non-partisans" with a national and
international reputation.
For a man whose reported ambition was to be
vice-president, and who probably had as few quali
fications for the job as any man since William Jen
nings Bryan, Byrnes did an excellent job in the
State Department. The last six months of 1946 were
months of solid, tough negotiation, and it was the
American plans and proposals that were largely
adopted by the Foreign Ministers and the United
Nations. The treaties embodying the conclusions of
the Foreign Ministers' meetings will be signed next
month, and this was the limit Byrnes is reported to
have put on his tenure of office. For how long Gen
eral Marshall has agreed to serve was not stated.
* * * ♦
The pre-season antics of the new Republican ma
jority in Congress may have disturbed some of the
many citizens accustomed to thanking Heaven for
the GOP more as an antidote for the late Democratic
majority than for the Elephant's intrinsic merits.
However, practical political requirements and the
bonstitutional checks and balances will, as always,
keep the majority within bounds.
Still, the Republicans will make some attempt to
prevent by law the recurrence of such labor trou

bles as have recently crippled the nation. The coun
try as a whole, I think, will support such laws.
Granted that fundamental causes of economic unrest
cannot be cured by Act of Congress, there are abuses
that can be attacked by statute. Prohibition of juris
dictional strikes, government supervision of union
elections, enforcement of contracts once they are
made, these are examples of what the Republicans
may profitably attempt. On the other hand, they and
any pressure group that might want to cheer them
on would do well to remember that an all-out drive
to smash organized labor under the mask of mere
regulation is not only now distinctly impractical, but
would doubtless backfire in '43. We have elections
every two yards, you know.
The Republican drive for a balanced budget
would sound a whole lot more realistic if it were not
somehow tied in with a proposal to reduce taxes.
The answer is supposed to be that federal government
economy will make both reduced taxes and a bal
anced budget possible. But where is economy to be
imposed? It would seem to me that the large and
continuing appropriations for "internal improve
ments" —any resemblance to a pork barrel is purely
coincidental, of course —grants for roads, airports,
sewers, and other pleasant but hardly essential items,
might be trimmed a little. But a Congressman, espe
cially a new Congressman, has to do something for
his district, so expenditures for the armed services,
military government, assistance to devastated nations,
etc., are the objects of economy. The one substantial,
effective move for military economy and efficiency,
the unification of the armed services, does not how
ever seem to be much favored.

nings Bryan, Byrnes did an excellent job in the
State Department. The last six months of 1946 were
months of solid, tough negotiation, and it was the
American plans and proposals that were largely
adopted by the Foreign Ministers and the United
Nations. The treaties embodying the conclusions of
the Foreign Ministers' meetings will be signed next
month, and this was the limit Byrnes is reported to
have put on his tenure of office. For how long Gen
eral Marshall has agreed to serve was not stated.

The pre-season antics of the new Republican ma
jority in Congress may have disturbed some of the
many citizens accustomed to thanking Heaven for
the GOP more as an antidote for the late Democratic
majority than for the Elephant's intrinsic merits.
However, practical political requirements and the
bonstitutional checks and balances will, as always,
keep the majority within bounds.
Still, the Republicans will make some attempt to
prevent by law the recurrence of such labor trou

bles as have recently crippled the nation. The coun
try as a whole, I think, will support such laws.
Granted that fundamental causes of economic unrest
cannot be cured by Act of Congress, there are abuses
that can be attacked by statute. Prohibition of juris
dictional strikes, government supervision of union
elections, enforcement of contracts once they are
made, these are examples of what the Republicans
may profitably attempt. On the other hand, they and
any pressure group that might want to cheer them
on would do well to remember that an all-out drive
to smash organized labor under the mask of mere
regulation is not only now distinctly impractical, but
would doubtless backfire in '43. We have elections
every two yards, you know.
The Republican drive for a balanced budget
would sound a whole lot more realistic if it were not
somehow tied in with a proposal to reduce taxes.
The answer is supposed to be that federal government
economy will make both reduced taxes and a bal
anced budget possible. But where is economy to be
imposed? It would seem to me that the large and
continuing appropriations for "internal improve
ments" —any resemblance to a pork barrel is purely
coincidental, of course —grants for roads, airports,
sewers, and other pleasant but hardly essential items,
might be trimmed a little. But a Congressman, espe
cially a new Congressman, has to do something for
his district, so expenditures for the armed services,
military government, assistance to devastated nations,
etc., are the objects of economy. The one substantial,
effective move for military economy and efficiency,
the unification of the armed services, does not how
ever seem to be much favored.
TIME's "man of the year" for 1946 didn't last very
far into 1947. As the headlines have doubtless in
formed you. Secretary Byrnes has resigned, and will
be replaced by Gen. Marshall. The reason assigned
is Byrnes' poor health, and this is supposed to be
the truth. Marshall is reported to have been reluctant
to take the job, but was drafted for it as one of the
few available "non-partisans" with a national and
international reputation.
For a man whose reported ambition was to be
vice-president, and who probably had as few quali
fications for the job as any man since William Jen
nings Bryan, Byrnes did an excellent job in the
State Department. The last six months of 1946 were
