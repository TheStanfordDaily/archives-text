Professor Philip W. Buck of the
Political Science Department ad
dressed the Palo Alto chapter of the
Reserve Officers' Association of
America on "Can the United Na
tions Maintain World Peace?" at
their regular monthly meeting
Monday night.
Professor Buck brought forth the
urgent necessity for a quick con
trol over atomic power if civiliza
tion is to survive. He expressed his
belief that if the U.N. is to succeed
as an international organization for
maintaining order, it must be ready
to meet the force of any aggressor
nation.
The speaker stated that although
he is not too optimistic that the U.N.
can maintain permanent peace
among nations, he believes that it
has within its organization the
power to prevent mankind from de
stroying itself through atomic war
fare.
