Foo Shi all tit Play with the Footballers?
Here's a Si tort That's Made to Order
Football is our first love, but this isn't the football season, so we'll have
to write about something else today. Let's see . . . hmm . . . track, no
that's in the spring . . . basketball, no that's in col. (i . . . rugby . . . yeah,
rugby. It ain't football, but its close; okeh, we'll write about rugby
today. Might as well, lots of other stuff to put in the page today, and I
need some stuff to fill these many inches.
Chuck Taylor, the red-headed All-America guard off the 1942 team,
and just recently returned to the Farm after a season with the Miami Sea
hawks of the All-America Conference, put the bite on us via the phone.
Need some help, he said, nobody's coming out for rugby; put the blast
on 'em.
'1 hroughout all of last quarter we were beseiged constantly by little
men who kept bemoaning the fact that they were unable to play foot
ball. Buy don't I wish I was big enough to play. I'd give anything to be
able to play. Okeh, men, noiv's your chance. The ancient and honor
able sport of rugby beckons.
II you're short and skinny and built something like me, trot down
to the SAC building and poke around until you lind room 14. You can't
miss it. it's marked 'Football Coaches!' (in in and sign up for one unit
of gym credit. Do you a world of good; besides you need the exercise,
you look flabby.
You don't have to be big and you don't have to be young. All you have
to be is willing. It's got everything football's got—except that strategy is
replaced by confusion. You play with something that looks like a first
cousin to a football and ybu run, pass and kick it. And there's none of
the hard, bruising contact that makes little guys sit on the sidelines at
football games.
Let s (,o n Men! Everybody Out for liugby
Big men, little men, old men, young men, fast men, slow men, they all
play rugby. If you don't believe me take a gander at some of the old
geezers who'll be playing for outfits like the Olympic Club, et al. They're
not young, big or fast, but they play and enjoy the game as much as the
fast, big kids do.
And who knows, you may be good enough to get to go to Canada or
the Olympic Games; might even win a circle 'S'. Last quarter Excom made
rugby a minor sport and at the end of this season the faithful will be
rewarded with letters and maybe sweaters.
A pair of Stanford greats of former years, Jim Wylie and Williard
Classen, will be coaching the sport, ably aided and abetted by Taylor.
Thursday they'll issue uniforms and practice starts Monday. Although
the schedule hasn't been released as yet. an eight- or ten-game card is
being drawn up, including one game with a Canadian team, either hrte
or there.
Also a representative team from this area will be chosen for the 1948
London Olympics and there's no reason why Stanford shouldn't have some
men on the team. But it's up to you guys to make it, and you can't make it
sitting around moaning about being too small or too old to play intercolle
giate sports.
Meant tit PCC: If hat About Those Broncs?
At the beginning of the current school year. H.D. Thoreau sent us a
very comprehensive letter ticking off the various teams in the Pacific Coast.
Conference Southern Division basketball loop (that sure filled some space),
and listed UCLA, Cal, Stanford and USC as finishing in that order. Well,
they might have if they'd played basketball last September, but since then
a lot of beer bottles have been drained.
In the first place, Santa Clara came along and knocked off Cal. USC
and UCLA in regulation games and Stanford in an unadvertised scrim
mage session at the Pavilion. Which means that the lower loop tit list may
have to lay its title on the block for the Broncos to have a whack at. ere
the NCAA playoffs are to be consummated.
II the Northern Division has any beefs on the subject, let it recall the
way the Broncos swept through the Northwest, dropping only one tilt
to Washington State on what must have been an oil" night. It must have
been, Monday night the Cougars took it on the chin from Oregon State,
one of (he outfits that the Broncs handled rather neatly.
In the pre-season jousting of this division's teams, none of the outfits
(hat (ravelled afar came home covered with glory—SC and UCLA not
qui(e burning up (he boards, and Stanford doing somevvha( less well.
But California stayed a( Berkeley and knocked over some of the best
the Midwest and East had to offer.
The Bears split a bill with Illinois' Whiz Kids, and laced Ohio State and
Dartmouth, and on that record we'll put 'em on top of the heap. This
week-end Troy invades Berkeley, and ii either team takes both games,
you may as well hand 'cm the crown right now.
UCLA is the outfit that's loaded with stars, but somehow or other, the
gears aren't quite meshing, and offhand we don't think the Bruin can beat
either Cal or USC. Those two outfits are just as loaded with pre-war and
wartime stars as UCLA is, and we have good reason to believe that they
are being used to better advantage. At least it looks like it now.
Indians Lack Savvy for Current Grind
Stanford, minus Howie Dallmar, is just another good green college team
which will be heard from in the future, but unfortunately we don't think
its this season. With only one experienced man on the starting five, we
don't expect more than an occasional reversal of the other conference
teams. Experience is something that has to be acquired, and the Tribe
hasn t been acquiring long enough to be on a par with the other squads.
Nevertheless, the hoys are big and strong, and some defeats this sea
son will only make them play (ha( much better next season. And the
funny thing about that is tha( they'll all be back again. And when I
say big and strong (hat's what I mean. The starting five averages 193,
and goes up (o (> fee( 2 and one-half inches. And (ha('s big for basket
ball. Usually (hey go at about 150 and (> feet (> and two-thirds inches.
Not men at all. just skin and bones and a sharp eye.
Some of the boys from the football team have turned out for cage, with
one of them being slightly the worse for wear as a result. While you were
all away on the torn and jerry circuit, the pavilion got its face lifted, or do
I mean the floor lowered. Anyway the deck was sanded and given three
coats of varnish and does—did—it look good. Smooth, too.
Anyway, Gene Msrtin, who spent most of last cage season picking him
self up off the floor, started this season the same way. Only this time he
got himself a busted nose. The sort of thing that would put you or me to
bed lor a month. Gene? He'll be practicing with the jayvees this afternoon.

and listed UCLA, Cal, Stanford and USC as finishing in that order. Well,
they might have if they'd played basketball last September, but since then
a lot of beer bottles have been drained.
In the first place, Santa Clara came along and knocked off Cal. USC
and UCLA in regulation games and Stanford in an unadvertised scrim
mage session at the Pavilion. Which means that the lower loop tit list may
have to lay its title on the block for the Broncos to have a whack at. ere
the NCAA playoffs are to be consummated.
II the Northern Division has any beefs on the subject, let it recall the
way the Broncos swept through the Northwest, dropping only one tilt
to Washington State on what must have been an oil" night. It must have
been, Monday night the Cougars took it on the chin from Oregon State,
one of (he outfits that the Broncs handled rather neatly.
In the pre-season jousting of this division's teams, none of the outfits
(hat (ravelled afar came home covered with glory—SC and UCLA not
qui(e burning up (he boards, and Stanford doing somevvha( less well.
But California stayed a( Berkeley and knocked over some of the best
the Midwest and East had to offer.
The Bears split a bill with Illinois' Whiz Kids, and laced Ohio State and
Dartmouth, and on that record we'll put 'em on top of the heap. This
week-end Troy invades Berkeley, and ii either team takes both games,
you may as well hand 'cm the crown right now.
UCLA is the outfit that's loaded with stars, but somehow or other, the
gears aren't quite meshing, and offhand we don't think the Bruin can beat
either Cal or USC. Those two outfits are just as loaded with pre-war and
wartime stars as UCLA is, and we have good reason to believe that they
are being used to better advantage. At least it looks like it now.
Indians Lack Savvy for Current Grind
Stanford, minus Howie Dallmar, is just another good green college team
which will be heard from in the future, but unfortunately we don't think
its this season. With only one experienced man on the starting five, we
don't expect more than an occasional reversal of the other conference
teams. Experience is something that has to be acquired, and the Tribe
hasn t been acquiring long enough to be on a par with the other squads.
Nevertheless, the hoys are big and strong, and some defeats this sea
son will only make them play (ha( much better next season. And the
funny thing about that is tha( they'll all be back again. And when I
say big and strong (hat's what I mean. The starting five averages 193,
and goes up (o (> fee( 2 and one-half inches. And (ha('s big for basket
ball. Usually (hey go at about 150 and (> feet (> and two-thirds inches.
Not men at all. just skin and bones and a sharp eye.
Some of the boys from the football team have turned out for cage, with
one of them being slightly the worse for wear as a result. While you were
all away on the torn and jerry circuit, the pavilion got its face lifted, or do
I mean the floor lowered. Anyway the deck was sanded and given three
coats of varnish and does—did—it look good. Smooth, too.
Anyway, Gene Msrtin, who spent most of last cage season picking him
self up off the floor, started this season the same way. Only this time he
got himself a busted nose. The sort of thing that would put you or me to
bed lor a month. Gene? He'll be practicing with the jayvees this afternoon.

Football is our first love, but this isn't the football season, so we'll have

that's in the spring . . . basketball, no that's in col. (i . . . rugby . . . yeah,
rugby. It ain't football, but its close; okeh, we'll write about rugby
today. Might as well, lots of other stuff to put in the page today, and I
need some stuff to fill these many inches.
Chuck Taylor, the red-headed All-America guard off the 1942 team,
and just recently returned to the Farm after a season with the Miami Sea
hawks of the All-America Conference, put the bite on us via the phone.
Need some help, he said, nobody's coming out for rugby; put the blast
on 'em.
'1 hroughout all of last quarter we were beseiged constantly by little
men who kept bemoaning the fact that they were unable to play foot
ball. Buy don't I wish I was big enough to play. I'd give anything to be
able to play. Okeh, men, noiv's your chance. The ancient and honor
able sport of rugby beckons.
II you're short and skinny and built something like me, trot down
to the SAC building and poke around until you lind room 14. You can't
miss it. it's marked 'Football Coaches!' (in in and sign up for one unit
of gym credit. Do you a world of good; besides you need the exercise,
you look flabby.
You don't have to be big and you don't have to be young. All you have
to be is willing. It's got everything football's got—except that strategy is
replaced by confusion. You play with something that looks like a first
cousin to a football and ybu run, pass and kick it. And there's none of
the hard, bruising contact that makes little guys sit on the sidelines at
football games.
Let s (,o n Men! Everybody Out for liugby
Big men, little men, old men, young men, fast men, slow men, they all
play rugby. If you don't believe me take a gander at some of the old
geezers who'll be playing for outfits like the Olympic Club, et al. They're
not young, big or fast, but they play and enjoy the game as much as the
fast, big kids do.
And who knows, you may be good enough to get to go to Canada or
the Olympic Games; might even win a circle 'S'. Last quarter Excom made
rugby a minor sport and at the end of this season the faithful will be
rewarded with letters and maybe sweaters.
A pair of Stanford greats of former years, Jim Wylie and Williard
Classen, will be coaching the sport, ably aided and abetted by Taylor.
Thursday they'll issue uniforms and practice starts Monday. Although
the schedule hasn't been released as yet. an eight- or ten-game card is
being drawn up, including one game with a Canadian team, either hrte
or there.
Also a representative team from this area will be chosen for the 1948
London Olympics and there's no reason why Stanford shouldn't have some
men on the team. But it's up to you guys to make it, and you can't make it
sitting around moaning about being too small or too old to play intercolle
giate sports.

to write about something else today. Let's see . . . hmm . . . track, no
that's in the spring . . . basketball, no that's in col. (i . . . rugby . . . yeah,
rugby. It ain't football, but its close; okeh, we'll write about rugby
today. Might as well, lots of other stuff to put in the page today, and I
need some stuff to fill these many inches.
Chuck Taylor, the red-headed All-America guard off the 1942 team,
and just recently returned to the Farm after a season with the Miami Sea
hawks of the All-America Conference, put the bite on us via the phone.
Need some help, he said, nobody's coming out for rugby; put the blast
on 'em.
'1 hroughout all of last quarter we were beseiged constantly by little
men who kept bemoaning the fact that they were unable to play foot
ball. Buy don't I wish I was big enough to play. I'd give anything to be
able to play. Okeh, men, noiv's your chance. The ancient and honor
able sport of rugby beckons.
II you're short and skinny and built something like me, trot down
to the SAC building and poke around until you lind room 14. You can't
miss it. it's marked 'Football Coaches!' (in in and sign up for one unit
of gym credit. Do you a world of good; besides you need the exercise,
you look flabby.
You don't have to be big and you don't have to be young. All you have
to be is willing. It's got everything football's got—except that strategy is
replaced by confusion. You play with something that looks like a first
cousin to a football and ybu run, pass and kick it. And there's none of
the hard, bruising contact that makes little guys sit on the sidelines at
football games.
Let s (,o n Men! Everybody Out for liugby
Big men, little men, old men, young men, fast men, slow men, they all
play rugby. If you don't believe me take a gander at some of the old
geezers who'll be playing for outfits like the Olympic Club, et al. They're
not young, big or fast, but they play and enjoy the game as much as the
fast, big kids do.
And who knows, you may be good enough to get to go to Canada or
the Olympic Games; might even win a circle 'S'. Last quarter Excom made
rugby a minor sport and at the end of this season the faithful will be
rewarded with letters and maybe sweaters.
A pair of Stanford greats of former years, Jim Wylie and Williard
Classen, will be coaching the sport, ably aided and abetted by Taylor.
Thursday they'll issue uniforms and practice starts Monday. Although
the schedule hasn't been released as yet. an eight- or ten-game card is
being drawn up, including one game with a Canadian team, either hrte
or there.
Also a representative team from this area will be chosen for the 1948
London Olympics and there's no reason why Stanford shouldn't have some
men on the team. But it's up to you guys to make it, and you can't make it
sitting around moaning about being too small or too old to play intercolle
giate sports.
Meant tit PCC: If hat About Those Broncs?
At the beginning of the current school year. H.D. Thoreau sent us a
very comprehensive letter ticking off the various teams in the Pacific Coast.
Conference Southern Division basketball loop (that sure filled some space),
and listed UCLA, Cal, Stanford and USC as finishing in that order. Well,
they might have if they'd played basketball last September, but since then
a lot of beer bottles have been drained.
In the first place, Santa Clara came along and knocked off Cal. USC
and UCLA in regulation games and Stanford in an unadvertised scrim
mage session at the Pavilion. Which means that the lower loop tit list may
have to lay its title on the block for the Broncos to have a whack at. ere
the NCAA playoffs are to be consummated.
II the Northern Division has any beefs on the subject, let it recall the
way the Broncos swept through the Northwest, dropping only one tilt
to Washington State on what must have been an oil" night. It must have
been, Monday night the Cougars took it on the chin from Oregon State,
one of (he outfits that the Broncs handled rather neatly.
In the pre-season jousting of this division's teams, none of the outfits
(hat (ravelled afar came home covered with glory—SC and UCLA not
qui(e burning up (he boards, and Stanford doing somevvha( less well.
But California stayed a( Berkeley and knocked over some of the best
the Midwest and East had to offer.
The Bears split a bill with Illinois' Whiz Kids, and laced Ohio State and
Dartmouth, and on that record we'll put 'em on top of the heap. This
week-end Troy invades Berkeley, and ii either team takes both games,
you may as well hand 'cm the crown right now.
UCLA is the outfit that's loaded with stars, but somehow or other, the
gears aren't quite meshing, and offhand we don't think the Bruin can beat
either Cal or USC. Those two outfits are just as loaded with pre-war and
wartime stars as UCLA is, and we have good reason to believe that they
are being used to better advantage. At least it looks like it now.
Indians Lack Savvy for Current Grind
Stanford, minus Howie Dallmar, is just another good green college team
which will be heard from in the future, but unfortunately we don't think
its this season. With only one experienced man on the starting five, we
don't expect more than an occasional reversal of the other conference
teams. Experience is something that has to be acquired, and the Tribe
hasn t been acquiring long enough to be on a par with the other squads.
Nevertheless, the hoys are big and strong, and some defeats this sea
son will only make them play (ha( much better next season. And the
funny thing about that is tha( they'll all be back again. And when I
say big and strong (hat's what I mean. The starting five averages 193,
and goes up (o (> fee( 2 and one-half inches. And (ha('s big for basket
ball. Usually (hey go at about 150 and (> feet (> and two-thirds inches.
Not men at all. just skin and bones and a sharp eye.
Some of the boys from the football team have turned out for cage, with
one of them being slightly the worse for wear as a result. While you were
all away on the torn and jerry circuit, the pavilion got its face lifted, or do
I mean the floor lowered. Anyway the deck was sanded and given three
coats of varnish and does—did—it look good. Smooth, too.
Anyway, Gene Msrtin, who spent most of last cage season picking him
self up off the floor, started this season the same way. Only this time he
got himself a busted nose. The sort of thing that would put you or me to
bed lor a month. Gene? He'll be practicing with the jayvees this afternoon.

a lot of beer bottles have been drained.
In the first place, Santa Clara came along and knocked off Cal. USC
and UCLA in regulation games and Stanford in an unadvertised scrim
mage session at the Pavilion. Which means that the lower loop tit list may
have to lay its title on the block for the Broncos to have a whack at. ere
the NCAA playoffs are to be consummated.
II the Northern Division has any beefs on the subject, let it recall the
way the Broncos swept through the Northwest, dropping only one tilt
to Washington State on what must have been an oil" night. It must have
been, Monday night the Cougars took it on the chin from Oregon State,
one of (he outfits that the Broncs handled rather neatly.
In the pre-season jousting of this division's teams, none of the outfits
(hat (ravelled afar came home covered with glory—SC and UCLA not
qui(e burning up (he boards, and Stanford doing somevvha( less well.
But California stayed a( Berkeley and knocked over some of the best
the Midwest and East had to offer.
The Bears split a bill with Illinois' Whiz Kids, and laced Ohio State and
Dartmouth, and on that record we'll put 'em on top of the heap. This
week-end Troy invades Berkeley, and ii either team takes both games,
you may as well hand 'cm the crown right now.
UCLA is the outfit that's loaded with stars, but somehow or other, the
gears aren't quite meshing, and offhand we don't think the Bruin can beat
either Cal or USC. Those two outfits are just as loaded with pre-war and
wartime stars as UCLA is, and we have good reason to believe that they
are being used to better advantage. At least it looks like it now.
Indians Lack Savvy for Current Grind
Stanford, minus Howie Dallmar, is just another good green college team
which will be heard from in the future, but unfortunately we don't think
its this season. With only one experienced man on the starting five, we
don't expect more than an occasional reversal of the other conference
teams. Experience is something that has to be acquired, and the Tribe
hasn t been acquiring long enough to be on a par with the other squads.
Nevertheless, the hoys are big and strong, and some defeats this sea
son will only make them play (ha( much better next season. And the
funny thing about that is tha( they'll all be back again. And when I
say big and strong (hat's what I mean. The starting five averages 193,
and goes up (o (> fee( 2 and one-half inches. And (ha('s big for basket
ball. Usually (hey go at about 150 and (> feet (> and two-thirds inches.
Not men at all. just skin and bones and a sharp eye.
Some of the boys from the football team have turned out for cage, with
one of them being slightly the worse for wear as a result. While you were
all away on the torn and jerry circuit, the pavilion got its face lifted, or do
I mean the floor lowered. Anyway the deck was sanded and given three
coats of varnish and does—did—it look good. Smooth, too.
Anyway, Gene Msrtin, who spent most of last cage season picking him
self up off the floor, started this season the same way. Only this time he
got himself a busted nose. The sort of thing that would put you or me to
bed lor a month. Gene? He'll be practicing with the jayvees this afternoon.
Foo Shi all tit Play with the Footballers?
Here's a Si tort That's Made to Order
Football is our first love, but this isn't the football season, so we'll have
to write about something else today. Let's see . . . hmm . . . track, no
that's in the spring . . . basketball, no that's in col. (i . . . rugby . . . yeah,
rugby. It ain't football, but its close; okeh, we'll write about rugby
today. Might as well, lots of other stuff to put in the page today, and I
need some stuff to fill these many inches.
Chuck Taylor, the red-headed All-America guard off the 1942 team,
and just recently returned to the Farm after a season with the Miami Sea
hawks of the All-America Conference, put the bite on us via the phone.
Need some help, he said, nobody's coming out for rugby; put the blast
on 'em.
'1 hroughout all of last quarter we were beseiged constantly by little
men who kept bemoaning the fact that they were unable to play foot
ball. Buy don't I wish I was big enough to play. I'd give anything to be
able to play. Okeh, men, noiv's your chance. The ancient and honor
able sport of rugby beckons.
II you're short and skinny and built something like me, trot down
to the SAC building and poke around until you lind room 14. You can't
miss it. it's marked 'Football Coaches!' (in in and sign up for one unit
of gym credit. Do you a world of good; besides you need the exercise,
you look flabby.
You don't have to be big and you don't have to be young. All you have
to be is willing. It's got everything football's got—except that strategy is
replaced by confusion. You play with something that looks like a first
cousin to a football and ybu run, pass and kick it. And there's none of
the hard, bruising contact that makes little guys sit on the sidelines at
football games.
Let s (,o n Men! Everybody Out for liugby
Big men, little men, old men, young men, fast men, slow men, they all
play rugby. If you don't believe me take a gander at some of the old
geezers who'll be playing for outfits like the Olympic Club, et al. They're
not young, big or fast, but they play and enjoy the game as much as the
fast, big kids do.
And who knows, you may be good enough to get to go to Canada or
the Olympic Games; might even win a circle 'S'. Last quarter Excom made
rugby a minor sport and at the end of this season the faithful will be
rewarded with letters and maybe sweaters.
A pair of Stanford greats of former years, Jim Wylie and Williard
Classen, will be coaching the sport, ably aided and abetted by Taylor.
Thursday they'll issue uniforms and practice starts Monday. Although
the schedule hasn't been released as yet. an eight- or ten-game card is
being drawn up, including one game with a Canadian team, either hrte
or there.
Also a representative team from this area will be chosen for the 1948
London Olympics and there's no reason why Stanford shouldn't have some
men on the team. But it's up to you guys to make it, and you can't make it
sitting around moaning about being too small or too old to play intercolle
giate sports.
Meant tit PCC: If hat About Those Broncs?
At the beginning of the current school year. H.D. Thoreau sent us a
very comprehensive letter ticking off the various teams in the Pacific Coast.
