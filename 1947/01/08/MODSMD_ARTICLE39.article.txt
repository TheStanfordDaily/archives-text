## 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 7 (UP).- Declaring there v/as "a possibility
of a devastating betting scandal in big-time college athletics,"
Dr. J. L. Morrill, president of the University of Minnesota, today
urged complete support of the amateurish code before the NCAA.
The five-principle plan to de-emphasize and purify college

sports will be considered tomorrow
by the National Collegiate Athletic
Association.
Morrill, speaking before a joint
meeting of the NCAA and the
American Football Coaches Associ
ation, criticized:
1. The professional college ath
lete.
2. His own Big Nine Conference
for "succumbing to the bowl
craze."
The football "black market."
4. "Crazed hysteria for coach
ing scalps."
5. "Athletic subsidies" which
open the way for gambling scan
dals.
(>. Newspaper team rankings
and odds publication.
7. And a militant boycott of in
sittutions which refuse to adhere
to the NCAA purifying program.
"I think that intercollegiate ath
letics—college students playing on
college teams, not 'athletes' playing
on 'ball clubs' which happen to
carry a college name —have built
up something fine," Morrill said. "It
is something we can't afford to soil
and scuttle, something with values
we must save and somehow con
solidate, and not something to be
sold down the riv.er for the false
gold of gate receipts.
Morrill described the past two
football seasons as ones of "nation
ally advertised black market in
football players for hire," and de
cried the "coaches and college heads
cat-calling like children over kid
naping of veteran-transfers" and
the "athletic conference cowardice
in restoring normal eligibility re
quirements."
"Players who threaten a sit-down
strike for a better deal on athletic
subsidies will fall an easy prey to
the easy-money approaches of un
scrupulous gamblers," he warned.
"The possibility of a devastat
ing betting scandal hovers like a
intercollegiate athletic scene."
Morrill asserted that the week
ly team ratings and regular pub
lication of scoring odds was "grist
for the mill of gamblers."
"Professional baseball found
that eternal vigilance was the
price of integrity." he said. "Pro
fessional football is learning the
lesson. Intercollegiate football is
ripe for the kill."
Anent the bowl games, Morrill
declared:
"The mounting plethora of post
season bowl games — Orange, Oil.
Cotton, Cigar, Tobacco, Raisin. 'Ga
tor, any and everything but colle
aiate —is no help in all this," Mor
rill asserted. "They put new com
'pulsion on the coaches to win at any
cost and take the game from the
campus.
"As the head of a Western Con
ference university, let me express
my disappointment that our group
has seen fit to succumb to the bowl
craze."

CAGE COACH DEAN
NEW YORK, Jan. 7 (UP).- Declaring there v/as "a possibility
of a devastating betting scandal in big-time college athletics,"
Dr. J. L. Morrill, president of the University of Minnesota, today
urged complete support of the amateurish code before the NCAA.
The five-principle plan to de-emphasize and purify college

sports will be considered tomorrow
by the National Collegiate Athletic
Association.
Morrill, speaking before a joint
meeting of the NCAA and the
American Football Coaches Associ
ation, criticized:
1. The professional college ath
lete.
2. His own Big Nine Conference
for "succumbing to the bowl
craze."
The football "black market."
4. "Crazed hysteria for coach
ing scalps."
5. "Athletic subsidies" which
open the way for gambling scan
dals.
(>. Newspaper team rankings
and odds publication.
7. And a militant boycott of in
sittutions which refuse to adhere
to the NCAA purifying program.
"I think that intercollegiate ath
letics—college students playing on
college teams, not 'athletes' playing
on 'ball clubs' which happen to
carry a college name —have built
up something fine," Morrill said. "It
is something we can't afford to soil
and scuttle, something with values
we must save and somehow con
solidate, and not something to be
sold down the riv.er for the false
gold of gate receipts.
Morrill described the past two
football seasons as ones of "nation
ally advertised black market in
football players for hire," and de
cried the "coaches and college heads
cat-calling like children over kid
naping of veteran-transfers" and
the "athletic conference cowardice
in restoring normal eligibility re
quirements."
"Players who threaten a sit-down
strike for a better deal on athletic
subsidies will fall an easy prey to
the easy-money approaches of un
scrupulous gamblers," he warned.
"The possibility of a devastat
ing betting scandal hovers like a
intercollegiate athletic scene."
Morrill asserted that the week
ly team ratings and regular pub
lication of scoring odds was "grist
for the mill of gamblers."
"Professional baseball found
that eternal vigilance was the
price of integrity." he said. "Pro
fessional football is learning the
lesson. Intercollegiate football is
ripe for the kill."
Anent the bowl games, Morrill
declared:
"The mounting plethora of post

aiate —is no help in all this," Mor
