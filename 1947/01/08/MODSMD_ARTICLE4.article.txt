## 
### 
Just returned from the December ,
Chicago Student Conference Meet- j
j ing. four Stanford men and women i
| reported enthusiasm and progress j
on the part of students from all
over America who met to exchange
views.
Niel Allen, head of Stanford's In- |
ternational Survey Committee and
chairman of the local delegation,
said, "From all appearances the ;
conference struck home at the es- !
sent.ial domestic problems facing j
students today." He was accompa
nied at the Chicago meeting by fel- j
low delegates Marilyn Sidwell and
Bill Slocum, and observer Nancy j
Alden.
Main plans made were for a con- i
stitutional convention, to be held j

i next summer, for a National Union
of Students. The meeting was spon
! sored and initiated by the 25 Amer
ican student representatives to the
Prague Conference which last au
j tumn framed the International Un
] ion of Students, who told how stu
j dents in this country would benefit
from a separate National Union
! here.
Alien commented, "The Stanford
: student body apparently will be
I well rewarded by participation in
I the organization. Student body ac
j tion within this group, allied with
j the work done on foreign surveys,
J will bring Stanford to a foremost
j position among universities inter
j ested in problems beyond the cam
! pus."
The convention was broken up
j into panels to discuss different
j phases of student life, and resolu
| tions were drawn up stating the
I aims of the delegates toward better
ing student conditions.
