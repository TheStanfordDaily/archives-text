# Da de-Ortiz Rematch Due
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Jan. 7 (UP).
—Harold Dade, the 23-year-old
Chicago Negro who won the world's
bantamweight championship last
j night from Manuel Ortiz, will give
I Ortiz a return match within the
| next 90 days, it was announced to-
I day.
Site for the bout has not yet been
i selected, but Tommy Farmer, man
ager of Ortiz, the Mexican star from
; El Centro, who held the crown for
j five years, said it probably would
be at the Los Angeles Olympic.
Dade, a virtual unknown in the
i fight ranks and refused recogni
tion by the National Boxing As
j sociation as a "ranking challcn
| gcr" for the bantamweight crown,
meanwhile planned to rest —pos- j
sibly wi(h a few over-(he-weight
| matches tossed in.
The Negro lad, who now makes
j Los Angeles his home, had signed
a contract with Ortiz and Farmer
i guaranteeing the champion a return
| bout within three months in case'
he (Dade) won the crown.
In the meantime, no decision had
b r >en reported here on what will be
j come of the scheduled Ortiz - Kui
Kong Young "title'" bout slated for j
next month in Los Angeles. It is j
possible that the Dade-Ortiz re
| match may take that date.
Dade had been so lightly regard
ed in the betting that he entered the \
ring a 12-1 underdog, with little or
no betting on the outcome.
But lie fought a battle that
looked as if it had been copied
; strictly from Ortiz' past bouts.
Dade coasted when Ortiz did;
then he turned on the steam (he
same time as (he champion.
In the long run, it was another of I
the many cases of youth triumph
ing over age. Ortiz is 31 — eight j
years older than the new cham- 1
pion.
Ortiz has returned to his produce ]
farm in Southern California, but, i
according to his manager, Farmer, !
has no intention of retiring. He still j
believes he can lick Dade.
"I just had an off night and still
think I can lick Dade six out of
seven times," said Ortiz. He suf
fered no injuries and Dade had only
a slight cut above his left eye.
Promoter Benny Ford said he is
attempting to get the return match ;
for Civic Auditorium here—but he ;
appeared to have little chance.

for Civic Auditorium here—but he ;
appeared to have little chance.
SAN FRANCISCO. Jan. 7 (UP).
—Harold Dade, the 23-year-old
Chicago Negro who won the world's
bantamweight championship last
j night from Manuel Ortiz, will give
I Ortiz a return match within the
| next 90 days, it was announced to-
I day.
Site for the bout has not yet been
i selected, but Tommy Farmer, man
ager of Ortiz, the Mexican star from
; El Centro, who held the crown for
j five years, said it probably would
be at the Los Angeles Olympic.
Dade, a virtual unknown in the
i fight ranks and refused recogni
tion by the National Boxing As
j sociation as a "ranking challcn
| gcr" for the bantamweight crown,
meanwhile planned to rest —pos- j
sibly wi(h a few over-(he-weight
| matches tossed in.
The Negro lad, who now makes
j Los Angeles his home, had signed
a contract with Ortiz and Farmer
i guaranteeing the champion a return
| bout within three months in case'
he (Dade) won the crown.
In the meantime, no decision had
b r >en reported here on what will be
j come of the scheduled Ortiz - Kui
Kong Young "title'" bout slated for j
next month in Los Angeles. It is j
possible that the Dade-Ortiz re
| match may take that date.
Dade had been so lightly regard
ed in the betting that he entered the \
ring a 12-1 underdog, with little or
no betting on the outcome.
But lie fought a battle that
looked as if it had been copied
; strictly from Ortiz' past bouts.
Dade coasted when Ortiz did;
then he turned on the steam (he
same time as (he champion.
In the long run, it was another of I
the many cases of youth triumph
ing over age. Ortiz is 31 — eight j
years older than the new cham- 1
pion.
Ortiz has returned to his produce ]
farm in Southern California, but, i
according to his manager, Farmer, !
has no intention of retiring. He still j
believes he can lick Dade.
"I just had an off night and still
think I can lick Dade six out of
seven times," said Ortiz. He suf
fered no injuries and Dade had only
a slight cut above his left eye.
Promoter Benny Ford said he is
attempting to get the return match ;
for Civic Auditorium here—but he ;
appeared to have little chance.
