# Cards Prep for UCLA Series
## 
### 
A 14-mnn squad will leave these
parts for the Southland tomorrow
11 i ht, and Stanford's oh-so-green
cagers bid fair to be quite an un
derdog in their tussles with U.C.-
L.A.'s Bruins at Westwood Friday
and Saturday nights, after two
more days of workouts for the
P.C.C. openers.
The southern version of the B'ar
is loaded for Injun, having virtually
all of last year's team which had
the Cards jumping through the
hoop back, plus some pretty fair
country players in a couple of col
ored lads named Don Barksdale and
Davage Minor.
Despite it's being very early in
the season — some people just
can't learn—an odd neck or two
has already been stuck out pro
claiming Barksdale as probably
the best eager on the coast. lie
may very well be. Minor is an
other who could be ticketed for
the same berth, although at this
stage the former is still holding
bis own.
Besides these two, the Uclans
have Chuck Cluska, last year's frosh
Hash, and the three v:ive the rest of
the Southern Division the go-by
when it conies to individual stars.
But—and it's a big one —Santa Clara
whipped the Bruins down south,
and N.Y.U. did likewise at Madison
Square Garden.
At any rate, the L.A. troupe still
holds a big edge over the Cards,
about ten points' worth for Friday's
game. Before anyone throws in the
towel, though, let us repeat Coach
Everett Dean's words of last season:
"Basketball is a funny game." Yep,
it sure is.
Of the traveling squad, 13 men
have been named—Bob Lewis. Milt
Iverson, Morley Thompson, Bill

Drehobl, Babe Capt. Dave who was on the Midwestern swing,
Davidson, Dick Berlin, Ralph Car- will not make the trip due to ill
ver, Gus Chavala.sp, Bill Stephen- ness, and his replacement has not
son, Jack Wood. Jack Meredith, yet been named.
