# 'Hoot Mon!' Friday at Ball
## 
### 
It's the gathering of the clans!
When the lads and lasses of the
Junior clans gather for the Scotch
Hi-Ball Friday night, it'll be Scotch
time in the Women's Gym from 9
to 12.
Bob Coate and June Sword, gen
eral chairmen, have announced that
no one will be admitted who is not
wearing plaids of some sort, be it of
the MacTavish or the MacAllister
clan. The JVlacMelody masters will
play for "hopping with the Scotch."
The "Hi-Bali" will culminate the
"Highland Holiday" Friday, when all
clans of '48 will appear in Quad
classes in plaid.
Tickets for the dance will go on
sale to Juniors at their class meeting
tonight for $1.20 and will be sold to
the rest of the campus at the ASSU
office tomorrow.
