Statistics are playing hob with
Stanford Village and everyone is
mighty happy about it. Figures
show that Stanford has neither a
housing problem nor a "veteran
problem."
Early estimates reveal that some
:>OO new students have been as
signed living quarters at the Vil
lage and over 1,100 men residents
have moved in. Women residents
now number 107, an increase of
about :!0 women students. Room
for married couples with children
has greatly expanded. All in all.
some I.SOO students and their fam
ilies will call the Village ''home"
winter quarter.â€”Joseph
