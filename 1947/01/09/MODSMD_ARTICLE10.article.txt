### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 8 (UP).—ln
the first major relaxation of rent j
controls, the government today lifted
ceilings on rooms rented on a day
to-day basis in transient hotels, mo
tor courts and tourist homes, effee- ;
tive Feb. 15.
A spokesman for the American j
Hotel Association said the action, j
taken by the office of temporary con- i
trols, would result in hotel operators !
adjusting guest-room rates "in di
rect relation to increased operating .
costs."
OTC administrator Major General |
Philip B. Fleming said that rent con- j
trols will be kept on rooms available
to weekly or monthly guests. He j
said decontrol of transient rooms will
go into effect as each hotel supplies j
OTC with a list of its permanent !
rooms.
Although the action was a break 1
in the rent control front, President |
Truman today asked Congress to j
continue general rent controls be- \
yond the present June 30 expiration
date.
J. E. Frawley, chairman of the- j
board of the hotel association, said J
most hotels were expected to keep [
present rates on low-cost rooms and '
to make most of the adjustments in j
higher-priced or luxury suites. The
association emphasized that there
will be no "across-the-board" in
creases in rates.
He said, however, that it is as im
portant to keep rent control on per
manent rooms "as it is to continue
our rent ceilings on apartments."
