# Slight Change in Farm Ratio With Winter Quarter Regging
## 
### 
Ratio computations have moved only slightly from fall quarter's 2.7
estimate; now there are approximately 2.K roughs per Stanford woman.
Seven thousand, one hundred twenty-three students have enrolled
at Stanford for the winter quarter. Of this number, 34 arc naval officers.
Of the remaining 7,1X9, men number 5.213 and women 1,87<5. The men's
enrollment has increased over the autumn figure, while the number of
women has fallen off by almost 100. The University expected an even
larger number of men, who were not released from the Army in time
to file necessary papers for re-entering.
Registration figures are not complete, and it is predicted that they
will rise to the fall quarter total as late students register.
