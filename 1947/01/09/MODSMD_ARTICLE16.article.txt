## 
### BOYD HAIGHT 
Looking back inlo his own mili
tary experience—experience that in
cludes artillery command of the 28th
or "Keystone" Division during the
European campaign of World War II
—Col. Basil H. Perry, new ROTC
commander at Stanford, reports that
college men invariably make the
best officers.
What does this mean to the col
lege man? It means that, the army
gives him the opportunity to obtain
a second lieutenant's commission in
the reserve at the same time he re
ceives his A.B. degree.
The colonel points to the reserve
officer's training program, the part
it lias played in the past, its mis
sion to provide an adequate re
serve officers' corps drawn from
the ranks of college men.
As professor of Military Science
and Tactics and commanding officer
of the Stanford POTC unit, Col.
Perry handles the program that of
fers the Stanford man—freshman or
veteran with two years to be com
pleted—a commission and a degree.
With a wide background in both
military and academic fields—a West
Point graduate in 1917, he received
his Master of Science degree in com
munications engineering at Yale
University after serving as a major
in World War I with the First Di
vision in France—Col. Perry comes
to Stanford after outstanding serv
ice during the last war.
Serving as a brigadier general lie
commanded the artillery of his di

vision through the Normandy cam- i
paign, the battles of Northern
France, and the break-through in- 1
to (iermany.
His division was one of the units j
which boie the brunt of the Ger- ;
man attack in the '"Battle of the ;
Bulge" in the Ardennes Forest.
Now concerned with enlarging the j
ROTC program at Stanford, Col. j
Perry brings* his battle lessons to '
the classroom.

The program he ofTeis to Stanford
men begins with two years of basic
courses—lectures on the world mili

taiy situation, military organization,
first aid, and the evolution of war
fare are supplemented with drill, ex
ercises, and instruction in the use of
individual weapons—after which the
student has a choice of four branches
for his advanced training.
Field Artillery, Quartermaster,
Ordnance or Air Corps specialized
instruction is offered the UOTC
student together with courses in
military problems, occupied terri
tories, and leadership,
Practical application of theory
comes in a six weeks summer camp.
The student will usually attend this
camp between the first and second
year of his advanced work, receiving
enlisted men's pay.
Men in the program receive a
complete issue of army clothing,
credit for physical education if in
the lower division, and an allow
ance of approximately $20 per
month.
The veteran who spent at least
one year in the ranks during
World War II may substitute his
war service for the basic program
and by completing the advanced
courses receive his commission in
two years.
Col. Perry's staff includes Col.
John P. Randolph, former comman
der of the unit who became Air
ROTC chief at Col. Perry's appoint
ment early in December.
Major W. R. Kugler, executive of
ficer, and a staff of four officers and
10 enlisted men complete the mili
tary complement of the Stanford
ROTC unit.
