## 
### 
Cost of installation ol crew as a minor sport at Stanford, trans
fer of $10,000 from ASSU funds to apply on the Memorial Theater
note, and the possibility of a wholesale resignation of Election
Board featured last night's meeting of the Executive Committee.
After brief debate, complete discussion of the report of thn
International Survey Committee and

revision of election procedures was
postponed until next week.
Bob Ayres, chairman of Election
Board, stated that he and virtually
all members of the Board hope to
be relieved of their duties aa soon as
possible. His statement followed a
request from President Martin An
derson for plans for winter elections.
The Constitution calls for an elec
tion early in winter quarter. Up for
election will be yell leaders and cer
tain SA.C., Men's Council and Wo
men's Council positions as well as
approval of changes in election pro
cedures.
Carl Burke, Men's Row member
and head of the Election Committee,
of Excom, will make a full presenta
tion of projected changes in election
methods in the next meeting.
PROPOSED ELECTION" CHANGES
Briefly, these changes include:,
1) Modification of the preferential
system so that only three or four
candidates would appear on the final ,
preferential ballot. Others would be
eliminated in a prior nominating
election.
2) Provisions for controlled elec
tioneering to stimulate student in
terest in elections.
3) Elimination of too rigid pro
cedural provisions from the Consti
tution to allow more flexibility in
election administration.
Costs of establishment of crew at.
Stanford brought out, a conflict, in
estimates between those of Gradu
ate Manager A 1 Masterg and Loo
Lindscy and Stan Cumberpatch,
coach and captain of the crew, re
spectively.
CONFLICTING CREW ESTIMATES
lit reply to a letter based on Ex
com's approval of crew last quarter,
Mr. Masters estimated the initial cost,
of placing crew at Stanford on a
plane with that of California at
$100,000. Lindsey's estimate was ap
proximately one-third that amount.
Cal's yearly crew budge*, for all
expenses amounts to about $30,000,
j said Lindsey, and if Stanford is suc
j cessful in obtaining shells and equip
: ment from schools giving tip crew
and obtaining free launches and ma
terial from the navy, crew could be
set up as a minor sport for a fraction
of that amount.
Further discussion was tabled un
til next week when Mr. Masters re
turns from the East.
ALLEN GIVES REPORT
Neil Allen, head of the Interna
tional Survey Committee, comment
ed briefly on the Chicago Student.
Conference and promised a full re
port next week. Allen, Bill Slocutn,
Mai ilyn Sidwell, and Nancy Alden,
Farm delegates, have not yet corre
lated all the material obtained in the
different panel discussions they at
tended and mimeographed material

Allen hoped for more applications
from students wishing to travel
abroad this summer as Stanford rep
resentatives.
"There must be widespread stu
dent interest to make this thing
work." he said.
LATK LEAVES LIBERALIZED

late leaves as proposed by Women's
Conference was approved by Excom.
