So many times students miss the boat —the
very best boat by neglecting to keep open
their eyes and ears, or by the inertia which
results from too much unselective listening or
unobservant watching. Until Feb. 3, Daily an
nouncements and the campus grapevine will
carry news of a vast opportunity for students
to do good—to themselves, to Stanford, and
to understanding among students everywhere.
Lest you miss it, we are right now pulling it
into the edit columns for a wider view.
What's in it for you? Your A.S.S.U. govern
ment is offering to send a select number of
students abioad next summer, with expenses
paid, itineraries mapped, and a list of worth
while persons to meet and kno//. Vou might
visit Palestine, France, Yugoslavia. England
my country where significant thinking and
.-vents are occumncj
What's in it for Stanioid? With the initia
tion of this student sponsored program may
come a very real counter-stimulus to the prev
alent, a'most wholesale provincialism of our
student body, by providing information first
hand of conditions in far-off and dissimilar
countries. Our representatives moreover
would carry the news outside that Stanford is
more than academically concerned with inter
national relations, and sincere in wanting to
lend its efforts to world peace.
What would your trip do for international
understanding? Time and again, as at last
summer's Prague student conference, stu
dents of foreign countries have made a heart
felt plea for understanding of their spiritual
and intellectual problems, rather than a super
ficial offering to their physical needs. Your

going abroad would give them a boost of opti
mism that this understanding may one day be
achieved. And we are confident that you, on
your return, would have this discovery to re
port—that despite surface differences, and
false assumptions, and varying conditions,
persons everywhere have much the same ba
sic obectives for study and living. That discov
ery, when it becomes belief, is wonderful to
share. Wars are rarely fought among nations
whose people are in sympathy.
What gualifications are necessary? Aside
from the letter requirements (a junior, senior,
or graduate student with a creditable aca
demic record who will return to Stanford next
autumn) there are only these:
You must not apply for the free ride, or the
publicity, or because you want to get into ex
tra curricula: activities You must apply with
a belief in your own ability to understand, to
know people, to observe sensitively youi sur
roundings. You must be a person able to com
plete an assignment in such matters and to
report your observations comprehensively to
the entire student body. You must be willing
to give over a great deal of your time and in
terests to the program for no other reason than
that you believe in it.
This is a boat you don't want to miss, if
you're the right person. And upon the very
right persons depend the worth of this A.S.
S.U. program which we hope is the point of
departure for the major student-sponsored
activities in Stanford's hereafter, but which we
sincerely believe to be Excom's most signifi
cant step forward during this academic year.
How to apply is discussed at length on page
one of today's Daily.
