## BULL SESSION 
### 
(Coughlin has enough wild stories to fill
only two columns a week, so Daily Editorial
Board opens the job of co-Bull Sessioner to a
campus-wide competition. If you wish the
job, please submit a minimum of two trial col
umns—about 50 typewritten lines in length—
to the Editor as soon as possible. Best among
the trial columns will be printed; the job will
be awarded to him who wins the most ap
plause. The hours are short, the atmosphere
is gay, and the column is yours.—Editorial
note.)
As I was sitting in Longbarn (the foregoing is an
unpaid political advertisement which I consider
worth at least one 5 beer) last night, ye editor ap
proached me with gleam in eye.
"Touching and tender farewell column you wrote
last quarter." she said, pulling up a bartender and
sitting down.
"Yes?" I ventured, smelling a rat.
She took the rat away from me and gave it to a
passing cat. "Lovely thing, that column, lovely,"
fih(j continued.■; , •
"Aha?" I .commettled, -sfq'nng rhy bech; thought
fully with my little toe. , '
"What are you doing down here?" she asked,
slyly changing the subject.
"Watching the birds behind the bar." She looked
shocked, so I explained I meant the live ones in the
big glass cage. They were Hying back and forth,
swinging on trapezes, and doing all the other things
birds behind a bar do to amuse themselves of a long
winter's evening.
Three imbibers had already fled screaming from
the establishment when they discovered an upside
down parrot leering at them over the bartender's
shoulder.
"What are YOU doing down here?" my insistent

female friend repeated, since I obviously wasn't
swinging upside-down from a trapeze.
"Waiting," I informed her, "to register. I am
going to stay right here until all the lines clear up.
At $2 a day for late registration plus $17.23 for beer,
it is well worth it to avoid that howling mob."
"There weren't any big lines or howling mobs,"
she said.
"Mac," I observed, "you are full of Daily propa
ganda. It was Reg Day, therefore howling mobs. It
ALWAYS happens. I have been here for two weeks.
And what was that big line outside the door?"
"Rose Bowl tickets," she said.
"Oh." I exclaimed and changed toes without .spill
ing a drop.
"Why here?" she asked.
"I have the concession." I explained.
"What concession?"
"I am the man who cleans out the bird cage be
hind the bar every night." I pointed out proudly.
"I'm working my way through college. And there's
room for advancement. I expect soon to have a
similar concession at the Tuesday Evening Series.
I, got my experience in the pre-war R.0.T.C."
"Oh," she said, quickly changing the subject.
"How would you like to come back to the fold and
do a few columns for us now and then?"
"What's it worth?" I asked. "Bob Hope has of
fered me $5,000 to quit writing. Can't stand the
competition."
"I'll buy your 'beer and register •fdj- vou," she
promised.
"Done," I agreed. "Send a car down for me and
I shall return. Life here is getting dull. To hell
with the birds."
So I rescind my touching farewell and return
again to pour acid in your morning coffee. But you
lucked out this quarter. Only twice a week will you
be blessed with the drivelings of my mother's favor
ite idiot. I'm taking a marriage course and will be
much too busy with my homework.
You know. Longbarn would be a lot more inter
esting if they took the birds out of those cages and
replaced them with rabbits.
See ya next Tuesday.

proached me with gleam in eye.
"Touching and tender farewell column you wrote
last quarter." she said, pulling up a bartender and
sitting down.
"Yes?" I ventured, smelling a rat.
She took the rat away from me and gave it to a
passing cat. "Lovely thing, that column, lovely,"
fih(j continued.■; , •
"Aha?" I .commettled, -sfq'nng rhy bech; thought
fully with my little toe. , '
"What are you doing down here?" she asked,
slyly changing the subject.
"Watching the birds behind the bar." She looked
shocked, so I explained I meant the live ones in the
big glass cage. They were Hying back and forth,
swinging on trapezes, and doing all the other things
birds behind a bar do to amuse themselves of a long
winter's evening.
Three imbibers had already fled screaming from
the establishment when they discovered an upside
down parrot leering at them over the bartender's
shoulder.
"What are YOU doing down here?" my insistent

female friend repeated, since I obviously wasn't
swinging upside-down from a trapeze.
"Waiting," I informed her, "to register. I am
going to stay right here until all the lines clear up.
At $2 a day for late registration plus $17.23 for beer,
it is well worth it to avoid that howling mob."
"There weren't any big lines or howling mobs,"
she said.
"Mac," I observed, "you are full of Daily propa
ganda. It was Reg Day, therefore howling mobs. It
ALWAYS happens. I have been here for two weeks.
And what was that big line outside the door?"
"Rose Bowl tickets," she said.
"Oh." I exclaimed and changed toes without .spill
ing a drop.
"Why here?" she asked.
"I have the concession." I explained.
"What concession?"
"I am the man who cleans out the bird cage be
hind the bar every night." I pointed out proudly.
"I'm working my way through college. And there's
room for advancement. I expect soon to have a
similar concession at the Tuesday Evening Series.
I, got my experience in the pre-war R.0.T.C."
"Oh," she said, quickly changing the subject.
"How would you like to come back to the fold and
do a few columns for us now and then?"
"What's it worth?" I asked. "Bob Hope has of
fered me $5,000 to quit writing. Can't stand the
competition."
"I'll buy your 'beer and register •fdj- vou," she
promised.
"Done," I agreed. "Send a car down for me and
I shall return. Life here is getting dull. To hell
with the birds."
So I rescind my touching farewell and return
again to pour acid in your morning coffee. But you
lucked out this quarter. Only twice a week will you
be blessed with the drivelings of my mother's favor
ite idiot. I'm taking a marriage course and will be
much too busy with my homework.
You know. Longbarn would be a lot more inter
esting if they took the birds out of those cages and
replaced them with rabbits.
See ya next Tuesday.
