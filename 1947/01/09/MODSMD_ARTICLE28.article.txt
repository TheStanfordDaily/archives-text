Veterans who wish to use their
terminal leave bonds as payment on
their National Service Life Insur
ance may now obtain the necessary
forms from the Veterans Adminis
tration office.
VA representatives are prepared
to help veterans in completing the
forms and give advice and infor
mation on how the bonds may be
assigned.
IN SUKA N C E P A YIVIE NTS
Bonds may be applied to insur
ance payments by assignment in the
following ways:
1. To pay premiums on insurance
already in force.
2. To purchase new insurance.
3. To reinstate lapsed insurance.
4. To pay the premium or any
difference in reserve required when
converting to a permanent insur
ance policy.
5. To repay policy loans made
prior to July 31.
Veterans who have not designated
beneficiaries of their insurance are
being urged 10 do so by the VA.
NEW LAW
VA points out that the new in
surance law passed by Congress last
August eliminated the provision for
an automatic order of succession
when beneficiaries have not been
designated by policy holders.
Under the new law, if the insured
is not survived by designated bene
ficiaries, the proceeds of his insur
ance will be paid in a single sum
to his estate.
PART OF ESTATE
As part of an estate, insurance
loses its identity as such and is sub
ject to all laws governing estates,
including claims of creditors, ad
ministrator's fees, and court ex
penses. In any event, VA says, the
veteran who fails to designate his
beneficiaries might expose his de
pendents to the unnecesary risk of
expense and delay.
The deadline for reinstating
lapsed permanent National Service
Life Insurance policies without a
medical examination has been ex
tended from Jan. 1, 1947, to Feb. 1,
