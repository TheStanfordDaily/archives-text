# Warren Urges Gas Fax Raise

### 
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 8 (UP).—
Governor Warren tonight reaf
firmed his determination to press
for an increase in gasoline taxes so
that California can get started on
an expanded highway development
program.
"We are going to have to raise
more money to build the kind of
highway system the people of our
state are demanding," the governor
said.
A special session of the Legisla
ture on highway problems has been
called Monday to run concurrently
with the 57th regular session. War
ren said the call will be "broad
enough so that the legislature can
take any action it considers neces
sary to the development of an ade
quate highway system in our state."
A nine-man joint interim com
mittee on highways has outlined a
4-year program and recommended
increased income to pay for it. But
two of the committee members—
Sen. Jack Tenney and ex-Assem
lyman Frank Waters, both Los
Angeles Republicans — filed a mi
nority report claiming there is no
need to increase any taxes to cover
increased highway expenses.
