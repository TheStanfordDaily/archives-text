## CARD STUNTS 
### 
Shades of Johnny Weissmuller
Stanford Natators Look Sharp
Sporting Card.r «.. r e on the loose again all over the Farm, and from the
looks of things after a quick survey of the campus arenas there'll be no
dearth of minor sports for Stanfordites this quarter.
Swim master Tom Haynie was warming up around the little gas stove
in the shack by the pool, and was he warming up. The way he figures the
Indians will show up with tin- hottest swim team in ages, and remember
ing the way the Cardinals captured the PCC water-polo crown last quar
ter. he should be right.
Last year Stanford had only one man to represent them at the NCAA
championships at Yale, and that was Bob Anderson who won the 50-yard
free-style race and a place on the NAAU swim team.

It's going to be a slightly differ
ent story this year. First of all
the NCAA meet will be held at
the University of Washington
pools, the first time this national
match has ever been held on the
Pacific Coast, and then Al Masters
hopes to be able to send about 7
or X Indian stars to Seattle for the
March 2N-2!) NCAA champion
ships. Tom Haynie feels sure that
Stanford can hold its own and beat
all but Ohio State in that meet.
The reason he feels that Ohio State
should place above Stanford is
that they provide diving scholar
ships at Ohio and have a healthy
aggregation of diving stars 011 their
team, while the Cards lack top
diving material.
One of the Indian stars. Fred Tai
oli, is down under in Australia now
competing in the Aussie champion
ship meets and gaining valuable ex
perience for the Farm squad. Other
sure-fire men for the squad are Bob

Anderson who holds several NAAU titles, Emmett Cashin who was high
scorer on last season's water polo team, and the brother combination of
Jack and A 1 Weeden. Jack won the '44 national outdoor 100-meter back
stroke championship, and Al was one of the water-polo team's top stars.
Key Kule will l>e captain of the swim team with two more new students
really going places and expected to do big things for the team. First ace
up Tom's sleeve is Tug Neville, a Los Angeles boy who swam for North
western and whose free-style speed is expected to give Boh Anderson
real competition, and Don Hester, who holds the PCX' 200-meter breast
stroke title and who placed fourth in the national outdoor championships
at San Diego last year.
Put it all together and what have you got? A well-balanced combina
tion of top swimming talent that can't help but go places for the Farm.

Boxing Picture Black
There's an air of mourning about the boxing room these days. And
Coach Clayton Frye has plenty of reason to wear black, too. It seems
there just aren't enough roughs around campus to fill the bantamweight,
featherweight, lightweight, and heavyweight spots on the Indian team, and
soon Frye's tears are going to flow like wine.
Later on this month Stanford will meet the Cal boxing team, and from
the stand of things right now, the Indians will have to default enough
matches to practically give away any chance of winning the meet. If
you can help out the team, you'll be more than welcome down at the
Gym's boxing ring just as soon as you can make it.
Incidentally, the all-University boxing tournament will be delayed a
few weeks because this season's schedule is starting earlier than usual,
and Coach Frye doesn't want the tournament and the intercollegiate com
petition to conflict with each other.

Indians Rise to New Heights
Stanford's Alpine Club members kept themselves mighty busy during
the holiday season, making a registered "first ascent" in the Yosemite area
among other things.
Al Baxter and Bud Gates climbed the YVatkins Pinnacles, the last major
unclimbed spires in the area, to establish themselves as the first men to
rcach these peaks. Starting 011 December 15, the two Indian climbers
pushed up from Mirror Lake to a high base camp at 8,000 feet near the
summit of Mt. Watkins, a peak on the the north wall of Tenaya Canon.
From here, on December 17, the climbing party made a descent of the
southwest arete including over 400 feet of roping down to reach the sad
dle connecting the two upper pinnacles with the sheer mountain wall.
Other vacation activities of the Club included a ski-mountaineering
ascent of Castle Peak, a 9,000-I'oot summit in the area, led by
Larry Taylor, and a second ascent of the Arrowhead spire in Yosemite on
a recently established route up the east face of the mountain, led by Fritz
Lippman and Al Baxter.

With both Bob find Boots Blatt lost to the Sun Valley ski team. Indian
racers will now be paced by Don Williams, a newcomer to Stanford ski
circles who did very well for the Farm at the intercollegiate races over
the holidays.
Don hails from Seattle and used to race for the University of Washing
ton team. At (lie intercollegiate meet he placed 20th in the downhill race
although he took a bad spill when another contestant blocked his way on
a narrow course and caused him to lose valuable seconds.

One of the Indian stars. Fred Tai
oli, is down under in Australia now
competing in the Aussie champion
ship meets and gaining valuable ex
perience for the Farm squad. Other
sure-fire men for the squad are Bob

Anderson who holds several NAAU titles, Emmett Cashin who was high
scorer on last season's water polo team, and the brother combination of
Jack and A 1 Weeden. Jack won the '44 national outdoor 100-meter back
stroke championship, and Al was one of the water-polo team's top stars.
Key Kule will l>e captain of the swim team with two more new students
really going places and expected to do big things for the team. First ace
up Tom's sleeve is Tug Neville, a Los Angeles boy who swam for North
western and whose free-style speed is expected to give Boh Anderson
real competition, and Don Hester, who holds the PCX' 200-meter breast
stroke title and who placed fourth in the national outdoor championships
at San Diego last year.
Put it all together and what have you got? A well-balanced combina
tion of top swimming talent that can't help but go places for the Farm.

Boxing Picture Black
There's an air of mourning about the boxing room these days. And
Coach Clayton Frye has plenty of reason to wear black, too. It seems
there just aren't enough roughs around campus to fill the bantamweight,
featherweight, lightweight, and heavyweight spots on the Indian team, and
soon Frye's tears are going to flow like wine.
Later on this month Stanford will meet the Cal boxing team, and from
the stand of things right now, the Indians will have to default enough
matches to practically give away any chance of winning the meet. If
you can help out the team, you'll be more than welcome down at the
Gym's boxing ring just as soon as you can make it.
Incidentally, the all-University boxing tournament will be delayed a
few weeks because this season's schedule is starting earlier than usual,
and Coach Frye doesn't want the tournament and the intercollegiate com
petition to conflict with each other.

Indians Rise to New Heights
Stanford's Alpine Club members kept themselves mighty busy during
the holiday season, making a registered "first ascent" in the Yosemite area
among other things.
Al Baxter and Bud Gates climbed the YVatkins Pinnacles, the last major
unclimbed spires in the area, to establish themselves as the first men to
rcach these peaks. Starting 011 December 15, the two Indian climbers
pushed up from Mirror Lake to a high base camp at 8,000 feet near the
summit of Mt. Watkins, a peak on the the north wall of Tenaya Canon.
From here, on December 17, the climbing party made a descent of the
southwest arete including over 400 feet of roping down to reach the sad
dle connecting the two upper pinnacles with the sheer mountain wall.
Other vacation activities of the Club included a ski-mountaineering
ascent of Castle Peak, a 9,000-I'oot summit in the area, led by
Larry Taylor, and a second ascent of the Arrowhead spire in Yosemite on
a recently established route up the east face of the mountain, led by Fritz
Lippman and Al Baxter.

With both Bob find Boots Blatt lost to the Sun Valley ski team. Indian
racers will now be paced by Don Williams, a newcomer to Stanford ski
circles who did very well for the Farm at the intercollegiate races over
the holidays.
Don hails from Seattle and used to race for the University of Washing
ton team. At (lie intercollegiate meet he placed 20th in the downhill race
although he took a bad spill when another contestant blocked his way on
a narrow course and caused him to lose valuable seconds.

Later on this month Stanford will meet the Cal boxing team, and from
the stand of things right now, the Indians will have to default enough
matches to practically give away any chance of winning the meet. If
you can help out the team, you'll be more than welcome down at the
Gym's boxing ring just as soon as you can make it.
Incidentally, the all-University boxing tournament will be delayed a
few weeks because this season's schedule is starting earlier than usual,
and Coach Frye doesn't want the tournament and the intercollegiate com
petition to conflict with each other.

Indians Rise to New Heights
Stanford's Alpine Club members kept themselves mighty busy during
the holiday season, making a registered "first ascent" in the Yosemite area
among other things.
Al Baxter and Bud Gates climbed the YVatkins Pinnacles, the last major
unclimbed spires in the area, to establish themselves as the first men to
rcach these peaks. Starting 011 December 15, the two Indian climbers
pushed up from Mirror Lake to a high base camp at 8,000 feet near the
summit of Mt. Watkins, a peak on the the north wall of Tenaya Canon.
From here, on December 17, the climbing party made a descent of the
southwest arete including over 400 feet of roping down to reach the sad
dle connecting the two upper pinnacles with the sheer mountain wall.
Other vacation activities of the Club included a ski-mountaineering
ascent of Castle Peak, a 9,000-I'oot summit in the area, led by
Larry Taylor, and a second ascent of the Arrowhead spire in Yosemite on
a recently established route up the east face of the mountain, led by Fritz
Lippman and Al Baxter.

With both Bob find Boots Blatt lost to the Sun Valley ski team. Indian
racers will now be paced by Don Williams, a newcomer to Stanford ski
circles who did very well for the Farm at the intercollegiate races over
the holidays.
Don hails from Seattle and used to race for the University of Washing
ton team. At (lie intercollegiate meet he placed 20th in the downhill race
although he took a bad spill when another contestant blocked his way on
a narrow course and caused him to lose valuable seconds.

Stanford Natators Look Sharp
Sporting Card.r «.. r e on the loose again all over the Farm, and from the
looks of things after a quick survey of the campus arenas there'll be no
dearth of minor sports for Stanfordites this quarter.
Swim master Tom Haynie was warming up around the little gas stove
in the shack by the pool, and was he warming up. The way he figures the
Indians will show up with tin- hottest swim team in ages, and remember
ing the way the Cardinals captured the PCC water-polo crown last quar
ter. he should be right.
Last year Stanford had only one man to represent them at the NCAA
championships at Yale, and that was Bob Anderson who won the 50-yard
free-style race and a place on the NAAU swim team.

It's going to be a slightly differ
ent story this year. First of all
the NCAA meet will be held at
the University of Washington
pools, the first time this national
match has ever been held on the
Pacific Coast, and then Al Masters
hopes to be able to send about 7
or X Indian stars to Seattle for the
March 2N-2!) NCAA champion
ships. Tom Haynie feels sure that
Stanford can hold its own and beat
all but Ohio State in that meet.
The reason he feels that Ohio State
should place above Stanford is
that they provide diving scholar
ships at Ohio and have a healthy
aggregation of diving stars 011 their
team, while the Cards lack top
diving material.
One of the Indian stars. Fred Tai
oli, is down under in Australia now
competing in the Aussie champion
ship meets and gaining valuable ex
perience for the Farm squad. Other
sure-fire men for the squad are Bob

Anderson who holds several NAAU titles, Emmett Cashin who was high
scorer on last season's water polo team, and the brother combination of
Jack and A 1 Weeden. Jack won the '44 national outdoor 100-meter back
stroke championship, and Al was one of the water-polo team's top stars.
Key Kule will l>e captain of the swim team with two more new students
really going places and expected to do big things for the team. First ace
up Tom's sleeve is Tug Neville, a Los Angeles boy who swam for North
western and whose free-style speed is expected to give Boh Anderson
real competition, and Don Hester, who holds the PCX' 200-meter breast
stroke title and who placed fourth in the national outdoor championships
at San Diego last year.
Put it all together and what have you got? A well-balanced combina
tion of top swimming talent that can't help but go places for the Farm.

Boxing Picture Black
There's an air of mourning about the boxing room these days. And
Coach Clayton Frye has plenty of reason to wear black, too. It seems
there just aren't enough roughs around campus to fill the bantamweight,
featherweight, lightweight, and heavyweight spots on the Indian team, and
soon Frye's tears are going to flow like wine.
Later on this month Stanford will meet the Cal boxing team, and from
the stand of things right now, the Indians will have to default enough
matches to practically give away any chance of winning the meet. If
