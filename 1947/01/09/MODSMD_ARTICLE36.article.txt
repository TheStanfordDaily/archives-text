# Farm 'Whiz Kids' Ready For 'Mural Hoop Play
## 
### 
Before a small but enthusiastic
turnout of 35 team managers. In
tramural Director Gene Coldiron
outlined a whirlwind intramural
basketball program in a meeting at
the S.A.C. yesterday afternoon. Al
though the initial sign-up list was
far below expectations of 65 or more
teams, the basketball leagues will
undoubtedly be filled out before
Monday's opening games.
Any prospective "whiz kids" who
wish to the intramural casaba
carnival should contact Gene Cold
iron immediately in his office, room
16 ofg the S.A.C. A registration
sheet will be available at all times
in room 16 until a suitable number
of teams have been entered. Mean
while. a nucleus of 31 teams will be
used to draw up a master schedule
which will be issued Monday.
Under the accelerated program
which will allow only 30 playing
days for the basketball leagues,
games will be played Monday
through Friday starting at 7 p.m.
THREE GAMES A NIGHT
Three games will be played each
night on both the Pavilion and
Men's Gym floors-, with the possi
bility of the use of the hardwood
at the Village Gym in case the
number of teams warrants it.
In fact, because of the great bas
ketball interest at the Village which
may result in 14 to 20 teams par
ticipating,, a separate Village intra
mural league might have to be used.
Then a World Series playoff be
tween the winners of the Village
and campus leagues would no doubt
wind up the season. Although this
plan would have its advantages in
solving the transportation problem
for Village intramural players, a
sprinkling of Village teams among
the various leagues would probably
keep the entire intramural program
more concise and interesting.
Director Coldiron also announced
that if the intramural games pro

duce a number of colorful teams,
those aggregations will be matched
as the preliminary feature to con
ference games at the Pavilion. Two
or three such contests have already
been scheduled. Also, the junior
varsity may meet the outstanding
intramural teams in preliminary
â– games:
NEED REFEREES
Thus the groundwork has been
laid for an extensive hoop season
which will furnish enjoyment for
more than 200 Stanford roughs. One
of the big problems remaining 1o be
solved is organization of a corps of I
referees to officiate at the games.
Wages for officials have been set at
51.50 a game, so here's a chance for
some men to pick up a little easy
cash. All men interested in officiat
ing at the games should contact
Gene Coldiron in his office at the
S.A.C.
