# Card Cagers Head South To Meet Favored Bruins
## 
### ART SHAIMRO 
An underdog Cardinal five will
be boarding the Coaster tonight
heading toward the lair of the U.C.-
L.A. Bruin. The Uclans, supposedly
the terror team of the Coast, ac
cording to the pre-season dope,
have had their private little pub
licity balloon punctured by defeats
suffered at the hands of N.Y.U. and
Santa Clara, but they still are the
odds-on favorites for their two
clashes with the Indians on Fri
day and Saturday evenings.
The Red Machine, basketball ver
sion, returned to their "Happy
Hunting Grounds" licking the
wounds administered to them on
their recent Eastern trip by Michi
gan, Michigan State. Bradley Tech,
Hamline, Kansas, and Denver.
Besides the drubbings the varsity
also picked up a lot of savvy, know
how and, most important, plenty of
experience. The green team that
left Palo Alto in the middle of De
cember returned in January, smart
er, and smarting for a few upsets
and a chance to make a decent
showing against the opposition of
fered by the Southern Division
teams.
The hoopsters are not making
the trip to Westwood just for
laughs. As Coach Ev Dean put it,
"We're going down there to play
basketball, and we're not going to
be coming back empty-handed."
The team is at its physical and
mental peak. The defeats have
hardened and rounded the squad
into a well-functioning and smooth
operating aggregation. For the first
time since the season began the
Cardinals have their work cut out
for them and know exactly how
they're going to go about it.
Perhaps the tip-off on the abil
ities of the Indians came 011 I)ee.
::<) when they faced a powerful
Kansas University live in Kaycee,
Mo., and went down to the wire
in a flurry, only to succumb, 54-
52. The following evening the
story was the same as the Stan
ford cagers dropped a one-point
decision to Denver University, 17-
4X. One rim shot in instead of out
and the complexion of the game,
and of the road trip itself, would

have been radically altered. One
rim shot in, tomorrow or Satur
day evening, and the Indians will
be coming over the mountains
loaded with Bruin.
The varsity has been working out
daily in the Pavilion, perfecting its
defense with an eye toward halt
ing the Uclan speedsters, Davage
Minor and Don Barksdale. The
squad has also been touching up the
rough spots on the offense, and has
been drilling on the fundamentals
of ball handling, passing, and shoot
ing. attempting to improve the field
goals completed percentage which
at present is somewhere in the mid
dle twenties.
The starting quintet which will
take to the floor against the
Bruins will include Dave David
son, Morley Thompson, Dick Ber
lin, Bill Stephenson, and Babe
Iliggins. The rest of the squad
which will catch the train at 7
tonight for the trip south will be
Milt Iverson, Bill Drehohl, Bobby
Lewis, Gus Chavalas, Jack Wood,
Ralph Carver, and Bill Christian
sen.
