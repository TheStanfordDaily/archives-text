### 
NEW YORK. Jan. 8 (UP).-Alvin
J. Paris, the Broadway sport with a
crooked scheme to fix a world [
championship professional football j
game, was found guilty on two J
counts of attempted bribery in gen- |
eral sessions court today.
A jury of ten men and two worn- ]
en judged Paris guilty of offering
Frank Filehock, star of the New
York Giants, to throw their game
with the Chicago Bears last Dec. 15.
The possibility that Hapes was an
accomplice of Paris was injected
into the trial at the last minute by
Judge Saul S. Streit in his charge
to the jury. He said the jury was
to determine the question of fact of
whether Hapes was an accomplice
in establishing his credibility as a
witness.
Hapes testified yesterday that he
had arranged meetings between
Paris and Filehock, and Judge Streit
told the jury that one who "under
takes negotiations" in connection j
with such a crime must be consid
ered an accomplice.
The jury deliberated one hour
and five minutes.
Paris faces a maximum punish
ment of 10 years in prison and $10.- j
000 fine.
