NEW YOHK, Jan. 8 (UP). Vot
ing to seek legislation which would
make gambling conspiracy a fed
eral offense, the NCAA ended a
three-day "purity in sports" meet
ing today by adopting a strict live
principle athletic code which boy
cotts non-conformists.
Hinting that a "black list" of vio
lators of the rigid amateur code
would be issued, the NCAA sought

lege athletics—particularly football
—with this program:
Strict amateurism; institutional
control and responsibility; sound
academic standards; strict govern
ing of financial aids to athletes, and
tight supervision of recruiting.
The recruiting clause was fought
by Southern delegates, but finally
was passed by a vote of 71! to 33. Il
reads:
"No member of an athletic staff
or other official representative of
athletic interests shall outside the
boundary of his own campus so
licit the attendance at his institution
of any prospective students; nor
shall he, whether on or off the cam
pus, be permitted to offer financial
