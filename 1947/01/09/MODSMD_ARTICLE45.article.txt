others interested meet at the Stan

mercials, station breaks, and run
the control board, spin records, and

in most non-network stations.
Later, students may receive uni
versity credit for the work. Stu
dents accepted for positions as an
nouncer-operators will be assigned
two or three shifts per week, each
shift running two or three hours.
The station is on the air from 7 to j

include remote broadcast work, an
nouncing dance bands, acting as
master of ceremonies at quiz shows,
round tables, and news features.

—especially classical and smooth
swing—be mailed to tlu-in.
Rob Peck, advertising director,
