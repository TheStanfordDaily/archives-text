# Losses Still High On Cellar Walkouts
## 
### 
Cellar walkouts continue to he
high though they are a little low
er than last spring quarter. The
lo.ss averages about $10 or $12 a
day, with more at the end of the
quarter usually.
Since the Cellar policy is to
keep the cost down as much as
possible for the benefit of the .stu
dents, the loss of so much money
per day makes it necessary to
make up the deficit from their
funds.
The Honor Code Committee
has been consulted on the mat
ter but since they have jurisdic
tion mainly over examinations
they have returned the matter
to the Fundamental Standard
under the jurisdiction of the in
dividual.
