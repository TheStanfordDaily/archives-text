### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 (UP).—
The Senate speedily and unani
mously confirmed Gen. George C.
Marshall as Secretary of State today
and assured the world that "unity
still prevails" on American foreign
policies.
On the initiative of the now chair
man of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, Republican Arthur H.
Vandenberg of Michigan, the cham
ber completed committee consider
ation and its final confirmation of
his appointment in one hour.
Vandenberg used the occasion to
pledge the Republican party—now
in control of Congress—to carry on
the bi-partisan foreign policy under
Marshall.
Initial reports of reaction abroad
to the sudden and unheralded
switch in directors of foreign pol
icy disturbed oflicials here. Those
reports reflected anxiety and an
ticipated changes in policy.
Sentiment prevailed here, how
ever. that there would be no change
in fundamental policies. Senators
and Congressmen were counting
upon this.
The change is not expected to
alter U.S. foreign policy. Toward
the Soviet Union—the most contro
versial part of foreign policy during
Byrnes' tenure—the United States
will continue to present a "firm but
patient" front.
Appointment of Marshall, how
ever, will place a high American
soldier as the top American nego
tiator with the Russians. It is well
known that the Soviets have tre
mendous respect for military men
and the strength they represent.
Chinese liberal leaders today
bailed Gen. George C. Marshall's
appointment as new U.S. Secre
tary of State as opening a new
era for China in her relations
with the United States.
Former Secretary of State James
F. Byrnes will make his first public
address since his resignation at the
21st annual institute of the Council
on World Affairs here Saturday
night, it was announced today.
