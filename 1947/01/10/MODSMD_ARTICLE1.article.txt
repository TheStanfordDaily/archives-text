## House Gets Bill On Closed Shop 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. !) (UP).—
Rep. Francis Case, R., S.D., put be- j
fore the House today a far-reaching |
program to halt strikes endangering j
the public welfare, outlaw the
closed shop, and make workers [
equally responsible with employers i
under the National Labor Relations j
Act
Simultaneously, the Congress of j
Industrial Organizations sent indi- |
vidual appeals to all members of j
Congress to refrain from "engag- j
ing in witch hunts against the or- j
ganizations of the nation's work- j
its," and to concentrate, instead, on I
enacting legislation to meet "the!
basic economic and social needs of I
the American people."
Case, whose anti-strike bill was
vetoed by President Truman last i
year, introduced legislation which ,
would authorize the government 1
to seek injunctions against strikes
"in essential monopolized service
or industry" which threaten pub- ;
l» welfare. Such steps could not
be taken, however, until all other
means of strike settlement had
been tried and failed.
The injunction issue will come ]
before the Supreme Court Tuesday
when arguments begin in the gov
ernment's contempt case against
John L. Lewis and his United Mine I
Workers (AFL). which grew out of
the recent coal strike. Lewis and j
the union challenged the govern- i
ment's right to obtain a restraining
order to avert the walkout.
Case proposed to give the At
torney General the right to apply
for injunctions without taking the
preliminary step of seizing a
strike-bound industry. His bill
also would:
1 Grant individual states un
questioned authority to ban closed i
shop contracts.
2. Amend the National Labor Re- j
lations Act so workers may be cited .
for unfair labor practices.
3. Grant individual employers the j
l ight to choose their represents- ;
tives in collective bargaining. Case j
said this provision could be used to i
avoid industry-wide bargaining.
4. Guarantee employers the right
to discuss union affairs with their
employees, providing the discus
sions did not involve coercion.
5. Give the Attorney General au
thority to file unfair labor practice
charges against employers or work
ers.

enacting legislation to meet "the!
basic economic and social needs of I
the American people."
Case, whose anti-strike bill was
vetoed by President Truman last i
year, introduced legislation which ,
would authorize the government 1
to seek injunctions against strikes
"in essential monopolized service
or industry" which threaten pub- ;
l» welfare. Such steps could not
be taken, however, until all other
means of strike settlement had
been tried and failed.
The injunction issue will come ]
before the Supreme Court Tuesday
when arguments begin in the gov
ernment's contempt case against
John L. Lewis and his United Mine I
Workers (AFL). which grew out of
the recent coal strike. Lewis and j
the union challenged the govern- i
ment's right to obtain a restraining
order to avert the walkout.
Case proposed to give the At
torney General the right to apply
for injunctions without taking the
preliminary step of seizing a
strike-bound industry. His bill
also would:
1 Grant individual states un
questioned authority to ban closed i
shop contracts.
2. Amend the National Labor Re- j
lations Act so workers may be cited .
for unfair labor practices.
3. Grant individual employers the j
l ight to choose their represents- ;
tives in collective bargaining. Case j
said this provision could be used to i
avoid industry-wide bargaining.
4. Guarantee employers the right
to discuss union affairs with their
employees, providing the discus
sions did not involve coercion.
5. Give the Attorney General au
thority to file unfair labor practice
charges against employers or work
ers.
