## 
### 
Bob Ayres, retiring chairman of
the Election Board, staled yesterday
in a brief interview tlint he thought
changes in the A.S.S.U. election
system were necessary to avoid dif
ficulties.met in, the past.
Although he would not definitely
support ;iny one particular program
for improvement, such as those rec
ommended by Carl Burke's Election
Committee, because there arc "pros
and cons on all of the suggestions"
made so far, he did say the present
system was outmoded.
He commented that there had been
too many instances in elections
where overcrowded ballots had de
feated the purpose of representative
government.
"Some voters check I lie ballot
diagonally with obviously no
knowledge of who they were vot
ing for nor any preference," he
said.
He supported the idea of a modi

fication of the preferential system by
which a final ballot would carry only
! three or four names, however, he
â–  emphasized the hazard of having too
j many preliminary elections.
Experience shows, he said, that
the more elections held, the fewer
voters (urn out.
President Martin Anderson staled
yesterday that no one has been sin
gled out as a possible nominee for
the chairmanship of the Election
j Board. The situation is expected to
be clarified within the next few days,
j however.
Changes in the election procedure
that have been recommended are as
{ follows:
1. A limit of four names 011 the
(inal ballot.
2. Controlled electioneering.
More flexibility in procedural
provisions.
Further action is pending until
i the next Excom meeting.
