Plans lor Stanford's International Survey Committee program
took definite form last night when Neil Allen, I.S.C. head, ex
plained how the organization would choose representatives to |
make proposed trips abroad.
Although final approval depends on Excom, it is presumed
that the recommendations made by Allen will be accepted.

The plans call for a Board of Six ,
made up of liner faculty members i
and three students to consider the >
applicants and determine who sliall :
make the trips.
The purpose of I he I.S.C. is to
send a number of Stanford stu
dents abroad to make separate
summer tours to observe political,
cultural, economic and social con
ditions in general. They will visit
universities, meet political leaders,
interview people in different walks
of life as much as possible, in.nl try
to get a picture of people, places
and things in foreign lands.
The Board of Six will make selee
: lions based on activity and academic
| records, personal interviews and es
j says on the subject, "What I believe
can he accomplished that will he
| beneficial to the student hotly by
I making a student survey and my
I opinions as to the purposes and poli
cies of the survey organization."
APPLICANTS DGADMNK
Deadline for applicants is Feb. 3
when the essay and records will both
be due. Applications will be receiv
ed until that dale on Monday, Wed
nesday and Friday from 1 to 2 p.in.
in the A.S.S.U. office.
President Martin Anderson stat
i ed that students will be required
! to make y report to the student
body on their return.
Besides that report which will be
made in Memorial Hall at a uetieral
! meeting, the Stanford representa

' full written report to the student
president's office and to the Stanford
Daily.
FINANCE PI .A X
Funds for the program have not as
! yet been voted by Ex.com, but a plan
! of financing both for this year and
i future years will be presented dur
j ing this quarter.
Adequate funds to cover all ex
j ponscs will be granted those students
who are appointed to make the trips.
No definite number of rcpresen
i talives has been decided upon as
that will depend on the amount
i assigned by Ivveom to the program.
When this is determined, the Board
! of Six will select "three times the
| number" to make the trips from the
j applicants. From these, the board
j will then choose the representatives
i plus two or three alternates.
NOT DEFINITE
As vet, no definite plans have been

1 made ;ts to exactly where the stu
j dents will go or whom they will
meet. Within a few weeks, however,
! Ed. Sammons, head of the toreign
subcommittee of the will an
j nounce the completed program.
Final choice of areas to he visit
ed will lie determined after further
investigation of Palestine, France, |
England, Cireece, Germany, Yugo
slavia. and conditions there.
Besides giving reports, .students
j who make the trips will be called on
j to make various speeches i" regard
to their travels and experiences.
They will become very important
! members of the Stanford J.S.C., and
it will be their rye-witness reports
on which future action by the com
; mittee will be based, according to
! Allen.
MUST RETURN
Because of this, i f i' ; necessary that â€¢
applicants plan to return to the uni
| versity after next summer, either as
undergraduates or graduate students.
The idea of student travel abroad
is designed to bring a clearer under
l standing of the people in foreign
I lands to university students.
The I.S C. was started last spring
shortly after the election of An
derson to the oniee of student body
president. Headed by Allen, the
committee is divided into three
subcommittees, directed by the
following: Martin Cooper, manage
ment; Nada SUidmore, publicity;
Ed Sammons, foreign.
The organization was approved by
! Excom Nov. lit, 1946.
Passports, visas and other arrange
ments necessary for the trip will be
; i made by Summons' subcommittee.
Further information will be rc
' leased in the Daily as it develops.
