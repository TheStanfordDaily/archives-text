a House speech.

strategy conference to decide how
they will handle the President's
budget.
Chairman John Taber. It, N.Y.,
of the House Appropriations Com
mittee, told reporters afterward
that be was convinced Congress
could bold appropriations down to
$29,100,000,000 in the next fiscal
year. That was believed to be
several billions under what Mr.
Truman regards as the rock-bot
tom budget level.
TAFT COMMENTS
Sen. Robert A. Taft, R., 0.. one
of the principal architects of the
Republican legislative program, said
tonight that Congress should
squeeze three or four billion dol
lars out of President Truman's
budget for the next fiscal year.

recommendation that income taxes
be held at present levels but agreed
that cxcise tax rates should be held
at wartime levels for another year.

personal income taxes
Reminding that the President
would send his budget message
to Congress tomorrow. Taft said it
was reported to call for the ex
penditure of more than $37,000,-
000,000 in the fiscal year begin
ning next July 1. including $11.-
000,000.000 for the armed forces.
"In my opinion, without cutting
the armed services, wc should be
able to squeeze from three to four
billion dollars out of that budget so
that our total expenditures do not
exceed $33,500,000,000." Taft said.
