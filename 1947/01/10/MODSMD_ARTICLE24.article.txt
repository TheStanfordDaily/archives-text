### HELEN PINKERTON 
(After Consultation With Stanford Women)
Well. I didn't have a date for the Reg Dance
and was I mad! All these Stanford men float
ing around and me minus an escort. I haven't
had a ddte for so long that I'm beginning to
think man's only use is as cover for a barstool.
But believe me I won't take this situation sit
ting down (can't anyway—l went skiing dui
ing vacation). I'm expecting great things to
happen soon. Why I may even have a date
this week-end If I do snag some BTO I'm
really going to plaster myself with my new
Christinas perfume—"Smudge pot Sensation. 1 '
They tell me it puts men in a tog Ah! At last
iu remove my veil!)
My last date at Stanfoid was duiing fall
: i ials All the othei campus q t's were disen
■j,:g.ed so one of the big opera-tors buzzed me
i,:i a Saturday night at 8:30. ' Hi, Babe leave
us go out for a buttermilk. 1 ' Before 1 had a
• Tu.nce to accept his offer, 1 was in my skirt
and sweater and bouncing down the hall.
Johnny Joyboy,. well-known Alfalfa Chiote,
was waiting in the lobby when I came down
and we zoomed out to a glistening, new Cad.
1 hopped in and Johnny turned on the motor.
I turned mine on too. Then we sped away.
Johnny wheezed in my ear: "Gosh, Baby, you
do something to me." I wasn't sure whether
he m?ant that as a declarative or imperative
sentence. But then my train of thought was
broken as we made a garage out of a tele
phone pole on the road to a buttermilk estab

lishment on Portola Road. Johnny asked me
what I had signed out for. "Two o'clock," I
said. "Cood" says he,"The bars close at
twelve." I pondered what he had in mind.
We'd probably sit around and discuss "port
hole to port-hole" pay.
After a few short horns at the buttermilk
establishment we moved on to some cute little
tearoom in Woodside. . . .
At twelve they rolled up the rugs at the tea
room and we left. I was as poised as a Fresh
man after my evening of buttermilking. In
fact, I could walk a straight line without any
trouble, but Johnny said he had to concentrate
on two points in order to walk a straight line.
We drifted out to the car, but something puz
zled me. I've heard that at midnight the dead
sometimes come to life, but Johnny pulled a
new one. By twelve his two eyes had become
three
Like all Stanford women 1 like to diive
straight home, so we started off by way of
Skyline Boulevard. Johnny was such an in
teresting conversationalist and what an dth
let?! He said I seemed like the athletic type
too, but that he was especially impressed by
my intelligence. And so we talked of this and
that -primitive south-sea customs Johnny had
observed and modern American customs I
hadn't.
We headed for home when I suggested it
(the fourteenth time) and arrived just in time
for a lockout. Johnny gave me a friendly
handshake, handed me the keys to my Cad
and said "See ya on Quad sometime."
