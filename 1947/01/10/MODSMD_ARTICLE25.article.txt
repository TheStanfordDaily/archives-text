## HISTORY 1947 
### 
Today. President Truman will go before
Congress with his budget message for the
fiscal year 1947-48. The Republicans have al
ready predicted his proposals and begun to
disagree with them, but it is gratifying to note
how relatively minor are the points at issue.
I say relatively. The differences amount in
dollars to only a few billions and juggling
zeroes has been a popular Washington recrea
tion for some years now. The enactment of
the country's first billion-dollar budget, how
ever, is not beyond the memory of living men,
and the difference of a few billions of dollars
in the budget proposals could mean several
hundred dollars less in income taxes for large
numbers of individual Americans.
The differences reported so far are small;
the areas of agreement are large. Eoth sides,
apparently, are committed to economy. Neith
er party has demanded cuts in the appropria
tions for the armed services that are abso
lutely crippling. Instead, the cuts are to be
made at home. Senator Taft wants to squeeze
a few billions out of whatever the President
recommends, and seems to anticipate a larger
income. The difference, another few billions,
will be the margin allowing, the Republicans
say, for their announced 20 per cent reduction
in personal income taxes. Any surplus in the
administration's estimates, it is reported, will

be used for reduction of the national debt.
These, I said, were relatively minor differ
ences, but they are not unimportant differ
ences. This is a period of inflation; should the
government take deflationary measures? If
so, which is more conducive in the present
situation to deflation, to pay off some of the
national debt, or to reduce taxes? These are
all good questions.
So far the atmosphere surrounding the
budget has been cool and full of willingness
to compromise. While the Republicans are
still talking about a 20 per cent personal in
come tax reduction, there are reports that it is
more likely to be about 10 per cent. Neither
party, so far has come out for reductions in
corporation or excise taxes, and both, appar
ently, want to see the luxury taxes to be ended
by Truman's 'end-of-hostilities" proclamation
restored.
It was widely predicted that the Republican
victory in the last elections would mean two
years of bitter, partisan quarrels between the
Capitol and the White House. So far, barring
a few exulting shouts of victory from one side,
a few claims of "low blow" from the other, the
two parties have managed to agree on some
essential projects and to "agree to disagree"
like little gentlemen on the rest. How long
this honeymoon will last, I don't know, but,
as long as it lasts, I like it.
