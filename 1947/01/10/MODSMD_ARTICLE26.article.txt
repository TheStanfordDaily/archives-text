To the Editor:
Now that a football season which was successful
Irom the standpoint of both results and student body
support is virtually over, winter quarter will bring
a new basketball season. Judging from the turnout
at the first game, the basketball team promises to
receive at least its share ol student rooters also. But
already one element appears to be lacking—an ele
ment that lias been missing during previous Stanford
basketball seasons.
What cheering there was at the San Jose State
game had to he led by volunteers; there was no or
ganized rooting section because of the absence of a
qualified yell leader. This has invariably been the

ease at all mid-week non-conference games. Since
the present three-man yell-leading stall will pre
sumably devote considerable time to the conference
games on Fridays and Saturdays and may not,be able
to appear at the other games, the obvious solution
sterns to be to have more yell leaders'
The search for new cheer leaders a while ago re
vealed that there were several applicants with ap
proximately equal ability and spirit, but only three
choices were permitted at the election. If this was
due to the established policy of Rally Com as set by
tradition or constitutional provision, it is time that
the necessary changes were made to enable the elec
tion of a larger yell-leading staff. Stanford athletic
teams are entitled to all the organized backing that
the student body will give them. Such support
should not be limited because of an inadequate num
ber of yell leaders.
