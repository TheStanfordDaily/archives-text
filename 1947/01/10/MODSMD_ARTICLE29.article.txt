# French Enthusiasts To Organize Club
## 
### 
Students who speak French or
who wish to learn to speak French
now have an opportunity to join a
French Club which will meet for
the first time Monday at 4:15 p.m.
in the Nitery.
Since there are no conversation
courses offered, the club is being
planned to give students a chance
to use spoken French. Professor W.
L. Schwartz has approved the form
ing of the club, and Miss Nancy
Smith is in charge of the plans.
Cokes will be served at the meet
ing.
