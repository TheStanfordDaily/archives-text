WASHINGTON. Jan. 9 (UP).—
The United States reopened its at
tack on the political tactics of the
Polish government today by charg
ing the Russian-backed Warsaw re
gime with terrorizing and suppress
ing opposition parties in violation of
the Yalta and Potsdam agreements.
The American memorandum was
delivered to the Polish Foreign Of
fice today by U.S. Ambassador Ar
thur Bliss Lane.
It put the United States on record
as thoroughly displeased with the
measures taken by the Polish gov
ernment bloc to insure victory lor
itself in the elections scheduled for
Jan. 19.
"My government would be fail
ing in its duty if it did not again
point out that the continuation of
the present policy of suppression,
coercion and intimidation as applied
to political opposition in Poland
constitutes a violation of the letter
as well as the spirit of the Yalta
and Potsdam agreements," Lane's
note said.

LAKE SUCCESS. N.Y.. Jan. !)
(UP). —The United States and Rus
sia bumped head-on again today on
the issue of which comes first—the
horse of atomic energy or the cart
of disarmament —and the U.S. re
fused to budge an inch.
American delegate Herschel John
son told the United Nations Secu
rity Council that the U.S. will posi
tively not discuss general disarma
ment until "substantial progress" is
made on atomic energy control.
Johnson told the Council to put
"first things first" and consider
atomic control, "the most important
problem facing the civilized world."
Then, he said, "other phases of dis
armament will become a minor
problem."
Johnson flatly opposed a Russian
resolution for the Council to com
plete within DO days an over-all
program for junking all weapons
for mass destruction.
