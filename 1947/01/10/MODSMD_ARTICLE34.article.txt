## SLING TIME How to Have Nightmares; Just Try Tracing the Block S Society, if Any 
### 
The phone rings, and who should be at the other end but the President?
Harry? No. Donald? No. Marty. It seems some of the boys who uphold
the Cardinal on the field of sport are anxious to start a Block S Society.
Sounds like a good idea; there are numerous services such a group could
perform.
It's an honor to be asked to help in such a task, but it seemed a good
idea to know a little about the subject. There were some hangers-on
in the office at the time; I asked if there ever was such a society here
at Stanford. First man (who was here before the war) says there's
never been a Block S Society; just Circle S (minor sports). Second man
says there was and is. that it's functioning right now. Third man says
there used to be, but it went defunct before the war.
To Sgt. Slinger, who was taught to think scientifically by Dr. Snyder
in Western Civ., that didn't seem at all decisive, so he decided to call on
his editor for aid. However, there was a slight delay in reaching her
office; young Willie Coughlin was writing his first colyum of 1947 (after
swearing he was through) and the anteroom was hip-deep in people who
should have been somewhere else. They were peering over Coffee's
shoulder, reading the Bull as it came steaming hot off the typewriter.
After reading Hull Session I tripped merrily on into the Sanctum
Sanctorum of Lady Macßeth and her stooges. After I got up oil (he
floor I stated my problem in simple, one-syllable words so she'd he sure
to understand. Evidently I wasn't simple enough, because she just
rolled her eyes and said, "Ugglc uggle uggle!"
One of her stooges, a rather bright young lady who looks like Hamlet's
father, handed nie an old copy of the Frosh Guide. On thumbing through
the tome hurriedly 1 found that no mention was made of any past or pres
ent Block S Society. 1 thanked the nice people and said good-bye. Lady
Macßeth said, "Fight fiercely!" I dodged out as quickly as possible, taking
care to avoid a girl hanging from the ceiling by her feet, trying to get
close enough to Coughlin to ask lor his autograph.
Is, Was, Isn't, Wasn't —Who Knows?
Almost an hour had passed and my task was not furthered. It.seemed
to call for the advice of an Old Face, a fixture on the Stanford scene. I
picked up the phone (that's about all I seem able to pick up these days)
and called the oldest face I know. Don Liebendorfer. From him I learned
that either there was or was not a Block S Society in the past; the two
most influential clubs were Quadrangle and Snake and Skull, which were
not limited strictly to athletes. These clubs died some time ago.
By this time I was pretty sure that there is not now a Block S Society.
I had no proof; just a hunch. Naturally I wanted to know il there had
EVER been such an organization. Acting on another hunch (I have two
hunches, like a Camel), I dialed the number of the Quad to see if they
had complete file. They informed me it was complete with a few excep
tions, so I ambled over.
If the Daily office is a disgrace, the Quad quarters arc a stinking
scandal. I can't exactly tell you what the building looks like, except
that it should have a half-moon carved in the door. Outside is a home
made sign which says "QUAD OFFICE AND STUDIO." Some studio!
I stepped out of the pleasant, serene, sunshiny outdoors into the midst
of utter confusion. Papers were flying through the air, girls were scream
ing and biting their nails, and a renegade Daily U.P. editor was off in
the corner helping them publish their monstrosity. From the bulletin
board was hanging a lady's piyple glove (right, empty), suspended by a
thumb tack. I paused to look at the interesting murals, which must have
been painted (if that's the word) by a Dali reporter named Salvador.
She's Only an Octo, lint 11 hat a Pass!
One of the subjects was a girl whom I took to be Miss Quad. She
had arms and two heads which had three eyes apiece. Being rather
pressed for time, I didn't stop to count whatever else she may or may
not have had. Coming toward me, stumbling over the refuse and offal,
was an office flunky.
Alter I had stated my problem succinctly, he directed me to the files
in sign language, pausing first to give thirty lashes to a lissome lass who
had thoughtlessly stopped screaming. I ran a spot-check on the Quad all
the way back to ICO2, but nowhere was there a mention ol Bl'ock S. Circle
S. yes. Block S, no. That seemed to indicate—to me. at least —that if ever
the Block S Society existed, it was most unofficial.
By this time my feet were quite cold. The floor of the Quad office
is made of concrete, and it slopes on all sides toward a central drain.
This lent credence to my original impression; namely, that the building
had formerly been a king-size outhouse —wood, not brick.
Seeing an open campfire in the editor's office, I wended my way thence
to toast my frozen feet. The editor was at his desk. Tossing a washed-out
blonde off his lap and into the fire, he rose to meet me. Sadly I realized
that he was an old fraternity brother of mine who had gone astray. I
shall call him John Doe; it's kinder that way. I wouldn t want his family
to discover that he's connected with the Quad. «
I informed John of the futility of my search. "Gah-dammit, you re
crazy." lie snarled, showing me a list of the clubs that were to have
their pictures in this year's Quad. Sure enough, there il was. the Block
S Society. He also had Circle S on the list. Finally I convinced him that
Block S does not exist now, and seemingly never did. He bowed his
head. As I left the office I heard him mutter. "For crissakcs, who's
gonna pay for their page?" Money-mad to the last.
I\o Joking, We Need a Block S Societyr
That completed my research into the matter of Block S. so you all can
see that I'm well qualified to offer advice and comment. Seriously, though,
1 think it's a fine idea. Winners of a Block S have something in common,
and should belong to some sort of permanent organization. They could
act as a board of experts on athletics to Excom, which will have some
weighty decisions to make in the future.
For instance, what sort of award should be given in the senior year
t<» those athletes like Mickey Titus who were good enough to make
their marks ;is freshmen? What should be done about the agitation to
make swimming a major sport? Such problems arc legion.
Every other major sport I know of has a comparable society. One of
the things they do is distribute copies of the school annual to high schools
which normally turn out good athletes; that could be a factor in getting a
winning team. There are many little duties such a group could perform,
and Stanford should not be without one.
Marty Anderson should be congratulated for setting the ball rolling—
but lie should have help. He's a very busy lad, what with two major
sports, the student body presidency, and his studies. A meeting has
been called for 7:.'10 Thursday evening; all Block S winners should at
tend and offer any aid they can. The tentative meeting place is Cubber
ley Auditorium.
I hope you don't think I mean .such a group should become involved
in campus politics; that's something for all students together. But on
matters pertaining to sports they certainly should have a voice. In this
day of high-pressure college sports, the athletes themselves are all-too
often ignored, or treated as chattels. This should not be; sports should be
fun, not work. We have a pretty good system here at Stanford; I think
a Block S Society might help keep it that way.
Ted Norton, the Historian, on being advised of my tribulations, came
up with a solution. He says if a Block S Society ever existed it must have
left funds with the A.S.S.U. Marty, check your files.

Sounds like a good idea; there are numerous services such a group could
perform.
It's an honor to be asked to help in such a task, but it seemed a good
idea to know a little about the subject. There were some hangers-on
in the office at the time; I asked if there ever was such a society here
at Stanford. First man (who was here before the war) says there's
never been a Block S Society; just Circle S (minor sports). Second man
says there was and is. that it's functioning right now. Third man says
there used to be, but it went defunct before the war.
To Sgt. Slinger, who was taught to think scientifically by Dr. Snyder
in Western Civ., that didn't seem at all decisive, so he decided to call on
his editor for aid. However, there was a slight delay in reaching her
office; young Willie Coughlin was writing his first colyum of 1947 (after
swearing he was through) and the anteroom was hip-deep in people who
should have been somewhere else. They were peering over Coffee's
shoulder, reading the Bull as it came steaming hot off the typewriter.
After reading Hull Session I tripped merrily on into the Sanctum
Sanctorum of Lady Macßeth and her stooges. After I got up oil (he
floor I stated my problem in simple, one-syllable words so she'd he sure
to understand. Evidently I wasn't simple enough, because she just
rolled her eyes and said, "Ugglc uggle uggle!"
One of her stooges, a rather bright young lady who looks like Hamlet's
father, handed nie an old copy of the Frosh Guide. On thumbing through
the tome hurriedly 1 found that no mention was made of any past or pres
ent Block S Society. 1 thanked the nice people and said good-bye. Lady
Macßeth said, "Fight fiercely!" I dodged out as quickly as possible, taking
care to avoid a girl hanging from the ceiling by her feet, trying to get
close enough to Coughlin to ask lor his autograph.
Is, Was, Isn't, Wasn't —Who Knows?
Almost an hour had passed and my task was not furthered. It.seemed
to call for the advice of an Old Face, a fixture on the Stanford scene. I
picked up the phone (that's about all I seem able to pick up these days)
and called the oldest face I know. Don Liebendorfer. From him I learned
that either there was or was not a Block S Society in the past; the two
most influential clubs were Quadrangle and Snake and Skull, which were
not limited strictly to athletes. These clubs died some time ago.
By this time I was pretty sure that there is not now a Block S Society.
I had no proof; just a hunch. Naturally I wanted to know il there had
EVER been such an organization. Acting on another hunch (I have two
hunches, like a Camel), I dialed the number of the Quad to see if they
had complete file. They informed me it was complete with a few excep
tions, so I ambled over.
If the Daily office is a disgrace, the Quad quarters arc a stinking
scandal. I can't exactly tell you what the building looks like, except
that it should have a half-moon carved in the door. Outside is a home
made sign which says "QUAD OFFICE AND STUDIO." Some studio!
I stepped out of the pleasant, serene, sunshiny outdoors into the midst
of utter confusion. Papers were flying through the air, girls were scream
ing and biting their nails, and a renegade Daily U.P. editor was off in
the corner helping them publish their monstrosity. From the bulletin
board was hanging a lady's piyple glove (right, empty), suspended by a
thumb tack. I paused to look at the interesting murals, which must have
been painted (if that's the word) by a Dali reporter named Salvador.
She's Only an Octo, lint 11 hat a Pass!
One of the subjects was a girl whom I took to be Miss Quad. She
had arms and two heads which had three eyes apiece. Being rather
pressed for time, I didn't stop to count whatever else she may or may
not have had. Coming toward me, stumbling over the refuse and offal,
was an office flunky.
Alter I had stated my problem succinctly, he directed me to the files
in sign language, pausing first to give thirty lashes to a lissome lass who
had thoughtlessly stopped screaming. I ran a spot-check on the Quad all
the way back to ICO2, but nowhere was there a mention ol Bl'ock S. Circle
S. yes. Block S, no. That seemed to indicate—to me. at least —that if ever
the Block S Society existed, it was most unofficial.
By this time my feet were quite cold. The floor of the Quad office
is made of concrete, and it slopes on all sides toward a central drain.
This lent credence to my original impression; namely, that the building
had formerly been a king-size outhouse —wood, not brick.
Seeing an open campfire in the editor's office, I wended my way thence
to toast my frozen feet. The editor was at his desk. Tossing a washed-out
blonde off his lap and into the fire, he rose to meet me. Sadly I realized
that he was an old fraternity brother of mine who had gone astray. I
shall call him John Doe; it's kinder that way. I wouldn t want his family
to discover that he's connected with the Quad. «
I informed John of the futility of my search. "Gah-dammit, you re
crazy." lie snarled, showing me a list of the clubs that were to have
their pictures in this year's Quad. Sure enough, there il was. the Block
S Society. He also had Circle S on the list. Finally I convinced him that
Block S does not exist now, and seemingly never did. He bowed his
head. As I left the office I heard him mutter. "For crissakcs, who's
gonna pay for their page?" Money-mad to the last.
I\o Joking, We Need a Block S Societyr
That completed my research into the matter of Block S. so you all can
see that I'm well qualified to offer advice and comment. Seriously, though,
1 think it's a fine idea. Winners of a Block S have something in common,
and should belong to some sort of permanent organization. They could
act as a board of experts on athletics to Excom, which will have some
weighty decisions to make in the future.
For instance, what sort of award should be given in the senior year
t<» those athletes like Mickey Titus who were good enough to make
their marks ;is freshmen? What should be done about the agitation to
make swimming a major sport? Such problems arc legion.
Every other major sport I know of has a comparable society. One of
the things they do is distribute copies of the school annual to high schools
which normally turn out good athletes; that could be a factor in getting a
winning team. There are many little duties such a group could perform,
and Stanford should not be without one.
Marty Anderson should be congratulated for setting the ball rolling—
but lie should have help. He's a very busy lad, what with two major
sports, the student body presidency, and his studies. A meeting has
been called for 7:.'10 Thursday evening; all Block S winners should at
tend and offer any aid they can. The tentative meeting place is Cubber
ley Auditorium.
I hope you don't think I mean .such a group should become involved
in campus politics; that's something for all students together. But on
matters pertaining to sports they certainly should have a voice. In this
day of high-pressure college sports, the athletes themselves are all-too
often ignored, or treated as chattels. This should not be; sports should be
fun, not work. We have a pretty good system here at Stanford; I think
a Block S Society might help keep it that way.
Ted Norton, the Historian, on being advised of my tribulations, came
up with a solution. He says if a Block S Society ever existed it must have
left funds with the A.S.S.U. Marty, check your files.
The phone rings, and who should be at the other end but the President?
Harry? No. Donald? No. Marty. It seems some of the boys who uphold

in the office at the time; I asked if there ever was such a society here
at Stanford. First man (who was here before the war) says there's
never been a Block S Society; just Circle S (minor sports). Second man
says there was and is. that it's functioning right now. Third man says
there used to be, but it went defunct before the war.
To Sgt. Slinger, who was taught to think scientifically by Dr. Snyder
in Western Civ., that didn't seem at all decisive, so he decided to call on
his editor for aid. However, there was a slight delay in reaching her
office; young Willie Coughlin was writing his first colyum of 1947 (after
swearing he was through) and the anteroom was hip-deep in people who
should have been somewhere else. They were peering over Coffee's
shoulder, reading the Bull as it came steaming hot off the typewriter.
After reading Hull Session I tripped merrily on into the Sanctum
Sanctorum of Lady Macßeth and her stooges. After I got up oil (he
floor I stated my problem in simple, one-syllable words so she'd he sure
to understand. Evidently I wasn't simple enough, because she just
rolled her eyes and said, "Ugglc uggle uggle!"
One of her stooges, a rather bright young lady who looks like Hamlet's
father, handed nie an old copy of the Frosh Guide. On thumbing through
the tome hurriedly 1 found that no mention was made of any past or pres
ent Block S Society. 1 thanked the nice people and said good-bye. Lady
Macßeth said, "Fight fiercely!" I dodged out as quickly as possible, taking
care to avoid a girl hanging from the ceiling by her feet, trying to get
close enough to Coughlin to ask lor his autograph.
Is, Was, Isn't, Wasn't —Who Knows?
Almost an hour had passed and my task was not furthered. It.seemed
to call for the advice of an Old Face, a fixture on the Stanford scene. I
picked up the phone (that's about all I seem able to pick up these days)
and called the oldest face I know. Don Liebendorfer. From him I learned
that either there was or was not a Block S Society in the past; the two
most influential clubs were Quadrangle and Snake and Skull, which were
not limited strictly to athletes. These clubs died some time ago.
By this time I was pretty sure that there is not now a Block S Society.
I had no proof; just a hunch. Naturally I wanted to know il there had
EVER been such an organization. Acting on another hunch (I have two
hunches, like a Camel), I dialed the number of the Quad to see if they
had complete file. They informed me it was complete with a few excep
tions, so I ambled over.
If the Daily office is a disgrace, the Quad quarters arc a stinking
scandal. I can't exactly tell you what the building looks like, except
that it should have a half-moon carved in the door. Outside is a home
made sign which says "QUAD OFFICE AND STUDIO." Some studio!
I stepped out of the pleasant, serene, sunshiny outdoors into the midst
of utter confusion. Papers were flying through the air, girls were scream
ing and biting their nails, and a renegade Daily U.P. editor was off in
the corner helping them publish their monstrosity. From the bulletin
board was hanging a lady's piyple glove (right, empty), suspended by a
thumb tack. I paused to look at the interesting murals, which must have
been painted (if that's the word) by a Dali reporter named Salvador.
She's Only an Octo, lint 11 hat a Pass!
One of the subjects was a girl whom I took to be Miss Quad. She
had arms and two heads which had three eyes apiece. Being rather
pressed for time, I didn't stop to count whatever else she may or may
not have had. Coming toward me, stumbling over the refuse and offal,
was an office flunky.
Alter I had stated my problem succinctly, he directed me to the files
in sign language, pausing first to give thirty lashes to a lissome lass who
had thoughtlessly stopped screaming. I ran a spot-check on the Quad all
the way back to ICO2, but nowhere was there a mention ol Bl'ock S. Circle
S. yes. Block S, no. That seemed to indicate—to me. at least —that if ever
the Block S Society existed, it was most unofficial.
By this time my feet were quite cold. The floor of the Quad office
is made of concrete, and it slopes on all sides toward a central drain.
This lent credence to my original impression; namely, that the building
had formerly been a king-size outhouse —wood, not brick.
Seeing an open campfire in the editor's office, I wended my way thence
to toast my frozen feet. The editor was at his desk. Tossing a washed-out
blonde off his lap and into the fire, he rose to meet me. Sadly I realized
that he was an old fraternity brother of mine who had gone astray. I
shall call him John Doe; it's kinder that way. I wouldn t want his family
to discover that he's connected with the Quad. «
I informed John of the futility of my search. "Gah-dammit, you re
crazy." lie snarled, showing me a list of the clubs that were to have
their pictures in this year's Quad. Sure enough, there il was. the Block
S Society. He also had Circle S on the list. Finally I convinced him that
Block S does not exist now, and seemingly never did. He bowed his
head. As I left the office I heard him mutter. "For crissakcs, who's
gonna pay for their page?" Money-mad to the last.
I\o Joking, We Need a Block S Societyr
That completed my research into the matter of Block S. so you all can
see that I'm well qualified to offer advice and comment. Seriously, though,
1 think it's a fine idea. Winners of a Block S have something in common,
and should belong to some sort of permanent organization. They could
act as a board of experts on athletics to Excom, which will have some
weighty decisions to make in the future.
For instance, what sort of award should be given in the senior year
t<» those athletes like Mickey Titus who were good enough to make
their marks ;is freshmen? What should be done about the agitation to
make swimming a major sport? Such problems arc legion.
Every other major sport I know of has a comparable society. One of
the things they do is distribute copies of the school annual to high schools
which normally turn out good athletes; that could be a factor in getting a
winning team. There are many little duties such a group could perform,
and Stanford should not be without one.
Marty Anderson should be congratulated for setting the ball rolling—
but lie should have help. He's a very busy lad, what with two major
sports, the student body presidency, and his studies. A meeting has
been called for 7:.'10 Thursday evening; all Block S winners should at
tend and offer any aid they can. The tentative meeting place is Cubber
ley Auditorium.
I hope you don't think I mean .such a group should become involved
in campus politics; that's something for all students together. But on
matters pertaining to sports they certainly should have a voice. In this
day of high-pressure college sports, the athletes themselves are all-too
often ignored, or treated as chattels. This should not be; sports should be
fun, not work. We have a pretty good system here at Stanford; I think
a Block S Society might help keep it that way.
Ted Norton, the Historian, on being advised of my tribulations, came
up with a solution. He says if a Block S Society ever existed it must have
left funds with the A.S.S.U. Marty, check your files.
The phone rings, and who should be at the other end but the President?
Harry? No. Donald? No. Marty. It seems some of the boys who uphold
the Cardinal on the field of sport are anxious to start a Block S Society.
Sounds like a good idea; there are numerous services such a group could
perform.

says there was and is. that it's functioning right now. Third man says
there used to be, but it went defunct before the war.
To Sgt. Slinger, who was taught to think scientifically by Dr. Snyder
in Western Civ., that didn't seem at all decisive, so he decided to call on
his editor for aid. However, there was a slight delay in reaching her
office; young Willie Coughlin was writing his first colyum of 1947 (after
swearing he was through) and the anteroom was hip-deep in people who
should have been somewhere else. They were peering over Coffee's
shoulder, reading the Bull as it came steaming hot off the typewriter.
After reading Hull Session I tripped merrily on into the Sanctum
Sanctorum of Lady Macßeth and her stooges. After I got up oil (he
floor I stated my problem in simple, one-syllable words so she'd he sure
to understand. Evidently I wasn't simple enough, because she just
rolled her eyes and said, "Ugglc uggle uggle!"
One of her stooges, a rather bright young lady who looks like Hamlet's
father, handed nie an old copy of the Frosh Guide. On thumbing through
the tome hurriedly 1 found that no mention was made of any past or pres
ent Block S Society. 1 thanked the nice people and said good-bye. Lady
Macßeth said, "Fight fiercely!" I dodged out as quickly as possible, taking
care to avoid a girl hanging from the ceiling by her feet, trying to get
close enough to Coughlin to ask lor his autograph.
Is, Was, Isn't, Wasn't —Who Knows?
Almost an hour had passed and my task was not furthered. It.seemed
to call for the advice of an Old Face, a fixture on the Stanford scene. I
picked up the phone (that's about all I seem able to pick up these days)
and called the oldest face I know. Don Liebendorfer. From him I learned
that either there was or was not a Block S Society in the past; the two
most influential clubs were Quadrangle and Snake and Skull, which were
not limited strictly to athletes. These clubs died some time ago.
By this time I was pretty sure that there is not now a Block S Society.
I had no proof; just a hunch. Naturally I wanted to know il there had
EVER been such an organization. Acting on another hunch (I have two
hunches, like a Camel), I dialed the number of the Quad to see if they
had complete file. They informed me it was complete with a few excep
tions, so I ambled over.
If the Daily office is a disgrace, the Quad quarters arc a stinking
scandal. I can't exactly tell you what the building looks like, except
that it should have a half-moon carved in the door. Outside is a home
made sign which says "QUAD OFFICE AND STUDIO." Some studio!
I stepped out of the pleasant, serene, sunshiny outdoors into the midst
of utter confusion. Papers were flying through the air, girls were scream
ing and biting their nails, and a renegade Daily U.P. editor was off in
the corner helping them publish their monstrosity. From the bulletin
board was hanging a lady's piyple glove (right, empty), suspended by a
thumb tack. I paused to look at the interesting murals, which must have
been painted (if that's the word) by a Dali reporter named Salvador.
She's Only an Octo, lint 11 hat a Pass!
One of the subjects was a girl whom I took to be Miss Quad. She
had arms and two heads which had three eyes apiece. Being rather
pressed for time, I didn't stop to count whatever else she may or may
not have had. Coming toward me, stumbling over the refuse and offal,
was an office flunky.
Alter I had stated my problem succinctly, he directed me to the files
in sign language, pausing first to give thirty lashes to a lissome lass who
had thoughtlessly stopped screaming. I ran a spot-check on the Quad all
the way back to ICO2, but nowhere was there a mention ol Bl'ock S. Circle
S. yes. Block S, no. That seemed to indicate—to me. at least —that if ever
the Block S Society existed, it was most unofficial.
By this time my feet were quite cold. The floor of the Quad office
is made of concrete, and it slopes on all sides toward a central drain.
This lent credence to my original impression; namely, that the building
had formerly been a king-size outhouse —wood, not brick.
Seeing an open campfire in the editor's office, I wended my way thence
to toast my frozen feet. The editor was at his desk. Tossing a washed-out
blonde off his lap and into the fire, he rose to meet me. Sadly I realized
that he was an old fraternity brother of mine who had gone astray. I
shall call him John Doe; it's kinder that way. I wouldn t want his family
to discover that he's connected with the Quad. «
I informed John of the futility of my search. "Gah-dammit, you re
crazy." lie snarled, showing me a list of the clubs that were to have
their pictures in this year's Quad. Sure enough, there il was. the Block
S Society. He also had Circle S on the list. Finally I convinced him that
Block S does not exist now, and seemingly never did. He bowed his
head. As I left the office I heard him mutter. "For crissakcs, who's
gonna pay for their page?" Money-mad to the last.
I\o Joking, We Need a Block S Societyr
That completed my research into the matter of Block S. so you all can
see that I'm well qualified to offer advice and comment. Seriously, though,
1 think it's a fine idea. Winners of a Block S have something in common,
and should belong to some sort of permanent organization. They could
act as a board of experts on athletics to Excom, which will have some
weighty decisions to make in the future.
For instance, what sort of award should be given in the senior year
t<» those athletes like Mickey Titus who were good enough to make
their marks ;is freshmen? What should be done about the agitation to
make swimming a major sport? Such problems arc legion.
Every other major sport I know of has a comparable society. One of
the things they do is distribute copies of the school annual to high schools
which normally turn out good athletes; that could be a factor in getting a
winning team. There are many little duties such a group could perform,
and Stanford should not be without one.
Marty Anderson should be congratulated for setting the ball rolling—
but lie should have help. He's a very busy lad, what with two major
sports, the student body presidency, and his studies. A meeting has
been called for 7:.'10 Thursday evening; all Block S winners should at
tend and offer any aid they can. The tentative meeting place is Cubber
ley Auditorium.
I hope you don't think I mean .such a group should become involved
in campus politics; that's something for all students together. But on
matters pertaining to sports they certainly should have a voice. In this
day of high-pressure college sports, the athletes themselves are all-too
often ignored, or treated as chattels. This should not be; sports should be
fun, not work. We have a pretty good system here at Stanford; I think
a Block S Society might help keep it that way.
Ted Norton, the Historian, on being advised of my tribulations, came
up with a solution. He says if a Block S Society ever existed it must have
left funds with the A.S.S.U. Marty, check your files.
The phone rings, and who should be at the other end but the President?
Harry? No. Donald? No. Marty. It seems some of the boys who uphold
the Cardinal on the field of sport are anxious to start a Block S Society.
Sounds like a good idea; there are numerous services such a group could
perform.
It's an honor to be asked to help in such a task, but it seemed a good
idea to know a little about the subject. There were some hangers-on
in the office at the time; I asked if there ever was such a society here
at Stanford. First man (who was here before the war) says there's
never been a Block S Society; just Circle S (minor sports). Second man
says there was and is. that it's functioning right now. Third man says
