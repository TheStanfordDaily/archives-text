ing Coast champions meet another
major contender, the University of

was expected to have little chance
against the Bruins.

sports meets its second test, tomor
row night as a bitter race for the
Pacific Coast Conference basketball
championship yets under way among
Southern Division quintets.

meets Stanford Im-Ciu'c a capacity
crowd of 5,0(10 at Los Angeles in

in every sport, will be out to
spread-eagle other Western teams
on the basketball court as its Rose
Howl football team did on the grid
iron.
California's high-voltage defend
ing Coast champions meet another
major contender, the University of
Southern California, before 7,500
fans at Berkeley in another Southern
Division contest.
The games get the West's '"big
gest" basketball season in history
under full steam.
With attendance and the caliber of
competition already hitting new
peaks, the most unpredictable con

establish new admission records for
nearly every major cage team on
the Coast.

was expected to have little chance
against the Bruins.
