# Underdog Indian Cagemen Meet 'Westwood Wonders'
## 
### ART SHAPIRO 
Ringing in the 1947 Pacific Coast Conference basketball sea
son, the L'il Injins of Stanford tackle the UCLA Bruins in the
Westwood lair of the quintet from the southland tonight. The
Cardinals who made the trip down LA-way will find themselves
a fluctuating 12-point underdog as they take to the boards
against the Uclans.

The UCLA live which returned
to the coast after a successful road
trip which saw them down Wyom
ing, St. Joseph's of Philadelphia,
and Purdue while dropping a con
test to NYU at Madison Square
Garden, are rated as overwhelm
ing favorites over a Stanford squad
which hasn't managed to show
anything in the way of an impres
sive attack or defense. The Indian
record will stand at 4 won and 8
lost before the opening gun at 8
tonight.
THE "WESTWOOD WONDERS"
UCLA which promised to be the
class of the conference has not lived
up to their pre-season notices, but
are still one of the most powerful
outfits on this side of the Great Di
vide, at least on paper if not on the
hardwood courts. Boasting such
great names as Don Barksdale, Da
vage Minor. Dick West, Dick Perry,
John Stanich, Bill Rankin, and
Chuck Clustka, the Uclans were
supposedly unbeatable, but Santa
Clara turned the trick, and NYU
wasted no great efforts in downing
the Westwood Wonders, 49-66.
At times the Bruins have flashed
brilliantly, but they also have stall
ed miserably at other occasions. It
appears to be a question of too many
names and not enough team play.
Individually, the various members of
the quintet are outstanding, but to
gether they perform in a manner far
from normal expectations.
ONE-TWO PUNCH
Barksdale, the sparkplug of the
Uclans attack, a tall, six-foot, six
inch center, is the man to be stop
ped if the Bruins are to be halted
short of victory. The dusky Mr. B
ranged all over Madison Square
Garden from Eighth to Ninth Ave
nues ringing in To counters as the
Bruins tasted defeat at the hands
of the New Yorkers. It was a team
defeat but a personal triumph for
Barksdale who brought the blase
inhabitants of "The House the Ned
Irish Built" to their feet with a
thunderous ovation. Davagc Mi
nor. the teams second highest scor
er and a former star with a great
Toledo University five, provides
the number two punch after Bark
sdale lets go with number one.
Minor, after bringing the Toledo
quintet to the National Invitation
Tourney away back in 1940, found
himself in the army with some
eight million others, and distin
guished himself after the war as
the star of the ETO championship
basketball squad.
YOUTH VS. EXPERIENCE
The Cardinal courtmen who tac
kle the "gold-dust twins" and their

three compatriots this evening boast
no individual star, less publicity, and
still less experience. An all sopho
more and freshman team will be
wearing the Cardinal jerseys against
the Blue and Gold. Only one man,
Bill Christansen, is an upper class
man, and he is not on the starting
live. It will therefore be a case of
names and experience against youth
and team play.
The Indians worked out yesterday
prior to boarding the train and
stressed defensive tactics. The "B"
squad which tackles the Long Beach
City College hoopmen tonight in the
Pavilion ran through the practice
session utilizing Bruin plays and
techniques, and provided the oppo
sition for the varsity.
