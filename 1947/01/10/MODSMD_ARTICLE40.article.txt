# 44 Teams Enter for Murals; League Planned in Village
## 
### 
Thirteen new teams were added to
the embryo Intramural Basketball
League yesterday, bringing the total
lo forty-four entries in the all-Cam
pus hoop derby. Director Gene Cold
iron believes that many more teams
actually intend to enter the* race, but
as yet they have been unable to or
ganize. For this reason, teams may
still sign up for the basketball lea
gues; but today will be their last
chance to get into the first week
pairings.
With the tremendous response
from the Village, plans are now
going ahead for a pair of large

leagues: one for the Village and
one for the Campus. Both leagues
would be run separately with a
post-season play-off between the
two winning teams. Action is still
pending on the proposed use of the
Village gymnasium facilities for
the Intramural Basketball League,
but all Campus League games are
definitely set for the Pavilion and
'the Men's Gym.
Other administrative problems in
clude the new Advisory Council

which will guide the basketball lea- j
gues. This intelligent innovation to
Intramural procedure will be made ,
up of single representatives from the |
Fraternity Group, the Village, th<> 1
Halls, and the Eating Clubs. Meet
ings will be conducted with Director ,
Coldiron to discuss improvements to
the league as proposed by the play- |
ers. So far, no definite action has
been taken upon setting up the !
council.
Meanwhile the task of whipping
newly organized teams into shape
was given a boost by the announce
ment that the Men's Gym will be
available for practice sessions to
night at 6:30. Any teams wishing to
use the Gym tonight should contact
