# Busy Party Line Costs Local Family's Home

### 
WOODSIDE, Jan. 9 (UP).â€”The
evils of the two-party telephone j
line cost Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence j
Costa their four-room home today, j
Woodside and Stanford fire de- ;
partments rushed to the Costa home j
too late to save the house because !
Mrs. Costa couldn't get the "party I
line" off the phone to summon aid i
in time.
The fire started with blazing cur- j
tains in the bedroom, and Mrs. Cos
ta carried her 23-months-old son, j
Lyle, to safety, then tried to get an- i
other woman off the phone.
When that didn't work she tried
the garden hose, but last night's i
cold weather had frozen it stiff and i
the house was consumed before her j
eyes.
