# Fraternities Open Doors To Rushees
## 
### DICK KEUSINK 
Stanford gets off to its first |
fraternity rush period since the 1
end of the war when the Farm's j
24 Greek societies open their
doors to eligible rushees tomor
row night. Rushing will begin !
at seven and end at nine p.m.
All houses up and down Stan
ford's fraternity row will do their
best to give eligible mon a taste of
what the fraternity life is like.
Jeff Howe, president of Interfra- i
ternity Council, in a word to all fra- |
ternity rush chairmen, warned that
the coming rush period will be a
test of how well the Greek organi- ;
/.ations have "come along" since the
end of the war.
COUNCIL RULES
"Every house needs a break," j
said Howe, "and fraternities must
do their best not to violate the rules
set down by Interfraternity Coun
cil. All rushees must be out of the
houses by 9 o'clock in the evening
and rushees must not be contacted
in the house outside of the regular
rushing periods."
Howe also had a word of ;>dvice
to the future fraternity man. "Don't
make getting into a house for the
sake of being a fraternity man your
main objective," warned Howe. "At
Stanford what you can do for your- (
self on campus is much more im
portant than where you live." Howe
went on to say that rushees should j
be careful to look for a house where J
they think they will be happy to ;
live for the rest of their lives at
Stanford.
CLOSE CONTACT
"Living in a hous" calls for closer !
contact with men whereas if you are !
living in a hall there is more chance
to spread out, and remember you !
will also be asked to do your share
of work in keeping up the house," j
said Howe.
"Don't pledge too quickly," was '
Howe's last suggestion to the rush- ,
ees. "Look around and be sure you i
are joining the proper house. Don't
be high-pressured into joining be- 1
fore you have fully made up your |
mind. Be sure and look at your j
grades and be sure you can keep
them up after you enter a house."
Tomorrow and Wednesday will be
the first two days of the open rush {
period this week. Two more open \
houses will follow on Jan. 22 and j
23, and all men interested in join- i
ing a fraternity are urged to at
tend. All other rushing activities '
will be by invitation only, culminat
ing in the preference dinner Feb. 4.

Stanford gets off to its first |
fraternity rush period since the 1
end of the war when the Farm's j
24 Greek societies open their
doors to eligible rushees tomor
row night. Rushing will begin !
at seven and end at nine p.m.
All houses up and down Stan
ford's fraternity row will do their
best to give eligible mon a taste of
what the fraternity life is like.
Jeff Howe, president of Interfra- i
ternity Council, in a word to all fra- |
ternity rush chairmen, warned that
the coming rush period will be a
test of how well the Greek organi- ;
/.ations have "come along" since the
end of the war.
COUNCIL RULES
"Every house needs a break," j
said Howe, "and fraternities must
do their best not to violate the rules
set down by Interfraternity Coun
cil. All rushees must be out of the
houses by 9 o'clock in the evening
and rushees must not be contacted
in the house outside of the regular
rushing periods."
Howe also had a word of ;>dvice
to the future fraternity man. "Don't
make getting into a house for the
sake of being a fraternity man your
main objective," warned Howe. "At
Stanford what you can do for your- (
self on campus is much more im
portant than where you live." Howe
went on to say that rushees should j
be careful to look for a house where J
they think they will be happy to ;
live for the rest of their lives at
Stanford.
CLOSE CONTACT
"Living in a hous" calls for closer !
contact with men whereas if you are !
living in a hall there is more chance
to spread out, and remember you !
will also be asked to do your share
of work in keeping up the house," j
said Howe.
"Don't pledge too quickly," was '
Howe's last suggestion to the rush- ,
ees. "Look around and be sure you i
are joining the proper house. Don't
