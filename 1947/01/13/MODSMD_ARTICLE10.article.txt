# Farm Scientists Isolate Polio Virus
## 
### 
Creation of a vaccine effective
against poliomyelitis, the crippling
disease otherwise known as infantile
paralysis, may be possible soon as a
: result of work completed by two
Stanford scientists.
The scientists, Dr. Hubert S. Lor
| ing and Dr. C. E. Sehwcrdt, have
j successfully isolated what they be
i lieve to be nearly pure polio virus.
Laboratory tests, including photo
graphs taken through an electron
microscope, indicate that the isolated
j virus is 80 per cent pure or better.
1 CONCENTRATED VACCINE
i Now that a virus which is Rela
tively pure is available, the experi
mental doftr is open, Dr. Loring
pointed out, to render the pure virus
i non-infectious by chemical or phy
: sical treatment, and.the scientists
i hope, to produce a concentrated vac
| cine free of the impurities which
! have plagued previous polio vaccine
| experimenters.
He cautioned against any conclu
sion that isolation of the pure virus
! will lead necessarily to production
; of a successful vaccine against polio,
| and stated that a long and exacting
; experimental path lies ahead of sci
entists seeking this vaccine.
EXPERIMENTAL RATS
First, with the virus produced
1 from a single type of polio at Stan-
I ford—and there are many different
! polio strains—the two scientists will
attempt to produce a vaccine effec
tive for cotton rats, which happen to
be susceptible to the type of polio—
known as the Lansing strain—on
which Dr. Loring and Dr. Schwerdt
have experimented since 1943.
Then similar vaccines must be
prepared from other strains to
whieh other experimental animals,
such as mice, are susceptible.
Later the vaccines must lie tried
I on monkeys, which are susceptible

to most strains of polio, before the
final stage can be reached when the
vaccine can be tried on human be
ings-
First step in the technique of the
two scientists is the grinding up of
the brain and spinal cord of cotton
rats which have been infected with
polio through injections.
Approximately 150 grams of this
tissue, after numerous purification
processes involving the use of a

; high-speed centrifuge and of ehemi
; cals to extract impurities, is reduced
down finally to about a milligram—
a thousandth of a gram or 0.000035
ounces—of the nearly pure virus
protein.
In order to prevent chemical de
composition which occurs at higher
I temperatures, all the purification
! procedures are carried out at low
I temperatures—from 0 to 4 degrees
centigrade.

Dr. Loring said that the tests indi
cated that this virus material has
characteristics similar to other vir
uses which have hern purified, and
that it behaves both chemically and
physically in a manner which would
not be likely scientifically if more
than one type of material were
present.
The Stanford scientists say that
one of the contributions to the
knowledge of polio which has re
sulted from this work is that scien
tists now know what the virus looks
like, know how big it is, and what
its chemical characteristics and prop
erties are.
The virus, seen by means of the
electron microscope, is a relatively
spherical particle which is so infini
testimal in size that its diameter is
estimated at 25 millimicrons, or 25
billionths of a meter. Chemically,
the virus reacts as a protein, which
the two chemists believe it to be.

1 CONCENTRATED VACCINE
i Now that a virus which is Rela
tively pure is available, the experi
mental doftr is open, Dr. Loring
pointed out, to render the pure virus
i non-infectious by chemical or phy
: sical treatment, and.the scientists
i hope, to produce a concentrated vac
| cine free of the impurities which
! have plagued previous polio vaccine
| experimenters.
He cautioned against any conclu
sion that isolation of the pure virus
! will lead necessarily to production
; of a successful vaccine against polio,
| and stated that a long and exacting
; experimental path lies ahead of sci
entists seeking this vaccine.
EXPERIMENTAL RATS
First, with the virus produced
1 from a single type of polio at Stan-
I ford—and there are many different
! polio strains—the two scientists will
attempt to produce a vaccine effec
tive for cotton rats, which happen to
be susceptible to the type of polio—
known as the Lansing strain—on
which Dr. Loring and Dr. Schwerdt
have experimented since 1943.
Then similar vaccines must be
prepared from other strains to
whieh other experimental animals,
such as mice, are susceptible.
Later the vaccines must lie tried
I on monkeys, which are susceptible

to most strains of polio, before the
final stage can be reached when the
vaccine can be tried on human be
ings-
First step in the technique of the
two scientists is the grinding up of
the brain and spinal cord of cotton
rats which have been infected with
polio through injections.
Approximately 150 grams of this
tissue, after numerous purification
processes involving the use of a

; high-speed centrifuge and of ehemi
; cals to extract impurities, is reduced
down finally to about a milligram—
a thousandth of a gram or 0.000035
ounces—of the nearly pure virus
protein.
In order to prevent chemical de
composition which occurs at higher
I temperatures, all the purification
! procedures are carried out at low
I temperatures—from 0 to 4 degrees
centigrade.

Dr. Loring said that the tests indi
cated that this virus material has
characteristics similar to other vir
uses which have hern purified, and
that it behaves both chemically and
physically in a manner which would
not be likely scientifically if more
than one type of material were
present.
The Stanford scientists say that
one of the contributions to the
knowledge of polio which has re
sulted from this work is that scien
tists now know what the virus looks
like, know how big it is, and what
its chemical characteristics and prop
erties are.
The virus, seen by means of the
electron microscope, is a relatively
spherical particle which is so infini
testimal in size that its diameter is
estimated at 25 millimicrons, or 25
billionths of a meter. Chemically,
the virus reacts as a protein, which
the two chemists believe it to be.

The virus, seen by means of the
electron microscope, is a relatively
spherical particle which is so infini
testimal in size that its diameter is
estimated at 25 millimicrons, or 25
billionths of a meter. Chemically,
the virus reacts as a protein, which
the two chemists believe it to be.

Creation of a vaccine effective
against poliomyelitis, the crippling
disease otherwise known as infantile
paralysis, may be possible soon as a
: result of work completed by two
Stanford scientists.
The scientists, Dr. Hubert S. Lor
| ing and Dr. C. E. Sehwcrdt, have
j successfully isolated what they be
i lieve to be nearly pure polio virus.
Laboratory tests, including photo
graphs taken through an electron
microscope, indicate that the isolated
j virus is 80 per cent pure or better.
1 CONCENTRATED VACCINE
i Now that a virus which is Rela
tively pure is available, the experi
mental doftr is open, Dr. Loring
pointed out, to render the pure virus
i non-infectious by chemical or phy
: sical treatment, and.the scientists
i hope, to produce a concentrated vac
| cine free of the impurities which
! have plagued previous polio vaccine
| experimenters.
He cautioned against any conclu
sion that isolation of the pure virus
! will lead necessarily to production
; of a successful vaccine against polio,
| and stated that a long and exacting
; experimental path lies ahead of sci
entists seeking this vaccine.
EXPERIMENTAL RATS
First, with the virus produced
1 from a single type of polio at Stan-
I ford—and there are many different
! polio strains—the two scientists will
attempt to produce a vaccine effec
tive for cotton rats, which happen to
be susceptible to the type of polio—
known as the Lansing strain—on
which Dr. Loring and Dr. Schwerdt
have experimented since 1943.
Then similar vaccines must be
prepared from other strains to
whieh other experimental animals,
such as mice, are susceptible.
Later the vaccines must lie tried
I on monkeys, which are susceptible

to most strains of polio, before the
final stage can be reached when the
vaccine can be tried on human be
ings-
First step in the technique of the
two scientists is the grinding up of
the brain and spinal cord of cotton
rats which have been infected with
polio through injections.
Approximately 150 grams of this
tissue, after numerous purification
processes involving the use of a

; high-speed centrifuge and of ehemi
; cals to extract impurities, is reduced
down finally to about a milligram—
a thousandth of a gram or 0.000035
ounces—of the nearly pure virus
protein.
In order to prevent chemical de
composition which occurs at higher
I temperatures, all the purification
! procedures are carried out at low
I temperatures—from 0 to 4 degrees
centigrade.

Dr. Loring said that the tests indi
cated that this virus material has
characteristics similar to other vir
uses which have hern purified, and
that it behaves both chemically and
physically in a manner which would
not be likely scientifically if more
than one type of material were
present.
The Stanford scientists say that
one of the contributions to the
knowledge of polio which has re
sulted from this work is that scien
tists now know what the virus looks
like, know how big it is, and what
its chemical characteristics and prop
erties are.
The virus, seen by means of the
electron microscope, is a relatively

testimal in size that its diameter is
