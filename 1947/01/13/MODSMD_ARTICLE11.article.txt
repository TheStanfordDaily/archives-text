LOS ANGELES (Saturday night).
—After stunning southern California
basketball fans with a 38-3.'} upset
of the much-vaunted U.C.L.A. five
in the conference opener here last
night, Stanford's quintet lost the sec
ond tilt, tonight, 48-40.
A second-string Bruin forward
named Johnny Stanich was the mar

as he sank shot after shot from 25
feet out to rack up 17 points, while
his much-publicized teammates Don
Barksdale and Davage Minor only
accounted for 10 points between
them.
Stanford early in the game held
a ten-point lead and was still on the
large end of a 25-23 score at half
time. Tlic West wood five came back
strong in the second half, however,
and after six minutes of that half,
took the lead and never relinquished
it.
When Bill Stephenson and Milt
Iverson left the game near the end
with five fouls apiece, any hopes the
Indians might have had of closing
the gap went with them.
In Friday night's conference open
er, the Westwood five took an early
7-0 lead and it looked as though the
game was going to be the easy vic
tory for the Bruins that all the local
scribes were claiming it would be.
But the Indians forged an almost
impregnable defense and at halftime
were trailing only 17-18. Led by the
brilliant shooting of forward Morley
