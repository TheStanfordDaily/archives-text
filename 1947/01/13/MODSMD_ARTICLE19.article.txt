## Vandenberg Criticizes China Policy 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 (UP).
— Secretary of State George
C. Marshall today faced a major
row with top-ranking Republi
cans unless he is willing to
change U.S. policy toward
China and Argentina.
The Republican chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Commit
tee, Arthur H. Vandenberg of Mich
| igan, sent up that storm signal while
j the general, en route from China,
| still basked in the sunshine of Wai-
I kiki Reach in Hawaii.
Vandenberg wants the United
States to abandon its efforts to bring
the Chinese Communists into a coa
lition government after Marshall';;
13-month futile effort, and disa
grees completely with outgoing Sec
retary of State James F. Byrnes on
policy toward Argentina.
For the general's benefit also,
Vandenberg advised that he and his
party would have no truck with
anything but a "tough" party to
ward Russia and would expect Mar
shall to make some drastic changes
in the State Department and the
U.S. representation at the United
Nations.
SPKECII JUDGED IMPORTANT
Great importance was attached to
Vandenberg's address before the
Cleveland Council on Foreign Af
fairs, and it. completely overshad
owed Byrnes' optimistic valedictory
speech from the same platform.
It was the first speech Vanden
berg has made since the United Na
tions and Big Four meetings in New
York and also the first since he be
came chairman of the powerful
Senate committee which must ap
prove all peace treaties.
Less than a week after Marshall
published his Chinese report damn
ing the extremists in both Chiang
■ Kai-shek's National Government
I and thf Chinese Communist party,
Vandenberg suggested the U.S.
abandon its mediation efforts be
tween the warring parties and
throw its diplomatic, economic and
military weight behind the National
Government and non - Communist
minority parties.
NEW CHINA POLICY SOUGHT
He called for a "shift" in emphasis
In policy toward China which won id
appear to differ with Marshall's
conclusion that China's only hop*-
lies in the "liberal" groups of all
parties, especially those within the
Communist party who have been
driven to that party because of dis
gust with the corruption within the
national and local governments.
