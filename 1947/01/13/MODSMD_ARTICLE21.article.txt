## Now That Rushing 
### 
Winter quarter's share in the return of the
pre-war cycle of campus events once more
brings fraternity rushing to the Stanford cam
pus—the same pre-war play but set in far
different scenery.
For the rushees, the open rush period be
ginning Tuesday will give new men— both
upper and lower division—the chance to look
over the Row, meet some of the fraternity men
and decide whether or not the fraternity life is
what they want.
for the fraternities, rushing will be the test
of their ability to handle problems for greater
tlidii they have yet faced. Today, Stanford's
I(J fraternity men are outnumbered by close
to 4,400 hall men. V/here pre-war years saw
no liaternity problem, and Flail and Row op

Regardless of the alleged inaiiterence of
he returning veteran to the lhe of a irattunity
man, Stanford's houses find themselves m a
position similar to that facing the soror ties
three years ago—too many potential mem
bers, too litile space.
The problem is not of the fraternity's mak
ing but it is theirs in part for solution. And
the individual fraternity can do its part by
trying to give all the visitors an even break—
help them meet the fraternity men, show thern
that the fraternity life is not an existence apart
but merely part of the larger Stanford, and
give them the chance to weigh for themselves
the relative merits of fraternity and hall life.
At least an equal share of responsibility
must be borne by the rushees. The recently

published Interfraternity Magazine will give
them the objective picture of fraternity life
and a series of friendly visits to as many
houses as they can will give them the sub
jective picture of fraternity life.
Some disappointment seems inevitable as
a rushing aftermath of this year. But fraternity
man or not, the Stanford man is judged by his
capabilities and accomplishments — not by
house affiliation. And his measure of success
here is determined by what he accomplishes
and not by his fraternity.
Many men will find after rushing that fra
ternity life does not appeal to them in many
phases, and for one reason or other will decide
not to pledge. A word of caution to those who
have already definitely made up their minds
pro or con—any decision you make at this
time must be based on a sufficient number of
facts to assute that the fraternity or hall that
you chose will enable you tu enjoy the type
of triendship that you will want twt 01 three
years from now
Most fraternities find themselves tup-heavy
with upper classmen so that the pressure will
be on to build a strong freshman pledge class.
Temptation to break the rules of rushing will
be strong but for their own protection, frater
nities must compete strictly under the rules.
To do otherwise, leaves them open to attack
by those who might envy or consider them
as a so-called privileged minority group.
Rushing conduct this year will determine
whether or not fraternities and rushees can
adjust to their new problems—everyone par
ticipating has the responsibility to show that
they can.—F.B. & N.W.
