When I read in last week's Daily of the Inter
national Survey Committee's appeal for students to
j:o abroad and study conditions in foreign countries,
tears came to my eyes. I realized that for too long
I had neglected my global responsibilities. I would
apply. I would, in my own eager way, contribute
what I could to international student understanding.
I thought how it would benefit me to go abroad.
1 know a woman who was abroad once—of course
now she's married and perfectly respectable. I
thought how I could trumpet the message of world
wide student co-operation from Lithuania to Lower
Sloppovia. But then I began to think in a more
practical vein. Could I carry enough cigarettes to
make the trip really worth while?
I would get one of those Fraiser-Kazer Road's
scholarships—to determine how many frauleins can
be comfortably squeezed in the rumble seat of their
new gasoline buggy.
1 would hire out as a carpenter during a French
cabinet crisis.

Games of skill at Monte Carlo would offer no
obstacle after my course in Probabilities 122 at the
Bay Meadows extension of L.S.J.U.
Stanford girls would thank me for setting up a
Paris branch of the Branner Date Bureau.
Perhaps A 1 Masters would authorize me to make
overtures to some European football conference to
sign a pact with the P.C.C. to participate in the con
templated Russ Bowl contest. A logical opponent
would be the winner of the European counterpart of
the Ivy League which features such aggregations as
the Heidelberg Brewin's, the Vienna Sausages, and
the Copenhagen Snuffs.
I would lay the groundwork for a great gondola
regatta in Venice's Grand Canal between the Stan
ford crew and the Volga Boatmen.
But the idealist in me swept aside these sordid
pecuniary considerations. I thought of the many
things a Stanford man could teach foreign students.
Rioting mobs in the Place de la Concorde would no
longer shout "Vive la France!" but "Give 'em the
Axis!" Russian students would supplant the "Inter
nal ionale" with "Stalin for you, each loyal comrade
brave and true."
I would lecture to the Yugoslavs on the preferen
tial voting system.
I would impart to the Parisian chefs the secret
recipes for converting foliage into cold vegetable
salads a la Village.
But then the futility of this global chit-chat
dawned on me. I would have to deny myself the
gratification of my humanitarianism. I could never
leave my fiancee and our three little children.

When I read in last week's Daily of the Inter
national Survey Committee's appeal for students to
j:o abroad and study conditions in foreign countries,
tears came to my eyes. I realized that for too long
I had neglected my global responsibilities. I would
apply. I would, in my own eager way, contribute
what I could to international student understanding.
I thought how it would benefit me to go abroad.
1 know a woman who was abroad once—of course
now she's married and perfectly respectable. I
thought how I could trumpet the message of world
wide student co-operation from Lithuania to Lower
Sloppovia. But then I began to think in a more
practical vein. Could I carry enough cigarettes to
make the trip really worth while?
I would get one of those Fraiser-Kazer Road's
scholarships—to determine how many frauleins can
be comfortably squeezed in the rumble seat of their
new gasoline buggy.
1 would hire out as a carpenter during a French
cabinet crisis.

Games of skill at Monte Carlo would offer no
obstacle after my course in Probabilities 122 at the
Bay Meadows extension of L.S.J.U.
Stanford girls would thank me for setting up a
Paris branch of the Branner Date Bureau.
Perhaps A 1 Masters would authorize me to make
overtures to some European football conference to
sign a pact with the P.C.C. to participate in the con
templated Russ Bowl contest. A logical opponent
would be the winner of the European counterpart of
the Ivy League which features such aggregations as
the Heidelberg Brewin's, the Vienna Sausages, and
the Copenhagen Snuffs.
I would lay the groundwork for a great gondola
regatta in Venice's Grand Canal between the Stan
ford crew and the Volga Boatmen.
But the idealist in me swept aside these sordid
pecuniary considerations. I thought of the many
things a Stanford man could teach foreign students.
Rioting mobs in the Place de la Concorde would no
longer shout "Vive la France!" but "Give 'em the
Axis!" Russian students would supplant the "Inter
nal ionale" with "Stalin for you, each loyal comrade
brave and true."
I would lecture to the Yugoslavs on the preferen
tial voting system.
I would impart to the Parisian chefs the secret
recipes for converting foliage into cold vegetable
salads a la Village.
But then the futility of this global chit-chat
dawned on me. I would have to deny myself the
