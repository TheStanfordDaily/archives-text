# CAMPUS OPINION

To the Editor:
The announcement of increased late leaves for
women was welcome news for the whole campus, but
the statement in last quarter's Daily that "someday
we may even have nerve enough to ask for two
thirties" was a direct slam at the intelligence and
integrity of Stanford women.
Yes, someday we may have nerve enough to ask
, for 2:3Q'.s, and someday, we may have nerve enough
i and sense enough to ' gijarit Stanford women the
I freedom to whrtji their age and intelligence entitles
.them. The present policy of running t*esl
dences like kindergartens and reform schools cannot
produce adults; it is a policy of retardation rather
than progression.
An increase in late leaves which will not effect the
freedom which Stanford women need if they are to
emerge from college as responsible adults with the
ability to govern their lives wisely. The only policy
which can duplicate the conditions which Stanford
women will meet after graduation is that of the abo
lition of all residence closing hours.
I can see no real, basic reasons for any residence
for women closing at any arbitrary hour. Moral and
administrative reasons have been trumped up. but
they have no foundation in fact or reason as far as
I can see. Morally, each girl behaves according to

her own standards, regardless of closing hours. The
determination of those Standards is her own aflair,
and should not and cannot be controlled by Univer
sity regulations. Rules will not influence anyone who
has a tendency or decision to "do wrong," and they
only penalize those whose intentions are in accord
with the conventions of a "moral" society.
As far as the students' abusing the privilege to
the detriment of their health and studies is con
cerned, I think that,a week or two of experimenta
v tion would be enough to convince most of them that
a regular alternation of work and relaxation is neces
sary. Those who are not convinced by such a trial
will have to learn now by the experience of illness
or failure in academic work the very lesson that
they would have to absorb after graduation anyway.
This plan of complete freedom of hours for all
is now being tried at the Village. Thus far, the
results have all been to the good. I believe that the
extension of this policy of freedom to all under
graduate women (with the possible exception of
first-quarter freshmen) would be an experiment
worth far more than the granting of any two-thirties.
Few oak trees grow under rocks, and few persons
can develop into individuals of strong character in
an atmosphere of repression.

women was welcome news for the whole campus, but
the statement in last quarter's Daily that "someday
we may even have nerve enough to ask for two
thirties" was a direct slam at the intelligence and
integrity of Stanford women.
Yes, someday we may have nerve enough to ask
, for 2:3Q'.s, and someday, we may have nerve enough
i and sense enough to ' gijarit Stanford women the
I freedom to whrtji their age and intelligence entitles
.them. The present policy of running t*esl
dences like kindergartens and reform schools cannot
produce adults; it is a policy of retardation rather
than progression.
An increase in late leaves which will not effect the
freedom which Stanford women need if they are to
emerge from college as responsible adults with the
ability to govern their lives wisely. The only policy
which can duplicate the conditions which Stanford
women will meet after graduation is that of the abo
lition of all residence closing hours.
I can see no real, basic reasons for any residence
for women closing at any arbitrary hour. Moral and
administrative reasons have been trumped up. but
they have no foundation in fact or reason as far as
I can see. Morally, each girl behaves according to

her own standards, regardless of closing hours. The
determination of those Standards is her own aflair,
and should not and cannot be controlled by Univer
sity regulations. Rules will not influence anyone who
has a tendency or decision to "do wrong," and they
only penalize those whose intentions are in accord
with the conventions of a "moral" society.
As far as the students' abusing the privilege to
the detriment of their health and studies is con
cerned, I think that,a week or two of experimenta
v tion would be enough to convince most of them that
a regular alternation of work and relaxation is neces
sary. Those who are not convinced by such a trial
will have to learn now by the experience of illness
or failure in academic work the very lesson that
they would have to absorb after graduation anyway.
This plan of complete freedom of hours for all
is now being tried at the Village. Thus far, the
results have all been to the good. I believe that the
extension of this policy of freedom to all under
graduate women (with the possible exception of
first-quarter freshmen) would be an experiment
worth far more than the granting of any two-thirties.
Few oak trees grow under rocks, and few persons
can develop into individuals of strong character in
an atmosphere of repression.
