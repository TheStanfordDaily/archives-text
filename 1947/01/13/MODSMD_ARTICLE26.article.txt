War Memorial? A New Pavilion
Would Meet All Requirements
There has been a lot of talk pro and con about a fitting War Memorial
for the Farm. Far be it from old Sgt. Slinger to keep his nose out of
any argument, and this one is right down his alley. First oft', it should be
something functional—no equestrian statues or bronze bird baths. Second,
it should be tangible—to everybody on campus. That would rule out
scholarships and such. Only a limited number of people can benefit from
scholarships; a War Memorial should be for ALL.
What could be better than a new basketball pavilion? The one we
have is obviously too small, and the floor is nearly worn out. It cer
tainly is something that would benefit every student, as contrasted to
(lie smaller groups that would use a new Union or International House.
After World War I.the University of Illinois followed this idea in build
ing a new football stadium. On every pillar is the name of an Illinois
mail killed while in service. To my mind, it is the perfect tribute to the
dead—a memorial to the past, but made also a part of the future by its
constant usefulness.
Of course, Stanford has no need for a new football stadium; the one
we have will be adequate to our needs lor many years. But the same can't
be said for the Pavilion. It doesn't have a large enough capacity for Stan
ford students and followers, as evidenced by the rallies this past year.
The thought of fitting in visiting rooting sections is enough to make the
poor athletic administration shudder.
"Why doesn't the Administration build a new pavilion if we need
one?" you ask. Silly boy. All such things must come out of the athletic
budget, which is supported only by football. The Farm had no team —
and no athletic income—for three years. The S.A.C. is broke, in so far
as any new building program is concerned.
The S.A.C. Ruill Brainier, You Know
Aside from Stanford's need, there is another very good reason for giving
the War Memorial money over to this project. The S.A.C. (then 8.A.C.)
built Branner. Oh. you didn't know? Well, it's true—and they financed
several other buildings around the campus that have nothing to do with

.sports.
And the S.A.C. built Branner at
a time when funds were low. They
BORROWED the money from the
University — and don't think they
didn't pay interest. They got their
money back, but they charged no
interest on their loan and had to
stand the loss. That's what I call
philanthropy.
That's why I say the War Me
morial money should he handed
over to the S.A.C. with no strings
attached. A new Men's Gym is
needed; if the athletic administra
tion wants to put in more money
and build a combination Gym and
Pavilion, let them go ahead.
It shouldn't be long before such a
Pavilion would have itself paid for.
Even during the depression there
were usually several games during
the year when people had to be
turned away; therefore the new
plant should be large. Even a ca
pacity of 10,000 wouldn't be too
much. And the beauty of it is that,
unlike a football stadium, its uses
are numerous—dances, rallies, stu
dent body meetings — aside from
basketball.
And, as I say, it would soon
pay for itself. That means the
same money would then be avail
able for something else. Could

there be any better way to eat your cake and have it too?

I Yripatetu' Paragraphing
Marehie Schwartz should be a very happy man, because ace qb Ainslie
Bell will be back to direct his team next season. Ainslie, a former Trojan
and Bruin, was due to graduate this spring but has decided to lay out a
quart M' and have an operation on his trick knee. Yes, Marehie Schwartz
should be a very happy man.

The Block S Society is definitely going to be a factor at Stanford
io the future. A.S.S.U. Proxy Marty Anderson has called a meeting of
all Block S winners for Thursday evening at 7:.'!(), in room 100 of the
Inner ((mid. In case my mildly facetious colyum of Friday morn left
anyone in doubt, I'll say again that it's a fine idea; congratulations to
everyone concerned.

After the Card showing on the Bruin courts Friday and Saturday
nights, there should be quite a few red faces among the exporting frater
nity. These poor boys from the Farm were supposed to lie down and play
dead when the other three teams in the Southern Division showed up.
Maybe this will be a happier basketball season than we thought. The
boys are pretty green, mostly, but Everett Dean is a fine coach. The
Indians may yet win almost as many as they lose. At any rate, at present
they are ahead of U.S.C. in the Conference standings.

Has Bill Sheridan's application for admission to Stanford been turned
down? Walt Gamage of the Palo Alto Times says he's trying to get into
Santa Clara. Requirements are requirements, of course, but he'd sure look
good romping on the Stadium turf next year; so would Forrest Hall and
Jerry Shipkey have looked good this past season.
