# Pro Golfers' Revolt Started by Brawl
## Corcoran Threatens Suit; Stars Quit Tourney Swing 
### 
DEL MONTE, Jan. 12 (UP). — P.G.A. Tournament Manager
Fred Corcoran tonight threatened to sue golfer Dick Metz as a
result of their Friday night fist fight, which appeared today to
have brought to a head long-standing friction in the pro golfers'
ranks.
At least four stars announced they no longer would play on

the tournament circuit, including
Metz who said a full-scale player
revolt was in the making and that
it was "time this thing was brought
I into the open."
Metz, who felled Corcoran with
one punch, sending the official to
! the hospital for treatment of cuts
| and loosened teeth, was not ex
pected to move on to Richmond for
the tournament there late this week.
British Open champ Sam Snoad,
National Open champion Lloyd
Mangrum. former National Open
champ Craig Wood and Johnny
Bulla all said they also would quit
the tournament swing.
UNPROVOKED ATTACK"
Corcoran said he was the victim
of an '"unprovoked, sneak attack,"
I and that as a result he spent the
night in a hospital where X-rays
were taken to determine if he had
suffered a concussion.
Metz was the victor in a one
punch brawl that was the culmi
nation of years of feuding be
tween the pair and which prob
ably will lead to a crisis in the
rift between the touring golfers
and executives of the P.G.A.
"Metz struck me in the mouth
without warning," Corcoran said.
"The blow knocked me clown and
I went to the hospital."
MET/ ISSUES STATEMENT
Metz issued the following state
; ment:
"An argument took place Fri
day night. I understand Mr. Cor
coran was slightly injured, which
L 1 deeply regret. In the midst
of the argument. Mr. Corcoran
turned around toward me in a
manner I judged to be a menac
ing one. I reacted spontaneously
i in self-defense. Following the al
tercation, we spoke briefly and
| went our separate ways."
Corcoran had a slightly different
version:
"Metz invited me to ride with
| him and Horton Smith and another
pro golfer to dinner. When we
reached there, Metz took me by the
arm and said. 'Let's take a walk.'
We walked a few steps when it hap
pened. I didn't see the punch and
| landed fiat on my back."
Metz and Corcoran have been
feuding for 10 years, according to
| the golfer, over what the players
I claim is "autocratic rule."

of the argument. Mr. Corcoran
turned around toward me in a
manner I judged to be a menac
ing one. I reacted spontaneously
i in self-defense. Following the al
tercation, we spoke briefly and

Corcoran had a slightly different
version:
"Metz invited me to ride with
| him and Horton Smith and another
pro golfer to dinner. When we
reached there, Metz took me by the
arm and said. 'Let's take a walk.'
We walked a few steps when it hap
pened. I didn't see the punch and
| landed fiat on my back."
Metz and Corcoran have been
feuding for 10 years, according to
| the golfer, over what the players
I claim is "autocratic rule."
DEL MONTE, Jan. 12 (UP). — P.G.A. Tournament Manager
Fred Corcoran tonight threatened to sue golfer Dick Metz as a
result of their Friday night fist fight, which appeared today to
have brought to a head long-standing friction in the pro golfers'
ranks.
At least four stars announced they no longer would play on

the tournament circuit, including
Metz who said a full-scale player
revolt was in the making and that
it was "time this thing was brought
I into the open."
Metz, who felled Corcoran with
one punch, sending the official to
! the hospital for treatment of cuts
| and loosened teeth, was not ex
pected to move on to Richmond for
the tournament there late this week.
British Open champ Sam Snoad,
National Open champion Lloyd
Mangrum. former National Open
champ Craig Wood and Johnny
Bulla all said they also would quit
the tournament swing.
UNPROVOKED ATTACK"
Corcoran said he was the victim
of an '"unprovoked, sneak attack,"
I and that as a result he spent the
night in a hospital where X-rays
were taken to determine if he had
suffered a concussion.
Metz was the victor in a one
punch brawl that was the culmi
nation of years of feuding be
tween the pair and which prob
ably will lead to a crisis in the
rift between the touring golfers
and executives of the P.G.A.
"Metz struck me in the mouth
without warning," Corcoran said.
"The blow knocked me clown and
I went to the hospital."
MET/ ISSUES STATEMENT
Metz issued the following state
; ment:
"An argument took place Fri
day night. I understand Mr. Cor
coran was slightly injured, which
L 1 deeply regret. In the midst
of the argument. Mr. Corcoran
turned around toward me in a
manner I judged to be a menac
ing one. I reacted spontaneously
