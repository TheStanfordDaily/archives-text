# Memorial Plan Vague
## 
### 
No definite action was taken in
deciding on a fitting war memorial
at the meeting of the War Memo
rial Committee last Saturday morn
ing, according to Thomas P. Car
penter, general secretary of the
University and member of the com
mittee.
The War Memorial Committee is
planning to query universities and
institutes all over the country re
yarding the memorial they are
planning and the advisability of
some of the suggestions offered by
Stanford students. As soon as all
the replies are received another
meeting will be held and a more
thorough investigation of the sub
ject can be made.
POLL TAKEN
A poll was taken last quarter of
100 students as to the advisability
of a new Student Union for a me
morial for Stanford war dead by
Patty Whittemore, chairman of the
Stanford Union Committee.
Many suggestions other than a
Student Union have been received
through Campus Opinion letters and
other sources. These include an in
ternational house, war memorial
professorships, money to send stu
dents abroad to report on conditions
in foreign countries, and exchange
scholarships.
SHOULD BE PRACTICAL
This subject has been one of much
debate bccause il should not only
be a fitting tribute to Stanford stu
dents who died in World War II
but also be practical and useful to
those attending Stanford today.
