# Cage Races Settle Down

NEW YORK, Jan. 12 (UP).—After
a wild start in which upset followed
upset, the nation's college basketball
teams had settled down to a sem
blance of form today, and each sec
tion boasted clear-cut leaders.
However, it still was impossible to
select any single team as a standout
for a national championship, as was
possible with the Oklahoma Aggies
during the heyday of Bob Kurland.
Leading the West Coast was
Washington with 10 straight tri
umphs without defeat. The Hus
kies' victims include Ohio State
twice and Minnesota twice. Cali
fornia, defending Pacific Coast
Conference champ, also ranked
high having split with Illinois and
defeated Ohio State twice. The
Bears' latest victory was Satur
day's 5.'l to 47 triumph over South
ern Cal. Top independent was
Santa Clara, which has beaten
Southern Cal and UCLA.
WISCONSIN BIG !) LEADER
In the Midwest, Wisconsin forged
to the front on the basis of victories
over Illinois, lowa and Indiana, three
of the strong contenders for the Big
Nine crown. The latest was a 70 to
49 walloping of Indiana on Saturday.
Notre Dame lost some prestige when
Purdue outgalloped the Irish on Sat
urday, 60 to 56. Purdue thereby won
respect as a Big Nine contender, and
will get its first conference test Mon
day night against Indiana.
Among the smaller Midwest uni
versities, Marshall stayed undefeat
ed with a 63 to 61 conquest of Akron
Saturday. Other undefeated teams
were bunched in the East —Du-
quesne, Seton Hall, Rhode Island
State, Lafayette, Army and West
Virginia, which is rated as a South
eastern club.
DUQUESNE WINS AGAIN
Duquesne has won 10 in a row, the
latest a 54 to 22 romp over St. Fran
cis of Pennsylvania on Saturday.
Seton Hall has won 13 games, Rhode
Island State eight and West Virginia
seven. The high-scoring Rhodies
won two week-end games, 99 to 66
over Maine and 74 to 57 over Con
necticut.
West Virginia, a powerful live
which may cut a wide swath in the
post-season tournament play, won
over Canisius, 63 to 43. on Satur
day night. Army dropped Pitts
burgh. 60 to 53, in its second start,
and Lafayette humbled Upsala, 69
to 46.
Kentucky, best in the South and a
unanimous nomination for the na
tional title during the early season,
continued its victory string with a
70 to 29 win over Dayton.
