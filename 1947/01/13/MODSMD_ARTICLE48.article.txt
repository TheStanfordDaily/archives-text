bis name) who came all the way from the University of Dacca, located
in the far-oIT country of India to inform students of the progress being
made on "Botanical Research in India." And since everyone is invited
you had better plan to be at room 4110 of Jordan Hall at 4.

And after an intellectual Tuesday evening with Mr. Brandt, the Stan
ford faculty is going to take it easy—yes, relax with two entertaining

Same tune —same place—same production—if you haven t seen it jet.
you only have two more nights!
SATURDAY
This is getting to be a habit—yes. "John Doe and 'My Heart sin the
Highlands" again—and if you haven't seen by now, you might as well
forget it—you aren't interested anyway.
SUNDAY
Flickers, celluloids, films, movies, motion pictures—they're all the
same and that's what you'll see Sunday night at 7:30 in the Mem. Aud.
Don't ask me what is going to be showing—the committee is keeping it
a secret.
