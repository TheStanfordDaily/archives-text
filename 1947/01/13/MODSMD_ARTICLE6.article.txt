# French Conversational Club Meeting Tonight
## 
### 
French Club will hold its first
meeting at 4:15 p.m. today in the
Nitery. The club is being formed to
give students an opportunity to
learn to speak French, since there
are no conversational courses offered
this quarter.
Miss Nancy Smith is in charge of
the plans for the club, and Professor
W. L. Schwartz has approved the
formation of it. All students who
speak, or are interested in learning
to speak, French are urged to attend
the meeting.
