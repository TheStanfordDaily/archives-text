The FRENCHFRY Looks Ahead!
The french fries at Wilson's are
"looking ahead." They've been modernized!
The newest way to make a french fry
"sing" with tastiness is to cut it in thin cur
likews!
We leave a little well-scrubbed skin on
the potato to add an extra bit of fiavor here
and there and then as always we cook your
french fries in fresh, hot
oil just long enough to //J
make them taste so good {
meal of them alone! \ l
These "modern" french A
fries are another reason I I
for dining at Wilson's \ \ J
where every part of your
dinner is prepared to give \\l
you the greatest possible \
pleasure in eating. V,.. \
