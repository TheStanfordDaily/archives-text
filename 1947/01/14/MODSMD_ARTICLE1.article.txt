# Stanfordites Report Steps in Plan for National Student Group
## Three Groups Work to Extend Borders of Campus Thought 
### HELEN PINKERTON 
Stanford will receive today its first direct report on an experi
ment. The International Survey Committee, to be discussed at
an assembly at 4:15 in Memorial Hall by Niel C. Allen, is one
functioning result of a general and as yet un-coordinated in
terest in widening the boundaries of Stanford—socially and
mentally.
Another spearhead, still in germinal stages, will be brought
before the campus next Monday night at 8 p.m. Asilomar dele
gates will meet with representatives from Stanford groups and
with all students interested in international cooperation to dis
cuss the formation of a "Student Institute on International Re
lations."
A third possibility for extending the borders of knowledge
and practical participation was opened by the report from Stan
ford's delegates to the Student Youth Conference at Chicago,
held Dec. 28-3 Q.
Farm representatives returned with a thorough understanding
of what this gathering of students from nearly 300 colleges
and universities and 19 student organizations was concerned
with and what was accomplished.

The Conference, sponsored and organized by the American
delegation which attended the international student conference
in Prague last summer, discussed and made plans for a National
Student Organization, which will be set up at a constitutional
convention to be held before September 30, 1947.
Stanford delegates—Niel Allen, Marilyn Sidwell, Bill Slocum
and observer —Nancy Alden—reported that at panel discussions
and plenary sessions among Stanford's chief gains were good
contacts with students from other major universities of the
country which will be of value in carrying out Stanford's In
ternational Survey Program. The survey program, still in the
experimental stages, will get underway this summer with Stan
ford students being sent abroad by the ASSU.
Another gain was that Stanford's name was taken into a group
which can be considered a unified national student body. This
will facilitate the unification of efforts made at Stanford with
J those of other major American universities toward meeting the
problems before students as United States citizens and as
people of the world.
A National Continuations Committee was in charge of ar
rangements for setting up the Constitutional Convention at
which the National Student Organization will get under way.
The Chicago conference was organized into four panels of
discussion which were brought up at the three plenary sessions.
Agenda for the first panel was the organization and duties of
i the National Continuations Committee. This committee is car

; rying on the work of the Co .
convention is held. At the second pi©i lC uj -
29 the resolutions of this panel were brought up before the
Conference for discussion.,
Agenda for the second panel was the basic organizational
principles of the National Students Oragnization which will
guide the constitutional convention.
The third panel agenda concerned the student needs and
responsibilities in international student affairs. Concentration
of discussion was on student needs and student relief.
It was decided that the National Continuations Committee, a
temporary organization, remain independent of any international
organization of students existing. Although the Conference was
sponsored by the American delegation to the Prague Con-
I ference which in August 1946 formed the International Union
of Students, the representatives found it advisable to maintain
a completely separate existence. The American student organi
zation will be represented at the lUS meetings on a non
participating, observer basis.
Fourth panel agenda was the aims and activities of the prospec
tive NSO. Under this were discussed the following:
!' Economic needs of students; racial and religious, discrimination
; in college life; student government; student relief; student ex
! change and travel; student cultural cooperation; and student
sports.
I Specific aims derived from this agenda were vitally altered

outhern delegations, while agreeing in principle with
arms said they could not return these aims to their campuses
and expect favorable student sentiment or political approval.
Among the aims discussed under panel four were that the
NSO be founded on the common needs and desires of all
American students. These needs and desires were defined by
the concern of the student for peace, democracy and the perpetu
ation and strengthening of international friendships; under
standing and cultural exchange; and in the discussion and
: solution of their educational and economic problems.
Another aim discussed was that racial and religious prejudice,
bigotry and discrimination be totally disavowed by the NSO;
that it be equipped with adequate machinery to deal with
the problems and issues confronting it and to carry out its
obligations to American students through careful, intelligent
decisions.
There was not time for the agenda of panels two, three and
four to be brought before the plenary sessions of the Confer
ence. They were referred to the executive committee of the
National Continuations Committee and actions will be taken on
them before the constitutional convention is called. The four
main bodies of the NCC are the executive officers, the executive
| committee (30 delegates from regional committees and 3 na
tional organization delegates), regional committees, and the
i staff committee.
