ing to elections, permitting the use

i mitteemen H. D. Thoreau and Carl
Burke.
Subject to a two-thirds vote of
approval by Excom, the changes re
garding election funds are:

may spend up to $15 for election-
I eering.
2. A candidate for any other of

spend up to $10 for electioneer
ing.
3. Each candidate, or a repre
sentative thereof, shall submit to
the Election Board a budget list
ing all electioneering expendi
i turcs. Any expenditure for elec
tioneering not included in the

sidered a violation of these by
laws. and punitive action shall be

In the present
by-laws no ex
penditures for

pose are al
lowed, nor can

Under tho present preferential
j system of voting, ballots are pre
| pared to enable each voter to indi
j cate his choices in order of prefer
' ence. If no candidate has a major

! votes are counted and credited

! procedure is repeated until a ma
jority of credited votes is reached,
i One fewer number of choices are
available than candidates for office.
The proposed change in the meth
j od of voting:

more than four candidates nomi
■ nated. In the primary each voter
shall vote for only one candidate
per office. Those four candidates
receiving the highest number of
votes for each office shall he
placed on the final ballot, where

Thorcau and Burke have com
j pletcly edited the existing by-laws,
| weeding oul detailed technicalities,
® the inadvertent violations of which
! have stimulated cries of "illegal
j election" during past years.
Instead they have delegated ex

{ eisions pertaining to elections which
i are not specifically covered by the
j constitution or by the by-laws.
