# Drone Completes Successful Flight
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 13 (UP).-
A Flying Fortress drone —at least
theoretically pilotless— landed at
Boiling Field here tonight after fly
ing by remote control from Elgin
Field, Fla., and dropping a dummy
bomb in the Atlantic Ocean.
It was a graphic demonstration of
what the world faces in any future
"push-button" war. The plane made
the trip from Fioi ida without hu
man hands touching the controls.
It was opperated by an accompany
ing B-17, whose crew literally flew
the drone by radio.
A pilot, and co-pilot rode in the
drone, however, to prevent any crash
because of a mechanical failure in
the radio apparatus.
