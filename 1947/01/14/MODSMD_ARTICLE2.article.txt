# Post-War Rush Season Begins on Row Tonight
## 
### DICK KEUSINK 
Stanford's would-be fraternity men will start up the Row at
seven o'clock tonight as the first of four informal open houses
gets underway. All Stanford men are invited to visit any and
all of the 24 fraternities on the Stanford campus.
Jeff Howe, president of Interfraternity Council, urged all

prospective Greeks to visit as many
houses as ihey can within the two
hours of the open house program.
No rush cards will be sent out
for the initial open house session.
Howe reminds the fraternity rush
chairmen that the rush cards for
the formal invitation period are
now available in the A.S.S.U. office.
Howe also wishes to call the at
tention of house rush chairmen to
the invitational lunch and dinner
schedule for Friday, Jan. 17.
WELCOME TO RUSHEES
After a frenzied week of dusting
off the furniture, painting the walls
and cleaning out the general debris,
the Row men will climb into their
best-looking sport coats to welcome
the Class of '50 and all other pros
pective rushees.
The rushee will probably find
things a little quieter in the frater
nities since the old pre-war rush
years. With a number of veterans
returned to the fraternities, rushees
will sense the age differences of the
fraternity men.
INFORMAL OPEN HOUSES
But the ordinary rushee will still
be in for an old-fashioned evening
of handshaking and standard con
versational introductions lonight.
After drinking a couple of glasses
of punch and eating a few dozen
cookies, the prospective Greek will
be overwhelmed with stories of
home towns, mutual friends and
the old high school. Freshmen will
naturally talk about how tough life
is in Encina and there will prob
ably be several comments voiced on
conditions in Stanford Village.
When the open houses are over,
rushees will go back to "bull ses
sions" about their favorite frater
nities. Row men will get into a
huddle to plan big campaigns to
land their prospective "nuggets."
The next informal rush period
will be tomorrow night, when ihe
rushees will have the opportunity
to go up the Row.
