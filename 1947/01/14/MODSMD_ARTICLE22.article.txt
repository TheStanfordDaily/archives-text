## The 						‘Wolf, Wolf’ Call 
### 
'100 much like the table ot the shepherd boy
vho cried "wolf" once too many tirr.es, is the
stoiy of the smoke bombs ignited at Enoina
and Hobie halis last week The bombs created
so realistic an outpour of smoke that the fire
departments twice turned out en masse; the
freshmen were so convinced that minor panics
resulted in both halls.
A third, fourth, or fifth smoke bomb may
result in hugely enlarging the always-present
danger of fires. The fire department will not
run to Encina too many times nor too rapidly;
the students will all too soon realize that
where there is smoke there need not be fire.
And why worry? Because someday, you prac

tical jokeis, theie may be a tire complete
with flames
Although the danger ot tire supexsedes all
others, the statistics ot accident and expense
as quoted by Fire Chief Marston show more
coldly the arguments against further student
antics.
More accidents have occurred at Stanford
when the engines whip through campus
traffic than at the fires themselves—so there's
danger every time the engines are called out.
To answer one call costs the University 100
dollars; to repair the damage caused in Roble
Thursday night will cost 300. We think the
answer is self-evident. Smoke bombs, and
similar false alarms, are lugubriously un
funny.
