# BULL SESSION

Back again from a trip to the land of dark
glassed and platinum blondes (not to mention
an occasional redheadâ€”with blonde roots, of
course). Trekked down there over the week
end for the Daily to tag the initial conference
endeavors of the surprising Stanford hoop
siors. Or at least that's what I told the editor.
You'd be surprised how much you can learn
by staying home and listening to the game on
the radio while a sultry wench runs her hand
through your hair and murmurs, "Baby, what
you don't have, you don't need," as she runs
her other hand through your wallet. Baby,
what she doesn't take, you don't have.
Besides, you can always get the box scores
out of the L.A. Times the next day.
The L.A. sportswriters went as completely
overboard on the Bruin basketballers to push
Stanford all over the floor as they did for
U.C.L.A. to Chase Illinois out of the Rose Bowl.
After Friday's upset, numerous comparisons
of the two setbacks to Bruin prestige were
heard.
It looked like another case of the Uclans
spending too much time reading their press
noiices. But make no mistake, it was a fiery
Stanford team and not Bruin overconfidence
that resulted in Friday night's astounding up
set. And the Indians might well have swept
the series by taking Saturday's tilt if Johnny
Stanich hadn't gotten so hot for the Westwood
five.
The Indian five is a terrific defensive team
and with one really consistent high-scoring

player (of the Howie Dallmar caliber) could
probably cop the PCC title. If, with more ex
perience, one of the present squad develops
into that, the Cards may really surprise the
conference this season.

Speaking of sports, the lads at the Firehouse
copped the intramural football title last quar
ter, and now have another trophy to stack
with their large collection on the mantel
alongside the pot they hauled down from the
chapel last fall. All they need now is a wim
dow.
Incidentally, the Firehouse boys had a long
standing ambition satisfied the other night and
have been unhappy ever since. For years,
they've dreamed of an after-hours fire at Roble
so that they could manfully rescue the beau
tiful girls in their diaphanous (aha!) negligees
and flowing hair, that sleepy, sultry look in
their eyes as they fainted gracefully in the
arms of our heroes.
Dreams came true a couple of nights ago.
and the firemen, smiling happily at thoughts
of a fate-worse-than-death, rushed into the
frosh dorm. Better it should have been death.
The breakfast hashers could have warned
them.
Beautiful damsels in clinging gowns?
Hardly. Dumpy bathrobes, cold-cream plas
tered faces, and surly grouches completely
spoiled any illusions the fireboys might have
had.
It's a cruel world.
