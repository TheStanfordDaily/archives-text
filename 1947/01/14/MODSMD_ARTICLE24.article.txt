To the Editor:
I would like to know what excuse the adminis
tration of one of the most generously endowed
schools in the world (Stanford, that is—statistics
cannot be denied!) can possibly offer for the miser
able condition of the four little miles of main roads
approaching the school from the highway.
Shaken chassis might well lead to shaken con
fidence in the handling of University affairs.

Opinion UrtW we consulted Alf'E. Brandin, Busi
iifiAss Manager.' Iff stated that the University is not
one of the greatest endowed schools in the country
(we are thirteenth, and that a large percentage of

the endowments we receive are restricted for speci
fied uses.
"We know the roads are bad," he said, "but we
just don't have the money to fix them. We are re
pairing the worst places and will continue to do so.
Things pertaining directly to education come first
with the money we have."
'"I he roads are especially bad now," he said, "be
cause during the war it was impossible to get mate
rials; so no repairing was done." Because of Stan
lord's adobe soil, in order to make repairs you have
to dig out a lot of the infirm foundation and (ill il
with rocks putting on the road surface;, other-'
wise the road surface slides and makes bumps and 1
ridges. Therefore the repair process lakes longer and
is more expensive than for most road repair work.
So lor these reasons, no large scale repair work is
planned for the immediate future.")
