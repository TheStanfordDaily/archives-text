## HISTORY 1947 
### 
Whether or not, as in the words of yesterday's
Daily, the international scene grows "more and more
ominous, the world is a miserable place for a large
portion of its people. I could run through the script
of misery—lndia, China. Palestine, Annam, the oc
cupied nations, the war-ravaged, Greece, Spain, et
cetera, ad nauseam.
At this point I am moved to inquire by what light
and title, by what excelling merit of its citizens, the
United States is enabled to enjoy life. And we have
none. Nothing but the grace of God and the accidents
of geography and history stand between us and an
equal measure of disaster. Still it is a fact that this
is one of the few countries left where the individual
can pursue happiness in his own way and anticipate
the attainment of a modicum of whatever he imag
ines happiness to consist. A country, I may say,
where the economic system works with a minimum
of official poking and prodding, yet manages to sat
isfy the greatest part of its people.
That the American economic and political or
ganization satisfies most of the people is demon
strated by the recent strikes. John L. Lewis bowed
to the order of a federal court when, realistically, it
would have been almost impossible to break the
miners' strike by force. In the recent general strike
in Oakland, there were no troops called out, not even
an injunction issued; Dave Beck denounced the
strike as revolutionary and ordered his teamsters
back to work.
On the other hand, let us compare the U.S. with

Britain. Now, in language, law. economics, and poli
tics Great Britain stands as our mother country.
(One of our Irish members may dissent; I will not
hear him unless he dissents in Gaelic.) There is a
labor government in Britain: they are proceeding to
nationalization of basic industries and to a substan
tial measure of government planning. Yet there is
a transport strike in London; the strikers have re
fused to listen to their government or their leaders;
and troops have been called out to move food into
the city. And more: the troops are only moving the
food without which the Londoners cannot live, yet
sympathy strikes in protest are spreading.
I have a reason for demonstrating this contrast
between Britain and the U.S. Since the Labor gov
ernment in that kingdom took office and befean the
execution of its admittedly socialistic program. Brit
ishers have not ceased from pointing out how ad
vanced, progressive, and truly democratic is their
government and its program, nor how backward,
reactionary, and unsound is our own. I realize that
Britain fought a longer, harder war than our own;
I know that they fought while we were arming; I
am aware, having seen them, that their cities were
bombed. Nevertheless, Britain, with other nations,
has seen fit to criticize our institutions and to main
tain the superiority of their own. The facts I have
presented demonstrate the surpassing logic of their
position: our system or lack of system works to the
satisfaction of our people; their system apparently
does not. Therefore, we are wrong and they are
right. Which, in the logician's phrase, is absurd.

On the other hand, let us compare the U.S. with

Britain. Now, in language, law. economics, and poli
tics Great Britain stands as our mother country.
(One of our Irish members may dissent; I will not
hear him unless he dissents in Gaelic.) There is a
labor government in Britain: they are proceeding to
nationalization of basic industries and to a substan
tial measure of government planning. Yet there is
a transport strike in London; the strikers have re
fused to listen to their government or their leaders;
and troops have been called out to move food into
the city. And more: the troops are only moving the
food without which the Londoners cannot live, yet
sympathy strikes in protest are spreading.
I have a reason for demonstrating this contrast
between Britain and the U.S. Since the Labor gov
ernment in that kingdom took office and befean the
execution of its admittedly socialistic program. Brit
ishers have not ceased from pointing out how ad
vanced, progressive, and truly democratic is their
government and its program, nor how backward,
reactionary, and unsound is our own. I realize that
Britain fought a longer, harder war than our own;
I know that they fought while we were arming; I
am aware, having seen them, that their cities were
bombed. Nevertheless, Britain, with other nations,
has seen fit to criticize our institutions and to main
tain the superiority of their own. The facts I have
presented demonstrate the surpassing logic of their
position: our system or lack of system works to the
satisfaction of our people; their system apparently
does not. Therefore, we are wrong and they are
right. Which, in the logician's phrase, is absurd.
Whether or not, as in the words of yesterday's
Daily, the international scene grows "more and more
ominous, the world is a miserable place for a large
portion of its people. I could run through the script
of misery—lndia, China. Palestine, Annam, the oc
cupied nations, the war-ravaged, Greece, Spain, et
cetera, ad nauseam.
At this point I am moved to inquire by what light
and title, by what excelling merit of its citizens, the
United States is enabled to enjoy life. And we have
none. Nothing but the grace of God and the accidents
of geography and history stand between us and an
equal measure of disaster. Still it is a fact that this
is one of the few countries left where the individual
can pursue happiness in his own way and anticipate
the attainment of a modicum of whatever he imag
ines happiness to consist. A country, I may say,
where the economic system works with a minimum
of official poking and prodding, yet manages to sat
isfy the greatest part of its people.
That the American economic and political or
ganization satisfies most of the people is demon
strated by the recent strikes. John L. Lewis bowed
to the order of a federal court when, realistically, it
would have been almost impossible to break the
miners' strike by force. In the recent general strike
in Oakland, there were no troops called out, not even
an injunction issued; Dave Beck denounced the
strike as revolutionary and ordered his teamsters
back to work.
