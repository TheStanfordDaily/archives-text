# 'Razor's Edge' Is Glossy, Smooth Falsely Emotional Extravaganza
## 
### 
Thf Razor's Edge," now playing at the Stanford Theater, is not only '
Twentieth Century-Fox's bid for this year's Academy Award, but it cost
a cool three million dollars to make. These two things should make it a j
great picture, but they don't.
They do make it a good picture, and one which might well have been

terrific. There are stars enough—
Tyrone Power, Gene Tierney, John
Payne, Herbert Marshall, and Anne
Baxter, to mention only the major
members of the cast — but, other
than Miss Baxter, none are out
standing.
Miss Baxter's hard, brutal por
trayal of Sophie, the good girl who
goes wrong, is a truly fine perform
ance, but then the public has come
to expect nothing else from this
star, who has yet to fill a poor role.
Tyrone Power, as Larry Darrell,
is still Tyrone Power, and some
where along about the third reel
you get tired of hearing he is con
fused and without hope. He looks
too happy all the time.
Miss Gene Tierney is convincing
but not great as Isabel, and along
with the rest of the cast acts as if
she really doesn't care much one
way or the other what happens to
the picture.
On the whole "'The Razor's Edge"
suffers from a fault which is some
thing basic in Hollywood. It is
glossy and smooth, easy to see,
pleasant to watch, but without con
viction. There is a lack of sincerity,
a fake emotionalism, which is un
fortunately a feature of most Amer
ican pictures these days.
Still, "The Razor's Edge" will un
doubtedly pay Darryl F. Zanuck
those three million iron men he
soaked into it. But it probably won't
drag down the Academy Award, al
though stranger things have hap
pened in Hollywood.—Heintze
