# â€˜Art Under Fire' Still Under Cover
## 
### 
"Fine Art Under Fire," the ex
hibit that was to open in Stanford's
Art Gallery yesterday, has been
withheld because of an incomplete
redecorating job. The walls and
lloor of the front room of the gal
lery are being painted and with a
delay in the work, the gallery will
not open for another week.
In addition to the redecorating,
the Leventritt Oriental exhibit i.s
being reorganized and arranged in
chronological order. This exhibit
contains bronze bowls from the
Shang Dynasty (1760-1100 8.C.) and
representative relics of periods up
through the Ching Dynasty in pot
tery and porcelain.
