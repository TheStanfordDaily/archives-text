# Amazing Indian Quintet Lines Sights on Berkeley
## 
### 
A fresh scalp dangles from the wall of the Trophy Room over
in the S.A.C. tonight, and down in the southlands a rather sur
prised Bruin sits rubbing his now bald pate. The Cardinal hoop
sters received a cold welcome from the members of the fourth
estate upon their arrival in LA, but on Friday evening the boys

from Palo Alto made things hot for
the scribes, and the Uclans, to the
time of 38 -33.
Derogatory statements about
the Stanford five before the first
yame set the stage for another
Illinois-style debacle. "Paly Pa
lookas," "weakest team in the
conference," and "U.C.L.A. a sure
bet," were matched by Morlcy
Thompson's 12 points, Bill Ste
phenson's !), Dave Davidson's S,
and Babe Higgins' 7 counters, and
that was enough to topple the
touted Uclan courtmen.
Six men turned the trick for the
Red Machine during that first game.
It was a yeoman piece of work and
although it managed to bring vic
tory during the first encounter, it

was the cause of defeat in the sec
ond. U.C.L.A. used 10 men against
the Indians, and the wearing down
process made itself felt in the sec
ond affair. Thompson, Berlin, Da
vidson, Stephenson, Higgins and
Lewis, the men who licked the
vaunted Bruin offense on Friday,
were just too tired on Saturday and
the game went by the boards, 48-40.
As the Saturday eve fray wore
on it became readily apparent
that as .substitute replaced regu
lar for the Indians, the team be
came greener and greener. The
1 CÂ»-4 margin that the Cards held
over the "West wood Wonders"
after the first ten minutes of play
evaporated under the pressure of
innumerable U.C.L.A. substitu
tions. It was 25-23 in favor of the
local boys at half-time, but that
was the end of the waltz. The
Uelans in the form of short John
Stanich began dropping in a bar
rage of baskets from some .15 feet
out and that was the ball game.
Coach Everett Dean, when ques
tioned about the games and the
U.C.LA. team in general, replied to
Ihe effect that the Uelans were still
to be reckoned with in the confer
ence play and that Davage Minor
and Don Barksdale are the players
who hold the Westwood squad to
gether. Coach Dean also holds the
opinion that at present the cream
of the conference appears to be the
Berkeley edition of the University
of California, but the test which will
really decide that fact will come
when the Bears are forced to "hit
the road" to seek their victories.
California is next on the ledger
for the Dean-men. The team
which eked through two victories
against All-America Gene Rock
and Company, holds open house
for the visiting Indian varsity on
Friday evening and then travels
south to Palo Alto for the second
of a four-game home and home
series. At present Cal. under the
direction of Coach Nibs Price, is
sitting on top of the conference
pile with two victories against
not a single failure. Stanford and
U.C.L.A. share second honors with
a record of one victory and one
defeat apiece.
Tickets tor the two games against
Cal go on sale this morning at 8:30
at the Pavilion. Far be it from us
to campaign for mob violence, but
we do advise all those interested in
seeing and not hearing the games
to be present with 50 cents for each
ducat, plus their student body cards,
as close to the opening time as pos
sible.
One thousand tickets have been
exchanged with Cal for each of the
contests. That leaves some 1,600
tickets available for the Saturday
eve fracas at the Pavilion, and of
course one thousand for the Berke
ley bingle. For the 5,400 students
who will miss seeing these frays,
we beg to advise you that the games
will be broadcast; that should help
some of you, that is, if you have a
radio!
