## 
### 
In the first debate of the winter
quarter, at 7:HO last night. Stanford
won the decision of the judges over
the University of California. Dow
Carpenter and Frank Church rep
resented' Stanford on the negative
side of the question: "Resolved, that
federal control of labor unions
should be increased." On the affir
mative side, representing the Uni
versity of California, were Marvin
Frankel and Donald Bell.
The debaters, introduced by
James A. Work, professor of Eng
lish. spoke to an audience that al
most filled the Education Audito
rium. Carpenter and Church were
coached bv Leland Chapin, asso
ciate professor of speech and drama.
The debate was judged by Ralph
Evans of the Palo Alto post office;
Clifford Giffin. former president of
(he Palo Alio Typographical Union,
and the Rev. G. Arthur Casaday of
the Congregational Church.
At the end of the formal debate,
an open forum was declared during
which many of the audience asked
questions of the debaters until the
decision of the judges was an
nounced.
In co-ordination with this debate,
another one will be held tonight at
the University of California on the
same question. In this debate,
Malcolm Barrett and Robert Ben
nett will represent Stanford on the
affirmative side of the question, and
two students from California will
take the opposite side.
