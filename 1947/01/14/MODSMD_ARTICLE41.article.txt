### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 12 (UP).—
The National Boxing Association's
quarterly ratings of the world's pro
fessional fighters, released today,
established two sharply contrasting
records:
(1) They named five logical
championship contenders in the
middleweight division, and (2) they
refused to recognize a single logical
contender in either the heavy
weight or welterweight divisions.
Col. Harvey L. Miller, executive
secretary of the N.8.A., said, "Nev
er before has our organization rec
ognized as many as five contenders
for any crown, and never before has
it marked "none available" in the
contenders' brackets of two divi
sions."
In Champion Tony Zale's middle
weight class, the five logical con
tenders were Jake Lainotta of New
York, Marcel "Cerdan of France,
Charley Urley of Pittsburgh, Rocky
Graziano of New York, and Georgia
Abrams of Washington, D.C.
Col. Miller emphasized that the
large number of contenders in the
MiO-pound class reflected not only
the "unprecedentcdly stiff competi
tion" in the division but also the fact
that the average young man in
America today is a middleweight.
