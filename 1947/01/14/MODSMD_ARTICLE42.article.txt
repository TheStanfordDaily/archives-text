NEW YORK, Jan. 13 (UP).—
Home run king Babe Ruth is
"slightly improved" but he still lies
quietly in bed and makes no effort
to talk to any of his attendants, it
was revealed today in the latest
bulletin on his condition at French
Hospital.
Ruth underwent a neck operation
a week ago today and has not re
covered as rapidly as had been ex
pected. He does not complain of
as much pain as he did last week,
the bulletin said. The operation was
performed to relieve "intractable
pain" in his head.
