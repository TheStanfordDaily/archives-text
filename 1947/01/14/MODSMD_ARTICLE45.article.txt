# Sports Gets The 'Word'
## Hoover Says Clean Up, Or Be Cleaned by Public 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13.—(UP) —Aroused by the pro football

"bribe scandal" in New York, Director J. Edgar Hoover of the
FBI tonight warned both promoters and players in professional
and amateur sports to start a house-cleaning before a stunned
public demands one.
He flashed the red light against crooked sports in an inter-

view as Rep. F. Edward Herbert. D.,
La., introduced a bill that would slap
a $10,000 fine and 10 years in prison
on anyone trying to bribe pro or
amateur athletes in "interstate"
sporting events.
Herbert said his measure was an
outgrowth of the recent New York
Giants professional football scandal
in which Alvin Paris was convicted
of attempting to bribe two Giant
stars. Herbert discussed the bill with
Hoover's superior, U. S. Attorney
General Tom C. Clark, before offer
ing it.
Commissioner Bert Bell of the
National Professional Football
League had appealed to Clark for
enactment of such legislation.
Hoover opposed seeking a cure by
legislation except as a "last resort."
He said the primary responsibility
in keeping sports "clean and uncon
taminated" rests with the promoters
and players themselves.
An ardent sports fan himself, the
FBI head cautioned that there is no
time to be lost in placing sports
"above the ugly rumors of fixes and
control by gamblers."
"The sight of the scum of the
gamblers that have frequented- all
professional sports contests, even
practicing their lecherous activi
ties in the very arenas where the
contests are in progress, has
stunned the fair play conscience
of the great body of the public."
he said. "The average American,
particularly the youth, takes bis
sports seriously and wants them
clean and unsullied."
Herbert said his primary interest
in sponsoring his anti-bribe bill was
to protect "the kids who believe our
sports are part and parcel of our
American way of life."
The bill would apply only to sports
events for which contestants travel
between states since the federal
government does not have jurisdic
tion over intrastate problems. It
would apply, for example, to a game
between the Chicago Bears and the
New York Giants but would not
aft'ect a contest in Chicago between
the Bears and the Chicago Card
inals.
Hoover said promoters and play
ers have a "sacred duty" to keep
their actions above reproach and
to maintain high ideals of sports
manship—"a duty which no local
or federal law can relieve them
of, even in part."
He recommended the following
three-point program to keep sports
"clean and unsullied:"
1. A determined effort to keep
sports "above reproach."
2. Strict enforcement of local and
state laws prohibiting gambling.
3. Those connected with all types
of sports should meet with "swift
and vigorous action" any deviation
from sportsmanship goals, whether
induced by expediency, financial
pressure or selfish interests.

pressure or selfish interests.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13.—(UP) —Aroused by the pro football

"bribe scandal" in New York, Director J. Edgar Hoover of the
FBI tonight warned both promoters and players in professional
and amateur sports to start a house-cleaning before a stunned
public demands one.
He flashed the red light against crooked sports in an inter-

view as Rep. F. Edward Herbert. D.,
La., introduced a bill that would slap
a $10,000 fine and 10 years in prison
on anyone trying to bribe pro or
amateur athletes in "interstate"
sporting events.
Herbert said his measure was an
outgrowth of the recent New York
Giants professional football scandal
in which Alvin Paris was convicted
of attempting to bribe two Giant
stars. Herbert discussed the bill with
Hoover's superior, U. S. Attorney
General Tom C. Clark, before offer
ing it.
Commissioner Bert Bell of the
National Professional Football
League had appealed to Clark for
enactment of such legislation.
Hoover opposed seeking a cure by
legislation except as a "last resort."
He said the primary responsibility
in keeping sports "clean and uncon
taminated" rests with the promoters
and players themselves.
An ardent sports fan himself, the
FBI head cautioned that there is no
time to be lost in placing sports
"above the ugly rumors of fixes and
control by gamblers."
"The sight of the scum of the
gamblers that have frequented- all
professional sports contests, even
practicing their lecherous activi
ties in the very arenas where the
contests are in progress, has
stunned the fair play conscience
of the great body of the public."
he said. "The average American,
particularly the youth, takes bis
sports seriously and wants them
clean and unsullied."
Herbert said his primary interest
in sponsoring his anti-bribe bill was
to protect "the kids who believe our
sports are part and parcel of our
American way of life."
The bill would apply only to sports
events for which contestants travel
between states since the federal
government does not have jurisdic
tion over intrastate problems. It
would apply, for example, to a game
between the Chicago Bears and the
New York Giants but would not
aft'ect a contest in Chicago between
the Bears and the Chicago Card
inals.
Hoover said promoters and play
ers have a "sacred duty" to keep
their actions above reproach and
to maintain high ideals of sports
manship—"a duty which no local
or federal law can relieve them
of, even in part."
He recommended the following
three-point program to keep sports
"clean and unsullied:"
1. A determined effort to keep
sports "above reproach."
2. Strict enforcement of local and
state laws prohibiting gambling.
3. Those connected with all types
of sports should meet with "swift
and vigorous action" any deviation
from sportsmanship goals, whether
induced by expediency, financial
pressure or selfish interests.
