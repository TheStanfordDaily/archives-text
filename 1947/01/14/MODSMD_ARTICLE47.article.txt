# How Fast, Far, High
## Heat On Hamilton 
### 
NEW YORK. Jan. 13 (UP).—With
the Olympics still two years away,
track-wise Europeans already are
putting the pressure on University
of California Track Coach Brutus
Hamilton for another set of predic
tions on "perfect records." Or—just
how far can a man run, how high
can he jump and how far can he
throw a weight?
Hamilton is elected because he
started the whole business in the
first place. # A dozen years ago he
boldly proclaimed the answers, but
a world-wide assault on track and
field records soon made him blush
at his lack of faith in the human
race.
Approximately half the marks
lie listed as the "ultimate of hu
man effort" — including the mile
run—have been surpassed.
Undaunted, Hamilton is prepar
ing a new list and it probably will
be headed by a four-minute mile,
goal of distance runners since the
stop-watch first became as impor
tant to track as man against man.
A survey compiled for European
experts revealed Hamilton's pre
dictions for nine of 18 metric
distances and other international
events had been reduced from the
realm of "ultimate possibilities" into
actual world records.
Among the events more popular
in the U.S.. the mile prediction of
4:01. G went by the boards (when
Sweden's Arne Andersson went
the distance in 4:01.(i) but the
100 - yard dash ultimate of 9.1
seconds still holds up. To knock
over that one, the "ultimate run
ner" will have to be about four
yards faster than Jesse Owens,
Frank Wykoff or Clyde Jeffrey,
co-holders of the world record of
9.4 seconds.
Sweden's Gunder Hagg, now a
pro, and Rudolf Harbig of Germany
contributed the major shares in
making a shambles of Hamilton's
forecasts by accounting for five
world records in times faster than
the Californian considered the ab
solute limit.
Running 1,500 meters in 3:43,
Hagg bettered Hamilton's prophecy
by 1.78 seconds; he ran the 3,000
meters in 8:01.2 which was 4.7 sec
onds better than - the ultimate; he
clipped 4.16 seconds off Hamilton's
predictions by running 5,000 meters
in 13:58.2.

at his lack of faith in the human
race.
Approximately half the marks
lie listed as the "ultimate of hu
man effort" — including the mile
run—have been surpassed.
Undaunted, Hamilton is prepar
ing a new list and it probably will
be headed by a four-minute mile,
goal of distance runners since the
stop-watch first became as impor
tant to track as man against man.
A survey compiled for European
experts revealed Hamilton's pre
dictions for nine of 18 metric
distances and other international
events had been reduced from the
realm of "ultimate possibilities" into
actual world records.
Among the events more popular
in the U.S.. the mile prediction of
4:01. G went by the boards (when
Sweden's Arne Andersson went
the distance in 4:01.(i) but the
100 - yard dash ultimate of 9.1
seconds still holds up. To knock
over that one, the "ultimate run
ner" will have to be about four
yards faster than Jesse Owens,
Frank Wykoff or Clyde Jeffrey,
co-holders of the world record of
9.4 seconds.
Sweden's Gunder Hagg, now a
pro, and Rudolf Harbig of Germany
contributed the major shares in
making a shambles of Hamilton's
forecasts by accounting for five
world records in times faster than
the Californian considered the ab
solute limit.
Running 1,500 meters in 3:43,
Hagg bettered Hamilton's prophecy
by 1.78 seconds; he ran the 3,000
meters in 8:01.2 which was 4.7 sec
onds better than - the ultimate; he
clipped 4.16 seconds off Hamilton's
predictions by running 5,000 meters
in 13:58.2.
NEW YORK. Jan. 13 (UP).—With
the Olympics still two years away,
track-wise Europeans already are
putting the pressure on University
of California Track Coach Brutus
Hamilton for another set of predic
tions on "perfect records." Or—just
how far can a man run, how high
can he jump and how far can he
throw a weight?
Hamilton is elected because he
started the whole business in the
first place. # A dozen years ago he
boldly proclaimed the answers, but
a world-wide assault on track and
field records soon made him blush
at his lack of faith in the human
race.
Approximately half the marks
lie listed as the "ultimate of hu
man effort" — including the mile
run—have been surpassed.
