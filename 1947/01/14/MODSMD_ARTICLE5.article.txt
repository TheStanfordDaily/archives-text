# Duncan, Audience Mutually Pleased
## 
### 
Todd Duncan's carefully re
strained program last night varied
from the slow resonance and deep
measures of Handel and Brahms to
the heady beats of "Omimba" (a
Haitian folk song) and the vibrant
melancholy of Gershwin's "Porgy
and Bess."
His distinctive stage presence was
emphasized by an unusually clear
enunciation (even in the German
and French numbers of Handel,
Brahms, and Strauss) and a simple
control of voice modulation.
A responsive audience (which
Mr. Duncan hack-stage termed "one
of my most enjoyable") called him j
back for two encores during the |
performance and several following
the last number.
Mr. Duncan's accompanyist, Wil
liam Allen, was ideal in his lack of
solo work and his sense of timing.
