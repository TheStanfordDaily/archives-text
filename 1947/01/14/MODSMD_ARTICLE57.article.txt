The use of techniques involving pres

In addition to improving the existing
processes of manufacturing ammonia,

organic and physical chemists, chemi

high pressure syntheses for the follow
ing: ethylene glycol; hexamet hylenc
diamine; aeet ic, propionic and hydroxy
aeetic acids; methyl formate; ('«-. (" lo
and (", 2 - alcohols; and numerous ot hers.
Advantages and Problems
The use of high pressures offers numer
ous advantage* familiar to technical
students, such as: (1) forcing an equi
librium in t he direct ion of a volume de
crease, (2) overcoming the reversing
effect of high temperatures in exother
mic reactions, (.'}) increasing reaction
and through-put rates and ('I) provid
ing. in some cases, a liquid phase which
might not otherwise be present .
The synthesis of urea from carbon
dioxide ;itid ammonia is a good illus
tration of some of these principles:
COj -I- 2NH 3 > COiNIIjIJ + II 2 0
With three moles of reactants and only
two of resultants, increase of preusure
eivesan expected increase in conversion.

At the same time, the gaseous reactants
are forced into the liquid phase to give
higher concentrations and again better
conversion. The react ion rate and there
lore the rate of passage through t lie re
action chamber are both increased by
increasing the temperature under high
pressure conditions. There are other
equilibrium considerations that affect
the industri.-d production of urea, but
they are lon lengthy to discuss here.
Along with its advantages, the use of
high pressure gives rise to problems that
often severely tax the abilities of engi
neers and chemists. For example, (1)
difficulties of design of packing glands,
valves, connecting rods, closures, etc.,
increase rapidly with increased pres
sure, (2) extraordinary corrosion prob
lems arise in which even stainless steels
are attacked and cannot be used, (1))
ordinary steels are permeable to hydro
gen at higher pressures and tempera
tures. These are but a few illustrations
of the challenge that, high pressure
studies present to the technical man
and particularly to the metallurgical
and mechanical engineer.
High pressure synthesis has now be
come a separate field of indust rial chem
ist ry with an apparent lv limi; less future.

and (", 2 - alcohols; and numerous ot hers.
Advantages and Problems
The use of high pressures offers numer
ous advantage* familiar to technical
students, such as: (1) forcing an equi
librium in t he direct ion of a volume de
crease, (2) overcoming the reversing
effect of high temperatures in exother
mic reactions, (.'}) increasing reaction
and through-put rates and ('I) provid
ing. in some cases, a liquid phase which
might not otherwise be present .
The synthesis of urea from carbon
dioxide ;itid ammonia is a good illus
tration of some of these principles:
COj -I- 2NH 3 > COiNIIjIJ + II 2 0
With three moles of reactants and only
two of resultants, increase of preusure
eivesan expected increase in conversion.

At the same time, the gaseous reactants
are forced into the liquid phase to give
higher concentrations and again better
conversion. The react ion rate and there
lore the rate of passage through t lie re
action chamber are both increased by
increasing the temperature under high
pressure conditions. There are other
equilibrium considerations that affect
the industri.-d production of urea, but
they are lon lengthy to discuss here.
Along with its advantages, the use of
high pressure gives rise to problems that
often severely tax the abilities of engi
neers and chemists. For example, (1)
difficulties of design of packing glands,
valves, connecting rods, closures, etc.,
increase rapidly with increased pres
sure, (2) extraordinary corrosion prob
lems arise in which even stainless steels
are attacked and cannot be used, (1))
ordinary steels are permeable to hydro
gen at higher pressures and tempera
tures. These are but a few illustrations
of the challenge that, high pressure
studies present to the technical man
and particularly to the metallurgical
and mechanical engineer.
