Naval Intelligence in Germany, in
speaking yesterday before the Stan
ford Faculty Women's Club.

formation at the University, pointed

FBI IS EXAMPLE
"The Federal Bureau of Investi- >
gation also offers an example pf the
effectiveness of an efficient eivilan 1
j organization, but its operations are |
limited to the United States. The ,
Army and the Navy have special ;
interest and special skills which i
make a co-ordinated military, na- 1
val, and civilian service advisable,"
j the speaker said.
CRITICIZES PRESENT PLAN
He criticized the present plan of >
establishing an intelligence service i
under the State Department as a j
contradiction in policy.
"It puts the State Department in
the position of patting other nations j
! on the back while at the same time !
| picking their pockets," Glover said. |
He also pointed out that the [
United States was so free in its
handling of national defense infor
mation that successful espionage
against the country amounted large
ly to an efficient clipping service
| and intelligent correlation and in
j terpretation of the clippings.
