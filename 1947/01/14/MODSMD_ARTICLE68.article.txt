A difficult problem in stage set
ting presented itself to the stage
crew in the coming bill of one-acts,
"John Doe" by Bernard Dryer and
"My Heart's in the Highlands" by
William Saroyan, which opens its
four-day run tomorrow night at 8
in the Little Theater.
The difficulty, according to Wen
da) 1 Cole of the Speech and Drama
Department, lay in the fact that Sa- J
royan's comedy involves a great j
deal of heavy scenery that has to be j
moved onto the small Little Thoa- j
ter stage during a short intermis- !
sion. Usually "My Heart's in the
Highlands" is given alone so that i
♦he scenery can remain in place
during the play, but this time "John I
Doe" is being presented first and !
settings must be changed quickly, i
"It's an awfully big »how for such j
a small stage," admits Cole, "but we I
have coped with it as usual."
The sets of "My Heart's in the \
Highlands" were designed by Cole I
and were built by Cole, Julio Fran- j
cescutti, John Finch, and Newton
Arnold, who gave up part of their
Christmas vacation to work on 1
them.
Dryer's drama is unusual on two ;
counts. First it is given in a space j
staging. This means that there is
no usual scenery—ramps, platforms,

{ and drapes will give the desired ef
i feet. The scenery is all black with
j lights doing the job of the regular
I sets.
The second unusual aspect of ,
j "John Doe" is that the actors play
j down into tlje audience. They will
| not play entirely on the stage as
usual, but will be in the audience
j some of the time.
Tickets are on sale for 00 cents
| in room 201 in Memorial Hall. There
i are only 200 tickets lor each night.
