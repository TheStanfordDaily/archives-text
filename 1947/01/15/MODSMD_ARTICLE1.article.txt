# IT CONCERNS US

### CHARLES MARTIN RALPH HOVIS 
(Pitifully inadequate from the
layman's point of view arc the
sources where he can find a com
prehensive analysis of the main
trends in United States economic,
social, and political life or the
bases of its foreign policy. In an
attempt to compile all pertinent
information, public and specific
opinion and plans for action on
the major problems facing the
United States, Ralph Ilovis and
Charles Martin will write a week
ly feature for the Daily entitled
"II Concerns Us." We hope their
writings will supply the average
student with a springboard for
opinion, understanding, and fur
ther research 011 the problems
hereafter discussed. — Editorial
note)

To the Readers:
We will be filling up space once
a week in the Daily. We will be
writing about national and inter
national problems. We have chosen
these problems because their solu
tions will afreet our personal, indi-

vidual lives.
.We make no
claim to be au
thorities on such
subjects but we
hope to present
these affairs in
a different light.
We believe the
individual is all
important. Con
sequently we do
not care about
changing an y -
one's opinion.
What we would
like to prove is

that your opinion is important upon
these affairs—wc want those opin
ions.
In regard to our personal political
and economic viewpoints on these
problems, it won't take long to see
that we have differences! We be
lieve we are Liberals, by our own
definitions. In fact, our second ar
ticle will discuss just that—Liberal
ism. Today, for possibly the only
time, we agree—and we present our
own* cursory survey of the State of
the Union.
INTERNATIONAL
The international situation, need
less to say, is complex. Much has
been accomplished since the end of
the war —the U.N. has been estab
lished and is functioning. But the
peacemaking has not been satisfac
tory. Though the decision of Avhat
to do with Germany is extremely
important, it is two years since the
end of the war and no peace treaty
has yet been signed.
Today the Lcnd-Lcnsc equipped
French forces are fighting the
valiant people's independence
movement in French Indo-China.
Imperialism still exists. The U.S.
Navy insists upon keeping control
of its Pacific bases. Regardless of
French and U.S. action, however,
imperialism is declining. The es
tablishment of (lie U.N. Trustee
ship Council is a memorable ac
tion in that respect. It gives hope
to the colonial peoples and pro
vides for their eventual indc
pendnce.
Other accomplishments of the
U.N. General Assembly are of no
table importance. Fundamental
principles have been adopted which
can bring about a progressive re
duction in armaments, the outlaw
ing of all weapons of mass destruc
tion — including the atom bomb —
and U.N. control and inspection free
in operation from the use of the
veto. The problem now is the es
tablishment of a system providing
for enforcement of the principles
agreed upon. This is the responsi
bility of the Security Council.
The crux of nearly every inter
national problem is the problem of
U.S.-Soviet relations. We must re
solve our differences with the So
viet Union or the much talked-of
war with Russia will be inevitable.

' The real reason for optimism lies
| in the fact that the U.N. exists,
j Should it carry out the purposes for
j which it was created, the errors of
omission or commission of the pres
-1 ent peacemakers will be corrected
j by the U.N. in the years to come.
POLITICAL
A cursory view of the present na
! tional political scene involves these
| considerations: The Americans vot
-led in the November elections in
| protest against too much govern -
j mont, too many controls, too much
labor coddling, and too high prices,
j The vote was no doubt a delayed
1 reaction from 194. The Republican
| sweep, however, has had a sober-
I ing effect upon GOP leaders. They
! have important issues to meet and
I there is division within the party
| ranks as to the methods of meeting
j these issues.
There will be some disagree
ments upon how much to reduce
tariffs, how much to cut taxes,
and how much to regulate labor.
There is agreement that some la
bor legislation is needed, that a
| balanced budget is essential, that
basic foreign policy should, for
the most part, remain unchanged,
and that nothing should interfere
with a free economic system.
The differences which the Repub
| lican party must reconcile are the
i Conservatives' fears of any intro
! duct ion of novel elements in the
j present economic system, and the
j Liberals' or Progressives' realization
of the inevitability of change and
their readiness to meet with the
new forces. It. is evident that pro
! gressive leadership is expected by
I the people from Republicans.
ECONOMIC
i 011 the economic front, our sur
j vey contains two considerations.

The first, the
global chal
lenge, finds the
U.S. bucking a
world trend. It
is returning to
a free economy
while the rest of
the world moves
to the Left—to
ward mole eco
nomic controls.
This means
the U.S. must
show the valid
ity of its own
economic sys-

tem. The stabilization of our do
mestic economy and the prevention
of a severe depression are basic re
quirement for the economic reha
bilitation of Europe and Asia, the
existence of the new British econ
omy, and the political influence of
the U.S. in the world community.
The U.S. will be expected to extend
loans and credits to foreign nations
so that they may buy our goods,
also to lower tariff barriers so that
the same foreign nations may sell
more to the U.S., securing dollars
to pay off the loans and credits.
The domestic problem calls for
orderly conversion from a war
time economy to our former free
economy, without the pitfalls such
as we suffered in the early UKlO's.
We have achieved full employ
ment, and removed most of the
food and goods shortages. Net
corporate profits have soared. The
gross national product, meaning
goods, services, and construction,
reached new highs. In spite of
this, production has not met our
expectations. The housing situa
tion is still critical. Many cor
porations possess red-inked fig
ures on their year-end reports.
Bahson and other economists fear
recessions or minor depressions.
Lahor and management are still
in conflict.
To help solve the problem, labor
must realize that their prosperity
