# Vocom Scries To Hear Bailey
## 
### 
Dr. Margery Bailey will open a
special scries sponsored by Vocom
when she speaks tomorrow night at
7:15 in the auditorium of the Wo
men's Clubhouse. All women are in
vited to attend.
Miss Bailey, associate professor of
English will emphasize the import
ance of college to the average girl
from a liberal education aspect, out
side of the vocational point of view.
She will especially attempt to help
those freshmen and sophomores
whose reasons for attending college
are not yet well defined.
Many generations of Stanford stu
dents have had the benefit of Miss
Bailey's instruction in Shakespeare
courses, which have made her a
leader in her field.
Students, who might otherwise be
unable to take her courses, will have
the opportunity to hear her, as she
advances a perspective to those
whose goal in college is still unclear.
In this same series of talks, Vocom
will sponsor four more talks this
quarter in an attempt to aid women
students in choosing their major, and
in preparing for their vocations.
