# Bruises, Forgotten Names Follow Rushing Opening
## 
### FERRIS BOOTHE 
While fraternity men and potential rushees alike nursed bruised right
hands and vainly tried to recall those forgotten names from last night's
opening of rushing, pre-war fraternity men agreed that the numbers of
visitors seemed about the same as before the war.
Freshmen and transfers continue their visits along the Row tonight

from 7 to 9, while luncheon and din
ner engagements are scheduled for
Friday. Two more open houses will
be held Wednesday and Thursday of
next. week. -
"Many houses put name tags on all
their members to help simplify the
name problem," said Jeff Howe, In
terfraternity President. "This is an
excellent idea that, could well be
adopted by every house on the
Row."
For the rushees, Howe suggested
that they attempt to visit as many
houses as they can tonight. It's very
easy to spend too much time in one
place, he added, but it's to every
rushee's advantage to become ac
quainted with as many fraternities
as possible.
Howe emphasized that all first
quarter freshman and transfers with
less than 90 units may go to Open
Houses but can not. accept luncheon
or dinner bids nor can they be rush
ed. Any first quarter man being
rushed should advise the fraternity
of his status to avoid possible infrac
tions of rushing rules.
There seemed to be little difficulty
in locating various houses, Howe
said, except that, some visitors mis
took the Post Office for the Mayfield
Road triangle and became hope
lessly confused.
