# Council Requests Proper Parking
## 
### 
There still seems to be some
doubt in the minds of student cat
owners as to where they can and
cannot park. The areas restricted
to faculty use are marked. By
watching for street and parking
lot signs, it is easy to keep out of
reserved arqas-
The street signs marked "Re
served Parking"' mean that the
curbs which they mark are re
served for members of the Aca
demic Council only. The parking
lot behind the Education Building
and the Geology parking lot are
both reserved for faculty durinu
the day. Unless your car has a
black faculty sticker, do not park
in these areas.
Men's Council appreciates the
co-operation which the student
body has given the Council by
observing the campus traffie reg
ulations.
