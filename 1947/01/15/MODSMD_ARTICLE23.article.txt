Dr. Tresidder in his speech at yesterday's
assembly said that we must participate in stu
dent government or we may regret it, that if
we cannot support the student responsibility
wo have accepted, responsible persons will
have to take over. He said further that student
government is something that has to be con
stantly guarded and refreshed not something
that when once set up will work itself out.
In looking at student government and
activities right now, we see too few
evidences of "togetherness" in their aims.
One of their main difficulties is that they
a:e trying to function with little participa
tion and interest on the part of the majority of
students. And many of the students who con
sider themselves members of an activity or
group are not doing anything to help the
group in what it is aiming to do A few do all
I lie work. It's much easier to let the "eager"
ones "knock themselves out" in the hope that
they can make our life cit Stanford a much
fuller and more pleasant one than it otherwjse
would be. Furthermore, we seem to think we
have a right to criticize those "eager" ones
when they get themselves in a jam or fail to
do what we think is best. Stanford students
foci they are entitled to the rights of student
government although they make no effort to
do their duty for that government; it is little
wonder that student government is in a shaky
position. When we cannot handle student af
fairs any better than we are now doing (for
example our running of elections) it is only
right that it be taken out of our hands.
The campus is strewn with groups or clubs
of one kind or another, each group having
some specific purpose for its existence, and
each crying for membership and interest from
the mass of unconcerned students. For the
most part, the groups care nothing about each
other, they seldom v/ork together for anything
that would benefit all the students; yet they

consider themselves an important part of
campus life. Many organizations have the
same or similar aims- yet they are not co-or
dinated in presenting these aims to the student
body. For an example, a of groups
have as an aim further education and under
standing of international problems and possi
ble solutions, but because they haven't work
ed together, thereby diawing in greater num
bers of interested persons, they have as yet
accomplished little.
A third reason why student government is
going to pot and one that is closely tied up
with the preceding one is the "difficulty of
communication" as Dr. Tresidder said, be
tween the administration and faculty on one
hand and the students on the other. Neither
party understands the other's point of view;
conseguently in the process of slitting the
other's throat both factions forget "that they
have interests that are inseparable" as he ex
pressed it. The administration faculty, and
students are here for the education of the stu
dents. At present there is no machinery set
up so that students can get together with the
faculty and administration and discuss the
issues that are bothering them. The adminis
tration can only guess what the majority of
students want accomplished at Stanford and
most students have never talked to any of the
officials that are running the school; if they
did, they would learn that these officials have
"a lot on the ball" and a lot of experience be
hind them or they wouldn't be holding down
those positions.
It is up to all the campus organizations and
leaders, the students themselves, and the ad
ministration to alleviate the existing condi
tions of our diseased government if it is to
remain. No one party can do it. As Eric Sev
ereid wrote in his recent book, "Not So Wild
a Dream," "Intellectuals go through a phase
when the 'team spirit' is a joke. Later I saw
it win a war for my country."—N.B.

have as an aim further education and under
standing of international problems and possi
ble solutions, but because they haven't work
ed together, thereby diawing in greater num
bers of interested persons, they have as yet
accomplished little.
A third reason why student government is
going to pot and one that is closely tied up
with the preceding one is the "difficulty of
communication" as Dr. Tresidder said, be
tween the administration and faculty on one
hand and the students on the other. Neither
party understands the other's point of view;
conseguently in the process of slitting the
other's throat both factions forget "that they
have interests that are inseparable" as he ex
pressed it. The administration faculty, and
students are here for the education of the stu
dents. At present there is no machinery set
up so that students can get together with the
faculty and administration and discuss the
issues that are bothering them. The adminis
tration can only guess what the majority of
students want accomplished at Stanford and
most students have never talked to any of the
officials that are running the school; if they
did, they would learn that these officials have
"a lot on the ball" and a lot of experience be
hind them or they wouldn't be holding down
those positions.
It is up to all the campus organizations and
leaders, the students themselves, and the ad
ministration to alleviate the existing condi
tions of our diseased government if it is to
remain. No one party can do it. As Eric Sev
ereid wrote in his recent book, "Not So Wild
a Dream," "Intellectuals go through a phase
when the 'team spirit' is a joke. Later I saw
it win a war for my country."—N.B.
Dr. Tresidder in his speech at yesterday's
assembly said that we must participate in stu
dent government or we may regret it, that if
we cannot support the student responsibility
wo have accepted, responsible persons will
have to take over. He said further that student
government is something that has to be con
stantly guarded and refreshed not something
that when once set up will work itself out.
In looking at student government and
activities right now, we see too few
evidences of "togetherness" in their aims.
One of their main difficulties is that they
a:e trying to function with little participa
tion and interest on the part of the majority of
students. And many of the students who con
sider themselves members of an activity or
group are not doing anything to help the
group in what it is aiming to do A few do all
I lie work. It's much easier to let the "eager"
ones "knock themselves out" in the hope that
they can make our life cit Stanford a much
fuller and more pleasant one than it otherwjse
would be. Furthermore, we seem to think we
have a right to criticize those "eager" ones
when they get themselves in a jam or fail to
do what we think is best. Stanford students
foci they are entitled to the rights of student
government although they make no effort to
do their duty for that government; it is little
wonder that student government is in a shaky
position. When we cannot handle student af
fairs any better than we are now doing (for
example our running of elections) it is only
right that it be taken out of our hands.
The campus is strewn with groups or clubs
of one kind or another, each group having
some specific purpose for its existence, and
each crying for membership and interest from
the mass of unconcerned students. For the
most part, the groups care nothing about each
other, they seldom v/ork together for anything
that would benefit all the students; yet they

consider themselves an important part of
campus life. Many organizations have the
same or similar aims- yet they are not co-or
dinated in presenting these aims to the student
body. For an example, a of groups
have as an aim further education and under
standing of international problems and possi
ble solutions, but because they haven't work
ed together, thereby diawing in greater num
