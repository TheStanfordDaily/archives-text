# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
By William Rehnquist and George Caulfield
I was lying in my warm, comfortable Stan
ford Village four poster this a.m.—an entirely
normal procedure considering that I only
register for three o'clock classes, and few of
those—when a vague acquaintance entered.
The revolving door which highlights our cas
ual furniture arrangement caught him una
wares and he was still spinning as he ap
proached.
He leaped on top of my bed, a procedure
which I consider highly unorthodox, and said,
"WHY NOT STUDY IN MEXICO?"
In typical American fashion I answered his
question with a question. "Huh?" I said.
"Didn't you read last Friday's Daily?" he
quizzed. "There it was in big, bold letters—
midway between a luscious display of some
boudoir garb entitled the "Paula Dido" night
shirt, and the crispy, crunchy meanderings of
Daniel Endsley---Why not study in Mexico?
Sounds like about the most intelligent ques
tion to come to light since 1945 when one
atom turned to another atom at Hiroshima and
said 'what the hell are we fighting for?' "
I nodded in tacit agreement.
"Everyone's going there this summer. Break
bread with the peons, that's the motto. Big
gest mass movement.of intellectuals since the
natives left Bikini."
I emitted a chortle. Very low, extremely

short, and rather meek, but nevertheless a
real chortle.
"Don't worry about finances," he continued.
"GI Bill covers everything. Maybe even an
extra peso or two thrown in for patio to patio
And you can always earn tamale money
by selling hot dogs for Jorge Pasquel."
"But the registration lines at the school
down there must reach from Tiajuana to Tam
pico," I commented.
"No such thing as registration lines. In fact
no such thing as registration. Everything is
run on the honor system. Afternoon classes
are overshadowed by siesta time. Gay, frivo
lous evenings at Senor Rossatti's Tequilla
Tavern."
I thumbed through my Spanish hip pocket
dictionary in anxious anticipation.
"And when we return we can write of our
adventures. Combine these and we have a
potential seller. Something like a dull 'Ra
zor's Edge'."
With these words he rolled off my bed and
simultaneously sneaked a hot enchilada from
his coat pocket and thrust it into his mouth.
Yelling "Hi Ho Montezuma" at the top of his
lungs he disappeared down the fire escape.
I returned to my slumber with thoughts of
a pleasant summer in Latin America running
rampant in my mind.
"Anyone know where I can pick up a cou
ple of hot Mexico City phone numbers?"
