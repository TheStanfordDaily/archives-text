To the Editor:
The quarterly question: When are modern lights
to he installed in the library? The eyes of Stanford
students have taken a healing for generations. When
is the Administration going to take action?
Every quarter there is an editorial in the Daily
demanding action, and there are a lot of promises,

but no action. If the Administration refuses to make
such a small expenditure for the physical well
being of its students, why don't the students take
up a collection or give a benefit dance to finance an
up-to-date lighting system? We've been waiting a
long time, and we're still waiting!
Sincerely,
Jack Capito
