# Purdue Men Face 4.66 Ratio; Women May Sleep in Ditches

### PAULA NUSSER 
(This is (he second in a series
of articles on the problems facing
other universities throughout the
country in comparison with those
of Stanford.â€”Ed.)
Last semester when the Dean of
Women at Purdue was asked
where she was going to iind room
for all the women at the Univer
sity, she replied, "Well, I've been
looking at (lie ditches."
STANFORD HOLDS EDGE
Stanford, which as yet has not
been reduced to inspecting the local
ditches, has a definite edge over
Purdue in the solution of its hous
ing problem. Nothing comparable
to our Village will be set up at Pur
due until September, 1947. clue to
the scarcity of building material and
labor.
Housing for women appears to
have received more publicity on
the Indiana campus than the men's
problem. One unit of Cary Hall,
the largest living group for men
students, was turned over to the
homeless women. Stanford men
who growled when Brainier was
again turnd back to the women
could have found a thousand In
diana males beating the same
drum
DOUBLING UP
All single rooms in the residence
halls for women have been turned
to doubles; the doubles to triples.
Could you imagine Roble or La
gunita girls calling one bed and one
locker inclusively home? At Pur
due bunks line both walls of the
two women's recreation rooms.
These girls have a bed and a lock
er; otherwise they live out of a
suitcase. Lamps, dressers, or desks
remain for the future. A permanent
structure for 600 women students
will be completed in September.
Purdue's top enrollment of 12,-
000 last quarter necessitated an
appeal from all the university's
officials to the townspeople of
West Lafayette, Intl., to accommo
date 3,000 students. Five thousand
otherwise eligible students- were
denied entrance to the university
because of overcrowded condi
tions.

Unlike Stanford, which has
made a policy of accepting appli
cants from all over the country
in proportion to the California
students, Purdue lias given pref
erence to Indiana residents. Only
12 per cent of the student body
are out-of-state students.
ENROLL AT HOME
Arrangements have been made to
enroll some 1,000 freshmen at 15
different centers over the state on
a "stay at home" basis. Other uni
versities handle their instruction.
Stanford roughs who complain
of a 2.1-1 ratio should be con
fronted with Purdue's of 4.(>(>-l.
To solve the date problem, this
campus too has established a date'
bureau that would rival Bran
ner's. On the policy of "no em
barrassing forms to (ill out," the
only kind of dates it will handle
are coke dales,
VETS I EEL UNFRIENDLINESS
Through the Exponent, Purdue's
daily newspaper, the problem of ad
'usting the veteran to campus life
has been given careful scrutiny
through the editorial columns.
The paper complained that at
events especially scheduled for the
vets, such as a vet-coed dance and
a meeting of Purdue's veteran or
ganization, participation was lack
ing. The vets, on the other hand,
complain that there was an "air of
unfriendliness" on the campus.
The Indiana campus recently
hit (he wires of United Press with
their local barber boycott. Cam
paigning against $1 haircuts, the
men students let their curls grow
under (he slogan "For a buck a
throw let them grow." A Samson
Club was organized which held a
contest for the ten longest heads
of hair.
MANY TRADITIONS
Purdue like Stanford is a school
strong on traditions. While Stan
ford supposedly "hellos" strangers
on Quad, Purdue uses its greeting
on "hello walk." Like their West
ern brother, Purdue's no-smoking
on-campus policy has fallen into dis
card in recent years.
"Green pots" (caps) arc worn

by the frosh on St. Patrick's Day.
II the sophomores succeed in pre
venting the frosh from burning
their pots, the freshman men are
supposed to wear their headgear
until June. Life under a "pot"
for three months can have its dis
advantages.
HAS MUSIC lIALL
In spile of bad housing condi
tions, Purdue does have two cam
pus buildings of which it can be
proud. Their Music Ilall is just a
little smaller than the Music Hall
in Radio City, New York. Their
new union has two ballrooms that
can be thrown together into one
with five separate places serving
food.
But ask a Purdue student if he'd
rather have a place to dance or to
sleep. He'll take the latter.
