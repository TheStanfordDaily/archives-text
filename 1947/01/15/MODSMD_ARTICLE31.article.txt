## CARD STUNTS 
### 
liuying Skis Aiifl Enough—They
Should Pay Their Own Way In

During (his time of the year skiing will invariably draw bigger crowds
of participants and enthusiasts on campus than any other minor sport. As
in pre-war days, Stanford's Ski Club is the largest organization on the
Farm next to the ASSU; at present there are about 750 registered students
who are members of the club, and there are more waiting to join up just
as soon as more membership cards are available.
In addition there is an official Stanford ski team consisting of the six
lop Indian boardmen who travel to most major ski races and who have,
incidentally, made a very- good name for Stanford among ski circles on
the Pacific Coast and in the Rockies. This team is recognized by the
school and the athletic department as a regular minor sport squad and
members are awarded a Circle S letter for participation.
Now here comes a twist. Ever since this team and the club have existed
at Stanford side by side the entire team finances, including long travels to
snc'w country and accommodations at races, have been covered by club
money. Membership fees of an organization that is partly social have paid
for the expenses of a purely athletic team.
Within a few days several members of Stanford's present team will
come to Excom and ask that the ASSU and the SAC share in sending the
Cardinal colors to intercollegiate competition in the Western United
Stales. It seems fair to say that their request of the student body is
reasonable.
They lloth Co to the Snow, But—
In the first place it doesn't seem right to have any Farm team dependent
on financial support from a club. Neither does it seem fair to expect club
members to back up the Stanford ski team which after all has no more
in common with the club than that both l'ullfil their purpose in the same
climatic conditions. The team represents the University and its students,
not the members of the Ski Club.
Furthermore the Farm team is one of the glaring exceptions among the
major colleges on the Pacific Coast and in the Rockies. Several of the
northern PCC universities consider skiing a major sport, but even the
rest who place skiing on a minor status have not failed to give their team
student body backing in covering expenses. To my knowledge the condi
tion of a club supporting the ski team exists at no other university.
During the recent ski championships at Sun Valley Stanford's team
placed third among quite a number of colleges who run skiing as a major
sport. What the team members ask of Excom will enable them to continue
representing this school in intercollegiate competition without financial
dependence on the Ski Club. This type of an arrangement would definitely
be an improvement for the students and the team, and Excom will, I hope,
.nive the plan its most serious consideration.

• Stanford's Fred Taioli, who hails from Stockton and is one of swim
coach Tom Haynie's bright hopes for the Indian team, has been putting on
a wonderful showing at the Australian championships in Sydney. Among
other records Fred set a new Australian 440-yard free-style mark when
he swam the distance in 5:02.3 to win the race by a full 12 yards.

Something's Rotten in Denmark
Running my eyes over the sport sheets of a few other college dailies I
find a facetious slur on the Indians' basketball chances reeking from the
pages of—yep, you smelled it—the Daily California!!. Sports Editor Lazarus
gloats that "it may sound silly but the southern division basketball crown
will be a battle among the Bears, Trojans and Bruins.
"Surely, that takes in three-quarters of the participating teams but you
wouldn't get any different an answer from anyone that follows the cage
sport closely. In other words, it's going to he a terrific year. Stanford
will end the campaign in the cellar for the second straight time. . . ."
This sounds more like the press notices with which the Uclans covered
themselves prior to last week-end, and for which they were forced to make
excuses. I am not predicting any big triumphs for this week-end—though
one Card win is entirely possible—but I do feel the Berkeley barker should
watch that over-confidence. The remaining "one-quarter" of the PCC
division will yet be heard from.

Not to be outdone, the University of Kansas' Daily runs an interesting
little item on their sports' page:
Leonard Z. Plehank, Chicago inventor, claims he has invented a "door
less door." He said every home should have at least one of them.
"It really is quite simple." Mr. Plehank said. "First you cut a hole for
a doorway, and then substitute a wall of air blasts for the door."
He said air currents would keep insects and dirt out of the house and
keep (he heat in. "There's only one difficulty," he said. "You get all
mussed up walking through the door."
I just wonder what that item is doing on the sporjs' page when it quite
obviously belongs in the financial section. There must be big money in
such inventions.

come to Excom and ask that the ASSU and the SAC share in sending the
Cardinal colors to intercollegiate competition in the Western United
Stales. It seems fair to say that their request of the student body is
reasonable.
They lloth Co to the Snow, But—
In the first place it doesn't seem right to have any Farm team dependent
on financial support from a club. Neither does it seem fair to expect club
members to back up the Stanford ski team which after all has no more
in common with the club than that both l'ullfil their purpose in the same
climatic conditions. The team represents the University and its students,
not the members of the Ski Club.
Furthermore the Farm team is one of the glaring exceptions among the
major colleges on the Pacific Coast and in the Rockies. Several of the
northern PCC universities consider skiing a major sport, but even the
rest who place skiing on a minor status have not failed to give their team
student body backing in covering expenses. To my knowledge the condi
tion of a club supporting the ski team exists at no other university.
During the recent ski championships at Sun Valley Stanford's team
placed third among quite a number of colleges who run skiing as a major
sport. What the team members ask of Excom will enable them to continue
representing this school in intercollegiate competition without financial
dependence on the Ski Club. This type of an arrangement would definitely
be an improvement for the students and the team, and Excom will, I hope,
.nive the plan its most serious consideration.

Something's Rotten in Denmark
Running my eyes over the sport sheets of a few other college dailies I
find a facetious slur on the Indians' basketball chances reeking from the
pages of—yep, you smelled it—the Daily California!!. Sports Editor Lazarus
gloats that "it may sound silly but the southern division basketball crown
will be a battle among the Bears, Trojans and Bruins.
"Surely, that takes in three-quarters of the participating teams but you
wouldn't get any different an answer from anyone that follows the cage
sport closely. In other words, it's going to he a terrific year. Stanford
will end the campaign in the cellar for the second straight time. . . ."
This sounds more like the press notices with which the Uclans covered
themselves prior to last week-end, and for which they were forced to make
excuses. I am not predicting any big triumphs for this week-end—though
one Card win is entirely possible—but I do feel the Berkeley barker should
watch that over-confidence. The remaining "one-quarter" of the PCC
division will yet be heard from.

lleware of This Door, Girls!
Not to be outdone, the University of Kansas' Daily runs an interesting
little item on their sports' page:
Leonard Z. Plehank, Chicago inventor, claims he has invented a "door
less door." He said every home should have at least one of them.
"It really is quite simple." Mr. Plehank said. "First you cut a hole for
a doorway, and then substitute a wall of air blasts for the door."
He said air currents would keep insects and dirt out of the house and
keep (he heat in. "There's only one difficulty," he said. "You get all
mussed up walking through the door."
I just wonder what that item is doing on the sporjs' page when it quite
obviously belongs in the financial section. There must be big money in
such inventions.
liuying Skis Aiifl Enough—They
Should Pay Their Own Way In

During (his time of the year skiing will invariably draw bigger crowds
of participants and enthusiasts on campus than any other minor sport. As
in pre-war days, Stanford's Ski Club is the largest organization on the
Farm next to the ASSU; at present there are about 750 registered students
who are members of the club, and there are more waiting to join up just
as soon as more membership cards are available.
In addition there is an official Stanford ski team consisting of the six
lop Indian boardmen who travel to most major ski races and who have,
incidentally, made a very- good name for Stanford among ski circles on
the Pacific Coast and in the Rockies. This team is recognized by the
school and the athletic department as a regular minor sport squad and
members are awarded a Circle S letter for participation.
Now here comes a twist. Ever since this team and the club have existed
at Stanford side by side the entire team finances, including long travels to
snc'w country and accommodations at races, have been covered by club
money. Membership fees of an organization that is partly social have paid
for the expenses of a purely athletic team.

sport. What the team members ask of Excom will enable them to continue
representing this school in intercollegiate competition without financial
dependence on the Ski Club. This type of an arrangement would definitely
be an improvement for the students and the team, and Excom will, I hope,
.nive the plan its most serious consideration.

• Stanford's Fred Taioli, who hails from Stockton and is one of swim
coach Tom Haynie's bright hopes for the Indian team, has been putting on
a wonderful showing at the Australian championships in Sydney. Among
other records Fred set a new Australian 440-yard free-style mark when
he swam the distance in 5:02.3 to win the race by a full 12 yards.

Something's Rotten in Denmark
Running my eyes over the sport sheets of a few other college dailies I
find a facetious slur on the Indians' basketball chances reeking from the
pages of—yep, you smelled it—the Daily California!!. Sports Editor Lazarus
gloats that "it may sound silly but the southern division basketball crown
will be a battle among the Bears, Trojans and Bruins.
"Surely, that takes in three-quarters of the participating teams but you
wouldn't get any different an answer from anyone that follows the cage
sport closely. In other words, it's going to he a terrific year. Stanford
will end the campaign in the cellar for the second straight time. . . ."
This sounds more like the press notices with which the Uclans covered
themselves prior to last week-end, and for which they were forced to make
excuses. I am not predicting any big triumphs for this week-end—though
one Card win is entirely possible—but I do feel the Berkeley barker should
watch that over-confidence. The remaining "one-quarter" of the PCC
division will yet be heard from.

lleware of This Door, Girls!
Not to be outdone, the University of Kansas' Daily runs an interesting
little item on their sports' page:
Leonard Z. Plehank, Chicago inventor, claims he has invented a "door
less door." He said every home should have at least one of them.
"It really is quite simple." Mr. Plehank said. "First you cut a hole for
a doorway, and then substitute a wall of air blasts for the door."
He said air currents would keep insects and dirt out of the house and
keep (he heat in. "There's only one difficulty," he said. "You get all
mussed up walking through the door."
I just wonder what that item is doing on the sporjs' page when it quite
obviously belongs in the financial section. There must be big money in
such inventions.
liuying Skis Aiifl Enough—They
Should Pay Their Own Way In

During (his time of the year skiing will invariably draw bigger crowds
of participants and enthusiasts on campus than any other minor sport. As
in pre-war days, Stanford's Ski Club is the largest organization on the
Farm next to the ASSU; at present there are about 750 registered students
who are members of the club, and there are more waiting to join up just
as soon as more membership cards are available.
In addition there is an official Stanford ski team consisting of the six
lop Indian boardmen who travel to most major ski races and who have,
incidentally, made a very- good name for Stanford among ski circles on
the Pacific Coast and in the Rockies. This team is recognized by the
school and the athletic department as a regular minor sport squad and
members are awarded a Circle S letter for participation.
Now here comes a twist. Ever since this team and the club have existed
at Stanford side by side the entire team finances, including long travels to
snc'w country and accommodations at races, have been covered by club
money. Membership fees of an organization that is partly social have paid
for the expenses of a purely athletic team.
Within a few days several members of Stanford's present team will
come to Excom and ask that the ASSU and the SAC share in sending the
Cardinal colors to intercollegiate competition in the Western United
Stales. It seems fair to say that their request of the student body is
reasonable.
They lloth Co to the Snow, But—
In the first place it doesn't seem right to have any Farm team dependent
on financial support from a club. Neither does it seem fair to expect club
members to back up the Stanford ski team which after all has no more
in common with the club than that both l'ullfil their purpose in the same
climatic conditions. The team represents the University and its students,
not the members of the Ski Club.
Furthermore the Farm team is one of the glaring exceptions among the
major colleges on the Pacific Coast and in the Rockies. Several of the
northern PCC universities consider skiing a major sport, but even the
rest who place skiing on a minor status have not failed to give their team
student body backing in covering expenses. To my knowledge the condi
tion of a club supporting the ski team exists at no other university.
