# Notre Dame to Join Reform Movement
## 
### 
SOUTH BEND. Ind., Jan. 14 (UP).
—Notre Dame will co-operate in any
efforts to legitimately "reform" in
tercollegiate sports, the Rev. John J.
Cavanaugh, president, promised to
night. but he hinted that Notre Dame
would not lead in any move toward
de-emphasis of football.
At the same time he pleaded indi
rectly for continuation of grid rela
tionships with Notre Dame. This
was interpreted as an answer to re
ports that various schools were
dropping the Irish from their grid
schedule because they were "too
tough."
Father Cavanaugh spoke at the
annual Notre Dame football banquet,
and although he had been expected
to comment at length on the recent
rupture of Notre Dame-Army grid
relations, he dismissed this subject
with a single sentence—the danger
of gamblers "getting to" the players
of either team had nothing to do
with the break. <3
Without identifying any individ
ual, Father Cavanaugh lashed at
"reformers . . . who play with the
question of football for public con
sumption, who seem to say that an
indefinable something has to be
done in athletics in a way nobody
knows how, at a time nobody knows
when, in a place nobody knows
where, to accomplish nobody knows
what."
