# Mural Games Cut By Tong Rushing
## 
### 
Last night's renewal of Fraternity
i Rushing threw a monkey wrench
into the second edition of the Intra
mural Basketball Schedule, with
! three games involving Tong men
j cancelled. The postponed contests
\ will be inserted into the schedule
i later in the season, possibly after the
i regular schedule has been com
! pleted.
Meanwhile, on another part of the
Intramural scene, plans for a Cam-
I pus Handball League have been
! junked by the Intramural Council.
Only six teams expressed a desire to
| participate in such a league. Such
a lack of interest led the Council to
the drastic action of cutting the
sport from the Intramurals. Any of
{he teams who have signed up may
! carry on their own competition at
i the Gymnasium courts.
