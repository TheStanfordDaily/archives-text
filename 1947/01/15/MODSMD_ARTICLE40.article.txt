# Stanford Out to Upset Golden Bears; Weekend Slate Tickets at a Premium
## 
### ART SHAPIRO 
H hour came at 10:110 yesterday morning. The 2,600 tickets on sale for
the two Cal-Stanford basketball games this weekend disappeared from
the racks at that time to the accompaniment of agonized groans and some
of the more serious sort of complaining. It was touch and go for the
thousand or so students who marched on the Pavilion with student body
cards and a dollar or fifty cents jingling in their jeans. Befoiie two hours

had elapsed the number of tickets
had dwindled down to a ridiculous- j
ly low figure and the crush was on. |
It had all ended by 11. The
crowds were gone, but feeling
continued to mount up (hrough
(lie day that something radically
was wrong, and i( wasn't neces
sarily in Denmark.
For those lucky enough to have
missed breakfast, and not the tick
et sale, the following information [
may prove of interest: The game at
Cal will begin at 8:30 and will be
preceded by the B squad contest
with the Cal Blues. The game here
on Saturday will start at 8, also fol
lowing B squad clashes.
CAL LEADS PCC
The Blue and Gold, which is at
present leading the conference with
two victories against nary a defeat,
certainly appears to be a man-sized
problem to be tackled by the Li']
Injins of Stanford .
Sparked by All-American Andy
Wolfe and led by the conference

high scorer. Chuck Hanger, the
Bears made mincemeat of a
strong Trojan five in a rather
convincing manner last weekend,
4U-.'»S and 53-47. The remainder
of the Cal squad includes Jack
Rocker at forward and Fred I)ur
kee and Boh Hogchoom at (he
two guard slots.
EXCELLENT RESERVES
Three extremely fine substitutes
are to be found on the Cal roster in
the persons of Jim Smith, last year's
first-string center; George Walker,
colored holdover from last year's
squad, plus Johnson, another tiger
on the defensive at the guard po
sition.
Stanford's major claim to fame
has been the fine defensive forma
tions that the Cardinals have been
able to throw up against the teams
th<?y have faced this season. It will
be a test of a high-pressure, offen
sively minded quintet pitted against
a strictly defensive aggregation,
with winner take all.

lowing B squad clashes.
CAL LEADS PCC
The Blue and Gold, which is at
present leading the conference with
two victories against nary a defeat,
certainly appears to be a man-sized
problem to be tackled by the Li']
Injins of Stanford .
Sparked by All-American Andy
Wolfe and led by the conference

high scorer. Chuck Hanger, the
Bears made mincemeat of a
strong Trojan five in a rather
convincing manner last weekend,
4U-.'»S and 53-47. The remainder
of the Cal squad includes Jack
Rocker at forward and Fred I)ur
kee and Boh Hogchoom at (he
two guard slots.
EXCELLENT RESERVES
Three extremely fine substitutes
are to be found on the Cal roster in
the persons of Jim Smith, last year's
first-string center; George Walker,
colored holdover from last year's
squad, plus Johnson, another tiger
on the defensive at the guard po
sition.
Stanford's major claim to fame
has been the fine defensive forma
tions that the Cardinals have been
able to throw up against the teams
th<?y have faced this season. It will
be a test of a high-pressure, offen
sively minded quintet pitted against
a strictly defensive aggregation,
with winner take all.
H hour came at 10:110 yesterday morning. The 2,600 tickets on sale for
the two Cal-Stanford basketball games this weekend disappeared from
the racks at that time to the accompaniment of agonized groans and some
of the more serious sort of complaining. It was touch and go for the
thousand or so students who marched on the Pavilion with student body
cards and a dollar or fifty cents jingling in their jeans. Befoiie two hours

had elapsed the number of tickets
had dwindled down to a ridiculous- j
ly low figure and the crush was on. |
It had all ended by 11. The
crowds were gone, but feeling
continued to mount up (hrough
(lie day that something radically
was wrong, and i( wasn't neces
sarily in Denmark.
For those lucky enough to have
missed breakfast, and not the tick
et sale, the following information [
may prove of interest: The game at
Cal will begin at 8:30 and will be
preceded by the B squad contest
with the Cal Blues. The game here
on Saturday will start at 8, also fol
