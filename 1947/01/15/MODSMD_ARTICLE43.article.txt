### BOB PANNELL 
Staging a story-book finish, Men
lo J.C. came from 10 points behind,
at one point early in the second
half, to overcome the Card "B"
squad, 38-3ti. Alter the tying bas
ket had been caged by Van Alstyne
with 30 seconds left. Rose, the stel
lar center of the visitors, cut down
all alone under the Stanford basket,
took a looping pass, and sank the
winning goal with less than 10 sec
onds remaining.
The first half had ended with the
Red team ahead, 22-8. Up to that
point the vaunted Menlo attack had
given their supporters little to cheer
about, their whole game being

S lethargic and spiritless. Menlo coach
Roy Hughes' charges came back af
ter the intermission and, led by a
fighting sub, Durnal, electrified the
Pavilion onlookers by slowly whit
tling away at the Indian lead. Al
| though outshone in form by the
more polished first-stringers on the
Menlo team, Durnal time and again
took the ball away from the con
tused Stanfordites. With 10 min
utes to go the score stood at 32-24.
Then Menlo's floor game, former
ly lacking speed, started to com
pletely outrun the Stanford defense,
and on numerous occasions got be
hind it to score from close up.
