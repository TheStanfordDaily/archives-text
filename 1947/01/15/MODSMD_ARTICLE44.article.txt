## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 14 (UP).—
The U.S. Supreme Court closed out
a wrangling, four-hour oral hearing
in the case of the government versus
John L. Lewis tonight and adjourned
without word as to when it will hand
down its decision.
All indications were that it would
be three weeks or more before the
nine justices deliver their verdict on
the appeals filed by Lewis and his
United Mine Workers (AFL) against
the.'>, 510,000 fines levied upon them
for defying an anti-strike injunction
issued by the Federal District Court
last November.
Lewis' attorneys denounced the
court order as unconstitutional, the
contempt of court fines as harsh and
excessive, and the entire affair as an
example of "government by injunc
tion" at its worst.
Attorney Tom C. Clark and As
sistant Attorney General John F.
Sonnctt countered angrily with the
charge that Lewis' defiance of the
Federal Court was "an insult to
the United States" and an invita
tion to "mob rule."
The black-robed justices them
selves intervened frequently in the
hammer-and-tongs debate, mostly
to question the union lawyers on
their interpretation of the Norris-

Laguardia Anti-Injunction Act and
| on their reasons for advising Lewis j
; to flout the lower court order.
The trend of their questioning in
\ dicated to courtroom observers that !
: the justices were giving considerable ;
| weight to the government's conten- j
| ti6n that Lewis should have obeyed j
I the. anti-strike order pending a ju-
I dicial ruling on its validity.
