### 
The fin;)l recommendation of the
War Memorial Committee will not
be made until all the answers to the
letters sent out to different univer
sities as to the war memorial they
arc planning are received, according
to P;itty Whittemore, chairman of
the Student Union Committee.
The letters which the War Memo
rial Committee sent out had asked
what memorial they had construct
ed, how much it cost, and what
financial revenue was coming in
from the project.
Many replies have already been
received and the remainder are ex
pected in the next two weeks. The
committee's recommendation for a
war memorial will go to Excom for
approval.
