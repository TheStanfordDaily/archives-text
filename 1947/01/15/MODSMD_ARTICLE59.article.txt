### 
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 14 (UP).- j
A Senate committee on health in
surance tonight recommended Cali
fornia set up a limited compulsory
health insurance system, but the
plan was immemdiately subjected to
a heated attack by a minority mem
ber of the committee.
After a year of study, the com
mittee by a vote of 3 to 2 would |
provide insurance only in cases of j
"catastrophic illness" and would j
pay benefits where "the duration of !
ihe illness is long or the cost of
treatment great." The Legislature j
would be required to decide what a !
"catastrophic illness" is.
