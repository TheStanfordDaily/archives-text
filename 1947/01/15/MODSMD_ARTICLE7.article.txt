# Self Government Up To Students---Tresidder
## I.S.C. Head Reports on Survey Aims; Anderson Discusses Athletic Issue 
### 
Student government is not an inalienable right, but a prize which must
be won again and again by student effort, was the keynote of an address
by Stanford President Donald B. Tresidder at the all-University assembly
yesterday.
Stanford students must show interest and participate in order to keep

* their self-government, he said, in
i a speech which dealt with the his
j tory and nature of student govern-
I ment at Stanford.
Dr. Tresidder said that in his
few years as University President
panization wobble and waver at
times, rise, and sometimes near a
breakdown. lie gave his talk, he
said, in hope that it would in
crease understanding between
"we and they"â€”"we" being the
students and "they" the adminis
tration.
He emphasized that the care of
J the welfare of the students at the
j University is an inherent right of
| the faculty and trustees. Around
j 1910 they hit upon the idea of dele
gating some of the control and re
j sponsibility for student activities to
i the students themselves in hope
; they would benefit from such expe
i rience.
Things which most hinder the
A.S.S.U. president in his work,
Dr. Tresidder pointed out, arc
apathy on the part of many stu
dents and the attitude which
' takes root in many minds imme
diately after his election that the
student head is a "tool of the Ad
ministration."
The University President lashed
| out at rumor-mongering and the
| spread of misinformation and at
j criticism of student government
| without participation in its efforts.
Farlier in tin 1 program Niel Al
len, head of Stanford's Interna -
I tional Survey Committee, said the
long-range purpose of the pro
; posed survey of foreign countries
by Farm students is to combat the
ignorance and indifference con
' ccrning elVorts toward permanent
! peace.
Following Allen's talk, A.S.S.U.
I President Martin Anderson pointed
! out to his audience that "It's your
> job now to make it succeed."
| Anderson reported in a brief
J speech that the Student Union Com
; inittee formed last quartet; found a
i favorable reaction to the proposal
j for building a new student union in
| a sampling of campus opinion. The
i big problem now, he said, is financ
| ing it. He added that chances are
j good for the Union being taken up as
| a war memorial project.
Anderson also reported that he
had talked to the University Pres
ident. vice-president, administra
tive officers, students and coaches
i on the question of entrance rc
| quirements for athletes. He said
he found that Stanford officials
take into account an applicant's
potential contribution to the Uni
; versify not just scholastic ability.
He said the question was whether
there was enough emphasis on
! athletics as an asset.
