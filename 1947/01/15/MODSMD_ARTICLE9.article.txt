# Brandt Gives Russ Solution
## 
### 
Dr. Karl Brandt, Stanford food
economist, last night called for a
restoration of international law and
order in Germany, with no exemp
tions for the victorious Allies, as the
only hope for ending our quarrel
with Russia in Germany.
Speaking before a Tuesday Eve
ning Series audience in Memorial
Hall auditorium, Dr. Brandt offered
12 points for a foreign policy to
ward Russia which would solve the
problem, "How to End Our Quarrel
with Russia in Germany."
The professor of agricultural
economics in the Food Research
Institute included these require
ments in his 12-point program:
We must take an objectively
critical viewpoint in our attitude
toward Russia, avoiding both the
whitewash and the tar and feath
er tratmcnt of Soviet relations.
We must abandon fear of an
other war; we must learn to live
with conflict in foreign relations;
and we must forego appeasement.
We have no choice but to build
up the strongest possible bargain
ing position in international af
fairs so that we can make it a
paying proposition for the So
viets to come to agreements and
terms with lis.
If our policy in Germany shall
succeed we must forget such lu
natic Frankenstein plans as Mr.
Moi gent hau's dc-industrialization
scheme, and prime the pump in
Germany with food so that the
people may survive.
If the Russians come forth with
a unification plan for Germany we
should accept but not fall for any
attempt to move a Soviet Trojan
horse into the Western /.ones.
We must maintain a competent
check on Russia's military prepa
ration, disarming in equality with
other nations but keeping our de
fenses in prime shape.
Born and educated in Germany,
for four years a professor in the
College of Agriculture of the Uni
versity of Berlin, Dr. Brandt showed
an understandable depth of feeling
for the plight of the German peo
ple.
During the 20-minute question
period he warned that the success
of the denazification of Germany
hinges on a solution of the eco
nomic paralysis, adding that re
nazification may set in unless the
problem is solved.—Haight.
