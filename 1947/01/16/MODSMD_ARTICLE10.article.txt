### 
The bill of plays, "John Doc" by '
Bernard Dryer, and "My Heart's in |
the Highlands" by William Saroyan,
which opened last night at 8:15 in
the Little Theatre appealed jointly j
to the intelligence and the heart of j
its audience.
"John Doe" featured the trial of ;
the common man who has been i
blamed for the many punishments j
inflicted upon men in these times.
Harold Todd aptly showed the con- j
fused attitude of the common man i
and his indifference to the troubles '
of the world.
Karl von Leuwen gave a splendid
performance as Senor Petti, the
Italian who was persecuted by the j
Fascists, and who acted as prosecu- j
tor in the trial. Alfred Lees as Jesse
made his entrance very well, .but 1

was not as forceful the end.
Philip Laylander, a newcomer to the
Studio Theatre, was very good as
the priest.
Saroyan's play was the story of an
old man with his heart, in the high
lands, and was full of pathos and
comedy. They couldn't have hoped
for a better audience which laughed
at the right times and cried at others.
Jackie Sheehy, an eight-year-old
from Palo Alto, was very realistic
as Johnnie and one could see very
well his hopes and fears towards his
father's poetry. The scenes between
Sheehy and the grocer, Kosac, were
very realistic.
These two plays were very good,
considering they were given by an
amateur cast and arc well-worth
seeing if you can. —Keatley.
