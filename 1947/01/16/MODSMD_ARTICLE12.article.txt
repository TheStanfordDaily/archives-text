LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Jan. 15
(UP).—The United States asked the j
United Nations Security Council to- j
day to postpone disarmament talks j
until Feb. 4, but Russia balked.
American Delegate Warren Aus- !
tin proposed the delay to permit j
delegates to reach greater agree- I
rnent in informal talks, and to per
mit incoming U.S. Secretary of
State George C. Marshall to study
the issues before the United States
commits itself.
Soviet Delegate Andrei Gromyko
promptly and bluntly rejected the
move.
"I don't see the sense of postpon
ing consideration of disarmament
items," he snapped.
He said the Soviet -wanted dis
armament talks speeded, not de
layed.
The exchange further snarled the
Soviet-United States till over pro
cedure.
The United States has asked that
the U.N. Security Council give first I
consideration to the American pro
gram for international control of
atomic energy. The Soviet has cam
paigned relentlessly for its own
resolution for the Council to draw
up a general disarmament program
—including atomic weapons—with
in 90 days.
