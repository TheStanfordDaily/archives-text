### 
Lack of information and eo-ordi- i
nated activity hampered participa
tion of Stanford and other Western :
college delegates io the Youth Con- ■
ference in Chicago last month, ac- ;
cording to two of the delegates, Niel
Allen and Marilyn Sidwell.
Their chief purpose—getting a
clear picture of the proposed Na
tional Youth Organization and its j
supporters—was accomplished by
watching and listening. But the
failure of information on the Con
ference agenda to arrive from the ]
committee in charge left Stan
ford delegates uninformed on the
major proposals to be brought up
at (he meeting.
The lack of co-ordinated interest
and organized activity on the Stan- 5
ford campus prevented its delegates
from going to the Conference with
definite independent proposals of
their own.
According to Allen certain schools j
knew what was going <>n. The

Western representatives did not
have as much information before
hand. Schools that took stands in
panel committee meetings and in
plenary sessions had been informed.
Allen added that the Confer
ence committee, composed of the
American delegates to the Prague
conference last summer, brought
forth most proposals. They had a
solid plan. The University of
Texas, Harvard, and others also
had prepared complete plans for
organization of the national group,
lie commented that Stanford had
not been permitted to send an ob
server last summer to the Prague
conference and had not been in
vited to send delegates.
Stanford's delegates, Miss Sid
well. Allen. Bill Slocum and Ob
server Nancy Alden, attended panel
committee meetings where they
voted on separate issues having to
do with the organization, aims, and
principles of the NSO. About a

hundred members were on each
panel committee, which carried out
duties similar to Congressional com
mittees.
In the plenary or committec
of-the-whole meetings agendas of
the four panels were to be
brought up. Hut the lirst panel—
discussion of the formation of the
National Continuations Commit
tee—took all of the first day's
session. It was decided, in order
to yet through necessary business
in time, that the oilier three panel
agendas be referred to the Exec
utive Committee of the NCC to
be presented at the Constitutional
Convention before Sept. IMI.
At the third plenary session the
most pressing and controversial
points discussed in the panel com
mittee meetings were brought up
in the form of motions.
Motion fifteen — that the pro
posed NSO go on record as favor
ing repeal of Southern state leg

islatioii prohibiting infer - racial
i meetings — was objected to by
; Southern college delegates. Thev
felt lhat_ stated in this form, i(
would he a block to acceptance of
j the whole plan by their schools.
Also it was feared that keeping it
in might involve the NSO in un
wanted political pressure activity.
The Conference left in a motion
favoring racial equality.
Stanford's delegates voted for
: the newly elected chairman of the
| National Continuations Committee,
| James Smilh of the University of
I Texas. Stanford was the only Pa
j cific Coast school to do this, Allen
j said. Elected to the vice-chairmnn
i ship was Russell Austin. Both were
| Prague delegates.

plenary sessions had been informed.
Allen added that the Confer
ence committee, composed of the
American delegates to the Prague
conference last summer, brought
forth most proposals. They had a
solid plan. The University of
Texas, Harvard, and others also
had prepared complete plans for
organization of the national group,
lie commented that Stanford had
not been permitted to send an ob
server last summer to the Prague
conference and had not been in
vited to send delegates.
Stanford's delegates, Miss Sid
well. Allen. Bill Slocum and Ob
server Nancy Alden, attended panel
committee meetings where they
voted on separate issues having to
do with the organization, aims, and
principles of the NSO. About a

hundred members were on each
panel committee, which carried out
duties similar to Congressional com
mittees.
In the plenary or committec
of-the-whole meetings agendas of
the four panels were to be
brought up. Hut the lirst panel—
discussion of the formation of the
National Continuations Commit
tee—took all of the first day's
session. It was decided, in order
to yet through necessary business
in time, that the oilier three panel
agendas be referred to the Exec
utive Committee of the NCC to
be presented at the Constitutional
Convention before Sept. IMI.
At the third plenary session the
most pressing and controversial
points discussed in the panel com
mittee meetings were brought up
in the form of motions.
Motion fifteen — that the pro
posed NSO go on record as favor
ing repeal of Southern state leg

islatioii prohibiting infer - racial
i meetings — was objected to by
; Southern college delegates. Thev
felt lhat_ stated in this form, i(
would he a block to acceptance of
j the whole plan by their schools.
Also it was feared that keeping it
in might involve the NSO in un
wanted political pressure activity.
The Conference left in a motion
favoring racial equality.
Stanford's delegates voted for

Lack of information and eo-ordi- i
nated activity hampered participa
tion of Stanford and other Western :
college delegates io the Youth Con- ■
ference in Chicago last month, ac- ;
cording to two of the delegates, Niel
Allen and Marilyn Sidwell.
Their chief purpose—getting a
clear picture of the proposed Na
tional Youth Organization and its j
supporters—was accomplished by
watching and listening. But the
failure of information on the Con
ference agenda to arrive from the ]
committee in charge left Stan
ford delegates uninformed on the
major proposals to be brought up
at (he meeting.
The lack of co-ordinated interest
and organized activity on the Stan- 5
ford campus prevented its delegates
from going to the Conference with
definite independent proposals of
their own.

knew what was going <>n. The

Western representatives did not
have as much information before
hand. Schools that took stands in
panel committee meetings and in
