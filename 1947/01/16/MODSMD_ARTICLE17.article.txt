## 
### BILL ANTHONY 
By-laws to the ASSU Constitution pertaining to elections
were boiled down to a minimum and a strong executive power
was placed in the hands of Election Board last night by Excom.
Approval was quick following Carl Burke's reading of the
changes proposed by him and H. D. Thoreau, members of

election committee. A proposed
change permitting campaign funds
was tabled until next week.
NKSS BOARD CHAIRMAN
Gordon Ness, a second - quarter
freshman living in the Village, was
appointed Election Board chairman.
Ness has been corresponding with
other leading universities on the
subject of student elections. Last
night he made an informal canvass
of the Row to further his research
on views toward improving voting
procedure.

A round-table discussion over
KSU tonight at 7. featuring Ness,
Doug Crawford of the Leadership
Institute Committee, and A.S.S.U.
Vice - President Millie Edwards,
will review pros and cons of the
campaign funds clause.
POWER OF DECISION
The new by-laws provide a skele
ton operational procedure for Elec
tion Board, which was granted pow
er to make all decisions not covered.
The Board will present its plan of
operation to Excom two weeks be
fore each election. The move is de
signed to eliminate the possibility
of inconsequential violations, one
of which could make an entire elec
tion illegal.
Major change in the by-laws
passed provides for a primary
election for all offices where the
preferential system previously ap
plied, provided more than four
candidates are nominated. In the
primary each voter shall vote for
only one candidate per office.
Those four candidates receiving
the highest number of votes for
each office shall he placed on the
final ballot, where there will he
preferential voting.

EXPENDITURES APPROVED

As proposed by Burke and Tho
reau, candidates for A.S.S.U. presi
dent and vice-president would be
allowed $15, candidates for Other
offices, $10. According to Thoreau
the figures mentioned are arbitrary;
however, they set a precedent. Pre
viously no expenditure for cam
paign purposes was permitted.
Ness requests that any sugges
tions regarding campaign funds be
addressed to him, care of the Daily.
He will report, his findings to Ex
com next week.

Recommendation that Stanford join the National Students Or
ganization was made to Excom last night by Niel Allen, head of

ber's Chicago student conference.

actual business conducted at Chi
cago, but did reveal that the confer
ence had been divided into four
panels:

tee, national organization, student
needs and responsibilities in interna
tional affairs, and aims of the na
tional organization.
Farm delegates felt that joining
the NSO will allow Stanford to
learn about other colleges' activities,
expand the ISC, and permit discus
sion of problems common to all stu
dents.

ion that more specific Information
on the activities and aims of the
ISC is desired by students, partic

were boiled down to a minimum and a strong executive power
was placed in the hands of Election Board last night by Excom.
Approval was quick following Carl Burke's reading of the
changes proposed by him and H. D. Thoreau, members of

election committee. A proposed
change permitting campaign funds
was tabled until next week.
NKSS BOARD CHAIRMAN
Gordon Ness, a second - quarter
freshman living in the Village, was
appointed Election Board chairman.
Ness has been corresponding with
other leading universities on the
subject of student elections. Last

Doug Crawford of the Leadership
Institute Committee, and A.S.S.U.
Vice - President Millie Edwards,
will review pros and cons of the
campaign funds clause.
POWER OF DECISION
The new by-laws provide a skele
ton operational procedure for Elec
tion Board, which was granted pow
er to make all decisions not covered.
The Board will present its plan of
operation to Excom two weeks be
fore each election. The move is de
signed to eliminate the possibility
of inconsequential violations, one
of which could make an entire elec
tion illegal.
Major change in the by-laws
passed provides for a primary
election for all offices where the
preferential system previously ap
plied, provided more than four
candidates are nominated. In the
primary each voter shall vote for
only one candidate per office.
Those four candidates receiving

preferential voting.

EXPENDITURES APPROVED

As proposed by Burke and Tho
reau, candidates for A.S.S.U. presi
dent and vice-president would be
allowed $15, candidates for Other
offices, $10. According to Thoreau
the figures mentioned are arbitrary;
however, they set a precedent. Pre
viously no expenditure for cam
paign purposes was permitted.
Ness requests that any sugges
tions regarding campaign funds be
addressed to him, care of the Daily.
He will report, his findings to Ex
com next week.

Recommendation that Stanford join the National Students Or
ganization was made to Excom last night by Niel Allen, head of
International Survey Committee, in a general report on Decem
ber's Chicago student conference.
Allen's report was not the full one that had been promised
as mimeographed material prepared during the conference has

not yet been received from Chicago.
FOL K PANELS
The report contained little of the
actual business conducted at Chi
cago, but did reveal that the confer
ence had been divided into four
panels:
National Continuations Commit
tee, national organization, student
needs and responsibilities in interna
tional affairs, and aims of the na
tional organization.
Farm delegates felt that joining
the NSO will allow Stanford to
learn about other colleges' activities,
expand the ISC, and permit discus
sion of problems common to all stu
dents.
Excom members expressed opin
ion that more specific Information
on the activities and aims of the
ISC is desired by students, partic
ularly in regard to travel abroad
this summer.

nounced that the Daily will present
a specific plan for student interna
tional activities through the paper.

ment and Stanford participation at

kcepsie came from the report sub
mitted by Lou Lindsey and Stan
Cumberpatch, coach and captain of

though Mr. Masters did say that
he would recommend the crew l>e
given $600.

will not recommend crew be put on
the budget. Further discussion of
the problem was tabled 1n the ab
sence of A.S.S.U. President Martin
Anderson.
Committee member Margy Pow
er requested that Excom mem
bers contact their living groups'
members on the suggestion that a
new pavilion be the War Memo
rial. Miss Power said she had re
ceived favorable comment on the
plan.

feeling that the recent War Memo
rial poll had not been a true cross
section of student opinion,

By-laws to the ASSU Constitution pertaining to elections
were boiled down to a minimum and a strong executive power
was placed in the hands of Election Board last night by Excom.
Approval was quick following Carl Burke's reading of the
changes proposed by him and H. D. Thoreau, members of

election committee. A proposed
change permitting campaign funds
was tabled until next week.
NKSS BOARD CHAIRMAN
Gordon Ness, a second - quarter
freshman living in the Village, was
appointed Election Board chairman.
Ness has been corresponding with
other leading universities on the
subject of student elections. Last
night he made an informal canvass
of the Row to further his research
on views toward improving voting
procedure.

A round-table discussion over
KSU tonight at 7. featuring Ness,
Doug Crawford of the Leadership
Institute Committee, and A.S.S.U.
Vice - President Millie Edwards,
will review pros and cons of the
campaign funds clause.
POWER OF DECISION
The new by-laws provide a skele
ton operational procedure for Elec
tion Board, which was granted pow
er to make all decisions not covered.
The Board will present its plan of
operation to Excom two weeks be
fore each election. The move is de
signed to eliminate the possibility
of inconsequential violations, one
of which could make an entire elec
tion illegal.
Major change in the by-laws
passed provides for a primary
election for all offices where the
preferential system previously ap
plied, provided more than four
candidates are nominated. In the
primary each voter shall vote for
only one candidate per office.
Those four candidates receiving
the highest number of votes for
each office shall he placed on the
final ballot, where there will he
preferential voting.

EXPENDITURES APPROVED

As proposed by Burke and Tho
reau, candidates for A.S.S.U. presi
dent and vice-president would be
allowed $15, candidates for Other
offices, $10. According to Thoreau
the figures mentioned are arbitrary;
however, they set a precedent. Pre
viously no expenditure for cam
paign purposes was permitted.
Ness requests that any sugges
tions regarding campaign funds be
addressed to him, care of the Daily.
He will report, his findings to Ex
com next week.

Recommendation that Stanford join the National Students Or
ganization was made to Excom last night by Niel Allen, head of
International Survey Committee, in a general report on Decem
ber's Chicago student conference.
Allen's report was not the full one that had been promised
as mimeographed material prepared during the conference has

not yet been received from Chicago.
FOL K PANELS
The report contained little of the
actual business conducted at Chi
cago, but did reveal that the confer
ence had been divided into four
panels:
National Continuations Commit
tee, national organization, student
needs and responsibilities in interna
tional affairs, and aims of the na
tional organization.
Farm delegates felt that joining
the NSO will allow Stanford to
learn about other colleges' activities,
expand the ISC, and permit discus
sion of problems common to all stu
dents.
Excom members expressed opin
ion that more specific Information
on the activities and aims of the
ISC is desired by students, partic
ularly in regard to travel abroad
this summer.

Beth Mac Vicar, Daily editor, an
nounced that the Daily will present
a specific plan for student interna
tional activities through the paper.
Allen, Bill Slocurn, Marilyn Sid
well, and Nancy Alden were dele
gates to the conference.
Estimates that $1,000 to $1,500 will
allow maintenance of crew equip
ment and Stanford participation at
UCLA, Washington, and Pough
kcepsie came from the report sub
mitted by Lou Lindsey and Stan
Cumberpatch, coach and captain of
the crew, respectively.
Mickey Titus and Sam Streeter
staled that Graduate Manager AI
Masters recommended meet
ing with them that discussion of
crew be dropped for this year, al
though Mr. Masters did say that
he would recommend the crew l>e
given $600.
CREW BUDGET PROBLEM
However, Mr. Masters stated he
will not recommend crew be put on
the budget. Further discussion of
the problem was tabled 1n the ab
sence of A.S.S.U. President Martin
Anderson.
Committee member Margy Pow
er requested that Excom mem
bers contact their living groups'
members on the suggestion that a
new pavilion be the War Memo
rial. Miss Power said she had re
ceived favorable comment on the
plan.

Excom members expressed the
feeling that the recent War Memo
rial poll had not been a true cross
section of student opinion,
Excom also heard a report from
the Honor Code Committee, which is
planning a series of talks to living
groups prior to a poll on the Honor
Code.
