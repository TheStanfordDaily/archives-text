# Bailey to List College Values
## 
### 
What values does college odor to
Ihe average girl? Dr. Margery Bai
ley, associate professor of English,
will answer this question tonight
when she opens the winter quarter
.series of talks sponsored by Vocom.
All women are invited to hear Miss
Bailey at 7:15 in the auditorium of
the Women's Clubhouse.
Stressing the cultural and liberal
advantages in a university educa
tion. apart from vocational train
ing, Miss Bailey will advance a
perspective to those whose goal in
college is still unclear.
Many generations of Stanford stu
dents have had the benefit of Miss
Bailey's instruction in Shakespeare
courses, which have made her a
leader in her field. Those, who might
otherwise be unable to take her
courses, will have the opportunity
to hear her this evening.
Vocom will sponsor four more
talks this quarter in an attempt to
aid women students in choosing
their major, to emphasize the uni
versity facilities for obtaining po
sitions after a student's graduation.
The fields to be covered are: psy
chology, both retail and agency ad
vertising, international relations, and
information about the Stanford Ap
pointment Service.
