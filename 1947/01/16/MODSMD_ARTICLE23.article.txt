intense discussion last night in the
Village Auditorium, went on rec
cord as opposing Communists and
Communist theory, but favored al
lowing any veteran to join the
chapter as long as he recognizes the
principles for which the organiza
tion stands. Members, in short,
terse statements, denounced cer
tain attacks which have been made
on the AVC recently, and reaffirmed
the democratic principle by refusing
to set up limitations on member

A second motion passed by a
majority vote of the members pres
ent condemned the National Plan
