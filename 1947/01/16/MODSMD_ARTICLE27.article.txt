# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Roll On, You Indians! 
### 
A challenge, as well as an indictment of
student activities, v/as made in yesterday's
Daily. We noted, as we have in the past, a
lack of leadership, lack of sincere participa
tion, an unco-ordinated melee of activities
which make sense to but few, and a barrier
which wrongly separates the fundamental
aims of students, faculty, and administration
officials.
To indict any person, any faction, or any
activity group specifically would be mani
festly unfair; each is a part of, and reflects the
whole situation. It is a case of blind leading
blind in a vicious monotonous circle.
Out classes aie supposed to supply us with
he inspiration and puipose ioi our being in
liool, but the job they do is mercilessly in
idequate for two reasons: 1J the social and
[.; .vhiical activities oi the students back up th'e
lassroom unconvincingly if at all; and 2) vice
versa- the professors that we know are not
plumbing their vocabuiar es or theii view
points for any interpretations o 1 subject mat-
I- r not required by the name and number of
their courses.
Jt is the opinion of the Daily that Stanford's
lethargy stems directly from an inability to
r cognize the common purpose of all univer
.s:ly people, and its vital importance to us all.
Supposedly, we are at Stanford to learn what
kind of a world we live in, how best we can
rdjust to it, and what things in it could best be
altered.
No problem today, we believe, falls outside
the realm of this: people who are to become
worthwhile, individual citizens anywhere must
be vitally aware of the world in which they
have taken a place.
We surmised from Excom's enthusiastic ap
proval of the International Survey last quarter,
that the members of that committee at least
were cognizant of the problem and ready to
begin on the long road toward solution. But
somehow, the ISC got lost in the maze of the
petty items which fumbling activity groups

placed on Excom's agenda, and wound up in
the office of A.S.S.U. President Martin Ander
son, and in the minds of the select few who
are committeemen on the ISC.
Today the ISC remains the only step for
ward by a student government toward inter
national awareness, and its contribution to
ward the admirable aims set forth for it by I
Excom were shown last night to be but a !
minute part of what should—and could—be !
done, by the doubting questioners sitting
about the Excom table.
Once the selection of a hypothetical three
students is made during the first weeks of
February, the ISC books and benefits will be
closed for the academic year except to those
selected. By next year, interest in the Survey
itself will have to be painfully revived, to a
tudent body (and Excom) which may not be 1
receptive to its program.
The plans which ISC head Niel Allen has j
for expanding the Survey cannot be put into j
effect except by a further delegation of power !
by Excom, since Excom's motions limited him 1
to the specific functions of sending these stu
dents abroad on a travel program. So it's up
to Excom.
We of The Daily want Stanford to be keyed
to the international atmosphere which stu
dents either want or do not yet want because '
they are not aware they need it. To stimulate
student support (the first requirement for any 1
pervading internationalism at Stanford) we j
must first offer something of concrete benefit j
to the students themselves; and second, get
Excom's organizational and solid support for
such an offer.
In the next few days The Daily will present
the problem, and its plan for solution—to Ex
com, to the student activity groups, to the fac
ulty, and to the Administration of Stanford.
Its plan calls for a wide expansion of the pro- :
gram now offered by the ISC, plus a co-ordi- !
nation of the ideas and activities drifting aim
lessly around the campus. We want your
opinion—so stick around.
