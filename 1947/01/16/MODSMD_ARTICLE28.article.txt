# BULL SESSION

### 
One of the more advanced courses in th? Journal
ism Department is a very select group (composed, of
course, of only the higher intellectuals among the
morons who major in journalism) that goes to the
City twice a week to work on one of the large
papers up there.
The idea behind the course is that they shall learn
many of the wonders of operating a big city news
paper and absorb much practical experience that will
b? of later value.
• Among these great minds who make the trek to
S.F. twice weekly is the editor (female, her driver's
license says) of one of our daily campus publica
tions. Far be it from me to mention names.
She (just can't keep sex out of this column, can
you, Coughlin?) was assigned to make the rounds
up there with a reporter who was covering the City
Hall beat.
He very sweetly and kindly took her around to
meet all the prominent city officials. And as he intro
duced each one, he informed her that the official
was a former Stanford journalism professor. She,
of course, was especially gracious to each, ju.st in
case they still carried any weight down here.
It took about four introductions before she caught
on to the gag. And now she has lost all faith in the
veracity of the pteks.
Especially since she overheard the reporter call-

Ii
ing a follow scribe to inquire, "Say, what kinda '
woman did YOU get?"
* * *
Notice that Longbarn's ad in yesterday's Daily
advises, "0.K., 8.C., rabbits it is—hurry before they
flood the place." Hurry? What am I supposed to clo
now, rush down and lecture them on birth control?

In one of those large classes which meet in vast
rooms these days, one of our profs was lecturing his
students with the aid oi a throat mike in order that
his words of wisdom might clearly reach the entire
assemblage. Then, above his voice, music began to
watt sweetly through the room, much to his amaze- i
ment. He began talking louder and louder but it
didn t seem to help. Finally he stopped, refusing
to compete with Sinatra et al. The music continued.
Investigation revealed it was coming through the
microphone hookup, which was plugged into the
wall. The source? None other than KSU, appar
ently. broadcasting ofT schedule.
It looks as though Stanford's radio engineers are
going to be faced with another problem to solve if
they continue to use the wiring circuit for trans
mission when the station expands.
Or do you like to listen to Bing during your
Poli Sci classes? Frankly, even "John's Other Wife" '
would be an improvement on some of my profs.

• Among these great minds who make the trek to
S.F. twice weekly is the editor (female, her driver's
license says) of one of our daily campus publica
tions. Far be it from me to mention names.
She (just can't keep sex out of this column, can
you, Coughlin?) was assigned to make the rounds
up there with a reporter who was covering the City
Hall beat.
He very sweetly and kindly took her around to
meet all the prominent city officials. And as he intro
duced each one, he informed her that the official
was a former Stanford journalism professor. She,
of course, was especially gracious to each, ju.st in
case they still carried any weight down here.
It took about four introductions before she caught
on to the gag. And now she has lost all faith in the
veracity of the pteks.
Especially since she overheard the reporter call-

woman did YOU get?"

Notice that Longbarn's ad in yesterday's Daily
advises, "0.K., 8.C., rabbits it is—hurry before they
flood the place." Hurry? What am I supposed to clo

In one of those large classes which meet in vast
rooms these days, one of our profs was lecturing his
students with the aid oi a throat mike in order that
his words of wisdom might clearly reach the entire
assemblage. Then, above his voice, music began to
watt sweetly through the room, much to his amaze- i
ment. He began talking louder and louder but it
didn t seem to help. Finally he stopped, refusing
to compete with Sinatra et al. The music continued.
Investigation revealed it was coming through the
microphone hookup, which was plugged into the
wall. The source? None other than KSU, appar
ently. broadcasting ofT schedule.
It looks as though Stanford's radio engineers are
going to be faced with another problem to solve if
they continue to use the wiring circuit for trans
mission when the station expands.
Or do you like to listen to Bing during your
Poli Sci classes? Frankly, even "John's Other Wife" '
would be an improvement on some of my profs.
One of the more advanced courses in th? Journal
ism Department is a very select group (composed, of
course, of only the higher intellectuals among the
morons who major in journalism) that goes to the
City twice a week to work on one of the large
papers up there.
The idea behind the course is that they shall learn
many of the wonders of operating a big city news
paper and absorb much practical experience that will
b? of later value.
