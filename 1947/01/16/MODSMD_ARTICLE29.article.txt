While the top story in last night's metropolitan
sheets was that interesting dissection in southwest
Ix)s Angeles, it has no international implications.
Unless it should turn out that the deceased is a
Russian delegate to something, that is. My top story
doesn't have any international implications, either,
as you may discover if you read on. Why. then, don't
1 discuss the Los Angeles affair? Matter of policy—if
you don't like it, you are free to read some other
campus paper. Rev. 13:18.
My top story takes place in the Georgia capitol.
Their Twin Excellencies have, so far, avoided mass

bloodshed. The question at issue,
which will probably be settled
without bloodshed, so law-abid
ing now are Americans outside
of Tennessee, is this: When the
governor-elect dies before his
term begins, who should succeed
him? The Georgia constitution is
vague. "Governor" Arnall says
that the lieutenant - governor
fleet should succeed as governor.
'Governor Talmadge says that

the Legislature should select a governor from the
remaining candidates for that office. Disregarding
their maneuvers to control the armed forces of that
sovereign state, the question will probably be settled
by the Georgia courts, where Arnall's attorney-gen
eral has already filed a petition for a declaratory
opinion.
The announcement of a military and economic
alliance between France and Great Britain is of
considerably greater importance than this South
Ruritanian battle for the throne, however. Premier

SLeon Blum's government has decided, apparently,
that, since Fraiice cannot now stand alone, she will
do better to line up with Britain than with Russia.
Tho agreements are natural enough; France and
Britain stood shoulder to shoulder through war,
peace, and appeasement up until 1940. Both now
are largely socialist in politics, yet both have empires
that are giving them tuouble; both are involved in
"the great complex of Western civilization"; and
they are geographically neighbors. That this is a
distinct step in the direction of that "Western bloc"
that has been widely discussed, cannot be denied.
The French Chamber, it must be pointed out, has
a plurality, although not a majority, of Communist
members. It has been said that the French Com
munists could take over the government and the
country at any time. This may be mere journalism,
but, nevertheless, the two other major parlies, the
Socialists and the MRP. must have some positive
program to offer, or the Communists stand a good
chance of taking the country by default. The
formation of a "Western bloc." apparently, is their
answer.
There is one other consideration. Neither France
nor Britain seem to have much faith in the future
of the United States. They wish to secure themselves,
so far as possible, against the adverse effects of (a)
an American retreat into isolationism that would
leave our sometime allies high and dry, and (b)
another economic depression like that of the 1930's
thut would drag down with us any economic depend
ents we might have. Should these policies continue,
we will see a world split into an Eastern-communist
bloc, a Western-socialist bloc, and an American
capitalist bloc, a curious concurrence of geography
and economic theory.
