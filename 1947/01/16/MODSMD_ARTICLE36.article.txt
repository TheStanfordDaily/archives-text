# Indian Cagemen Hope For Upset
## 
### ART SHAPIRO 
Two men will be holding the fate of the Stanford hoopsters
in their hands, come the weekend. Forwards Morley Thompson
and Babe Higgins are the boys who will be in a position to make
or break the chances of the Indians against Nibs Price and the
league-leading Cal cagemen.
The Cardinal five which will take the floor Friday against
the Bears is one of the finest defen-;

sive outfits on the coast. The ques
tion which has been hanging fire all
during the week is whether the In
jin's attack, in the person of Messrs.
Thompson and Higgins, can reap
enough rewards in the form of two
pointers, to outscore the harassed
Blue and Gold.
AS GOES THOMPSON . . .
It might almost be said that as
goes Thompson, so goes Stanford.
In the two games in which Morley I
demonstrated his real ability, the i
first encounter with San Jose State
and the Friday affair clown in !
Westwood, the Cardinals crashed |
ahead to decisive victories. When
Morley was "off," so was the team, j
The remainder of the starting
five, Dave Davidson, Hill Stephen
son, and Dick Berlin or Fred
Lewis, have been particularly
constant in their court games. All
have come through with highly
creditable performances, hut a ;
spark is needed to set the team
off, and (o fill that bill there is
either Morley, the rookie, or Babe,
the veteran.
Both are fine candidates for the I
job. Babe Higgins has more expe
rience behind him than has Morley. j
He starred for the Cal team in 1943
at a guard slot and made All-Coast
at the end of the season. He's a i
smooth ball handler, doesn't fluster j
under pressure, and has a depend
able shot. Morley Thompson, All- >
City during his high school days in I
San Francisco, on the other hand, is
young, unpredictable, and sparkles \
brilliantly on those days when he's ]
on and his shots are in.
If either of these two boys comes 1
through during tho current week- !
end encounters, it will be another I
U.C.L.A. case for the papers to ex- !
cuse away. If they fail to find the â– 
basket it will be a sad holiday down j
on the Farm.
FOUR FAUX PAS
The Cal quintet which will be
facing the Red Machine on Friday |
and Saturday evenings, and which j
has been called "unbeatable" by \
many of the sporting element j
around Quad, is in reality far from j
that. They have already dropped J
four contests: to San Francisco, the j
Oakland Bittners, Santa Clara and !
one to Indiana. Their defensive play j
has frequently been far from bril- j
liant, and their offensive has been j
stopped or stalled by at least half j
of the squads they have faced so far
in conference and non-conference j
play.
Hanger, the fi - foot S - inch
center, holds the key to the Bears'
scoring abilities. When Hanger is
guarded well the Cal team is de
prived of its heavy artillery and
fumbles around looking for ways
to cash in on any possible angle.
The Indians displayed their flair
for stopping high scorers when
they strait-jacketed the Uclans'
"Gold Dust Twins." Don Barks
dale and Davage Minor. If the
Dean-men can pidl the same trick
on Hanger, and hold the angles to
acute ones for the rest of the Cal
live, there is no reason why the
Cardinals shouldn't be able to
ring down the curtain on Califor
nia and cop at least one of the two
. frays. v
Another weekend, and another
prediction that the Stanford var
sity will not be denied. Get those
surprised looks ready, for here
comes "the team without a
chance." Only don't forget, we
told you so.
