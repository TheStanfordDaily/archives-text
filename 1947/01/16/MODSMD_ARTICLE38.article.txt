# Babe Ruth Unimproved
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 15 (UP).—A
gray-haired little nurse, who has
been standing guard outside iiis hos
pital room for 51 days, said tonight
that "B;ibe Ruth isn't doing so well."
And the sign in big bold letters on
the closed oak door which read "no
visitors" meant just what it said, she
emphasized.
"It would just upset him, and be
sides it would cost me my job," she
said. "He's still a very sick man, you
know." *
Tonight's latest bulletin described
the B;ibe's condition as "good" and
said there were no new develop
ments today.
But clad in institutional anonym
ity, she gave all the details of his
hospitalization, and passed on what
little the Babe has had to say since
entering French last Nov.
26.
"He always wants to see the sto
ries in the paper about him, and I
show them to him," she said. "To
day, I showed him the paper and he
read a story that said he was much
improved. That cheered him up a
lot."
The nurse said that Ruth turned
to her and said "so they say I'm get
ting better—well that's swell."
She was very much incensed over
reports that flocks of school kids had
broken into Ruth's room to see him
despite the "no visitors" sign and
despite the constant guard outside
the door.
"They didn't do that," she said.
"Mr. Ruth has had only three visi
tors since his operation was per
formed, his wife and two men, whom
I don't even know, who come in and
take care of his business affairs and
answer his correspondence."
She explained, however, that Ruth
did see a few kids, but that he had
asked to see them.
"He walks up and down the corri
dor just once each day," she said.
"Well, on one day there were some
children who were with parents vis
iting other patients. They saw him
and recognized him and of course
they went right up to talk to him.
"When we started to chase them
away, he stopped us and told the
kids to come on in to his room and
he would visit with them. He's such
a good-hearted man."
The nurse said Ruth was in bed
almost all of the time except when
he took his walk down the corridor
"to get back his strength."
"He talks very little, sleeps very
little, and doesn't have anything to
say about what he is going to do
when he gets out of the hospital."
She said Ruth hadn't mentioned
baseball or anything about bowling
or golf since he had been in the hos
pital.
"1 guess he isn't the same old
Babe," she said.

show them to him," she said. "To
day, I showed him the paper and he
read a story that said he was much
improved. That cheered him up a
lot."
The nurse said that Ruth turned
to her and said "so they say I'm get
ting better—well that's swell."
She was very much incensed over
reports that flocks of school kids had
broken into Ruth's room to see him
despite the "no visitors" sign and
despite the constant guard outside
the door.
"They didn't do that," she said.
"Mr. Ruth has had only three visi
tors since his operation was per
formed, his wife and two men, whom
I don't even know, who come in and
take care of his business affairs and
answer his correspondence."
She explained, however, that Ruth
did see a few kids, but that he had
asked to see them.
"He walks up and down the corri
dor just once each day," she said.
"Well, on one day there were some
children who were with parents vis
iting other patients. They saw him
and recognized him and of course
they went right up to talk to him.
"When we started to chase them
away, he stopped us and told the
kids to come on in to his room and
he would visit with them. He's such
a good-hearted man."
The nurse said Ruth was in bed
almost all of the time except when
he took his walk down the corridor
"to get back his strength."
"He talks very little, sleeps very
little, and doesn't have anything to
say about what he is going to do
when he gets out of the hospital."
She said Ruth hadn't mentioned
baseball or anything about bowling
or golf since he had been in the hos
pital.
"1 guess he isn't the same old
Babe," she said.
NEW YORK, Jan. 15 (UP).—A
gray-haired little nurse, who has
been standing guard outside iiis hos
pital room for 51 days, said tonight
that "B;ibe Ruth isn't doing so well."
And the sign in big bold letters on
the closed oak door which read "no
visitors" meant just what it said, she
emphasized.
"It would just upset him, and be
sides it would cost me my job," she
said. "He's still a very sick man, you
know." *
Tonight's latest bulletin described
the B;ibe's condition as "good" and
said there were no new develop
ments today.
But clad in institutional anonym
ity, she gave all the details of his
hospitalization, and passed on what
little the Babe has had to say since
entering French last Nov.
26.
"He always wants to see the sto
ries in the paper about him, and I
show them to him," she said. "To
day, I showed him the paper and he
read a story that said he was much
improved. That cheered him up a
lot."
