RICHMOND, Calif., Jan. 15 (UP) ♦
—Denying any rift in Ihe ranks of !
the touring professional golfers,
George Schneiter, chairman of the
PGA tournament committee today i
termed the recent "unpleasantness" ;
between tournament manager Free! j
Corcoran and player Dick Metz as
purely a "personal feud."
As the cream of the nation's golf
ing leadel'S gathered here for the
start of the four-day $10,000 Rich
mond Open Tournament tomorrow,
a cross-section poll of the star shot
makers taken by United Press sup
ported Scheiter's claims.
"I've attended all tiie player
executive meetings of recent
years." said Schneiter. "And I
have yet to see a serious dispute."
"Sure, we have room for improve- i
ment—what business hasn't. But we
have steadily gained in all directions j
and I'm sure we will continue to do
so under Mr. Corcoran."
Meanwhile, players warming up
over the sunny Richmond course, I
which sponsors one of the few 72- !
hole tournaments in the West, were I
for the mofet part backing Corcoran.
"You can't he mad at a guy that
increases your salary," said Bob
Hamilton, former national PGA
champion." If your salary was j
raised from $20 a week to $100 a
week how could you complain?"
Denny Shutes, two-time winner of
the PGA crown, termed the. Metz-
Corcoran one-punch battle in Car
mel as a tempest in a teapot.
"That fight dates back to an old
feud and has nothing to do with J
what could be called a 'split in our [
ranks,' " said Shutes.
Metz. following his asserted at
tack on Corcoran during the Bing
Crosby tournament at Del Monte,
had charged that the majority of
the players were opposed to Cor
coran as tournament manager.
Corcoran had recently been given
a three-year contract by PGA Presi- I
dent Ed Dudley.
Jimmy Demaret, colorful profes- j
sional from Houston, Texas, also ;
supported Corcoran and pointed out
that there were bound to be "dis
senters."
"Corcoran has the most thank
less job in sports," said Demaret.
"No matter who we would choose
for that job he would be sure to
have a few in opposition."
Since taking over as PGA tourna
ment manager in 1936, players un
der Corcoran's guidance have
watched the purses spiral from a
meager $!)0.000 a year to $484,000 in
| 1946 and probably over half a mil
. lion dollars in 1947.
In the 10 years he has been han
j dling the job, more than $2,500,000
| has been divided in tournament
prizes.
"On top of all this," said Schneiter,
"Corcoran did a wonderful job dur
ing the war. Under his direction we
sold $600,000,000 in war bonds and
we raised $610,000 for the veteran's
rehabilitation which is directed by
Leo Diegel."
