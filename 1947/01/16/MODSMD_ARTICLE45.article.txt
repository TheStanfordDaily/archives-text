# Mural League Mixup Fixed
## 
### 
With the end of the first week of
the Intramural Basketball League
tonight, Director Gene Coldiron
will take stock of the riotous pro
gram and hope for saner days as
the schedule progresses. Among th"
many difficulties that arose during
the inaugural sessions of the league
was the mixup over dates which
conflicted with the fraternity rush
ing schedule. Five contests were
lost in the first week shuffle, thus
complicating the remainder of the
basketball season with a bevy of
unplayed games.
Isut the situation was clearing
this morning as the master sched
ule of the entire season was
mailed to each of the competing
teams. Team managers will re
ceive the day-to-day pairings and
will be expected to see that their
teams appear for games. Unless
proper authorization for postpon
ing a contest lias been cleared
through the Intramural Office of
the S.A.C., absentee quintets will
be dropped from competition.
Meanwhile, the initial meeting of
the new Advisory Council has been
called for Monday at 4:30 in Room
10 of the SA.C. Intramural Direc
tor Coldiron will outline the duties
of the Council with a discussion of
the League's early problems on tap
for the meeting.
