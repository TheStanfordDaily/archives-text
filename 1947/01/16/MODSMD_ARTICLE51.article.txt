# Farm Rents Land For Flax Raising
## 
### 
Comes Maytime and 200 acres of
the fields on the front and rear sides
of Branner Kail will be covered
with thousands of blue flax plant
blooms.
Following the Stanford policy of
leasing much of the 9.000-acre cam
pus not occupied by University
buildings, the .section was rented to
J. J. McNamara, who plans to sow
the area with seed flax, the type
used to produce fats and linseed
oil.
Three tractor drivers, accompa
nied by several hundred sea gulls
(they're in it for the worms) spent
all day Sunday plowing up the
ground in preparation for next
month's planting.
Mr. McNamara showed special
consideration for Stanford tradition
when he chose to plant flax instead
of blue cornflower. The blooms will
be of a bright blue color in May.
he explained, but the stubble will
turn to either dark red or brown
before Big Game time so that there
need be no ill feelings between him
and the student body.
In return for his concern, how
ever. he hopes that Branner women
will not decide to decorate their
rooms with blue blossoms next
May. Flax blooms make attractive
floral displays, but Mr. McNamara
is in his business to earn a living
besides making a little something
on the side.
