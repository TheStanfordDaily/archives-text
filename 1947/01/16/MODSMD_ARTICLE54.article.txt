# Irvine, Bloch Speak To Faculty Groups
## 
### 
"George Bernard Shaw and Rus
sia, Shaw's Later Political Thought"
was the topic of the speech by Will
iam Irvine, Associate Professor of
English, before the Faculty Research
Club. Felix Bloch, Professor of
Physics, explained the "Modern
Problems in Nuclear Research" to
the club last night.
Mr. Irvine told how Shaw had be
come disillusioned with constitu
tional democracy with the failure of
the Versailles Treaty and had be
come an almost unqualified advo
cate of Russian Communism, which
he saw as a kind of democratic or
ganization. With World War II he
became increasingly distrustful of
force and returned to a belief in
constitutional democracy.
