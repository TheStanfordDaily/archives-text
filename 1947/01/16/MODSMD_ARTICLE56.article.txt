SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 15 (UP).
â€”Watch for a cigar-smoking man
with a southern accent and Ihc tip
of his right index finger missing who
says he's an FBI agent, the FBI said
today. He isn't.
And he's wanted for passing bad
checks and impersonating one of J.
Eclgar Hoover's agents in northern
and central California.
