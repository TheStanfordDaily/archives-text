LONDON, Jan. 15 (UP).â€”Russia
j has rejected a United States demand
I that it fulfill its obligations under
the Yalta and Potsdam agreements
to insure a fair election in Poland
I Sunday, the Moscow radio disclosed
j today.
In a formel note to Russia, which
Moscow broadcast, the United States
| said that far more than thp Polish
! election itself was at stake.
Reminding Russia that the Al
lied Big Three at Yalta and Pots
dam pledged themselves to insure
an honest election in Poland, the
1 United States note, delivered by
Ambassador Lt. Gen. Walter Be
dell Smith, said:
"What is involved here is the
| sanctity of international agreements,
a principle on which depends the
; establishment and maintenance of
i peace and the origin of justice un
' der law.
'it is of no significance that the
j subject matter of this agreement
relates to elections in Poland. The
essential fact is that it constitutes
a principle on which all four na
tions concerned have agreed."
The four nations concerned are
the United States, Great Britain,
; Russia and Poland.
