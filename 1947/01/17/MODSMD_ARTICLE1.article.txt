# Cal Favored In Tonight's Varsity Tilt At Berkeley
## 
### ART SHAPIRO 
Facing an automatic eight-point
disadvantage because of the locale
of the fray tonight, the Stanford
varsity and B squads will leave the
Farm at 4:45 and head into the lair
of the Golden Bear at Berkeley.
The varsity encounter will take
place at 8:30, preceded by the B
squad tilt at 7. There will be a re
turn engagement in the Pavilion
here tomorrow night.
California, favored by schedule
makers with live home {fames out
of the lirst six league contests,
will carry their advantage into
tonight's clash, but will need
quite a few more points to cinch
any victory.
Taking the floor against the Blue
and Gold will be the starting quin
tet which proved the undoing of
U.C.L.A.: Morley Thompson and
Babe Higgins at the forward slots,
Bill Stephenson at center, and Dave
Davidson and Dick Berlin at the
guard positions.
CAL LINEUP
The Cal starting lineup will in
clude some of the finest hoopsters
in conference competition this year.
Chuck Hanger, the 6-foot 5'2-ineh
center playing his second year for
Berkeley, and erstwhile high jump
er, is the finest rebound man around
these parts. He is at present lead
ing the conference in the scoring
parade and is a tower of strength
at .the center slot.
Jack Rocker, topping the meas
uring stick at (» feet V ± inches,
teams up with Hanger under the
boards and gives to California a
decided height advantage down
where the playing gets a wee hit
rough. The other forward, Andy
Wolfe, has been a disappointment
to the followers of Oskic the Bear
this season. Unable to hit the net
ting. Andy has been forced to
play a secondary role in the Cal
attack as play maker.
The guard positions are held
down by Boh Hogeboom and Bill
Durkee. Hogeboom is playing his
third season for the Blue and Gold.
His best year came during the 194,5
46 campaign when he teamed up
with Andy Wolfe to capture All-
Conference honors. Bill Durkee.
the only senior on the squad, is a
steady floormari, and a constant
threat when and if the other mem
bers of the squad are held down too
closely.
