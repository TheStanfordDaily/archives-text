## Student institute Starts World Interest Campaign 
### 
A "Student Institute on International Relations" may be an
other step toward widening the borders of student intelligence
' in world affairs if enough interest is shown at a meeting to be
: held Monday at 8 p.m. in the Women's Clubhouse.
Delegates to the recent Asilomar Conference ("Y" student
j meeting) will conduct the meeting to which any person interested

in beginning a 'program for discus
sion of international problems is in
vited.
The purpose of the institute, con
sisting of several days of lectures
and discussions by prominent physi
cists, political scientists and foreign
observers on campus, would be to
provide a definite program for "edu
cation, inspiration, and responsibil
ity for action in international rela
tions" for students.
The institute, which would be
modeled after the successful Reed
College of Portland, Ore., three-day
meeting last year, would tackle such
subjects as Russo-American rela
tions, the U.N., the causes of war,
nationalism, atomic power, geo
economy, and related topics.
