# INDEPENDENCE URGED FOR MANLESS WOMEN
## 
### 
"College does not prepare a girl
for the position she will have in
( life; therefore she must do it her
self," was the essence of a talk by
' Dr. Margery Bailey to a large au
dience at the first of the Vocom j
series last night.
Stilting that so many middle-aged i
1 women, finding themselves alone
without children or without hus
i bands, wail, "Nobody wants me
i now." Dr. Bailey said that women
must face the fact that, they will I
j probably either be old maids or j
widows eventually and prepare
j themselves for this.
Dr. Bailey said that there are a
j great many advantages to the Eu
ropean dowry system; at least, un- I

der this system women are assured
dignity in their middle and old age.
She; went on that women were
now being herded into "improve
ment. groups" and that much more
good would probably be had by go
ing on long walks.
Colleges aren't helping women to
find the dignity and independence
which they will need. Therefore
women must go to books, especially
biographies. Dr. Bailey said that
after a woman has lost three or four
men, the libraries will still be there.
She especially stressed the fact
that women must learn to enjoy
their own thoughts; they must,
above all, be independent. Growth,
stimulus, and interest must be the
goals of education, not merely unjts.
