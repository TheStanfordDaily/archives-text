### 
As rushing moves into the first of a series of luncheon and
dinner periods today, the Interfraternity Board and the Interfra
ternity Council met last night to discuss rushing progress and
other fraternity problems.
Dean of Students John M. Stalnaker spoke briefly to the
Board, which met at the Delta Tau Delta House. He emphasized

'â– the work remaining to be done by
fraternities on financial problems,
rushing, house discipline, and house
scholarship.
The Board meeting was in the na
ture of a farewell for Mr. Jud Grary,
former president of the Palo Alto
National Bank, and a prominent fig
ure in Stanford fraternity life for
the past twenty-five years. He is
retiring from the Board and will
leave for the East very soon.
Following the Board meeting, the
Interfraternity Council, consisting of
all the house presidents, met briefly
to discuss final rushing procedures
and to receive a report on the Board
meeting from Interfraternity Presi
