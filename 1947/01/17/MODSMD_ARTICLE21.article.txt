ATLANTA, Ga., Jan. 1G (UP).â€”(
An explosion and tear gas, appar
j ently the work of pranksters, punc- ]
[tuated Georgia's dual governorship ;
! crisis today as Gov. Herman Tal
; inadge seized the gubernatorial of- !
1 fices and the Executive Mansion and t

posted state police to ky*p out Gov.
Ellis Arnall.
The explosion, climaxing a fan
tastic day in the Statehouse, was
touched nIT on a balcony over
looking Arnall's emergency desk
in the Capitol rotunda. Investiga
tion revealed that it came from
n giant firecracker or possibly n
dummy shotgun shell.
The blast, reverberated through
the rotunda with the roar of an
artillery round and sent women
screaming for the exits. A tear-gas
container had been smashed earlier
in the Governor's ante-room near
Arnall':; old office which Tahnadgn
appropriated with the aid of state,
police.
Officials of the War and Justice
Departments held a worried confer
ence on the gubernatorial row to
day and hoped it would be settled
in Georgia without, forcing federal
intervention.
Spokesmen for both departments
said they were canvassing the sit
uation to determine what they
should or could do about it.
Their big worry was the chance
of bloodshed. In that case federal
authorities might have to step in.
The War Department's main in
terest centered on the role of the
Georgia National Guard and State
Guard forces in the political fight
started by Herman Talmadge's ef
forts to install himself as Governor
and oust incumbent Ellis Arnall.


GOV. ELLIS ARNALI/S REFUSAL to surrender his office to
Herman Talmadge resulted in blows outside the Georgia Governor's
office.
