## Shadow of an Idea 
### 
Students at Stanford in 194G surely remem
ber enough of war to know that they must not
only talk about, but work at this business of
international understanding. It's not the type
of work we can do extra-curricularly, hit-or
miss, for our social satisfaction. It's work that
has to be recognized as a real need, like eat
ing and sleeping are needs, for survival.
Our isolation at Stanford cannot be com
plete Martin Anderson and Excom averred
to that in approving the International Student
Survey. Conceived with high hopes and as
pirations, the Survey was to provide us a liai
son with students and thought in other na
'ions, a picture of social, economic, and cul
• nal conditions which would be meaningful
vhen reported to Stanford next fall. We
Med and applauded, and then we watched.
Ciaduully it became ipparent that loi this
/(.. r, lit least, the benelits oi the Survey would
; reshictud to the hypothetical three selected
i:u!or its travel progiam. We decided maybe
a year's wait would be too long an interim
irom wai to awake any student action as a
result of the travelers' reports. We became
that Excom must do much more,
to insure the success of its program.
Students going abroad, independently or
under the Survey, would have to have some
thing more concrete, of more sustaining in
t' rest to the student body, to do overseas than
"study economic and political conditions" for
reports to the student body. They must be
given definite and 112 ulf illable assignments,
taking into account what prospective listeners
at Stanford will want and be able to act upon.
The Reader's Digest can supply us informa
tion probably far more accurately than can a
student observer on economic and political
conditions of foreign countries. Stanford sur
vey students should instead find out what stu
dents and the man-on-the-foreign-street thinks
about America and its policies, what they
think we students can do to give them hope,
what universities are open and what jobs are
available abroad for us students at home.
These are considerations which come within
the common understanding of students and
average citizens at Stanford as well as in many
countries overseas.
(We suggest parenthetically however that
Spain, Greece, and Palestine, in their present
situations without normal universitv life, will

be ideally unsuited to yielding any basis lor
such understanding to a Stanford student on a
six-week tour. Yet these are three out of the
four countries which the I.S.C. itinerary com
mittee is considering for Stanford travelers.)
If the students at Stanford recognize the
value of visiting in foreign countries, then let
us realistically encourage it, by extending the
possibility of such visits to more than the three
selected under the I.S.C. Let us publicize,
through the 1.5.C., the student and youth con
ferences which are open to them all over Eu
rope this summer—at Oslo, Prague, and Swit
zerland—and the opportunities offered by the
youth hostels in every foreign region. (Many
students are already hopeful of going, with
out the stimulant of ready information and the
company of dther Stanford students.)
Further and somewhat separately —let us
set up an agency which specializes in com
piling information about jobs oveiseas—
where they are available, what tidining is ne
cessary, what work needs to be done. The
students who have already been abroad can
directly contribute what they learned about
job opportunities to this agency. What a force
ful counter-siimulant to provincialism would
result, if students were planning their courses
for lives and careers abroad.
Let us also set up an agency which will
supply the potential "international" student
with information about what universities are
open to him abroad—telling us about ex
change scholarships, courses offered, possi
bilities for housing.
I.S.C. committeemen already know the ropes
about getting passports, and boat reservations,
and similar necessities. Their aid in these
ways could be extended to all students who
desire it—and be assured that interest would
zoom 50 per cent higher, if the prospective
Stanford worker, traveler or student abroad
knew there was one place, readily accessible,
where he could receive assistance in getting
where he considers going.
These suggestions could easily be carried
out, but unless backed up, more fully, would
fall on their likeable faces. Machinery for such
a project must and will be outlined by the
Daily. We will further propose a co-ordination
of activities and the classroom to serve the
present purpose—to further international un
derstanding.

Students going abroad, independently or
under the Survey, would have to have some
thing more concrete, of more sustaining in
t' rest to the student body, to do overseas than
"study economic and political conditions" for
reports to the student body. They must be
given definite and 112 ulf illable assignments,
taking into account what prospective listeners
at Stanford will want and be able to act upon.
The Reader's Digest can supply us informa

student observer on economic and political
conditions of foreign countries. Stanford sur
vey students should instead find out what stu
dents and the man-on-the-foreign-street thinks
about America and its policies, what they
think we students can do to give them hope,
what universities are open and what jobs are
available abroad for us students at home.
These are considerations which come within
the common understanding of students and
average citizens at Stanford as well as in many
countries overseas.
(We suggest parenthetically however that
Spain, Greece, and Palestine, in their present
situations without normal universitv life, will

be ideally unsuited to yielding any basis lor
such understanding to a Stanford student on a
six-week tour. Yet these are three out of the
four countries which the I.S.C. itinerary com
mittee is considering for Stanford travelers.)
If the students at Stanford recognize the
value of visiting in foreign countries, then let
us realistically encourage it, by extending the
possibility of such visits to more than the three
selected under the I.S.C. Let us publicize,
through the 1.5.C., the student and youth con
ferences which are open to them all over Eu
rope this summer—at Oslo, Prague, and Swit
zerland—and the opportunities offered by the
youth hostels in every foreign region. (Many
students are already hopeful of going, with
out the stimulant of ready information and the
company of dther Stanford students.)
Further and somewhat separately —let us
set up an agency which specializes in com
piling information about jobs oveiseas—
where they are available, what tidining is ne
cessary, what work needs to be done. The
students who have already been abroad can
directly contribute what they learned about
job opportunities to this agency. What a force
ful counter-siimulant to provincialism would
result, if students were planning their courses
for lives and careers abroad.
Let us also set up an agency which will
supply the potential "international" student
with information about what universities are
open to him abroad—telling us about ex
change scholarships, courses offered, possi
bilities for housing.
I.S.C. committeemen already know the ropes
about getting passports, and boat reservations,
and similar necessities. Their aid in these
ways could be extended to all students who
desire it—and be assured that interest would
zoom 50 per cent higher, if the prospective
Stanford worker, traveler or student abroad
knew there was one place, readily accessible,
where he could receive assistance in getting
where he considers going.
These suggestions could easily be carried
out, but unless backed up, more fully, would
fall on their likeable faces. Machinery for such
a project must and will be outlined by the
Daily. We will further propose a co-ordination
of activities and the classroom to serve the
present purpose—to further international un

Med and applauded, and then we watched.
Ciaduully it became ipparent that loi this
/(.. r, lit least, the benelits oi the Survey would
; reshictud to the hypothetical three selected
i:u!or its travel progiam. We decided maybe
a year's wait would be too long an interim
irom wai to awake any student action as a
result of the travelers' reports. We became
that Excom must do much more,
to insure the success of its program.
Students going abroad, independently or
under the Survey, would have to have some
thing more concrete, of more sustaining in
t' rest to the student body, to do overseas than
"study economic and political conditions" for
reports to the student body. They must be
given definite and 112 ulf illable assignments,
taking into account what prospective listeners
at Stanford will want and be able to act upon.
The Reader's Digest can supply us informa
tion probably far more accurately than can a
student observer on economic and political
conditions of foreign countries. Stanford sur
vey students should instead find out what stu
dents and the man-on-the-foreign-street thinks
about America and its policies, what they
think we students can do to give them hope,
what universities are open and what jobs are
available abroad for us students at home.
These are considerations which come within
the common understanding of students and
average citizens at Stanford as well as in many
countries overseas.
(We suggest parenthetically however that
Spain, Greece, and Palestine, in their present
situations without normal universitv life, will

be ideally unsuited to yielding any basis lor
such understanding to a Stanford student on a
six-week tour. Yet these are three out of the
four countries which the I.S.C. itinerary com
mittee is considering for Stanford travelers.)
If the students at Stanford recognize the
value of visiting in foreign countries, then let
us realistically encourage it, by extending the
possibility of such visits to more than the three
selected under the I.S.C. Let us publicize,
through the 1.5.C., the student and youth con
ferences which are open to them all over Eu
rope this summer—at Oslo, Prague, and Swit
zerland—and the opportunities offered by the
youth hostels in every foreign region. (Many
students are already hopeful of going, with
out the stimulant of ready information and the
company of dther Stanford students.)
Further and somewhat separately —let us
set up an agency which specializes in com
piling information about jobs oveiseas—
where they are available, what tidining is ne
cessary, what work needs to be done. The
students who have already been abroad can
directly contribute what they learned about
job opportunities to this agency. What a force
ful counter-siimulant to provincialism would
result, if students were planning their courses
for lives and careers abroad.
Let us also set up an agency which will
supply the potential "international" student
with information about what universities are
open to him abroad—telling us about ex
change scholarships, courses offered, possi
bilities for housing.
I.S.C. committeemen already know the ropes
about getting passports, and boat reservations,
and similar necessities. Their aid in these
ways could be extended to all students who
desire it—and be assured that interest would
zoom 50 per cent higher, if the prospective
Stanford worker, traveler or student abroad
knew there was one place, readily accessible,
where he could receive assistance in getting
where he considers going.
These suggestions could easily be carried
out, but unless backed up, more fully, would
fall on their likeable faces. Machinery for such
a project must and will be outlined by the
Daily. We will further propose a co-ordination
of activities and the classroom to serve the
present purpose—to further international un
derstanding.
