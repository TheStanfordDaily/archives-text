TO THE EDITOR:
We were Stanford delegates to the Chicago Con
ference. We feel there are important issues concern
ing the conference, that thus far have not been
brought to your attention. One, Excom was not suf
ficiently interested in the conference to elect Stanford
delegates until less than three weeks before the con
lerence opened. Two. insufficient interest resulted in
the complete financings of only one delegate. Three,
no information was. given us as to what we were to
expect there, the.opinions we were to reflect in our
voting, or specific information as to what we were
lo bring back to Stanford students.
In order to fulfill our obligations to you, as two
of your representatives to Chicago, we would like
to explain some of the circumstance.*surrounding our
election as Stanford delegates, and to clarify in your
minds the answers to questions concerning the con
ference that you have rightfully been asking.
The first |Konphlet of organized information con
cerning (he conference which outlines its back
ground, purpose, and mechanics was received by
Excom the first week in November. At the last
meeting of Kxcom before the end of fall quarter
within three weeks of the conference, delegates
were elected to represent Stanford at Chicago. That
was nil. The perfunctory election of delegates at
the last Excom meeting of fall quarter seemed to
indicate that the conference was secondary in im
portance. Without financial assistance from Excom.
we arrived at Chicago to represent you feeling that
we didn ( represent cither you or your student
government, hut merely a few individuals who had
contacted us personally to express their interest in
the conference.
There is no doubt in our minds that had Stanford
students been informed on the conference enough to
elicit interest from them concerning it. they would
have demanded a detailed report from the delegates
lung before this. We point this out because we be
lieve a serious mistake was made. Stanford will con
tinue to participate in national student affairs in name
only, unless students will participate actively and
critically in the government they have chosen tt>
manage their affairs.
Exactly why was the Chicago Conference called?
Upon return from Prague last summer, the 25 Amer
ican delegates expressed the feeling that, nationally
and internationally, the horizons of American stu
dents were limited by the boundaries of each campus.
A strong, truly representative, national student or
ganization seemed to be the solution. Such a central
organization would be a cohesive force on all Ameri
can campuses; it would be a mouthpiece of over
2.000.000 American students, through which unified
action could be taken on student problems; it would
achieve a more effective participation of American
students with organized students abroad.

Exactly what was the purpose of the conference?
It should he clearly understood that the function of
the Chicago Conference was to take the initial step
in the formation of a national student organization.
Resolutions passed there are ground work for the
prospective organization and are subject to ap
proval. disapproval, or modification by the first
constitutional congress next summer. When that
congress convenes, and only then, will the national
student organization be a reality.
What will the N.S.O. do for you in Lagunita, and
you in Toyon, and you at the Village? To specifically
state the aims and purposes of the N.S.O. would con
stitute another article, in itself. However, they con
cern problems pertinent to students and with which
we are intimately acquainted.
On a national scale, the resolutions passed were
relative to improved curricula, better functioning of
student government, economic needs of students, stu
dent exchange and travel, student cultural co-opera
tion, and student sports.
Internationally, the resolutions were as follows:
that the N.S.O. make the greatest possible Ameri
can contribution to students throughout the world,
thai the N.S.O. favor all means of extending two
way student exchanges, that the N.S.O. recognize
the value of complete as possible information on all
activity in tin* student sphere, that the N.S.O. favor
the principle of need alone as the basis of distribu
liori'of relief, that the N.S.O. favor the principle of
increasing the number of scholarships given to for
eign students by American universities. Plans for
implementation of these general arms is specifically
outlined in eleven sub-topics passed by Panel 111.
I hi' resolutions passed by the four panels will be
presented to you, word lor word, as soon as possible.
I' irst, examine them critically and thoroughly, espe
cially those of Panels 111 and IV which deal speci
fically with the national and international aims of
the N.S.O.
A number of plans may be presented to you for
an organization that will co-ordinate student activi
ties working for international understanding. Sec
ondly, give your active support to the plan providing
tor an organization truly representative of the Stan
ford campus, one that will allow every student a
maximum of participation.
Thirdly, if you feel, after becoming thoroughly
acquainted with every aspect of the prospective
N. 5.0., that Stanford should affiliate with it, de
mand that we do so. Follow up jour demand with
suggestions and constructive criticism of all subse
quent developments.
The Chicago Conference was one of the most won
derful experiences in which we will ever be fortu
nate enough to participate. Students from Harvard,
Texas, Georgetown, and many other campuses were
extremely well informed, and had definite proposals
in mind which they presented in an outstanding man
ner. It would have been very encouraging to any
one who is in the least bit apprehensive about pres
ent-day student's capabilities. We think it will be
a tragedy, all the consequences of which will not be
evident now, if Stanford students don't back the
N.S.O. 'What do you think?— Marilyn Sidwell and
Nancy Alden.

Exactly why was the Chicago Conference called?
Upon return from Prague last summer, the 25 Amer
ican delegates expressed the feeling that, nationally
and internationally, the horizons of American stu
dents were limited by the boundaries of each campus.
A strong, truly representative, national student or
ganization seemed to be the solution. Such a central
organization would be a cohesive force on all Ameri
can campuses; it would be a mouthpiece of over
2.000.000 American students, through which unified
action could be taken on student problems; it would
achieve a more effective participation of American
students with organized students abroad.

Exactly what was the purpose of the conference?
It should he clearly understood that the function of
the Chicago Conference was to take the initial step
in the formation of a national student organization.
Resolutions passed there are ground work for the
prospective organization and are subject to ap
proval. disapproval, or modification by the first
constitutional congress next summer. When that
congress convenes, and only then, will the national
student organization be a reality.
What will the N.S.O. do for you in Lagunita, and
you in Toyon, and you at the Village? To specifically
state the aims and purposes of the N.S.O. would con
stitute another article, in itself. However, they con
cern problems pertinent to students and with which
we are intimately acquainted.
On a national scale, the resolutions passed were
relative to improved curricula, better functioning of
student government, economic needs of students, stu
dent exchange and travel, student cultural co-opera
tion, and student sports.
Internationally, the resolutions were as follows:
that the N.S.O. make the greatest possible Ameri
can contribution to students throughout the world,
thai the N.S.O. favor all means of extending two
way student exchanges, that the N.S.O. recognize
the value of complete as possible information on all
activity in tin* student sphere, that the N.S.O. favor
the principle of need alone as the basis of distribu
liori'of relief, that the N.S.O. favor the principle of
increasing the number of scholarships given to for
eign students by American universities. Plans for
implementation of these general arms is specifically
outlined in eleven sub-topics passed by Panel 111.
I hi' resolutions passed by the four panels will be
presented to you, word lor word, as soon as possible.
I' irst, examine them critically and thoroughly, espe
cially those of Panels 111 and IV which deal speci
fically with the national and international aims of
the N.S.O.
A number of plans may be presented to you for
an organization that will co-ordinate student activi
ties working for international understanding. Sec

The Chicago Conference was one of the most won

extremely well informed, and had definite proposals

TO THE EDITOR:
We were Stanford delegates to the Chicago Con
ference. We feel there are important issues concern
ing the conference, that thus far have not been
brought to your attention. One, Excom was not suf
ficiently interested in the conference to elect Stanford
delegates until less than three weeks before the con
lerence opened. Two. insufficient interest resulted in
the complete financings of only one delegate. Three,
no information was. given us as to what we were to
expect there, the.opinions we were to reflect in our
voting, or specific information as to what we were
lo bring back to Stanford students.
In order to fulfill our obligations to you, as two
of your representatives to Chicago, we would like
to explain some of the circumstance.*surrounding our
election as Stanford delegates, and to clarify in your
minds the answers to questions concerning the con
ference that you have rightfully been asking.
The first |Konphlet of organized information con
cerning (he conference which outlines its back
ground, purpose, and mechanics was received by
Excom the first week in November. At the last
meeting of Kxcom before the end of fall quarter
within three weeks of the conference, delegates
were elected to represent Stanford at Chicago. That
was nil. The perfunctory election of delegates at
the last Excom meeting of fall quarter seemed to
indicate that the conference was secondary in im
portance. Without financial assistance from Excom.
we arrived at Chicago to represent you feeling that
we didn ( represent cither you or your student
government, hut merely a few individuals who had
contacted us personally to express their interest in
the conference.
There is no doubt in our minds that had Stanford
students been informed on the conference enough to
elicit interest from them concerning it. they would
have demanded a detailed report from the delegates
lung before this. We point this out because we be
lieve a serious mistake was made. Stanford will con
tinue to participate in national student affairs in name
only, unless students will participate actively and
critically in the government they have chosen tt>
manage their affairs.
Exactly why was the Chicago Conference called?
Upon return from Prague last summer, the 25 Amer
ican delegates expressed the feeling that, nationally
and internationally, the horizons of American stu
dents were limited by the boundaries of each campus.
A strong, truly representative, national student or
ganization seemed to be the solution. Such a central
organization would be a cohesive force on all Ameri
can campuses; it would be a mouthpiece of over
2.000.000 American students, through which unified
action could be taken on student problems; it would
achieve a more effective participation of American
students with organized students abroad.

Exactly what was the purpose of the conference?
It should he clearly understood that the function of
the Chicago Conference was to take the initial step
in the formation of a national student organization.
Resolutions passed there are ground work for the
prospective organization and are subject to ap
proval. disapproval, or modification by the first
constitutional congress next summer. When that
congress convenes, and only then, will the national
student organization be a reality.
What will the N.S.O. do for you in Lagunita, and
you in Toyon, and you at the Village? To specifically
state the aims and purposes of the N.S.O. would con
stitute another article, in itself. However, they con
cern problems pertinent to students and with which
we are intimately acquainted.
On a national scale, the resolutions passed were
relative to improved curricula, better functioning of
student government, economic needs of students, stu
dent exchange and travel, student cultural co-opera
tion, and student sports.
Internationally, the resolutions were as follows:
that the N.S.O. make the greatest possible Ameri
can contribution to students throughout the world,
thai the N.S.O. favor all means of extending two
way student exchanges, that the N.S.O. recognize
the value of complete as possible information on all
activity in tin* student sphere, that the N.S.O. favor
the principle of need alone as the basis of distribu
