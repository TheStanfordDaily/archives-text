# Campaign Launched For 'March of Dimes'
## 
### 
The annual March of Dimes cam
paign was officially launched in Palo
Alto Wednesday with a Chamber of
Commerce luncheon at which Dr.
Edward Listen spoke on the medical
point of view on the drive.
The March of Dimes is the annual
fund-raising effort of the National

I Foundation for Infantile Paralysis
I which allocates funds to research on
j polio and aid of its victims. The
drive was originally started by Pres
! ident Roosevelt, and during his life- i
[ time culminated on his birthday, j
January 30, with a dance in Wash
ington, D.C.
At Stanford the Student Organi
zation Fund has already made a
contribution to the local drive.
This money was obtained from the
Four Feathers drive held last fall.
Although Stanford students have
already contributed in this way,
they are urged to give more, even
though there will be no formal
campaign on campus.
The March of Dimes supplies the
funds which have financed the ex
periments of Dr. Hubert S. Loring !
and Dr. C. E. Schwerdt, Stanford j
scientists, who recently announced I
that they believe they have success- |
! fully isolated nearly pure polio virus, j
Other experiments in polio are
also going on at Stanfordâ€”Dr.
llaroid Faber at the Stanford llos
j pital and Miss Lucille Daniels,
i physical therapist, who is working '
at Stanford Village. These people
have all been aided by the Na
tional Foundation for Infantile
Paralysis.
Cans for contributions and posters j
have been put out in Palo Alto, and j
j collections will be made at the the
t atres. The Chamber of Commerce
I in Palo Alto also urges students to j
! send checks made out to the March
| of Dimes.
