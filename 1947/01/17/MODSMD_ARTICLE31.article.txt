If Ignorance Is Bliss, Ol<l liy Dan b.tnlsl(-y
Sjjt. Is Vi ell mistered

Tonight Coach Everett Dean's boys make their local Conference debut,
up ;it Burglary; tomorrow night a scattering of the student body can see
right here on the Farm—in the out-moded, pitifully small Pavilion.
II any of you tried to get a ticket you know what I mean—and I know for
a fact that distribution was painfully fair.
Hut that's not the point of interest, today; the team holds the spot
light. The practice season was so-so, and the road trip was disastrous—
hut the hoopsters surprised iiil of Suckers' Paradise (Los Angeles to
you) hv thumping the Bruins of Westwood in the first game, and alnackst
winning (he second. I
All who know the slightest thing about the cage sport have unanimously
relegated the Cards to the basement; they've been picked to run about
fifth in a four-team race. Nobody, to my knowledge, has had the temerity
to say for publication that they'd so much as win a single game —but they
did it, the very first time out.
Knowing as little ahout basketball as 1 do about football, I have the
courage of the ignorant; 1 say the Farmhands are going to win AT
LEAST one game from Cal before the end of this season. It could well
he Saturday night. Don't pity me; I'm happy.
Notice, 1 said SATURDAY night. If you have a pair of pasteboards
and are taking vour best girl up to Burglary lor the sole purpose of letting
lior watch the California Bears get whipped—best you should stay in bed,
or study, or something equally 'volting: it ain t gonna happen.
Why do you suppose I've been calling that town Burglary.' Ev<sry time

you go up there you have to put a padlock on your mouth unless, of
course, you hold your gold fillings in small esteem. Go up there, to watch
a good game—and the California rooting section—but don't go expecting
to win. (Watching that rooting section is better than going to the zoo;
they throw things, boo the referee, and scream filthy insults at their
visitors. 1 went up there once, and I think 1 deserve a battle star -or the
Order of the Purple Eye.)
Don't Throw Peanuts to the Monkeys
Leave us be reasonable. Experts agree that on the average, over a
period of years, playing on the home floor is worth from 6 to 10 points
to a team; to the Berkeley Beagles it means AT LEAST the maximum.
That rooting section is so rabid, so vociferous, so insulting, so downright
nasty that the basketball officials tell their offspring that if they're not
good, obedient children they'll go to Berkeley when they die. S a fact.
Naturally you've noticed that Cal took the powerful Trojans into
camp twice; probably you didn't notice that in both games there was a
difference of less than 10 points. 1 think the scores would have been
reversed had the games been played in the Southland.
Not only is the average official intimidated by the loud-mouthed
rooting section; visiting players are booed when they make a good shot,
and greeted with jeers and catcalls when they make a bad. Every l'oul
called on the home team is greeted with thunderous indignation; every
thing possible is done to distract the attention of the opponent trying to
make the l'oul shot. Only a most extraordinary young man can play up to
his usual standard under such circumstances.

Juvenile Deliiiueney It's a ( rime
The mass juvenile actions of the Cal rooters could be stopped, if the
administration of that University took any interest in the matter. Ap
parently it doesn't or perhaps such actions are looked upon benevolently,
as mere "high spirits." They act like they're carrying plenty of spirits, all
right—they're high—but that's the closest parallel 1 can discover. The
students of the University of California are all young men and young
women; I'm old-fashioned enough to think they should act as such.
As 1 sav. this mass dementia could he stopped—hut there is no sii;n
that it will he. Time after time throughout the past years His Nibs Price
has jumped off the bench to start a beef with the referee or umpire.
Often President Robert Gordon Sproul has been sitting there with him.
Never has he protested, by wortl or action—at least, not in public. That
such conduct continues is prima facie evidence that he approves. In the
face of this implicit approval, the didoes of the rooters are not surprising.
Some officials— those with a little guts—are not intimidated. I'm think
ing especially of Lloyd Leith, who recently, after a foul, told the offended
player to keep shooting until the rooters simmered down. But courageous
officials are not admired up there; at any rate, some recognizedly capable
whistle-tooters have not been invited to return. If Lloyd continues to be
"unreasonable,"' it could happen to him.
Old Sgt. Slinger. I'm afraid, would he blacklisted for life, were he
to officiate a game up there. With his Irish temper, I fear he'd call
technical fouls for about 2(1 successive minutes, until the rooters shut
their big collective vap.

*" l lir KelVm' s a INaslv INanir —**
Such an event happened in Texas, some time ago. (They get rubid
clown there, too.) Right after the tip-off one of the home players fouled
an oppone nt, and when the referee tooted his whistle he was booed to the
rafters. Being a rather spunky eharacter. he told the boy who was fouled
j to keep on shooting; the fellow dropped in half a dozen points before the
spectators wised up and shut up.
Tlx- next night the very same tiling happened; a home-team player
fouled an opponent right after the tip-off. Right on the job, the ref tooted
his whistle and set the ball down oil the foul line. 11 the silence wasn't
golden, it at least was gilt-edged; some eharacter dropped a pin, and every
body present heard it. Thunderstruck, the referee looked up at the crowd.
Every mouth was clamped tightly shut but each fan was holding a plae
j ard which spelled—in large black letters BOO! A poor referee can t
win.
I'm probably naive, of course, but I've always regarded an athletic
! contest as a test of strength and skill—not a battle between rooting
sections to decide who have the loudest mouths, the largest tonsils, the
i filthiest vocabularies.
That's why 1 say Stanford is not going to win the game tonight; the
j boys would have to be 15 points better than the Bears on a neutral floor
i to be able to turn that trick. So go on up there, you ticket-holders. Enjoy
j some good basketball, observe the antics of the State College Simians, and
cheer the locals a bit- but don't expect to be heard above the din of the
5.000-vice Berkeley Mixed Chorus. And don't expect to win; it's an even
bet for Saturday night, but tonight there isn't a chance.
