# First Signs of Spring-Baseballs My on Farm
## 
### ART LEVINSON 
According to Hoyle, the time of
the year to play baseball is in the
spring and summer, when you can
dofl' your five winter sweaters, sit
back in the bleachers, and enjoy nine
innings of America's national pas
time.
But since baseball talent isn't in
herited, nor is it plucked off pine
trees, it's necessary for enterprising
young players to start playing the
game when the wind blows hard and
the frost bites chunky bits out of
your tender skin.
And that is exactly what Harry
Wolter, the veteran Stanford coach,
is making his proteges do every af
ternoon. Running, hitting, batting,
and fielding is the standing order.
In several weeks, Harry will pare
his 75-man squad down to a work
ing number, divide the best and the
next best, which will be called the
varsity and the junior varsity, and
start preparing for the conference
race.
WOLTER HAS WINNER
There's a pleasant smile on Wol
ter's face as he directs his men daily.
"1 haven't seen so much good talent
in a long time," chortles the old-time
major league player. "There's go
ing to be plenty of power with the
bats, my fielders aren't going to muff,
and the pitchers will do okay," he
adds. That sort of arithmetic adds
up to a winning team, and we have

| an idea that's exactly what Harry
means.
Lloyd Merriman. Mr. Stanford
I Football, is out on the diamond
; swatting the ball like he did last
, season. Frank McGraw, the 400-
plus catcher, is around. Wayne
Erickson, eeling left halfback, is
trying for the second-base post. Ted
Nell, a classy third baseman, is play
| ing in the Sunken Diamond. Dic'.c
Flat land and Larry Wolfe, last sca
! son's (lingers, are getting in shape.
HARRY PLAYED FOR BRONCS
Yes—things look bright for Harry
Wolter, who played baseball for
Santa Clara in 1905 and 190G when
the great J. W. Lanagan was pitching
j for Stanford. When "Stump" Stott
( was quarterbacking the football
; team and playing a flashy brand of
| baseball, too. When Norman Dole
set a new record for the pole vault
' by clearing the bars at 12 feet 3 1-4
; inches. And when Dan Murphy was
! turning out crews on Lake Lagunita
that went to the Poughkeepsie re
; gatta.
The great earthquake shook Harry
J out of school, and he started playing
professional baseball. Rest was an
! unheard of thing in those days, and
when Wolters wasn't pitching, he'd
• be playing in the outfield. Eventu
| ally Harry went up to the majors,
1 playing with the old New York Yan
kees.
A broken leg cut his playing days
short in 1922, and he's been at Stan

ford ever since. Some years have
been good, and others not quite so
good, but outstanding individuals
develop every year. His brightest
j pupil is undoubtedly Bobby Brown,
i the Newark shortstop who batted
j second to Jackie Robinson in the
j International League last season.
This season Brown, who played on
1 the Farm in '42, goes up to the Yan
j kees.
Someone said the other day that
i out of 75 candidates for baseball,
some likely prospect might be over
j looked in the scramble to get things
going, but when you have a man
who's been at the game for 45 years
i looking at that talent, and when that
man's name is Harry Wolter, the an
! swer to that remark is a definite
! 'nope.'

HARRY PLAYED FOR BRONCS
Yes—things look bright for Harry
Wolter, who played baseball for
Santa Clara in 1905 and 190G when
the great J. W. Lanagan was pitching
j for Stanford. When "Stump" Stott
( was quarterbacking the football
; team and playing a flashy brand of
| baseball, too. When Norman Dole
set a new record for the pole vault
' by clearing the bars at 12 feet 3 1-4
; inches. And when Dan Murphy was
! turning out crews on Lake Lagunita
that went to the Poughkeepsie re
; gatta.
The great earthquake shook Harry
J out of school, and he started playing
professional baseball. Rest was an
! unheard of thing in those days, and
when Wolters wasn't pitching, he'd
• be playing in the outfield. Eventu
| ally Harry went up to the majors,
1 playing with the old New York Yan
kees.
A broken leg cut his playing days
short in 1922, and he's been at Stan

ford ever since. Some years have
been good, and others not quite so
good, but outstanding individuals
develop every year. His brightest
j pupil is undoubtedly Bobby Brown,
i the Newark shortstop who batted
j second to Jackie Robinson in the
j International League last season.
This season Brown, who played on
1 the Farm in '42, goes up to the Yan
j kees.
Someone said the other day that
i out of 75 candidates for baseball,
some likely prospect might be over
j looked in the scramble to get things
going, but when you have a man
who's been at the game for 45 years
i looking at that talent, and when that
man's name is Harry Wolter, the an

HARRY WOLTER
Farm Baseball Coach ,
According to Hoyle, the time of
the year to play baseball is in the
spring and summer, when you can
dofl' your five winter sweaters, sit
back in the bleachers, and enjoy nine
innings of America's national pas
time.
But since baseball talent isn't in
herited, nor is it plucked off pine
trees, it's necessary for enterprising
young players to start playing the
game when the wind blows hard and
the frost bites chunky bits out of
your tender skin.
And that is exactly what Harry
Wolter, the veteran Stanford coach,
is making his proteges do every af
ternoon. Running, hitting, batting,
and fielding is the standing order.
In several weeks, Harry will pare
his 75-man squad down to a work
ing number, divide the best and the
next best, which will be called the
varsity and the junior varsity, and
start preparing for the conference
race.
