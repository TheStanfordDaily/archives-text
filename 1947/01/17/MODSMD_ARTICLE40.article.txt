# Communism and Christianity Choices Of War-Battered Students, Says Maury
##

By BILL HORNBY
War-battered students pinned to the wreckage of old values and beliefs must choose today
between Christianity and Communism as the only creative forces alive in Europe.
This is the conviction of Philippe Maury, who earned the right to express it by years of
fighting and thinking against the forces which smashed the Europe of his boyhood.

SPEAKS FOR Y.W.C.A.
Maury, secretary of the World Student Christian Federation, spoke
yesterday to 50 Stanfordites at a meeting sponsored by the Y.W.C.A. World
Student Affairs Committee, directed by Janet Vester.
Ignoring his own dramatic tight with the Gestapo to win tho minds of
Frenchmen as a Resistance editor, Maury sought to bring the tragedies
of his native France home to an audience enjoying four-o'clock tea and
cookies in the Women's Clubhouse.

He spoke first as a Frenchman
who had seen blind faith in words
such as "liberty," justice," and
"freedom" prove poor weapons
against invaders. "The old liberal
concept of the world is certainly
dead."
He spoke also as a student who
had watched Communism draw in
creasing numbers of his disillu
sioned followers. "Communism is a
new religion for many." It brings
faith while demanding organization
and rigid discipline.
COMMUNISM FINDS BUYERS
Communist emphasis on action,
material benefits, and upon science
as the ultimate reality, is finding
buyers, Maury admits.
However, its emphasis on individ
ual worth and on God as the ulti
mate reality can swing the major
creative role in the new Europe to
Christianity. This "will happen if
the latter attacks human problems
with organization and discipline.
TWENTY PER CENT
In Europe, as in America, Maury
admits, only 20 per cent of any stu
dent body think about the new
world community or realize student
obligations to it.
What can the American, the Stan
ford 20 per cent do?
HIS PROGRAM
Maury's program includes:
Relief organization and contribu
tions which are an active way of
proving world citizenship and
Christian fellowship. "But I will not
make an appeal; awakening to re
sponsibility comes from within."
Travel by students who will learn
by living with, not looking at, for
eign peoples.
Realization that pessimism and
disillusion allowed to exist abroad
can blast future hopes for cookie
munching Americans as it has for
ex-cookie-munchers in the many
countries Maury knows well.
