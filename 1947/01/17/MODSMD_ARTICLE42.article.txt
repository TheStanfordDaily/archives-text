LONDON, Jan. 16 (UP).—Win
.ston Churchill formally opened his
campaign for a United States of
Europe today.
A spokesman announced the for
mation of a British provisional com
mittee of "men of good will" who
subscribe to the belief that "if
Europe is to survive, it must unite."
Churchill is chairman. The other
22 members of the committee in
clude some of the most prominent
spiritual, intellectual and political
leaders in Britain.
"This movement is not aimed
against anyone," the committee's
spokesman said. "It is not anti-So
viet or anti-American or a British
political move for power.
At the same time, ho made it clear
that the committee does not expect
Russia to have anything to do with
a United Europe.
"We hope that the Soviet will be
a sympathetic, helpful, friendly
neighbor which will see no difficulty
in a group coming together on its
borders," he said.
When Churchill appealed for a
United States of Europe in Zurich,
Switzerland, last Sept. 19 — with
France and its ancient enemy, Ger
many, taking the lead in forming it
—the Russian propaganda machine
immediately attacked Churchill. It
said the general idea of his scheme
was "restoration of a powerful and
reactionary Germany, which in co
operation with France should be
come the kernel for the new Eu
rope. . .
