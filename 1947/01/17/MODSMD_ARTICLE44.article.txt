# Farm French Club Organized
## 
### 
The newly organized French
Club, open to anyone interested in
speaking French, held its first meet
ing this week. Since no French
conversational courses are being of
fered this quarter, the club offers
an opportunity to accustom the ear
to the language, to acquire fluency
in speech, and to overcome the be
ginner's usual hesitancy in conver
sation.
To assure actual progress, meet
ings will be conducted entirely in
French and will take place every
Tuesday afternoon at 4:15 in the
lower lounge of the Women's Club
house. Guest speakers, French rec
ord programs, community sings, and
correspondence between members
and students in France have been
tentatively planned. If possible the
club will present French motion
picture programs open to the pub
lic.
Chairman Nancy Smith urges all
those interested, and especially be
ginners, to attend the next meeting
Tuesday afternoon, Jan. 21, at 4:15.
