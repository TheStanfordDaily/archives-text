# Sales Termed 'Extremely Satisfactory' For New Journal, 'Pacific Spectator'
## 
### 
The retail sales of The Pacific Spectator, published by the Stanford University Press, were
termed "extremely satisfactory," by L. C. Ott of the Press. "With a "publication of only 5,000
issues, we are still filling demands from San Francisco stores and bookstores," he said. Limited
facilities prevented the Press from priniting more copies.
The journal, in succeeding issues, will havewidespread demand especially in the Pacific
Coast and in the Rocky Mountain region. It is a significant development in publishing because

it. was effected through the combined efforts of 21 colleges, and because it
was the only one- of its kind on the Pacific Coast, according 1o Ott.
It fills ;i need and is a break from the nucleus of the publishing world
which exists in New York," he said.
Behind the publication of the first issue lay several years of planning,
oiganization and work to bring forth a journal with a wide perspective of
literature, sociological and economical problems and of world affairs. It.
was created in embryonic form by John VV. Dodds. Dean of the School of

~ J "
Humanities, and the Pacific Commit
tee for Humanities.
This committee is a branch of the
American Council of Learned Soci
eties, according to the journal's edi
tor, Miss Edith Mirrielees, formerly
an English professor at Stanford.
The next issue of the quarterly
publication, to appear on April 15
will contain many articles upon cur
rent affairs and problems confront
ing the world. Such authors as Ber
nard De Voto. Eugene Stanley, and
Oscar Lewis will be included, as well
as an article by Wallace Stegner:
"Tradition .and the Skeptic."
