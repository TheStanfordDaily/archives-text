idents of Toyon Hall, today present- !
ed to Dean of Students John M. '
Stalnaker a letter protesting the
search made by University authori- i
ties of Toyon rooms during Christ- |
nias vacation.
The letter, signed by Frank J. j
Creede, Fred Struck, Ernest G. Mas
ler, and Donald J. Corr, members of |
the Toyon Cabinet, stated that the |
search was contrary to the laws of I
California, 'he A.S.S.U. constitution, j
and the Fundamental Standard.
LIQUOR FOUND
The search, made by campus po- |
lice in the absence of the students j
living in Toyon, revealed several vi
olations of University rules. Fire- j
arms and liquor found were confis- j
cated by the campus officers.
Regarding the violations disclosed. |
the Toyon Club letter said ''we feel !
that the outcome of this search re- j
suited from inadequate dissemina- j
tion of existing rules and regula- j
tions," and promised that the Cabi- j
net would advise Toyon men as to ;
the rules. The letter concluded with {
the hope that the protest would be \
interpreted in a constructive spirit. I
PRESIDENT PROTESTS
Creede, president of Toyon Club, |
said that he wished to emphasize
that the protest was not an attempt I
to protect the individuals who might |
be subject to punishment for the vi- i
olations disclosed. "Regardless of j
the immediate situation," he said, i
"we only wish to point out that the I
administration has no right to go
uough our desk drawers and per- j
al belongings."
•ying that he had been asked by
'■or of students to look into t
ality of the University's j
•; and seizures," Stan Shpet- j
•on resident and member of j
mcii a Council, staled that he had!
consulted competent legal advice
and that, in his opinion, "the search
of the rooms was contrary to the law i
of the State of California."
FARM UNDEIt STATE LAWS?
"The question has been raised," |
Shpetner said, "as to whether the
University is bound to obey the laws j
of the state. That can best be an
swered by each student for himself. :
ft involves the issue of whether an
individual coming to Stanford must
—in order to continue his education
—surrender all his legal rights."
Shpetner then pointed out that the
administration should observe at j
least the laws to which they them
selves have agreed. He quoted Ar
ticle X of the A.S.S.U. Constitution:
"The University on its part manifests
its confidence in the honor of its j
students by refraining from proctor
ing examinations or otherwise tak- :
ing special steps to prevent the forms j
of dishonesty mentioned above."
Emphasizing that, in his judicial
capacity, he could not make any
statement on the individual cases
that might come before Men's Coun- j
oil, Shpetner said that he hoped this
would answer the questions that had !
been put to him.

idents of Toyon Hall, today present- !
ed to Dean of Students John M. '
Stalnaker a letter protesting the
search made by University authori- i
ties of Toyon rooms during Christ- |
nias vacation.
The letter, signed by Frank J. j
Creede, Fred Struck, Ernest G. Mas
ler, and Donald J. Corr, members of |
the Toyon Cabinet, stated that the |
search was contrary to the laws of I
California, 'he A.S.S.U. constitution, j
and the Fundamental Standard.
LIQUOR FOUND
The search, made by campus po- |
lice in the absence of the students j
living in Toyon, revealed several vi
olations of University rules. Fire- j
arms and liquor found were confis- j
cated by the campus officers.
Regarding the violations disclosed. |
the Toyon Club letter said ''we feel !
that the outcome of this search re- j
suited from inadequate dissemina- j
tion of existing rules and regula- j
tions," and promised that the Cabi- j
net would advise Toyon men as to ;
the rules. The letter concluded with {
the hope that the protest would be \
interpreted in a constructive spirit. I
PRESIDENT PROTESTS
Creede, president of Toyon Club, |
said that he wished to emphasize
that the protest was not an attempt I
to protect the individuals who might |
be subject to punishment for the vi- i
olations disclosed. "Regardless of j
the immediate situation," he said, i
"we only wish to point out that the I
administration has no right to go
uough our desk drawers and per- j
al belongings."
•ying that he had been asked by
'■or of students to look into t
ality of the University's j
•; and seizures," Stan Shpet- j
•on resident and member of j
mcii a Council, staled that he had!
consulted competent legal advice
and that, in his opinion, "the search
of the rooms was contrary to the law i
of the State of California."
FARM UNDEIt STATE LAWS?
"The question has been raised," |
Shpetner said, "as to whether the
University is bound to obey the laws j
of the state. That can best be an
swered by each student for himself. :
ft involves the issue of whether an
individual coming to Stanford must
—in order to continue his education
—surrender all his legal rights."
Shpetner then pointed out that the
administration should observe at j
least the laws to which they them
selves have agreed. He quoted Ar
ticle X of the A.S.S.U. Constitution:
"The University on its part manifests
its confidence in the honor of its j
students by refraining from proctor
ing examinations or otherwise tak- :
ing special steps to prevent the forms j
of dishonesty mentioned above."
Emphasizing that, in his judicial
capacity, he could not make any
statement on the individual cases
that might come before Men's Coun- j
oil, Shpetner said that he hoped this
would answer the questions that had !
been put to him.
