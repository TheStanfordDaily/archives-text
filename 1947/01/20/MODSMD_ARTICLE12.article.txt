## 
### 
The story of the California
Condor, rarest and biggest fly
ing bird in the world, will be
â€¢ told in an illustrated lecture to
be presented tomorrow night at
| 7:30 in Memorial Auditorium at
the Stanford Tuesday Evening
Series by Dr. Telford Work,
physician, ornithologist and ex
pert bird photographer.
COLORED MOVIES
His lecture, "Avian Giant of An
cient Skies," will be accompanied
J by colored motion pictures which
furnish an account of the natural
1 history during the past two years
of Dr. Work and two other Stanford
alumni, Dr. Harold M. Hill and Al
j bert J. Wool.
The colored movies were taken
i during a series of expeditions by
j the three men in the wildernss of
th Los Padres National Forest in
Southern California. Many of the
scenes of the "home life" of the
i nearly extinct condor were photo
graphed in a cave nest in the for
, est. Scientists estimate that there
| are now but 00 to 100 of these birds
j left, in existence.
Dr. Work entered Stanford in
1938. He completed the last two
| years of his medical course under
the Navy V-12 program and re
ceived his medical degree in 1946.
HIS BOOK PUBLISHED
While an undergraduate, he and
Mr. Wool carried on original re
| search on the nest life of the tur
i key vulture. They published their
! findings in a book which was re
j ceived with favor by ornithologists
j and led to their study of the largest
| of all vultures, the California .Con
i dor.
