TACKLE WORLD PROBLEMS
The purpose of the Institute, con
] sLsting of several days of lectures
j and discussions by prominent phys
; icists, political scientists, and for
eign observers on campus, would be
to provide a definite program for
"education, inspiration, and respon
sibility for action in international
relations" for students.
The institute, which would be
modeled after the successful three
day meeting at Reed College, Port
i land, last yerfr, would tackle such
j subjects as Russo-American rela
tions, the U.N.. the causes of war,
i nationalism, atomic power, geo
; economy, and related topics.
EXCOM TO GET PLANS
Information received from Reed
S on the details of setting up such an
; organization will be discussed at.
| the meeting. The future success of
; the Institute of International Rela
j tions will depend on the interest
' shown tonight, Miss Pond said,
j Stanford Chaplain George Hall,
I Miss Pat Davidson, campus "Y" di
rector, and other faculty members
will be present.
Any suggestions or additional
| proposals for beginning the Institute
! will be considered at the meeting.
! Asilomar delegates in charge of the
meeting hope to be able to present
the proposal to the A.S.S.U. Execu
i tive Committee Wednesday.
