# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Stanford Internationale 
### 
In two preceding editorials, The Daily prom
ised to present to the campus, to Excom, and
to student activity groups its proposal for ex
pansion of the International Survey Committee.
This plan calls for an organization that would
be of more direct interest and benefit to a
greater number of Stanford students than the
"hypothetical three" currently slated to receive
the blessings of the program.
What The Daily attempts to present is,
Strictly, a plan. It is a plan open to many sug
gestions, much revision, and a good deal of
discussion and student support to put it into
effect. But it is a plan which, we feel, can be
come a practical working through which
lie benefits of the I.S.C, can be extended to
more students before the "hypothetical three"
set off on their six-weeks jnunt through Europe;
and through which students can iind the
means for expressing what might be called
•heir international ambitions if they aren't
imong the lucky three.
The elements of this plan die: 1) formation
of an over-all committee which would co-oidi
nate the activities of various "international"
groups on campus—such as the "Y," Interna
tional Club, language clubs, Vocom, and the
I.S.C. into a welded group where the similar
aims and purposes of these clubs could achieve
united force.
2) Addition of two subsidiary committees,
under the co-ordinating committee, which
would a) take care of the paper work towards

finding job opportunities and job contacts for
Stanford students wishing to work abroad; and
which would b) take care of paper work on
information on universities abroad—their re
guirernents, social contacts, fees, methods of
application, living conditions and other details
necessary to the American student studying
abroad.
3) Representation of these groups on the co
ordinating committee could be determined by
classification according to the functions they
serve, i.e. social ("Y," International Club); edu
cational (language clubs); and practical job
and school committees). It must be remem
bered that this is a fairly rigid classification,
that social groups serve an educational pur
pose and vice versa.
Students wanting a job or study abroad
could obtain all the necessary information right
iere on campus; could, through the informa
tion obtained tie in their classes tc fit with
reguirements of such projects; could throuqh
socially international groups and lanquage
clubs, learn something extracurricularly about
the country they plan to visit, the language,
and the people.
There, in brief, is what The Daily would like
to see as an expanded I.S.C. program. It does
not rule out the I.S.C. It rather gives force to
it, and paves the way for Stanford's greater
participation in such international student
projects as exchange scholarships, student or
ganizations, and exchange student travel.

gestions, much revision, and a good deal of
discussion and student support to put it into
effect. But it is a plan which, we feel, can be
come a practical working through which
lie benefits of the I.S.C, can be extended to
more students before the "hypothetical three"
set off on their six-weeks jnunt through Europe;
and through which students can iind the
means for expressing what might be called
•heir international ambitions if they aren't
imong the lucky three.
The elements of this plan die: 1) formation
of an over-all committee which would co-oidi
nate the activities of various "international"
groups on campus—such as the "Y," Interna
tional Club, language clubs, Vocom, and the
I.S.C. into a welded group where the similar
aims and purposes of these clubs could achieve
united force.
2) Addition of two subsidiary committees,
under the co-ordinating committee, which
would a) take care of the paper work towards

finding job opportunities and job contacts for
Stanford students wishing to work abroad; and
which would b) take care of paper work on
information on universities abroad—their re
guirernents, social contacts, fees, methods of
application, living conditions and other details
necessary to the American student studying
abroad.
3) Representation of these groups on the co
ordinating committee could be determined by
classification according to the functions they
serve, i.e. social ("Y," International Club); edu
cational (language clubs); and practical job
and school committees). It must be remem
bered that this is a fairly rigid classification,
that social groups serve an educational pur
pose and vice versa.
Students wanting a job or study abroad
could obtain all the necessary information right
iere on campus; could, through the informa
tion obtained tie in their classes tc fit with
reguirements of such projects; could throuqh
socially international groups and lanquage
clubs, learn something extracurricularly about
the country they plan to visit, the language,
and the people.
There, in brief, is what The Daily would like
to see as an expanded I.S.C. program. It does
not rule out the I.S.C. It rather gives force to
it, and paves the way for Stanford's greater
participation in such international student
projects as exchange scholarships, student or
ganizations, and exchange student travel.

In two preceding editorials, The Daily prom
ised to present to the campus, to Excom, and
to student activity groups its proposal for ex
pansion of the International Survey Committee.
This plan calls for an organization that would
be of more direct interest and benefit to a
greater number of Stanford students than the
"hypothetical three" currently slated to receive
the blessings of the program.
What The Daily attempts to present is,
Strictly, a plan. It is a plan open to many sug
gestions, much revision, and a good deal of
discussion and student support to put it into
effect. But it is a plan which, we feel, can be
