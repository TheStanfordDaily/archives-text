To the Editor:
At the next meeting of Excom a petition to make
swimming at Stanford a major sport will be pre
sented for action. It Ls our sincere hope that this
petition will be granted, both in interest to the Uni-
VL'isity and to the sport. This action is not a spur-of
the-moment idea on the part of the swimming in
terests. designed to take advantage of a sympathetic
Excom or a currently powerful team; but rather, one
which has been mulled over and talked about by
the coaches and swimmers for a number of years
and concluded to be the best possible method under
which the sport can reach its full potentialities. The
matter has been thoroughly discussed with A 1 Mas
ters, representing the S.A.C., and has his full ap
proval. In order to acquaint the student body with
the point of view of, and arguments behind, this
petition we submit the following:
1) Three schools, Yale, Michigan, and Ohio State,
have dominated collegiate swimming for the past
twenty years, mainly by virtue of the emphasis they
have placed on the sport. Swimming, probably more
than any other sport, is one which requires yeai's of
practice and participation before a swimmer can
hope to reach his peak and achieve championship
caliber. Thus by securing the best of the high school
and prep school swimmers from all over the coun
try, the three schools mentioned have been able to
maintain their leadership in the sport.
It is not hard to understand why a top high
school swimmer from the West Coast or Hawaii
would choose a university like Yale where swim
ming is a major sport, where it is recognized as
such, and where trips to all championship meets
are sanctioned, before a university such as Stan
ford where the sport is considered slightly more
important than intramural activities, and where
competition is generally limited to teams in the im
mediate area. Stanford, which had reasonably good
teams before the war. has luckily come up with a
postwar team potentially as good as any in the
countryâ€”a team composed mainly of freshmen and
sophomores. A reputation will he built in the next
two or three years; we feel that by removing the
differentiation attached to classification as a minor

sport, Stanford can enhance (hat reputation and
produce teams for a number of years that will
compare nationally with the Eastern schools.
2. Some members of the student body will argue
that by making swimming a major sport, the "Block
S" will be cheapened.- We do not feel so. In the
first place, a major-minor division in sports is not
universal. Most Eastern and Middle-Western schools
give one award for all teams representing that
school, and this method of distributing awards is
coming more and more to be accepted by all colleges
and universities. At the very least, in a school that
does recognize the division, we feel that a sport
which reaches national caliber and maintains a na
tional reputation should be awarded major standing.
Secondly, there will not be many more men awarded
blocks if swimming is made a major sport than are
now when it is a minor sport. A swimmer winning
his third "Circle S" is automatically awarded a
"Block S," and usually a man able to get a "Circle
S" his senior year was good enough to win one his
sophomore year.
II) We also feel that swimming can pay its own
way if given the chance, rather than having to be
a drain on the money obtained from football. If
the talent is good enough, people will pay to see
any sport performed. If the individual perform
ers arc some of the best in the country and the
teams are evenly matched, it should be compara
tively easy to promote swimming shows that
would draw large crowds.
In short we feel that by making swimming a
major sport at Stanford, and by giving it its proper
emphasis, thus removing the differentiation attached
to a minor sport classification, Stanford can achieve
a leadership in the sport which will last many
years. U.C.L.A. and the University of Washington
have already made a bid for Western domination by
voting it a major sport. U.S.C. and California prob
ably will soon follow. With a powerful post-war
team, and the reputation that can be built upon it,
the time is ripe for Stanford's move.
