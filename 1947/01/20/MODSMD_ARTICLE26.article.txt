i Do Stanford students realize what Bull Session
v.i iters go through in the Way of anguish, mental
torture and old joke books? Do Stanford* students
read Bull Session? Do Stanford students read?
Yesterday I was determined to find the answers
to these questions by making a canvas (the material
out of which all my clothes are made) of various
students. I picked two students at random and one
horse at Santa Anita. The horse was 10 to 1 and came
in at 20 to 12. .'
1 was sitting in the Rare Book Room of the Libc
browsing through a rare copy of the Racing Form—
it had Band-Aids over all the scratches—when a
gill across the table caught my eye (she caught it
on the second bounce and handed it back to me). I
thanked her and asked what a rare girl like herself
was doing in the Rare Book Room. She said she
was doing something she rarely did—reading—and
1 said that was novel. In fact, it was a very rare
novel—llka Chase's "In Bed We Cry" printed on
Kleenex. She also said she had her order in for
the special edition of "The Razor's Edge" printed
on a Gillette blade.
"Leave us not dally; I'm from the Daily. I'd
like to know what you think about Bull-Session."
She smiled and made a rude noise with her
mouth, which I thought very descriptive, although
unfair. After wiping my face off with a towel
it was a Cannon provided by an KOTC man—l
asked her if she <1 care to tell me why she didn't
like the column.
It stinks: Why, if it was printed on tissue paper
I d say it was tearible. I considered it a lousy pun
because I hadn't thought of it first—but she con
tinued. In tact, there isn t much I like in the whole
paper. You can take out the sports page and I'll

never miss it. You can also take out the world af
fairs, you can take out Bull-Session, you can take
out the editorials —by the way. what would you
tike to take out?"'
"You," I replied, using words of one syllable (1
have to because my tongue gets caught around my j
eye tooth and I can't see for talking).
We would've continued talking if the librarian
hadn't sneaked up behind me, put a gun in my ribs
and ordered me out. Before I left I gave the gill
my name and telephone number and told her that
if anything turned up, it would probably be her
toes.
Downstairs in the library, I found another seat
and watched the guy next to me fold the morning
Daily into a two-winged airplane. I watched the
craft do a snap-roll over the Plane Geometry books
and make a two-point landing on a blonde four
tables away.
"Whattaya think of Bull Session?" I asked as he
started to fold another Daily into a helicopter.
"I clunno the guy, but with a name like that, he
can't miss. Lookit Bull Halsey."
"No, no. I mean the column in the Daily. Row
do you like Coffee?"
"One lump of sugar, no cream," he replied with
out looking up.
"No, I mean Bill Coughlin. lie writes Bull
Session. They call him Coffee."
"Why?"
"'Cause he keeps the girls awake all night," 1
said as I ducked a newly-made B-29 taking off from
the table. However, I wasn't able to duck his right
fist which he used in retaliation for my below-the
belt paunch line.
After they release me from the hospital, I plan to I
interview all owners of convertible cars on the
pigeon problem.
