Stanford's Iloopsters May 15c Headed
For the (Cellar, Hut They'll Have Fun
Well, they didn't do it, but nobody really expected them to. The bas
ketball team, I mean. They're young and inexperiencd, and will probably
end up in the Southern Division cellar—but they'll have a lot of fun along
the way, and their Stanford rooters will have a lot of fun watching them.
And in the years to come—well, most of the boys are freshmen or
sophomores; they'll pick up as time goes on. Even this season, take it
from me, they haven't won their last game, and 1 STILL predict that
they'll hang one on Cal before all the returns are in.
They've got a lot of fight, but they have a tendency to be a bit timid
in the first part of a game. For instance, in the second halves of last week
end's games, they outpointed the Bears by a score of 48 to 46. But those
first halves!
That brings to mind an Oakland boxer of several years ago, called
Frankic Hammer. He had a penchant for getting knocked out in the
first round. He started stepping three fast cantos in the dressing room
with a sparring partner before the start of the match—and did much
better.
That may be Coach Everett Dean's answer; he could let his varsity
.starters play the last half of the preliminary match. That way, they'd be
all steamed up and ready to go in the main event. Oh, well, it's just a
suggest ion.
Swimmers, Yes, But They Ain't All Wet
Some of the swimming boys are trying hard to get their favorite avo
cation recognized as a major sport; namely. A 1 Weeden, Emmet Cashin,
and Bob Anderson. If you'll turn to the Campus Opinion column you'll
see they have a good case.
Of course there'll he a lot of opposition, as there is to anything new—
hut here are some added arguments. In the first place, so far as I can
see, there are only two bases on which some sports are classifid as major,
others as minor: tradition and money. Some games—football, baseball,
basketball, track—have been maior sports at all colleges for decades.
If the others look like paving propositions, they have a chance to make
the grade.
That sounds callously commercial, I know, but one has to face the
facts. Football supports all other sports at Stanford, to a greater or less
degree; not even basketball is entirely self-supporting. A full schedule
of participation in the others depends on how much of a load the grid
sport can carry.
Now, swimming is not an entire loss, financially speaking. There is
a great deal of interest in the sport, especially here at Stanford. The
stands at the pool will hold 2,.100 fans—almost as many as the piti
fully undersized Pavilion, it doesn't cost much to keep things going,
either; they might even manage to break even.
The Slinjjer IMan, That s What We Need
Maybe it surprised you to discover that basketball doesn't pay its own
way; well, it COULD, if we had a Pavilion with adequate seating capacity.
At least 7,000 tickets could have been sold for Saturday night's game—if
there'd been any place to put that many fans.
Incidentally, there's been a lot of favorable comment on the column
Sgt. Slinger wrote advocating a Pavilion for a War Memorial (thanks,
boys). Only one complaint has been received:
"The Editor, Stanford Daily
"Dear Beth:
"If Dan Endsley persists in agitating for a now student-financed Bas
ketball Pavilion, I think he should use the Campus Opinion column. It
doesn't seem fair that he should use the sports page for this purpose . . .
my opinion, of course.
"Cordially.
"Sam Streeter"

Here's the answer, from the
WHOLE sports staff—who favor the
Slinger Plan unanimously:
The President, A.S.S.U.
Dear Marty:
II Sam Streeter persists in agitat- ■
ing for a new student-financed Un- I
ion, I think he should use the Cam- [
pus Opinion column in the Daily. It j
doesn't seem fair that he should use j
Excom for this purpose . . . MY j
opinion, of course.
Cordially,
Dan Endsley !
