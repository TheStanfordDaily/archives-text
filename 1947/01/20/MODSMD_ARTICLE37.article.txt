# Stubborn Card Cagers Come Close at Berkeley, Tire in Second Contest
## 
### ART SHAPIRO 
It was all over before it began! An obviously tired Indian
quintet took to the floor against a fast-breaking and smart Cali-1
fornia five Saturday evening and was fated to go down to defeat, |
and go down they did. After ten minutes of action in the first j
half the Redmen were staggering on their feet, and under a nine- |
point deficit, 15-6. It was a sad story and a closed issue, with
nothing to be done but sit and watch the slaughter.

The Friday tussle which saw the |
Cardinals effectively halt the Cal
scoring parade with a well-conceiv
ed zone defense just couldn't pull the
trick at the Pavilion. The five men
who had stumped the Bear offense
the first and had come to
within one point of victory, were too
tired and too slow to put on a repeat
performance. The Friday affair was
settled in Cal's favor, 47-4(5, and the j
Saturday slaughter, 48-30.
A WOK I) OF PRAISE
Win, lose, or draw, the five men ;
who stood oIY the Blue and Gold
attack during the two nights' do
ings with an absolute minimum of
replacements deserve a word of
praise. Morley Thompson, Babe
liiggins, Steve Stephenson, Dave
Davidson, and Dick Berlin pulled
the iron-man trick against the j
conference leaders and almost
managed to get away with it.
The tip-off on the Saturday eve
ning fracas should have been appar
ent to those who crowded into the
dressing room at the Berkeley Pa- I
vilion after the contest on Friday.
The boys were tired and disillusion
ed after having shot they - bolt, and
not having been able to cop the win.
The same team tried again on Satur
day, but somewhere between Ber
keley and Palo Alto the drive had
disappeared and all that was left was
a terrific amount of spirit.
Chuck. Hanger and Jack Rocker
teamed up to put the screws to the
tiring Stanford five during the sec
ond game. Accounting for 29 points
between them, these two boys were
just too much for the Indians to cope
with, and they provided the margin
of victory for the Berkeley Bears.
Stephenson and Berlin performed
admirably in a lost cause but it was
too little, and too late.
STEPHENSON STARS
The individual star of the two
game series was Steve Stephenson
who garnered 25 counters in an
attempt to stem the Cal tide, hut
just couldn't do it all by his lone
some. Stephenson took the scoring
honors, and that was about all that
the Stanford quintet managed to
take from a good, if not great, Cal
ifornia hoop squad.
A week to rest in, and practice,
and the Cardinals will take on the
Olympic Club on Friday evening and
Fresno State College on Saturday.
