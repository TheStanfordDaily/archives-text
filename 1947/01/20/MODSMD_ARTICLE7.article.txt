# TOYON PROTEST
## 
### 
John M. Stalnaker
Dean of Students
Stanford University, California
Dear Sir:
It has come to the attention of Toyon Cabinet that Toyon Ilall was
searched by University authority during the Christmas vacation despite
the fact that this is contrary to the law of the State of California and
the A.S.S.U. Constitution. We protest this action as unwarranted, in
asmuch as it -violates the Fundamental Standard. This action has en
gendered unfortunate bitterness.
In order to uphold the Honor Code and to maintain at the highest
level the confidence between Administration and students, Toyon Cabi
net shall advise the residents of Toyon Hall as to the existing rules and
regulations, because we feel that the outcome of this search resulted from
inadequate dissemination of existing rules and regulations.
We hope that this will be interpreted in the constructive spirit in
which it is written.
Respectfully submitted,
Toyon Cabinet
Frank J. Creede, Pres. Ernest (i. IYlasler, Rep. Corr. 1
Fred Struck, Sec. Donald J. Corr, Rep. Corr. 2
