### 
RAFINA, Greece, Jan. 19 (UP). —The 1,500-ton steamship Himara
struck a mine oIT the Attica peninsula in pre-dawn darkness today and
sank, half an hour later, with hundreds of men, women and children
shrieking on its decks or trapped in the hold.
It was feared that 300 or more persons died, including members of

Parliament en route to Athens for
tomorrow's opening session.
Its lights out, its boilerroom ripped
[ and aflame, the ship turned over j
| suddenly in the high, wind-driven I
seas, and sank almost instantly.
A Merchant Marine Ministry com- I
munique put the total number of |
j persons aboard, including the crew, i
at about 500 and the rescued at about j
200. Most survivors were taken to
: Athens.
Nocolas Kalini, a soldier aboard,
; told of the incident.
"All the lights on the ship went J
out. Above all the noise I heard the
j captain shouting:
" 'It's all right. She's resting on a j
j sand bar. We have had engine trou- '
, ble.'
"The ship listed slightly on her !
i left side. Some people, not fceliev- I
j ing the captain, ran to the lifeboats
and tried to launch them. But offi- ;
cers firing their pistols in the air I
! drove them away.
"We seemed helpless. But there j
were 200 of us soldiers aboard. Some j
1 of us, in spite of the officers, released ;
the ropes holding the boats,and let j
: them drop in the water. People 1
started jumping over the side into I
the boats."
