OAKLAND, Jan. 20 (UP). — A
giant naval air transport service hos
pital plane making a radar-con
trolled landing on fogbound Oakland
Airport crashed and disintegrated
today killing one navy woman and
injuring 20 other passengers and
crew members.
The injured were taken to the
Oakland Naval Hospital where eight
of them were described as being in
a serious condition, the remaining 12
were treated for minor injuries.
A hospital spokesman said navy
regulations forbid identification of
victims until the next of kin have
been notified. The dead woman was
known to be cither a junior grade
nurse or one of two WAVE hospital
orderlies aboard the plane.
1 ROM MOFFATT
The Douglas Skymaster plane was
on a routine flight from MofTatt
Field, 35 miles south of San Fran
cisco, with 14 passengers and seven
crew members aboard at the time of
the mishap. It was scheduled to take
on .an additional 12 passengers be
fore proceeding to San Diego.
At the time of the crash airport
officials said the field had been clos
ed to all air traffic since last night
due to the heavy log. The ceiling
was absolutely zero at the time of
the accident, they said.
LARGE EXPLOSION
The terrific impact and the ensu
ing explosion rocked nearby homes
and scattered bits of the wreckage
over a wide area, eyewitnesses re
ported.
The plane was coming in for a
normal ground-controlled approach
(GCA) landing under guidance by a
radar unit which guides aircraft to
the runways when fog reduces the
visibility and ceiling below mini
mums required for regular flights.
PILOT TROUBLE
Comdr. William W. Townsley, air
port commandant, said the crash was
caused by a "combination of pilot
trouble" when the aircraft struck a
• like, smashed its landing gear while
skidding ofT the landing strip and
nosed into a mud flat where it ex
ploded.
"From the 'pip' on the radar screen
it would indicate the pilot had
taken over control of the plane be
fore being released by the GCA con
trol unit," Townsley said.
