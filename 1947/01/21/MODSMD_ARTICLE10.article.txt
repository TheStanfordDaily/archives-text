Peaceful st*ltlement ill flic C'hi
iH-so .situation lies in a talk between
Marshall and Stalin, Jerry Rubin,
Stanford graduate student who
served with the United States Em
bassy in China during the war, told
"I" Club members at the Sunday
night meeting of the International
Club.
Dr. Bailey Willis, professor emer
itus of geology, prefaced Rubin's
views on the China conflict when
he said, "I don't think China can
set up a parliament until a number
of sovereign states are recognized
in China as they were in the United
States."
HANDS OI F' IN CHINA
Concerning the United States pol
icy in China. Dr. Willis stated that
we should keep "hands off." He
added that it was "none of our busi
ness who rules China."
Th» background of the trouble.
Rubin explained, was that lor a long

lime China had two ways of life,
two armies and two governments.
The early uniting of the two fac
tions Ih,-it later beemne the Central
Government and the Communists
was at first a "marriage of con
venience."

(Two Stanford professors give
their views oil (lie Chinese situa
tion. See stories on page 4.)

Rubin went on to say that in 1927
the Conservatives gained the upper
hand, repudiated the Communists,
and then allied themselves with the
Nanking and banking interests.
While the Central Government of
Chiang Kai-shek was still fighting
them, the Communists began their
guerilla warfare §gainst the Japa
nese.
Actually the Communists wanted
political control of the north and in
addition they thought they might

i need the Japanese arms for tbe fu
| lure.
AMERICAN INTEKVEM lON
Concerning tbe United Stat' 1 :-;' ap
poarance in the conflict, Rubin said
j that the Communists became anti
' American when our troops began
flying national troops into North
I China.
President Truman then announced
j that the United States favored a
representative, coalition govern
ment, and Marshall was sent
na to uphold the American point
j of view.
CORRUPT GOVERNMENT
Rubin concluded that the govern -
i ment in China today i.s "corrupt, in
efficient, and unstable, and cannot
be supported by the United States
i in the name of democracy."
"The course lies in a talk between
Marshall and Stalin in which the
United States and Russia will both
agree to keep hands off China," said
Rubin.—Pond
