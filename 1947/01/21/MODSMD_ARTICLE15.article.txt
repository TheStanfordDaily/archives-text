# International Affairs to Take Part in Creation of NSO
## 
### 
Needs and responsibilities of American students in international af
fairs, as well as campus and national affairs, will form part of the future
discussion in the creation of the National Students' Organization.
Stanford representatives will attend a constitutional convention some
time before September, 1947. In co-operation with nearly 300 other

American universities and colleges,
they will have the opportunity to
make changes and covinter-propo
sals in the formation of the NSO.
The proposed objectives of the
NSO for student welfare in this
country were summarized in yes
terday's Daily. They include such
aims as equal rights for education,
financial aid to students, democratic
student government, wider cultural
activity, and encouragement of in
tercollegiate sports.
Aims proposed by panel three at
the Chicago Youth Conference Dec.
20 were for participation in inter
national affairs. They include the
following:
1. Organization of a committee
to act as clearing house of infor
mation for student exchange, tra
vel, relief, and rehabilitation. Un
til formation of this group the
Harvard Student Council Com
mittee on international activities
is co-operating with the NSO tem
porary national continuations
committee.
2. A list of existing international
organizations v\ith branches in the
U.S. working in the field of inter
national student activities. The
NSO may then obtain information
and co-operation.
X Formation of a permanent
student travel and hospitality
agency. This agency would co
operate with existing groups as the
American Youth Hostels.
4. Formation of a committee to
help existing foreign student aid
groups, and where needed to help
form new groups composed of fac
ulty and students.
5. Establishment of cultural re
lations between our faculties and
similar ones in foreign universi
ties. For example an NSO com
mittee of music interests in this
country might adopt a foreign
conservatory which had been de
stroyed by the war that they might
exchange music and ideas.
6. Consideration of (he possibil
ity of sending delegates to the
World Youth Festival in Prague
and publicity of this event.
Additional proposals on student
responsibilities were:
1. That the NSO favor all means
of extending two-way student ex
changes, such as providing infor
mation on courses and opportuni
ties for specialization in other
countries for American students
and here for foreign students.
!i. Thai a committee be estab
lished for the distribution of for
eign and international student
publications and information.
3. That the NSO favor the prin
ciple of need alone as (lie basis of
relief distribution. The NSO would
investigate co-operation with the
World Student Service Fund and
World Student Relief.
1. That the NSO favor increas
ing the number of scholarships
given to foreign students by Am
erican universities.
In regard to the International Un
ion of students formed at Prague last
summer, panel three at the Chicago
meeting agreed that the NSO' should
participate, but the specific condition
of affiliation have not been decided
on. They proposed that the NSO, or
the NCC. if the NSO is not yet
formed, bo represented at the lUS
meeting in Prague this summer.
This, then, is a general summar
of the proposed aims of the National
Students Organization. They may
be altered bv its members.
