in the state capital and the executive
mansion and to exercise the guber

who claims to be "acting governor,"
will have desk space in the offices
of the state senate president while
State's Attorney General Eugene

state funds at his disposal with
which to maintain his claim to be

Meanwhile hundreds of politically
conscious students of Georgia col

methods in seizing the governorship.
The students planned to march down
Peach tree and Whitehall streets and
demonstrate at the foot of the statue
