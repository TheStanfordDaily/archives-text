'11 icil balloons tot carrying student interest
unto an international plane have been sent up
in the past few weeks by anxious campus
groups, many of whom, like the Daily, are
seeking meaningful and concrete methods of
making interest into action. It is encouraging
lo hear criticisms of the Daily plan, and more
encouraging to learn of other plans ready for
presentation.
Last night, representatives from the Y's Asi
lomar conference sent up another test balloon,
proposing a three-day conference of students
t'j discuss international issues and resolve stu
<!'-;it opinion upon them. (Further details of
ill'.- plan are reported on page one.) While it
1...,; 111 it elements of specific action, it would,
we feel, drift about permanently unless an
-1 li.jred to earth by a perpetual study institute,
Ly perpetual and one-line student activity.
The institute is meant to provide "education,
iir.pii ation, and a feeling of responsibility in
in (m national relations." Such aims are, though
v.iguely expressed, an adequate listing of
what 1 lie Stanford program thus far lacks.
An institute would concretely provide a
sc.v.ii.l "Jc-p iii the hierarchy toward which

<5111 year-long activities would bo heading. It
would be a further source of information to stu
dents with international ambitions, and would
doubtless serve to clarify those educational
projects which our activity discussion groups
and classrooms should undertake. There would
be a place for every Farm student at the insti
tute; through its appeal of leading speakers
from the country over it might reasonably gar
ner campus supporters to the year-long pro
gram at home.
What we'd hate to see would be an institute
which would stir up the student body to a de
sire to "do something about this international
situation," without having ready a means for
translating its ambitions into action. We have
already proposed a co-ordinating committee to
give emphasis to extra-curricular international
ism; we would hereafter like to propose a
study organization to further emphasize both
the activities and the spring-quarter institute.
And this would call for the co-operation of
persons who will be at Stanford year after
year -the professors and staff to give direc
tion to what could easily become another tan
gent of student thinking.

we feel, drift about permanently unless an

Ly perpetual and one-line student activity.
The institute is meant to provide "education,
iir.pii ation, and a feeling of responsibility in
in (m national relations." Such aims are, though
v.iguely expressed, an adequate listing of
what 1 lie Stanford program thus far lacks.
An institute would concretely provide a

<5111 year-long activities would bo heading. It
would be a further source of information to stu
dents with international ambitions, and would
doubtless serve to clarify those educational
projects which our activity discussion groups
and classrooms should undertake. There would
be a place for every Farm student at the insti
tute; through its appeal of leading speakers
from the country over it might reasonably gar
ner campus supporters to the year-long pro
gram at home.
What we'd hate to see would be an institute
which would stir up the student body to a de
sire to "do something about this international
situation," without having ready a means for
translating its ambitions into action. We have
already proposed a co-ordinating committee to
give emphasis to extra-curricular international
ism; we would hereafter like to propose a
study organization to further emphasize both
the activities and the spring-quarter institute.
And this would call for the co-operation of
persons who will be at Stanford year after
year -the professors and staff to give direc
tion to what could easily become another tan
gent of student thinking.
