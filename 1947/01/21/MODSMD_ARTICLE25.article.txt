# Campaign Expenses?

J'aced with the necessity of final action on
> lection reforms, the Executive Committee has
I jimd general campus approval on its propo
n.ihi with one exception—the question of al-
I .wing individual expenditures of from $10 to
J 5 lor electioneering purposes.
That the traditional system of a complete
"hands-olf" policy is inadequate due to the
tremendously expanded student population
requires no debate; the question centers about
the remedy offered.
Shall the campus be flooded with posters
and printed material extolling the candidates'
respective virtues? This is the question Excom
will decide tonight.
Elections last quarter were dismal failures,
and to correct the difficulties the Election Com
mittee of Excom has brought forward three
suggestions for improvemeftt—two of undis
puted merit. They are:
1) Elimination of the restrictive electoral
procedures set forth in the Constitutional by
l.iws to allow more freedom of action to Elec
tion Board.
2) To set up a primary system to narrow the
list of candidates to three or four so that a),
the average voter is not faced with the neces
sity of voting in order of preference for fifteen
to twenty candidates of whom he may know
one or two and b), the Election Board does not
h.Tve to make repeated counts with correspond
ing chances for error.
The third suggestion - that of allowing elec
tion expenditures of $10 for a minor office and
51.5 for a major one- does not have equivalent
value.
Student interest must be increased but the
Committee's proposal not only would throw

our elections into the "Rah! Rah! High School"
class, based on noise rather than ability, but
also places on Election Board the job of audit
ing and verifying each candidate's expendi
tures. These facts, plus an unlimited oppor
tunity lor charges of hidden expenditures and
the resulting protests of "illegal election" in
dicate the essential weaknesses of the pro
posal.
Several alternatives present themselves for
campus and Excom approval.
Rather than individual advertising, President
Martin Anderson suggests "interviews in the
Daily, talks over KSU and to living groups, and
election assemblies" as capable substitutes.
If Excom believes that these measures are
inadequate, money could be allocated for elec
tion publicity on an equal basis for all. If no
money was forthcoming from the treasury, it
could be obtained by a registration fee of two
or three dollars from each nominee, and while
this arrangement has the weakness of appear
ing to "buy a nomination," it would tend to
discourage those who are not serious candi
dates.
Regardless of the money decision, nomina
tions and declinations should be completed
well in advance of primaries and primaries
must be well in advance of the final elections
so that campus inertia will be overcome by the
date of the final ballot.
Winter quarter elections will be due within
a few short weeks, Excom must act on the
election approvals and fill out the Election
Board so that there will be adequate time to
set up new election machinery. The winter
elections will be the final test of election effi
ciency before the all-important elections next
quarter. —F.B.

2) To set up a primary system to narrow the
list of candidates to three or four so that a),
the average voter is not faced with the neces
sity of voting in order of preference for fifteen
to twenty candidates of whom he may know
one or two and b), the Election Board does not
h.Tve to make repeated counts with correspond
ing chances for error.
The third suggestion - that of allowing elec
tion expenditures of $10 for a minor office and
51.5 for a major one- does not have equivalent
value.
Student interest must be increased but the
Committee's proposal not only would throw

our elections into the "Rah! Rah! High School"
class, based on noise rather than ability, but
also places on Election Board the job of audit
ing and verifying each candidate's expendi
tures. These facts, plus an unlimited oppor
tunity lor charges of hidden expenditures and
the resulting protests of "illegal election" in
dicate the essential weaknesses of the pro
posal.
Several alternatives present themselves for
campus and Excom approval.
Rather than individual advertising, President
Martin Anderson suggests "interviews in the
Daily, talks over KSU and to living groups, and
election assemblies" as capable substitutes.
If Excom believes that these measures are
inadequate, money could be allocated for elec
tion publicity on an equal basis for all. If no
money was forthcoming from the treasury, it
could be obtained by a registration fee of two
or three dollars from each nominee, and while
this arrangement has the weakness of appear
ing to "buy a nomination," it would tend to
discourage those who are not serious candi
dates.
Regardless of the money decision, nomina
tions and declinations should be completed
well in advance of primaries and primaries
must be well in advance of the final elections
so that campus inertia will be overcome by the
date of the final ballot.
Winter quarter elections will be due within
a few short weeks, Excom must act on the
election approvals and fill out the Election
Board so that there will be adequate time to
set up new election machinery. The winter
elections will be the final test of election effi
ciency before the all-important elections next
quarter. —F.B.
J'aced with the necessity of final action on
> lection reforms, the Executive Committee has
I jimd general campus approval on its propo
n.ihi with one exception—the question of al-
I .wing individual expenditures of from $10 to
J 5 lor electioneering purposes.
That the traditional system of a complete
"hands-olf" policy is inadequate due to the
tremendously expanded student population
requires no debate; the question centers about
the remedy offered.
Shall the campus be flooded with posters
and printed material extolling the candidates'
respective virtues? This is the question Excom
will decide tonight.
Elections last quarter were dismal failures,
and to correct the difficulties the Election Com
mittee of Excom has brought forward three
suggestions for improvemeftt—two of undis
puted merit. They are:
1) Elimination of the restrictive electoral
procedures set forth in the Constitutional by
l.iws to allow more freedom of action to Elec
tion Board.
2) To set up a primary system to narrow the
