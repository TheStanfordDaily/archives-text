(Now and then some evidence of the average
•student mind and what's in it causes us to sit up
and shudder. Far from being simon-pure our
selves, we have nevertheless been jolted in reading
over trial Hull which have thus far almost
entirely relied upon sex, boozing or general filth
for humor. Now for you potential columnists,
here's what we had in mind:
(A column on campus conversations and go
ings-on—what's happening on Quad, or discussed
in the Excom room, or taking place in the local
tuer-halls if you like. But the primary requisite
i.s NOT to encourage concern with the filthiest of
all possible ,'okes. or to enlarge out of all propor
tion the boozy, sexy aspects of Stanford life. Why
not an intellectually honest column which dis
cusses from the student-on-Quad's viewpoint that
which is interesting, humorous, or important?
Why is it necessary to cater to, rather than stand
above, those students who have nothing on their
minds luit being as morally lax as possible?
(It's gotten so we'd appreciate a few jokes like
"Who was (hat lady I seen you with last night?"—
Editor's note)

Who was that lady 1 seen you with last night?
('oughlin.
Migawsh, Longbarn's actually put rabbits in
down there! But unfortunately they've now been
banished.
Seems they got out of their pen the other night
and. apparently tired of other rabbits, began chasing
the birds. Much resultant confusion with rabbits
rabbiting, birds birding, rabbits birding on birds,
birds birding on rabbits, etc.
So the rabbits are gone again. But the birds still
panic every time anyone named Harvey comes near
the place.

The How tongs have begun the old annual cus
tom of gladhanding potential initiation fees again
and both frosh and brothers are cursing all the nec
essary formalities.

At one of (he tongs the other night, a brother
w;is in his third-floor room wearily getting dressed
lor iiii open house session. The open house had been

going on for about an hour but not being eager he
was taking his time about joining the mob down
stairs.
Arrayed only in his shorts, he was dismayed to
hear a member leading a group of freshmen toward
the room. Not wanting to be caught unclad, he
for the nearest closet and concealed himself.
The brother led the rushees into the. room and
proceeded to expound at length on what zanies the
occupants of that particular room were (which, in
cidentally, they are with the exception of one* sane
one and he has two heads, but that's beside the
point). After this discourse, the brother led the neo
phytes away on his guided tour and the lad who
had be'Mi hiding in the closet came out. considerably
enlightened on what his friend thought of him.
No sooner had he come out of hiding than another
{•roup approached led by a different brother.
our boy leaped for the closet. And once again he
was forced to listen to a discourse on what charac
ters he and his roommates were.
At that point his self-control gave way and he
sprang forth into the room, shorts flapping, and
sci earned, "Yes, and I'm one of the natives," at the
bewildered rushees.
They retreated from the house hastily and have
probably been giving the house a wide berth ever
since.

That, incidentally, was the same lad who was
recently visited by two of his friends from back
East who had just been discharged from the Army.
Among the sights of the campus he offered to show
them was the lake.
Led bv our hero, the little group struck out across
the fields toward the lake. The further they walked,
however, the more lost they got. The two visitors
were mumbling bitterly to themselves as they stum
bled through weeds and over rocks.
Our friend, however, hesitated to admit that he
was lost. Finally, he admitted defeat and told his
G.I. companions that he couldn't find the lake.
"Oh, well," he added brightly, "it doesn't have
any water in it, anyway!"
When last seen, two weary soldiers were ehasini;
him toward town.
