To tho Editor:
To clarify certain points of doubt
that have arisen concerning tho
Stanford International Survey Com
mittee, the following is presented:
The aim of the International Sur
vey is beyond a mere survey of stu
dent conditions abroad. In actuality
the Survey shall attempt to bring
to the Stanford student a clear,
first-hand record of observations in
regard to economic, political and
cultural conditions existing in for
eign areas most potentially danger
ous to world peace, to mirror for all
of us changes apparent in the econ
omy, culture and political makeup
of the areas visited, and to view the
ways in which the peoples of those
regions are thinking and acting.
This all comes down to attempting
to gain an acquaintance with for
eign peoples, from president to
peon, and to foster an understand
ing of their problems.
A survey of North China seemed
desirable, but expenses involved
prohibited this. Spain, Palestine,
and Greece, however, contain prob
lems that are as vital to world
peace, problems which most cer
tainly could directly affect our lives.
Thus it was determined that these
nations would definitely be consid
ered despite the lack of normal uni
versity life in these areas, a factor
upon which the gathering of Sur
vey information does not depend.
As has been publicly made clear
to the student body, the purpose of
the Survey is not to produce world
changing, world saving findings, but
to bring to Stanford observations
that may aid us in gaining an ac
quaintance with peoples and prob
lems foreign to us. Inasmuch as
this is so, the information concern
ing travel and accommodations will
quite obviously not be closed to all
except the few students selected to
travel on the Survey. This has
been demonstrated to those who,
interested in traveling abroad dur
ing the coming summer, have taken
the trouble to request such infor
mation. All information regarding
travel has not yet been accumulated
as the process requires time. When
the fact gathering is completed, the
information will be available for the
benefit of the group for which it
was gathered, the Stanford student
body. Information already at hand
includes data on youth hostels, this
specific item having been dealt with
last quarter by Pat Anderson. In
formation on the student confer
ences at Prague and Oslo also is
present and being supplemented
from individual sources and through
our quasi-affiliation with the Com
mittee for the National Student Or
ganization.
These aforementioned matters
have been dealt with by the ISC.
As to aiding and directing students
in planning their courses for lives
and careers abroad, this matter
seemed somewhat beyond our prov
ince. Stanford students shall nat
urally continue to plan a curricu
lum according to individual dictates,
and advised in this by men far more
expert than us of the Committee.
ISC was formed by Excom. Its
immediate aim is to enable some
of you to travel abroad this sum
mer. Its ultimate aid is to bring
something of material value to ev
ery one of you. It is your commit
tee. We invite questions, advice and
constructive criticism from each of
you. Its worth and future are in
your hands and will be determined
by your judgment. Inasmuch as it
is your committee that judgment,
should be yours and only yours.

Chairman, ISC
