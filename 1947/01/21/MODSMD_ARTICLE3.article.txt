# Solons Fight Over Budget
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 (UP).—
I The Joint Congressional Budget
i Committee decided in a stormy ini
| tial meeting today that it would
recommend over-all figures for
i budget spending each year, but
probably would leave the details to
I the several committees now charged
j with those duties.
An organizational meeting of 102
1 Republicans and Democratic mem
| bers of four House and Senate com
j mittees developed into a quarrel
I over jurisdiction of a new 20-mem
| her subcommittee named to work
| out budget details.
Older heads, however, appeared
to he prevailing in the determina
tion to restrict the committee's flu
ties to over-all. not specific recom
j mendations. It was believed that
this general policy will be adopted
at the first subcommittee meeting
later this week.
The opponents demanded that the
I subcommittee go further than a
mere paring of the $37,528,000,000
budget recommended by President
Truman for fiscal 1948. They wanted
; the subcommittee—five members
| each from the Senate appropriations
! and finance committees, the House
I ways and means and finance com
mittees—to decide where the money
should go and how much to each
branch of the government.
The meeting coincided with these
developments in the national spend
find-collect picture:
1. A pre-conference statement by
Sen. Robert A. Taft. R-Dhio, that he
was convinced Congress could cut
$3,000,000,000 to $4,000,000,000 from
the President's budget without, im
pairing government services; that.
| the 20 per cent income tax cut pro
posed by some Republicans might
not cost the treasury the .$3,000,000.-
000 loss it has estimated, since tax
cuts do not always result in revenue
losses.
2. A post-conference charge by
Sen. Joseph C. O'Mahoney, D-
Wvo. that the new budget subcom
mittee of 20 members had invoked
the "sag rule" in refusing to give
members of the full committee no
tice of its meetings.

ties to over-all. not specific recom
j mendations. It was believed that
this general policy will be adopted
at the first subcommittee meeting
later this week.
The opponents demanded that the
I subcommittee go further than a
mere paring of the $37,528,000,000
budget recommended by President
Truman for fiscal 1948. They wanted
; the subcommittee—five members
| each from the Senate appropriations
! and finance committees, the House
I ways and means and finance com
mittees—to decide where the money
should go and how much to each
branch of the government.
The meeting coincided with these
developments in the national spend
find-collect picture:
1. A pre-conference statement by
Sen. Robert A. Taft. R-Dhio, that he
was convinced Congress could cut
$3,000,000,000 to $4,000,000,000 from
the President's budget without, im
pairing government services; that.
| the 20 per cent income tax cut pro
posed by some Republicans might
not cost the treasury the .$3,000,000.-
000 loss it has estimated, since tax
cuts do not always result in revenue
losses.
2. A post-conference charge by
Sen. Joseph C. O'Mahoney, D-
Wvo. that the new budget subcom
mittee of 20 members had invoked
the "sag rule" in refusing to give
members of the full committee no
tice of its meetings.
