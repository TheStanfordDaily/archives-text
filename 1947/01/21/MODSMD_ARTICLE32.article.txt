The ingenuity of two Stanford
| veterans combined with a cross
! country hitch-hiking trip, plus the

Two Stanford Law School stu-
I dents, Sterling Huteheson and
j Wayne Mann, are joint managers of
J the home-grown venture. Both are
i veterans.
"My wife kept losing her lip
stick all the time," Mann said. "So
1 invented the 'Paly Pin',"
Mann had to hitch-hike all the
way to the East Coast to find mate
i rials for his idea, which is a deco
| rative lapel pin with a lipstick, tiny
| perfume bottle, or what-have-you
attached to a self - winding gold
! chain contained inside the pin.
"We have promises from the Elec
trolux company that they'll make a
| cigarette lighter to fit the pin. too,"
Mann said. "You won't ever lose a
light that way."
Mann and Huteheson assemble
the |>ins here in Palo Alto and
have a patent pending on their
invention in Washington. The
Stanford Bookstore is the first re
tailer authorized to sell "Paly
Pins." They are made in 14 dif
ferent shapes, ranging from edu
cated penguins to lamhs, and will
sell at prices ranging downward
from $!).
Perfume bottles, handblown by
refugee Germans, and lipsticks are
the two things you can attach to the
' "Paly Pins" at present, but Mann

and Hutcheson hope to find other
articles soon.
"We also hope to go to Hollywood
soon and give "Paly Pins" to well
known actresses, but we wanted
Stanford women to have a chance
to start a national style," Mann said.
