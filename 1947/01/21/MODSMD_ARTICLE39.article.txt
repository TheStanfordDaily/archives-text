l?ookie pitcher Edson Bahr of Se
attle is a Pittsburgh Pirate holdout.
In a letter to General Manager
11. Roy Harney, Bahr wrote, in
part, "I think that a pitcher who
can lead his club in earned runs
for the season certainly should
receive consideration as to the
amount of money 1 can earn for
(he Pittsburgh club this year, and
of course, for myself and family."
Bahr led the Pittsburgh club with
a 2 (>3 earned run average last year.
