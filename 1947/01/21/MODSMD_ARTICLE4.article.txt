# Telephone Service Will Be Extended
## 
### 
Beginning next Sunday, users of
approximately 5,500 Palo Alto ex
tended service telephones, including
those at Stanford University, will
be able to phone directly to any one
of four adjacent communities by
dialing the numbers wanted instead
of first calling "Operator." This
change in service was announced
yesterday by B. L. Manuel, Palo
Alto manager of the Pacific Tele
phone and Telegraph Company.
Palo Alto iind Stanford will be
brought into quicker communica
tion with Redwood City, Woodside,
Los Altos and Mountain View by
an interchange system of operation
for extended service telephones,
The changes now under way will be
completed before Sunday, he said.
Those not having the extended
service will continue to place calls
to these neighboring communities in
the former manner by dialing "0"'
and then giving the town and num
ber to the operator.
