## 
### 
NEW YORK. Jan. 20 (UP).—Big
Hank Greenberg, although express
ing disappointment upon leaving the
club with which he has spent his en
tire major league career, today
scotched reports that he planned to
retire because he was sold to Pitts
burgh by the Detroit Tigers..
He branded such reports "silly"
and at the same time made it plain
that he would give the Pirates the
best there is in him and that he
would play "anywhere" Manager
Billy Herman wants him to. He
added that he never had made an
issue of playing either first base or
the outfield.
One of baseball's hardest hitters,
Greenberg said his sale came as a
"complete surprise" and that he soon
would confer with Pirates officials
over a 1947 contract. He anticipated
no difficulties over terms—he re
portedly received $00,000 from the
Tigers last season—and said that re
ports that he might buy into the-
Pirates was "pure speculation."
Hank, whose 44 home runs led
the majors last season, expressed
regret that he had been waived
out of the American League.
"I've always given the Tigers my

i best efforts and I think my record
: speaks for itself. Naturaliv, after
| this long and pleasant relationship,
I am disappointed at being waived
out of the league. I also regret leav
-"-mg my Tiger teammates, many of
whom are my close friends."
Greenberg paid tribute to Detroit
fans, who often acclaimed the husky
slugger with the same enthusiasm
Yankee fans lauded Babe Ruth and
I Lou Gehrig.
