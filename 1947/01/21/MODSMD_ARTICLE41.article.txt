# Indian Cagemen Lack Experience
## Lack of Height, Speed on Varsity 
### ART SHAPIRO 
With the hoop season one-third
J completed it's just about the right
time to sit down and figure out the
wheres, whys, and so forths which
control the destiny of the Indian
i cagemen.
The most obvious deficiency of
the Rcdnicn is (heir lack of speed.
At no one position can the Stan
ford varsity boast of a speedster,
or even a reasonably accurate fac
simile. As a result of this, the team
i has been unable to work out a fast
break and frequently has to pass
up golden opportunities in (he
| form of lightning-like attacks in
favor of a slower and more plod
ding offense.
Another consequence of the slow
i ness is to be found in the foul sta
tistics. Unable to wrest the ball
; away from the opponents by reason
! of pure speed afoot, the boys occa
' sionally, in their eagerness to cap
ture the casaba, find themselves
forced either to foul or to concede
| the field goal. In the two contests
I with California the final outcomes
were decided not from the floor, but
j from the free-throw line. The few
i fast men to be found on the squad
I have been relegated to the bench as
j substitutes because of other factors.
! Were it possible to combine the
i speed of Chavalas and Iverson with
the steady playing ability of the
; present quintet, the Stanford attack
would be worth at least five addi
tional points per contest.
The Cardinal five, with an aver
age height just short of (5 foot .*>
inches probably can be considered
as a tall team, but upon closer ob
scrvation a startling fact can be
noted. There is no member of the
varsity taller than 6 foot 4. and
i the high average is due, not to
any real tall men. hut to a group
j ing around (he 6 foot 3 inch figure.
As a result of (his. the team is
• consistently losing the hall on cen
ter jumps, and is forced to battle
for every rebound off either of the
backboards. One tall man of about
G foot 5 would end this worry and
would give (he Rediuen a decent
chance to capture the center
jumps, thus increasing (he scoring
chances of the five.
The other team weakness is a
I purely mechanical one and can be
j corrected through practice. During
the Saturday evening fray with Cal,
i the Bears missed eight out of twen
; ty-three foul attempts while the
j Cards missed the same number out
of but eleven attempts. A higher
! percentage of completions in that
contest may have stemmed the rout,
| and a higher percentage on Friday
would have brought victory.
In the accolade department
praise must be distributed to the
boys for the driving type of play
i they demonstrated, Davidson's fine
, work under the hoards, Stephcfa
; son's coolness under fire and re
markable hook shots, the accuracy
of the entire team from the floor,
and the dogged determination not
| (o be counted out of the game at
j all costs.
