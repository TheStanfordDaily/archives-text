# JV Stock Rises With Each Game

Unheralded and unsung, the Farm
Jayvee hoopsters have been round
ing into form and by the season's
end will have developed some out
standing talent which will serve as
a nucleus for next year's varsity.
This past Saturday night, they play
ed the California Blues, who have
compiled an enviable record of
twenty straight wins, to a standstill
in the first half. In fact, with ten
minutes to play the Redshirts led by
five points, but lost out in the late
Blues drive.
Jack Dana, one of the stars of
Everett Dean's last championship
squad, coaches the team. Dana has
heen starting a lineup consisting
mainly of freshmen hut sprinkled
with veterans who can lend steadi
ness and polish to the green new
comers. Bill Christiansen, captain
and first-string guard of last year's
varsity and Jack Wood, a suh on
the same team, start at forward
and guard respectively.
The man to watch in future games
is Ralph Carver, a frosh from L.A.
High where he made all-city. Ralph
is a talented floor player who is ex
ceptionally clever under the back
boards. The Stanford attack revolves
around his pivot position.
Besides Christiansen, the other
starting forward is Jim West. Jim,
like Carver, is also a freshman,
and has on occasion displayed ex
ceptional form coupled with a
deadly accurate eye. Fred Lewis
holds down a guard position along
with Wood. Lewis is noted for a
steady defensive game and, if he
maintains his pace of last week,
should he playing next to twin
brother Bob on the varsity before
long.
Players backing up this starting
five include a number of up and
coming youngsters. George Yardley.
who was outstanding in the few
minutes he played in the Menlo J.C.
game, was quite a center while at
Newport Beach High School down
south. Dave Atcheson, a six foot six
inch center Ls a capable replacement
for Carver. He played quite a bit of
ball while in the service and with
more experience should move up to
become an offensive threat.
The main thing which has been
hampering the team as a unit to
date, has been an inability to prop
erly co-ordinate their defensive
man-to-man shift. As a result op
posing cagers at*e being left un
guarded for set shots. After initial
nervousness has been overcome, the
Indians should have little difficulty
in correctly picking up switches.
