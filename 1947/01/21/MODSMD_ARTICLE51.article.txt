# Strong Swimming Team Starts Six-Day Practice
## 
### JACK CASHEL 
A grind of a 6-day-a-week practice schedule has been set by
Coaches Tom Haynie and Ernie Brandsten to prepare their power
; packed varsity swim team for their first meet, February 21, with
the San Francisco Olympic Club.

The team, which promises to be
one of the strongest in Farm history,
is a veritable "coaches dream." Main
weak-link at present is in the div
ing bracket, which was given an ad
ditional stab by fate over the week
end when prospect Bill Beamer
broke his leg while skiing. Last year,
fate made an identical stab when
diver Don Kroener broke his ankle
early in the season. As it now stands,
diving will be handled by Louie
Fentnor, Newt Arnold and Don
Lindsay.
The sprints, distances, breast
stroke and backstroke are so overly
packed, opposing swim coaches
should cringe at any thought of
Stanford. Just to mention a very few
of the bigger names, Bob Anderson,
Jim Armstrong, Ed Hester—'46 con
, ference breaststroke champ, A 1 and
j Jack Weeden, Emmet Cashin—'43
! NCAA breaststroke king, Harry
| Botchers—conference backstroke ti
j tleholder—Captain Rule, and Fred
Taioli—at present swimming down
under in Australia. Taioli, inciden
tally, is still retaining his eligibility
| for this season's collegiate swimming
| by carrying 12 units of independent
j study.
Second practice meet scheduled
is with San Jose State February

27. Conference swim meets are all
scheduled during the month of
May, capped by the all-conference
championships to be held on the
thirty-first of the month at Los
Angeles. The NCAA champion
ships will be held March 28-2!) at
Seattle. Last year, the Farm's lone
representative. Hob Anderson,
came home with the bacon in the
form of the 50-yard freestyle
championship.
This year's results are still in Ihe
uture. But watch out- —they'rt
loaded.
