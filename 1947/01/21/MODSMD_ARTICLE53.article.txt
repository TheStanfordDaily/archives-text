# ‘The New York Idea’ Features Headgear Instead of Costumes
## 
### 
Headdresses instead of costumes will be featured tomorrow night at
the play reading, "The New York Idea." by Langdon Mitchell, which begins
at 8 in the Little Theater.

The cast instead of changing costumes will change hats. When they
go out, they will put on a hat; when they come in, they will take it oil.

It's fluffy hats for the ladies and
large hats for the men. The cast will
wear black clothes as a backdrop
i'or these headdresses.
Hats were designed by Betty Mc-
Gee, Sally McAllister, and the di
rector of the reading, Walter
Krumm. The play is a period com
edy laid in 1906 when big, flashy
hats were popular.
"The New York Idea' is a play
about the divorce question among
high society of New York. Accord
ing to Krumm. it is similar to Oscar
Wilde's comedies of manners.
Lighting is being handled by Hal
Todd. The stage manager is Charles
Ingram.
Tickets are on sale for 30 cents in
Room 201. Memorial Hall. Call P.A.
22041 for reservations.
