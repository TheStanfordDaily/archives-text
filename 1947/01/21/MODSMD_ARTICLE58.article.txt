# Student Body Cards Needed at Library
## 
### 
Dr. Nathan van Patten, direc
tor of University libraries, an
nounced yesterday the reason for
the requirement that a student
body card or library privilege
card be shown in order to take a
book from the library. He said
that this was not a new rule, but
an old one which has not been
strictly enforced in the past.
Last autumn quarter nearly a
hundred books were checked out
by persons not entitled to use the
library. At both the loan desk
and reserve book room there were
numerous cases of persons using
another's name, and sometimes a
fictitious name, in order to obtain
a book.
