# Willis Praises Early Geologists
## 
### 
Speaking as colleague and fellow
worker with J. W. Powell and G.
K. Gilbert, two pioneer American
geologists. Dr. Bailey Willis yester
day paid tribute to these men at an
afternoon meeting of the Geology
Journal Club.
Professor emeritus of geology at
Stanford. Dr. Willis told his audi
ence that "These men faced un
known and undefined problems
which they solved correctly so that
their work is now the basis for our
own."
"These men were keen thinkers
but they were not trained geolo
gists: Stanford men who have taken
our elementary course are better
prepared than they were." Dr. Wil
lis said.
Major Powell's work centered
around the Grand Canyon in the
1870's. and he was the first man to
"run the canyon," a daring 300-mile
boat trip down the Colorado.
Gilbert worked with Powell, then
director of the National Geological
Survey, and also conducted his own
research activities in the Great Salt
Lake Basin.
Dr. Willis fust served under Gil
bert in 1885, joining Powell's Na
tional Geological Survey in 1884. He
later became chief geologist of the
Survey.â€”llaight
