# THE 						CHINESE SITUATION
## Watkins Says Russ Tension Unlikely; Farm Up to Par in Oriental Studies: Chan 
### 
No tension with Russia over the
probable shift of American policy in
China is expected by James T. Wat
kins, professor of political science
and authority on international rela
tions.
Dr. Watkins, who conducted a
round-table discussion on American
foreign policy in China at the recent
Institute of World Affairs, gives as
the basis of this conclusion the fact
that Russia apparently is not sup
porting the Communists in China;
furthermore she has concluded a 30-
year treaty with China's Kuomin
tang government that portends
peaceful relations.
American policy, however, seems
destined for a shift in emphasis if
not in direction—a shift that will
see Chiang Kai-shek getting
greater support from Washington
than before while the policy of
large-scale intervention to unite
Communists and the Kuomintang
is discarded.
This likelihood is emphasized by
the increasing influence in foreign
affairs which the Republican party is
expected to have since their victory
in the November elections.
Indicative of the Republican atti
tude is the speech Jan. 11 by Senator
Vandenberg, Republican leader in
foreign affairs, who advocated
greater aid for Chiang Kai-shek and
his Kuomintang party.
Dr. Watkins briefly reviewed the
political situation in China. China,
he said, had promulgated a consti
tution Jan. 1 which is to go into
effect on Dec. 25 of this year.
Until that time, according to the
program the Kuomintang will have
a monopoly of political power while
the Chinese people are being school
ed in self-government; then the
party will abdicate its privileged sta
tus and political power will be trans
ferred to the people.
Tlie Young China Party and the
Social Democratic party, both of
whom participated in the National
Assembly which adopted the Con
stitution. have been invited to share
in the interim government, but over
tures made to the Communist party
have been rejected.
Both General Marshall and Am
bassador Stuart have praised the
new constitution us a democratic in
strumept, and both have praised
Chiang Kai-shek for his statesman
ship. though criticizing extremists of
both the Kuomintang and Commun
ist parties for tailing to agree on a
united government.

"Stanford isn't too far behind
Yale, Harvard, and Chicago" in
training methods in Chinese area
and language studies, Dr. Shau
Wing Chan, associate professor of
Chinese and humanities, told mem
bers of the Chinese - American
Friendship Group yesterday.
Speaking before 30 students in
the group's first meeting of winter
quarter, Dr. Chan described his au
tumn survey trip of Oriental study
programs in Eastern universities.
Yale and Harvard are outstand
ing in their equipment and in the
student interest shown in the pro
gram. Both have had Far Eastern
programs for more than a decade
and both otter graduate work, Chan
said.

But Stanford in ten years has be
gun a program which can offer com
! parable training if language study
intensity is stepped up and student
j interest in Far Eastern problems is
| stimulated, Chan said.
I He urged the group to expand its
! activities in developing social and
, intellectual bonds between Stanford
; Chinese and American students.
An expert on Chinese transporta
tion. John Earl Baker, will speak to
; the group at its next meeting, Mon
| day, Feb. 3.
Baker was closely connected with
th" development of the Burma Road
I and has been a student of Chinese
| transportation problems for 30
years.

foreign policy in China at the recent
Institute of World Affairs, gives as
the basis of this conclusion the fact
that Russia apparently is not sup
porting the Communists in China;
furthermore she has concluded a 30-
year treaty with China's Kuomin
tang government that portends
peaceful relations.
American policy, however, seems
destined for a shift in emphasis if
not in direction—a shift that will
see Chiang Kai-shek getting
greater support from Washington
than before while the policy of
large-scale intervention to unite
Communists and the Kuomintang
is discarded.
This likelihood is emphasized by
the increasing influence in foreign
affairs which the Republican party is
expected to have since their victory
in the November elections.
Indicative of the Republican atti
tude is the speech Jan. 11 by Senator
Vandenberg, Republican leader in
foreign affairs, who advocated
greater aid for Chiang Kai-shek and
his Kuomintang party.
Dr. Watkins briefly reviewed the
political situation in China. China,
he said, had promulgated a consti
tution Jan. 1 which is to go into
effect on Dec. 25 of this year.
Until that time, according to the
program the Kuomintang will have
a monopoly of political power while
the Chinese people are being school
ed in self-government; then the
party will abdicate its privileged sta
tus and political power will be trans
ferred to the people.
Tlie Young China Party and the
Social Democratic party, both of
whom participated in the National
Assembly which adopted the Con
stitution. have been invited to share
in the interim government, but over
tures made to the Communist party
have been rejected.
Both General Marshall and Am
bassador Stuart have praised the
new constitution us a democratic in
strumept, and both have praised
Chiang Kai-shek for his statesman
ship. though criticizing extremists of
both the Kuomintang and Commun
ist parties for tailing to agree on a
united government.

"Stanford isn't too far behind
Yale, Harvard, and Chicago" in
training methods in Chinese area
and language studies, Dr. Shau
Wing Chan, associate professor of
Chinese and humanities, told mem
bers of the Chinese - American
Friendship Group yesterday.
Speaking before 30 students in
the group's first meeting of winter
quarter, Dr. Chan described his au
tumn survey trip of Oriental study
programs in Eastern universities.
Yale and Harvard are outstand
ing in their equipment and in the
student interest shown in the pro
gram. Both have had Far Eastern
programs for more than a decade
and both otter graduate work, Chan
said.

But Stanford in ten years has be
gun a program which can offer com
! parable training if language study
intensity is stepped up and student
j interest in Far Eastern problems is
| stimulated, Chan said.
I He urged the group to expand its
! activities in developing social and
, intellectual bonds between Stanford
; Chinese and American students.
An expert on Chinese transporta
tion. John Earl Baker, will speak to
; the group at its next meeting, Mon
| day, Feb. 3.
Baker was closely connected with
th" development of the Burma Road
I and has been a student of Chinese

years.
