## 
### 
"The University does not intend
to violate either the state law or the
A.S.S.U. constitution, and I do not
consider that it has done so," Dean
of Students John ?vT. Stalnaker said
yesterday, in commenting on Toyon
Club's protest against room searches
by campus police.

Violations of the Honor Code
and Fundamental Standard which
were discovered in the raid on
Toyon during vacation will be re
viewed this afternoon by Men's
Council at their regular meeting
at 3:15.
According to Ted Lee. secretary
of Men's Council, there were three
pistols in the rooms, two cases of
liquor, and one pinball machine.
No decision has been made as to
the policy of Men's Council re
garding the raid as a violation of
the Honor Code.

"Our legal counsel advises us

that the checking of students'
rooms during vacation is perfect
ly legal." Dean Stalnakcr said. lie
dismissed the implication that the
University would deliberately vio
late the law as "silly."
Dean Stalnakcr emphasized that
the University was only acting for
the protection of the students. "Per
sonally," he said, "I don't want to do
anything the majority of the stu
dents seriously opposes."
Gordon Davis, University police
chief, stated that the use of the
term "search" was misleading. "We
make a room check from time to
time in all the halls, houses, and
fraternities, in the interests of the
security of University property. We
look for any dangerous or improper
conditions and report what we find."
Chief Davis said that they had
been checking rooms when he came
to Stanford in 1930, and that, so far
as he knew, it had been going on
for at least 35 years.
