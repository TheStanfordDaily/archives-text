A'l LANTA, (la., .lan. 21 (Hl*). —Angry college students hanged (l«»v. *
Herman Talmadge in effigy on the Slate House lawn today while the son
of "Old dene" Tahnadge was offering to resign if the duly elected Lieu
tenant (lovernor, IVI. E. Thompson, would resign too.
Thompson immediately rejected this challenge to submit the dispute

on who is the# legal Governor of 112
Georgia back to the people in a j
special all-white Democratic pri- !
mary.
In a brief statement noting I
Talmadge's "receding" position.
Thompson said that if lie made a
"trade" with Talmadge it "would
be insulting to the people; of >
Georgia.''
"My agreeing not to contest H'-r- |
man Talmadge's claim would not j
render his acts as Governor legal.'' ;
Thompson said. "To delay the legal
adjudication of the case (seeking !
Talmadge's ouster) now before the
courts would only create more con- !
fusion and damage to the state be- i
cause the legality of every act per
formed by Talmadge as Governor 1
would be questioned."
Talmadge made his surprise of
fer to resign in a speech to the
Legislature, lie made it contin
gent oil Thompson's simultaneous
resignation and the passage of
legislation to insure all - white
Democratic state primaries.
