# KSU Off Air Temporarily
## 
### 
Station KSU is temporarily off the
air in order to expand their facilities j
and improve quality of reception, j
Studios on campus will soon run i
live shows daily from the Memorial
Auditorium, according to Ray San- ;
ders, chief engineer.
The expanded service of KSU will ;
cover all the Village, Branner, En
ciria, Toyoti, Roble, and Lagunita.
The quality of reception will also be
improved so that KSU will sound as
clear on the air as other Bay Region !
stations.
To the question "why can't KSU j
he heard in Palo Alto or all of Stan- j
ford?' the engineering staff explains |
that KSU is not a clear-channel sta- i
tion. This means that it is broad- j
cast through wires in the buildings, j
and only buildings which have been j
thur, wired can pick up the station, j
