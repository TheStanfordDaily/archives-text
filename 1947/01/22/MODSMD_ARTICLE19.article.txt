# Meritt Reads English Epic
## 
### 
Dr. Ilerbort Meritt had a great
] time yesterday afternoon as he told I
j listeners of the gory deeds of Beo- ;
j wulf and mystified them by reading
in Old English.
His listeners had fun too as Dr.
! Meritt, associate professor of Eng
lish. read Old English poetry at the
first poetry reading of this quarter.
He read selections from "Beo
wulf' on the bloody story of the j
hero's fight with the monster, Gren- !
del. Beowulf is the epitome of all j
j that is good in man as he struggles i
against evil.
Dr. Meritt's voice was light and!
satirical as he read of a thane's j
taunting of Beowulf. It became i
husky with created suspense as j
"through the shades of night, the ,
fiend came creeping" to eat the j
sleeping Beowulf. It was excited as !
Grendel clutched the body of h
sleeping thane, tore it. apart, and
! drank blood.
| Beowulf sprang to the thane's de
j feuse. Dr. Meritt groaned with
Grendel as Beowulf tore oft the
monster's ami. His voice was tri
umphant us Beowulf laid down
Grendel's dripping arm before the
king.
Dr. Merit! then read some of this
in the original Old English. It was
j;t strange sound a kind of mixture]
of the pig Latin of a high-schooler
and the guttural "German" used by
Charlie Chaplin in "The Great Die- !
later." Milnor
