WIIO IS A LIBERAL?
C.M.: Oh. no! Not you again?
R.H.: Yep. And you know why.
It's time to write one of those things
again.
C.M.: Already yet. I haven't got
ten over that one last week. Let's
.see, we said we'd say something
about what liberalism is. Well,
we're both liberals but what kind?
Let's clear that up. Taft, Wallace,
Hoover, Pepper, Stassen, and Mead
all call themselves liberals. What
th'ell is a liberal then?
R.H.: Well, Carrol Reece, GOP
chairman, calls himself a liberal.
He says that government is best
which governs least, that a liberal
government is one of limited pow
ers; a government bound to respect
certain inalienable rights of the in
dividual. I don't call Reece a lib
eral. I believe there is much more
to liberalism than that.
C.M.: In popular usage the CIO-
I'ACE and the new ICPA (oh bells,
it's now the PCA) and other profes
sional "liberals" don't come under
my classification of liberals either.
TAFT A LIBERAL
R.H.: But neither is your Taft the
in i t. . ii .

liberal he calls
himself. To him,
a liberal is "one
who believes in
freedom and op
poses measures
which restrict it,
unless such re
strictions are ab
solutely neces
sary to preserve
• the freedom of
s othei's." Taft fur
ther states, "If
any proposals
k are made under
the name of lib-

era I ism 'which would destroy that
freedom, the whole basis of the phi
losophy would collapse. One cannot
be a liberal unless he opposes such
suggestions. But today, those who
advocate change are utterly intoler
ant of everyone who opposes their
ide:..->. 1
By Taft's standards of liberalism,
1 must agree with him—as far as he
goes. But by my own standards I
call both Recce and Taft conserva
tives.
C.M.: Since you agree with Taft.
by his standards, I'll have to agree
with FDR. The late President Roo
sevelt believed that it was his sworn
duty to take all steps necessary to
insure the continuance of liberalism
and yet the means he used to achieve
his ends were definitely illiberal.
He said that the liberal party is one
which believes that, as new condi
tions and problems arise beyond the
power of men and women to meet
as individuals, it becomes the duly
of the government itself to find now
remedies with which to meet them.
With this, I'm in agreement; it is old
Republican philosophy.
This theory of the role of govern
ment was expressed by Abe Lin
coln when he said, "The legitimate
object of government is to do for
;i community of people whatever
they need to have done, but cannot
do at all, or cannot do so well, for
themselves, in their separate and
individual capacities."
R.li.: Don't forget t at FDR also
said the liberal party insists that
government has the duty to use all
.— i

its powers and resources to meet
new social problems with new so
cial controls—to insure to the aver
age person the right to his own eco
nomic and political life, liberty, and
pursuit of happiness.
MEAD A LIBERAL
Ex-Senator Mead supports this i
idea, saying that (1) "Liberalism is ,
a belief in the dignity and funda- I
mental integrity of mankind, in the
knowledge that progress is neces- !
sary, inevitable, and desirable." And
(2) "that all mankind shall he po
litically, economically, and spiritu
ally able to enjoy the fruits of the
earth." Which is quite different
from what Recce and Taft said.
C.M.: Certainly, liberalism in
eludes a progressive outlook but I ;
think Senator Ball places the em- j
phasis in a much better way. "The .
objective of political liberals," Ball j
declares, '"is to assure the greatest j
degree of economic and political i
freedom for all individuals. The
goal in the economic field is toward ]
individual opportunity. We seek a
system under which every individ- i
ual has an opportunity to develop J
his own capacities to the limit com- |
patible with the same freedom for j
all other individuals. Liberalism i
does not. favor class interests or j
adoption of radical changes."
OUR LIBERALISM
R.H.: Well then, what really is :
liberalism? I think the term must j
be broken down. In regard to art,
literature, theology, and social rela
tions, liberalism implies a departure
from the ways of tradition, a dis
sent against, the status quo.
When it comes to political liberal- j
ism. it implies the upholding of in
dividual freedom, it protests against j
authoritarian rule. The liberal re- !
fuses 1o impose his judgment upon j
others or force them to live their j
lives according to his ideas rather j
than their own.
Coming to economic liberalism, it ,
is insisted that people be allowed to j
develop their natural capacities and \
attain better living conditions di- j
rectly rather than having it done I
for them by a self-regarding group. |
In political liberalism, civil liberties
and representative government, are
the key factors. Economically, di
rect effort and immediate better
ment leading to economic security
arc the key factors.
DISAGREEMENT
This is where I disagree with Taft ;
and Reece. They discuss freedom j
but omit economic security. I think i
liberalism includes both and I clas
sify Recce and Taft as conservatives
—or reactionaries.
C.M.: Your first point # agrees with
my thesis that too great concentra- i
tions of political power are dan
gerous to our freedom—hence anti
liberal. The authoritarian in poli
tics is the one who believes that a
particular group (whether it be in j
government, labor, or business) has j
a special mission to plan the whole

pattern of soci
ety and to re
quire all indi
viduals. whether
they like it or
not, to fit into
that pattern. Au
thoritarians may
be very well
meaning people
who want noth
ing more than to
do good for ev
eryone.
And as for the:
second point, the
primary goal ol

liberals is not complete economic
security for all, but the maximum
degree of equality of opportunity
for all in the economic field, with an
insistence that measures to achieve
this goal must expand rather than
curtail individual freedoms.
In the liberal approach it is the
government's obligation to make
sure that every individual has a
fair and equal opportunity to
achieve his own economic destiny,
and thus leave it up to the individ
ual. The most secure individual in
our society is a prisoner serving a
life sentence, but lie is hardly free.
Don't confuse economic security
with freedom.
To me. liberalism is a deep-lying
mental attitude which attempts in
the light of its suppositions, to ana
lyze and integrate the varied intel
lectual. moral, religious, economic
and political relationships of human
society. The liberal must be pro-

DANGERS OF LIBERALISM
Liberals cannot overlook the dan
gers which still exist on the extreme
political right, the chief of which is
economic monopoly. But let'.s also
face the fact that the great threat to
freedom today is not from the po
litical right but from the extreme
political left. Liberalism must be an
aggressive philosophy to resist the
juggernaut of world totalitarian
thoug'ht.
YOUR LIBERALISM
R.H.: Well, Chuck, there are a
few things you've said that may be
debated further but there is no
more space here. We have agreed
that liberalism upholds individual
freedom and aims toward individual
economic opportunity. It seems,
however, that the world is hell-bent
for economic security — which is
what we want. But will this eco
nomic security be gained at the
expense of civil liberties?
How about you, reader? Would
you be willing to go hungry in
order to be free?

DANGERS OF LIBERALISM
Liberals cannot overlook the dan
gers which still exist on the extreme
political right, the chief of which is
economic monopoly. But let'.s also
face the fact that the great threat to
freedom today is not from the po
litical right but from the extreme
political left. Liberalism must be an
aggressive philosophy to resist the
juggernaut of world totalitarian
thoug'ht.
YOUR LIBERALISM
R.H.: Well, Chuck, there are a
few things you've said that may be
debated further but there is no
more space here. We have agreed
that liberalism upholds individual
freedom and aims toward individual
economic opportunity. It seems,
however, that the world is hell-bent
for economic security — which is
what we want. But will this eco
nomic security be gained at the
expense of civil liberties?
How about you, reader? Would
you be willing to go hungry in
order to be free?
WIIO IS A LIBERAL?
C.M.: Oh. no! Not you again?
R.H.: Yep. And you know why.
It's time to write one of those things
again.
C.M.: Already yet. I haven't got
ten over that one last week. Let's
.see, we said we'd say something
about what liberalism is. Well,
we're both liberals but what kind?
Let's clear that up. Taft, Wallace,
Hoover, Pepper, Stassen, and Mead
all call themselves liberals. What
th'ell is a liberal then?
R.H.: Well, Carrol Reece, GOP
chairman, calls himself a liberal.
He says that government is best
which governs least, that a liberal
government is one of limited pow
ers; a government bound to respect
certain inalienable rights of the in
dividual. I don't call Reece a lib
eral. I believe there is much more
to liberalism than that.
C.M.: In popular usage the CIO-
I'ACE and the new ICPA (oh bells,
it's now the PCA) and other profes
sional "liberals" don't come under
my classification of liberals either.
TAFT A LIBERAL
R.H.: But neither is your Taft the
in i t. . ii .

liberal he calls
himself. To him,
a liberal is "one
who believes in
freedom and op

unless such re

ther states, "If

freedom, the whole basis of the phi
losophy would collapse. One cannot
be a liberal unless he opposes such
suggestions. But today, those who
advocate change are utterly intoler
ant of everyone who opposes their

By Taft's standards of liberalism,
1 must agree with him—as far as he
goes. But by my own standards I
call both Recce and Taft conserva
tives.
C.M.: Since you agree with Taft.
by his standards, I'll have to agree
with FDR. The late President Roo
sevelt believed that it was his sworn
duty to take all steps necessary to
insure the continuance of liberalism
and yet the means he used to achieve
his ends were definitely illiberal.
He said that the liberal party is one
which believes that, as new condi
tions and problems arise beyond the
power of men and women to meet
as individuals, it becomes the duly
of the government itself to find now
remedies with which to meet them.
With this, I'm in agreement; it is old
Republican philosophy.
This theory of the role of govern
ment was expressed by Abe Lin
coln when he said, "The legitimate
object of government is to do for
;i community of people whatever
they need to have done, but cannot
do at all, or cannot do so well, for
themselves, in their separate and
individual capacities."
R.li.: Don't forget t at FDR also
said the liberal party insists that
government has the duty to use all
.— i

its powers and resources to meet
new social problems with new so
cial controls—to insure to the aver
age person the right to his own eco
nomic and political life, liberty, and
pursuit of happiness.
MEAD A LIBERAL
Ex-Senator Mead supports this i
idea, saying that (1) "Liberalism is ,
a belief in the dignity and funda- I
mental integrity of mankind, in the
knowledge that progress is neces- !
sary, inevitable, and desirable." And
(2) "that all mankind shall he po
litically, economically, and spiritu
ally able to enjoy the fruits of the
earth." Which is quite different
from what Recce and Taft said.
C.M.: Certainly, liberalism in
eludes a progressive outlook but I ;
think Senator Ball places the em- j
phasis in a much better way. "The .
objective of political liberals," Ball j
declares, '"is to assure the greatest j
degree of economic and political i
freedom for all individuals. The
goal in the economic field is toward ]
individual opportunity. We seek a
system under which every individ- i
ual has an opportunity to develop J
his own capacities to the limit com- |
patible with the same freedom for j
all other individuals. Liberalism i
does not. favor class interests or j
adoption of radical changes."
OUR LIBERALISM
R.H.: Well then, what really is :
liberalism? I think the term must j
be broken down. In regard to art,
literature, theology, and social rela
tions, liberalism implies a departure
from the ways of tradition, a dis
sent against, the status quo.
When it comes to political liberal- j
ism. it implies the upholding of in
dividual freedom, it protests against j
authoritarian rule. The liberal re- !
fuses 1o impose his judgment upon j
others or force them to live their j
lives according to his ideas rather j
than their own.
Coming to economic liberalism, it ,
is insisted that people be allowed to j
develop their natural capacities and \
attain better living conditions di- j
rectly rather than having it done I
for them by a self-regarding group. |
In political liberalism, civil liberties
and representative government, are
the key factors. Economically, di
rect effort and immediate better
ment leading to economic security
arc the key factors.
DISAGREEMENT
This is where I disagree with Taft ;
and Reece. They discuss freedom j
but omit economic security. I think i
liberalism includes both and I clas
sify Recce and Taft as conservatives
—or reactionaries.
C.M.: Your first point # agrees with
my thesis that too great concentra- i
tions of political power are dan
gerous to our freedom—hence anti
liberal. The authoritarian in poli
tics is the one who believes that a
particular group (whether it be in j
government, labor, or business) has j
a special mission to plan the whole

pattern of soci
ety and to re
quire all indi
viduals. whether
they like it or
not, to fit into
that pattern. Au
thoritarians may
be very well
meaning people
who want noth
ing more than to
do good for ev
eryone.
And as for the:
second point, the
primary goal ol

liberals is not complete economic
security for all, but the maximum

DANGERS OF LIBERALISM
Liberals cannot overlook the dan
gers which still exist on the extreme
political right, the chief of which is
economic monopoly. But let'.s also
face the fact that the great threat to
freedom today is not from the po

aggressive philosophy to resist the
juggernaut of world totalitarian
thoug'ht.
YOUR LIBERALISM
R.H.: Well, Chuck, there are a
few things you've said that may be
debated further but there is no
more space here. We have agreed
that liberalism upholds individual
freedom and aims toward individual
economic opportunity. It seems,
however, that the world is hell-bent
for economic security — which is
what we want. But will this eco
nomic security be gained at the
expense of civil liberties?
How about you, reader? Would
you be willing to go hungry in
order to be free?
WIIO IS A LIBERAL?
C.M.: Oh. no! Not you again?
R.H.: Yep. And you know why.
It's time to write one of those things
again.
C.M.: Already yet. I haven't got
ten over that one last week. Let's
.see, we said we'd say something
about what liberalism is. Well,
we're both liberals but what kind?
Let's clear that up. Taft, Wallace,
Hoover, Pepper, Stassen, and Mead
all call themselves liberals. What
th'ell is a liberal then?
R.H.: Well, Carrol Reece, GOP
chairman, calls himself a liberal.
He says that government is best
which governs least, that a liberal
government is one of limited pow
ers; a government bound to respect
certain inalienable rights of the in
dividual. I don't call Reece a lib
eral. I believe there is much more
to liberalism than that.
C.M.: In popular usage the CIO-
I'ACE and the new ICPA (oh bells,
it's now the PCA) and other profes
sional "liberals" don't come under
my classification of liberals either.
TAFT A LIBERAL
R.H.: But neither is your Taft the

a liberal is "one

By Taft's standards of liberalism,

with FDR. The late President Roo

insure the continuance of liberalism
and yet the means he used to achieve
his ends were definitely illiberal.
He said that the liberal party is one
which believes that, as new condi
tions and problems arise beyond the
power of men and women to meet
as individuals, it becomes the duly
of the government itself to find now
remedies with which to meet them.
With this, I'm in agreement; it is old
Republican philosophy.
This theory of the role of govern

they need to have done, but cannot

R.li.: Don't forget t at FDR also
said the liberal party insists that
government has the duty to use all
.— i

its powers and resources to meet
new social problems with new so
cial controls—to insure to the aver
age person the right to his own eco

pursuit of happiness.
MEAD A LIBERAL
Ex-Senator Mead supports this i
idea, saying that (1) "Liberalism is ,
a belief in the dignity and funda- I
mental integrity of mankind, in the
knowledge that progress is neces- !
sary, inevitable, and desirable." And
(2) "that all mankind shall he po
litically, economically, and spiritu
ally able to enjoy the fruits of the
earth." Which is quite different
from what Recce and Taft said.
C.M.: Certainly, liberalism in
eludes a progressive outlook but I ;
think Senator Ball places the em- j
phasis in a much better way. "The .
objective of political liberals," Ball j
declares, '"is to assure the greatest j
degree of economic and political i
freedom for all individuals. The
goal in the economic field is toward ]
individual opportunity. We seek a
system under which every individ- i
ual has an opportunity to develop J
his own capacities to the limit com- |
patible with the same freedom for j
all other individuals. Liberalism i
does not. favor class interests or j
adoption of radical changes."
OUR LIBERALISM
R.H.: Well then, what really is :
liberalism? I think the term must j
be broken down. In regard to art,
literature, theology, and social rela
tions, liberalism implies a departure
from the ways of tradition, a dis
sent against, the status quo.
When it comes to political liberal- j
ism. it implies the upholding of in

authoritarian rule. The liberal re- !

a belief in the dignity and funda- I
mental integrity of mankind, in the

(2) "that all mankind shall he po

ally able to enjoy the fruits of the
earth." Which is quite different
from what Recce and Taft said.
C.M.: Certainly, liberalism in
eludes a progressive outlook but I ;
think Senator Ball places the em- j
phasis in a much better way. "The .
objective of political liberals," Ball j
declares, '"is to assure the greatest j
degree of economic and political i
freedom for all individuals. The

liberalism? I think the term must j

When it comes to political liberal- j

than their own.
Coming to economic liberalism, it ,
is insisted that people be allowed to j
develop their natural capacities and \
attain better living conditions di- j
rectly rather than having it done I
for them by a self-regarding group. |
In political liberalism, civil liberties
and representative government, are
the key factors. Economically, di
rect effort and immediate better
ment leading to economic security
arc the key factors.
DISAGREEMENT
This is where I disagree with Taft ;
and Reece. They discuss freedom j
but omit economic security. I think i
liberalism includes both and I clas
sify Recce and Taft as conservatives

C.M.: Your first point # agrees with
my thesis that too great concentra- i
tions of political power are dan
gerous to our freedom—hence anti
liberal. The authoritarian in poli
tics is the one who believes that a
particular group (whether it be in j
government, labor, or business) has j
a special mission to plan the whole

pattern of soci

quire all indi

they like it or

DANGERS OF LIBERALISM
Liberals cannot overlook the dan
gers which still exist on the extreme
political right, the chief of which is
economic monopoly. But let'.s also
face the fact that the great threat to
freedom today is not from the po
litical right but from the extreme
political left. Liberalism must be an
aggressive philosophy to resist the
juggernaut of world totalitarian
thoug'ht.
YOUR LIBERALISM
R.H.: Well, Chuck, there are a
few things you've said that may be
debated further but there is no
more space here. We have agreed
that liberalism upholds individual
freedom and aims toward individual
economic opportunity. It seems,
however, that the world is hell-bent
for economic security — which is
what we want. But will this eco
nomic security be gained at the
expense of civil liberties?
How about you, reader? Would
you be willing to go hungry in
order to be free?
WIIO IS A LIBERAL?
C.M.: Oh. no! Not you again?
R.H.: Yep. And you know why.
It's time to write one of those things
again.
C.M.: Already yet. I haven't got
ten over that one last week. Let's
.see, we said we'd say something
about what liberalism is. Well,
we're both liberals but what kind?
Let's clear that up. Taft, Wallace,
Hoover, Pepper, Stassen, and Mead
all call themselves liberals. What
th'ell is a liberal then?
R.H.: Well, Carrol Reece, GOP
chairman, calls himself a liberal.
He says that government is best
which governs least, that a liberal
government is one of limited pow
ers; a government bound to respect
certain inalienable rights of the in
dividual. I don't call Reece a lib
eral. I believe there is much more
to liberalism than that.
C.M.: In popular usage the CIO-
I'ACE and the new ICPA (oh bells,
it's now the PCA) and other profes
sional "liberals" don't come under
my classification of liberals either.
TAFT A LIBERAL
R.H.: But neither is your Taft the
in i t. . ii .

liberal he calls
himself. To him,
a liberal is "one
who believes in
freedom and op
poses measures
which restrict it,
unless such re
strictions are ab
solutely neces
sary to preserve
• the freedom of
s othei's." Taft fur
ther states, "If
any proposals
k are made under
the name of lib-

era I ism 'which would destroy that
freedom, the whole basis of the phi
losophy would collapse. One cannot
be a liberal unless he opposes such
suggestions. But today, those who
advocate change are utterly intoler
ant of everyone who opposes their
ide:..->. 1
By Taft's standards of liberalism,
1 must agree with him—as far as he
goes. But by my own standards I
call both Recce and Taft conserva
tives.
C.M.: Since you agree with Taft.
by his standards, I'll have to agree
with FDR. The late President Roo
sevelt believed that it was his sworn
duty to take all steps necessary to
insure the continuance of liberalism
and yet the means he used to achieve
his ends were definitely illiberal.
He said that the liberal party is one
which believes that, as new condi
tions and problems arise beyond the
power of men and women to meet
as individuals, it becomes the duly
of the government itself to find now
remedies with which to meet them.
With this, I'm in agreement; it is old
Republican philosophy.
This theory of the role of govern
ment was expressed by Abe Lin
coln when he said, "The legitimate
object of government is to do for
;i community of people whatever
they need to have done, but cannot
do at all, or cannot do so well, for
themselves, in their separate and
individual capacities."
R.li.: Don't forget t at FDR also
said the liberal party insists that
government has the duty to use all
.— i

its powers and resources to meet
new social problems with new so
cial controls—to insure to the aver
age person the right to his own eco
nomic and political life, liberty, and
pursuit of happiness.
