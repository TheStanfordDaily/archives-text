###

posal of allowing money expenditures for electioneering, and in
a unanimous vote made swimming a major sport after appointing
a committee to clarify requirements for a major sport and make

The electioneering proposal as
presented by Gordon Ness, Elec -
tion Board chairman, would allow

presidential and vice-presidential
candidates and a $10 maximum for
all other candidates. A suh-coni

cord and check-up on all expen
ditures made. The proposal will
he presented to the students for ;t
vote on (he Feb. 5 ballot.
Frank Creede, Toyon Excom rep
resentative, read a report from
Toyon residents who were against
money expenditures for campaign
ing, fearing the promotion of ine
qualities among candidates. A.S.S.U.
President Martin Anderson said that.
posters and printed matter put out
by individual candidates would not
promote intelligent voting but would
be just a matter of who can best put
his name before the public. He sut!~
gested talks over KSU, an election
assembly to introduce the candi
dates, and/or the printing of plat
forms in the Daily.
Men's How representative Carl
Burke asked (bat money expendi
tures be tried for one or two quar
ters. He said that KSU is not wired
t» many living groups and few
persons listen. Also an all-campus
assembly catches only a small per
centage of the students.
The majority of Excom members
felt dial, although more intensive
electioneering is desirable, the an
swer does not lie in spending money
for the purpose. It was suggested
that candidates do more speaking
to living groups.
Swimming was made a major
sport on die basis of growing inter
est arid spectator popularity and the
facts thai .swimming is a major sport
in most colleges, and that the team
competes in national meets.
Emmet Cashin, speaking for the
swim team, said that we have a
good team now and want to attract
high school swimmers to Stanford
rather than some other school. II
is expected thai swimming will
pay for itself, he said. He and
Frank Creede make tip the com
mittee appointed to talk to A!
Masters, S.A.C. director, on major
sport requirements.

tion that Anderson write a letter to

ation for the crew to purchase the
surplus equipment from Sacramento
