# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Ex-Comment 
### 
Okay. So for five editorials the Daily has
been hitting the international scene and Stan
hud's responsibilities and has attempted to
suggest a plan which no doubt has alternately
bored, confused, angered and pleased readers.
And in the meantime other campus indi
viduals and groups equally as interested in
futthering "international co-operation and un
derstanding" have also thought and produced
suggestions and plans.
So by now you probably want to know in a
brief form exactly into what all the talk
• uid print resolves.
Niel Allen, chairman of the ISC, visualizes
plan whereby year round participation in in
national activities would be made possible
<y (1) ISC reports ?n tall quarter; ISC choosing
i-i winter qusitei; International Institute in
.fil ing quarter; (2; bi weekly discussion gioups
iliroughout the year; (3) ISC, NSO < nd Institute
c (> ordinafed under Lxcom
I'll. D.iily has sugg. sted a plan m which
111«- In. t step would be I estabiish an interna
tional coordinating committee directly under
bxcom which would be responsible for the
three divisions of the campus international
< /fort: social, practical, and educational.
Under the "social" grouping would be in
cluded various organizations such as the "Y,"
International Club, language clubs, Vocom,
etc., which could be or are directly or indi
rectly connected with international affairs.
The "practical" grouping would include two
subsidiary committees which would (1) take

care of the paper work in finding job oppor
tunities and job contacts for Stanford students
wishing to work abroad; and (2) take care of
paper work on information on universities
abroad—their requirements, social contacts,
fees, methods of application, living conditions
and other details.
Co-ordination between classroom and ex
tra-curricular thoughts and actions in the inter
national field would lie in the "educational"
grouping and could certainly be improved
through large-scale co-operation between fac
ulty and students. .
The ISC would serve as an outstanding pivot
of accomplished learning which the chosen
students would exemplify and pass on to stu
dents, who are more enlightened through the
campus wide organization.
It is obvious that a rigid classification of
inese groups would be impossible, since so
cial groups serve an educational purpose and
vice veisa, but t ,e classification would serve
loi more organised piesentation to the campus.
The Daily believes one ot the most impor
tant parts ot an expanded international pro
gram should be the co-ordination of classroom
and extra-curricular activities and will present
lurther information on this following inter
views with faculty members.
With much thought and many plans brought
forth before Excom, Excom should find itself
with an opportunity to sift out the worthwhile
ideas and institute a really worthy synthesized
program. It's up to the students and Excom.
