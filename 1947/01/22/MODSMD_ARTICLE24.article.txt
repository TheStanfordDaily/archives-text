# BULL SESSION
## 
### ED WILSON 
Those movie-lovers who sat in the Mem Aucl last
Sunday rii>*hl agree that a man going through the
audience selling rotten eggs would've cleaned up.
'I lie unusually large crowd at the Sunday Evening
Scries was undoubtedly occasioned by the world
premiere ol' Chapter One of "The Phantom City,"
starring Gene Autry.
The movie was shot by Mascot Pictures, but Gene
Aulry, Franki<> Darro and a lew equally untaJented
horses all helped to make it one of the most shot
I irlun s of the year (the year 1£32). There were
lines in the movie which never should have left a
Ivr i'Wi'iter. In fact, the best lines all evening were
l lose ol the red-head who sat down two rows in
IVont of me.
The first chapter of the serial was called ' The
Singing Cowboy," named in honor of Gene Autry
who has a voice like asthma set to music—or may
be like a sea-gull with its leg caught. Gene, the
owner of a little hacienda in the West called "Radio
Uanch," is unpopular with the local women because
bis cow-bands are so rough (the ideal time for a
plug for Lux soap). His friend, Frankie Darro, is
somewhat of a cowboy wizard. After taking a cor
respondence course with the Stanford physics de
partment, Frankie develops a radio direction-find
er. While demonstrating it.the direction-finder
suddenly points straight down. Actually, the finder
is being affected by the hot-foot Frankie's sister
has just slipped him, but Frankie thinks it is guid
ing him to an underground kingdom's broadcasting
station—which just goes to show that Frankie
doesn't know his azimuth from a bole in the
ground. In spare time, Frankie is the organizer
of a teen-age version of the Ku Klux Klan called
the "Tbunderbirds."

Murania, the scientific city of the future, is ac
tually located some 50,000 feet underground, which
explains why all the actors in the picture look like
underground characters. A refugee from the Stan
ford history department discovers one of the under
ground masked marvels on the surface of the earth
he has just come up for a breath of fresh air—and
he takes a shot (the camera doesn't actually show
him taking a shot, but we hope to hell he was smart
enough to bring along his own bottle). The Muraniari
and his waiting buddies escape to the hidden eleva
tor and yell to the operator: "Basement!" One of
the men-of-the-future tries to. get off at 20,000 feet—
"Lingerie, girdles, black nightgowns"—but his bud
dies convince him that they've got something better
iri the basement.
The thing they've got in the cellar is the queen
of the city of tomorrow, which just goes to prove
(hat sex will outlive us all. Queenie has all the
charm, innocence and simplicity of the Racing
Form. Her biggest asset (besides a contract with
Mascot) is a wonderful post-war model of a push
button television set. The set is operated by an
other underground character who persists in get
ting the wrong station and the audience sees the
lirst four races at Santa Anita before he finally lo
cales Gene Autry—he was riding a long-shot in the
fifth.
Chapter One ends with the Singing Cowboy sing
ing the blues as he and his two companions fall off a
cliff—or was it a bluff? Come to think of it, the
whole thing was a bluff, but don't let that stop you
from missing Chapter 2 next Sunday night.
To our knowledge, this picture is Mascot's first
release. It may be of interest to know that next timo
Mascot is going to release the actors and hold the
picture.

'I lie unusually large crowd at the Sunday Evening
Scries was undoubtedly occasioned by the world
premiere ol' Chapter One of "The Phantom City,"
starring Gene Autry.
The movie was shot by Mascot Pictures, but Gene
Aulry, Franki<> Darro and a lew equally untaJented
horses all helped to make it one of the most shot
I irlun s of the year (the year 1£32). There were
lines in the movie which never should have left a
Ivr i'Wi'iter. In fact, the best lines all evening were
l lose ol the red-head who sat down two rows in
IVont of me.
The first chapter of the serial was called ' The
Singing Cowboy," named in honor of Gene Autry
who has a voice like asthma set to music—or may
be like a sea-gull with its leg caught. Gene, the
owner of a little hacienda in the West called "Radio
Uanch," is unpopular with the local women because
bis cow-bands are so rough (the ideal time for a
plug for Lux soap). His friend, Frankie Darro, is
somewhat of a cowboy wizard. After taking a cor
respondence course with the Stanford physics de
partment, Frankie develops a radio direction-find
er. While demonstrating it.the direction-finder
suddenly points straight down. Actually, the finder
is being affected by the hot-foot Frankie's sister
has just slipped him, but Frankie thinks it is guid
ing him to an underground kingdom's broadcasting
station—which just goes to show that Frankie
doesn't know his azimuth from a bole in the
ground. In spare time, Frankie is the organizer
of a teen-age version of the Ku Klux Klan called
the "Tbunderbirds."

Murania, the scientific city of the future, is ac
tually located some 50,000 feet underground, which
explains why all the actors in the picture look like
underground characters. A refugee from the Stan
ford history department discovers one of the under
ground masked marvels on the surface of the earth
he has just come up for a breath of fresh air—and
he takes a shot (the camera doesn't actually show
him taking a shot, but we hope to hell he was smart
enough to bring along his own bottle). The Muraniari
and his waiting buddies escape to the hidden eleva
