## HISTORY 1947 
### 
Those among you who may have given some
thought to the wartime organization of this country
probably were glad to read in last week's papers
that the aimed lorces had been unified by executive
"I'd •i". Well, yon public-spirited citizens have doubt-
I- ss gathered by now that that alleged "unification"
is as bad as and probably worse than the existing
division of comnrtind-.
•! Moxt; people, public-spirited 01 not', yre-aware that
'the )'resident is- constitutionally cc>nnriondcr-in-(hiH
ol our armed forces. On that level we have unity of
rouunand! Next below him, there are two cabinet
officials, the Secretary of War and the Secretary of
the Navy. In George Washington's cabinet, we had
only a Secretary oi War, but the authority was
divided afterward. There is, under the War Depart
ment, the Army, that is, some of the ground forces,
some ol the service forces, and some of the air forces.
Under the Navy Department, we find the sea forces,
the rest of the service forces, the rest of the ground
forces (the Marine Corps, remember), and the rest
of the air forces. The Marines are really autonomous,
having tlrt'ir own air and service forces, which
doesn't make it any simpler.
Now, what does the "unification" order add to this
rrupulous separation of related functions? It sets
the Army Air Forces aside as a separate adminis
trative unit, but leaves the Navy and Marine air
arms under the Navy Department. It makes the
Joint Chiels of Staff, a temporary organization de
veloped, for want of anything better, during the
recent war. another and permanent rung in hte
ladder. It proposes an additional Secretary for the
Air Force, equal with what it would call Secretaries
of the Navy and Army, and with them a "Council
of National Defense." Over nil this vast and won
derful mechanism, in the construction of which Rube
Goldberg must surely have been consulted, we have
a single Secretary of National Defense. It is fortu
nate that it will take an Act of Congress to put
this latest "Missouri Compromise" into effect.
To just stand on the sidelines and criticize is
simply not done these days; I must participate. So
1 will offer a few simple suggestions, although I am
I idly aware that they may turn out to be even more
simple than they seem to me. The staff organization

of the Army is generally quadripartite: personnel,
intelligence, plans and training, and supply. I am
totally ignorant of the Navy's internal arrangements,
but, without insisting on its perfection, the Army
set-up will do for discussion. Why would it. not be
possible and desirable to organize one Department
ol War. or National Defense, or something with ono
division in charge of personnel procurement and
administration, one—and let the State Department,
sit in on this- in charge of intelligence, one planning
agency for the armed forces, and one designing and
procuring equipment and other supplies?
The competition between the services for per
sonnel was an obvious weakness in the recent war.
Most of you will remember the different reserve
plans, the different inducements, the different re
quirements, and the dim figure of the draft board
looming up behind them all. Next, intelligence. Do
not let the fanfare and whoop-de-do set up by the
movies lead you to ignore the practical value of
th? OSS; the need for and effectiveness of a central
intelligence agency has been well demonstrated.
For planning, we can point to the Joint Chiefs of
Staff. We had to create a central planning committee
for the late war, and it seems obvious that we should
continue to have one. It also seems obvious that it
would be substantially more efficient if it were in
any form except that of a committee. As far as sup
ply goes, we finally reached some kind of over-all
policy through the WPB and the Joint Chiefs to
gether. Those who remember the wooden-gun ma
neuvers, the OPM, the SPAB, and the rest of the
general confusion of 1941 and 1942 ought to agree
that a permanent and unified body ought to be ready
to deal with this problem, too.
Some will disagree with the whole program on
the grounds of tradition. Well, I'm a Republican,
but you can't win a war on tradition. Some will say
that we can't have generals commanding battleships
Well, we had theater commanders in the recent
conflict, both generals and admirals, who com
manded all arms and services in their theaters and
did quite well, too. Then there are those who would
not like to s°e a unified, stripped-down military
organization l>ocnu.se so many of the deserving bras."-
might lose their job. Well!
