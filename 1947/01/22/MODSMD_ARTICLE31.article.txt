### DON DAVIES 
Don't shove the Stanford basket
ball team into the conference cellar
.mil close the door. The Indians j
haven't been playing cellar ball, and
lis hard to picture the hard-driving, i
high-spirited Cards at the bottom of '
anybody's list. Experts say that the !
competition in the PCC Southern j
Division has never been tougher, but
the Cards have already proven that I
they are capable of fighting it out !
on even terms with the best of the
conference super teams.
Losing three out of four of their I
initial league tilts could conceivably !
hurt the team's spirit, but those boys j
aren't going to curl up and get kick
ed around by Berkeley, Westwood,
Troy or anybody else.
Coach Everett Dean and the whole |
Indian squad is disappointed but
not discouraged over the double I
loss to the Berkeley Bombers. Look- j
inj4 at the statistics of the Cal series
the picture begins to brighten up. j
STARTLING STATISTICS
For example, in the two-game se- j
lies Stanford took a total of 151 '
shots, making 31 baskets for a 22.5 j
per cent mark, while the Bears tried
148 shots, racking up 33 field goals !
for a 22.3 per cent average.
Breaking these figures down, in j
the Friday contest the Cards shot |
74 times, for 18 field goals and an j
average of 24.3 per cent, while the
Bears were held to 16 field goals out
of 80 tries, or an average of 20 per
cent. And still the Cards lost. In
Saturday's game the Farm quintet
sank 1(! buckets in 77 tries, which
is a 20.8 per cent average. The siz
zling Berkeleyites poured in 17 or I
25 per cent of their 68 shots.
On the error side of the ledger I
the Indians were also superior. In
the lirst game, Stanford had posses
sion of the ball 86 different times j
and committed only 7 errors. Er- |
rors included fumbles, bad passes, J
travelling, and otherwise losing the
ball through a miscue. The same
the Strawberry Canyon Su
permen had the ball 99 times, com- j
mitting 12 errors. And still the Cards i
lost. Saturday night it was the same j
story. The Indians errored only 8
times in 96 times with the ball,
while Cal miscued 11 times in 96
trips.
FOULED IT
The Deanmen outfieldgoaled the |
Bears, they made less errors and i
still they lost both games. Why? |
The answer is in the free throw de
partment. It wasn't the Indians in- j
ability to sink the foul shots, it was !
the Bears' amazing accuracy. In the !
series Stanford was charged with 31
personal fouls, Cal with 21. Stan
ford tried 24 free throws, made 14,
for a pretty fair average of 58.3 per 1
cent. But Nibs Price's charges loop
ed in a total of 29 gratis tosses out
of 40 chances, for a terrific 72.5 per
cent mark.
After the underrated Cards nearly
upset the Bears on Friday night,
Farm rooters hoped for a victory
Saturday night. Stanford played a
good game, but Cal played an un
beatable game.
A PAT ON THE BACK
Everett Dean had this .to say:
â€¢Stanford did not play a poor game
Saturday night, it was Cal's "super
vanie" that decided the contest. Only
once before have the Bears shown
this superman brand of basketball 1
and that was several weeks ago
when they defeated the Whiz Kids
from Illinois." j
Mr. Dean has nothing but praise
for his boys and their showing
against Cal. '"The Stanford team
never once let up in the face of un
beatable basketball. It is a pleasure
; nil a privilege to work with a squad j
that gives its best against over- ;
whelming odds and a difficult sched
ule."
And that's a real pat on the back, j
boys, coming from a gentleman who j
really knows his basketball.
( ARDS ON WAV UP
llow are the Cards going to do the ;
rest of (he season? Mr. Dean thinks !
they have improved immensely and j
will keep on improving. Cal is by
no means a cinch for the conference
gonfalon. They have their foot in [
the door but they face a tough away
from-home schedule in the next few
weeks that may change the whole I
picture.
OPEN THE DOOR, RICHARD!
The three - way fight everybody
predicted may develop into a four
team scrap with the Indians right |
up there knocking on the door.
