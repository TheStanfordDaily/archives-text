## 
### 
Stanford's hard-working mat crew
is in line for more experience—and
mote groans—when it journeys over
to Berkeley to face a powerful Bear
mat crew next Thursday evening
at 8.
The Cal wrestling lineup is headed
by a couple of Far Western cham
pions, which means that Coach
Vein Jones' proteges have their
work cut out for them as they set
out to upset the dope sheet. As fur
ther evidence of the Cal power, the
Bears handed San Jose a 26 to 6
thrashing last week.
At any rate, "we'll give Cal a good
battle," says Jones. "The boys are
still pretty green, but they'll put up
a lot better show than they did last
time out."
