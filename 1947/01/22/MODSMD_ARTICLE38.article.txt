CLEVELAND, Jan. 21 (UP).â€”
Pitcher Bobby Feller, flashing a grin
as wide as his windup, signed a 1947
contract for the Cleveland Indians
today that is virtually certain to net
him $85,000 and make him the high
est-paid baseball player of all time
Feller, number one glamour boy
of baseball's second golden era. will
be paid a basic salary of about $55,-
000 and will receive an attendance
bonus that is expected to reach $30,-
000 which would give him $85,000
for a year's work.
His boss, Bill Veeek, who like
Feller was a combat hero of World
War 11. said that "Feller definitely
can earn more than $80,000 this
year if we come close to a million
fans at the gate."
