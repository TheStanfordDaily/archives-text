# Movies Show Rare Condor
## 
### 
The closest and most detailed pic
tures ever taken of the California
Condor were shown last night on
the Tuesday Evening Series pro-
Krnm in Memorial Hall auditorium
bv Dr. Telford Work.
Colored movies showing the life
of this largest and rarest of the
world's flying birds attracted an au
dience of townspeople, Palo Alto
school children, and a sprinkling of
Stanford students.
Thought to be extinct only a few
years ago, the condor lives in the
extremely inaccessible Los Padres
National Forest in Southern Cali
fornia. It was there that. Dr. Work,
Dr. Harold M. Hill, and Albert J.
Wool—all Stanford alumni — made
the exclusive shots of the condor.
Locating a nest of the giant bird
in a rock cave, the men made a de
tailed study of the nest life of a
young condor. Their movie showed
the development of the bird from
an egg s : 'h inches long into a scven
months-old fledgling.
The title of Dr. Work's Illustrated
lecture was "Avian Giant of Ancient
Skies." He explained that in ancient
times the bird ranged along the en
tire Pacific Coast and that it preyed
on animals caught in the La Brca
tar pits.
Full-grown condors have a wing
spread of 10 feet and weigh 20 to
25 pounds, according to Dr. Work.
Only through strict isolation from
any humans—the 60-100 birds now
left in existence are a sad remnant
of the thousands which ranged from
British Columbia to Lower Califor
nia 150 years ago—can the condor
be saved from complete extinction,
Dr. Work said.—Haight
