### SUE ENGELHARD 
Stanford's Art Gallery reopened yesterday with two exhibits
entitled "Prints by European and American Masters" and "Wood
carvings and Toys From the Index of American Design."
The latter exhibit is a group of watercolors of toys and wood
carvings of the 18th and 19th centuries. The paintings are done

in minute detail and are colorful
examples of America's craftsman
ship. They include pictures of dolls,
toy trains, statues and heads, and the
art is so skillful that the paintings
appear to be three dimensional.
The watercolors are a WPA art
project and were done by artists
employed by the WPA.

printing has been to art, for in re
producing originals more people
