# Prices Down In '47â€”Spurr
## 
### 
The average family will pay 5 to
10 per cent less in 1947, forecast
William A. Spurr, economist and
business statistician at the Stanford
Graduate School of Business, in a
talk to the Palo Alto Credit Union
Monday evening.
"What will keep it from becom
ing a major depression," he said,
"is that durable goods will con
tinue to rise, in production and
probably in price. It is the dur
able goods which fluctuate wildly
and cause depressions; the reces
sion in the nondurable goods in
dustries will decline steadily."
Pointing to the sharp break in the
prices of some articles of women's
clothing, he said, "If you hold off
the chances are you'll find lower
prices and possibly better quality
later on."
Men's clothing, he predicted, will
probably be hard to get through
the spring and summer, with some
prospect that prices will be off
slightly by fall.
As to automobiles, Mr. Spurr said
the manufacturers will probably
continue to step up production. "If
you want a new car this year you
will probably get it.'' he said, "but
it will probably be a pre-war mod
el. The really new designs won't
be out for a year or two yet."
