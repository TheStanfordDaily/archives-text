# Dartmouth Starts Self-Government; Beer Tradition in Campus Taproom
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
If the Stanford ski team flys East
this February to the Dartmouth
Winter Carnival, they will find a
college just beginning its experi
i ment in student self-government
—and a school where they can
pick up a beer in the campus tap
room.
CAMPUS TAVERN
The campus taproom is the pride
lof all Dartmouth Indians. (Yes, the
| Ivy League has its Indians too.) The
I taproom in the basement of College
| Hall serves snacks, soft drinks, and
the traditional beer. Not content
with one tavern, the school recently
added an annex. Indicative of stu
! dent comment on the new addition
, were the words of an undergraduate
, published in "The Dartmouth," the
| campus daily. He said, "I hope that
I this will mean that inhaling some
i thing besides beer and smoke will be
possible, and that I'll be able to see
the person I'm drinking with."
Last October, headlines in "The
Dartmouth" proclaimed that, for
the lirst time in the school's his
tory, the Board of Trustees bad
agreed to recognize student gov
ernment. Although self-govern
ment is accepted without question
in the Western universities, the
idea apparently is unparalleled in
any other New England univer
sity. Harvard and Yale still being
guided by the paternal hand. The
new constitution provides for an
j undergraduate council, compara
, ble to Excom, and student courts.
Stanford's long established Honor
Code will soon be instituted at the
Eastern campus.
WIG-WA.\I VILLAGE
Stanford is not the only college
with a "Village"; Dartmouth has set
up a "Wig-wam Village" for mar
ried veterans. A current analysis in
the college paper points out that
Dartmouth men are well off in com
parison with other college students.
Although the school has accepted
i '450 more men than usual, bringing
! their enrollment to 3,000. there is
definitely no housing problem.
Housing space is still available in
; the college dormitories and in the
Village. Dartmouth boasts that, "no
students are living in quonset huts,
• gymnasiums, or with their in-laws."
Though the housing problem is
; licked, and the dieticians contend
| that the food is good, a Dartmouth

man doesn't consider the food prob
lem solved with pieces of pie and
cake selling over the counter for 15
cents.
AIRWAYS OPENED
DBS. Dartmouth's radio station,
opened its broadcasting last se
mester by saying that "with good
music, accurate news, and the
grace of God, DBS will start its
second post-war semester of
broadcasting." The station found
quick favor with the student body,
with the exception of one junior
who commented on its treatment
of classical music. He stated that
he liked the music on Dartmouth's
"Classical Clambake," hut object
ed to the commentary where Car
men was referred to as a babe who
has "you know what," and the
portrayal of Don Juan as a "dumb
jerk."
SPIRIT LACKING
While the editorials of the uni
versity accused the college of com
placency in political matters, the
sports columns lay part of the fail
ure of the Dartmouth football team
directly in the laps of Dartmouth
followers. The edit columns stated
that the three politically conscious
organizations on campus had little
representation; the sports staff asked
where the famous Dartmouth spirit
had hidden itself. The sports stall
contended that hardly a ripple could
be heard in Palmer Stadium after a
Dartmouth touchdown. The staff
shook its finger at the student body
and reminded them that in the good
old days in a moment of frenzied ex
citement "an inebriated soul could
topple backward from the rear row
of Palmer Stadium and sail 150 feet
in the air before reaching the coun
ter of the hot-dog concession."
The veterans of the class of '50
had their complaint too. They ob
jected to the lack of maturity in
the uppcrclassmcn. The vets con
tended that unlike the uppcrclass
mcn in general, they were at Dart
mouth for two things—an educa
tion and a good time, in that order.
CLASS OF '50
The class of '50 had its gayer mo
ments. Although the class of '45 won

the Baby Derby Crown, having had
more babies born to its married
members than any other class, the
class of '50 was not to be outdone.
Out of the running for the first week
of the contest because of no babies,
one of the member's wives had a
baby two days before the contest
closed. Never underestimate the
power of a freshman!
A favorite complaint of the stu
dents was the unpleasing water.
The water is far from palatable. As
one student put it:"I admit that 1
don't drink much water, but this
stuff ruins my scotch."

music, accurate news, and the
grace of God, DBS will start its
second post-war semester of
broadcasting." The station found
quick favor with the student body,
with the exception of one junior
who commented on its treatment
of classical music. He stated that
he liked the music on Dartmouth's
"Classical Clambake," hut object
ed to the commentary where Car
men was referred to as a babe who
has "you know what," and the
portrayal of Don Juan as a "dumb
jerk."
SPIRIT LACKING
While the editorials of the uni
versity accused the college of com
placency in political matters, the
sports columns lay part of the fail
ure of the Dartmouth football team
directly in the laps of Dartmouth
followers. The edit columns stated
that the three politically conscious
organizations on campus had little
representation; the sports staff asked
where the famous Dartmouth spirit
had hidden itself. The sports stall
contended that hardly a ripple could
be heard in Palmer Stadium after a
Dartmouth touchdown. The staff
shook its finger at the student body
and reminded them that in the good
old days in a moment of frenzied ex
citement "an inebriated soul could
topple backward from the rear row
of Palmer Stadium and sail 150 feet
in the air before reaching the coun
ter of the hot-dog concession."
The veterans of the class of '50
had their complaint too. They ob
jected to the lack of maturity in
the uppcrclassmcn. The vets con
tended that unlike the uppcrclass
mcn in general, they were at Dart
mouth for two things—an educa
tion and a good time, in that order.
CLASS OF '50
The class of '50 had its gayer mo
ments. Although the class of '45 won

the Baby Derby Crown, having had
more babies born to its married
members than any other class, the
class of '50 was not to be outdone.
Out of the running for the first week
of the contest because of no babies,
one of the member's wives had a
baby two days before the contest
closed. Never underestimate the
power of a freshman!
A favorite complaint of the stu
dents was the unpleasing water.
The water is far from palatable. As
one student put it:"I admit that 1
don't drink much water, but this
stuff ruins my scotch."
If the Stanford ski team flys East
this February to the Dartmouth
Winter Carnival, they will find a
college just beginning its experi
i ment in student self-government
—and a school where they can
pick up a beer in the campus tap
room.
CAMPUS TAVERN
The campus taproom is the pride
lof all Dartmouth Indians. (Yes, the
| Ivy League has its Indians too.) The
I taproom in the basement of College
| Hall serves snacks, soft drinks, and
the traditional beer. Not content
with one tavern, the school recently
added an annex. Indicative of stu
! dent comment on the new addition
, were the words of an undergraduate
, published in "The Dartmouth," the
| campus daily. He said, "I hope that
I this will mean that inhaling some
i thing besides beer and smoke will be
possible, and that I'll be able to see
the person I'm drinking with."
Last October, headlines in "The
Dartmouth" proclaimed that, for
the lirst time in the school's his
tory, the Board of Trustees bad
agreed to recognize student gov
ernment. Although self-govern
ment is accepted without question
in the Western universities, the
idea apparently is unparalleled in
any other New England univer
sity. Harvard and Yale still being
guided by the paternal hand. The
new constitution provides for an
j undergraduate council, compara
, ble to Excom, and student courts.
Stanford's long established Honor
Code will soon be instituted at the
Eastern campus.
WIG-WA.\I VILLAGE
Stanford is not the only college
with a "Village"; Dartmouth has set
up a "Wig-wam Village" for mar
ried veterans. A current analysis in
the college paper points out that
Dartmouth men are well off in com
parison with other college students.
Although the school has accepted
i '450 more men than usual, bringing
! their enrollment to 3,000. there is
definitely no housing problem.
Housing space is still available in
; the college dormitories and in the
Village. Dartmouth boasts that, "no
students are living in quonset huts,
• gymnasiums, or with their in-laws."
Though the housing problem is
; licked, and the dieticians contend

man doesn't consider the food prob

cake selling over the counter for 15
cents.

room.
CAMPUS TAVERN
The campus taproom is the pride
lof all Dartmouth Indians. (Yes, the
| Ivy League has its Indians too.) The
I taproom in the basement of College
| Hall serves snacks, soft drinks, and
the traditional beer. Not content
with one tavern, the school recently
added an annex. Indicative of stu
! dent comment on the new addition
, were the words of an undergraduate
, published in "The Dartmouth," the
| campus daily. He said, "I hope that
I this will mean that inhaling some
i thing besides beer and smoke will be
possible, and that I'll be able to see
the person I'm drinking with."
Last October, headlines in "The
Dartmouth" proclaimed that, for
the lirst time in the school's his
tory, the Board of Trustees bad
agreed to recognize student gov
ernment. Although self-govern
ment is accepted without question
in the Western universities, the
idea apparently is unparalleled in
any other New England univer
sity. Harvard and Yale still being
guided by the paternal hand. The
new constitution provides for an
j undergraduate council, compara
, ble to Excom, and student courts.
Stanford's long established Honor
Code will soon be instituted at the
Eastern campus.
WIG-WA.\I VILLAGE
Stanford is not the only college
with a "Village"; Dartmouth has set
up a "Wig-wam Village" for mar
ried veterans. A current analysis in
the college paper points out that
Dartmouth men are well off in com
parison with other college students.
Although the school has accepted
i '450 more men than usual, bringing
! their enrollment to 3,000. there is
definitely no housing problem.
Housing space is still available in
; the college dormitories and in the
Village. Dartmouth boasts that, "no
students are living in quonset huts,
• gymnasiums, or with their in-laws."
Though the housing problem is
; licked, and the dieticians contend
| that the food is good, a Dartmouth

man doesn't consider the food prob
lem solved with pieces of pie and
cake selling over the counter for 15
cents.
AIRWAYS OPENED
DBS. Dartmouth's radio station,
opened its broadcasting last se
mester by saying that "with good
music, accurate news, and the
grace of God, DBS will start its
second post-war semester of
broadcasting." The station found
quick favor with the student body,
with the exception of one junior
who commented on its treatment
of classical music. He stated that
he liked the music on Dartmouth's
"Classical Clambake," hut object
ed to the commentary where Car
men was referred to as a babe who
has "you know what," and the
portrayal of Don Juan as a "dumb
jerk."
SPIRIT LACKING
While the editorials of the uni
versity accused the college of com
placency in political matters, the
sports columns lay part of the fail
ure of the Dartmouth football team
directly in the laps of Dartmouth
followers. The edit columns stated
that the three politically conscious
organizations on campus had little
representation; the sports staff asked
where the famous Dartmouth spirit
had hidden itself. The sports stall
contended that hardly a ripple could
be heard in Palmer Stadium after a
Dartmouth touchdown. The staff
shook its finger at the student body
and reminded them that in the good
old days in a moment of frenzied ex
citement "an inebriated soul could
topple backward from the rear row
of Palmer Stadium and sail 150 feet
in the air before reaching the coun
ter of the hot-dog concession."
The veterans of the class of '50
had their complaint too. They ob
jected to the lack of maturity in
the uppcrclassmcn. The vets con
tended that unlike the uppcrclass
mcn in general, they were at Dart
mouth for two things—an educa
tion and a good time, in that order.
CLASS OF '50
The class of '50 had its gayer mo
ments. Although the class of '45 won

the Baby Derby Crown, having had
more babies born to its married
members than any other class, the
class of '50 was not to be outdone.
Out of the running for the first week
of the contest because of no babies,
one of the member's wives had a
baby two days before the contest
closed. Never underestimate the
power of a freshman!
A favorite complaint of the stu
dents was the unpleasing water.
The water is far from palatable. As
one student put it:"I admit that 1
don't drink much water, but this
stuff ruins my scotch."
If the Stanford ski team flys East
this February to the Dartmouth
Winter Carnival, they will find a
college just beginning its experi
i ment in student self-government
—and a school where they can
pick up a beer in the campus tap
room.
