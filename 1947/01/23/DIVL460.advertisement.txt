Thesis on the Development of
Our Well Known
G. I. Sandwiches
We must be more broadminded during the present generation. During
and shortly after the First World War hamburger meat in the form of
steaks was usually eaten in homes only, but gradually moved into
restaurants.
The average Patriot Public decided that hamburger sounded to
close to 'Berlin—so from somewhere, possibly from some descendant
of an English Lord, the name of ground meat was changed to Salisbury
Steak.
This name lasted a few years, but we know, or so it is said, the
American Public forgets quickly. So again, the name of Ground Beef
steaks and sandwiches reverted back to Hamburger until shortly after
the last conflict started. Then the present generation really did popu
larize the lowly Ground Beef Sandwich and Steak to the point that it
now is the American National Dish.
Then for some reason (perhaps because he was called G.I. Joe)
these famous dishes are now called G.l.'s, meaning—H.imburgers,
Liberty Steaks, Salisbury Steaks, etc.
IT IS SAID THAT OUR G.l.'s
| ARE VERY GOOD!
