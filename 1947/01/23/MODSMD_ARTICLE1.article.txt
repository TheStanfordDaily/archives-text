## Hoover to Make German Study 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 (UP). â€”Former President Herbert Hoover
announced today that he will fly to Europe next week, at President
Truman's request, and make another study of food conditions to see what
can be done about spending less American money to feed the Germans
and Austrians.
Mr. Hoover, who is 72 years old, agreed to undertake the survey, his
third overseas food mission in the past year, after a 30-minute conference
with Mr. Truman.
He said his investigation will take in only the U.S. occupation zones
of Germany and Austria, where this country is spending more than
000,000 a year to feed its former enemies.
But he indicated that his studies may involve conditions in the British
and French occupation areas, particularly the British, since they have
agreed on an economic merger of their zone with that of the United States.
