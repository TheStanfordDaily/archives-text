# Director Sees Europe Political Fight
## 
### BRUCE MITCHELL 
Countries on the Mediterranean j
coast are facing a struggle between I
the forces of the far left and the j
far right, according to Charles F. :
Delzell, assistant to the Director
of the Hoover Library.
Delzell returned from Europe the
end of last year after completing a
trip through Greece, Italy, Spain, j
and Portugal where he collected
materials for the Hoover Library.
VIEWS POLITICAL SCENE
Delzell was able to view the po- '
litical situation in Italy and to j
meet several of the important Ital- !
inn leaders including ex-Premier
Bonomi, Count Carlo Sforza, and I
the historian and philosopher Be- 1
nedetto Crocc.
Most of the Italian people feel
Jhat the United States and Great
Britain let Italy down when the
peace treaty was drawn up. Ital
ians say this country talked them
into overthrowing Mussolini and
lighting against Hitler, hut now
that the war is over. Italy is treat
ed almost as if she had aided Hit
ler to the hitter end. Delzell states
that they arc particularly pro
voked by the Trieste settlement,
the los- of their navy and colo
nies. and the large reparations.
This, plus the bad economic con
ditions, is a decided liability to the
republican government which is at
tempting to get its start, stated Del
ze 11.
LEFT, KIGHT PARTIES
People are joining the parties of
the extreme left, the Communists,
and those of the extreme right, the
"Uomo Qunlunque'' or the "Com

tnon Man" party. The latter parly is
mainly composed of those Italians
who did not sufler at the hands of
the Fascists, and is led by a philos
ophy which sounds feminiscent of
that of the dictatorial regimes, ac
cording to Delzell.

However, Del/ell believes that
there arc many sincerely demo
cratic people in Italy and that
with an easing in the economic
situation, Italy may become a rep
spec table democratic power.
The situation in Greece was also

analyzed by Delzell when he was
collecting material in that, area for
the library. The Greeks, he said, not
only suffered greatly at the hands of
the Germans and Italians during the
occupation, but were faced with a
civil war immediately upon the de
feat of Germany. Delzell stated thai
many of the people voted for the
monarchy so that a stable govern
ment could be formed to prevent
another attempt of the Communists
to seize control of the government
by force.
The latter reason was one of the
main ones for the British occupa
tion in addition to their desire to
protect the Suez Canal, Delzell
said.
The Greeks by choosing to keep
their monarch "decided to try to
bring their country from the chaos
left by the war in the opposite way
from the Italians who voted their
king out. according to Delzell.
LATENT FRANCO OPPOSITION
In Spain, Delzell found that there
was a strong latent opposition to
Franco, but that the Spaniards
hoped that the situation would be
settled without another civil war
to ruin their country.
The extremists were disgusted
with the Anglo-American policy to
ward Franco. He stated that only
strong action by the Anglo-Ameri
| can powers such as boycotts, eeo
| nomic sanctions, or outright mili-
I tary aid could oust Franco, for any
I diplomatic moves would only serve
to make the people resist any out
siders trying to run their govern
ment.
Dlzell said that the two main ar

eas of resistance to Franco were
j the area around Barcelona and the
j Basque provinces in northern Spain
on the Bay of Biscay. Both areas
want to be either independent or
autonomous. Barcelona, the center
of manufacturing in Spain, is the
headquarters of the leftist move
| ments.
j TYRANNY, CENSORSHIP
These two areas, according to the
I observer, have been subjected to the
worst amount of tyranny and cen
sorship. Both areas speak languages
that are not Spanish. The Basque
language is like no other European
| tongue, and the Franco government.,
unable to censor the papers, even
forbade the publication of a dic
tionary.
Franco controls the country with
an army that is large and the only
well-fed group in the country, Del
zell stated. The rest of the people
are suffering from inflation and
short rations.
Before returning to Stanford, Del
zell visited the moderate dictator
ship of Portugal. Salazar, the dic
tator, runs a government which
leans strongly to Catholicism. The
country, which remained strictly
neutral during the war, is tied up
I economically wjth England and has
I been able to restore somewhat fa
t vorable economic conditions.


REPORTS ON EUROPE- â€”Hugh Baillie. president of the United
Press, told reporters that nobody in Europe wants the Ameriean oecti
pation troops to leave, including the Germans themselves. Americans
are regarded as a stabilizing factor. Mr. Haillie is shown at right as
he arrived in New York aboard the Queen Elizabeth after three months
of observing conditions abroad.
