For those who were bypassed in
last year's selection of Rhodes Schol
ars, there is a new chance to attend
an Ehglish university with the re
cent announcement that five Ameri
can students will be given fellow
ships to study in England during
1947-48.
The fellowships are being made
available by the American Commit
tee of Management for the Charles
and Julia Henry Fund. The Fund
provides approximately $2,400 a
year for the fellowships.
Fellowships are open to both
men and women.
The fellows will be selected from
those students graduating from
American colleges this spring, and
from those who have graduated
since 11)42. Those chosen will have
a free choice of subjects to be stud
ied, and may attend either Oxford
or Cambridge University.
Those interested must apply on
or before Feb. 28 to the Office of
the Secretary of Vale University
or to the Office of the Secretary
of- the Corporation of Harvard
University.
The fund, established under the
will of the late Lady Julia Henry,
also provides fellowships enabling
English students to study at Har
vard and Yale.
