# New Manager Being Sought
## 
### 
Martin Anderson, A.S.S.U. presi
dent, announced Tuesday that he
expects to have a list of names of
students recommended for the po T
sition of student manager ready by
Friday.
This list will be submitted to Al
Masters, graduate manager, who
will make an appointment to fill
the position vacated Monday by
Joan McDonough.
Miss McDonough was appointed
to the post by Masters last spring
quarter. She resigned because in
creasing pressure of school work
made it impossible to devote as
much time to the job as was needed.
The student manager is respon
sible for all A.S.S.U. funds and bus
iness transactions.


Joan Mcdonough
