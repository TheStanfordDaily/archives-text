Following is something we read in "This
Week" of Sunday's San Francisco Chronicle.
In the "Words to Live By" section, Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, Chancellor of Stanford Univer
sity, commented on a quotation from Tenny
son's "Ulysses": ". . . Come, my friends. 'Tis
not too late to seek a newer world." We think
lliat what Dr. Wilbur had to say is something
w< j can all take time to consider:
"Just a few years ago we heard people talk
ing about 'no more frontiers.' They said there
was no more need to fight and struggle for

existence. Now the whole world population
finds itself where it must work harder than
ever if it is to get out of the hole that it is in.
Happiness is a true goal of man, but it comes
through striving, not through resting. To halt,
to be satisfied, is in part to die. Life is an
adventure and can be glorious, but not for the
parasite. Freedom must be won, and faith
must be sought. To live, to grow, to have a
family, to seek new paths, and to help the less
fortunate —these are sufficient goals to keep
human beings at the top of those biological
forces we call life."—M.S.
