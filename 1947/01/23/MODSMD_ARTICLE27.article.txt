### BILL COUGHLIN 
Stanford women haven'l changed much over the
i >•; i I guess. The consideration for other people
anrom? 'he majority of them (oh, you think I'm not
i.-11kiri• to you now, eh, babe?) remains about as nil
as 11 «-v»t was.
Two of the Farm's darlings walked into a store in
Rily the other day and asked to look at rugs. They
were planning on purchasing one for their room,
apparently.
,The clerk showed them one that seemed to please
l! em. They placed it on the floor and walked all
over it "to try it out." Don't ask me why anyone
would want to try out a rug.
Alter trampling all over it like a herd of small
< If pliants, Ihe sweet things handed the rug back and
left, leaving the clerk holding a well-battered rug
;• ri'l Convinced that Stanford women have about as
liltle consideration as well-bred sows.
And he's so right.

Hut somehow Stanford men sometimes can't be
i.iled on 100 high a level of intelligence themselves.
One lad, while enamored of a local lass, gave her a
Hi pier. That's right, a stapler. Not a yacht, not a
i: ink coat, not a diamond bracelet, but a stapler. The
usual old kind of stapler that you staple things with.
Now love, as so often happens (they tell me), has
vanished between the pair. No longer do they gaze

long in each other s eyes and dream of rose-covered
cottages They don't even speak to each other any
more
And, of course you've already guessed the end
ing. That's right, he wants his stapler back!

One of the lesser lights on the Quad staff was
faced with a problem. lie wanted to take a picture
of the A.S.S.U. president in a large luxurious office,
surrounded by a bevy of Stanford beauties.
His problem was to find a large luxurious tfflice
for the setting. (Personally, 1 think it was to lincl
a bevy of Stanford beauties, but he thought it was
the office.)
So he approached the almighty Quad editor with
his dilemma.
"Why," suggested the editor, tongue in cheek,
"don't you call Ray Lyman Wilbur and see if you
can borrow his office?"
Missing the gag completely, the lesser light
thought the suggestion over and decided it had great
merit. So he called Dr. Wilbur.
"Dr. Wilbur isn't in," he was informed coldly
by the secretary, "but I don't think he will like the
idea. I'll have him call you back."
At this point, the editor of the Quad rose quietly
and fled from the office. He is now hiding out here
in the seclusion of the Daily Shack until the storm
blows over. ,
