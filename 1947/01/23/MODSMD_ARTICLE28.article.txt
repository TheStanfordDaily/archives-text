# CAMPUS OPINION
## APATHETIC ELECTORS 
### 
To the Editor:
Kccently there has been much discussion of
campus apathy as regards student government. Let
us consider the situation carefully and discover
whether this apathy is not, alter all, the proper atti
tude. In the following discussion, I specifically ex
en ml the Honor Code.
Most (presumably all) students are at Stanford
for one particular purpose—to gain knowledge. Any
activity which utilizes time that should be spent in
pursuit of this aim tends to defeat the purpose for
which the student is in a university. Even for the
voter, proper participation means that he should
know not only what he is voting for, but also the
policies and altitudes of the person for whom he is
voting. Obviously the student voter does not have
enough time to do this properly, so. as a result, he
either votes, knowing little or nothing about the
person or the issue for which he is voting, or does
not vote at all.
This situation does, not hold in the national elec
tions. Twxj factors are usually changed: first, the
time of the average citizen is not so precious as that
of the university student; second, he can easily find
concise data as to the attitudes and backgrounds of
the candidates or as to the policies on which he is
voting. Thus the view that participation in student
government enables one to participate in national
government more effectively is not true.
When a student comes to Stanford he pays tui
tion, some of which goes toward upkeep of tht?

physical plant, a part toward paying th salaries of
the men who teach him, and another part toward the
salaries of the administrative staff whose job it is
to keep the University running smoothly. Thus by
the mere act of coming to Stanford he indicates his
approval of the administration, and by paying his
tuition ftives monetary support. In other words, we
are paying for the privilege of not having to waste
our time with the administration of the University.
Already I can feel my opponents leaping at my
throat with cries of, "But this breeds nazism!" They
forget two things. One, the situation here, as I have
pointed out above, is entirely different from that
obtaining on a national scale, and two, if conditions
become too bad, the students may express their dis
pleasure to the administration, or, if that does no
good, may transfer to another university whose poli
cies they do support.

for one particular purpose—to gain knowledge. Any
activity which utilizes time that should be spent in
pursuit of this aim tends to defeat the purpose for
which the student is in a university. Even for the
voter, proper participation means that he should
know not only what he is voting for, but also the
policies and altitudes of the person for whom he is
voting. Obviously the student voter does not have
enough time to do this properly, so. as a result, he
either votes, knowing little or nothing about the
person or the issue for which he is voting, or does
not vote at all.
This situation does, not hold in the national elec
tions. Twxj factors are usually changed: first, the
time of the average citizen is not so precious as that
of the university student; second, he can easily find
concise data as to the attitudes and backgrounds of
the candidates or as to the policies on which he is
voting. Thus the view that participation in student
government enables one to participate in national
government more effectively is not true.
When a student comes to Stanford he pays tui
tion, some of which goes toward upkeep of tht?

physical plant, a part toward paying th salaries of
the men who teach him, and another part toward the
salaries of the administrative staff whose job it is
to keep the University running smoothly. Thus by
the mere act of coming to Stanford he indicates his
approval of the administration, and by paying his
tuition ftives monetary support. In other words, we
are paying for the privilege of not having to waste
our time with the administration of the University.
Already I can feel my opponents leaping at my
throat with cries of, "But this breeds nazism!" They
forget two things. One, the situation here, as I have
pointed out above, is entirely different from that
obtaining on a national scale, and two, if conditions
become too bad, the students may express their dis
pleasure to the administration, or, if that does no
good, may transfer to another university whose poli
cies they do support.
