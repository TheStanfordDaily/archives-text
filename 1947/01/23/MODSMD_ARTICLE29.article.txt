# ELECTION BY CHANCE?
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Article IV. Section 2, Paragraph 6: "If a tie for
the lowest place occurs, the candidate to be dropped
shall be determined by lot from those having the
vote." If only two names remain and they have a
tie vote, election shall be determined between the
two by lot." To me that seems unfair. Why not drop
the two lowest in case of a tie? That would be fair
to both. Certainly election itself should not be by
chance! A tie, and they do occur, should be revoted!
