## HISTORY 1947 
### 
1 don't think I can add much to the discussion
of liberalism presented yesterday in "It Concerns
Us." But there are one or two aspects . . .
In the first place, it is fortunate that mankind is
. not often confronted with eold ultimatum, "Sub
! mil or starve." Presented in that light, lew indeed
have not submitted. When the phrase is ' watered
down to "submit in some measure or suffer in some
measure," why, then, half the heroes of history have
been willing to suffer for their freedom and that of
their people. Give mankind a fighting chance and a
substantial portion of it will fight for whatever they
consider their rights to be.
But, in the second place, I heartily agree with
the proposition that liberalism concerns itself with
both the political freedom and the economic security
of the individual. It is a characteristic human trait
to want to eat one's cake and have it, too. Speaking
in the abstract, my own thought is that the pre
sumption is in favor of liberty; that is to say, unless
the need for some measure restricting liberty in the
interests of security is clear, and unless I am con
vinced that the remedy is preferable to the disease,
I will oppose the restriction. Frankly, if anyone
asks me what kind of a liberal I am, the answer is
"confused liberal," and I think that is what most
liberals are, whether they admit it or not.

The Indian Constituent Assembly, yesterday in
New Delhi, unanimously approved a resolution of
fered by Jawaharal Nehru recommending immediate
independence for India as a sovereign republic. Only
Congress Party members, with those of minor in

dependent groups, were present. The Moslem League
members have not attended, nor are the Indian
princes represented. Speaking of the princes, who
control nearly half the area of the peninsula and
about one-third of the population, Nehru said that
India could tolerate them only if their subjects agree
to keep them as constitutional monarchy.
Since the Constituent Assembly at the moment
can hardly claim to represent India as a whole
and indeed it is only from the geogVaphical point of
view that India is usually considered as a whole—
it does not seem to me that the resolution is intended
as anything more than another stick with which to
beat the British and the opposition groups. Glancing
into Indian history, I am wondering if this is not one
case in which the cure, independence, might not be
worse than the disease. Now, under what is left of
British rule, India has some liberty and some secu
rity. Would she have either under any Congress
Party government? With the princes calling up their
feudal armies, with the Moslems and the Hindus
and the Sikhs and the rest of the faiths, castes, and
tribes all striking out for themselves, I'm not so sure.

I see by the papers that divers well-intentioned
Congressmen have introduced divers bills to increase
veterans' benefits. Bluntly, I'm against it. It might
be defensible to increase subsistence payments for
student veterans with more than one dependent—
$10 for each of a married veteran's children has been
suggested. But in general and considering the fiscal
condition of the federal government, higher sub
sistence payments just aren't necessary.
