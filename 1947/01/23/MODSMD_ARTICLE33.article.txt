# Clothing Donations Asked For Spanish Refugee Relief
## 
### 
The Spanish Refugee Committee j
of Palo Alto, under the chairman
ship of Mrs. George A. Forrester,
j has issued a special appeal to Stan
ford staff members and students for
used clothing, shoes, and bedding
to be sent to refugees from Spain

now settled in Southern France.
These refugees who fled from the
Spain of Franco ten years ago can
not receive help from UNNRA and
the International Red Cross, be
cause they are technically citizens
of a neutral country. However,
their plight is more desperate than
many of the deprived Europeans,
and it has become more acute be
cause of their internment during the
war in Nazi concentration camps.
The Spanish Refugee Committee
in the last two weeks has shipped
more than 750 pounds of clothing
abroad, and with the aid of the
Stanford staff and students they
hope to double this amount in the
next two months. A special Stan
ford collection depot, at the home
of Mrs. F. W. Weymouth, 517 Salva
tierra, has been established. Clothes
submitted should be cleaned and
mended, if possible, but clofhing in
need of renovation will also be ac
cepted.
