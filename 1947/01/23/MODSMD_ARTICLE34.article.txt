## 
### 
Another w?ek-end and another full slate for the Stanford hoop
squad. This week's program will pit the Olympic Club against
the Cardinal Friday evening and Fresno State against the local
boys on Saturday. Both frays will be preceded by "B" team
contests. Starting times for the two nights has been set for 6:30.

The varsity games will get under *
way at 8:00. Tic kets are not required
for the games this week-end, admis
sion will be via the Student Body
card route.
The Friday conies! with the
Olympic Club will mark the sec
ond time the Indians have clashed
with the Bay eluh team. In the
first meeting the Stanford cagcrs 1
came from behind a nine-point
disadvantage to nip the Clubers,
52-41.
FORMER STARS STUD ROSTER
The Olympic Club, composed of
former college stars, including for
mer Indian, Fred Linari, is a clever I
outfit which features tricky ball
handling and some extremely accu
rate floor shooting.. The squad is a |
small aggregation with an average \
height <jf 5 feet 11 inches. What the I
teanj lacks in height it makes up in I
experience and finesse.
The Saturday evening affair
against the Cardinal and Blue of
Fresno Stale, should prove an inter- !
esting test for the Stanford varsity,!
which has been resting after the
clawing they received at the hands
of the Berkeley Bears. Boasting a
record of five wins against three re
versals the Staters should provide
enough action to keep the audience
and team on edge.
FARM S HEIGHT ADVANTAGE
The Fresno squad is taller than
the Olympic Club live, but it does
n't come close to matching the
height of the Stanford team. The
tallest man on the Fresno quintet
is Vernon Riggins at (i feet (i. who
holds down one of the guard slots.
The other elongated cageman is
John Toomasian, center, who tops
the mark at (i feet 4, and is the I
offensive star of the team with SO J
points credited to his account in j
the first seven games. The remain
der of the squad is around the six
foot mark.
The record of the Bulldogs of [
Fresno State feature wins over Ma- |
dera All-Stars, Hawaii All-Stars, I
Chico State, El Toro Marines, and !
Cal Poly. Losses have been regis- j
tered to Chico State, San Diego
State and Santa Barbara College.
The varsity has been working
out daily in the Pavilion aiming at
these two contests, and the two
which follow next week against j
USF and Santa Clara. The next
conference series will be played in ,
Los Angeles against the University j
of Southern California on Febru- j
ary 7 and S.
