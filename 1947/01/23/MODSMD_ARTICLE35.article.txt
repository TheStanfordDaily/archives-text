night refused to confirm or deny
thai Fritz Crisler or Lynn Waldorf
had been named head football coach
at University of California to suc
ceed the ousted Frank Wickhorst.
"I have nothing to say on the sub

told United Press after local news
papers carried conflicting reports on
"official" selection of a new coach.
Jiin Scott, sports editor of the
Berkeley (layette, said today that
lie had "absolutely certain" infor
mation that Crisler, head football
roach and athletic director at Uni

year job.
Norrie West, director of public re
lations at California, said there was
no official information on the subject
yet—and that either of the men
might get the job—or neither.
Meanwhile, the biggest rumor
factory in West Coast sports was
expected to be out of work soon,
because official selection of the
new coach is supposed to be an
nounced tomorrow.
Other names still in the running
include Oriti E. (Babe) Hollingbery,
former successful Washington State
Coach; George Sauer, tutor of Ne
braska; Tex Oliver, recently let out
at University of Oregon, and Earl
Blaik, Army grid mentor.
The associated students of Uni
versity of California meet tonight,
then a special closed meeting of
the executive committee will fol
low—at which time the coach re
portedly will be picked.
However, no announcement will
be made officially until tomorrow,
according to West.
Hamilton had been selected by the
ASUC to make a nation-wide sur
vey of the coaching talent available
and to report his finds to the com
mittee. In such capacity he toured
the Middlewest and East during the
!>ast month and recently returned
from Los Angeles where he inter
viewed coaches in that area.
