### BILL HACHTEN 
Stanford's rugby team takes to the
field for the first time this year when
they meet Santa Rosa Junior Col
lege here on Friday afternoon on the
Intramural Field by the Corporation
Yard.
The locals, coached by Jim Wy
lie and VYillard Clauson and ably
assisted by Chuck Taylor, have
been practicing daily for this game
and are looking forward to a suc
cessful season.
Stanford's fifteen will be handi
capped by the loss of Sandy Ather
ton and William Hayes. During
practice scrimmages this week,
Hayes broke his leg and Atherton
injured his knee.
Reluctant to name a starting line
up as yi t, Taylor did say he was
pleased with the play of Bob Brodie,
Sandy Atherton, and Peter Cortel
you.
As yet. a schedule for the sea
son has not been released, pending
negotiations for a game with Santa
Clara. The next game will be
against Petaluma here on Feb. 1.
Rugby, the grandaddy of Ameri
can football, is a fast, wide-open
game without the forward passing
and blocking found in the American
game. The methods of scoring in the
two games are very similar. A "try"
in rugby, the equivalent of a touch
down, is good for 3 points, and a
"'goal from try," worth 2 points, is
like the conversion. A drop kick is
worth 4 points and three points are
awarded for a goal from a free kick.
It's a fast, exciting game and an ex
cellent spectator sport featuring
broken-field running and kicking.
