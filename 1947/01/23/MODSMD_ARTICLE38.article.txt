CHICAGO, Jan. 22 (UP).—Club
owners in the National Professional
Football League open their annual
winter meeting Thursday with a
docket which promises to be enliv
ened only if Commissioner Bert Bell
takes action on the "bribery" scan
dal which surrounded the league
play-ofT game.
Only three resolutions have been
submitted for discussion by the
meeting, two of them by Fred Man
del, owner of the Detroit Lions, and
the third by George Marshall of the
Washington Redskins.
However, there was a hint that
Bell might tell the owners, in ex
ecutive session, of his investigation
of Frankie Filchock and Merle
Ilapes, New York Giant backs who
were offered bribes to "throw" the
championship playoff tilt with the
Chicago Boars.
It was believed probable that he
would suggest postponement of lea
gue- action until completion of the
investigation of the case by the New
York district attorney's office.
Mandel suggested expansion of
the playing schedule from 11 to 13
games per season by adoption of a
round-robin program. He also
asked authorization for clubs
within one division of the circuit
to play exhibition games in any
city where they would not meet
in a scheduled contest.
To provide for the 13-game sched
ule. he called for each team to meet
every other club in its division in a
home and home series, while each
team would also meet each of the
five members of the other
once.
