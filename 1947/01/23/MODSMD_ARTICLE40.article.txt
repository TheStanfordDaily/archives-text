# Trackmen Give High Promise
## 
### 
Stanford's track team, which went
through the 1946 season without a i
single victory to its credit, faces no
such dismal prospect this spring. I
New and promising talent has been
added to the remnants of last year's !
squad, and the resulting mixture j
bodes well for the future.
But, as Coach Jack Weierhauser
cautions. "We'll be greatly im
proved. and—on the other hand—
so will every team on our sched
ule."
As to which team in thq confer- j
ence will improve the most, and \
which has the most solid basis of j
competent athletes to build upon— !
that's anybody's guess at this early |
stage.
Although actual intercollegiate j
competition is still almost three !
months away, the 100-man squad
under Weierhauser's direction has j
been hard at work for a long time. !
In fact, many team candidates start
ed pounding the Angell Field cind
ers as far back as October.
Returning lettermen from last
year's thinclads include Martin An
derson, 1946 team captain, a 100- j
yard dash and pole-vault specialist, j
Anderson has done 9.9 in the dash j
and 12 feet 8 inches in the pole vault.
Three Farm representatives who
took first places in 194<5's Big Meet
are hack lor •more: Al Holubar,
who captured the half-mile in
1:58.7; Frank Ganahl, blue-ribbon
winner in (he mile with a time of
4:25, and Bill Larson, top man in
the pole-vault competition with a
12 feet 6 inches effort.
Other lettermen veterans of last,
season's campaign are George
Grimes, a 50.1 quarter-miler and
1:58 half-miler; along with Al Wil
kins, a 50.7 quarter-miler, and Al
Vierthaler, who has been clocked at
10.1 in the century and 24.8 in the '
low hurdles.
Also on the list of returning Stan
ford trackmen are Bob Fess and
Kenny Taix sprinters from the 1942
aggregation. Ted Off, a very promis
ing middle distance runner who saw
some action last year; Bob Iverson.
a sophomore with a second in the
1946 Big Meet half-mile to his credit,
and John Campbell—a greatly im
proved broadjumper from last sea- !
son's squad.
Al Snyder, a senior transfer
from Dartmouth, is one of the
newcomers who have shown up
well in workouts to date. Snyder
earned a 24.2 low hurdle victory
around one turn in the IC4A Tour
nament. and a 14.8 second place in
the tourney's high hurdles. »
Dell Russell, another recent ar- ,
rival, won the Inter-Allied Euro- 1
pean high hurdle championship with j
a time of 15.3. Terry Maxwell, a i
transfer from Duke, is a talented i
sprinter, with best times of 10.0 in
the hundred, and 21.8 in the 220.
Larry Hoff. Richmond (Calif.)

all-trades" type of athlete—partici
pating in the high hurdles, low hur
dles, broad jump, and sprints—is a
promising addition to the roster.
Sprint and quarter-mile special
ist Frank Johnson—son of Stanford's
former track coach "Pitch" Johnson;
Al Lyons, frosh distance runner;

Steve McKee, a discus and shotput
prospect; and Charles Barnett, prod
uct of San Francisco's high school
system with a ceiling of 6 feet 1 in
the high jump. All have good
chances to make a name for them
selves in the college track world.
This list does not exhaust the '
potentialities of Coach Weierhau
ser's largely frosh-soph squad by
any means. As conditioning pro
gresses other athletes will begin to
hit their stride.
Such events as the sprints, middle
distance races, and high and low
hurdles are fairly well stocked with
candidates. Most, serious shortages
occur in the high jump and javelin
brackets, where a large percentage
of the performers are more or less
inexperienced.
