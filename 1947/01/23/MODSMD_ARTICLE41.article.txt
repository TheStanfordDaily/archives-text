# 'Big Red Machine' to Tackle Jayvees in Saturday Prelim
## 
### 
Selection of the "Big Red Ma
chine" from the Village Intramural
Basketball League to represent the
all-campus hoopsters against the
Junior Varsity Saturday night was
announced by Director Gene Cold
iron yesterday. The "Machine" has
been operating in the Village com
petition under the name of Building
117, but is donning its new title es
pecially for Saturday's game.
Billed as the preliminary attrac
tion to the Fresno State-Varsity
battle, the meeting between (lie
Intramural representative and the
JV'j should prove to lie an inter
esting one. Naturally the JV's will
he favored to run rough-shod over
the Villagers because of their great
store of experience. But the "Big
Red Machine" has been rounding
into shape in the fast League A
at the Village and should not be
counted out of Saturday's game.
The Village "Machine" opened the
season inauspiciously by feebly fall
ing before Building 214 in a slow
10-6 contest. Following this abrupt
defeat, a complete reorganization
was carried out with the resulting
victory Tuesday night over Build
ing 21G in a practice game. One vic
tory and one defeat is not a tre
mendous record, but smooth team
play brought the honor of represent
ing the Village to the "Machine."
The probable starting lineup for
the Village "Big Red Machine" has
been announced as Sam Paine, Jack
Nichols, Bob Teall, Jack Reed, and
A 1 Robins. Yeoman work will come
from Paine and Reed who double as
co-coaches.
