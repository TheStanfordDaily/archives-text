of his fistic crop into action. Seven

are not required.
Probably the most closely
watched battle will be between
welterweights Frank llewitt and
Wilbur Alius, as Hewitt, editor of
the Chaparral and outstanding
boxing star of 11)42. attempts to
repeat his great performances of
that season.
But his opponent, Altus, will be
no pushover for the former Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate semi - finalist.
Altus is a rugged, game, crowd
pleasing fighter who should give the
talented Hewitt a real battle.

Eyck's flickering left jabs and hooks.
