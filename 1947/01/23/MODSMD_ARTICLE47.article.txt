# New Clinic To Employ Dramatics
## 
### 
Employing a new corrective tech
nique for students who have speech
difficulties, the speech clinic of the
Speech and Drama Department is
conducting a class in "Speech Psy
cho-Drama," trying to help those
students who stutter, stammer, or
have other speech problems con
nected with fear, inadequacy, or
inability to express themselves ef
fectively in a speech situation.
I'sycho-drama as a technique
was developed by Dr. 11. L. Mo
reno of New York as a means of
providing spontaneous re-educa
tive experiences for the partici
pants. The students are given a
situation to act out and solve ex
temporaneously in front of the
other students and visitors. The
situations are similar to those
that the students might meet in
real life, as some of them are
taken from the students' own ex
periences. The roles and situa
tions are adjusted to strengthen
Ihe students' weak points.
The situations used are carefully
chosen both for their adaptive use
in real life and for causing improve
ment in any personality defects.
The actors in the situations often
forget themselves as individuals and
become, in their minds, the charac
ter they are playing. In this way,
they often lose much of their speech
difficulty.
The acts are also planned so that
the students with the least speech
difficulty is given the harder situ
ations to solve, and those with diffi
cult problems are given smaller and
less difficult parts to play.
The main idea of this technique
is to get the student to forget
himself and his speech problem,
and to become the character he
is portraying. Application of this
idea to speech re-training is a
relatively new development, the
possibilities of which are being
explored and utilized by the Stan
ford speech clinic to aid students
with certain types of speech diffi
culties.
Practical application of the tech
nique is observed not only in the
regular school life of the individual,
but also more closely at the socials
held after each meeting.
At the end of each act. the par
ticipants describe to the group the
difficulties they had. what their
foremost problems were, and
what they would try to do to cor
rect them.
The group began meeting in the
middle of last quarter under the
guidance of a few graduate stu
dents majoring in speech, with Vir
gil Anderson, associate professor of
speech and drama, as adviser. The
meetings arc now held every
Thursday night in room 78 of Cub
bcrley Auditorium at 8, and are
open to those who desire help.
