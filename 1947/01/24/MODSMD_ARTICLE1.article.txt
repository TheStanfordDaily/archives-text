# Felix Bloch, Farm Professor, Credited With New Discovery in Nuclear Physics
## 
### 
A Stanford professor of physics, Dr. Felix Bloch, is now perfecting an experiment in which
atomic nuclei are being turned into tiny radio transmitters whose signal tells the identity of
material being tested.
Working here at the University, Dr. Bloch originated the new technigue and developed it in
collaboration with Dr. William W. Hansen, another Stanford physics professor, and Martin Packard.

The new technique uses the fre
j quency and magnetic reaction of the
atom nucleus to make it. tell its own
story through radio frequencies am
plified and reproduced on radar
like oscillograph screens.
On these screens the character
; istic signal — during wartime it
; warned of the approach of enemy
j vessels or aircraft while radar stood
j guard as a probing sentry of
j airlancs—is a peacetime clue to the
| nature and quantity of the material
I tested.
The frequency on which the in
duced signal is received is the key
to the identity of the material, for
Dr. Bincli's discovery is based on
; the fact that the atom nucleus of
I every element has a charactcr
| istic. precise frequency to which
it responds in a given magnetic
field under the influence of radio
frequency electric current.
At the same time, Dr. Hanson—
j the co-inventor of the Klystron
j which made modern radar possible
j —is working on a similar experi
ment.
His aim is to increase the sensi
tivity of the method and to make it
more universally applicable and
flexible.
Dr. Bloch's experiment is designed
I to transform the atom nucleus into
I a sub-microscopic re-transmitting
I set whose characteristic signal can
j be received and interpreted on a
j properly tuned receiver.
This is done by enclosing test
materials in tiny glass vials and
placing them in the field of a pow
erful electro-magnet. He then in
duces radio-frequency current in
to the nuclei, making them spin
I very much like a gyroscope.
When the nuclei are spinning fi*
i right angles to the field a sensitive
; receiving set determines the fre
quency of the electric impulse, or
j signal, given ofT by the nuclei.
The nuclei whirl at incomprehens
ible speeds—42.soo,ooo times a sec
ond in the case of hydrogen nuclei,
j known as protons, subjected to a
, powerful magnetic field.
The frequency at which the nu
cleus responds in a magnetic field
of known value is always the same,
and thus this frequency identifies
I the material from which the signal
jis received. By varying the mag
netic field, (i0 tiny signals a second
are amplified and reproduced on the
i oscillograph.
I)r. Hindi explains that at pres
ent his experiments have centered
on testing protons (hydrogen nu
j clei). which have a high nuclear
I magnetism. These tests have
proved effective and signals strong
enough to l>»> photographed have
been secured when the protons
existed either in solution or in
para Mi lie.
Cautious in predicting applications
of his method of analysis, Dr. Bloch
lias stated. "The system at this stage
isn't as foolproof and 100 per cent
accurate as it must be in order to be
of practical, scientific value in quali
tative and quantitative analysis."
Future experimental fields which
Dr. Bloch plans to probe with his
technique of frequency analysis in

| quality of the proton with that of
the neutron.
