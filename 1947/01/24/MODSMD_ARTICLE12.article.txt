### HELEN PINKERTON 
Chairmen of the International Institute cjroup, the International Survey Committee and Stan
| ford's Chicago Youth Conference delegates have worked out a plan for unification of interna
tional interests on campus.
Mary Virginia Pond, temporary chairman of the Institute group, Niel Allen, head of ISC, and
Marilyn Sidwell, representative to the Chicago Youth Conference to form the National Students'

Organization, will bring a plan be
fore Excom Wednesday which will
co-ordinate activities of the various
groups interested in furthering stu
dent knowledge of world affairs.
It will be the second plan to be
brought before the campus in an
effort to simplify and unify on a
large scale the efforts of many stu
dents toward the same end—crea
tion of greater understanding o£ in
ternational problems.
The Daily presented a plan la. t
week in an editorial. It would es
tablish an international co-ordinat
ing committee under Excom which
would be responsible for the three
divisions of campus international
effort—social, practical, and educa
tional.
The second plan was worked out
by Miss Pond, Miss Sidwoll, and
Allen in co-operation with other
members of the ISC, of the Stanford
delegation to Chicago, and student:;
promoting an Institute of Interna
tional Affairs.
In simple outline their plan if.
this:
A unifying organization, as yet.
unnamed, would be set up by Ex
com to act as an advisory board. Its
membership would consist of the
following:
1. The secretary (chief officer)
of tlio Institute on International
Relations.
a) Head of the Institute conven
tion committee.
h) Head of the Institute discus
sion committee.
2. The secretary (chief officer)
of the International Survey Com
mittee.
a) Head of the ISC itinerary
committee.
I>) Head of the ISC selection
committee.
I?. The secretary (chief officer)
of the Stanford National Students'
Organization branch.
a) Heads of any subcommittees
of |i»e Stanford NSO.
4. The manager of an officc
which would handle and central
ize funds for the entire organiza
tion.
5. Head of the centralized pub
licity activities for the entire
group.
Faculty members will probably
participate through the Institute
program. They are now partici
pating in the ISC as members of
the ISC board selecting student
observers to Europe.
