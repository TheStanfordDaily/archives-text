## It's Habit Forming 
### 
In a campus opinion letter printed in yes
terday's Daily, Hubert Heffner, Jr., said that
perhaps apathy in student government is the
proper attitude. We would like to analyze his
st.dements in view of the fact that nominations
for the Feb. 5 election open today.
Heffner believes that we students are at
Stanford "for one particular purpose to gain
knowledge" and that time spent in student ac
tivities and government defeats the main pur
pose. But after all, what is education? Is it
<^:11 y leading books, attending classes, and get
ting ideas from professors? We think a large
pa it of our college education comes from prac
tical experience in meeting problems which
■ lie on a smaller scale similar to those that
will come up after graduation. In activities we
k'.irn to work with other people and get along
v/\ li them. In many activities we learn spe
< i.il techniques which will be valuable to us
in whatever job we may have later on.
"Society" exists everywhere. We cannot
ul ourselves off completely and say, "Now,
I .mi a student." This is what Heffner implies
hould be the "propei attitude." He believes
ihat 'i student voter dc.es not have the time to
l< .irn "the policies and attitudes ot the person
lor whom he is voting,' but tjiat the average
'outside' citizen has this time. But a man "on
the outside" may just as easily consider his
main puipose to be money-making and teel

that he is also too busy for intelligent voting.
Government, however, exists everywhere- -
in the family, the schoolroom, and the office.
It is a government to which we must not only
submit but contribute, consciously or uncon
sciously. The "I'll do what I damn please"
attitude exists in all governments and is just
as much present in the national government
as any other although Heffner believes that
persons on the outside have the time to take
an interest in national government and affairs.
These persons have no more time than we
have and take an interest in national govern
ment only if they have the habit of doing so
a habit which can very well develop in col
lege government. If we don't care about our
government here, we aren't going to care
any more for another government when we get
out.
It is true as Ileffner pointed out that the
University administration has a job of running
the school, but that job consists of managing
the business and academic parts of a large
institution. The students have a job of running
their social and practical activities, a necessary
part of school life, as we have shown. It is
for this reason that we have a student govern
ment with its various activities. To keep these
activities running, some students, at least,
must take an interest. But since an individual
cannot escape government, it is to his best
interests that he take c m active part. — N.B.

tivities and government defeats the main pur
pose. But after all, what is education? Is it
<^:11 y leading books, attending classes, and get

will come up after graduation. In activities we
k'.irn to work with other people and get along

"Society" exists everywhere. We cannot
ul ourselves off completely and say, "Now,
I .mi a student." This is what Heffner implies
hould be the "propei attitude." He believes
ihat 'i student voter dc.es not have the time to
l< .irn "the policies and attitudes ot the person
lor whom he is voting,' but tjiat the average
'outside' citizen has this time. But a man "on
the outside" may just as easily consider his
main puipose to be money-making and teel

that he is also too busy for intelligent voting.
Government, however, exists everywhere- -
in the family, the schoolroom, and the office.
It is a government to which we must not only
submit but contribute, consciously or uncon
sciously. The "I'll do what I damn please"
attitude exists in all governments and is just
as much present in the national government
as any other although Heffner believes that
persons on the outside have the time to take
an interest in national government and affairs.
These persons have no more time than we
have and take an interest in national govern
ment only if they have the habit of doing so
a habit which can very well develop in col
lege government. If we don't care about our
government here, we aren't going to care
any more for another government when we get
out.
It is true as Ileffner pointed out that the
University administration has a job of running
the school, but that job consists of managing
the business and academic parts of a large
institution. The students have a job of running
their social and practical activities, a necessary
part of school life, as we have shown. It is
for this reason that we have a student govern
ment with its various activities. To keep these
activities running, some students, at least,
must take an interest. But since an individual
cannot escape government, it is to his best
interests that he take c m active part. — N.B.
In a campus opinion letter printed in yes
terday's Daily, Hubert Heffner, Jr., said that
perhaps apathy in student government is the
proper attitude. We would like to analyze his
st.dements in view of the fact that nominations
for the Feb. 5 election open today.
