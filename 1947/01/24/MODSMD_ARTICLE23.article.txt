# BULL SESSION

### ED WILSON 
I was silting in tin- bath-tub the other night
w11• ii I got an idea. (Note to the editor: I also got
elean, in case you thought Ibis was going to be a
dirty story.) I decided 1 woidd write a poem for
Hull Session using the title "I Would Have Pro
posed to Her Last Saturday Night, But I Left the
King in the Tub." I've always found that a bath is
v-ry helpful for getting ideas—it's also an excellent
way to get clean, but that's the chance you take.
I had mentally composed the first two paragraphs
of my epic when my little toe got caught in the
plug and the tide went out, leaving me—like the
alcoholic who finished his last bottle—high and dry.
I decided to finish the poem in the Libe, after I put
some clothes on. I remembered reading in Esquire
ili.it there would be very little change in men's cloth
ing this year (and so far there's been very little
change in my pockets), so I donned my T-shirt with
the padded shoulders and jumped into the Levi's
that w-ie .standing in the corner. I couldn't find my
socks on the black carpet, so I decided to paint my
l«et brown and go barefooted. (You've probably
heard many a person say that I dress nattily, but I'm
here to deny the rumor once and for all—in fact, I
don't even know Natalie.)
As I walked into the Libe at 9:23, all the clocks
lopped. It just goes to prove that I have a face
that not only will stop a clock, but will stop a whole
building of clocks.
II was then that I noticed a girl running down
the stairs, which was unusual because most girls I
I.now just run down other girls or pedestrians. She

was wearing :i light dress and she luid what is known
as an "ice cream" figure—two scoops, overflowing.
"I'm in distress," she said tearfully.
"And how, you're in dat dress," I commented
without changing the subject. She struck me funny,
if you can call being kicked in the jaw funny.
''They won't let me take out a book without my
student body card," she said with a pleading voice.
I was tempted to make with a witty remark
concerning "student body," but steam was already
coming off my brow and I had noticed a "No Smok
ing" sign on the wall.
"1 left my card in one of my drawers in Roble,"
she continued.
This conversation was getting nuttier than an
almond grove.
"Would you let me use your card so I won't have
to walk all the way over to that nasty old Roble?
Pleeze?"
I told her I would on one condition: that she
read my uncompleted poem. 1 handed her the poem
which I had scribbled on the back of a Wrigley gum
wrapper.
She hurriedly read the poem and I asked her
what it needed for a finishing touch.
"A match," she replied as she deftly picked my
wallet out of my pocket and extracted the student
body card.
And that is why my inspirational poem does not
appear in this space at this time. However, I'm work
ing on another poem that promises to be even better.
It is called "Odo to Independence Day," or "My Aunt
Has Three Children, Next July She'll Celebrate the
Fourth."
