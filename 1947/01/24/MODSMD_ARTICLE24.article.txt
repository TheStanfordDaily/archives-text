# CAMPUS OPINION

Congratulations to observant and realistic Bill
Coughlin who, along with President Lynn T. White,
Jr., ol Mills, seems to feel that the inconsiderate,
expensive type of girl is all too plentiful on most
college campuses. And this type is going to have a
tough time, too. For even if she is born with a silver
spoon in her mouth, a girl's men friends just don't
appreciate it if she expects them to feed her with
micli a spoon. How about it, girls? Let's drink beer
instead of champagne, order hamburgers instead of
steaks, and take the boys out once in a while—on
you.

Yesterday's letter from Hubert Heffner, Jr.,
showed a hick of understanding of the purpose of a
.college education.
In the first pi ac:o, his .contention that students
• liould ignore student government sihee .they 'don't
have lo pay lor it, and spend all their time on stud
i«-.s because th'.-y do have to pay for it, is ridiculous.
True, student politics are far different from national
politics; but the task of learning to work with other
people is as important here as anywhere.
Perhaps Mr. Heffner also feels that we should
leave football, basketball, and other sports to high
school and professional teams. This would give us
all even more time to become avid "bookworms,"
and gain vast stores of wisdom.
Certainly we want to acquire knowledge, but
not just for the sake of knowledge. We must be
able to apply it. We can only apply what we learn

here at Stanford and other schools if we know not
only how to work with other people, but how other
people work. Our elections give us a good oppor
tunity to make these observations.
It is my firm belief that extra-curricular activi
ties are a vital part of a well-balanced education.

For the past decade a Student Union has been
desired and needed at Stanford. The present talk
of a War Memorial has brought the issue forth
again. The building of the Union has been evaded
long enough; yet it is being sidetracked again by
talk of a new Pavilion which could only be of limited
use.
Stanford considers itself worthy of being named
with the best universities in the country—and yet we
:190k Lo other schools for ideas of a War Memorial.
.Do other schools of note still need student unions?
jWe should build for our War Memorial tbe thing
most needed by the majority most of the time
namely, a student union. The Cellar, the Nitery, the
overcrowded libraries and gyms are hardily sufficient
for social activities, relaxation between classes, and
entertainment of visitors. Why can't all of this be
remedied by a single building with all accommo
dations—a ballroom, social rooms, lounges, guest
rooms, restaurant, and offices? This could even help
pay for itself if finances must be brought in here.
Students, this is your job. Please see that a mis
take is not made.

jWe should build for our War Memorial tbe thing
most needed by the majority most of the time
namely, a student union. The Cellar, the Nitery, the
overcrowded libraries and gyms are hardily sufficient
for social activities, relaxation between classes, and
entertainment of visitors. Why can't all of this be
remedied by a single building with all accommo

rooms, restaurant, and offices? This could even help
pay for itself if finances must be brought in here.

Congratulations to observant and realistic Bill
Coughlin who, along with President Lynn T. White,
Jr., ol Mills, seems to feel that the inconsiderate,
expensive type of girl is all too plentiful on most
college campuses. And this type is going to have a
tough time, too. For even if she is born with a silver
spoon in her mouth, a girl's men friends just don't
appreciate it if she expects them to feed her with
micli a spoon. How about it, girls? Let's drink beer
instead of champagne, order hamburgers instead of
steaks, and take the boys out once in a while—on
you.

Yesterday's letter from Hubert Heffner, Jr.,
showed a hick of understanding of the purpose of a
.college education.
In the first pi ac:o, his .contention that students
• liould ignore student government sihee .they 'don't
have lo pay lor it, and spend all their time on stud
i«-.s because th'.-y do have to pay for it, is ridiculous.
True, student politics are far different from national
politics; but the task of learning to work with other
people is as important here as anywhere.
Perhaps Mr. Heffner also feels that we should
leave football, basketball, and other sports to high
school and professional teams. This would give us
all even more time to become avid "bookworms,"
and gain vast stores of wisdom.
Certainly we want to acquire knowledge, but
not just for the sake of knowledge. We must be
able to apply it. We can only apply what we learn

here at Stanford and other schools if we know not
only how to work with other people, but how other
people work. Our elections give us a good oppor
tunity to make these observations.
It is my firm belief that extra-curricular activi
ties are a vital part of a well-balanced education.

For the past decade a Student Union has been
desired and needed at Stanford. The present talk
of a War Memorial has brought the issue forth
again. The building of the Union has been evaded
long enough; yet it is being sidetracked again by
talk of a new Pavilion which could only be of limited
use.
