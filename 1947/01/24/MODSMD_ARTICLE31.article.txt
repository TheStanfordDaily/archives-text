Rumors Are Flying, and Sgt. Slinger's
Up in the Air About the Whole Thing

Rumors have reached my cars that some of the fraternity boys arc
up in arms over my treatment of the basketball team. They seem to
have gathered the impression that 1 considered Everett Dean's men a
bunch of bums, unfit to represent Stanford. Believe me, nothing could be
farther from the truth.
When I say the cagers are green. I mean RELATIVELY green; green
only in comparison to others this season. II I say they look futile, I mean
RELATIVELY futile. In the absolute sense they are nothing of the sort;
they arc one of the better basketball teams in Stanford's history. They
just came along at a time when everyone else is good too.
That has been my idea all along, so I started looking tor other opinions
to support my own. I cornered one of the b'tter-known men in the ath
letic administration; after hemming and hawing a while, he finally came
out and said that the current team, in his opinion, could have whipped
9(1 per cent of the entries in the Southern Division races over the last 20
years—and he's seen 'em all.
So you can see they're a pretty fair hunch id hoys—not the equal of
the Luisctti or Pollard-Dallmar squads, hut quite classy nonetheless,
li s just a had break that they came along at the present time.
Why are all basketball teams throughout the country so good right
now? That should be obvious. Almost every school has it choice trom the
cream of the crop over a period of years. r lhe best ol the boys lrom before
I lie war are back; others reached maturity during the war and played on
service teams; and finally, the usual fine crop ol high school graduates
is available.
Things Are Tough All Over Dept.
In other words, the average college basketball coach has about three
times as many good men to choose from, fcellows who in the normal
»-nurse of events would have been regulars are lucky to make the B squads.
Any first-stringer these days is good, believe me. Circumstances have kept
iii4*ii in all sports lrom graduating at the normal time, but time itsell hasn t
stood still; just as many young males are reaching college age each year
as forme rly so each year there is a new crop of good young basketball
players.
If I kid the basket hallo rs a little, and make jokes about them, it's
merely because I think it's the best way to pass oil the unpleasant
present—hut don't get the idea (hat the team Stanford has now isn t
to make a line record for itsell. Personally. I don t even think
they'll end up in the cellar this year. They'll win some more games,
hut naturally they'll lose some too.
The present may make you unhappy; it. so. look to the future. The 47
learn is made up almost entirely of lower-classmen they 11 be back. 1m
as positive its I can be that, before the lust man ol the piesent team yiad
ilutes, there'll be a basketball championship won by the Fann. Wishiul
thinking? I don't think so; there is fine material available. Everett Dean
is one ul the finer coaches. Ergo, we win.
Don't <»et Sore Till Yon 'Learn the Seore
Don Liebendorfer has announced that some of the tickets to this
weekend's hoop games will be placed on public sale. Now wait a minute
before you go reaching for your shootin arn and listen lo the whole stoiy.
It's merely an experiment. Not too many students are expected this week
end; the games aren't league contests, and there are quite a few conflicting
events scheduled.
There's no good reason why some of the seats in the Pavilion should
he allowed lo remain unoccupied when the general public is ciying foi
a chance to look the Stanfords over. The S.A.C. feels sure student de
mand will not eat up all the available scats, so it's placing a bloc of tick
ets before the public.
Remember, this is only an experiment; if it lails, it will nevci happen
again. Actually, there will be as many student tickets available as foi
the Cal game; the Olympic Club has no student body tor which provision
must be made, and the Fresno Staters don t plan to bring a laige looting
contingent. . ...
Cal you know, always gets 1,000 of the Pavilion s 2,700 capacity when
they play down here. That leaves 1.700 tickets available for 7,500 stu
dents and a not-so-small faculty: slightly more than 20 per cent of
Stanford's population can get in and no outsiders.
Of course no tickets to Conference games will be sold to the public;
after all. basketball is a student affair and the students come first with

till- Stanford S.A.C. California, in
cidentally, let 1.000 tickets go to the
public for the Stanford game up
there recently, and a like number
went to Stanford students; that left
the Bears 5,000 seats for 22.000 stu
dents and a gigantic faculty. Times
arc tough all over. Of course if we
had a brand new War Memorial
Pavilion . . .
Sweet, Sweet Charity
Wednesday evening a local paper
carried a story to the effect that
the Stanford Administration had re
fused use of its Stadium to a group
promoting a charity pro game for
next pre-season. Dr. Alvin C. Eu
rich was quoted as, saying the pub- j
lie would consider it a Stanford j
promotion, and that the school
would be placed in a bad light.
Now old Sgt. Slingcr has noth
ing whatsoever against profes- j
siottal sports as such: he thinks
they fill an important spot in
American life. Still, a university
has to think about its reputation;
;t reputation is hard to make, but
easy to lose—so if the higher-ups
honestly believe that letting pro
fessionals play in Stanford Sta
dium would cause unfavorable
public comment, it's not only their
right hut their duty to turn the
offer down.
Usually such "charity" affairs
prove to be charity for the pro
moters; the donation to charity is
the net profit, but first all the ex
penses are paid. You'd be surprised j
how high those "expenses" can j
mount.
II it were stipulated that the EN- j
TIRE gate receipts would go to ,
charity, with the participants do- j
nating their services, I think the ]
use of the Stadium should be 1
okayed by all means. The story I ,
mentioned before leads one to be- j
lieve thsit such is the case — but
somehow I doubt it. If I'm wrong,
the millennium has arrived.
