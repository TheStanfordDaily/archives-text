# Olympic Club, Fresno State Test Indian Basketballers
## 
### ART SHAPIRO 
Trying to boost their season's average over the .333 mark, the
Indians will face off against the Olympic Club at 8:30 tonight.
Starting the same lineup which brought misery to the Westwood
Wonders and almost turned the same trick against Cal, the Stan
ford varsity will go into this contest as favorites, for the first time
since the opening date with San Jose State.

The Cardinal quintet's record of
i five games won against 1.1 losses
| is far from perfect, but by reason of
I the team's fine showing in the four
■ conference games to date, and the
previous win against the club team,
■ the home boys will carry odds into
the clash. No admission fee will be
' charged at the gate for either the
j game tonight or the one on Saturday
with Fresno State.
OLYMPICS IN SHAPE
Coach Wally Cameron, former
USI player and coach, has brought
the Olympic Club into line shape
for the clash this evening. At the
present time the Olympics are the
liest independent squad in the Isay
Area, and will be out to avenge
I their loss to the Cards early in the
season. Starting for the Olympic
Club will be such former stars as
Fred Linari of Stanford, Spillanc
of USF, Mangin of Santa Clara,
and John Mctiee of California.

' same five which almost nipped the
j Cal Bear last Friday evening. Mor
ley Thompson and Babe Higgins at
the forward positions. Dick Berlin
and Captain Dave Davidson at the

! center. The Stanford quintet will
; hold every advantage over the club
; bers, except experience.
YOUTHFUL SQUADS

Fresno State squad will pit two of
the youngest teams in the stale

freshman outfit.
