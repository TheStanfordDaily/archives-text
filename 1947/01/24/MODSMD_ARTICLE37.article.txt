boxing highlighted the return of the
All-U tourney to the Farm.
WILLET WINS OVER HOWE

footwork and endurance proved
the margin of victory.

in a close decision. The bout was in
doubt all the way, with both boys
hitting hard and displaying lop
notch form. Hewitt, who has de

from bell-to-bell, as was Alius.
