# '93 Roughs Were Rough But Food Was Smooth
## 
### 
A profound philosopher, Daniel Boone perhaps, once said, "A man is
no better than his vittles." According to this eloquent theory, today's
Stanford Rough is about as rough as a page of Esquire when compared
with Roughs who sauntered around the Farm in 1893. If you flaynt your
appetite in the Encina dining hall at $57.50 a month, you'd better pull up

a {-.traitjacket and sit down before
looking at a typical Encina menu of
1893.
It's interesting to note that the
overhead only amounted to $14.50
per month in those days. So put on
your best wistful expression and
glance at this.
