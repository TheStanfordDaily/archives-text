Though Stanford students have a
great amount of spiritual vitality, it
is going to waste because our social
culture will not let it grow, de
clared Mr. Matthew Evans, instruc
tor in history, to a group of students
and faculty gathered at Air. Paul
Kirkpatrick's home to analyze the
basic assumptions of religion.
"Those of us seeking a channel
for our faith," he continued, "find
great difficulty as we are battling
against the whole context of our
society."
"In the last century Christian cul
ture has lost -ill of its basic assump
tions. but still preserves a ritual of
behavior. Since our society is now
organized in an un-Christian man
ner, our only hope is to recognize
this fact, and then deal with it ac
cordingly," he concluded.
