BERKELEY, Calif., Jan. 2?,.— (UP)
—A young scientist who developed
America's top-secret "electron gun"
while confined to bed revealed to
night. details of the wartime radar
jamming transmitter for the first
time.
The ultra secret resnatron was
the idea of Dr. David H. Sloan, Uni
versity of California electrical en
gineer, who was forced by a disease
to work in bed for many months.
The resnatron, a six-foot high fre
quency tube that sprayed explosive
bursts of electrons and blanketed
radar apparatus for .'5OO miles, was
credited with much of the success
of the mass daylight air raids over
Germany.
Sloan and Dr. L. C. Marshall
launched work on the rensatron in
1938. By spring of 1945 they had
evolved a "gun" with which the
allies were hurling more raw radio
power into the air than any other
amplifier ever constructed.
