Pay telephones will be installed in all men's and women's halls for
all outgoing calls as soon as the necessary equipment can he procured,
Alf E. Brandin, University business manager, has announced.
Action on the telephone problem resulted from student complaints
about the Toyon-Encina-Branner switchboard service. Use of pay
phones, it is expected, will relieve the peak-hour pressure on the
switchboards, which will continue to handle incoming calls.
"We don't know when the phones will be put in," Brandin said. "So
far we have only 27, which would only take care of Encina and Toyon.
We'll need 50 altogether.
The University dormitories are supposedly 011 the hotel system where
the telephones and rates charged are for incoming calls only. All out
going calls are made on pay phones or on the regular phone at a charge
of 10 cents per call.
The University has been abusing this system for years and was able
to get by when there were fewer people and thus fewer phone calls for
the switchboards. But with the present congestion it is no longer pos
sible to continue the privileges the students have had, Mr. Brandin said.
