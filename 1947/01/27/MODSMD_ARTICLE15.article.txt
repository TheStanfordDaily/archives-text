stitute. They would be: (1) a co- ;
ordinating Executive Committee, (2) |
a Finance Committee. (3) a Pub- !
licity Committee, and (4) a Nomi- j

tion of all Stanford student activi
ties centering on the international
scene wiil be presented for discus
sion at a meeting of the World Af
fairs Club tonight at 8 in the lower
lounge of the Women's Clubhouse.
The plan was drawn up last week
for the purpose of expanding the
club's proposal for an annual World
Affairs Institute to tie in with ex
tracurricular activities.
ALTERNATIVE IDEA
An alternative plan, designed
chiefly to give force to the Interna
tional Survey Committee (I.SC.),

Plugging student participation, the
proposal offered by Charles Martin

of International Relations of the
A.5.5.U.," a "planning organization
for providing a program of educa
tion, inspiration, and responsibility
for action in international rela
tions": (2) the annual World Affairs

Institute; and (.'i) active participa
tion by Stanford leaders in the Na
tional Student Organization (N. 5.0.)
and other national and international
student conferences, and organiza
tion by the University of a School
of International Affairs.
The principal part of the planning
committee's report, however, dies in
the organization that would be set
forth under the proposed Institute
of International Relations of the
A.S.S.U. This consists of:
