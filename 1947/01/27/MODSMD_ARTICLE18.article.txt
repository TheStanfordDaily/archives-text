venge and that by hiding millions
of dollars' worth of assets in neu- !
tral countries is cheating American !
and British taxpayers.

| word report that "denazification is
} a farce." The report has been sent;
j to prime ministers and foreign see- !
! retaries of Allied nations for study, j
j Among those who signed there

I ers and foreign collaborators arc di- ;
j reeling a network of Nazi organi- j
j zations in Germany, and they are
j using "silent terror" to keep Nazism
I and German nationalism alive, and I
} that a secret Nazi sabotage organi
zation has been formed to hinder

J trial recovery. Using passive re- j
I sistancc instead of outright vio
