# NATIONAL DEFENSE NEEDED
## Control of Atomic Bomb Impossible, Says Blandy 
### 
♦ WASHINGTON. Jan. 26 (UP).
—The nation's top military lead
ers warned today that full-scale
atomic warfare overshadows
| any unprepared nation and
| called for a strong and alert
j U.S. Army and Navy until
| world peace is secure.
They painted a vivid picture of
i the horrors of World War 111
j guided missils, atomic bombs and
I one-day casualties of 25,000,000 per
sons. A strong United Statu* is the
only way to prevent it, they said,
until the United Nations sets up an
effective international police force.
HOPE FOR U.N.
Secretary r>f War Robert I'. Pat
| terson, Viee-Adm. W. H. P. Blandy,
j chief of the Bikini atomic homb
tests, and Gen. George C. Kcnney,
Strategic Air Forces commander,
led a parade of military chieftains
and civilian experts who spoke be
! fore tlie closing session of the 21st.
| Women's Patriotic Conference on
j National Defense.
All hoped that the United Nations
would be the answer to long-sought,
world peace but they agreed that,
until it is a proven organization, the
United States must take the lead in
j putting down any possible aggressor
! nation.
DISARMAMENT INADVISABLE
Blandy asserted that world dir.-
I armament, as demanded by "well-
I meaning but impractical pacifists,"
lis not desirable at this time. It.
' never will be, he said, until "one
[ can no longer find such words as
| hatred, greed, envy and suspicion
! in the dictionary."
He predicted that the next con
flict will be an atomic war no niat
j ter what is done during peacetime
;to outlaw it. International control
of atomic energy will fail in war, he
said, since the only deterrent, will
j be the pledged word of nations or
J fear of retaliation and "neither can
i be depended upon."
Til REE REQUI REM ENTS
I Patterson said the three basic re
j quirements for an army sufficient, to
| meet the nation's needs were uni
: versal military training, a volunteer
Regular Army and adequate funds.
Kenncy, warning that any future
enemy will try to knock out U.S.
j industry at one swoop, said the na
tion could suffer 25,000,000 casual
tics in the first day of another war.
He predicted such an attack will
j come across the North Polar basin,
i the shortest air route from the Eu
j ropcan-Asiatie land mass. He said
! it would consist of piloted and pi
lotlcss planes and radio-controlled
missiles and rockets, all loaded with
| atom bombs and super-explosives.
