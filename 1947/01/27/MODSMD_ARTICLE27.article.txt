## Give It Some Thought 
### 
With the post-war student body expansion
the problems facing Excom, our legislative
group, have multiplied so rapidly they threat
en to stifle any potentially successful activity
in a mountain of details so great it is impossi
ble to weigh and judge them all.
This is hardly the fault of Excom. And that
:;ome of Excom's members are distressed by
the hodge-podge of problems that face them
is an encouraging sign.
As tiiis seems to be the case, then it is prob
<tbly the time for Excom to put aside for a few
moments all of its problems and concentrate
>n just which is the best dnd most efficient
way to handle th ngs at present and in the
■utuxe.
There are a suggestions we would like
•) offer which we hope will aid Excom in sort
ng out the wheat from the chaff.
Prior to the war, the student body was small
jnough so that by the time c person was a
senior he knew or knew of almost every other
person in his class. Excom was run success
fully then somewhat on a town-hall basis. Ac
tivities and problems that arose affected in
some way every person of the University
community. Subjects that were to come be
fore Excom were topics of conversation in the
Cellar, living groups, and on the Quad. The
r.impus was so compact that Excom members
I:new most of the background of every sub
ject before it was presented to them on Wed
nesday nights.
Mow the situation presents a different * pic-
Lire. Problems arise that affect only particu
lar groups, about which other campus groups
know nothing. Excom members freguently do
jk*l know each other until they meet for the
first time after they are elected, and rarely do
they see each other except at weekly meet

ings. Problems that come before them for
decisions are so numerous and varied that it
is an exception when they even know of the
problems' existence, much less their back
ground.
Thus a more efficient system of operation
seems in order for Excom—a system that will
allow Excom members to come to meetings
on Wednesdays prepared to act on issues.
Too often they now discover after lengthy
discussion that they possess an insufficient
amount of facts on which to base a decision.
A number of standing committees within
Excom, similar to the present legal committee
each to handle and investigate different
types of issues- would help to expedite busi
ness. Problems presented to Excom could be
relegated to the proper committee which
would investigate each particular issue dur
ing the week and then present its findings and
recommendations to Excom at the next meet
ing.
Although not all subjects could be handled
by these sub-committees, the majority could
be settled guickly and efficiently without a
great deal of discussion at meetings.
There is another function of Excom, in addi
tion to merely handling subjects brought be
fore it by student groups, that is often over
looked. And that is looking for and anticipat
ing campus needs and improvements.
Dozens of the present problems would
never arise if Excom would just quietly sit
down and decide the basic purposes and func
tions of a student government, and then plan
a definite set of aims accordingly. One Ex
com meeting devoted to this would clear the
air of a lot of discussion by various students
as to the reason for a student government
other than as a body to approve social events.
