# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
Last Friday I wont over to the Bookstore to get
iny money back on that stapler 1 gave my girl (Okay,
Coni'Min, so you away Cadillacs). In Ye Olde
Stanford Shoppe I overheard a very remarkable
conversation between one of the Farm femmes and
a salesgirl.
"Do you return the money when an article isn't
salislactory?" the sweet young thing asked.
"That depends on the article," replied the sales
: il l.
"This is a book."
"What was wrong with it?"
"1 didn't like the way it ended," the charming
little creature replied.
Ah, I told myself, here is a girl with an unusual
mind and a face to match. She was the kind of
."ill I could give my name to—but not my right
name. She had a sylph-like figure, and she probably
kept it all to her sylph, too.
When the salesgirl finally waited on me, I pointed
to (he display window and said: "I would like that
book in the window."
"Silly boy," she replied; "it already is in the
window." Because the conversation held no future
for me, I started to walk out of the store. Just as I
reached the door, I bumped into the little gem who
had wanted her money back on the book.
"Pardon me, but you look like Helen Brown," I
jaid in a smooth manner (Approach No. 320, page 72).
"Well. I look even worse in gray," she said imme
diately. It wasn't a bad comeback considering it was
a jok"-book she held in her hand at (he time.

I saw the possibility of being witty, too, so I said:
"Well, I'd really like to see you in something white."
Beiore I could deliver my punch-line, she said: "Yes,
I know—in a bath-tub."
"What's your name?" I asked, feeling defeat (I
was leeling de feet because I suddenly realized I had
forgotten de shoes and I was getting frost-bite).
"M-m-m-mabel," she stuttered.
"I'll just call you Mabel for short," I replied.
"Oh, I love men who are frank," she said.
"Too bad. My name's Ed—Ed Wilson and I write
some Bull Sessions."
"So you're the guy! They should call you 'Moses,'
because every time you open your mouth the bull
rushes. Tell me about yourself, Wilson. Are you a
real Stanford rough? Are you a letter-man?"
"I sure am," I replied. "Whatever a girl wants to
do, I always letter. Actually, however, I'm a track
man." ' •
"What railroad?"
"You seem like an apt girl, Mabel. Is your room
mate apt, too?"
"If she gets the chance," she said as she ran
away to the Cellar lor a large glass of ice with no
coke. As she flitted away. I laughed aloud. After
all, life is just a joke—and I'd give my life for an
original one. Someone will probably take my life
for the following:

seems that a customer at Longbarn last night found

"If she gets the chance," she said as she ran
away to the Cellar lor a large glass of ice with no
coke. As she flitted away. I laughed aloud. After
all, life is just a joke—and I'd give my life for an
original one. Someone will probably take my life
for the following:
Rabbit-joke-to-end-all-Longbarn-rabbit-jokes: It
seems that a customer at Longbarn last night found
a hare in his soup.
Last Friday I wont over to the Bookstore to get
iny money back on that stapler 1 gave my girl (Okay,
Coni'Min, so you away Cadillacs). In Ye Olde
Stanford Shoppe I overheard a very remarkable
conversation between one of the Farm femmes and
a salesgirl.
"Do you return the money when an article isn't
salislactory?" the sweet young thing asked.
"That depends on the article," replied the sales
: il l.
"This is a book."
"What was wrong with it?"
"1 didn't like the way it ended," the charming
little creature replied.
Ah, I told myself, here is a girl with an unusual
mind and a face to match. She was the kind of
."ill I could give my name to—but not my right
name. She had a sylph-like figure, and she probably
kept it all to her sylph, too.
When the salesgirl finally waited on me, I pointed
to (he display window and said: "I would like that
book in the window."
"Silly boy," she replied; "it already is in the
window." Because the conversation held no future
for me, I started to walk out of the store. Just as I
reached the door, I bumped into the little gem who
had wanted her money back on the book.
"Pardon me, but you look like Helen Brown," I
jaid in a smooth manner (Approach No. 320, page 72).
"Well. I look even worse in gray," she said imme
diately. It wasn't a bad comeback considering it was
a jok"-book she held in her hand at (he time.

I saw the possibility of being witty, too, so I said:
"Well, I'd really like to see you in something white."
Beiore I could deliver my punch-line, she said: "Yes,
I know—in a bath-tub."
"What's your name?" I asked, feeling defeat (I
was leeling de feet because I suddenly realized I had
forgotten de shoes and I was getting frost-bite).
"M-m-m-mabel," she stuttered.
"I'll just call you Mabel for short," I replied.
"Oh, I love men who are frank," she said.
"Too bad. My name's Ed—Ed Wilson and I write
some Bull Sessions."
"So you're the guy! They should call you 'Moses,'
because every time you open your mouth the bull
rushes. Tell me about yourself, Wilson. Are you a
real Stanford rough? Are you a letter-man?"
"I sure am," I replied. "Whatever a girl wants to
do, I always letter. Actually, however, I'm a track
man." ' •
"What railroad?"
"You seem like an apt girl, Mabel. Is your room
mate apt, too?"
"If she gets the chance," she said as she ran
away to the Cellar lor a large glass of ice with no
coke. As she flitted away. I laughed aloud. After
