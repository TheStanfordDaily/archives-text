T<. the Editor:
Now that a coalition of women and athletes on
Excom has defeated \the proposal, it's left for us the
students to put it through—l refer, of course, to
♦ leetfoneering and Exeonvs. recertt , refusal •tb sanc
tion it. even on a modest ,scale. 1 < , .
The present execrable state of affairs must not
tontinue—on 'that even an unwilling Exeom seems
to have agreed. Thus far Excom seems to have done
little but sit comfortably back and deplore the situ
ation in loud tones. To be sure, election rules have
been revised, but Excom had little to lose there for
•my changes at all in the rules could hardly have
been for the worse.
However, when it came to taking any positive
action to stimulate interest in elections, Excom re
fused to stick iLs neck out—and, after all. why should
we expect the members of Excom to bo anxious to
change the state of affairs under which they them
selves were elected? Perhaps they have good reason
to fear the results of a truly popular election.
Excom's failure to act in the matter leaves it
squarely up to us, and whether we are willing to
shoulder the job thus cast off by our own repre
sentatives. is up to us in the coming election, when
electioneering will be the principal issue at stake.
Merely because we don't know the candidates, are
we to sit back as in the past and continue to allow
one-filth of the student body to choose the officers
who manage our affairs? I say "No!"
What was behind this 20 per cent turnout in the
last elections? The principal reason for the inertia
tluis evidenced lies in the greatly increased si/.e of
the student body. The average student is fortunate
indeed if he knows even three or four names on the
ballot and the odds are good that if he knows even
that "huge" number of names, it is because he has
encountered them on the sports page or because
they have already been associated with student eov-

eminent. Lacking a Block S, the newcomer, no mat
ter what his qualifications, seems to stand little
chance against such odds as these.
The student body votes for the names it knows
or it doesn't vote at all. That is as it should be. The
tusk before us. then, is to see to it that in the future
we know the candidates who seek our votes. Then
and only then can we be expected to turn out and
vote. But above all, then and only then can our
student government claim to represent the Stanford
family and not as at present merely some minor
faction of that, family.
Electioneering is the only real solution to the
problem. Martin Anderson has suggested interviews
in the Daily. The Daily has been in existence for
some time, now, but doesn't seem able to make its
presentation of the candidates interesting enough
to draw many readers to their attempts. KSU will
have an equally difficult task in keeping the atten
tion of Stanford's dial-twiddlers, and candidates have
always been able to talk to living groups. Thus, the
solution is not to be found in any of these suggested
remedies, for they are in existence already, and have
demonstrated in alarming fashion their inadequacy
to cope with the task.
The sanction of electioneering is the only means
by which we can overcome our own natural tenden
cies to l"t things ride, and we are forced to take
thi.s action ourselves. With electioneering permit
ted, the burden of stimulating student interest will
lie directly on the candidates themselves, rather than
self-appointed organizations who have a "we-know
better-than-thou" attitude. Electioneering is the
only real means by which we may become acquainted
with the men and women we are electing. The
candidate's ability, initiative, and ingenuity can then
guide us in our choice, rather than his prowess on
the athletic field or in other entirely irrelevant ac
tivities.
