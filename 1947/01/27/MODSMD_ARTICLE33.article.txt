# World Understanding Is 'I' Club Aim
## 
### BIPAN CHANDRA 
After going through the most
terrible war of history, the world
is again standing at cross-roads
and people ask each other "What
now, peace or war?" Through this
haze of confusion, people all over
the world are coming to the reali
zation that one of the most potent
causes of war is the misunder
standing caused between them by
ignorance and mispropaganda. In
ternational Club at Stanford stands
for promoting international under
standing.
Stanford attracts a iurge number
of students from foreign countries,
every year. Here, they come to live
together with American students.
International Club was formed' to
increase these social contacts be
tween American and foreign stu
dents. Numerous opportunities are
provided toward this end.
STUDENT SESSIONS
At every meeting of the 'I' club,
students get a chance to meet each
other and hold bull sessions over a
cup of coffee and cookies. Every
meeting is high-lighted by interest
ing talks on economic, social, and
political problems of different coun
tries and of the world. All talks are
followed by discussions among the

| members. So far numerous talks
| have been given on different coun
j tries by people who have spent a
major part of their lives in those
countries.
To encourage social contacts be
tween members, dances and picnics
are held every quarter. Another
"big" feature ol the club are the for
eign "banquets" presented every
quarter.
ATOMIC PROBLEMS;
As one member once remarked, if
Vishitisky and Baruch or their
wives had been members of Stan-
I ford 'I club, the atomic energy prob
lem would have been solved at least
a year back. It is ihe efforts of clubs
like T club that can form a real
basis for international understand
ing.
It has been calculated that so far
| 51 nations have been represented in
the '1' club meetings (excluding
Lower Slobovia). But that does not
mean it is a foreign student's club.
American students have always
formed a majority of the members.
'1' club usually meets on alternate
Sundays and its membership fee is
only 50 cents a quarter. The officers
of the club are elected for the year

at the beginning of the autumn
quarter. This year, under the presi
dency of John Menzel, T club has
finished a very successful quarter.
Now that Stanford students are
becoming more and more interna
tional minded, 'I' club offers them
excellent opportunities to meet and
know foreign students intimately
and to contribute toward interna
: tional understanding and world
I peace.
Keeping its high objectives in
view, '1' club will continue its activi
ties in future, always keeping its
j door open to all interested students
and faculty members.
