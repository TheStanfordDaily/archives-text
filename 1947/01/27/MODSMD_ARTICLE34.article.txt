What's the Heel? Public Prints Ain't
Sympathetic to Farm Basketball learn
With all due deference to their partisans, and they are many, it be
hooves us to change a nickel into pennies and contribute two cents (40 per
cent of our fortune and liquidated assets) to the argument. The beef has
been registered that the public prints—of which this is one —have not
been entirely sympathetic to the endeavors of our basketball team.
We are not trying to be funny; the argument can lie safelv maintained
that the basketball team has not been too sympathetic recently with the
spectators. Perhaps we are not being stringently fair by referring to the
two games played in the local crackerbox last weekend. However, they
were played—or should it be said, put on?
We can see no purpose in writing ringing letters home to mother ex
tolling the virtues of a team that took 12 minutes before it could score a
field goal. The only reason the score at that stage wasn't 2t5 to 3 instead
of (I to 3 was because the opposition was Fresno State, a team that was
playing its third game in three nights, and definitely not the world's great
est aggregation of hardwood performers.
Stanford won Saturday night because the team they played was dead
tired and not very good to begin with; Friday night they won over the
Olympic Club—a mere shadow of the terrific teams that represented the
Winged '()" in past years—merely because the visitors arc rapidly ap
proaching middle age and hence no match for fresh young teams. Per
haps it was all for the good. A letdown after the tragic Cal series was
imminent, and it was merely by the grace of the schedule that we met
these two conglomerations of left-footed individuals—instead of a couple
of outfits that would have taken the squad apart, literally.
Santa (llara Broncos Would ve Hacked Us
llad the schedule for last week and this weekend been reversed, U.S.F.
and Santa Clara would have made us look like we were playing with last
year's squad. As it is, unless the letdown is over and the bad games are
out of the team's system, the aforetlireatened occurences will happen. And
no ifs. U.S.F. and Santa Clara both hold decisions over Cal, and whether
or no they caught the Bear on his off night makes little difference in cold
unemotional figures (in agate type).
The brutal facts, no matter how much you varnish 'em, are still
brutal. The team has been beaten fairly consistently up to now, and will
be beaten again, but not as consistently, I hope. And the reason they
have been consistently beaten is that they have not played consistently
well. Whether they can or not is up to them. They have, and this has
been admitted to me personally by ultra-rabid partisans of Cal s Nibs
Price, the best coach in the league. Year in and year out. Everett Dean
turns out the prettiest plays seen on the courts this side of the Continen
tal Divide.
When it works, it's as impressive a sight as a home run. Mostly, how
ever, it doesn't work; it still looks good, but it cloesn t work. Why.' Prob
ably the bes't answer is an indirect one like this: at the first Cal game (at
Berkeley) a City sportswriter said the Indians were big enough to take
care of themselves, but that they weren't very graceful. It takes a lot of
grace to work precision stuff, like Dean coaches, and the guys just don t
have it. They're big, they're rough, they re tough, but you can t con
ceivably say any of them are exactly cat-footed.
So what? So they bull their way through, or shoot from far out. The
power stuff has the added detriment of provoking whistle blowing. The
shooting from far out means that unless the ball is dead in the net its not
going in; the rim shots invariably spin back out.
They'll Be Better Next Year, He Says
One affirmative fact in their favor is that they 11 all be back next year,
and most of them for another year after that. Maybe Dean can impart
some of the grace to them that marked his pre-war teams. There's room
for that much improvement. And they'll improve; nobody can say that
any of them have reached their peak—not by a long shot. The first five
won't get any taller, which is not the insuperable handicap that some seem
to think. In the first Cal game. Davidson made a monkey out of Hanger
under the boards, and the others are somewhat adept at ball hawking in
a like manner.
Two of the men on the team have been singled out by the rank and
file as being standouts —center Bill Stephenson and Captain Dave David
son. who is listed at guard and plays forward. Stephenson is a terror in
the slot, particularly with his pivot overhead bank shot. It works only
when he is close enough to the basket—about five feet away. Beyond
that his effectiveness at shooting decreases rapidly, due to faulty eye
sight.
However, there is hope for the lanky Texican. Bill Drehobl, a sub for
ward, is likewise troubled by bad eyes, but has improved rapidly in
shooting since acquiring contact lenses. When Stephenson gets his—and
gets used to them—there should be no stopping him from anywhere near
the keyhole. But his awkwardness is still a big handicap he must over
come before he becomes the fine player an S.F. sportswriter said he had
the makings jof.
Davidson is a little smoother and a lot springier and is probably the
slickest court man on the team. The big chunky captain, however, is too
prone to fouls, whether intentional or not; they almost counterbalance
his adeptness with the high lob from the corners or any place 30 feet
out. He too has enormous possibilities for improvement—and it the
present crop of cagcrs is to bring any titles back to the Farm, these must
be realized.
Dick Berlin's a (larhon Copy, King Size
The other guard spot is held down by Dick Berlin, a physical carbon,
even to shooting style, of Davidson. Berlin is slower than the rest ot the
varsity, and except for squirrel-caging, blocks and double screens figures
little in the playmaking under the boards. The big thing here is his de
fensive ability, particularly in the corners and along the sidelines; and
here he is unsurpassed by this squad. A little more speed, a little more
grace, etc., etc.
At the forwards are Morley Thompson and Babe Higgins, the converted
footballer. Thompson is a good playmaker and should be the one man on
the team to display grace in the future. When that time comes, all Ste
phenson will have to do is Iced him from the slot on the post plays. A
combination like that this year, and the team would have led everybody
they have played from wire to wire. Thompson is an easygoing lad who
occasionally erupts with a rash of two-pointers with a beautiful jump
and push and a flat trajectory shot that's as good as anything Cal's Andy
Wolfe can do.
Iliggins is the lad who made all-Coast while in the V-12 at Cal in 44.
Probably the best of the long long-shots, he has speed, finesse and a lot
of savvy, and he's almost as indefatigable as Wolfe is. But he's weak
under the boards and almost ineffectual on plays within the horn. Al
though he's listed at forward, he actually takes over Davidson's back
court duties, leaving Dave, Stephenson, and Thompson in the forecourt.
On defense, he's right behind Berlin in effectiveness and particularly
good at stealing the ball and otherwise rattling the offense.
That's the first five, and that's how they look (to me) at the halfway
mark. Maybe you don't think as I do, but if this squad's to salvage any
thing from the season, some of those improvements mentioned had better
start showing up.

out of the team's system, the aforetlireatened occurences will happen. And
no ifs. U.S.F. and Santa Clara both hold decisions over Cal, and whether
or no they caught the Bear on his off night makes little difference in cold
unemotional figures (in agate type).
The brutal facts, no matter how much you varnish 'em, are still
brutal. The team has been beaten fairly consistently up to now, and will
be beaten again, but not as consistently, I hope. And the reason they
have been consistently beaten is that they have not played consistently
well. Whether they can or not is up to them. They have, and this has
been admitted to me personally by ultra-rabid partisans of Cal s Nibs
Price, the best coach in the league. Year in and year out. Everett Dean
turns out the prettiest plays seen on the courts this side of the Continen
tal Divide.
When it works, it's as impressive a sight as a home run. Mostly, how
ever, it doesn't work; it still looks good, but it cloesn t work. Why.' Prob
ably the bes't answer is an indirect one like this: at the first Cal game (at
Berkeley) a City sportswriter said the Indians were big enough to take
care of themselves, but that they weren't very graceful. It takes a lot of
grace to work precision stuff, like Dean coaches, and the guys just don t
have it. They're big, they're rough, they re tough, but you can t con
ceivably say any of them are exactly cat-footed.
So what? So they bull their way through, or shoot from far out. The
power stuff has the added detriment of provoking whistle blowing. The
shooting from far out means that unless the ball is dead in the net its not
going in; the rim shots invariably spin back out.
They'll Be Better Next Year, He Says
One affirmative fact in their favor is that they 11 all be back next year,
and most of them for another year after that. Maybe Dean can impart
some of the grace to them that marked his pre-war teams. There's room
for that much improvement. And they'll improve; nobody can say that
any of them have reached their peak—not by a long shot. The first five
won't get any taller, which is not the insuperable handicap that some seem
to think. In the first Cal game. Davidson made a monkey out of Hanger
under the boards, and the others are somewhat adept at ball hawking in
a like manner.
Two of the men on the team have been singled out by the rank and
file as being standouts —center Bill Stephenson and Captain Dave David
son. who is listed at guard and plays forward. Stephenson is a terror in
the slot, particularly with his pivot overhead bank shot. It works only
when he is close enough to the basket—about five feet away. Beyond
that his effectiveness at shooting decreases rapidly, due to faulty eye
sight.
However, there is hope for the lanky Texican. Bill Drehobl, a sub for
ward, is likewise troubled by bad eyes, but has improved rapidly in
shooting since acquiring contact lenses. When Stephenson gets his—and
gets used to them—there should be no stopping him from anywhere near
the keyhole. But his awkwardness is still a big handicap he must over
come before he becomes the fine player an S.F. sportswriter said he had
the makings jof.
Davidson is a little smoother and a lot springier and is probably the
slickest court man on the team. The big chunky captain, however, is too
prone to fouls, whether intentional or not; they almost counterbalance
his adeptness with the high lob from the corners or any place 30 feet
out. He too has enormous possibilities for improvement—and it the
present crop of cagcrs is to bring any titles back to the Farm, these must
be realized.
Dick Berlin's a (larhon Copy, King Size
The other guard spot is held down by Dick Berlin, a physical carbon,
even to shooting style, of Davidson. Berlin is slower than the rest ot the
varsity, and except for squirrel-caging, blocks and double screens figures
little in the playmaking under the boards. The big thing here is his de
fensive ability, particularly in the corners and along the sidelines; and
here he is unsurpassed by this squad. A little more speed, a little more
grace, etc., etc.
At the forwards are Morley Thompson and Babe Higgins, the converted
footballer. Thompson is a good playmaker and should be the one man on
the team to display grace in the future. When that time comes, all Ste
phenson will have to do is Iced him from the slot on the post plays. A
combination like that this year, and the team would have led everybody
they have played from wire to wire. Thompson is an easygoing lad who
occasionally erupts with a rash of two-pointers with a beautiful jump
and push and a flat trajectory shot that's as good as anything Cal's Andy
Wolfe can do.
Iliggins is the lad who made all-Coast while in the V-12 at Cal in 44.
Probably the best of the long long-shots, he has speed, finesse and a lot
of savvy, and he's almost as indefatigable as Wolfe is. But he's weak
under the boards and almost ineffectual on plays within the horn. Al
though he's listed at forward, he actually takes over Davidson's back
court duties, leaving Dave, Stephenson, and Thompson in the forecourt.
On defense, he's right behind Berlin in effectiveness and particularly
good at stealing the ball and otherwise rattling the offense.
That's the first five, and that's how they look (to me) at the halfway
mark. Maybe you don't think as I do, but if this squad's to salvage any
thing from the season, some of those improvements mentioned had better
start showing up.
What's the Heel? Public Prints Ain't

With all due deference to their partisans, and they are many, it be
hooves us to change a nickel into pennies and contribute two cents (40 per
cent of our fortune and liquidated assets) to the argument. The beef has
been registered that the public prints—of which this is one —have not
been entirely sympathetic to the endeavors of our basketball team.
We are not trying to be funny; the argument can lie safelv maintained
that the basketball team has not been too sympathetic recently with the
spectators. Perhaps we are not being stringently fair by referring to the
two games played in the local crackerbox last weekend. However, they
were played—or should it be said, put on?
We can see no purpose in writing ringing letters home to mother ex
tolling the virtues of a team that took 12 minutes before it could score a
field goal. The only reason the score at that stage wasn't 2t5 to 3 instead
of (I to 3 was because the opposition was Fresno State, a team that was
playing its third game in three nights, and definitely not the world's great
est aggregation of hardwood performers.
Stanford won Saturday night because the team they played was dead
tired and not very good to begin with; Friday night they won over the
Olympic Club—a mere shadow of the terrific teams that represented the
Winged '()" in past years—merely because the visitors arc rapidly ap
proaching middle age and hence no match for fresh young teams. Per
haps it was all for the good. A letdown after the tragic Cal series was
imminent, and it was merely by the grace of the schedule that we met
these two conglomerations of left-footed individuals—instead of a couple
of outfits that would have taken the squad apart, literally.

some of the grace to them that marked his pre-war teams. There's room
for that much improvement. And they'll improve; nobody can say that
any of them have reached their peak—not by a long shot. The first five
won't get any taller, which is not the insuperable handicap that some seem
to think. In the first Cal game. Davidson made a monkey out of Hanger
under the boards, and the others are somewhat adept at ball hawking in
a like manner.
Two of the men on the team have been singled out by the rank and
file as being standouts —center Bill Stephenson and Captain Dave David
son. who is listed at guard and plays forward. Stephenson is a terror in
the slot, particularly with his pivot overhead bank shot. It works only
when he is close enough to the basket—about five feet away. Beyond
that his effectiveness at shooting decreases rapidly, due to faulty eye
sight.
However, there is hope for the lanky Texican. Bill Drehobl, a sub for
ward, is likewise troubled by bad eyes, but has improved rapidly in
shooting since acquiring contact lenses. When Stephenson gets his—and
gets used to them—there should be no stopping him from anywhere near
the keyhole. But his awkwardness is still a big handicap he must over
come before he becomes the fine player an S.F. sportswriter said he had
the makings jof.
Davidson is a little smoother and a lot springier and is probably the
slickest court man on the team. The big chunky captain, however, is too
prone to fouls, whether intentional or not; they almost counterbalance
his adeptness with the high lob from the corners or any place 30 feet
out. He too has enormous possibilities for improvement—and it the
present crop of cagcrs is to bring any titles back to the Farm, these must
be realized.
Dick Berlin's a (larhon Copy, King Size
The other guard spot is held down by Dick Berlin, a physical carbon,
even to shooting style, of Davidson. Berlin is slower than the rest ot the
varsity, and except for squirrel-caging, blocks and double screens figures
little in the playmaking under the boards. The big thing here is his de
fensive ability, particularly in the corners and along the sidelines; and
here he is unsurpassed by this squad. A little more speed, a little more
grace, etc., etc.
At the forwards are Morley Thompson and Babe Higgins, the converted
footballer. Thompson is a good playmaker and should be the one man on
the team to display grace in the future. When that time comes, all Ste
phenson will have to do is Iced him from the slot on the post plays. A
combination like that this year, and the team would have led everybody
they have played from wire to wire. Thompson is an easygoing lad who
occasionally erupts with a rash of two-pointers with a beautiful jump
and push and a flat trajectory shot that's as good as anything Cal's Andy
Wolfe can do.
Iliggins is the lad who made all-Coast while in the V-12 at Cal in 44.
Probably the best of the long long-shots, he has speed, finesse and a lot
of savvy, and he's almost as indefatigable as Wolfe is. But he's weak
under the boards and almost ineffectual on plays within the horn. Al
though he's listed at forward, he actually takes over Davidson's back
court duties, leaving Dave, Stephenson, and Thompson in the forecourt.
On defense, he's right behind Berlin in effectiveness and particularly
good at stealing the ball and otherwise rattling the offense.
That's the first five, and that's how they look (to me) at the halfway
mark. Maybe you don't think as I do, but if this squad's to salvage any
thing from the season, some of those improvements mentioned had better
start showing up.
What's the Heel? Public Prints Ain't
Sympathetic to Farm Basketball learn
With all due deference to their partisans, and they are many, it be
hooves us to change a nickel into pennies and contribute two cents (40 per
cent of our fortune and liquidated assets) to the argument. The beef has
been registered that the public prints—of which this is one —have not
been entirely sympathetic to the endeavors of our basketball team.
We are not trying to be funny; the argument can lie safelv maintained
that the basketball team has not been too sympathetic recently with the
spectators. Perhaps we are not being stringently fair by referring to the
two games played in the local crackerbox last weekend. However, they
were played—or should it be said, put on?
We can see no purpose in writing ringing letters home to mother ex
tolling the virtues of a team that took 12 minutes before it could score a
field goal. The only reason the score at that stage wasn't 2t5 to 3 instead
of (I to 3 was because the opposition was Fresno State, a team that was
playing its third game in three nights, and definitely not the world's great
est aggregation of hardwood performers.
Stanford won Saturday night because the team they played was dead
tired and not very good to begin with; Friday night they won over the
Olympic Club—a mere shadow of the terrific teams that represented the
Winged '()" in past years—merely because the visitors arc rapidly ap
proaching middle age and hence no match for fresh young teams. Per
haps it was all for the good. A letdown after the tragic Cal series was
imminent, and it was merely by the grace of the schedule that we met
these two conglomerations of left-footed individuals—instead of a couple
of outfits that would have taken the squad apart, literally.
Santa (llara Broncos Would ve Hacked Us
llad the schedule for last week and this weekend been reversed, U.S.F.
and Santa Clara would have made us look like we were playing with last
year's squad. As it is, unless the letdown is over and the bad games are
out of the team's system, the aforetlireatened occurences will happen. And
no ifs. U.S.F. and Santa Clara both hold decisions over Cal, and whether
or no they caught the Bear on his off night makes little difference in cold
unemotional figures (in agate type).
The brutal facts, no matter how much you varnish 'em, are still
brutal. The team has been beaten fairly consistently up to now, and will
be beaten again, but not as consistently, I hope. And the reason they
have been consistently beaten is that they have not played consistently
well. Whether they can or not is up to them. They have, and this has
been admitted to me personally by ultra-rabid partisans of Cal s Nibs
Price, the best coach in the league. Year in and year out. Everett Dean
turns out the prettiest plays seen on the courts this side of the Continen
tal Divide.
When it works, it's as impressive a sight as a home run. Mostly, how
ever, it doesn't work; it still looks good, but it cloesn t work. Why.' Prob
ably the bes't answer is an indirect one like this: at the first Cal game (at
Berkeley) a City sportswriter said the Indians were big enough to take
care of themselves, but that they weren't very graceful. It takes a lot of
grace to work precision stuff, like Dean coaches, and the guys just don t
have it. They're big, they're rough, they re tough, but you can t con
ceivably say any of them are exactly cat-footed.
So what? So they bull their way through, or shoot from far out. The
power stuff has the added detriment of provoking whistle blowing. The
shooting from far out means that unless the ball is dead in the net its not
going in; the rim shots invariably spin back out.

varsity, and except for squirrel-caging, blocks and double screens figures
little in the playmaking under the boards. The big thing here is his de
fensive ability, particularly in the corners and along the sidelines; and
here he is unsurpassed by this squad. A little more speed, a little more
grace, etc., etc.
At the forwards are Morley Thompson and Babe Higgins, the converted
footballer. Thompson is a good playmaker and should be the one man on
the team to display grace in the future. When that time comes, all Ste
phenson will have to do is Iced him from the slot on the post plays. A
combination like that this year, and the team would have led everybody
they have played from wire to wire. Thompson is an easygoing lad who
occasionally erupts with a rash of two-pointers with a beautiful jump
and push and a flat trajectory shot that's as good as anything Cal's Andy
Wolfe can do.
Iliggins is the lad who made all-Coast while in the V-12 at Cal in 44.
Probably the best of the long long-shots, he has speed, finesse and a lot
of savvy, and he's almost as indefatigable as Wolfe is. But he's weak
under the boards and almost ineffectual on plays within the horn. Al
though he's listed at forward, he actually takes over Davidson's back
court duties, leaving Dave, Stephenson, and Thompson in the forecourt.
On defense, he's right behind Berlin in effectiveness and particularly
good at stealing the ball and otherwise rattling the offense.
That's the first five, and that's how they look (to me) at the halfway
mark. Maybe you don't think as I do, but if this squad's to salvage any
thing from the season, some of those improvements mentioned had better
start showing up.
What's the Heel? Public Prints Ain't
Sympathetic to Farm Basketball learn
With all due deference to their partisans, and they are many, it be
hooves us to change a nickel into pennies and contribute two cents (40 per
cent of our fortune and liquidated assets) to the argument. The beef has
been registered that the public prints—of which this is one —have not
been entirely sympathetic to the endeavors of our basketball team.
We are not trying to be funny; the argument can lie safelv maintained
that the basketball team has not been too sympathetic recently with the
spectators. Perhaps we are not being stringently fair by referring to the
two games played in the local crackerbox last weekend. However, they
were played—or should it be said, put on?
We can see no purpose in writing ringing letters home to mother ex
tolling the virtues of a team that took 12 minutes before it could score a
field goal. The only reason the score at that stage wasn't 2t5 to 3 instead
of (I to 3 was because the opposition was Fresno State, a team that was
playing its third game in three nights, and definitely not the world's great
est aggregation of hardwood performers.
Stanford won Saturday night because the team they played was dead
tired and not very good to begin with; Friday night they won over the
Olympic Club—a mere shadow of the terrific teams that represented the
Winged '()" in past years—merely because the visitors arc rapidly ap
proaching middle age and hence no match for fresh young teams. Per
haps it was all for the good. A letdown after the tragic Cal series was
imminent, and it was merely by the grace of the schedule that we met
these two conglomerations of left-footed individuals—instead of a couple
of outfits that would have taken the squad apart, literally.
Santa (llara Broncos Would ve Hacked Us
llad the schedule for last week and this weekend been reversed, U.S.F.
and Santa Clara would have made us look like we were playing with last
year's squad. As it is, unless the letdown is over and the bad games are
out of the team's system, the aforetlireatened occurences will happen. And
no ifs. U.S.F. and Santa Clara both hold decisions over Cal, and whether
or no they caught the Bear on his off night makes little difference in cold
unemotional figures (in agate type).
The brutal facts, no matter how much you varnish 'em, are still
brutal. The team has been beaten fairly consistently up to now, and will
be beaten again, but not as consistently, I hope. And the reason they
have been consistently beaten is that they have not played consistently
well. Whether they can or not is up to them. They have, and this has
been admitted to me personally by ultra-rabid partisans of Cal s Nibs
Price, the best coach in the league. Year in and year out. Everett Dean
turns out the prettiest plays seen on the courts this side of the Continen
tal Divide.
When it works, it's as impressive a sight as a home run. Mostly, how
ever, it doesn't work; it still looks good, but it cloesn t work. Why.' Prob
ably the bes't answer is an indirect one like this: at the first Cal game (at
Berkeley) a City sportswriter said the Indians were big enough to take
care of themselves, but that they weren't very graceful. It takes a lot of
grace to work precision stuff, like Dean coaches, and the guys just don t
have it. They're big, they're rough, they re tough, but you can t con
ceivably say any of them are exactly cat-footed.
So what? So they bull their way through, or shoot from far out. The
power stuff has the added detriment of provoking whistle blowing. The
shooting from far out means that unless the ball is dead in the net its not
going in; the rim shots invariably spin back out.
They'll Be Better Next Year, He Says
One affirmative fact in their favor is that they 11 all be back next year,
and most of them for another year after that. Maybe Dean can impart
some of the grace to them that marked his pre-war teams. There's room
for that much improvement. And they'll improve; nobody can say that
any of them have reached their peak—not by a long shot. The first five
won't get any taller, which is not the insuperable handicap that some seem
to think. In the first Cal game. Davidson made a monkey out of Hanger
under the boards, and the others are somewhat adept at ball hawking in
a like manner.
Two of the men on the team have been singled out by the rank and
file as being standouts —center Bill Stephenson and Captain Dave David
son. who is listed at guard and plays forward. Stephenson is a terror in
the slot, particularly with his pivot overhead bank shot. It works only
when he is close enough to the basket—about five feet away. Beyond
that his effectiveness at shooting decreases rapidly, due to faulty eye
sight.
However, there is hope for the lanky Texican. Bill Drehobl, a sub for
ward, is likewise troubled by bad eyes, but has improved rapidly in
shooting since acquiring contact lenses. When Stephenson gets his—and
gets used to them—there should be no stopping him from anywhere near
the keyhole. But his awkwardness is still a big handicap he must over
come before he becomes the fine player an S.F. sportswriter said he had
the makings jof.
Davidson is a little smoother and a lot springier and is probably the
slickest court man on the team. The big chunky captain, however, is too
prone to fouls, whether intentional or not; they almost counterbalance
his adeptness with the high lob from the corners or any place 30 feet
out. He too has enormous possibilities for improvement—and it the
present crop of cagcrs is to bring any titles back to the Farm, these must
be realized.
