# Stanford Basketballers Have Extra
## Cards Off Came, Scared By Fresno State, Olympic Club 
### ART SHAPIRO 
The Stanford quintet which humbled the Uclans two weeks
ago, and held the league-leading California Bears to a one-point
victory a week ago last Friday, jpst managed to eke through two
victories against obviously inferior squads Friday and Saturday
evenings. The performances against the Olympic Club and
Fresno State demonstrated some very obvious faults which will
have to be corrected if the coming week-end's contests with
USF and Santa Clara are to be anything other than fiascos.
NINE MINUTES TO SCORE ♦

It took some nine minutes for the ,
Indians to draw blood from Fresno j
on Saturday p.m., and another three
minutes for a field goal to be regis- j
tered: The shooting eyes of the boys
must have been cheeked at the door, j
and the finesse needed to assure j
capable ball-handling just never did j
appear.
The Bulldogs of Fresno State j
threw a beautiful sliding zone de- I
fense against the Cardinals and had
them stumped for at least three
quarters of the game. Interspersing
a modified fast break with a terrifi- j
cally slow method of advance, the
Staters made a superior Stanford
varsity look rather inept. The Cards \
managed to go into the lead at half
time, 18-15. but that lead was sur
rendered early in the second half,
and it took two beautiful plays by
Stephenson and Davidson to send
the Indians ahead, 27-25, with but
twelve minutes of play remaining in
the contest. From that point on it
was all Stanford and the final con
clusion was never in doubt. The fi
nal score of 44-34 does not indicate
the closeness of the fray, or the ac
tual story of the game.
DAVIDSON STARS
Davidson, moved up from a
guard position to a forward slot,
was easily the star of both the
Fresno and Olympic Club games.
Sparking the club with his tricky
ball-handling and excellent shoot
ing. Dave kept the Stanford five in
both contests until the rest of the
squad began to hit the netting.
Accounting for l(i points against
the Olympics and 1!) in the Fresno
to-do. Davidson completely domi
nated the play and took away all
the honors. Thompson, holding
down the other forward position,
marked up 11 and 14 counters in
the two night's action and was an
easy choice for second honors.
Stephenson, star of the first Cal
encounter, flashed Some of his bril
liance during the Fresno game, but
was far off his usual dependable
form. The remainder of the team
got rid of their poor games over the
week-end.

must have been cheeked at the door, j
and the finesse needed to assure j
capable ball-handling just never did j
appear.
The Bulldogs of Fresno State j
threw a beautiful sliding zone de- I
fense against the Cardinals and had
them stumped for at least three
quarters of the game. Interspersing
a modified fast break with a terrifi- j
cally slow method of advance, the
Staters made a superior Stanford
varsity look rather inept. The Cards \
managed to go into the lead at half
time, 18-15. but that lead was sur
rendered early in the second half,
and it took two beautiful plays by
Stephenson and Davidson to send
the Indians ahead, 27-25, with but
twelve minutes of play remaining in
the contest. From that point on it
was all Stanford and the final con
clusion was never in doubt. The fi
nal score of 44-34 does not indicate
the closeness of the fray, or the ac
tual story of the game.
DAVIDSON STARS
Davidson, moved up from a
guard position to a forward slot,
was easily the star of both the
Fresno and Olympic Club games.
Sparking the club with his tricky
ball-handling and excellent shoot
ing. Dave kept the Stanford five in
both contests until the rest of the
squad began to hit the netting.
Accounting for l(i points against
the Olympics and 1!) in the Fresno
to-do. Davidson completely domi
nated the play and took away all
the honors. Thompson, holding
down the other forward position,
marked up 11 and 14 counters in
the two night's action and was an
easy choice for second honors.
Stephenson, star of the first Cal
encounter, flashed Some of his bril
liance during the Fresno game, but
was far off his usual dependable
form. The remainder of the team
got rid of their poor games over the
week-end.
The Stanford quintet which humbled the Uclans two weeks
ago, and held the league-leading California Bears to a one-point
victory a week ago last Friday, jpst managed to eke through two
victories against obviously inferior squads Friday and Saturday
evenings. The performances against the Olympic Club and
Fresno State demonstrated some very obvious faults which will
have to be corrected if the coming week-end's contests with
USF and Santa Clara are to be anything other than fiascos.
NINE MINUTES TO SCORE ♦

It took some nine minutes for the ,
Indians to draw blood from Fresno j
on Saturday p.m., and another three
minutes for a field goal to be regis- j
tered: The shooting eyes of the boys
must have been cheeked at the door, j
and the finesse needed to assure j
capable ball-handling just never did j
appear.
