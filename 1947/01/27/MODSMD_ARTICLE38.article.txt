# Reds Drop Rugby Tilt
## 
### 
Stanford's rugby team lost to |
Santa Rosa Junior College, 14 to 3,
Friday afternoon in t a hard fought
practice contest which saw numer
ous players from both teams leave
the game because of injuries.
Held to three points most of the
game by the determined play of the
Reds, the Santa Rosans, led by Al
Pisenti who garnered eight points,
broke through the locals' defenses
to score 11 points in the last 15 min
utes of play.
CAItDS SCORE FIRST
During the first half, the visitors
were outplayed by Stanford, whose
scrum dominated the play and kepi
Santa Rosa constantly on the defen
sive. The first score was set up by
Mark Caffall's broken-field run and
scored by Bert Avery who fell on
the ball across the goal.
The running and kicking of Bob
Brodie and the aggressive play of
Athcrton, Avery, and others in the
scrum kept Santa Rosa bottled up
until the last minutes of the first
half when wing forward Pisenti
scored three points by a penalty
kick from 25 yards out.
Midway through the second half,
Pisenti scored a try to put Santa
Rosa ahead, 6 to 3. Charlie Ziehn,
Santa Rosa first-five, broke through
the Stanford team on a long run to
j score again for the Cubs. The con
version, good for two points, was
made by the versatile Mr. Pisenti.
Shortly afterward Pisenti was kick
ed in the head and left the game.
GAME WAS CLOSE
Santa Rosa's last score came in
the final moments of play when
McCarty scored a try to make it
14 to 3.
The game was much closer than
| the score indicated and Stanford's
mistakes were due mostly to inex
perience and not to lack of ability.
As soon as the team, many of whom
are playing rugby for the first time,
acquires a more thorough under
standing of the rules and strategy of
the game, their play will improve
greatly. Also, Coaches Clauson and
\ Wylie substituted freely and Santa
Rosa's second half scores were made
when Stanford was not at full
strength.
Next Saturday, Feb. 1, Stanford
i plays their first league game when
; they meet the Petaluma American
; Legion team here.
