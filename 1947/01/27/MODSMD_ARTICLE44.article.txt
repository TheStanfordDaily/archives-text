ATLANTA, Ga., Jan. 2(3 (UP).â€”
The Georgia Legislature, fresh from
a weekend recess, came back to
night for an almost certain show

claims of Herman Talmadge and M.
E. Thompson for the governorship.
The affairs of the state have
reached such a precarious point, and
public feeling has become so
aroused, that something almost has

the political stalemate.
