# Students Vie In Mock Trials
## 
### 
Russell Hofvendahl and Ward
Saunders will meet Kenneth Ey
mann and Bert Lunceford in the
current preliminary moot court se
ries to argue the case of I. M. True
v. Bulbous Tire Co. and John Jones
this afternoon at 4:10 in room 100.
The court for this case will be
Marshall C. Hall, president of the
Santa Clara County Bar Association,
and Frank Mallory and Robert Max
well, third-year law students.
I. M. True, plaintiff-appellant, re
tired after 25 years with the defend
ant company. The company had
promised him a pension as long as
he was not employed by a competi
tor, and paid the pension for three
years. Then Jones, an enemy of
True, persuaded the company to stop
the payments, and True sued both
of them, the company for breach of
contract and Jones for inducing the
breach. The lower court held for the
defendants.
