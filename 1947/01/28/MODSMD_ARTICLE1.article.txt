## 
### 
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., J,-in. 27 (UP). —Eleven Army men were killed
today when a B-29 bomber crashed and burned shortly after taking oft
from Kirtland Field here.
One of the 12 persons aboard the four-motored plane survived the
crash,, but was in serious condition at Albuquerque Veterans' Hospital.

Two men were pulled from the 4
burning wreckage by rescuers who
fought the flames more than an t
hour after the crash. One of the i
men died a few minutes after reach- j
ing the hospital.
CRASHED IN RAVINE
The pkine, carrying two officers
and 10 enlisted men, crashed in a
ravine one-half mile from the air- j
port. It was reported that one of
the left engines of the ship was j
causing trouble at the take-oIT.
Witnesses said the sky giant i
cleared the ground, made a turn
toward the left and fell to earth.

OAKLAND, Jan. 27 (UP).—A
huge four - engined transoccan !
airliner landed safely at (he Oak- |
land Municipal Airport late today i
after flying the last 650 miles from
Manila with one engine dead.
The plane, a I)C-4 inbound j
from Honolulu with 10 passengers
and seven crew members aboard,
radioed a trouble call at 11:15
a.m., stating its number three en- j
gine was dead and number four j
engine "running rough."
An Army and a Coast Guard |
H-17 were dispatched to escort j
the plane in and joined the air- j
liner more than 200 miles at sea. |
The plane landed without mis- }
hap at ;{:5() p.m.

CRASHES SIMILAR
The deaths raised to 89 the total
number of persons killed or miss
ing in major plane crashes on three
continents. Seventy - nine other
persons were aboad plants that
crashed or were missing near
Shanghai; Hong Kong; London;
Copenhagen; Bogota, Colombia, and
Rensselaer, Incl.
Today's B-29 crash and two of
the other disasters were strikingly
similar in that the planes had just
taken off and, apparently because of
motor failure, plunged to earth in
sight of the airfield. That was the
case in the crash of the airliner at
London's Croydon Airport which
cost 12 lives, and in the crash of
the KLM plane yesterday at Co
penhagen in which 22 persons, in
cluding singer Grace Moore and
Sweden's Prince Gustaf Adolf, lost
their lives.

CRASHES SIMILAR
The deaths raised to 89 the total
number of persons killed or miss
ing in major plane crashes on three
continents. Seventy - nine other
persons were aboad plants that
crashed or were missing near
Shanghai; Hong Kong; London;
Copenhagen; Bogota, Colombia, and
Rensselaer, Incl.
Today's B-29 crash and two of
the other disasters were strikingly
similar in that the planes had just
taken off and, apparently because of
motor failure, plunged to earth in
sight of the airfield. That was the
case in the crash of the airliner at
London's Croydon Airport which
cost 12 lives, and in the crash of
the KLM plane yesterday at Co
penhagen in which 22 persons, in
cluding singer Grace Moore and
Sweden's Prince Gustaf Adolf, lost
their lives.
