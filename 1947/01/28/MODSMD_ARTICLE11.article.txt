### BIPAN CHANDRA 
The group of students interested j
in co-ordinating the international |
activities on campus met last night ;
in the Women's Clubhouse. The j
problem before the group was to
recommend to Excom the plan fur
the formation of one organization ;
for conducting all international af- !
fairs activities.
Willi (he help of a blackboard,
Nicl Allen and Don Tibbitts pre
sented their plan for such an or- j
ganization. According to this plan
the bigger organization will con- j
sist of an Advisory Council which
would have under it three campus
organizations: N. 5.0., 1.5.C., and
Institute. The three smaller or
ganizations will be headed by '
secretaries appointed by Excom. j
These secretaries and the heads
of publicity and office management j
committee will comprise the Ad- ,
visory Council.
The student reaction to the plan j
came quickly. While agreeing with j
the objectives and outline of the j
plan, the, students wanted the ap- j
pointmcnt procedure of the secre
taries to be changed.
As one student, put it, they want- j
ed the sub-committee members and j
the secretaries of different organi- |
zations to be elected by /the inter- j
ested students and not appointed, i
Many of the students present ex
pressed themselves strongly on this
point.
A motion that this plan be ac
cepted for this year was voted
down by 2X to 2fi. Another mo
tion., that recommendation be j
made to Excom that this plan be
accepted as a skeleton plan to be j
revised by this body of interested
students, was passed by 45 to 1.
The group decided to hear any i
other plan on this issue and to in- j
corporate its good points in Allen's ;
plan.
Chuck Martin then presented
his plan before the group. I>ue
to lack of time, the group tabled I
all further discussion until the |
next meeting, which will take j
place at the Women's Clubhouse
next Monday-
One delightful feature of the |
meeting was the introduction by J
Miss Pat Davidson of Miss Giovanna |
Ribet, from Rome. Italy. Miss Ribet i
urged the students always to keep j
in view the higher ideals and re
member that they owe something
to the world.
She described the activities of j
students of Rome toward the fur- i
thering of international under- j
standing. "Students in Europe are i
realizing the importance of their j
role in world affairs," she said. "We j
are establishing contact with for- j
eign students through exchange let- j
ters and exchange students."

The group of students interested j
in co-ordinating the international |
activities on campus met last night ;
in the Women's Clubhouse. The j
problem before the group was to
recommend to Excom the plan fur
the formation of one organization ;
for conducting all international af- !
fairs activities.
Willi (he help of a blackboard,
Nicl Allen and Don Tibbitts pre
sented their plan for such an or- j
ganization. According to this plan
the bigger organization will con- j
sist of an Advisory Council which
would have under it three campus
organizations: N. 5.0., 1.5.C., and
Institute. The three smaller or
ganizations will be headed by '
secretaries appointed by Excom. j
These secretaries and the heads
of publicity and office management j
committee will comprise the Ad- ,
visory Council.
The student reaction to the plan j
came quickly. While agreeing with j
the objectives and outline of the j
plan, the, students wanted the ap- j
pointmcnt procedure of the secre
taries to be changed.
As one student, put it, they want- j
ed the sub-committee members and j
the secretaries of different organi- |
zations to be elected by /the inter- j
ested students and not appointed, i
Many of the students present ex
pressed themselves strongly on this
point.
A motion that this plan be ac
cepted for this year was voted
down by 2X to 2fi. Another mo
tion., that recommendation be j
made to Excom that this plan be
accepted as a skeleton plan to be j
revised by this body of interested
students, was passed by 45 to 1.
The group decided to hear any i
other plan on this issue and to in- j
corporate its good points in Allen's ;
plan.
Chuck Martin then presented
his plan before the group. I>ue
to lack of time, the group tabled I
all further discussion until the |
next meeting, which will take j
place at the Women's Clubhouse
next Monday-
One delightful feature of the |
meeting was the introduction by J
Miss Pat Davidson of Miss Giovanna |
Ribet, from Rome. Italy. Miss Ribet i
urged the students always to keep j
in view the higher ideals and re
member that they owe something
to the world.
She described the activities of j
students of Rome toward the fur- i
thering of international under- j
standing. "Students in Europe are i
realizing the importance of their j
role in world affairs," she said. "We j
are establishing contact with for- j
eign students through exchange let- j
ters and exchange students."
