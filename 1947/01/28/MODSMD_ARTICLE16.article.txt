### 
TOKYO, Tuesday, Jan. 28 (UP).â€”
It. was predicted by some well-in
formed sources today that the con
servative cabinet of Premier Shi
geru Yoshida would resign after a
meeting scheduled for 2 p.m. It was
believed Emperor Hirohito would
order Yoshida to form a new coa
lition government giving represen
tation to the Social Democratic
party.
Word of the cabinet's impending
resignation came as nearly 100.000
labor union members demonstrated
in the plaza of the imperial palace
shouting "Down with the Yoshida
cabinet!"
At the same time the central la
bor relations adjustment committee
was attempting to settle a threat
ened general strike scheduled for
Feb. 1 by 2,500,000 government and
utility workers.
Observers predicted the strike
would be averted through compro
mise, and it was generally believed
that union leaders would call off
the strike in the event the Yoshida
cabinet resigns.
