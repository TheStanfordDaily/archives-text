# Herman Talmadge Pulls Fast One on Thompson
## 
### 
ATLANTA, Ga., Jan. 27 (UP).—
Herman Talmadgc's forces went, to
the courts in the governorship wran
gle today by filing a suit to force
state treasurer George Hamilton to
accept $4,000,000 in revenue collec
tions.
Charles Redwine, Talmadgc's rev
enue commissioner, filed a manda
mus action in Fulton County (At
lanta) Superior Court.. Judge Bond
Almand accepted jurisdiction and
set a hearing for Feb. (5.
Hamilton refused to recognize
either Talmadgc's or M. E. Thomp
son's appointees in the revenue post
pending a legal opinion on who i.s
the qualified governor of Georgia.
Red wine's suit thus provided a test
case on the governorship question.
The suit will be heard one day be
fore Thompson's suit to oust Tal
madge on the grounds that the leg
islature illegally elected him gover
nor.
Tlie suit was the first positive step
by either side to break the financial
logjam that has threatened to leave
some state departments running dry
by the end of this week.
Pcdwine said that $4,000,000 in

collections had piled up in his office
and the money could be released
immediately to dwindling depart
mental coffers once Hamilton ac
cepted it for deposit.
The Talmadge camp went to court
as the legislature swung back in the
Talmadge groove, confirming 18 of
his statchouse appointments and
voting to stay in session until it
passes a bill making the democratic
primary an exclusive party property.
Heedless of dissenters within its
ranks and a nearby mass meeting
by the "aroused citizens of Georgia,"
the legislature then began immediate
consideration of the primary bill,
which would bar Negroes from vot
ing and is Talmadgc's No. 1 measure.
