# RUSSIAN ATOM BOMB?
## Sen. McMahon Says USSR Building Secret Atom Plant 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 (UP).—Sen. Brien McMahon (D-Conn)
raised the curtain on the first full-dress congressional review of
atomic policy today with the charge that Russia probably is
building a secret atomic bomb plant somewhere in Siberia.
In a speech bristling with suspicion of Russian aims and
activities in the atomic field, he warned the Senate that only the
swift development of international safeguards can head off
an atomic war.

He urged that international con
trol of the dreaded A-bomb be taken
out of the hands of the United Na
tions Security Council and written
into a global treaty which could be
enforced promptly and forcefully
without veto by any of the major
powers.
REBUKES SOVIETS
McMahon rebuked the Soviets for
their stand on that issue and for
their insistence on giving priority t <
general disarmament.
"Shall we discuss disarmament?"
he asked. '"By all means let us div
cuss it. But let us, under no circum
stances, actually disarm before an
international atomic control and in
spection system has been in opera
tion long enough to convince us of
its effectiveness."
DEEPLY DISTURBED
McMahon, former chairman of thr
joint atomic committee, said he was
"deeply disturbed" by Russia's ma
neuver ings on the atomic question
and he warned that the delay is
working against the United States.
"The clock ticks on," he said, "and
with every tick we are losing part
of our capital of monopoly (on
atomic secrets)."
He said other nations are "work
ing day and night" to unlock the
secret of the atomic bomb and he
dismissed as "illusory and fleeting"
the hope that this country could re
tain sole control of the bomb indcii
nitely.
DROPS CIIAROE
Then he dropped his implied
charge against the Russians*. He
cited recent Soviet news reports that
Peter Kapitza, Russia's number one
nuclear scientist, hus been banished
to Siberia for sornu offense against
the state.
"It seems obvious to me," he said,
"that a more likely explanation is
that Kapitza is now busily at work
behind the Urals constructing an
atomic fission plant."
fie acknowledged that he could
not prove his accusation because of
the wall of secrecy surrounding
atomic developments in all coun
tries.
But ho asserted that even the sus
picion of a secret atomic bomb pro
ject in Russia makes imperative the
immediate creation of a worldwide
control system.

In a speech bristling with suspicion of Russian aims and
activities in the atomic field, he warned the Senate that only the
swift development of international safeguards can head off
an atomic war.

He urged that international con
trol of the dreaded A-bomb be taken
out of the hands of the United Na
tions Security Council and written
into a global treaty which could be
enforced promptly and forcefully
without veto by any of the major
powers.
REBUKES SOVIETS
McMahon rebuked the Soviets for
their stand on that issue and for
their insistence on giving priority t <
general disarmament.
"Shall we discuss disarmament?"
he asked. '"By all means let us div
cuss it. But let us, under no circum
stances, actually disarm before an
international atomic control and in
spection system has been in opera
tion long enough to convince us of
its effectiveness."
DEEPLY DISTURBED
McMahon, former chairman of thr
joint atomic committee, said he was
"deeply disturbed" by Russia's ma
neuver ings on the atomic question
and he warned that the delay is
working against the United States.
"The clock ticks on," he said, "and
with every tick we are losing part
of our capital of monopoly (on
atomic secrets)."
He said other nations are "work
ing day and night" to unlock the
secret of the atomic bomb and he
dismissed as "illusory and fleeting"
the hope that this country could re
tain sole control of the bomb indcii
nitely.
DROPS CIIAROE
Then he dropped his implied
charge against the Russians*. He
cited recent Soviet news reports that
Peter Kapitza, Russia's number one
nuclear scientist, hus been banished
to Siberia for sornu offense against
the state.
"It seems obvious to me," he said,
"that a more likely explanation is
that Kapitza is now busily at work
behind the Urals constructing an
atomic fission plant."
fie acknowledged that he could
not prove his accusation because of
the wall of secrecy surrounding
atomic developments in all coun
tries.
But ho asserted that even the sus
picion of a secret atomic bomb pro
ject in Russia makes imperative the
immediate creation of a worldwide
control system.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 (UP).—Sen. Brien McMahon (D-Conn)
raised the curtain on the first full-dress congressional review of
atomic policy today with the charge that Russia probably is
building a secret atomic bomb plant somewhere in Siberia.
In a speech bristling with suspicion of Russian aims and
activities in the atomic field, he warned the Senate that only the
swift development of international safeguards can head off
an atomic war.

He urged that international con
