## Give It Some More Thought 
### 
Two points were made in yesterday's edi
torial entitled "Give It Some Thought." One:
in order to accommodate the large amount of
business shoved onto Excom's back, sub-com
mittees must be set up to investigate and or
ganize for presentation matters on the agenda.
Two: the usual crowded agendas have en
couraged Excom merely to pass whatever
propositions are made by outside groups—
without distinguishing the important from the
unimportant, giving no direction to the mass
of student energy. We thought it imperative
lLit Excom pause a while to analyze the basic
cm uses of "student apathy" and governmental
I tilures, and thereafter to initiate remedial
measures.
Excom could easily continue to plod along
vilh the disinterested mob, and yet discharge
Ks duties to the letter. On the other hand,
I /.com could attempt to move one step ahead,
by anticipating the studenls needs and g/ipes
j id lack of interest
Until the order of business is made more
o;ficient (Excom has traditionally degenerated
into a Wednesday night bull session) Excom
members will be unable to attain perspective
on its actions. So, although specific sugges
lions are premature, we feel at least three
committees could be appended to the present
legal committee: a social activities committee

to review forthcoming business in this cate
gory; an organizations and sports committee,
lor such groups operating under A.S.S.U.
sponsorship; and a drives and program com
mittee, for such appointed groups as Honor
Code and Election Board.
With work in sub-committees, Excom mem
bers will become pseudo-experts in certain
branches of student government, and will be
able to discuss and evaluate the problems
confronting them more intelligently. They
may be able to select some enterprises to aid
and emphasize: their 1.5.C.-N.S.O. project has
been a subject of apparent disinterest on the
part of the large majority of Excom's members.
If Excom is, as suggested, going to question
where it's going and what to do about it, it
will be necessary first to define the areas of
its jurisdiction. Too often Excom is hammered
to do things it cannot do; likewise, things
which need to be done are neglected because
the students do not know they have authority
to act.
And once the areas of student government
are defined, once the projects at hand are
distinguished, the realizations gained should
be passed on to every student—from the S.F.-
commuters to the Roble residents. Unless stu
dent government knows what it is doing, it's
a cinch that the student body will never be
sold on any of its undertakings.

j id lack of interest
Until the order of business is made more
o;ficient (Excom has traditionally degenerated
into a Wednesday night bull session) Excom
members will be unable to attain perspective
on its actions. So, although specific sugges
lions are premature, we feel at least three
committees could be appended to the present
legal committee: a social activities committee

to review forthcoming business in this cate
gory; an organizations and sports committee,
lor such groups operating under A.S.S.U.
sponsorship; and a drives and program com
mittee, for such appointed groups as Honor
Code and Election Board.
With work in sub-committees, Excom mem
bers will become pseudo-experts in certain
branches of student government, and will be
able to discuss and evaluate the problems
confronting them more intelligently. They
may be able to select some enterprises to aid
and emphasize: their 1.5.C.-N.S.O. project has
been a subject of apparent disinterest on the
part of the large majority of Excom's members.
If Excom is, as suggested, going to question
where it's going and what to do about it, it
will be necessary first to define the areas of
its jurisdiction. Too often Excom is hammered
to do things it cannot do; likewise, things
which need to be done are neglected because
the students do not know they have authority
to act.
And once the areas of student government
are defined, once the projects at hand are
distinguished, the realizations gained should
be passed on to every student—from the S.F.-
commuters to the Roble residents. Unless stu
dent government knows what it is doing, it's
a cinch that the student body will never be
sold on any of its undertakings.
Two points were made in yesterday's edi
torial entitled "Give It Some Thought." One:
in order to accommodate the large amount of
business shoved onto Excom's back, sub-com
mittees must be set up to investigate and or
ganize for presentation matters on the agenda.
Two: the usual crowded agendas have en
couraged Excom merely to pass whatever
propositions are made by outside groups—
without distinguishing the important from the
unimportant, giving no direction to the mass
of student energy. We thought it imperative
lLit Excom pause a while to analyze the basic
cm uses of "student apathy" and governmental
I tilures, and thereafter to initiate remedial
measures.
Excom could easily continue to plod along
vilh the disinterested mob, and yet discharge
Ks duties to the letter. On the other hand,
I /.com could attempt to move one step ahead,
by anticipating the studenls needs and g/ipes
