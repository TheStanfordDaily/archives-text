Fine thing! What do I find stuck in my type
writer but an advertisement for a joke book!
"FUN-MASTER gag files is a necessary reference
when preparing any department in need of humor
. . . valuable for college publications . . . contains
100 sure-fire, sock, audience-proof, and reader-proof
gags, such as stories, comedy poems, introductions,
interruptions, heckler answers, ideas, bits, etc."
These guys aren't a bit bashful. They don't want
you to buy just one book. Or two. They've got about
20 volumes and want you to buy them all. NOBODY
can get along with just one measly little joke book.
(Oh yeah?)
But then, of course, I don't need anything like
joke books.
Of course.

Far be it from m° to tempt listeners away from
KSU. but there are two radio shows on the local
n l works that are well worth tearing yourself away
from the libe to listen to.
One is "Pat Novak for Hire," which is on the
air Sunday nights at K. If you like good mystery
dramas, that alone is enough to recommend this one
to you. If you aren't a mystery fiend, this show is
■ till well worth catching for the fast, colorful script
writing that goes into it. It has an S.F. setting, a
rapid-fire leading character, a philosophical drunk,
and enough blood and sex to keep anybody glued to
the radio for half an hour.
The other show mentioned is that of the well
publicized Henry Morgan, whose panning of radio
advertising and programs still adds up to the fun

niest .'5O minutes available each week. And that
includes Jack Benny, Fred Allen, and the six min
utes a day you waste reading Bull Session five times
a week.

Anyone with any love for B.F. at all will be
tremendously disappointed to hear that Mayor Lap
ham has recommended that the cable ears be done
away with. What will S.F. streets seem like without
the whir of the cables, the cheerful clangs of those
happy bells, and the gripman's shout of "Watchout
furthuhcurve."
If you've ever ridden those picturesque little
mechanized mountain goats with a gay mob of Chi
nese, Italians, Irish, Jews, Filipinos, South Ameri
cans, etc., packing every cranny and hanging all over
the outside, you know what a wonderful example
of international harmony they can be.
And if they disappear, Herb Caen will probably
never speak to the Mayor again.

And speaking of progress, it's highly enlighten
ing to watch college-level students struggle with the
simple now parking meters that have been installed
in Paly. Even a five-year-old is supposed to be
able to operate them, but have you seen a Stanford
student yet that isn't baffled by them?
I put 10 nickels into one yesterday before I found
out it wasn't a slot machine. But just between us,
you can get 3121 by using a slug in the fourth one
down on the left-hand side of University.

The crowning blow to the struggles of a Farm
lass to unlock her stuck car door yesterday was
added by a small five-year-old (obviously the same
one that can work parking meters) who waddled by,
eyed her efforts, and then trebled loudly:
"Open the door, Richard!"
