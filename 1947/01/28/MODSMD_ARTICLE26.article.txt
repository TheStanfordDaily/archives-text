# CAMPUS OPINION

To the Editor:
This letter is like so many other "letters to the
editor in that it states a particular dissatisfaction. It
i unlike very many letters in this column in that it
noes on to suggest a solution to the basis of com
plaint. I feel very deeply about what I have to say
and I am interested in learning of your reaction to
my comments. (P.O. Box 2801, Stanford University.)
Many of us are extremely dissatisfied with the
level of attainment of several leading campus activi
lie:;. We I eel that the products of these activities are
•lar inferior to those on other 'campuses and are far
below the quality of which Stanford students are
capable. The activities of which we speak include,
lAit are not limited'to, the Big Game Gaieties, the
football rallies of Rally Com, and the "Chappie." We
have chosen these as examples since most of you
are familiar with all of them.
It is not our purpose merely to repeat the opin
ions of so veiy many of you, that the productions of
these activities have been of very low qualtiy in
the past tow quarters. Neither is it our sole purpose
to call attention to the off-campus derogatory com
ments on Stanford students and their activities which
these productions have caused. (Reference is made
specifically to the Palo Alto Times review of Gaie
ties.) You are familfar with these things. You know
what they are. What we wish to do is to point out
possible causes and remedies.
The average person does little more than what is
required of him. The less required, the less he does.
The converse is also true. Too many of us students
have been apathetic. Either we do not think about
these things as we see them and read them, or else
we do not act after having thought. As a result, these
organizations find that little is required of them and
they act accordingly. Therefore, we are as guilty of
the cause for the existing low level of student pro
ductions as those who more directly bring them
about. They can plead ignorance. We can't. They
claim we applaud anything presented, so they con
clude it is what we want. We, however, can only
admit our guilt of not acting rationally. Of not think
ing critically. Of not discriminating between good
and bad.
Now, what can be done? Surely wo con expect

little improvement until we require real production.
We are the students and these student organizations
can be made to react to our opinions, but first we
must act ourselves. This is not meant to suggest un
thoughtful, half-cocked gripes and criticisms. We
must act by being critical and voicing our criticisms.
We must act by expressing our approval of that
which is good and our disapproval of that which is
not. If we are to be effective, we must do both. Only
an ignorant fool can approve everything offered him
since he cannot distinguish right from wrong. Let's
start thinking for ourselves. We will be forced to,
sometime in our lives.
The value of education does not lie merely in
knowing right from wrong and good from bad, but
its value comes from the use of that knowledge. Let's
make our knowledge valuable by voicing our ap
proval of that which is good and our disapproval of
that which is not. We will then raise these levels
and the new, higher standards will per se invite new
talent and effort into these organizations so that we
will have productions of which Stanford students are
really capable. All concerned will gain.

To the Editor:
I'm a great guy. I'm easy to got along with. I
can go along with a gag. But now I have reached
the end of my patience.
When I returned from Christmas vacation, I found
all my liquor had been removed from my room. I
looked in the sleeping porch and found my pin -ball
machine had been removed. I didn't mind that, but
when I looked under my bed, I found my .45 gone.
I went to take a hot shower and found the hot
water had been exhausted by 10 that night.
And now. the night before on important exnmi
nation, the lights go out in every room in Toyon
Hall.
I don't mind taking a cold shower every night,
but I'll be damned if I'll study by the light of my
Ronson.

a one-armed bandit hidden in the basement.
