### CHUCK MARTIN 
The U.S. policy toward Argen- ■
tina is about to undergo a change.
The line is expected to be one j
of friendly moderation, a definite !
switch from the harsh treatment ac
corded Juan D. Peron 111 the past, j
Is this change justified? What is the !
liberal viewpoint?
The situation is this: the Ar
gentine government is a fascist
military dictatorship which aided
the Axis. If U.N. censure of Axis
Spain is justified, so equally should
be censure of Argentina.
The State Department proved be
yond reasonable doubt (with evi
dence from captured German docu
ments and interrogation of German
officials) that successive Argentine i
regimes tolerated German agents,
the leading figures collaborated with
them, and that the regimes had not
taken effective steps to destroy
German economic power in Argen
tina.
CANNOT BE TRUSTED
President Peron while chief of the !
Secretariat of the War Ministry had j

been the chief
conspirator in an
activated plan
with the Nazi I
government of j
undermining and 1
subverting pro-
Allied govern
ments (Bolivia, I
Brazil, Chile, j
Paraguay, Uru j
gay). From such 1
facts as these I
the U. S. con
cluded that by |
its brutal use of |
force and ter-

roristic methods to strike down all
opposition from the Argentine peo- j
pie the military regime has made a I
mockery of its pledge to the United |
Nations "to reaffirm faith in human j
rights, in the dignity and worth of
the human person," and therefore
that the high officials of Argentina !
were so seriously compromised in i
thoir relations with the enemy that
we could not place trust and con- !
fidence in such a government.
This was the policy of Assistant
Secretary of State Spruille Braden, j
who has now submitted his resig- j
nation. The policy now has been j
reversed in the person of Messer- !
smith, our new ambassador to Ar- j
gentina. It is now felt that we must
deal with Argentina—whether we |
like it or not.
WAGES ECONOMIC WAR
There has been little change in 1
Pcron's friendliness to democracies |
since the end of the war—he is now
waging economic warfare upon his j
neighbors. Paraguay is already j
prostrate from economic domination
by Argentina.
Braden bluntly stated his posi
tion at Buenos Aires: "We would
not be loyal to our country or to
the principles which we profess to
defend if, once we discover certain
activities of this nature, we do not |
report them openly and hasten to
pull them out by the roots. Other
wise, we should have to declare as
morally lost this very war which
we won with so much sacrifice."
U.S. SUPPORTS DEMOCRACY
Braden believes (and lias been
supported by Byrnes and Ache
son) that the policy of the U.S. I

should be one of supporting and
encouraging democracy—that the
long-range security of the U.S.
demands such a policy. It is ar
gued that this is impractical.
But take what happened in Bra
zil. The U.S. heard that Vargas was
planning to set aside the elections
and stay in office. At the crucial
moment Ambassador Berle made a
public speech in which he expressed
the great satisfaction of the U.S.
that the elections were to be held
as scheduled, and his hope that
nothing would be done to delay
them. Vargas was forced, then, by
local factions to resign in order to
assure that free elections would be
held as scheduled. This is a fair ex
ample of the way the new American
policy was designed to operate.
Ls such a policy intervention? The
size and power of the U.S. is over
whelming. In most Latin American
countries the balance of political
forces is so unstable, the role of the
individual so great, that whatever
the U.S. does or fails to do is in
effect intervention. Without willing
it, we are an influence in every
political decision. 11 we decline to
intervene in behalf of forces we
believe in, we automatically inter
vene in behalf of the forces we ab
hor. If the U.S. tries to avoid ex
ercising the responsibilities of its
power it really exercises them in
behalf of the status quo.
NEED ACTION POLICY
The criticism of Braden's policy
has been that it is one of words, not
action, and it should be a policy of
action. Dictators should not be in
vited to the White .House (the cruel
dictator of the Dominican Republic
was as cordially received as the
democratic president of Colombia);
they should be given no military

I decorations, no military equipment
' (the dictatorship of Nicaragua re
ceived lend-lease arms on the same
j scale as democratic Costa Rica), no
I loans, no favors.
What do the democratic Latinos
say? Both the president and foreign
| minister ol Guatemala are among
; the strongest supporters of Mr. Bra-
I den's attempts to secure Argentine
I compliance with inter - American
! commitments. President Arevallo
said Braden's resignation would be
I "a severe blow to democracy in Latin
j America,"and his foreign minister
! thought that "all the American dic-
I tators would rejoice and dictator
ship would spread in the hemi
i sphere." Their comments cast an
j authoritative light on the conse
j quences of abandoning inter-Amer
ican agreements.
U.S. MUST LEAD
At the "Report from the World"
j Conference at Cleveland, spokes
i men for Latin America urged the
1 U.S. to slop forward and assume her
full responsibilities in world affairs.
| Uruguay's Foreign Minister Larreta
j urged that small nations, in the in
| terests of a democratic Pan-Ameri
: can community, abandon their fears
| of U.S. intervention. Said Larreta,
! "The installation of a dictatorship
| perils neighboring states and checks
i the realization of their social aims
| . . . Are we going to build inter-
I national democracy upon national
j dictatorship?"
That is the challenge. The true
liberal will accept it. The U.S.
must accept it and assume demo
cratic leadership. Otherwise the
Good Neighbor policy will con
tinue to be a policy of stabilizing
dictatorships — a policy that will
injure the moral position of the

U.S. without providing strategic !
security.
The U.S. must send high-quality, !
hard - working statesmen to Latin ,
America who realize our responsi- I
bility. The world will not continue |
forever half slave, half free. The j
United States must support the ;
cause of freedom throughout the
world if we are to be truly liberal. I

NEED ACTION POLICY
The criticism of Braden's policy
has been that it is one of words, not
action, and it should be a policy of
action. Dictators should not be in
vited to the White .House (the cruel
dictator of the Dominican Republic
was as cordially received as the
democratic president of Colombia);
they should be given no military

I decorations, no military equipment
' (the dictatorship of Nicaragua re
ceived lend-lease arms on the same
j scale as democratic Costa Rica), no
I loans, no favors.
What do the democratic Latinos
say? Both the president and foreign
| minister ol Guatemala are among
; the strongest supporters of Mr. Bra-
I den's attempts to secure Argentine
I compliance with inter - American
! commitments. President Arevallo
said Braden's resignation would be
I "a severe blow to democracy in Latin
j America,"and his foreign minister
! thought that "all the American dic-
I tators would rejoice and dictator
ship would spread in the hemi
i sphere." Their comments cast an
j authoritative light on the conse
j quences of abandoning inter-Amer
ican agreements.

That is the challenge. The true

cratic leadership. Otherwise the

The U.S. policy toward Argen- ■
tina is about to undergo a change.
The line is expected to be one j
of friendly moderation, a definite !
switch from the harsh treatment ac
corded Juan D. Peron 111 the past, j
Is this change justified? What is the !
liberal viewpoint?
The situation is this: the Ar
gentine government is a fascist
military dictatorship which aided
the Axis. If U.N. censure of Axis
Spain is justified, so equally should
be censure of Argentina.
The State Department proved be
yond reasonable doubt (with evi
dence from captured German docu
ments and interrogation of German
officials) that successive Argentine i
regimes tolerated German agents,
the leading figures collaborated with
them, and that the regimes had not
taken effective steps to destroy
German economic power in Argen
tina.
CANNOT BE TRUSTED
President Peron while chief of the !
Secretariat of the War Ministry had j

been the chief
conspirator in an
activated plan
with the Nazi I
government of j
undermining and 1
subverting pro-
Allied govern
ments (Bolivia, I
Brazil, Chile, j
Paraguay, Uru j
gay). From such 1
facts as these I
the U. S. con
cluded that by |
its brutal use of |
force and ter-

roristic methods to strike down all
opposition from the Argentine peo- j
pie the military regime has made a I
mockery of its pledge to the United |
Nations "to reaffirm faith in human j
rights, in the dignity and worth of
the human person," and therefore
that the high officials of Argentina !
were so seriously compromised in i
thoir relations with the enemy that
we could not place trust and con- !
fidence in such a government.
This was the policy of Assistant
Secretary of State Spruille Braden, j
who has now submitted his resig- j
nation. The policy now has been j
reversed in the person of Messer- !
smith, our new ambassador to Ar- j
gentina. It is now felt that we must
deal with Argentina—whether we |
like it or not.
WAGES ECONOMIC WAR
There has been little change in 1
Pcron's friendliness to democracies |
since the end of the war—he is now
waging economic warfare upon his j
neighbors. Paraguay is already j
prostrate from economic domination
by Argentina.
Braden bluntly stated his posi
tion at Buenos Aires: "We would
not be loyal to our country or to
the principles which we profess to
defend if, once we discover certain
activities of this nature, we do not |
report them openly and hasten to
pull them out by the roots. Other
wise, we should have to declare as
morally lost this very war which
we won with so much sacrifice."
U.S. SUPPORTS DEMOCRACY
Braden believes (and lias been
supported by Byrnes and Ache
son) that the policy of the U.S. I

should be one of supporting and
encouraging democracy—that the
long-range security of the U.S.
demands such a policy. It is ar
gued that this is impractical.
But take what happened in Bra
zil. The U.S. heard that Vargas was
planning to set aside the elections
and stay in office. At the crucial
moment Ambassador Berle made a
public speech in which he expressed
the great satisfaction of the U.S.
that the elections were to be held
as scheduled, and his hope that
nothing would be done to delay
them. Vargas was forced, then, by
local factions to resign in order to
assure that free elections would be
held as scheduled. This is a fair ex
ample of the way the new American
policy was designed to operate.
Ls such a policy intervention? The
size and power of the U.S. is over
whelming. In most Latin American
countries the balance of political
forces is so unstable, the role of the
individual so great, that whatever
the U.S. does or fails to do is in
effect intervention. Without willing
it, we are an influence in every
political decision. 11 we decline to
intervene in behalf of forces we
believe in, we automatically inter
vene in behalf of the forces we ab
hor. If the U.S. tries to avoid ex
ercising the responsibilities of its

pie the military regime has made a I
mockery of its pledge to the United |
Nations "to reaffirm faith in human j
rights, in the dignity and worth of
the human person," and therefore
that the high officials of Argentina !
were so seriously compromised in i
thoir relations with the enemy that
we could not place trust and con- !
fidence in such a government.
This was the policy of Assistant
Secretary of State Spruille Braden, j
who has now submitted his resig- j

WAGES ECONOMIC WAR
There has been little change in 1
Pcron's friendliness to democracies |
since the end of the war—he is now
waging economic warfare upon his j
neighbors. Paraguay is already j
prostrate from economic domination
by Argentina.
Braden bluntly stated his posi
tion at Buenos Aires: "We would
not be loyal to our country or to
the principles which we profess to
defend if, once we discover certain
activities of this nature, we do not |
report them openly and hasten to
pull them out by the roots. Other
wise, we should have to declare as
morally lost this very war which
we won with so much sacrifice."
U.S. SUPPORTS DEMOCRACY
Braden believes (and lias been
supported by Byrnes and Ache
son) that the policy of the U.S. I

should be one of supporting and
encouraging democracy—that the
long-range security of the U.S.
demands such a policy. It is ar
gued that this is impractical.
But take what happened in Bra
zil. The U.S. heard that Vargas was
planning to set aside the elections
and stay in office. At the crucial
moment Ambassador Berle made a
public speech in which he expressed
the great satisfaction of the U.S.
that the elections were to be held
as scheduled, and his hope that
nothing would be done to delay
them. Vargas was forced, then, by
local factions to resign in order to
assure that free elections would be
held as scheduled. This is a fair ex
ample of the way the new American
policy was designed to operate.
Ls such a policy intervention? The
size and power of the U.S. is over
whelming. In most Latin American
countries the balance of political
forces is so unstable, the role of the
individual so great, that whatever
the U.S. does or fails to do is in
effect intervention. Without willing
it, we are an influence in every
political decision. 11 we decline to
intervene in behalf of forces we
believe in, we automatically inter
vene in behalf of the forces we ab
hor. If the U.S. tries to avoid ex
ercising the responsibilities of its
power it really exercises them in
behalf of the status quo.
NEED ACTION POLICY
The criticism of Braden's policy
has been that it is one of words, not
action, and it should be a policy of
action. Dictators should not be in
vited to the White .House (the cruel
dictator of the Dominican Republic
was as cordially received as the
democratic president of Colombia);
they should be given no military

I decorations, no military equipment
' (the dictatorship of Nicaragua re
ceived lend-lease arms on the same
j scale as democratic Costa Rica), no
I loans, no favors.
What do the democratic Latinos
say? Both the president and foreign
| minister ol Guatemala are among
; the strongest supporters of Mr. Bra-
I den's attempts to secure Argentine
I compliance with inter - American
! commitments. President Arevallo
said Braden's resignation would be
I "a severe blow to democracy in Latin
j America,"and his foreign minister
! thought that "all the American dic-
I tators would rejoice and dictator
ship would spread in the hemi
i sphere." Their comments cast an
j authoritative light on the conse
j quences of abandoning inter-Amer
ican agreements.

The U.S. policy toward Argen- ■
tina is about to undergo a change.
The line is expected to be one j
of friendly moderation, a definite !
switch from the harsh treatment ac
corded Juan D. Peron 111 the past, j
Is this change justified? What is the !
liberal viewpoint?
The situation is this: the Ar
gentine government is a fascist
military dictatorship which aided
the Axis. If U.N. censure of Axis
Spain is justified, so equally should
be censure of Argentina.
The State Department proved be
yond reasonable doubt (with evi
dence from captured German docu
ments and interrogation of German
officials) that successive Argentine i
regimes tolerated German agents,
the leading figures collaborated with
them, and that the regimes had not
taken effective steps to destroy
German economic power in Argen
tina.
CANNOT BE TRUSTED
President Peron while chief of the !
Secretariat of the War Ministry had j

been the chief
conspirator in an
activated plan
with the Nazi I
government of j
undermining and 1
subverting pro-
Allied govern
ments (Bolivia, I
Brazil, Chile, j
Paraguay, Uru j
gay). From such 1
facts as these I
the U. S. con
cluded that by |
its brutal use of |
force and ter-

roristic methods to strike down all
opposition from the Argentine peo- j
pie the military regime has made a I
mockery of its pledge to the United |
Nations "to reaffirm faith in human j
rights, in the dignity and worth of
the human person," and therefore
that the high officials of Argentina !
were so seriously compromised in i
thoir relations with the enemy that
we could not place trust and con- !
fidence in such a government.
This was the policy of Assistant
Secretary of State Spruille Braden, j
who has now submitted his resig- j
nation. The policy now has been j
reversed in the person of Messer- !
smith, our new ambassador to Ar- j
gentina. It is now felt that we must
deal with Argentina—whether we |
like it or not.
WAGES ECONOMIC WAR
There has been little change in 1
Pcron's friendliness to democracies |
since the end of the war—he is now
waging economic warfare upon his j
neighbors. Paraguay is already j
prostrate from economic domination
by Argentina.
Braden bluntly stated his posi
tion at Buenos Aires: "We would
not be loyal to our country or to
the principles which we profess to
defend if, once we discover certain
activities of this nature, we do not |
report them openly and hasten to
pull them out by the roots. Other
wise, we should have to declare as
morally lost this very war which
we won with so much sacrifice."
U.S. SUPPORTS DEMOCRACY
Braden believes (and lias been
supported by Byrnes and Ache
son) that the policy of the U.S. I

should be one of supporting and
encouraging democracy—that the
long-range security of the U.S.
demands such a policy. It is ar
gued that this is impractical.
But take what happened in Bra
zil. The U.S. heard that Vargas was
planning to set aside the elections
and stay in office. At the crucial
moment Ambassador Berle made a
public speech in which he expressed
the great satisfaction of the U.S.
that the elections were to be held
as scheduled, and his hope that
nothing would be done to delay
them. Vargas was forced, then, by
local factions to resign in order to
assure that free elections would be
held as scheduled. This is a fair ex
ample of the way the new American
policy was designed to operate.
Ls such a policy intervention? The
size and power of the U.S. is over
whelming. In most Latin American
countries the balance of political
forces is so unstable, the role of the
individual so great, that whatever
the U.S. does or fails to do is in
effect intervention. Without willing
it, we are an influence in every
political decision. 11 we decline to
intervene in behalf of forces we
believe in, we automatically inter
vene in behalf of the forces we ab
hor. If the U.S. tries to avoid ex
ercising the responsibilities of its
power it really exercises them in
behalf of the status quo.
NEED ACTION POLICY
The criticism of Braden's policy
has been that it is one of words, not
action, and it should be a policy of
action. Dictators should not be in
vited to the White .House (the cruel
dictator of the Dominican Republic
was as cordially received as the
democratic president of Colombia);
they should be given no military

I decorations, no military equipment
' (the dictatorship of Nicaragua re
ceived lend-lease arms on the same
j scale as democratic Costa Rica), no
I loans, no favors.
What do the democratic Latinos
say? Both the president and foreign
| minister ol Guatemala are among
; the strongest supporters of Mr. Bra-
I den's attempts to secure Argentine
I compliance with inter - American
! commitments. President Arevallo
said Braden's resignation would be
I "a severe blow to democracy in Latin
j America,"and his foreign minister
! thought that "all the American dic-
I tators would rejoice and dictator
ship would spread in the hemi
i sphere." Their comments cast an
j authoritative light on the conse
j quences of abandoning inter-Amer
ican agreements.
U.S. MUST LEAD
At the "Report from the World"
j Conference at Cleveland, spokes
i men for Latin America urged the
1 U.S. to slop forward and assume her
full responsibilities in world affairs.
| Uruguay's Foreign Minister Larreta
j urged that small nations, in the in
| terests of a democratic Pan-Ameri
: can community, abandon their fears
| of U.S. intervention. Said Larreta,
! "The installation of a dictatorship
| perils neighboring states and checks
i the realization of their social aims
