# Cagers Face Big Weekend
## 
### 
The varsity five yesterday began
working out the wrinkles* and rough
spots uncovered in last week's
games with the Olympic Club and
Fresno State. Attempting to reach a
physical and mental peak for this
week's contests with U.S.F. and
Santa Clara, the team will continue
scrimmaging right up until the
starting times of the games.
TOOK (JAMES IN STRIDE
Coach Everett Dean when ques
tioned about the games of the
past weekend remarked, "We are
starting today to do some special
work for the weekend tilts with
U.S.F. and Santa Clara. Last
week no special preparations were
made for those games, and it was
apparent that the boys took (he
(wo frays in (heir stride, without
exerting any undue effort."
Coach Dean continued, "In a
tough conference schedule it is nec
essary to have some spots where the
boys can take it easy and not push
themselves to their limit. Without
these so-called 'breathers' a good
team would undoubtedly go stale.
The series this weekend is regarded
in (he same manner as conference
pames, and the required drilling and
sei immaging for conference contests
will be undertaken during the com
ing few days."
BRONCS ARE TOPS
The (earns moving into the Pa
vilion this weekend are the num
ber one and two independent
squads on the coast. Santa Clara,
boasting of a record of 15 victories
against a single set-back, and in
eluding U.S.C., U.C.L.A., Califor
nia, St. Mary's and U.S.F. among
their victims, has the highest
standing of any five this side of
(lie Rockies.
U.S.F., which will provide the am
munition for the Friday set-to, has
been an off - and -on squad all
through the present season. The
highest point reached by the Fulton
Streeters came early in the season
when the rampaging Dons caught
Andy Wolfe and Company with
their press - releases down and
promptly administered one of the
lour defeats absorbed by the boys
from Strawberry Canyon.
TEST FOR RESERVE
The practice sessions this week
will be used as a testing ground
for the abilities of (he Card re
serves. Those who show up well
will see action during the week
end games.
There will be no advance sale
of tickets for the coming contests.
Admission will be granted to all
student body card holders. Starting
times for the encounters has been
set for 8 p.m., with the "B" squad
taking to the floor at 6:30 on both
evenings.
