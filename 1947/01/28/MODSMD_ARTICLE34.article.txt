# Crown Contender Graziano Confesses 'Lay Down' Offer
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 27 (UP). —Rocky Graziano, next to Joe Louis
the biggest drawing card in boxing, blew the lid off the investi
gation into the fixing of sports events today when he admitted
that he was offered a $100,000 bribe to throw a Madison Square
Garden fight.
Graziano's sensational disclosure was revealed by District
Attorney Frank Hogan whose office recently exposed the at
tempts of a gambling syndicate to fix a professional football
game—a probe that already has led to the conviction of a Broad
way playboy for bribery.

Graziano, the "golden boy" of box
ing and one of the best in the mid
dleweight division, said lie was of
fered the gigantic bribe to throw a
fight with Reuben Shank of Denver,
a mediocre boxer, who was a 1-4
underdog in a fight scheduled in
December.
Graziano said the offer was made
to him by a man, accompanied by
two others, who approached him in
his dressing room after a workout
at Stillman's Gymnasium. Rocky
said he did not know any of the men
but said he would recognize them it
he saw them again.
SIIANK FIGHT CANCELLED
The tight with Shank was sched
uled for Dec. 27 but never took
place. Three days before, Graziano
complained of a sore back and it
was called oIV. lie went to Florida,
returning only last Thursday when
he was immediately called before
the district attorney and then ap
peared before a grand jury today.
According to Hogan, Graziano ad
mitted that he did not reject the of
fer and that he was approached a
second time. On that occasion, too,
he wavered, telling the men, "I'll
see you later."
He finally decided not to go
through with the deal, he said, but
decided to withdraw from the fight
because he realized he would be
"double-crossing" the men who had
bet on Shank—reportedly a $500,000
wager. He therefore withdrew and
left for Florida.
GRAZIANO RELEASED
Graziano was released after his
appearance before the grand jury.
He said he would be ready to ap
pear at any time that he is wanted
to give more information.
He also disclosed that the same
man approached him a year ago and
offered him a bribe to "take a dive"
in a fight with the late A 1 (Bummy)
Davis, subsequently killed in a tav
ern hold-up. He rejected that offer
and knocked Davis out.
Graziano was ranked as the No.
1 contender in the middleweight
division. His fight with champion
Tony Zale last Sept. 27 in Yankee
Stadium was unanimously pro
claimed the "fight of the year."
After taking a terrific beating,
Zale came back to knock out Gra
ziano in the sixth round.
Zale and Graziano had been re
matched for a title fight March 21.
A spokesman for promoter Mike
Jacobs said tonight that until all the
facts of the case are known, no ac
tion would be taken as regards the
scheduled match.

complained of a sore back and it
was called oIV. lie went to Florida,
returning only last Thursday when
he was immediately called before
the district attorney and then ap
peared before a grand jury today.
According to Hogan, Graziano ad
mitted that he did not reject the of
fer and that he was approached a
second time. On that occasion, too,
he wavered, telling the men, "I'll
see you later."
He finally decided not to go
through with the deal, he said, but
decided to withdraw from the fight
because he realized he would be
"double-crossing" the men who had
bet on Shank—reportedly a $500,000
wager. He therefore withdrew and
left for Florida.
GRAZIANO RELEASED
Graziano was released after his
appearance before the grand jury.
He said he would be ready to ap
pear at any time that he is wanted
to give more information.
He also disclosed that the same
man approached him a year ago and
offered him a bribe to "take a dive"
in a fight with the late A 1 (Bummy)
Davis, subsequently killed in a tav
ern hold-up. He rejected that offer
and knocked Davis out.
Graziano was ranked as the No.
1 contender in the middleweight
division. His fight with champion
Tony Zale last Sept. 27 in Yankee
Stadium was unanimously pro
claimed the "fight of the year."
After taking a terrific beating,
Zale came back to knock out Gra
ziano in the sixth round.
Zale and Graziano had been re
matched for a title fight March 21.
A spokesman for promoter Mike
Jacobs said tonight that until all the
facts of the case are known, no ac
tion would be taken as regards the
scheduled match.
NEW YORK, Jan. 27 (UP). —Rocky Graziano, next to Joe Louis
the biggest drawing card in boxing, blew the lid off the investi
gation into the fixing of sports events today when he admitted
that he was offered a $100,000 bribe to throw a Madison Square
Garden fight.
Graziano's sensational disclosure was revealed by District
Attorney Frank Hogan whose office recently exposed the at
tempts of a gambling syndicate to fix a professional football
game—a probe that already has led to the conviction of a Broad
way playboy for bribery.

Graziano, the "golden boy" of box
ing and one of the best in the mid
dleweight division, said lie was of
fered the gigantic bribe to throw a
fight with Reuben Shank of Denver,
a mediocre boxer, who was a 1-4
underdog in a fight scheduled in
December.
Graziano said the offer was made
to him by a man, accompanied by
two others, who approached him in
his dressing room after a workout
at Stillman's Gymnasium. Rocky
said he did not know any of the men
but said he would recognize them it
he saw them again.
SIIANK FIGHT CANCELLED
The tight with Shank was sched
uled for Dec. 27 but never took
place. Three days before, Graziano
complained of a sore back and it
was called oIV. lie went to Florida,
