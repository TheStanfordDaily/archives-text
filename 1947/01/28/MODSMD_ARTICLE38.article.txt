# Oldtimers Recall Exploits of John Lanagan, Early Farm Diamond Ace
## 
### ART LEVINSON 
Whenever a group of old - time
sports followers gather round the
proverbial wood stove, and start re
calling the olden days when the
athletes were really he-men, we of
the rip-snorting '40's can usually
spike the dripping nostalgia as
wishful sentiment.
But when the corncob conversa
tion switches over to such gents as
J. W. Lanagan, we've got to take a
back seat and admit all but the ob
viously false utterances by the brag
garts.
The name J. YV. Lanagan doesn't
strike a familiar note in your cat
alogue of sports lore? J.W.L. is
only about the greatest athlete
that lias ever been produced on the
Farm. Baseball was J.W.'s game,
and he played the sport like an
artist striving for the perfect.
Let's chop off 45 years from the
calendar, and find out exactly what
John Lanagan did to achieve such
stature in the annals of fame.
DAILY MOUND CHORE
First of all, John pitched ball as
an undergraduate. Not every fourth
day, as the flingers of this era do,
but every afternoon. When his pitch
ing arm got a little sore, "Dad"
Moulton — Stanford's old trainer —
would rub on liniment that would
knock a horse out on his flipper,
and John would be ready to go once
more.
Such trivials as freshman ineligi
bility didn't hover about during the
sparkling 1890's, so John pitched
four years, averaging about 15 games
a season. Besides going to classes.
After Dr. David Starr Jordan pre
sented John W. Lanagan with a di
ploma in recognition of four years
of collegiate endeavors, John pitch
ed for Clift" Ireland's Independents,
an outfit that scampered about, play
ing games with all comers.
LANAGAN RETURNS
Then Lanagan returned to Stan
ford, and that's when the real his
tory begins. He mentored the base
ball squad for several seasons, with
his team downing Cal several times.
Beating Cal today is a crowning
glory, but in those days it was im
portant and glorious enough to rate
headlines on the front pages of the
San Francisco papers.
In the course of time the foot
ball coaching job was vacant at
Stanford. Wandering eyes looked
at Lanagan. Would he take the
job? Yes—hut on the condition
that people wouldn't expect too
much from him. After all, foot
ball was only a sidelight during
his college career, and while he
played excellent ball at the full
back slot, he never took the game
too seriously.
What happens? The first season
Lanagan pops up with a win over
Cal! The second year, a repeat per
formance. Then two shocking events
rock Stanford affairs. First comes
the decision to abandon football, and
take up rugby, and the second dis
turbance was the great earthquake.
(Some have said that the quake was
the wrath of the gods for abandon
ing football. That fact, however,
cannot be verified.)
NEW TO RUGBY
But who's to coach the rugby
team? Lanagan had never seen a
game of rugby in his life. Then
some bright-minded fellow sug
gests (hat Lanagan go to Canada
for the summer to see how the lads
from Saskatchewan play the old
English game. That Lanagan did.
He came back from the northern
wilderness with a pocketful of notes
which he passed on to his rugby

virtuosi. They absorbed the point
ers heartily, and promptly spoanked
Cal with a harsh defeat.
After handling the rugby team for
two seasons, Lanagan resigned to
enter private law practice. But he
could always be found wandering
about the playing fields of Stanford
in his spare time.
In 1937, J. W. Lanagan passed on.
Services were conducted at the Me
morial Chapel, with the main por
tion of the program being aired over
a national radio network.
As Harry Wolters, who knew Lan
agan, said, "When Stanford starts
turning out finer men than J. W.
Lanagan, we will have reached the
true status of Utopia."

job? Yes—hut on the condition
that people wouldn't expect too
much from him. After all, foot
ball was only a sidelight during
his college career, and while he
played excellent ball at the full
back slot, he never took the game
too seriously.
What happens? The first season
Lanagan pops up with a win over
Cal! The second year, a repeat per
formance. Then two shocking events
rock Stanford affairs. First comes
the decision to abandon football, and
take up rugby, and the second dis
turbance was the great earthquake.
(Some have said that the quake was
the wrath of the gods for abandon
ing football. That fact, however,
cannot be verified.)
NEW TO RUGBY
But who's to coach the rugby
team? Lanagan had never seen a
game of rugby in his life. Then
some bright-minded fellow sug
gests (hat Lanagan go to Canada
for the summer to see how the lads
from Saskatchewan play the old
English game. That Lanagan did.
He came back from the northern
wilderness with a pocketful of notes
which he passed on to his rugby

virtuosi. They absorbed the point
ers heartily, and promptly spoanked
Cal with a harsh defeat.
After handling the rugby team for
two seasons, Lanagan resigned to
enter private law practice. But he
could always be found wandering
about the playing fields of Stanford
in his spare time.
In 1937, J. W. Lanagan passed on.
Services were conducted at the Me
morial Chapel, with the main por
tion of the program being aired over
a national radio network.
As Harry Wolters, who knew Lan
agan, said, "When Stanford starts
turning out finer men than J. W.
Lanagan, we will have reached the
true status of Utopia."
Whenever a group of old - time
sports followers gather round the
proverbial wood stove, and start re
calling the olden days when the
athletes were really he-men, we of
the rip-snorting '40's can usually
spike the dripping nostalgia as
wishful sentiment.
But when the corncob conversa
tion switches over to such gents as
J. W. Lanagan, we've got to take a
back seat and admit all but the ob
viously false utterances by the brag
garts.
The name J. YV. Lanagan doesn't

alogue of sports lore? J.W.L. is
only about the greatest athlete
that lias ever been produced on the
Farm. Baseball was J.W.'s game,
and he played the sport like an
artist striving for the perfect.
Let's chop off 45 years from the
calendar, and find out exactly what
John Lanagan did to achieve such
stature in the annals of fame.
DAILY MOUND CHORE
First of all, John pitched ball as
an undergraduate. Not every fourth
day, as the flingers of this era do,
but every afternoon. When his pitch
ing arm got a little sore, "Dad"
Moulton — Stanford's old trainer —
would rub on liniment that would
knock a horse out on his flipper,
and John would be ready to go once
more.
Such trivials as freshman ineligi
bility didn't hover about during the
sparkling 1890's, so John pitched
four years, averaging about 15 games
a season. Besides going to classes.
After Dr. David Starr Jordan pre
sented John W. Lanagan with a di
ploma in recognition of four years
of collegiate endeavors, John pitch
ed for Clift" Ireland's Independents,
an outfit that scampered about, play
ing games with all comers.
LANAGAN RETURNS
Then Lanagan returned to Stan
ford, and that's when the real his
tory begins. He mentored the base
ball squad for several seasons, with
his team downing Cal several times.
Beating Cal today is a crowning
glory, but in those days it was im
portant and glorious enough to rate
headlines on the front pages of the
San Francisco papers.
In the course of time the foot
ball coaching job was vacant at
Stanford. Wandering eyes looked
at Lanagan. Would he take the
job? Yes—hut on the condition
that people wouldn't expect too
much from him. After all, foot
ball was only a sidelight during

played excellent ball at the full
