# Coach Lindsey Gives Crew Daily Practice in Try for Comeback
## 
### 
The traditionally neglected Stan
ford crew, a sell-financed organi
zation of GO members, is attempting
a comeback this season and prac
ticing every afternoon.
Lou Lindsey, now a student in
die Graduate School of Business
here, is the team's coach. Lindsey,
who was coxswain at California
for four years before the war, pi
loted the varsity crew to victory
in its race against Cal last quarter.
This was the first time a Stanford
shell had beaten the Berkeley foe
in 25 years.
TIRELESS EFFORTS
Largely through the tireless ef
forts of Lindsey, who spends the
major part of his afternoons tutor
ing potential oarsmen on the finer
points of rowing, Stanford should
make a strong bid for Coast honors
this spring against the sector's lead
ing crews.
Stan Cumberpateh, captain of the
crew, also deserves praise for his
efforts. With frosh experience in
1942. Cumberpateh was instrumen
tal in reorganizing the crew last
autumn, amid the confusion of late
quarter changes.
EXPERIENCED NUCLEUS
In addition to Cumberpateh, sev
eral other experienced oarsmen form
the nucleus of the squad. Mark Au
di, secretary-treasurer of the or
ganization. rowed pre-war frosh at
Cal. Norm Scheiber and Bob Phil
lips both were among pre-war frosh
stiirs here. Bill Whiteford, stroke,
has had eastern prep school experi
ence, and has sculled in Canadian
meets. Bob Scothorn and Bill Car
ter rowed as freshmen at Annapolis
and Washington, respectively. Geo.
Benedict has had prep school expe
rience in the East, and Stan Hodge
is well-versed in sculls.
Although it is too early to make
truly accurate predictions, Jim
Brannaman, W. C. Lacy, Bill Ord

way, Ted Sheridan, Bob Phelps, Bob
Abrams, and Ed Burke appear
among the most promising of the
less experienced oarsmen.
The crew is managed by George
Bevier, whose honiw ;.s in Bolivia.
