# Service Bears Delivery Costs

### 
Breadth of Stanford's Student
Health Service was indicated yes
terday when Dr. George Houck,
director, announced that among the
cases handled by the service are
eight pregnancies of women stu
dents. The health service has been
handling maternity cases since last
April.
Under their basic contract the
Health Service doctors are not re
quired to provide maternity care.
However, they are glad to do it,
Dr. Houck said. But while the
doctors of the Palo Alto Clinic,
who staff the Health Service, are
willing to deliver babies of stu
dents, hospitalization expenses
other than the doctor's fee can
not be taken care of by the Health
Service.
This is a result of a ruling by the
Board of Trustees of the University
that hospitalization cannot be given
free unless the person concerned is
actually a student at the time of
hospitalization. And it is not likely
that a student will be in attendance
flu ring the last two months ot' a
pregnancy.
The trustees state that hospital
ization, though not actually in
surance. is an application of the
insurance principle and hence the
student must be in attendance to
be covered. All expenses of the
health service arc paid out of fees
which are part of tuition, and
contributions by the University.
But if a student becomes preg
nant while at Stanford we will go
ahead and deliver her, and we'll be
glad to do it. Dr. Houck repeated.
''And I like to see pregnant women
continue in classes as long as pos
sible; it's good for morale," he
added.
