# Nominations Are Different

The A.S.S.U. nominations closing !
today are a far cry from what they :
were in 1892 when the Daily Palo j
Alto (Grandpapa Dippy) ran an ur- '
gent notice begging a quorum of '
116—out of 661 students—to come j
to an assembly to hold up their I
hands and modestly nominate their
roommates.
As years went by, the-crops on
the Farm got bigger and outgrew
this system. Then printed nomina
tion blanks came in. To preserve j
Stanford's high moral standards
boys were only allowed to nomi
nate boys, and girls girls.
Then along came the great worn- i
en's emancipation movement. Un- ;
der a revised ruling girls could now J
nominate boys and vice versa. The
only trouble was that since just one I
signature was required on each
nomination, all the girls nominated
the boy they went with and vice j
versa. The ratio held this down j
somewhat, but it soon became ap- j
parent that there were entirely too j
many people running for things. So !
the present 15-signature nomination
blank was initiated. Now you can't
get nominated by your roommate j
unless you live in the Village.
