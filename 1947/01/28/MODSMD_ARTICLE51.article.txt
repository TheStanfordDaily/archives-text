# Margaret Coolidge Digs Up 50,000- Year-Old Horse Bones
## 
### 
1 It wasn't a gold mine that Mar
| garet Coolidge discovered on the
geology field trip last Saturday; but
! to her it was just as important.
1 And today she is the toast of her
j Geology 2 class.
While hunting fossils and poking
| at an Ice Age sandbank near Rodeo
on the shores of San Pablo Bay she
uncovered some bones. And these
bones were not just ordinary bones,
such as Rover would dig up out of
I the back yard. They proved to be
j the lower jaw of a fossil horse
yclept Equus occidentalis by those
! with sesquipedalian tendencies.
The jaw is a relic of an animal
that died on the Pacific Coast per
j haps 50,000 or more years ago. It
j represents the last type in an un
] broken line of evolution from Eo-
I hippus, the dawn horse of fox ter
| rier size, to the modern horse. The
horse actually became extinct in
North America in Ice Age times,
but was reintroduced by the Span
' iards about 1500.

Miss Coolidge graciously present
ed the horse jaw to the collections
of the School of Mineral Sciences,
where it will be permanently avail
able for exhibit and study.
