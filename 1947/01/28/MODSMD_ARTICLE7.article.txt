# Cheer Leader Trials Reopen
## 
### 
Yell leader tryouts will continue
Thursday at 5 p.m. in the Nitery to
fill the vacancy in the ballot caused
by the ineligibility of several try
outees previously chosen, according
to Ken Lettich, head yell leader.
The six tryoutees in all which are
chosen will be voted upon in the
Feb. 5 election. The one receiving
the most votes will become head yell
leader, and the second and the third
in the running, his assistants. The
tryoutees will lead yells at basket
ball games before the election.
Those interested in trying out
should contact Lettich at the Phi
Kappa Sigma house before Thurs
day.
