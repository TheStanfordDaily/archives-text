# House Asks New Policy
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 (UP)..—
The House Foreign Affairs Commit
tee proposed today that it alone
"make a detailed study" of the State
Department with the idea of help
ing improve its policies, personnel
i and organization.
In a resolution adopted unani
jwmsly, it suggested that other
interested committees .keep their
hands o(T the department and its
new secretary, Gen. George C. Mar
shall.
j It proposed also to give close
scrutiny to State's administration
; laws concerning foreign affairs, and
j to take a long look at the interna
j tional organizations—like the U.N.
—to which the United Stales he-
I longs.
But a source close to the com
i mittce told the United Press that
I this was only half the story. He
said the primary purpose is to give
I Marshall a chance to get his house
■ in order—"to get ricj of the pinks
! and punks," as he phrased it—and
I to do it quietly so that the world at
i large can see that American foreign
| policy represents a united front.
In the most diplomatic language,
j the committee agreed to "invite"
I Marshall to "co-operate" and fur
j nish all necessary information which
j members promised they would
I "safeguard against any disclosure
which is incompatible with the pub-
I lie Interest."
| As this committee staked its
claim, six others were hinting that
j they were interested in some phase
| of General Marshall's activities, and
wanted to deal with him. They are
! Civil Service, Executive Expendi
j tures, Commerce, Un-American Ac
. tivities, Appropriations and Armed
i Services.
