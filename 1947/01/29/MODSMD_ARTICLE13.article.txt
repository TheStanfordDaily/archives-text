# Peace Is First Says Dr. Lutz
## 
### MARY VIRGINIA POND 
The bin question that hangs over
Europe and which should determine
United States' foreign policy in Ger
many is—"Can we find not a hard or
a soft, but a workable peace?" ac
cording to Dr. Ralph Lutz, professor
of history at Stanford.
"Yet of all modern peoples, we
Americans have the shortest histo
rical memories," he added. "It be
gins to look in America as if we
might forget the lessons of concerted
action for peace."
In April, 1945, the Uniled States
government issued a directive—J.C.
S. 10-67—to the Commander in Chief
of the United States occupation
forces in Germany.
It is this directive together with
the Big Three agreements reached
at Yalta, Potsdam, and subsequent
conferences which governs United
States policy toward defeated Ger
many, Dr. Lutz pointed out. ,
"There is disagreement among the
Allies on the decentralization of the
economy and the centralization of
the German Reich," he said, "but
10-67 instructed the American rep
resentative not to support measures
to strengthen economic centraliza
tion."
FOOI) CRISIS INDICATIVE
"The shortsightedness of the occu
pying powers, including the United
States, is revealed in the present
food crisis in Germany," Dr. Lutz
asserted.
"It is impossible," he said, "to
get these astronomical reparations
from a pastoralized Germany, a di
vided Germany or a reunited Ger
many witfi exports earmarked for
the victor."
Dr. Lutz explained that at Yalta it
was planned to hand over German
provinces to Poland and Russia.
Reparations in kind were to be ex
acted to the greatest extent possible
to pay for destruction—especially to
eastern Europe.
GOLD SEIZURE
The American Army seized the
German gold reserve.
The Allied Control Council in
Berlin has tried to keep uniform
policies for agriculture, mining,
currency, wages, prices, rationing,
transportation, communications,
import and export programs, and
reparations.
"None, of these plans has gained
much success to date," Dr. Lutz de
clared.
In regard to Russian reparations,
the USSR in 1945 was authorized to
remove materials from the occupied
zone and from certain external Ger
man assets.
Russia was also to get from the
American, British, and French zones
15 per cent of the usable capital
equipment of the metallurgical,
chemical, and machine manufactur
ing industries.
"In return," Dr. Lutz said, "Rus
sia agreed to supply the Western
zones with an equal value of food,
coal, petroleum products, potash,
zinc, timber, and clay products."
Besides the 15 per cent of capital
equipment, Russia was to get 10 per
cent of the industrial capital equip
ment which the Allies thought un
necessary for German peace econ
omy.
He added that the failure of the
Big Three to agree upon long-term,
realistic policies for Germany is due
to basic differences at Potsdam, Lon
don, and subsequent conferences.
The result has been a lark of co
ordinated effort in the four zones
with four separated programs of
military, scientific, industrial, and
institutional disarmament.
Another failure in United States
and Allied policy toward Germany
as named by Dr. Lutz is the indif
ference to the fate of millions of
wandering Europeans.

Dr. Lutz explained that at Yalta it
was planned to hand over German
provinces to Poland and Russia.
Reparations in kind were to be ex
acted to the greatest extent possible
to pay for destruction—especially to
eastern Europe.
GOLD SEIZURE
The American Army seized the
German gold reserve.
The Allied Control Council in
Berlin has tried to keep uniform
policies for agriculture, mining,
currency, wages, prices, rationing,
transportation, communications,
import and export programs, and
reparations.
"None, of these plans has gained
much success to date," Dr. Lutz de
clared.
In regard to Russian reparations,
the USSR in 1945 was authorized to
remove materials from the occupied
zone and from certain external Ger
man assets.
Russia was also to get from the
American, British, and French zones
15 per cent of the usable capital
equipment of the metallurgical,
chemical, and machine manufactur
ing industries.
"In return," Dr. Lutz said, "Rus
sia agreed to supply the Western
zones with an equal value of food,
coal, petroleum products, potash,
zinc, timber, and clay products."
Besides the 15 per cent of capital
equipment, Russia was to get 10 per
cent of the industrial capital equip
ment which the Allies thought un
necessary for German peace econ
omy.
He added that the failure of the
Big Three to agree upon long-term,
realistic policies for Germany is due
to basic differences at Potsdam, Lon
don, and subsequent conferences.
The result has been a lark of co
ordinated effort in the four zones
with four separated programs of
military, scientific, industrial, and
institutional disarmament.
Another failure in United States
and Allied policy toward Germany
as named by Dr. Lutz is the indif
ference to the fate of millions of
wandering Europeans.
The bin question that hangs over
Europe and which should determine
United States' foreign policy in Ger
many is—"Can we find not a hard or
a soft, but a workable peace?" ac
cording to Dr. Ralph Lutz, professor
of history at Stanford.
"Yet of all modern peoples, we
Americans have the shortest histo
rical memories," he added. "It be
gins to look in America as if we
might forget the lessons of concerted
action for peace."
In April, 1945, the Uniled States
government issued a directive—J.C.
S. 10-67—to the Commander in Chief
of the United States occupation
forces in Germany.
It is this directive together with
the Big Three agreements reached
at Yalta, Potsdam, and subsequent
conferences which governs United
States policy toward defeated Ger
many, Dr. Lutz pointed out. ,
"There is disagreement among the
Allies on the decentralization of the
economy and the centralization of
the German Reich," he said, "but
10-67 instructed the American rep
resentative not to support measures
to strengthen economic centraliza
tion."
FOOI) CRISIS INDICATIVE
"The shortsightedness of the occu
pying powers, including the United
States, is revealed in the present
food crisis in Germany," Dr. Lutz
asserted.
"It is impossible," he said, "to
get these astronomical reparations
from a pastoralized Germany, a di
vided Germany or a reunited Ger
many witfi exports earmarked for
the victor."
