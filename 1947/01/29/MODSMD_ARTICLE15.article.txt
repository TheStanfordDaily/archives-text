# UBC Debaters Discuss Farm
## 
### 
After traveling 1,000 miles by car
I since last Sunday, three student de
; balers from the University of Brit
ish Columbia arrived just half an
| hour before the Stanford-U.B.C. do
i bate was to start yesterday.
At 4:40 p.m., just ten minutes
I late, Bob Bennett opened the in
; formal, non-decisiona! debate with
j introductions of the six debaters,
i Representing the negative for Stan
| ford were Eric Johnson, Malcolm
i Barrett, and Dick Kelt on.
The visitors —Dave Williams, Ron
; aid Grant, and Ken Wardroper—
| took the affirmative side of the
| question, "Resolved, that labor
j should have a direct share in the
j management of industry."
I The U.B.C. debaters are espe
i dally interested in Stanford cam
, pus life. U.8.C., in Vancouver, is
J rated as one of the better universi-
J ties in Canada, but is different in
many respects from Stanford, ac
| cording to the visitors. They re
| ferred especially to the relationship
! existing 'between fraternity and
nnn - fraternity men, stating that
there is less discrimination between
! the two groups in Canada than
| there is here.
Their school year is also differ
; ent from Stanford's, in that they
| run on a year's schedule. Mid
terms fall at Christmas time, and
i there is only one set of finals a year,
l in April. Their campus, like Stan
i ford's, is quite large. It consists of
i about 12,000 acres of land.
Tomorrow the three will speak in
i the Women's Clubhouse under the
j auspices of the Y.W.C.A. at 10 a.m.
i on three aspects of university life
j in Canada—social, intellectual, and
I political.
