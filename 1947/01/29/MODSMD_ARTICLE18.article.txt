# "Not Educational Hoboes"
## VETS RAISE GRADE AVERAGES 
### 
Veterans ;il Stanford University,
in spite of predictions that the G.I.
Bill of Rights might make them
"educational Hoboes," are not only
holding their own in scholastic com
petition, but have even raised aca
demic standards tonew levels, Pres
ident Donald B. Tresidder announc
ed today.
During their first quarter of study,
under the full impact of postwar
conditions which virtually doubled
the student body enrollment. Stan
ford's 4,140 veterans were compet
ing on even terms academically with
the most highly selected group of
non-veterans Stanford has ever had.
Dr. Tresidder's announcement was
bfcsed on a survey conducted at the
end of the autumn quarter by Dr.
William A. Spurr, professor of busi
ness statistics in the Graduate School
of Business.
Dr. Spurr's survey covered the

J grades of 3,000 students in all de
partments of the university: gradu- I
ate and undergraduate—liberal arts !
and science.
In the lower division veterans held
a slight advantage over non-veter
ans, but it was deemed too small to |
be of statistical significance.
In answer to the question, "Mow j
[ are married veterans making out
I with their homework," Dr. Spurr j
j states that once again veterans have j
I a slight edge.
j On the other side of the ledger,
veterans were found to be having
! less academic difficulty than non
i veterans. Only six percent of the
veterans were in "scholastic difficul- |
ties" as against more than 7 percent
of the "superior new students."
Faculty members support the con
i elusions of the survey with the fol
lowing views:
Dean Fredrick E. Terman of the

School of Engineering comments:
"In general, the engineering faculty
has been well pleased with the per
formance of the veterans. They
mean business and have buckled
down to work. There is a definite
seriousness in their outlook; they arc
here to do a job."
Dean of Students John M. Stalna
ker says:"The veterans at Stanford
are serious, conscientious workers,
here for a purpose. In the class
rooms, laboratories, dormitory life,
and all student activities, the vet
eran is exerting a definite good in
fluence. His spirit and attitude are
excellent."
Skeptics who predicted that the
influx of veterans would lower aca
demic standards must now hack
down* in the face of their perform
ances last term. The result has been
p step-up of scholastic competition—
not a letdown.
