A.S.S.U. President Martin Anderson, questioned yesterday
on tension developing among groups interested in international
affairs, made the following statement:
"People on this campus are losing sight of the idea of intro
ducing the Stanford student body to international problems, of

4 which sending students abroad this
summer is a part. They are becom
ing more concerned with the for
; mula by which this can be achieved
than with practical operations to
achieve their goal.
"Politics and personalities are
causing us to forget this is our im
mediate objective.
"It seems unreasonable to me to
try to create a full-grown organi
zation of all interested groups over
night. It is far better to start with
a small successful segment of this.
"The co-operative plan brought
up by Niel Allen Monday night is
already working merely as a solu
tion to immediate problems. In the
future it Is expected that a much
larger plan to make use of Inter
national Survey Committee will de
velop."
In answer to conflicting state
ments about appointive powers,
Anderson said: "Niel Allen, head of
1.5.C., has the power to create com
mittees under I.S.C. as long as they
further sending students abroad."
He concluded that "A committee
will probably be set up by Excom to
review various proposed plans for
co-ordination of the international
groups on campus."
