# Council Ends Toyon Dispute
## 
### 
Men's Council last night partially
settled the Toyon case. The Coun
cil did not condone the Univer
sity's confiscation ot two students'
guns during Christmas vacation, but
recommended that the confiscation
itself be sufficient penalty.
The trial of the students from
whose rooms liquor was confiscated
will come up before t.he Council
next week.
Ted Lee. member of Men's Coun
cil, stated th" Council "merely tried
the case which had violated Uni
versity regulations, but did not have
authority to determine the legality
of or take a stand on University
policy."
Lee added that final determina
tion of the penalty will rest with
Dean of Students John M. Stalna
ker.
A case involving an Honor Code
violation was also tried. The ac
cused student was exonerated.
The Council recommended penal
ties for 16 traffic violations.
Fifteen hours of work at the Con
valescent Home and social proba
tion for winter quarter was the pen
alty advised for a student charged
with being drunk on campus and
verbally abusive to an officer who
was attempting to arrest another
student for speeding.
