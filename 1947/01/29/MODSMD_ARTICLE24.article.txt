# Women Want New Quarters
## 
### 
Three representatives of Bran
tier's 25 junior transfer students and
a group of the Roble sophomores
asked Housing Committee yesterday
for a room drawing plan that would
enable them to move out of their
respective living groups at the end
of this quarter.
Under the class preference system
generally used in winter quarter
drawings, the sophomores said they
would have no chance to move. I3nt
if the Roble sophomores are given
preference in drawing, the Branner
transfers argued that their normal
junior preference would be destroy
ed.
Housing Committee member Babs
Wilbur suggested a plan whereby
sponsors returning to their former
residences would be placed first (;i
normal practice); then the transfers
and Roble sophomores would draw
as one group with preference over
everyone else drawing. It was sug
gested also that seniors be allowed
preference over the special group.
The problem and suggested solu
tions will be discussed by Housing
Committee and Women's Confer
ence before any decisions are made.
