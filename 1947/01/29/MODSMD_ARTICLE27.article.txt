## Conflicts and Consciences 
### 
Group meetings have been cropping up in
the past two weeks all over campus in at
tempts to resolve the international interests of
the students into - worthwhile and workable
projects. Participating students are to be com
mended-such interest is encouraging—but
too much energy has been wasted in bicker
i lg, as was demonstrated to the extreme at
Monday's meeting of campus internationalists,
l ost in a maze of personal antagonisms and
h.ir mguing as to power has been the princi
pal aim of all these efloitb.
We have requested editonally—and at
tempted in part to supply —a long range pro
•j/am lor action supplementary to the 1.5.C.,
uid urged Excoin to initiate such suppletnen
;<iry projects. These and similar requests were
misconstrued as direct and sole criticism of
the I.S.C. itself. To fill the need and answer
the lequests, I.S.C. members, with N.S.O. and
Institute representatives, brought forth a plan
lor co ordination of their activities, already at
work. The go-ahead signal for formation of
tho planned organization was given to Niel
Allen by the student body president, who
himself wished to encourage any steps for
ward.
Suddenly cries of "illegal," and "we want
:;ome say, too" descended on the well-inten
tioned planners. Whether 01 not the plan is
the best possible concerns us little, when we

recognize that all steps at this point are expe
rimental. The possibilities of international ef
forts on the campus are so vast that criticism
can become wasted effort, and impatience will
continue to be a detrimental factor.
Careful planning must be done, with objec
tives not only immediate but far in the future,
It is essential that none interested be ignored,
that 'power" not be concentrated in the few.
Recognition of interest, and direct encourage
ment to international efforts should be given
by the governing group of the student body,
Executive Committee.
The suggestion that Excom tonight appoint
a small planning committee to hear proposals,
to organize definite projects, and to have the
power to recommend to Excoiri actions, reor
ganizations, and persons to' carry forward such
projects, seems to us highly satisfactory. Ex
com's committee can call or attend such meet
ings as were held Monday, to hear proposals,
learn who is interested, and initiate while co
ordinating all projects. They can meanwhile
determine finance possibilities, obtain offices,
and assist persons who want to now what
they can do.
Let us exercise the same patience and un
derstanding in our organization of "plans,"
as all of us must have to achieve our goal—a
positive effort to promote international con
sciousness among the student body as a
whole.
