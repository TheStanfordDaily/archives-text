### CEDRIC B. COWING 
Evi ry newspaper prints news, but really there is
nothing quite so interesting to people as other people.
What the Daily needs is more human interest stuff—
to spread a little ray of sunshine, to extend a helping
hand to the contused, befuddled Stanfordite. Here
• tic some samples from my mailbag. Just call me
"Cynthia" Cowing.
I've been going with a fellow for six months. I
like him very much but h<_> is shy and retiring. Re
cently when we go out he just sits at a table in
Ifossotti's and plays solitaire. Do you suppose there
could be someone else?
(Signed) Anxious
Dear Anxious: Your letter poses a difficult problem.
•Your friend is obviously sensitive so the situation
i < quires some finesse. I suggest that some night you
insert a joker in the deck. Perhaps you are respon
sihle in part for his behavior. Send for my free leaf
let entitled, "How to Develop Your Personality
Without Dumbells."

Dear Cynthia:
I've been corresponding with a pen pal in No
wheres, South Dakota. It's been thrilling but he's
getting quite serious. He wants a picture of me;
what shall I do?
(Signed) Lamb Eyes
Dear Lamb Eyes: Thanks very much for your photo
graph. Send your friend a picture of Gail Russell.
There's enough grief in this weary old world.

Dear Cynthia:
How can I meet a Stanford woman? There aren't
many open houses this quarter.
W. O. F .
Dear W.O. F.: Make your own opportunity. Some
foggy morning casually let a foot dangle in front of
a l'emme on a speeding bicycle. Women are so sym
pathetic. If you have six toes this move may mark
a return to normalcy. Careful that this operation
involves only the foot or otherwise you might be

hospitalized. Then you could only take a turn for
the nurse.

Dear Cynthia:
I've got a new Pontiac with red leather and my
friends tell me I look like Eddie Bracken. I have
never been anything but polite and chivalrous. Why
don't women like me?
(Signed) B. T. O.
Dear B. T. O.: This is the 20th century. Chivalry is
passe. Avoid being typed; don't carry an umbrella
unless it is raining. Be aggressive—stride up and
strike your girl friend several firm blows across the
face with your riding crop. Then ostentatiously
nudge her with a lighted Chesterfield. I'll guarantee
a reaction. Am sending you my booklet "Subtlety
and Women."

Dear Cynthia:
I'm minus 19 and have a difficult program this
quarter. My Spanish teacher is very exacting. I've
got to succeed, but how?
Desperate
Dear Desperate: Never give up hope. Go to Spanish
in a serape and sombrero if you have to. Maybe he'll
lose your roll card anyway. You've got to learn to
apply yourself; stop staring at the pages and start
reading the print; move your lips on the big words
if you must. Take my advice and you'll go straight A.
Imagine the end of the quarter! Your fellow students
forming a conga line on the Libe lawn lilting
strains of "Happy Days Are Here Again" on the
carillon. Gardeners in plaid shirts swinging brooms
and rakes which form a rhythmic background as
your adviser presents you with an Oxford scholar
ship. Your arch rival then discovers he's flunked
hygiene and will be held over for second big quarter.
Suddenly out of the Libe a gorgeous blonde emerges.
Looking to neither right nor left, she crosses the
Quad with outstretched arms. "Darling," she gasps.
An ecstatic embrace follows. At least this is what
happens in the movies I've seen.

Dear W.O. F.: Make your own opportunity. Some
foggy morning casually let a foot dangle in front of
a l'emme on a speeding bicycle. Women are so sym
pathetic. If you have six toes this move may mark
a return to normalcy. Careful that this operation
involves only the foot or otherwise you might be

hospitalized. Then you could only take a turn for
the nurse.

Dear Cynthia:
I've got a new Pontiac with red leather and my
friends tell me I look like Eddie Bracken. I have
never been anything but polite and chivalrous. Why
don't women like me?

Dear B. T. O.: This is the 20th century. Chivalry is
passe. Avoid being typed; don't carry an umbrella
unless it is raining. Be aggressive—stride up and
strike your girl friend several firm blows across the
face with your riding crop. Then ostentatiously
nudge her with a lighted Chesterfield. I'll guarantee
a reaction. Am sending you my booklet "Subtlety

Dear Cynthia:
I'm minus 19 and have a difficult program this
quarter. My Spanish teacher is very exacting. I've
got to succeed, but how?
Desperate
Dear Desperate: Never give up hope. Go to Spanish
in a serape and sombrero if you have to. Maybe he'll
lose your roll card anyway. You've got to learn to
apply yourself; stop staring at the pages and start
reading the print; move your lips on the big words
if you must. Take my advice and you'll go straight A.
Imagine the end of the quarter! Your fellow students
forming a conga line on the Libe lawn lilting
strains of "Happy Days Are Here Again" on the
carillon. Gardeners in plaid shirts swinging brooms
and rakes which form a rhythmic background as
your adviser presents you with an Oxford scholar
ship. Your arch rival then discovers he's flunked
hygiene and will be held over for second big quarter.
Suddenly out of the Libe a gorgeous blonde emerges.
Looking to neither right nor left, she crosses the
Quad with outstretched arms. "Darling," she gasps.
An ecstatic embrace follows. At least this is what
happens in the movies I've seen.
