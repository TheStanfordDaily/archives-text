'Iliere is an issue coming before Congress that is
not. receiving the publicity it should. The tariff, that
is. Some of you may ,ha\>o taken American history
arul recognize the issue, only as a historic orie be
tween the parties ot the clay. Some of you may have
taken a little econ and had the fallacies of tariffs
demonstrated in detail. Some of you, safe in our
ivory tower, may not even know what a tariff is.
That's a joke—l hope.
There are many aspects to the tariff issue. I will
assume that there is universal agreement that a
protective levy economically is unsound. It is not
so agreed, but I am convinced that it ought to be.
and space is limited.
Here will be briefly considered the international
aspects of the problem. There are two immediate
considerations: one economic and the other political.
We have loaned large—the total is fantastic—sums to
foreign nations, and I do not doubt that our bankers
are ready to make large private loans. In most cases
money or credits have not left the country; the loan
has been taken abroad in American goods. And how
will these loans be repaid? In gold? We still have
the greatest part of the world's gold. In dollars?
These foreign nations can acquire dollars only by

selling us goods. Succinctly, the money loaned rep
resents goods, and can only be repaid in goods. If
we are not willing to admit our debtors' products
into our market, we will have -tb whistle for our
money. And a protective tariff is aimed directly at
keeping foreign goods out of domestic markets.
There is an alternative: the businessman who will
collect his debts, whether his debtor can pay or not,
forces that debtor into bankruptcy, out of business.
You cannot peacefully force a nation, even if it
owes you money, out of business. But you can lose
your loan, its business, and its friendship. Do we
have so many friends in this world that we can kick
them in the teeth? This is the political aspect.
For those who do not care for the prosaic figures
of commerce, I can phrase it in other terms. This is
one world. No single portion of that world can cut
itself off from the rest and not suffer for it. If the
world is not prosperous the United States will suffer
in the long run. Our contribution need not represent
sacrifice and suffering at home; we are not asked to
give; we n?ed only do business with them. If we
buy from them, and allow them to buy from \js, wo
will have made a substantial contribution to world
prosperity.

in the long run. Our contribution need not represent
sacrifice and suffering at home; we are not asked to
give; we n?ed only do business with them. If we
buy from them, and allow them to buy from \js, wo

prosperity.
'Iliere is an issue coming before Congress that is
not. receiving the publicity it should. The tariff, that
is. Some of you may ,ha\>o taken American history
arul recognize the issue, only as a historic orie be
tween the parties ot the clay. Some of you may have
taken a little econ and had the fallacies of tariffs
demonstrated in detail. Some of you, safe in our
ivory tower, may not even know what a tariff is.
That's a joke—l hope.
There are many aspects to the tariff issue. I will
assume that there is universal agreement that a
protective levy economically is unsound. It is not
so agreed, but I am convinced that it ought to be.
and space is limited.
Here will be briefly considered the international
aspects of the problem. There are two immediate
considerations: one economic and the other political.
We have loaned large—the total is fantastic—sums to
foreign nations, and I do not doubt that our bankers
are ready to make large private loans. In most cases
money or credits have not left the country; the loan
has been taken abroad in American goods. And how
will these loans be repaid? In gold? We still have
the greatest part of the world's gold. In dollars?
These foreign nations can acquire dollars only by

selling us goods. Succinctly, the money loaned rep
resents goods, and can only be repaid in goods. If
we are not willing to admit our debtors' products
into our market, we will have -tb whistle for our
money. And a protective tariff is aimed directly at
keeping foreign goods out of domestic markets.
There is an alternative: the businessman who will
collect his debts, whether his debtor can pay or not,
forces that debtor into bankruptcy, out of business.
You cannot peacefully force a nation, even if it
owes you money, out of business. But you can lose
your loan, its business, and its friendship. Do we
have so many friends in this world that we can kick
them in the teeth? This is the political aspect.
For those who do not care for the prosaic figures
of commerce, I can phrase it in other terms. This is
one world. No single portion of that world can cut
itself off from the rest and not suffer for it. If the
world is not prosperous the United States will suffer
in the long run. Our contribution need not represent
sacrifice and suffering at home; we are not asked to
give; we n?ed only do business with them. If we
buy from them, and allow them to buy from \js, wo
