# IT CONCERNS US

### RALPH HOVIS 
After Pedro Benveniste returned j
from Milwaukee to his home in the j
Humid Pampa down Argentine way j
he deliberated one evening over one j
of "those" steaks and some wine. |
thinking about the Yanquis. He
wanted to write a letter to the In- j
ternational Training Administration
in Washington to express his thanks }
for allowing him to go up to the j
U.S. on one of those war-born in- I
dustrial "Rhodes Scholarships" and i
to compliment the Norteamerica- J
nos in general. His thoughtful pro- j
nouncement on America and Amer- j
icans was simply, "I was marvel- I
oused."
Far be it from us to dismiss light
ly the influence Pedro might have
on oth'-r Argentinos about the great
Colossus of the North—the U.S. He
is our friend and respects us. But
surveying the scene about Pedro, in
fact surveying all Latin America,
all are not our friends and all do not
respect us. On the contrary, many j
people have fears —fear of Argen- I
tina, fear of the U.S., and fear
of the inter-American agreements
which American republics' diplo
mats signed at Chapultepec in 1945. i
Those fears, translated, represent
Ihe problems of what to do about i
Peron, Communism, and the stand- j
ardization of Latin America's armed
forces.
NEW DIPLOMAT
Recent U.S. diplomacy has con- j
tered about Braden. The new di- i

plomacy will re
volve around ;
the new ambas
sa d or, Messer
smith. The cause *
of the change,
eoin in g since
1044, is Peron.
Mr. Brad en had
been tireless in
his endeavors to
promote these- i
curity of the en- I
tire hemisphere "
and the safety of j
the U.S. by fi
nally eradicating

every semblance of Axis activity in |
the Now World. But Mr. Welles and
Air. Messersmith believe his meth
ods were not set up to secure the
desired results and his attitude has
led the south-of-the-Rio Grande
governments to believe the Big Stick
is at work again.
KRADEN CRITICISMS
Bradcn has followed the thesis
laid down by Hull in the early '30's
in which "policy" meant something
you said, not something you did.
Criticism of Braden stems from (1)
his bitter personal feud with Peron
in the latter's own back yard, (2)
his casual okay of a speech to have
been given by our Ambassador
Berle in Brazil denouncing certain
internal political methods, (3) the
unilateral postponement of the in
ter - American conference without
okay from above, (4) the agreement
"in principle" with an Uruguayan
proposal that Peron be "dealt with
—an agreement made without con
sulting other neighboring govern
ments, and (5) the publication of
the "Blue Book"—a compilation of
all charges made against Argentina
since the early '30's — publication
made just two weeks before Argen
tine elections (hoping that Peron
would be defeated because of the
publicity, but resulting in the
smashing Peron victory).
Braden failed to see, according
to a recent Fortune article by A.
M. Schlesinger, Jr., that democ
racy means more than just throw
ing out Nazis, Communists, and
some Argentines.
PERON VICTORY
On the other hand, Peron won the
election because, while he tossed
around a club, he also presented a
healthy new government, replete
with five-year plans and social ben
efits for the people. The trend in
Latin America seems to reveal the
loss of grip on the part of the land
holders. the Church, and the Army.
There is a movement of dissatisfac
tion on the part of the Indians, min
ers, plantation workers, peons, fac
tory hands, and - those 'known .in
Mexico as "the low people." TBe
political problem for-South Amerfda
would therefore be the resolution
of this discontent.
Peron, the man. is guapo and
nmy macho. He's also nationalist,
anti-capitalist. demagogic, and
opportunist. He believes "capital
istic democracy as a world force
is dying. The choice is between
state socialism and Communism.
, —— 1

We don't want Communism." I'e
ron is doing a great deal for Ar
gentina.
lIEMISPIIERE DEFENSE
The present crisis involves the
cementing of Latin-American unity
through an inter-American confer
ence in which a treaty of mutual
defense would be signed. Braden
postponed it because he felt Peron
had not complied with promises to
take action against Nazi interests in
Argentina. Braden has had support
from Truman, Byrnes, and Acheson.
Messersmith has followed the in
terpretation laid down by Hull's
rival in the early '30's, Sumner
Welles, in which "policy" meant
something you did, not something
you said. The methods call for
gloved-hand approach, belief in
multilateral not unilateral action,
and the positive approach rather
than negative. Messersmith has
waded through Nazi revolution from
the Right and has observed radical
Latin emotionalism from the Mexi
can Left. •
MESSERSMITHS VIEWS
He -argues that the U.S. must be
reasonable and realistic in deciding
whether Argentina has satisfactori
ly complied with the Chapultepec
principles. It is thought to be Mes
sersmith's belief that Argentina can
be made a bulwark against Commu
nism in South America, and that he
can obtain the degree of co-opera
tion necessary for Peron and his
aides to facilitate resumption of
completely normal relations with
Argentina.
MARSHALL'S ENTRANCE
With the entrance of Secretary
of State Marshall upon the scene
we find, therefore, the two major
viewpoints and now a new, third
viewpoint. Braden is in charge of
the existing policy of hurling
charges ai Peron and coercing
Argentina in general. He has been

j supported by Truman and Byrnes
I and is further backed up by Ache
i son, a close friend ol' Marshall.
Messersmith is operating from the
second viewpoint, calls I'eron a
"true democrat," and plans to
work with him in uniting the
j hemisphere political relations. Ib
is cheered hy Wherry, («OP whip,
and follows, generally, the Welles
line. The new third contribution
is that of Vandenberg, who wants
a settlement but asks for it with
I insistence. This may raise the is
! sue of final responsibility for bi
partisan foreign policy.
The case for Messersmith indi —
j cat.es probable return to the prin
ciples of (1) adoption of automatic
recognition of new governments,
(2) non-interference in internal or
external affairs of other American
peoples, (3) playing ball with demo
| cratic groups such as Peru, Colom
bia, Uruguay, and (4)
using existing Boards and Unions
for solving mutual problems, and
(5) increasing press coverage of
j Latin American affairs.
Perhaps then, there will b« j more
| Pedro Benvenistes who will be
i "marveloused" about the
| United States.
