## SLING TIME

Dear Paul:
Fella, your recent column was the funniest thing in years; the one
about Sgt. Slinger, 1 mean. I'll have to admit that in the past I didn't
think much of your ability as a columnist —in fact, I thought you were a
cucllo de caballo tie segunda clase. Now I'll have to take it all back.
Obviously von have learned some lessons which are of prime impor
tance to columnists of a certain stripe. Not the least of these is, "If you
can't think up anything worth printing, take some other fellow's writ
ings; comment on them, twist them around, use lots of quotes." That's
what you did with my column on the Gal rooting section.
I'll have to give you an A on that: you did it up brown. Of course a
>iunto paper 20 inches of space to a review of my Harper's-pub
lied baseball article, and you cut me down to a mere 16, but that's not
iin portant.
It's a personal rule of mine never to do such things myself, because
I've always got plenty of stuff on my mind inane though it may be. I'm
breaking my usual practice this one time because I want everyone to
know how good I think you are.
Most writers would he pretty sore at you. hilt I'm different; I appre
ciate good writing. You put all sorts of things into my mouth that I
didn't say—didn't even think —in my column on the noisome California
rooting section, hut I forgive you. Harry Horba once told me, "Say
anything you want about me, but spell my name right." I don't quite
subscribe to that philosophy, but your writing was so brilliant I find it
impossible to bold a grudge.
For instance, you charged me with saying, "The Cal rooting section
defeats the opposition. The varsity hoopmen have nothing to do with it.",
You know as well as I that I didn't say it at all. but 1 realize your column
is for local consumption. Anything for a sensation. Actually, year in ; nd
year out, Nibs Price fields' fine basketball teams that win a goodly number
ol games away from home. That's what makes your rooters such obviously
poor sports.
Then you claim I said Stanford would win the second game of the
recent Cal-Card series. Actually I said the Indians would win a game
from the Hears before the end of this season. Of course a sports expert
like yourself knows why the Cards didn't play as well in the second tilt;
a basketball player has to run over three miles during an evening's work.
Price was able to use substitutes; Everett Dean wasn't. 1 don't expect
you to explain such facts of life, though, because your readers wouldn't
appreciate it anyway.
Anther one of your changes in my handiwork, as I remember, had to
do with President Robert Gordon Sproul—who was once my own presi
dent, back before the war. According to you. I said, "President Sproul
.sits with Price on the bench and approves of the beefs that Price begins."
What I actually said was that Dr. Sproul had never publicly protested the
antics of the Cal rooting section —but ol"course your readers wouldn't be
interested in that. Some people would start a libel suit over such obvious
misrepresentation, but not I; you'd have to stop writing columns—and I'd
lose my main source of amusement.
Personally, I think Dr. Sproul is a fine man. If California loses him
to an Eastern school, it will he a great blow. He believes in allowing
the students to run their own activities. In the case of seats being torn
out of the stad : <11 and passed to the bottom, I think he should have
taken a hand- -someone could have been killed. And when the starting
lineup of a ' .siting basketball team is booed, name by name—as it was
in the only Cal home game I've seen this year —some action seems
indicated. Hut of course he's right on the scene. and undoubtedly knows
best.
You state, Paul, that "the charges directed to the California rooting
section may have been true in the past but this year's section has been
( xtremely orderly and considerate." Well, they weren't the night I was
there—but if there's been an improvement I congratulate your school
sincerely.
Any improvement at all would be most welcome. Naturally you under
stand that I'm not against normal high spirits. The dividing line between
high spirits and vulgar hooliganism is very fine; in the past Stanford has
crossed it occasionally, Cal consistently. I'll take your word that the Bear
rooters are changing their ways; such a change can't be expected to trans
pire overnight.
Hut I'm getting away from the point; I set out to congratulate you
on your marvelous column. Your techniques are many; for instance, you
nt ived yourself a master of understatement when you said that basket
hall fans "boo purely because */112 ignorance." Brother, you're a card!
Here's another of your brilliant understatements: "Nibs Price DOES
NOT beef with the ref. He nay be incensed by some decisions." You
couldn't improve on that with \ thousand words, believe me. Of course
he actually has "beefed" in the Wist, but here again you show that you're
picking up one of the finer points of columnizing, as demanded in a cer
iain chain of newspapers extending from Coast to Coast. This little axiom
is. never check up on your facts; probably nobody will call you on a
mistake anyhow.
The same applies to your next point: "President Sproul doesn't sit on
the players' bench," Again, he has in the past, but who cares about that?
Tempus fugit. you know.
Relieve me, I appreciate your kindness in referring to me as "the
young genius." I know you meant it in all sincerity—hut I'm afraid I
don't deserve the appellation. I'm not young at all. Just to show you
how old I am. I went to the same high school as your A.S.U.C. Prcxy Ed
Welch—at the same time. However, I think you should accept the en
comium for yourself; everyone knows that your heard has yet to reach
the razor blade.
I notice you stated that the Card rooters, at the second game, "con
tinually hurled epitaphs at Cal cagers." Now this puzzled me; I thought
at first you might mean "epithets"; then I realized who you were, and
that you couldn't possibly be wrong.
You knew all along, of course, that an epitaph is a short verse in
memory of some deceased person. Usually they're carved on tombstones.
1 ran right over to the Pavilion, looking for holes in the floor; those tomb
stones are heavy, you know. But there weren't even any dents. Then I
realized the Stanford boys must have been merely reciting epitaphs in

inison; something like:
Here lies Andy Wolfe. God rest
his soul:
In death as in life, he's still in the
hole.
That must have been funny, Paul
>vish I'd been there.
However, it worries me to have
one so young dwelling on a thing
so morbid as death; really, you
shouldn't. But if worst comes to
worst, just make sure I'm noti
fied—l know my biblical history.
I promise I'll journey to your
lomli and shout — "LAZARUS,
COME FORTH!"

like yourself knows why the Cards didn't play as well in the second tilt;
a basketball player has to run over three miles during an evening's work.
Price was able to use substitutes; Everett Dean wasn't. 1 don't expect
you to explain such facts of life, though, because your readers wouldn't
appreciate it anyway.
Anther one of your changes in my handiwork, as I remember, had to
do with President Robert Gordon Sproul—who was once my own presi
dent, back before the war. According to you. I said, "President Sproul
.sits with Price on the bench and approves of the beefs that Price begins."
What I actually said was that Dr. Sproul had never publicly protested the
antics of the Cal rooting section —but ol"course your readers wouldn't be
interested in that. Some people would start a libel suit over such obvious
misrepresentation, but not I; you'd have to stop writing columns—and I'd
lose my main source of amusement.
Personally, I think Dr. Sproul is a fine man. If California loses him
to an Eastern school, it will he a great blow. He believes in allowing
the students to run their own activities. In the case of seats being torn
out of the stad : <11 and passed to the bottom, I think he should have
taken a hand- -someone could have been killed. And when the starting
lineup of a ' .siting basketball team is booed, name by name—as it was
in the only Cal home game I've seen this year —some action seems
indicated. Hut of course he's right on the scene. and undoubtedly knows
best.
You state, Paul, that "the charges directed to the California rooting
section may have been true in the past but this year's section has been
( xtremely orderly and considerate." Well, they weren't the night I was
there—but if there's been an improvement I congratulate your school
sincerely.
Any improvement at all would be most welcome. Naturally you under
stand that I'm not against normal high spirits. The dividing line between
high spirits and vulgar hooliganism is very fine; in the past Stanford has
crossed it occasionally, Cal consistently. I'll take your word that the Bear
rooters are changing their ways; such a change can't be expected to trans
pire overnight.
Hut I'm getting away from the point; I set out to congratulate you
on your marvelous column. Your techniques are many; for instance, you
nt ived yourself a master of understatement when you said that basket
hall fans "boo purely because */112 ignorance." Brother, you're a card!
Here's another of your brilliant understatements: "Nibs Price DOES
NOT beef with the ref. He nay be incensed by some decisions." You
couldn't improve on that with \ thousand words, believe me. Of course
he actually has "beefed" in the Wist, but here again you show that you're
picking up one of the finer points of columnizing, as demanded in a cer
iain chain of newspapers extending from Coast to Coast. This little axiom
is. never check up on your facts; probably nobody will call you on a
mistake anyhow.
The same applies to your next point: "President Sproul doesn't sit on
the players' bench," Again, he has in the past, but who cares about that?
Tempus fugit. you know.
Relieve me, I appreciate your kindness in referring to me as "the
young genius." I know you meant it in all sincerity—hut I'm afraid I
don't deserve the appellation. I'm not young at all. Just to show you
how old I am. I went to the same high school as your A.S.U.C. Prcxy Ed
Welch—at the same time. However, I think you should accept the en
comium for yourself; everyone knows that your heard has yet to reach
the razor blade.
I notice you stated that the Card rooters, at the second game, "con
tinually hurled epitaphs at Cal cagers." Now this puzzled me; I thought
at first you might mean "epithets"; then I realized who you were, and
that you couldn't possibly be wrong.
You knew all along, of course, that an epitaph is a short verse in
memory of some deceased person. Usually they're carved on tombstones.
1 ran right over to the Pavilion, looking for holes in the floor; those tomb
stones are heavy, you know. But there weren't even any dents. Then I
realized the Stanford boys must have been merely reciting epitaphs in

inison; something like:
Here lies Andy Wolfe. God rest
his soul:
In death as in life, he's still in the
hole.
That must have been funny, Paul
>vish I'd been there.
However, it worries me to have
one so young dwelling on a thing
so morbid as death; really, you
shouldn't. But if worst comes to
worst, just make sure I'm noti
fied—l know my biblical history.
I promise I'll journey to your
lomli and shout — "LAZARUS,
COME FORTH!"

Dear Paul:
Fella, your recent column was the funniest thing in years; the one
about Sgt. Slinger, 1 mean. I'll have to admit that in the past I didn't
think much of your ability as a columnist —in fact, I thought you were a
cucllo de caballo tie segunda clase. Now I'll have to take it all back.
Obviously von have learned some lessons which are of prime impor
tance to columnists of a certain stripe. Not the least of these is, "If you
can't think up anything worth printing, take some other fellow's writ
ings; comment on them, twist them around, use lots of quotes." That's
what you did with my column on the Gal rooting section.
I'll have to give you an A on that: you did it up brown. Of course a
>iunto paper 20 inches of space to a review of my Harper's-pub
lied baseball article, and you cut me down to a mere 16, but that's not
iin portant.
It's a personal rule of mine never to do such things myself, because
I've always got plenty of stuff on my mind inane though it may be. I'm
breaking my usual practice this one time because I want everyone to
know how good I think you are.
Most writers would he pretty sore at you. hilt I'm different; I appre
ciate good writing. You put all sorts of things into my mouth that I
didn't say—didn't even think —in my column on the noisome California
rooting section, hut I forgive you. Harry Horba once told me, "Say
anything you want about me, but spell my name right." I don't quite
subscribe to that philosophy, but your writing was so brilliant I find it
impossible to bold a grudge.
For instance, you charged me with saying, "The Cal rooting section
defeats the opposition. The varsity hoopmen have nothing to do with it.",
You know as well as I that I didn't say it at all. but 1 realize your column
is for local consumption. Anything for a sensation. Actually, year in ; nd
year out, Nibs Price fields' fine basketball teams that win a goodly number
ol games away from home. That's what makes your rooters such obviously
poor sports.
Then you claim I said Stanford would win the second game of the
recent Cal-Card series. Actually I said the Indians would win a game
from the Hears before the end of this season. Of course a sports expert

nt ived yourself a master of understatement when you said that basket
hall fans "boo purely because */112 ignorance." Brother, you're a card!
Here's another of your brilliant understatements: "Nibs Price DOES
NOT beef with the ref. He nay be incensed by some decisions." You
couldn't improve on that with \ thousand words, believe me. Of course
he actually has "beefed" in the Wist, but here again you show that you're
picking up one of the finer points of columnizing, as demanded in a cer
iain chain of newspapers extending from Coast to Coast. This little axiom
is. never check up on your facts; probably nobody will call you on a
mistake anyhow.
The same applies to your next point: "President Sproul doesn't sit on
the players' bench," Again, he has in the past, but who cares about that?
Tempus fugit. you know.
Relieve me, I appreciate your kindness in referring to me as "the
young genius." I know you meant it in all sincerity—hut I'm afraid I
don't deserve the appellation. I'm not young at all. Just to show you
how old I am. I went to the same high school as your A.S.U.C. Prcxy Ed
Welch—at the same time. However, I think you should accept the en
comium for yourself; everyone knows that your heard has yet to reach
the razor blade.
I notice you stated that the Card rooters, at the second game, "con
tinually hurled epitaphs at Cal cagers." Now this puzzled me; I thought
at first you might mean "epithets"; then I realized who you were, and
that you couldn't possibly be wrong.
You knew all along, of course, that an epitaph is a short verse in
memory of some deceased person. Usually they're carved on tombstones.
1 ran right over to the Pavilion, looking for holes in the floor; those tomb
stones are heavy, you know. But there weren't even any dents. Then I
realized the Stanford boys must have been merely reciting epitaphs in

inison; something like:
Here lies Andy Wolfe. God rest
his soul:
In death as in life, he's still in the
hole.
That must have been funny, Paul
>vish I'd been there.
However, it worries me to have
one so young dwelling on a thing
so morbid as death; really, you
shouldn't. But if worst comes to
worst, just make sure I'm noti
fied—l know my biblical history.
I promise I'll journey to your
lomli and shout — "LAZARUS,
COME FORTH!"

Dear Paul:
Fella, your recent column was the funniest thing in years; the one
about Sgt. Slinger, 1 mean. I'll have to admit that in the past I didn't
think much of your ability as a columnist —in fact, I thought you were a
cucllo de caballo tie segunda clase. Now I'll have to take it all back.
Obviously von have learned some lessons which are of prime impor
tance to columnists of a certain stripe. Not the least of these is, "If you
can't think up anything worth printing, take some other fellow's writ
ings; comment on them, twist them around, use lots of quotes." That's
what you did with my column on the Gal rooting section.
I'll have to give you an A on that: you did it up brown. Of course a
>iunto paper 20 inches of space to a review of my Harper's-pub
lied baseball article, and you cut me down to a mere 16, but that's not
iin portant.
It's a personal rule of mine never to do such things myself, because
I've always got plenty of stuff on my mind inane though it may be. I'm
breaking my usual practice this one time because I want everyone to
know how good I think you are.
Most writers would he pretty sore at you. hilt I'm different; I appre
ciate good writing. You put all sorts of things into my mouth that I
didn't say—didn't even think —in my column on the noisome California
rooting section, hut I forgive you. Harry Horba once told me, "Say
anything you want about me, but spell my name right." I don't quite
subscribe to that philosophy, but your writing was so brilliant I find it
impossible to bold a grudge.
For instance, you charged me with saying, "The Cal rooting section
defeats the opposition. The varsity hoopmen have nothing to do with it.",
You know as well as I that I didn't say it at all. but 1 realize your column
is for local consumption. Anything for a sensation. Actually, year in ; nd
year out, Nibs Price fields' fine basketball teams that win a goodly number
ol games away from home. That's what makes your rooters such obviously
poor sports.
Then you claim I said Stanford would win the second game of the
recent Cal-Card series. Actually I said the Indians would win a game
from the Hears before the end of this season. Of course a sports expert
like yourself knows why the Cards didn't play as well in the second tilt;
a basketball player has to run over three miles during an evening's work.
Price was able to use substitutes; Everett Dean wasn't. 1 don't expect
you to explain such facts of life, though, because your readers wouldn't
appreciate it anyway.
Anther one of your changes in my handiwork, as I remember, had to
do with President Robert Gordon Sproul—who was once my own presi
dent, back before the war. According to you. I said, "President Sproul
.sits with Price on the bench and approves of the beefs that Price begins."
What I actually said was that Dr. Sproul had never publicly protested the
antics of the Cal rooting section —but ol"course your readers wouldn't be
interested in that. Some people would start a libel suit over such obvious
misrepresentation, but not I; you'd have to stop writing columns—and I'd
lose my main source of amusement.
Personally, I think Dr. Sproul is a fine man. If California loses him
to an Eastern school, it will he a great blow. He believes in allowing
the students to run their own activities. In the case of seats being torn
out of the stad : <11 and passed to the bottom, I think he should have
taken a hand- -someone could have been killed. And when the starting
lineup of a ' .siting basketball team is booed, name by name—as it was
in the only Cal home game I've seen this year —some action seems
indicated. Hut of course he's right on the scene. and undoubtedly knows
best.
You state, Paul, that "the charges directed to the California rooting
section may have been true in the past but this year's section has been
( xtremely orderly and considerate." Well, they weren't the night I was
there—but if there's been an improvement I congratulate your school
sincerely.
Any improvement at all would be most welcome. Naturally you under
stand that I'm not against normal high spirits. The dividing line between
high spirits and vulgar hooliganism is very fine; in the past Stanford has
crossed it occasionally, Cal consistently. I'll take your word that the Bear
rooters are changing their ways; such a change can't be expected to trans
pire overnight.

Dear Paul:
Fella, your recent column was the funniest thing in years; the one
about Sgt. Slinger, 1 mean. I'll have to admit that in the past I didn't
think much of your ability as a columnist —in fact, I thought you were a
cucllo de caballo tie segunda clase. Now I'll have to take it all back.
Obviously von have learned some lessons which are of prime impor
tance to columnists of a certain stripe. Not the least of these is, "If you
can't think up anything worth printing, take some other fellow's writ
ings; comment on them, twist them around, use lots of quotes." That's
what you did with my column on the Gal rooting section.
I'll have to give you an A on that: you did it up brown. Of course a
>iunto paper 20 inches of space to a review of my Harper's-pub
lied baseball article, and you cut me down to a mere 16, but that's not
iin portant.
It's a personal rule of mine never to do such things myself, because
I've always got plenty of stuff on my mind inane though it may be. I'm
breaking my usual practice this one time because I want everyone to
know how good I think you are.
Most writers would he pretty sore at you. hilt I'm different; I appre
ciate good writing. You put all sorts of things into my mouth that I
didn't say—didn't even think —in my column on the noisome California
rooting section, hut I forgive you. Harry Horba once told me, "Say
anything you want about me, but spell my name right." I don't quite
subscribe to that philosophy, but your writing was so brilliant I find it
impossible to bold a grudge.
For instance, you charged me with saying, "The Cal rooting section
defeats the opposition. The varsity hoopmen have nothing to do with it.",
You know as well as I that I didn't say it at all. but 1 realize your column
is for local consumption. Anything for a sensation. Actually, year in ; nd
year out, Nibs Price fields' fine basketball teams that win a goodly number
ol games away from home. That's what makes your rooters such obviously
poor sports.
Then you claim I said Stanford would win the second game of the
recent Cal-Card series. Actually I said the Indians would win a game
from the Hears before the end of this season. Of course a sports expert
like yourself knows why the Cards didn't play as well in the second tilt;
a basketball player has to run over three miles during an evening's work.
Price was able to use substitutes; Everett Dean wasn't. 1 don't expect
you to explain such facts of life, though, because your readers wouldn't
appreciate it anyway.
Anther one of your changes in my handiwork, as I remember, had to
do with President Robert Gordon Sproul—who was once my own presi
dent, back before the war. According to you. I said, "President Sproul
.sits with Price on the bench and approves of the beefs that Price begins."
What I actually said was that Dr. Sproul had never publicly protested the
antics of the Cal rooting section —but ol"course your readers wouldn't be
interested in that. Some people would start a libel suit over such obvious
misrepresentation, but not I; you'd have to stop writing columns—and I'd
lose my main source of amusement.
Personally, I think Dr. Sproul is a fine man. If California loses him
to an Eastern school, it will he a great blow. He believes in allowing
the students to run their own activities. In the case of seats being torn
out of the stad : <11 and passed to the bottom, I think he should have
taken a hand- -someone could have been killed. And when the starting
lineup of a ' .siting basketball team is booed, name by name—as it was
in the only Cal home game I've seen this year —some action seems
indicated. Hut of course he's right on the scene. and undoubtedly knows
best.
You state, Paul, that "the charges directed to the California rooting
section may have been true in the past but this year's section has been
( xtremely orderly and considerate." Well, they weren't the night I was
there—but if there's been an improvement I congratulate your school
sincerely.
Any improvement at all would be most welcome. Naturally you under
stand that I'm not against normal high spirits. The dividing line between
high spirits and vulgar hooliganism is very fine; in the past Stanford has
crossed it occasionally, Cal consistently. I'll take your word that the Bear
rooters are changing their ways; such a change can't be expected to trans
pire overnight.
Hut I'm getting away from the point; I set out to congratulate you
on your marvelous column. Your techniques are many; for instance, you
nt ived yourself a master of understatement when you said that basket
hall fans "boo purely because */112 ignorance." Brother, you're a card!
Here's another of your brilliant understatements: "Nibs Price DOES
NOT beef with the ref. He nay be incensed by some decisions." You
couldn't improve on that with \ thousand words, believe me. Of course
he actually has "beefed" in the Wist, but here again you show that you're
picking up one of the finer points of columnizing, as demanded in a cer
iain chain of newspapers extending from Coast to Coast. This little axiom
is. never check up on your facts; probably nobody will call you on a
mistake anyhow.
The same applies to your next point: "President Sproul doesn't sit on
the players' bench," Again, he has in the past, but who cares about that?
Tempus fugit. you know.
Relieve me, I appreciate your kindness in referring to me as "the
young genius." I know you meant it in all sincerity—hut I'm afraid I
don't deserve the appellation. I'm not young at all. Just to show you
how old I am. I went to the same high school as your A.S.U.C. Prcxy Ed
Welch—at the same time. However, I think you should accept the en
comium for yourself; everyone knows that your heard has yet to reach
the razor blade.
I notice you stated that the Card rooters, at the second game, "con
tinually hurled epitaphs at Cal cagers." Now this puzzled me; I thought
at first you might mean "epithets"; then I realized who you were, and
that you couldn't possibly be wrong.
You knew all along, of course, that an epitaph is a short verse in
memory of some deceased person. Usually they're carved on tombstones.
1 ran right over to the Pavilion, looking for holes in the floor; those tomb
stones are heavy, you know. But there weren't even any dents. Then I
realized the Stanford boys must have been merely reciting epitaphs in

inison; something like:
Here lies Andy Wolfe. God rest
his soul:
In death as in life, he's still in the
hole.
That must have been funny, Paul
>vish I'd been there.
However, it worries me to have
one so young dwelling on a thing
so morbid as death; really, you
shouldn't. But if worst comes to
worst, just make sure I'm noti
fied—l know my biblical history.
I promise I'll journey to your
lomli and shout — "LAZARUS,
COME FORTH!"
