Versatility. That's what we need
more of. Some fellow who can re
port to Marchie Schwartz in Sep
tember, and heave the pigskin for
50 yards, boot»the ball 75 yards, and
jog a hundred yards in 10 flat!
And when the first frost appears,
this fictitious star could doff a bas
ketball suit, and rack up 15 points
every game. Play a little baseball,
too, in the spring. And in between
all these activities, broadjump 23
feet,
GUESS WHO
You think we're off the whackey,
and writing Underwood opium sig
nal;;? Not by a long-shot, if another
James Thorpe would register at En
cina. For the great Jim Thorpe, the
prize athlete of them all, performed
all the above stunts, and more to
boot.
Thorpe's collegiate banners was
the Carlisle School for Indians, an
obscure institution that was lucky to
get mention to any newspaper. But
'after Thorpe got started, every fea
ture writer in the country headed
for Carlisle to find out about this
Indian who was breaking every rec
ord in existence.
He is probably most noted for
his football ability. Running,
blocking, tackling, kicking, pass
ing; Thorpe was a star in every
division. His favorite exhibition
trick was to stand on the 50-yard
line, boot a perfect drop kick over
the goal post, turn around, and
boot a drop kick over the goal
posts. Nice, eh?
Alter the football season was over,
and punting 75 yards was a thing of
the past, Thorpe wasn't one to re
tire to his room, and spend all his
time pasting press clippings in his
scrapbook. December was the time
for Thorpe to get in shape for bas
ketball.
BASKETHALL. TOO
When Thorpe played basketball
back in the early part of the century,
positions on the team meant what
they said. A guard would guard, and
a forward would "forward" about.
Thorpe was a forward, so all his
time was spent crashing up and
down the floor, trying to shoot the
ball. Incidentally he hit the basket
with uncanny accuracy.
Thorpe really got wound up in
the spring of the season. Baseball,
tennis, track, lacrosse. Thorpe
wasn't particular. He took all the
sports in stride. He pitched a brand
of baseball that hasn't been re
peated. And his clouting. Any
manager would lose three ulcers
if he had a hitter like Thorpe.
In the spring, Thorpe would sign
up for the track team. No one-event
man was James. The 100-yard dash
in : 10.5; the broadjump at 22 feet;
the shotput at 45 feet.
We could go through the sports
page, adding one superlative after
another, bragging about Thorpe, but
we hope you get the idea by now.
MORAL?
What's Thorpe doing now? He's
working as a plant guard at the Ford
Motor Company in Detroit. The mo
ral to that story? Instead of being
an ordinary guard, get the job as
chief guard ... it pays more.

50 yards, boot»the ball 75 yards, and

And when the first frost appears,
this fictitious star could doff a bas
ketball suit, and rack up 15 points
every game. Play a little baseball,

feet,
GUESS WHO
You think we're off the whackey,
and writing Underwood opium sig
nal;;? Not by a long-shot, if another
James Thorpe would register at En
cina. For the great Jim Thorpe, the
prize athlete of them all, performed
all the above stunts, and more to
boot.
Thorpe's collegiate banners was
the Carlisle School for Indians, an
obscure institution that was lucky to
get mention to any newspaper. But
'after Thorpe got started, every fea
ture writer in the country headed
for Carlisle to find out about this
Indian who was breaking every rec
ord in existence.
He is probably most noted for
his football ability. Running,
blocking, tackling, kicking, pass
ing; Thorpe was a star in every
division. His favorite exhibition
trick was to stand on the 50-yard
line, boot a perfect drop kick over
the goal post, turn around, and
boot a drop kick over the goal
posts. Nice, eh?
Alter the football season was over,
and punting 75 yards was a thing of
the past, Thorpe wasn't one to re
tire to his room, and spend all his
time pasting press clippings in his
scrapbook. December was the time
for Thorpe to get in shape for bas
ketball.
BASKETHALL. TOO
When Thorpe played basketball
back in the early part of the century,
positions on the team meant what
they said. A guard would guard, and
a forward would "forward" about.
Thorpe was a forward, so all his
time was spent crashing up and
down the floor, trying to shoot the
ball. Incidentally he hit the basket
with uncanny accuracy.
Thorpe really got wound up in
the spring of the season. Baseball,
tennis, track, lacrosse. Thorpe
wasn't particular. He took all the
sports in stride. He pitched a brand
of baseball that hasn't been re
peated. And his clouting. Any
manager would lose three ulcers
if he had a hitter like Thorpe.
In the spring, Thorpe would sign
up for the track team. No one-event
man was James. The 100-yard dash
in : 10.5; the broadjump at 22 feet;
the shotput at 45 feet.
We could go through the sports
page, adding one superlative after
another, bragging about Thorpe, but
we hope you get the idea by now.
MORAL?
What's Thorpe doing now? He's
working as a plant guard at the Ford
Motor Company in Detroit. The mo
ral to that story? Instead of being
an ordinary guard, get the job as
chief guard ... it pays more.
Versatility. That's what we need
more of. Some fellow who can re
port to Marchie Schwartz in Sep
tember, and heave the pigskin for
50 yards, boot»the ball 75 yards, and
jog a hundred yards in 10 flat!
