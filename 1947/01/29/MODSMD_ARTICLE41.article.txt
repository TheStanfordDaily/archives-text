# Eligibility Of Myers Brightens Net Chances
## 
### 
Hopes for a successful tennis sen
son next quarter are higher than
ever with the return of Ted Myers,
former varsity star, to the squad.
Myers is now attending Stanford
Medical School in San Francisco but
is eligible under the three-year rule,
just as Dave Brown was eligible for
football last year. Myers , was first
man on the frosh team in 1942 and
achieved his greatest success in. 1943
when he defeated Harry Buttimer,
one of Cal's outstanding stars. Ac
cording to Coach Bugge, Ted is play
ing good tennis and is rounding into
shaoe.

At the present time Myers is
ranked first, followed by Lucian
Barbour, Hob Kcenan. Bob Rut
ledge, Ross Hughes, Doug Tuck.
Dave Basham, and Kirke Mecliem.
respectively.
808 FORBESUNRANKED
Unranked at the present time, but
shaping up well, is another return
ing varsity player, Bob Forbes, who
may be heard from by the time the
conference season starts next quar
ter.
The three leading doubles teams
are composed of Dave Basham and
Bob Rutledge, holdovers from last
year, Drew Putty and Lucian Bar
bour, who. according to Coach
Bugge, are "going great guns," and
Bob and Fred Lewis, who will not
be able to concentrate on tennis un
til after the basketball season is ter
minated.
STANFORD MUCH STRONGER
Although Coach Bugge feels that
predictions are not in order at this
early date, he does state that Stan
ford is much stronger than last year

and that the team is well balanced
and should make a good showing.
The men have been working out
every afternoon, weather permit
ting, and did well in an informal
practice held last week against grad
uate players.
