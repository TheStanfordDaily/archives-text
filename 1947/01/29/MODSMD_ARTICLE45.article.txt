## 
### LYNN CARMAN 
A scalp-hungry Indian wrestling
squad goes out on the warpath again
Friday night when it travels to San
Jose to meet the Spartans in an
eight-card match.
Student Coatli Vein Jones is
whipping his charges into shape
for this week's meet with daily
workouts in the gym. and hopes
to have them in the liest shape of
the yet-young season when Fri
day night rolls around.
Although starting with green and
inexperienced material, the Indians
have been improving rapidly and
already have gained some valuable
experience in the first two meets of
the season. The matmen were barely
beaten by UCLA. 19 to 13, in their
first match, and were handed a 28 to
8 thumping last Thursday at Cali
fornia.
This week. Coach Jones' charges
face a wrestling team which has al
ready defeated mighty California
this winter. The Spartans have come
up with a veteran squad loaded with
talent and rate as one of th£ teams
to beat in this area.
Jones is planning to send virtu
ally the same eight men to the
mat against San Jose as the ones
which have already seen action in
the first two meets. Winston
Mumby, in the I<>s-ll>. class, has
been the only Stanford wrestler to
win both of his previous bouts, and
as a result his will be only un
beaten record (if the squad to go
under fire Friday night.
Fred Berry, who wrestled in the
first two meets, may not be able to
see action in the 128-lb. class be
cause of a recent skiing injury, but
Jones has not yet definitely been
forced to remove him from a start
ing assignment.
Right now, these are the other
Indians who will probably wrestle
Friday night:
121-lbs., Dave Heninger; 135-lbs.,
Alan Walker; 145—1 bs., Dave Field;
155-lbs., Jim Kurfess or Bill Hoyt;
175-lbs., Roy Gaskin, and heavy
weight. Jack White or Dave Garst.
