# Ferber-Kaufman Farce To Be Given By 'Players'

Tomorrow night's Stanford Play
ers production of "The Royal Fam
ily," Edna Ferber's and George
Kaufman's famous comedy of life in
the theater, will have a few modern
touches added for its three-night
revival.
F. Cowles Strickland, director of
the play, has taken a few liberties

with the 1924 original, such as mak
ing the old "Leviathan" a Lockheed
Constellation, and changing the
names of out of date personalities so
that the action of "The Royal Fam
ily" will appear contemporary to a
15)47 audience.
The fabulous Cavendish family
and their plight as the "Royal Fam
ily" of the American theatre still
remains the theme of the Stanford
Players' production, however, and
their struggles to lead normal lives
in spite of their careers furnish the
laughs.
All of the action of "The Royal
Family" takes place in the garish
New York apartment of the Caven
dish clan where old Mrs. Cavendish
rules the family with an iron but
failing hand.
Various other members of the
family, some of whom bear strong
resemblances to the famous Barry
mores, Ethel, John, and Lionel,
struggle with the problems of mar
riage, child-rearing and the old
theatre adage that "the show must
go on." What happens when they
try to break away and live private
lives makes for the funny lines in
"The Royi.l Family."
There are still plenty of tickets
left for all of the three performances
of "The Royal Family." They may
be purchased - in the box office at the
rear of Memorial Hall. All seats are
reserved, and sell for 90 cents.
