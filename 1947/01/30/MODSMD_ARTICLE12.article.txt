LAKE SUCCESS, N. Y„ Jan.*2!)
(UP). —United Nations officials said
tonight they had assumed responsi
bility for accrediting press corres
pondents to the UN's Balkans inves
tigating commission after rejecting
a Greek proposal that the selection
of newsmen be left to the govern
ments concerned.
George Barnes, director of the
UN's press information division,
made public a letter from the Greek
government proposing that the cor
respondents desiring to travel with
the security council investigators in
Greece be duly accredited by the
Greek government in Athens. The
commission is gathering at Athens
to begin its tour of the.Balkans to
investigate border trouble between
Greece and her three Balkan neigh
bors—Albania, Bulgaria and Yugo
slavia.
The Greek government's letter
also suggested that the UN work out
with the other three Balkan govern
ments a reciprocal arrangement
whereby they also would assume the
privilege of accrediting newsmen to
travel with the commission.
