# Marines Get Orders To Abandon China
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 (UP). —Secretary of State George C. Marshall
today abandoned hope of peacefully mediating China's civil war and gave
the signal to withdraw all U.S. Marines from the war-torn country.
His decision will result in letting both Chiancr Kai-shek's Nationalist
Government and the Chinese Communists "stew in their own juice."

*• His long - range strategy is that
i withdrawal of all American "good
| offices" may cause both sides to re
[ cede from their uncompromising at
titudes.
Immediate cffect of the move will
I be:
1. "Return home orders" for an
estimated 10,000 Marines and about
2,000 U.S. Army officers at the ex
ecutive headquarters which was es
tablished by Marshall to maintain
! the truce he negotiated a year ago.
2. Possible resignation of Ambas
-1 sador J. Leighton Stuart, who was
j selected earlier this year because of
his many years in the Orient and his
long experience as a mediator with
1 Chinese factions.
Recall of the Marines will ease
increasing tension between the Uni
ted States and Russia in that area.
Soviet propagandists and officials
for months have denounced the
presence of the leathernecks. Rus
sia withdrew her troops from Man
churia last spring.
It was Marshall's first major pol
icy decision since he became secre
tary. But it was foreshadowed in
his Jan. 7 "plague on both your
houses" statement on China in
which he accused extremists of both
factions of sabotaging his efforts to
end the civil war.
The decision shattered whatever
lingering hope Chiang's government
may have had in getting much
needed U.S. economic aid.
