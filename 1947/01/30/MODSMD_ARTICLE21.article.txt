"While it is gratifying to know
that people will fight over prospec
tive plans for international organi
zations, we must not start walking
at cross-purposes," said President
Martin Anderson before Excom last
night in appointing Beth Mac Vicar
to head a central committee to re
view prospective plans.
Assisted by Excom members Olive
Wilbur and Frank Creede, Miss
Mac Vicar will take over active lead
ership of the committee at the con
clusion of her term as Daily editor
the end of next week.
"All students will have a chance
to air their opinions to this group,"
Anderson said. "They will main
tain regular office hours in a desig
nated spot."
Immediately after the committee
appointment, Excom voted Stanford
into the National Student Organi
zation to allow Marilyn Sidwell,
acting chairman of Stanford N.S.O.
representatives, to attend a regional
conference in Berkeley Saturday as
a Stanford delegate.
This motion precipitated a dis
cussion as to the aims of the N.S.O.
To help clarify the situation, Janet
Vester, "Y" Cabinet member, em
phasized that the N.S.O. is a student
organization considering not only
international but national issues of
importance.
Mary Virginia Pond, reporting on
the Asilomar Conference, suggested
holding a similar conference at
Stanford sometime next quarter.
