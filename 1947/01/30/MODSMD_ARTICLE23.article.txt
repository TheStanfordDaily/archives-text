# U.S. Standing Pat On Outlawing A-Bomb
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 29 (UP).â€”
The United States is standing firm
on its insistence that atomic war
fare be outlawed effectively before
general disarmament begins, but it
may be willing to have both issues
considered simultaneously by the
U.N. Security Council.
That position, representing a mod
est concession to Russia's demand
that the two questions be negotiated
as one and acted on together, was
outlined today by Warren R. Austin,
U.S. delegate to the United Nations.
Austin, who has just completed a
round of conferences with President
Truman and Secretary of State
George C. Marshall, said there is
nothing in American policy to pre
vent a double-barrelled approach
to the inter-related problems of dis
armament and atomic: control.
He said he will meet informally
with other security council members
after his return to New York this
evening and discuss the slightly al
tered American view with them.
