The complete motion which in
! structed delegates to the state con
j vention in February was passed by
a unanimous vote. Members felt
that the veteran would be better
! served by helping every citizen for

ond." they favored active work on
I better jobs, better living conditions,
and better housing.
Background on the burning of the
John Walker home in Redwood City
late in December was given by Lau

was completing his home despite
threats and was soon to occupy it
when fire flamed mysteriously late
on a rainy night.

formed in Redwood City in
vestigated and alleged that it was a
ease of "pure and simple arson." A
Palo Alto woman who has been ac
tive on the case has also received
letters from the Ku Klux Ktan
threatening her life.
Miss Patton urged that a caravan
be formed of Stanford students to
donate work to clear the lot to
ward construction of a new home.
Donations of work and money are
being accepted by the Council, 2050
