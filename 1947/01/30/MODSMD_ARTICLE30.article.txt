# 'I' Groups, Activities Files, Headline Excom
## 
### 
Submission of a plan for a central activities file, and much
confusion on the problem of organizing Stanford's multifarious
international groups, headlined last night's meeting of Excom.
Excom also approved the sponsoring of Spring Quarter Req
Dances by the Crew Association and Sigma Delta Chi, passed
modified requirements for Block 'S' in track, changed election

by-laws to allow more elasticity in
election of yell leaders and Daily
editors, and approved a report by
Frank Creedc on awarding of swim
ming blocks.
Reports of the international or
ganization controversy may be found
on column 6.
Tentative plans for the ActivitiÂ«
Bureau were introduced by Helen
Dietz, Cap and Gown president, with
the approval of Betty Davies, Wo
man's Conference; Elinor Giese,
Woman's Conference Committee
chairman, and Mildred Edward-,
A.S.S.U. vice-president.
"While establishment of this pi, in
will be difficult, there exists a terri
fic need to bring together committee
chairmen looking for help and stu
dents trying to enter activities but
not knowing where to begin," Die!?,
said in urging consideration of the
proposal.
After discussion of the mechanics
of the plan, the committee voted to
sponsor it and to make further plan.-
for its establishment after returi
have been received on form letters
explaining the plan sent out to vari
ous campus living areas.
Any trackman scoring ten or moi -
points in dual meets or scoring a
point in the California, USC, PCC,
or NCAA meets will receive a Block
'S.' This change was voted because
too restrictive requirements allowed
only nine track letters last spring.
Changing of election by-laws in
regards to selection of yell leader
candidates by Rally Com one month
before winter elections will not
change present practices but repre
sents another step in removal of
election restrictions. The same ap
plies to removal of the by-law re
stricting election of the Daily editor
to a Tuesday.
Frank Creede reported that block
letters for swimming, voted a major
sport last week, would be awarded
in the same manner as circles have
been on Coach Brandsten's re< >ni
inundation.
The more than 35 visitors attend
ing the meeting filled the Excom
room to capacity.
