## 'Socsch' It Up 
### 
Every week-end it's the same old story—
"What will we do tonight? Gosh, there's
nothing going on." But after looking over the
: ocial calendar, we discover that there are a
lot of functions every week-end.
Individual living groups and organizations
have been holding small parties, firesides,
and dances all year and there are usually sev
eral of them each Friday and Saturday night.
But these parties are closed to members ami
their guests because of limited space and
funds; so the majority of students cannot at
l< nd.
Yet when a large dormitory or some organ
ization presents an all-campus dance, so few
bids are sold that the group often cannot even
meet expenses. It is little wonder that there
n-; o serious lack of all-inclusive social affairs
heduled
Since you, the student body-at large, gripe
1/cause there's nothing foi you to do many
week-ends and don't attend a big d nice when
r < omes along, you've created your own con

flict. Although a few suggestions are in order,
the chief solution has to come from all of you
in your interest, support, and help in all
campus functions. When a dance comes
along, buy a bid, get a date, and go to it—or
such dances will no longer be given.
There are countless people on campus who
would like to help on some big dance, and
there is an idea group, Cardinals, whose duty
it is to co-ordinate and stimulate social activi
ties. As it is, the would-be helpful people are
unknown, and Cardinals manages to put on
only one, possibly two, dances a quarter be
cause its members and a few too-often used
students have to do most of the work.
If Cardinals and class excoms could think
up acme red-hot themes for dances and ideas
for other events which haven't been done at
Stanford before, and through the use of the
new activities file draw out those students
who are anxious to get into activities, we
might have a solution that is if all of you
will support the new functions.- N.B.
