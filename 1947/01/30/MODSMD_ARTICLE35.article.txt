# Hoopla for the Hoopsters

VVc hit our basketball low-point last week
end the team was low, the band was skele
tonized, and the audience sparse and apa
liictic.
That the students and the team can't be con
! finally "high" is indisputable. The team has
J.jc ed a killing road schedule this month and
Ihey showed it in their "breather space" last
week-end by almost losing to two inferior
teams.
But the pressure will be on for the rest of
Ihe quarter. This week-end, they take on the
two topflight independent Bay Area basket
ball teams--University of San Francisco and
Santa Clara—before they swing into a packed
schedule of conference games right into the
end of the quarter. Most of the games will

be on the Pavilion court where an enthusiastic
rooting section can give the team the support
they deserve.
Rated even lower than their football breth
ren in pre-season ratings, the comparatively
inexperienced basketball men have upset
UCLA, thrown a big scare into the power
packed Berkeley boys, and have shown them
selves as a fighting team worthy of full cam
pus support.
This week-end, the band members should
be required to be at full strength and the yell
leaders on hand at their enthusiastic best with
elections just around the corner. And while
it may break Mr. Masters' heart to watch the
gym fill up with free admissions, let's all be
there to watch the Deanmen topple the high
riding Dons and Broncos.—F. B.
