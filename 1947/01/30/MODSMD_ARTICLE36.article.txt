# BILL COUGHLIN
## BULL SESSION 
### 
Guess 1 II have to withdraw Tuesday's recommen
dation of "Pat Novak for Hire." It was too good to
Inst.
The show, which aired (and still will, I suppose)
ovi.r KGO at 8 p.m. on Sundays, has never made the
S.F. police force seem overly bright. (Some of the
vols who remember the beating two Stanford stu
dents took up there might be inclined to agree.)
Main stooge for the fast-talking Novak on the
show has been a homicide detective on the S.F.
force called Hillman. Never has he come out on top
in his verbal encounters with Novak. Some of us
were wondering the other night as we listened to
the show just how long it would be before some
one put the pressure on.
Apparently someone has. The writer was given
orders to clean up the script and depict the law en
forcement characters as more discerning and intelli
gent. He refused due to his belief that an "unen
lightened" police force is responsible for much civic
dereliction.
The writer was fired and when the star of the
show heard what had happened, he quit, effective
as of February 15. So there goes what was one of
(he best and most colorful shows on the air.
Just call a Coughlin recommendation the kiss of
death. Don't say I didn't warn you, Morgan.

NOTES TO COUGIILIN FROM COUGHLIN:
Check up on the Mrs. Hight who appeared before
Mens Council for a parking violation the other day
and was fined amid pleas of ignorance and many
teais. . . . Could this be the same Mrs. Hight who
not so long ago wrote a letter to the Daily about the
ill-bred Stanford students? . . . Find out who it
was that said, "What used to be Stanford's stud farm
has changed to Stanford's student Farm." ... Or
has it? . . .
What s this about a Stanford girl winning a case
of beer, a carton of cigarettes, two bottles of wine,
and a corsage on ail S.F. radio program? . . . She
would be a girl worth knowing even though I do
hate flowers. . . .
What's all this fuss about a War Memorial? . . .
Why don't they build a n?w Firehouse? . . . That
one's been there since the Senator was a frosh and
certainly doesn't offer adequate living accommoda
tions lor the lellows in it. . . . That's something that
would also benefit the entire campus. ...
Speaking of the Firehouse, mention that it's no
wonder they always turn out the best intramural
teams. . . . What other tong can legally offer its ath
letes 20 bucks a month? . . .
Go down and get your laundry. . . . 0.K., I will.

Just call a Coughlin recommendation the kiss of
death. Don't say I didn't warn you, Morgan.

NOTES TO COUGIILIN FROM COUGHLIN:
Check up on the Mrs. Hight who appeared before
Mens Council for a parking violation the other day
and was fined amid pleas of ignorance and many
teais. . . . Could this be the same Mrs. Hight who
not so long ago wrote a letter to the Daily about the
ill-bred Stanford students? . . . Find out who it
was that said, "What used to be Stanford's stud farm
has changed to Stanford's student Farm." ... Or
has it? . . .
What s this about a Stanford girl winning a case
of beer, a carton of cigarettes, two bottles of wine,
and a corsage on ail S.F. radio program? . . . She
would be a girl worth knowing even though I do
hate flowers. . . .
What's all this fuss about a War Memorial? . . .
Why don't they build a n?w Firehouse? . . . That
one's been there since the Senator was a frosh and
certainly doesn't offer adequate living accommoda
tions lor the lellows in it. . . . That's something that
would also benefit the entire campus. ...
Speaking of the Firehouse, mention that it's no
wonder they always turn out the best intramural
teams. . . . What other tong can legally offer its ath
letes 20 bucks a month? . . .
Go down and get your laundry. . . . 0.K., I will.
(Editor's note: And lie did.)
Guess 1 II have to withdraw Tuesday's recommen
dation of "Pat Novak for Hire." It was too good to
Inst.
The show, which aired (and still will, I suppose)
ovi.r KGO at 8 p.m. on Sundays, has never made the
S.F. police force seem overly bright. (Some of the
vols who remember the beating two Stanford stu
dents took up there might be inclined to agree.)
Main stooge for the fast-talking Novak on the
show has been a homicide detective on the S.F.
force called Hillman. Never has he come out on top
in his verbal encounters with Novak. Some of us
were wondering the other night as we listened to
the show just how long it would be before some
one put the pressure on.
Apparently someone has. The writer was given
orders to clean up the script and depict the law en
forcement characters as more discerning and intelli
gent. He refused due to his belief that an "unen
lightened" police force is responsible for much civic
dereliction.
The writer was fired and when the star of the
show heard what had happened, he quit, effective
as of February 15. So there goes what was one of
(he best and most colorful shows on the air.
Just call a Coughlin recommendation the kiss of
death. Don't say I didn't warn you, Morgan.
