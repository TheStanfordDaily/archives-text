To the Editor:
The tuition raise was 0.K.; those hidden taxes
• 1 ''n't so--.had; but damn these concealed 'Parking
. Verboten" signs!
I refer in particular to a "Faculty, Only'' sign
across from the oak tree bus stop near History cor
ner; y sign, practically invisible ip heavy brush,
which is closer to, the Cultural Ichthyology shelf in
the Reserved Book Room than to the parking area
to which it applies. With the income from the dozen
innocents trapped there each day, at two bucks
apiece, we should have enough in the kitty this
•pring to send our tic-tac-toe team to play the
• •hemps of the Uzbek Republic of the USSR in the
Vodka Bowl!
However, here are two suggestions which would
, make the "sucker catchers a great deal more lucra
tive and bring income up by thousands:
1 Paint the words in black on a black background
and have the signs pop up out of the ground for one
minute every:
a) St. Patrick's Day
b) Groundhog Day
e) Opening day of a new session of:
1. Congress
2. The Women's Christian Temperance Union
3. The Lower Mayfield Billiard Society
11. Use letters three-sixteenth inch high in Gaelic
or Amharic on every sign. By computation there are
.'1.(121 3 students in the University for every person
here who reads Gaelic or Amharic; thus a tremen
dous increase in the parking system "take" is as-
Mired.

However, if the three-tenths of a student were
guilty ol ;j parking violation it would be only logical
to fine him (50 cents instead of the standard $2!
Seriously—ean t local drivers get a break in some
ol these less clearly marked restricted parking zones?
How about painting the curb the color of the sticker
' required to park in a jj;ivcn zone?

To the Editor:
A few days ago. an industrious graduate student
undertook, on her own initiative, a get-together of all
Massachusetts students. The work involved was
rather considerable, considering the young lady
started last November to reserve a room in the
Women's Clubhouse.
Thirty-four semi-formal announcements of the
meeting were sont. The young lady made elaborate
arrangements. There were sandwiches of several va
rieties, assorted cakes, coffee and tea for refresh
ments. There were card tables set up for bridge, etc.
The turnout was startlingly disappointing. Only
five stalwart Massachusetts students gathered f<Ti
this august evening meeting. Worse yet, the other
Massachusetts students (some from Beacon Hill and
even Back Bay), representatives of one of the most
cultured states and indisputably the center of good
breeding, violated Emily Post's rules on etiquette
straight down the line. No one has sent his regrets
for being unable to attend this meeting! And the
young lady submissively accepts her financial loss.

The tuition raise was 0.K.; those hidden taxes
• 1 ''n't so--.had; but damn these concealed 'Parking
. Verboten" signs!
I refer in particular to a "Faculty, Only'' sign
across from the oak tree bus stop near History cor
ner; y sign, practically invisible ip heavy brush,
which is closer to, the Cultural Ichthyology shelf in
the Reserved Book Room than to the parking area
to which it applies. With the income from the dozen
innocents trapped there each day, at two bucks
apiece, we should have enough in the kitty this
•pring to send our tic-tac-toe team to play the
• •hemps of the Uzbek Republic of the USSR in the
Vodka Bowl!
However, here are two suggestions which would
, make the "sucker catchers a great deal more lucra
tive and bring income up by thousands:
1 Paint the words in black on a black background
and have the signs pop up out of the ground for one
minute every:
a) St. Patrick's Day
b) Groundhog Day
e) Opening day of a new session of:
1. Congress
2. The Women's Christian Temperance Union
3. The Lower Mayfield Billiard Society
11. Use letters three-sixteenth inch high in Gaelic
or Amharic on every sign. By computation there are
.'1.(121 3 students in the University for every person
here who reads Gaelic or Amharic; thus a tremen
dous increase in the parking system "take" is as-
Mired.

However, if the three-tenths of a student were
guilty ol ;j parking violation it would be only logical
to fine him (50 cents instead of the standard $2!
Seriously—ean t local drivers get a break in some
ol these less clearly marked restricted parking zones?
How about painting the curb the color of the sticker
' required to park in a jj;ivcn zone?

To the Editor:
A few days ago. an industrious graduate student
undertook, on her own initiative, a get-together of all
Massachusetts students. The work involved was
rather considerable, considering the young lady
started last November to reserve a room in the
Women's Clubhouse.
Thirty-four semi-formal announcements of the
meeting were sont. The young lady made elaborate
arrangements. There were sandwiches of several va
rieties, assorted cakes, coffee and tea for refresh
ments. There were card tables set up for bridge, etc.
The turnout was startlingly disappointing. Only
five stalwart Massachusetts students gathered f<Ti
this august evening meeting. Worse yet, the other
Massachusetts students (some from Beacon Hill and
even Back Bay), representatives of one of the most
cultured states and indisputably the center of good
breeding, violated Emily Post's rules on etiquette
straight down the line. No one has sent his regrets
for being unable to attend this meeting! And the
young lady submissively accepts her financial loss.
