# SIDELINE SLANTS
## 
### ART LEVINSON 
Last year when we were pitching Slants on a workingman's basis, there
appeared one foggy morning a column that brought blasts of hoodlumism,
lake, and jerk to this Underwood (Serial No. 568342) operator.
There's no point discussing the merits of the blasts (the truth often
hurts), but the topic that let loose the crash might be worth reconsidering
l<n no other reason than it's foggy this morning, and the number of friends
we have might decline even farther (how far minus can it go?). This
approach might be labeled parallelism.
Il stems that this writer happened to get hold of a distorted crystal
howl, and coupled with acute near-sightedness, the effects of gazing into
Madame I.a Schumka's discarded visionary hall were disastrous. What
we read in the future was a rosy prediction that Stanford would win the
basketball crown in I!) 47. Without casting disparaging remarks on Everett
Dean's present crew of hardwood performers, you can easily see the folly
of that faux pas. (Armenian for "Head for Si. Agncws, chum, you've done
cracked up.")
But like the guy who pleads not guilty at a murder charge, we'll take
the defense stand, and elucidate a little on the article that caused Smiley
Farkas to growl unprintables, and Larry Frankley to yell schmuk.
As we recall (Daily files are hopelessly confused), a starting lineup was
also included in that advance story. Dick Berlin and Dave Davidson were
named as two of the five starting men. On that score, we can claim a 100
per cent victory. But that's as far as the correct column goes.
The name of Howie Dallmar was included. The nasty professional
scouts, however, got ahold of Howie, and lured him into the paying branch
of basketball.
The oilier starter we included was the pleasant name of Jim Pollard.
At the time. Jim was planning on returning to college, hut his grades were
on the borderline (between Prohationia and Flunkotilania), so James
didn't think it was worth il all. and forget about ever wearing the Car
dinal colors again. He is now playing sensational hall for the Oakland
Billners. and leading the league in scoring.
For the sake of argument (and extending this column) let's place the
last Iwo mentioned men on the present Stanford team. Such a thing could
• nly happen in fairyland—meaning Hollywood, of course. But what a
team we'd have! Such an outfit that'd include Pollard and Dallmar would
make grey hair turn to henna red.
Needless to say. this team would win the Coast conference race. Even
il Cal's Andy Wolfe, Bill Durkee, Chuck Hanger, Jack Rocker, and Bob
Hopoboom played 25 floors above their heads, they wouldn't be able to
defeat the mythical Lcvinson Stanford basketball team.
Now that we've pleaded our case, we hope that clemency will be grant
ed. Dodging hatchets on the Quad isn't fun.

A current controversy is raging oil Stanford stomping grounds. In one
corner (in purple trunks and weighing 1(13) there are the advocates of a
new student union, and on the other side there is hollering for a new
basketball pavilion.
II Slants must lake sides—and we see no reason why not—one more
low-pitch baritone will be added to the basketball pavilion bellowing. Our
point is simply this: Stanford's present pavilion is not adequate. And since
the athletic department's billfold is like this writer's—empty—we think
memorial funds should be used for the erection of a basketball court.
Smiley Farkas and Daniel Endsley, alias S,!4t. Slinger. have clearly slated
the cause. Our routine is strictly straight stuff. Just adding the "yes sirs"
and "how right can we be."
Al least nobody is raving for statues or Mission Valley cactus. After
the last war it was the vogue to build some general mounted on a steed,
and then clutter up a park with this work of bronze. In case you acci
dentally bump into Los Angeles (you hit Los Angeles county somewhat
south of Gilroy) take a gander to Pershing Square, and you'll readily see
what we mean about statues.
Since still poses of dashing palaminos aren't the style, folks are a little
more constructive about what should be built as war memorials. Hence,
student union and basketball pavilion proposals. One of these years Ev
i rett Dean is going to have a championship basketball outfit to display,
iitul it sure would be a lot nicer if we had a plant so that 8,000 sets of eyes
might gaze upon this top-flight crew, instead of a meager 3.000.

Daily policy towards "hoss racing" is the same as it was during the
celebrated Errol Flynn trial of a few years back; strictly verboten. But
since the editorette is now dining, we're going to sneak in a few paragraphs
about the old American sport of bangtail running.
What we have to say is just a repeat on a little conversation we heard
1. 1 . t vacation between several old-time racing writers. This is the i>ist of it.
Racing is getting more crooked all the lime. Stunts like doping horses,
ami insidc-the-rail clubbing are fading out, but new tactics have been
adopted.
The favorite now is to '"pull" horses for several races so that the odds
will build up to high figures. The owner of the nag will then plunk down
several thousand on their horse, which has inflated odds. The jockey lets
up on the reins, the owner listens to the shekels roll in, and the public
has been cheated.
How this insidious crookedness is to be beaten is anybody's guess. Spot
ting won't do the trick. Maybe every jockey could be put through a lie
detector shakedown after each race. II that didn't work, they could put
ihe horses through the lie detector test.
#**>}*
We think it would he appropriate at this time if everybody would stand
and give a round of hand-clapping to the boys who put on a show be
tween halves of the basketball games. The men are Husky Hunt's unher
alded gymnasts, and the stunls they perform are strictly in the impossible
category until you have seen them put on their program.
Ted Kahn and Larry Ainsworth are just two of the gents who do push
ups with their little finger, and practically run the 100-yard dash on their
hands. Built like Charles Atlas in his prime, these men go about their
hobby with dead seriousness, knowing that their work won't shake down
headlines in the papers, but enjoying the sport for the sake of the sport
itself.
« * * *
You wouldn't believe it if you didn't read it section.
Before the calendar got around to reading 1900, meeting California
resulted in as embittered battles as pop up these days. Football was in its
embryo (haven't forgotten that word since Biol.) stage, so the main con
test of Ihe year centered around the baseball series.
As has happened a number of times, Stanford lost the series one year
to Cal. The Daily Palo Alto, mama of The Stanford Daily, was at a loss
for an explanation.
For several days, not a word was said. Then the enterprising journal
ists burst forth with a screaming headline all of a half-inch high which
I a led that the baseball loss was avenged by the defeat the Stanford debat
ers handed the Cal forensic artists! Goodie, goodie!

If any of you all don't think we need a new pavilion, just hang by the
ialters some time at the game, and see what it feels like to watch.

A current controversy is raging oil Stanford stomping grounds. In one
corner (in purple trunks and weighing 1(13) there are the advocates of a
new student union, and on the other side there is hollering for a new
basketball pavilion.
II Slants must lake sides—and we see no reason why not—one more
low-pitch baritone will be added to the basketball pavilion bellowing. Our
point is simply this: Stanford's present pavilion is not adequate. And since
the athletic department's billfold is like this writer's—empty—we think
memorial funds should be used for the erection of a basketball court.
Smiley Farkas and Daniel Endsley, alias S,!4t. Slinger. have clearly slated
the cause. Our routine is strictly straight stuff. Just adding the "yes sirs"
and "how right can we be."
Al least nobody is raving for statues or Mission Valley cactus. After
the last war it was the vogue to build some general mounted on a steed,
and then clutter up a park with this work of bronze. In case you acci
dentally bump into Los Angeles (you hit Los Angeles county somewhat
south of Gilroy) take a gander to Pershing Square, and you'll readily see
what we mean about statues.
Since still poses of dashing palaminos aren't the style, folks are a little
more constructive about what should be built as war memorials. Hence,
student union and basketball pavilion proposals. One of these years Ev
i rett Dean is going to have a championship basketball outfit to display,
iitul it sure would be a lot nicer if we had a plant so that 8,000 sets of eyes
might gaze upon this top-flight crew, instead of a meager 3.000.

Daily policy towards "hoss racing" is the same as it was during the
celebrated Errol Flynn trial of a few years back; strictly verboten. But
since the editorette is now dining, we're going to sneak in a few paragraphs
about the old American sport of bangtail running.
What we have to say is just a repeat on a little conversation we heard
1. 1 . t vacation between several old-time racing writers. This is the i>ist of it.
Racing is getting more crooked all the lime. Stunts like doping horses,
ami insidc-the-rail clubbing are fading out, but new tactics have been
adopted.
The favorite now is to '"pull" horses for several races so that the odds
will build up to high figures. The owner of the nag will then plunk down
several thousand on their horse, which has inflated odds. The jockey lets
up on the reins, the owner listens to the shekels roll in, and the public
has been cheated.
How this insidious crookedness is to be beaten is anybody's guess. Spot
ting won't do the trick. Maybe every jockey could be put through a lie
detector shakedown after each race. II that didn't work, they could put
ihe horses through the lie detector test.

We think it would he appropriate at this time if everybody would stand
and give a round of hand-clapping to the boys who put on a show be
tween halves of the basketball games. The men are Husky Hunt's unher
alded gymnasts, and the stunls they perform are strictly in the impossible
category until you have seen them put on their program.
Ted Kahn and Larry Ainsworth are just two of the gents who do push
ups with their little finger, and practically run the 100-yard dash on their
hands. Built like Charles Atlas in his prime, these men go about their
hobby with dead seriousness, knowing that their work won't shake down
headlines in the papers, but enjoying the sport for the sake of the sport
itself.

Before the calendar got around to reading 1900, meeting California
resulted in as embittered battles as pop up these days. Football was in its
embryo (haven't forgotten that word since Biol.) stage, so the main con
test of Ihe year centered around the baseball series.
As has happened a number of times, Stanford lost the series one year
to Cal. The Daily Palo Alto, mama of The Stanford Daily, was at a loss
for an explanation.
For several days, not a word was said. Then the enterprising journal
ists burst forth with a screaming headline all of a half-inch high which

If any of you all don't think we need a new pavilion, just hang by the
ialters some time at the game, and see what it feels like to watch.

Last year when we were pitching Slants on a workingman's basis, there
appeared one foggy morning a column that brought blasts of hoodlumism,
lake, and jerk to this Underwood (Serial No. 568342) operator.
There's no point discussing the merits of the blasts (the truth often
hurts), but the topic that let loose the crash might be worth reconsidering
l<n no other reason than it's foggy this morning, and the number of friends
we have might decline even farther (how far minus can it go?). This
approach might be labeled parallelism.
Il stems that this writer happened to get hold of a distorted crystal
howl, and coupled with acute near-sightedness, the effects of gazing into
Madame I.a Schumka's discarded visionary hall were disastrous. What
we read in the future was a rosy prediction that Stanford would win the
basketball crown in I!) 47. Without casting disparaging remarks on Everett
Dean's present crew of hardwood performers, you can easily see the folly
of that faux pas. (Armenian for "Head for Si. Agncws, chum, you've done
cracked up.")
But like the guy who pleads not guilty at a murder charge, we'll take
the defense stand, and elucidate a little on the article that caused Smiley
Farkas to growl unprintables, and Larry Frankley to yell schmuk.
As we recall (Daily files are hopelessly confused), a starting lineup was
also included in that advance story. Dick Berlin and Dave Davidson were
named as two of the five starting men. On that score, we can claim a 100
per cent victory. But that's as far as the correct column goes.
The name of Howie Dallmar was included. The nasty professional
scouts, however, got ahold of Howie, and lured him into the paying branch
of basketball.
The oilier starter we included was the pleasant name of Jim Pollard.
At the time. Jim was planning on returning to college, hut his grades were
on the borderline (between Prohationia and Flunkotilania), so James
didn't think it was worth il all. and forget about ever wearing the Car
dinal colors again. He is now playing sensational hall for the Oakland
Billners. and leading the league in scoring.
For the sake of argument (and extending this column) let's place the
last Iwo mentioned men on the present Stanford team. Such a thing could
• nly happen in fairyland—meaning Hollywood, of course. But what a
team we'd have! Such an outfit that'd include Pollard and Dallmar would
make grey hair turn to henna red.
Needless to say. this team would win the Coast conference race. Even

Racing is getting more crooked all the lime. Stunts like doping horses,
ami insidc-the-rail clubbing are fading out, but new tactics have been
adopted.
The favorite now is to '"pull" horses for several races so that the odds
will build up to high figures. The owner of the nag will then plunk down
several thousand on their horse, which has inflated odds. The jockey lets
up on the reins, the owner listens to the shekels roll in, and the public
has been cheated.
How this insidious crookedness is to be beaten is anybody's guess. Spot
ting won't do the trick. Maybe every jockey could be put through a lie
detector shakedown after each race. II that didn't work, they could put
ihe horses through the lie detector test.

We think it would he appropriate at this time if everybody would stand
and give a round of hand-clapping to the boys who put on a show be
tween halves of the basketball games. The men are Husky Hunt's unher
alded gymnasts, and the stunls they perform are strictly in the impossible
category until you have seen them put on their program.
Ted Kahn and Larry Ainsworth are just two of the gents who do push
ups with their little finger, and practically run the 100-yard dash on their
hands. Built like Charles Atlas in his prime, these men go about their
hobby with dead seriousness, knowing that their work won't shake down
headlines in the papers, but enjoying the sport for the sake of the sport
itself.

Before the calendar got around to reading 1900, meeting California
resulted in as embittered battles as pop up these days. Football was in its
embryo (haven't forgotten that word since Biol.) stage, so the main con
test of Ihe year centered around the baseball series.
As has happened a number of times, Stanford lost the series one year
to Cal. The Daily Palo Alto, mama of The Stanford Daily, was at a loss
for an explanation.
For several days, not a word was said. Then the enterprising journal
ists burst forth with a screaming headline all of a half-inch high which
I a led that the baseball loss was avenged by the defeat the Stanford debat
ers handed the Cal forensic artists! Goodie, goodie!

If any of you all don't think we need a new pavilion, just hang by the
ialters some time at the game, and see what it feels like to watch.

Last year when we were pitching Slants on a workingman's basis, there
appeared one foggy morning a column that brought blasts of hoodlumism,
lake, and jerk to this Underwood (Serial No. 568342) operator.
There's no point discussing the merits of the blasts (the truth often
hurts), but the topic that let loose the crash might be worth reconsidering
l<n no other reason than it's foggy this morning, and the number of friends
we have might decline even farther (how far minus can it go?). This
approach might be labeled parallelism.
Il stems that this writer happened to get hold of a distorted crystal
howl, and coupled with acute near-sightedness, the effects of gazing into
Madame I.a Schumka's discarded visionary hall were disastrous. What
we read in the future was a rosy prediction that Stanford would win the
basketball crown in I!) 47. Without casting disparaging remarks on Everett
Dean's present crew of hardwood performers, you can easily see the folly
of that faux pas. (Armenian for "Head for Si. Agncws, chum, you've done
cracked up.")
But like the guy who pleads not guilty at a murder charge, we'll take
the defense stand, and elucidate a little on the article that caused Smiley
Farkas to growl unprintables, and Larry Frankley to yell schmuk.
As we recall (Daily files are hopelessly confused), a starting lineup was
also included in that advance story. Dick Berlin and Dave Davidson were
named as two of the five starting men. On that score, we can claim a 100
per cent victory. But that's as far as the correct column goes.
The name of Howie Dallmar was included. The nasty professional
scouts, however, got ahold of Howie, and lured him into the paying branch
of basketball.
The oilier starter we included was the pleasant name of Jim Pollard.
At the time. Jim was planning on returning to college, hut his grades were
on the borderline (between Prohationia and Flunkotilania), so James
didn't think it was worth il all. and forget about ever wearing the Car
dinal colors again. He is now playing sensational hall for the Oakland
Billners. and leading the league in scoring.
For the sake of argument (and extending this column) let's place the
last Iwo mentioned men on the present Stanford team. Such a thing could
• nly happen in fairyland—meaning Hollywood, of course. But what a
team we'd have! Such an outfit that'd include Pollard and Dallmar would
make grey hair turn to henna red.
Needless to say. this team would win the Coast conference race. Even
il Cal's Andy Wolfe, Bill Durkee, Chuck Hanger, Jack Rocker, and Bob
Hopoboom played 25 floors above their heads, they wouldn't be able to
defeat the mythical Lcvinson Stanford basketball team.
Now that we've pleaded our case, we hope that clemency will be grant
ed. Dodging hatchets on the Quad isn't fun.

A current controversy is raging oil Stanford stomping grounds. In one
corner (in purple trunks and weighing 1(13) there are the advocates of a
new student union, and on the other side there is hollering for a new
basketball pavilion.
II Slants must lake sides—and we see no reason why not—one more
low-pitch baritone will be added to the basketball pavilion bellowing. Our
point is simply this: Stanford's present pavilion is not adequate. And since
the athletic department's billfold is like this writer's—empty—we think
memorial funds should be used for the erection of a basketball court.
Smiley Farkas and Daniel Endsley, alias S,!4t. Slinger. have clearly slated
the cause. Our routine is strictly straight stuff. Just adding the "yes sirs"
and "how right can we be."
Al least nobody is raving for statues or Mission Valley cactus. After
the last war it was the vogue to build some general mounted on a steed,
and then clutter up a park with this work of bronze. In case you acci
dentally bump into Los Angeles (you hit Los Angeles county somewhat
south of Gilroy) take a gander to Pershing Square, and you'll readily see
what we mean about statues.
Since still poses of dashing palaminos aren't the style, folks are a little
more constructive about what should be built as war memorials. Hence,
student union and basketball pavilion proposals. One of these years Ev
i rett Dean is going to have a championship basketball outfit to display,
iitul it sure would be a lot nicer if we had a plant so that 8,000 sets of eyes
might gaze upon this top-flight crew, instead of a meager 3.000.

Last year when we were pitching Slants on a workingman's basis, there
appeared one foggy morning a column that brought blasts of hoodlumism,
lake, and jerk to this Underwood (Serial No. 568342) operator.
There's no point discussing the merits of the blasts (the truth often
hurts), but the topic that let loose the crash might be worth reconsidering
l<n no other reason than it's foggy this morning, and the number of friends
we have might decline even farther (how far minus can it go?). This
approach might be labeled parallelism.
Il stems that this writer happened to get hold of a distorted crystal
howl, and coupled with acute near-sightedness, the effects of gazing into
Madame I.a Schumka's discarded visionary hall were disastrous. What
we read in the future was a rosy prediction that Stanford would win the
basketball crown in I!) 47. Without casting disparaging remarks on Everett
Dean's present crew of hardwood performers, you can easily see the folly
of that faux pas. (Armenian for "Head for Si. Agncws, chum, you've done
cracked up.")
But like the guy who pleads not guilty at a murder charge, we'll take
the defense stand, and elucidate a little on the article that caused Smiley
Farkas to growl unprintables, and Larry Frankley to yell schmuk.
As we recall (Daily files are hopelessly confused), a starting lineup was
also included in that advance story. Dick Berlin and Dave Davidson were
named as two of the five starting men. On that score, we can claim a 100
per cent victory. But that's as far as the correct column goes.
The name of Howie Dallmar was included. The nasty professional
scouts, however, got ahold of Howie, and lured him into the paying branch
of basketball.
The oilier starter we included was the pleasant name of Jim Pollard.
At the time. Jim was planning on returning to college, hut his grades were
on the borderline (between Prohationia and Flunkotilania), so James
didn't think it was worth il all. and forget about ever wearing the Car
dinal colors again. He is now playing sensational hall for the Oakland
Billners. and leading the league in scoring.
For the sake of argument (and extending this column) let's place the
last Iwo mentioned men on the present Stanford team. Such a thing could
• nly happen in fairyland—meaning Hollywood, of course. But what a
team we'd have! Such an outfit that'd include Pollard and Dallmar would
make grey hair turn to henna red.
Needless to say. this team would win the Coast conference race. Even
il Cal's Andy Wolfe, Bill Durkee, Chuck Hanger, Jack Rocker, and Bob
Hopoboom played 25 floors above their heads, they wouldn't be able to
defeat the mythical Lcvinson Stanford basketball team.
Now that we've pleaded our case, we hope that clemency will be grant
ed. Dodging hatchets on the Quad isn't fun.

A current controversy is raging oil Stanford stomping grounds. In one
corner (in purple trunks and weighing 1(13) there are the advocates of a
new student union, and on the other side there is hollering for a new
basketball pavilion.
II Slants must lake sides—and we see no reason why not—one more
low-pitch baritone will be added to the basketball pavilion bellowing. Our
point is simply this: Stanford's present pavilion is not adequate. And since
the athletic department's billfold is like this writer's—empty—we think
memorial funds should be used for the erection of a basketball court.
Smiley Farkas and Daniel Endsley, alias S,!4t. Slinger. have clearly slated
the cause. Our routine is strictly straight stuff. Just adding the "yes sirs"
and "how right can we be."
Al least nobody is raving for statues or Mission Valley cactus. After
the last war it was the vogue to build some general mounted on a steed,
and then clutter up a park with this work of bronze. In case you acci
dentally bump into Los Angeles (you hit Los Angeles county somewhat
south of Gilroy) take a gander to Pershing Square, and you'll readily see
what we mean about statues.
Since still poses of dashing palaminos aren't the style, folks are a little
more constructive about what should be built as war memorials. Hence,
student union and basketball pavilion proposals. One of these years Ev
i rett Dean is going to have a championship basketball outfit to display,
iitul it sure would be a lot nicer if we had a plant so that 8,000 sets of eyes
might gaze upon this top-flight crew, instead of a meager 3.000.

Daily policy towards "hoss racing" is the same as it was during the
celebrated Errol Flynn trial of a few years back; strictly verboten. But
since the editorette is now dining, we're going to sneak in a few paragraphs
about the old American sport of bangtail running.
What we have to say is just a repeat on a little conversation we heard
1. 1 . t vacation between several old-time racing writers. This is the i>ist of it.
Racing is getting more crooked all the lime. Stunts like doping horses,
ami insidc-the-rail clubbing are fading out, but new tactics have been
adopted.
The favorite now is to '"pull" horses for several races so that the odds
will build up to high figures. The owner of the nag will then plunk down
several thousand on their horse, which has inflated odds. The jockey lets
up on the reins, the owner listens to the shekels roll in, and the public
has been cheated.
How this insidious crookedness is to be beaten is anybody's guess. Spot
ting won't do the trick. Maybe every jockey could be put through a lie
detector shakedown after each race. II that didn't work, they could put
ihe horses through the lie detector test.

We think it would he appropriate at this time if everybody would stand
and give a round of hand-clapping to the boys who put on a show be
tween halves of the basketball games. The men are Husky Hunt's unher
alded gymnasts, and the stunls they perform are strictly in the impossible
category until you have seen them put on their program.
Ted Kahn and Larry Ainsworth are just two of the gents who do push
ups with their little finger, and practically run the 100-yard dash on their
hands. Built like Charles Atlas in his prime, these men go about their
hobby with dead seriousness, knowing that their work won't shake down
headlines in the papers, but enjoying the sport for the sake of the sport
itself.

You wouldn't believe it if you didn't read it section.
Before the calendar got around to reading 1900, meeting California
resulted in as embittered battles as pop up these days. Football was in its
embryo (haven't forgotten that word since Biol.) stage, so the main con
test of Ihe year centered around the baseball series.
As has happened a number of times, Stanford lost the series one year
to Cal. The Daily Palo Alto, mama of The Stanford Daily, was at a loss
for an explanation.
For several days, not a word was said. Then the enterprising journal
ists burst forth with a screaming headline all of a half-inch high which
I a led that the baseball loss was avenged by the defeat the Stanford debat
ers handed the Cal forensic artists! Goodie, goodie!
