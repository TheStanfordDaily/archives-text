# Dons and Broncs Will Show Speed
## 
### ART SHAPIRO 
Two of the fastest basketball squads on the West Coast will
be setting up their teepees in the Pavilion come Friday and Sat
urday evening. The Dons of U.S.F. move in Friday to tackle the
Deanmen in a game which looks like a natural. It will be inex
perience versus inexperience when the Green and Gold moves
against the Cardinal.

YOUTH TAKES A HOLIDAY
With three freshmen and two
sophomores on the U.S.F. lineup
and almost the same proportion on
the Indian starting five, this contest
: pits the two youngest squads on
J the coast together, if not throughout
the country.
Both teams have at times shown
great promise and at other in
stants disappointed their follow
ers. U.S.F. will come into the
game with a 10-10 record. After
getting away to a slow start the
Dons made a fine showing on the
road a* they dumped the Univer
sity of Utah, Colorado, Brigliam
Young, California and St. Mary's.
In the past few weeks the squad
has begun to demonstrate weak
nesses as they dropped two con
tests to San Jose State, and one
apiece to the Borlo A.C. and St.
Mary's.
Ross Guidici and Abe Rodriguez
; are the number one and two men
!in the U.S.F. attack. They hold
! down the forward positions and are
I extremely fast when a fast-break
ing play is being used. The Fulton
Street boys play a set offense, spic
ing the mixture with a fast break
occasionally. The quintet works the
ball around and tries to capitalize
on the cleverness and ability of the
two forwards.
The squad itself is short. Only
one man can be considered as tall.
Jack McNamee, the center, tops 6
feet 4, but the rest of the team is
|at the 6-foot mark or under. Bill
I Gibson and Jack Hanley hold down
the guard slots and are capable ball
handlers and defensive players, but
not scoring threats.
GAME OF THE WEEK
The game of the week on the
coast will be played Saturday
night in the Pavilion as the Broncs
of Santa Clara cross horns with
the Ked Machine. The finest rec
ord in the region will be at stake
when the charges of Ray Pasco
go after their eighteenth win out
of nineteen starts. Having al
ready trounced the three other
conference squads, the Broncos
will be spoiling to make it a clean
sweep.
The starting five for the Santa
Clarans average two and a half
years' experience per man, as com
pared with the team total of one
; year for the Stanford hoopsters. The
only advantage the Indians will en
; joy will be in the height department.
Santa Clara's starting quintet is the
shortest squad that the Cards have
faced all season. The home boys
will have a three-inch advantage and
| will be forced to use that factor in
j order to stem the speed and gen
; eral suaveness of attack the Red and
White will undoubtedly attempt to
spring on them.
Boasting of the finest fast break
in the region and utilizing a steary
man-to-man defense, the visitors
will be just the right sort of foil
for the Indians to test their game
agrainst. in preparation for the
two league tilts against U.S.C. the
following weekend.
The Stanford varsity has been
working out daily and will be at a
i physical and mental peak for these
I two contests. The same starting five
will go to the line for the Cards as
! have been, during the past two
weeks of play: Morley Thompson
and Dave Davidson at forward;
Steve Stephenson at center; and
Babe Higgins and Dick Berlin at
the guard slots.
