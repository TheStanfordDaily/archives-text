# Cardinal Crew Has Choppy 43-Year Story
## 
### 
Stanford's crew, this season stag
ing its third attempted comeback,
can look back upon a unique his
tory. During the 4;? years since in
ception, the Farm oarsmen have en
countered one obstacle alter another,
without aid from the university it
self.
First organized in MMI 4, by 1908
the crew had earned recognition
as a major sport. The next year,
a Stanford shell coppcd the Pacific
Coast championship for the first
time. In 1915, Indian oarsmen
placed second in the National
Championships at Poughkcepsie,
N. V. J his great crew was the first
aggregation to carry Stanford's
athletic fame hack Fast, and the
first to prove that West Coast oars
men were to he regarded as seri
ous contenders for national honors.
A year later, when the nation en
tered World War 1. it was neces
sary to give up the sport.
The first comeback was staged in
1919, when once again red-tipped
oars graced the Bay's choppy waters.
Because of a lack of funds, the sport
was discontinued after one season.
Largely through alumni support,
in 1940 the sport was revived for a
second time. Once again war in
tervened. and a newly constructed
(by the labor and capital of crew
members) boathouse was locked
uv for four long years.
The first two comebacks were un
successful, but possibly this third
attempt will cany the charm. The
present turnout of sixty men is a
good indication. The spring sched
ule includes races against Washing
ton, California, UCLA. Oregon State,
and the University of British Co
lumbia. Also, entrance in this year's
National Championships is quite
posssible. The Poughkeepsie Regatta
Association has a good memory
(certainly a better one than that of
the SAC); each year it sends an in
vitation to Stanford to row in its
world famous race.
