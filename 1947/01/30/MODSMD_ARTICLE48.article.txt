# Top Pro Gridder Offers New Plan

### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 29 (UP).â€”
Glenn Dobbs, Brooklyn Dodger ace
back, was named the All-America
Football Conference's most valuable
player today as the organization
considered a revolutionary plan to
strengthen weaker clubs by taking
players from dominating teams.
Still seeking a commissioner to
succeed Jimmy Crowley, who re
signed to become owner-coach of
the Chicago Rockets, the conference
also:
1. Disclosed the commissioner
field had narrowed to three, be
lieved to be Lou Little, Columbia
coach; Tom Hamilton. Navy coach,
and Maj. Gen. Leslie Groves, atom
bomb expert.
2. Revealed early and long-term
signing of players to prevent pos
sible raiding by the rival National
Football League.
3. Decided against minor league
connections.
4. Voted 7 to 1 against the ''sud
den death" playoff in regular sea
son ties, and handled other rou
tine matters.
Dobbs, former Tulsa star who was
the sparkplug of the Dodgers, was
named most valuable by the
coaches. They were not permitted to
name anyone from their own team,
so Dobbs was a practically unani
mous choice, Brooklyn's coach vot
ing for Cleveland's Otto Graham.
