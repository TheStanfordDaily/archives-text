## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 29 (UP).—
The Senate transportation commit
tee tonight laid before the Senate
bills to cost motorists two cents
more on each gallon of gasoline,
$1.50 a year for the privilege of
driving in California and $3 more
a year to own a car.
The program would make the to
tal gas tax five cents a gallon and
Ihe total vehicle registration fee $6.
Governor Warren submitted his
1947 budget to Ihe Legislature to
day. It will call for the expendi
ture of $041,599,026 during the com
ing fiscal year—the largest outlay of
money for any single year in the
history of the state.
The budget calls for an expendi
ture $1515,000,000 greater than that
spent during the current fiscal year,
but the Governor said it will still
leave a $5)0,000,000 surplus on June
30, 1948, under present revenue es
timates.
Warren said California will end
the current fiscal year this June 30
with a $318,567,265 surplus—unprec
edented in the state's history. But
appropriations made but not spent
and formal and informal commit
ments against this total will rcduce
it to $89,000,000.
The Governor said $75,000,000 of
this surplus should be "immediately
earmarked as a revenue deficiency
reserve," which he has called a
"rainy day special fund."
