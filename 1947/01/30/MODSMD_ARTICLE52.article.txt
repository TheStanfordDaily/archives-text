# French Club Gives Practical Training
## 
### LISA HOEMANN 
Acquiring fluency in a language
for language ability has a potential
value in strengthening the bonds of
international understanding.
Much of the confusion and mis
interpretation regarding foreign
countries is due to a lack of an
adequate comprehension of a na
tion's ideals, customs and prob
lems; a knowledge of the foreign
tongue may aid in relieving this
condition through its social utility.
Stanford's newly formed French
Conversational Club places empha
sis on this social aspect.
Student and faculty attendance at
the first two meetings of the stu
dent - managed organization has
shown a definite interest in learn
ing and improving spoken French.
Since the meetings are conducted
entirely in French, they offer a fine
opportunity for actual thinking in
the language. Thus beginners may
more easily lose their usual hesi
tancy in conversation.
The group plans to send a
monthly package of food and one
of clothing to either a French
child or a student, with whom a
correspondence will he conducted.

This serves as an introduction to
personal association and a knowl
edge of the people themselvesâ€”
the hasis for true international
understanding and world peace.
Presentation of French motion
pictures open to the public is being
planned. Community sings, French
record programs, guest speakers
and general discussions concerning
the political, economic and social
problems of France are to be in
cluded in meetings. Much progress
in conversation is anticipated since
meetings take place every Tuesday
afternoon.
The French Club has the poten
tiality of becoming a valuable part
of the I.S.C. program. All students
and faculty members interested in
furthering relations between France
and America are urged to join.
