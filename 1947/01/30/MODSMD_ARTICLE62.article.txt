## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 29 (UP).- I
Aroused by official reports of fraud j
and terrorism in the recent Polish j
elections, Sen. Arthur H. Vanden
berg, R., Mich., demanded today |
that the United States go beyond i
writing notes of protest and take
more positive action to restore free
government in Poland.
He endorsed fully the State De- j
partment's bitter condemnation of â– 
the election, but asserted that the I
mere sending of protests was not '
enough.
"There must be a more convinc- j
ing act," he said, but he did not |
elaborate.
