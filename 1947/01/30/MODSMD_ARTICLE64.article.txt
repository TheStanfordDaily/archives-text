# Children Able to Walk Again After Farm Therapists Aid
## 
### 
Children who might never walk
| again—stricken with infantile pa
ralysis—are getting a new chance at
life from treatment by physical
therapists whose skill is restoring
j strength in withered arms and legs.
Stanford's school of physical ther
apy graduates 40 to 50 skilled
therapists a year, and will step up
j its program to 75 to 100 yearly grad
j uates under a grant received from
the National Foundation for Infan
| tile Paralysis, financed by the an
! nual March of Dimes drive, which
! will contribute $30,000 annually to
I the school for a five-year period.
Known technically as the Divi
; sion of Physical Therapy, it consists
| of a school and clinic under the
! School of Education, located at the
J Stanford Village. The school has a
| three-fold purpose:
1. It trains physical therapists
for service in general hospitals,
public health service work, vet
erans' hospitals, and crippled
children's institutions.
2. It serves as a teaching clinic

where physical therapy is avail
able (o anyone on a doctor's pre
scription. particularly to those un
able to pay for private treatment.
3. It stands ready as a Polio
Epidemic Aid Unit to send trained
workers anywhere on the Pacific
Coast where an infantile paralysis
outbreak gets out of control.
Forty to 50 patients pass through
the clinic each quarter, receiving an
average of 1,000 treatments in the
three-month period.
At present the school has 54 stu
dents, the majority of them women.
It gives an A.B. degree and a Mas
ter's degree, and its curriculum pro
vides a minor for a Ph.D. degree.
The Stanford school, established
in 1940, is the only one set up to
function as a Polio Epidemic Aid
Unit. There are only three such
units in the United States. The other
two are at Northwestern University
and at Harvard.
