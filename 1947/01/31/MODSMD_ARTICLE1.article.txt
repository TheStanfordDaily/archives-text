DETROIT, Jan. 30. — (UP) —
The National Association of
Manufacturers today asked fed
eral courts to rule out all portal
to-portal pay claims prior to
June 10, 1946.
At the same time, tlie Congress of
Industrial Organizations accused the
government of attempting to clamp
"slave standards" on American
workers by bucking their $5,000,-
000,000 portal pay suits.
Justice Department attorneys
railed for outright dismissal of the
historic Mt. Clemens, Mich., Pot
tery Co. case, regarded as a test
for the hundreds of similar hack
pay suits filed across the country.
These developments came as Fed
eral District Judge Frank A. Picard
opened a hearing on the Mt. Clem
ens case. Backed by a U.S. Supreme
Court decision sanctioning portal
pay for I lie pottery workers, he was
attempting to fix the exact amount
of their compensation.
Most concrete development of a
day-long wrangle among attorneys
representing the government, la
bor and industry came from Har
vey M. Crow, associate counsel for
the NAM.
Crow asked Picard to rule in the
Mt. Clemens case that no portal
claims should be considered prior to
June 10, 194(5, the date of the Su
preme Court ruling.
Hut he extended his request to
industry at large by declaring that
"companies up to that time had
followed all laws then in effect and
thus should not he held liable to
portal pay before the Supreme
Court ruling."
