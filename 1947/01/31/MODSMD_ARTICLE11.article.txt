## 
### 
The story of Vienna from the period of the Hapsburg empire
down to the present era of postwar zones was traced yesterday ;
afternoon by Dr. Paul Dengler at Cubberley Auditorium.
Dr. Dengler looked at the city through the eyes of a statue
of Goethe located in the heart of Vienna.

â™¦GLORIOUS DAYS
He described the glorious days of
! the empire when even the poorest
, were happy. The biggest ceremony
of the old Austria was the sixtieth
: anniversary of Emperor Franz Jo-
I soph.
As an army officer in (he first
World War, Dengler, like his fel
lows in arms, returned to a chang
ed city. 'I he first decade follow
ing the war was one of socializa-
I lion.
Vienna was known throughout the
| continent as the city of modern
dwellings and revolutionary social
laws. Bui then came the influence
of fascism.
ITALIANS AND NAZIS
Under first Italian influence and
later Nazi domination, the democ
racy gradually disappeared. Chan-
I cellor Dollfuss was described by Dr.
j Dengler as the pocket dictator or
, the midget Metternich.
Upon the assassination of Doll
fuss, Kurt Schussnigg took over.
Four years later Hitler inarched
! in. Although the Austrians lirst
looked with favor toward the Ger
; mans, their minds soon cliangcd
| when the elements of Naziism
[ which had once seemed humorous
J continued to dominate.
Dr. Dengler, like other Austrians,
[ whs refused permission to go abroad.
Ho thus missed a committment to
teach during the summer of 11K58 at
, the University of California.
Dr. Dengler told his audience of
j how his son was condemned to death
j for illegally listening to Allied
j broadcasts and then telling his
J friends of the news. After sixteen
j months in a concentration camp,
| young Dengler was saved when the
j Allies marched into Vienna.
RUSSIANS
Dr. Dengler told of the Russians
j entering the city. He said, "1 have
i had no bad experiences with, the
I Russians at all."
At present the Austrians, the
Viennese educator says, are look
ing forward to again running their
own government. lie described
Mark Clark as a fine, sincere
friend of the Austrian people.
Dr. Dengler ended his speech with
the statement that "the more people
who arc happy the world over, the
more benefit will be derived by the
! United States." He stated that, all
Americans should take an active in
terest. in European affairs.
Dr. Dengler is at present en route
to Hawaii where he is to teach for
. six months. He said that he "was
glad to be 011 the 'beautiful West
j Coast again." He described landing
| in New York after his long years in
. Nazi-dominated, war-torn Europe
j as like entering a fairyland.
