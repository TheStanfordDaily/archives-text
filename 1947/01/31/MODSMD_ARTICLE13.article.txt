# 'Royal Family' "Awfully Good'
## 
### 
Sparkling with George Kaufman's
l wit. and paced by the always excel
j lent direction of F. Cowles Strick
j land, last night's Stanford Players'
! revival of "The Royal Family" prov
j ed that the theatre itself is an aw
j fully good show.
The stoiy of a Broadway royal
I family had plenty of good perform -
I ances and laughs as it traced the
j struggle of the famed Cavendish
I clan to live both private and stage
lives.
Outstanding performances were
given by Marcia Wilson, a recent
return to the Stanford Players as
Julie Cavendish, Ruth Fisher as
Fanny Cavendish and Newton Ar
; nold as the eccentric Tony Caven
i dish.
i Miss Fisher's portrayal of the aged
! matriarch of the Cavendishes fast
I losing her grip on the stage, but still
| determined to go out and tour the
road was excellent, full of sympathy
and slowly dying fire.
Marcia Wilson as Julie proved
once again her mastery of the
stage, and gave feeling and depth
to her role as a glamorous, but
unloved star.
Newton Arnold was an exceed
ingly funny Tony, a part which
; seemed built for his talents, and his
entrance always brought .fresh
! laughs to the first-night audience.
Able supporting performances
were turned in by Nancy DeGroot
as Gwcn, the young daughter who
wanted marriage before a career,
Ray Poole as Herbert Dean, a bro
ken down has-been, Douglas Rus
sell as Oscar Wolfe, a famous
Broadway producer, and Mary
| Cogswell as Kitty Dean, the fea
ther-brained wife of Herbert
Dean.
j Staging and setting were excel
j lent, and the chief defects were in
the script itself. At some places in
; the first and third acts action seem-.
. ed to drag, but not through any fault
j of the players.
The large living room set. was well
j constructed to handle the up-and
i downstairs runs of Mr. Arnold and
! the slower, quieter sessions of the
; various lovers, and the old lady's
death which by the way seemed to
this reviewer as an unnecessary pro
longing of the play. But that's Mr.
Kaufman's fault, not Mr. Striek
-1 land's.â€”Heintze.
