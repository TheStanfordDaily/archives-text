# Dean Stalnaker Declares Students Interfere With Administration
## 
### 
Answering questions about the administration posed by Wo
men's Conference yesterday Dean of Students John Stalnaker
counter-attacked with issues of his own concerning student af
fairs and management.
He discussed the organization, the breakdown of enrollment,
and the financial picture of the university at the meeting yester
day afternoon at the Women's Clubhouse.

► Stressing that all student rights
i and powers are delegated to the stu
dents by the Board of Trustees, and
that, those rights may be withdrawn
if they are abused. Dean Stalnaker
presented the organizational set up
!of Stanford. The Board of Trustees
is a self-perpetuating body which
has the final authority and also as
sumes considerable liability, and
very broadly speaking, owns the
university. The president is prima
rily responsible for the enforcement,
j of discipline according to the organ
izational statutes and serves as an
intermediary between the student.!
| and the Board.
j "I get just a little annoyed," de
clared the Dean, "at minor student
groups who propose to make dras
tic changes in the university." lie
went on to say that students tend
to overstep the area of student nc-
I tivity and get involved in matters
not of student concern.
Breaking down the enrollment fig
ures. the speaker pointed out that
there are 3.848 registered cars on
campus, an amount nearly equal to
the total enrollment, at. one time.
Two hundred and eighty cars were
registered this quarter. Seventy per
cent of the women are housed on
campus, while only fifty per cent of
the men live in Stanford residences.
The postwar influx has brought a
total of 1,600 married people.
Explaining generally the finan
cial state of the university, Dean
Stalnaker reported a total income
last year of $4,600,000 with a total
expenditure of $4,.'M>:»,000. For in
struction and departmental re
search $2,250,000 was expended.
He also pointed out that an in
crease in enrollment was not a
good thing financially because the
endowments are fixed and the cosl.
goes up more than the amount
| brought in by the additional fees.
Numerous questions were pre
i sented, the first concerning the
number of professors who are
j leaving Stanford. In answering,
| Mr. Stalnaker pointed out the
turnover here is to be expected in
! a period where there is maximum
movement of instructors from col
lege to college, and that the uni
versity has added to its teachiiu;
staff many outstanding men.
A current question regarding the
I installation of pay phones in living
j groups was answered by the state
j ment that it is illegal to uso the
! phones now in the halls for outgoing
; calls, and that the placement, of pay
j phones is a fulfillment of a legal
: requirement.
Improvement of the library
j lights is dependent upon the no
j quisition of material and labor.
And actually the "lights have been
i that way for some time."
Counter-attacking with issues of
his own. Dean Stalnaker posed the
| following questions:
Does the Daily represent the news
fairly? Is it the kind of a newspaper
you want it to be? What are you
doing about it?
Is the Honor Code effective?
Is Exeom representative of student.
| government? Why is there such
J lethargy in that government?
What is your opinion of the
elections?
Is Iho conduct at the fireside;;
j what it should be, and what you
want it to be?
Was the Gaieties something th.>l
j you wanted to represent Slan
| ford?
Is the Chaparral satisfactory !o
j you?
What are the study conditions
I in the living groups? Why is (here,
more noise than ever before?
Dean Stalnaker expressed the
; hope that students would answei
these questions for him later.
