## Closed Door for Athletes? 
### 
Is the Administration maintaining a "closed
door" policy on top-notch athletes? If one can
judge by the anguished cries of some Bay
Area sports columnists and aumni, Stanford
is fast becoming the "Chicago of the West"
due to non-acceptance of many athletes de
siring to enter the portals of the Farm.
That many excellent athletes have been
turned away is an unquestioned fact. Who is
most hurt by their non-acceptance? The
answer is obvious the major sport coaches.
A.id that is where silence on the subject is
<.'■;.;tening.
Opinions ot the coaches weie perhaps best
•r. pressed during the Christmas trip to
ii sn-Julu ot the footb .11 team. There, leted by
nthusiastic and cuiious alumni and fai from
Iho administrative thumb, a,any leit that when
Schwartz lose to speak he would give
v.'iit to his long-suffering ieelmgs of disap
pointment ovei the fact that several dozen
"Harris" athletes have been turned away in
l!i». past six months.
Instead, Marchie went directly to the point
that he did not want to hear any complaints
J Administration non cooperation. That, as far
is he was concerned, he did not want enhance
standards lowered in any respect and that he
did not want to take in any athlete v/ho could
sot hold his own in Stanford's scholdstic
com petition.
Nevertheless, when winter quartet began
Mid more big names came and went, talk be
es: i again. This time, it was a sports columnist
v/ho opened the barrage and based his story,
\/j believe, either on hearsay information or
the disappointed utterings of the men con
cerned. In this and other cases, the Admin
istration can only stand and be silent. For
entrance papers given them are confidential
and must be treated as such. The University
cannot break the confidences of those seeking
admission without damage to themselves and
ernbairassment to the individual.

But the talk will go on. One standout all
around athlete was cited as having completed
"with an A-minus average a tough business
administration course" in a southern junior
college. The "tough business administration
course" consisted of training in the operation
of business machines, comptometers, et al;
hardly the background to prepare one for the
intricacies of Econ 1 and 2.
If anyone is at fault, it is you, Mr. and Miss
Stanford Student. It's your high averages that
keep the Entrance Committee from letting in
those who they feel will be unable to stay in
Stanford in the face of strong competition. An
athlete contributes nothing if he is on proba
tion and can't compete.
It's not grades nlone that let one inside the
gate. There is a certain general academic
formula to separate the acceptables from the
definitely non-acceptables and the maybe's.
Borderline cases are all decided individually
on past performances, expectations for the fu
ture based on factors that may have impeded
past performance, and contributions the in
dividual can make to the school. In the latter,
athletic ability is definitely not overlooked.
The Administration wants to cheer a winning
football team next year and the year after
just as much as we do. Even more so, be
cause a winning football team means moie
money in the till and enhanced reputation
But athletes must go to school too and make
good.
We have no confidence that this bit of writ
ing will put an end to discussion of admin
istrative non-cooperation. But remember,
when the Administration turns down Joe Hot
cha, the red-hot halfback from Spearfish Jun
ior College, their reasons will be pretty good.
And if there is criticism of the action with no
reply from the University, the silence is to
protect the reputation of Mr. Hotcha and not
Stanford.—F.B.
