# BULL SESSION

### GEORGE VELLIOTES 
'I lie vicissitudes of fortune which smite the aver
.'i columnist when lie sits clown to write a Bull
Session are almost catastrophic, but the writer al
ways keeps grinning and persevering. Yes, my in
domitable freshman spirit ('ray for the class of '50)
i:-. I he reason why this Session exists today, even
l hough I did have to resort to my own blood to put
down the original copy of the story of the immense
I ask of finishing this column for today.
'I he exnlanation should begin, of course, with the
usual preliminaries. I usually start by seating my
' ll at my desk, making a clean sweep of everything
dial is before me, therefore knocking the raisins and
almonds on the floor which I keep handy for munch
ing the raisins and almonds, not the floor. Then I
I nice myself to breathe for a while. It seems to help
me. I grin and drive mVself onward.
The next big step arrives. I start racking my
brain lor an inspiration. When it is slow in arriv
ing, I will beat my head in desperation on the top of
my desk. Alter the Encina carpenters fill in the
deep dents, I have them do something for the desk,
too. I am now ready to compose.
Now start the usual, unpreventable room inter
rupt ions. I have toughened my very being and fiber
in an endeavor to pay not the slightest attention to
l hem. I just keep grinning and pretend they do not
happen when the guys come in to borrow my room
male's soldering iron; when they come in asking for
otu room's particular turtle mash formula; when they
drop in to admire, gawk, or shudder at a whole wall
ol my own mounted bizarre and individualistic etch
ings. (Honest, etchings.) When the connoisseurs ob
serve, "Not much like Norman Rockwell, is he?"
I just—keep—grinning.
The next tremendous advance in the evolution of
the column is the inevitable moment when nay per
petually guaranteed _ fountain pen breaks down,
E ; I lowering the desk. 1 then am able to observe that
the pen .not only writes under water but makes a

brave attempt lo do so under ink. Sponging up the
squid's body fluid, 1 maintain my indefatigable, happy
grin.
1 now have to resort to typing my first draft, but
soon my Smith-Corona, which is a brand-new "si
lent portable that can be heard all over the second
floor, gets temperamental. It merely burps when I
hit the immovable keys. . I lift the lid, stick my head
close to the inner mechanisms to investigate the
trouble, finger the ribbon feed, and then—suddenly—
zip! The whole ribbon has shot out and lassoes my
head and neck. I grin feverishly as I try to shake
it off. "I must maintain a healthy attitude," I tell
myself as I am slowly choking to death.
Someone knocks vigorously at the door. I hasten
to disentangle myself, managing to loosen most of
the ribbon which now slips down around my ankle.
Stoically I drag the 50-pound typewriter after me
across the floor, and I open the door. A sharp object
is nearly thrust into my eye. "Here's your soldering
iron!"
I jab my veins and let my blood flow over the
faces of the keys since I am without a ribbon, and
I resume my efforts. I—just—keep—sigh—grinning.
After typing for three minutes without interruption,
I see no reason for retaining my grin, so I try to
lose it.
I cannot do it.
When my roommates walk in shortly, they find me
terrifiedly slapping my face against the wall, trying
to beat it not into a plowshare but some semblance
of its original expression; the grin is still on it. Be
ing quick of mind—and I being short of space—they
quickly grasp the situation and decide that I have
the third case of lockjaw induced by Encina food
this quarter. They go out for reinforcements, and
soon the whole wing swarms into my room, offering
sympathetic aid and suggestions as to how to pry
open my mouth and straighten my expression to
normal or a facsimile thereof. Suggestions range
from crowbars to drilling. I—just—keep—on —
GRINNING!
