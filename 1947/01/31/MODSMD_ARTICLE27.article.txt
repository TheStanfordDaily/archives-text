# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
To the Editor:
Agreeing whole-heartedly with Mr. HefTner's let
ter regarding student government, I am impelled to
answer the letter by Gordon L. Ness.
The idea that education involves getting along
with other people is perhaps true, but it is difficult
to see how student government and elections further
this purpose. The only people who learn anything
are those actually in office and those who are analo
gous to ward-heelers in municipal government. Cer
tainly these form a minute proportion of the student
body at any given time. The mere act of voting in
no conceivable manner adds anything to a knowl
edge of human relations.
That which may be learned from a student gov
ernment can better be obtained from the partici
pation in small-group activities on campus in which
the members are interested. That is, if one feels it
necessary to learn lobbying practices and "inner
and outer" clique techniques.
It seems to me that the student government idea
is one of those which are semi-traditional in col
leges and which actually have no function in col
lege life. Perhaps—if elections are so educational—
an election should be held on whether or not to
continue student government at Stanford.

Furthermore. Mr. Ness' tone of horror at. the pos
sibility that losing student government might lead
to loss of the sports program would be amusing were
it not so indicative of American education in gen
eral. Just what place does a semi-professional bas
ketball or football team have in this place of learn
ing? Explain in detail why a small number of men
engaged in competitive sports should expect school
wide support and interest, rising to mass hysteria
at intervals. How does watching an athletic contest
provide the spectator with any ascertainable bene
fit?
And since I seem to be engaged in a genera!
dissertation I may as well add my suggestion for a
War Memorial. Why not a campus taproom—yes, I
mean with beer. Judging by the number of Stanford
students seen in neighboring beer joints there is a
definite need for one. There was an article in the
Daily the other day mentioning the Dartmouth tap
room. Are Stanford students less mature than those
in the East? Must we go a specified distance of! the
campus—away from the paternal eye of the Admin
istration—before being able to get a beer? There is
nothing lik<? a bar to really get to know people—and
not a ballot box in sight.

To the Editor:
Agreeing whole-heartedly with Mr. HefTner's let
ter regarding student government, I am impelled to
answer the letter by Gordon L. Ness.
The idea that education involves getting along
with other people is perhaps true, but it is difficult
to see how student government and elections further
this purpose. The only people who learn anything
are those actually in office and those who are analo
gous to ward-heelers in municipal government. Cer
tainly these form a minute proportion of the student
body at any given time. The mere act of voting in
no conceivable manner adds anything to a knowl
edge of human relations.
That which may be learned from a student gov
ernment can better be obtained from the partici
pation in small-group activities on campus in which
the members are interested. That is, if one feels it
necessary to learn lobbying practices and "inner
and outer" clique techniques.
It seems to me that the student government idea
is one of those which are semi-traditional in col
leges and which actually have no function in col
lege life. Perhaps—if elections are so educational—
an election should be held on whether or not to
continue student government at Stanford.

Furthermore. Mr. Ness' tone of horror at. the pos
sibility that losing student government might lead
to loss of the sports program would be amusing were
it not so indicative of American education in gen
eral. Just what place does a semi-professional bas
ketball or football team have in this place of learn
ing? Explain in detail why a small number of men
engaged in competitive sports should expect school
wide support and interest, rising to mass hysteria
at intervals. How does watching an athletic contest
provide the spectator with any ascertainable bene
fit?
