Every Week the Same Tiling Itut
What Would \\ c Do Without Basketball i
Another weekend, another basketball series. Last week the Cards
squeaked through with a double win, but this time it looks a little
tougher. U.S.F. has a team that has whipped some of the big shots, and
lost to some of the weaklings; you never know what they're going to do.
Santa Clara, of course, has lost only one game out of 19.
Perhaps it was a bad break that the Broncos were billed for Satur
day night; with Stanford's lack of reserve strength, the boys will again
be all tired out if they are given rugged opposition by the Dons. Basket
ball is a grueling sport; it's unfortunate that the boys must meet the
tougher team at a time when thev are bound to be somewhat fatigued.
As mentioned, the Dons blow hot and cold—but I think the Indians are
gradually improving, last weekend's games notwithstanding. Therefore 1
think they'll topple U.S.F.—but the Mission boys will be a major problem.
Santa Clara dropped the locals last quarter in a practice game, although
the score wasn't bad; the two squads played about twice the regulation
period, and the final score was somewhere in the vicinity ot 90 to 80. Ot
course both coaches were using every man on their respective teams.
About the same time, the Broncs dropped Cal. U.S.C., and U.C.L.A.,
all in a row. Their only defeat to date was inflicted by Washington State
during the nearby team's swing around the Northwest. It wasn't a deci
sive licking.
There's the facts; you know what both Stanford and Santa Clara have
done to date, and you know the Indians are likely to be tired. I believe
Ihe Cards will drop the Dons, then lose to Santa Clara—but it'll be a good
game, not a runaway.
Don't Worry, Its Just a Little 1 Feapot
It may be that quite a little tempest is brewing in the Stanford teapot,
between our strong-backed oarsmen and the athletic department. Grad
uate Manager A 1 Masters has been quoted as saying he'll make every effort
to keep crew from becoming a University-supported sport. The howls from
the yacht harbor are painful to the ear.
Now. I don't think Mr. Masters is always right; if he were, he'd have
cleaned up on the stock market years ago and retired. But heres one
thing you can depend on: he'll never do anything he thinks is wrong—
he always believes in the course ol action he takes. It must be ad
mitted that he has been much more often right than wrong, in the past.
Knowing this about the graduate manager, I always like to hear both
sides of things before I lorm an opinion about his actions. When I first
heard the story, finances popped into my head; I know how strapped the
S.A.C. is right now.
My investigation shows that I was partially right; money is a big factor.
The boys trying to reorganize crew on the Farm have gone into the matter
thoroughly, and have drawn up estimates lor what they think the sport
would cost on a yearly basis. These estimates were presented to Mi - .
Masters (a copy was sent over to the Daily office also).
But it seems these estimates are a bit optimistic, to say the least. In
(lie presence of some of the leading lights from the crew. Mr. Masters
put through a call to Berkeley and asked Clint Evans just what Cal
had to put out each year. The answer was—s3s,ooo.
Bear in mind, crew is a going concern at Cal. They have their plant
already built—this figure represents upkeep only. It should also be
pointed out that Cal wants Stanford to take up crew in a big way; there
fore, they weren't trying to discourage us.
What's a Sport Without Spectators?
But crew can't contribute to its upkeep in any way; in a sense, it isn t
a spectator sport at all. The course is long—it's impossible to go around
in a circle. A fan, if he watches the start, can't see the finish; if he parks
himself at the finish line, he sees only the tail end of the race. Under
those circumstances it's impossible to charge admission.
Therefore crew is a continual drain on football, which is the sole
support of the S.A.C. The past year was not the greatest box office year
in Stanford's history—and for the three previous years there was no
income at all. A budget has been made out—a rather slim budget, with
many activities curtailed. It's an old axiom that you can't spend money
you don't have.
The other sports engaged in here at Stanford always have a deficit—
but almost without exception they manage to take in at least something;
anything at all makes a smaller deficit for football to make up, and thus
lightens the load. Crew, one of the most expensive sports of all, can't even
do this.
Now don't get me wrong. I like crew; I'm probably one of the few
screwballs who does. 1 like to fly, too, but I can't afford an airplane;
ergo, I don't buy one. If I had the money in my pocket, I still couldn't
buy one, because of the upkeep. I think this is analogous with the
situation in crew, with this exception—you can rent an airplane, but not
a racing shell.
Yes, the boys could limp along on much less money, but I can t believe
it would ever be anything but heartbreaking to them. You can't beat other
good crews unless you have a good coach to show you how. It would be
possible to go along with a student coach, but he'd be no match lor such
masters as Ky Ebright and Hec Edmundson. They'd have second-rate
coaching, second-rate equipment, and few trips. They d seldom win, even
though they were potential champions.
Crew appeals to me because it is so completely amateur; I in rather
repelled by the excesses of commercialism in the amateur sports world.
Still, coaches have to be paid money or they don't eat; racing shell
makers demand money for their wares; railroads still insist on someone
paying the fare for each passenger: hotels are not as yet accepting guests
on a nonpaying basis. Those are the cruel facts ot life. Money is indis
pensable.
The money is not available at the S.A.C. That means that if there is
to be crew here at Stanford, it will have to be supported by the partici
pants. I hope they have good luck in raising the money—lll be glad to
contribute a dollar or two myself—but I can see no excuse for saddling
the already-overburdened S.A.C. with yet another gigantic financial load.
Swimming Is Water ol Another (<olor
P
Some of you will remember that I recommended swimming be advanced
to major sport status. That's because I think that sport will go tar toward
supporting its small needs. For crew—which actually interests me more,
personally—l can see no such hope.
Of course I can speak for no one but S«t. Slinger; this column is
merely his opinion of things. Often the stall of this paper disagrees with
him violently—probably will on this question; he can say only what
lie thinks. People who disagree with him can console themselves by
reflecting that his ideas carry no more weight than theirs.

The new Block S Society is going ahead with organizational plans. For
one thing, they're writing other schools throughout the nation to get a
line on the function of other letter- I ~

men's groups. Another meeting will
be called by Chairman Fred
Boensch when an agenda has been
drawn up—probably not too far in I
the future. The turnout at the last .
meeting disappointing: if Sgt.
Slinger were a Stanford letterman j
he'd certainly be there. No Block S
man should fail to attend the next
meeting.
