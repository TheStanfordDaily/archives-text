# CARDS BATTLE DONS, BRONCOS
## 
### ART SHAPIRO 
It will be a big weekend in the Pavilion! Things should be at the boil- '
ing point as the two strongest independent basketball squads on the coast l 1
move in on the Indian's lair. Willi U.S.F. scheduled for Friday evening
and the Broncos of Santa Clara taking the bows on Saturday, Stanford
will be offering up the tastiest dish on the sports menu for the week.
The Cardinal varsity, after having gone through their best practice !
session of the season Wednesday afternoon, held a light run-through last
night in preparation for the two coming encounters. The ball-handling of
the varsity five and the floor play of the entire squad was something to
behold during the Wednesday session.
CHANCE TO COP TWO
Coach Everett Dean when questioned on the Cardinal's chances
against (he two visiting teams replied, "We are in a position to win both
of the contests as easily as to lose them. The breaks can decide the
outcome, because we are playing two good quintets, and we ourselves
are set for some line ball playing, plus having the advantage of play
ing the games on our home court."
During the week's workouts two of the substitutes managed to show
exceptional promise and may crack into the lineup this weekend. Bob 1
Lewis,, the 6-foot 4 guard, was hitting the draperies from all angles and !
began doubling in brass at the center slot. Bill Drehobl, out of action for j
the greater part of the year with assorted troubles and ailments, demon- i

* strafed a definite improvement over
his former playing with the addi
tion of contact lenses for his weak
â€¢ eyes. His drive and ball-hawking
techniques can certainly be used by i
the team.
THRILLS GALORE; FEW SEATS
The Broncs and Dons will pro
vide plenty of excitement and
thrills for player and spectator
alike. The quality of the brand of
basketball to he played over the
weekend will he good, but the

varsity contests will he preceded
by "B" squad games. The starting
time of these contests has been
j set for (i:3O, with the main events

The starting lineup for the Dons

driguez at forwards, McNamee at

I all - veteran five of Mariani and
