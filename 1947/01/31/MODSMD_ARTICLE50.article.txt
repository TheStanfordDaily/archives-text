Increased understanding of Span
ish contributions to culture and pro
motion of a friendly co-operative
spirit between Spanish and English
speaking nations are the chief aims
of Sigma Delta Pi, Spanish honor
society.
SIGMA DELTA PI
Sigma Delta Pi was founded at
the University of California in 191!)
and now has 53 chapters at Ameri
can universities and colleges; Stan
ford's Kappa chapter was founded
in 1926.
Sigma Delta Pi is an honorary so
ciety, and therefore students are ad
mitted as active members only if
they are in an upper division Span
ish course and are doing superior
work. Usually a special recommen
dation from a professor is necessary
also. At present there are 35 active
members.
However, people who are inter
ested in Latin America and Spain
hut who do not have the necessary
qualifications to become active
members can become associates
and enter almost all the activities
of the club.
Sigma Delta Pi was first started
at Stanford by a group of Cal stu
dents who came down and initiated
the new Farm members. Dr. Juan
Rael, now a Stanford professor, was
a grad student at Cal and was among
the Cal members.
At that time the purpose of the
club was purely honorary and an
occasional lecture was the only ac
tivity. However, as the membership

and interest in Spanish American
relations increased, activities became
social as well as intellectual.
DANCES, FIESTAS
In the past the club has shown
Spanish movies, given dances and
fiestas for the whole campus, and
had teas and picnics. Year before
last Sigma Delia Pi gave a dance for
the eijtire student body .in the Wo
men's Gym at which Latin Ameri
cans taught dances.
Sigma Delta Pi meetings are usu
ally conducted in English, but at
social functions students endeavor
to speak Spanish.
This year the club has not been
too active, according to President
Joanne Fellows, but plans are being
made for many activities this quar
ter. In a few weeks the club will
take in 15 new active members and
some associate members, including
Latin American students.
The initiation will take place at
Longbarn and a visiting Span
iard will speak.
Sigma Delta Pi is also trying to
get nearby theaters, to show Spanish
movies once a month so that stu
dents may have a chance to hear
Spanish spoken.
Dr. Aurelio Espinosa was sponsor
of the organization for many years,
but with his retirement last June,
his son, Dr. Espinosa, Jr., became
adviser.
Officers of Sigma Delta Pi arc
Joanne Fellows, president; Gloria
Cassidy, vice-president; Avelline
Quirtn, treasurer, and June Baker,
secretary.

SIGMA DELTA PI
Sigma Delta Pi was founded at
the University of California in 191!)
and now has 53 chapters at Ameri
can universities and colleges; Stan
ford's Kappa chapter was founded
in 1926.
Sigma Delta Pi is an honorary so
ciety, and therefore students are ad
mitted as active members only if
they are in an upper division Span
ish course and are doing superior
work. Usually a special recommen
dation from a professor is necessary
also. At present there are 35 active
members.
However, people who are inter
ested in Latin America and Spain
hut who do not have the necessary
qualifications to become active
members can become associates
and enter almost all the activities
of the club.
Sigma Delta Pi was first started
at Stanford by a group of Cal stu
dents who came down and initiated
the new Farm members. Dr. Juan
Rael, now a Stanford professor, was
a grad student at Cal and was among
the Cal members.
At that time the purpose of the
club was purely honorary and an
occasional lecture was the only ac
tivity. However, as the membership

and interest in Spanish American
relations increased, activities became
social as well as intellectual.
DANCES, FIESTAS
In the past the club has shown
Spanish movies, given dances and
fiestas for the whole campus, and
had teas and picnics. Year before
last Sigma Delia Pi gave a dance for
the eijtire student body .in the Wo
men's Gym at which Latin Ameri
cans taught dances.
Sigma Delta Pi meetings are usu
ally conducted in English, but at
social functions students endeavor
to speak Spanish.
This year the club has not been
too active, according to President
Joanne Fellows, but plans are being
made for many activities this quar
ter. In a few weeks the club will
take in 15 new active members and
some associate members, including
Latin American students.
