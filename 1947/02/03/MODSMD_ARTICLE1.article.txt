SCHOOL LECTURES

A self-made man, Mr. Kraft put
himself through business college in
Buffalo bv doing janitor work, ped
dling eegs, and selling ice. In 1903
he went to Chicago with $60 in hi.s
pocket and a persistent notion that
cheese could be pasteurized.

His first business venture was to
buy a horse named Paddy and a
cheese wagoh and peddle cheese
from the waterfront to merchants in
downtown Chicago.
Today Paddy and the one cheese
wagon have been supplanted by
more than 2.000 refrigerated
(rucks. According to Mr. Kraft,
his recipe for success consists of
four words, "practical knowledge
properly applied."
