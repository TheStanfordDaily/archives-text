# Campaigning Fund Issue Off Ballot
## 
### 
At A.S.S.U. President Martin An
derson's request, the campaign fund \
proposition will not be on Wednes- j
day's ballot, announced Gordon j
Ness, Election Board head.
Last week Anderson received a
letter from Dick Bartle, member of !
Men's Council, pointing out that j
since Excom represents the student
body, the precedent of putting de
batable issues on the ballot is ill
advised.
MONEY PROPOSITION
The proposition, which would
permit candidates for A.S.S.U. pres
ident and vice-president to spend
up to $15 and candidates for minor
offices up to $10 for electioneering,
was considered by Excoin two
weeks ago.
Action was tabled until student
opinion could be determined by
vote.
Anderson pointed out that re
gardless of the opinion expressed by
students, a change in the constitu
tional by-laws could not be effected
in this case by popular vote.
PETITION NEEDED
To change A.S.S.U. by-laws, a
petition of 150 students must be filed
with Excom at least 15 days before
elections, according to Article IX,
Section 1, paragraph (2), of the con
stitution.
The petition, to become effective,
must then be approved by a major
ity of voters.
Changes in the by-laws also may
be made by a three-quarters vote
of Excom.
