# CIVIL WARFARE FLARES IN PALESTINE
## Remove Civilians As Crisis Looms 
### 
JERUSALEM, Feb. 2 (UP).â€”The emergency evacuation of
British women and children from Palestine started tonight and
almost simultaneously the long-expected Jewish underground
"civil warfare" flared on a Tel Aviv street.

" Forty-three women and children
took off in three chartered planes for
Cairo, beginning the move which
will empty Palestine of dependents
and clear the way for a showdown
between British authorities and the
Jewish underground.
COMBATANTS MKET
The last British civilian was
scarcely out of the all-Jewish city
of Tel Aviv when members of Ha
gatiah, illegal underground organi
zation, and Irgun Zvai Leuini, i! ,
militant offshoot, swung into battle
against each other for the first time
since the end of World War 11.
Five men were sent to hospitals
with injuries.
POSTERS HIPPED
The clash started when Irgunir.l'.
tried to rip down Haganah posters
which denounced the gangland
style, fund-raising methods of Irgun
and the Stern Rang. Haganah mem
bers attacked the lrgunists.
Chief Rabbis Isaac Herzoti and
Ren Zion Oziel, carrying sacred
scrolls, visited Dov Gruner, con
demned Irgunist, in his cell at mid
night in an unsuccessful plea. He
refused to sign an application for
appeal which would postpone his
hanging.
THOUSANDS EVACUATED
The first evacuees, to be followed
by thousands within the next few
days, were families of business offi
cials.
As they left British authorities
were reported evacuating all civil
ians from the all-Jewish city of Tel
Aviv, a center for underground vio
lence, and concentrating them in
barricaded compounds here, in Haifa
and in Jaffa.
The first evacuee planes were
flown urgently from Transjordan to
Haifa for tonight's departure.
