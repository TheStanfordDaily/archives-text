Mexico and its people were foa
lured nt the"I" Club meeting held
yesterday at the home of Dr. Russell
Lee. In a beautiful room, decorated
with caricature murals, Barbara
I«mg spoke on Mexico and showed
colored movies of her Mexican tour.
"Mexico is a wonderful coun
try," she. said, "but you must
leave all curious notions about
Mexico behind, if you ever want
to enjoy a visit to that country."
She went on to say that Mexico is
a land of contrasts, and one can
see this in everything about Mex
ico. "It is a land of wealth hut
this wealth is concentrated in the
bands of a few, while the rest of
the people arc very poor."
Miss Lang found that all Mexi
cans were hospitable. "They would
go far out of their way in order to
help you in having a good linv.
Their favorite welcome is, 'My home
is your home.'" The only people
who don't enjoy this welcome, ac
cording to Miss Lang, are tho: '•
Americans who go about, in a very
haughty way.
Another feature of Mexican life
that appealed to her was the ex
quisite manners of the Mexicans.
"They treat their women as if
they were glass statues placed <>n
pedestals," she said.
Talking about the future of the
country, she said that young men
are the real hope of Mexico. "Edu
cation is fast progressing in that
country and taking its place aim"
with the church."
