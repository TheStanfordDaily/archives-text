## 'Just Little Annoyed' 
### 
Dean Stalnaker made a speech Thursday
afternoon, concerning the organization of
Slanford University, and the affairs of the Ad
ministration as opposed to the affairs of stu
dent self-management. From a Daily story
which quoted the Dean as saying "I get just
a little annoyed at minor student groups who
propose to make drastic changes in the Uni
versity," a semi-experienced head-writer tag
ged the story, "Dean Stalnaker Declares Stu
ff iits Interfere With Administration."
This is not what the Dean meant in his
::;jfoch before Women's Conference, and wo
accept the full blame for the headline's mis
i-.'presentation of the story. But the fact that
sik 11 a headline could have been written, that
rniiiy persons on and off the Daily staff de
fended it as a valid interpretation of Adminis
t:<.ttion attitude, is sufficiently notable to
prompt a reply to what was said and what
might have been implied at the meeting.
Dean Stalnaker's willingness to address
Conference was a first step in correcting the
brig standing feeling of both students and
Administration that the tvvo gioups are sepa
rate in function, separate in thought, sepaiate
in aim. Yet his exact woids would throw a
scare into any student who wished to feel that
he is an important member ot the Stanford
community: running the University, Dean Stal
i'.iker implies, is the business of the Adminis
tration and of no one else
The psychology of the Dean is 'students
hould clean up their own business before
trying to run that of someone else"—it's a
psychology which we have editorially en
dorsed, with reservations which strongly op

pose the annoyance of the Dean at "minor stu
dent groups."
We know what type of "group" the Dean
means — radicals, who without knowing the
facts or giving the Administration credit for
knowing them, will demand that, for example,
apartments for all married students be built
immediately.
But we wish to explain our point of view—
not only to Dean Stalnaker, but to all those
officials whom he represents.
We do not subscribe to the philosophy that
as students we are merely buying a product
offered by the Board of Trustees a four-year
education at Stanlord and that if we find this
product to be in some ways unsatisfactory,
we can go elsewhere. We consider ourselves
to be stockholders in this University, because
we are paying tuition, and because we are
the principal reason for its existence. We feel
sure that we have the right to criticize, and to
recommend change.
When students feel their welfare is being
neglected, as in the case of the library lights
or the food at Encina Commons, they should
feel free to propose drastic change. When
students conclude that a change in curriculum
would be advantageous to the educational
aims of the University, they should always feel
free to suggest it As students ourselves we
would feel moie than a little annoyed it it were
not our privilege tc do so.
When a wrong is done, we do not turn oui
backs on it, and consider that the wrong is
non-existent. We do not feel that going to
another school is sufficient to right what is
wrong at Stanford: we as students want to
make it right for those persons who will al
ways come to Stanford, when we are gone.

would feel moie than a little annoyed it it were
not our privilege tc do so.
When a wrong is done, we do not turn oui
backs on it, and consider that the wrong is
non-existent. We do not feel that going to
another school is sufficient to right what is
wrong at Stanford: we as students want to
make it right for those persons who will al
ways come to Stanford, when we are gone.
Dean Stalnaker made a speech Thursday
afternoon, concerning the organization of
Slanford University, and the affairs of the Ad
ministration as opposed to the affairs of stu
dent self-management. From a Daily story
which quoted the Dean as saying "I get just
a little annoyed at minor student groups who
propose to make drastic changes in the Uni
versity," a semi-experienced head-writer tag
ged the story, "Dean Stalnaker Declares Stu
ff iits Interfere With Administration."
This is not what the Dean meant in his
::;jfoch before Women's Conference, and wo
accept the full blame for the headline's mis
i-.'presentation of the story. But the fact that
sik 11 a headline could have been written, that
rniiiy persons on and off the Daily staff de
fended it as a valid interpretation of Adminis
t:<.ttion attitude, is sufficiently notable to
prompt a reply to what was said and what
might have been implied at the meeting.
Dean Stalnaker's willingness to address
Conference was a first step in correcting the
brig standing feeling of both students and
Administration that the tvvo gioups are sepa
rate in function, separate in thought, sepaiate
in aim. Yet his exact woids would throw a
scare into any student who wished to feel that
he is an important member ot the Stanford
community: running the University, Dean Stal
i'.iker implies, is the business of the Adminis
tration and of no one else
The psychology of the Dean is 'students
hould clean up their own business before
trying to run that of someone else"—it's a
psychology which we have editorially en
dorsed, with reservations which strongly op

pose the annoyance of the Dean at "minor stu
dent groups."
We know what type of "group" the Dean
means — radicals, who without knowing the
facts or giving the Administration credit for
knowing them, will demand that, for example,
apartments for all married students be built
immediately.
But we wish to explain our point of view—
not only to Dean Stalnaker, but to all those
officials whom he represents.
We do not subscribe to the philosophy that
as students we are merely buying a product
offered by the Board of Trustees a four-year
education at Stanlord and that if we find this
product to be in some ways unsatisfactory,
we can go elsewhere. We consider ourselves
to be stockholders in this University, because
we are paying tuition, and because we are
the principal reason for its existence. We feel
sure that we have the right to criticize, and to
recommend change.
When students feel their welfare is being
neglected, as in the case of the library lights
or the food at Encina Commons, they should
feel free to propose drastic change. When
students conclude that a change in curriculum
would be advantageous to the educational
aims of the University, they should always feel
free to suggest it As students ourselves we
would feel moie than a little annoyed it it were
not our privilege tc do so.
