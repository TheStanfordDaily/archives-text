To the Editor:
'there are many questions in the Daily today [Fri
day ! to prompt the student, who has spent time at
Stanford before and since th<? war, to write to the
editor in hopes of reaching the whole of the student
body, and indeed there should be a flood of such
l< Iters. I speak specifically of Dean Stalnaker's dis
cussions and the letter by Mr. Bashkow.
11 is with concern that pre-war students view the
e.urn os in attitude and the attempts from various
quarters to eliminate student government. Before
many ol us went into the service, there was student
• overnment—it worked and we were proud of it—
proud to have the freedom that it allowed, proud
(if the individuality it engendered, and proud of the
diversity and expense of activity that it permitted.
During the war. with the mass migration of stu
<l nts into uniform and ol the uniforms to Stanford
and the limitation imposed on wartime activities, it
became necessary to subordinate these functions to
the new conditions, all of which led to the apathy and
the ineffectiveness of the institutions of which we
were justly proud. And upon our return to peace
time education we find that attempts toward contin
i.ance of this ineffectiveness and eventually toward
elimination of them are being fostered. It is, there
lore, time that the students realize the seriousness of
(he situation and rally together to meet these charges
and changes.
The apathy and disinterest have had their initial
impetus from the wartime conditions as I have in
dicated. Their continuance is due to other causes—
some growing out of the war and its effect. In the
first place, the war has brought to Stanford many
new students, who were not familiar with prewar
Stanlord. They are not interested necessarily in pre
serving the old traditions and returning to them.
Secondly, the crowded conditions have their effect
and require certain changes. Thirdly, the advent of
o many married students who have two lives to live
their home life and that of the student. They are
naturally interested more in the former and in fin
ishing quickly their education. The affairs of extra
curricular nature do not hold their interest nearly
o much as their own lives, which is, of course, only
natural. These /ire just a few of the reasons for the
apparent apathy.
However, there are certainly enough of us, who
do not fall within these groups or into others, to
< an y the ball and build up our student organization
; nd interest in it so that everyone will benefit by it
aid be inspired toward its effective, continuance.
There are charges of -semi-professiohalisnv in
ports and the implication that they should also be
done away with. I have no doubt that those making
these charges and implications will be laughed out of
court. II one cannot be interested and enthused by
an athletic contest and the spirit of unity of purpose
thai il inspires, he is in a bad way, and people have
been under a false impression as to the value of
names since before the Spartans.
Other questions that are asked can only be an
• we red hy opinion. The Daily—"Does it represent
the news fairly?" At the outset of the academic
year the editors stated that this would be their
prime objective, and that where there were ques
tions ol general interest and importance, they would
present all sides, and if they felt tfyere was justifi
cation for certain action, they would recommend it
through their columns. They have lived up to their
objectives, I believe, as well as anyone could hope,
and by so doing accomplish precisely the purpose
from which a student publication derives its reason
lor existence. It -focuses attention upon issues of
importance and infuses interest and a sense of
unity into the whole of the student body.
Tin- Chaparral, so far as I know, has never laid
any claims to literary superiority of accomplishment.
It is a humor magazine and presents the lighter
side of university life. And as such, it is doing its
job well. In the same vein, the Gaieties makes no
claim lo great dramatic production. It is part of pre-

Big Game festivities, contemplated to help build up |
spirit for the biggest athletic event of the year, while j
at the same time characterizing and satirizing the |
more amusing sidelights of campus life. In doing
this it aiso gives students an opportunity to develop
and display their talents.
All three of these parts of university student
life have an important role in the wider development
of the student just as the radio station, the Quad, stu-'l
dent government, and the many other organizations
outside the curricula of formal education, and they j
accomplish their purpose to a reasonable degree.
With risk ol censure, I should like to make one
further observation. All Stanford students should
be familiar with the Governor's famous statement
to the effect that the boys of California would be his
boys. Although limited by the times, this feeling
illustrates the proposition that the primary reason
for the University is the benefit it accrues to the
students thereof. And, therefore, it is not only |
natural that they should take an interest in its ad- i
ministration, il it is to be a living, growing thing.
And it seems to me that their interest should not '
cause annoyance upon the part of its administrative I
officials, but should be gratifying to them. Of course, ;
there are many phases of administration which can 1
only be carried on by the persons who are so em- i
ployed, but nevertheless they have either direct or !
indirect effect upon the students, and the student '
interest should not be shunned but appreciated.

To the Editor:
Dear Mr. Stalnaker:
On behalf of Women's Conference, we, as members j
of the Advisory Board, wish to thank you again for j
appearing before our group last Thursday afternoon i
and for giving such adequate answers to all of our
questions. Also we wish to apologize for the gross '
misrepresentation of meaning which the Daily article
gave to your speech. We are certain that your ideas
were not received by Conference in the same light
in which they were presented to the students the fol
lowing day.
As an example, the headlines which read "Dean :
Stalnaker declares students interfere with Adminis- j
t ration" were a definite misrepresentation of fact, for i
what you said was "I get just a little annoyed at i
minor student groups who propose to make drastic !
changes in the University"; and you further added
that you were more than willing, however, to answer i
any of the questions which the students might bring
to your attention. Furthermore, was it fair to say j
that you "counterattacked" with questions of your
own? We think not. ] ' . ' ; ■
Webster defines the word "counterattack" as an
attack made in reprisal for an enemy's action. We :
don't believe anyone at the meeting suffered under i
the illusion that your questions were a means of
counter-attack, but rather as a means of stimulating
thought about the various student-run activities.
Again wo want to thank you for the time and j
effort which you spent in preparation of your meet
ing with Conference, and we hope that this letter
will in some way express our appreciation.
Very sincerely yours,
Erline Anderson Betty Davies

Orchids (of dubious nature) to "grinning" Georgo
Velliotes, who breezed through ten paragraphs of
"Bull Session" and used the personal pronoun "I"
only 35 times!!

Dear Ed:
You were so wise to finally print George's Bull
Session. You've just thrilled me to death.
