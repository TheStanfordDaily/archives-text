# Statistical Summary Says Autumn Grades Lowest

### JEAN BURNET 
Does' the grade average tradi
tionally fall spring quarter at
Stanford? How do activity-mon
gers look in the scholarship de
partment? What is the compari
son between the total men's grades
and I'.aose of the women on the
Farm? What about standings of
athletes? These are questions
nearly everyone asks at one time
or other, and although no conclu
sions can be made, certain general
statistics are available.
With the exception of the year
1941-42 the grade point of the Uni
versity between 1938-39 and 1945-40
was consistently higher — by two
points—in most cases. In that excep
tional year grade point was 2.53 the
spring quarter, 2.54 winter quarter i
and 2.52 fall quarter. A "C" average '
is 2.
Fall quarter shows up as the low
point scholastic-ally, falling below
the two other quarters from 4 to 0
hundredths of a point. The Univer
sity average in 1944-45 for fall quar
ter was 2.5(5, and 2.6!} that spring.
The all-time low in this period was
2.19 for fall quarter 1938-39.
FOOTBALL QUARTER
Football steps into the limelight
fall quarter. How did the players
fare in the grade department? Every
year during playing season the
members of the varsity football team
have a lower grade average than m
the other two quarters of the year.
The highest average, 2.36, for a fall
quarter was attained by the last
Rose Bowl jteam, 1940 41, while the
lowest fell to the 1938-39 aggrega
tion which was also listed as some
thing less than outstanding in pig •
skin annals. A correlation is sug
gested, but not conclusive. That it
takes smart men to make the T
click may be borne out.
The three sports, football, bas
ketball, and baseball between
1938-39 and 1940-41 are not con
sistent when compared in their
appropriate quarters, which is not
a scientific method. In 1940 the
basketball average was one hun
dredth of a point better than for
the baseball squad. Baseball again
came to the fore in 1940-41 by
beating out the average of the
football team 2.47 to 2.36. In 1941-
42 the members of the basketball
team again placed first. The only
notable fact about this comparison
is that the football team failed to
place first.
When the season ended for these
teams their grade point averages
rose .20 to .30 in the case of the boys
on the football team; and .30 in the
case of the basketball players. The
baseball team had its ups and downs
and in 1939-40 their average rose
from 2.28 fall quarter to 2.51 during
the baseball season.
HOW THEY PLACED
In 1938-39 the average grade point
for men was 2.45. with varsity bas
ketball average for the year listed
as 2.4(5, baseball next with 2.34, and
the gridders trailing with 2.23. The
next year the men as a whole upped

their aveiage with basketball again
taking the honors wilh the other two
sports following in the same order.
In 1940-41 baseball took the lead and
football placed second. With a total
average of 2.45 for the year 1941-42,
baseball led with a 2.32 average,
basketball 2.31 and football 2.29.
Twice the athletes matched or best
ed the over-all record of men, bas
ketball by .01 and baseball matching
it.
Cap and Gown, a senior women's
activities honorary, maintained a 3.
plus average during the same period
with the exception of 1939-40 when
it fell to 2.80. In the same general
category, Phi Phi, the fraternity
men's honorary fraternity, recorded
two years a 2.50 average, falling
somewhat later. The constituents of
these two groups may be represen
tative of the activity big-wigs.
Women maintain an edge on the
men's scholastic standings consist
ently by slightly less than .20. Fra
ternity men fall about .02 below
(he average for non-fraternity
men. However, the difference in
numbers of the two groups must
lie taken into consideration.
In the publications field, the Daily
and the Quad split the series, the
Quad placing first 1938-40, while the
Chaparral consistently occupied the
cellar.
El Capitan in the eating club di
vision led the parade three out of
four times with a high top score of
£93 hi 1938-39 A general shift
within the group was seen during
this period with the exception of the
Breakers which took low honors
three out of four tries.
The Circle S Society was consist
ent during these years with a 2.5
plus average, the high point being
reached in 1940-41 with 2.57.
Various other comparisons can be
made, buf no definite conclusions
can be reached. These figures, pub
lished by the University, give op
portunity for speculative correla
tion. but numerous other factors
have to be taken into account.

The three sports, football, bas
ketball, and baseball between
1938-39 and 1940-41 are not con
sistent when compared in their
appropriate quarters, which is not
a scientific method. In 1940 the
basketball average was one hun
dredth of a point better than for
the baseball squad. Baseball again
came to the fore in 1940-41 by
beating out the average of the
football team 2.47 to 2.36. In 1941-
42 the members of the basketball
team again placed first. The only
notable fact about this comparison
is that the football team failed to
place first.
When the season ended for these
teams their grade point averages
rose .20 to .30 in the case of the boys
on the football team; and .30 in the
case of the basketball players. The
baseball team had its ups and downs
and in 1939-40 their average rose
from 2.28 fall quarter to 2.51 during
the baseball season.
HOW THEY PLACED
In 1938-39 the average grade point
for men was 2.45. with varsity bas
ketball average for the year listed
as 2.4(5, baseball next with 2.34, and
the gridders trailing with 2.23. The
next year the men as a whole upped

their aveiage with basketball again
taking the honors wilh the other two
sports following in the same order.
In 1940-41 baseball took the lead and
football placed second. With a total
average of 2.45 for the year 1941-42,
baseball led with a 2.32 average,
basketball 2.31 and football 2.29.
Twice the athletes matched or best
ed the over-all record of men, bas
ketball by .01 and baseball matching
it.
Cap and Gown, a senior women's
activities honorary, maintained a 3.
plus average during the same period
with the exception of 1939-40 when
it fell to 2.80. In the same general
category, Phi Phi, the fraternity
men's honorary fraternity, recorded
two years a 2.50 average, falling
somewhat later. The constituents of
these two groups may be represen
tative of the activity big-wigs.
Women maintain an edge on the
men's scholastic standings consist
ently by slightly less than .20. Fra
ternity men fall about .02 below
(he average for non-fraternity
men. However, the difference in
numbers of the two groups must
lie taken into consideration.
In the publications field, the Daily
and the Quad split the series, the
Quad placing first 1938-40, while the
Chaparral consistently occupied the
cellar.
El Capitan in the eating club di
vision led the parade three out of
four times with a high top score of
£93 hi 1938-39 A general shift
within the group was seen during
this period with the exception of the
Breakers which took low honors
three out of four tries.
The Circle S Society was consist
ent during these years with a 2.5
plus average, the high point being
reached in 1940-41 with 2.57.
Various other comparisons can be
made, buf no definite conclusions
can be reached. These figures, pub
lished by the University, give op
portunity for speculative correla
tion. but numerous other factors
have to be taken into account.
Does' the grade average tradi
tionally fall spring quarter at
Stanford? How do activity-mon
gers look in the scholarship de
partment? What is the compari
son between the total men's grades
and I'.aose of the women on the
Farm? What about standings of
athletes? These are questions
nearly everyone asks at one time
or other, and although no conclu
sions can be made, certain general
statistics are available.
With the exception of the year
1941-42 the grade point of the Uni
versity between 1938-39 and 1945-40
was consistently higher — by two
points—in most cases. In that excep
tional year grade point was 2.53 the
spring quarter, 2.54 winter quarter i
and 2.52 fall quarter. A "C" average '
is 2.
Fall quarter shows up as the low
point scholastic-ally, falling below
the two other quarters from 4 to 0
hundredths of a point. The Univer
sity average in 1944-45 for fall quar
ter was 2.5(5, and 2.6!} that spring.
The all-time low in this period was
2.19 for fall quarter 1938-39.
FOOTBALL QUARTER
Football steps into the limelight
fall quarter. How did the players
fare in the grade department? Every
year during playing season the
members of the varsity football team
have a lower grade average than m
the other two quarters of the year.
The highest average, 2.36, for a fall
quarter was attained by the last
Rose Bowl jteam, 1940 41, while the
lowest fell to the 1938-39 aggrega
tion which was also listed as some
