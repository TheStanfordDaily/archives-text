# Six Mural Teams Drop From Undefeated Ranks
## 
### 
Only 16 undefeated intramural basketball teams remained today, fol
lowing a drastic week of upsets which saw six teams pruned from the
select list. Upsets were the order of the week, with Delta Tau Delta's stun
ning 1-1-12 defeat at the hands of the Chi Psi's setting the keynote. En
ema's multiple entries felt the roughest turnabouts as three teams, lE, 2E,
and 4E, dropped their first decisions*

of the season. Meanwhile, El Toro
and the Kappa Sigs completed the
list, of teams losing their initial
game.
On the cheerful side of intramu
ral topics, three rugged power
houses seem to be ruling the pUiy.
In League I, the S.A.E.'s have
chalked up three effortless wins to
stamp themselves as championship
material. The Chi Psi's may dispute
such a claim as they have dupli
cated the 3-0 record in League 11,
despite the threatening Delts. And
to complete the trio of high win
ners, League 111 is still attempting
to halt the rush of the Zete A squad
which has yet to taste defeat in
three outings.
Intramural Director Gene Cold
iron stated that El Capitan has
been dropped from League I due
to the lack of interest shown by
the eating club. In' three sched
uled games. El Capitan has failed
to appear, thus causing forfeits to
further complicate the mural rec
ords.
In tonight's game, only one un
defeated record will risk a blemish,
although such a result would be
highly unlikely. The Law School,
masquerading as the Shysters, will
take its 2-0 record into a game with
Encina 4E at the Pavilion. By com-
scores, the league-leading
Shysters loom as favorites to whip
the third - place frosh, who have
dropped a lopsided decision to
A.T.O. The Shysters, meanwhile,
had little difficulty in dropping
A.T.O. by a 27-21 count, so should
win tonight.

Only 16 undefeated intramural basketball teams remained today, fol
lowing a drastic week of upsets which saw six teams pruned from the
select list. Upsets were the order of the week, with Delta Tau Delta's stun
ning 1-1-12 defeat at the hands of the Chi Psi's setting the keynote. En
ema's multiple entries felt the roughest turnabouts as three teams, lE, 2E,
and 4E, dropped their first decisions*

of the season. Meanwhile, El Toro
and the Kappa Sigs completed the
list, of teams losing their initial
game.
On the cheerful side of intramu
ral topics, three rugged power
houses seem to be ruling the pUiy.
In League I, the S.A.E.'s have
chalked up three effortless wins to
stamp themselves as championship
material. The Chi Psi's may dispute
such a claim as they have dupli
cated the 3-0 record in League 11,
despite the threatening Delts. And
to complete the trio of high win
ners, League 111 is still attempting
to halt the rush of the Zete A squad
which has yet to taste defeat in
three outings.
Intramural Director Gene Cold
iron stated that El Capitan has
been dropped from League I due
to the lack of interest shown by
the eating club. In' three sched
uled games. El Capitan has failed
to appear, thus causing forfeits to
further complicate the mural rec
ords.
In tonight's game, only one un
defeated record will risk a blemish,
although such a result would be
highly unlikely. The Law School,
masquerading as the Shysters, will
take its 2-0 record into a game with
Encina 4E at the Pavilion. By com-
scores, the league-leading
Shysters loom as favorites to whip
the third - place frosh, who have
dropped a lopsided decision to
A.T.O. The Shysters, meanwhile,
had little difficulty in dropping
A.T.O. by a 27-21 count, so should
win tonight.
