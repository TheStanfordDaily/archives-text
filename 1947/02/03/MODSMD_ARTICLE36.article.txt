# Indian Cagers Take Fourth Consecutive Game
## Locals Score Upset Over Favored Brones, Top Dons 
### ARTHUR SHAPIRO 
Displaying the finest brand of basketball seen in the Pavilion
since the ante-bellum year of 1940, the Indian cagers extended
their winning streak to four games by completely dominating
the court action over the week-end as they downed USF, 47-36,
on Friday, and upset the once-defeated Santa Clara quintet, 56-39,
the following evening.

Sparked by the sensational scor
ing of Morley Thompson who rack
ed up 20 counters during the Satur
day melee, and Dave Davidson who
countered 16 on Friday, the Indians
drove to twin victories in two well
fought and savagely contested frays.
With Captain Dave Davidson in
the hospitai. Coach Everett Dean
was forced to substitute Milt Iver
son for him before the Santa Clara
same got under way. The loss of
Davidson before the opening whis
tle threatened to thwart the Dean
men's chances of victory, but Milt
Iverson proved himself equal to
the task as he charged up and
down the court, dominating the
offensive game, and giving to the
Cards a fast break which was a
welcome sight.
Morley Thompson, the Prodigal
Son of the Stanford offense, finally
came home Saturday. Taking over
the offensive slot from the ailing
Davidson, Morley treated the spec
tators to a beautiful sight, and the
Cardinal live to 1(5 points within the
tirst thirteen minutes of action as he
uncorked a two-handed jumpshot
which swished through the hoop
without once touching the rim or
backboard.
MORLEY'S BEST GAME
It was Morley's finest game, and
one which heralds bigger and better
things from him in the future. Steve
Stephenson, the lanky Card Center,
once again .demonstrated his poten
tial All-Coast ability as he outplay
ed and outfought the Broncos' fam
ed center, Frank Laney. He con
stantly performed better under the
boards, and his guarding of the G
foot 5 1-2 Laney was so perfect that
the Bronco Bruiser was unable to
work the center slot with anything
resembling his normal precision.
Steve took away second scoring
honors in both games with 14 points
each evening, but was forced to
share that honor with Laney in the
second game who also rang up 14
markers, six of them from the foul
line.
Babe Higgins, moved up to the
backboard position because of the
absence of Davidson, wrestled the
ball away from the Santa Clarans
with a savage drive which at times
threatened to rip the arms of some
(tf the lower Peninsula hoys right
out of their sockets. Steadying the
Red Machine, during the few times
the Brones broke loose with a rash
of points. Babe ran the squad with
finesse, and was the complete mas
ter of every situation.
IVERSON COMES THROUGH
The surprise of the Saturday eve
ning set-to, was the fine ball hawk
ing and passing of the ex-bench
warmer, Milt Iverson, who stepped
into Dave Davidson's shoes, and fill
ed them completely. Obviously hold
ing himself in check and passing
away his scoring opportunities to
Mr. Red Hot, Morley Thompson, it
wasn't until the middle of the sec
ond half that Milt let go with some
shots for his lonesome, and they
went in, all eight points' worth.
Dick Berlin, the fifth member of
the new and rejuvenated Stanford
varsity, was obviously tired but
he managed to play a wonderfully
tight defensive game and with
Higgins managed to hold down the
Bronco forwards to a combined
total of eight points.
Four of the twenty-two field goals
garnered by the charges of Coach
Dean, came late in the game and

j were due to the efforts of the subs.
Lewis and Drehobl, the Shaggy Dog,
J teamed up with Iverson to work out
■ a fast break which netted two points
i for Lewis and six for Drehobl.
DONS TAKE EARLY LEAD
The Friday evening fracas start
ed with a flourish and ended with
bugles blaring. The Dons of San
Francisco jumped into the lead
with a foul shot by Ross Giudice
and then the see-saw began to
rock. Seven times the lead chang
ed hands, and four times things
were all knotted up in a dead heat
before the Cards started to open
up the white space between them
selves and the boys from Fulton
Street. With but three minutes
left in the first half the score stood
at 15 all. Nine points were sunk in
rapid succession and at half time
the local boys led, 24-15.
j * The second half was a breeze. The
lead was stretched to 14 points with
| ten minutes to play. The reserves
entered the game at that time and
matched point for point with the
Don starters. Drehobl, Lewis, Cha
valas, and Iverson totaled eight
counters and kept the door closed on
i the Dons as they struggled to enter
| the game with a flurry of baskets
j against the second string.

work the center slot with anything
resembling his normal precision.
Steve took away second scoring
honors in both games with 14 points
each evening, but was forced to
share that honor with Laney in the
second game who also rang up 14
markers, six of them from the foul
line.
Babe Higgins, moved up to the
backboard position because of the
absence of Davidson, wrestled the
ball away from the Santa Clarans
with a savage drive which at times
threatened to rip the arms of some
(tf the lower Peninsula hoys right
out of their sockets. Steadying the
Red Machine, during the few times
the Brones broke loose with a rash
of points. Babe ran the squad with
finesse, and was the complete mas
ter of every situation.
IVERSON COMES THROUGH
The surprise of the Saturday eve
ning set-to, was the fine ball hawk
ing and passing of the ex-bench
warmer, Milt Iverson, who stepped
into Dave Davidson's shoes, and fill
ed them completely. Obviously hold
ing himself in check and passing
away his scoring opportunities to
Mr. Red Hot, Morley Thompson, it
wasn't until the middle of the sec
ond half that Milt let go with some
shots for his lonesome, and they
went in, all eight points' worth.
Dick Berlin, the fifth member of
the new and rejuvenated Stanford
varsity, was obviously tired but
he managed to play a wonderfully
tight defensive game and with
Higgins managed to hold down the
Bronco forwards to a combined
total of eight points.
Four of the twenty-two field goals
garnered by the charges of Coach
Dean, came late in the game and

j were due to the efforts of the subs.
Lewis and Drehobl, the Shaggy Dog,
J teamed up with Iverson to work out
■ a fast break which netted two points
i for Lewis and six for Drehobl.
DONS TAKE EARLY LEAD
The Friday evening fracas start
ed with a flourish and ended with
bugles blaring. The Dons of San
Francisco jumped into the lead
with a foul shot by Ross Giudice
and then the see-saw began to
rock. Seven times the lead chang
ed hands, and four times things
were all knotted up in a dead heat
before the Cards started to open
up the white space between them
selves and the boys from Fulton
Street. With but three minutes
left in the first half the score stood
at 15 all. Nine points were sunk in
rapid succession and at half time
the local boys led, 24-15.
j * The second half was a breeze. The
lead was stretched to 14 points with
| ten minutes to play. The reserves
entered the game at that time and
matched point for point with the
Don starters. Drehobl, Lewis, Cha
valas, and Iverson totaled eight
counters and kept the door closed on
i the Dons as they struggled to enter
| the game with a flurry of baskets
j against the second string.
Displaying the finest brand of basketball seen in the Pavilion
since the ante-bellum year of 1940, the Indian cagers extended
their winning streak to four games by completely dominating
the court action over the week-end as they downed USF, 47-36,
on Friday, and upset the once-defeated Santa Clara quintet, 56-39,
the following evening.

Sparked by the sensational scor
ing of Morley Thompson who rack
ed up 20 counters during the Satur
day melee, and Dave Davidson who
countered 16 on Friday, the Indians
drove to twin victories in two well
fought and savagely contested frays.
With Captain Dave Davidson in
the hospitai. Coach Everett Dean
was forced to substitute Milt Iver
son for him before the Santa Clara
same got under way. The loss of
Davidson before the opening whis
tle threatened to thwart the Dean
men's chances of victory, but Milt
Iverson proved himself equal to
the task as he charged up and
down the court, dominating the
offensive game, and giving to the
Cards a fast break which was a
welcome sight.
Morley Thompson, the Prodigal
Son of the Stanford offense, finally
came home Saturday. Taking over
the offensive slot from the ailing
Davidson, Morley treated the spec
tators to a beautiful sight, and the
Cardinal live to 1(5 points within the
tirst thirteen minutes of action as he
uncorked a two-handed jumpshot
which swished through the hoop
without once touching the rim or
backboard.
MORLEY'S BEST GAME
It was Morley's finest game, and
one which heralds bigger and better
things from him in the future. Steve
Stephenson, the lanky Card Center,
once again .demonstrated his poten
tial All-Coast ability as he outplay
ed and outfought the Broncos' fam
ed center, Frank Laney. He con
stantly performed better under the
boards, and his guarding of the G

and then the see-saw began to
rock. Seven times the lead chang
ed hands, and four times things
were all knotted up in a dead heat
before the Cards started to open
up the white space between them
selves and the boys from Fulton
Street. With but three minutes
left in the first half the score stood
at 15 all. Nine points were sunk in
rapid succession and at half time
the local boys led, 24-15.
j * The second half was a breeze. The
lead was stretched to 14 points with
| ten minutes to play. The reserves
entered the game at that time and
matched point for point with the
Don starters. Drehobl, Lewis, Cha
valas, and Iverson totaled eight
counters and kept the door closed on
i the Dons as they struggled to enter
| the game with a flurry of baskets
j against the second string.
Displaying the finest brand of basketball seen in the Pavilion
since the ante-bellum year of 1940, the Indian cagers extended
their winning streak to four games by completely dominating
the court action over the week-end as they downed USF, 47-36,
on Friday, and upset the once-defeated Santa Clara quintet, 56-39,
the following evening.

Sparked by the sensational scor
ing of Morley Thompson who rack
ed up 20 counters during the Satur
day melee, and Dave Davidson who
countered 16 on Friday, the Indians
drove to twin victories in two well
fought and savagely contested frays.
With Captain Dave Davidson in
the hospitai. Coach Everett Dean
was forced to substitute Milt Iver
son for him before the Santa Clara
same got under way. The loss of
Davidson before the opening whis
tle threatened to thwart the Dean
men's chances of victory, but Milt
Iverson proved himself equal to
the task as he charged up and
down the court, dominating the
offensive game, and giving to the
Cards a fast break which was a
welcome sight.
Morley Thompson, the Prodigal
Son of the Stanford offense, finally
came home Saturday. Taking over
the offensive slot from the ailing
Davidson, Morley treated the spec
tators to a beautiful sight, and the
Cardinal live to 1(5 points within the
tirst thirteen minutes of action as he
uncorked a two-handed jumpshot
which swished through the hoop
without once touching the rim or
backboard.
MORLEY'S BEST GAME
It was Morley's finest game, and
one which heralds bigger and better
things from him in the future. Steve
Stephenson, the lanky Card Center,
once again .demonstrated his poten
tial All-Coast ability as he outplay
ed and outfought the Broncos' fam
ed center, Frank Laney. He con
stantly performed better under the
boards, and his guarding of the G
foot 5 1-2 Laney was so perfect that
the Bronco Bruiser was unable to
work the center slot with anything
resembling his normal precision.
Steve took away second scoring
honors in both games with 14 points
each evening, but was forced to
share that honor with Laney in the
second game who also rang up 14
markers, six of them from the foul
line.
Babe Higgins, moved up to the
backboard position because of the
absence of Davidson, wrestled the
ball away from the Santa Clarans
with a savage drive which at times
threatened to rip the arms of some
(tf the lower Peninsula hoys right
out of their sockets. Steadying the
Red Machine, during the few times
the Brones broke loose with a rash
of points. Babe ran the squad with
finesse, and was the complete mas
ter of every situation.
IVERSON COMES THROUGH
The surprise of the Saturday eve
ning set-to, was the fine ball hawk
ing and passing of the ex-bench
warmer, Milt Iverson, who stepped
into Dave Davidson's shoes, and fill
ed them completely. Obviously hold
ing himself in check and passing
away his scoring opportunities to
Mr. Red Hot, Morley Thompson, it
wasn't until the middle of the sec
ond half that Milt let go with some
shots for his lonesome, and they
went in, all eight points' worth.
Dick Berlin, the fifth member of
the new and rejuvenated Stanford
varsity, was obviously tired but
he managed to play a wonderfully
tight defensive game and with
Higgins managed to hold down the
Bronco forwards to a combined
total of eight points.
Four of the twenty-two field goals
garnered by the charges of Coach
Dean, came late in the game and

j were due to the efforts of the subs.
Lewis and Drehobl, the Shaggy Dog,
J teamed up with Iverson to work out
■ a fast break which netted two points
i for Lewis and six for Drehobl.
DONS TAKE EARLY LEAD
The Friday evening fracas start
ed with a flourish and ended with
bugles blaring. The Dons of San
Francisco jumped into the lead
