### WILLIAM HACHTEN 
The Stanford rugby team lost a close decision to the Petaluma Ameri
can Legion Saturday afternoon by a score of 6 to 3 on the Intramural Field.
It was an evenly played contest which saw both teams score in the first
half, and only Spallatta of Petaluma rang the bell in the second stanza.

Petaluma scored early in the *
game when Acorne, center three
quarters, made a penalty kick 25
yards out at a difficult angle for
three points.
Stanford's score was set up by a
45-yard run by A 1 Morris, who in
turn lateraled to Fred Willey when
he was stopped.
The ball stayed deep in the Peta
luma territory for several minutes
while the scrums sought possession
of the ball. Then Marty Feldman,
gigantic lock, picked up the ball on
the 10-yard line and drove across
the goal for a try.
Spectators were somewhat sur
prised to find Forrest Hall, U.S.F.
halfback, playing wing for the Le
gion team. Hall, however, was ob
viously new to the game and was
bottled ii]) ail afternoon by the
Reds.
During the second half, both teams
muffed several scoring chances. Af
ter threatening the Stanford goal for
some time, Bill Spalatta picked up
the ball and scored a try.
