## 
### 
Mr. Harold Fisher, director of the
Hoover War Library, recently an
nounced that he has sent sixty 1947
Cap and Gown Calendars to collec
tors all over the world.
The calendars, issued yearly by
the senior women's honorary soci
ety, are filled with photographs of
typical Stanford scenes.
Thank-you letters coming back
from Europe and the Far East, state
that many of the young people who
have seen the calendars expressed
the desire to come to Stanford.
