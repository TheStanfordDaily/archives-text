# Bible Aids Daily Lives

### CHAPLAIN HALL 
IHatt. 6:33â€”"But seek ye first
His kingdom and His righteous
ness, and all these things shall be
added unto you."
Each clay during this week I shall
try to take a well-known verse of
the Bible and tell you what it means
to me in the hope that it may bo of
some help to you in your daily lives.
These are not meant to be sermons
but are meant to be thoughts ex
pressed aloud, as it were, for the
purpose of starting some thinking
along spiritual lives not only for the
week but for the rest of our lives.
This interpretation, because it
has meant much to me, I should
like to share with you.
A correspondence school offers a
course to sales managers on "How
to Break Down Sales Resistance."
Stuart Chase comments that one of
America's greatest needs is a man
who can teach effectively a course
on ''How to Build Up Sales Resis
tance." In a world so filled with
the blazing, booming advertisements
urging us to buy, buy, buy, we need
a strong will and a strong spirit to
keep from being snowed under and
therefore imprisoned by a shower
of things. It seems to me that Jesus
offers that will and has spirit neces
sary to redeem human life from the
dominance of things. Not to have
the things which money cannot buy
is stark tragedy. ' Seek ye first His
kingdom and His righteousness."
