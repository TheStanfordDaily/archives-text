# Spotlights Bathe Ibsen
## 
### 
Lights will be featured in the
stage setting of the playreading
of "John Gabriel Borkman" by
Henrik Ibsen, which will be given
Wednesday night at 8:15 in the
Little Theater,
The set will consist of four
small tables, big enough for two
people apiece. Since most of the
scenes arc between two people,
lights will be turned on the table
belonging to the speakers, and
when the scene is changed, the
lights will be turned on the table
where another pair are speaking.
The leads in this serious tragedy
of a bankrupt financier are played
by Dr. Lee E. Bassett, the emeritus
head of the Speech and Drama De
partment, Elaine Maltzman, who
played Mrs. Cynthia Karslake in
the reading of "The New York Idea"
two weeks ago, and Mrs. A. Lea
velle, wife of A. B. Leavelle, profes
sor of political science at Stanford.
Tickets may be obtained for
cents in Room 201, Memorial Hall,
or by calling P.A. 22041.
