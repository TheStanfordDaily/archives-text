# 'Keep Controls' Truman Asks

### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 (UP).—
President Truman asked Congress
today for another year of control
over scarce sugar, foods, industrial
materials and shipping, hut cau
tious Republican leaders said he
would have to justify any emer
gency war powers he wants re
tained.
In a message to Congress, Mr.
| Truman sought extension of three
sections of the Second War Powers
{ Act, which expires 'March 31. These
j are necessary, he said, because of
j the critical domestic and world situ
| ation in relation to foods and mate
j rials.
MUST SHOW NEED
In addition, lie wants the Mari-
J time Commission to continue opera
; tion of certain shipping lines for an
j other year, and to keep navigation
! regulations relaxed until the troops
| abroad are returned home.
I Sen. Alexander Wiley, I?., Wis.,
| chairman of the Senate Judiciary
: Committee, and Chairman Earl C.
| Michener, E., Mich., oi the House
| Judiciary Committee — the groups
| which will handle the extension
legislation—said they would have to
i be shown that the emergency war
j powers still are needed.
WILL KEEP ESSENTIAL
"The entire matter of emergency
j powers has got to be studied fully
i before we lake any action," Wiley
j said. "We've got to look not only
j into the powers that we want to
j shove out the window, but those it
j is necessary to hold on to for a
j while."
Michcner said that "if (he Presi
l dent requires the continuation of
| war powers, he will be given an op
| portunity to show the necessity.
| These all were intended as emer
i gcncy war powers, and those .should
remain which are essential to the
! functioning of the government."
Sen. Robert A. Taft, 1?., 0., chair
: man of the Senate Republican Pol
! icy Committee, said last week that
| "most Republicans appear opposed"
j to renewing the Second War Powers
! Act, but that "the government's al
| location and rationing powers over
i sugar and rubber probably will he
j continued in separate legislative
: measures."
REPORT 15V MARCH I".
Wiley said he believed his study
} would "require some time." He be
j lieved that his resolution providing
j for a study of war powers by each
j standing committee would "help
clear the air."
| The resolution, now before the
Rules Committee, would require
j each committee to report its finding
and recommendations to the Judi
-1 ciary Committee not later than
March 15.
"1 had the impression from a talk
j with the President a while back that
I this was the way he wanted the
i matter handled," Wilev said.
