# 'Inadequate Transportation' Blamed for China Famines
## 
### 
"Inadequate transportation facili
ties and lack of latent purchasing
power are to blame for the many
famines that have swept China in
the last centuries," .said Mr. John
Earl Baker, internationally known
expert on Chinese transportation
problems, yesterday before mem- I
bers and guests of the Chinese- j
American Friendship Group on
"How to Wipe China OfT the Fam
ine Map."
"Crops in China depend upon sea- i
sonal rains which come in May and
September. When there is no rain,
or when there is too much rain dur
ing one period, a famine occurs. In
America this can be prevented by
importing foodstuffs from other un
affected regions. In China, how
ever, this cannot, be done even
though there may be a big surplus
of crops a few hundred miles away,
for these cannot he transported to
the threatened area in time to halt
the disaster.
"The average Chine.se farmer has
no latent purchasing power to carry
him through lean years. His aver
age holding is less than four acres.
When he borrows, it is in time of
need and he must pay exorbitant
interest rates up to 100 per cent an
nually. The result is that 30 to 40
per cent are now tenant farmers."
INCREASE PRODUCTION
"Increased production, improve
ment of distribution, and stabiliza
tion of the population are the basic
factors in the control and preven
tion of future famines," said Baker.
A R C. DIRECTOR
Mr. Baker was a director of the
American Red Cross in China dur
ing the 920's. As director of Fam
ine Relief transportation he initiated
the plan whereby relief was given
to the needy in the form of paying
jobs building roads. To alleviate
conditions in famine areas, trans
portation rates to affected areas
were cut- and prices of basic foods
allowed to rise in order to attract
more imports.
LOANS REPAID
To prevent future famines, co
operative credit societies were set

up which loaned money at low rates.
"It is a credit to the Chinese that
97 to 99 per cent of the money
loaned was repaid,"' he said.
"Birth control meets with no
opposition. Nine hundred public
health clinics were opened during
the war. These were centers for the
dissemination of information on
public health."
NEED OF RAILWAYS
When asked about transportation
needs in China today, Baker said
that China must base its transporta
tion on trunk lines of railroads and
deep waterways and branch lines
of motor highways.
"Passenger traffic should be elim
inated on the railways! First and
second class travel should go by
airplane. It Is just as cheap to ship
light-weight traffic by plane as it
would be by pony back."
LEAVE ALONE
With regard to the; present situa
tion in China, Baker suggests we
"Let the people that arc doing it,
do it. We must let the Chinese
pioneer things out for themselves."
Next meeting of the Chinese-
American Friendship Group will be
held on Monday, Feb. 7, when Dr.
James Watkins of the Political Sci
ence Department will speak on the
foreign policy toward China.
