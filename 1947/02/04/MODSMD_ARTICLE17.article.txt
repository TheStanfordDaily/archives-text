The Honor Code and the Fundr>-
j mental Standard—vital and endur
| ing statements of personal and
J group integrity-are two of Stan
j ford's oldest traditions. They are
nearly always the most impressive
I part, of student life to newcomers.
Stanford students are most con-
I scious of the Honor Code in their
j daily classroom work, which is to
I be done independently. The Stand
| aid, as phrased by Dr. Jordan, Stan
! ford's first president, applies to the
student in all pjiascs of his life.
| Everything ho does reflects on the
I University and is subject to disci
j plinary action by the Councils as
they interpret the Standard, as are
i violators of the Code.
MORE STANDARD VIOLATIONS
| There have been 19 violations of
I the Fundamental Standard and one
i Honor Code violation among women
this year, according to Carol Kel
| logg, chairman of Women's Council.
! Questioned as to the reason for the
i difference in the number of viola
tions, Miss Kellogg said that viola
i tions of the Fundamental Standard
(i.e., "conduct unbecoming a Stan
! ford student") are more obvious.
"Although people are inclined to
pass over Code- violations, 112 do not
j really think there are as many of
them as Standard violations," she
| declared.
Infractions of the Standard, as re
ported 'by students, result in the
I violators being placed on social
. "pro," which that all their
! actions are subject to review by
! the Council.
APATHY AND INDIFFERENCE
Social Regulations violations, re
! suiting in the too-familiar lock-ins,
which make up the majority of
Women'.; Council's work, are treat
jed under separate disciplinary
] measures than violations of either
| the Standard or the Code.
"I think the efTect of the increased
j enrollment has been largely in the
changed attitude toward the Stand
ard and the Code. Students show a
; great apytby and indifference to
| them now. There is too much gen
eral talk about something wrong,
j and not enough conclusive state
i ments as to bow they can be reme
died," stated Miss Kellogg.
WORK OF COUNCIL
"The basic organization of the
j Councils is fine, I think, but they
! can be made more effective. We are
! attempting to do that by (1) ehang-
I ing our jurisdiction so as to give
J Council representatives more re
j sponsibilil.y, and make Council more
j of an appeal body; and (2) by mak
ing Council more of an educative
than a punitive body by disseminat
ing more information concerning
I our activities."'
M°n's Council Chairman John
j Church stated that the Council has
! handled about four or five Funda
' mental Standard violations and six
i Honor Code violations since last fall.
DI E TO HINDRANCE
Violators of the Fundamental
| Standard are placed on social "pro,"
J which means they cannot represent
| Stanford in any way. They are
| subject to suspension on their next
I offense. Honor Code violators are
j usually suspended from the Univer-
I si ty for a quarter or more. All sus
j pensions, both men and women, are
j subject to review by the President
! of the University.
"The majority of the Honor Code
| violations are due to students' ig
' norance of the Code," stated Church.
"The Honor Code Standing Com
mittee is circulating a questionnaire
this week concerning the Code
i which we hope will emphasize it ;
i importance to the student body. I,
personally, feel that most students
| are observing the Honor Code."
Student control Was not always
in such evidence.
In 15)04 those people who felt the
I proctoring system then in force was
an affront to student, integrity pro-
I posed an honor system. It failed
bccause there was no provision for
I student control.

MORE STANDARD VIOLATIONS

i Honor Code violation among women
this year, according to Carol Kel

(i.e., "conduct unbecoming a Stan

"Although people are inclined to

j really think there are as many of
them as Standard violations," she

APATHY AND INDIFFERENCE
Social Regulations violations, re

"I think the efTect of the increased

DI E TO HINDRANCE
Violators of the Fundamental

J which means they cannot represent
