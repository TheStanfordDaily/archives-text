## Whom Can We Trust? 
### 
Women's Conference invited Dean Stalna
ker to speak. While we, and a number of
others, protested implications of what he said,
we feel a definite thank you is due him for
telling us things about Stanford we wanted to
know.
Unless we can demonstrate our willingness
sensibly to talk over with Administration olfi
cials'those things in their policies to which we
object, we will in the future have no oppor
tunity to criticize at all. Dr. Tresidder, Mr.
Stalnaker, Mr. Brandin, and other officials will
hesitate to speak openly at our meetings un
less we can approach them and their philoso
phies with a level headed attitude; the com
munity spirit which must pievail lor the satis
fy lory running of a university will not come
.'ibOut through the use of brickbats.
Trust is a thing which is built up slowly, and
judging from the numbers of students who
bellow about Administration actions, trust
does not yet prevail among all elements in
this University. It is our feeling, after being
given the opportunity to examine university
books, to speak with officials at any time on
.juy subject, and to offer our opinions without
icar of being excommunicated, th• <t students
who negatively protest all things approved by
the Administration are way off base in their
sentiments.
But the fact remains that student opinions
have not and cannot accurately be taken into
<!-■count by the Administration, because the
(.ific inls have for the most part neither sought

student opinion, nor have the students been
willing to give it in a sensible way. Threats,
protesis, petitions, behind-the-hand griping
are not the road toward the trust we so ur
gently require.
What's the answer? A large-scale public
relations program in the University between
students and Administration — a program
which has been greatly neglected and habitu
ally dismissed as unimportant.
For the Administration, this would mean
issuing regular statements of policy and Uni
versity aims. It would include issuing the
real facts and motives behind the ultimatum
like pronouncements given to students from
Administration offices—reasons The Daily has
often tried to supply, but which are coldly in
effective in a cut-and-dried news story. It
would mean holding regular open meetings,
at least once monthly, at which students can
discuss with officials the issues bothering
them.
And the students must reciprocate with the
willingness to listen to the Administration
viewpoint, to seek Administration advice, to
talk sensibly at guest dinners, in offices, over
projects which the students are planninq. The
student pait includes asking officials to speak
before Women's Confeience
No solution to differences can be jeached
until both sides aie informed of facts, and un
til both are willing to sit down over n confer
ence table.
Then we can start building up a little mu
tual trust.
