# With a Small 'r'
## 
### 
This is Spiritual Emphasis Week.
For the first time in Stanford history, a con
certed effort is being made to give force to
the purpose and reason behind the building
of Memorial Church. That purpose and rea
son, as stated by Mrs. Stanford, was that the
Church should be the center of every stu
dent's life at Stanfordâ€”not as a sectarian,
dogma-bound institution, but rather as an area
of spiritual comfort, inspiration, and idealism
.ivailable to and made use of by all of us.
Yet what does Memorial Church mean to us
today? It is a beautiful building, a "must see"
on the lists of thousands of tourists; it is a
place to which a few of us, a very few, go
each Sunday for some outward form of wor
ship at least. To the vast majority of Stanford
students, it means nothing more.
And as surely as the Church occupies the
physical center of the Stanford plant, so as
surely does it not occupy a spiritual center in
our lives here.
Why? Because, in the words of Chaplain

George J. Hall, students think of Memorial
Church as Religion with a capital 'R,' rather
than as religion with a small 'r.' And religion
with a small 'r' is the faith, hope, charity, and
love that form the basis of the teachings of
Jesus.
The talks, radio programs, Church services,
and movie being given as part of the Spiritual
Emphasis Week program will attempt to point
the way to the small V of religion. Students
will have to seek the significance and impor
tance of spirituality before they can know it.
And, if a few do grasp its meaning, the pro
gram of Spiritual Emphasis will not have been
undertaken in vain.
For, as Mrs. Stanford wrote to the women
of Stanford in 1903: "What is more pitiful than
to meet a highly educated, cultural boy or girl,
man or woman, who is utterly devoid of any
sense of obligation to an all-wise, heavenly
Father for the many blessings bestowed upon
the children of Earth?"
