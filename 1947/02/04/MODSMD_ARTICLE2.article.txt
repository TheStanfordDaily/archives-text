# Hall Decries Mental Ideals
## 
### CHAPLAIN HALL 
Luke 2:s2â€”"And Jesus increased
in wisdom and stature and in favor
with God and man."
One of the secrets of successful
living is to maintain a growing edge
to the mind after the growing edge
of the body has disappeared. I have
often thought it was tragic that the
"soft" spot in our heads gets hard
so quickly for many of us lose our
ability to grow mentally and spirit
ually at the same time we lose our
soft spots.
A person knows when he has lost
his wealth; he isn't always conscious
of the fact he has lost an opportu
nity to help his fellowman. He
knows an opportunity to help his
fellowman. He knows when he has
lost a loved one but isn't so sure
when he has lost his own lovable
ncss.

Arnold Grunnigan, Jr., vice
president of the Inter - nation
Christian Businessmen's Commit
tee, will he the second speaker for
Spiritual Emphasis Week tomor
row night at 8 p.m. in Cuhherley
Auditorium. His topic will he
"Christianity Works."
Mr. Grunnigan, a nationwide
speaker, will explain to Stanford
students the correlation of Chris
tian principles to business life.

A penny will tell him when his
body stops growing, but there are
no scales lo tell him when his mind
and spirit stop growing. To main
lain life's growing edge is to grow
in wisdom, and in favor, with God
and man. One can be sure he is
doing that if he is making an hon
est effort to accept Christ's invita
tion, "Follow me."
