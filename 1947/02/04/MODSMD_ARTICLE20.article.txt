John Stalnaker, of "You don't have to call me
Dean, call ine Mr. Stalnaker" fame, seems to have
caused quite a furor on campus with his last week's
speech on student conduct and student interference
m administration alTairs.
But far more 'Entertaining was the list of ques
tions that Mr. Stalnaker appended to his talk, and to
which he requested answers. Well. Dean, you set
'■•Hi up and I'll knock 'em down. But I can't top
that remark that actually "the lights have been that
way for some time," as a valid reason for the poor
libe lighting. That's a howl, Dean. You're tremen
dous. ' ■' r
Well, let's go over that list of questions:
Does the Daily present the news fairly? Is it
ihe kind of a newspaper you want il to ba? What
are you doing about it?
Well, I swept the floor day before yesterday.
That helped a little. >
Is the Honor Code effective? -
Darn right it is. When it's applied where it
should be applied, (o academics and not to late
leaves, smoking on Quad, and drinking. If you'd
talk to anyone going to U.C.L.A. or cal, they'd
quickly tell you what a difference there is be

tween those schools where exams are monitored
and Stanford where they aren't. Cheating be
comes a game under their system and a disgrace
under ours. Darn right the Honor Code works.
Is Excom representative of student government?
Why is there such lethargy in that government?
Perhaps if the administration didn't seem to be
making such a farce out of student government,
there wouldn't be so much lethargy.
What is your opinion of the elections?
It was a Republican landslide.
Is the conduct at the firesides what it should be,
and what you want it to be?
Certainly not. It's terrible and something should
he done about it. Such action should be immediate.
There are far too many lights.
Was the Gaieties something that you wanted to
represent Stanford?
I understand that you stated if was the dirtiest
show you've seen in your life. Well. I guess maybe
life at Ivy League Princeton is pretty dull. ,1
thought (he (iaieties were good. Hut then > I'm
prejudiced, I write a dirty column.
What are the study conditions in the living
groups? Why is there more noise than ever before?
Because there arc more people than anybody.
