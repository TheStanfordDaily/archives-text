# CAMPUS OPINION

To the Editor:
Certainly Stanford's campus is one of the most
beautilul in the United States, but I would like to
propose something that would add to the beauty of
the present campus. Let's plant a lawn in the Inn or
Quad. This would immeasurably enhance the beauty
of this large cloister and would be a far more pleas
ing sight to students and campus visitors than the
present drab, grey gravel that becomes one huge
puddle in the winter.

The problem of no! being iihle to cut across tlie
Quad if mass were growing there could be solved
by putting in a few diagonal walks like those already
in use in the Memorial Court. The financing of such
a project would be simple: take from each student's
tuition fee one dollar for one quarter. That would
provide an initial fund of $7,200. I personally would
very much like to see an empty spot in our campus
filled by planting a lawn on the Inner Quad.
