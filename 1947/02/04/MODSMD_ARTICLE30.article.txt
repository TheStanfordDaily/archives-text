# China Eggs Stand on End
## 
### 
SHANGHAI, Tues., Feb. 4 (UP).
— Kggs stood on end by the dozens
in Shanghai last night as dabblers
in the occult successfully tested a
gem of ancient Chinese lore.
Legend has it that eggs will stand
on end—either end—at the moment
of the beginning of the mystic sea
son of Lih-Chun, the Chinese lunar
spring, which came 15 minutes be
fore midnight.
So many people had bought eggs
for the- test that the price jumped

to 600 Chinese dollars per egg.
This correspondent saw eggs bal
anced on mirrors, plates and pol
ished table tops and photographs
were taken to prove it.
' Operation Eggstand" took place
at the home of Mimmy Wei, Min
istry of Information Office director,
instead of the city temple as sched
uled, because of a heavy snow. The
change of plans apparently made
no difference to the eggs, which
teetered, on end in defiance of any
laws written by Sir Isaac Newton.
