## CARD STUNTS The 						Tears Are Flowing Like Wine; Davis & blanchard Couldn't Sign! 
### 
Sports' writers (and others) all over the hereabouts and thereabouts
are screaming their fool heads off about this Davis-Blanehard football
affair. You can hardly turn a page these serene mornings without finding
the whole hierarchy of athletic specialists turning various colors in their
collective faces as they let off enough steam to fog my glasses.
The West Coast scribes are using up typewriter ribbon after ribbon
blasting the army, the brass hats, and what have you for not letting the
gold dust twins have a little four-month furlough to play pro ball. All
over the country you can hear scattered moans of anguish, but look care
fully and you'll find that the most concentrated attack is coming from the
general neighborhood of San Francisco.
And what else could you expect? It's the San Francisco 49'ors who are
losing (heir biggest pot of gold they ever chanced to face, and if I may
misquote my friend Confucius "he who gets hurt hollers the loudest."
And as a matter of fact there's a good reason why most sports writers
would have to stick to the pros' side of the fence. It's simply because the
pros are important copy to the scribes —being big sports news.
The case of Davis and Blanchard (and Poole) has only been given one
sided coverage by the sportsmen; you'll have to look far and high before
you'll find any good answers given by the Academy's big shots. All the
brass lias had to say has by necessity been in the form of curt, straight
statements of decision and policy. Kisking the ultimate in name-calling,
I lake the stand and present the case of the Academy to the jury.
In This Corner, II curing Khaki . . .
West Point is a military university, and since the field of military sci
ence is varied and universal, this institution only gives a degree in military
science and tactics, which is a bachelor of science equivalent. This degree
has a high standing, and some authorities rate it closer the equivalent of a
master's degree.
Like so many other institutions of higher learning all over the country
- without mentioning any other particular names—the Academy feels that
the athletic program is of great value to the general education being given
its future officers. Like many others, they permit previous football back
ground to influence somewhat their admittance decisions. But they have
more obvious reasons for doing so than the schools who draw football
players for mercenary and prestige excuses.
The training on the gridiron has more pertinent value for a future
Army officer than it does for a future lawyer, scientist, or business man.
And this is one of the points overlooked by so many scribes.
Some sports writers outdo themselves in accusing Army of operating
a football club that is as much professional as the real clubs in the All-
America Conference. But they should not forget that the Academy oper
ates on a slightly different principle than other schools. When you join the
Academy you sign an agreement to remain with the forces for a given
time period after graduation; the spirit of this agreement extends way
beyond that period, and it is expected that the cadet will devote the rest
of his able years to the service. This is in exchange for the excellent free
education, and with the expectation of a well-paid, secure future. No war
anticipated, of course.
Other schools collect tuition fees (and how), and guarantee no future
job. Therefore they are selling their facilities to those considered most
eligible. At West Point, the potential cadet is selling his service to Uncle
Sam and those entrusted with using the Armed Forces to back up our
policies.
lake Away Those Sliiny Dollars!
When Davis and Blanchard signed for the Academy they got a good
deal all around. They went to school, played plenty of football, no ex
penses, have a good job lined up if you like being a shavetail with the occu
pation forces. If you say they don't like an occupation force job. I'll answer
by asking you just why they signed with the Academy in the first place.
II they signed only to play ball, they shouldn't have signed.
Returning to the West Coast nucleus of tearful "why didn't you let
them play" cries, I can see why the hoys arc shedding those terrillic
splashes. The 49'ers lost 'em. so San Francisco should cry. What with the
10'ers almost entirely backed by 'Frisco money, it's a big loss to local
circles. But the scope of this affair reaches further than just the area
around the Golden Gate.
Professional sports have taken a terrific boom during the last few years,
and already in the short term of their existence they have caused trouble
in the normal run of athletic affairs. They have gone around college cam
puses and made unreasonably high offers to young players. The result

was obvious, and the threat of col
lege sportsters draining to the pro
fields before completing their stud
ies is still with us. This trend has
done a lot to degrade the fine char
acter of intercollegiate games.
As far as the D & B twin case is
concerned, pros have taken no ac
tive part for which they could be :
blamed, but their very potential of- \
ler was the cause of the whole stink.
Pro ball should keep its coin-j in -
,ulinf» away from campuses and mil
itary academies, except when look
ing over future material that might
one day be legitimate job-hunters.
Lot college kids finish school, and
let the Academy do its job as per
agreement.
The type of offers professional !
clubs make are so heavily dollar
weighted that they are almost ir
resistible for most young athletes. |
The $ sign lias great attraction, as
we all know, and its power should j
not he exerted to interfere with |
the normal course of the athlete's j
life.

More shooting nows. Just can't |
seem to get my discharge from the |
Army today—sticky outfit.
Stanford's ROTC unit has plans
under way to erect a new ride
range near the old motor vehicle
park down hy the stables. Sgt.
Tolliver — nr< relation to Sgt.
Slinger —is running this show,
which will train an Indian team
to represent the local HOTC in
intercollegiate rifle competition.
Practice with the .150 and .22-cal
ibcr rifles should he under way |
before the (yid of this quarter if !
all goes well.
The rifle team will undoubtedly
be the strongest squad among the
many Farm outfits if it ever comes
to intra-campus clashes; that is if
they have enough ammunition. Of j
course there isn't much they can do j
to Card Stunts—it's all shot to hell ,
already.
Won't he long now—ready on
the right, ready on the left, ready
on the firing line—remember?
