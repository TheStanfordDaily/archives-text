KERRVILLE, Texas, Feb. 3 (UP).
â€”The rules committee of the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion today approved seven changes
in regulations for football in the
1947 season.
1. The 160-foot-wide field will be
divided into three equal portions,
and the 15-yards-inbounds line will
be moved 32 inches toward the
field' s center.
2. Each team will be allowed one
substitution while the clock is run
ning.
3. The offensive shift rule was re
modeled. Under the change, if a
shift play is made involving two or
more players and is mistaken for a
regular play, it will be ruled a false
start.
4. If a kick is attempted for a
point after touchdown, only suc
cessful completion of the kick will
be allowed to result in an extra
point.
5. Rules concerning illegal use of
hands and arms were rewritten.
G. The distance for penalty in
disqualification fouls was reduced
to 15 yards.
7. All penalties will be inflicted
at the point where infractions occur
except in the case of illegal use of
hands or unnecessary roughness af
ter the ball is kicked across the line
of scrimmage and before it is
touched by any player.
