# Rejuvenated Cards Tackle S.C. Cagers This Weekend
## 
### 
Returning to conference basketball wars after two weeks of
non-league play, the "New" Red Machine heads south Thursday
to tackle the winless Southern California Trojans. A double win
over the Figueroa Street cagers and the Indians will have a .500
average, together with a fighting chance to cut themselves in on
the conference cake.

The wins over USF and Santa 4
Clara this past week-end gave the I
Dean-men a new start on life, and j
produced some vital and encourag- {
ing information on the abilities of !
the subs. No longer will the Cardi
nals be forced to go through the
"iron man" stunt of playing five men
against ten or twelve for the oppo
sition.
RESERVES PROVE ABILITY
Milt Iverson, Gus Chavalas, Bill
Drehobl, and Bob Lewis cam#
through in crucial moments proving
their ability to move into any con
test and hold their own against the
best the other squad could muster.
A special nod must be given to Mill i
Iverson for his showing in Satur- j
day's fracas with the Broncs. Spark- !
ing the offense with clever ball han
dling and passing, Milt brought the
house to its feet when he broke for
the basket in one of the few exam
ples of a fast break seen at the Pa
vilion this season.
DREIIORL NOTCHES TEN
Bill Drehobl. who has been off and
on the starting lineup all year, broke
into the games against USF and
Santa Clara for a few minutes, but I
did manage to total ten points, j
Those came when the chips were <
down and the visitors were fighting 1
desperately to close the gap in the
waning minutes of play.
Another welcome sight on the
court was the appearance of Bob
Lewis subbing for Steve Stephenson
at the center slot. Having worked
all the home games without a rest,
Steve was beginning to show signs
of weakening under the pressure.
The emergence of Lewis as a cen
ter holds forth hope that Stephen
son may now be able to be rested
during the less crucial moments of
play to insure his maximum effici- j
ency when the going gets tough.
The coming into full stature of j
the reserves and the steady play of i
the regulars, as demonstrated over
the week-end, brings into the realm
of possibility the theory that the In
dians may return to the Farm come
next Sunday a game out of the top
spot and only a half game behind
the second-place Bruins of UCLA.
