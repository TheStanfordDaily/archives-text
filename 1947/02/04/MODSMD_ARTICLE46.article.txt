# KSU Today
## 
### 
What is jazz? This question will
be answered tonight by explana
tion and example as KSU presents
on the "Some Like It Hot" show at
7:30 a unique program of transcrip
tions by Jelly Roll Morton, late king
of New Orleans pianists.
Music Council and the Stanford
Jazz Society will sponsor the show
jointly.
Is jazz loud, fast and discordant?
Jelly Roll shows that it should be
"sweet, slow, with plenty rhythm."
Does jazz abandon the tune? Jelly
Roll says, "Always keep the mel
ody going some way."
Is jazz purely of African origin?
Jelly Roll plays a French quadrille
and shows how it evolved into Ti
ger Rag.
The transcriptions, which feature
Morton's inimitable piano and col
orful comments, were made for the
Archives of American Folklore of
Ihe Library of Congress, under the
supervision of John A. Lomax.
In addition to the KSU airing of
the complete set of records, the
Jazz Society will meet tonight at
8:30.
