# Church Memorial to Senator Stanford
## 
### GEORGE CAULFIELD 
When visitors approach Stanford
University by Palm Drive the one
building they can clearly see from a
distance is Memorial Church, the
brilliant hues of its front set off by
the background of mountains.
The founders of Stanford Univer
sity, Senator Leland Stanford and
his wife, Jane Lathrop Stanford,
planned from the beginning that the
institution designed to perpetuate
the memory of their young son
of Memorial Church. They are all
of Venetian origin and based on
15th-century models.
Among the most important of the
mosaics are reproductions of Cosi
mo Rosselli's "The Last Supper,"
behind the altar, and of Michelan
gelo's "Prophets," which adorn the
| upper walls of the chancel.
The beautiful stained-glass win
j dows are best appreciated in early
I ricd out the Romanesque style re
| fleeting the influence of Coolidge.
I The church seats approximately
: 2.U00. Its length is 90 feet, and the
| width measures 150 feet.
I The mosaics are described as
{ the most striking single feature

should include a place of worship.
Thus when the original designs of
the University were drawn, it was
decided that the central building of
the Inner Quadrangle would be a
church.
When the University opened in
1801 the buildings of the Inner
Quadrangle were completed but
construction of the church had not
begun.
Upon the death of Senator
Stanford in IS!)!!, Mrs. Stanford
decided to build the church as a
memorial to her husband, as the
entire University was a memorial
to her son.
Of all the building clone for the
University during Mrs. Stanford's
lifetime, the construction of the j
church afforded her the greatest i
satisfaction. She took a personal in
terest in the 'â€¢work, inspected and
studied all the plans, and was a !
familiar figure when the actual j
building was being done.
The dedication took place on Sun- j
day, Jan. 25, 1903.
"Words fail in expressing the
satisfaction experienced by Mrs.
Stanford on reaching this crowning
point in her life," her biographer
writes. Later Mrs. Stanford said,
". . . while my whole heart is in
this University, my soul is in this
church."
The enduring characteristic of
Memorial Church is its freedom
in expressing the religious ideal.
Many of the principles of the
Church are embodied within the
trust agreement of the University:
''The University must be forever
maintained upon a strictly non
partisan and non - sectarian basis.
... I believe that the moral and
religious development of the Uni
versity will be better accomplished
if entirely free from all denomina
tional alliances however slight the
bond may be. The services in the
Memorial Church must be simple
and informal in character, and the
theological questions, services, and
observances upon which the sects
differ should not be entered upon,
so that members of every church
may worship and receive instruc
tion therein not inconsistent with
their individual beliefs."
Three years later, after Mrs.
Stanford's death in Honolulu, the
church was partially destroyed by
the earthquake. The damage was
so great that it was decided to
take down the entire building
and restore it in such a manner
that future earthquakes would
leave it untouched.
Architecturally. Memorial Church
is an artistic triumph.
Charles Allerton Coolidge, the ar
chitect who designed Stanford,
adopted for the University the style
of the California missions, which
was an outgrowth of Moorish and
Romanesque architecture. When de
signing Memorial Church. Clinton

morning and late afternoon when
the sunlight illumines each window
in turn.
Fortunately the mosaics and
windows are not subject to de
terioration. If the building en
dures for centuries, they will he
as fresh as they are today.
The organ was first installed in
1901. It was unharmed in the earth
quake and was again in the church
when it was rededicated. In 1925 it
was completely rebuilt from a me
chanical standpoint. Later new pipes
were added. At present the organ
contains 3.355 pipes.
David Charles Gardner served as
chaplain of the University for 34
years, beginning in 1902 and ending
in 1936. David Elton Trueblood
ended a ten-year tenure as chaplain
in December, 1945. Present Uni
versity chaplain is George J. Hall.
In addition to the regular serv
ice on Sunday mornings, organ
recitals are given on Sundays and
Thursdays throughout the year.
The church is open from eight to
five every day.
Perhaps the part that the church
plays in the life of Stanford is best
expressed in the words of Dr. Bran
ner, former President, who said:
"To Mrs. Stanford the church
stood for highmindedness, upright
ness, unselfishness, and for what are
generally known as the Christian
virtues, and it was as the teacher
of these virtues that she wanted to
pass it and its influences on to the
members of this community, living
and yet to come."
