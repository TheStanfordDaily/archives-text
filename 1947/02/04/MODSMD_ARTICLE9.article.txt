LAKE SUCCESS, N. Y.. Fob. 3
(UP). —Warren Austin of (he Unit
ed States will go before the United
Nations Security Council tomorrow
with the promise that America will
disarm as fast as anyone, but the
atomic bomb must be controlled
first, it was learned tonight.
Austin also will warn that the
German and Japanese peace trea
ties must be signed and a UN po
lice force established, before the big
powers can be expected to junk
their weapons.
The American delegate will ex
plain that the United States is
ready to advance on all of these
fronts, and will go as fast as other
nations will go.
In insisting that atomic weapons
be controlled first, Austin will point
out that the UN already has spent
six months working on this problem.
If the major powers cannot agree
on how to ban atomic weapons and
set up inspection machinery to see
that bombs are not made illegally,
then the world lias no hope of gen
eral disarmament, Austin will say.
International control of the atom,
Austin will say, is the core of col
lective security—the supreme ob
jective of UN. •
