KINGSBURG, Calif., Feb. 4 (UP).â€”Three persons were killed
and 65 injured today when Southern Pacific's all-coach stream
liner, the San Joaquin ploughed into a fuel tanker truck
and trailer and ripped it apart, touching off an explosion that
blanketed most of the train with blazing stove oil and made a
flaming coffin out of two dining cars.

Bodies of the three were burned
beyond recognition by the flames
and heat generated in the center
section of the train and apparently
in the engineer's cab on the snub
nosed Streamliner.
The explosion that followed the
collision at a grade crossing here
rattled windows in the town near
the right of way and pushed a pri
vate 1 automobile several feet ofT the
highway at the intersection.
Scenes of panic followed as the
passengers frantically sought to
escape the (lames enveloping the
metal coaches and broke windows
to jump out only to have the
flames leap in through the gaping
glass at them.
Red Cross disaster units v ore
swung into action and rescue crews
recruited from the thor..ands of
spectators who jammed the road
leading to the intersection.
Aboard the train was Amos
Alouzo Slagg, football's grand old
man, en route from Los Angeles
back to Stockton where he recent
ly resigned as head football men
tor of College of Pacific to join his
son at Susquehanna University in
Pennsylvania.
Slagg was uninjured, but seven
members of the San Francisco
Shamrock's hockey team were hos
pitalized. The entire squad was en
route to Fresno for a scheduled
game with the Fresno Falcons to
night. The game was cancelled.
