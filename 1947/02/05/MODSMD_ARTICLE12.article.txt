# Needed: 105 Million Gallons of Water

### BOYD HAIGHT 
"Who pulled the 112 lug in Lagu- \
nit a?"
Only the weatherman has the nti- !
swf*r. With March and Boathouso |
time drawing near, Lake Lagunita
now sK.kls empty, all but a puddle
season's rainfall gone down |
■oie drain.
Campus canoeists had better turn [
out for the crew, and swimmers join '
the swim team, because there'll be 1
nothing for them at the lake this I
spring. Nothing, that is, unless
there is some heavy rainfall during j
the next few weeks.
ABNORMALLY DRY
University weather experts point
to the abnormally dry year that has
brought only 7.11 inches of rain,
and they then predict that the lake j
has an outside chance of being filled i
only if there i.s a cloudburst or two ;
in the next few weeks.
Carl H. Maicr, assistant engineer
of the University, reports that
Searsvillc Lake, 300-million-gallon !
storage reservoir, is now less than I
half full.
FROM SEARSVILLE
Water for Lagunita comes from '
the Searsvillc overflow down San !
Francisquito Creek, and until that!
lake is filled the muddy puddle in
Lagunita will grow no larger.
"Two or three inches of rain over •
a short period will fill Searsvillc," |
Maier says. "A heavy storm will do \
the trick; there is no run-off from '
scattered showers, and run-off Is
what we need to (ill the lakes."
This year's rainfall mark is con- j
siflerably below the 1!)4. r i-4G level of j
inches and the 14-year average j

for Feb. 1 of 9.53 inches.
HOPE IS SLIGHT
Hope of completely filling the
105-million gallon lake is slight. To
maintain the high-water mark there
must be a continuous flow into Lake
Lagunita, Maier explains, for actu-
ally there is no plug in the bottom.
Three million gallons are lost
daily through seepage into the
porous ground.
The question, then, is not "Who
pulled the plug?" but "Who turned
off the water?"
