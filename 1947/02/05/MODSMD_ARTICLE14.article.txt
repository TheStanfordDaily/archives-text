# Pedalestrian Blood Runs
## 
### TOM SELF 
A student on a bicycle collided j
! with an automobile near the Book- |
J store yesterday afternoon at, 3. Al- i
though he suffered a bar! gash over :
his left eye and a cut on his hand, i
! he refused aid and did riot give his i
j name. J
This accident, while not particu- i
| larly serious in itself, illustrates the
! constant, potential dangers in the j
Bookstore-Union area where large j
numbers of pedestrians and auto- 1
| ists come together.
Because of this danger Panama i
j was made a one-way street and â– 
parking was prohibited on one side
j of Lasuen. These safety measures, j
i plus caution on the part, of drivers, :
it, was hoped would be sufficient,
j Police Chief Gordon Davis said.
| However, if lack of courtesy on j
the part of drivers should continue,;
! it may be necessary to block ofl the
j area from the post office to the
| Bookstore in the manner the Quad
1 is blocked off, Davis continued. "I
have noticed many drivers trying
! to nudge the pedestrians out of the j
; way," he said.
