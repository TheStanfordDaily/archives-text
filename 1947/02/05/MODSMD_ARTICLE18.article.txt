This whs John Ear! Baker's for
mula f«>r a better China when he
spoke last niglu on thr Tuesday

Evening Series program in Me
morial Hall auditorium.
Mr. Baker's topic was "The Civil
War in China." Making no at
tempt at offering a solution to re
solve the conflict, he spoke in terms
of a unified China and yet indicated
his partiality for the Nationalist
Government.
"The Nationalist Government's
program covers more of China
and is so much more able t«» pro
vide thei mprovemcnts which the
country needs. Therefore I am
for the Nationalist Government,"
Mr. Baker stated.
A transportation and communica
tions expert who first, went out to
the Orient in 1916 to help national
ize the railroads, Mr. Raker brought
to his audience a wide background
of experience in dealing with two of
China's toughest problems trans
portation and food.
lie charged tbnt there has been
too much one-sided reporting dur
ing; recent years, attributing it to
yonng reporters confined in cer
tain areas of (he country.
He compared all reporters in
China to the three blind men who
argued as to whether an elephant
was a wall, a tree or a rope. His
inference was that information com
ing out of China has reflected rather
narrow and departmentalized views.
