## Report on Farm Internationalism 
### 
lteport will be made to Excom tonight by
members ot the committee appointed last
week to investigate a possible international
program and organization for Stanford. The
committee, composed of Babs Wilbur, Frank
f'reede and the Daily Editor will make the
following statements of conclusions:
1) Function of the committee will be to hear
proposals for immediate action (i.e., the set
ling up of an information office, or of resi
dence discussion groups), to enroll persons
nilcie.sted in such work (either to take charge
of a specialized project or to aid in general
h.u kgjound work of the committee), to recom
ii.Mud approval of projects and appropriations
i Kxcom, and ti act as a co-ordinating, review
n j, and planning board. Offset hours will be
iii.iiiitained by the committee to. hear plans,
du;.s(?rninate information, and hold discussions
with all members of the student body who are
hi forested.
2) Aim of the committee will be a program
to encourage active student interest in inter
national problems while providing ready
methods to learn about them, and to encour
• ifj»• students to accept their rightful, responsi
ble place in an international society.
.Such a program would include relief work,
' onferences, discussion groups, and academic
- ourHes to furnish information, training, and
aspiration for public or private contiibution
to international understanding,
ll would include working through existing
< impils organizations and soliciting their aid.
The committee is awcire that it faces a pow
• (Jul tradition of majority indifference, a fatal
i;.lic "sludents-can't-do-anything-to-help" atti
ttich.-. Hut each member possesses a faith in

students at Stanford and everywhere as the
force for potential change in political trends
and mistrust; each feels sure that by steady
work and investigation the rose-covered walls
of provincialism on this campus can be torn
down.
3) The committee feels that at the outset it
must offer attractive bait to seduce the student
body from its indifference. It wishes to sup
plement, by all possible, methods, an already
growing file of information on jobs, tours,
hostel work, university openings, scholar
ships, and exchange programs.
It hopes ultimately for a program of ex
change, with full academic credit, of Stanford
students with universities abroad.
It will also consult with gualified professors
to draw up an inter-departmental curriculum
of international studies lor major work—out
of courses already existing, and with possible
suggestions for added courses. If the findings
meiit it, they will be presented to the Aca
demic Council.
The plans mentioned in the foregoing two
paragraphs are dependent wholly, at the out
set, upon student demand and support for
them.
4) Investigation has been begun and will
continue on a large number of projects; prog
ress reports will be made through the Daily,
as the committee attempts to boil down gener
alities into specific plans. No possibilities will
be ignoied in the next few weeks to lay a firm
foundation for permanent woik and organi
zation; the committee will work to the utmost
for a comprehensive program to have over-all
significance to the students who so lar have
been effectively by-passed by the offerings
of smaller groups.
