# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
Tu the Editor:
We object to Martin Anderson's and the Daily
editorial's criticism of Monday night's open meeting
lor the co-ordination of international groups on
campus. The inefficient "bickering" at this meeting
was mil caused by the fact that the discussion was
op-n, but because the leaders did not seem to know
■ <r dearly state the official status of the N.S.O. or the
Intitule. Furthermore, they waited until after 10
• • 1 l'"'k before they allowed Charles Martin to pre
' hi (he alternate plan which would serve as a basis
loi judging the one first presented. Most of the
••indents at the meeting seemed to feel that the sec
ond plan was better organized than the first, but were
willing to combine the best features of both. By
then, however, so much time had been wasted that
we were unable to proceed with specific action on
any plan.
The students at the meeting obviously felt that
the first plan was at fault in that heads of commit
t-were to be appointed by Excom instead of being
elected by the interested groups. We believe that
the organization should maintain immediate contact
with the student body through direct election and
free discussion. We want our international organi
zation to be conducted in the democratic way, from
the bottom up.

To the Editor:
So Stanford students are intensely interested in
international affairs? One would certainly arrive at
that conclusion from reading in the Daily such
■ tatements as the following (from President Martin
Anderson) which was printed Jan. 30: "While it is
gratifying to know that people will finht over pros
pective plans for international organizations, "we must
not start Working tn cross purposes." I assume that
ilie president was speaking of Stanford people, since

the statement was made on the occasion of the ap
pointment of someone "to head a central committee
to review prospective plans." There were three
articles on the front sheet of the same daily which
told of various "1" activities on the campus.
On the same page mentioned above was a picture
of one Dr. Paul Dengler, a citizen of Austria, who
according to the accompanying article is a traveler
and lecturer well qualified to give us some interesting
and authentic information on his native country. The
public was invited to hear the lecture in Cubberley
Auditorium at 4:15 Thursday.
And yet, in spite of all the "students who will
fight over prospective plans for international organi
zations," who, one might assume, would be interested
in gaining some enlightening information about an
international situation which has been given much
attention by our national press during the past few
months; in spite of the red-hot campaign of your own
paper—how many students attended Dr. Dengler's
lecture? At 4:30, after waiting 15 minutes for late
arrivals who did not arrive, this noted international
figure walked to the rostrum to face an audience of
one hundred—one hundred out of seven thousand,
and not all that number were students!
It must have been a cruel disappointment to a man
encouraged by the Daily stories of the "internation
ally minded" (so they say) student body of one of
America's greatest universities.
Does that "I" splashed all over the Daily mean
"International," or does it mean "I"? "I" want some
new activities. "I" want a pre-paid trip to Europe.
"I" want everyone to think that I am big-hearted in
my attitude toward the poor unfortunate rest of the
world.
II we really want to put the "International" into
the"I" we should not waste the opportunity of hear
ing brilliant, eye-witness descriptions of the Euro
pean situation such as the one given by Dr. Dengler.

lecture? At 4:30, after waiting 15 minutes for late
arrivals who did not arrive, this noted international
figure walked to the rostrum to face an audience of
one hundred—one hundred out of seven thousand,
and not all that number were students!
It must have been a cruel disappointment to a man
encouraged by the Daily stories of the "internation
ally minded" (so they say) student body of one of
America's greatest universities.
Does that "I" splashed all over the Daily mean
"International," or does it mean "I"? "I" want some
new activities. "I" want a pre-paid trip to Europe.
"I" want everyone to think that I am big-hearted in
my attitude toward the poor unfortunate rest of the
world.
II we really want to put the "International" into
the"I" we should not waste the opportunity of hear
ing brilliant, eye-witness descriptions of the Euro
pean situation such as the one given by Dr. Dengler.

We object to Martin Anderson's and the Daily
editorial's criticism of Monday night's open meeting
lor the co-ordination of international groups on
campus. The inefficient "bickering" at this meeting
was mil caused by the fact that the discussion was
op-n, but because the leaders did not seem to know
■ <r dearly state the official status of the N.S.O. or the
Intitule. Furthermore, they waited until after 10

ond plan was better organized than the first, but were
willing to combine the best features of both. By
then, however, so much time had been wasted that
we were unable to proceed with specific action on
any plan.
The students at the meeting obviously felt that
the first plan was at fault in that heads of commit
t-were to be appointed by Excom instead of being
elected by the interested groups. We believe that
the organization should maintain immediate contact
with the student body through direct election and
free discussion. We want our international organi

So Stanford students are intensely interested in
international affairs? One would certainly arrive at
that conclusion from reading in the Daily such
■ tatements as the following (from President Martin
Anderson) which was printed Jan. 30: "While it is
gratifying to know that people will finht over pros
pective plans for international organizations, "we must
not start Working tn cross purposes." I assume that
ilie president was speaking of Stanford people, since

the statement was made on the occasion of the ap
pointment of someone "to head a central committee
to review prospective plans." There were three
articles on the front sheet of the same daily which
told of various "1" activities on the campus.
On the same page mentioned above was a picture
of one Dr. Paul Dengler, a citizen of Austria, who
according to the accompanying article is a traveler
and lecturer well qualified to give us some interesting
and authentic information on his native country. The
public was invited to hear the lecture in Cubberley
Auditorium at 4:15 Thursday.
And yet, in spite of all the "students who will
fight over prospective plans for international organi
zations," who, one might assume, would be interested
in gaining some enlightening information about an
international situation which has been given much
attention by our national press during the past few
months; in spite of the red-hot campaign of your own

lecture? At 4:30, after waiting 15 minutes for late
