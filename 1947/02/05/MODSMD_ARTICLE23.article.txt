## HISTORY 1947 
### 
A lot of peopl â–  in this country have been antici
pating, and not with complete disfavor, the advent
ol a business depression in the near future. As the
S.F. News' Art Caylor has pointed out, many people
aiv in, favor of another depression. Even if wages
fall and unemployment increases, prices will fall,
too, and what money people have will buy more, it
is argued. High prices, it is hardly necessary to
point out, are a continuing irritation, even in our
i' loistered existence here. I might say especially here
fm those in the $65-$9O a month bracket.
Well, good or bad, fur it or agin, no major depres
sion or sharp recession (or use your own favorite
New Deal euphemism) is expected in 1947. This is
based on a careful study of three weekly news maga
zines, a news-letter, and the daily papers. (All right,
all I know is what I read in the papers.) There is
supposed lo be a break in prices of "soft" consumer
goods; that is, of food and clothing. But the still -
dammed-up demand for "hard" goods, automobiles,
refrigerators, etc., is expected to keep the prices of
such items up, in spite of increased production. Di
vers economists insist that any such slump cannot
be compared with I'afTaire 1929 and will probably be
less s"rioUN, even, than the hard winter of 1920-21.

I was surprised, anil a little annoyed, to have
people tell me after my column on the tariff question

was printed that I must bo a lit'llidcral after :t!l. A:,
with most of the major issues in the United States,
neither oi the parties is solidly lor or against protec
tive ta rill's.
There are Republicans and Democrats who are
pro-union lal>or and there are Republicans and
Democrats win* are anti-union labor. TheW arc Re
publican and Democratic isolationists and Republi
can and Democratic internationalists. Bosses Hague
and Crump are still in office, and the Pews and the
Duponts still have much to say about the conduct of
state affairs in Pennsylvania and Delaware. Under
Dewey, New York passed an bill, and Gover
nor Warren is sponsoring a health insurance bill in
the California Legislature.
And the split of opinion on the tariff issues has,
to my mind, even less relationship to party lines.
The active opponents and proponents of the Recipro
cal Trade Agreements are activated not by con
siderations of party, but by considerations of cold
dollars and cents. Those producers who profit from
the tariff subsidy want that subsidy continued. Those
producers whose comparative advantage enables
them to trade in a world market would like to see
it a free market. If the final consideration is to Ik l
"the greatest good of the greatest number," and it
we consider not only producers but also consumers,
1 do not doubt that the result should be a substan
tial measure of free trade.
