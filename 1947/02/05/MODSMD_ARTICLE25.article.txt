# Humanities Dept. Urges ‘Eastern’ Civ
## 
### 
"A student has no education un
' less he includes Eastern Civilization
j as well as Western Civilization in
i his university studies," Dr. A. E.
1 Sokol said upon his return from a
humanities conference at Occidental
College last Saturday. He was ac
companied by Dean Dodds of the
Humanities Department, and by Dr.
Shan Wing Chan of the Department
| of Asiatic and Slavic Studies.
The conference, attended by rep
; rescntatives from 12 California col
| leges and universities, and from
| business groups, sought an exchange
1 of ideas upon university facilities
! concerning the Far East, and their
! effect upon the future of the stu
dent, receiving such training.
Both Dr. Sokol and Dead Dodds
| emphasized, as did the conference,
! that the Far East has and will con
j linue to becomc more and more im
• portant in world affairs. Schools
will aim the trend, to include more
general courses which includes not
only the traditional Western Civili
i zation but the Far Eastern Civilization,
|tion, they said.
From the practical aspect, two

I press representatives from China
j and the Associated Press, explained
i at the conference, the dire need for
! journalists who were trained not
j only in the mechanics of writing
| but in the background, history, cul
ture and languages of the Far East.
"Since the nationalistic develop
ment in China, there is more need
for long-range planning," said Dr.
| Sokol, "in order to deal witn these
people. Eventually they (the Chi
nese) will not transact business with
American people who cannot speak
their langu;iye." This view was par
ticularly stressed by one group at
the conference representing busi
| ness interests, who have contacts in
the Orient.
Dean Dodds stated that Western
j Civilization has been over-empha

sized, and that in the future Far
Eastern Civilization courses will be
necessary for a well-rounded liberal
education.
The conference was sponsored by
"California College in China," which
formerly operated in Shanghai be
fore the war. Dr. William B. Pettus,
the College President, desired to
ascertain the extent of training in
Far Eastern Studies in California.

dent, receiving such training.
Both Dr. Sokol and Dead Dodds
| emphasized, as did the conference,
! that the Far East has and will con
j linue to becomc more and more im
• portant in world affairs. Schools
will aim the trend, to include more
general courses which includes not
only the traditional Western Civili
i zation but the Far Eastern Civilization,
|tion, they said.
From the practical aspect, two

I press representatives from China
j and the Associated Press, explained
i at the conference, the dire need for
! journalists who were trained not
j only in the mechanics of writing
| but in the background, history, cul
ture and languages of the Far East.
"Since the nationalistic develop
ment in China, there is more need
for long-range planning," said Dr.
| Sokol, "in order to deal witn these
people. Eventually they (the Chi
nese) will not transact business with
American people who cannot speak
their langu;iye." This view was par
ticularly stressed by one group at
the conference representing busi
| ness interests, who have contacts in
the Orient.
Dean Dodds stated that Western
j Civilization has been over-empha

sized, and that in the future Far
Eastern Civilization courses will be
necessary for a well-rounded liberal
education.
The conference was sponsored by
"California College in China," which
formerly operated in Shanghai be
fore the war. Dr. William B. Pettus,
the College President, desired to
ascertain the extent of training in
Far Eastern Studies in California.
