I'lvcn Make SjKM'clies About "Kin, No Less

There have been many columns written in castigation ol Glenn (Jun
ior) Davis and Felix (Doc) Blanchard, and many speeches made on the
subject —even on the floor of Congress, where one would presume the
representatives of the people would keep their minds on matters of graver
import—merely because the two young men in question had a chance to
make a pocketful of money, and made public their desire to do so.
Personally, it seems a bit silly to me. Why grown men —even public
servants- should leap into print with an opinion on the subject is prob
lematical. Their obvious desires for publicity—of any kind-—have suc
ceeded only in making them more than a little ridiculous.
I mean especially the mouthiugs of a certain Representative who. on
the floor of Congress—immune from any possible action for slander—
said "ISlant hard. Davis, and Poole ought to remember the draftees who
faced dangers and hardships in Europe or in the Pacific. Sale on the
Hudson, they were enjoying military education at public expense."
Hill Leiser, sports editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, summarized
my opinions quite well: "That, in my book, is as dirty and foul a statement
as one older man ever made of a boy.'' Mr. Leiser is consistently one ol
the saner sportswriters; he does not say such things without good reason.
1 doubt that he has ever used stronger language on any subject.
What are the facts? Simply that three boys, who happen to he talented
grid performers, saw a chance to make more money than they ever saw
before. They are in the Army, and thus are not free agents.
Yes, Yes, Let's Hear No More About ll
'1 hey submitted a request through regular channels; having had some
slight experience with the service myself, I'm sure they would not have
gone even that far without advice from higher-ups. The request was
turned down. The boys then announced that they would not resign from
the Academy, but would graduate on schedule and carry out their part
of the agreement they signed when they entered the Academy. In a
nutshell, those are the facts; anything more would be embellishment.
Now comes another question. Since those are the facts of the case,
how could anyone find justification lor an attack, either on the lootball
players or on the Army? The boys made a straightforward, manly re
quest; what they wanted was against Army policy and was refused, like
wise in a straightforward manner. Any attack on either party is the result
of inixed-up thinking, nothing else.
Whether or not the Army would he improved by allowing KACII man
four months off per year is not for me to say; indeed, it is not part ol the
issue. At the present time it is against policy. The boys made no attempt
to get a reversal of the decision. They are taking it—you will please
excuse the expression—like soldiers.
The professionals, likewise, have done nothing to draw down on their
heads the wrath of God, or a reasonably accurate facsimile. When the
names of Davis, Blanchard, and Poole were put down on the draft list
they were just protecting themselves, in the event the boys ever became
Iree agents. They made no offer, express or implied. In other words, the
whole thing is silly—so let's hear no more about it.
Mil lliin Again, I (lan Still Hear Ini
That, by some process known only to me, brings us to the case of Leo
the Lip Durocher and his current troubles involving an actress named
Laraine Day. Durocher has been up to his ears in trouble for years; his
troubles change, but not Leo.
Such men as Charles 11. Graham. Connie Mack, Clark Griffith, and
others have given their entire lives to baseball, have made it respectable.
A Leo Durocher can tear down all their hard work with one act. Lipp.v
Leo seems to think he's a law unto himself, that the regular rules apply
only to lesser persons.
An attitude ol that sort is bad enough when confined to the baseball
diamond; when extended to other parts of human life, it's dangerous.
Most people are willing to overlook his fights, name-calling and umpire
baiting on the (ield. They are even willing to overlook the beating he
administered to an obstreperous fan.
But no thinking person can pass over his flouting of the courts. Miss
Day went through California courts to secure a divorce. Immediately she
went to Mexico with Durocher and secured a Mexican divorce; then the
two returned to El Paso and were married—in the United States.
Superior Judge George Dockvveiler, who awarded Miss Day her inter
locutory decree, and which entails a one-year waiting period, immedi
ately ordered the pair to show cause why the decree should not he set
aside. Lippy Leo called Judge Dockweiler "unethical and publicity con
scious," "holier than thou." The judge asked a group of lawyers to ad
vise him as to whether the remarks constituted contempt of court, and
one of them, Joseph Scott, termed Leo's speech an "insufferable piece of
effrontery.''
Actually, Judge Dockweiler was most lenient in calling for advice; he
could have cited Leo the Lip for contempt of court immediately. In other
words, Leo's in REAL trouble. His actions in the past give no reason to
believe he will ever change. This is hard to say about anyone, but—for
ihe good of baseball—it might be best to bar him permanently.
Leftovers from Previously
Stan Shpetner, well-known Stanford sportsman, 8.M.0.C. and revolu
tionary, had a harrowing experience not long ago. He decided to engage
in his favorite sport (this is allegedly a sports column), which consists of
raising the window of the Daily editor's office from the outside and stran
ding the nearest female.
The other Wednesday Mr. Shpetner was in the vicinity of the Daily
office and ambled over for a little fun. lie threw the window open and
extended his clutching grasp; then he looked up—right into the eyes of
Dr. Donald Trcsidder, who was visiting. Dr. T. said. "Hello, Stan." Stan
said "Hello. Dr. Trcsidder," his talons still extended toward the nearest
neck, which happened to belong to Miss Nancy Bannick. Miss Bannick,
her back turned, knew nothing of the little drama being enacted behind
her.
The silence was getting deafening. Finally the redoubtable Mr. Shpet
ner, never long at a loss, cleared his throat and said. "Well, got to be go
ing!" and left forthwith. The pantomime was over.
