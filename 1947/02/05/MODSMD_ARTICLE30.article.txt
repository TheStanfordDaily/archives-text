### LYNN CARMAN 
Stanford's wrestling hopes soared
today as Student Coach Vein Jones
revealed that he will be eligible for
competition in all the remaining
meets of the season.
The return of Jones, who hails
from Chicago and who walked off
with the Illinois state high sschool
mat championship when only a
sophomore, holsters the squad and
adds experience and punch to an
otherwise green wrestling squad
which has had tough sledding all
season.
He will go to the mat for the first
time this Friday night when he and
his cohorts tangle with San Fran
cisco in their fust home match of
the season. Junes wrestles at 136
lbs.
It has not yet been decided
whether the meet will he held in
the Pavilion or the gym. for there
is a possibility that boxing match
es will also he held in conjunc
tion with the wrestling match. If
the two are held together, they
wil he run off in the Pavilion.
The Cardinals have visions of
thrashing through to their first win
in four starts. Their last match, at
San Jose last Friday, was notable
only in that Winston Mumby
chalked up his third straight indi
vidual victory in the 165-lb. class as
Stanford dropped the meet, 21 to 11.
Fred Berrv. 12K lbs., will be
back in action Friday after being
on the sidelines with a skiing in
jury. Jim Kurfess. who has been
wrestling at 155 lbs., will go
against S.F.S. in the 145â€”1b. class.
Dave Field is the possible starter
in the vacated 155-lb. class.
With Jones wrestling in the 135-
lb. class, Alan Walker will probaby

move up a division and into the 145-
Ib. berth. Dave Garst, who won his
match at San Jose last week, will
probably get the starting nod again
1 his week.
The other two berths will prob
ably be filled by Dave Hettinger
(121 lbs.), and either Mill Iloyt or
Dave Field (175 lbs.).
