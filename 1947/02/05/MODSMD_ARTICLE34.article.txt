# Aged Sequoia Hall Has Lost Foothold

The present housing shortage has
caused many students to inquire,
"Why isn't Sequoia Hall being used
to house people?"
During the war, when the War
Department used the dormitory for
Civilian Defense Training, repairs
were neglected, and after the hall
was turned back over to Stanford,
an investigation was made to deter
mine just what repairs were needed.
A committee of engineers found
that the building was in much worse
shape than anyone had suspectedâ€”
the poor quality of the concrete
used has caused the walls to de
teriorate so that the dorm is unfit
for human habitation.
EARTHQUAKE DANGEII
Since the laterals used are of
light wood and the concrete poor,
any sudden jolt, such as an earth
quake, would cause complete col
lapse.
Sequoia, then named Roble, was
built in 1891 to house women stu
dents. The first plan had been to

build a dormitory identical to En
eina, but as housing for the women
was needed immediately if they
were to be admitted with the first
class, old Roble was hurriedly start
ed in June in order to be completed
by October 1.
The "Ransome Process," a then
recently patented method of build
ing with reinforced concrete, was
used instead of crushed sandstone,
of which the Quad and Encina were
built.
USED UNTIL 1945
Old Roble or Sequoia was in con
tinuous use from 1894 until 1945.
Women were housed there until
1910, at which time the new Roble
was built. The old building was
then converted into a men's dormi
tory and renamed Sequoia.
Many of Stanford's famous alumni
lived at Sequoia, the most famous
group, perhaps being the "Immortal
21" who recaptured the Axe from
Cal in the early thirties.
Examination of Sequoia also de
termined 'that repairs would be too
costly to warrant them.
