# Twenty Dollars a Month Houses and Feeds Student
## 
### BY GEORGE LEE 
It can be done. Believe it or not,
there is a student on the Stanford
campus who spends only $20 a
month for both food and lodging.
This feat is being accomplished by
('. K. Chang, a graduate student in
physics from Hopei, China.
Mr. Chang has been a student at
Stanford for nine years, something
of a record in itself. He came over
here in October 1037. After obtain
ing an engineering degree in 1940
he continued his research in phys
ics, and is now engaged in an ex
tensive study on elementary par
ticles and X-ray physics.
HAUNTS LIBRARY
Around the campus, however, Mr.
Chang is better known for his un
usual manner of living. He can be
found haunting the library and
Physics Department from early
morning until midnight. At other
times, his slightly hunc'hed figure
may be seen lugging heavy volumes
tu and from the library and the Chi
nese Clubhouse where he occupies
an attic room.
How he manages to subsist on $20
a month is a story in itself. In de
fiance of current high costs of liv
ing, Mr. Chang lives on a simple diet
including bread, peanut butter,
leafy vegetables and a few eggs.
He eats no breakfast. For lunch â€¢

there is a bowl of rice or noodles
and two slices of bread. Supper is
at 7 when an occasional egg and a
few slices of bread generally suffice.
All this costs Mr. Chang an average
of 20 cents a day. The rest of the
$20 is spent on room rent and other
items.
CONFUCIUS ANI) FRANKLIN
His philosophy is that "everyone
should contribute all he can for
mankind. - ' The old sage Confucius,
Benjamin Franklin, and the Chinese
reformer of the late Manchu dy
nasty, Liang Ch'ia Chian, are his
idols. Much of their ideology is re
flected in his conversation and ev
eryday actions.
Mr. Chang was born in Wu Chiao
Hsien, approximately 150 miles
south of Tsientsin. He attended col
lege in Peiping and was until 1937
teaching engineering and physics
courses. Then he obtained a China
Foundation Fellowship to come to
America to study. Realizing that to
continue research in physics would
require more time and money than
that allotted him, Mr. Chang em
barked on his stringent budget.
Mr. Chang is married and has a
wife and four children living in
China. He has contributed articles
to Radio Engineering, X-Ray, and
various other magazines. He hopes
someday to make some important
contributions to science.
