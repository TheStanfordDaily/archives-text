## GERMANY—KEY TO EUROPEAN SETTLEMENT 
### RALPH HOVIS 
The problem of the German treaty
—finally to be discussed alter 21
months since Germany surrendered
—is the key issue in the whole com
plex task of makihg the peace and
shaping the future of international
society. Germany is the central
point at which the various conflict
ing principles and procedures of the
East meet head on with those of the
West. The disposition of Germany
—with her population, resources,
skill-. .rid spirit—will affect the
dest iy of every other European na
tion. The German problem is the
European problem and the Euro
pean problem is one of the world's
problems.
RED STAR
"What are the several official Eu
ropean Viewpoints and those of the
U.S. on "What to Do with Ger
many"? Russia wants (1) economic
and political unification of Germany,
(2) formation of central political
administration in Germany under
Allied control, (3) to raise the level
of German industry from that al
ready agreed upon, allowing the
German people to restore their in
dustry and trade so as to become
self-sustaining, (4) to share the in
dustrial products of the Ruhr, Saar,
and the Rhineland—areas now in
control of the Western powers, (5)
no territorial change in the western
border of Germany, (6) Poland to
keep a large slice of eastern Ger
many which she now operates, and
Russia wants to annex the city and
vicinity about Konigsberg, and (7)
to bring more German war crimi
nals to justice.
UNION JACK
Great Britain has outlined sug
gestions for a centralized German
government in which there would
be (1) political conditions to secure
the world against any German re
version to dictatorship or revival of
German aggressive policy, (2) eco
nomic conditions to enable Germany
;md the world to benefit under con
ditions of peace from German in
dustry and resources (via socializa
tion of certain industries), (3) con
stitutional machinery in Germany
acceptable to the German people

and thus likely
to be more per
manent (includ
ing bicameral -cameral
legislature an d
a supreme court,
American style),
(4) support of
French territo
rial proposals to
incorporate the
Saar and rich
coal areas into
the French eco
nomic and ad
ministrative sys
tem without an-

nexation, and (5) opposition to
French ambitions to separate the
Ruhr and Rhineland inasmuch as
there would be Allied military oc
cupation of the areas after the end
of the occupation of Germany prop
er—thereby eliminating the fears of
the French that a future Germany
might renew use of the area's war
potential for aggression.
TRI-COLOR
France speaks for (1) intention to
stay put as an occupying power in
Germany for a very long time, (2)
decentralization of Germany, organ
ized as a federation of individual
German states, (3) permanent pos
session of the Saar and internation
alization of the Ruhr, and (4) con
tinued consideration of the Church -
illian federation of Europe plan.
The Low Countries—Belgium, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Den
mark—have (1) filed requests to be
admitted to full participation in the
imminent pcace treaty discussions,
(2) the Dutch have asked for a
small part of German territory to
compensate for damage inflicted on
their economy by the Nazis, (3) the

Dutch have further asked for guar
antees against future renewal of
preferential charges on rail, road,
and water transportation to the det
| riment of Netherlands ports, (4) the
j Low Countries have repeated that
political decentralization is a.s es
i sential to Europe's future peace as
| is the economic prosperity of the
j German people—and that the two
are not incompatible with each oth
er, and (5) all four have cautioned
against fixing boundaries on the
basis of or revenge.
STARS AND STRIPES
The United States calls for (1)
| a prosperous, economically unified
| Germany free to do ino.st of her
I business with her pre-Hitler cus
tomers, the Western world, (2) dis
solution of the IG Farben trust, the
elimination of holding companies,
and prohibition of interlocking di
rectorat?s, (3) the reorganization of
German banking along U.S. Federal
Reserve lines, (4) federation of trade
unions permitted on zonal basis, (5)
agrarian reforms aiming at reduc
tion of tenant farming, ((i) central
ized government built from the
ground up, based on a union of pro
vincial governments retaining a
; large degree of autonomy, (7) an
i eventual grass-roots democracy to
arise in Germany, enabling occupa
! tion forces to be reduced or even
| withdrawn, and (8) purification of
Nazism and Prussianism.
EX-SWASTIKA
Germany, personified by several
responsible leaders, has been seek
ing (1) increase in civilian food ra-
I tions, (2) more coal and iron to be
| available, (3) downward revision of
reparations, (4) credit for import of
food, raw materials, and production
means, (5) new fiscal laws, (6) abo
lition of slave labor, (7) release of
PW's, and (8) the cutting off of im
pediments to the free flow of men,
merchandise, ideas, and news.
Furthermore, German leaders have
j asked that the world consider these
things when preparing a peace
treaty: (1) in the past the Germans
have always been told what to do,
they have not had to think for
themselves, (2) the German people
like to be governed, like to feel au
thority, (3) their dream of freedom
is negative, just that of not beintf
pushed around by their leaders, and
(4) the German people care neither
! for communistic totalitarian econ

omy nor centrist capitalistic econ
omy, but rather a middle way.
Having surveyed a few basic aims
of the Allies toward Germany, we
might draw some tentative conclu
sions as to what should or should
not be done. These are merely reg
! istered for your further considera
j tion and debate.
CONCLUSIONS
First, German unity has been an
unqualified catastrophe for Europe
j and the Western world. We cannot
i re-create it and hope to have se
curity at the same time. Second, if
certain influential men in Moscow,
London, and Washington toy with
the idea that a strong, united Ger
many can be made into a depend
able ally, the outgrowth of that idea
will lead to world suicide in double
quick order. Third, the industrial
might of the Ruhr. Saar, and Rhine
j land must be separated from Ger
man control and stay separated.
Fourth, Germany must be de-Prus
sianized for good. It took from the
time of Frederick II to Bismarck to
Prussianize Germany and from Bis
marck to Hitler to forge the 1939-
1945 affair. There is no reason on
earth to believe that the reversal of
the process won't take one very long
time.
Fifth, we should work not for
"just another" German settlement
as such but for a new European set
tlement. Germany is the core of
European economy and must be
considered as a part of all Europe.
Finally, since we cannot use force
forever to prevent German restora
tion, Germany must be taught that
aggression does not pay, that it must
resign itself to become a peaceable
state. In order to do this the Ger
mans themselves will have to estab
lish self-government where there is
of conscience, secret ballot,
and majority rule with unoppressed
minorities.

discuss problems of atomic energy
control.)
