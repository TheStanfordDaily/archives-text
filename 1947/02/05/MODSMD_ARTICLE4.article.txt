Stanford students will have an
other reason to buy tl > latest Es
quire. Page 100 of the ilarch issue
is devoted to a colorful Co'toon and,
as if that isn't. sufficient reward to
readers, a "campus portrait" of . . .
that's right, Stanford University.
Es vuire makes an earnest appeal
to the agricultural element on the
campus by describing the article as
"Esquire's lour of U.S. colleges
pauses at the school which blos
somed on a farm." And then begins
the saga of Stanford with "Lelnnd
Stanford had a farm. And on his
farm he built a college."
Some of the history and many of
the traditions of Stanford are in
terestingly treated by author Ben
Hirsh.
Esquire describes the Chaparral
as the campus humor magazine that
simply basics in the luxury and goes
on picking coed queens for the wolf
pack.
Before he runs out of space, Hirsh
writes of the Cellar, the Honor
Code, the Palo Alto redwood, Ernie
Nevers, the Axe, and just about ev
erything else connected with the
school.
Across the page from the story is
a montage of symbols which "should
make nostalgia come up like a lump
in the throats of ex-Cellah-Dwel
lahs and Roughs."
