Matthew H: —"'')r what shall it profit a man if
he gain the whole world but lose his own soul?"
The life of each one of us is divided into two
major factors—the means by which we live and the
end.s for which we live and nothing enters more

deeply into determining the quality
of a man. or an era, than the han
dling of these two.
Sometimes I wonder if we have
not used our "improved means to
an unimproved end." Everyone
knows, without its being said again,
that we have more to live with than
any generation ever had. Wo have
(lie best chance in history to make
this world cease to be a "vale of
tears" for mankind. Ilow can we
do it?
