# New Room Plan Pends
## 
### 
A special plan for room drawing
this quarter will be put into effect,
pending approval of Women's Con-
ference, Housing Com decided in a
meeting yesterday.
This plan has been devised to
give Branner junior transfers and
Roble sophomores a better chance
to move.
Ordinarily drawing between
fall-winter quarters, and winter
spring quarters is run on the
straight class preference system.
This time preference under this
plan, will be given to various
groups in the following order:
Sponsors (including only those
| who are returning to their old resi
| dence, or who cannot return bc
i cause there are no vacancies), sen
iors, Branner junior transfers, Roble
I sophomores, other juniors, and oth
er sophomores.
Housing Com recommended
that committee members be made
cx-oflicio members of the cx
coms of their respective areas.
This recommendation is also sub
ject to the approval of Women's
Conference.
The committee also laid plans to
review the present social program
for freshmen orientation, instituted
last quarter, in the near future.
