# Stanford Family Spirit Born With Founding of University
## 
### VIRGINIA SCHULTZ 
Tlio "Stanford Family" tradition,
probably the oldest of the Farm's
many customs, typifies the loyalty,
respect, and enduring gratitude of
men and women who have in any
way been connected with the Uni
versity. Its beginnings can be traced
back to Oct. 1, 1891, when a group
of 465 students and 15 professors saw
the dream of the Leland Stanfords
become a reality.
Everyone who has been associated
with the University—students, fac
ulty, donors, and friends—all be
long to the Stanford Family, and ac
cording to tradition the University
in some degree be 1 onus to them.
With this Family relationship comes
a sense of possession and kinship
and also a feeling of responsibility
toward the group.
The Family idea started back
with the founding of the Farm
when "the going was tough" and
the country was predicting the
failure of the enterprise. Senator
and Mrs. Stanford as founders and
trustees were an intimate part of
campus life, and the students and
the faculty had to work together
to make the University succeed.
The enrollment was small so nat
urally everyone knew everyone
else.
The "hello" custom grew outof
this close association. Years ago it
was a common thing to greet every
one on the campus, but since the
University has grown, it is impos
sible to maintain acquaintance with
everybody. Yet this feeling of
friendliness has survived to such an
extent that visitors invariably arc
impressed by the congeniality dis
played on campus.
Close student and faculty rela
tionships outside of the classroom
arc an ever-present evidence »>f
the Family tradition. Faculty
members often have informal
gatherings or after-dinner coffees
in their own homes. I)r. Tresidder
has weekly Music at Home con
certs of recorded music for stu
dents and faculty. In activities
such as the Junior Water Carnival
and the Spring Sing both work to
gether and participate in the fun.
The student body, large as it is,
manages to maintain a high degree

of congeniality and co-operation.
Fundamental to the idea of the
Stanford Family are the traditions
j of student self-government and the
! Honor Code. Each requires con-
I stant individual effort and education
j in order to be upheld. In this re
j spoct is found one of the most im
j portant. obligations of the student to
| keep his part of the Family tradi
i tion.
Socially the students have found
many ways lo preserve the friend
ly atmosphere. Open houses, ath
letic contests, rallies, and all
campus dances have lone been a
j part of the Farm custom. Over
[ 25 years ago an article appeared
in the Daily Palo Alto which

"The Roble ladies were at home
j on Saturday evening and pleasantly
entertained the 135 gentlemen who
accepted the invitations that had
been sent out. Conversation was
the order of the evening and cards
with interesting topics were placed
among the guests."
In gratitude to the Founders of

(he University, the Family tradi
tion includes deep respect and ad
miration of Senator and Mrs. Stan

Tlio "Stanford Family" tradition,
probably the oldest of the Farm's
many customs, typifies the loyalty,
respect, and enduring gratitude of
men and women who have in any
way been connected with the Uni
versity. Its beginnings can be traced
back to Oct. 1, 1891, when a group
of 465 students and 15 professors saw
the dream of the Leland Stanfords
become a reality.
Everyone who has been associated
with the University—students, fac
ulty, donors, and friends—all be
long to the Stanford Family, and ac
cording to tradition the University
in some degree be 1 onus to them.
With this Family relationship comes
a sense of possession and kinship
and also a feeling of responsibility
toward the group.
The Family idea started back
with the founding of the Farm
when "the going was tough" and
the country was predicting the
failure of the enterprise. Senator
and Mrs. Stanford as founders and
trustees were an intimate part of
campus life, and the students and
the faculty had to work together
to make the University succeed.
The enrollment was small so nat
urally everyone knew everyone
else.
The "hello" custom grew outof
this close association. Years ago it
was a common thing to greet every
one on the campus, but since the
University has grown, it is impos
sible to maintain acquaintance with
everybody. Yet this feeling of
friendliness has survived to such an
extent that visitors invariably arc
impressed by the congeniality dis
played on campus.
Close student and faculty rela
tionships outside of the classroom
arc an ever-present evidence »>f
the Family tradition. Faculty
members often have informal
gatherings or after-dinner coffees
in their own homes. I)r. Tresidder
has weekly Music at Home con
certs of recorded music for stu
dents and faculty. In activities
such as the Junior Water Carnival
and the Spring Sing both work to
gether and participate in the fun.
The student body, large as it is,
manages to maintain a high degree

of congeniality and co-operation.
Fundamental to the idea of the
Stanford Family are the traditions
j of student self-government and the
! Honor Code. Each requires con-
