# Election Bliss Almost Trips Unwary Excom
## 
### 
Excom's winter quarter election
gravy-train hit a snag last night and
almost piled up in a tangle of con
stitutional technicalities.
Cause of the legal mixup arose
from an amendment to A.S.S.U. con
stitution by-laws made last week
by Excom, and brought to that
body's attention by Tom Elke. Elec
tion Board member, last night in a
petition.
The amendment canceled the
one-month waiting period between
nomination and election of yell
leaders, so that yell leader candi
dates nominated last week by
Rally Committee would he eli
gible to run on yesterday's ballot.
However, the constitution also
provides that by-law changes do not
take effect until after the next Ex
' com meeting. And furthermore, any
I petition signed by at least 150 reg
j istered students protesting such a
j by-law change before that next
| Excom meeting, nullifies the change
I and nullifies any election held un
der its provisions.
And this is just exactly what
the petition presented by Elke
did. It stated that Excom had
i acted illegally in calling an clec
; (ion based on a constitutional
i amendment not yet in effect.
"This is a clear case of unconsti
j tutionality," Elke declared, "and I
I think it's about time Excom assumes
| responsibility for the mistakes it
makes."
Investigating the possibilities of
holding a special election next
month to clear up the difficulty,
Election Board Chairman Gordon
Ness said such an election would be
impossible. The constitution pro
vides for only one A.S.S.U. election
each quarter, he reported, and the
j valid council returns had used up
j the winter allotment.
Several solutions offered to a red
| faced Excom were turned down for
! not complying with the letter of
! ronstitutional law.
"One man is trying to put stu
| dent government in derision,"
i Frank Creede, Toyon representa
tive, charged.
"If one man can put student
government in derision," Elke re
torted. "then it's time student
government headed for the round
house."
Admitting that he was trying to
; teach Excom a lesson, Elke refused
to withdraw the petition, admitting
he was powerless to do so once it
was submitted.
Acting on the recommendation
of 11. I). Thoreau. Kxcom finally
withdrew last week's amendment,
thereby invalidating the petition,
and recommended that a consti
tutional reorganization committee
j he set up to iron out constitution
i hamstrings.
Excom also:
1. Heard a "State of the 1.5.C."
report from Chairman Niel Allen.
The survey committee, Allen said,
will be one quarter old next Wed
nesday. On that day Allen will re
! port to Excom on the activities and
' needs of the I.S.C. He told the Daily
last night that Sweden had been
substituted for Palestine on this
summer's itinerary.
2. Appointed Men's Council mem
ber Stan Shpetner to the Union
! Board of Governors.
3. Heard a request from Bill Ei
; Ins of KSU to get. an impartial
j A.S.S.U. report »>n student reaction
to the campus radio station, to be
presented to a faculty committee
early next month when the KSU

Filers also asked transfer of
| KSI! funds. appropriated last
j quarter for a special 13 - week
{ Stanford broadcast series, to the
J radio workshop for use on Stan
ford broadcasts from San Fran
cisco or San Jose stations.
4. Decided that Stan Shpetner
j had been elected for long - term
: service on Men's Council by virtue
of vote superiority over the short -
I t°rm member, Dick Bartlc. Bartle'.s

Excom's winter quarter election
gravy-train hit a snag last night and
almost piled up in a tangle of con
stitutional technicalities.
Cause of the legal mixup arose
from an amendment to A.S.S.U. con
stitution by-laws made last week
by Excom, and brought to that
body's attention by Tom Elke. Elec
tion Board member, last night in a
petition.
The amendment canceled the
one-month waiting period between
nomination and election of yell
leaders, so that yell leader candi
dates nominated last week by
Rally Committee would he eli
gible to run on yesterday's ballot.
However, the constitution also
provides that by-law changes do not
take effect until after the next Ex
' com meeting. And furthermore, any
I petition signed by at least 150 reg
j istered students protesting such a
j by-law change before that next
| Excom meeting, nullifies the change
I and nullifies any election held un
der its provisions.
And this is just exactly what
the petition presented by Elke
did. It stated that Excom had
i acted illegally in calling an clec
; (ion based on a constitutional
i amendment not yet in effect.
"This is a clear case of unconsti
j tutionality," Elke declared, "and I
I think it's about time Excom assumes
| responsibility for the mistakes it
makes."
Investigating the possibilities of
holding a special election next
month to clear up the difficulty,
Election Board Chairman Gordon
Ness said such an election would be
impossible. The constitution pro
vides for only one A.S.S.U. election
each quarter, he reported, and the
j valid council returns had used up
j the winter allotment.

to withdraw the petition, admitting

was submitted.
