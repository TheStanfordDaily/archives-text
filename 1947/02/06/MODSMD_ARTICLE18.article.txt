# Rich Speaks At Vocom

### BETTYLU SULLIVAN 
Encouraging women who want to
succeed in the international rela
t.ions field to have determination and
persistence, Dr. James Watkins told
the audience at the Vocom meeting
last night to become experts in their
field at home. In this way they will
be more likely to qualify for posi
tions in foreign affairs.
Discouraging the Hollywood ideas
of the glamour of foreign service,
Sam Rich, graduate student in po
litical science here and former U.S.
vice-consul in Valencia, Spain,
stressed the routine of the work
and the lack of social life.
Mr. Rich explained that those in
terested would find the course in
international relations given here
valuable. With an A.B. degree and
several months' cramming in Wash
ington to pass the difficult test re
quired for foreign service, women
can get into the service.
