### DEE KEATLEY 
"Christianity today is considered
an elective, not practical, not per
tinent," declared Arnold Gruniger,
Jr., a prominent San Francisco in
vestment banker and vice-president
of the International Christian Busi
nessmen's Committee, in his talk
last, night on "Christian Works" in
Cubberley Auditorium at 8.
Mr. Gruniger feels that Christian
ity today is in a decline. "If we
continue at the rate we are going
today, we are lost," he said.
People should not have an in
feriority complex about loving
Christ, he asserted, but should
have enthusiasm about Christian
things.
"Stanford students have prob
lems God alone can solve il He were
given the chance. The world has
tried to do the job, but has failed."
He informed the audience that
more people would go to church if
the ministers would stop talking
about economic, social and political
affairs, and talk about the Bible and
Christ.
"We need Christianity in Amer
ica,"he announced, "and I am en
couraged with the intrest a few
Stanford students are taking in
this Spiritual Emphasis Week."
Many non-churchgoers are Chris
tians, he argued, and told about a
weekly Bible class in San Francisco
which is attended by 40 to 50 prom
inent business men, many of whom
do not go to curch.
