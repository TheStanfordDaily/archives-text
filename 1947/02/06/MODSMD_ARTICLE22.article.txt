# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Pettiness by Petition 
### 
Student elections, hammered in the past by
student sentiment and Daily editorials, have
edged their way toward reliability and compe
tent conduct over a period of a quarter and a
half. Gordon Ness—a freshman, completely
without experience—lour weeks ago took over
chairmanship of Election Board. He combed
previous Election Board reports, scurried about
to prevent possible mistakes and illegalities
railed to his attention by alert students, con
ducted a successful publicity campaign, held
-in"election undei Excom-revised by-laws, and
i< polled last night a two per cent increase in
!ting over the last election.
lixcom had asked tor and approved reports
j i plans toi the election, had revised its by
aws tc. piovide more constitutional powei and
reedom to the Election Board, and was dii gent
i) its efforts to improve the wobbly record of
i...si "-lections.
Somewhere in Rally Committee a constitu
tional slip-up was made - L ~ it did nut submit
lor Excorn approval a list of yell-yeadei candi
dates one month in advance uf the elections.
(They were away on Christmas vacation at the
I:me ) An abnormal situation, prompted by the
mass resignation of yell leaders last quarter
.md hally Corn's indecisive actions, reopened
the yell leader tryouts this quarter, and final
candidate selections were not presented to
llx.com until last week.
Excorn at Ness' suggestion then consulted
the Hally Com by-laws and saw a change was
needed to insure legality of the election yes
terday. They made the change, in good faith.
I..tie, to be sure, since by-law changes do not
<j > into effect until the next Excom meeting,
but in good faith.
Excom could not but accept the responsi
bility for such a technical mistake, could have
wriggled out of a new election by a similar
technicality.
Not a chance. A petition, signed by 154

I
students, was brought to the A.S.S.U. vice
president, calling for the by law change to be
put to an all-student vote, thus invalidating
Excom's action of the week before, and making
illegal the election of yell leaders. Tom Elke,
initiator of the petition, explained that his pri
mary interest was not in the by-law change
itself, but in demonstrating that once again
Excorn had acted extra-legally. "To teach them
a lesson," he said.
Technically Mr. Elke and his 153 supporters
are completely within their constitutional
rights. Their request would legally have
prompted an election to approve a by-law, fol
lowed by an election for the cheerleaders—in
curring much expense to the A.S.S.U., dis
couraging publicity for Excom, and all student
elections henceforth, and doubtless the com
plete discredit ot Hrtlly Committee
But we vehemently piotest the of
the 154, wKiose petty actions demonstKted a
complete lack of faith in Excom, a desire to
cripple student government tor the Jengtn of
time it takes a student body to forget un
favorable comment.
We feel that Excom and Election Board ac
tions since the last election tie up do not merit
such public discredit. We further feel that the
students who accepted responsibility lor sign
ing such a petition would have agreed with us
if they had taken the additional responsibility
of checking on the actions of each group.
The point of illegality could have been
made effectively and constructively without
deliberately calling two more elections and in
curring unnecessary expense.
We trust that Excom, who wriggled out of
the new election by retracting the by-law
change and approving the election as "per
formed in the spirit of the constitution," will
continue to work on improving the election
set-up, and will not be hampered by further
crippling petitions.

I..tie, to be sure, since by-law changes do not
<j > into effect until the next Excom meeting,
but in good faith.
Excom could not but accept the responsi
bility for such a technical mistake, could have
wriggled out of a new election by a similar
technicality.
Not a chance. A petition, signed by 154

I
students, was brought to the A.S.S.U. vice
president, calling for the by law change to be
put to an all-student vote, thus invalidating
Excom's action of the week before, and making
illegal the election of yell leaders. Tom Elke,
initiator of the petition, explained that his pri
mary interest was not in the by-law change
itself, but in demonstrating that once again
Excorn had acted extra-legally. "To teach them
a lesson," he said.
Technically Mr. Elke and his 153 supporters
are completely within their constitutional
rights. Their request would legally have
prompted an election to approve a by-law, fol
lowed by an election for the cheerleaders—in
curring much expense to the A.S.S.U., dis
couraging publicity for Excom, and all student
elections henceforth, and doubtless the com
plete discredit ot Hrtlly Committee
But we vehemently piotest the of
the 154, wKiose petty actions demonstKted a
complete lack of faith in Excom, a desire to
cripple student government tor the Jengtn of
time it takes a student body to forget un
favorable comment.
We feel that Excom and Election Board ac
tions since the last election tie up do not merit
such public discredit. We further feel that the
students who accepted responsibility lor sign
ing such a petition would have agreed with us
if they had taken the additional responsibility
of checking on the actions of each group.
The point of illegality could have been
made effectively and constructively without
deliberately calling two more elections and in
curring unnecessary expense.
We trust that Excom, who wriggled out of
the new election by retracting the by-law
change and approving the election as "per
formed in the spirit of the constitution," will
continue to work on improving the election
set-up, and will not be hampered by further
crippling petitions.
