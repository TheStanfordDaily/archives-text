### BILL COUGHLIN 
First, to clear up a few misunderstandings. There
was no intention that Tuesday's column should be
anonymous. I wrote it. The name was inadvertently
I'll nil" when the page was made up.
Second, 1 unfortunately cannot take the credit for
I lie classified ad in yesterday's Daily on the same
subject. There's an anonymous genius somewhere
on campus.
(Incidentally, a card criticizing Tuesday's col
umn and the fact that it was anonymous arrived at
I he Shack in today's mail, implying that the name
was left off on purpose. Who wrote the card? I dun
no, it was signed—"Anonymous"!)
* * *
Don't forget (how could you?) that today is Hello
Day. Be sure to say hello to everybody on Quad. It
may make you 45 minutes late to class but whatthe
heck! And don't forget our slogan, "You May Hate
Their Guts but Remember to Say Hello."

A rough in one of the tongs has acquired a Dal
matian. (No, junior, that's a dog, not a South
American exchange student.) Dog was reclining in
one of the easy chairs last weekend, sleeping peace
fully late in the evening, when a brother (no. junior,
not of the dog) came home slightly the worse for a
lew brews.
The brother sat in the chair with the dog, strok
ii» v'. the animal in a sickly fashion. Then it happened.

The rough got sick and the poor dog was unfortu
nately in the way.
The boys now contend that the animal is no
longer a Dalmatian but a bird dog.

HAVE YOU HEARD:
That Stanford's supposedly adult women arc re
quired to have their names checked off a list, cer
tifying that they have taken a shower, after each gym
class?
That Stanford's supposedly adult women who
leave to go skiing on a Thursday night, missing Fri
day classes*, are required to forfeit a late leave for
each class missed? But that if they leave Friday
morning, it doesn't make any difference?
That Stanford's supposedly adult women who
came back on the second reg day of this quarter,
after estimating three weeks before that they might
get back dn the first, were given lockouts for the
night when they weren't even registered in the Uni
versity?
That Stanford's supposedly adult women who put
up with a system like this obviously aren't very
adult at all?
* * *
Once again, this is a "last" column. Volume 110
ends tomorrow and with it ends Coughlin's term as
Daily Bull Sessioner. No sob story. Just thought I'd
mention it, so you won't think the Gestapo kicked me
out. (Famous last words.)
