That Germany is a problem is nothing new; how
< wr, since it discussed in yesterday's Daily,
jiliis, 1 tliiiik. is an'appropriate, time 16 offer my conV
Jlri buttons. « ■!' ; :
In his "It concerns Us." Ralph Hovis offered some
tentative conclusions on Germany. He invited, fur
ther consideration, and I would say that further .con
sideration was necessary.
I agree that the effects of German unity have
been undesirable. That is, if it is remembered that,
in the precise sense of the word, Germany attained
unity only under Adolf Hitler. The Republic was
a federal state; the Empire of 1871-1918 was a fed
eral state; beyond that we must go back to the 14th
or 15th centuries to find anything more than a loose
confederation. If, on the other hand, the Allies are
to attempt to stifle every vestige of nationalism in
the German mind and heart, they might as well line
up and shoot about 90 per cent of the population. If
Brandenburgers and Bavarians, Swabians, Hessions,
and Lubeckers all think that they are Germans and
each other's countrymen, how else can you stop
them?
It was suggested that Germany must be de-Prus
sianized. the meaning of the term is not clear.
Mow not clear it is is obvious when we remember
that the recent war was primarily the work of a
man born in Austria who found his earliest and most
ardent supporters in conservative, Catholic Bavaria.
I might even point out that the best organized and
most nearly successful attempt to overthrow the
Fuehrer was made by a group largely composed of
professional German army officers, Prussian Junkers
if you like the phrase. But these are mere facts.
Another of these tentative conclusions is that the
Ruhr, Saar, and Rhineland must be. and stay, sepa
rated from Germany. Again, how? Are we to at

tempt to expel the present population and resettle
those valleys with DP's? Or should we set up an
international authority to use these German miners
and. mill-workers-.as slave labor for the benefit of
their conquerors. Both sound, distinctly jimpraeticiil
and morally unsound. Besides which, international
administration would probably make every pay
raise or reduction and every technical improvement
or alteration an item on the agenda of the Security
Council.
Finally, it was tentatively concluded in one breath
that a strong, united Germany can never be a de
pendable ally and in the next, a few lines below, that
since we cannot use force forever to prevent Ger
man restoration, we must teach the Germans that
aggression does not pay and educate them to form a
peaceable state, liberal and democratic, where the
majority will rule and the minorities be unoppressed.
If this goal can be attained — and I am optimist
enough to hope that it can—then I would venture to
say that Germany would be a worthy member of
the United Nations. States with fewer qualifications
are currently in better standing. Would she not
then lie a.s dependable an ally as Argentina or Yugo
slavia?
The question to be raised now is, what are my
suggestions? They are two. The first—the occupation
of Germany must continue until some measure of
supervised reconstruction has ben put under way
and until a federal German government has been
set up; thereafter, international inspection and su
pervision must be maintained until the process of
reconstruction is complete. Second—an economic
union of Europe must be established; a customs, cur
rency, and passport union within which every citi
zen of a member nation can travel and trade. That
seems to me to be the best insurance against a recur
rence of Hitlerism anywhere in Europe.

set up; thereafter, international inspection and su
pervision must be maintained until the process of
reconstruction is complete. Second—an economic
union of Europe must be established; a customs, cur
rency, and passport union within which every citi
zen of a member nation can travel and trade. That
seems to me to be the best insurance against a recur

That Germany is a problem is nothing new; how

In his "It concerns Us." Ralph Hovis offered some
tentative conclusions on Germany. He invited, fur
ther consideration, and I would say that further .con
sideration was necessary.
I agree that the effects of German unity have
been undesirable. That is, if it is remembered that,
in the precise sense of the word, Germany attained
unity only under Adolf Hitler. The Republic was
a federal state; the Empire of 1871-1918 was a fed
eral state; beyond that we must go back to the 14th
or 15th centuries to find anything more than a loose
confederation. If, on the other hand, the Allies are
to attempt to stifle every vestige of nationalism in
the German mind and heart, they might as well line
up and shoot about 90 per cent of the population. If
Brandenburgers and Bavarians, Swabians, Hessions,
and Lubeckers all think that they are Germans and
each other's countrymen, how else can you stop
them?
It was suggested that Germany must be de-Prus
sianized. the meaning of the term is not clear.
Mow not clear it is is obvious when we remember
that the recent war was primarily the work of a
man born in Austria who found his earliest and most
ardent supporters in conservative, Catholic Bavaria.
I might even point out that the best organized and
most nearly successful attempt to overthrow the
Fuehrer was made by a group largely composed of
professional German army officers, Prussian Junkers
if you like the phrase. But these are mere facts.
Another of these tentative conclusions is that the
Ruhr, Saar, and Rhineland must be. and stay, sepa
rated from Germany. Again, how? Are we to at

tempt to expel the present population and resettle
those valleys with DP's? Or should we set up an
international authority to use these German miners
and. mill-workers-.as slave labor for the benefit of
their conquerors. Both sound, distinctly jimpraeticiil
and morally unsound. Besides which, international
administration would probably make every pay
raise or reduction and every technical improvement
or alteration an item on the agenda of the Security
Council.
Finally, it was tentatively concluded in one breath
that a strong, united Germany can never be a de
pendable ally and in the next, a few lines below, that
since we cannot use force forever to prevent Ger
man restoration, we must teach the Germans that
aggression does not pay and educate them to form a
peaceable state, liberal and democratic, where the
majority will rule and the minorities be unoppressed.
If this goal can be attained — and I am optimist
enough to hope that it can—then I would venture to
say that Germany would be a worthy member of
the United Nations. States with fewer qualifications
are currently in better standing. Would she not
then lie a.s dependable an ally as Argentina or Yugo
slavia?
The question to be raised now is, what are my
suggestions? They are two. The first—the occupation
of Germany must continue until some measure of
supervised reconstruction has ben put under way
and until a federal German government has been
set up; thereafter, international inspection and su
pervision must be maintained until the process of
reconstruction is complete. Second—an economic
union of Europe must be established; a customs, cur
