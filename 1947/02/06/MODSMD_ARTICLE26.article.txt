# Ford Reveals Poet Herrick As Active Man
## 
### 
Robert Herrick must have been
quite a gay old gentleman. This
was the impression Tuesday after
noon as Newell Ford road from his
poetry in another of this quarter's
poetry readings.
Herrick wrote of wine, women,
and song. Ho wrote of good wine,
t>ood song, and good and bad
women.
He wrote with warmth and vi
vacity of his love for spirits. Mr.
Ford compared this sort of writing
with that of the intellectuals of to
day who write in their "dry barren
attics and rearrange their dusty
bones." ,
He wrote of bad women. He
composed epigrams to women he
hated. He used all the words within
his command to scorn them.
And he wrote of the women he [
loved. Particularly Julia, one of his :
mistresses. He told of the bee who
mistook Julia's lips for a flower and I
sipped enough sweet syrup from
them to fill hive
He wrote of the vision of his mad
and sometime,s coarse love for
Diana.
