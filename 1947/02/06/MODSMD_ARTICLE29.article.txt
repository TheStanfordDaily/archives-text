Last week' an editorial appeared in this newspaper which stated that
the Stanford administration vv.a.s to be commended for its policy of not
letting down the scholastic bars for "tramp" athletes and otherwise de
ficient students.
Ferris Boothe (the editorial author) also fired a verbal broadside at
a "certain Peninsula columnist" who criticized this school when two ath
letes were denied admittance recently. That particular columnist happens
to be Walt Gamage ol the Palo Alto Times, and the two athletes concerned
were Giant Denmark and Bill Sheridan.
You might now be thinking that these two paragraphs are just the pre
liminaries for a barrage of criticism against the editorial, and the so-called
athletic policy of Stanford. 'Tisn't so, my friend, for I agree whole
heart "dly with the Daily edit. Our views were stated repeatedly on the
subject last spring, when the subject of athletes was flying high and wide
around the campus.
This is the hone of contention:
Last spring quarter, in tiie capacity of sports editor. I talked to Mr.
Stalnaker for several hours on the subject of athletics. The Dean re
marked that a number of years ago he had made a thorough survey on
the subject of athletics for a Mid-Western university, and had found
that athletics plav an integral part in college life. Without athletics, there
is something lacking in the collegiate diet.
Frankly, I was very glad to hear this from Mr. Stalnaker. because sev
eral days previous to our conversation, he had stated to a member of the
Editorial Board, "It doesn't make any difference to me whether there are
intramural or intercollegiate athletics at Stanford."
IVfr. Stalnaker went on to say that no favors would be shown athletes
in admittance requirements. But then he dropped a verbal bombshell in
the conversation.
lie stated that some athletes who had the minimum requirements for
entering Stanford would still be denied entrance because they didn't
happen to come up to the level of other applicants.
This is a practical example of what I mean: Andy Schmoe is a football
player at Grossmont High School who meets all the requirements and
passes all the tests to enter Stanford. But up at Escondido Hi, there is a
prodigy who studies all the time, has straight A's, and in general doesn't
know much about nothin' except what's in the textbooks. As a result of
our latter friend, Andy is denied entrance to Stanford.
'I hat's where I think Mr. Stalnakcr is absolutely wrong. Whether
any such cases have arisen yet is not the point. The crux of the argu
ment is that if such a thought looms up with the Dean of Students, it
might unxpectcdly pop up and raise havoc.
If Mr. Stalnaker feels that intramurals are just as important as
intercollegiate sports, he hasn't let his convictions take hold of his ac
tions yet. Maybe he changed his mind in the space of two days when
lie made the statement .and when I talked to him.
1 think you readers will heartily agree that no student who might
participate in extracurricular activities, particularly sports, should be de
nied admittance merely because he doesn't measure up to some student
who studies all the time. Stanford needs both types of men. Bftth will
make their contribution to Stanford life in their respective fields. There
lore, judging one against the other is certainly not a fair comparison.

liminaries for a barrage of criticism against the editorial, and the so-called
athletic policy of Stanford. 'Tisn't so, my friend, for I agree whole
heart "dly with the Daily edit. Our views were stated repeatedly on the
subject last spring, when the subject of athletes was flying high and wide
around the campus.
This is the hone of contention:
Last spring quarter, in tiie capacity of sports editor. I talked to Mr.
Stalnaker for several hours on the subject of athletics. The Dean re
marked that a number of years ago he had made a thorough survey on
the subject of athletics for a Mid-Western university, and had found
that athletics plav an integral part in college life. Without athletics, there
is something lacking in the collegiate diet.
Frankly, I was very glad to hear this from Mr. Stalnaker. because sev
eral days previous to our conversation, he had stated to a member of the
Editorial Board, "It doesn't make any difference to me whether there are
intramural or intercollegiate athletics at Stanford."
IVfr. Stalnaker went on to say that no favors would be shown athletes
in admittance requirements. But then he dropped a verbal bombshell in
the conversation.
lie stated that some athletes who had the minimum requirements for
entering Stanford would still be denied entrance because they didn't
happen to come up to the level of other applicants.
This is a practical example of what I mean: Andy Schmoe is a football
player at Grossmont High School who meets all the requirements and
passes all the tests to enter Stanford. But up at Escondido Hi, there is a
prodigy who studies all the time, has straight A's, and in general doesn't
know much about nothin' except what's in the textbooks. As a result of
our latter friend, Andy is denied entrance to Stanford.
'I hat's where I think Mr. Stalnakcr is absolutely wrong. Whether
any such cases have arisen yet is not the point. The crux of the argu
ment is that if such a thought looms up with the Dean of Students, it
might unxpectcdly pop up and raise havoc.
If Mr. Stalnaker feels that intramurals are just as important as
intercollegiate sports, he hasn't let his convictions take hold of his ac
tions yet. Maybe he changed his mind in the space of two days when
lie made the statement .and when I talked to him.
1 think you readers will heartily agree that no student who might
participate in extracurricular activities, particularly sports, should be de
nied admittance merely because he doesn't measure up to some student
who studies all the time. Stanford needs both types of men. Bftth will
make their contribution to Stanford life in their respective fields. There
lore, judging one against the other is certainly not a fair comparison.
Last week' an editorial appeared in this newspaper which stated that
the Stanford administration vv.a.s to be commended for its policy of not
letting down the scholastic bars for "tramp" athletes and otherwise de
ficient students.
Ferris Boothe (the editorial author) also fired a verbal broadside at
a "certain Peninsula columnist" who criticized this school when two ath
letes were denied admittance recently. That particular columnist happens
to be Walt Gamage ol the Palo Alto Times, and the two athletes concerned
were Giant Denmark and Bill Sheridan.
You might now be thinking that these two paragraphs are just the pre
liminaries for a barrage of criticism against the editorial, and the so-called
athletic policy of Stanford. 'Tisn't so, my friend, for I agree whole
