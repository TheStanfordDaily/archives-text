# Farm Nine To Open Up
## 
### ART LUBIC 
With only one intra-quad practice
! game under its belt, Stanford's un
heralded baseball varsity kicks the
lid off the '47 campaign Saturday
j afternoon when the boys from the
' Farm host the Weitner Motors nine
of Burlingame on liie Sunken Dia
j mond.
Coaches Harry Wolter and Ray
j Hammett, faced with an overflow
turnout of close to 100 candidates
at the beginning of the quarter, have
pared thq squad down to 73, picked
i the 35 most promising off as a tem
porary varsity and turned there
! mainder of the mob over to Carl
Kellenberger and Charley Bushong
| on the practice field.
PRACTICE SESSIONS
Last Saturday the Reds compris-
I ing the early season "first string"
i broke a 1-1 deadlock with three
markers in the last inning to clump
the Blues -1-1 in the first official
I looksee at the boys in action. Two
reserve teams wound up with a 5-0
j score after nine frames of regula
' tion play.
In the latter game second sacker
Clyde Dingfelder showed enough
poise in the field and at bat to
make the jump to this week's first
nine, showing just how well "set"
starting positions are at this early
date.
MERRIMAN AGAIN
A rundown of the tentative open
ing lineup reveals six former foot
ballers, headed by Lloyd Merri
man, at the top of a well-polished
list. Merriman, who earned the
title of "Mr. Football" on the grid
last fall, led the club in batting last
year and seems destined to become
"Mr. Baseball" before too many
dawns pass.
In the outfield, in addition to
Merriman, are Wayne Erickson,
converted second sacker and speed
burner from Marchy Schwartz'
flashy eleven, and heavy-hitting Lou
Gowans, a transfer from Caltech
where he led the College Confer
ence hitters.
The infield has Benny Cardinalli
on first, the aforementioned Ding
felder at the keystone spot. Buck
Brownson on short, and Ralph Dav
is at third base.
CARDINALLY BROWNSON BACK
Both Cardinalli and Brownson
have had past diamond experience
wearing the cardinal in addition to
their gridiron cavortings, Benny
playing frosh ball back in '42 and
Buck holding down the shortfield
job on last year's outfit. Davis
gained hot corner experience at
Redlands and has moved neatly in
to the swing of things under head
man Wolter, qualifying as a fine
fielder and heavy hitter—just about
the two top prerequisites of a good
ball player.
Dick Flatland and Charley Wake
field will handle the mound chores
j Saturday, getting the call over a
! dozen promising prospects. The
\ Farm's hill corps has brought noth
ing but. smiles to date from the
coaching staff.
Behind the bat are two more ex
perienced performers—Ward Walk
up, captain of the 1943 team, and
| Frank McGraw, a regular back
| from last year's outfit.
All in all the squad sizes up well
I and prospects are bright for a suc
cessful campaign. The spirit and
hustle to date on the Sunken Dia
! mond cannot be matched, with all
hands in that winning mood.
