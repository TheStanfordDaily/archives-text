# Cagers Prep For Trojans
## 
### ART SHAPIRO 
Without the full services of Dave
Davidson, ailing forward, the Stan
lord basketball quintet will have
more than their share of work cut
out for them when they* board the
Daylight today, for the hinterlands
of Los Angeles. Faced with the
prospect of two contests against
the most underrated five in the
southern division <>1 the conference,
the Indians will be forced to spot
the Trojans an offensive advantage,
because of the inability of David
son to go through an entire contest.
IN THK FACE OF ADVERSITIES
Davidson was out yesterday lor
the team's last practice session in
these parts before they leave for
the southland, but he obviously
was not up to his usual form and
Milt Ivcrson had to substitute
for him. When questioned as to
the team's chances in these twin
frays with the Trojans, Coach
Everett Dean opined. "It looks as
if Dave Davidson will not be able
to sec too much action during this
trip. We will miss his leadership
and accurate eye. Nevertheless I
am counting on two good games
from the boys because this team
possesses the fibre that helps them
do their best in the face of ad
versities."
Milt Iverson, who shared the for
ward position with Davidson dur
ing the workout last night per
formed capably, and gave reason
able assurances that he would ably
lill the spot vacated by Dave with
finesse and drive. Davidson will
probably start the games against
USC, but Milt will be held ready on
the bench for any and all emerg
encies.
BERLIN AM) HIGGINS STAR
The C squad worked out with
the varsity and went over the
Trojan plays in an effort to fa
miliarize the starters with (he
USC offense. Babe lliggins and
Dick Berlin showed up excellently
as they worked pick - off and
screen plays under the back
board. Milt Iverson added some
pepper to the team's offensive as
lie went in to the keyhole, cut
across and tossed in some beau
tiful lay-ups. Morley Thompson,
star of the Saturday victory over
the Broncos was setting up the
plays on the court and holding
back on the sharpshooting during
the session, but he did manage to
pop in a few from outside the
foul line.
The crew which will be making
the excursion Trojan-ward includes:
Dick Berlin, Bob Lewis, Morley
Thompson, Dave Davidson, Babe
Higgins; Steve Stephenson, Gene
Martin, Gus Chavalas, Bill Drehobl,
Milt Iverson, and Ralph Carver. The
I twelfth man on the squad will not
I be chosen until this morning.

trip. We will miss his leadership
and accurate eye. Nevertheless I
am counting on two good games
from the boys because this team
possesses the fibre that helps them
do their best in the face of ad
versities."
Milt Iverson, who shared the for
ward position with Davidson dur
ing the workout last night per
formed capably, and gave reason
able assurances that he would ably
lill the spot vacated by Dave with
finesse and drive. Davidson will
probably start the games against
USC, but Milt will be held ready on
the bench for any and all emerg
encies.
BERLIN AM) HIGGINS STAR
The C squad worked out with
the varsity and went over the
Trojan plays in an effort to fa
miliarize the starters with (he
USC offense. Babe lliggins and
Dick Berlin showed up excellently
as they worked pick - off and
screen plays under the back
board. Milt Iverson added some
pepper to the team's offensive as
lie went in to the keyhole, cut
across and tossed in some beau
tiful lay-ups. Morley Thompson,
star of the Saturday victory over
the Broncos was setting up the
plays on the court and holding
back on the sharpshooting during
the session, but he did manage to
pop in a few from outside the
foul line.
The crew which will be making
the excursion Trojan-ward includes:
Dick Berlin, Bob Lewis, Morley
Thompson, Dave Davidson, Babe
Higgins; Steve Stephenson, Gene
Martin, Gus Chavalas, Bill Drehobl,
Milt Iverson, and Ralph Carver. The
I twelfth man on the squad will not
I be chosen until this morning.
Without the full services of Dave
Davidson, ailing forward, the Stan
lord basketball quintet will have
more than their share of work cut
out for them when they* board the
Daylight today, for the hinterlands
of Los Angeles. Faced with the
prospect of two contests against
the most underrated five in the
southern division <>1 the conference,
the Indians will be forced to spot
the Trojans an offensive advantage,
because of the inability of David
son to go through an entire contest.
IN THK FACE OF ADVERSITIES
Davidson was out yesterday lor
the team's last practice session in
these parts before they leave for
the southland, but he obviously
was not up to his usual form and
Milt Ivcrson had to substitute
for him. When questioned as to
the team's chances in these twin
frays with the Trojans, Coach
Everett Dean opined. "It looks as
if Dave Davidson will not be able
to sec too much action during this
trip. We will miss his leadership
and accurate eye. Nevertheless I
am counting on two good games
from the boys because this team
possesses the fibre that helps them
do their best in the face of ad
versities."
