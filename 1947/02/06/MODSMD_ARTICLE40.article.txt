# Students, Warren Meet in Sacramento
## 
### 
By PAULA NUSSER
"Now, I got it straight from the
Governor —"
And we 2!) political science stu
dents did get it straight from Gov.
Earl Warren of California, not a
statement as to his candidacy for
tin? presidency, but a prediction that
the basketball team of Cal, the Gov
ernor's alma' mater, was going to
avenge Nov. 23's Big Game.
This visit last week to the blue
and gold office of California's Gov
ernor highlighted the three-day trip
of the students and Professor Rob
ert H. Connery to Sacramento.
SENATE IN ACTION
Textbook chapters on American
government were turned into vivid
realities for the group. They had
read about Senate procedure; last
Tuesday they were taken down on
the Senate floor, watched California
Senators debate and pass state bills.
The group had studied pages on
committee hearings; Tuesday they
sat in a crowded room in the Capi
tol building listening to heated pros
and cons on a bill delegated to the
Senate Committee on Finance.
By 7:30 p.m. Sunday the last
stragglers had arrived at the El
Rancho Hotel, the group's head
uarters. The latecomers t had pre
sented an array of excuses ranging
from that of one student who tried
to reach Sacramento via Modesto to
another who had one traffic ticket,
had run out of gas, and had been
slowed down for 30 miles by an
obstinate truck all in one afternoon.
HKAR COUNSEL SPEAK
In a banquet room whose French
doors opened out on the hotel's
swimming poul, students and Stan
fold alumni were addressed by
Fred Wood, one of the capital's top
legislative counsels. He described
his varied services to the law-mak
ing branch.
When questioned as to just how
political the office of counsel was.
he smiled slightly and remarked,
"Well, I guess you'd say we're poli
ticians surrounded by equal pres
sure on both sides."
Rising early for a morning ap
pointment. with the Department of
Public Works, the group listened to
and participated in discussions on
the pending highway bill and the
Central Valley development. G. T.
McCoy, state highway engineer,
stressed the place for university
students—both men and women—as
highway engineers and right-of
way agents.
LT. GOV., ALUM
Our luncheon date with Lt. Gov.
Goodwin Knight literally started
with a bang — a nervous waiter
dropped two trays of entrees at our
icet.
Lt. Gov. Knight, a Stanford
graduate, recalled his undergrad
uate days at the Farm when he
was in the same class as Don
Trcsiddcr. and how he had to
"wangle a degree" from the ad
ministration. He spoke of his close
friendship with Gov. Warren,
heightened by good-natured rib
bing about their respective
schools.
His interest in politics can be
traced back to Stanford where he (
wrote for the Alumni Review an j
article entitled "Are You Presiden- |
tial Timber?" Said Knight. "Ii
would recommend it as a good cure I
lor insomnia."' Questioned as to why I
he gave up a judge's salary for a I

| lieutenant governorship, he replied
I simply, "1 wanted to get into the big
I show."
QUERY JUDGE
The Budget and State Finance
Department was on the afternoon
j schedule, followed by a visit to the
I Supreme Court accompanied by
Justice A. A. Adams, one of Califor
nia's leading women judges. Dressed
in her somber black robes, she sat
in her high back chair in the im
j pressive chambers of the court,
while the students queried her
j about the court's practices.
Lobbying in the State Legislature
was carefully explained by Vincent
Kennedy, representative of the Re
tail Merchants Association, at a din
ner banquet at the Elks Club. "A
lobbyist," stated Kennedy, "has the
power to convince or confuse a leg
islator."
After the banquet, the male con
tingent of the group completely dis
! appeared, to the annoyance of the
eight women who were depending
on them for transportation. But
what were eight Stanford women
when an American Legion smoker
was going on on the same floor?
PALO ALTO SENATOR
Introduced to the Senate and As
sembly Tuesday morning by Sena
tor Byrl Salsman of Palo Alto and
Assemblyman Kirkwood, the group
was granted the privilege of the
floor for the day.
The California students visited
with the legislators from their own
districts, while others sat on the floor
of the two houses watching Senators
and Assemblymen, with feet on
desk, talking with a nearby legisla
tor or reading the newspapef while
the monotonous first reading of bills
took place. The group in the Senate
witnessed the change from the reg
ular session to the special session to
consider highway plans in exactly
two and one-half minutes.
A round-table with the Depart
ment of Employment followed
lunch, a meeting devoted primarily
to the employment welfare pro
gram, which included a tour through
the department's building.
WARREN CONFERENCE
In the Governor's outer room,
the anxious group waited 30 min
utes for the busy Governor to re
ceive them. Shaking hands warm
ly with each student, Gov. War
ren talked informally with the
group for a quarter of an hour
ranging in subject from the Big
Game to federal housing. As we
left he invited us to "just drop
in any time you're around."
The trip had its lighter moments
also. Sacramento's police depart
ment is richer this week by some
$10. All the men, confronted with
the capital's terrific parking prob
lem, were forced to park in two
hour zones only to hurry out time
and time again from a meeting to
find a small fag on their windshield. \
One enterprising student even tried
to get the Governor to "fix" his tick
et —but the Governor couldn't be
sold.
Our trip to Sacramento was a new j
experience in education at Stanford. |
We were taken from the lecture
room to the Legislature with the |
result that theory plus visible ap
plication gave each of us 29 students
a clear, more vivid picture of gov
ernment at work. Success of "Oper- j
ation Sacramento" should stand as
a model for similar ventures.
