# I.S.C. Travel Plans, Survey Methods Told
## 
### 
Itinerary for International Survey Committee student observ
ers in Europe will be a flexible schedule of visiting and travel
subject to the initiative of the student, I.S.C. head Niel Allen,
announced yesterday.
The students' work in France, Sweden, Spain and Greece will
be pre-arranged to some extent, but not on a minute-to-minute
basis, he said.

They will live primarily in private l
homes, in order to yain as close con
tact as possible with people in all
walks of life. Accommodations are
being arranged through Stanford
alumni, American nationals, the
embassies, foreign uiversities, and
the Rotary International. The Na
tional Students Organization for
eign travel bureau at Harvard is also
aiding the I.S.C. plans.
The itinerary is being arranged so
the visitors can meet people in in
dustrial and agricultural sections,
foreign government officers, foreign
business men, educators, and mem
bers of the professions. They will
attend any youth conferences tak
ing place in their areas.
LEAVE JULY l
Allen explained the choice of
France, Sweden, Greece and Spain
on these bases: accessibility, (which
ruled out the U.S.S.R.); financial
expense (the Orient would be too
costly to include); and strategic im
portance in international affairs.

Nada Skidmore, I.S.C. publicity
head announced that Alvin C. En
rich, academic vice-president of
Stanford, will be the university
administration member of I.S.C.'s
Selection Committee.

ers for the student body.

rangements will be settled after ;
