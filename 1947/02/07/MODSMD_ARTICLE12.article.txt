# "All God's Chillun' Got Babies"
## Li'l Injuns Get Thin-Walled Comfort, Say Village Parents 
### TOM SELF 
Babies of Stanford students arc
i luckier than the rest of 100,000 ba-
I bies on college campuses over the
| U.S. if a survey by the American
I Legion can be taken as criterion.
I The Legion, with screaming head
\ lines in a recent news letter, re- j
! ported a college G.I. baby crisis. It |
! painted rather a black picture of
1 the situation faced by married stu- j
| dents with children.
Somehow we couldn't believe
I things were quite that bad. at least
J not at Stanford. We decided to
1 look into the matter as it pertained
to the Fattn.
INVESTIGATION VILLAGE
Our investigation took us to the I
Stanford Village, where 123 student
j family groups with a total of 171 |
J youngsters live in the Stanford j
I VillaKe apartments.
Here we found not the crises and
emergency problems mentioned by ;
| the Legion, but happy, friendly |
i families living in comfortable quar- j
ters. Those who were expecting did j
not believe that a new arrival would j
precipitate a new family crisis.
SCHOOL ADVANTAGEOUS
Wives of students find school as
their husband s occupation has cer
tain advantages. When one of the
husbands has a night class, three or
four neighboring wives congregate

i in his house for bridge. Their hus
bands slay home to study and mind
the kids.
As for the children bothering
their old man when lie cracks the
books, Mrs. Mason Jones, whose
husband is an economics student,
J says, "Children won't bother my
i husband. Why wo even have a hen
} party while he's studying and it
doesn't disturb him."
KIDS LIKE CAMPUS
Campus life agrees with the chil —
j dren. They are happy to have so
j many playmates of their own age
| group. And by pooling their toys
| they have more than they can use.
Most of the wives have lived in
I army camps and are accustomed to
! lac k of comfort. Accordingly they
| were surprised to find that the Vil
j lage apartments were so comfor
table. They all hope the University
will complete more apartments soon
| so other married couples can share
i their good fortune,
PEOPLE FRIENDLY
Mrs. L. II. Harvey commented,
"People here at the Village are cer
tainly friendly. We find this a hap
py contrast to the snootiness we
sometimes encounter on the campus
and in Palo Alto. These apartments
arc the most comfortable of any
housing we've had since my hus-


YOU MIGHT THINK married students have a tough time studying with
their kids around. But look at Clifford Argall. He's preparing for two
