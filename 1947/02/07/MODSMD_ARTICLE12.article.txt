# "All God's Chillun' Got Babies"
## Li'l Injuns Get Thin-Walled Comfort, Say Village Parents 
### TOM SELF 
Babies of Stanford students arc
i luckier than the rest of 100,000 ba-
I bies on college campuses over the
| U.S. if a survey by the American
I Legion can be taken as criterion.
I The Legion, with screaming head
\ lines in a recent news letter, re- j
! ported a college G.I. baby crisis. It |
! painted rather a black picture of
1 the situation faced by married stu- j
| dents with children.
Somehow we couldn't believe
I things were quite that bad. at least
J not at Stanford. We decided to
1 look into the matter as it pertained
to the Fattn.
INVESTIGATION VILLAGE
Our investigation took us to the I
Stanford Village, where 123 student
j family groups with a total of 171 |
J youngsters live in the Stanford j
I VillaKe apartments.
Here we found not the crises and
emergency problems mentioned by ;
| the Legion, but happy, friendly |
i families living in comfortable quar- j
ters. Those who were expecting did j
not believe that a new arrival would j
precipitate a new family crisis.
SCHOOL ADVANTAGEOUS
Wives of students find school as
their husband s occupation has cer
tain advantages. When one of the
husbands has a night class, three or
four neighboring wives congregate

i in his house for bridge. Their hus
bands slay home to study and mind
the kids.
As for the children bothering
their old man when lie cracks the
books, Mrs. Mason Jones, whose
husband is an economics student,
J says, "Children won't bother my
i husband. Why wo even have a hen
} party while he's studying and it
doesn't disturb him."
KIDS LIKE CAMPUS
Campus life agrees with the chil —
j dren. They are happy to have so
j many playmates of their own age
| group. And by pooling their toys
| they have more than they can use.
Most of the wives have lived in
I army camps and are accustomed to
! lac k of comfort. Accordingly they
| were surprised to find that the Vil
j lage apartments were so comfor
table. They all hope the University
will complete more apartments soon
| so other married couples can share
i their good fortune,
PEOPLE FRIENDLY
Mrs. L. II. Harvey commented,
"People here at the Village are cer
tainly friendly. We find this a hap
py contrast to the snootiness we
sometimes encounter on the campus
and in Palo Alto. These apartments
arc the most comfortable of any
housing we've had since my hus-


YOU MIGHT THINK married students have a tough time studying with
their kids around. But look at Clifford Argall. He's preparing for two
exams with his three assistants, his son Don on his lap. his daughter

band has been in Kie army." Her
husband, Captain Harvey, is a civil
engineering student.
Perhaps the apartments are too
cozy in one respect; that is, the
walls are too thin. Several couples
remarked that the heads of their
beds touch the same wall as the
beds in the next apartment, and
they can hear every word that is
said—or whispered.
PROBLEMS GIVEN
Emergency problems of the cam
pus baby situation listed by the Le
gion are; wholly inadequate facili
ties for obstetrical care, shortages of
doctors, lack of hospital beds, lack
of nursery accommodations, and fi
nancial strain of the cost of babies
on G.I. budgets.
In the matter of doctors and hos
pitals Stanford seems rather well
off. The Village is definitely as
sured of a well-baby clinic through
the co-operation of Dr. George
Houek, director of the Health Serv
ice, and the San Mateo County
Health Department.
NURSERY NEEDED
Plans for a nursery have been
developed and one probably will be
established if the people want it,
Herbert J. Wunderlich, resident
counselor at the Village, said. There
is even a possibility that the per
son to head it will be the woman
who formerly had charge of Henry
Kaiser's company nursery.
Village mothers, though, don't
want a nursery as badly as they
do baby sitters. They love their
kids and want to take care of them.
But they do like to get out once in
a while.
CO-OPERATION A SOLUTION
Solution to the problem of the
campus baby situation, the Legion
says, is co-operation of college,
community, state and federal au
thorities. This the Farm seems to
have. Among the organizations that
have taken an interest in the mar
ried students are the Redwood City
Health Department, the Red Cross,
the City of Menlo Park, and Dr.
Hilgard's Psychology Department.
Because of the very high cost of
living peculiar to the Stanford-Palo
Alto area, married couples with
children do not fare much worse fi
nancially than single men. Expenses
of a single man, a recent survey
pointed out, are $145 a month, most
of which goes for room and board
and clothes maintenance.
Mrs. Clifford Argall said. "Yes,
we could use more money, but we
aren't complaining. The Village
apartments are quite comfortable."
Her husband is a graduate in bac
teriologv.

INVESTIGATION VILLAGE
Our investigation took us to the I
Stanford Village, where 123 student
j family groups with a total of 171 |
J youngsters live in the Stanford j
I VillaKe apartments.
Here we found not the crises and
emergency problems mentioned by ;
| the Legion, but happy, friendly |
i families living in comfortable quar- j
ters. Those who were expecting did j
not believe that a new arrival would j
precipitate a new family crisis.
SCHOOL ADVANTAGEOUS
Wives of students find school as
their husband s occupation has cer
tain advantages. When one of the
husbands has a night class, three or
four neighboring wives congregate

i in his house for bridge. Their hus
bands slay home to study and mind
the kids.
As for the children bothering
their old man when lie cracks the
books, Mrs. Mason Jones, whose
husband is an economics student,
J says, "Children won't bother my
i husband. Why wo even have a hen
} party while he's studying and it
doesn't disturb him."
KIDS LIKE CAMPUS
Campus life agrees with the chil —
j dren. They are happy to have so
j many playmates of their own age
| group. And by pooling their toys
| they have more than they can use.
Most of the wives have lived in
I army camps and are accustomed to
! lac k of comfort. Accordingly they
| were surprised to find that the Vil
j lage apartments were so comfor
table. They all hope the University
will complete more apartments soon
| so other married couples can share
i their good fortune,
PEOPLE FRIENDLY
Mrs. L. II. Harvey commented,
"People here at the Village are cer
tainly friendly. We find this a hap
py contrast to the snootiness we
sometimes encounter on the campus
and in Palo Alto. These apartments

husband, Captain Harvey, is a civil

Perhaps the apartments are too
cozy in one respect; that is, the
walls are too thin. Several couples
remarked that the heads of their
beds touch the same wall as the
beds in the next apartment, and
they can hear every word that is
said—or whispered.
PROBLEMS GIVEN
Emergency problems of the cam
pus baby situation listed by the Le
gion are; wholly inadequate facili
ties for obstetrical care, shortages of
doctors, lack of hospital beds, lack
of nursery accommodations, and fi
nancial strain of the cost of babies
on G.I. budgets.
In the matter of doctors and hos
pitals Stanford seems rather well
off. The Village is definitely as
sured of a well-baby clinic through
the co-operation of Dr. George
Houek, director of the Health Serv
ice, and the San Mateo County
Health Department.
NURSERY NEEDED
Plans for a nursery have been
developed and one probably will be
established if the people want it,
Herbert J. Wunderlich, resident
counselor at the Village, said. There
is even a possibility that the per
son to head it will be the woman
who formerly had charge of Henry
Kaiser's company nursery.
Village mothers, though, don't
want a nursery as badly as they
do baby sitters. They love their
kids and want to take care of them.
But they do like to get out once in
a while.
CO-OPERATION A SOLUTION
Solution to the problem of the
campus baby situation, the Legion
says, is co-operation of college,
community, state and federal au
thorities. This the Farm seems to
have. Among the organizations that
have taken an interest in the mar
ried students are the Redwood City
Health Department, the Red Cross,
the City of Menlo Park, and Dr.
Hilgard's Psychology Department.
Because of the very high cost of
living peculiar to the Stanford-Palo
Alto area, married couples with
children do not fare much worse fi
nancially than single men. Expenses
of a single man, a recent survey
pointed out, are $145 a month, most
of which goes for room and board
and clothes maintenance.
Mrs. Clifford Argall said. "Yes,
we could use more money, but we

we could use more money, but we

INVESTIGATION VILLAGE
Our investigation took us to the I
Stanford Village, where 123 student
j family groups with a total of 171 |
J youngsters live in the Stanford j
I VillaKe apartments.
Here we found not the crises and
emergency problems mentioned by ;
| the Legion, but happy, friendly |
i families living in comfortable quar- j
ters. Those who were expecting did j
not believe that a new arrival would j
precipitate a new family crisis.
SCHOOL ADVANTAGEOUS
Wives of students find school as
their husband s occupation has cer
tain advantages. When one of the
husbands has a night class, three or
four neighboring wives congregate

i in his house for bridge. Their hus
bands slay home to study and mind
the kids.
As for the children bothering
their old man when lie cracks the
books, Mrs. Mason Jones, whose
husband is an economics student,
J says, "Children won't bother my
i husband. Why wo even have a hen
} party while he's studying and it
doesn't disturb him."
KIDS LIKE CAMPUS
Campus life agrees with the chil —
j dren. They are happy to have so
j many playmates of their own age
| group. And by pooling their toys
| they have more than they can use.
Most of the wives have lived in
I army camps and are accustomed to
! lac k of comfort. Accordingly they
| were surprised to find that the Vil
j lage apartments were so comfor
table. They all hope the University
will complete more apartments soon
| so other married couples can share
i their good fortune,
PEOPLE FRIENDLY
Mrs. L. II. Harvey commented,
"People here at the Village are cer
tainly friendly. We find this a hap
py contrast to the snootiness we
sometimes encounter on the campus
and in Palo Alto. These apartments
arc the most comfortable of any

their kids around. But look at Clifford Argall. He's preparing for two

band has been in Kie army." Her
husband, Captain Harvey, is a civil
engineering student.
Perhaps the apartments are too
cozy in one respect; that is, the
walls are too thin. Several couples
remarked that the heads of their
beds touch the same wall as the
beds in the next apartment, and
they can hear every word that is
said—or whispered.
PROBLEMS GIVEN
Emergency problems of the cam
pus baby situation listed by the Le
gion are; wholly inadequate facili
ties for obstetrical care, shortages of
doctors, lack of hospital beds, lack
of nursery accommodations, and fi
nancial strain of the cost of babies
on G.I. budgets.
In the matter of doctors and hos
pitals Stanford seems rather well
off. The Village is definitely as
sured of a well-baby clinic through
the co-operation of Dr. George
Houek, director of the Health Serv
ice, and the San Mateo County
Health Department.
NURSERY NEEDED
Plans for a nursery have been
developed and one probably will be
established if the people want it,
Herbert J. Wunderlich, resident
counselor at the Village, said. There
is even a possibility that the per
son to head it will be the woman
who formerly had charge of Henry
Kaiser's company nursery.
Village mothers, though, don't
want a nursery as badly as they
do baby sitters. They love their
kids and want to take care of them.
But they do like to get out once in
a while.
CO-OPERATION A SOLUTION
Solution to the problem of the
campus baby situation, the Legion
says, is co-operation of college,
community, state and federal au
thorities. This the Farm seems to
have. Among the organizations that
have taken an interest in the mar
ried students are the Redwood City
Health Department, the Red Cross,
the City of Menlo Park, and Dr.
Hilgard's Psychology Department.
Because of the very high cost of
living peculiar to the Stanford-Palo
Alto area, married couples with
children do not fare much worse fi
nancially than single men. Expenses
of a single man, a recent survey
pointed out, are $145 a month, most
of which goes for room and board
and clothes maintenance.
