WASHINGTON, Feb. <> (UP).—
j The House today approved a Re
! publican - sponsored constitutional
■ amendment to restrict Presidents to
i Iwo four-year terms after shouting
| down a Democratic compromise for
i a .single six-year term.
| The newly elected GOP majority
won tlie backing of conservative
Democrats to pile up a vote of 285
to 121—more than the two-thirds
required to send the proposal to the
| Senate. Two-thirds of the members
! of that body also must support il
| before it can be submitted for rati
! fication by three-fourths of the
! states.
Republicans didn't cast a single
j vote against the proposal. The 238
I GOP members who voted for it
I were joined by 47 Democrats, most
' of them from Southern states.
