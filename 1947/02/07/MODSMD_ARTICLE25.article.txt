# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Dear Mewl: 
### 
From now on, the Shack is yours. Tear
down if you must the lace curtains and my
jjin-up boys; shed a lew tears for our passing
nickame —"The Peninsula's Only Hag-Ridden
Hag"; and post proofs on Quad that after al
most four straight years, the MEN are back.
I'm sure it's a good thing, having a man to
head the Daily at a time when three-guarters
ol the students are men. Yet I have never felt
that being a woman made any difference on
the Daily except when Smiley snorts about
"wimmin," or the sports staff consents to lend
in'.' .1 cigarette. In the Shack, men and women
i-oiiipete on egual terms for promotion; both
:;hare the same routine, the same fatigue, the
:...me pride in a job competently done.
All of us have part ownership in the Daily,
all of us have a certain pride in knowing our
< 111111m11i011 to the stark of papers that sits on

each comer of the Quad, five mornings a
week. Despite the fantastic headlines, egre
gious proof errors, and hashed-up stories that
have made several generations of Daily edi
tors gag over their morning coffee at the Cel
lar, we know that our paper is a good one.
That knowledge, all the reward Daily people
ever get, is what all of us have in common,
what keeps all of us working here.
So it's not a man's world at all at least at
the Daily. And even though you newly pow
erful men have handed me an eviction notice
which ends my term in the Shack at midnight
tonight, I know you'll not neglect the women
who are staying as members of your staff for
Volume 111. We "wirnmin" love the Dippy,
too.
To you. Newt, and to all the gang I'll never
forget, I just want to say, "thank you." Beth.
