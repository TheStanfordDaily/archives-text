When A 1 Hampson wrote his kiss-oil edit,
l.a k in 1943, lie quoted to the next editor
"From failing hands I throw the torch, be yours
to hold it high." I'm tossing you no torches,
Newt, just leaving a few sacred cows on*our
' :;k for you to enthrone or to smash.
I) A great deal of community spnit must
I. • taught, here at Stanford Books and classes
•lach us well how to speak French or recite
the Constitution, but the/ don't teach under
f-'anding, or a sense of responsibility to our
brother human beings, here at Stanford, or in
I ho world.
Fight to do your part in maintaining a good
::ystern ol communication between the stu
dents and the Administration. Urge Excom,
.:11rJ the student body, and the University high
er ups to do their part, too. Try to single out
vyh.it it is all of us are seeking, and plug hard
to keep everyone working on it, together.
!21) Keep after Fxcom so they'll make sense
in what they do, so they'll be sensitive to

student needs and will arrive somewhere
close to their objective a student legislature
which will be firmly respected by the stu
dents as well as the Administration. Support
them when you fairly can, Newt, for student
government needs a helping hand, now more
than ever.
3) A change in the required curriculum,
which would encourage liberalism in thought,
and
4) a persuasive program of international
events and information were the babies of
this volume, but I hope when the time comes,
you'll plug them both.
Whatever you do. Newt, don't forget that
the possibility of improvement is always in
front of you, always worth an extra argument,
an extra hour. Don't waste a moment of the
time that is yours for it doesn't last as long
as you think. In no time at all, you will be
sitting down to write such a farewell as this,
and you will be feeling just as inarticulate,
just as out-of-it as I do now. Good luck.
