# Dear Bannick:

Beth just stole all the funny things I planned
to s.iy about MEN back on the Daily, and what
a good thing it was to have male help and ex
perience around here once more. So all 1
have left to say on the subject is how LUCKY
you are to have an edit board ratio of five
men to two women.
Besides this is supposed to be a kiss-off
edit farewell, "30," and all that sort of stuff.
So here comes some sage advice on the ad
vantages of being managing editor.
First, you get higher pay, and you don't
know how handy that is; second, you get to
work a lot closer with the whole staff than
you do in most Daily positions; and third,
ihe assignment sheet gives you a real chance
to come out and express the inner YOU.
Seriously, though, it's a marvelous job and
one from which you can derive a great deal
of satisfaction, and a sense of real accomplish
ment. You'll be working with people—a lot
of different kinds of people; and you'll need
every ounce of understanding combined with
a fine sense of values and good judgment to

make the work you do count to the people
working with you on Volume 111.
That's a pretty big order to fill, Nantomick.
But judging from the consistently high stand
ard of performance, the loyalty, and the perse
verance you have shown since you've been
with us, I know you can fill that bill.
And because I can't resist the urge to
reminisce, let me ask you to remember the
long hours in the backshop, sweating out a
late paper together; the horrible botches we've
managed to let get in this rag; the "knitly
tight" group, "conscientious and sincere," we
had during the war; the wonderful feeling of
real fraternity you have for every other Daily
member; and all the other intangible things
that make working on the Daily what it is.
I haven't the room, nor the time, nor the
ability to say everything I want to say the way
I want to say it. You know pretty well what's
in my mind anyway. And you know, too,
that this isn't really "30," or farewell, or kiss
off; it's a very grateful "thanks."—Mellon.
