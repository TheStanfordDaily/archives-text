Tn (he Editor:
I should like to pro.sent to some and clarify to
others the stand which I took in originating the pe
tition presented to Excom last Wednesday evening.
I should also like to try to remove some of the taint
from the names of 15,'i co-signers who were pic
tured with me as "petty acting persons demonstrat
ing a complete lack of faith in Excom and a desire
l<> cripple student government."
On Jan. 28. Excom was asked by the Election
Hoard chairman to remove the restriction on the
time (one month) between nomination and election
of clwer leaders because he foresaw a legal snag.
Excom removed this restriction by amending the
Cy-laws. Our petition was to restrain the amend
ment and thereby guarantee the month time period.
The original intent of the provision in the By
laws requiring this interval was to necessarily af
ford the electorate an opportunity to intelligently
judge the relative merits of candidates. For what
ever reasons, convenience or otherwise, this intent
would be destroyed by a change removing such
limitation.
On Jan. 29. one of the signers of the petition
wrote a letter to the chairman of Excom pointing
out the invalidity of this action. Nothing was done,
in fact, no explanation of Excom's motives was made
to anyone. When a student governing body takes
unconstitutional action without even explaining its
motives' 1 feel it is time for those students who are
not in agreement with that body's policy to exer

cise the only legal voice left open to themâ€”petition!
We do not desire to cripple student government.
We do wish to cripple that portion that can and
does make changes in the By-laws of the Consti
tution for the sake of convenience without regard
for the primary intent of the By-laws . We do wish
to cripple those actions of student government which
are made and defended on the basis of "good in
tention" alone. We do wish to cripple that portion
of student government that acts contrary to the Con
stitution or with complete disregard for its provi
sions.
1 do not feel Excom has the right to expect the
students to back its actions on faith alone. They, for
their part, must show the students that they are
interested, capable and willing to accept student
opinion. If we, the 154, show an utter lack of faith
in Excom, then Excom shows an even more appalling
lack of faith in us by openly questioning the right
of petition by the very students from whom Excom
derives its power.
I did not represent the petition as a means "to
teach Excom a lesson." I stated I believed and still
believe that there is a lesson yet to be learned. That
lesson to be students will not show an active interest
in student government if they derive nothing but
dissatisfaction and discouragement from Excom's
actions, and students will not show interest in Excom
if they are fold that their interest is wanted only
when such interest backs up Excom's actions.
