## SLING TIME

Sonic Days Yoii (lan'l Make a Masted Cent!
lint Don't You (ianeel Any llets Just Yet
Some days you can't make a blasted cent. Take today, for instance.
Here the basketball squad is scheduled to meet the timid Trojans down
in Los Angeles tonight, and things were looking positively peachy, but what
happens? Dave Davidson doesn't recover from his illness quickly enough,
and to top it oft, Morley Thompson shows up with a bad sore throat about
train time.
The S.C. boys haven't done too well this season, and it looked like at
least a split—perhaps even a double win. Well, don't give up; 1 can safely
predict, I think, that the team will show for the games. They have a
lighting spirit, and I still think that Stanford will manage to garner at
least a split.
'1 hen, too, you never can tell about these sick boys. More than once
an athlete has risen from his deathbed to overshadow everyone else in
the game. I need only cite Capt. Max Wenskunas' performance in the
Rose Itowl game for Illinois; the medics had ail but made out his death
certificate, and he came up and mangled the Bruins.
So don't go canceling that wager you made down at Carlun's the
other eve; that ball takes funny angles when it comes down off the back
board. Who knews—.there may be a Stanford man right there waiting
lor il. This series is a battle to stay out of the cellar, you know.
Incidentally, Coach ['.levator Sam Barry of Troy was up here on a
scouting trip last week-end. Said Al Masters (in his Masters-I'ul way).
"Von must lie awfully hungry if you're scouting us, Sam."
The S.C. mastermind countered, "Well, when you've lost four games
in a row like 1 have you've got to do something to make 'em think you're
earning your pay." ,
How, Kow, How Your Shell; Oh, iVIv Hack!
Don't leave now, but crew is in the news again. One of the San
Francisco papers has come out with a long, sad story about our poor boys,
and how they're struggling along on nothing, because the big, bad
University won't kick through with some cash.
The facts are all true; what's wrong is the slant. Yes, the crew hasn't
much money; yes, the S.A.C. is unable to carry any additional load.
Contrary to what you might think, I'm sorry about it. The oarsmen
are ;t 11 nice fellows and Lou Lindscy, the student coach, is a great guy.
I.iudse.v came in to see me the other day, anxious to present his side of
I lie matter. I had heard the arguments before, but I must admit he
really sounded convincing. Since I have taken a definite stand, I
think it's only fair to give him a public hearing.
Lou Lindsey is a small young man, being one of Ky Ebright's former
coxswains; he's small, yes, but his brain definitely isn't. As Herod
Agrippa said 2,000 years ago, "Almost thou persuadest me. . . ." He is
.sincere, fair-minded—and a crew enthusiast.
lie pointed out that part of Cal's $.'15,000 crew budget—sls.ooo—
goes to pay the salaries of the two coaches. Another slice is set aside to
maintain a big hoathousc at Poughkeepsie, which they use but once a
year. More money is needed to keep up their two-story hoathousc on
the Alameda Estuary, which has a permanent caretaker.
\\ e AiiTl (»ol That Kind of Money
"Yes, but Stanford would have to spend that kind of money too,
in order to compete with Cal and Washington," I said. "Not even the
(jest ol student coaches —no olfense meant —can hope to compete with
Kbright of Cal or Ulbrickson of Washington on even terms."
"Quite right," says he, "But we don't expect to. Cal and Washington
are generally out of our class, but I think we'd have good luck against
itch as Oregon State and U.C.L.A., which have crew on the same basis
as the projected Stanford program."
"You could be perfectly sincere." I countered. "I believe you are—
hut you and your group of hoys won't he here forever. I'm positive
that il Stanford rows Cal and Washington each year and gets nothing
in return luil a series of defeats, there'll be a great deal of pressure on
the S.A.C. to spend more money so the crew can meet those schools
•in an even basis. Much of that pressure will come from the Alumni,
and you know how those wolves can howl."
"It's quite possible you're right," he answered. "In fact, I think you
are. But the S.A.C. has been under pressure before, and has managed
to bear up under it quite well. I realize Stanford is in no position to
spend that kind of money without any return. All we want is a little
help; even a very little help."
$3,000? Thai's a Shell of a Nol<-
He went on to relate that dues from the Crew Club—about $600
—pay for the upkeep on the small hoathousc down at the Yacht Harbor.
Some anonymous benefactor has promised the boys two new racing
shells as soon as they're available (which represents about $3,000 al
present prices). Lindsey has arranged to get two motor launches from
war surplus to aid him in his coaching duties; formerly he had to ride
as coxswain to get within earshot.
That leaves the problem of transportation; Lindsey admits I was
light when I said the railroads still demand coin of the realm in return
lor a ride. There is no hotel problem, he said: the crew will stay al
the opponent schools' fraternity houses.
Transportation would come to about $000 per year—and that's
where aid is needed, said Lindsey. The Crew Club has several fund
raising plans scheduled for the future, but that money should go for
improving facilities. The hoys want transportation money from the
S.A.C. Anything additional would be welcomed, but Lindsey figures
they could get along if Masters' minions would just take care of the
train fare.
1 hat sounds great. Such a setup would be ideal—except for the
pressure that's bound to develop after we've taken our lumps from the
Bears and Huskies a few times. After all. Stanford belongs to the Pacific
Coast Conference, and good performances are expected. I'm afraid
it would be like having a lion cub for a pet; after he grows up he's too
