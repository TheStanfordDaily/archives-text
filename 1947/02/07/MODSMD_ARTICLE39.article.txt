A smooth-operating El Toro team
took the measure of the Phi Delta
Theta hoopsters last night and
dropped them from the ranks of the
undefeated teams by a 24 to 21
count. Led by Rael and Hammett,
the Phi Delts played the eating
clubbers on better than even terms
during the second half, but were
unable to overcome a seven-point
intermission deficit.
League VII became strictly a
two-team race as the powerful
DU's (No. 1) won handily from a
game Encina Rocket team to run
their winning streak to three
straight. The 37 to 22 victory put
them into a first-place tie with the
Zete A s. in the League VII stand
ings.
In other games, Alpha Tail Ome
ga downed Toyon 27 to 12; Delta
Tau Delta put on a last period spurt
to defeat the DT's 29 to 21; and a
fast-breaking Phi Kappa Sigma out
fit completely outclassed Encina 2W
to win by the lopsided score of 32 to
11. Bob Lyons scored 10 points and
Stan Hodge collected 8 to lead the
winning Phi Kaps.
