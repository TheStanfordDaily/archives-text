# Jayvees At Menlo
## 
### 
While the varsity basketeers are
playing in Los Angeles this week
end, the farm jayvees will have the
local stage all to themselves as they
take on Menlo Junior College at the
latter's court tonight.
The two squads met a few weeks
ago, with the Menlo-ites stealing the
contest in the closing seconds, win
ning by a single point. The return
match should be quite a game since
Ihe Cardinals have improved con
siderably in recent appearances. A
number of changes have been made
in Jack Dana's starting five, Jack
Crahan having replaced Jim West,
who has dropped out of school, and
Gene Martin having taken over Fred
Lewis' guard spot. Fred has been
working out with the varsity ol
late.
From here in Dana will be point
ing his boys for their rematches with
the seemingly unstoppable Califor
nia Blues. The Blues compiled an
impressive victory skein of twenty
games before dropping a decision to
the UCLA Jayvees, 44-42. Martin
and Crahan have been netting about
everything they throw at the hoop,
and, if Christiansen can stop the
flashy Ray Lucas, the Stanford
quintet may break the back of the
Cal offense.
