# Weakened Indian Capers Meet Determined Trojan Underdogs
## 
### 
Old Mr. Virus dealt the Li 1 Injun's basketball hpes a second low
blow yesterday as Morley Thompson reported at train time with a sore >
throat. Morley thus joins Dave Davidson on the ailing list, and with
both ol these starters in a questionable condition, the Cardinal chances
have taken a dip downward.
I-vca with Morlc> and Dave starting the two contests against U.S.C..

the chances are exceedingly re
mote that either of these two will
be altle to carry on through 40
minutes of play. The major part
of the burden will therefore fall
on the shoulders of the reserves.
Substitutes Milt Iverson and Bill
Drehohle will be the boys who will
be called upon to replace Morley
and Dave. If they can hold their
own against the Trojan varsity
the Cards' chances will be bright;
it they fail, the Stanford quintet
will lie lucky to escape Los Ange
les with a single skein.
The Southern California five
which will be playing host to the
Indians tonight and tomorrow eve
ning has been the biggest disap
pointment on the coast. Loaded
with experience and talent, the
Trojans were expected to hold
well against conference competi
tion, and perhaps even cop the con
ference crown. After four succes
sive defeats at the hands of Cal
and U.C.L.A. that hope has dwin
dled away, but the team still re
tains its potential strength.
U.S.C.â€”BALANCED SQUAD
With Gene Rock, Alex Hannum,
Tex Winters, Dick Shanley, and
Shanty Shanon holding down the
starting five spots, the Trojans
boast of a well-balanced aggre
gation. The major weakness of
the U.S.C. quintet has been the
extreme lack of height on the
squad. The team average is
slightly below the six-foot mark,
and as a result of this, the boys
from Troy frequently lose con
trol of the backboards and have
to fight to retain possession of the
ball.
The Trojan offense is based
around the only tall man on the
squad, Alex Hannum, who tops the
mark at 6 feet (J. Working the ball
in and out of the keyhole, the Ma

roon and Gold work into set offen
sive plays and rely on their marks
manship rather than any fast break.
STATISTICS DO LIE
U.S.C. is a much better team
than their record might indicate.
Four defeats against nary a win
is a record difficult to excuse
away, but the two contests drop
ped to Cal were very close, and
the first * one was not decided
until one minute before the final
gun. The twin losses to U.C.L.A.
by wide margins were the result
of one team being up for the
games and the other barely able
to stand erect without tripping
over their own shoelaces.
A double victory for the Stan
ford varsity will send them right
! into the league fight for the top
spot. A split and the hopes will be
: kept alive, while two defeats will
| end all speculation on the subject
of conference leadership.
