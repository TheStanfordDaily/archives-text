# Bomb Tests Accompanied By Prayer
## 
### CHAPLAIN HALL 
"Mark 12: .'lO and 111—Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all
thy heart, and with all thy soul,
and with all thy strength. The
second is this. Thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself."
This was written July 1 at about
J0:45, the morning after the first
atomic bomb was dropped on Bikini
Atoll.
'ATOMIC PRAYER'
A sailor stuck an envelope in my
hand yesterday, turned and walked
away. On the envelope were the
words "To the Chaplain." In it was
a prayer written by a man whose
name I don't know. He called it "An
Atomic Prayer." What he said any
man on the ship might have said.
He commended those he loved to
God's care; he asked God's blessing
on this tremendous experiment that
it might put an end to war.
zLast night a shipload of men
gathered to watch a movie. Around
them on every side were other ships
with other men doing the same
thing. All was ready for the great
est experiment in the history of
man.
WORDS CAN'T DESCRIBE
The Atom Bomb has been dropped
now and our pulses still tremble,
our ears still vibrate, our eyes still
stare at the awesome hing we have
witnessed. No words can describe
(he scene—to attempt to do so would
be foolish.
Ringing above the din of nature's
unleashed force, written in the fire
of the sun itself I seem to see the
words —"Thou shalt love the Lord
thy God with all thy heart and with
all thy mind and with all thy
strength—and thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself."


"THERE'LL BE NO SMOKING ON QUAI). Little Lcland never did
it; if he did it, then he hid it. . . . There'll be 110 smoking on the Quad
. ... by gawd."
