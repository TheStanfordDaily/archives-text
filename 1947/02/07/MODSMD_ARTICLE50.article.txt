### PAULA NUSSER 
"Hickory shirts and overripe
cords are giving way to sweaters
and knickers. Beer busts are being
supplanted by parties in palm
fronded hotels. What has become of
the Stanford tradition?"
These were the questions asked
in the Stanford Illustrated Review
for July 1926, questions that with
a little rephrasing could be repeat
ed in 1947.
How are your traditions lately?
Do you whiz by in your seven-pas
senger sedan forgetting the little
Indian maids standing sadly on
Wilson's corner? Do you proudly
display your Hi-Y pin or play pool
on Sunday? Well, don't look now
but your traditions are showing.
DOUSE THAT CIGARETTE
The most noted but overlooked
custom is that of no smoking on
Quad. Way back in 1891, the Farm
passed a resolution that cigarette
butts would never darken the fair
corners of the Quad or the arched
walks.
To save student pocketbooks and
time and to legalize "pickups,"
Stanford initiated the tradition of
rides to Paly, which today has been
extended to the Village. Rendez
vous for would-be riders are the
Big Oak Tree, the campus and of
Palm Drive, and Wilson's corner.
Of prime interest to the women
are the traditions of how to become

a Stanford woman and what com
pensation is due them for lockouts.
Roughs may have their own ideas
about Stanford women, but tradi
tion has it that no girl is a Stanford
woman until she has been kissed
on the Quad at midnight by a
Stanford senior.
Though a Stanford man is re
quired to provide either flowers or
! candy for the woman he brought
home at 1:31 a.m., the taboo on cor
j sages except for the Senior Ball
! does help save his $65 a month.
Corsages went out when the de
-1 pression came in.
The tradition that women are not
allowed on the law steps was drop
ped during the war when the Law
School was moved to Inner Quad.
PUT DOWN THAT CUE, TOO
j Of particular interest to the keep
j ers of the Zete game room is that
traditionally no one plays billiards
| or pool on Sunday, dating from a
request by Mrs. Stanford.
And take back your Hi-Y pin,
Joe. Susie can't wear it on her pa
jamas. Tradition states that high
! school or junior college pins, sweat
ers, or other insignia are never
| worn.
Will traditions return to their old
j place now that the excuse of war
; has passed? The making or break
ing of standing traditions remains
for the students themselves to de
j cide.

"Hickory shirts and overripe
cords are giving way to sweaters
and knickers. Beer busts are being
supplanted by parties in palm
fronded hotels. What has become of
the Stanford tradition?"
These were the questions asked
in the Stanford Illustrated Review
for July 1926, questions that with
a little rephrasing could be repeat
ed in 1947.
How are your traditions lately?
Do you whiz by in your seven-pas
senger sedan forgetting the little
Indian maids standing sadly on
Wilson's corner? Do you proudly
display your Hi-Y pin or play pool
on Sunday? Well, don't look now
but your traditions are showing.
DOUSE THAT CIGARETTE
The most noted but overlooked
custom is that of no smoking on
Quad. Way back in 1891, the Farm
passed a resolution that cigarette
butts would never darken the fair
corners of the Quad or the arched
walks.
To save student pocketbooks and
time and to legalize "pickups,"
Stanford initiated the tradition of
rides to Paly, which today has been
extended to the Village. Rendez
vous for would-be riders are the
Big Oak Tree, the campus and of
Palm Drive, and Wilson's corner.
Of prime interest to the women
are the traditions of how to become

a Stanford woman and what com
pensation is due them for lockouts.
Roughs may have their own ideas
about Stanford women, but tradi
tion has it that no girl is a Stanford
woman until she has been kissed
on the Quad at midnight by a
Stanford senior.
Though a Stanford man is re
quired to provide either flowers or
! candy for the woman he brought
home at 1:31 a.m., the taboo on cor
j sages except for the Senior Ball
! does help save his $65 a month.
Corsages went out when the de
-1 pression came in.
The tradition that women are not
allowed on the law steps was drop
ped during the war when the Law
School was moved to Inner Quad.
PUT DOWN THAT CUE, TOO
j Of particular interest to the keep
j ers of the Zete game room is that
traditionally no one plays billiards
| or pool on Sunday, dating from a
request by Mrs. Stanford.
And take back your Hi-Y pin,
Joe. Susie can't wear it on her pa
jamas. Tradition states that high
! school or junior college pins, sweat
ers, or other insignia are never
| worn.
