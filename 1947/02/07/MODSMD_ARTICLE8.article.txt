# Disarmament Pushed Despite Disagreements
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Feb. G (UP).—The
United States and Soviet Russia ex
changed more concessions today in
the privacy of a United Nations
conference room, but still failed to
agree on the way to begin world
disarmament negotiations.
A three-hour morning session and
an afternoon meeting which was
still going at 5 p.m. produced im
portant compromises by both War
ren Austin of the U.S. and Andrei
Gromyko of Russia.
Austin insisted that the six-mem
ber group, a sub-committee of the
Security Council, agreed that the
proposed disarmament commission
must be ordered to keep its hands
off the territory of the U.N. Atomic
Energy Commission.
Gromyko argued that this guar
antee already existed and therefore
should be written into the resolu
tion now being prepared by the
sob-committee.
Once the two big power repre
sentatives found a way to agree on
this point, the sub-committee was
ready to recommend that the Se
curity Council pass a resolution
calling for:
1. Immediate formation of an 11-
nation disarmament commission to
arms other than atomic bombs and
weapons of "mass destruction,"
2. Prompt resumption of negotia
tions in both the Security Council
and U.N. Atomic Energy Commis
sion on atomic control problems.
3. A speed-up in the formation of
, U.N. police force.
