ern in» officials of the CIO Commit
tee for Maritime Unity today took
the first step toward disbanding the
committee by recommending that
member unions approve its disso
lution.
Endorsement of the executive
committee's action was virtually
certain among the unions.

dered the CMU ineffective for all
practical purposes."

longshoreman leader and the oth
er co - chairman of CMU, was
among the executive committee
members who signed the recom
mendation on which the union
members will act.
