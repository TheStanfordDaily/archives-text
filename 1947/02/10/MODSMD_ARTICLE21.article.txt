## Discussion Club Stormed Saturday 
### 
Students interested in the forma
tion of a current affairs discussion
group on the campus met last Sat
urday at the Women's Clubhouse.
The objectives and ihc organization
of the group were discussed.
The objectives of the group
were defined as the creation of
interest and understanding of na
tional and international events
among Stanford students. The
group felt that there arc already
many students interested in world
affairs and it is for the group to
channel this interest properly and
to give a solid background to this
interest.
The group will organize small dis
cussion groups in different living
units. By this means they intend to
reach all interested students study
ing at Stanford. The discussions will
be organized on a weekly basis and
will help in interchange of ideas
between students.
Every meeting will he attended
by student discussion leaders who
will help the group by presenting
the pertinent facts and figures.
The living groups will be encour
aged to form their own sub-dis
cussion groups.
The final organization of the

group lias not been decided upon as
yet. The club will meet again in (he
"Y" room of the Women's Club
house today at 8 p.m.
All students interested in working
in the group are invited. Special in
vitation is extended to students who

houses.
