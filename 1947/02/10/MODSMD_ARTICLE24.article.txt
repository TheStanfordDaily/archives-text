# Fuel Shortage Forces Power Cut in England
## 
### 
LONDON, (Monday) Keb. 10 (UP). —All electric power was cut oif in thousands of England's
factories at 12:01 a.m. today (7:01 p.m. EST Sunday) by government order in a drastic emergency
measure to save fuel.
At 9 a.m. on this black Monday a 100-percent power cut will extend, for five hours a day moru
ing and afternoon, to millions of homes, stores, restaurants, business establishments, panics -even

to doctors' and dentists' offices.
The fuel rut will be in effort for
a week at least—maybe longer.
Upwards of 2,000,000 workei -
were thrown out of their jobs in the
first pliHse of the cut. Up to 3,000,
000 more may be affected.
It was the greatest crisis, political
as well as industrial, in the Ifl
months of the Labor government
and its repercussions may be last in?:
For nearly 25,000,000 people in the
areas affected — southeastern, mid
dle and northwestern England in
eluding London and other great ci
ties, constituting the industrial heart
of the country—it. was another grim
test of endurance nearly two year:,
after supposed victory in the war.
HEAVY SNOWFALL
Hardship was intensified by the
heaviest, snowfall of a bitter wintm.
It started early yesterday, and be
fore it ended 10 more inches of snow
lay on the frozen earth in some
areas.
Even in London, where normally
snow removal operations are prompt
and thorough, housewives ploughed
through drifts to queue up for hour:
to buy food, candles and coal oil
against black Monday.
Dislocated transport, which was
taking coal to the most vital cen
ters, added to the gravity of the
situation.
Only to those children who 112
schools were closed by the power
cut was the crisis anything but «
source of added misery, and even
some of them had found in their
classrooms a refuge from the cold
which crept into their ill-heated
homes.
FACTORIES HIT HARD
The cut for factories is 21 hours
a day. Other clcetric power users,
including most of the schools, will
he affected from 9 a.m. to noon
and from 2 p.m. to 1 p.m. each day.
About 25 absolutely essential set
vices, ranging from bakers and
newspapers to waterworks, will be
exempt.
Prime Minister Clement R. Attler
conferred with his leading cabinet
ministers yesterday on the crisis.
Today they will face an angry
Parliament, with Winston Chur
chill and his conservatives con
sidering the introduction of a
blistering vote of censure against
the government on the ground
that it is going ahead with ambi
tious nationalization projects while
the country is lighting for its eco
nomic life.
But whatever may be .said, Ihf
fuel ministry announced, the powei
cut cannot be called <>ff until a full
week's supply of coal has been built
up for power stations, many <>112
which had been operating on a d.-i.y
to day basis.
