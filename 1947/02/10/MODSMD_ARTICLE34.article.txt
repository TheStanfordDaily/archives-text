# DAILY EDITORIALS
## Now Thai Policy: 
### 
We have been deluged with questions
about, just what our policy will be during Vol
ume 111. Most of the questions are asked with
good intentions, but reveal that we have been
«■) little remiss in explaining just what we feel
the purpose of the Daily is, and how "policy"
decided.
First, our opinions on just what the paper
fthould be:
I. l J rirnarily, it should be an accurate source
(jf r/.iily information and events, well present
ed, lor a community of 7,000 persons.
We will fall short of this goal many times,
without a doubt, because our staff is in a con
joint process of training, and is not made up
of professional persons working for a living,
Lul rather voluntary labor woiking on a co
operative basis.
The shortage of newsprint, estimated to last
112 >ur to five more years, aggravates the prob
lem of good, complete coverage. A tempo
rary windfall, however, will allow us to pre
.viil a six-page paper once a week.
When groups feel that we are not giving
proper service and support to activities, a
hort visit or phone call to our offices will got
i,u better results than a letter to Excom, which
possesses no direct control over what we
print
2 Secondarily, ct .student papei must re
flect the opinions of the student body, either

through accurate reporting, or composite edi
toriiila.
3. Finally, a paper has a responsibility to
its readers to try to be a civic leader by mak
ing suggestions through its editorial column.
Now, an explanation as to how "policy" is
decided:
The idea that a newspaper must have a
basic sot of beliefs, other than a high standard
for news presentation, strikes us as just a
little silly. The mere existence alone of the
Daily as the only newspaper on campus auto
matically sets for us the task of trying to pre
sent our news impartially, and editorially to
stand for what "we" think to be the best inter
ests of the majority of persons connected with
Stanford.
Now. this ambiguous "we" refers, in this
case, to the Editor, the Managing Editor, the
two Associate Editors, the Staff Editor, and the
Art Editor and Sports Editor. The latter two
are ex-officio members of Edit Board.
It is this group which decides just what we
shall say regarding editorials on current cam
pus issues. The Edit Board is probably more
representative of the entire Stanford student
body than any other similar body on campus,
and is at every turn influenced by members
of the staff.
We welcome criticisms, and we hope to see
students dropping in at the shack to express
their ideas
