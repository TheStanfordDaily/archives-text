### CECIL ROSPAW 
Mr. (General) George Catlett Marshall, our new
Secretary of Slate, is one of the finer men of our
eneration. The job fie did in the armed forces of
levamping an antiquated fighting force into a global
imil is one of the big military achievements of all
I lines.
The Chinese situation, viewed from American
.standards, is an impossible one, and the job he did
there was good, considering what he had to work
wilb.
Hul Mr. Marshall is a military man. His thoughts
an directed from the military point of view. And to
tit peoples of the world he will always be identified
a< (lie leader of America's fighting forces. Soldiers
indicate force, and force indicates no compromise.
This is undoubtedly an unfair surmise in Marshall's
> a: e, bul it is still one that will be prevalent through
out the world.
For instance, what if England should replace
iVvin with Field Marshal Montgomery; Russia, Mo
lotov with Zhukov? The Big Three, when it meets
again, could then be able to talk on even terms. This
i again unfair, but think bow we would feel if Russia
bad made the first move, and if it were Zhukov we
were considering as the new Commissar of Russian
I' ili eien Affairs.

We imagine that an incident such as this would
bring the papers of the United Stales close to a light
ing pitch in editorial vehemence.
The peace conference might g<s something like
this: Zhukov, "We have the biggest and most dy
namic standing army in the whole world, plus the
Katushka.Â» Marshall, "We have the Atom Bomb."
Montgomery, "Well, there will always be an Eng
land."
This is the only objection to Marshall as Secre
tary of State, but in this present confused and be
wildered world it seems a big one. The appointment
is mad", and all we can hope for is co-operation from
all concerned and the best job possible from a man
who has one big strike against him when he sits
down with the civilians from other countries to
finish the peace.
One more thought on the subject. As a military
man Marshall has had a few brief excursions into
civilian life. Why not offer him the consultation
of a man who has had an excursion into military life?
Many veterans' outfits have offered the suggestion
that a representative of the groups be appointed to
tho United States U.N. group. Not with vote or veto,
but only as a living reminder of what made the con
ference possible.
Could a movement such as this start on a college
campus? On the Stanford campus?
