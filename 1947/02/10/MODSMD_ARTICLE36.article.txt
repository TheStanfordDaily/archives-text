To the Editor:
As one of the signers of the petition presented
In excom last week by Tom Elk?, I write in defense
of Elke and the 153 others of vis who signed the
petition to restrain Exeom from holding an illegal
election. Although your paper denounces Elke for
"a desire to cripple student government," I think
rather that it. is appropriate to congratulate Tom as
a non-apathetic participant in student government
who has exercised his rights. Your editorial remarks
art- definitely uncalled for, especially with regard
to the motives of the signers and originator of the
petition for the actions in doing so.
I called Martin Anderson's attention to the ille
gality of the yell leader election in a letter I wrote
him last week. In that letter I also protested the
attempt to place the electioneering issue on the
ballot as a public opinion survey. I was particularly
interested in the matter of Excoin and elections since
it required three months for Excom to decide just
who had been elected to Men's Council last quartet
for what terms. My successor was elected before
il was decided I had been elected to a short term.
I emphasize that Anderson, at least, was aware of
ihe illegality of yesterday's election before it was
held. An alert Election Board even considered
. everal steps to legalize the vote. However, when
no action was forthcoming, Elke look action accord
ing a constitutional provisions a-)d submitted a pe
»i I ion to set aside the election. No man can be cen
sured for acting in a constitutionally prescribed
manner to endeavor to protect his rights. If he felt
Excom was acting illegally and could find 15:>
students who agreed with him, he should not be
attacked for "trying to cripple student government."
It is men acting constitutionally to protect their
rights and to express their views that strengthn
student government and make it work correctly.
Those of us who signed the petition did so for
a number of reasons: many, Elke included, fell Ex
com has too often been acting haphazardly and
should be severely censured; others, more vocifer
ous during football season, felt Rally Com should be
chastised, even abolished, for failure to get yell leader
candidates nominated at the proper time; others
imply wanted more time in which to watch poten
tial yell leaders and demanded the month's tryout
period; others demanded a plain and simple return
to constitutional government. None of these objec
tive's were achieved; Rally Com got a clean bill of

health, the yell leaders were officially selected, Ex
com approved the election. Actually, however, we
hope that our petition may serve to arouse Excom
and prompt them to be more careful in its future
actions. We definitely did not attempt to cripple
government; we are interested in government to
the extent that we want it to function properly and
legally.
Student government cannot function properly if
such bitter and illogical criticism as was piled on
Elke is heaped on every student who attempts to
exercise his rights. Criticism rightly directed is a
good thing; here it should be directed to those who
have made the mistakes. Elke has taken a power
ful stand in defense of legal student government;
look at both sides, of this question—there are two—
and Stanford will be indebted to him.

To the Editor:
A condition exists on the campus which I believe
should be brought to the attention of the students.
It concerns the hitch-hiking situation on Palm Drive.
Every day after 11 o'clock classes there is a
large group of students waiting for rides to Paly and
the Village. They all wait at one spot, and create a
dangerous confusion. The ones desiring to go to the
Village hail a car, which stops, and they run out into
the street to find out where it is going. If it is going
to Palo Alto, they run back and wait for the next
car. In the meantime, other cars must dodge both the
car which is stopped and the hitch-hikers. And
everyone concerned becomes irritated at the con
fusion. The same thing happens when Palo Alto
bound students hail a car.
There is great danger of serious accidents there,
and while none have occurred so far, it seems to be
only due to luck and the nimbleness of the hitch
hikers.
I propose that two signs be placed at different
places, one saying Palo Alto and the other. Village,
so that both the riders and the drivers can know
beforehand whether they are both going in the same
direction. I would leave it up to the police as to
the best locations for these signs. This should help
to diminish the confusion and danger of accidents,
and be a benefit to all parties. I have mentioned the
subject previously to the campus police, but notice
that no action has been taken.
