# 'Will You Vote for Christianity?' Asks Rev. Kennedy in Challenging Sermon
## 
### 
lla.s Christianity your vote? This
challenging question was the topic ;
<>! yesterday morning's sermon, de
livered by the Rev. Dr. Gerald Ken
nedy, guest chaplain, at the Memo
rial Church service.
Dr. Kennedy's sermon was fol
lowed by a special Holy Commun- |
ion service at 12 noon, climaxing [
Stanford's Spiritual Emphasis Week.
Dr. Kennedy asked Stanford I
church-goers just how many times, j
h'.'fore starting a new field of aetiv- ;
ity or line of thinking, they have j
asked themselves: "Is this the Chris
tian thing to do?"
He pointed out that people are
quick to condemn others as non
conformists to Christian ideals, but !
iail to see themselves as offenders. I
In applying the Golden Rule, people !
want the other fellow to "do unto
them."
Christianity can become a part of j
everyday living only through direct
and personal action ,by each indi
vidual, he said.
Christ was a man of action. When
he first saw the fishermen of Gali- '
lee, who were later to become his !

disciples, he said, "Put down your
nets and follow me." Christ did not
ask for deliberation, theory, or phi
losophy, Dr. Kennedy said.
This is an age of stilted conven
tions, Dr. Kennedy emphasized.
Criteria to happiness are based on
material blessings â€” a well-padded
bank account, a new car, an expen

sive home. The Christian approach
to happiness is through the so-called
"little things" based on kindness,
love, charity, hope, and faith.
To be a Christian requires sacri
fices of complacent, everyday luxu
ries, Dr. Kennedy warned, but no
truer happiness can be found lhan
practicing God's love.
