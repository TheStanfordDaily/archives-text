# Tired Card Cagers Split Pair Down South
## Late S.C Rally Spoils Possible Indian Sweep 
### ART LEVINSON 
LOS ANGELES.â€”Continuing to disregard the word of the
gods, Stanford's basketball squad dumped Southern Cal in the
Friday encounter at Los Angeles, and were eked out by a narrow
margin in the Saturday return match to split a two-game confer-

ence series.
The Friday tally read 55 to 50,
with the Indians on the top of the
totem pole. Dean's men started out
last, jumping to a 9-3 lead in the
first seven minutes of the tilt. Then
Alex H.inum, the much-heralded
Trojan center, started the Trojan
scoring parade, and sunk a succes
sion of points to give the U.S.C. five
a 32-2(> halftime lead.
But if the Trojans had thoughts
of winning their first conference
tilt on Friday p.m., they were soon
disillusioned, for with 12 minutes
lift in the encounter, Stanford tied
up the ball .game at 40 points per
team.
I ll< .GINS GETS HOT
At this point, Babe Higgins de
cided that all this nonsense of Stan
ford trailing U.S.C. must come to a
stop, for he scored two quick field
goals, and one free throw to allow
his playmates to take a lead which
they didn't lose.
11 ins, in general, made him
self most useful to the Indian
cause, as he tallied 15 points, eight
via the field-goal route and seven
in the "sucker shot" department.
Alex Hannum and Gene Rock,
center and forward respectively,
stored II points apiece as their
contribution to the failing side.
HUT ON SATURDAY ....
Saturday's encounter saw the op
ening win for Sam Barry's quintet
in the southern division conference
race, as Stanford dropped the fra
cas, 52 to 48.
Alex Hannum, the elongated in
dividual, again lead the Trojan
cause, scoring 24 of the 52 points.
The second game should be referred
to as "nip and tuck" as the Cards
were never more than three or four
points behind the winning team. The
hall time score was 25 to 23. Stan
lord on the low end.
Once again it was Babe Higgins
who played the vital role in the
Cardinal attack, leading the Farm
sters with 17 points, for a two
evening total of 32 points.
I.ASI - INI IN UTE BUCKET
Trojan guard Fred Bertram hit
the basket from 25 feet out for a
field goal that netted S.C. two
points just as the gun banged.
Cal, which went through a miser
able three - game non - conference
losing streak this week-end, still
leads the conference race with five
wins and one loss. UCLA is second
with four wins and two losses. Next
is Stanford with two and four. USC
dwells in the cellar with one win
and five losses.
