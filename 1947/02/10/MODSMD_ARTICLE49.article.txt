NEW YORK. Feb. 9 (UP).-Hank
Green berg, whose 44 home runs last
season led the major leagues, said
today he may quit playing baseball
because he doesn't want to ''start
anew in a new environment."
Greenberg recently was sold from
Detroit to Pittsburgh for a reported
$50,000, and Pirate President Frank
McKinney said the deal would stand
no matter what the player does.
