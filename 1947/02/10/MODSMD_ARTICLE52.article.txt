# Crucial Mural Clash Tonight
## 
### 
Intramural Basketball attention
will be directed toward the torrid
League V race tonight as the two
undefeated league leaders, the
Townies and the Firehouse, meet
with "winner take all."
The important contest is sched
uled for 8:00 in Encina Gymnasium,
with the loser destined to fall from
the charmed circle, which has been
becoming more and more select
lately. Three teams felt defeat for
the initial time last week; this week
the mortality rate should be tre
mendous.
Four powerful hoop teams mus
cled their way into the 3-0 ranks
during last week's games, and as a
result must he acknowledged as
possible league champions. The
Fiji's, AKL, the Shysters, and the
first I).U. quintet added their third
win without a defeat.
By far the most amazing record
hung up in Mural Basketball for
some time is that of the D.U.'s. The
Tong men have two teams entered
in the all-campus competition, and
thus far neither team has lost a
game.
In League VII, the pure 3-0 record
of the first D.U. team ranks them as
co-league leaders with the Zetes
(A). But the second D.U. team,
which matriculates in League VIII,
must be content with second place
despite its 2-0 record. The AKL's
have the top slot sewed up with
three wins without a defeat.
