# Pierre Monteux Directs Farm Symphony Concert
## S.F. Orchestra Thrills Audience 
### TED HOFFMAN 
Pierre Monteux and the San
Francisco Symphony again con
vinced Stanford concert-goers that
it is not necessary to leave the Bay
Area to hear the finest kind of mu
sical interpretation and rendition.
Friday night's concert at the Menio
-1 ial Auditorium proved that the San
Francisco orchestra ranks among the
four or five top musical organiza
tions in the country.
Monteux began the concert with
the "Flying Dutchman" overture,
the colorful music that sets the
mood for Wagner's exciting, though
seldom performed, opera. More mu
sic from the same composer fol
lowed â€”but it was Wagnerian music
in an entirely different vein: the

ethereal prelude to "Lohengrin."
This is one of the unique works in
concert repertoire, for not once can I
the listener feel the slightest sense !
of rhythm throughout the entire j
piece.
These first two selections were j
faultlessly conducted by Monteux. !
In the latter portion of the Wagner j
group, however, Monteux failed to [
live up to his usual brilliant stand- j
ords.
The music from "Tristan and
Isolde" was performed with exces
sive emotion. Dynamic contrasts j
were too apparent. "Isolde's Love j
Death." which contains one of the
most beautiful themes in music lit- ;
erature. was very moving, but ;
seemed sentimental in spots.
The "Magic Fire" music was sur- j
prisingly unexciting. Those who an- i
ticipated the tumultuous effect usu
nlly associated with this work wait- j
ed in vain.
Cesar Franck's "Symphony in D j
Minor" followed the intermission. It j
was in the rendition of this work !
that the interpretive genius which i
places Monteux above almost all j
other conductors was most appar- j
ent.
Although the D Minor Symphony j
has been much criticized for its ex
cessive modulations and other struc
tural defects, its unity and the per
fection of its themes combine with |
the strong philosophy of its com- I
poser to produce a work that ranks
with the greatest symphonies. The!
immaculate playing of the musi- |
Hans and the peerless interpretation
of Monteux gave this great French
work a performance that we seri
ously doubt has ever been surpassed,
if equaled.
All the poignant emotion, the I
melodic beauty, the profound seri- |
ousness, and the fine orchestration |
of Franck was brilliantly brought '
out by Monteux. It was one of those j
rare performances where absolute j
artistic perfection is evidenced. To ;
qviote Stephen Leacock: "One stands j
nppalled at the majesty of such an j
achievement."
