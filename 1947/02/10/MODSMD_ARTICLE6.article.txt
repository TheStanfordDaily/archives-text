## 
### 
BERLIN, Feb. 9 (UP). —Fire
| flashed through a German night
club in the British sector of Berlin
last night and 800 Tommies, frau
leins, and German couples who were
gaily dancing at a fancy dress ball
stampeded in panic for the exits.
Bodies piled up like cordwood at
the doors and the fire engulfed
them.
Tonight. Paul Markgraft, po
lice president of Berlin, said that
81 bodies, including eight British
had been recovered. He
said there were more bodies in
the wreckage and embers, but the
weather was near zero and he did
not expect more to- be dug out
tonight. The German news agen
cy DPI) said the death toll "will
perhaps reach 100."
Hospitals reported that more
| than 100 others, including five Brit
ish soldiers, were burned or other
wise injured. A British army den
| tist at the scene checked the dental
work of the victims. As soon as he
| identified a soldier's body, waiting
| British medics carried it away.
Women were trampled underfoot,
] survivors said, and the crush at the
I exits killed more than the fire it
self. Bodies were horribly burned,
however, because after they had
piled up they remained in the fire
until it burned out.
The fire started in the ceiling,
seemingly from a stovepipe that had
become red hot. It whooshed out
across the ceiling—almost as though
it. had been doused with benzine.
