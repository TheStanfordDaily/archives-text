### 
Three representatives from Stan- i
ford's athletic, student government |
and administrative departments I
.spoke last night on KSU — Lloyd j
Merriman. Frank Creede, and John j
Stalnaker.
Frank Creed", i'ormer president of
Toyon Club and member of Excom,
was interviewed on matters of stu
dent interest by a KSU stall mem
ber. Creede staled that he docs be
lieve thai the Honor Code is work
ing at Stanford and supported this
statement by quoting a poll which
had just been taken at Toyon, in
dicating that few students have seen
cheating in classrooms.
Creede emphasized the "third- J
person responsibility" as a very im
portant but neglected part of the
Honor Code.
He stated that apathy in student j
elections is a very pressing prob
lem and that he believes the best
way to overcome it is to give the
Election Board more funds so they
can get adequate information to the
voters.
Creede said he did not think
standards should be lowered for j
athletes, but that their ability should j
be given some special considcra- j
tion.
He concluded by saying that he |
thought the administration should
give more attention to student opin

ion and that, although Excom can
only make recommendations, these
should be considered by the ad
ministration.
Dean John Stalnakcr. interviewed

| lyst, staled ho believed there wasn't
| nearly as big a problem between
| students and administration us bad
boon pictured, but the best way for
students to make their problems
known is through their representa
tive government.
Stalnakcr agreed with C'reedo
nljoiit athletes in that standards
should not be lowered for them, but
stated he had little to do with the
j admission of students.
The dean of students said he
! thought the Daily is doing as good
I a job as can be done in presenting
! the news, and that should
j support the paper.
He said he favors and will do ev
erything possible to promote a
; strong student government.
Lloyd Mori iman and fin El Ca
j mino Real fortune-teller provided
! the feature element of the I'rosid
j cast.
Madame Rose, purveyor of pro
phecies, predicted that the Stanford
grid star, "Mr. Football'' himself,
| would be caught in the nuptial net
j within the next year.
The fortune-teller stole a march
on sports writers and newscasters
with a little pigskin prognosticat
ing for 1947. A successful season is
in store for all-coast Mcrriman and
his mates, she predicted.

Three representatives from Stan- i
ford's athletic, student government |
and administrative departments I
.spoke last night on KSU — Lloyd j
Merriman. Frank Creede, and John j
Stalnaker.
Frank Creed", i'ormer president of
Toyon Club and member of Excom,
was interviewed on matters of stu
dent interest by a KSU stall mem
ber. Creede staled that he docs be
lieve thai the Honor Code is work
ing at Stanford and supported this
statement by quoting a poll which
had just been taken at Toyon, in
dicating that few students have seen
cheating in classrooms.
Creede emphasized the "third- J
person responsibility" as a very im
portant but neglected part of the
Honor Code.
He stated that apathy in student j
elections is a very pressing prob
lem and that he believes the best
way to overcome it is to give the
Election Board more funds so they
can get adequate information to the
voters.
Creede said he did not think
standards should be lowered for j
athletes, but that their ability should j
be given some special considcra- j
tion.
He concluded by saying that he |
thought the administration should
give more attention to student opin

ion and that, although Excom can
only make recommendations, these
should be considered by the ad
ministration.
Dean John Stalnakcr. interviewed
by Dow Carpenter, KSU news ana-

| lyst, staled ho believed there wasn't
| nearly as big a problem between
| students and administration us bad
boon pictured, but the best way for
students to make their problems
known is through their representa
tive government.
Stalnakcr agreed with C'reedo
nljoiit athletes in that standards
should not be lowered for them, but
stated he had little to do with the
j admission of students.
The dean of students said he
! thought the Daily is doing as good
I a job as can be done in presenting
! the news, and that should
j support the paper.
He said he favors and will do ev
erything possible to promote a
; strong student government.
Lloyd Mori iman and fin El Ca
