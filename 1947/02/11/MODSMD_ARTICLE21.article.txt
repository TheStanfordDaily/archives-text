### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Fob. 10 (UP).
Atheist Robert. 11. Scott said today
Hint, lie would petition lite
Federal Communications Commis
sion to revoke the license of Radio
Station K.QW after he had been de
nied time for additional broadcasts
on atheism.
Fred Rugge, station program di
rector, said it was felt that KQW
would not be serving public inter
ests by continuing programs on that
subject.

Scott last November provoked
a storm of comment throughout
the Bay Area when lie gave a co
mmute broadcast on KQW an
swering attacks which he claimed
were made during regularly
scheduled church broadcasts. )Af
ter liis broadcast he was denied
additional time on the air because
officials felt atheist programs
should not take space needed for
other programs.

"This moans, Scott told the United
Press, "that I shall have, a .second
time, to petition the FCC to revoke
the license of KQW."
Scott's appearance before a mi
crophone last November followed an
FCC decision upholding his iron
tout ion that if radio .stations grant
time for religious preachings they
also should grant tim>' to those who
preach the doctrines of atheism.
