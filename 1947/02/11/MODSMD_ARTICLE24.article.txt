# Attlee Asks For Support

LONDON, Fob. 10 (UP).-A cri
sis of wartime gravity gripped Eng
land today, with enforcement of a
government - ordered power cut
which denied electricity to thou
sands of factories and millions of
private consumers in homes and
business establishments.
It was a crisis that threatened to
become political as well as econom
ic.
Prime Minister Clement R. Attlee
in a special broadcast to a cold, rig
idly rationed nation in what he
termed a critical emergency, ap
pealed:
"Do your bit as you did in the
war and other emergencies . . . we
will come through this if we pull
together."
Conservative Leader Winston
Churchill, in one of his bitterest
denunciations of the Socialist-Labor
cabinet, said in a special Commons
debate:
"There is little doubt in my mind
that things are going to get worse.
. . . We arc in the presence of an
inescapable breakdown. . . .
"What we are experiencing now
is simply Socialism—or, if you will,
half-baked Socialism —in action.
The brute fact is that Socialism
means mismanagement, bad house
keeping, incompetence in high
places and progressive degeneration
of our island life."
The government blamed the
weather for a big part in the fuel
shortage; the Conservatives blamed
the government.
"Resign! Resign!" shouted Con
servatives to Fuel Minister Emanuel
Shinwell as he defended himself.
The power cut denied electricity
to factories in an area inhabited by
25,000,000 people, at 12:01 a.m. this
morning until further notice. The
cut to private consumers is ofTcc
tive from 9 a.m. until noon.
