COLUMBUS. 0.. Feb. 10.â€”(UP)
- Sources close to Wesley Fesler
learned here today that the Pitts
burgh coach has accepted an offer to
return to his Alma Mater, Ohio
State University, as head football
coach.
Confirmation of the former all-
America end and fullback as suc
cessor to the Colgate-hound Paul
Rixlcr awaited only a meeting of
the Ohio State Athletfl Board.
Ohio State athletic officials said
that a meeting would not bo called
11ir "four or five days" and possibly
not until the regularly scheduled
meeting Feb. 19.
ll was believed that assurance of
;i long tenure, if not an actual con
tract to that effect, proved the final
factor in Fesler's decision 1o leave
Pittsburgh.
Previously. Ohio State coaches
have been hired on a one-year
basis, with a three-year "gentle
man's agreement" for incoming
roaches, and it was widely thought
thai a state law prohibited long
term contracts.
However, an informal ruling from
the state attorney general today re
vealed that nothing in the law pre
vented the university from extend
ing a long-term contract, possibly
a- much as ten years, to Fesler.
