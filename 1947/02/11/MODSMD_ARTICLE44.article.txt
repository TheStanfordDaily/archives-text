# Stephenson’s Ousting Opens Door For S.C. Drive; Cards Up Foul Shot Average
## 
### ART SHAPIRO 
Holding a six-point advantage and well on their way toward
the second half of a double victory over USC, the Indians faltered
in stride, as Steve Stephenson went out on personal fouls last
Saturday evening. The score stood at 37-31 with ten minutes
left in the contest when Stephenson was waved to the bench.
Bob Lewis was rushed in >.s a sub- ♦ —

j stitute for Steve, but it was to no
j avail as Alex Hannum proceeded to
I butt and push Lewis' slight figure
out oi play, meanwhile scoring a
dozen quick points to send the Tro-
I jans into the lead.
The officiating during the two
game series seemed extremely in
j consistent. Alex Hannum's rough
j house tactics were ignored by the
i officials, while minor infractions
were called against the local boys.
DAVIDSON SIDELINED
Davidson, considered as only a
possible starter because of his
weakened physical condition, was
another Redskin who bit the dust,
and had to take in the second half
of the Saturday fray from the
i sidelines. With two of the start
ing five waved out of the game it
became apparent that it was but a
question of time before the Tro
jans would move into the lead and
grab a second-night victory.
The Friday evening encounter
j followed the traditional pattern with
; Stanford coming from behind at
j halftime and moving ahead to a
i convincing victory. After trailing
| 32-26 at the half, the Indians chang
! Ed their defensive tactics and held
USC to 18 points in the second half.
' while they managed to accumulate
;29 counters to cop the contest. 55-50.
HIGGINS TOP SCORER
Babe Higgins and Dave David
son teamed up in the second half
of the game to score eight points
apicct- and pace the squad to its
win. Higgins took top scoring
honors in the first fracas with 15
counters, while Stephenson and
Davidson shared second place
j with 12 each.
The second set-to was a case of
too much Hannum. The 6 foot 6
center was all over the court, domi
nating the Trojan offense. With the
exit of Stephenson Hannum ran
; hog wild, racking up 24 points be-
I fore the gun sounded. Babe Hig-
J gins led the Cardinals in the scor
! ing column with 17 markers. Mor
; ley Thompson, of the ailing throat,
took third place honors with 11.
FOUL SHOTS IMPROVED
Outstanding feature of the two
game series was the fine free
throw average which the Cards
compounded. Stanford made 17 of
| their 28 attempts on Friday night
and 11 out of 15 on Saturday. If
j the team can retain this average
j in future contests, that free throw
bogey, which accounted for the
first defeat at the hands of Cal.

and may in fact provide a margin

The Stanford varsity will be tak-
I ing it easy this week. No practices
] are scheduled for Monday or Thurs
day. The team has reached its peak
and extra sessions might lead to
! staleness, intimated Coach Everett
i Dean.
Drehobl and Carver are in the
Rest Home getting over a slight
fever. Both men are expected to be
in Condition to see action against
USC this week-end in the return
meeting of the two squads. David
son and Thompson are completely
recovered from their bouts with the
j common cold, but all precautions
I are being taken to insure against
any relapses.

Holding a six-point advantage and well on their way toward
the second half of a double victory over USC, the Indians faltered
in stride, as Steve Stephenson went out on personal fouls last
Saturday evening. The score stood at 37-31 with ten minutes

The officiating during the two
game series seemed extremely in

DAVIDSON SIDELINED
Davidson, considered as only a
possible starter because of his
weakened physical condition, was
another Redskin who bit the dust,
and had to take in the second half
of the Saturday fray from the
i sidelines. With two of the start
ing five waved out of the game it
became apparent that it was but a
question of time before the Tro
jans would move into the lead and
grab a second-night victory.
The Friday evening encounter
j followed the traditional pattern with

;29 counters to cop the contest. 55-50.
HIGGINS TOP SCORER
Babe Higgins and Dave David
son teamed up in the second half
of the game to score eight points
apicct- and pace the squad to its
win. Higgins took top scoring
honors in the first fracas with 15
counters, while Stephenson and
Davidson shared second place
j with 12 each.
The second set-to was a case of
too much Hannum. The 6 foot 6
center was all over the court, domi
nating the Trojan offense. With the
exit of Stephenson Hannum ran
; hog wild, racking up 24 points be-
I fore the gun sounded. Babe Hig-
J gins led the Cardinals in the scor
! ing column with 17 markers. Mor
; ley Thompson, of the ailing throat,
took third place honors with 11.
FOUL SHOTS IMPROVED
Outstanding feature of the two
game series was the fine free
throw average which the Cards
compounded. Stanford made 17 of

and 11 out of 15 on Saturday. If
j the team can retain this average
j in future contests, that free throw
bogey, which accounted for the
first defeat at the hands of Cal.
