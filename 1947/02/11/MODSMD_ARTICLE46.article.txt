# Wrestlers On Mat Friday
## 
### LYNN CARMAN 
With an unexpected change of
I schedule leaving them matchless
| last week, Vein Jones' Stanford
wrestlers took time out and looked
| ahead at a grueling schedule which
I will keep them busy for the rest of
I the month.
Their immediate opponents will
be San Jose's Spartans, a team
I which rolled over the Cardinals in
| their last meet by a 21 to 11 margin.
| The Spartans will be here Friday
j night in the gym to take on a
strengthened Stanford squad which
hopefully expects to emerge with a
more favorable balance of points
this time.
S.F.S. SCHEDULED HEBE
Alter taking on the Spartans,
the matinen will go up against
those little men who weren't here
last week—San Francisco State's
wrestlers. S.F.S. will definitely be
| here on Feb. 21. an open date be
! fore the schedule change oc
curred last Thursday.
Thus the Indians will have five
I meets under their belt when they
travel to Oakland on March 1 to
j compete in the Far Western wres
• tling meet. The Far Western draws
| college and amateur teams from all
| over the area and shapes up as one
| of the climax dates of the season.
Right now, it looks very much as
I if the grapplers will wrestle to an
I almost empty house Friday, for the
j varsity cagers will be strutting their
I stuff against U.S.C.'s cagers in the
{ Pavilion at the same time that the
wrestlers will be going through their
paces in the obscurity of the gym.
CHANCE FOR PAVILION
It could happen that no pre
liminary game will be scheduled
for Friday night's cage tilt, in
which event the wrestlers will
1 have a chance to take over the
spot light for a while before the
Pavilion fans.
Whether they wrestle in the Pa
vilion or the gym, the wrestlers still
expect to give an improved account
of themselves as they seek their first
vistory in four starts. Winston
Mumby and Dave Garst. who both
I won their bouts against San Jose
in the last meet, will be on hand
again Friday seeking to repeat.
With Vein Jones, who will be
making a delayed season's debut,
these three men figure to be point
winners against the Spartans.
