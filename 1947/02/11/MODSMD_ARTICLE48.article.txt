# J.V. Meets San Mateo
## 
### 
The early week cage spotlight fo
cuses on the Farm's jayvee quintet
tonight when Jack Dana's hopefuls
entertain a strong San Mateo J.C.
.squad in the Pavilion. Game time is
set for 8.
Bee chances for a top-flight per
formance were bolstered with the
word that Ralph Carver will be re
leased from the Men's Rest Home
this morning and will be suited up
tonight. Carver, a high - scoring
sparkplug at center for the up-and
down junior varsity all season, en
tered the rest home yesterday with
a temperature and possible strep
throat.
Carver will be backed up by Dave
Atcheson and Jim Caldwell in han
dling the pivot chores, with Cene
Martin. George Yardley, and Jack
Meredith ;it the forwards, and Bill
Christiansen, Fred Lewis, Jack
Crahan, and Jack Wood at the
guard posts.
Hopes are running high that the
jayvees will hop back on the win
ning bandwagon after a weekend
loss to Menlo J.C. The Danamen
were in top form two weekends ago
when they drubbed Bee squads
from both San Francisco and Santa
Clara, corning from behind in the
last half of each contest in race
horse fashion to nab their verdicts
with a Hurry of buckets.
