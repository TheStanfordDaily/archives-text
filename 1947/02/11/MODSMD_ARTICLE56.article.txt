So much has been said during the past few
quarters on the subject of current student apa
thy that we grow sick when we hear the word
spoken.
However, regardless of popular dislike of
the subject, the shoulder shrugging, and
"what the hell" expressions it provokes, it is
a problem which appears to be of greater
degree than it has been in the past.
There are probably several logical explana
tions for it if a person just takes the time to
think about it.
For. one, the large number of veterans on
campus who will be here for a short time are
not inclined to involve themselves with othe*
responsibilities than their studies.
The large number of married persons at
tending the university are living lives of their
own, independent of student activities with
the occasional exception of a basketball game
or dance.
Widespread housing makes for a feeling of
cliquishness and disunity which has never
existed before.
All of these things must be considered

when a comparison is made between Stanford
life today and what it was in the past.
The conditions under which we Jive and
attend school have changed, yet the system
by which we try to operate our student gov
ernment is essentially the same as before.
A student government can never make the
pretense of being as extensive as a city or
state government under the present Ameri
can educational system.
With this initial handicap, it is essential that
any student government keep closely abreast
of any campus changes if it is to be effective
in executing the limited powers which it does
possess.
This must be considered by campus or
ganization chairmen before they blandly
criticize the entire student body for "apa
thy."
It will be far better for each organization to
examine its system of operation to determine
whether or not it is performing its functions
as well as it could in light of changes that have
occurred at Stanford during the past few
years.
