Stories from Washington indicate that a campaign
to torpedo the Roosevelt-Hull-Welles Reciprocal
Trade Treaty program is definitely underway. There
will be no open fight to abolish the program, or to
abrogate the present treaties. Rather there will be
a continual sniping at little things, in the hope that
victories on many minor points will add up to some
thing major.
Of course all this has been in the wind for some
time; the protectionist has been with us all along,
lying low. The Hull treaties didn't slay the dragon;
he's been resting, licking his wounds, biding his
time. There have always been special interests seek
ing personal gain at the expense of others, and there
probably always will be.
Ted Norton has pointed out that the only way our
foreign debtors can pay us is by selling us goods.
The U.S. dollar is legal tender only in the United
States; the only place a dollar credit can be spent
is the United States—or some other country in need
of dollar credits to buy U.S. goods, which is essen
tially the same thing. To get dollars for repayment,
they must sell goods—here.
Naturally a high wall of protective tariffs will shut
oIT foreign-made goods, and repayment of loans will
be impossible. After all, they can't pay in pounds
sterling, or francs, or guilders, or drachmas—they
have to have dollars.
Whether we like it or not. this world is now an
economic unit—even though it isn't politically. If
any large country has a depression, there is no way
lo keep it from spreading. Closed markets hurt for
eign states; they put up retaliatory barriers of their
own. The result—everyone gets hurt.-
The United States is now a creditor nation—has
been since World War I. Before that, we were a
debtor country and thus had to have an export bal
ance, to pay our debts. The transition, during the
war, was a swift one. Americans couldn't get the
significance of the change, and insisted on keeping
exports larger than imports.

Trade barriers were established and increased dur
ing the post-war days, and undoubtedly contributed
much to the great crash of 1929. The following year
the Smoot-Hawley tarifT bill was signed by Presi
dent Hoover, and it became our organic tariff act.
This bill went farther in "protecting" U.S. industries,
and insured that the depression would strike every
nation, large or small.
This Smoot-Hawley act is still in effect. The Hull
treaties merely provided for a reciprocal lowering of
duties between the nations; all the agreements are
bilateral rather than multilateral.
No doubt there are many who will say, "To hell
with the rest of the world, let's look out for ourselves
first." But even if we were to be that selfish, protec
tion is not the answer. There is a group of industries
which flourish under protection; there are at least
as many which would be damaged by the retaliation
of other countries. Even should we agree that it is
fair to change the natural order of things in order
to favor one group over another, such a course would
still result in loss to the consumers —and we're all
consumers.
Protection is merely the economic equivalent of
isolationism, which is supposedly in disrepute. A
sustained charge of political isolationism is generally
enough to defeat a candidate for public office; eco
nomic isolationism has no such result, because the
voters don't recognize it for what it is.
Congressmen are elected to positions of leader
ship because they are supposed to he more intelli
gent than the rest of us. A policy of protection is
not intelligent; it is born of fallacy and continues
only because of ignorance.
Probably a majority of the Congress—Republican
and Democratic—realize this, but they must guard
against a well-organized and determined few, rea
soning on false premises and egged on by self-seeking
lobbyists. If this minority meets with any sort of
success, the nation's economy will be damaged im
measurably.

time. There have always been special interests seek
ing personal gain at the expense of others, and there
probably always will be.
Ted Norton has pointed out that the only way our
foreign debtors can pay us is by selling us goods.
The U.S. dollar is legal tender only in the United
States; the only place a dollar credit can be spent
is the United States—or some other country in need
of dollar credits to buy U.S. goods, which is essen
tially the same thing. To get dollars for repayment,
they must sell goods—here.
Naturally a high wall of protective tariffs will shut
oIT foreign-made goods, and repayment of loans will
be impossible. After all, they can't pay in pounds
sterling, or francs, or guilders, or drachmas—they
have to have dollars.
Whether we like it or not. this world is now an
economic unit—even though it isn't politically. If
any large country has a depression, there is no way
lo keep it from spreading. Closed markets hurt for
eign states; they put up retaliatory barriers of their
own. The result—everyone gets hurt.-
The United States is now a creditor nation—has
been since World War I. Before that, we were a
debtor country and thus had to have an export bal
ance, to pay our debts. The transition, during the
war, was a swift one. Americans couldn't get the
significance of the change, and insisted on keeping
exports larger than imports.

Trade barriers were established and increased dur
ing the post-war days, and undoubtedly contributed
much to the great crash of 1929. The following year
the Smoot-Hawley tarifT bill was signed by Presi
dent Hoover, and it became our organic tariff act.
This bill went farther in "protecting" U.S. industries,
and insured that the depression would strike every
nation, large or small.
This Smoot-Hawley act is still in effect. The Hull
treaties merely provided for a reciprocal lowering of
duties between the nations; all the agreements are
bilateral rather than multilateral.
No doubt there are many who will say, "To hell
with the rest of the world, let's look out for ourselves
first." But even if we were to be that selfish, protec
tion is not the answer. There is a group of industries
which flourish under protection; there are at least
as many which would be damaged by the retaliation
of other countries. Even should we agree that it is
fair to change the natural order of things in order
to favor one group over another, such a course would
still result in loss to the consumers —and we're all
consumers.
Protection is merely the economic equivalent of
isolationism, which is supposedly in disrepute. A
sustained charge of political isolationism is generally
enough to defeat a candidate for public office; eco
nomic isolationism has no such result, because the
voters don't recognize it for what it is.
Congressmen are elected to positions of leader
ship because they are supposed to he more intelli
gent than the rest of us. A policy of protection is
not intelligent; it is born of fallacy and continues
only because of ignorance.
Probably a majority of the Congress—Republican
and Democratic—realize this, but they must guard
against a well-organized and determined few, rea
soning on false premises and egged on by self-seeking
lobbyists. If this minority meets with any sort of
success, the nation's economy will be damaged im
measurably.
Stories from Washington indicate that a campaign
to torpedo the Roosevelt-Hull-Welles Reciprocal
Trade Treaty program is definitely underway. There
will be no open fight to abolish the program, or to
abrogate the present treaties. Rather there will be
a continual sniping at little things, in the hope that
victories on many minor points will add up to some
thing major.
Of course all this has been in the wind for some
time; the protectionist has been with us all along,
lying low. The Hull treaties didn't slay the dragon;
he's been resting, licking his wounds, biding his
time. There have always been special interests seek
ing personal gain at the expense of others, and there
probably always will be.
