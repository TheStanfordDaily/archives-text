To the Editor:
II seems to me that Mr. HefFner and Mr. Bashkov
are exceedingly unkind. Their personal delight in
facing facts is scarcely justification enough for their
attacking one of the favorite delusions of the Ameri
can people in general and college students in particu
lar. If we are to allow such individuals not only the
privilege of thinking for themselves, but of EX
PRESSING their radical ideas in periodicals of wide
circulation, such independent habits of thought might
conceivably be communicated to innumerable inno
cent, well-adjusted Americans, to the jeopardy of
our entire system of government. If the implications
1 have suggested seem exaggerated, as they undoubt
edly must, it is well to remember that under excep
tional conditions (and who knows when such con
ditions may arise) there is always the possibility,
however negligible,, that ideas reasonably held and
clearly expressed may be transmitted to others.
Surely we have enough at stake to take reason
able precautions against even so unlikely a danger
as this. "Eternal vigilance," they say, "is the price of
freedom."
Wc Americans like our democracy. We are very
happy that all mon have the same opportunities re
gardless of race, color or creed, and we want our
colleges to train our young people in the mental
habits that have brought about and maintained this
condition. II there are any so coldly rational and de
featist as not to think that we are the Enlightened
Ones of the earth, they should keep their opinions to
themselves. I know of no one so cruel as to tell a
child happy in his thoughts of Santa Claus that such
a gentleman does not exist.
And surely. Mr. HefFner. in his brutal emphasis
on the lack of real issues in campus elections, has
failed to see the essential likeness between elections
on campus and those in that "world outside" for
which the more earnest of our students are so admir
ably anxious to prepare us. Certainly it is obvious
that the elections in both cases help to preserve that
wonderful sense of participation in great events, that
feeling that Every Man. however ignorant and fum

bling. can add his YES to what the politicians have
already decided to do.
Student government, like football games, fresh
man get-togethers, and fraternities, is part of college
life. Would Messrs. Heffner and Bashkov seek to
undermine those very institutions for which so many
of us have come to Stanford?

To the Students of Stanford:
On Feb. 3 at 8:15 a significant talk was given in
Cubbcrley Auditorium. A prominent man came half
way across the country because he had a sincere
desire to give us at Stanford a little of the insight he
has gained through his many years of experience.
The talk was scheduled for eight o'clock, but began
15 minutes late as it was hoped that a few more of
the seemingly mythical seven thousand students
might appear.
However, eight o'clock in the evening remains a
more unpopular time for us to drag ourselves out of
our lethargic state than eight o'clock in the morning.
There were at best but 75 people there. We were
completely ashamed and embarrassed when the el
derly Mr. Kraft walked out on the platform to ad
dress the mass of empty scats. It seemed amazingly
reminiscent of a recent campus assembly.
Ironically, he began by saying that it was not his
custom to speak from prepared notes. He had writ
ten out this speech very carefully though, because
he had been warned that "if one doesn't speak to
Stanford students on an equally high intellectually
level, one will feel very small and insignificant in
deed."
We feel that every one of us is under an obliga
tion to ourselves and to our university to support its
activities with full enthusiasm.
Those of us who went to hear Mr. Kraft this eve
ning. as representatives of you, the students, want
to express our appreciation to the Stanford Memo
rial Church Committee for making this stimulating
talk available.

II seems to me that Mr. HefFner and Mr. Bashkov

facing facts is scarcely justification enough for their
attacking one of the favorite delusions of the Ameri

privilege of thinking for themselves, but of EX
PRESSING their radical ideas in periodicals of wide
circulation, such independent habits of thought might
conceivably be communicated to innumerable inno
cent, well-adjusted Americans, to the jeopardy of
our entire system of government. If the implications

on campus and those in that "world outside" for

that the elections in both cases help to preserve that
wonderful sense of participation in great events, that
feeling that Every Man. however ignorant and fum

To the Students of Stanford:
On Feb. 3 at 8:15 a significant talk was given in
Cubbcrley Auditorium. A prominent man came half
way across the country because he had a sincere
desire to give us at Stanford a little of the insight he
has gained through his many years of experience.
The talk was scheduled for eight o'clock, but began
15 minutes late as it was hoped that a few more of
the seemingly mythical seven thousand students
might appear.
However, eight o'clock in the evening remains a
more unpopular time for us to drag ourselves out of
our lethargic state than eight o'clock in the morning.
There were at best but 75 people there. We were
completely ashamed and embarrassed when the el
derly Mr. Kraft walked out on the platform to ad
dress the mass of empty scats. It seemed amazingly
reminiscent of a recent campus assembly.
Ironically, he began by saying that it was not his
custom to speak from prepared notes. He had writ
