## Items of Interest to Students of Chemistry, Engineering, Physics, and Biology The
						"Whitest of White" Pigments from Black Ore 
### 
!l is ;i strange fact that fhe ninth most
prevalent element in the earth's crust
should liave been regarded as "rare"
Cur over a hundred years after its dis
covery in 1791. But that is the story
of titanium, actually more abundant
than /inc. copper, lead, tin, and nickel
combined. One of t he factors that have
kept titanium from being better known
is the difficulty of handling some of its
compounds commercially.
If, as a student., you were to look up
the equations for the manufacture of
I it,anium oxide pigment, you might find
somet lung like this:
IVI'iO, nl-VjfV 4- Cin + HHIzSO, —Ti(SO 4 ) 2
-I Kt:S() 4 t n!• o 2 (S0 4 ) 3 H- (.Mil 4 3)1F 2 0

no, •. 11 2 (> —>rio 2 + xii 2 o
:: —The exact composition of ilmenite
varies wit h I he source of ! he ore.
From these equations, the manufac
ture of I he "whitest of white" pigments
from black ilmenite ore appears to be
chemically simple and straight forward.
However, the processing required to
obtain industrial titanium oxide of
sufficient, brightness, hiding power and
fineness is more complicated than one
would anticipate.
Controlling a Metastable System
The. final product must have a particle
size averaging 0.2 microns in radius and
varying between 0.1 and 0.5 microns.

To attain this end in
a metastable system
that is ready to go in
the wrong direction
at any time requires
exceedingly rigid
control conditions
throughout.
The essential steps
in the operation are:
1) The careful solu
bilization of ilmenite
in concentrated sul
furic acid to avoid
hydrolysis. 2) The
complete reduction of
any ferric iron to fa
cilitate purification of
tlie solution, with re
moval of any uncon
verted residue and
colloidal slimes.
Crystallization of 70

percent of the iron as FeS()4.7H 2 0—
a critical operation in which tempera
ture must be kept low and wild seed
crystals avoided. 4) Hydrolysis around
105-109° C. — the most important step
of all—because the initial particle size
and pigment properties of the final
product depend on concentration, tem
perature, time of hydrolysis, intensity
of stirring, and presence of foreign ma
terials. In this operation it is not un
usual to talk in terms of parts per mil
lion, rather than the usual analytical
accuracy of 0.01-0.02 per cent. 5) Vary
ing salt treatment of the precipitate,
depending on the impurities. 6) Cal
cination between 900-1000 C. to obtain
the desired particle size. 7) Grinding to
give the proper aggregate size. 8) Treat
ment of the dried pigment in various
ways depending on end use; e.g., in the
automotive, rubber, ceramics, paper,
linoleum,'printing, or other fields.

Wide Diversity of Research Problems

Long and patient research was neces
sary to develop the manufacturing tech
niques now used. Some of the problems
demanded technical skill of the highest
order from the colloid chemist, the phys
ical chemist, the analyst, the crystal
lographcr. the physicist, and other spe
cially (rained men. A wide variety of
instruments, such as the petrographic
microscope, tHe electron microscope,
x-ray diffraction unit, ultra-centrifuge,
and spectrophotometer were used in

this work. Finally the met sdhirjpst, the
chemical engineer, the mechanical on
fjineer, ;in<l Iho indust rial engineer had
1o design equipment to handle t.liirt r»x
tremoly corrosive system economically,
Tlu- manufacture of litnnium pig
ments is another example of (he proh
lcms that constantly challenge chem
ists, engineers and other specialists.
