# 'Communism a Religion', Series Audience Hears
## 
### CECIL ROSPAW 
Communism is a religion based on mechanical concepts and
the degrading of the human spirit, and must be combatted as
such, by a religion based on the rights of men and equally as
strong, Dr. A. Powell Davies warned a sparse Tuesday Evening
Series Audience in Memorial Auditorium last night.

Calling Marx the prophet, Lenin
the Messiah, Lenin's tomb tlie sepul
chre, unci Moscow the Holy City,
Dr. Davies cut through propaganda
to point out that religious "Com
munism is a sincere, but psychopa
thic attempt to adjust the life of
man hurriedly to the world of the
machine . . . its defect is that where
ever its principles are applied man
loses and the machine wins. . .
Dr. Davies is a Washington, D.
C., past or.
He pointed out that the plan is
not militaristic, as no religion is,
but that as they are fanatical, and
believe in their own Tightness, war
will become a method of justice to
them if the ends are achieved.
As a true Communist cannot sin
cerely participate in a United Na
tions for the U.N. conflicts with the
belief that the world is his, Davies
held that of necessity they must be
prepared for war if the "degenerate
heretics" of other nations fail to see
Ihe light.
STUDY THEIR WAY ()l LIFE
He advised that the best we, as in
terested citizens of the western
world could do to combat, this reli
gion, was to read its bibles and
know the whys and wherefores of its
dynamics. He recommended a study
of Dialectical Materialism, and in
novel form, Koestler's "Darkness at
Noon."
Confronted In a new civiliza
tion with its own standard of mo
rals which condones lying and
cheating, as long as it is for the
cause. Dr. Davies gave three solu
tions (o resolve the conflict:
The western world could submit
lo the Kremlin. This he termed an
impossibility because, although we
have made mistakes, and not all evil
is scourged, we are not hopelessly
degenerate. And as long as we be
lieve in the human and not the plan
there is hope.
It was here that Davies warned
that we should beware of "neurotic"
and confused liberals who believe
that Russia can do no wrong.
The Kremlin could submit to the
western world. This is again an im
possibility for obvious reasons.
THIRD POSSIBILITY
As a third possibility to resolve
Ihe conflict Dr. Davies offered the
idea that western nations could only
make the future secure by recogniz
ing the inevitable ideological con
flict now. That we should make the
U.N. structure a workable one, ask
and force world-wide disarmament.
That we must recognize our own
deficiencies, for unless all in the
west arc benefitting from our soci
ety how can we expect to present a
united front to this new force?
He pointed out that we must he
able to distinguish between Soci
alists, and even New Dealers, who
are attempting to resolve the I
world to the conflict but still be- I
lieve in the basic liberties of (he j
people, from the true Communist ]
who will sacrifice all for the ends.
Calling on the western world to
accept Lincoln, not Lenin as the
20th Century apostle, Davies broke
from his speech to plead the special
cases of England and France and
pleaded co-operation for "A house
divided against itself must fall."
' American Liberals are spending
too much time on their knees, re
penting, and not enough on their
feet going somewhere," he added.
And then concluded on the humble, |
prayerful note to follow truth and
let courage be great but remember
that "My opposition is my fellow
man and my enemy is my brother."
