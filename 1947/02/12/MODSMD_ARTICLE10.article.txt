# Mitchell Tells Of Farm Life In Early Days

Dr. J. P. Mlteheii, registrar at
Stanford from 11)25 to 1945, said at
an informal discussion meeting at
the Women's Clubhouse yesterday
that it is difficult, to know where
history stops and traditions begin.
"History and traditions are fus
ed together and intertwined so
that it is almost impossible to sep
arate them," be remarked.
First on Dr. Mitchell's list of fore
most traditions is the honor code.
"The honor code is the most valu
able thing we have here and it can
only be maintained through student
co-operation," he declared. "In a
system of proctors, students some
times feel that they are smart if they
can put something over on the proc
tor, but in an honor code system the
student is only cheating himself and
the other students."
A tradition that has been recently
emphasized on campus is the spirit
of friendliness and the "hello" greet
ing from one Stanford student to
another. Dr. David Starr Jordan, a
great rememberer of student names
and also a foremost, ichthyologist,
remarked one time that every time
he learned a new student's name he
had lo forget the Latin title of a fish.
The "share the ride" tradition
arose with the advent of automo
biles on campus. In the transpor
tation history of Stanford Univer
sity students have used foot, bi
cycle. trolley, and horse and buggy
transportation.
Dr. Mitchell remarked that before
the bicycle Encina men had to walk
to Palo Alto every day for break
fast, lunch, and dinner. "They were
really men then," he added.
Dr. Mitchell pointed to "No
Smoking on Quad" as one of the
traditions that has fallen by the
wayside in the past years.
"When I was here you could
always tell a stranger if he smok
ed a cigar on the inner quadran
gle," he said.
The famous Axe, which is now
one of the rallying points of rivalry
between Cal and Stanford, liad a
very inauspicious start. Dr. Mitchell
said. It was found by one of the stu
dents in the hills and has now be
come so important that it has often
been kept in safety vaults for pro
tection.
Dr. Mitchell gave the history of
several other traditions, namely, the
story of Sam Mac Donald, the Con
Home, the spirit of freedom on cam
pus, the student organization fund,
student government, and the tradi
tion of limiting women's enrollment
to $500.
