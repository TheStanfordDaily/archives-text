# Clark, Russians Clash; British Crisis Growing
## Army, Navy Called Out; More Power Cuts to Come 
### 
LONDON, Teb. 11 (UP).—The government
called on the army, navy and air force for aid
today in battling a steadily intensifying fuel
crisis and warned that its drastic power cuts
might be extended to all Great Britain except
northernmost Scotland within three days.

Continued blizzards, which swept
great areas of the country, and in
tense cold added to the gravity of a
situation which now bordered on
the desperate. Tonight the temper
ature dropped steadily and more
j snow was predicted tomorrow.
The crisis spread to southern Ire
i land where the government can
celled all passenger train service for
Thursday, all freight service for Fri
day and cancelled all soft coal de
liveries for private consumers.
SUBMARINES USED
Emergency orders were issued to
Ihe admiralty and the war office to
give all possible assistance in fight
ing the fuel shortage and the para
lyzing effects of snowstorms.
Naval vessels were ordered to
escort stormbound coal ships. Twen
ty-six submarines were pressed in
to service to provide electric power
to stockyards. Thousands of troops
aided by civilians, Polish exile
troops and German war prisoners
worked in blizzards, clearing 15-foot
snowdrifts which blocked highways
and railroads, and flatne thrower
detachments were ordered out to
melt the snow.
Many villages and one Royal Air
i Force station in Lincolnshire were
j Isolated. Royal Air Force bombing
planes were ordered out, starting
I tomorrow, to parachute food to
them.
BIG BEN BLAC KED OUT
Naval experts considered the fea
sibility of sending a submarine fleet
to London to provide electricity,
pointing out that, one vessel could
provide sufficient power for 10,000
! persons.
Striving to save every ounce of
fuel, the government even blacked
out the face of Big Ben, the famous
clock on the Houses of Parliament,
effective tonight. But the weather
defeated all its efforts to build up
vitally needed coal supplies.
