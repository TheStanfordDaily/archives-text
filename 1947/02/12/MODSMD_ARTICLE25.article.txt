"I paint in the way thai comes
i most naturally to me and that I find
1 most satisfying," Mr. Mendelowitz '
remarked. "I am less interested in t
pattern and color for its own sake
than I am in creatine the patterns
and colors that will hest express
(lie mood and character of the land
â– eapes th.it I see around me and find
beautiful."
His landscapes arc marked by [
realism at a time when abstraction 1
and highly stylized ways of working (
are in vogue.
Mr. Mendelowitz, who exhibits
regularly in regional and national j
j watercolor shows, has been a mem- I
i ber of the faculty since 1934. '
