to include in the Austrian
trvaty a clause forbidding any sort,
of "pan-Germanic propaganda."
Clark said that Russia's interpre
tation of such "propaganda" at
meetings of the Allied Control Com
mission for Austria had resulted in
Russian interference with Austrian
newspapers. Russia protested, he
said, when Austrian newspapej .
even mentioned the word Germany
unless they did so to denounce that
country.

country.

in the end, on the clause forbidding
union with Germany, and Clark ac
cepted a British-French proposal
