## SLING TIME 
### 
I irsi the Main*, Then Gehrig, Then Ott;
!Now Hank Greenherg Is on the Sidelines
So Hank Greenberg is "considering" putting an end to his baseball
career. That marks a milestone—at least for me. Old Hankus Pancus was
just starting out on his meteoric climb to stardom when I first started
billowing baseball; to me, he was always a part of baseball itself.
To kids of a previous era, of course, Babe Ruth was the idol, but when
1 started reading the sports pages the Bambino was already on the down
ward path. Hank Greenberg along with Lou Gehrig and Mel Ott—was
iny personal hero. The Williarnses and DiMaggios were still in the future.
To a baseball fan, there's something about a big fellow who can get up
there and powder the ball over Ihe fence that catches the imagination.
I .on Gehrig faded and died; Mel Ott reached the end of the trail as a
player and had to spend more and more time on the bench. Of my per
sonal terrific triumvirate, only Greenberg remained.
But Hank was still going strong. Last year he came back from the wars,
85 years old an age when most big league performers have retired to
their rocking chairs and led the major leagues in both home run clouting
and runs batted in. It looked as if he had at least one good year left in
bis system but fate stepped in and threw a Sunday punch.
Ilr Alight Have Had Thai '"Last Bi<» Year* 1
For it was fate, not age, that put the end-mark to Hank Greenberg's
playing days if he actually is through—for 1 firmly believe that be still
has that "one year" left in his system, if he cares to use it.
Ilank, you see. spent all his baseball life with the Detroit Tigers—and
his playing life was synonymous with his manhood, for he was just a boy
when he signed with the Tigers. Throughout the years he learned to love
bis club, and the men who were his teammates. For some, it might be
hard to believe that, in a commercialized business like baseball, where
money measures everything, a man could get sentimental—but it has
happened lime without number through the past; is still happening, as a
mailer of fact.
Big Hank was all set to put in that last big year for the Tigers this
coming season, but he knew he couldn't last much longer. Baseball has
been his life; that's all he knows —so he applied for an executive position
wilb the Tigers. But it wasn't in the cards.
The Tigers didn't want him in their organization, evidently; at any
rale, he was waived out of the American League and sold to the rival
National League's Pittsburgh Pirates. Cruellest blow of all, for Hank, he
wasn't even informed of (he deal: he heard the story over the radio. A
sensitive man, he undoubtedly fell—at least for awhile—that all his loy
ally lo his club had been wasted, that the Tigers had used him for what
(hey could get out of him, that they didn't even think enough of him to
lei him down easy.
That waiver business is tricky; according to the rules of the game, a
player can't be sold to the rival league until every other team in the
league has been offered a chance to buy him for $7,500 and refused. But
there are cute ways to get around rules of that sort. A list of players is
submit fed to all the other teams; a list comprised of second-raters and
two or three stars.
< llaim "Eni, Isnl Just Try and Get 'Em
Naturally one or more clubs will put in claims for the stars, but it
doesn't do them any good; as soon as a claim is put in, their names are
withdrawn. They're not for Sale; not for $7,500 or for any other price—
for then they'd still be in the same league, and might do damage to the
selling club.
But the next time the club puts out a waiver list, the name of the man
they want to sell into the other league is on it again, and on the next one,
and the next, until finally the other clubs get tired of the business and
let the list slip by without claiming him. Then he can be sold out of the
league.
Thai's what happened when the American League's New York Yankees
suddenly sold pitcher Hank Borowy to the National League's Chicago
Cubs in the middle of the 1045 season.
That's what happened to Hank Greenberg. Dishonest? Not technically,
but beyond a doubt it's a clever dodge to evade the spirit of the rules of
baseball, even though it is "strictly within the law." That's a broken ferfce
baseball will have to mend, sooner or later—and it should be sooner.
I>ul the hole in the wall is slill there, and the management of the De
troit Tigers pushed Hank right through it. .Maybe Hank didn't fit into
the Tigers' plans, either as a player or as an executive—but it seems to
me they could have disposed of the old horse much more honorably. They
at least could have broken the news personally, without leaving Hank to
lind oul from a news broadcast. They didn't even turn down his appli
cation for that executive's job; they didn't even answer it.
Slugging Hank could get the biggest salary he ever earned from the
Pirates this year. It's possible he'll still reconsider and accept, and I hope
he does; he's the last of my boyhood sports heroes, and I hate to see him
go. 1 know many others my age feel the same way.
Not Jnsl an Athlete, But a Symbol
He doesn't have to play to eat, though, and that's a big factor. He's
f-aved and invested those big checks he's been drawing for years, and is
financially secure. In addition, he's married to one of America's richer
women—Carole Gimbel of the department store Gimbels. He could prob
ably buy and sell most of the major league baseball clubs.
Many non-baseball fans will read this and say, "Why get saccharine
with nostalgia over a professional athlete who got paid well for every
move he made on the field?" Maybe it's because, to me. Hank is a symbol,
a link with more carefree days. I hate to think of the big show without,
old Hank booming out those home runs.
I hale to think of the guy leaving like this, sad and disillusioned. Sure
he got paid; he got paid well—lnil any baseball fan will tell you he
always gave value received. He never let down a fan. He was never a
prima donna. He played because he loves baseball; I think he'd have
stuck to the sport even though he knew he could make twice the money
al something else. There aren't so many like thai, these days; too many
of the big stars are in il for (he money, nothing else.
Hank loved baseball, and it hit him a low blow. If he actually quits,
it will be because he thinks he's not wanted. Well, maybe some money
grubbing baseball entrepeneurs don't want him any more—but thousands
upon thousands of baseball nuts from coast to coast feel differently about
it. They'd like to see him put in that one last good year—even though it
would seem a little strange to see Big Hank playing for the Pirates of
the hated National League.
They'll miss him; as for me—it's the end of an era.

Naturally one or more clubs will put in claims for the stars, but it
doesn't do them any good; as soon as a claim is put in, their names are
withdrawn. They're not for Sale; not for $7,500 or for any other price—
for then they'd still be in the same league, and might do damage to the
selling club.
But the next time the club puts out a waiver list, the name of the man
they want to sell into the other league is on it again, and on the next one,

league.
Thai's what happened when the American League's New York Yankees
suddenly sold pitcher Hank Borowy to the National League's Chicago
Cubs in the middle of the 1045 season.
That's what happened to Hank Greenberg. Dishonest? Not technically,
but beyond a doubt it's a clever dodge to evade the spirit of the rules of
baseball, even though it is "strictly within the law." That's a broken ferfce
baseball will have to mend, sooner or later—and it should be sooner.
I>ul the hole in the wall is slill there, and the management of the De

the Tigers' plans, either as a player or as an executive—but it seems to
me they could have disposed of the old horse much more honorably. They
at least could have broken the news personally, without leaving Hank to

Slugging Hank could get the biggest salary he ever earned from the
Pirates this year. It's possible he'll still reconsider and accept, and I hope
he does; he's the last of my boyhood sports heroes, and I hate to see him

Not Jnsl an Athlete, But a Symbol
He doesn't have to play to eat, though, and that's a big factor. He's
f-aved and invested those big checks he's been drawing for years, and is
financially secure. In addition, he's married to one of America's richer
women—Carole Gimbel of the department store Gimbels. He could prob
ably buy and sell most of the major league baseball clubs.
Many non-baseball fans will read this and say, "Why get saccharine
with nostalgia over a professional athlete who got paid well for every
move he made on the field?" Maybe it's because, to me. Hank is a symbol,
a link with more carefree days. I hate to think of the big show without,
old Hank booming out those home runs.
I hale to think of the guy leaving like this, sad and disillusioned. Sure
he got paid; he got paid well—lnil any baseball fan will tell you he
always gave value received. He never let down a fan. He was never a
prima donna. He played because he loves baseball; I think he'd have
stuck to the sport even though he knew he could make twice the money
al something else. There aren't so many like thai, these days; too many
of the big stars are in il for (he money, nothing else.
Hank loved baseball, and it hit him a low blow. If he actually quits,
it will be because he thinks he's not wanted. Well, maybe some money
grubbing baseball entrepeneurs don't want him any more—but thousands
upon thousands of baseball nuts from coast to coast feel differently about
it. They'd like to see him put in that one last good year—even though it
would seem a little strange to see Big Hank playing for the Pirates of
the hated National League.
They'll miss him; as for me—it's the end of an era.
I irsi the Main*, Then Gehrig, Then Ott;
!Now Hank Greenherg Is on the Sidelines
So Hank Greenberg is "considering" putting an end to his baseball
career. That marks a milestone—at least for me. Old Hankus Pancus was
just starting out on his meteoric climb to stardom when I first started
billowing baseball; to me, he was always a part of baseball itself.
To kids of a previous era, of course, Babe Ruth was the idol, but when
1 started reading the sports pages the Bambino was already on the down
ward path. Hank Greenberg along with Lou Gehrig and Mel Ott—was
iny personal hero. The Williarnses and DiMaggios were still in the future.
To a baseball fan, there's something about a big fellow who can get up
there and powder the ball over Ihe fence that catches the imagination.
I .on Gehrig faded and died; Mel Ott reached the end of the trail as a
player and had to spend more and more time on the bench. Of my per
sonal terrific triumvirate, only Greenberg remained.
But Hank was still going strong. Last year he came back from the wars,
85 years old an age when most big league performers have retired to
their rocking chairs and led the major leagues in both home run clouting
and runs batted in. It looked as if he had at least one good year left in
bis system but fate stepped in and threw a Sunday punch.

For it was fate, not age, that put the end-mark to Hank Greenberg's
playing days if he actually is through—for 1 firmly believe that be still

Ilank, you see. spent all his baseball life with the Detroit Tigers—and
his playing life was synonymous with his manhood, for he was just a boy
when he signed with the Tigers. Throughout the years he learned to love
bis club, and the men who were his teammates. For some, it might be
hard to believe that, in a commercialized business like baseball, where
money measures everything, a man could get sentimental—but it has
happened lime without number through the past; is still happening, as a
mailer of fact.
Big Hank was all set to put in that last big year for the Tigers this
coming season, but he knew he couldn't last much longer. Baseball has
been his life; that's all he knows —so he applied for an executive position
wilb the Tigers. But it wasn't in the cards.
The Tigers didn't want him in their organization, evidently; at any
rale, he was waived out of the American League and sold to the rival
National League's Pittsburgh Pirates. Cruellest blow of all, for Hank, he
wasn't even informed of (he deal: he heard the story over the radio. A
sensitive man, he undoubtedly fell—at least for awhile—that all his loy
ally lo his club had been wasted, that the Tigers had used him for what
(hey could get out of him, that they didn't even think enough of him to
lei him down easy.
That waiver business is tricky; according to the rules of the game, a
player can't be sold to the rival league until every other team in the
league has been offered a chance to buy him for $7,500 and refused. But
there are cute ways to get around rules of that sort. A list of players is

it will be because he thinks he's not wanted. Well, maybe some money
grubbing baseball entrepeneurs don't want him any more—but thousands
upon thousands of baseball nuts from coast to coast feel differently about
it. They'd like to see him put in that one last good year—even though it
would seem a little strange to see Big Hank playing for the Pirates of
the hated National League.
They'll miss him; as for me—it's the end of an era.
I irsi the Main*, Then Gehrig, Then Ott;
!Now Hank Greenherg Is on the Sidelines
So Hank Greenberg is "considering" putting an end to his baseball
career. That marks a milestone—at least for me. Old Hankus Pancus was
just starting out on his meteoric climb to stardom when I first started
billowing baseball; to me, he was always a part of baseball itself.
To kids of a previous era, of course, Babe Ruth was the idol, but when
1 started reading the sports pages the Bambino was already on the down
ward path. Hank Greenberg along with Lou Gehrig and Mel Ott—was
iny personal hero. The Williarnses and DiMaggios were still in the future.
To a baseball fan, there's something about a big fellow who can get up
there and powder the ball over Ihe fence that catches the imagination.
I .on Gehrig faded and died; Mel Ott reached the end of the trail as a
player and had to spend more and more time on the bench. Of my per
sonal terrific triumvirate, only Greenberg remained.
But Hank was still going strong. Last year he came back from the wars,
85 years old an age when most big league performers have retired to
their rocking chairs and led the major leagues in both home run clouting
and runs batted in. It looked as if he had at least one good year left in
bis system but fate stepped in and threw a Sunday punch.
Ilr Alight Have Had Thai '"Last Bi<» Year* 1
For it was fate, not age, that put the end-mark to Hank Greenberg's
playing days if he actually is through—for 1 firmly believe that be still
has that "one year" left in his system, if he cares to use it.
Ilank, you see. spent all his baseball life with the Detroit Tigers—and
his playing life was synonymous with his manhood, for he was just a boy
when he signed with the Tigers. Throughout the years he learned to love
bis club, and the men who were his teammates. For some, it might be
hard to believe that, in a commercialized business like baseball, where
money measures everything, a man could get sentimental—but it has
happened lime without number through the past; is still happening, as a
mailer of fact.
Big Hank was all set to put in that last big year for the Tigers this
coming season, but he knew he couldn't last much longer. Baseball has
been his life; that's all he knows —so he applied for an executive position
wilb the Tigers. But it wasn't in the cards.
The Tigers didn't want him in their organization, evidently; at any
rale, he was waived out of the American League and sold to the rival
National League's Pittsburgh Pirates. Cruellest blow of all, for Hank, he
wasn't even informed of (he deal: he heard the story over the radio. A
sensitive man, he undoubtedly fell—at least for awhile—that all his loy
ally lo his club had been wasted, that the Tigers had used him for what
(hey could get out of him, that they didn't even think enough of him to
lei him down easy.
That waiver business is tricky; according to the rules of the game, a
player can't be sold to the rival league until every other team in the
league has been offered a chance to buy him for $7,500 and refused. But
there are cute ways to get around rules of that sort. A list of players is
submit fed to all the other teams; a list comprised of second-raters and
two or three stars.
< llaim "Eni, Isnl Just Try and Get 'Em
Naturally one or more clubs will put in claims for the stars, but it
doesn't do them any good; as soon as a claim is put in, their names are
withdrawn. They're not for Sale; not for $7,500 or for any other price—
for then they'd still be in the same league, and might do damage to the
selling club.
But the next time the club puts out a waiver list, the name of the man
they want to sell into the other league is on it again, and on the next one,
and the next, until finally the other clubs get tired of the business and
let the list slip by without claiming him. Then he can be sold out of the
league.
Thai's what happened when the American League's New York Yankees
suddenly sold pitcher Hank Borowy to the National League's Chicago
Cubs in the middle of the 1045 season.
That's what happened to Hank Greenberg. Dishonest? Not technically,
but beyond a doubt it's a clever dodge to evade the spirit of the rules of
baseball, even though it is "strictly within the law." That's a broken ferfce
baseball will have to mend, sooner or later—and it should be sooner.
I>ul the hole in the wall is slill there, and the management of the De
troit Tigers pushed Hank right through it. .Maybe Hank didn't fit into
the Tigers' plans, either as a player or as an executive—but it seems to
me they could have disposed of the old horse much more honorably. They
at least could have broken the news personally, without leaving Hank to
lind oul from a news broadcast. They didn't even turn down his appli
cation for that executive's job; they didn't even answer it.
Slugging Hank could get the biggest salary he ever earned from the
Pirates this year. It's possible he'll still reconsider and accept, and I hope
he does; he's the last of my boyhood sports heroes, and I hate to see him
go. 1 know many others my age feel the same way.
Not Jnsl an Athlete, But a Symbol
He doesn't have to play to eat, though, and that's a big factor. He's
f-aved and invested those big checks he's been drawing for years, and is
financially secure. In addition, he's married to one of America's richer
women—Carole Gimbel of the department store Gimbels. He could prob
ably buy and sell most of the major league baseball clubs.
Many non-baseball fans will read this and say, "Why get saccharine
with nostalgia over a professional athlete who got paid well for every
move he made on the field?" Maybe it's because, to me. Hank is a symbol,
a link with more carefree days. I hate to think of the big show without,
old Hank booming out those home runs.
I hale to think of the guy leaving like this, sad and disillusioned. Sure
he got paid; he got paid well—lnil any baseball fan will tell you he
always gave value received. He never let down a fan. He was never a
prima donna. He played because he loves baseball; I think he'd have
stuck to the sport even though he knew he could make twice the money
al something else. There aren't so many like thai, these days; too many
of the big stars are in il for (he money, nothing else.

That waiver business is tricky; according to the rules of the game, a
player can't be sold to the rival league until every other team in the
league has been offered a chance to buy him for $7,500 and refused. But
there are cute ways to get around rules of that sort. A list of players is
submit fed to all the other teams; a list comprised of second-raters and
two or three stars.
< llaim "Eni, Isnl Just Try and Get 'Em
Naturally one or more clubs will put in claims for the stars, but it
doesn't do them any good; as soon as a claim is put in, their names are
withdrawn. They're not for Sale; not for $7,500 or for any other price—
for then they'd still be in the same league, and might do damage to the
selling club.
But the next time the club puts out a waiver list, the name of the man
they want to sell into the other league is on it again, and on the next one,
and the next, until finally the other clubs get tired of the business and
let the list slip by without claiming him. Then he can be sold out of the
league.
Thai's what happened when the American League's New York Yankees
suddenly sold pitcher Hank Borowy to the National League's Chicago
Cubs in the middle of the 1045 season.
That's what happened to Hank Greenberg. Dishonest? Not technically,
but beyond a doubt it's a clever dodge to evade the spirit of the rules of
baseball, even though it is "strictly within the law." That's a broken ferfce
baseball will have to mend, sooner or later—and it should be sooner.
I>ul the hole in the wall is slill there, and the management of the De
troit Tigers pushed Hank right through it. .Maybe Hank didn't fit into
the Tigers' plans, either as a player or as an executive—but it seems to
me they could have disposed of the old horse much more honorably. They
at least could have broken the news personally, without leaving Hank to
lind oul from a news broadcast. They didn't even turn down his appli
cation for that executive's job; they didn't even answer it.
Slugging Hank could get the biggest salary he ever earned from the
Pirates this year. It's possible he'll still reconsider and accept, and I hope
he does; he's the last of my boyhood sports heroes, and I hate to see him
go. 1 know many others my age feel the same way.
Not Jnsl an Athlete, But a Symbol
He doesn't have to play to eat, though, and that's a big factor. He's
f-aved and invested those big checks he's been drawing for years, and is
financially secure. In addition, he's married to one of America's richer
women—Carole Gimbel of the department store Gimbels. He could prob
ably buy and sell most of the major league baseball clubs.
Many non-baseball fans will read this and say, "Why get saccharine
with nostalgia over a professional athlete who got paid well for every
move he made on the field?" Maybe it's because, to me. Hank is a symbol,
a link with more carefree days. I hate to think of the big show without,
old Hank booming out those home runs.
I hale to think of the guy leaving like this, sad and disillusioned. Sure
he got paid; he got paid well—lnil any baseball fan will tell you he
always gave value received. He never let down a fan. He was never a
prima donna. He played because he loves baseball; I think he'd have
stuck to the sport even though he knew he could make twice the money
al something else. There aren't so many like thai, these days; too many
of the big stars are in il for (he money, nothing else.
Hank loved baseball, and it hit him a low blow. If he actually quits,
it will be because he thinks he's not wanted. Well, maybe some money
grubbing baseball entrepeneurs don't want him any more—but thousands
upon thousands of baseball nuts from coast to coast feel differently about
it. They'd like to see him put in that one last good year—even though it
would seem a little strange to see Big Hank playing for the Pirates of
the hated National League.
They'll miss him; as for me—it's the end of an era.
I irsi the Main*, Then Gehrig, Then Ott;
!Now Hank Greenherg Is on the Sidelines
So Hank Greenberg is "considering" putting an end to his baseball
career. That marks a milestone—at least for me. Old Hankus Pancus was
just starting out on his meteoric climb to stardom when I first started
billowing baseball; to me, he was always a part of baseball itself.
To kids of a previous era, of course, Babe Ruth was the idol, but when
1 started reading the sports pages the Bambino was already on the down
ward path. Hank Greenberg along with Lou Gehrig and Mel Ott—was
iny personal hero. The Williarnses and DiMaggios were still in the future.
To a baseball fan, there's something about a big fellow who can get up
there and powder the ball over Ihe fence that catches the imagination.
I .on Gehrig faded and died; Mel Ott reached the end of the trail as a
player and had to spend more and more time on the bench. Of my per
sonal terrific triumvirate, only Greenberg remained.
But Hank was still going strong. Last year he came back from the wars,
85 years old an age when most big league performers have retired to
their rocking chairs and led the major leagues in both home run clouting
and runs batted in. It looked as if he had at least one good year left in
bis system but fate stepped in and threw a Sunday punch.
Ilr Alight Have Had Thai '"Last Bi<» Year* 1
For it was fate, not age, that put the end-mark to Hank Greenberg's
playing days if he actually is through—for 1 firmly believe that be still
has that "one year" left in his system, if he cares to use it.
Ilank, you see. spent all his baseball life with the Detroit Tigers—and
his playing life was synonymous with his manhood, for he was just a boy
when he signed with the Tigers. Throughout the years he learned to love
bis club, and the men who were his teammates. For some, it might be
hard to believe that, in a commercialized business like baseball, where
money measures everything, a man could get sentimental—but it has
happened lime without number through the past; is still happening, as a
mailer of fact.
Big Hank was all set to put in that last big year for the Tigers this
coming season, but he knew he couldn't last much longer. Baseball has
been his life; that's all he knows —so he applied for an executive position
wilb the Tigers. But it wasn't in the cards.
The Tigers didn't want him in their organization, evidently; at any
rale, he was waived out of the American League and sold to the rival
National League's Pittsburgh Pirates. Cruellest blow of all, for Hank, he
wasn't even informed of (he deal: he heard the story over the radio. A
sensitive man, he undoubtedly fell—at least for awhile—that all his loy
ally lo his club had been wasted, that the Tigers had used him for what
(hey could get out of him, that they didn't even think enough of him to
lei him down easy.
