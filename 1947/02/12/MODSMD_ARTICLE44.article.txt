# Speedy San Mateo Jaycee five Beats Jayvees, 41-31
## 
### BOB PANNELL 
The San Mateo Junior College
five defeated the Stanford Jay
vees, 41-31, in a lacklustre con
test played at the pavilion last
night. San Mateo led at half
time 17-15.
The Indians played sluggishly
throughout the fray, and were un
able to capitalize on their numer
ous scoring opportunities. Their
foul shooting was equally oil.
Dave Atcheson and George Yard
ley kepi the home team in the run
ning up until seven minutes of the !
last half. A leg injury however,
forced Big Dave to the sidelines j
with the score tied at 24-24. There
after Stanford was unable to clear :
their backboard shots.
Christiansen, the best of the
Jayvee guards, was in for one play
of the second h:ilf and almost im
mediately wrenched his ankle. ■
The San Mateuns turned on their
scoring power full blast and drew !
into the lead easily. With two |
minutes remaining to play, they |
were fourteen points in front.
A red-headed guard, Babcock,
and little Joe Matulich were the
leading factors in the Jaycees be- ,
lated drive. Both played good floor
games and were consistently set
ting up wide-open scoring plays.
Babcock led the visitors, tallying 8 i
points to Matulich's 7.
Italph Carver, normally the (irst
string center of the Reds, is still
ailing with a strep throat and con
sequently was not in uniform. It
was the second straight loss for
the Stanfordites. This coming Sat
urday, in a preliminary to the
Varsity-Southern Cal game, they
meet Menlo Junior College.
Yardley was beyond any doubt
the outstanding player in last
night's tilt. He made some beauti
ful saves for Stanford, and on one
occasion netted a difficult backhand
pivot. Had a few of his many tap
shots rolled ihe other way, the re
sult could easily have been in the
Cardinals' favor.


BATHING BEAUTY—This is Brendu Ilelser, who stacks up will against
almost any girl in a bathing suit you could ever hope to see. But Stan
ford's beauteous Brcnda. unlike the other girls who are easy on the eyes,
actually gels her suit wet. She's broken several national swimming rec
ords. and is looked upon as a cinch to make the 1!I4X Olympic team.

last half. A leg injury however,
forced Big Dave to the sidelines j
with the score tied at 24-24. There
after Stanford was unable to clear :
their backboard shots.
Christiansen, the best of the
Jayvee guards, was in for one play
of the second h:ilf and almost im
mediately wrenched his ankle. ■
The San Mateuns turned on their
scoring power full blast and drew !
into the lead easily. With two |
minutes remaining to play, they |
were fourteen points in front.
A red-headed guard, Babcock,
and little Joe Matulich were the
leading factors in the Jaycees be- ,
lated drive. Both played good floor
games and were consistently set
ting up wide-open scoring plays.
Babcock led the visitors, tallying 8 i
points to Matulich's 7.
Italph Carver, normally the (irst
string center of the Reds, is still
ailing with a strep throat and con
sequently was not in uniform. It
was the second straight loss for
the Stanfordites. This coming Sat
urday, in a preliminary to the
Varsity-Southern Cal game, they
meet Menlo Junior College.
Yardley was beyond any doubt
the outstanding player in last
night's tilt. He made some beauti
ful saves for Stanford, and on one
occasion netted a difficult backhand
pivot. Had a few of his many tap
shots rolled ihe other way, the re
sult could easily have been in the
Cardinals' favor.


BATHING BEAUTY—This is Brendu Ilelser, who stacks up will against
almost any girl in a bathing suit you could ever hope to see. But Stan
ford's beauteous Brcnda. unlike the other girls who are easy on the eyes,
actually gels her suit wet. She's broken several national swimming rec
ords. and is looked upon as a cinch to make the 1!I4X Olympic team.

five defeated the Stanford Jay
vees, 41-31, in a lacklustre con
test played at the pavilion last

throughout the fray, and were un
able to capitalize on their numer
ous scoring opportunities. Their
foul shooting was equally oil.
Dave Atcheson and George Yard
ley kepi the home team in the run
ning up until seven minutes of the !
last half. A leg injury however,
forced Big Dave to the sidelines j
