# Boxers Face Davis Aggies
## 
### 
— —
After a relatively short six-day '
layoff, Stanford's ringmen Ret back .
into action tomorrow night against
a reputedly weak Cal Aggie boxing
squad in the Basketball Pavilion.
The Indians, buoyed by their !
surprising showing against UCLA |
last weekend, will be out to make j
it two for two in the victory col- j
umn. and keep their 1!)47 intercol- |
legiate record at the 1.000 mark.
From advance dope available. J
| Stanford's chances of maintaining a j
| clean slate look reasonably good. ■
The Aggies, in their only reported j
! outing, suffered a convincing defeat |
at the hands of San Jose State, while
! Coach Clayton Frye's charges have ,
j a sizzling 7-!J win over the Bruins to j
I their credit.
Six bouts are scheduled: the
Cardinals will forfeit the 125-lh.
match, and in return the Aggies
will not contest (he 165-lb. issue.
This exchange of forfeits will start
both teams off with one point, and
will — incidentally — give Farm
middleweight Yank Levin a few
extra days to catch his breath af
ter his "track meet" tussle with
UCLA's Art Fraisse last Friday.
Following tomorrow's hostilities
1 on the Stanford boxing calendar will
be another date with the Cal Aggies
—set for Feb. 20 at Davis.
