## Why You Take a Chance on a Dance 
### 
During the last few months, campus dance
after campus dance has either put its sponsor
in debt or at least given the secretary-treasurer
a bad scare. Everyone has been poking around
for the answer. Some organizations have put
the blame on publicity. Others have pointed
to the bands and said, there's your trouble. In
some cases the latter is possibly true. Hot
bands, at least, just don't sell these days.
But we wonder if the trouble lies else
where.
If Cardinals did not sell as many Sadie Haw
kins' tickets as they had hoped, perhaps the
reason can be indicated by the following
quote.
"Who do I know that's worth $2.50?" This,
we are told, is what a good number of women
asked themselves last week when the dance
was announced. A lot of them concluded, "No
body."
Before we argue the pros and cons of this
however, let's consider a factor that probably
has its effect on other dances.
A common complaint heard from the veter
ans, who after all form the greater part of the
male students on campus, is, "They're all so

I
young, and besides, I've got too much work
to do."
The cause ol the problem facing social
chairmen can be found in those two quotes.
To state it simply: Never before has there
been such a psychological and age gap be
tween the sexes on campus.
So what is the result? On one side we find
the women complaining about the men, and
on the other side, vice versa. When such a
situation exists on a fairly large scale it is
bound to have an effect on such campus activi
ties as dances.
We are not saying this is the main reason
campus dances have been precarious ven
tures. We are not putting this forward as a
great discovery, but perhaps this is a point
worth consideration.
So there it is for what it's worth—one reason,
if not the main reason, why campus dances
have had smaller attendance than when there
were 3,000 students at Stanford.
Is there something that could be done
about it, or will this situation prevail until the
veterans are gone? What do you think?—
