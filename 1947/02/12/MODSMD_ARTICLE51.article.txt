## HISTORY 1947 
### 
Life is hard in Britain these days. Coal is short,
power is short, and factories are closing; housing is
short, food is short, and most of their production of
consumer goods is reserved for export. It should
hardly be necessary to recall, even to the Stanford
reader, that the British, upon the surrender of the
Axis, proceeded deliberately to the enactment of a
revolution. With a tree hand, the Labor government
has nationalized the Bank of England, transportation,
and coal mines, and has proposed to regulate strictly
the use of land. Wartime economic controls, regulat
ing production, consumption, and trade, have been
retained. Additional social security measures have
been provided. It seems clear that the final aim of
the present government there and their supporters is
toward an economy whose principal operations shall
be government-planned.
Apparently the people, the common people, if
you prefer the phrase, came out of the war that
their "blood, sweat, toil, and tears" had won for
Britain convinced that their system or society was
not satisfactory and determined to remake it in the
interests of the majority. Beyond that, there was
linn determination to maintain Britain's international
position both in trade and politics. All this was in
the face of the devastation of war and of the prob
lems of converting their production from war pur
poses to those o! peace. This has been complicated
again, in recent months, by poor crops and bitter
weather.
So tar. these problems have not been surmounted.
The program has not paid off. And today's crisis has
raised again the question, should Britain continue on

this basis? Churchill has said that these difficulties
are only the beginning; that continued applications
of Socialism and mismanagement can lead only to
worse, not better, days. Attlee has told the people
to hold on and hold together a little longer; that these
are but transitory difficulties.
It is not for me to tell a great people how to man
age their affairs. But consider this: never before has
a modern industrial state adopted a permanent pro
gram like this, peacefully, by statute, after full de
bate. with civil liberties undisturbed. No mobs, no
heads on pikes, no storm-troopers, no OGPU! Look
at it as a.scientific experiment, from the results of
which all the world may profit. If Britain can es
tablish a planned economy in a democratic state,
they will have answered a most pressing question.
If they give up their attempt now. that question is
still moot.
There are bound to be some who will interpret
this to mean that I favor the introduction of such
measures in the United States. No such thing! This
is not Britain; we are faced neither by the same
situation nor by the same terrain, nor are our prob
lems of the same intense nature. We have a working
system that, appears to satisfy most of our people. If
the day ever comes, however, when America de
mands such action, the experiences of Britain may
serve us as a useful guide, either to the same ob
jectives or to what may be newer and better ones
of our own.
We have seen how revolutions, Red and Black,
deal with the problems of the modern world, and
we have suffered from the results. I>ot us now learn
how a democratic nation remakes itself.
