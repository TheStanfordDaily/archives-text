To the Editor:
A plan to which your paper has given much at
tention in the past few weeks is that of sending
Stanford students abroad this summer, ostensibly to
observe conditions in foreign countries and to re
port said conditions to the student body next fall In
light of the fallacies and inadequacies of this plan,
as proposed by the committee in charge of arrange
ments and set forth in the Daily, I should like to
go on record as considering it ill-conceived and de
void of possibilities for fruitful results.
Bringing an internationalistic awareness to stu
dents is a worthy ambition, and it need not be
expounded here that the United States can never
again safely retreat into fhe fortress of isolationism.
Grunted, also, that this fact must be brought home
with force to those who in the near future will de
termine the course of world events as the more en
lightened of our citizens. But. will this proposed
wasting of A.S.S.U. funds bring us any nearer to
that goal? A moment's reflection will, I am sure,
convince us that it will not!
Supposing that Farm students do go abroad this
summer. Exactly what will the school gain from
that rather expensive jaunt? It must be admitted
that the particular students chosen will benefit and
that the trip will be of great personal value. And
why not. Most of us would welcome the oppor
-1 unity of having an expense-paid tour as a civilian.
Were I planning on returning next fall I am sure I
would have applied.
Now. supposing again that our "rough" has
reached his particular destination. Here another dif
ficulty presents itself. How much, actually, will he
be allowed to see of that country that its national
istic government does not want him to see? Exactly
nothing, and having no grounds on which to base
comparisons, ho hasn't been there before, of how
much value will those primed impressions be? Spain
is a case in point.
However, the greatest error in the scheme will
only be evidenced with the advent of the fall quar
ter. Feature stories in the Daily, general assem
blies of empty seats, talks to small groups such as
the"I" Club, and then our travelers will be relc-

gated to oblivion along with any valuable impres
sions that they did manage to bring back. All in all,
a minute fraction of the student body will be ex
posed to this exalted plan to internationalize student
thinking.
The plain truth remains th;it Stanford students
do not want to burden their minds with thoughts of
starvation and privation abroad. After all. it wasn't
a majority idea in the first place.
Wouldn't it be simpler, and wiser, to take advan
tage of the many opportunities presently available to
learn what really is going on in Europe? The press
and news services with their many capable re
porters, lecturers such as Dr. Brandt, radio with its
first-class overseas broadcasts and commentators,
foreign students now on the campus, and the books
and programs of such able journalists as Norman
Corwin and Eric Sevareid, all of whom, it must be
admitted, are far better qualified to report on con
ditions than a student on a paid vacation.
It appears that that self-perpetuating political
machine masquerading under the title of "the stu
dent government" has foisted another one off onto
the students in its rush to get publicity and spend
someone else's money. This is not to say that most
ol the students who are actually doing the work in
volved in the idea are not sincere in their efforts.
A brief acquaintanceship with one such person
(may I add, far too brief, as she is one of the most
attractive creatures on the campus) has convinced
me that anyone who believed to the contrary would
be wrong; although that person's best reason when
asked specifically why students were going to be sent
abroad was that Harvard, Yale and other Eastern
schools were doing it.
One further suggestion: if our future Richard
Halliburtons stayed at home, the money saved could
be used to ransom from the University the articles
confiscated from Toyon during the vacation or for
any number of purposes that would benefit all the
student body.
Hoping that you will make this aspect of the
plan available for student consideration and will
forward this to the committee making arrangements
ofr the trips, 1 remain,

foreign students now on the campus, and the books

me that anyone who believed to the contrary would

abroad was that Harvard, Yale and other Eastern

be used to ransom from the University the articles

To the Editor:
A plan to which your paper has given much at
tention in the past few weeks is that of sending
Stanford students abroad this summer, ostensibly to
observe conditions in foreign countries and to re
port said conditions to the student body next fall In
light of the fallacies and inadequacies of this plan,
as proposed by the committee in charge of arrange
ments and set forth in the Daily, I should like to
go on record as considering it ill-conceived and de
void of possibilities for fruitful results.
Bringing an internationalistic awareness to stu
dents is a worthy ambition, and it need not be
expounded here that the United States can never
again safely retreat into fhe fortress of isolationism.
Grunted, also, that this fact must be brought home
with force to those who in the near future will de
termine the course of world events as the more en
lightened of our citizens. But. will this proposed
wasting of A.S.S.U. funds bring us any nearer to
that goal? A moment's reflection will, I am sure,
convince us that it will not!
Supposing that Farm students do go abroad this
summer. Exactly what will the school gain from
that rather expensive jaunt? It must be admitted
that the particular students chosen will benefit and
that the trip will be of great personal value. And
why not. Most of us would welcome the oppor
-1 unity of having an expense-paid tour as a civilian.
Were I planning on returning next fall I am sure I
would have applied.
Now. supposing again that our "rough" has
reached his particular destination. Here another dif
ficulty presents itself. How much, actually, will he
be allowed to see of that country that its national
istic government does not want him to see? Exactly
nothing, and having no grounds on which to base
comparisons, ho hasn't been there before, of how
much value will those primed impressions be? Spain
is a case in point.
However, the greatest error in the scheme will
only be evidenced with the advent of the fall quar
ter. Feature stories in the Daily, general assem
blies of empty seats, talks to small groups such as
the"I" Club, and then our travelers will be relc-

gated to oblivion along with any valuable impres
sions that they did manage to bring back. All in all,
a minute fraction of the student body will be ex
posed to this exalted plan to internationalize student
thinking.
The plain truth remains th;it Stanford students
do not want to burden their minds with thoughts of
starvation and privation abroad. After all. it wasn't
a majority idea in the first place.
Wouldn't it be simpler, and wiser, to take advan
tage of the many opportunities presently available to
