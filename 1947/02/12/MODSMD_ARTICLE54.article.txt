# Effective World Control Of Atom Could End Wars
## 
### 
Eighteen months after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and still there is no
world control of atomic energy. Why? Can't we see the horrors of an atomic war? Don't wo know
there is no practical military defense of the bomb nor can there be? What have we been doing
to prevent the occurrence of such a war? What are the prospects for the future?

First, let's see what lias been (lone.
On October 3, 11)45, President Tru-|
J man sent a message to Congress on j
. the domestic and international con
trol of atomic energy. "Civilization
demands that we shall reach at tin
earliest • possible date a satisfactory i
arrangement for the control of this !
discovery in order that it may be
come a powerful and forceful in flu -
; ence toward the maintenance of
j world peace instead of destruction." ]
On November 15. 1!)45, Presi- i
(lent Truman joined with the ;
prime ministers of Great Britain
and Canada in a comprehensive .
1 statement announcing their aims
i to prevent the use of atomic en- j
ergy for destructive purposes and
to promote the use of recent and
future advances in scientific |
knowledge, particularly in the uti- |
li/.ation of atomic energy for
pcaceful and humanitarian pur- I
poses.
On December 27, 1945, the foreign !

Development Authority, an interna
' tional agency under the U.N. to con
trol all atomic energy research and
; uses, barring mass-destruction wea
| pons.
(2) That the international agency
! make constant world-wide inspec-
J tions and completely control atomic
raw materials and supervise pro
| duction.
(3) That the international agency
I define "dangerous research" and
j control it through freedom to in
| spect developments in countries and
handle distribution of materials.
(4) That the international agency
i own and manage all primary pro
duction plants and license the use
Jof atomic energy they produce. It
j would control research in atomic
j weapons.
(5) The U.S. would then destroy
1 its stockpile of atomic bombs once
that international controls and pen
alties are fixed; then turn manufac
ture of bombs over to world agency
to forestall atomic-weapon race.
(G) The United Nations would ap
ply sanctions to punish any nation
or individual violating proposed in
i ternational regulations.
(7) The U.S. would abolish the

ministers of the ]
U.S.S.R. and the
United Kingdom
and the United
States proposed
the establishment
of a United Na
tions Atomic En
ergy Commission
(1) for extending
between all na
tions the ex
change of basic
scientific infor
mation for peace
f,,l ~.,^1

tul and humani- |
tarian ends, (2) '

\ for control of atomic energy to the j
extent necessary to insure its use ;
| for only peaceful purposes, (3) for j
the elimination from national arm- 1
aments of atomic weapons and of all j
other major weapons adapted to :
! mass destruction, and (4) for efTec- j
tive safeguards to protect comply- J
ing states against the hazards of vio- ;
I lation and evasion.
In January, 194(5, the General
Assembly of the U.N. adopted the |
resolution and the U.N. Atomic ,
Energy Commission came into be
! ing. Bernard Barueh was the U.S.
| representative to (he commission
for the first year.
j In March 194(5 the U.S. govern
i ment released for discussion a pro
posal worked out by a board of con
sultants to the State Department.
This report (titled the Acheson-
Lilienthal report, must reading for
i Stanford students along with an ar
ticle in the Aug. 17, 194(5, issue of
I the New Yorker showing how the
] conclusions were reached) was a
preliminary study of the interna
tional control of atomic energy.
INTERNATIONAL AGENCY
The essence of this report is that 1
security from atomic bombs can |
; only be obtained through a positive |
program for international develop
; ment and control of atomic energy.
They propose an international ag- i
j ency to conduct all the dangerous
i operations connected with the pro-
I duction of atomic energy, with indi
| vidual nations and citizens free to
conduct under license and with a
minimum of inspection, all noil- j
dangerous activities. This Atomic j
! Development Authority would have :
; the dual purpose of promoting the j
; beneficial use of atomic energy and j
of preventing its use for destructive !
j ends.
On June 14. 191(5. Mr. Bnruch i
outlined the U.S. Atomic Energy !
proposals to the U.N. Commission
which closely paralleled the Ache
son-Lilienthal report. On Decem
ber 5. 194(5. Barueh submitted of
the findings and recommendations
on atomic energy control to he
submitted to the Security Council.
The proposals were accepted by
the commission, (lie Soviet Union
and Poland not voting. At present
the Security Council is debating
these recommendations, which are
United States proposals:
The U.S. proposes: (1) an Atomic

| veto power «»n the theory that no
nation should have the authority to
block punishment of countries vio
| lating controls on atomic research
and production.
DISPUTE ATOM CONTROL
The United States government be
' lieves that an effective, enforceable
j system of international control of
I atomic energy is the best assurance
j of peace for ourselves and the rest
jof the world. The Russians believe
j that such control would interfere
j with their sovereignty and they
j want to know about the atomic
I bombs we are now making. The
' U.S. policy is, however, that atomic
I secrets cannot be disclosed without
j satisfactory safeguards.
The prospect for the future is that
j agreement on atomic control will be
: reached this year but it will be the
, end of 1948 before international con
! trol of atomic energy will start. As
Baruch said to the commission: "The
l stakes are greater than ever before
; offered mankind—peace and secur
; ity. For who can doubt, if we suc-
I ceed in controlling the atomic wea
} pon, that we can go on to the control
j of other weapons of mass destruc-
I tion. The elimination of war itself
is within the range of possibility. . . .
! Let us delay no longer."
