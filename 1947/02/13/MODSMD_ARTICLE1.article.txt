House representatives must bring
a list of all pledges to a meeting of |
all interfraternity .representatives j

see that they have pledged no one I
that is minus," said Howe. He em- !
phiisi/ed that all pledges must be !
plus zero or better to be eligible to I
join a fraternity.
"Pledges will be dropped from the i
Interfraternity Council records if a
check reveals a man is minus,"
warned Howe.
Men signed as pledges to indi
vidual houses will meet in the
lower lounge of the Women's Club
house at !3 Saturday morning. Six
council members will handle the
pledging. New Greeks will be ini
