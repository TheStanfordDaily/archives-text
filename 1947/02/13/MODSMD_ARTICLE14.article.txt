LONDON. Feb. 12 (UP).—Drastic
electric power cuts were extended
to all of Great Britain tonight, and
the government warned that do- I
mestic consumers who defied ra- I
i
tioning would be prosecuted under I
wartime defense regulations.
Penalties ranging up to two years i
in prison and $2,000 fine were pre- j
scribed.
Fuel Minister Emanuel Shinwell I
ordered all domestic gas rcfrigera- |
tors turned off, banned use of gas [
for heating water when solid fuel
is available, and appealed to all I
consumers to use gas sparingly even
for cooking, because coal stocks at
gas works were low.
It was estimated that the govern- i
ment might soon have to cut gas I
supplies as well as electric power to |
private users.
The coal shortage which caused
the cuts had thrown more than 5,-
000,000 persons out of work. Bliz
zard conditions continued over great
areas. The life of every man, wom
an, and child in these islands was
now affected.
Calling the situation "critically
dangerous," the alarmed govern
ment set up an emergency joint
committee of cabinet members and
coal, electricity and railroad exec
utives as a general ,staff, mandated
to "work with the same speed and
urgency as in a military operation
during the war."
