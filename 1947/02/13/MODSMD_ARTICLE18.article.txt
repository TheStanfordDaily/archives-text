# GOP Opposes Lilienthal's Appointment

### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12 (UP).
A now demand for David E. Lilien
thal's immediate removal from the
Atomic Energy Commission came
from a Senate Republican today as
the Senate chose sides for what
promised to be a close and bitter
floor fight over his appointment.
Simultaneously, Congress and the
public were warned sharply by
Warren R. Austin, chief U.S. dele
gate to the United Nations, against
becoming "hysterical" because there
is no known defense against a sud
den atomic attack on this countries
crowded industrial cities.
David E. Lilienthal paid a sur
prise visit, to the White House late
yesterday, which has led to specu
lation that in the face of snowball
ing opposition to his appointment, he
may have discussed the possibility
of his asking President Truman to
withdraw his nomination. He did
not see the President at that time,
however.
The latest an ti- Li lien thai maneu
ver came from Sen. E. H. Moore, R.,
Okla. He called on President Tru
man to withdraw the nomination
and name a less controversial figure
for the vital chairmanship of the
Atomic Energy Commission.
