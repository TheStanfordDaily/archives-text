# Student Recital Well Received
## 
### 
Carolyn Siefert, pianist, and Ver
non M. Walker, bass, proved last
night that music need not bo im
ported to Stanford to be good. The
two artists were presented in recital
at the Women's Clubhouse by the
Music Council.
Miss Siefert s selections were rich
in melody and harmony. Haydn's
unusually romantic Sonata No. 1.
the dramatic "Chapelle do (iuil
launx Tell" by Liszt, Ravel's haunt
ing "Menuet," RacbmaninofT's com
manding "Polichinelle" suited ad
mirably her depth of tone.
Mi'. Walker's songs, "Invietus," by
I lei! 111, "Asleep in the Deep." by Pc
trie, "Water Boy", and "Old Man
River," gave him ample chance to
use his deep resonant voice.
Both performers gained confi
dence and musical expressiveness
after the first numbers, and the pro
gram was a good one, with high mo
ments that were almost inspiring.â€”
