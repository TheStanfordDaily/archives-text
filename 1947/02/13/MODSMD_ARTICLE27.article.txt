To expedite transportation for students
hitch-hiking from campus to the Village or
Palo Alto, Cardinals may erect "destination
signs" at the corner of Palm Drive and the
oval.
In last Monday's Campus Opinion, attention
was called to the confusion arising when mo
torists stopped to pick up hitchhikers, only to
learn that destinations were dissimilar.
During the lunch hour and 5 o'clock rush
this confusion has resulted in a traffic haz
ard.
Nancy Banning, Cardinals president, will
present the sign-suggestion to the organization
in Tuesday night's meeting. In the mean
while, she urges all interested students with

a flair for sign painting to contact hor at Cub
berly Hall.
The signs, several feet apart, would be la
beled "The Village" and "Palo Alto." Hitch
hikers would stand near the sign of their desti
nation.
We believe that this simple idea may
mean the end to a lot of recent hard feelings
among accommodating drivers and frustrat
ed riders.
In addition, the signs would drive home to
the almost one in every two students who has
a car on campus the share-your-car tradition
dating back to the Stanley Steamer.
Traditions-conscious Cardinals are the ideal
people to finance (a few dollars) this idea.
