# BULL SESSION
## 
### CARL HEINTZ 
Hack in the days before the war, which is largely
the subject of this essay this morning, there were a
lot of Bull Sessioners (whatever that designation
may mean) who didn't write for laughs. One such,
for example, was Bud Ames who wrote a long and
learned investigation of sex magazines. Look it up
sometime; it was very good.
Another was Cheslie Saroyan, who is William
Saroyan's cousin (how many times removed I can't
say). He wrote a long article about studying Shake
speare out in the fields behind the lake and ended
up with a quote that used to be classic around the
Quad: "How now, brown cow?" There is some mes
sage of great social significance present in those
words, I'm sure.
So, you see, I've got a precedent for being serious.
It is pretty hard now to remember just what
things were like before Dec. 7, 1941. College students
in those days were quite a bit different. If you had
been told that two years from that day you would
be spending Christmas on a troop train clanking
across Nevada on the way to the Pacific, or that the
Christmas of 1944 you would celebrate flat on your
stomach in the snowy Belgian woods, the chances
are you would have got a big laugh out of it.
Back in those days everyone had a social con

science. They worried about "the third of a nation"
which was "ill-c;lothed, ill-housed, and ill-fed." The
University of California had half of its Excom mem
bers in the Young Communist League. They used
to hold "Peace Day Rallies" down at Sather Gate, and
Stanford went so far as to recognize this movement.
Back at Princeton, I think it was, someone organized
a "Veterans of Future Wars." The slogan of the
Young Communist League was "The Yanks are not
coming!" With an exclamation mark. yet.
Well, it all seems a long way oil now. All the
arguments about Intervention vs. Non-intervention
kept everyone occupied until the Japs solved the
whole argument by removing most of us from the
Ivory Tower.
Now we have a lot of guys here who saw a lot of
the civilized and uncivilized world, who saw not one
third of a nation but whole countries and continents
"ill-clothed, ill-housed, and ill-fed.''
A lot of Stanford people won't come back any
more, and a lot of the beautiful dreams about Paris,
Rome, and Spain, and lovely islands of the South
Seas, are gone for a long time.
Things are easier to see and understand when
the distance is taken away.
You couldn't sell a "Peace Day" on the Quad for
one occupation mark today.
