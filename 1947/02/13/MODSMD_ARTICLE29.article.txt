# CAMPUS OPINION

To the Editor:
Admitting for the moment that I don't know a
thing about the Constitution of the A.S.S.U. or about
tlie workings of either Excom or the Election Com
mittee, it is nevertheless quite apparent from the
"Election Bliss" article in a recent paper that the
election which polled a record, turn-out vote of nine
in every 40 students is now completely invalid!
The withdrawing of the amendment which made
the election possible certainly leaves us where we
were before the amendment was passed, and if the
only reason for the amendment was to make the
election possible on such short notice, and without
the constitutionally required one month's waiting
period, certainly it can no longer be valid! How in
heck can an unconstitutional election be upheld as
"in the spirit of the constitution"?
Did our most esteemed members, you, your hon
ors, of Excom, ever stop to think that just possibly
there is a good reason behind having such a pro
vision in the constitution or the by-laws? Is there
not more to this "technicality" raised by Tom Elke
than a mere "technicality"? Did the Daily give the
situation any consideration before jumping astride
the politician pony?
Personally, I had a free hour on election day and
stood dangerously close to one of the more "favor
ably located" ballot boxes (which I helped distribute
earlier) to sec if the voting public was as ignorant of
the relative merits of the candidates as I was. I had
never had an opportunity to see any of the candidates
in action at a time when I was cognizant of their
possibilities of running for the office. Apparently,
neither had anyone else.
There was only one person whom I observed that
marked his ballot without wondering for a time what
and who he should vote lor; let alone the six out of
10 who asked each other about the candidates and
then ended up by marking th<- ballot in a symmetrical
fashion, pleasing to the eye! Yes. I voted for numbers
2. 4 and G; they looked as good as any others. Darned
it I know who they were. Hope they were elected!
Gordon Ness, Election Board head, you say, stated,
"We used the facilities of KSU (I sure can't get it up
the How), the Daily (wherein, dear editor, did you
ever propound the relative merits of the different
candidates?), posters (all I saw just reminded me to
vote, not for whom to vote), and had candidates
speak before living groups (boy, they sure missed
mine)."
Yours for more time between nomination and
election!

To the Editor:
Treatises on the whys and wherefores of student
government and the current apathy seem to be in
order. In her letter. Miss Chasson severely criticizes
the attitudes of Mi'. Heffner and Mr. Bashkov. These
gentlemen, I believe, took rather a realistic and pos
sibly defeatist view of student activities. Miss Chas
son grudgingly offered to permit them to think such
things but they mustn't say them. They must keep
their "radical ideas" to themselves.
Do you mean. Miss Chasson. that merely because
we live on the Farm we must emulate the ostrich?

Am I to assume you advocate the suppression of all j
crime stories too? Are Stanford students too im- j
pressionable, "innocent, well-adjusted Americans" to
find out what really goes on outside the campus or ;
even in the minds of fellow students? Do you mean 1
that we are so "well-adjusted" that we can't stand j
the expression of an opinion contrary to ours?
I would rather assume that the opinions of I
Messrs. Heffner and Bashkov have been duly weighed j
by well-balanced student minds and that the mere
expression of non-conformist ideas has not rent asun
der Stanford student government or traditions, nor
permanently warped thinking on the Farm.
"We Americans like our democracy," you say.
Right you are! And democracy assumes an enlight
ened individual who makes his own decisions and !
is free to express his opinions. You advocate the pro
tection of the "innocent, well-adjusted Americans"
on this campus from the insidious thoughts of people j
like Heffner and Bashkov.
To do this would be an admission of democracy's j
failure—an admission that Stanford students cannot j
think for themselves but are will-o'-the-wisps whose {
reading and listening must be supervised by more |
foresighted newspaper editors and radio executives. !
Suppression of "allegedly subversive opinions is a j
step away from democracy rather than toward it,
and can scarcely cure student apathy.
No, Miss Chasson, if college traditions and spirit \
really have substance they will not crumble in the j
face of a few vitriolic blasts. By all means let's head !
all sides of a question—even the ones "too danger- i
ous" to print. I can't tell if an opinion is valueless 1
until I've heard it!

To the Editor:
Just as in the question of how to organize for
better international unity, we on the Stanford cam
pus seem to have lost sight of the bigger aim on the j
question of a War Memorial vs. a New Union.
The object is a better, bigger and more integrated j
campus and the problem is money. That brings us j
to this resolve: build first the thing which will bring !
the most return. Although a larger Cellar would I
bring a larger return, all the profits from the present
Cellar are directed to the fund to pay for the Audi
torium, and this would probably remain the case
with a new Cellar.
This leaves a new Pavilion. And a fitting memo
rial in many ways. Furthermore, with a seating ca
pacity of 4,000. 5,000 or larger, people would be able '
to enjoy all of the sporting events offered, student !
body cards would be good, and stimulus for better '
athletes and bigger sporting events would be there. \
The one stipulation would be this: that a certain j
percentage of all funds collected, whether the event !
be a dance, paying assembly, or athletic event, be j
allotted to a fund for a new Union. And that this
Union be built as soon as enough funds are col- j
lccted.
And don't forget that a Cellar and coke bar could
be installed in a Pavilion to complement the one al
ready in existence until such time as the new Union
could be built.
