# Sightless Coed Takes Class Notes in Braille
## 
### MARY KRAFT 
"Doris Marie Carr, graduate student in Spanish, is how the Bawlout
lists her. But this scarcely begins to tell her story, ior Doris has been
blind since she was six.
Doris graduated from Missouri State College last year fourth in her
class, the first blind student to attend the college. She now holds two

scholarships—the Switzer and an- (
other from the American Founda
tion for the Blind.
TAKES BRAILLE NOTES
Doris takes class notes in Braille,
and handles written examinations
by taking a portable typewriter to
class. She types the answers after
the questions have been read to her
by another student.
Her biggest problem, she says, is ,
to get student readers to read class
material to her. This is especially
difficult iii her case, since her Span
ish major requires readers who
know the language well.
USES CANE IN TRAFFIC
Other students aid her to and
from class and around Quad, but :
she can find her way alone. She !
carries a white cane, but only be
cause campus authorities deem u
necessary for her safety in traHic.
Dons uses her summer vacations ;
both for employment and travel.
Last summer she worked as a dic
taphone operator in a Portland, Ore., j
insurance firm.
I'LANS COSTA RICAN JOB
Once she has added a final polish
to her Spanish by living and teach
ing in Costa Rica, Doris plans to
return to school and work toward
her Ph.D. and a college teaching
job.
Doris says that she has little diffi
culty with the ordinary routine of
campus life. She lives at Elm Cot
tage, which is but a short walk from
the Romanic Languages Department
where she has most of her classes.
SWIMMING HER FAVORITE
As for sports, her favorite is j
swimming, with hiking a close sec
ond. She swims side stroke and

crawl and has even done a little
diving. She is a regular attendant
at campus sports events and an
avid football fan.
Doris laughingly says that her
main trouble is finding boys tall
enough to dance with her, as she is
five feet 10 inches tall.
BLINDED BY STICK
Doris, now 21, has been blind ever
since she was struck in the eye by
the stick of a playmate, and can
only distinguish light from dark.
She refuses to be discouraged by
her handicap, saying:
'I just refuse to let anything
stump me, and keep trying until I
find a way to do it."

stump me, and keep trying until I
find a way to do it."
"Doris Marie Carr, graduate student in Spanish, is how the Bawlout
lists her. But this scarcely begins to tell her story, ior Doris has been
blind since she was six.
Doris graduated from Missouri State College last year fourth in her
class, the first blind student to attend the college. She now holds two

scholarships—the Switzer and an- (
other from the American Founda
tion for the Blind.
TAKES BRAILLE NOTES
Doris takes class notes in Braille,
and handles written examinations
by taking a portable typewriter to
class. She types the answers after
the questions have been read to her
by another student.
Her biggest problem, she says, is ,
to get student readers to read class
material to her. This is especially
difficult iii her case, since her Span
ish major requires readers who
know the language well.
USES CANE IN TRAFFIC
Other students aid her to and
from class and around Quad, but :
she can find her way alone. She !
carries a white cane, but only be
cause campus authorities deem u
necessary for her safety in traHic.
Dons uses her summer vacations ;
both for employment and travel.
Last summer she worked as a dic
taphone operator in a Portland, Ore., j
insurance firm.
I'LANS COSTA RICAN JOB
Once she has added a final polish
to her Spanish by living and teach
ing in Costa Rica, Doris plans to
return to school and work toward
her Ph.D. and a college teaching
job.
Doris says that she has little diffi
culty with the ordinary routine of
campus life. She lives at Elm Cot
tage, which is but a short walk from
the Romanic Languages Department
where she has most of her classes.
SWIMMING HER FAVORITE
As for sports, her favorite is j
swimming, with hiking a close sec
ond. She swims side stroke and

crawl and has even done a little
diving. She is a regular attendant
at campus sports events and an
avid football fan.
Doris laughingly says that her
main trouble is finding boys tall
enough to dance with her, as she is
five feet 10 inches tall.
BLINDED BY STICK
Doris, now 21, has been blind ever
since she was struck in the eye by
the stick of a playmate, and can
only distinguish light from dark.
She refuses to be discouraged by
her handicap, saying:
'I just refuse to let anything
stump me, and keep trying until I
find a way to do it."
