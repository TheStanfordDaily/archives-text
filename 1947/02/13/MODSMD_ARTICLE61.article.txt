In the lead of today's basketball article there is something about tickets
being sold for the USC games this week-end. It seems that there are
around (500 seats lef'l for Friday and about 800 seats left for Saturday night.
What we are trying to figure out is why.
We realize that there are a number of dances being held and that
preference dinners are being served, hut even so we can't quite under
stand how Stanford, with a student body of over 7,00(1, cannot fill a pa
vilion that can hold only I!, 000 students, very crowded students at that.
A situation like that would be hard enough to understand if Stanford
were playing some jerkwater school, but when the opponent happens to be
USC, there just is no plausible answer. Possibly those that aren't going to
the dances are studying, or perhaps they are sitting at home and wishing
they were going, or perhaps they don't know that Stanford is playing.
Whatever the reason, the pavilion still remains comparatively empty.
I lie worst part ol this is that during the war Stanford discontinued
intercollegiate athletics, and hardly a day passed that some students
didn't hemoau (he fact and try to get Stanford back into athletics. Fin
alls. we did resume sports. We had a football team that did better than
even tln* most ardent rooter hoped for, and now we have a basketball
team that, according to the Dunkel system, is the tenth best team in the
Far West, and that has topped such schools as Santa Clara, UCLA, and
IS( With a team like that it is hard to believe that students won't
attend the games because the squad isn't worth watching. Anyone that
sav\ (he games last week down South would attest to the fact that seldom
has basketball been more thrilling.
No, we still can't find a reason for the lack of attendance. Our hope
i- that those without tickets thought that all seats were t>one after the
first day ol sales and didn't even try to get those colored ducats. In other
words, we still have hopes that the pavilion will be full and that the team
will net the backing that they deserve.
STANFORD Wl I F REPRESENTED ON BITTNERS
When the Oakland Bittners defeated the Phillips Oilers the other night
at Oakland, the three top stars on the Bittners were ex-Stanlord menâ€”
Jim Pollard, Don Durness, and Don Williams. Ever since Pollard got out
ol high school he has been hailed as the second Hank Luisetti, and each
year he has come nearer to that distinction. In fact, Grantland Rice named
him as the outstanding amateur basketball player in the U.S. Currently
la- is the leading scorer in the A.B.L.
Teammate Burness. Co-captain of the 1!I42 Stanford Intercollegiate
( humpions, continues to be one of the slickest guards in basketball.
Burness. who has been playing basketball since I!):!!). is having one of his
most successful seasons. In I!) 42 he was chosen on the all-American team.
Although Williams has been a substitute most of the season, he came
info his own against the Oilers, scoring thirteen points and playing a good
delensive game as well. This was no surprise to those Stanfordites who
remember the 1941 season when Williams, along with Burness and Fordy
Anderson, led the Cardinals to a championship. Williams was one of the
lop scorers on the Coast, making 102 points and placing on the All-Coast
Five. Burness, then playing center, was also All-Coast and scored 122
{joints to place second in total scoring behind UCLA's Jackie Robinson.
Although this is about the Stanford men on the Bittners, we still can't
neglect Ilowie Dallmar, great guard of the 1942 team, who was chosen as
an All-American while playing for Penn and is now considered to be
one ol basketballs greatest. Dallmar is almost as popular as Luisetti in
New York and the Last Coast, for it was Dallmar who was instrumental
in defeating an undefeated West Point team, and it was Dallmar. who, while
playing for the Philadelphia Warriors, led in assists until an ankle injury
benched him.
Not a bad reputation, considering. . . .
