# Beware Trojans!
## 
### 
USC were shown to the squad, and <
; errors in technique and style were ,
j pointed out.
The boys from Troy who put the j
crusher to Stanford last Saturday j
evening, after bowing on Friday,
I are bringing up from the southland
[ the tightest man-to-man defense j
I seen in these parts. A scrappy style i
I of play, tied in with the tight de- |
j fense gives the spectators a run for
j their shekels, and the opposition, a j
| nice complicated forty-minute prob- !
| lein to dwell over.
HANNUM; OFF OR ON
Hannum is the word for the Tro- \
[ jan attack. When the 6 foot (J center j
| is on, the Figueroa Street offense is j
potent. The Trojan squad works j
the ball into the slot, and then Han- !
num either wheels in for a hook i
i shot try, or passes the casaba out
to the horn where one of the pop |
j shot experts lets fly.
Steve Stephenson, the 6 foot 4 i
Indian center will he the key to
the Stanford fortunes. If Steve
can hold annum down and harry
his passing, the Red Machine will
be in a good position to walk off
with the series, three games («» j
one.
The Friday night festivities will '
j get off to a 6:15 flying start, as the i
; Stanford Jayvee and B fives lock i
horns. The Varsity tipoff is set for 8. j


CAPTAIN OF THE STANFORD
Varsity and one (if its outstanding
stars, Dave Davidson, who has re
covered from his illness and will
lead the team against USC tomor
row night. Dave expeets to make
up for the time he lost last week
down in Trojan territory.
