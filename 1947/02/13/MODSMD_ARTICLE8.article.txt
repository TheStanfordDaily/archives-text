LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Eeb. 12
(UP). â€” The United Nations Secu
rity Council, overruling Soviet ob
jections, voted tentatively tonight to
set up an 11-member disarmament
commission along lines proposed by
the United States.
The new commission would be
confined to planning the junking of
"conventional" weapons. All "mass
destruction" weapons would be
handled by the already-established
U.N. Atomic Energy Commission,
The Council, considering a gen
eral disarmament resolution, voted
!) to 0 for the controversial section,
splitting the duties of the two com
missions. Russia and Poland ab
stained from voting. Russia object
ed to dividing the authority, but
nobody professed opposition to the
disarmament commission itself.
The Soviet - American clash had
delayed disarmament discussions
more than six weeks.
The disarmament resolution re
mained to l>e voted upon as a whole,
and the Council still needed to rule
whether the resolution would be
subject to veto by any of the Big
Five powers. If the Council decides
that the matter is "substantive"
rather than "procedural," the reso
lution could be vetoed.
