LAKE SUCCESS, N. Y„ Feb.
13 (UP). — The United Nations
Security Council tonight set up
an 11-nation disarmament com
mission and simultaneously or
dered the Big Five to speed
plans for establishing an inter
national "police forcd."
Tin* Council immediately plunged
into debate on (lie American propo
sal for international control of atomic
energy, but adjourned until tomor
row after opening arguments by
' Canada. Gen. A. G. L. McNaughton
I of Canada urged that, the plan . . .
j calling for an inspection of all the
, world to guard against illegal atomic
| activities be adopted "with the great
; est possible speed."
The Council adopted, 10 to 0, a
I disarmament resolution which had
! been hammered out in more than six
weeks of wrangling. Andrei A.
Gromyko of Russia abstained from
voting on the resolution as a whole
because of his objections to some of
its parts,
j The resolution:
1. Established a commission to plan
1 the junking of all "conventional'*
! weapons.
2. Specifically provides that the
i already - established atomic energy
i commission will retain jurisdiction
I over discarding the atomic bomb and
| all other weapons of "mass destrue
| lion."
3. Places all VI members of the Se-
J curity Council on the new "conven
i tional" disarmament, commission.
| The 11 members include all of the
Big Five, the United States, Russia,
i France, China, and Great Britain.
4. Required the new commission
to make a progress report within
three months. First, however, the
j commission must submit a plan of
' work to the Security Council, which
must approve or disapprove. This
j step will allow the council to divide
; "conventional" weapons from "mass
j destruction"* weapons.
