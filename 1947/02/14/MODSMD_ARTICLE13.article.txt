## 
### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 13 (UP).â€”Hen
j ry A. Wallace said yesterday that
Canada had progressed "80 per cent
t of the way" toward making atomic
j bombs, that at least three other na
tions currently are building atomic
piles, and that these facts left the
| United States "tightly clutching a
! large empty bag containing a secret
j that is no secret."
Wallace said, in an article in the
New Republic, that at least one pile
will be in operation in the Scandi
navian countries by the end of the
| year, and that France and Great Bri
i tain are building plants.
The United States can give to other
j nations "not a secret but a pledge
I to co-operate to the limit as equals
I with other nations" in a sincere at
tempt, to find world salvation," he
| said.
Wallace did not mention Russia
1 among the nations building atom
j power plants, but he said that if
I Russia, instead of Canada, were
known to be working with plutonium
) "I can imagine the panic in Amcr
i ica."
