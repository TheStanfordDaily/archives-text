### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 (UP).—President Truman today re
fused to accede Republican demands lor cuts in his fiscal 1948
budget and endorsed Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson's
warning that GOP-proposed reductions for the Armed Forces
would cause disaster.

The President told his press
fcronce that he thought the $37,500,-
000.000 budget he sent to Congress

The President spoke up as his
Democratic congressional lieutenants
began maneuvering for a compro
mise under which the Republicans
would reduce their $6,000,000,000 fig
ure to $4,000,000,000 or possibly $3,-
500,000,000.
They would consent, to this, it was
reported, if the Republicans would
forego the Army-Navy slash.
Their position became known as
Chairman Styles Bridges (H-NII)
of the Senate Appropriations Com
mittee, warned that all federal de
partments must take a cut. He
added, however, that "there is no
intent in the subcommittee report
(on the legislative budget) to en
danger national security, and the
figure set by that report will not
endanger our national security."
JUDGMENT QUESTIONED
He said the military leaders will
be given a chance to establish their
demands before the proper commit
tees. He said they are "in reality"
not talking about funds to be made
available but "arc objecting to the
fiscal judgment presented by the
subcommittee."
Although informed sources have
said that the Republicans plan a
$1,750,000,000 cut in Armed Forces
appropriations, Bridges said that
"the action of the subcommittee rep
resents no specific action with re
spect to the military expenditures"
for spending by other governmental
departments.
