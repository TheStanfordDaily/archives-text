SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 13 (UP).
-The State Chamber of Commerce
today recommended a $30,000,000,-
000 federal budget as a way of
teaching government agencies to
overcome their wartime spending
habits.
The figure as endorsed by the
group is $7,500,000,000 below that
recommended to Congress by Presi
dent Truman.
Chamber President Asa V. Call
said the lower budget for 1947
should provide both for tax reduc
tion and debt retirement. He said
the federal government now is si
phoning ofT 25 cents on every dollar
of American income in taxes, com
pared to seven cents in 1939.
Call predicted that unless federal
spending is curtailed it "merely will
prolong the threat that, ultimately,
the nation's families will have noth
ing left to spend as they wish, that
government will take over the
spending job for them."
