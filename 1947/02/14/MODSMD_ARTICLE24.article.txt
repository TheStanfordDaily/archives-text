### 
WASHINGTON. Feb, 13 (UP).â€”
A 5 per cent general increase in
rents and removal of all controls on
new housing was recommended by
Son. Albert W. Hawkes, P.. N.J.. to
day as a sure-fire way to provide
mote rental housing for veterans.
He told a Senate banking sub
committee that too many landlords
would rather sell their properties in
the present high market than try to
rent them under existing ceilings.
As a result, he said, "In too many
instances veterans have been forced
to saddle themselves with the pur
chase of an over-priced house in
order to provide a roof for their
families."
Hawkes also recommended that
the subcommittee write these land
lord-relied provisions into its pend
ing legislation:
1. Creation of "hardship" rent
ceilings which would given land
lords a "reasonable return" on their
property and permit them to
court review of unsatisfactory rent
revisions ordered by the Office of
Temporary Controls.
2. Permission for landlords to
evict undesirable tenants under state
laws. Federal Rent Administrator
Ivan Carson protested to the sub
committee that any such step might
wreck the rent control program.
