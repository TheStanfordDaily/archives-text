# 'Federation Slow To Organized Buck

### 
"The process of constructing a
world government within our life
time will take many steps and proc
esses that cannot be done with one
big step," Philip W. Buck, profes
sor of political science, said before
a meeting of Stanford Student Fed
eralists last night.
Dr. Buck pointed out how much
labor and time was involved in the
erection of the United Nations be
fore that organization could begin
functioning. "How can we expect
a woi'ld federation, then, to assume
its role in so short a time and with
so little preparation?"
U.S. IS EXAMPLE
Using the United States as an ex
ample of a federation, Dr. Buck said,
"This country began as a confeder
ation of a number of states until the
federal constitution was adopted
long after the Revolutionary War
ended.
"When the constitution was
adopted, the states realized that
they were giving up some powers
to the federal government but were
gaining interstate trade and travel
and protection, just to list a few."
U.N. BIG STEP
"In a similar way," Dr. Buck said,
"we have formed a confederation
of nations, or states, under the head
ing of the United Nations. This is
a big step toward world federation."
• "As Federalists you may refute
the United Nations for its faults, but
you should remember that it is best
to accept some kind of imperfection
rather than have nothing to work
with at all. This country, the Uni
ted Nations, and a future world fed
eration have and will come about
through a piecemeal process."
