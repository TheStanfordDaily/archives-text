### 
LONDON. Feb. 13 (UP).â€”Street
lights went out all over Great Brit
ain tonight in a blackout resembling
that of wartime. Authoritative
warnings were given that gas as
well as electricity might be cut ofT
to non-essential industry and com
merce.
The British Gas Council distrib
uted to its 1,100 gas plants emergen
cy plans for shutting off supplies to
non - essential industry and com
merce at a moment's notice if nec
essary.
Twenty-four men were known
dead or missing as the result of the
fuel crisis and the blizzards and
gales which were part of it.
Prime Minister Clement R. Attlee
told Commons that the fuel situa
tion had improved slightly, but he
went on -to say that the situation
was still critical. Dwindling coal
stocks at gas plants, Attlee said,
"give cause for anxiety."
Gloom was accentuated when the
street-light blackout became effec
tive at dusk. Throughout Great
Britain all street lights remained
out except those at intersections
and other essential points prescribed
by police. Only in the interest of
public safety were any street light.s
turned on.
The Labor Ministry put the num
ber of unemployed due to the crisis
at 2,000.000. Unofficial estimates put
the figure at 4.000,000 or more.
