# Hilgard Talks On Education
## 
### 
The uses of psychology in educa- j
lional work were discussed by Dr. j
Ernest R. Hilgard, professor of psy- j
chology and education, last night.
The tide was""Toh o Division of La
bor Between the Teacher and the
Psychologist."
He commented that a child's in- I
terests are a factor in his readiness
to learn. If the child expects to
learn to read, it will be a blow to
him if he is not taught to read.
Children can be observed in a \
laboratory as to what their personal j
goals in arithmetic might be. A J
child who has been successful in
previous tests will strive to improve, j
knowing his abilities. One who has
failed often feels, "I'm no goodâ€”l'll i
do worse next time."
Dr. Hilgard feels that experimen
tal work of this type will strengthen j
the team of psychologist, profes
sional educator, and teacher.
