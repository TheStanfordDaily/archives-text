# Boathouse Spells Spring on Farm
## 
### JOHN CAMPBELL 
With spring just around the coi -
ner and still very little water in
Lake Lagunita, more than one Stan
fordite has gone up to the Boathouse
to Rive the situation the once-over.
Several sunworshippers have sug
gested a rain dance to draw a few
more wayward clouds this way, for
nothing more catastrophic could be
imagined than Lake Lagunita with
out the lake.
For those who find Half Moon
Hay a little too cold and Carmcl a
little too expensive, the sun shines
just as brightly at the Boathouse.
On sunny afternoons greased sun
bathers fry 011 the hot decks while
playing lazy bridge or studying,
which is generally thought to be
in bad taste.
Oil-soaked shoulders, brown legs,
and more than a lew red legs,
gling in the water, gasping mermaids
thrashing their way out to the floats,
and the inevitable muscle man push
ing screaming girls into the water—
all these are a part of Boathouse so
ciety in the spring.
Of course there is always one play
ful rascal who endears himself to
the basking throng by splashing icy
water on anyone and everyone who
appears to be comfortable.
The 50 canoes stored on the Boat
house racks by the various living
groups on campus are much in de
mand although they're not hesitant
about flipping over and dunking
lolling passengers.
Highlight of the aquatic season
is the annual Junior Water Carni
val. Campus sportsters compete in
such events as the greased pole,
underwater swimming, jousting,
canoe races, and canoe filling. I'aly
stores contribute prizes which are

awarded lo 1 lie best of the elabo
rate lloats which parade before a
critical crowd lining the shores and j
swarming the lloathouse.
Last year Branner's canoes sup- I
porting a "Surrey with a Fringe on j
Top" carried off women's division j
honors, while Encina's sea dragon j
copped the men's division prize. |
Many floats are decked with spring j
flowers, but the bathing beauties are |
always the main attraction ol' the |
water-borne extravaganza.
The 1945 Carnival was climaxed
by a celebration which resulted from {
a premature announcement of the i
war's end. The audience took un- J
premeditated nose dives from the i

decks into the lake where cheering
paddlers already bobbed.
The Boathouse has been the cen
ter of springtime social life on the
Farm since li) 13, when the first
structure, then considered an arch
itectural paragon, was built as a
shcllhousc for the Stanford crew.
In those days the Frosh crew work
ed out on Lake Lag and the Var
sity at the Redwood City estuary.
Even before then, Lagunita had
been a popular swimming spot.
In 1903 a boat club was organized
to enter Stanford in Pacific Coast
rowing competition, and in 1910 Farm
women collected $350 for the con
struction of the granddaddy of our

modern lake house. Three years
later their goal was realized.
By 1938 the sheen on the shell
house had worn thin, and no one
was really grieved when at the Jun
ior Carnival one corner ol the an
tique structure collapsed, adding
several unwilling swimmers to the
festivities.
A campaign to build a new boat
house was started and, after Ex
coin approval. $8,1)410 was taken
from student funds for the con
struction. The old I.oathouse was
contributed to the Big Game bon
fire of that year, and in its place a
streamlined version, designed by
Dick Spencer, '30, took form.
The formal opening was the oc
casion of a gala celebration on
Mar. 4, 1!)."!!), and ever since, spring
and the Boathousc have been men
tioned in the same breath.
The Boathouse provides year
round living accommodations for a
crew of four lifeguards, who super
vise the recreational activities, scrape
"Cal Bear" signs off the white walls,
and play the part of the hero when
necessary, which is seldom. In recent
years two fatalities have occurred,
and this season the rescue roll lists
one small dog, and a little girl who
fell off the dock but crawled out
again before the guard could reach
her. Tu be eligible to live in the
Boathouse, the guards must have
passed the senior lifesaving test.
Among the newer additions are a
barbeque pit, a spotlight for night
swimming, and a public address sys
tem for afternoon music.
Stanford may be justly proud of
her Boathouse, for few universities ni
the country can offer a comparable
"swimmin' hole" right on campus.

was really grieved when at the Jun
ior Carnival one corner ol the an
tique structure collapsed, adding
several unwilling swimmers to the
festivities.
A campaign to build a new boat
house was started and, after Ex
coin approval. $8,1)410 was taken
from student funds for the con
struction. The old I.oathouse was
contributed to the Big Game bon
fire of that year, and in its place a
streamlined version, designed by
Dick Spencer, '30, took form.
The formal opening was the oc
casion of a gala celebration on
Mar. 4, 1!)."!!), and ever since, spring
and the Boathousc have been men
tioned in the same breath.
The Boathouse provides year
round living accommodations for a
crew of four lifeguards, who super
vise the recreational activities, scrape
"Cal Bear" signs off the white walls,
and play the part of the hero when
necessary, which is seldom. In recent
years two fatalities have occurred,
and this season the rescue roll lists
one small dog, and a little girl who
fell off the dock but crawled out
again before the guard could reach
her. Tu be eligible to live in the
Boathouse, the guards must have
passed the senior lifesaving test.
Among the newer additions are a
barbeque pit, a spotlight for night
swimming, and a public address sys
tem for afternoon music.
Stanford may be justly proud of
her Boathouse, for few universities ni
the country can offer a comparable
"swimmin' hole" right on campus.

With spring just around the coi -
ner and still very little water in
Lake Lagunita, more than one Stan
fordite has gone up to the Boathouse
to Rive the situation the once-over.
Several sunworshippers have sug
gested a rain dance to draw a few
more wayward clouds this way, for
nothing more catastrophic could be
imagined than Lake Lagunita with
out the lake.
For those who find Half Moon
Hay a little too cold and Carmcl a
little too expensive, the sun shines
just as brightly at the Boathouse.
On sunny afternoons greased sun
bathers fry 011 the hot decks while
playing lazy bridge or studying,
which is generally thought to be
in bad taste.
Oil-soaked shoulders, brown legs,
and more than a lew red legs,
gling in the water, gasping mermaids
thrashing their way out to the floats,
and the inevitable muscle man push
ing screaming girls into the water—
all these are a part of Boathouse so
ciety in the spring.
Of course there is always one play
ful rascal who endears himself to
the basking throng by splashing icy
water on anyone and everyone who
appears to be comfortable.
The 50 canoes stored on the Boat
house racks by the various living
groups on campus are much in de
mand although they're not hesitant
about flipping over and dunking
lolling passengers.
Highlight of the aquatic season
is the annual Junior Water Carni
val. Campus sportsters compete in
such events as the greased pole,
underwater swimming, jousting,
canoe races, and canoe filling. I'aly
stores contribute prizes which are

awarded lo 1 lie best of the elabo
rate lloats which parade before a
critical crowd lining the shores and j
swarming the lloathouse.
Last year Branner's canoes sup- I
porting a "Surrey with a Fringe on j
Top" carried off women's division j
honors, while Encina's sea dragon j
copped the men's division prize. |
Many floats are decked with spring j
flowers, but the bathing beauties are |
always the main attraction ol' the |
water-borne extravaganza.
The 1945 Carnival was climaxed
by a celebration which resulted from {
a premature announcement of the i
war's end. The audience took un- J
premeditated nose dives from the i

decks into the lake where cheering
paddlers already bobbed.
The Boathouse has been the cen
ter of springtime social life on the
Farm since li) 13, when the first
structure, then considered an arch

shcllhousc for the Stanford crew.
In those days the Frosh crew work
ed out on Lake Lag and the Var
sity at the Redwood City estuary.
Even before then, Lagunita had
been a popular swimming spot.
In 1903 a boat club was organized

swarming the lloathouse.

Many floats are decked with spring j

The 1945 Carnival was climaxed
by a celebration which resulted from {
a premature announcement of the i
war's end. The audience took un- J
premeditated nose dives from the i

decks into the lake where cheering
paddlers already bobbed.
The Boathouse has been the cen
ter of springtime social life on the
Farm since li) 13, when the first
structure, then considered an arch
itectural paragon, was built as a
shcllhousc for the Stanford crew.
In those days the Frosh crew work
ed out on Lake Lag and the Var
sity at the Redwood City estuary.
Even before then, Lagunita had
been a popular swimming spot.
In 1903 a boat club was organized
to enter Stanford in Pacific Coast
rowing competition, and in 1910 Farm
women collected $350 for the con
struction of the granddaddy of our

modern lake house. Three years
later their goal was realized.
By 1938 the sheen on the shell
house had worn thin, and no one
was really grieved when at the Jun
ior Carnival one corner ol the an
tique structure collapsed, adding
several unwilling swimmers to the
festivities.
A campaign to build a new boat
house was started and, after Ex
coin approval. $8,1)410 was taken
from student funds for the con
struction. The old I.oathouse was
contributed to the Big Game bon
fire of that year, and in its place a
streamlined version, designed by
Dick Spencer, '30, took form.
The formal opening was the oc
casion of a gala celebration on
Mar. 4, 1!)."!!), and ever since, spring
and the Boathousc have been men
tioned in the same breath.
The Boathouse provides year
round living accommodations for a
crew of four lifeguards, who super
vise the recreational activities, scrape
"Cal Bear" signs off the white walls,
and play the part of the hero when
necessary, which is seldom. In recent
years two fatalities have occurred,
and this season the rescue roll lists
one small dog, and a little girl who
fell off the dock but crawled out
again before the guard could reach
her. Tu be eligible to live in the
Boathouse, the guards must have
passed the senior lifesaving test.
Among the newer additions are a
barbeque pit, a spotlight for night
swimming, and a public address sys
tem for afternoon music.
Stanford may be justly proud of
her Boathouse, for few universities ni
the country can offer a comparable
"swimmin' hole" right on campus.

With spring just around the coi -
ner and still very little water in
Lake Lagunita, more than one Stan
fordite has gone up to the Boathouse
to Rive the situation the once-over.
Several sunworshippers have sug
gested a rain dance to draw a few
more wayward clouds this way, for
nothing more catastrophic could be
imagined than Lake Lagunita with
out the lake.
For those who find Half Moon
Hay a little too cold and Carmcl a
little too expensive, the sun shines
just as brightly at the Boathouse.
On sunny afternoons greased sun
bathers fry 011 the hot decks while
playing lazy bridge or studying,
which is generally thought to be
in bad taste.
Oil-soaked shoulders, brown legs,
and more than a lew red legs,
gling in the water, gasping mermaids
thrashing their way out to the floats,
and the inevitable muscle man push
ing screaming girls into the water—
all these are a part of Boathouse so
ciety in the spring.
Of course there is always one play
ful rascal who endears himself to
the basking throng by splashing icy
water on anyone and everyone who
appears to be comfortable.
The 50 canoes stored on the Boat
house racks by the various living
groups on campus are much in de
mand although they're not hesitant
about flipping over and dunking
lolling passengers.
Highlight of the aquatic season
is the annual Junior Water Carni
val. Campus sportsters compete in
such events as the greased pole,
underwater swimming, jousting,
canoe races, and canoe filling. I'aly
stores contribute prizes which are

awarded lo 1 lie best of the elabo
rate lloats which parade before a
critical crowd lining the shores and j
swarming the lloathouse.
