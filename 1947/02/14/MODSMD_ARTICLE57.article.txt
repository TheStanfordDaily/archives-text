## 
### 
A review and criticism of various ,
campus international activities was j
the subject of a speech given by Mu- ;
riel Lowe, journalism student from j
London, who addressed the Gradu
ate Women's Club luncheon yester
day in Women's Clubhouse.
"My aim is to do everything in my
power to improve international rela
tions because 1 consider this is the
only way to win the peace," Miss
Lowe said.
Slu- added. 'The first rung on (he
ladder of peace is love of man
kind. 1 discovered this after

weeks, months, and days of bomb
ings, year after year, with no
rest."
Concerning campus international
activities, Miss Lowe directed her
criticism mainly toward the ISC.
"The ISC has marvellous prospects,"
she stated.
SELECTION CRITICIZED
"I do not intend to deprive Niel
Allen, Martin Anderson, or Excom
of the credit they so richly deserve
for this idea and for the great work
they have put into it," Miss Lowe
said.
Objecting to the choice of Spain
and Greece as countries to be vis
ited, Miss Lowe emphasized the
importance of considering sending
Stanford delegates to the Oslo con
ference in Norway and the World
Youth Festival in Prague.
Miss Lowe pointed out that at
least G2 countries would be repre
sented at Prague.
COULD TALK TO DELEGATES
"If Germany and Russia are in
accessible to Stanford delegates," she
said, "these countries would un
doubtedly have delegations of their
own students at these two confer
ences.
"Stanford students could have a
field day talking to these students
and finding out what they want
for their countries and for peace,"
Miss Lowe declared.
Miss Lowe also criticized the sec
ond aim of the ISC; "to strengthen
Stanford spirit," and declared Stan
ford students should go to Europe
thinking what they could ofler in the
way of co-operation with other world
students, rather than what they
could get for themselves.
"American students have the
greatest student body in the world,
and arc in a position materially
and physically to lead the rest of
the students of the world, to help
them, and support them."
"Co-operation is the way to peace,"
she said, "and not the glory of Stan
ford. We are losing time if we lose
this opportunity to tell European
students we will help them."
Miss Lowe also outlined "Y" ac
tivities, and (he work being done for
the NSO and the Conference on In
ternational Relations, and praised
Stanford students for their interest
in world affairs.

Stanford delegates to the Oslo con
ference in Norway and the World
Youth Festival in Prague.
Miss Lowe pointed out that at
least G2 countries would be repre
sented at Prague.
COULD TALK TO DELEGATES
"If Germany and Russia are in
accessible to Stanford delegates," she
said, "these countries would un
doubtedly have delegations of their
own students at these two confer
ences.
"Stanford students could have a
field day talking to these students
and finding out what they want
for their countries and for peace,"
Miss Lowe declared.
Miss Lowe also criticized the sec
ond aim of the ISC; "to strengthen
Stanford spirit," and declared Stan
ford students should go to Europe
thinking what they could ofler in the
way of co-operation with other world
students, rather than what they
could get for themselves.
"American students have the
greatest student body in the world,
and arc in a position materially
and physically to lead the rest of
the students of the world, to help
them, and support them."
"Co-operation is the way to peace,"
she said, "and not the glory of Stan
ford. We are losing time if we lose
this opportunity to tell European
students we will help them."
Miss Lowe also outlined "Y" ac
tivities, and (he work being done for
the NSO and the Conference on In
ternational Relations, and praised
Stanford students for their interest
in world affairs.
A review and criticism of various ,
campus international activities was j
the subject of a speech given by Mu- ;
riel Lowe, journalism student from j
London, who addressed the Gradu
ate Women's Club luncheon yester
day in Women's Clubhouse.
"My aim is to do everything in my
power to improve international rela
tions because 1 consider this is the
only way to win the peace," Miss
Lowe said.
Slu- added. 'The first rung on (he
ladder of peace is love of man
kind. 1 discovered this after

weeks, months, and days of bomb
ings, year after year, with no
rest."
Concerning campus international
activities, Miss Lowe directed her
criticism mainly toward the ISC.
"The ISC has marvellous prospects,"
she stated.
SELECTION CRITICIZED
"I do not intend to deprive Niel
Allen, Martin Anderson, or Excom
of the credit they so richly deserve
for this idea and for the great work
they have put into it," Miss Lowe
said.
Objecting to the choice of Spain
and Greece as countries to be vis
ited, Miss Lowe emphasized the
importance of considering sending
Stanford delegates to the Oslo con
ference in Norway and the World
Youth Festival in Prague.
