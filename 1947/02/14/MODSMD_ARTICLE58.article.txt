"In general, employment oppor
tunities for women are good," re
ported Dr. Bush, head of the Ap
pointment Service, in the Vocom
program last night. "Unless specific
training is obtained in college, the
graduate is entering the labor mar
ket on the same standing with a
high-school graduate.
"However, a liberal education
produces the qualities that employ
ers are looking for above, everything
else, such as resourcefulness, poise,
and leadership."
According to Mrs. Marylou Me-
Clure Wilson, who got a job in the

dations gave her a feeling of confi
dence when applying for her job.

ness world.
