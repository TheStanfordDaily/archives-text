# Superb Hitchcock Movie Has Chills and Chuckles
## Secret Heart On Stanford Screen 
### 
It you can't find anything to do 1
one night this weekend, drop down \
to the Stanford and look over "The
Secret Heart." It's not a movie to
go out of your way for, but if you
do see it, the chances are you'll
enjoy it.
It's all about June Allyson, who
is a normal, healthy, psychopathic, j
morose teen-ager who would be |
about average if she weren't also j
beautiful. As it is, she and her piano |
sit around all day playing Debussy j
in memory of her dear dead father :
whom she loves passionately since
nobody ever told her he was a
thief who committed suicide half a
jump ahead of the auditors.
PSYCHO SLANT
She and her mental mellow
j drama are supposed to be the show,j
! but it gets slightly stolen by a so- j
phisticated middle-aged ain't-love- ;
I grand routine by her stepmother
(Claudette Colbert) and her father's
| best friend (Walter Pidgeon). June
I gets back at them, though, by fall -
i ing for Pidgeon herself, and then j
trying to set things right by jump- I
ing off a cliff. Mother talks her out j
ul it in the nick of time, and as soon
i as she finds a boy friend of her own j
j she gets over her psychopathic, mo- i
| rose tendencies and lives happily
| ever alter.
June Allyson is the only actress
I I've ever seen who could play a
; psycho's part as if it were an in
[ genue's—and somehow make it look
| good. She's still a breath of spring
| in Hollywood's galaxy of Indian
j summer sirens.
PI IXI EON TOO PERFECT'
j Colbert is her usual competent j
| self, and runs through this role like j
I a championship runner taking his
warmups. Pidgeon is his own suave
self, but this time he could use a
little more coffee with his sugar.
He's almost too "perfect" a gentle
man. Thoy lap that stuff up in com- j
muters' Connecticut, though, so he's !
j not out of step.
Orchids also to Robert Sterling for [
j a good job as Junie's brother back
from the Navy.
All in all it's a pretty enjoyable
j show, if you like the heavy stuff.
I And if you go to this one because
i your girl is out with your room
mate, you'll probably be in the right
I mood for it.—Page
