# 'Specter of Rose' On Twin Bill
## 
### 
Although it is an old picture,
"Night Train," now playing at the
Menlo Theater, is well worth the
price of admission if you haven't
seen it.
"Night Train" is a sort of sequel
to "The Lady Vanishes," and both
are Hitchcock masterpieces. Mr.
Hitchcock may get paid more in
Hollywood, but he never has gotten
around to putting out anything as
good, excepting "Rebecca."
"Night Train" concerns Nazi Ger
many just before the war broke out
in 1939. A British agent (Rex Har
rison) is trying to get a Czech ref
ugee out of the country, and the fact
that she happens tu be beautiful
only adds interesting complications
to the plot.
Of course, there are the Nazis who
are always just a step behind our
hero and heroine, and who chase
them up and down the length of a
speeding passenger train with all
the resultant Hitchcock thrills and
suspense.
Margaret Lockwood is the pretty
refugee, and there are also two Eng
lish cricket fans who wander about
through the train wondering who
won the matches yesterday, and
trying out golf clubs and just gen
erally getting in the way, but giving
plenty of comic relief.
Mr. Harrison and Miss Lockwood
both give excellent performances,
but the real star of the picture is
still Mr. Hitchcock, who shows his
master hand all through the picture.
If you are recovering from mid
terms and want a little relaxing
suspense and mystery, see "Night
Train." The other half of the double
bill is "Specter of the Rose," of
which many good things have also
been said. It Ls all about a mad
ballet dancer, and doubtless has
many deep psychological meanings
which I didn't get.—Heintze
