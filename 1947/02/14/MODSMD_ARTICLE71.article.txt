It May lit' a llreak for Stanford Anyhow
Because of an exceedingly weird bit of .schedule making, the Stanford
basketball team will meet the Southern California Trojans lour times in
a row. By 11 o'clock tomorrow night the boys on the respective squads will
have seen so much of each other they'll be old friends. Usually, of course,
different schools compete each weekend.
How it all came about is not quite clear to me. I know only that the
other three Southern Division schools released schedules early in the prac
tice season, schedules which kept the Indians on the road lor the entire
first half of the loop race.
The boys over at the S.A.C. were pretty close-mouthed about th<- whole
thing; they said merely that Stanford had as yet approved no Conference
basketball schedule. One would assume that, since California came down
here for one game during the second week of play, Stanford finally suc
ceeded in getting at least one small concession. We got one home game out
of the first six.
As I said, the schedule making was weird—but it may turn out to Stan
ford's advantage in the long run. The boys have finished traveling for
the year, except for one short jump to Berkeley. Five out of the next six
games will be played here on the Farm. That should give Everett Dean's
lads a slight advantage.
As for meeting El Trojan four times in a row, that has its compensations
also; El isn't so tough this year—not like he used to be, at least. The Cards
are coining along fast, and this is a critical period. It's fortunate that they
are able to play what has proved to be the Division's weakest team at this
time.
Department of lied Faces, Sports Branch
Incidentally, some of the guessperts should have red faces by now—if
they're capable of shame. They unanimously nominated the Cards for last
place in the Division. Even I couldn't stomach that, and some time ago said
1 didn't think they'd wind up the face in the cellar.
Perhaps you remember a Daily column by H. D. Thoreau just at the

start of the football season, in which he predicted (at
long range) the finishing order of the Southern Divi
sion schools in the basketball race.
Henry David said, from 'way out on his limb, that
the ranking at the end of the season would be (1)
U.C.L.A., \2) California. (3) STANFORD, and (4)
u.s.c.
Right now the Berkeley Bears are showing then
heels to the pack, but by season's end we'll all see that
young Mr. Thoreau's prophecy was inspired. The only
thing is, he was counting on Howie Dallmar to boost
the locals up that high. Shucks, if Dallmar was around
we'd be even higher.
Of course the Westwood Bruins must overtake

Berkeley before H.D. can set himself up as a seer—but 1 think they will.
The Bears, you know, play five out of their last six games on the road.
In order to insure themselves the championship beyond question, they must
split with the Bruins this weekend, then whip Stanford and U.S.C. in the
following four games. That won't be so easy.
Personally, I don't see how the Bears can possibly win more than three
of their next six games. That will wind them up with eight wins and four
losses, which won't be good enough.
They meet Ucla in Los Angeles tonight and tomorrow night; the Bruins
will win one of those, and could easily take both. It all depends on how
well His Nibs Price's boys have recovered from the three successive beat
ings they took last week from the Oakland Bittners (sometimes called the
Stanford Alumni), St. Mary's, and Santa Clara.
I )ro i, nle Shovels, Men, They Ain't Dead
You can't count Cal out definitely, though; often in the past they've
been prematurely buried, then have come back to haunt the grave-diggers.
They have a good, sound basketball team; not great, but good. They won't
pull an el foldo.
Now let's get back to Stanford. Recently Mr. Laughing Boy Farkas
wrote a piece for this paper in which he evaluated the abilities of the
Indian basketballers. He concluded they all had great potentialities which
they had not as yet reached.
Well, they still aren't as good as I think they will be in the future,
but a great improvement can be noted week by week; the boys are getting
there. They got off to a rather bad start, but if they keep getting better at
the present rate they may be as tough as any team in the league by sea
son's end.
One of the greatest weaknesses has been lack of reserve strength. Now
Bill Drehobl, Milt Iverson, and Bob Lewis have shown themselves capable
of lending yeoman aid to the first-stringers. Other players are rounding
into form, also.
Bill Stephenson doesn't look like the same player who started the
season at center for the Cards. He's still a bit awkward, but his floor play
is much better, and he's a good shot. Capt. Dave Davidson, the smoothest
of the starting quintet, is brilliant but erratic. Also, he still piles up
quite a few of those damaging persona] fouls.
But the most noteworthy rise in quality can be found in the play of
Babe Higgins. Always a smoothie on the floor, he cut loose for 32 points in
the recent Los Angeles weekend. He may be the shot in the arm the team
needs.
Open the Door, Sam, Babe"* Knoeking
He pulled a Harlem Globetrotter trick in the U.S.F. game; blocked off
by a guard, he dribbled the ball around behind himself and kept on going,
leaving a most embarrassed young man clutching at the air. The fans —all
2,700 of them—burst into a startled roar. Babe is knocking at the gates of
stardom, and may get in this week—over the recumbent forms of Sam
Barry's Trojans.
Dick Berlin, who doesn't look like a basketball player at all, has proved
himself one of the classiest guards in the Division. When he covers a man,
that gentleman's scoring average takes a drop. He doesn't shoot often him
self, but can pile up points like mad when the other boys are too closely
guarded.
That leaves Morley Thompson who, like Davidson, is erratic. But on
one of his hot nights he can't be stopped with a shotgun. He pours in the
buckets from all angles, seemingly without taking aim. As he gains ex
perience his "off" nights get farther and farther apart. The boy has some
thing that can't be bought—natural ability.
So—things look pretty rosy for the S.C. series. Stanford managed to
gain a split in Los Angeles at a time when Thompson and Davidson were
in far from good health. The team came from behind to snatch the first
game and were pulling a repeat in the second until Stephenson and David
son were tossed out of the game on personal fouls.
It's hard to see how they can keep from winning at least one of the two
games. Everett Dean has done a fine job of developing a wealth of innate
talent; he's molded it into a unit which gets better all the time. Yes, they'll
gain at least a split with S.C. Me? I think they'll take both games.

Personally, I don't see how the Bears can possibly win more than three
of their next six games. That will wind them up with eight wins and four
losses, which won't be good enough.
They meet Ucla in Los Angeles tonight and tomorrow night; the Bruins
will win one of those, and could easily take both. It all depends on how
well His Nibs Price's boys have recovered from the three successive beat
ings they took last week from the Oakland Bittners (sometimes called the
Stanford Alumni), St. Mary's, and Santa Clara.
I )ro i, nle Shovels, Men, They Ain't Dead
You can't count Cal out definitely, though; often in the past they've
been prematurely buried, then have come back to haunt the grave-diggers.
They have a good, sound basketball team; not great, but good. They won't
pull an el foldo.
Now let's get back to Stanford. Recently Mr. Laughing Boy Farkas
wrote a piece for this paper in which he evaluated the abilities of the
Indian basketballers. He concluded they all had great potentialities which
they had not as yet reached.
Well, they still aren't as good as I think they will be in the future,
but a great improvement can be noted week by week; the boys are getting
there. They got off to a rather bad start, but if they keep getting better at
the present rate they may be as tough as any team in the league by sea
son's end.
One of the greatest weaknesses has been lack of reserve strength. Now
Bill Drehobl, Milt Iverson, and Bob Lewis have shown themselves capable
of lending yeoman aid to the first-stringers. Other players are rounding
into form, also.
Bill Stephenson doesn't look like the same player who started the
season at center for the Cards. He's still a bit awkward, but his floor play
is much better, and he's a good shot. Capt. Dave Davidson, the smoothest
of the starting quintet, is brilliant but erratic. Also, he still piles up
quite a few of those damaging persona] fouls.
But the most noteworthy rise in quality can be found in the play of
Babe Higgins. Always a smoothie on the floor, he cut loose for 32 points in
the recent Los Angeles weekend. He may be the shot in the arm the team
needs.
Open the Door, Sam, Babe"* Knoeking
He pulled a Harlem Globetrotter trick in the U.S.F. game; blocked off
by a guard, he dribbled the ball around behind himself and kept on going,
leaving a most embarrassed young man clutching at the air. The fans —all
2,700 of them—burst into a startled roar. Babe is knocking at the gates of
stardom, and may get in this week—over the recumbent forms of Sam
Barry's Trojans.
Dick Berlin, who doesn't look like a basketball player at all, has proved
himself one of the classiest guards in the Division. When he covers a man,
that gentleman's scoring average takes a drop. He doesn't shoot often him
self, but can pile up points like mad when the other boys are too closely
guarded.
That leaves Morley Thompson who, like Davidson, is erratic. But on
one of his hot nights he can't be stopped with a shotgun. He pours in the
buckets from all angles, seemingly without taking aim. As he gains ex
perience his "off" nights get farther and farther apart. The boy has some
thing that can't be bought—natural ability.
So—things look pretty rosy for the S.C. series. Stanford managed to
gain a split in Los Angeles at a time when Thompson and Davidson were
in far from good health. The team came from behind to snatch the first
game and were pulling a repeat in the second until Stephenson and David
son were tossed out of the game on personal fouls.
It's hard to see how they can keep from winning at least one of the two
games. Everett Dean has done a fine job of developing a wealth of innate
talent; he's molded it into a unit which gets better all the time. Yes, they'll
gain at least a split with S.C. Me? I think they'll take both games.

It May lit' a llreak for Stanford Anyhow
Because of an exceedingly weird bit of .schedule making, the Stanford
basketball team will meet the Southern California Trojans lour times in
a row. By 11 o'clock tomorrow night the boys on the respective squads will
have seen so much of each other they'll be old friends. Usually, of course,
different schools compete each weekend.
How it all came about is not quite clear to me. I know only that the
other three Southern Division schools released schedules early in the prac
tice season, schedules which kept the Indians on the road lor the entire
first half of the loop race.
The boys over at the S.A.C. were pretty close-mouthed about th<- whole
thing; they said merely that Stanford had as yet approved no Conference
basketball schedule. One would assume that, since California came down
here for one game during the second week of play, Stanford finally suc
ceeded in getting at least one small concession. We got one home game out
of the first six.
As I said, the schedule making was weird—but it may turn out to Stan
ford's advantage in the long run. The boys have finished traveling for
the year, except for one short jump to Berkeley. Five out of the next six
games will be played here on the Farm. That should give Everett Dean's
lads a slight advantage.
As for meeting El Trojan four times in a row, that has its compensations
also; El isn't so tough this year—not like he used to be, at least. The Cards
are coining along fast, and this is a critical period. It's fortunate that they
are able to play what has proved to be the Division's weakest team at this
time.
Department of lied Faces, Sports Branch
Incidentally, some of the guessperts should have red faces by now—if
they're capable of shame. They unanimously nominated the Cards for last
place in the Division. Even I couldn't stomach that, and some time ago said
1 didn't think they'd wind up the face in the cellar.
Perhaps you remember a Daily column by H. D. Thoreau just at the

start of the football season, in which he predicted (at
long range) the finishing order of the Southern Divi
sion schools in the basketball race.
Henry David said, from 'way out on his limb, that
the ranking at the end of the season would be (1)
U.C.L.A., \2) California. (3) STANFORD, and (4)
u.s.c.
Right now the Berkeley Bears are showing then
heels to the pack, but by season's end we'll all see that
young Mr. Thoreau's prophecy was inspired. The only
thing is, he was counting on Howie Dallmar to boost
the locals up that high. Shucks, if Dallmar was around
we'd be even higher.
Of course the Westwood Bruins must overtake

Berkeley before H.D. can set himself up as a seer—but 1 think they will.
The Bears, you know, play five out of their last six games on the road.
In order to insure themselves the championship beyond question, they must
split with the Bruins this weekend, then whip Stanford and U.S.C. in the
following four games. That won't be so easy.

buckets from all angles, seemingly without taking aim. As he gains ex
perience his "off" nights get farther and farther apart. The boy has some
thing that can't be bought—natural ability.
So—things look pretty rosy for the S.C. series. Stanford managed to
gain a split in Los Angeles at a time when Thompson and Davidson were
in far from good health. The team came from behind to snatch the first
game and were pulling a repeat in the second until Stephenson and David
son were tossed out of the game on personal fouls.
It's hard to see how they can keep from winning at least one of the two
games. Everett Dean has done a fine job of developing a wealth of innate
talent; he's molded it into a unit which gets better all the time. Yes, they'll
gain at least a split with S.C. Me? I think they'll take both games.

It May lit' a llreak for Stanford Anyhow
Because of an exceedingly weird bit of .schedule making, the Stanford
basketball team will meet the Southern California Trojans lour times in
a row. By 11 o'clock tomorrow night the boys on the respective squads will
have seen so much of each other they'll be old friends. Usually, of course,
different schools compete each weekend.
How it all came about is not quite clear to me. I know only that the
other three Southern Division schools released schedules early in the prac
tice season, schedules which kept the Indians on the road lor the entire
first half of the loop race.
The boys over at the S.A.C. were pretty close-mouthed about th<- whole
thing; they said merely that Stanford had as yet approved no Conference
basketball schedule. One would assume that, since California came down
here for one game during the second week of play, Stanford finally suc
ceeded in getting at least one small concession. We got one home game out
of the first six.
As I said, the schedule making was weird—but it may turn out to Stan
ford's advantage in the long run. The boys have finished traveling for
the year, except for one short jump to Berkeley. Five out of the next six
games will be played here on the Farm. That should give Everett Dean's
lads a slight advantage.
As for meeting El Trojan four times in a row, that has its compensations
also; El isn't so tough this year—not like he used to be, at least. The Cards
are coining along fast, and this is a critical period. It's fortunate that they
are able to play what has proved to be the Division's weakest team at this
time.
Department of lied Faces, Sports Branch
Incidentally, some of the guessperts should have red faces by now—if
they're capable of shame. They unanimously nominated the Cards for last
place in the Division. Even I couldn't stomach that, and some time ago said
1 didn't think they'd wind up the face in the cellar.
Perhaps you remember a Daily column by H. D. Thoreau just at the

start of the football season, in which he predicted (at
long range) the finishing order of the Southern Divi
sion schools in the basketball race.
Henry David said, from 'way out on his limb, that
the ranking at the end of the season would be (1)
U.C.L.A., \2) California. (3) STANFORD, and (4)
u.s.c.
Right now the Berkeley Bears are showing then
heels to the pack, but by season's end we'll all see that
young Mr. Thoreau's prophecy was inspired. The only
thing is, he was counting on Howie Dallmar to boost
the locals up that high. Shucks, if Dallmar was around
we'd be even higher.
Of course the Westwood Bruins must overtake

Berkeley before H.D. can set himself up as a seer—but 1 think they will.
The Bears, you know, play five out of their last six games on the road.
In order to insure themselves the championship beyond question, they must
split with the Bruins this weekend, then whip Stanford and U.S.C. in the
following four games. That won't be so easy.
Personally, I don't see how the Bears can possibly win more than three
of their next six games. That will wind them up with eight wins and four
losses, which won't be good enough.
They meet Ucla in Los Angeles tonight and tomorrow night; the Bruins
will win one of those, and could easily take both. It all depends on how
well His Nibs Price's boys have recovered from the three successive beat
ings they took last week from the Oakland Bittners (sometimes called the
Stanford Alumni), St. Mary's, and Santa Clara.
I )ro i, nle Shovels, Men, They Ain't Dead
You can't count Cal out definitely, though; often in the past they've
been prematurely buried, then have come back to haunt the grave-diggers.
They have a good, sound basketball team; not great, but good. They won't
pull an el foldo.
Now let's get back to Stanford. Recently Mr. Laughing Boy Farkas
wrote a piece for this paper in which he evaluated the abilities of the
Indian basketballers. He concluded they all had great potentialities which
they had not as yet reached.
Well, they still aren't as good as I think they will be in the future,
but a great improvement can be noted week by week; the boys are getting
there. They got off to a rather bad start, but if they keep getting better at
the present rate they may be as tough as any team in the league by sea
son's end.
One of the greatest weaknesses has been lack of reserve strength. Now
Bill Drehobl, Milt Iverson, and Bob Lewis have shown themselves capable
of lending yeoman aid to the first-stringers. Other players are rounding
into form, also.
Bill Stephenson doesn't look like the same player who started the
season at center for the Cards. He's still a bit awkward, but his floor play
is much better, and he's a good shot. Capt. Dave Davidson, the smoothest
of the starting quintet, is brilliant but erratic. Also, he still piles up
quite a few of those damaging persona] fouls.
But the most noteworthy rise in quality can be found in the play of
Babe Higgins. Always a smoothie on the floor, he cut loose for 32 points in
the recent Los Angeles weekend. He may be the shot in the arm the team
needs.
Open the Door, Sam, Babe"* Knoeking
He pulled a Harlem Globetrotter trick in the U.S.F. game; blocked off
by a guard, he dribbled the ball around behind himself and kept on going,
leaving a most embarrassed young man clutching at the air. The fans —all
2,700 of them—burst into a startled roar. Babe is knocking at the gates of
stardom, and may get in this week—over the recumbent forms of Sam
Barry's Trojans.
Dick Berlin, who doesn't look like a basketball player at all, has proved
himself one of the classiest guards in the Division. When he covers a man,
that gentleman's scoring average takes a drop. He doesn't shoot often him
self, but can pile up points like mad when the other boys are too closely
guarded.
That leaves Morley Thompson who, like Davidson, is erratic. But on
one of his hot nights he can't be stopped with a shotgun. He pours in the

Henry David said, from 'way out on his limb, that
the ranking at the end of the season would be (1)
U.C.L.A., \2) California. (3) STANFORD, and (4)

Right now the Berkeley Bears are showing then
heels to the pack, but by season's end we'll all see that
young Mr. Thoreau's prophecy was inspired. The only
thing is, he was counting on Howie Dallmar to boost
the locals up that high. Shucks, if Dallmar was around
we'd be even higher.
Of course the Westwood Bruins must overtake

Berkeley before H.D. can set himself up as a seer—but 1 think they will.
The Bears, you know, play five out of their last six games on the road.
In order to insure themselves the championship beyond question, they must
split with the Bruins this weekend, then whip Stanford and U.S.C. in the
following four games. That won't be so easy.
Personally, I don't see how the Bears can possibly win more than three
of their next six games. That will wind them up with eight wins and four
losses, which won't be good enough.
They meet Ucla in Los Angeles tonight and tomorrow night; the Bruins
will win one of those, and could easily take both. It all depends on how
well His Nibs Price's boys have recovered from the three successive beat
ings they took last week from the Oakland Bittners (sometimes called the
Stanford Alumni), St. Mary's, and Santa Clara.

You can't count Cal out definitely, though; often in the past they've
been prematurely buried, then have come back to haunt the grave-diggers.
They have a good, sound basketball team; not great, but good. They won't
pull an el foldo.
Now let's get back to Stanford. Recently Mr. Laughing Boy Farkas
wrote a piece for this paper in which he evaluated the abilities of the
Indian basketballers. He concluded they all had great potentialities which
they had not as yet reached.
Well, they still aren't as good as I think they will be in the future,
but a great improvement can be noted week by week; the boys are getting
there. They got off to a rather bad start, but if they keep getting better at
the present rate they may be as tough as any team in the league by sea
son's end.
One of the greatest weaknesses has been lack of reserve strength. Now
Bill Drehobl, Milt Iverson, and Bob Lewis have shown themselves capable
of lending yeoman aid to the first-stringers. Other players are rounding
into form, also.
Bill Stephenson doesn't look like the same player who started the
season at center for the Cards. He's still a bit awkward, but his floor play
is much better, and he's a good shot. Capt. Dave Davidson, the smoothest
of the starting quintet, is brilliant but erratic. Also, he still piles up
quite a few of those damaging persona] fouls.
But the most noteworthy rise in quality can be found in the play of
Babe Higgins. Always a smoothie on the floor, he cut loose for 32 points in
the recent Los Angeles weekend. He may be the shot in the arm the team
needs.
Open the Door, Sam, Babe"* Knoeking
He pulled a Harlem Globetrotter trick in the U.S.F. game; blocked off
by a guard, he dribbled the ball around behind himself and kept on going,
leaving a most embarrassed young man clutching at the air. The fans —all
2,700 of them—burst into a startled roar. Babe is knocking at the gates of
stardom, and may get in this week—over the recumbent forms of Sam
Barry's Trojans.
Dick Berlin, who doesn't look like a basketball player at all, has proved
himself one of the classiest guards in the Division. When he covers a man,
that gentleman's scoring average takes a drop. He doesn't shoot often him
self, but can pile up points like mad when the other boys are too closely
guarded.
That leaves Morley Thompson who, like Davidson, is erratic. But on
one of his hot nights he can't be stopped with a shotgun. He pours in the
buckets from all angles, seemingly without taking aim. As he gains ex
perience his "off" nights get farther and farther apart. The boy has some
thing that can't be bought—natural ability.
So—things look pretty rosy for the S.C. series. Stanford managed to
gain a split in Los Angeles at a time when Thompson and Davidson were
in far from good health. The team came from behind to snatch the first
game and were pulling a repeat in the second until Stephenson and David
son were tossed out of the game on personal fouls.
It's hard to see how they can keep from winning at least one of the two
games. Everett Dean has done a fine job of developing a wealth of innate
talent; he's molded it into a unit which gets better all the time. Yes, they'll
gain at least a split with S.C. Me? I think they'll take both games.

It May lit' a llreak for Stanford Anyhow
Because of an exceedingly weird bit of .schedule making, the Stanford
basketball team will meet the Southern California Trojans lour times in
a row. By 11 o'clock tomorrow night the boys on the respective squads will
have seen so much of each other they'll be old friends. Usually, of course,
different schools compete each weekend.
How it all came about is not quite clear to me. I know only that the
other three Southern Division schools released schedules early in the prac
tice season, schedules which kept the Indians on the road lor the entire
first half of the loop race.
The boys over at the S.A.C. were pretty close-mouthed about th<- whole
thing; they said merely that Stanford had as yet approved no Conference
basketball schedule. One would assume that, since California came down
here for one game during the second week of play, Stanford finally suc
ceeded in getting at least one small concession. We got one home game out
of the first six.
As I said, the schedule making was weird—but it may turn out to Stan
ford's advantage in the long run. The boys have finished traveling for
the year, except for one short jump to Berkeley. Five out of the next six
games will be played here on the Farm. That should give Everett Dean's
lads a slight advantage.
As for meeting El Trojan four times in a row, that has its compensations
also; El isn't so tough this year—not like he used to be, at least. The Cards
are coining along fast, and this is a critical period. It's fortunate that they
are able to play what has proved to be the Division's weakest team at this
time.

Incidentally, some of the guessperts should have red faces by now—if
they're capable of shame. They unanimously nominated the Cards for last
place in the Division. Even I couldn't stomach that, and some time ago said
1 didn't think they'd wind up the face in the cellar.
Perhaps you remember a Daily column by H. D. Thoreau just at the

start of the football season, in which he predicted (at
long range) the finishing order of the Southern Divi
sion schools in the basketball race.
