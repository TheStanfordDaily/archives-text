# INDIAN CAGERS TACKLE TROJANS TWICE
## 
### ART SHAPIRO 
Bounding past the halfway mark, the basketball season goes down the
home stretch as the Trojans of Southern California move into the Pavilion
lor two matches over the weekend.
Playing all of their remaining games at home, except one against the
Berkeley Bears, the Indians are in an excellent position to remake a rather

mediocre season into a highly suc
cessful one. Boasting a record of
seven victories against a single de
feat on the hardwood court of the
Pavilion, the Cardinals now have the
opportunity to duplicate this effort
against conference competition.
USC, the lirsl conference foe to
tackle the Red Machine at home
in a two-game series, is the most
under-rated quintet in league play.
When the Trojans peak for a game
they are as difficult a squad to
deny as the league - leading Cal
and UCLA teams. After receiving
four successive lacings at the hands
of the Bears and the Bruins, the
Trojans stood up on their hind
legs and hooted Stanford in their
conference hopes last Saturday
evening.
This week-end's encounters with
the Boys from Troy will be the last
time the two .squads meet, and the
Indians are out for blood, and two
scalps to dangle round their belts.
The week-end clashes will pit
the shortest live in the conference
against the tallest over-all squad.
Stanford, with an average height
of (i foot 2 will tower over the Tro
jans, who barely manage to reach
(he 72-inch mark. The one excep
: (ion which proves the rule is Alex
I llannum the (» foot (i center, who
practically single handedly sunk
the lied Machine last Saturday in
the southland. If Steve Stephen
son. the high-scoring Card center,
can hold Alex down to a minimum
of buckets, the Indians should be
in a position to cop both contests.
Coach Dean when questioned
about the varsity's chances against
the rejuvenated Trojan five answer
ed, "Stanford turned in two good
games last week against USC, despite
several handicaps. USC is a better
team than their standing indicates.
With Hannum at his best they are

as good as any team in the confer
ence. We are looking forward to two
hard games, and hope that good for
tune will be ours."
Tickets are still available for
purchase al the S.A.C. The restric
tion limiting purchases to but one
game with a Student Body Card
has been lifted and now it is pos
sible to buy tickets for both games.
It all of tin' tickets are not sold to
the student body, they will be
placed 011 general sale at game
time.
The starting lineup for the varsity
clashes will pit Rock and Webster
at the forward positions against Mor
ley Thompson and Dave Davidson,
Alex Hannum will square off against
Steve Stephenson, while Winter and
Bertram will hold down the guard
slots against Babe Higgins and Dick
Berlin.
Starting time for the prelim has
been set for 6:15, with the varsity
squads going at S.

Berkeley Bears, the Indians are in an excellent position to remake a rather

mediocre season into a highly suc
cessful one. Boasting a record of
seven victories against a single de
feat on the hardwood court of the
Pavilion, the Cardinals now have the
opportunity to duplicate this effort
against conference competition.
USC, the lirsl conference foe to
tackle the Red Machine at home
in a two-game series, is the most
under-rated quintet in league play.
When the Trojans peak for a game
they are as difficult a squad to
deny as the league - leading Cal
and UCLA teams. After receiving
four successive lacings at the hands
of the Bears and the Bruins, the
Trojans stood up on their hind
legs and hooted Stanford in their
conference hopes last Saturday
evening.
This week-end's encounters with
the Boys from Troy will be the last
time the two .squads meet, and the
Indians are out for blood, and two
scalps to dangle round their belts.
The week-end clashes will pit
the shortest live in the conference
against the tallest over-all squad.
Stanford, with an average height
of (i foot 2 will tower over the Tro
jans, who barely manage to reach
(he 72-inch mark. The one excep
: (ion which proves the rule is Alex
I llannum the (» foot (i center, who
practically single handedly sunk
the lied Machine last Saturday in
the southland. If Steve Stephen
son. the high-scoring Card center,
can hold Alex down to a minimum
of buckets, the Indians should be
in a position to cop both contests.
Coach Dean when questioned
about the varsity's chances against
the rejuvenated Trojan five answer
ed, "Stanford turned in two good
games last week against USC, despite
several handicaps. USC is a better
team than their standing indicates.
With Hannum at his best they are

as good as any team in the confer
ence. We are looking forward to two
hard games, and hope that good for
tune will be ours."
Tickets are still available for
purchase al the S.A.C. The restric
tion limiting purchases to but one
game with a Student Body Card
has been lifted and now it is pos
sible to buy tickets for both games.
It all of tin' tickets are not sold to
the student body, they will be
placed 011 general sale at game
time.
The starting lineup for the varsity
clashes will pit Rock and Webster
at the forward positions against Mor

Berlin.
