# Bears Invade Bruins' Lair
## 
### 
Highlighting Pacific Coast basket
ball this week-end will be the series
between the Golden Bears and their
Bruin Cousins in Los Angelas. A
sweep by UCLA could clinch the
title, while a split would leave UC
one game ahead by virtue of Stan
ford's initial win over the Bruins.
Starting for California will be the
usual five of Hanger, Wolfe. Rocker,
Hogeboom, and Durkee. However,
Gordon Cuneo, ex of the Dardi Dan
dies and Blue squad, will take over
one of the forward positions if either
Wolfe or Rocker is off form as they
were during the Bears last three tilts.
Cuneo was 011 the Bear varsity be
fore the war, and then starred on
the Dandies. During this year he
has been the Blue's top scorer.
