# Rugby Men Way Menlo
## 
### 
Rugby will again be on the sports
menu Saturday afternoon when
Stanford meets the Menlo Ramblers
here on the intramural field by the
Corporation Yard at 3 p.m.
It's the fourth time out for the
steadily improving Cards who've
dropped their first three games but
have looked better each week.
Two weeks ago, Menlo lost, 12-6,
to the Olympic Club which last week
defeated the Farm ruggers, 12-6.
As an added attraction this week,
there will be a preliminary game be
tween the Stanford "B" team and
Menlo Junior College which will
start about 1:30 p.m.
The remaining games on the Stan
lord schedule are:
Saturday, Feb. 22 — Stanford vs.
University Club here at 3 p.m.
Saturday, March 1 — Stanford vs.
University of San Francisco here at
3 p.m.
Saturday, March 8 — Stanford vs.
University of California (this game
is still tentative and the date may
be changed.
