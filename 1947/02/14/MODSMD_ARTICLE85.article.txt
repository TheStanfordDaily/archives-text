## Something Money Won't Fix 
### 
An attempt was made at Excom Wednesday
night to discover what is wrong with Stan
ford's social program — why all-campus
dances do not go over. In our opinion nothing
was discovered. Excom members did not get
to the root of the problem. They simply ap
propriated $2,075.05 for the sophomore co
tillion, because the sophomore class is plan
ning to outdo all other dances ever given at
Stanford with tremendous and unusual deco
rations.
Various members expressed belief that
the drawing card for dances is the decora
tions, the band, or some new theme, and
that giving the sophomores a chance to
show what they can do will prove whether
or not this is the answer.
It may be the answer, but we are afraid
that appropriating a large sum of money to
one group for a dance will establish a prece
dent (particularly if the dance is successful),
so that each new group putting on an all
campus dance will try to outdo the preceding
one. In this case large sums of money will be
spent each time for fantastic decorations and
famous orchestras and groups will not think
of new ideas and themes for dances that can
be done cheaply and simply—thereby saving
the money for more worthwhile purposes.
After all, what really makes a dance suc
cessful so that students will want to go? Is it
the decorations or the orchestra primarily?
We think not. You notice the decorations, of
course, but you still don't forget you're in the

pavilion or the women's gym. And big-name
bands take just as many intermissions as the
local ones, forcing couples out in the cold for
a cigarette every 20 minutes as they try to
make bright conversation.
You want to go to a particular dance when
all your friends are going. And if they'fe
not going, you'd rather do what they are
going to do. So our dance problem, it then
follows, could be solved if all-campus
dances were made the thing to go to. This,
of course, brings up another question—how
do we make these dances the thing to do?
Some suggestions that might be tried are:
1. Through the use of an activities file, se
lect more and different people to work on
dances so they and their friends will want
to go.
2. Have a number of all-campus dances
each guarter (not just the usual one or two) that
are decorated simply with a clever theme,
and a juke box for some of them so that we
can take our intermissions when we wish.
Admission should be cheap as fellows be
grudge spending from S3 to $5 for a dance.
3. Have some jolly-up types of dances in
the afternoon in the pavilion or gym or even
outside spring guarter where people could
just drop in for an hour or so.
These suggestions are not fool-proof but
they might be worth a try, and they might
also start others thinking along these lines
which is certainly a step in the right direction.
