## HISTORY 1947

After due consideration, I object to and oppose the
International Survey Committee's plan to send a few
Stanford students abroad this summer. In the first
place, I doubt that this visit of a few weeks will
reveal to these chosen few anything that trained and
competent observers, both American and foreign,
are not already attempting to tell us every day.
Secondly, at the present time probably half the stu
dent body has spent (I almost said "done") time in
most of the countries of the world. So these men
were in the service at the time! Does that make their
impressions and observations of any less validity?
There were veterans who learned very little from
their foreign service, true, but I have a higher opin
ion of Stanlord students myself. No specific attempt
has been made to use this mass of material so read
ily available. Again, suppose that a half-dozen Farm
men and women do spend a month overseas. Will
that percentage of our seven thousand enrollment be
enough to excite the student body to any appreciable
pitch of internationalist enthusiasm? I doubt it. How
many will turn out to hear a speaker on foreign af
fairs, anyway? How many showed up to hear Dr.
Dongler? In my opinion, a far more substantial con
tribution to better international relations would be
made by taking the approximate $5,000 those junkets
would cost and using it to pay the expenses of the
same number of foreign exchange students for a year
at Stanford.

1 am one who has raised his voice against any
arbitrary slashes in the appropriations for the armed
forces. I see by the papers that the Congressional
budget committee has proposed a substantial reduc
tion in these and other budget items; from the War
and Navy Departments comes a weeping and a wail
ing and a gnashing of teeth. Frankly, when the talk
runs in billions, as it is doing, I don't know v/hat it
means. I don't have any satisfactory yardstick for
measuring billions. Nor do I have any detailed in
formation on the precise details of these proposed
reductions in appropriations. So where does that
leave me and Mr. Average Citizen in general?
In principle, we must maintain armed forces suf
ficient (a) to defend ourselves, (b) to meet our in
ternational obligations, and (c) to engage in neces
sary research, planning, and training. What precise
amounts in dollars and cents these elements repre
sent, I don't know. The only answer at which I can
arrive is: that's what Congress is there for. The
services can give the Congressional committees the
services' side of the story; the administration can fill
in with the facts and figures of our international ob
ligations; and the Congress will have no trouble get
ting any other information it wants, besides. Then
the Houses will make their decision, presumably in
the national interest. Like I say, that's what they're
there for.
