# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
To the Editor:
In response to Wednesday's editorial by Jack
Oglesby, "Why You Take a Chance on a Date," I
should like to say a few words, words which I think
Jack felt like saying but didn't say because he
wanted to draw out campus intterest, thought and
opinion.
First of all I shall agree with all that Jack said
and in fact assume that there is a distinct psycho
logical gap for obvious reasons between Stanford's
male and female student population as a whole. And
il seems to me that this gap can quite well be con
sidered to be a difference in maturity (a very rela
tive word).
Now it's fairly obvious that all Stanford men.
whether veterans or not. whether twenty or thirty,
aren't particularly mature, not in the general and
basic sense of the word. For that matter neither are
many Phi Beta Kappa graduates or e'Vcn some of the
delegates to the United Nations.
But the crux and the difficulty of the situation is
this: that as a whole Stanford men are more mature
than Stanford women; and because maturity and
immaturity, like water and oil, don't mix, compati
bility very often does not and cannot exist.
Now it logically follows that since this incom
patibility does exist, that since, as is true in most
cases like this, opposites do not attract, at least not
basically, there arc two theoretical alternatives or
solutions: either the men as a whole become less
mature or the women as a whole become more ma
ture, if compatibility is to exist to a satisfactory de
gree.
Now maturity, like knowledge, once gained does
not appreciably lessen, at least not voluntarily.
That's like asking water to run uphill naturally. And
according to most philosophies and ideals, whether
practical or abstract, maturity is desirable.
So it becomes quite apparent, I think, that but one
logical and desirable alternative remains, if further

compatibility is to be attained: that Stanford women
as a whole become more mature. Incidentally, there
are probably a number of mature Stanford women
around, most of whom are probably speculating as
they brew beer atop Hoover Libc; certainly there
aren't many such "pearls of great price" wandering
around the Quad.
And I suppose that in becoming more mature,
each individual must as an essential part of the
process learn the means which such progress neces
sitates. And maturity, like right, is a direction, not
a thing simply defined. But certainly growing up
(becoming more mature) requires among many
other things appreciating something like good classi
cal music more than Frankie Sinatra, valuing .some
thing like friendship in the real sense of the word
more than sentimental intrigue, and in general val -
uing something more basic than prettiness and
wealth and their objects as an intrinsic criterion and
ultimate goal for our endeavor.
Let's become really interesting, girls, in lots ol
ways. Let's realize that most Stanford men, though
they love sex, prettiness and liquor, love other in
teresting tilings, too. And then, let's do something
about it!

To the Editor:
So it has happened! I don't know what Gloria
Chasson thinks of it but I would advise Cedric B.
Cowing and other interested students to read hei
letter to the editor once again. As somebody has
said, "there is more in this than meets the eye." I
really appreciate the spirit in which both of the let
ters were written, and as a member of the student
body want to congratulate both of the writers: Miss
Chasson for her brilliant letter and Mr. Cowan foi
his sincerity of purpose. As anybody can sec, both
believe in the same thing.

In response to Wednesday's editorial by Jack
Oglesby, "Why You Take a Chance on a Date," I
should like to say a few words, words which I think
Jack felt like saying but didn't say because he
wanted to draw out campus intterest, thought and
opinion.
First of all I shall agree with all that Jack said
and in fact assume that there is a distinct psycho
logical gap for obvious reasons between Stanford's
male and female student population as a whole. And
il seems to me that this gap can quite well be con
sidered to be a difference in maturity (a very rela
tive word).
Now it's fairly obvious that all Stanford men.
whether veterans or not. whether twenty or thirty,
aren't particularly mature, not in the general and
basic sense of the word. For that matter neither are
many Phi Beta Kappa graduates or e'Vcn some of the
delegates to the United Nations.
But the crux and the difficulty of the situation is
this: that as a whole Stanford men are more mature
than Stanford women; and because maturity and
immaturity, like water and oil, don't mix, compati
bility very often does not and cannot exist.
Now it logically follows that since this incom
patibility does exist, that since, as is true in most
cases like this, opposites do not attract, at least not
basically, there arc two theoretical alternatives or
solutions: either the men as a whole become less
mature or the women as a whole become more ma
ture, if compatibility is to exist to a satisfactory de
gree.
Now maturity, like knowledge, once gained does
not appreciably lessen, at least not voluntarily.
That's like asking water to run uphill naturally. And
according to most philosophies and ideals, whether
practical or abstract, maturity is desirable.
So it becomes quite apparent, I think, that but one
logical and desirable alternative remains, if further

compatibility is to be attained: that Stanford women
as a whole become more mature. Incidentally, there
are probably a number of mature Stanford women
around, most of whom are probably speculating as
they brew beer atop Hoover Libc; certainly there
aren't many such "pearls of great price" wandering
around the Quad.
And I suppose that in becoming more mature,
each individual must as an essential part of the
process learn the means which such progress neces
sitates. And maturity, like right, is a direction, not
a thing simply defined. But certainly growing up
(becoming more mature) requires among many
other things appreciating something like good classi
cal music more than Frankie Sinatra, valuing .some
thing like friendship in the real sense of the word
more than sentimental intrigue, and in general val -
uing something more basic than prettiness and
wealth and their objects as an intrinsic criterion and
ultimate goal for our endeavor.
Let's become really interesting, girls, in lots ol
ways. Let's realize that most Stanford men, though
they love sex, prettiness and liquor, love other in
teresting tilings, too. And then, let's do something
about it!

So it has happened! I don't know what Gloria
Chasson thinks of it but I would advise Cedric B.
Cowing and other interested students to read hei
letter to the editor once again. As somebody has
said, "there is more in this than meets the eye." I
really appreciate the spirit in which both of the let
ters were written, and as a member of the student
body want to congratulate both of the writers: Miss
Chasson for her brilliant letter and Mr. Cowan foi
his sincerity of purpose. As anybody can sec, both
believe in the same thing.
