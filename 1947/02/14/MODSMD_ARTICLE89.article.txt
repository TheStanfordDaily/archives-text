# Excom Serves As Campus Congress
## 
### 
When the federal government acts on some matter which the
private citizen feels should be done another way, or needlessly
spends his hard-earned dollars, one of the first things the citizen
thinks of doing is to write his congressman.
Stanford has its congressmen in the members of the Executive

Committee elected by the student
body each autumn and spring quar
ter.
Excom members arc the repre
sentatives of eleven Stanford dis
tricts, with one member at large
representing graduate students.
Their main function is to act as
go-between for the student gov
erning board as a whole and tbe
individual Stanford citizen.
Ex coin also serves as liaison be
tween faculty and students. Legit
imate "beefs," presented to Excom
by district representatives, are re
ferred to the proper channels for
effective administrative action.
After the weekly meetings, repre
sentatives talk up adopted measures,
ask opinions on pending decisions,
and receive suggestions which their
district members feel deserve Ex
com consideration.
