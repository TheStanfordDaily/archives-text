Service .... that s the keynote at the Crow Pharmacy. To extend every I
courtesy and assistance to you Stanfordites when you're in Paly—to
make you a member of the happy Crow Family. That's why we're more
than glad to cash your checks, hold your packages while you take in a
show, or anything else within our power to make you feel right at home.
.... Truly, where else can an Injun get SO MUCH for SO LITTLE! 5
