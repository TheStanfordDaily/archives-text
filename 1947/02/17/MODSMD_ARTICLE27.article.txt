# Farm Engineers Film First Meteor Waves

### JIM JOSEPH 
The sound of meteors passing through the upper atmosphere was re
co! iled on film lor the first time last week by a group of Stanford meteoi
i t lurchers. The buzz-bomb-like whistles from reflected radio waves was
ii i orded on acetate, and adapted to the sound track of moving picture
idm.
Oswald G. Villard, Jr., acting assistant professor of electrical engineer-

'hear' meteors, following earlier j
