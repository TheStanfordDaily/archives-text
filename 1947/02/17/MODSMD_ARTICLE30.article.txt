# New Electron Law Disclosed
## 
### 
A new law lor ihe calculation of
the ''cpaeiiching of superconduc
tivity in metals by magnetic fields
has been announced by Dr. Richard
A. Ogg, associate professor m the
Chemistry Department.
This law, which may be consid
ered as bearing the same relation to
superconductivity as Boyle's Law to
gas, will be presented m the forth
coining issue of the magazine Phys
ical Review.
Dr. Ogg is renowned for his the
ory on why alkali metals possess
superconductivity in solid ammonia
solution. This he offered as a model
for the understanding of supercon
ductivity.
The theory, which assumed the
existence of electrons of macrosco
pic size, created a sensation in sci
entific circles when it was first an
nounced last March.
Dr. Ogg is assisted in this work
by research asssociate Dr. Michell
J. Sienko, and graduate students
Donald Loel'fler, Robert Fristrom,
and Harold Eding.
Experiments conducted are in the
new field of liquid ammonia, a
school of chemistry pioneered at
Stanford and started by the late
Dr. Edward C. Franklin, professor
emeritus of organic chemistry,
and sponsored by the Office of Na
val Research.
