# Civ Libe Returns To Old Schedule
## 
### 
The Western Civ library is back
again on its full schedule of 14
hours a day since last Friday. Lit
erally hundreds of students heaved
a sigh of. relief at this good news.
For the last two-weeks the li
brary worked on a nine-hour shift.
The trouble started when a few stu
dents tried to introduce grapefruit
and cracker-throwing as a part of
the program in the library in the
evenings.
The administration decided to
stop it by closing the libe in the
evenings after 5:30. As a result no
disturbances were created in the
libe during the last two weeks.
