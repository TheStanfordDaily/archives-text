# Ram's Head Productions Reveal Realism, Comedy
## 
### DEE KEATLEY 
Two realistic and humorous com
edies of life and a serious Biblical
drama made up the Ram's Head
program of original one-acts which
opened Friday night in the Little
Theater.
The first play, "This Our Life
time," by Jeffrey Carter and Allen
Fletcher, was an experimental dra
ma filled with pathos and humor.
The action took place on a Pullman
car with only chairs and lights as
scenery.
HUMOROUS PARTS
Particularly good in their humor
ous performances were Miriam
Worland, as a woman from the au
dience, Lois Lazzarini and Pauline
Schaffer, as two old maids, and
Charles Gans, as the angel. The rest
of the cast included Norman Var
nado, Nancy DeGroot, George Boer,
Charles McVay, Piggy Cox, David
Richardson, and John Vaughn
Legend of Susannah, written ny

Gladys Regier and directed by Wil
liam Melton, was a serious drama
about two Jewish lovers who were
saved from death by the interven
tion of Christ. The play was fairly
well constructed with a well-defined
climax, hut was rather slow-start
ing and tended to drag in spots.
ARMV LIFE STAGED
The eternally funny trials and
tribulations fit Army life were
treated in Roy Poole's "Russian
Lullaby," a fast-moving comedy that
held the interest of the audience
until the very end. In this play, di
rected by Bob Ashley, one of the
soldiers in an Army show touring
Europe crossed over to the Russian
/on â–  and with the aid of a Russian
soldier, who turned out to be a high
ranking colonel, raided a night club.
Harold Todd, Newton Arnold, and
Norman Varnado were excellent as
the adventurous soldier, the Russian
colonel, and the rank - conscious
young captain of the MP's.
