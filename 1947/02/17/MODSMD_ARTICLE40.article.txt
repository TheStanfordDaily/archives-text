# Last Ditch Cardinal Rally Wins S.C. Series
## Indians Break Cage Tie On Dick Berlin's Basket 
### ART SHAPIRO 
With the second hand showing but 15 seconds remaining in the contest
and the Pavilion a madhouse of noise and excitement, Dick Berlin took
a whip pass from Captain Dave Davidson, whirled, and dropped in the
tic-breaking field goal which sent the Indians ahead to a 50-48 victory over
the U.S.C. hoopsters, Saturday evening.
The win on Saturday, following the 55-50 triumph Friday evening, as-

sured the Cardinals of at least fin
ishing in third position in th» con
fidence race. Stanford's league rec
ord now stands at four victories
against four defeats.
The Saturday fracas started to
follow the familiar pattern with
U.S.C. going ahead to a 2-7 lead
before live minutes of play had
elapsed. A Hurry of counters by
Stephenson knotted tlv score at 9-9,
and from there on in the contest
was a see- iw affair. With 11 min
utes remaining in the first half, Alex
Hannum, the 0-loot-6 Trojan cen
ler, was forced to the sidelines with
four personal fouls, just one shy of
an automatic eviction.
CARDS TAKE LEAD
Without the sterling play of Han
num, the Boys from Troy started to
flounder and by halftime Stanford
held a four-point lead, 23-19. A
lather dubious decision by the offi
cials just before the half ended
brought forth a storm of protests
from the Pavilion, and memories of
the Berkeley 800 Pavilion flashed
across tlr- minds of all present.
The second half started with a
roar as Stephenson dumped in a
beautiful book shot and Thompson
added a two-hand jump shot which
stretched the Cardinal margin to
eight points.
Stanford managed to match bas
ket for basket with the Trojans.
With 10 minutes left in the game,
the Cards were the proud possessors
of an eight-point margin, but then
the heavens opened and the game
took on a new complexion.
TROJANS TIE SCOiiE
A series of buckets by White and
Conti ti *d up the ball game with six
minutes to go. A foul shot by Ber
lin sent the Red Machine out in
front 43-42, but Bertram and Conti
hit the netting for U.S.C. and the
visitors led, 43-40, with only three
minutes to play.
Davidson came through with a
two-pointer, then matched that ef
fort with another field goal to send
the Indians ahead, 47-40. Southern
California began their tight man-to
man defense i ight under the Stan
ford basket in an effort to capture
the casaba and score themselves. A
foul by U.S.C. was denied by Cap
lain Davidson and Stanford took the
ball fit mid-court.
THIRD TIME'S A CHARM
Once again U.S.C. came across
with a foul, and once again it was
refused and the Cards had the ball
at mid-court. When the Trojans
fouled for the third time. Davidson
cave the go-head to Babe Higgins
and he sank the one-pointer to send
Stanford into the lead, 48-40.
Shanley of I .S C. took a pass
from Ilannum and sank a pretty
set shot to tie up the contest with
25 seconds to go. Giis Chavalas,
who had entered the contest a few
seconds earlier, took the pass-out
from Stephenson, passed to Da
vidson who drove in ami missed.
For a second it looked as if i( was
all over, but Davidson recovered
liis own shot and passed in to
Berlin, who stood unguarded un
der the netting. Up went Dick
ami down went the Trojans.
Steve Stephenson walked away
with scoring honors for both games
as he piled up 15 counters Friday
night and 17 on Saturday. Second
honors went to Babe Higgins on
Friday with 14, and to Morley
Thompson and Gene Rock on Sat
urday, each of whom scored 10
counters.

The outstanding star of the series
was undoubtedly little Babe Hig

board:. like a center, set up plays
like a guard and scored like a for

style and a deceptive change of
pair, Higgins was the boy who dom
inated the Stanford offense and held
the defense together with precision
and finesse.

DICK BERLIN, rugged Stanford
guard, put Saturday night's excit
ing basketball game on ice with a
last-second field goal that broke
the backs of the USC cagers.
With the second hand showing but 15 seconds remaining in the contest
and the Pavilion a madhouse of noise and excitement, Dick Berlin took
a whip pass from Captain Dave Davidson, whirled, and dropped in the
tic-breaking field goal which sent the Indians ahead to a 50-48 victory over
the U.S.C. hoopsters, Saturday evening.
The win on Saturday, following the 55-50 triumph Friday evening, as-

sured the Cardinals of at least fin
ishing in third position in th» con
fidence race. Stanford's league rec
ord now stands at four victories
against four defeats.
The Saturday fracas started to
follow the familiar pattern with
U.S.C. going ahead to a 2-7 lead
before live minutes of play had
elapsed. A Hurry of counters by
Stephenson knotted tlv score at 9-9,
and from there on in the contest
was a see- iw affair. With 11 min
utes remaining in the first half, Alex
Hannum, the 0-loot-6 Trojan cen
ler, was forced to the sidelines with
four personal fouls, just one shy of
an automatic eviction.
CARDS TAKE LEAD
Without the sterling play of Han
num, the Boys from Troy started to
flounder and by halftime Stanford
held a four-point lead, 23-19. A
lather dubious decision by the offi
cials just before the half ended
brought forth a storm of protests
from the Pavilion, and memories of
the Berkeley 800 Pavilion flashed
across tlr- minds of all present.
The second half started with a
roar as Stephenson dumped in a
beautiful book shot and Thompson
added a two-hand jump shot which
stretched the Cardinal margin to
eight points.
Stanford managed to match bas
ket for basket with the Trojans.
With 10 minutes left in the game,
the Cards were the proud possessors
of an eight-point margin, but then
the heavens opened and the game
took on a new complexion.
TROJANS TIE SCOiiE
A series of buckets by White and
Conti ti *d up the ball game with six
minutes to go. A foul shot by Ber
lin sent the Red Machine out in
front 43-42, but Bertram and Conti
hit the netting for U.S.C. and the
visitors led, 43-40, with only three
minutes to play.
Davidson came through with a
two-pointer, then matched that ef
fort with another field goal to send
the Indians ahead, 47-40. Southern
California began their tight man-to
man defense i ight under the Stan
ford basket in an effort to capture
the casaba and score themselves. A
foul by U.S.C. was denied by Cap
lain Davidson and Stanford took the
ball fit mid-court.
THIRD TIME'S A CHARM
Once again U.S.C. came across
with a foul, and once again it was
refused and the Cards had the ball
at mid-court. When the Trojans
fouled for the third time. Davidson
cave the go-head to Babe Higgins
and he sank the one-pointer to send
Stanford into the lead, 48-40.
Shanley of I .S C. took a pass
from Ilannum and sank a pretty
set shot to tie up the contest with
25 seconds to go. Giis Chavalas,
who had entered the contest a few
seconds earlier, took the pass-out
from Stephenson, passed to Da
vidson who drove in ami missed.
For a second it looked as if i( was
all over, but Davidson recovered
liis own shot and passed in to
Berlin, who stood unguarded un
der the netting. Up went Dick
ami down went the Trojans.
Steve Stephenson walked away
with scoring honors for both games
as he piled up 15 counters Friday
night and 17 on Saturday. Second
honors went to Babe Higgins on
Friday with 14, and to Morley
Thompson and Gene Rock on Sat
urday, each of whom scored 10

DICK BERLIN, rugged Stanford
guard, put Saturday night's excit
ing basketball game on ice with a
last-second field goal that broke
the backs of the USC cagers.
With the second hand showing but 15 seconds remaining in the contest
and the Pavilion a madhouse of noise and excitement, Dick Berlin took
a whip pass from Captain Dave Davidson, whirled, and dropped in the
tic-breaking field goal which sent the Indians ahead to a 50-48 victory over
the U.S.C. hoopsters, Saturday evening.
The win on Saturday, following the 55-50 triumph Friday evening, as-

sured the Cardinals of at least fin
ishing in third position in th» con
fidence race. Stanford's league rec
ord now stands at four victories
against four defeats.
The Saturday fracas started to
follow the familiar pattern with
U.S.C. going ahead to a 2-7 lead
before live minutes of play had
elapsed. A Hurry of counters by
Stephenson knotted tlv score at 9-9,
and from there on in the contest
was a see- iw affair. With 11 min
utes remaining in the first half, Alex
Hannum, the 0-loot-6 Trojan cen
ler, was forced to the sidelines with
four personal fouls, just one shy of
an automatic eviction.
CARDS TAKE LEAD
Without the sterling play of Han
num, the Boys from Troy started to
flounder and by halftime Stanford
held a four-point lead, 23-19. A
lather dubious decision by the offi
cials just before the half ended
brought forth a storm of protests
from the Pavilion, and memories of
the Berkeley 800 Pavilion flashed
across tlr- minds of all present.
The second half started with a
roar as Stephenson dumped in a
beautiful book shot and Thompson
added a two-hand jump shot which
stretched the Cardinal margin to
eight points.
Stanford managed to match bas
ket for basket with the Trojans.
With 10 minutes left in the game,
the Cards were the proud possessors
of an eight-point margin, but then
the heavens opened and the game
took on a new complexion.
TROJANS TIE SCOiiE
A series of buckets by White and
Conti ti *d up the ball game with six
minutes to go. A foul shot by Ber
lin sent the Red Machine out in
front 43-42, but Bertram and Conti
hit the netting for U.S.C. and the
visitors led, 43-40, with only three
minutes to play.
Davidson came through with a
two-pointer, then matched that ef
fort with another field goal to send
the Indians ahead, 47-40. Southern
California began their tight man-to
man defense i ight under the Stan
ford basket in an effort to capture
the casaba and score themselves. A
foul by U.S.C. was denied by Cap
lain Davidson and Stanford took the
ball fit mid-court.
THIRD TIME'S A CHARM
Once again U.S.C. came across
with a foul, and once again it was
refused and the Cards had the ball
at mid-court. When the Trojans
fouled for the third time. Davidson
cave the go-head to Babe Higgins
and he sank the one-pointer to send
Stanford into the lead, 48-40.
Shanley of I .S C. took a pass
from Ilannum and sank a pretty
set shot to tie up the contest with
25 seconds to go. Giis Chavalas,
who had entered the contest a few
seconds earlier, took the pass-out
from Stephenson, passed to Da
vidson who drove in ami missed.
For a second it looked as if i( was
all over, but Davidson recovered
liis own shot and passed in to
Berlin, who stood unguarded un
der the netting. Up went Dick
ami down went the Trojans.
Steve Stephenson walked away
with scoring honors for both games
as he piled up 15 counters Friday
night and 17 on Saturday. Second
honors went to Babe Higgins on
Friday with 14, and to Morley
Thompson and Gene Rock on Sat
urday, each of whom scored 10
counters.
