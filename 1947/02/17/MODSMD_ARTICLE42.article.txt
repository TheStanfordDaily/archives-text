# Card Matmen Drop Decision To San Jose
## 
### 
Stanford's wrestling hopes could
j be found kicking around somewhere
j in the dust early this week follow
-1 ing the 28 to 8 drubbing which a
| rugged San Jose squad handed the
Indians last Friday night in the
j men's gym.
Before the meet was finished, the
Stanford matmen found themselves
facing the remaining half of the
schedule without the services of
Winston Mumby, their star I(>s-1 b.
i/rappler, and varsity starter Fred
Berry, 128-lbs.
Mumby. who pulled it couple of
ribs at the end of the week in a
practice bout, went into Friday's
meet with several inches of tape
below his ribs but was forced to
withdraw from his match because
of the pain.
The previously undefeated wres
tler will be on the sidelines for the
remainder of the season unless his
injuries mend sufficiently enough to
: enable him to enter the Far Western
.it Oakland <>n March 1. Even if he
does journey to Oakland, he will
not be able to compete at his "peak.
L\JI'RY SIDELINES BERRY
Berry, who had been forced to the
! sidelines earlier this year because
of a skiing accident, was unable to
compete Friday night and will defi
nitely be out from now on with a
cracked ear. No replacement is on
hand to compete in his weight class,
and as a result the Indians must go
into all their remaining meets with
| a forfeiture of five points.
