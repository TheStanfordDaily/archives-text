## Climb Off the Pedestal! 
### 
Standing off at a good safe distance and
heckling Excom has become a favorite extra
curricular activity of a large portion of the stu
dent body.
We are obviously the last persons in the
world to give blanket endorsements to all Ex
com activities, but there should be a definite
self-imposed limit to the ineffective manner in
which a lot of criticism is being offered.
We receive a good many letters regarding
Excom, as well as hear copious amounts of
criticism of Excom, but few of these critical
persons ever take the trouble to offer these
suggestions directly to their Excom represen
tative.
Stanford is a small enough community for
students to offer directly to Excom members
any suggestions they have regarding student
affairs. With the hope of encouraging this,
Friday's Daily contained the names of Excom
members, the areas which they represent, and
the hours when they are able to meet with
students.
If the reaction to this shows results, it will
be repeated again this week.
Far too prevalent is the attitude of "let the

fools play their little game, and then we'll
tear apart their childish antics."
It takes no overwhelming amount of intelli
gence or fortitude for a person to criticise at
random from a distance, secure in the knowl
edge that he'll never come in contact with the
objects of his criticism.
This pseudo-sophisticated view toward com
munity activities, which are the basis of any
democratic form of government, leads to a
stratum of intelligentsia â€” which contributes
nothing toward the form of government which
makes its way of life possible.
With the existence of broad economic and
intellectual gaps in the average U.S. city such
attitudes can realistically be expected, but to
find such attitudes in about the same propor
tion on a college campus, where the economic
and intellectual extremes are not as great, is
more than a little disturbing.
The arm-chair intellects on campus should
either come out of their cubbyholes and
take an active part in student affairs or
cease their persistent snipping at those per
sons who are participating.
