### CECIL ROSPAW 
Tin 1 Alllce government of England still stands
Strained by the recent strike, torn by internal dis
sension over foreign policy, and now unable to meet
its basic commitments to the people, this cabinet still
remains in the position of leadership.
From American standards it is easy to say "So
cialism has failed in Britain" and dismiss the whole
thing. But an investigation of the British political
system will show one basic fallacy in this type of
thinking.
The government (or cabinet if you prefer) is
based on the vole of the House of Commons, and the
majority will of Commons is based on the vote of
the people. One negative vote in the house on an im
portant issue can force the cabinet to dissolve. From
here the Prime Minister may ask for a referendum
to elect a new House of Commons, or a coalition
cabinet may evolve.
As yet this has not happened and we are right
back considering the fact that Attlee is still Prime
Minister. From the British point of view this is an
overwhelming vote of confidence in Attlee, and in the
type of government he stands for. It is proof posi
tive that despite the stress of the times, the people
of Britain are willing to take the hard times now in
hopes of better times later.
By overlooking this fact, and misinterpreting the
troubles in England of the present period, the major
ity of opinion in this country has swung away from
the majority government in England and now rests
with the minority, headed by Winston Churchill.
And this at a time when Britain needs our support,
but is determined to go ahead and fight it out with
out our support.
Too many Americans confuse Socialism with Com
munism. There is a world of difference. Those
people who sincerely abhor Communism and the
dynamics of that plan, are cutting their throats by
also opposing the peaceful change now evolving in
Britain. A strong and democratic Britain, though
socialistic, may become our last bulwark when the

final ideological battle for the world gets in the final
stages.
My pica is to respect the will of the majority
of the British people, to support what they want,
and not what WE want, and to remember that the
struggle in Britain if studied correctly might be a
fine place for Americans to discover the way that
democracy can he maintained, and still satisfy the
basic economic demands of the people.
And also after due consideration I would like to
speak a word in favor of the plan to send a few
Stanford students abroad this summer.
A story and editorial discussion appeared in the
Daily on the same day that Mr. Norton raised his
objections to the I.S.C. plan about the $2,075 allotted
by Exeom to the sophomore class for a cotillion.
Norton quotes $5,000 as the approximate cost of
sending the students this summer, but as no definite
figures have beon released as yet it is safe to estimate
that the $5,000 figure is much too high and that when
the trips are concluded the cost of the cotillion and
the cost of the trips will assay out about the same.
I agree that there is a great wealth of untapped
knowldgc and thought lying latent around this
campus in the form of service men who have the
advantage of travel and experience in foreign
lands. But has it been tapped this year? Have any
of these men been given a chance to express them
selves in class on the countries under discussion?
Very seldom.
No one expects that the mere gesture on our part
of sending students to Europe will solve the ills of
the world, or write the peace.
But it is a fine positive step. It is something tan
gible and irrevocably ties Stanford to the One World
theory. It will be the basis for much discussion, and
what is important, thought.
By this plan the students with previous expe
rience may finally have their chance to express them
selves and to make their knowledge available to the
student body through the medium of the people who
went as representatives and the discussions they will
undoubtedly start.
