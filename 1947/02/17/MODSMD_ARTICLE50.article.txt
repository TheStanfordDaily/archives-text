To the Editor:
I graciously submit this little happening to the
Daily's Bull Sessioner, since it seems a shame to keep
it confined to work-a-day bus boy circles. The truly
astounding incident occurred Tuesday, Feb. 11. in the
course of my evening's employment as a Cellar foun
tain man.
There it js the practice, around about 10:15 as
closing time draws nigh, to drain off the hot choco
late Ilom the hot chocolate urn. so that that container
may be cleansed with warm, soapy water. This ma
neuver had taken place on the fateful evening, but I
had temporarily forgotten that the urn was now full
ol dishwater in the excitement of filling a large and
complicated order for two whites, a choc sundae, a
large lemon coke, and one hot chocolate.
So I quickly drew ofl a cup of dishwater, with my
customary finesse and deftness. The stufT did look a
little pale (but sometimes, on off days, our cocoa is
like that) and when I had brought it up to the
counter, il seemed as though the little grease par
ticles floating chcerfully on top were more numer
ous and more unusual than usual, but 112 didn't actu
ally worry about it.
I lie customer took his hot chocolate, along with
the rest of the order, and we never heard from him
again! Nor was he found cold and dead under one
of the Cellar booths, or contorted with pain in the
men's room. Presumably, too, the poor fellow paid
his 10 cents to the cashier, which should have given
the Cellar a neat profit on that particular item.
There's probably no moral hero, but one must ir
resistibly wonder —is the Cellar's hot chocolate no
better than lousy old soapy dishwater, or is the
Cellar's bland of dishwater so darn superior that il's
as good, as nourishing, and as delicious as hot choco
late? The implications either way may well be cam
pus-shaking.

P.S. If the above-mentioned customer will iden
tify himself to me I will personally refund his 10 cents
and treat him to the Cellar's world-famous deluxe
Banana Split (SO cents), and I will try to remember
to take the skin off the bananas.
To the Editor:
The debate has waxed not hotly enough and not
furiously enough concerning the question of Stan
lord's post-war memorial. Should it be a new Un
ion? Or should it be a new men's gymnasium?

(All letters should be addressed to the editor,
siqned and contain address and phone /lum
ber ol writer. There is no limit on words but
it is desirable they be short and to the point.)

Stanford should have its cake and cat it, too. Yes,
this University can have both; it should have both;
it needs both.
Approaching the question from the consideration
of utility, just as strong an argument is forwarded
for a new gymnasium as for a Union: our stndcnt
body and visiting student bodies cannot cram into
the present "sardine can" at the games; Stanford
needs a large gym which also can be transformed into
a dance floor, saving money at future social events
by having an adequately large capacity floor em
ploying only one dance band instead of two as this
University is now accustomed to doing at large
events; it is paradoxical for the University pos
sessing the third largest college football stadium in
the United States to have such a mediocre gym; the
present gym was* not built to handle a seven thou
sand student body, nor will it cope adequately with
the five thousand "leveled ofT" student body the ad
ministration expects to see in about three or four
years; and, most important, the gymnasium will be
a self-paying proposition because of larger gate re
ceipts. The question of paying for a new gymnasium
is the least important, for, being a sound business
proposition, financing should be relatively simple.
The problem there is the lethargy of the administra
tion in taking any initiative. But. admittedly, the lack
of initiative could be due to the fact that human
beings can cope only with just so many things dur
ing any set time. Perhaps we need patience.
The new Union is needed for much the same
reasons that prompt the need of a new gym: a larger
student body and crowded facilities will remain. It.
too. will help to pay for itself from enlarged internal
profits from the concessions.
Although building materials are scarce, and ex
pensive. enough planning should be done now so that
when materials loosen up somewhat, blueprints,
funds, sites, and contractors should be ready for both
plants. Why not? This is the mass production age.
II the rv?w sites are far enough apart on campus,
congestion cannot be cited as an argument.
On the other hand, if practical objections can he
found to oppose building both at the same time, the
student body should have an election to decide which
one it wanted t<> be built first —not just, which one
it wanted, for Stanford can have its cake and eat it.
too.
Respectfully yours,
George Vclliotes
