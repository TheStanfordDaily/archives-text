# English, Indian Students Discuss Foreign Study
## 
### JACK CAPITO 
Hockey-playing English war vet
: eran Muriel Lowe has unconscious-
I ly proved that a jolly British laugh
j and a casual friendly chat can do
i as much for foreign relations as all \
j the student societies and impres- !
sively lettered organizations.
; When Miss Lowe, the Village's
j British cousin, was asked what she
thought should be done to further j
international relations she was a
i little puzzled.
She said, "Perhaps it would help
to send students abroad to talk
with foreign students, to speak in
their language and hear their
point of view.
"I wish you could send all your
J students abroad not intending to i
1 solve or even investigate the politi- ;
cal and economic hudgepodges. The |
i diplomats and experts are doing a •
fine job of getting puzzled and
| entangled in them. Rather, they
| should plan just to get together with
i other students and talk over the
many interests we students of the
J world have in common.
FEAR ISOLATIONISM
"We Europeans are afraid that
' America will slip into its old isola- '
|tion; that is why I hope American
students will continue their efforts
to set examples of internationalism '
for organizations like the U.N. to
; follow.
I "Just a beginning has been made,
i however; there is much to be done j
1 in the way of organization and full :
: co-operation."
And why is Muriel at Stan
i ford?
"I want to find the answers,""she I
said. "I want to learn how you i
people of so many different back
grounds can live together peace
ably, and why the rest of the world
cannot do so."
Miss Lowe comes from Notts, Eng-
I land, having played cricket and
j hockey there before the war. She
j was to compete in the English-Aus
-1 tralian cricket meet in Australia, but
j war broke out three days before
I she was scheduled to leave; how
| ever, she did represent England in
! a hockey game in Paris. During the
I war. the Farm student served in the j
I British army and experienced the j
; London blitzes.
INDIA COMPARISON
In the heart of India lies a campus
I like Stanford.
"In fact, Stanford is so much like
it that when I first came here I felt
as if I were still in India," says V. ,
Jagannathan. referring to the India
Institute of Science in Bangalore, j
j The Indian student is a Villager, j
working for the degree of Doctor of ;
; Biochemistry, and is a graduate of
j Madras University in Madras, India.
"The architecture, the grass, and
j the palms here make me feel as
! though I were still in India. The
j informal way you dress at Stanford
j also makes me feel at home. We
j were afraid that in America we
I would have to bog ourselves down
with a lot of clothing. In India we J
dress informally, too."
Commenting on the comparison of
Farm students and those in India,
the foreign student stated that al
most anything said about India is j
true because there are so many !
races, religions, and cultures within j
the society. "But haven't you dis- j
covered that people everywhere arc |
pretty much the same?" he addeS. i
"The Indian student," lie ex
j plained, "is perhaps more inter
ested in politics than anything
' else right now. I find that most
| students here on campus do not
seem interested in foreign or state
politics, only campus politics, if
that." Commending the attitude
of veterans, he felt that they do
take a more active interest in for- ;
eign affairs, however.
Expressing the view that Ameri
can newspapers do not carry enough
foreign news. Jagannathan added, i
"It is too bad that the American |

newspapers play up every small
street riot instead of more signifi
cant events such as the adoption of
the Sargent Plan, which is a 15-year
plan, now being put into effect, to
attain 100 per cent literacy in India
by providing compulsory primary
education."
Questioned about the political
situation in India, (lie friendly
Villager replied, "Explosive!"
"I have hopes, great hopes, how
ever," he added. "I even expect to
see a free and independent India in
my day. I believe that our contro
versies can be settled. After all,
look at the United Nations. Are
they not having conflicts? It's bound
to happen when you have many na
tionalities coming together in a vast
country like India.
"1 think our progress in this re
spect is remarkable, for there are
only two factors now in conflict—
the Congress Party and the Mos
lems. All the other thousands of
factions are in harmony. Of course,
all the conflicts will not be settled
at once, but they will be settled."
