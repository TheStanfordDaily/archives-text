# Indian Students Preside at Dinner
## 
### 
Indian dinner and movies high- j
lighted the Saturday meeting of the |
International Club in the lower
lounge of the Women's Clubhouse. !
Among the 80 people who came to
find out what Indian dishes taste
like were Mr. and Mrs. H. Donald
Winbigler.
The dinner was prepared by S. S.
Gill and Mr. Chaudhari, two guest
students from the University of Cal
ifornia. The guests were served the I
famous Indian curry and two spc- !
cial vegetable preparations.
Indian recorded music was played
throughout the dinner. A few of
the Indian students were dressed
up in their national costumes to add j
color to the meeting.
Indian students received some In
dian movies just before the dinner j
and it was decided to show them at |
7:30 instead of the scheduled ad
dresses.
"Our Heritage" was the title of j
one short film showing the ancient j
architectural and artistic achieve- !
ments of the Indian people. In one
hour the guests were taken through I
the sixth-century caves of Ajunta
and Almora, the ancient temples
scattered throughout India, the mas
sive forts built by Moghul cmpcr- I
ors, and the immortal Taj Mahal.
A short film on the musical in- j
strumcnts of India was also shown.!
V. Jagannathan gave a short talk
on "Women in India" during the j
intermission. Talking about the !<â€¢- j
gal status of women in ancient In- j
dia, he said that the original law
makers made no special safeguards j
for them because they believed that i
"nature has given them so much j
power over men."
