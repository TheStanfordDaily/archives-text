# I.E.C. Surveys Foreign Schools
## 
### 
Stanford's newly formed Interna
tional Education Committee held its
first meeting Friday afternoon and
has begun work in contacting Amer
ican representatives of foreign ed
ucational institutions, chairman Al
fred Munk announced yesterday.
"The goal we hope to .reach is to
establish an office on campus that
will enable students to receive up
to-date information on specific uni
versities, curricula, pre-requisites,
tuition and accommodations, and so
save students interested in studying
abroad the trouble of having to con
tact the various sources for them
selves," Munk explained. "We will
also try to provide veterans with
information necessary for attending
these universities on the G.I. Bill."
The committee has requested that
any students on campus who have
already made contacts with foreign
schools or with their U.S. represen
tatives come to the next meeting
and make that information available
for the use of all. Also desired are
letters and direct contacts with stu
dents already studying abroad. The
next meeting of the I.E.C. will be
on Thursday at 5 in Marty Ander
son's office, and all interested in
helping the work of the committee
arc welcome to attend.
Chairman Alfred Munk an
nounced that the following students
are at present working on the 1.E.C.:
Maggie Ohrstrom, Peegy Sherman,
Eleanor Elicl, Marnie McKittrick,
Barbara Denning, Nancy Aldcn,
Dave Colburn, and Mary Martin.
