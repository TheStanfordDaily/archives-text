# Johnson to Read Poetry of Donne
## 
### 
Francis Johnson will read from
the poetry of John Donne today ;il
4:15 p.m. in the Briggs Room of the
Humanities Building.
Donne has been in considerable
vogue since the first World War and
was one of the models of T. S. Eliot.
He was a poet of the Renaissance, a
contemporary of Shakespeare's.
Dr. Johnson will read some of
Donne's earlier works, the uncon
ventional love poems, which reflect
Donne's period as a member of the
court. These will be compared with
the poems of Donne's later life,
which, although religious in tone,
contain the same spirit evident in
all of his poems.
