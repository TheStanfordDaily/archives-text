♦ SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 17 (UP).—The off-again,»on-agei
Western oil relinery strike was postponed for another 48 hour
: today, but the situation continued to look grim as unionists flatly
rejected a Standard Oil offer of a $35 monthly wage boost.
Frank Wenig, chairman of the U.S. Conciliation Service panel

the far-flung refiner
dispute, said the Standard offer in
eluded a $17.30 boost on tin- l>.n
wage structure plus a $17.50 cost
of-living raise, to be retroactive i .
; Jan. 1.
The offer, except for the retro
active clause, was almost identical
to a proposal made yesterday by lln
Shell Oil Company, which is b<ii;
! studied by the union's wage polir\
| committee.
I STANDARD FLATLY VETOED
The Standard offer, however, w
flatly turned down by Standard cr;
ployee representatives headed l>;
William Povall, international repr>
sentative of the CIO Oil Workei.
Union.
The Standard and Shell offer ,
Wenig pointed out, represent a coin
promise increase of approximately
21 cents an hour, as compared wit!'
the union's original demand for a
25 cents across the board increase.
WALKOUT HELD 4K HOURS
The widespread walkout, orici
nally set. to begin at 10 a.m. today,
was postponed for 48 hours !a t
night by O. A. Knight, internatior I
president of the union, who said h<
saw hope for peaceable settlement
of the dispute in evidence of la t
minute "progress in the negotia
tions."
The threatened strike, which
would involve between 17,000 and
20,000 unionists, would tie up the
operations of seven major conip
nies supplying gasoline and natui <1
gas to five Western states. The com
panics involved include Shell,
Standard, Richfield, General Pet to
leum, Texas, Union and Associated.
A strike against tho refineries
would probably diy up availal le
I gasoline supplies within two or
I three days, and cause a transporta-
I tion famine in the five states af
fee ted.
