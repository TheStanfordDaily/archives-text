WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 (UP)
The National Labor Relations Bn i I
J ruled tonight'that labor unions ha <
an obligation to bargain in good
I faith with employers.
Its precedent-set tiny decision v..
handed down in dismissing chan;<
'of unfair labor practices and rcfu
J sal-to-bargain which had been Ir ■ J
j against, publishers of two St. Pei.ei
j burg, Fla., newspapers by the Int« i
| national Typographical Union,
i The decision, completely overrul
i ing a trial examiner's report.
| that unions wishing to force em
j ployers to fulfill their "legal dut
I to bargain" under the Wagner A< '
j must also show a willingness to in
|gofiatc in good faith.
j Although the union is not IcimM
I required to bargain by the act, \'
j said, its refusal "may remove th(
j possibility of negotiation and thu
I preclude the existence of a situati
I in which the employer's own goo'l
! faith can be tested."
"If the employer's good faith tv;
not be tested, then its absence •
hardly be found."
Officials said the union could ap
peal the decision to the federal n;
cuit court of appeals at New Or!< m
if it desires.
The board held that a union's i'
fiisal to bargain did not relieve c
ployers of their legal responsibilit
to negotiate, but added:
"Tlie test of good faith . . . i '
I a rigid hut a fluctuating one. !i .
dependent upon how a reason.:!
j man might be expected to read '
I the bargaining attitude displayed i>
i those across the table."
