# I.S.C. Considers Aims of Survey
## 
### 
France is one of the five countries
mapped out for the A.S.S.U.-spon- I
sored itinerary group this summer.
It was chosen, according to Harry
Pangburn, head of the France com
mittee, primarily because it repre
sents typical problems of post-war
western Europe and because it has
a vigorous and extensive university
life.
The student picked for the sur
vey of this country will cover its !
scholastic and academic life and will \
gather information on the economic, !
political, and social problems con- |
fronting the people as a whole. The J
student will talk to many groups j
and will attempt to gain an overall
picture of the country's problems, j
Information as to the require
ments, costs, conditions, and fields I
covered in various universities will '
be gathered, and it is hoped that |
these surveys will encourage Amer
ican students to study in France.
FOREIGN SERVICE
Contacts will be made primarily j
in the scholastic and academic fields; I
however, contacts in other fields j
such as business, government, and j
the American Foreign 3ervicc will
also be available.
Paris will be the headquarters for
the survey student in France and !
from this central city he will make i
tours into other sections of the :
country. Visits will be made pri- I
marily into northern and eastern '
France.
