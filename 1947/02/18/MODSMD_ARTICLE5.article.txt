# Councils Plan Joint Session
## 
### 
Men's and Women's Councils will
meet in a special joint session this
afternoon at 4:30 to formulate a pol
icy that will cover student misuse
of the golf course, Ted Loe, newly
elected chairman of Men's Council,
announced yesterday.
The need for the policy, Lee said,
arose when the administration re
ported students using the course
without paying a greens fee. Two
women students, charged with not
paying the fee, will be brought be
fore the joint session.
Men's Council will hold its week
ly meeting at. the regular 3:15 pe
riod. Loe stated. In addition to the
usual traffic hearings, a tentative
hearing of a student charged with
drunkenness on campus has been
scheduled, he added.
