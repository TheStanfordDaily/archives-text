*al—A Sad and Lonely Word, Is If
Caramba, we ween! It was a long, tough fight, but the Cardinals man
aged to win six out of seven contests played on the Farm over the week
end. Rugby, tennis, baseball, jayvee basketball, basketball—only the grunt
nd groaners (wrestlers to you) had to take their lumps. It's been quite
•' ome time since Stanford athletes have done so well in so many sports in
uch a short length of time.
Of course, it's the basketball victories that have the whole campus
talking. It's little short of miraculous, the way Everett Dean and his boys
have confounded the experts. Expected to go winless. they have piled up
lour wins against four losses for a respectable .500 average.
But that doesn't tell the whole story. Out of the four games lost, three
could easily have been won. The Cards took the opener against UCLA and
were leading in the second tilt late in the game, but faded in the last
minutes. Cal took the Berkeley contest by one lone point. And recently,
in Los Angeles, the Trojans came from behind to win after Dave Davidson
and Bill Stephenson had been forced out of the game on personals. The
only game that couldn't have been won was the game played with Cal down
here on the Farm.
In other words, the Stanford cagers—with a little luck—could be lead
ing the Southern Division with 7 wins, 1 loss. That looks pf-etty good;
let':; try it again; Stanford leading the Southern Division with 7 wins, 1
l<>os. Well, it's nice to dream.
That brings up another hypothetical happenstance—lF Stanford clob
bers the Uelans twice this week-end, and IE Cal drops two games to the
Trojans, the league lead will be all tied up three ways. A sad and
lonely word, is if.
That pair of games Friday and Saturday was a little rich for ;tn old
man's blood; I can't stand very many more of those. Last-second finishes
are extremely bad for high blood pressure.
What Was It. Basketball or Hockey?
The boys turned in perhaps their best performances of the year. Not
their classiest, you understand; there were times when the proceedings
looked more like football, ice hockey, or lacrosse than legitimate basket
ball. But they showed an ability to come back and win after they were
mi the ropes. They outfought a fighting team.
No man can be picked out as an individual star. The strength of the
basketball team lies in its ability to function as a unit, to pull off the
classy Dean plays flawlessly. One could build a case for any of the starting
livi and claim he is the backbone of the team—which just goes to prove
that every one of them is necessary.
For instance. Babe Iliggins has averaged better than 13 points a game
for the past four games, and his floor play has been brilliant. I'll never
forget his dribble under the basket and back out again in the waning
moments of the Friday night contest, keeping perfect control of the ball
nil the time.
Then there's Dick Berlin, who guards his man so tightly he seldom gets
away, and who can be depended upon for a score at a crucial moment.
And Bill Stephenson is the high scorer, of course—he stands third in the
division, as a matter of fact, just behind Barksdale and Stanich of UCLA.
The abilities of Dave Davidson and Morley Thompson are too well known
lo necessitate further comment.
They're all necessary to the success of the team. If there was any hero
last week, it was Gus Chavalas, a lowly substitute. He went in and broke
up Troy's pressing defense, stealing the ball several times and giving
Davidson and Berlin their chance to score the winning buckets.
They're (*ood Officials, But Not Friday
Lloyd Leith and Wally Cameron are noted as the best officials in this
part of the country, but Friday they h;id—to put it charitably—an off night.
Late in the first half they lost all semblance of control, and the play de
generated into anarchy. There were numerous cases of hacking on the
p;irt of the Trojans which went unpunished, and several times the Stanford
dribbler charged into a set defense man without having a foul called
against him.
That particular foul—charging on offense—l have never seen called
out here on the Coast. It should be. Some will claim that if officials call
every loul they see, soon everybody on both teams will foul out and no
body will be left to play. I subscribe to the other theory—that if players
know they aren't likely to get away with any illegal subterfuges, they'll
be a lot more careful.
Leith and Cameron definitely were not unfair Friday night, and weren't
lavoring one team over the other; they merely missed a lot of obvious l'ouls
on both sides—which they should have caught.
1 was most disappointed in the actions of the Stanford rooting section
Saturday night. At one point there was protracted booing which lasted
: everal minutes; Lloyd Leith had to pick up the ball and wait for the
noise to subside before play could resume. He would have been justified
it: calling technicals as long as the pandemonium lasted—but that wouldn't
have been consistent unless he did it at Berkeley too.
On the play in question Leith was as wrong as a man could possibly
be. He was blocked oil behind and couldn't see what was really going
on. The Stanford man was trying to get out of a tight squeeze after being
pushed and hacked. But that's no excuse for such a disgusting exhibition
of ill feeling. The best officials available are hired. They do an honest
job of calling decisions exactly as they see them. They're entitled to
respect rather than castigation.
This reprimand may not be wholly justified, because I noticed that all
the people around me who were making the most noise were older people
who presumably are not Stanford students. But even so, it's something
that shouldn't be allowed to happen in the future; we don't want Stanford
to become a second Berkeley.
