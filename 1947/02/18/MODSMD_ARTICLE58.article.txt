# Stanford Nine Meets NavAir Here Today
## 
### 
The Farm's unbeaten baseball
varsity shoulders its way into the
midweek sports spotlight this after
noon when it takes on the Alameda
Naval Air Station nine on the Stan
ford diamond. Game time is set for
3:15.
The Cards, knee-deep in talent
for the first time since the war years,
boast a victory and a tie in their
only two starts to date. Harry Wol
ter's crew opened with a 5-5 stale
mate against the Weltner Motors,
then came back last Saturday to
score a close 8-7 win over the Por
tola Natives of San Francisco.
LETTERMEN A PLENTY
There are 13 lettermen on the
squad, nine back from last year's
team. Heading the parade are

Buck Brownson, and outfielder
Lloyd Merriman. Other numeral
winners are catchers Frank McGraw
and Dick Ahlquist; pitchers Dick
Flatland. Larry Wolfe, and Don
Pendergrass; infielders Ben Cardi
nalli, Bob Peters, Wayne Erickson,
and Ted Nell; and outfielders Ray
Winterhalter and Jim Wickershaw.
Walkup, Brownson, and Merriman
are the only three seemingly assur
ed of starting posts at this early
date. Buck and Lloyd highlighted
an otherwise dismal '46 season while
Walkup lettered in "42 and came
back to captain the '43 squad.
MERRIMAN A FIXTURE
Merriman's big bat and sure field
ing assure him of one of the outer
garden slots. Numeral men Winter
halter and Wickershaw and Lou
Gowans, Paul McCloskey, Don Ga
brielson, and John Wallace round
out the top candidates for the two
remaining outfield posts. Gowans
topped the Southern California Col
