# Cage Team Points For Bruin Weekend
## 
### ART SHAPIRO 
The "croocial" basketball seiies looms over the horizon as a
high-flying UCLA Bruin squad invades the Pavilion over the
week-end. Fresh from their twin sweep over the ex-conference
leader, California, the Uclans hold a full game grip on first place,
and boast of one of the highest scoring quintets to come out of
the Golden West in many a year. Sparked by the Gold Dust
twins, Davage Minor and Don

| Barksdale, and aided by set shot
j artist John Stanich, the Bruins have
the most potent offensive on the
Coast.
The Indians, who trounced the
: Uclans in their first encounter of
i the season, will base their hopes for
victory on defensive strategy and
I some well-coached plays. That slid
ing zone defense of t lie Cards held
Ihe "Westwood Wonders" to the
fewest number of points the Uclans
' have been able to amass against any
| conference opponent this year. With
j (he zone operating successfully and
1 the Indian attack in fairly decent
| shape the Cardinals should have a
; fine chance to drop the touted Bru
j ins for the count.
lIANNUM HAMSTRUNG
During last week's clashes with
i the lowly but still potent USC five,
the Stanford quintet demonstrated
I its ability to cope with any sort of
offense, as they threw the zone up
around Mr. Alex Hannum's ears,
i and forced the Trojans to shoot
I from away out yonder. With Han
i num fighting almost vainly to get
into the scoring column, the Trojans
were robbed of their main threat
and had to resort to a harrying game
in order to remain in the contests.
If Steve Stephenson, third highest
scorer in the league and defensive
star of the Red Machine, can dupli
| cate the job he turned in against
j Hannum, Laney of Santa Clara,
Hanger of California, and Barksdale
of the Uclans during the first two
meetings, the Cards will be in a
good position to snap the Bruin win
ning streak.
DEFENSIVE SUPERIORITY
With Babe Higgins, one of the
| finest guards in the conference, and
! aggressive Dick Berlin holding down
j the defensive slots, the Indian squad
j will have the superior defensive
| alignment. The question of the for
| ward positions, and the respective
! merits of Morley Thompson and
j Dave Davidson as opposed to Dave
| Buccola and John Stanich is a moot
j affair.
When Morley or Dave are hitting
! the netting, they represent one of
j the most potent one-two scoring
threats on the Coast. Buccola and
Stanich, their opposites on the UC
LA squad are experienced hoop
sters. Stanich, second highest scorer
in the conference after Barksdale,
personally lassoed the Indians in
; their second encounter as he buzzed
through 24 counters.
With the zone providing enough
I trouble for UCLA, and tin. l Stan-
I ford attack perking away with rea
, sonable efficiency, the local boys
I will be in a good position to create
j havoc in the conference race and
surprise the Fourth Estate from S.F.
to L.A.


BARE HIGGINS-tricky Stanford
eager—whose dazzling all-around
play was a major factor in the twin
USC cage is. Coach Everett Dean
is counting on Babe for heavy
duty against the league - leading
