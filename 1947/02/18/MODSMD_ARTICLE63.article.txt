## 
### 
NEW YORK. Feb. 17 (UP). Ray
(Sugar) Robinson, world w< 11(.• r—
weight champion, received ;i mild
slap on the wrist today from the
New York State Athletic Commis
sion for his iailure to report a fight
bribe offer of $25,000. The commis
sion surprised most boxing men by
suspending Robinson for only .'lO
days and by fining him only $500.
Since the great Negro fighter had
no bouts definitely scheduled within
the next month, his penalty actually
amounted to only a $500 fine. The

leniency of today's decision was a
sharp conirast to the severity of the
commission's verdict in the case iW
Rocky Graziano. Graziano's license
was revoked on Feb. 7 because ot
his failure to report three offers of
$100,000 bribes.
