## Maturity Carries a Responsibility 
### 
Today's Campus Opinion contains an inter
esting letter by a group of men from the Vil
lage in answer to the Daily editorial "Why
You Take a Chance on a Dance.''
These men state, in part, that "there are
clearly two distinct elements in the present
student body. One responds to the trumpet
ing of student leaders, and the other does not.
"We suggest that for a time the nominal
campus leaders and organizers are going to
have to get used to the idea, and plan accord
ingly. These leaders are indeed aware of
trouble, and have isolated it under the general
heading of 'Veterans.' But would not 'vary
ing degrees of maturity' be more correct?"
This smacks of just the attitude which we
deplored in yesterday's editorial.
We are only too ready to agree that there
are "varying degrees of maturity" in the stu
dent body at this time, and that the student
body can be generally divided into two dis
tinct groups.
Those of us on the Daily who are veterans
were struck with exactly the same impressions
when we first returned, so it is guite easy for
us to understand the stand-offish, slightly
amused tolerance with which many students
view so many campus activities.
Perhaps John Lardner, writing in the Feb. 8
issue of The New Yorker, is correct when he
says that:
"During and since the war, two parts of the
population—those who went overseas and
those who did not—have never completely
understood each other and have never been
able to explain satisfactorily to each other just
what they do feel and think."
There appears to exist in a situation such

as is present at Stanford now, the potentiali
ties if not the realities of the great problem of
"maladjustment to civilian life" which psy
chologists and sociologists have been predict
ing for the past few years.
There is certainly no objection to a person
conducting himself according to his degree of
maturity, and refusing to participate in activi
ties which he considers a waste of time, but
a fine line of distinction must be drawn be
tween activities which have a strong effect on
the trend of American government and soci
ety, and those which have little or no real
effect.
If this "second group" feels that student ac
tivities at Stanford are not egual to their "de
gree of maturity," and are not inclined to use
their maturity and experience for the general
improvement of society, then just what will
be their attitude toward activities of city, state,
and federal government?
If this "second group" takes the time to wit
ness the actions of the Palo Alto city council,
or the activities of the offices in the San Fran
cisco City Hall, or the San Francisco municipal
and federal courts, it will find "degrees of
maturity" that will put Excom on a plane
above the Stanford Academic Council.
These differences in maturity will continue
to crop up persistently in all activities outside
a college campus even more so than on a
college campus.
If everyone who felt he possessed a certain
degree of maturity, which placed him in a
special category, was to adopt a hands-off pol
icy toward activities whose management he
disliked, we shudder to think of what would
happen to society.
