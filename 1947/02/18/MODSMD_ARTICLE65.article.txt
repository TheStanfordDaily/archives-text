### CARL HEINTZ 
"Good Lord," I said, and clutched at the type
writer. "It's Emory Bellwether. You've come back."
"Naturally," the Great Man said, and perched
himself on the copy desk.
"Where did you come from, sir?" I asked. "No
one's seen you around here since Wilson Cannon was
editor back in Volume 99."
"Who is this bum?" the night editor snarled at me.
"Emory Bellwether, the Great Man. He's a Stan
lord tradition, that's all. He knows everything about
everything."
"As long as he's not a woman, it's all right," the
night editor said, and went back to his desk.
"What, pray tell, is the matter with him?" Mr.
Bellwether asked.
"He's a misogynist," I said.
"Hmm," the Great Man said. "He doesn't look
perverted to me. Now about Wilson Cannon."
"1 don't know. Last I heard he was Hying the
Hump into China."
The Great Man stretched his ample legs, and
glared ;it a passing woman who almost stumbled over
them. "Indeed. And what is your name, young
man?"
"Heintzc," I said.
"Ah, as in 57 Varieties, perhaps?"
"No, sir, Heintze. It only rhymes with pints. I
looked it up in a rhyming dictionary once just to be
sure."
"To be sure, Heintzy," the Great Man said. "Now
what is it you want to know about me?"
"Where have you been, sir? What have you been
doing? What is your message to the school?"
Emory shook the ashes from his cigarctte on my

shirt and smiled. "In the service of my country,
young man. The draft, you know. Many were called,
and unfortunately many were chosen."
"Yes, sir, I know." I said, and noted the Good
Conduct Medal pinned to his coat. "What branch?"
"I had the honor to serve in the 2272 nd Subter
ranean Mess Kit Repair Squadron."
"Gee, that's great, sir. The Air Corps, eh?"
The Great Man fingered his Good Conduct Medal
and smiled. "Yes, we were semi-mobile."
"What are you doing back here at school, sir?
On the G.I. Bill?"
"Quite right, my young friend." Mr. Bellwether
reached another Feelchester out of my pocket, and
borrowed my lighter. "I intend to receive a law de
gree and then go to Business School."
"You mean you're an educational hobo?" I asked.
"Really, young man, erâ€”ah, Hein-teaze. You
phrase these things so indelicately. I am merely
reaping the just reward for services rendered."
"Yes, sir." I lit my last cigarette just as Emory
reached for it. "What do you think of the school
these days?"
"Ugh!"
"And the women?"
"Ugh!" r "ZWS Zl
"Ah, then, nothing's changed?"
"Quite right. Well. I must be off, Hinze. Let me
know if you want any more advice."
The last. I saw of the Great Man. he was climbing
out the window after bouncing for a moment on the
night editor's head. But undoubtedly he would be
back again.
