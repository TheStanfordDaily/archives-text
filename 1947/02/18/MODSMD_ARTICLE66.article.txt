it is desirable they be short and to the point.,

To the Editor:
Your editorial of Feb. 12 was most thought-pro
voking to the men who write you now. Quite likely,
enough has been said on what constitutes the true
Stanford student body of today; publication of our
view is at your discretion —no radical views of a
minority so far, eh? But here is what we have to
say:
There are clearly two distinct elements in the
present student body. One responds to the trumpet
ing of student leaders, and the other does not. One
is useful to student government, and turns out to
.support the normal college activities planned for
them. The other, possibly numerically superior, seems
apathetic to the elections, dances, and traditions. The
reaction of the first group is the expected one, but
the reaction ol the second is causing tantrums in high
places.
We suggest that tor a time the nominal campus
leaders and organizers are going to have to get used
to the idea, and plan accordingly. These leaders are
indeed aware of trouble, and have isolated it under
the general heading of "veterans." But would not
"varying degrees of maturity" be more correct?
Call it psychological if you will it means the same
thing.
The first group is quite as mature as it should be.
It is interested in. and able to handle the student
activities. To the second group, the elections mean
almost nothing, the traditions are interesting some
things for discussion over midmorning coffee, and
only the major, soberly advertised dances are wor
thy of time. Note that the concerts, Tuesday Evening
Series, and the last Senior Ball are (or were) well
attended; conversely, very few of the "older boys"
showed up at the Sadie Hawkins Dance in short
pants. This last group i.s practiced at seeing through
eye-wash ol all varieties, printed or broadcast. .They
have been worked over by experts in their time.
They have become accustomed to thinking and
working for themselves. But at the same time, they
are capable of organization to a degree that would

frighten Ex Committee—e.g., Stanford Village, a
sober, friendly community.
So it would seem to be up to the first group and
their nominal leaders to preserve the activities, tradi
tions, and student government at Stanford. Don't
lose ground to any force under the present handi
cap; preserve it by making it work with those and
for those that are interested, and will profit most
from participation. Indeed, the second group wishes
this; they do not want the charm and spark of life
on the Farm to be denied the class of '55! This
situation will certainly pass.
Therefore we suggest that you of the first group
recognize the minor item, and concentrate your ef
forts on major activities, where you will get some
attendance from both groups. That you spend your
money for international trips on informed interna
tional speakers—who will do a better job of telling
you the facts you seem to want than the student you
send to get them—and let them struggle with the
job of imparting understanding to those who have
not seen, and therefore cannot possibly understand,
no matter who tells them. That you line up with the
Administration in trying to make this University a
superior place at which to study.
That you recognize the responsibility to Stanfdrd
which is yours, and that you devote your efforts to
organization, rather than to bickering and destroy
ing. That you consider before you schedule, be it a
religious week or whatever, whether you have the
interest of the current student body to back you.
Think about these things, act accordingly, and there
will lx> fewer editorial "Why's" printed in the Daily.
Finally, the second group does not wish to secede
from the first. It will join you where it can, socially
and otherwise. But please add a pinch of judgment
to all enthusiastic expectations!
