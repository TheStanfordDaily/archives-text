# Here's What Makes Ye Chappie Happy
## 
### LORRY LOKEY 
"Poor little care-worn timid heast,
Why arc you ill at ease?"
The lamb replied as he scratched
his hide,
"Please, sir, it is the fleece."
Chappie's Sept. 5, 11)00, edition
made the above pun public in one
ol the Old Boy's typical documents
of that era on comic poetry, anec
dotal wanderings, Gibson girl pin
ups, and several dozen jokes.
During the first years of this cen
tury a gag was funny if it was a
pun, had a surprise twist, or was
insulting. It was the delight of the
party and the Chaparral to come
across with:
"I've just had my dinner and
feel like a clam."
"Yes, luit you haven't shut up
yet."
The personal insult of today is the
"Then there was . . ." type, pointing
out the individual's physical or
mental defects. Take a Chappie
1942 example:
"Then there was the fellow with
a stern look because his mother
was frightened by the rear end of a
ferry boat."
Chappie "Now That" first ap
peared in 1899 as editorial chit
chats about events on campus. To
day this editorial section humorous
ly meditates on Chappie contents,
authors, and campus conditions.
Never one to ignore current
events in anecdotes of satire, the
humor mag has carried columns on
the 190G earthquake, prohibition,
and the Edison phonograph, to name
but a few.
Along about March 1907, the
Lazy Man gag was gaining ground
over the pun, and the Hammer and
Collin gang celebrated the occasion
with:
"Mow's work. Casey?"
"Oil, turrihle. I've been tryin*
to git me wife a job for three

weeks and can't do it. I'll starve
soon."
Many Chappie jokes and anec
dotes of that era were sandwiched
among corset, bicycle, Franklin au
j tomobile, and clothing advertise -
I ments, calling fashionable Stanford
scholars' attention to the ads.
Thirty years ago the gag rage of
humor magazines and minstrels ran
along the line of:
"Who was (hat woman I saw
you with last night?"
"That was no woman, that was
my wife."
Thanks to present-day originality
and abstract thinking, the Chappie
reader can now indulge in more
' sophisticated humor:
"Cette dame avec qui vous cticz
hier soir, e'est ma fcmnie."
Since 1916 rulers of the Chaparral
j dynasty have kidded other publiea
; tions lor their misprints and gram
j matical errors. One in the Oct. 1919
! issue concerned a girl who ran away
from home in her father's clothes.
Chappie quoted the city paper head
line:
"Fleas in Father's Clothes." That
item undoubtedly started from
! scratch.
Chappie's French legionnaires
i and four bearded professors first
| appeared in their respective car
toons in 1989 and 1940 to, in the
i words of the Old Boy, '"iill in extra
space with a cartoon that can handle

any gag line."
With paper easier to get, more
labor available, and thousands of
jokes to swipe from other publiea

tions, the Old Boy's last words while
munching on a Daily were: "There
will be another Chappie out this
week for one quahtah of a dollah."
