# Fee Violators To Be Fined
## 
### 
M r *n's and Women's Councils,
meeting in a special joint session
yesterday afternoon, decided upon
a $15 line for any student using the
University golf course without pay
ing the greens fee. The action came
after administration officials re
quested the councils to formulate a
policy to cover the recent increase
of student foe dodging.
Council members said the $15
would be for first violations, while
the Fundamental Standard would be
invoked against those charged with
additional fee jumping.
Men's Council, holding its regu
lar weekly meeting prior to the
joint session, heard 17 traffic vio
lation charges. Chairman Ted Lee,
in noting the increase in cases in
volving bicycles and motorbikes be
ing ridden on Quad, warned that
vehicles of any type are prohibited
within the Quad arches.
