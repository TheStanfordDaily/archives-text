# Dancers Talk, Tooâ€”On KSU
## 
### 
Three members of the Charles
Weidman dance company, which
will present a program of modern
dances tomorrow night at 8:15 in
Memorial Auditorium, will take part
in a radio interview at 8 tonight
over KSU.
Charles Weidman, nationally
known as a choreographer and so
loist. and acclaimed by critics as
"our leading male dancer," is cur
rently touring the West for the
first time in eight years.
Tickets for the concert arc on
sale at the Memorial Auditorium
ticket booth for $1.20. $1.80, and
$2.40.
"Weidman is particularly noted
for his moclern dance pantomime
and his unique ability for satire,'"
according to Mrs. Miriam Lidster,
Stanford modern dance instructor
who was formerly associated with
him.
The current Weidman repertoire
backs up his contention that
"dancing should amuse, enter
tain, and astonish audiences as
well as arouse them."
"David and Goliath" re-enacts
the well-known Biblical story of
the giant slain with a slingshot. "A
House Divided," a more serious
number, shows the problems of re
construction faced by Lincoln after
the Civil War. "And Daddy Was a
Fireman" reflects the Middle West
of the early 1900's that Weidman
knew as a boy, and is a biography
of his father, who actually was the
Lincoln, Neb., fire chief.
Peter Hamilton, young veteran,
will solo dance ".Jesse James," a
historical sketch of the bad man
from Missouri.
