# Milk Poll Spills Over Deadline
## 
### 
After a full week of operation, i
figures on the Encina milk poll were |
released yesterday by Stanford Bus- j
iness Manager A 1 112 E. Brandin. '
By giving students eating at
Encina Commons an opportunity
to purchase an extra bottle of
milk at cost price, the poll is at
tempting to determine the prac
ticality of the distribution of two
bottles of milk at every meal.
Because of the large number of
regular patrons absent, for rushing
activities during the first days of the
poll, however, a reliable picture of
the situation in the Commons has
not been obtained, according to Mr.
Brandin. Another week at least
will be needed before an accurate |
judgment can be made, he said.
The number of bottles sold at each j
meal is as follows:
Feb. 1: lunch, IX.X: dinner, '.122. :
Feb. 11: breakfast, .'52: lunch. 20*1;
dinner, 21X, Feb. 12: breakfast, 35;
lunch, IX!); dinner, 104. Feb. 13: j
breakfast, 25; lunch, 237; dinner,
302. Feb. 11, breakfast, 2X; lunch,
221; dinner, 23X. Feb. 15: break- j
fast, 23; lunch, 11!).
