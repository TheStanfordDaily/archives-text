# Wrestlers Groaning!

### LYNN CARMAN 
Interest in wrestling on the Farm
is apparently all but dead. One
would surmise as much after watch
ing Friday night's meet with San
Jose which was attended by a
skimpy crowd of less than thirty
odd persons and three wide-eyed
kids who tagged along with their
parents. A strictly amateur sport
which takes little more than a
wrestling mat, an interested coach
who knows some of the rudiments
of the game, and some candidates
for the squad in order to thrive is
slowly dying a death of suffocation
at Stanford.
Without a regular coach, ade
quate practice space, or visible
moral support from the Stanford
athletic department, plus the fur
ther handicap of a poorly co-or
dinated schedule, the Farm grap
plers have had to make the best
of a bail situation all season.
The only place that they can prac
tice is in a corner of the locker room
in the men's gym. And instead of
having even that little concession
to themselves, the grapplers have to
.share it with trackmen, baseball
candidates and other athletes who
dress in and wander through the
wrestling "room."
When Coach Ted Mumby saw
greener pastures over at San Jose
and left the Farm's wrestling helm
before the current season began,
little effort was made to keep him
here, and as far as we know, there
is no movement afoot to find a re
placement for him. One wonders
if there would even have been a
wrestling squad this season after
Mumby left, were it not for Stu
dent Coach Vcrn Jones.
As it is, Jones spends his after
noons coaching the varsity, handles
the team's finances, arranges all the
details of each meet —including eli
gibility questions—and still finds
time to take charge of wrestling
classes for the athletic department.
In other words, Stanford is getting
the services usually rendered by a
paid athletic instructor, and all for
free.
Somebody is going to mutter,
"Why all the fuss if no one is go
ing to come out to watch the wres
tling meets anyway?" Admitted
ly, a mat squad loaded with eight
Man Mountain Deans fighting with
collegiate rules wouldn't fill a
quarter of the Pavilion's scats.
But with proper handling, the
wrestling team could conceivably
draw enough fans to make the
team's meager expenses, which will
amount to about sixty dollars, more
than worth while. If UCLA and UC
can attract crowds of over three
hundred fans to a wrestling meet,
why can't Stanford?
One road to bigger crowds is
belter scheduling. There was no
reason why the matnien should
have to wrestle at home on the
same night as the USC-Stanford
cage classic, and then wrestle
away on another week-end when
there was no athletic attraction of
any sort on the campus.
A schedule like that doesn't give
wrestling a chance to prove that it
could attract a few fans. With the
cage schedule made up almost a year
before the season's start, it should
n't be hard to spot home wrestling
matches with Cal, UCLA, San Jose
and San Francisco State on favor
able dates.
In short, why do the wrestlers
have to do all the work to keep
their sport going when it should
be the responsibility of the ath
letic department to provide at
least a coach, good practice condi
tions and a good schedule? It
lakes a healthy environment for
any sport to grow, yet right now
Stanford's grapplers are operating
under handicaps which could eas
ily be removed.
Wrestling is a full-fledged mem
ber of Stanford's minor sports group,
and if it is such, it should be han
dled as a going minor sport. If it
isn't, then a few wrestling enthusi
asts are wasting their unappreciated
time trying to keep the sport alive.
