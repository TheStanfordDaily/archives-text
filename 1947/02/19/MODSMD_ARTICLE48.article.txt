# Cardinal Nine Routs Navy Air Team, 6-0
## 
### ART LUBIC 
A single by Hayes of the Alameda Naval Air Station in the eighth in
ning spoiled an otherwise perfect pitching performance by five Stanford
chtickers as the Farm's baseball varsity romped to an easy 6-0 triumph
over Alameda yesterday on the Sunken Diamond. It was the Indians'
second straight win.
Fiank Laßrum, Larrv Wolfe, Dave Dahle, Dick Flatland, and Dave

Stott combined to turn in the first
kalsomining of the year for the
Card nine. Laßrum and Wolfe wqre
on the hill for three innings apiece,
and Dahle, Flatland, and Stott fin
ished off with a round each, the
only hit coming off Flatland with
one out in the eighth.
ALL RUNS UNEARNED
Eight Alameda errors accounted
for all the Stanford runs. The lo
cals scored once in the opening
frame, twice in the second, once in
the fifth, and iced the contest with
a pair of markers in the eighth.
Th? first Indian run came in the
opening inning. With one down,
Bob Peters went to second when his
short fly was dropped in right field
and came on home when Frank Mc-
Graw's grounder went through the
N.A.S. second-sacker.
The jittery sailors committed
three or more miseries in the sec
ond and Harry Wolter's lads added
a brace of runs to the scoreboard.
A 1 Kircher got a life when the first
baseman dropped an infield to.ss and
Benny Cardinalli sacrificed him to
second. Laßrum was safe when
pitcher Lefty Steen bobled his bunt
and Bill Arce forced Laßrum at sec
ond. Kircher scoring on the pbjy.
Peters beat out an infield hit mov
ing Arce to second and Arce scored
a moment later when Buck Brown
son's drive went between the third
sacker's legs and into left field.
WINTERII ALTER SCORES
Ray Winterhalter opened the fifth
with a walk, went around to third
on Kircher's single, and scored the
fourth Stanford run on a wild pitch.
The final tallies came in the eighth
when Arce and Ted Nell drew passes
and both crossed the plate when
Alameda s third pitcher of the day
hurled Brownson's bounder over
third base and almost into the
stands.
