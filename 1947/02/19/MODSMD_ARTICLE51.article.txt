# D.U.'s Rampage To 61-8 Victory
## 
### 
D?lta Upsilon squad number two
turned on the power last night to
swamp a helpless Alpha Sigma Phi
outfit by the almost unbelievable
score of G!-8. It was the fourth con
secutive victory for the D.U.'s, who
now hold top place in League VIII
competition.
D.U.. holding a 21 -(> advantage
at halftime, scored at will and in
the second stanza limited the los
ers to only one field goal. Robert
"Spider" Elliot amassed a total of
22 points to lead the D.U. scoring
parade. Bob Frisbee, who racked
up eight points, turned in a cred
itable performance for the win
ners.
By dropping in CI tallies in last
night's contest with the Alpha Sigs.
the D.U.'s set a new scoring record
for this season's intramural basket
ball competition.
El Toro added another win to
its string of victories by ringing
up a well-earned 20-17 win over
a stubborn Kappa Alpha five. The
eating club boys now have a rec
ord of four wins against one loss.
James Brehler was high point
man for the K.A.'s with seven tal
lies.
Two varsity football aces, Lloyd
Merriman and Wayne Erickson,
with 10 and six counters respec
tively, starred as the Zeta Psi "B"
team coasted to an easy 28-18 win
over Theta Xi in League VIII play.
Erickson was a constant scor
ing throat and Merriman played a
bang-up game at center for the
Zetes.
The winners had to check a Theta
Xi rally in the last half to put the
game lon ice. Zeta Psi, which led
20-G at intermission, has won two
contests while dropping the same
n umber.
