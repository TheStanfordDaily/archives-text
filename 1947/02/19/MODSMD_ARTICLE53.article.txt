# Boxers Aiming At Repeat Win
## 
### 
Despite their tight-squeezing, last
minute 5-4 victory over the Cal Ag
gies last week, Stanford's lingmen
j have reason to be optimistic as they
j look forward to the return engage
ment between the two at ,
j Davis tomorrow night.
Cardinal mainstay Frank Hewitt j
I was held to a draw in his match
i with the Aggies' Randall Schachtili.
j Ferris Boothe, highly regarded Farm |
155-lb. stylist, took a decisive de
feat. and lightweight George Jess, j
| tiring badly in the last round, had
j to settle for a draw.
LOBDELL ORDERED OUT
In addition, the Aggies held-an
I unexpected point advantage before j
ling action got under way. Coach
! Clayton Frye had planned on for- j
i feiting the 1 *25-lb. fight, and in turn |
the Aggies had announced their in
tention of forfeiting the 1(55—1b. bout.
A few hours before the meet, Stan- !
ford's 130—lb. hope—Buzz Lobdell—
j was ordered out of action by the
| medics. This gave the Indians a
J deficit to make up.
Other factors played a part in the
! close score of the match—Hewitt's
I worry over his wife, ill in the hos-
I pital, and Jess' inability to go three
! rounds at peak efficiency.
POINT TO WIDE MARGIN
These are factors that Coach Frye
and his pugilistic proteges hope to
cancel out by tomorrow night.
With Jess in improved physical >
condition and with Lobdell back in i
action, Stanford's boxers figure to i
register a convincing win at Davis |
tomorrow, and make the margin of j
victory a little wider this time.
