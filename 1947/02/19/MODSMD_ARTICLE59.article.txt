## Perfection in Two Months? 
### 
Stanford's radio station, KSU, ends a two
month trial period this week and a summing
up is now in order. Bob Eilers and his staff
are going to the students for an evaluation of
KSU's service during the initial two-month pe
riod. Next Monday evening 500 to 600 ques
tionnaires will be distributed at house meet
ings of men's and women's living groups.
These questionnaires will deal with prefer
ence as to KSU program content, criticisms of
announcers, suggestions for KSU manage
ment, and other pertinent questions—l 7 in all
dealing with students' response to the last
two months of operation.
KSU staff members are looking for criticism,
and the poll is designed to channel student
dissatisfaction into forms which can be re
duced to cold, statistical estimates of the sta
tion's worth. From these estimates Eilers
hopes to initiate improvements and in this lies
the core of the matter. KSU is in the building
stage. If there are weaknesses in program

presentation; if reception is at times poor; if
program content is unsatisfactory it is because
perfection cannot be reached in two months.
The Daily has been trying for fifty-five years.
Student broadcasting is a new field. But it
isn't so new that KSU operators have taken a
flyer on something that has never had a
chance to prove itself on other university
campuses. On the West Coast USC operates
a carrier current station; COP has both an FM
and carrier current outlets; and Washington
State College has operated a 5,000-watt station
successfully for several years.
In the final analysis, success of the station
depends on student listener support. It has
already proved itself from the viewpoint of
student participation—more than 150 applica
tions for staff positions have been received by
Eilers—and it is now established as a new
field of outlet for student talent. Listener sup
port will grow as campus coverage widens;
listener support will improve as staff experi
ence increases.—B.H.
