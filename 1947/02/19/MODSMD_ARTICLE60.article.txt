### DAN ENDSLEY 
The idea of selling stock in a business was origi
nally conceived as a method of providing capital for
that business, to provide the necessary plant and
equipment. If was merely a means by which pro
duction could be furthered.
In all too many cases throughout the past cen
tury, the selling of stock has come to be the end in
itself, rather than merely a means to an end.
The public sale of stock fills a basic need under
the capitalistic system; the modern industrial plant
is so expensive that one man—or group of men—finds
it virtually impossible to finance a new concern un
aided. A stock issue solves the problem by opening
up the vast reservoir of public savings; thus, the
sale of stock is productive. In addition, it furnishes
a source of investment for small accumulations of
capital which would otherwise lie dormant.
But men seeking their own personal gain have
again and again used this legitimate establishment
merely as an arena where, by the use of their wits,
they profit at the expense of others—meanwhile
contributing nothing to the nation's economy. This
practice, at its best, is parasitical.
In the past, monumental instances of bilking the
public have gone unpunished because there was no
law covering the situation. The "bull" operators
would force the market up, then unload. The "bear"
operators would force it down, then buy. The stock
market became little more than a place for legalized
gambling on a gigantic scale.
Often fraudulent stock issues would be floated,
aggrandizing the fortunes of the issuers—embezzlers,
to give them their right name—at the expense of
people anxious to make an honest investment. That
situation was remedied to a great extent by the

establishment of the Securities and Exchange Com
mission, which forced registration of stocks before
they could go on sale. During the war, purchase of
securities on margin was outlawed.
Those were steps in the right direction, of course,
but they don't go far enough. This new Congress
has a chance to do a great service for its country and
for capitalism by passing legislation which will make
it more difficult for a gambler to operate on thej
stock exchange. I don't know how they can do it; |
I merely know that it is necessary.
The Republican party is in power now. In the !
past they have been noted for their friendship with i
business, if not with rugged individualism. This is [
their chance to show they represent the entire na
tion and the American system, not just one small
group.
It won't be easy, because the speculators have
gained great power; they have strong lobbies. They
have been feeding off the public for decades, and
have no intention of stopping. Gambling is frowned
upon in this country as a vice; yet. these men gamble
millions—and they are looked upon as good citizens,
as pillars of society. A player in a two-bit poker
game, however, is just a bum. That is paradoxical,
but perhaps it proves the old adage that says, "If
you're going to do something dishonest, do it on a
monumental scale."
To speculate, according to Webster, is to "enter
a venture the profits of which are conjectural or
subject to chance." On the other hand, to peculate
is to "steal or misappropriate moneys, esp. public
moneys, entrusted to one's care." As things have
worked out, the two operations are as similar as
their names.
