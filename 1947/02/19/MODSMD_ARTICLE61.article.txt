To the Editor:
John Hirleman's letter in the Daily (Feb. 12) on
the proposed A.S.S.U.-I.S.C. student observer trips
to European countries was accurate but incom
plete. His four points were:
(1) Such trips will not bring an internationalistic
awareness. (2) People will be prevented from seeing
in European countries anything of real significance.
(.'>) The student body will be uninterested as usual
when the observers return. (4) Authorities here at
home can give a great deal of information on for
eign conditions. 1 should like to add in this letter
several important points which I think Hirleman
missed.
The concept of student observer trips as set forth
by I.S.C. seems to me the work of juvenile minds
with vague and romantic yearnings in the direction
of international co-operation, and with little real
ity. 1 say this for the following reasons:
1. The people of Europe neither want nor need
young, handsome, eager, well - dressed, well - fed,
smug, complacent Americans observing them. What
they do want and need is food, clothing, coal, raw
products, the chance to work, produce, and regain
their self-respect. Almost all they have had since
the war is observation, superficial and momentary
commiseration, and very little action. Europeans are
beginning to teel like the most grotesque exhibits
in some spectacular zoo. They are also beginning to
feel the compelling aspects of new. and from our
point of view dangerous, political systems. The
first thing Europeans need is freedom for self-re
spect—and this means freedom from the sentimental
and ineffectual observation of young romanticists
who, when the period of observation is over, beat a
hasty retreat to the land of plenty.
2. While the observers are there, they do added
harm in using food and transportation desperately
needed for the peoples of the countries they are in.
What the observers would consume in the way of
raw materials and services would not begin to be
paid for by what they would give. Actually, what
WOULD they give? Nothing, that I can see.
3. But the point is that they will gain something
lor us. for our understanding. This point seems to
me equally false. THERE IS NO NEED FOR STU
DENT OBSERVERS. All the knowledge, all the
facts that university students need or could assimi
late to help them formulate a basis for international
co-operation (or whatever else their idealistic goal
might be), is already present in the University.
Why send students, waste our money, further con
tribute to the Europeans' lack of self-respect, use
European food and other resources, when we have
all the information we need right here, immediately
present at our finger-tips, and do not use it? I think
immediately of the following people whom I know
personally on this campus who are crammed with a

ber ot writer. There is no limit on words but

first-hand knowledge of the specific areas they rep
resent:
a) A Norwegian male graduate student who
went to a German university through the year
1944.
I>) A Dutch girl who lived through all the Ger
man occupation.
c) A professional educator from the Philippines ,
who was a guerilla during the war.
(I) A graduate student from India (of whom I
there are many others) who knows that conipli- i
rated political and social situation very thoroughly. !
e) A Persian who spent his youth in Russian
schools in Moscow.
112) An American soldier who spent 40 months in
Japanese prison camps.
This is a very incomplete list of the people whom
I know, personally, on campus. The number actually
here, from China, India, Europe, .etc., who have first
hand information, and who would be willing, if not
anxious, to give that information to others, is more
than could ever be used. Why do we not use these
people, instead of sending others, even if well quali- j
fied. on a cursory, superficial, and unnecessary trip,
dissipating the time, energy, and resources of all
concerned?
Finally, I feel compelled to mention, aside from
the great number of people who have special infor
mation, the several thousand G.l.'s at present in the
University, who, collectively, have been in almost
every part of the world. Have they been heard from?
Have their experiences been told? My own case
will prove my point. I am intimately acquainted with
families in England, France, and Belgium, from every
social level: peasants, middle-class tradesmen, Cath
olic priests, university professors, Communist or
ganizers, industrialists. I know their ideas and their
aspirations. I also know other experiences Europe
provides: the thrill of seeing peoples liberated after
years of tyranny and suffering; the stench of Bu
chenwald; skinny kids eating ravenously from gar
bage cans; and helpless old women freezing to death.
And now it is proposed to observe this more. There
is no more need for observation—it is a sufficiently
complete process. Action is now needed. So long
as we continue to observe and fail to provide both J
material ne"ds and the dynamics of the way of life j
we think best, we will see the peoples of Europe
sinking into even greater misery, and being forced, in
sheer desperation, to turn from the democratic way
of life we profess to hold so dear, and do so little
about, to a way of life which will inevitably threaten
ours, and the stability of the entire world. The
A.S.S.U.-I.S.C. plan is. however glossy the surface,
a plan of vaguely idealistic and misled people which
will actually do harm where it purports to help.

This is a very incomplete list of the people whom
I know, personally, on campus. The number actually
here, from China, India, Europe, .etc., who have first
hand information, and who would be willing, if not
anxious, to give that information to others, is more
than could ever be used. Why do we not use these
people, instead of sending others, even if well quali- j
fied. on a cursory, superficial, and unnecessary trip,
dissipating the time, energy, and resources of all
concerned?
Finally, I feel compelled to mention, aside from
the great number of people who have special infor
mation, the several thousand G.l.'s at present in the
University, who, collectively, have been in almost
every part of the world. Have they been heard from?
Have their experiences been told? My own case
will prove my point. I am intimately acquainted with
families in England, France, and Belgium, from every
social level: peasants, middle-class tradesmen, Cath
olic priests, university professors, Communist or
ganizers, industrialists. I know their ideas and their
aspirations. I also know other experiences Europe
provides: the thrill of seeing peoples liberated after
years of tyranny and suffering; the stench of Bu
chenwald; skinny kids eating ravenously from gar
bage cans; and helpless old women freezing to death.
And now it is proposed to observe this more. There
is no more need for observation—it is a sufficiently
complete process. Action is now needed. So long
as we continue to observe and fail to provide both J
material ne"ds and the dynamics of the way of life j
we think best, we will see the peoples of Europe
sinking into even greater misery, and being forced, in
sheer desperation, to turn from the democratic way
of life we profess to hold so dear, and do so little
about, to a way of life which will inevitably threaten
ours, and the stability of the entire world. The
A.S.S.U.-I.S.C. plan is. however glossy the surface,
a plan of vaguely idealistic and misled people which
will actually do harm where it purports to help.

John Hirleman's letter in the Daily (Feb. 12) on
the proposed A.S.S.U.-I.S.C. student observer trips
to European countries was accurate but incom
plete. His four points were:
(1) Such trips will not bring an internationalistic
awareness. (2) People will be prevented from seeing
in European countries anything of real significance.
(.'>) The student body will be uninterested as usual
when the observers return. (4) Authorities here at
home can give a great deal of information on for
eign conditions. 1 should like to add in this letter
several important points which I think Hirleman
missed.
The concept of student observer trips as set forth
by I.S.C. seems to me the work of juvenile minds
with vague and romantic yearnings in the direction
of international co-operation, and with little real
ity. 1 say this for the following reasons:
1. The people of Europe neither want nor need
young, handsome, eager, well - dressed, well - fed,
smug, complacent Americans observing them. What
they do want and need is food, clothing, coal, raw
products, the chance to work, produce, and regain
their self-respect. Almost all they have had since
the war is observation, superficial and momentary
commiseration, and very little action. Europeans are
beginning to teel like the most grotesque exhibits
in some spectacular zoo. They are also beginning to
feel the compelling aspects of new. and from our
point of view dangerous, political systems. The
first thing Europeans need is freedom for self-re
spect—and this means freedom from the sentimental
and ineffectual observation of young romanticists
who, when the period of observation is over, beat a
hasty retreat to the land of plenty.
2. While the observers are there, they do added
harm in using food and transportation desperately
needed for the peoples of the countries they are in.
What the observers would consume in the way of
raw materials and services would not begin to be
paid for by what they would give. Actually, what
WOULD they give? Nothing, that I can see.
3. But the point is that they will gain something
lor us. for our understanding. This point seems to
me equally false. THERE IS NO NEED FOR STU
DENT OBSERVERS. All the knowledge, all the
facts that university students need or could assimi
late to help them formulate a basis for international
co-operation (or whatever else their idealistic goal
might be), is already present in the University.
Why send students, waste our money, further con
tribute to the Europeans' lack of self-respect, use
European food and other resources, when we have
all the information we need right here, immediately
present at our finger-tips, and do not use it? I think
immediately of the following people whom I know
personally on this campus who are crammed with a

This is a very incomplete list of the people whom

here, from China, India, Europe, .etc., who have first

Have their experiences been told? My own case
will prove my point. I am intimately acquainted with
families in England, France, and Belgium, from every
social level: peasants, middle-class tradesmen, Cath
olic priests, university professors, Communist or
ganizers, industrialists. I know their ideas and their
aspirations. I also know other experiences Europe
provides: the thrill of seeing peoples liberated after
years of tyranny and suffering; the stench of Bu
chenwald; skinny kids eating ravenously from gar
bage cans; and helpless old women freezing to death.
And now it is proposed to observe this more. There
is no more need for observation—it is a sufficiently
complete process. Action is now needed. So long
as we continue to observe and fail to provide both J
material ne"ds and the dynamics of the way of life j
we think best, we will see the peoples of Europe
sinking into even greater misery, and being forced, in
sheer desperation, to turn from the democratic way
of life we profess to hold so dear, and do so little
about, to a way of life which will inevitably threaten
ours, and the stability of the entire world. The
A.S.S.U.-I.S.C. plan is. however glossy the surface,
a plan of vaguely idealistic and misled people which
will actually do harm where it purports to help.

John Hirleman's letter in the Daily (Feb. 12) on
the proposed A.S.S.U.-I.S.C. student observer trips
to European countries was accurate but incom
plete. His four points were:
(1) Such trips will not bring an internationalistic
awareness. (2) People will be prevented from seeing
in European countries anything of real significance.
(.'>) The student body will be uninterested as usual
when the observers return. (4) Authorities here at
home can give a great deal of information on for
eign conditions. 1 should like to add in this letter
several important points which I think Hirleman
missed.
The concept of student observer trips as set forth
by I.S.C. seems to me the work of juvenile minds
with vague and romantic yearnings in the direction
of international co-operation, and with little real
ity. 1 say this for the following reasons:
1. The people of Europe neither want nor need
young, handsome, eager, well - dressed, well - fed,
smug, complacent Americans observing them. What
they do want and need is food, clothing, coal, raw
products, the chance to work, produce, and regain
their self-respect. Almost all they have had since
the war is observation, superficial and momentary
commiseration, and very little action. Europeans are
beginning to teel like the most grotesque exhibits
in some spectacular zoo. They are also beginning to
feel the compelling aspects of new. and from our
point of view dangerous, political systems. The
first thing Europeans need is freedom for self-re
spect—and this means freedom from the sentimental
and ineffectual observation of young romanticists
who, when the period of observation is over, beat a
hasty retreat to the land of plenty.
2. While the observers are there, they do added
