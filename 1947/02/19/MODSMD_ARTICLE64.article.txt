# East Is East, West Is West' Out-Dated

Welding together of East and
West with the emphasis on China is
the aim of two organizations on
campus the Chinese Students' Club
and the Chinese-American Friend
ship Group.
Larger of the two groups is the
I Chinese Students' Club, started in
1 1916 and currently listing 42 mem
bers. Headquarters for their activ
ities is the clubhouse at 528 Salva
! tierra.
Although nominally composed of
students from China, actually the
; main body of members are natives
j of America. A survey of club mem
bers shows but 12 from China, nine
from places outside the United
i States, and the rest from California
and various parts of the country,
j Of the students from China, half
j came on government scholarships
j and all are in graduate work.
Typical is Lin Ch'ung Ming, grad
| uate student in engineering from
Kwangtung, China. Interestingly
j enough, his name translated means

"striving for brightness." Para
doxically, lie finds American stu
dents much more interested in in
ternational affairs than the average
student in China, who seems too in
tent on acquiring knowledßo. He
believes that the present govern
ment in China and the Communists
will not compromise anil the best
solution is to let them fight it out.
Lin graduated from Northwestern
University in China and later taught
at Nanking University and in
Chungking. He is anxious that
Americans get the right point of
view about China.
Finding out the club's history and
aims proved difficult. Alumnus F.
Y. Chuck, '23, was finally contacted
and supplied the following infor
mation.
The club was originally part of a
nation-wide organization known as
the Chinese Student Alliance, which
dissolved in 1926. It was in the pe
riod following the first World War
when Orientals were barred from
school dormitories that the idea was
formulated for a Chinese Clubhouse.

Through the initiative of a group of
students money was raised and the
house built in 1919.
At present the clubhouse serves
as a meeting place and a spot where j
newly arrived students can orient
themselves to University life.
The other group on the campus j
Ls the Chinese-American Friendship 1
Group. In the short time since it I
was organized last winter quarter.,
it has managed to accomplish two i
things: it has established the China
Affairs discussion group which
meets on alternate Mondays at the
Women's Clubhouse to hear speak- j
ers talk on various aspects of China.
This group is still active but goes
under the name of the snonsnrinp 1

group now; it also started the bridge
club last summer.
Aim of the club is, as the name
implies, the furtherance of friend
ship between Americans and Chi
nese. Specifically it strives to pro
mote the sharing of knowledge and
experience of the students of each
country for the mutual benefit o!
all concerned.

meets on alternate Mondays at the
Women's Clubhouse to hear speak- j
ers talk on various aspects of China.
This group is still active but goes
under the name of the snonsnrinp 1

group now; it also started the bridge
club last summer.
Aim of the club is, as the name
implies, the furtherance of friend
ship between Americans and Chi
nese. Specifically it strives to pro
mote the sharing of knowledge and
experience of the students of each
country for the mutual benefit o!
all concerned.
Welding together of East and
West with the emphasis on China is
the aim of two organizations on
campus the Chinese Students' Club
and the Chinese-American Friend
ship Group.
Larger of the two groups is the
I Chinese Students' Club, started in
1 1916 and currently listing 42 mem
bers. Headquarters for their activ
ities is the clubhouse at 528 Salva
! tierra.
Although nominally composed of
students from China, actually the
; main body of members are natives
j of America. A survey of club mem
bers shows but 12 from China, nine
from places outside the United
i States, and the rest from California
and various parts of the country,
j Of the students from China, half
j came on government scholarships
j and all are in graduate work.
Typical is Lin Ch'ung Ming, grad
| uate student in engineering from
Kwangtung, China. Interestingly
j enough, his name translated means

"striving for brightness." Para
doxically, lie finds American stu
dents much more interested in in
ternational affairs than the average
student in China, who seems too in
tent on acquiring knowledßo. He
believes that the present govern
ment in China and the Communists
will not compromise anil the best
solution is to let them fight it out.
Lin graduated from Northwestern
University in China and later taught
at Nanking University and in
Chungking. He is anxious that
Americans get the right point of
view about China.
Finding out the club's history and
aims proved difficult. Alumnus F.
Y. Chuck, '23, was finally contacted
and supplied the following infor
mation.
The club was originally part of a
nation-wide organization known as
the Chinese Student Alliance, which
dissolved in 1926. It was in the pe
riod following the first World War
when Orientals were barred from
school dormitories that the idea was
formulated for a Chinese Clubhouse.

Through the initiative of a group of
students money was raised and the
house built in 1919.
At present the clubhouse serves
as a meeting place and a spot where j
newly arrived students can orient
themselves to University life.
The other group on the campus j
Ls the Chinese-American Friendship 1
Group. In the short time since it I
was organized last winter quarter.,
it has managed to accomplish two i
things: it has established the China
Affairs discussion group which
meets on alternate Mondays at the
Women's Clubhouse to hear speak- j
ers talk on various aspects of China.
