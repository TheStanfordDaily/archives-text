# GOP Cuts Budget; CIO Delays Strike
## Vote Due Today On Proposed Cut 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 (UP).—
House Republicans voted today to
slash President Truman's 1948 fiscal
budget by $6,000,000,000 after one
member publicly accused GOP Sen
ators of cowardice in attempting to 1
hold the cut to $4,500,000,000.
Appropriations Chairman John
Taber, of New York, said the House I
members appeared to be unanimous- I
ly determined to stand behind the I
recommendation of the Joint Con
gressional Budget Committee for a
$31,500,000,000 ceiling on federal
spending in the next fiscal year, as
compared with Mr. Truman's re- !
quest for $37,500,000,000.
The action came at a Republican
conference summoned to close gaps
in GOP ranks before the House
votes on the proposed budget cut
tomorrow. Only an informal stand
ing vote was taken, and the action
was not binding.
Senate debate on the proposed re
duction opened today amid warn- [
inns by Sen. George D. Aiken, R..
Vt.. that his party "must deliver the
goods" if it hopes to elect a Presi
dent in 194 H. He accused some GOP
leaders of "irresponsible slashing of
expenditures," and said "their imag
inary mandate does not come from ;
the people."
The Senate is expected to debate
the budget issue for at least a week, j
The House must make a decision j
tomorrow under a rule limiting de- j
bate to four hours and banning at
tempts to lower the budget com- j
mittee's recommendation.
