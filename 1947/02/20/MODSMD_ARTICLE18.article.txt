# Vocom Hears Talk On 'Psychology for You'
## 
### 
Would - be psychologists met in
the Women's Clubhouse last night
to bear Dr. Ernest Hilgard and Dr.
Kathcrine Bradway suggest "What
About Psychology for You?" The
talk was one of a series sponsored by
Vocom.
Dr. Hilgard is head of the De
partment of Psychology here, and
Dr. Bradway is on the staff of the
Child Guidance Clinic of the Chil
dren's Hospital in San Francisco.
The war created plenty of jobs
for psychologists, and there arc still
plenty available, Dr. Hilgard ex
plained. An increasing amount of
training is becoming necessary as
the field expands, however.
ADVANCED DEGREE NEEDED
An advanced degree is a requisite
for most positions. Both speakers
emphasized that. Job opportunities
for women with only A.B. degrees
arc extremely limited.
In psychology, it is worth $1,000
a year more to be a man. Dr. Brad
way stated. Women on the average
receive that much less than men in
comparable positions. For women,
a doctorate brings about $700 a year
more than a Master's degree.
MARRIAGE NO HANDICAP
Marriage is not a handicap in
procuring psychological conditions.
Over half of the women in psychol
ogy are married, and most find it
an asset in their work.
Although graduate work is highly
desirable in psychology, some posi
tions are obtainable with the A.B.

degree. These arc usually semi
clerical or only semi - professional
Civil service, personnel work, reha
bilitation, and psychomctry are al
possible fields.
Advancement in these fields is or
the administrative rather than tin
professional level.
