# "Vagueness' of ISC Criticized; Excom Hears Student Attack
## 
### JACK OGLESBY 
The heavy artillery of criticism opened up the International Student Committee last night
as both members of Excom and students in the audience accused the plans for international ac
tivities as being vague and too general.
Taking the heaviest pounding was the plan for sending students abroad. Millie Edwards,
j vice-president, stated that the I.S.C.'s aim was unknown except in the most general terms.

j Referring to the Campus Opinion'
; letter in yesterday's Daily, she said
that a specific plan was needed to
answer these questions that stu
dents were asking.
COUNTER-ATTACK
Countering the attack, President
Martin Anderson said, "I think it's
I damn foolishness to give one, two,
three answers" on something having
to do with human relations.
Redefining the result expected
from sending students abroad, he
said, "These students won't get an
answer to everything."
However, he continued, one lias 1
to start somewhere. This first trip
would merely lay the foundation. I
Six weeks is not very long, hut j
these first students can make eon
tacts and find out enough so bet
ter action can be taken later, he
said.
The possibility of expanding the
program to include six-month stu
dent exchanges with foreign eoun
; tries was put forward by Anderson.
"The State Department is for the
plan and I think basically it is a
i good idea," he said.
Frank Creed?, Toyon reprcsenta-
I live, criticized Excom as having
i adopted a "paternal attitude." He
! said that the majority of students
i were not enthusiastic about the
j I.S.C.
"If they don't want it, we'll kill
it." said Anderson. "I believe the
student body as a whole wants it.
however."
PETITION CIRCULATED
When advised that a petition was
being circulated in Toyon for doing
away with the trip plans and using
the money for other international
activities, he replied, "Petitions are
easy to get signed."
Addressing the members of Ex
com, he charged them to "go out to
! your areas and find out how the
i students feel." He asked for a re
port on this next week.
This move was criticized by a
student in the audience, Dixon Dern,
j as being backwards.
"You've got to present a program
j first and then take the poll," he
said.
DAILY LETTERS
Bob Iloyt, al.so in the audience,
led a counter - attack against the
I anti - I.S.C. group by stating that
| people wre getting carried away
! by the letters that have appeared
| in the Daily recently. If these crit
| ics want to really do something, he
I said, "why don't they put up some
| thing themselves?"
In an attempt to answer both con
structive and destructive critics,
Anderson said. "They've got to gam
ble a little on this."
Anderson admitted that there
was no definite program which
' could be pointed to as a complete
over-all plan for the present and
the future. "How can we plan for
the future until we have the
groundwork laid?" he asked.
NEED INFORMATION
"The first group to be sent abroad
! will give us some of the answers as
, to what we can do and we cannot
j make further plans until wr have
) the information that they will bring
I us," he maintained.
The outburst of pro and con argu
ments followed the reading of a re
\ port on international campus activ
ities by Beth Mac Vicar, who was
appointed by Excom to look into
the various organizations here and
make recommendations for co-or
dination.
Terming her report "prelimi
nary," Miss Mac Vicar recommend
ed (hat the students be presented
with something "concrete" to
counterbalance the present "idcal
j ism."
RECOMMENDS CO-ORDINATION
She strongly recommended the
building up of the idea of sending
bundles overseas. This would b r >
carried on in conjunction with pres
ent "Y" activities. She also sug
gested that a foreign university be
| "adopted" as several other
throughout the nation have done.
Miss Mac Vicar was instructed to
j find out what the possibilities of
j having a contribution drive next
quarter were, and to report on this
I at the next Excom meeting.
INFORMATION FILE
She also recommended that an in
formation file be established. Such
; a file, she saidr would contain infor
j mation about jobs overseas, schools,
j relief work, housing, transporta
! lion, and visas.
As a third recommendation, she
advised that discussion groups be
improved by having such organiza
tions go to living groups around the
campus for their meetings, conduct
ed by student chairmen, instead of
being held as they are now.
These recommendations were
approved by Excom. Discussion be
gan when Miss Mac Vicar brought
up the outline of the I.S.C.
