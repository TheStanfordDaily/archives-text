# CIO Offers To Negotiate

### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 19 (UP).-!
CIO President Philip Murray triod j
to head oIT strike-control legislation |
today by offering to meet AFL Pres- j
ident William Green before the:
Senate Labor Committee to nego
tiate an agreement for settling all |
jurisdictional' disputes.
The silver - haired CIO chieftain j
protested all pending labor bills as'
an attempt to "shackle" the work
ers and punish them for their "pa- i
triotic duty" during and after the!
war.
His testimony was punctuated by j
sharp exchanges with Sen. Joseph |
H. Ball, R., Minn., author of most of
the proposed labor curbs, including i
a ban on jurisdictional strikes.
Conceding that there was "no
moral justification" for jurisdic
tional disputes, Murray reported j
that he had gotten nowhere trying !
to get together with Green to work
out a remedy.
Murray took a different tack j
from Green, concentrating his fire j
on current, economic trends. He
warned that Congress would thrust j
the nation toward economic catas- I
trophe if it attempts to weaken un
ions rather than monopolies.
