## 
### 
International Discussion Group met for the first time in Roblo
last night to discuss the problem of "Argentine Threat to
Peace." Chuck Martin and Ralph Hovis were the guest leaders
while Bill Shepherd acted as moderator, replacing Beth Mac
Vicar.
Opening the discussion, Martin said that United States for-

eign policy toward Argentina is be
ing guided along two streams: Mi.
Braden supported by Byrnes and
Truman wants t<> take unilateral ac
tion against Argentina, while Mes
sersmith supported by Van den hern
advocates the good neighbor policy.
PERON NAZI SUPPORTER?
Quoting some passages from llie
State Department Blue Book issued
just before the Argentine elections,
Martin said that Braden regarded
Peron as a supporter of Nazi Ger
many. "During a.s well as after the
war, Peron lias been sheltering Nazi
agents," Braden said.
Martin went on to say that re
cently Argentina has been putting
economic pressure on the neighbor -
ing small countries. "His rise is
very similar to that of Mussolini in
Italy," said Martin, "following in
his footsteps, Peron is also using the
legislature as a rubber stamp to rat
ify his own actions."
THE U.S. PROBLEM
The problem before the United
States is how to support democratic
countries and how to stop the
growth of Fascism and totalitarian
ism," Martin said.
Ralph Hovis, taking tff" opposite
point of view, maintained that there
is no concrete evidence to prove
that Peron is a Fascist. "On the
other hand, he might be trying to
do some good for the people of Ar
gentina," he said.
A general discussion followed
these talks. Attacking the Argen
tine policy of the Unilod Slates, one
student, said thai the State Depart
ment is not, motivated as much by
high ideals as personal ends. "Why
don't we interfere with other Latin
American nations which are even
less democratic than Argentina?"
he asked.
