# Seek Humble Job, Doyle Tells Girls
## 
### 
Finding adequate residences for
women students has been one of the
post-war problems at Stanford Uni
versity. Miss Anastasia Doyle told
members of the Stanford Mothers'
Club Tuesday.
In order to allow as many eligible
women as possible to attend Stan
lord, some of the standards formerly
governing residences have been
more liberally interpreted, the as
sistant counselor for women told the
mothers at the meeting in Toyon
Hall.
Miss Doyle also.advised mothers
to aid their daughters in being
"more realistic, more intelligent, and
more humble" as they look to a fu
ture vocation. She recommended
that women go into social work,
nursing, teaching, and related fields.
Miss Christine Ricker, director of
the University dining halls, spoke
on the dining situation at Stanford.
During the business meeting por
tion of the club, the mothers were
told of a new club project to fur
nish two reception rooms at Stan
ford Village.
