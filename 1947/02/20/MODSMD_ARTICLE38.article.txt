# Coast Skiers Hold Carnival at Reno
## 
### 
Every year the Reno Winter Car
nival brings together the skiers of
every major school on the Pacific
Coast to compete in downhill, sla
lom, jumping, and cross-country
events.
Since there is an acute shortage
of tourist accommodations, skiers
who plan to attend this Carnival
are advised to try motels in the
Reno area, as most of the hotels are
j already filled.
The week-ends events include a
! meeting of all contestants at the
I Student Union Building, open
| houses at Nevada sororities, a cross
j country race at White Hills, follow
j ed by a ski-jumping contest, a Ski
i ers' Banquet and the Snow-Ball.
A Carnival Queen will be chosen
j from a visiting school and will be
crowned at the dance which will be
a no date affair. Awards will be
given to the school with the largest
representation.
Students interested should con-
I suit the list of available motels
which is posted on the Ski Club
I Bulletin Board located by the A.S.
I S.U. Office.
