# Indians Plot to Stymie Bruin 'Racehorse Play
## 
### ART SHAPIRO 
' Fresh from the carnage they created last week in Westwood,
the UCLA Bruins travel north to take on the Indians in two hoop
frays this week-end. After committing a mild case of mayhem
against the Berkeley Bears and escaping unscathed, the Bruins
are the proud possessors of first place in conference standings.

Equipped with a brand-new style
of play, the Uclans managed to walk
over the Bears with complete im
punity. Scoring a total of 157 points
against the host that Cal could mus
ter, the "scatter-ball' technique
proved its potential offensive
strength.
KIIODE ISLAND STYLE
The "scatter-ball,' or ''racehorse"
style of play has most often been
associated in basketball circles with
Rhode Island State. Utilizing this
method of attack, the team guards
deep under its own basket, forcing
play, and attempting to intercept
any and all passes made by the op
position in their own territory. Once
the ball is in their possession its
drive, layup, and two more points
on the scoreboard.
Taking advantage of the sharp
shooting ability of Barksdale and
Stanich. numbers one and two in
the conference scoring race, the
Uclans are willing to weaken the
defense under their own netting, in
order to score and score often. The
fatal mistake the Bears made was
in attempting to pass the ball out
from their own side of the blue line
to the UCLA side via the hand to
hand method. With the casaba float
ing through the air a scant five feet
from the backboard, It wasn't long
ere UCLA hands were at the re
ceiving end of the passes and Cal
was on the wrong side of the score.
MISLEADING RECORD
UCLA's record is a misleading ag
gregate of high scores, and phenom
enal victories. The Uclans possess
a fine offense, but the wins were due
as much to the surprise and inept
ness of the opposition as it was to
their own offensive prowess. The
sliding-zone of the Cardinals will
prove a tough nut for the Bruins to
crack and the push and aggressive
ness of the local squad may prove a
little more effective against "scat
ter-ball" than the misplaced finesse
of the Cal varsity.
The Uclans have also been work
ing on the two-squad system in
their past few encounters. In this
manner the starting five is never
overworked, and the opposition al
ways finds itself facing fresh men
who are more than willing to charge
up and down the court. UCLA at
tempted ihe trick against Stanford
during their second encounter. The
second quintet started, but with the
score 3G-4 against them, the starters
were thrown into the fray, and gave
proof to the adage, "never send a
boy out to do a man's job."
"RACEHORSE" STOPPED
The Indians went through a bruis
ing workout last night in prepara
tion for the crucial games over the
coming week-end. The varsity
worked against the B squad and
gave a clear indication that the
"Racehorse"' can be brought to a
halt.
Don't count the Indians out. The
team is up for these coming games
with the Westwood Wonders, and
bigger and better outfits have been
forced to bow in the face of spirit,
drive, and a well-coached squad.

tempted ihe trick against Stanford
during their second encounter. The
second quintet started, but with the
score 3G-4 against them, the starters
were thrown into the fray, and gave
proof to the adage, "never send a
boy out to do a man's job."
"RACEHORSE" STOPPED
The Indians went through a bruis
ing workout last night in prepara
tion for the crucial games over the
coming week-end. The varsity
worked against the B squad and
gave a clear indication that the
"Racehorse"' can be brought to a
halt.
Don't count the Indians out. The
team is up for these coming games
with the Westwood Wonders, and
bigger and better outfits have been
forced to bow in the face of spirit,
drive, and a well-coached squad.
' Fresh from the carnage they created last week in Westwood,
the UCLA Bruins travel north to take on the Indians in two hoop
frays this week-end. After committing a mild case of mayhem
against the Berkeley Bears and escaping unscathed, the Bruins
are the proud possessors of first place in conference standings.

Equipped with a brand-new style
of play, the Uclans managed to walk
over the Bears with complete im
punity. Scoring a total of 157 points
against the host that Cal could mus
ter, the "scatter-ball' technique
proved its potential offensive
strength.
KIIODE ISLAND STYLE
The "scatter-ball,' or ''racehorse"
style of play has most often been
associated in basketball circles with
Rhode Island State. Utilizing this
method of attack, the team guards
deep under its own basket, forcing
play, and attempting to intercept
any and all passes made by the op
position in their own territory. Once
the ball is in their possession its
drive, layup, and two more points
on the scoreboard.
Taking advantage of the sharp
shooting ability of Barksdale and
Stanich. numbers one and two in
the conference scoring race, the
Uclans are willing to weaken the
defense under their own netting, in
order to score and score often. The
fatal mistake the Bears made was
in attempting to pass the ball out
from their own side of the blue line
to the UCLA side via the hand to
hand method. With the casaba float
ing through the air a scant five feet
from the backboard, It wasn't long
ere UCLA hands were at the re
ceiving end of the passes and Cal
was on the wrong side of the score.
MISLEADING RECORD
UCLA's record is a misleading ag
gregate of high scores, and phenom
enal victories. The Uclans possess
a fine offense, but the wins were due
as much to the surprise and inept
ness of the opposition as it was to
their own offensive prowess. The
sliding-zone of the Cardinals will
prove a tough nut for the Bruins to
crack and the push and aggressive
ness of the local squad may prove a
little more effective against "scat
ter-ball" than the misplaced finesse
of the Cal varsity.
The Uclans have also been work
ing on the two-squad system in
their past few encounters. In this
manner the starting five is never
overworked, and the opposition al
ways finds itself facing fresh men
who are more than willing to charge
up and down the court. UCLA at
