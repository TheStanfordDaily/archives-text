# Phi Delts Win; Medics Take First Playoff
## 
### 
Playing before a crowd made up
of violently staunch supporters of
both t"ams, the Phi Delts treated
the Fijis to their first league defeat
last night in the Pavilion by a 17-12
score. As each team has now been
defeated once, they will probably
.stage a play-off game to decide the
championship of League 111.
The Phi Delt victory was a re
sult of their tight defense and the
Fijis' had luck with shots that
looked like certain two-pointers.
The Fijis were held to 2 points in
the first half, with both of them
coining from foul shots. Mean
while, the Phi Delts managed to
run up 10 markers before the end
of the first period.
The first part of the second half
was even more one-sided. The
I'ijis were unahlc to score until
almost half of the second period
had elapsed. What they lacked in
scoring ability the Fijis made up
in spirit as they repeatedly fouled
the Phi Delts in attempting to steal
the ball. The Phi Delts took ad
vantage of their foul shots to pile
up an advantage, and in the last
minutes of the game froze the
hall effectively enough to stifle a
Fiji rally.
High scorers for the winners
were Husbe with six points and
Prince with four. John Muir sank
six points for the Fijis.
The Theta Delts downed the Al
pha Delts, 28-21, in another game
played at the Pavilion. Three men,
Bob Anderson with 14 points, Mort
Bunnell with 10, and Verne Free

the winners. Lewis Saxby led the
Alpha Delts as he poured eight
points through the hoop.
The D.U. No. 2 team did it again
as they trampled the A.K.L.'s. 24-9.
The score at half-time was 14-4 in
favor of the D.U.'s. Spider Elliot
and Al Rice led the winning team
with 10 and (i points respectively,
while Campbell piled up six points
for the losing A.K.L.'s.
The Phi Delt second team came
out on top of a fighting Phi Psi
team by a 22-18 score. The game
was close and hard-fought all the
way with the Phi Delts holding a
10-12 advantage at the half. The
Phi Psi outfit, however, tied the
score at 18-all and then failed to
score in the last five minutes of
the contest.
Frank Parr paced the Phi Delts
with 10 points, and Hugh Hudson
helped with eight more. Murray
scored six points to lead the Phi
Psi's.
