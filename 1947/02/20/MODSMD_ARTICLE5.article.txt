# War Power Cut Asked
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 10 (UP).â€”
Acting on the recommendation of
the Navy, President Truman asked
Congress today to continue at least
until June 30, 1048, his authority
to arm U.S. merchant ships in an
emergency.
The request was included in a
special message in which Mr. Tru
man called for legislative sanction
to cut further the sweeping powers
invoked by the government under
the limited and unlimited states of
emergency proclaimed by the late
President Roosevelt in 1030 and
1041.
He recommended specifically out
right repeal of 24 temporary laws
dealing with special wartime prob
lems which no longer exist; the laps
ing of 36 permanent statutes, most
of which were enacted during or
before World War I and which can
be reinvoked whenever necessary;
the extension of 12 temporary meas
ures, including the arming of mer
chant vessels; lapsing of 14 emer
gency appropriation measures and
extension of six others; and contin
uation of 10 other temporary stat
utes cither for their fixed term or
until the states of emergency are
ended.
