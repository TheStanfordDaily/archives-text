### BILL SWIGERT 
An appreciative audience of well
over a hundred persons crowded
j into the Gymnastics Room of the
Enema Gym last night to watch the
I gymnasts of the Olympic Club, San
i Francisco YMCA, and Stanford go
I through their antics of brawn and
| coordination. By agreement, the
1 meet was held on an informal, non
i competitive basis because the Olym
j pic Club and the "Y" were not able
j to enter full teams, and because of
J the lack of qualified judges for all
; events.
The hour and a half exhibition
j began with a demonstration of hand
! to hand balancing given by two
Stanford men, Ted Kahn and Buck
: Thompson. This was followed by
i an exhibition of free exercise by Al
j Lynn also of Stanford.
