# Mittmen Mix With Cal Aggies Tonight
## 
### 
Stafford's undefeated boxing team
has iought uphill battles so regu
larly this season that Coach Clayton
Frye is beginning to feel more like
a mountain-climbing mentor than
a ring coach. It's been the same
Story rill along—the Cardinals, by
dint oi forfeited bouts, have had to
htart their opponents oil with a one
or two-point edge in every match.
NO EXCEPTION
Tonight's slug-session with the
Cal Aggies up in Davis will be no
exception. As a matter of fact the
Farm ringmen will have to fight
themselves out of a bigger hole this
time than in their two previous in
tercollegiate matches.
No entries will be available for
Stanford at 125 lbs., or at 130 lbs.,
or at 135 lbs. That means Coach
Frye will grudgingly hand the Ag
gies three big points free of charge.
I.OBDELL. JESS OCT
Buzz Lobdell and George Jess, at

130 and 135 lbs. respectively, are
both on the sidelines.
Al Harris, who made such a sen
sational showing against UCLA,
gets his second chance of the season
in the senior welterweight division,
, and Wilbur Altus makes his initial
11)47 appearance in the 115-11:. class.
Bill Edwards also goes to the post
I for the first time tonight, m the
j light-heavy bracket.
LEVIN AGAIN
Yank Levin is in for a busy eve
ning. His middleweight opponent
will be Jerry Weber, a pre-war Cal
Aggie entry in the Pacific Coast in
tercollegiate tournament and highly
touted off his performances so far
I this year.
The team will weigh in at noon
today in the gym, and leave at 1
| p.m. for Davis.
