## Happy Chain Reaction

In a Campus Opinion, Feb. 10, Bob Roth
well wrote in part:
"Every day after 11 o'clock classes there is
a large group of students waiting for rides to
Paly and the Village. They all wait in one
spot, and create a dangerous confusion. The
ones desiring to go to the Village hail a car,
which stops, and they run out into the street
to find out where it is going. If it is going to
Palo Alto they run back and wait for the next
car. In the meantime other cars must dodge
the car which is stopped and the hitchhikers.
And everyone concerned becomes irritated
at the confusion. The same thing happens
when Palo Alto-bound students hail a car.
"... I propose that two signs be placed at
different places, one saying Palo Alto and the
other, Village, so that the riders and drivers
cn know beforehand whether they both are
going in the same direction."
After investigation of our own we con
curred with Mr. Rothwell, editorially, Feb. 13,
and threw t; e ball to Cardinals, activities or
ganization.
Feb. 18, their first meeting following the
editorial, Cardinals caught the ball and ran
goalward. A few days hence, when police
technicalities can be ironed out and signs let

tered, Cardinals expect to have the signs
erected.
