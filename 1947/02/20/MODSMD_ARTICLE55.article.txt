# Booing, Berkeley Style
## 
### 
To get right to the point, there are two rea
sons why it is a poor idea to boo at basketball
referees. It's a bum example of sportsmanship
and it can get additional penalties for the team.
Now, despite arguments to the contrary,
the officials on the floor are human beings.
We're pretty sure of that because they
sometimes make mistakes.
But you've got to give someone authority
to make decisions during a game. You can't
put it to a vote. You can't poll the spectators.
So it seems somewhat irrational to howl like
a wounded banshee when you disagree with
a decision.
Some may not know it, but it is perfectly
legitimate for a referee to penalize a team
when it's supporters go overboard on boo
ing. This is a good thing tor rooters to bear
in mind. Don't vocalize our team into a
handicap.
To sum up, then, let's cut out this stuff. Af
ter all, the example the U.C. at B. fans set isn't
worth following.—J.C.O.
