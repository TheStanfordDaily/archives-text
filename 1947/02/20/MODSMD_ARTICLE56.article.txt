# BULL SESSION
## 
### CARL HEINTZE 
People who write in this column are supposed
to write about what's going on campus, what gives
with students, songs, dances, and funny stories about
Stanford, and things like that.
One big topic of discussions, at least in the col
umns of this paper, if not in all the bull sessions on
campus, is the international movement (if that is
the proper way to designate it) which is concerned
with fostering international understanding between
Americans and the other nationalities.
The 1.5.C., as everyone knows, plans three or
more trips to Europe for some fortunate people; the
"I" Club, the A.Y.H., and others are planning meet
ings with other countries as their topics.
Fine, understanding is the only foundation for
world peace, which (I hope) we are very interested
in keeping at the present moment. Just what are
those people going to find out on their journeys?
What are they going to learn from students they
will meet in foreign universities, especially Euro
pean universities?
The first thing they'll find out about European
students, at least, is that many of them think of the
Communist party as the only future basis for a gov
ernment. They'll find that they will have to work
lip a good defense of the American system.
Then they'll find that everyone is hungry no
matter what country they are in, except perhaps
Switzerland and Sweden. They'll have to explain
why America is still talking about tariffs.
The worst thing that they'll discover is that every

one is tired, tired of war, tired of cold, tired of hun
ger. just tired of everything.
They'll see war damage, whole cities lost into
bomb rubble, broken bridges tumbled into streams,
bad roads, harbors cluttered with wrecks, charcoal
burning locomotives, and a tremendous lack of all
manufactured materials.
Still people will seem the same to them because
they'll just be people trying to live, just like people
in America are, trying to make homes out of the
broken pieces of their lives, trying to build lives out
of what's left.
When they have finished their tours and come
home, I'll bet that's what they'll tell Stanford by
speech, writing, or talks.
Of course they will have minor variations of
this theme: Spain will be tired of Franco, but won't
know what to do about it; Sweden will be trying
to be another America, but afraid of Russia; and
France will be a political battleground. Greece will
be dirty and disorganized.
Still there isn't anything wrong with their going.
It's too bad that every American can't go, for until
you have walked in a ruined city, or talked to a
helpless old woman without a home, or looked at
the great bare blocks of Le Havre, you haven't seen
the rest of the world, and you are only conscious of
America, the Elysium of existence today.
Just ask a vet who has been there. He knows
because he helped make it that way.

campus, is the international movement (if that is
the proper way to designate it) which is concerned
with fostering international understanding between
Americans and the other nationalities.
The 1.5.C., as everyone knows, plans three or
more trips to Europe for some fortunate people; the
"I" Club, the A.Y.H., and others are planning meet
ings with other countries as their topics.
Fine, understanding is the only foundation for
world peace, which (I hope) we are very interested
in keeping at the present moment. Just what are
those people going to find out on their journeys?
What are they going to learn from students they
will meet in foreign universities, especially Euro
pean universities?
The first thing they'll find out about European
students, at least, is that many of them think of the
Communist party as the only future basis for a gov
ernment. They'll find that they will have to work
lip a good defense of the American system.
Then they'll find that everyone is hungry no
matter what country they are in, except perhaps
Switzerland and Sweden. They'll have to explain
why America is still talking about tariffs.
The worst thing that they'll discover is that every

one is tired, tired of war, tired of cold, tired of hun
ger. just tired of everything.
They'll see war damage, whole cities lost into
bomb rubble, broken bridges tumbled into streams,
bad roads, harbors cluttered with wrecks, charcoal
burning locomotives, and a tremendous lack of all
manufactured materials.
Still people will seem the same to them because
they'll just be people trying to live, just like people
in America are, trying to make homes out of the
broken pieces of their lives, trying to build lives out
of what's left.
When they have finished their tours and come
home, I'll bet that's what they'll tell Stanford by
speech, writing, or talks.
Of course they will have minor variations of
this theme: Spain will be tired of Franco, but won't
know what to do about it; Sweden will be trying
to be another America, but afraid of Russia; and
France will be a political battleground. Greece will
be dirty and disorganized.
Still there isn't anything wrong with their going.
It's too bad that every American can't go, for until
you have walked in a ruined city, or talked to a
helpless old woman without a home, or looked at
the great bare blocks of Le Havre, you haven't seen
the rest of the world, and you are only conscious of
America, the Elysium of existence today.
Just ask a vet who has been there. He knows
because he helped make it that way.
People who write in this column are supposed
to write about what's going on campus, what gives
with students, songs, dances, and funny stories about
Stanford, and things like that.

campus, is the international movement (if that is
