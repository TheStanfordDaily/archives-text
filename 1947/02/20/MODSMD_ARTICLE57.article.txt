As things stand now, there are four leading con
tenders for the Republican nomination next year.
They are Taft, Dewey, Stassen, and Warren. There
is one observation that can be made: that is that
these four can be subdivided into two groups of two.
and that these two groups split the country geo
graphically and the Grand Old Party ideologically
right down the middle.
Speaking generally, Taft and Dewey represent
the industrial East, that northeast quarter of the
United States, while Stassen and Warren come from
;i West that is still largely agrarian. As things stand
now, a distinct East-West split seems to be develop
ing in the Republican party. For instance, budget
discussions in Congress show majority members from
this side of the Mississippi demanding a continuance
of certain water and power products, while their
Eastern brethren chant ''economy, economy." 1
don't say it's a serious split, but there are differences
of opinion. Moreover, on a number of these issues,
the point of view of the Western members is some
what more liberal, more progressive, in the usual
sense of those words, than is that of the trans -
Mississippians.
To be sure, they are all Republicans. A progres
sive or liberal Republican is still not usually so ad
vanced in his thinking as to qualify for the Supreme
Court or to be barred from the Atomic Energy Com
mission. Nevertheless, all Republicans are not to be
tarred with the "Old Guard" brush. And it seems to

me that the Republicans of the West as a group arc
the less rigidly conservative wing of the party.
I sincerely doubt that Senator Taft will be the
Republican nominee. He is a Senator, and Senators
have not usually been successful candidates. His
intelligence is undoubted, but he is not a popular
leader; that is, his personality Is not exactly inspir
ing. And he is not an experienced administrator.
All these objections are without regard to his po
litical ideas, which I consider personally not to be
exactly inspiring, either. So we are left with a
trio. Governor Dewey, Governor Warren, and ex-
Governor Stassen. In the popular mind Governor
Dewey is labeled a member of the "Old Guard";
Warren makes a point of appearing as a non-partisan
and progressive administrator; and Stassen makes
no bones about his internationalism. All three of
them have good records as state executives, and
all three are excellent practical politicians.
Remembering that we are speaking in a Republi
can sense, that is, that the extreme left here is just
left of center generally, Dewey is well over to the
right, Warren in the center, ,-\nd Stassen well to the
left. Taft, were I still considering him, would prob
ably be to the right of Dewey. Personally, I would
be satisfied to vote for either Stassen or Warren.
Personally, I think that a national election at which
the voter was offered a choice between Truman and
Dewey would be discouraging. Personally, if I had
to choose between those two, I'd vote for Truman.
