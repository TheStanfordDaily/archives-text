To the Editor:
Those who are not pleased with I.S.C. can be
placed in two categories. First there are those who
frankly have little interest in such an undertaking,
have given it no honest thought, and to whom it
appears a "phenomenal waste of money." That it
so appears is largely due to the fact that early pub
licity was nebulous and idealistic, and offered little
concrete foundation for positive attraction to it. The
atmosphere was thus made conducive to a negative
and cynical attitude. Now, however, a specific plan
is beginning to evolve; it is time that those of the
negative attitude take stock of the benefits to be
had from this project, or if still indifferent, at least
concede, in lieu of something constructive, the bene
fit of the doubt. Those who upon consideration of
the facts as now available still feel the I.S.C. a waste
of money, and consider expenditure of substantial
funds for it an evil worthy of their attention and
••flort, are privileged (and duty-bound) to do all in
their power to prevent it.

posed of those who are deeply interested in the
I.S.C. as a project, favor it in principle, but who
take issue as to the means by which their common
ends are being achieved. This group has offered
constructive criticism and practical suggestions, and
feels that I.S.C. has not given due consideration to
them. This group believes further that I.S.C. is op
eration in somewhat arbitrary fashion, and not en
tirely in accordance with the wishes of the student
body from which I.S.C. must derive its support, a
feeling which is partially justified.
The Survey Committee as established by Excom
has succeeded in convincing Excom that it is making
satisfactory progress toward the achievement of its
goal. That this goal will be a substantial step to
ward some sort of international understanding
seems difficult to doubt. Until the student body,
through the machinery at its disposal, indicates that
it does not consider this to be the case, the I.S.C.
merits the full support and co-operation of Excom.

have given it no honest thought, and to whom it
appears a "phenomenal waste of money." That it
so appears is largely due to the fact that early pub
licity was nebulous and idealistic, and offered little
concrete foundation for positive attraction to it. The
atmosphere was thus made conducive to a negative
and cynical attitude. Now, however, a specific plan
is beginning to evolve; it is time that those of the
negative attitude take stock of the benefits to be
had from this project, or if still indifferent, at least
concede, in lieu of something constructive, the bene
fit of the doubt. Those who upon consideration of
the facts as now available still feel the I.S.C. a waste
of money, and consider expenditure of substantial
funds for it an evil worthy of their attention and
••flort, are privileged (and duty-bound) to do all in
their power to prevent it.

I.S.C. as a project, favor it in principle, but who
take issue as to the means by which their common
ends are being achieved. This group has offered
constructive criticism and practical suggestions, and
feels that I.S.C. has not given due consideration to
them. This group believes further that I.S.C. is op
eration in somewhat arbitrary fashion, and not en
tirely in accordance with the wishes of the student
body from which I.S.C. must derive its support, a
feeling which is partially justified.
The Survey Committee as established by Excom
has succeeded in convincing Excom that it is making
satisfactory progress toward the achievement of its
goal. That this goal will be a substantial step to
ward some sort of international understanding
seems difficult to doubt. Until the student body,
through the machinery at its disposal, indicates that
it does not consider this to be the case, the I.S.C.
merits the full support and co-operation of Excom.
