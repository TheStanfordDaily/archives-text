# Stanford Developing Audio-Visual Aids
## 
### MAUDIE BOEHM 
An Audio-Visual Aids Program,
designed to provide adequate fa
cilities for teaching through means
of movies, records, and slides is be
ing built up at Stanford.
Audio-visual material consists of
all equipment, such as phonographs,
records, microphones, projectors for
both moving pictures and slides, and
public address systems, which aid in
teaching or may be used for en
tertainment.
Several departments in addition
to Speech and Drama use audio
visual material. It is especially use
ful in teaching foreign language and
music courses.
A CO-ORDINATED PROGRAM
Jan. 1 the University appointed
John V. Zuckerman, audio-visual
specialist, to plan and carry out a
co-ordinated program.
Mr. Zuckerman has had experi
ence in governmental and profes
sional radio and television and in
various phases of audio-visual work
as well as in teaching. He is now
director of radio at Stanford and a
member of the KSU Faculty-Stu
dent Committee.
The new program plans to utilize
and centralize the numerous projec
tors, records, microphones, and pho
nographs that the University al
ready has and offer this equipment
to the various schools and depart
ments that could use it to advan
tage.
TO EXCHANGE EQUIPMENT
According to the proposed pro
gram, departments now having au
dio-visual equipment not used fre
quently will be able to exchange
with other departments which need
material only temporarily.
Mr. Zuckerman plans for his de
partment to act as intermediary for
such exchanges and for ordering
needed films, slides, and records.
Film preview service to help pro
fessors decide on materials, film li
brary of films used periodically by
departments, and film evaluation
service to determine which films are
adequate for use at the university
level, are some of the long-term
plans for the Audio - Visual Aids
Program.
USE FOREIGN FILMS
The new department also hopes to
use government films of foreign
countries, made during the war, to
aid in studies of customs, art, char
acter of peoples, and types of peo
ples by different schools and de
partments. The main delay in be
ginning this program is the dras
tic lack of space. Director Zucker
man has a plan for remodeling a
portion of the basement of the Me
morial Auditorium into offices, stu

dios, a darkroom, an equipment
maintenance workroom, and a film
library.
NEED SPACE AND MONEY
The carrying out of thus plan
would involve a $25,000 initial in
vestment, which the University is
unable to provide at this time. How
ever, the department is making plans
to raise money for this purpose.
These proposed rooms could well
be used for teaching radio and for
KSU broadcasting studios, accord
ing to the director.
Mr. Zuekerman stated that in the
"distant future," after the program
is well under way, the University
might even make some films itself.

ever, the department is making plans
to raise money for this purpose.
These proposed rooms could well
be used for teaching radio and for
KSU broadcasting studios, accord
ing to the director.
Mr. Zuekerman stated that in the
"distant future," after the program
is well under way, the University
might even make some films itself.
An Audio-Visual Aids Program,
designed to provide adequate fa
cilities for teaching through means
of movies, records, and slides is be
ing built up at Stanford.
Audio-visual material consists of
all equipment, such as phonographs,
records, microphones, projectors for
both moving pictures and slides, and
public address systems, which aid in
teaching or may be used for en
tertainment.
Several departments in addition
to Speech and Drama use audio
visual material. It is especially use
ful in teaching foreign language and
music courses.
A CO-ORDINATED PROGRAM
Jan. 1 the University appointed
John V. Zuckerman, audio-visual
specialist, to plan and carry out a
co-ordinated program.
Mr. Zuckerman has had experi
ence in governmental and profes
sional radio and television and in
various phases of audio-visual work
as well as in teaching. He is now
director of radio at Stanford and a
member of the KSU Faculty-Stu
dent Committee.
The new program plans to utilize
and centralize the numerous projec
tors, records, microphones, and pho
nographs that the University al
ready has and offer this equipment
to the various schools and depart
ments that could use it to advan
tage.
TO EXCHANGE EQUIPMENT
According to the proposed pro
gram, departments now having au
dio-visual equipment not used fre
quently will be able to exchange
with other departments which need
material only temporarily.
Mr. Zuckerman plans for his de
partment to act as intermediary for
such exchanges and for ordering
needed films, slides, and records.
Film preview service to help pro
fessors decide on materials, film li
brary of films used periodically by
departments, and film evaluation
service to determine which films are
adequate for use at the university
level, are some of the long-term
plans for the Audio - Visual Aids
Program.
USE FOREIGN FILMS
The new department also hopes to
use government films of foreign
countries, made during the war, to
aid in studies of customs, art, char
acter of peoples, and types of peo
ples by different schools and de
partments. The main delay in be
ginning this program is the dras
tic lack of space. Director Zucker
man has a plan for remodeling a
portion of the basement of the Me
morial Auditorium into offices, stu

dios, a darkroom, an equipment
maintenance workroom, and a film
library.
NEED SPACE AND MONEY
The carrying out of thus plan
would involve a $25,000 initial in
vestment, which the University is
unable to provide at this time. How
ever, the department is making plans
to raise money for this purpose.

be used for teaching radio and for
