When we say "Typically Eastern," this is a Classic
Example of what we mean! See the loose-fitting, boxy
jacket? See that straight hang it has ? It's an easy suit to
wear. And it's easy on your pocketbook, too. It's just $45
If you are one of those Ladies who loves Fine Tweeds
& Flannels; if you like Classic Dresses because they are
Q simple and classic, get out your Address Book and start Q
