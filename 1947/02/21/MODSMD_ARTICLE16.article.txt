## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 (UP).-
The House today approved, 239 to
159, the Joint Congressional Com
mittee's plan to cut President Tru
man's 1948 fiscal spending program
by $6,(100,000,000.
The Senate may vote tomorrow. A
majority of Senate Republicans as
well as Democrats are demanding
that the proposed reduction be held
to $4.500,000,000.
REJECT MOTION
Republicans, aided by a handful
of conservative Southern Democrats,
sent the plan to the Senate after re
jecting, 231 to 166, a motion by Rep.
Clarence Cannon (D-Mo), to send
it back to the committee for further
study until April 15.
The top-heavy Republican ma
jority, aided by some conservative
Southern Democrats, refused to add
a single penny to the $31,500,000,000
ceiling on government expenditures
recommended by the Joint Congres
sional Budget Committee.
TRUMAN COMMENTS
Mr. Truman, who asked Congress
for permission to spend $37,500,000,-
000, during the next fiscal year be
ginning July 1, told his news confer
ence that he had no comment now
on a Republican proposal, put for
ward yesterday by Sen. Robert A.
Taft, of Ohio, to apply budget econ
omies to tax reduction instead of to
partial retirement of the huge pub
lic debt.
Since Congress convened in Janu
ary, Mr. Truman has held firmly to
a policy of no tax cuts. He has said
repeatedly that any surplus reve
nue should be used to pay off some
of the national debt, now estimated
at about $260,000,000,000.
