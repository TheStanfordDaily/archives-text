LOS ANGELES, Feb. 20 (UP).—A devastating explosion of
such violence that witnesses thought it was the result of an atom
bomb today leveled most of a city block.
The force of the blast was felt for miles but the damage waa
confined chiefly to the single block in the industrial area jufrt off
downtown Los Angeles.
The blast area was bounded by Pico Street, Stanford, Central
and 14th streets.
Coroner Ben Brown reported 16 persons were killed, although
the toll may rise from deaths among more than 200 injured.
Hours after the explosion two bulldozers and a steam shovel
removed debris from the site of the O'Connor Electro-Plating
Plant, scene of the explosion.

The blast entirely demolished the
| one-story brick and wood structure
j and the majority of the deaths were
; among employes of that firm.
The plant, located on East Pico
Street, near Central Ave«nut», was
' surrounded by small homes as well
as manufacturing buildings. A quick
check by city Inspectors showed at
least 30 of the homes were unsafe
and residents, many of whom were
among the injured, wore taken to
city housing projects.
Robert O'Connor, general mana
ger of the plating company, said
there were only 26 persons in the
plant at 9:45 a.m. today when the
explosion took place. Of thew,
matiy, including O'Connor, suffered
only minor injuries.
Cause of the explosion tentatively
was blamed on a new plating proc
ess for aluminum in which perchlo
ric acid concentrate is used. The
acid is so volatile that It. must be
kept refrigerated. Alxmt an hour
before the blast the refrigeration
unit broke down and was repaired,
Chief Earl Richardson of the city's
fire prevention bureau reported.
First arrivals at (he scene of the
blast were greeted by a sight of
utter devastation where the build
ing had stood.
Mounds of bricks and timbers
were all that remained of the build
ing. Sticking out from the wreck
age were hands, heads and torsos
of the victims.
Fifteen companies of fire equip
ment roared up to the East Pico
Street scene and began pouring wa
ter on the scattered fues resulting
from the explosion.
A force of 300 police followed in
dozens of siren-shrieking police
cars, joining the firemen In comb
ing through the wreckage for the
bodies.
Ruptured gas mains and fallen
high-tension lines created an addi
tional hazard. The Southern Cali
fornia Gas Co. quickly shut off its
lines for the entire are« as firemen
stood with hoses ready to combat a
gas explosion or fire.
