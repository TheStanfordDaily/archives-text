# 'No Serious Recession in Say Two Stanford Economists
## 
### 
Two Stanford economists, Dr. Holbrook Working and Dr.
Joseph Davis, voiced their opinions yesterday on any cofning
economic recession in the United States.
Their conclusions were drawn after they attended meetings of
.he American Economic Association and the American Statis
tical Association. i

Concerning the much - discussed
economic recession, Dr. Working i
said, "It wouldn't be surprising if j
the people should wake up some j
day to realize that the expected
economic depression is all past."
"With a look at the industrial
stock prices, one can see the possi- '
bility that the depression is aJ-j
ready over," added Dr. Working. ,
Dr. Davis stated the conclusion j
that was drawn at the American i
Economics Association meeting con- i
cerning the recession.
"The conclusion drawn from these
meetings was that there would be
no serious economic recession in the
United States in the next few
months," said Dr. Davis.
During this trip, Dr. Davis and
Dr. Working conferred with the !
chairman and the .stafl of the Coun- j
cil of Economic Advisers to the j
President.
"This council is concerned with j
preventing a severe depression rath
er than stopping any kind of re- j
cession," said Dr. Davis.
Dr. Davis also stated, "Some de
gree of recession from boom levels i
would be helpful to the nation's
economy rather than harmful."
Dr. Working said of the council, [
"In the long the Council of Eco- i
nomic Advisers has possibilities of !
exerting a large influence in wiser i
handling of our economic problems." j
Speaking further about the much
advertised recession 1 , Dr. Working
noted that several people have
raised the question whether or not
the wide advertising given the an- j
ticipated recession might affect the i
actual outcome.
"There has already been some re- |
cession," he said, "and it is possible j
we might some day soon come to j
the realization that the recession is {
past."
