# Li'l Injuns Star at Village Clinic Opening
## 
### BOB PANNELL 
A new activity was launched at j
the Village infirmary Wednesday.
The front was lined with rows of
baby carriages, ranging from the
latest post-war model to the peram
bulator version of the Model T.
For this meeting catered to the |
newest additions to the Stanford j
family, the offspring of Village
couples.
Inside, the infirmary swarmed

with action. Case histories were re
corded, and weighing and measur
ing of the unsuspecting progeny took
place. After this, the wailing chil
dren were taken into the doctors'
offices, where they were given phys
ical checkups, Schick tests, and im
munizations against smallpox and
diphtheria.
BABY INSTRUCTION
Dr. Morris S. Abramson, a grad
uate of the Stanford medical school,

instructed each parent in proper (
child care, feeding, and exercise |
procedures. A booklet was handed ;
out which will gradually be filled in
with each subsequent visit. This
book will become a graphic record
of a child's growth and develop
ment.
The clinic bids fair to become one
of the social centers of the Village.
Proud mothers were already com
paring notes on Johnny's first step j
and Betty's new tooth.
What atmosphere could be more j
conducive to a little parental brag- j
ging, for adding to the bustle were !
many onlookers who nodded their
approval of the doings? The occa
sional flashing of camera bulbs punc- I
tuated the scene.
Each child was done up in his j
Sunday clothes and more than one !
anxious mother hoped that Junior i
would be on his best behavior.
FREE OF CHARGE
Future sessions of the Confer- |

112 ence will be held the first and thu d !
j Wednesdays of each month from 9 i
to 12 a.m. Any Village mother may !
bring her baby free of charge. It is 1
not expected that each mother will
attend every time, but she will come 1
only when the doctor recommends. '
Only children up to age two were 1
taken last Wednesday, but later,
| pre-school children up to the age
j of six will be cared for.
This first meeting of the Well- '
j Baby Conference is another step
| forward in an overall plan by which
jit is hoped to make Stanford Village
; a self-sufficient community.
The clinic means that the children
of veterans struggling to succeed at i
Stanford on their limited G.I. al
i lowances can be given adequate |
medical attention at all times.

Dr. Abramson, expressing satis
faction at the first day's response,
diagrammed the purpose of the con
ference:
"The Chinese say that an ounce of
prevention is worth a pound of cure.
The clinic is based more or less on
that idea. Prevention is the key
work. Most pediatricians only see
a child after he has become ill. We
are trying to impress on eveiy par
ent that a baby requires care be
fore he becomes sick. Their forma
tive years, and especially those
years before entrance into school,
are the most important in acquiring
good health habits. Too many par
ents are content to leave their child's
welfare to chance or the casual lay
man's advice."
Plans are also under way for the

! construction of a day nursery. Prob
lems of lack of space and personnel
have been hindering this project.
I Ml APARTMENTS
Many families who have been liv
j ing in nearby auto camps and hin
terland apartments have inquired
when the remaining Village apart
ments will be finished. Under
present plans it is hoped that the
■ new units will be ready for occu
pancy by May 1. When completed
there will be 301 complete units;
142 will have two bedrooms, a liv
ing room, kitchen, and bath; whik
141 will have only one bedroom.
Eighteen others will be the so-called
"zero apartments" or those without
' bedrooms.


ON THE LEFT—Knocking off for
lunch is Elizabeth Anne Roach,
who quietly celebrates her birthday.
Elizabeth, the daughter of Jim
Roach, first-year law student, is just
two months old.


AT THE LOWER LEFT—Weighing
in at 28 lbs. 6'/2 oz. and wearing
white trunks we have Beverly Es
sick, one of the entrants in the
heavyweight division. Bev's dad
attends the School of Business and
her uncle is no less a luminary than
Doug Essick, captain of last year's

Southern California football squad
which defeated the Stanford eleven,
28-20. ~


BELOW—Another weigh-in for the
I main event—Roy Pettit. Mrs. Her-
I bert Wunderlieh, wife of the Stan-
I ford Village official, registers aston
j ishment as she pronounces Roy fit
j and ready for action.
Mrs. Wunderlieh did yeoman work
j all afternoon as "clerk of scales,"
while Mrs. Buchanan, whose hus
; hand also helps direct Village af
j fairs, recorded the case history of
| each infant.


, I OBJECT — Dr. Morris Abramson
j examines David Tappan, Jr., who
like most other babies violently op
poses being handled by anyone
other than his mother. In this in
j stance, looking at Mrs. Tappan, it
' is hard to blame him. Dave Sr. is

another business major and also
graduate coach of the Farm soccer
team, having starred himself in un
dergraduate days.
When questioned about the well- I
baby program, the mothers were J
unanimous in their praise of the

clinic. The next meeting is to be
held early next month and will bo
for any pre-school child up to six
years of age. Appointments may
bo made now by phoning Mrs. Pur
nell in the Village civic center.
