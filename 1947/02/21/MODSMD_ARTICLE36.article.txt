An (»rid (loach. It Was a Weighty Decision
Our revered contempt-orary university up in Berkeley lias at last
U.;en to its bosom a football coach. From all the time expended and all
the pains taken by coach seeker Brutus Hamilton, wo all should have
known that something big was in the wind. I'll say it was big—Lynn Wal
d( rf weighs 250 pounds, shower side.
All this fuss and furore in the newspapers hasn't done Pacific Coast
football any good. First, the method by which Frank Wickhorst was fired
was strictly on the underhanded side. No, I don't think he was the best
coach in the world, or even up to the average, but the mud thrown at him
by a certain San Francisco newspaper was shameful.
Wickhorst was just a guy doing liis best in a job that was loo big fol
ium—lull dial particular position lias been too big for quite a few coaches
recognized as good. Buck Shaw is one of the finest pigskin tutors in the
country, lie took the job on a one-year basis, hut could have continued
it he'd cared to; he threw up his hands in disgust.
Considering all the ramifications of the situation, it seems to a neutral
observer that Wickhorst could have been dismissed much more quietly,
and without hurting his reputation nearly as much.
The whole thing was started by the managing editor of the aforemen
tioned certain San Francisco newspaper; he happens to be a Cal alumnus.
He made the "Get Wickhorst" campaign a sacred cow, and devoted col
umns of space to (he subject. Anonymous comments, ostensibly by old
grads and by football players, were printed. Unsigned statements seem
underhanded to me; underhanded and perhaps lacking in authenticity.
But they're good propaganda.
Leave Us Bury the Dead, Decaying Past
All that is in the past, though, and is best forgotten. We can only hope
sincerely that such a thing will never happen again—at ANY Coast school.
It's the worst publicity Coast football could get.
Dean Brutus Hamilton was saddled with a great deal of responsibility
when he was told to "go out and get a coach." Perhaps he could have
done as well without ever going so far East. Whatever the rest of the
country may think, we DO have some good coaches out here.
Lon Stiner of Oregon State is an example. He's one of the best young
coj chos in the country, and is rumored to be unhappy in his present job.
Cal could have got him for less than $10,000 per year.
r 1 hen there's Joe Verducci, who's had a lot of success with his prep
school teams, up in San Francisco. Paul Brown and Bert Labrucheric came
out of the prep coaching ranks* you know. If, every time a Const school
needs a new coach, an Eastern man is hired, we'll rate any disparaging
comments that come our way.
This is in no way to be considered an attack on Lynn (Pappy) Wal
d< rf's ability as a grid mentor. He's held his own in a lough league.
Some years when he had great material his teams were disappointing,
but at other times he molded winning squads out of mediocre material.
IL' his job.
Pm sure all his brother coaches welcome him. Under the new setup
at Berkeley, he should get more co-operation than any of his predecessors.
1 wish him luck, and hope he wins every game next year—except the Big
Game.
Stand Hack, Men, They're llig and Tough!
It seems as though every week the Indian basketeers face another
"croocial" series. Well, if the others were "croocial," this one is a "croo
cir.l croocial." Everett Dean's boys only face the best cage squad in Cali
fornia, that's all.
That seemingly should indicate that the locals don't have a chance—but
I wouldn't exactly say that. After all, Stanford has held the Bruins to
tlu ir lowest scores of the year while managing to break even—all this on
tin enemy court.
Naturally the Westwooders have improved in the six weeks since last
tiny faced the Stanford Red; however, so have the Cardinals. Everett
Dt an has a more than average-good defensive team. Bill Stephenson held
hi: opposite number, Don Barksdale, to mighty slim pickings the last time
out. The other boys did as well. Only man they couldn't keep out of their
hi;a was little Johnny Stanich, the mitey forward who can sink baskets
all evening from 30 feet out.
The series should he an interesting one, and far from a total loss. I
don't quite see how Stanford can take both games, but I'll stick my neck
on the guillotine and pick (hem to split the series; they'll probably win
twilight's donnybrook.
Incidentally, there should be more than a few points scored. The three
top Southern Division scorers will be on the floor at the same time: namely
Barksdale, Stanich, and Stephenson.
The Cal-Trojan series? Let's be conservative and pick a split for
them. too.
