## 
### 
Stanford's rugby team will lino up Saturday afternoon against the Uni
versity Club from San Francisco at 3 on the intramural field.
The University Club is composed of former University of California
ruggers and should provide the locals with some stiff competition.
The Indians, however, on the basis of their impressive win of 11-3 over-

* the Menlo Ramblers last Saturday
I deserve the role of favorites,
i Holding heavy scrimmages on
' Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday
this week, Stanford is fully ready
for the game and will be gunning
for their second victory in the
Northern California Rugby Union.
Stanford's coaching stall of Jim
; Wylie and Willard Classen, both
| former rugby greats, has done a fine
j job of teaching the complex sport
' to a squad which was largely inex
perienced when the season began.
The team was carried along in the
first couple of games by players like
Bob Brodie, Sandy Atherton, and
j Bert Avery who had played the
j game before. Last week's win, how
: ever, was a team victory with many
of the new players turning in top
notch games.
