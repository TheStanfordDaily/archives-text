# Indian-Uclan Tilt Results To Decide Playoff Game
## 
### ART SHAPIRO 
With the West Coast's biggest
sports attraction scheduled for the
Pavilion come the weekend, the
Indians wrnt through a light work
out yesterday before they tackle the
rampaging Uclans tonight. Some of
the Card starters were excused from
the practice session and w°rc given
the day of! in order to allow them
to rest before the rough and tough
series.
Having already discounted the re
mainder of the Southern Division
play, the Westwood Wonders have
begun to east covetous glances in
the direction of Oregon State and
llie P.C.L. playofTs.
DECIDES PLAYOFF
A double victory over the Indians
would certainly assure U.C.L.A. the
right to meet Oregon State in the
playoffs. Anything short of that
would keep the Southern Division
championship on ice, while a double
defeat would skyrocket Stanford
into a tie for first place, and dis
prove the theory that lightning nev
er strikes twice in the same place.
The athletic fortunes of U.C.L.A.
took their first bolt from the blue on
New Year's Day, and one more on
Friday and Saturday would be too

The presence of Stanford's pep
hand at basketball tfames will
make the customary sinking of
the Stanford llymn possible at the
U.C.L.A. basketball game tonight,

The Bruin starting lineup which j

Boasting of a two-point-a-minute 1
average, the Uclans seem to pos

coast. Don Barksdale, conference j

team. With a fine shot, plenty of

CARDINAL STARTERS
Coach Everett Dean when cor-,
nered in his office prior to yester
day's practice session had this to
say about the coming contests over
the weekend, "The Stanford team is
not overawed by U.C.L.A.'s high
scoring victories of last work. Mow
ever, we must play our best ball to
beat them and we are hoping for
just that."
The Cardinal quintet which will
play host to the West wood Wonders
includes Morley Thompson, Dave
Davidson, Steve Stephenson, Babe
Higgins, and Dick Berlin. Gus Cha
valas, the short but speedy forward,
will probably se«? quite a deal of
action against the Bruins if they at
tempt to use a "scatter-ball" of
fense.
TWO U.C.L.A. SQI'ADS
The Uclans arc reportedly expect
ing to use two squads against the
Indians. The .first team would be
composed of Don Barksdale, Davage
Minor, John Stanich, Dick West,
and Dick Perry. The second ag
gregation would have these men on
the floor: Big-boy Lee, Dave Buc
cola. Chuck Cluska, Chick Sale, and
Dick Rankin.
Varsity games will be preceded by
a B squad game on Friday and a
Jayvee clash on Saturday. Starting
time for the prelims has been set
for 6:15, with the varsity set-to at 8.

CARDINAL STARTERS
Coach Everett Dean when cor-,
nered in his office prior to yester
day's practice session had this to
say about the coming contests over
the weekend, "The Stanford team is
not overawed by U.C.L.A.'s high
scoring victories of last work. Mow
ever, we must play our best ball to
beat them and we are hoping for
just that."
The Cardinal quintet which will
play host to the West wood Wonders
includes Morley Thompson, Dave
Davidson, Steve Stephenson, Babe
Higgins, and Dick Berlin. Gus Cha
valas, the short but speedy forward,
will probably se«? quite a deal of
action against the Bruins if they at
tempt to use a "scatter-ball" of
fense.
TWO U.C.L.A. SQI'ADS
The Uclans arc reportedly expect
ing to use two squads against the
Indians. The .first team would be
composed of Don Barksdale, Davage
Minor, John Stanich, Dick West,
and Dick Perry. The second ag
gregation would have these men on
the floor: Big-boy Lee, Dave Buc
cola. Chuck Cluska, Chick Sale, and
Dick Rankin.
Varsity games will be preceded by
a B squad game on Friday and a
Jayvee clash on Saturday. Starting
time for the prelims has been set
for 6:15, with the varsity set-to at 8.

With the West Coast's biggest
sports attraction scheduled for the
Pavilion come the weekend, the
Indians wrnt through a light work
out yesterday before they tackle the
rampaging Uclans tonight. Some of
the Card starters were excused from
the practice session and w°rc given
the day of! in order to allow them
to rest before the rough and tough
series.
Having already discounted the re

play, the Westwood Wonders have

DECIDES PLAYOFF
A double victory over the Indians
would certainly assure U.C.L.A. the
right to meet Oregon State in the
playoffs. Anything short of that
would keep the Southern Division
championship on ice, while a double
defeat would skyrocket Stanford
into a tie for first place, and dis
prove the theory that lightning nev
er strikes twice in the same place.

Boasting of a two-point-a-minute 1
average, the Uclans seem to pos

coast. Don Barksdale, conference j
high scorer, is the sparkplug of the
team. With a fine shot, plenty of
