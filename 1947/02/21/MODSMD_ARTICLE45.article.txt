# Stanford Nine Meets Weltners
## 
### 
It's revenge d;iy tomorrow for the
Farm's baseball crew. Coach Harry
Wolter's lads tackle the Weltner
Motors nine in a rematch on the
Stanford diamond at 2 p.m. and will
be out to erase a semi-blot on an
otherwise unblemished slate.
The Cards have played three
games to date, tying one and win
ning the other two. The tie came
two Saturday's ago when this same
Weltner outfit punclted over two
runs in a ninth-inning rally to cre
ate a 5-5 stalemate and then headed
home when darkness set in.
Since that time the locals added
the scalps of the Portola Natives and
Alameda Naval Air Station to their
collection, showing marked im
provement in both contests.
STERLING HURLING IMPRESSES
The finest showing of the varsity
this season came Tuesday when a
combination of fine fielding, timely
hitting, and sterling hurling sent
Alameda's service squad home on
the short end of a (5-0 whitewashing.
It was the pitching in particular
that stood out. Righthanders Frank
Laßrum and Larry Wolf spent three
innings apiece on the filing line and
gave up a total of three walks be
tween them. In only two of their
six innings of service did Alameda
men reach first base.
With a 4-0 margin after six frames
Coach Wolter decided to give the
rest of the staff some exercise and
sent Lefty Dave Dahle, Dick Flat
land, and Dave Scott on the mound
for a round each—ex-grid star Flat
land giving up the lone hit of the
game.
McCiKAW PROVIDES THRILL
Biggest thrill of the game was
provided in the third inning by
Frank McGraw, sprinting Card
backstop. McGraw opened the bot
tom half of the third by lacing a
single into left field and went to sec
ond on a wild pitch. With Al Kir
cher at bat McGraw suddenly strea
ked for third, heading down the
base path like a runaway locomo
tive. The play at the hot corner was
close but McGraw was thrown out
by a few feet. (—Seems like Kir
clier missed a hit-and-run signal—
and Mac ain't on the track sciuad!)
STARHXG LINEUP LISTED
Probable starting lineup for to
morrow's tilt will have either Mc-
Graw or Ward Walkup behind the
but, Benny Cardinalli on first, Bob
Peters or Ted Nell on second, Buck
Brownson on short. Bill Arce or
Ralph Davis on third, and Ray Win
terhalter, Lloyd Merriman, and Lou
Gowans in the outfield. Chuck
Wakefield, Don Pendergrass, and
Forrest Shumway are ready for
mound duty in addition to the quin
tet used Tuesday.

ond on a wild pitch. With Al Kir
cher at bat McGraw suddenly strea
ked for third, heading down the
base path like a runaway locomo
tive. The play at the hot corner was
close but McGraw was thrown out
by a few feet. (—Seems like Kir
clier missed a hit-and-run signal—
and Mac ain't on the track sciuad!)
STARHXG LINEUP LISTED
Probable starting lineup for to
morrow's tilt will have either Mc-
Graw or Ward Walkup behind the
but, Benny Cardinalli on first, Bob
Peters or Ted Nell on second, Buck
Brownson on short. Bill Arce or
Ralph Davis on third, and Ray Win
terhalter, Lloyd Merriman, and Lou
Gowans in the outfield. Chuck
Wakefield, Don Pendergrass, and
Forrest Shumway are ready for
mound duty in addition to the quin
tet used Tuesday.
It's revenge d;iy tomorrow for the
Farm's baseball crew. Coach Harry
Wolter's lads tackle the Weltner
Motors nine in a rematch on the
Stanford diamond at 2 p.m. and will
be out to erase a semi-blot on an
otherwise unblemished slate.
The Cards have played three
games to date, tying one and win
ning the other two. The tie came
two Saturday's ago when this same
Weltner outfit punclted over two
runs in a ninth-inning rally to cre
ate a 5-5 stalemate and then headed
home when darkness set in.
Since that time the locals added
the scalps of the Portola Natives and
Alameda Naval Air Station to their
collection, showing marked im
provement in both contests.
STERLING HURLING IMPRESSES
The finest showing of the varsity
this season came Tuesday when a
combination of fine fielding, timely
hitting, and sterling hurling sent
Alameda's service squad home on
the short end of a (5-0 whitewashing.
It was the pitching in particular
that stood out. Righthanders Frank
Laßrum and Larry Wolf spent three
innings apiece on the filing line and
gave up a total of three walks be
tween them. In only two of their
six innings of service did Alameda
men reach first base.
With a 4-0 margin after six frames
Coach Wolter decided to give the
rest of the staff some exercise and
sent Lefty Dave Dahle, Dick Flat
land, and Dave Scott on the mound
for a round each—ex-grid star Flat
land giving up the lone hit of the
game.
McCiKAW PROVIDES THRILL
Biggest thrill of the game was
provided in the third inning by
Frank McGraw, sprinting Card
backstop. McGraw opened the bot
tom half of the third by lacing a
single into left field and went to sec
ond on a wild pitch. With Al Kir
cher at bat McGraw suddenly strea
ked for third, heading down the
base path like a runaway locomo
tive. The play at the hot corner was

by a few feet. (—Seems like Kir
