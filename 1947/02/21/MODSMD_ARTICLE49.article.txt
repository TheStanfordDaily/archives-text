## How Vague Can We Get? 
### 
The mounting confusion resulting from the
numerous groups on campus interested in in
ternationalism came to an overdue climax at
Wednesday's Excom meeting forcing Excom
to set a two-week deadline on the groups to
"straighten things out."
The job of bringing sense out of the jumble
and of co-ordinating their activities was tossed
to a committee headed by Beth Mac Vicar, and
including Babs Wilbur and Frank Creede.
A mass of suggestions are in order to Excom
members, international group committeemen,
and to the student body.
Excom first approved the ISC plan without
considering in any detail just how to carry out
its vague ideal "to establish an organization
which will promote international awareness
on campus."
This action and the free-hand which Excom
gave to all groups believing in all or some
portion of this ideal are responsible for the
confusion today.
The internationalists are dealing in a spirit
or a personal feeling, motivated by a desire
for Stanford students to better understand
the peoples of the world and their problems,
which is very difficult to put into words.
This "spirit" caught on at Excom arid each
Excom member as well as each student who
feels somewhat the same, has embellished it
with his own personal interpretations, until
now there are as many international plans on
campus as there are persons interested in the
idea.
The jealousy with which international

ij
groups guard their world-bettering plans, and
their apparent inability and reticence to put
their feelings into words, plus Excom's hesi
tation to pin down responsibility for action,
has so confused the student body that it's no
wonder the reaction is one of over-done cyni
cism.
Possibly a reaUy fine "idea" has been pro
posed. But it is so broad and encompassing
that it is difficult for a person's mind to absorb,
much less accept.
But if the "idea" is to win the support of a
large portion of the students and grow over a
period of five or ten years, a rather definite .
plan must be set down on paper for everyone
to see. The plan will have to be very flexible
and project several years ahead.
But there must be a written plan— some
thing that is more tangible than an ideal— j
which reveals the over-all picture and places
each subordinate phase in its proper perspec
tive.
Until this is attempted students have a per-,
feet right to be extremely critical.
We believe in the idea of internationalism— j
that is, something to promote in us an aware
ness and better understanding of the rest of
the world—but we are not at all sure that the
present campus attempt will achieve even a
portion of this objective.
We're willing to bide our time for two more
weeks, and to urge the rest of the students to
do so, but some changes and results had bet
ter be forthcoming at the end of that period.
