### CARL HEINTZE 
"Well, laddie, trying to write a column again?"
Emery Bellwether said over my shoulder.
"Mr. Bellwether! Back again, eh? What do you
think about KSU?"
"What pray tell is that, my boy? Some new com
mit lee F.xcom has formed? These alphabetical agen
cies are as bad as the New Deal days. Why I re
member—"
"No, sir, KSU is the campus radio station. It broad
casts over iho wiring system in Toyon, Lagunita, and
the Village."
"Ah, to he sure. As I was saying, wc tried to do
the same thing before the war. Through the sewer
pipes. Poor reception though. Had to give it up."
"What do you think of KSU, Mr. Bellwether?"
Tine Great Man laid his shabby length down on
the copy desk, leaned his head against one of the
typewriters, and pondered the thought for a moment.
"Laddie, er-ah, Henzel, they are missing a great
opportunity."
"How do you mean, sir." Emery helped himself to
my pouch of Sir Walter, and my pipe before he an
swered. * fit* |
"Here's what I mean. They ought to broadcast
classes, It's been tried before, in the city of Denver,
I believe. Perfectly simple. Instead of going through
all the torture of an 8 o'clock, you merely roll over,
switch on the radio, and there you have the lecture
at your bedside."
"But. Mr. Bellwether . ..." I interrupted.
"Simplicity in itself. Of course, there are some
courses where it would be a little difficult, labs, life
classes in graphic arts, things like that.
"Well, you might have something there," I ad
mitted.
"I can see it now." Emery said. "One wouldn't have
to leave the room all day. Just sit there by the radio
taking notes. First Western Civ—then Psych 51.
Think of it, Western Civilization dramatized over the

air. Nero's fiddle playing while wo hoar (he sound
of Rome burning, a running narrative of the run
from Marathon!" Bellwether blew a large smoke
ring at n girl who was passing.
'"But what about the professors?" I asked. "How
many of them have ever broadcast?"
The Great Man frowned deeply. "Ah. there is the
great drawback. There are so few of the academic
mind who have a flair for the dramatic. It would bo
rather dull listening at that, laddie, I'm afraid."
"Yes, sir," I said.
""Oh. of course it would be much easier than sitting
in a class. You could shut them ofT any time you
wanted to." Emery regarded this thought with a
smile.
"Sir, the Honor Code!" I said.
"Ah. yes, quite true, laddie, the Honor Code. On
second thought the present system is far superior,
I'm afraid. You can go to sleep with a clear consci
ence. At least you're in the class." The Great Man
heaved his length up off the copy desk, knocked the
ashes from my pipe and handed it back to me. "Fine
tobacco you have there, son. Anything else on your
mind today?"
"Well, sir, the fraternities have pledged again."
"Was that all the noise I heard the other night?
Woke me out of a sound sleep."
"Why, sir? Where do you live these days?"
"I've been fortunate enough to get a shelf in the
Library stacks. Very comfortable exccpt for—ah.
washing facilities."
"It must be rather crowded."
"A little. Look me up some time, laddie. I'm be
tween Shakespeare and Shaw. Fourth shelf from the
end on the third floor."
"Indeed I shall, sir."
Emery tightened his coat a trifle, and swept off
down the hall through piles of copy paper and coke
bottles to the Library, the Quad, or God knows
where.
