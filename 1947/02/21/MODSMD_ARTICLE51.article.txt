Thitvjs look bad for Davjd Lilienthal,- I-^e^tdeiit
Truman's nominee as chairman of the Atomic Energy
Commission. He has been the object of one of the
most reprehensible smear campaigns in many a year.
Character assassins have been working overtime, do
ing their utmost to ruin his career.
To me, this is all extremely nauseating. Mr. Lilien
thal's record as a public servant has never at any
time been other than honorable. He has been an
honest, efficient administrator.
How anyone could demand more from a man is
hard to understand. If he is rejected by the Senate—
and there is almost an even chance that he will be—
it may be assumed by the public that integrity and
loyal service are not desirable attributes for a public
official.
The Tennessee Valley Authority under Mr. Lilien
thal was transformed into a model of how govern
ment-owned public utilities should be operated; for
merly it had been a political football—used for prac
tice by the second team.
His very efficiency—and refusal to play politics
i-> to blame for his present predicament. Sen. Ken
neth McKellar, an irascible old man from Tennessee,
has been trying to "get" him for years—merely be
cause he refused to provide soft jobs for the senator's
political friends. Mr. Lilienthal thought it his duty
to hire men who knew their jobs; to run T.V.A. as
he would run a private business.
Senator McKellar is the leader of those who are
fighting to block approval of Mr. Lilienthal's nomina
tion. He has harried the man to the point of perse
cution. After standing up under a heartless goading

*' 4 i
for hours, Mr. Lilienthal made one of the finest, deli- |
nit ions of Americanism extant; it should go down in
history alongside the Gettysburg Address.
There isn't room tv run it here in its entirety, bul
in part lie said . . All government and all private j
institutions must he designed to promote and defend i
the integrity and dignity of the individual. . . . The
individual Comes first.'' Communism, he said, puts j
Ihc state first: men are used as mere expedients. He j
made it plain that Communism epitomizes all the j
things he thinks a governmental philosophy should
not be.
But, you ask. even though David Lilientha! is an j
honest and able man, what docs he know about
atomic power? Well, the famous Barueh report— j
the most logic.il plan for atomic control yet worked
out —is largely his work. Bernard Barueh himself i
(he's hardly considered a fellow traveler) has in- |
dorsed him. It's hard to see how any man could (
come more highly recommended.
However—there's a good chance Mr. Lilienlhal
will be rejected and some lesser man chosen. Sena- j
lor McKellar has friends in the Democratic party |
who will follow his lead. Many Republicans are
treating the matter as merely another political do;,
light rather than as one of the most serious affairs I
that have arisen since the end of the war. Senator
Vandenberg is expected to vote for confirmation, but
Senator Taft is supposedly on the other side. He's
a powerful man; he has a lot of influence.
Mr. Lilienthal is the natural man for the job; he
has proven it in the past. If the Republicans block
his confirmation because of mere partisanship, they j
will be doing their country great harm.
