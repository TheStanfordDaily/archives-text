# Weidman Dances Delight Audience
## 
### 
Charles Weidman and featured
[ members of his modern dance group,
| Peter Hamilton, Saida Gerrard, and
i Betty Osgood, delighted a half-filled
! Memorial Auditorium last night with
1 the informality and strength of
j their numbers.
Hamilton and Miss Osgood in
particular captivated the audience;
Hamilton in his solo number "Jesse
James," based on a poem by W. R.
Bonet, and as Fire in "And Daddy
I Was a Fireman," and Miss Osgood
I with her comic pantomime through
! out the program.
Weidman, in the most serious
| number, "A House Divided," pro
i vided continuity and masterfulness
| in his role of Lincoln stating his
j democratic ideals. An interesting
j feature was the way in which the
| Voice, speaking for Lincoln, was
1 worked into the dance without dis-
I rupting the total efTect of slave
against white.
Accompanied only by a piano, and
with prop changes made by the
I troupe in full view of the audience,
the group nevertheless brought the
spectators right onto the stage and
into the spirit of the dances with
them.
Weidman, described by critics as l
"our leading male dancer," is cur- j
rcntly touring the West for the first j
'time in eight years.â€”Hanson
