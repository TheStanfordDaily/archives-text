# AVC Head Recommends Support of Baruch Plan, Compulsory Disarmament
## 
### 
Two general planks, backed by
more specific action at a later date,
were proposed as a solution to our
present international dilemma by
Charles G. Bolte, national chairman
of AVC, in a speech last night at
Cubberley Auditorium.
The two planks were: direct sup
port of the Barueh report on inter
national control of atomic energy to
be adopted without veto powers in
the Security Council of the U.N.;
and direct support of the proposal
to make disarmament a compulsory
international procedure, backed by
a strong international police force.
POSITION CLARIFIED
Before entering into the discus
sion of international affairs, Bolte
clarified his position as a member
of AVC by stating that "The basic
intent of A.VC is to do away with
veterans' organizations by doing
away with war, which creates vet
era nsi"
He pointed out that the U.N. char
ter as it now stands deals with the
non - causes of war, but that if
amended it may make the basis for
a lasting peace, and do away with
the anarchy of nationalist nations
which now exists.
WAR AND PEACE
Bolte pointed out that under the
present U.N. set-up we would be
forced to go to war to defend the
peace and urged that a small group
can cause a large stir if they apply
their action as a unit and organize
for the program they want.
Bolte, in an open question period
which followed the main speech,
when questioned specifically how he
felt about a school sending students
overseas on a survey gave the an
swer, "I think it is a fine idea."
When requestioned on the same
subject he retorted, "I think it
would be insane for me to get into
a campus controversy."
