# Bruins Upset by Cardinal Rally
## Westwooders Miss Chance To Cinch Title 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
The Westwood Bruins Saturday
night failed to put the clincher on
the Pacific Coast Conference South
ern Division title by dropping a HH
to 53 brawl to the Stanford Indians,
after they had routed the locals the
evening before, stt to 39.
Heavily favored to remove all
doubt as to who the 1947 champ
would be, the Uclans crumbled be
fore a determined second-half Stan
ford rally featuring Bob Lewis, a
lanky substitute. Lewis rode herd
on the great Don Barksdale, smoth- ,
oring most of his shots as the ball |
left his hands.
SECOND-HALF RALLY
Stanford left the floor at half-time
trailing 32 to 29, hut put on a su.s
lained rally after the intermission
which left the Los Angeles boys
gasping for breath. Lewis tied the
score at 36-all after four minutes of j
play. He missed a free throw, but
followed through and scored on a
tip-in. Seconds later he put the
Cards in front with a free throw.
Bruin forward Dick Perry man
aged to tie the score at 38-all, but ;
Babe Higgins put the Indians in ,
front to stay with a lay-up shot.
Saturday night's shindig was one I
of the roughest seen on the Pavilion !
floor in a long time. Forty-five fouls |
were called, 25 of them on the
visitors. Davage Minor, Don Barks
dale, Dick West, and Morley
Thompson all were benched by per
sonals late in the game. Referee
Lloyd Leith and Umpire Louis Bat
male frequently lost control of play
during both games.
THOMPSON IS HIGH POINT MAN
High point man for the evening
was Morley Thompson with 21
points. Young Morley, having one
of his hottest nights in several se
ries, peppered the basket at will 1
during the second half. Of his 21
points, 18 were poured through the
basket after intermission. He made
lay-ups, hit from the corner, and

j dropped in two left-handed push
| shots from 25 feet out.
Babe liiggins and Bill Stephen
son scored 14 and 13 points for
Stanford. respectively. Davage
Minor topped the visitors with 12.
Bill Stephenson had four person- '
; als called against him in the first !
halt antl Coach Everett Dean re- j
placed him with Lewis. The lanky-
Lewis, who once played on a na- ]
I tional championship Utah squad,
came through with his best game of
tlit 1 year.
With him in the game, the locals
i seemed to 2 ise above themselves. ;
Throughout the first half the game
| seemed a carbon copy of the pre- i
I vious evening's losing effort, but
during the last 20 minutes they
tightened up and stopped the West
-1 wooders' murderous fast break. The ;
floor play of *Lewis and the offensive
drive of Thompson featured the sue- J
j cessful comeback effort.
lIIGGINS IN TOP FORM
Best all-around man on the floor
; was Babe Higgins. His ball han
dling was instrumental in slowing
down the race-horse Bruins to a
speed with which the slower Cards
j could cope. Offensively he was his
j usual steady self—he has averaged
| 12 points a game for the last six !
contests.
Little Johnny Stanieh was re
sponsible for the Uclans' half-time
lead. He swished in five 30-footers j
I in the opening stanza and, with one i
foul shot, led the scoring at that
i time with 11 points. He was covered
| much more closely in the second
half and was held scoreless.
The outstanding Bruin, how
ever. was dusky Davage Minor.
He is one of the classiest cagers
seen on the Pacific Coast in years.
He's the key man in Westwood's
fast break, and an outstanding |
shot and floor man. His speed and
stamina are phenomenal. When
he left the game on personal fouls
late in the Saturday night contest
the partisan Pavilion crowd gave
him an ovation.
Instrumental in the visitors' Fri- j
day night win over the locals was a
! close pressing defense which kept j
j Stanford at a disadvantage. Also a j
factor was the Indians' inability to j
beg, borrow or steal a field goal in
the first part of the second half. Ev
j erett Dean's Boys controlled the ball
j most of the time, but were tempo- j
j rarily unable to hit the bucket.
Bruin shooting accuracy was
little short of amazing. They took
only s(i shots at the hoop but
caged 21 of them for a 37 per cent
average. The Cards took 71 shots
but only 15 were good for a lowly
21 per cent average.
The Indians found it hard to pen- '

etrate the Westwooders' tight man
to - man defense; most of their
shooting was from out beyond the
foul line. Minor and Barksdale
broke into the slot repeatedly to
sink lay-ups and post shots. They
tied for scoring honors with 14
points apiece. Hinh for Stanford
were Thompson and Gus Chavalas
with eight.

j erett Dean's Boys controlled the ball
j most of the time, but were tempo- j
j rarily unable to hit the bucket.
Bruin shooting accuracy was
little short of amazing. They took
only s(i shots at the hoop but
caged 21 of them for a 37 per cent
average. The Cards took 71 shots
but only 15 were good for a lowly
21 per cent average.
The Indians found it hard to pen- '

etrate the Westwooders' tight man
to - man defense; most of their
shooting was from out beyond the
foul line. Minor and Barksdale
broke into the slot repeatedly to
sink lay-ups and post shots. They
tied for scoring honors with 14
points apiece. Hinh for Stanford
were Thompson and Gus Chavalas
with eight.
The Westwood Bruins Saturday

Heavily favored to remove all
doubt as to who the 1947 champ

left his hands.
SECOND-HALF RALLY
Stanford left the floor at half-time

Saturday night's shindig was one I

points. Young Morley, having one
of his hottest nights in several se

during the second half. Of his 21
points, 18 were poured through the
basket after intermission. He made
lay-ups, hit from the corner, and

contests.
Little Johnny Stanieh was re

j could cope. Offensively he was his
j usual steady self—he has averaged
| 12 points a game for the last six !
contests.
Little Johnny Stanieh was re
sponsible for the Uclans' half-time
lead. He swished in five 30-footers j
I in the opening stanza and, with one i
foul shot, led the scoring at that
i time with 11 points. He was covered
| much more closely in the second
half and was held scoreless.
The outstanding Bruin, how
ever. was dusky Davage Minor.
He is one of the classiest cagers
seen on the Pacific Coast in years.
He's the key man in Westwood's
fast break, and an outstanding |
shot and floor man. His speed and
stamina are phenomenal. When
he left the game on personal fouls
late in the Saturday night contest
the partisan Pavilion crowd gave
him an ovation.
Instrumental in the visitors' Fri- j
day night win over the locals was a
! close pressing defense which kept j
j Stanford at a disadvantage. Also a j
factor was the Indians' inability to j
beg, borrow or steal a field goal in
the first part of the second half. Ev
j erett Dean's Boys controlled the ball
j most of the time, but were tempo- j
j rarily unable to hit the bucket.
Bruin shooting accuracy was
little short of amazing. They took
only s(i shots at the hoop but
caged 21 of them for a 37 per cent
average. The Cards took 71 shots
but only 15 were good for a lowly
21 per cent average.
The Indians found it hard to pen- '

etrate the Westwooders' tight man
to - man defense; most of their
shooting was from out beyond the
foul line. Minor and Barksdale
broke into the slot repeatedly to
sink lay-ups and post shots. They
tied for scoring honors with 14
points apiece. Hinh for Stanford
were Thompson and Gus Chavalas
with eight.
The Westwood Bruins Saturday
night failed to put the clincher on
the Pacific Coast Conference South
ern Division title by dropping a HH
to 53 brawl to the Stanford Indians,
after they had routed the locals the
evening before, stt to 39.
Heavily favored to remove all
doubt as to who the 1947 champ
would be, the Uclans crumbled be
fore a determined second-half Stan
ford rally featuring Bob Lewis, a
lanky substitute. Lewis rode herd
on the great Don Barksdale, smoth- ,
oring most of his shots as the ball |
left his hands.
SECOND-HALF RALLY
Stanford left the floor at half-time
trailing 32 to 29, hut put on a su.s
lained rally after the intermission
which left the Los Angeles boys
gasping for breath. Lewis tied the
score at 36-all after four minutes of j
play. He missed a free throw, but
followed through and scored on a
tip-in. Seconds later he put the
Cards in front with a free throw.
Bruin forward Dick Perry man
aged to tie the score at 38-all, but ;
Babe Higgins put the Indians in ,
front to stay with a lay-up shot.
Saturday night's shindig was one I
of the roughest seen on the Pavilion !
floor in a long time. Forty-five fouls |
were called, 25 of them on the
visitors. Davage Minor, Don Barks
dale, Dick West, and Morley
Thompson all were benched by per
sonals late in the game. Referee
Lloyd Leith and Umpire Louis Bat
male frequently lost control of play
during both games.
THOMPSON IS HIGH POINT MAN
High point man for the evening
was Morley Thompson with 21
points. Young Morley, having one
of his hottest nights in several se
ries, peppered the basket at will 1
during the second half. Of his 21
points, 18 were poured through the
basket after intermission. He made
lay-ups, hit from the corner, and
