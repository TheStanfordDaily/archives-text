# Carl Maier, Head of Grounds Gang, Describes "Good Old Days' on Quad
## 
### STUART FITCH 
Stanford is just one big happy
family, but when it comes to know
ing brother and sister Farmers, av
erage University personnel perk up
their ears only to the names of bet- j
ter - known faculty and campus !
"wheels."
Just as important and vital in a
smooth-running university arc the
unknown janitors, dining hall at
tendants, clerical staff members,
building and grounds maintenance
men.
Heading the grounds gang down
at the nursery is Carl H. Maier, who j
is just about as Stanford as the old j
Senator himself. Maier first came j
to the University in 1905, and with
the exception of three years has put
in time on the Farm ever since.
BORN IN GERMANY
Maier, 72, is the oldest worker
on the grounds crew. He was born
in Germany, and came to this coun- j
try in 1892. He is married, and has I
four children and four grandchil- i
dren.
Making Stanford a Maier family |
affair, his son, Carl, Jr., is assistant ;
engineer, and his daughter. Louise. J
secretary to the director of the Uni
versity libraries.
Maier can spin a mighty yarn
about the old days on Quad anil
who and what were in the news.
One old duffer ho recalls in par- I

ticular. He was a gardener named
J Kelly.
Kelly joined tin- family in Sacra -
| monto, where he did gardening at.
: the Stanford home. Ho got pretty
thick with his boss, and the Senator
handed out some pretty hot tips on
the stock market.
Kelly invested his wages accord
ingly, and by the time he moved
down to Palo Alto to join the Uni
versity crcw, he had a neat and
comforting bank account, of over a
quarter of a million dollars.
FAMOUSLY DIRTY
| But there was something definite
ily Scotch about the 80-year-old
' Kelly, Maier said, and he didn't
! spend his money. Instead he set up
housekeeping in a little shanty
across from the Stanfords' coach
house, and refused to even invest
in a cake of soap. Result: Kelly was
famously dirty.
Maier remembers the time Ihe
j ancient Kelly got sick and was toted
off to the hospital. The doctor's first
| prescription was a good scrub
j down and a bed with clean sheets.
"Then Kelly really got mad," Mai
j er said; "he wanted to go home."
When Maier first came to the
| Farm the Senator had about 100
! Chinese workers taking care of "the
I private place" alone.
"There was a Chinaman for every
leaf," Maier said, "and as soon as a
{ leaf fell off a tree, one of the gar-

doners would run out and pick it

Senator Stanford assigned some
of the Chinese workers to tlie Uni
versity, and they set up a little set
tlement of their own down in the
woods near the Cactus Garden.
Those were the days when Stan
ford students went down that way
to look at the cacti. One of the Chi
nese did nothing but keep the place
in shape. "You couldn't see a weed
in the garden," Maier said.
TONCi WARS
When the Chinese New Year
rolled around all hands put in a
hard week of celebration. "They
set ofT firecrackers to scare the "dee
vi 1 away," Maier said.
During one tong war the place
was really in an uproar. The Ori
entals got so scared they built a
high board fence topped with
barbed wire all around their colony.
To fortify themselves further, they
went to Maier to see if he could get
them a dog. He took them to the
basement of the anatomy building,
and the men picked out a likely
looking specimen.
About four days later one of the
Chinese came running over to the
nursery loudly explaining "Doggee
l no talkee. doggee no talkee." Maier
! helped him work a trade-in, and
| the settlement rested in peace with
| its newly acquired "talkee doggee"
I to serve as watchman.
