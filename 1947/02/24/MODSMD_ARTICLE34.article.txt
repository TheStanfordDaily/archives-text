(Tliis is the third of the series of
articles covering the countries to be
visited in the ASSU-sponsored
summer surVey trips.)
Two purposes predominate for the
! selection of Czechoslovakia as one
of the countries to be visited during
the ASSU sponsored summer survey
trips, according to Czechoslovakia
committee chairman, fis
c-her.
"The survey student will be able
to report interesting and valuable
I information as to the Czecholovak
j ian experiment of attempting to in
j tegrate socialism with political dem
| ocracy. Czechoslovakia, with ap
proximately 60 p»r cent of her in-
I dustry socialized, had absolute po-
I litical freedom in her elections held
! last year," Fischer explained.
"To what extent this experiment
may succeed will have great influ
[ once over the other European na-
I lions. Czechoslovakia and Great
Britain are two nations in Europe
j seriously attempting this experi
ment."
"Czechoslovakia is the only eoun-
J try to be visited which is believed
j to be in the so-called eastern block
i and the viewpoint of this section
j should be included as to the existing
j east-west disagreements."
Another major reason for includ
; ing Czechoslovakia in the survey
i trips is that the Farm student will
j be able to attend the World Youth
j Festival to be held in Prague in
1 July, stated Fischer. He also said
; that to date delegations from GO dif
i ferent countries have promised to
I attend; Prague, the old capital of
j Czechoslovakia will be the head
i quarters of the survey student.
| A travel plan will be worked out
I from political, economic and social
| points of view according to the
j wishes of Stanford students and ths
ISC, according to Fischer.
Universities which will be visited
I include: the Charles University in
Prague which will celebrate its GOOth
anniversary next year, and the unj
j versifies in Bratislava and Brno,
continued Fischer; contacts with the

Czechoslovakia Union of Students
will be arranged for the Farm trav
eler.
The Czechoslovakia!! Ministry of
Foreign Affairs will write letters of
recommendation for the Farm stu
dent and will also help arrange in
terviews for him with members of
the government, journalists, and la
bor union leaders, states Fischer.
Nationalized industries, private in
dustries, and farms will be visited,
said Fischer; the American Em
bassy will also help to arrange con
tacts.
Cities which should be visited in
clude: Bratislava, thi present capital
of Slovakia and one of the main
river ports of the Danube; Brno, the
capital of Moravia; Kosice, a town
in eastern Slovakia. It was incor
porated into Hungary after the 1938

Two purposes predominate for the
! selection of Czechoslovakia as one
of the countries to be visited during
the ASSU sponsored summer survey
trips, according to Czechoslovakia
committee chairman, fis
c-her.
"The survey student will be able
to report interesting and valuable
I information as to the Czecholovak
j ian experiment of attempting to in
j tegrate socialism with political dem
| ocracy. Czechoslovakia, with ap
proximately 60 p»r cent of her in-
I dustry socialized, had absolute po-
I litical freedom in her elections held
! last year," Fischer explained.
"To what extent this experiment
may succeed will have great influ
[ once over the other European na-
I lions. Czechoslovakia and Great
Britain are two nations in Europe
j seriously attempting this experi
ment."
"Czechoslovakia is the only eoun-
J try to be visited which is believed
j to be in the so-called eastern block
i and the viewpoint of this section
j should be included as to the existing
j east-west disagreements."
Another major reason for includ
; ing Czechoslovakia in the survey
i trips is that the Farm student will
j be able to attend the World Youth
j Festival to be held in Prague in
1 July, stated Fischer. He also said
; that to date delegations from GO dif
i ferent countries have promised to
I attend; Prague, the old capital of
j Czechoslovakia will be the head
i quarters of the survey student.
| A travel plan will be worked out
I from political, economic and social
| points of view according to the
j wishes of Stanford students and ths
ISC, according to Fischer.
Universities which will be visited
I include: the Charles University in
Prague which will celebrate its GOOth
anniversary next year, and the unj
j versifies in Bratislava and Brno,
continued Fischer; contacts with the

Czechoslovakia Union of Students
will be arranged for the Farm trav
eler.
The Czechoslovakia!! Ministry of
Foreign Affairs will write letters of
recommendation for the Farm stu
dent and will also help arrange in
terviews for him with members of
the government, journalists, and la
bor union leaders, states Fischer.
Nationalized industries, private in
dustries, and farms will be visited,
said Fischer; the American Em
bassy will also help to arrange con
tacts.
Cities which should be visited in
clude: Bratislava, thi present capital
of Slovakia and one of the main
river ports of the Danube; Brno, the
capital of Moravia; Kosice, a town
in eastern Slovakia. It was incor
porated into Hungary after the 1938
Munich agreement; Moravska Os
trava, an important industrial iron
