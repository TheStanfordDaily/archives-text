# Indian Rugb Team Whips University Club
## Farm Squad Wins, 22-3, In Pushover 
### 
Led by Bob Brodie and Fred
Willy, Stanford's rugby team ran
rampant over the University Club
by a 22 to 3 score Saturday after
noon on ibt- victor's field.
A crowd of 350 saw Brodie put
on a great kicking exhibition as he
scored 10 points by means of three
conversions and a running drop
kick. Fred Willy was like the
proverbial bull in the china shop as
he lugged the oversized football
across the goal twice for six points.
WILLY SCORES FIRST
Stanford's first score came soon
after the kickoff when Willy picked
Up a loose ball five yards out and
dashed across for a try.
Later in the half, Brodie made
the best play of the day when he
drop kicked the ball 15 yards
through the uprights while on the
run.
The Cards' rough style of play
was too much for the lighter Club
players and Stanford controlled the
ball most of the half.
On a play developing out of a
serum on the five yard line, Willy
took a lateral and scored another
try. Bob Brodie kicked the con
version as the half ended: Stanford,
12; University Club, 0.
CLl'l! FIGHTS BACK
As the second half opened, Stan
lord took, t,he. ball deep into Club
territory and kept it there, threat- j
ening to score several times. The
Club, however, withstood the attack
ajnd finally worked the ball back up
t lie field.
The visitors were then -given a
penalty kick which Ted Donald,
Club fullback, made good from 30
yards out to give the University
Club its only score.
From then on the Club was never
in the game. John Beatty, playing
in Stanford's scrum, scored the next
try by falling on the ball across the
goal. The automatic Mr. Brodie then
stepped up and kicked another con
version to make it 17-3. \
LI PELT RUNS WILD
Don Lipelt, who had made several
line runs, took the ball a minute
later and scored Stanford's last try.
lirodro again converted to make the
final score read, 22 to 3.
Stanford's scrum played their
usual aggressive game and "packed
around" well, as they say in the rug- i
by vernacular. A trio of backs i
Irom the football team: Don Lipelt,
AI Morris, and Fred Willy, looked
best carrying the ball in a game
which featured some fine broken I
field running, in the kicking de- 1
partment, Jack Reynolds, fullback, I
and scrum half Brodie did a first ;
rate job.
FORMER BEAR PLAYERS
Ted Donald was the star on the 1
University Club which is composed |
of former Cal rugby players. Three

extra bleachers.

try by falling on the ball across the
goal. The automatic Mr. Brodie then
stepped up and kicked another con

final score read, 22 to 3.
Stanford's scrum played their
usual aggressive game and "packed
around" well, as they say in the rug- i
by vernacular. A trio of backs i
Irom the football team: Don Lipelt,
AI Morris, and Fred Willy, looked
best carrying the ball in a game
which featured some fine broken I
field running, in the kicking de- 1
partment, Jack Reynolds, fullback, I
and scrum half Brodie did a first ;
rate job.

Led by Bob Brodie and Fred
Willy, Stanford's rugby team ran
rampant over the University Club
by a 22 to 3 score Saturday after
noon on ibt- victor's field.
A crowd of 350 saw Brodie put
on a great kicking exhibition as he
scored 10 points by means of three
conversions and a running drop
kick. Fred Willy was like the
proverbial bull in the china shop as
he lugged the oversized football
across the goal twice for six points.
WILLY SCORES FIRST
Stanford's first score came soon
after the kickoff when Willy picked
Up a loose ball five yards out and
dashed across for a try.
Later in the half, Brodie made
the best play of the day when he
drop kicked the ball 15 yards
through the uprights while on the
run.
The Cards' rough style of play
was too much for the lighter Club
players and Stanford controlled the
ball most of the half.
On a play developing out of a
serum on the five yard line, Willy
took a lateral and scored another
try. Bob Brodie kicked the con
version as the half ended: Stanford,
12; University Club, 0.
CLl'l! FIGHTS BACK
As the second half opened, Stan
lord took, t,he. ball deep into Club
territory and kept it there, threat- j
ening to score several times. The
Club, however, withstood the attack
ajnd finally worked the ball back up
t lie field.
The visitors were then -given a
penalty kick which Ted Donald,
Club fullback, made good from 30
