# Cardinals Lose Baseball Tilt As Ninth Inning Rally Fails
## 
### 
Betrayed by a nightmarish sixth inning in which the Weltner's Motors
scored two runs without a hit, Stanford's baseball team dropped its first
game of the season, 7-5. on Saturday afternoon. The game was a rematch
of a previous 5-5 tie which the two teams struggled through two weeks ago.
The smooth Weltner's team led by a narrow 5-3 margin going into the
fatal sixth frame, but Stanford had *â€¢

I constantly threatened to tie up the
match. Then the roof fell in, via
j the disintegration of the Indian in
field:
! ERRORS CAUSE LOSS
A base-on balls was an ominous
start to (he inning; and when an at
tempted sacrifice bunt was messed
up by the Cardinal infield, the Welt
: tier's made good use of the scoring
opportunity.
When the smoke had cleared
away, the home team Indians were
hopelessly snowed under a 7-3 defi
cit. Yet, the only time that the ball
traveled out of the infield was on a
long run-scoring sacrifice fly to
right field. Two Card errors by
catcher Frank McGraw and one
bobble by shortstop Ted Nell added
to the confusion of the inning.
STANFORD ADDS A RUN
After the disastrous sixth inning.
Stanford attempted to come back
with a rally of its own and did suc
ceed .in chopping the score to 7-4
in the eighth inning. A 1 Kircher
singled with two down and com
pleted the circuit when Vern John
son. Weltner pitcher, contributed
an erratic streak of two wild
pitches.
THEN IN THE NINTH . . .
Ted Nell laced a screaming dou
ble to deep left field with one out
and the rabid Farm fans started
buzzing with enthusiasm. But a
mile-high pop fly to the third base
man added out number two and
cooled down the uprising.
At this opportune moment, Lloyd
Merriman strode to the plate waving
a menacing bat. Two walks and a
pair of weak infield infield outs had
plagued Lloyd during the game.
This time he lofted a short Texas
Leaguer into left field which the
Weltner shortstop challenged, then
dropped for an error.
Nell crossed the plate for the fifth
Cardinal run. but the next Indian
batter lofted another high pop-up
to the third baseman who caught it
for the final out.
