# Indian Mat Team Wins
## 
### LYNN CARMAN 
A perservering Cardinal mat
squad piled up three pins and a de
i eision to down San Francisco State,
j 23 to 13, for its first victory of the
wrestling season last Friday night
in the men's gym.
Roy Gaskin, Vern Jones and Dave
Garst were the men who accounted
tor 15 of the Cardinals' points as
each pinned his opponent. Jim Kur
fess came out with a decision vic
tory for three points, and a 'Gator
forfeit gave the Farm grapplers
their other five markers.
FINAL MATCH DECISIVE
The meet was nip and tuck all the
way. Going into the final match
the Gators trailed by only five
points and l\ad a chance to tie up
the final score. But Garst took mat
ters into his own hands and pinned
his man to clinch the Cardinal's
first mat victory in five starts.
Gaskin, who has been wrestling
in the 175-lb. division, moved down
a notch to the 165-lb. class last Fri
day and had little trouble in chalk
ing up five points at the lower
weight.
JONES WINS AGAIN
It was Jones' second ring win in
two starts. His victory in :2.47 of
the first round started the Farm
grapplers otf with a lead of five
points which the 'Gators could
never "Overtake during the follow
ing matches.
The high-water point of the Farm
wrestling season was watched by
the smallest crowd of the winter,
partly because the UCLA cage
game drew some fans away and
partly because the 'Gators were well
over an hour late in arriving at the
gym for the match.
