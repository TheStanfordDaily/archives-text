## In Re: Men's Housing 
### 
There are a lot of men in Enema wondering
where they are going to live come next fall.
For those not heading up the Row, there is a
choice between Toyon Hall and the Village.
But "choice" is not a very good word to use
here. No plan, as yet, has been worked out
to determine who goes where. But there are
plenty of problems facing anyone who sets
out to make those plans.
Just how will some placement board deter
mine the distribution of those few rooms that
will be available in Toyon and those many
rooms down in the Village? What about the
Eating Clubs? Should their members have
priority on rooms in Toyon as they did before
the war? If not, isn't that taking away one of
the privileges they used to hold while grant
ing all pre-war advantages to fraternities?
These are questions that are going to be
coming up as moving day draws closer.
Questions that will have to be answered by
any committee that may be appointed to look

into the matter and malce recommendations.
No ovei-all committee has been established
to consider the problems and perhaps the
time is ripe for one. Instead of a last minute
rush near the end of next quarter, we suggest
that a hearing board be established now to
review the arguments that are bound to come
up. Perhaps by starting early, the problem
can be so well aired, investigated and re
viewed that when the final decision is made
there will be little room for criticism.

Nothing would be lost if action was taken
now and we think everyone would be happy
to see a housing program that had the rather
novel attribute of being thought out and de
veloped well in advance.â€”J.C.O.
