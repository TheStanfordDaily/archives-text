# BULL SESSION
## 
### CARL HEINTZE 
The talk by Mr. Charles Bolte, national chairman
of the American Veterans Committee, in the Educa
tion Auditorium the other night brings up an inter
esting question. It isn't what Mr. Bolte said, but
what he is that is interesting. Is there such a thing
as a class called "college veterans"? Can you pick
out a certain group of Americans and say that they
are G.I. Joe College boys?
In the '20's and '30's a lot of attention was paid to
magazine called "College Humor"; plays, movies,
what was called "the college man." There was a
song ("You're an Education in Yourself"), and books
written about college days, and one could get a
stereotype of a sort of dumb jerk in a big raccoon
coat, with a broken-down, cut-down model T, who
chased pretty but skinny girls around.
The picture has changed today. If there is a G.I.
Joe College, he is a much more serious character. On
an average he is from three to five years older than
his co-educatonal colleague, and he has on an aver
age experienced more in the last three or four years
of his life than most men will in ten or twenty.
His bull sessions, which used to rank sex, eco
nomic conditions (Socialism vs. Capitalism), and re
ligion in that order, are now changed to include war
experiences, sex, and economic conditions, with re
ligion bringing up the rear. He always has a story
to match the other guy's one about North Africa,
Germany, or Guadalcanal which is just as funny,
just as bloody, or just as dirty, and he is inclined
now to see most of the serious situations he was in,
in a laughable focus.
As an avei'age, G.I. Joe College is very serious
about his studying, and a goodly number of the things
he had little use for before the war, he wishes he had
studied a little harder. He is a little detached from
campus rah-rah activities, partly because he thinks
lie is getting a little old for that sort of thing, and
partly because it all seems pretty silly to him now.
As an average, G.l. Joe College is married or

thinking seriously of getting married. But he is be
ginning to lose a little of the feeling that he had
when he first got out of the army, that he was far,
far behind everything in civilian life, and that he
would have to rush like mad to catch up.
He is impatient of delays in finishing his educa
tion. nevertheless. He knows that this is just a gap
in the course of his life, just as his life in the service
was. and that his real life is yet to take place, but
he is a little afraid to step out into work right now.
He knows that it is going to be tough.
He wants to be treated in his school like a man,
not a boy, and he is impatient and angry at the pro
lessor or administrator who looks down on him, or
considers him incapable of adult decisions, for he
can still remember that company, platoon, or bat
tery that he commanded, or the situations he was in
which required personal initiative.
G.I. Joe College hates above all to stand in line,
be they movie lines, chow lines, or registration lines,
but he thinks that this is probably a personal ec
centricity so he stands in them anyway, and gets
through.
Finally, G.I. Joe College is very serious about his
country and what may happen to it in the future.
As an average he has been overseas and seen either
Japan, Germany, or at least some devastated section
of the globe, and he decidedly does not want that to
happen to his own home.
That's what Joe College looks like today, 1947
model. Like the Joe College of an earlier day, he
is only a phase in American university history which
will not last forever. Befoi'e long he will be ab
sorbed back into the mass of the American popula
tion. but right now the peculiar circumstances of
history and politics which made possible the GJ.
Bill of Rights have made him a new unit in the
land, which just like all the other classes in the
United States can only be defined so far.
After all. G.I. Joe College is just a lot of people
like everyone else.
