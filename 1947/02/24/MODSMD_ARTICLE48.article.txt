HACK TO THE INDIANS
We have the word from London that the British
will pull out of India next year. Since the statement
was made by the Prime Minister in the House of
Commons, it will be difficult to disavow it. Rumor
has the British civil servants who have administered
India for generations already packing.
My first reaction was, "Get the kids off the streets
Mabel, and Kitty, bar the door!" If some predictions.

including mine, are correct, im
mediately following the with
drawal of British officials and
troops the Indian people will
proceed to give the Spaniards and
the Chinese lessons in civil war.
But I could be. and hope I
am, wrong. This late declaration
by the British may act like a
bucket of cold water and snap
the quarreling factions out of
their political daze. Faced with

reality, with the necessity of devising a workable

government in approximately one year, the Moslem
and Congress leaders may try a little willing com
promise for a change, rather than the "blackmail"
tactics they have been using on each other to date.
To be sure, Britain's motives may not all be moral
and otherworldly. There are mundane considera
tions of weight impelling them to lay down the
White Man's Burden. The Westminster government
owes Indian lenders large sums, some of which, as
far as they have been spent in or for India, will
doubtless be assumed by the independent Indian
government.
The defense of India has been a drain on the
British treasury and on Britain's manpower. As far
as trade advantages go, certainly the "know-how" of
British merchants and manufacturers, their repu
tations. and their commercial contacts will not put
them at a disadvantage. Too, India has been a bur
den in international affairs.
India, I would say, has been clinging like the Old
Man of the Sea to Britain's back for years, and
Britain will be well rid of the load.
