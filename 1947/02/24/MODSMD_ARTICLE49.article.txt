To the Editor:
Now that the Daily informs us who cheerfully ride
a coupla Indians who are going our way that riders
will be sorted out on two landing fields, we are
pleased. We shall be even more pleased if both
traffic strips are placed well below the joint of the Y
that becomes Palm Drive. Some very fancy and
hairs-breadth swerving goes on there when one
stops suddenly on glimpsing a passenger. Will you
alert the local C.A.B. (Cardinals' Automotive Bene
factors) to that hazard?
Also, may we suggest another little custom for
use on the center road, the Stadium road, and such
way-stations as Encina and the bus-stop itself?
(Scooping a pedestrian-customer out of the very
teeth of the bus has long been considered very high
style indeed among us old-time drivers.) It may per
haps become a Tradition itself but it could start just
as a family high-sijjn, an Indian sign if you will.
That passengers who are Villagers hold up a two
finger V sign, and that Towners make a T sign
with, two forefingers. So we can tell if we should
stop?

To the Editor:
In objection to the proposed I.S.C. 'observation"
trips, I wish to agree with Mr. Vittetoe's letter of
Feb. 19. 1947, and say that I appreciate his thorough
consideration of this matter.
I, too, have seen families driven away from swill
buckets, and realize that great problems exist in
many countries—but this wasteful and inadequate
plan will not be part of the solution. To anyone fa
miliar with passive resistance, civilian- and military,
it is obvious that one of these "innocents" would get
nothing from a trip to Spain, one of the proposed des
tinations, and one of the present sites of Fascism.
I know that this program is under way. and will
be carried out regardless of objection, and that Mr.
Vittetoe will be criticized, but here are a few words
in his support.

In objection to the proposed I.S.C. 'observation"
trips, I wish to agree with Mr. Vittetoe's letter of
Feb. 19. 1947, and say that I appreciate his thorough
consideration of this matter.
I, too, have seen families driven away from swill
buckets, and realize that great problems exist in
many countries—but this wasteful and inadequate
plan will not be part of the solution. To anyone fa
miliar with passive resistance, civilian- and military,
it is obvious that one of these "innocents" would get
nothing from a trip to Spain, one of the proposed des
tinations, and one of the present sites of Fascism.
I know that this program is under way. and will
be carried out regardless of objection, and that Mr.
Vittetoe will be criticized, but here are a few words
in his support.

To the Editor:
Now that the Daily informs us who cheerfully ride
a coupla Indians who are going our way that riders
will be sorted out on two landing fields, we are
pleased. We shall be even more pleased if both
traffic strips are placed well below the joint of the Y
that becomes Palm Drive. Some very fancy and
hairs-breadth swerving goes on there when one
stops suddenly on glimpsing a passenger. Will you
alert the local C.A.B. (Cardinals' Automotive Bene
factors) to that hazard?
Also, may we suggest another little custom for
use on the center road, the Stadium road, and such
way-stations as Encina and the bus-stop itself?
(Scooping a pedestrian-customer out of the very
teeth of the bus has long been considered very high
style indeed among us old-time drivers.) It may per
haps become a Tradition itself but it could start just
as a family high-sijjn, an Indian sign if you will.

finger V sign, and that Towners make a T sign

stop?
