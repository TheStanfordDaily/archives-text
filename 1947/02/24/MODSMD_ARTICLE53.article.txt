### 
A re-estimate of the cost of bring
ing the lights in seven rooms in the
library up to standard has been
completed, All' E. Brandin, business
manager, announced.
The Planning and Engineering
Departments are now studying the
problem to see what can be done,
and a study of equipment and mon
ey available for construction will
have to be made before any work
can be started, Mr. Brandin said.
The extent of work that can be done
and the amount of time it will take
has not been determined.
