WASHINGTON. Feb. 24 (UP).—
| Lt. Gen. John R. Hodge, U. S. com
mander in Korea, said today that
j Russia is conscripting Koreans be
| tween the ages of 17 and 25 into an
j army of considerable size behind
j an "iron curtain" which remains
j immovable.
Hodge, recalled here temporarily
to help draft a joint state-war de
partment study of Korean condi
tions, told a press conference after
conferring with President Truman
that ho did not want to try to csti-
J mate the size of the conscript army,
i but that he had received reports
J that there are about 500,000 Koreans
in the 17-25 age group in the Rus
j sian occupation zone.
He saw no reason why there
! should be 500,000 Korean troops in
! the entire country, let alone just in
j the Russian zone, and added there
| was no justification, in his opinion,
I for a conscript army of any size.
The embassy said the message was
received by Mrs. M. B. Kerr of the
j state department's division of cen
j tral services.
| The general said the Koreans
| were "praying" that the Moscow
{ foreign ministers conference would
! take up the Korean situation, and
I that efforts to carry on negotiations
] on a local level with the Russians
I in Korea were "hopeless."
