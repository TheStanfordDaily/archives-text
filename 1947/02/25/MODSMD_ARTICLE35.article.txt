# Quad Needs Bed, Brunette, Cadillac

### JEAN BURNET 
A luxurious bed, a small colored boy, a long black limousine,
r: huge woolly dog, and a girl with long dark hair are just a few
:;tndll items needed by the editor of the living group section of
Ihe Stanford Quad.
"There must be a house somewhere on this peninsula with

one of those tremendous beds that
vou see in the movies," complains
Jerry Stavig, editor in charge of the
living groups section.
IJNE-IJP PANNED OUT
A. a matter of fact, Stavig had
lined up a bed, a silver breakfast
li.iv, and even a coed to pose, but
Ihe home just happened to belong
(-i a young lady currently involved
iii a much-publicized San Francisco
divorce suit. Just as the Quad pho
tographer readied his camera, a po
lic< squadron arrived, sirens wail
ing. and threw a cordon around the
palatial home cutting off communi
t at ion.
"We withdrew hastily," explains
Siavig, "feeling that the atmosphere
was not just what if should be for a
picture to be used as a section
licet of the Stanford yearbook.
l 'i uin the way things were going, we
were lucky lo get out at all."

For another page, a long, long
black limousine, preferably a Cad

We have been offered a lieuten

AND A CIKL
Now that girl with the long dark
hair. This girl has to look as though
In wakes up every morning about
II in a feather bed surrounded by
• ilin pillows and is served break
last on a silver tray. This admitted
ly is a challenging posing assign
ment for any girl who wakes up in
a top bunk on a drafty sleeping
porch.
"I hope dark-haired lassies won't
be too shocked if a Quad photog
rapher approaches them on Quad
and tells them they'd look good in
a double bed. It's all in the line of
duly," Stavig explains.
There's a deadline on these pic
tures," he moaned, "and we need
these properties as soon as we can
locate them. Not everyone has long
dark hair, not everyone has a long
black limousine, and we realize that
not quite everyone was an admiral
in Ihe war, but surely someone
knows of SOMEONE who can help
us out."
