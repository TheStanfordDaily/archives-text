# OSS Film "Really Fine'
## 
### DON PAGE 
Every so often Hollywood makes
a horrible mistake. Somebody blun
ders and turns out a really line,
worthwhile picture that undermines
the reputation Hollywood has built
up for itself through years of dili
gent indolence and bad taste.
The biggest llu/. in the past low
months is a masterpiece called "13
Rue Madeleine," now at the Stan
ford. It's really good.
But "lo Rue Madeleine" remains
as a discouraging reminder of how
good the movies can be when they
get careless. Hollywood's third film
about (he Oflice of Strategic Serv
ices, it is by far the finest. It is as
good as, if not better than. "The
House on 92nd Street," which was
produced by the same crack team:
Producer Louis de Rochemont, Di
rector Henry Hathaway, and Writer
John Monks, Jr.
You will follow a group of OSS
agents through their extensive
training and "final exam missions,"
their briefings, preparations, and
into their actual assignments.
The utter realism is largely due
to De Rochemont's new theory that
everything — rooms, street scenes,
shipyards, railroads, buildings —
should be shot on the actual spot
rather than on sound sets. This idea
is no doubt an offspring of his years
of experience with documentary
films and newsreels as director of
"The March of Time." All the
background and sets for the picture
were either shot in Canada and New
England or lifted from newsreels.
James Cagney and Annabel la as
the stars turn in performances that
ring true and are unpolluted by
phony sentimenlalism or Hollywood
romance.
The sum total is a picture of cal
culated realism and extraordinary
impact. If you're one of those movie
fans who "never go near the things,"
take a little side trip this time.
You'll be ashamed that you ever
worried about anything as superfi
cial as everyday modern life.
