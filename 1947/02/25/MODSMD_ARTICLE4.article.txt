### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 24 (UP)!â€”Republicans late today slapped a limit
on Senate debate in an effort to force a showdown Wednesday on a House
approved plan to cut President Truman's 1048 fiscal budget by $6,000,000,-
000. after shouting down two Democratic moves to delay a vote until April.
The debate restriction, demanded by GOP Floor Leader Wallace H.
White of Maine, was agreed to without complaint after three days of pro
and-con arguments. Under it, Senators may speak no longer than 20
minutes on the plan itself, and 20 minutes on each amendment, beginning
Wednesday.
