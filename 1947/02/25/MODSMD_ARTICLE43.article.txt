# Toyon Votes Poll On I.S.C. Criticism
## 
### 
Determined to bring criticism,
both pro and con, of the Interna
tional Student Committee to a defin
ite form, Toyon Council last night
voted to conduct a poll of Toyon
residents on that committee next
week.
The Council appropriated money
to mimeograph a 12 question survey
on ISC, which will be distributed
among the 297 men living at Toyon.
Questions will cover such points
as whether the project should be
dropped entirely or be submitted to
further study, whether the expense
of sending representatives abroad
is justified, and whether exchange
scholarships and talks by veterans
would serve the same purpose.
The results of the questionnaire
will be presented to Excom by
Frank Creede, Toyon representa
tive, as soon as they are tabulated.
