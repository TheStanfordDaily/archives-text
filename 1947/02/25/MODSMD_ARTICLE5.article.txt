LONDON, Feb. 24 (UP). â€”Prime Minister Clement Attlce today cheered
Britain, shivering in the coldest weather in 106 years, with announcement
that power would be restored to northwest industries next Monday and
that predicted gas cuts had been temporarily postponed.
Midlands industries employing 18,000 workers reopened on schedule
today when power was restored at midnight but Attlce, in his Commons
announcement, refused to say when full electric service would be restored
in London or the southeast area.
