# Orphaned’ Stanford Crew Presents Its Side of Case
## Oarsmen Say $1,500 Will Do 
### BEN CALLAWAY 
Stanford's orphaned varsity crew
has been asking since last autumn
tor a chance to compete with other
ciews throughout the nation. Be
cause of a lack of funds in the
S.A.C., Graduate Manager A! Mas
ters has stated that Stanford would
he unable to compete with Califor
nia and Washington on an even
level, it seems fair that sports
minded Daily readers should hear
the crew's side of this story.
The budget requested by the crew
culls for a much smaller sum than
that used to operate Cal's rowing
organization—and lightly so.
In a recent city news article, Mr.
Masters was quoted as saying he
called Clint Evans at Cal, who said
his school pays about $35,000 a year
lor coaches' salaries, maintenance,
new equipment, "and so on."
injim ii:t bheakdown
The coaching item consumes near
ly hall of the budget total, and
under the miscellaneous caption of
"and so on" must be included the
maintenance of two boat houses,
one at Oakland and the other in
Poughkeepsie, in addition to the up
keep ol a 70-passenger bus.
California possesses a two-story
boat house on the Oakland estuary,
equipped with living accommoda
tions for a full-time caretaker and
with an extremely modern drying
room.
(jl AIMERS IN EAST
In addition to its home boathouse.
the University maintains a palatial
edifice in Poughkeepsie, with living
quarters for three crews and dining
facilities for crew members and
guests. Used only once a year, such
a boathouse would not be necessary
for the Stanford crew. Stanford's
present structure, modest as it may
be, is adequate. It can house seven
shells and sufficient oars.
Cal's budget calls for transporta
tion as a major item of expense.
Their crew has a bus, accommodat
ing 70 passengers, and operated four
hours per day by a paid driver. In
the East Bay set-up this is neces
sary. as the route between the Ber
keley campus and the Oaklad estu
ary follows half an hour's driving
through heavy traffic. No bus is
needed at Stanford. The trip from

the Farm to the Paly harbor is only
a matter of five minutes, and is eas
ily handled by the use of crew
members' private cars.
WELL-PAID COACHES
The Berkeley crew maintains a
staff of well - paid coaches, which
constitute nearly half of their total
expense. Stanford's crew in the
past has operated successfully with
out the benefit of a full-time coach.
This problem could be met by a
staff composed of alumni, graduate
students, and possibly a physical
education instructor.
One of the more intangible ad
vantages of having a crew repre
senting Stanford would be the pub
licity value derived. The great
Stanford crew of 1915, which fin
ished second in the national cham
pionships at Poughkeepsie, was the
first Pacific Coast shell to gain rec
ognition as a serious contender for
national honors by the highly pro
vincial Easterners.
"The crew is only asking that the
University defray half of its trav
eling expenses. The remaining half
will come from the oarsmen them-

I selves, if necessary," according to
) Coach Lou Lindsay.
In a budget planned by the crew
j and recommended by Excom to the
S.A.C., an annual sum of $1,500 was
' asked of the University. This
: amount was ridiculed by crew op
-1 position as insufficient. The opposed
| based their statement on that sum
I being the total amount of operation
! al expenses.
OPPOSITION MISSES FACTS
When quoting this budget, the
! opposition overlooks the fact that
this is only part of a complete total
i of $5,500. Of this total, the crew is
j asking $1,500 from the administra
j tion, and the balance will be met by
j dues, donations, and income-pro
j ducing functions such as dances.
Donations are not mere pipe
| dreams, either. Two of the Indians'
shells were donated by Cal, one by
i Washington, and another by U.S.F.
j A recent anonymous donation will
i make possible the acquisition of two
new shells. Through dealings with
the Navy, the crew will receive two
motor launches from Mare Island as
soon as they are declared surplus.

I In hist week's mail, the coach re
| ceived a $250 check from the Uni
; versity of California crew alumni
[ group to aid in meeting expenses.
C.OOD HOME PORT'
Contrary to mistaken information
j which has been circulating recently,
Stanford's "home port" is a good
one. Coach Lou Lindsay says it is
as good as Lake Washington, and
that a four - mile straightaway is
possible. There is no problem of
j tide and mud, as there have been
I only two bad rowing days all quar
[ ter. Despite statements to the con
) trary, there is no need for the ex
i pensive undertaking of dredging the
j slough.
Also contrary to recent articles,
crew is recognized by the Univer
sity. Minor sport awards are given
| to members. A more accurate state
| ment would have been that crew at
I Stanford is recognized, but not fi
; nanccd by the University.
The crew believes $1,500 from the
| S.A.C., when combined with dues
i and donations, would provide the
j necessaries.


LEARNING BY DOING—Here are some of Stanford's "greener" crewmen learning the
tricks of the trade in the work scow. Because most of the oar candidates have little experi

first Pacific Coast shell to gain rec

"The crew is only asking that the
University defray half of its trav

will come from the oarsmen them-

I selves, if necessary," according to

In a budget planned by the crew
j and recommended by Excom to the
S.A.C., an annual sum of $1,500 was

OPPOSITION MISSES FACTS
When quoting this budget, the

this is only part of a complete total

j asking $1,500 from the administra
j tion, and the balance will be met by

Donations are not mere pipe

C.OOD HOME PORT'
Contrary to mistaken information
j which has been circulating recently,
Stanford's "home port" is a good
one. Coach Lou Lindsay says it is
as good as Lake Washington, and
that a four - mile straightaway is
possible. There is no problem of
j tide and mud, as there have been
I only two bad rowing days all quar
[ ter. Despite statements to the con
) trary, there is no need for the ex
i pensive undertaking of dredging the
j slough.
Also contrary to recent articles,
crew is recognized by the Univer
sity. Minor sport awards are given
| to members. A more accurate state

I Stanford is recognized, but not fi

The crew believes $1,500 from the
| S.A.C., when combined with dues
i and donations, would provide the
j necessaries.


LEARNING BY DOING—Here are some of Stanford's "greener" crewmen learning the
tricks of the trade in the work scow. Because most of the oar candidates have little experi

Stanford's orphaned varsity crew
has been asking since last autumn
tor a chance to compete with other
ciews throughout the nation. Be
cause of a lack of funds in the
S.A.C., Graduate Manager A! Mas

nia and Washington on an even
level, it seems fair that sports
minded Daily readers should hear
the crew's side of this story.
The budget requested by the crew
culls for a much smaller sum than
that used to operate Cal's rowing
organization—and lightly so.
In a recent city news article, Mr.
Masters was quoted as saying he
called Clint Evans at Cal, who said
his school pays about $35,000 a year

new equipment, "and so on."

maintenance of two boat houses,
one at Oakland and the other in
Poughkeepsie, in addition to the up
keep ol a 70-passenger bus.
California possesses a two-story
boat house on the Oakland estuary,
equipped with living accommoda

with an extremely modern drying
room.

In addition to its home boathouse.
the University maintains a palatial
edifice in Poughkeepsie, with living
quarters for three crews and dining
facilities for crew members and
guests. Used only once a year, such
a boathouse would not be necessary
for the Stanford crew. Stanford's
present structure, modest as it may
be, is adequate. It can house seven
shells and sufficient oars.
Cal's budget calls for transporta
tion as a major item of expense.
Their crew has a bus, accommodat
ing 70 passengers, and operated four
hours per day by a paid driver. In
the East Bay set-up this is neces
sary. as the route between the Ber
keley campus and the Oaklad estu

through heavy traffic. No bus is

the Farm to the Paly harbor is only
a matter of five minutes, and is eas

The budget requested by the crew
culls for a much smaller sum than
that used to operate Cal's rowing
organization—and lightly so.
In a recent city news article, Mr.
Masters was quoted as saying he
called Clint Evans at Cal, who said
his school pays about $35,000 a year
lor coaches' salaries, maintenance,
new equipment, "and so on."
injim ii:t bheakdown
The coaching item consumes near
ly hall of the budget total, and
under the miscellaneous caption of
"and so on" must be included the
maintenance of two boat houses,
one at Oakland and the other in
Poughkeepsie, in addition to the up
keep ol a 70-passenger bus.
California possesses a two-story
boat house on the Oakland estuary,
equipped with living accommoda
tions for a full-time caretaker and
with an extremely modern drying
room.
(jl AIMERS IN EAST
In addition to its home boathouse.
the University maintains a palatial
edifice in Poughkeepsie, with living
quarters for three crews and dining
facilities for crew members and
guests. Used only once a year, such
a boathouse would not be necessary
for the Stanford crew. Stanford's
present structure, modest as it may
be, is adequate. It can house seven
shells and sufficient oars.
Cal's budget calls for transporta
tion as a major item of expense.
Their crew has a bus, accommodat
ing 70 passengers, and operated four
hours per day by a paid driver. In
the East Bay set-up this is neces
sary. as the route between the Ber
keley campus and the Oaklad estu
ary follows half an hour's driving
through heavy traffic. No bus is
needed at Stanford. The trip from

the Farm to the Paly harbor is only
a matter of five minutes, and is eas
ily handled by the use of crew
members' private cars.
WELL-PAID COACHES
The Berkeley crew maintains a
staff of well - paid coaches, which
constitute nearly half of their total
expense. Stanford's crew in the
past has operated successfully with
out the benefit of a full-time coach.
This problem could be met by a
staff composed of alumni, graduate
students, and possibly a physical
education instructor.
One of the more intangible ad
vantages of having a crew repre
senting Stanford would be the pub
licity value derived. The great
Stanford crew of 1915, which fin
ished second in the national cham
pionships at Poughkeepsie, was the
first Pacific Coast shell to gain rec
ognition as a serious contender for
national honors by the highly pro
vincial Easterners.
"The crew is only asking that the
University defray half of its trav
eling expenses. The remaining half
will come from the oarsmen them-

I selves, if necessary," according to
) Coach Lou Lindsay.
In a budget planned by the crew
j and recommended by Excom to the
S.A.C., an annual sum of $1,500 was
' asked of the University. This
: amount was ridiculed by crew op
-1 position as insufficient. The opposed
| based their statement on that sum
I being the total amount of operation
! al expenses.
OPPOSITION MISSES FACTS
When quoting this budget, the
! opposition overlooks the fact that
this is only part of a complete total
i of $5,500. Of this total, the crew is
j asking $1,500 from the administra
j tion, and the balance will be met by
j dues, donations, and income-pro
j ducing functions such as dances.
Donations are not mere pipe
| dreams, either. Two of the Indians'
shells were donated by Cal, one by
i Washington, and another by U.S.F.
j A recent anonymous donation will
i make possible the acquisition of two
new shells. Through dealings with
the Navy, the crew will receive two
motor launches from Mare Island as
soon as they are declared surplus.

I In hist week's mail, the coach re
| ceived a $250 check from the Uni
; versity of California crew alumni
[ group to aid in meeting expenses.
C.OOD HOME PORT'
Contrary to mistaken information
j which has been circulating recently,
Stanford's "home port" is a good
one. Coach Lou Lindsay says it is
as good as Lake Washington, and
that a four - mile straightaway is
possible. There is no problem of
j tide and mud, as there have been
I only two bad rowing days all quar
[ ter. Despite statements to the con
) trary, there is no need for the ex
i pensive undertaking of dredging the
j slough.
Also contrary to recent articles,
crew is recognized by the Univer
sity. Minor sport awards are given
| to members. A more accurate state
| ment would have been that crew at
I Stanford is recognized, but not fi
; nanccd by the University.
The crew believes $1,500 from the
| S.A.C., when combined with dues
i and donations, would provide the
j necessaries.
