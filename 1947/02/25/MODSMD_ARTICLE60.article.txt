# Mural Playoff Opens Tonight
## 
### 
First collision of league chain- '
j pions in the waning Intramural Bas- 1
ketball Tournament will be pre- '
! sen ted at the Pavilion tonight when I
I the undefeated Theta Delts meet the '
j equally win-happy D.U. No. 2 squad.
Tip-oft for the battle is slated for S
I p.m.
Both teams have yet to draw a
i deep breath in league competition,!
j as witness their 5-0 records, but to- 1
! night's sudden-death light must chop j
j one of the teams from the play- ;
| offs. From now on. any loss spells i
| elimination from the grand cham- |
j pionship which will be decided next
I week.
The D.U. No. 2 squad roared
through League VIII, amassing a
prodigious total of 174 points while ;
holding their opponents to a paltry
58. In each contest the D.U.'s seemed
to run away with the victory more
1 easily. Their darkest moments came
j early in the season when Encina 2E |
j threatened to upset them before
| succumbing, 19-12.
D.U. No. 2 RAMPAGE
High - water mark in the D.U. |
rampage was the (51-8 whitewashing
I administered to Alpha Sigma Phi i
I last week. The league championship !
followed on the next night as A.K.L. j
fell before the rapid-fire D.U. of- i
| fensive, 24-9.
Meanwhile, the Theta Delts took
League IV honors in a murderous j
stretch drive which chalked up 145
points against 70 by their victims.
For a while in league play, the La- i
gunita Hashers and the Alpha Delts 1
kept pace with the smooth cham- ;
1 pions, waiting for them to stumble.
DELTS' STRETCH DRIVE
But the Theta Delts easily dis- j
| posed of the Hashers by a 30-16 i
] count last week and tucked the
i league crown away with an excit- j
. ing 28-21 win over the stubborn j
j Alpha Delts.
Play-off matches will continue to- j
i morrow evening with a full sched
ule of four games slated. After the
elimination games pare the campus
championship to a single team, that
team will meet the winner of the
Village leagues for the grand cham
| pionship.
