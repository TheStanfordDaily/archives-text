# Injuns Embarrass Expert Drub UCLA Wonder Team

### ART SHAPIRO 
"The Bruins will have a pretty soft touch against Stanford," so
said the column of a certain Angeleno, Jack Geyer by name,
way back in early January. Mister Geyer and the Los Angeles
Times ought to check up for flaws in their crystal ball.
The Indians refused to acguiesce to the prognosticators and
managed to check the title-bound Bruins, splitting the four game
home-and-home series with the Westwood Wonders. The two
defeats represent 40 per cent of the Uclans' losses, and make the
Cards the number one bee in the UCLA bonnet. A double vic
tory for the Indians over the Bears of Cal would provoke the

Bruins no end, especially if it were j
combined with a Trojan uprising
against UCLA. That would tic up
the conference race and force a i
Stanlord-UCLA playoff for the j
championship of the PCC southern |
division.
FACTS AND FIGURES
A study of the facts and figures '
of the weekend's clashes with UCLA
reveal that Stanford was in a posi
tion to walk away with both decis
ions had their shot average even
remotely approached that of the
Uclans during the first game. The
Cards had 80 attempts at the net
ting Friday while the Bruins had to 1
be content with 58 field goal tries. i
The Indians completed 18.5 per
cent of their chances for a total of
15 field goals while UCLA amassed
21 out of the 58 attempts for an av- :
erage of 36.5 per cent. Had the
Cardinals been able to hit a modest
25 per cent of their shots the entire
complexion of the game would have
been changed and the local boys !
would have been in position to cop j
the first half of the series as well as
the second.
FIRST HALF DUPLICATE
The Saturday evening affair start
ed out as a duplicate of the one Fri
day. Stanford was behind at the i
end of the half, had had more
chances at the netting, and were
trailing in percentage of completed ;
attempts.
In the final period the deliberate
slowing down of the game by the
Stanford varsity began to pay off.
The Cards ran up 46.6 per cent of
their tries while the Bruins were
floundering around with a paltry |
16.4 per cent. The total average for
the Saturday fracas saw the Indians '
net 34.8 per cent of their shots while j
the Uclans could only total 23 per !
cent.
Coach Everett Dean, when ques- j
tinned about the Saturday game |
said, "The boys came through with
another Santa Clara game. They
planned their play and played their !
plan."
In the individual shooting depart- i
ment Saturday evening, Babe Hig
gins led the field with 5 out of 9 |
attempts for 55 per cent. Morley |
Thompson, who scored 18 counters |
in the second half, hit the netting 7
times out of 15 for 46.6 per cent.
Stephenson with 36.3 per cent was
third, followed by John Stanich of
the Bruins who swished through 5
of his 14 attempts.

against UCLA. That would tic up
the conference race and force a i
Stanlord-UCLA playoff for the j
championship of the PCC southern |
division.
FACTS AND FIGURES
A study of the facts and figures '
of the weekend's clashes with UCLA
reveal that Stanford was in a posi
tion to walk away with both decis
ions had their shot average even
remotely approached that of the
Uclans during the first game. The
Cards had 80 attempts at the net
ting Friday while the Bruins had to 1
be content with 58 field goal tries. i
The Indians completed 18.5 per
cent of their chances for a total of
15 field goals while UCLA amassed
21 out of the 58 attempts for an av- :
erage of 36.5 per cent. Had the
Cardinals been able to hit a modest
25 per cent of their shots the entire
complexion of the game would have
been changed and the local boys !
would have been in position to cop j
the first half of the series as well as
the second.
FIRST HALF DUPLICATE
The Saturday evening affair start
ed out as a duplicate of the one Fri
day. Stanford was behind at the i
end of the half, had had more
chances at the netting, and were
trailing in percentage of completed ;
attempts.
In the final period the deliberate
slowing down of the game by the
Stanford varsity began to pay off.
The Cards ran up 46.6 per cent of
their tries while the Bruins were
floundering around with a paltry |
16.4 per cent. The total average for
the Saturday fracas saw the Indians '
net 34.8 per cent of their shots while j
the Uclans could only total 23 per !
cent.
Coach Everett Dean, when ques- j
tinned about the Saturday game |
said, "The boys came through with
another Santa Clara game. They
planned their play and played their !
plan."
In the individual shooting depart- i
ment Saturday evening, Babe Hig
gins led the field with 5 out of 9 |
attempts for 55 per cent. Morley |
Thompson, who scored 18 counters |
in the second half, hit the netting 7
times out of 15 for 46.6 per cent.
Stephenson with 36.3 per cent was
third, followed by John Stanich of
the Bruins who swished through 5
of his 14 attempts.
"The Bruins will have a pretty soft touch against Stanford," so
said the column of a certain Angeleno, Jack Geyer by name,
way back in early January. Mister Geyer and the Los Angeles
Times ought to check up for flaws in their crystal ball.
The Indians refused to acguiesce to the prognosticators and
managed to check the title-bound Bruins, splitting the four game
home-and-home series with the Westwood Wonders. The two
defeats represent 40 per cent of the Uclans' losses, and make the
Cards the number one bee in the UCLA bonnet. A double vic
tory for the Indians over the Bears of Cal would provoke the

Bruins no end, especially if it were j
combined with a Trojan uprising
against UCLA. That would tic up
the conference race and force a i
Stanlord-UCLA playoff for the j
championship of the PCC southern |
division.
