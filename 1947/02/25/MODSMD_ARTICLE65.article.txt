### CARL HEINTZE 
Why don't they:
Stop using jokes which have some reference to
"Open the door, Richard"? It was a good gag once,
hut it has been worked from every angle there is,
including Henry Morgan's operatic rendition in Ital
ian.
Stop working over Laraine Day and Leo Duro
cher, as well as Artie Shaw and Kathleen Windsor?
Like "Richard," it isn't funny any more, and is past
the bounds of taste.
Take Phil Harris and Alice Fay off the air? It
just overworks Jack Benny's gag writers after all.
Liquidate- Vera Vague from the Bob Hope show?
If she hasn't gotten a man by this time, she never
will, and no one cares if she doesn't.
Drop the adhiission price on the downtown movie
houses? When they force you to sit through some
thing like "Dangerous Business," which probably will
yet the Academy Award for the worst picture of
1947, they ought to pay you.
But, then, why don't they eliminate the double
bill from all theaters? Next they'll play "Henry V"
with Hopalong Cassidy.
End all singing commercials by an Act of Con
gress, and let us hear the music in peace?
Have Ma Perkins run over by a train, fried in the
electric chair, or stabbed by her faithful servant,
Shuffle? No woman could possibly live that long,
and do all the things she's done, and still be alive.
Let the Union serve beer of a weaker variety?
It's been done in the East, and it would probably
prevent a lot of Stanford traffic deaths, people run
ning up and down the road, and so on.

Have spring all year 'round so that the girls can
wear spring dresses? They do look better in spring.
Put in tables and a floor show at the top of the
Hoover Libe? They could buy books with the pro
ceeds and cover charge. (That isn't a new idea;
there's even a song about it in one of the old Gaie
ties.)
Give Branner back to those whom the B.A.C. in
tended it for, namely the men? The funds which
built it came from football games, and it was in
tended for a men's hall.
Take the old socks out of the Encina cofl'ee urns?
It would taste so much better.
Build a Pavilion that would hold more than a
thimbleful of people? Someday those who wanted to
Ret inside and Couldn't are going to take it apart,
brick by brick.
Wise up the Vets' Administration or somebody
to all the money book publishers are making of! the
G.I. Bill of Rights? They aren't publishing anything
but 500-page books now which run into five and six
dollars apiece and which, while they are nice to own,
aren't necessary.
Give the I.S.C. money to CARE, the organiza
tion which sends food to Europe? As LaGuardia
said. "Ticker tape ain't spaghetti."
Make every quarter spring quarter, and let people
take a maximum of five units? It would take longer
to go through school that way, and would make life
so much easier and pleasant.
Borrow some water from Hetch-Hetchy or some
where to fill up the Lake? It's feeling mighty low.
Finally, why don't they eliminate all classes but
the ten o'clock, so a guy could get some sleep?
