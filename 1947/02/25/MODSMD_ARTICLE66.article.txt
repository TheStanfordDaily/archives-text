# HISTORY 1947

### CECIL ROSPAW 
Many of our campus veterans have come forth
lately in letter, or verbally, to attack the I.S.C. and
other international activities, standing on tbe grounds
that we have a campus group which has "had" it,
and why look further for leadership.
This is February, 1947. The A-bomb fell in Au
gust, 1945. In the language of Time magazine this
is now the 2nd year, A.A. (Atomic Age).
So the veterans as a group have this wealth of
experience. So they "know"the why's and where
fores of the world. So they fought and died for ideas
and ideals, etc.?
Can Mr. Vittetoe, or any other veteran, or group
of veterans show three positive steps that Stanford
veterans have taken to put these "ideas" and "ideals"
in action and preserve the peace that they won?
There was a Four Feathers Drive on campus last
quarter. It was for the express purpose of raising
money to aid in relief overseas.
When the Four Feathers Drive was on did any
one named Vittetoe. or the Norwegian, or the Dutch
girl, or the Indian, offer his or her services to give
a speech, organize a rally, or help to prove to the
complacent citizens of Stanford that these countries
did need aid?
The Four Feathers Drive flopped, not for lack of
straight publicity, or not even from normal Stanford
standards, but flopped as far as 'potential was con
cerned.
The AVC (Stanford chapter) is chugging along
with approximately 10 members now carrying the
load for the 100 who have indicated that they like
that type of veterans' outfit. There are many campus
critics of AVC, but not one group has attempted to
organize Amvets (another World War II outfit) or
a unit of the VFW or the American Legion. Is that
action? Is that sharing the benefits of this wide
experience?
Plow many veterans have actively participated in
the new discussion groups, or have even offered sug
gestions? The offices are open, the people running
them arc known, and as time permits, they are open
and susceptible to opinion.
It seems that the veterans, as a Stanford group,
have sat around on their complacent backs (at 20,000
feet) waiting for someone to ask them for a con
tribution from their vast store of knowledge and
"experience."
Very little in this world is accomplished by wait
ing. or being secure in a personal world of rightness.
Niel Allen is a veteran. He and a few others had
an idea. He worked on it, and last November it was

presented to Excom. Were there any objections from
veterans or students then?
Three months have gone by, and Allen has in
corporated the idea into a working, living fact, com
posed of a cross-section of Stanford students. (See
Thursday's Daily for a complete list of names.)
His plan was not presented as a cure-all, or a
preventative, palliative, or the end of the line. In
essence it has been more than successful because of
the interest the initial step has created. Witness
N. 5.0.. 1.D.G., the Bolte speech, ad infinitum.
Why must this group be subjected to sniping and
griping, rather than constructive action, from many
of the very people it is essentially representing?
Why can't I.S.C. be accepted as the first small, but
positive, step along the road of greater participation
outside the "Ivory Tower"?
T. E. Lawrence had this to say after the last war:
"Yet when we had achieved, and the new world
dawned, the old men came out again and took from
us our victory and remade it in the likeness of the
former world they knew. Youth could win, but had
not learned to keep, and was pitiably weak against
age." It is apparent that youth is again losirjg the
peace after this war. And a compromise will not be
made unless there is a strong second side to forcc
that compromise.
We offer this solution to the dissatisfied veterans,
and students, of the campus: (1) Start now by offer
ing positive steps for action to the appropriate com
mittees, (2) get in touch with Beth Mac Vicar, who
is trying to work out an over-all organizational plan,
wants co-operation, and has asked for it, (3) or
ganize a group of your own if none now in existence
suits your particular tastes, or (4) if none of these
alternatives suits you (not enough time, too busy,
same old excuses), admit, passively, or actively by
support, that the trips as a section of an over-all
plan for Stanford participation in "One World" is
at least the first step in the right direction.
Mistakes have been, are being, and probably will
be made. But how else can people learn, except by
doing? To kill the plan now would be to deprive
the campus of the experience of doing and to put us
right back where we were when we started.
We. as Stanford veterans, have already missed
the boat as far as concerted veteran action is con
cerned. Maybe, with the help of a few of the "kids"
in a co-operative student body, Stanford veterans
may be pushed along to do the job that they should
have taken the lead in doing six months ago.
