# Wartime College Life Described By Chinese University Student
## 
### MARY KRAFT 
â€¢ What was it like to be a college
student during the long war in
China? This is the question that
Fo-Van Chang, a graduate student
in engineering, answers in his doc
ument, "I Tell My Experience."
Mr. Chang graduated from senior
middle school in July, 1937, when
Japan was starting the invasion of
China. He went to Shanghai in
August to take his university en
trance examination. After he had
been there a week, the Japanese
came so close that in the suburbs
the roaring of the artillery could be
heard.
MOVES TO HANGCHOW
From Shanghai Mr. Chang went
to Hangchow where the National
Chekiang University was located.
Unfortunately for the university,
the school for training aviators for
the Chinese Air Force was also lo
cated there.
Scarcely a day passed without
alarms, but the school was opened
in September anyway. A dugout
was made, and when an alarm
sounded the classes would merely
retire to it and the instructor would
continue his lecture.
Mr. Chang says that, being fresh
men, he and his friends took a little
more interest in the bombs than
the authorities thought was wise, so
they decided to move the 400 fresh
men and their teachers.
TEMPLE BECOMES SCHOOL
The place they were sent was a
large temple amid desolate hills in
the western province about 100
miles from Hangchow. Called Timo
Temple, it was one of those old and
rather obscure temples frequently
found in China.
Around the temple there were a
number of gigantic trees which
camouflaged the new school very
well. Aside from 100 monks who
shared the temple with the students,
there were few inhabitants near by.
ENVIRONMENT IS I'OOR
Conditions were very wretched:
bamboo was used for water pipes,
nuts provided most of the food,
classrooms in the temple were
scarcely adequate, and news from
the outside world came only once a
week.
The life there was very peaceful,
however, and the silence was very
conducive to study. The losing of

the battle in Shanghai ended the
stay in the temple, however. In De
cember, they decided to join the
rest of the school which had moved
to Keitech about GO miles from the
temple.
STUDENTS ALWAYS MOVING
Scarcely had they reached Kei
tech, when Hangchow fell. Much
worse, the attack was now directed
toward them. At the end of Decem
ber the school moved again, this
time in sampans to a small town,
Tawo, in the Kiangsi province.
While the students were recuperat
ing from the month-long journey,
carpenters made desks and beds in
vacant mansions which were to be
the new school.
When July came, the Japanese
troops had started their summer of
fensive along the Yangtze River.
Once again the school was forced to
move, but this time the move was
comparatively well planned and the
trip pleasant.
The place where they now went
was Yisha in Kwangsi, a province
which is still partly inhabited by
savage tribes.
In Yisha thatched houses were
erected for the students. Although
the crackling of machine guns and
the thundering of artillery was not
too far away to be heard, another
struggle was at hand.
WAR COMES TO SCHOOL
The conditions were so entirely
different from what the students had
been accustomed to, that they lost
weight and became feeble. Twelve
died of malaria.
The dormitory caught fire later
from the bombings, and although
many of the students were almost
buried in the earth dug up by the
bomb holps. no one was hurt. How
ever, all the books, clothes, and
bedding were lost.
A classroom was changed into a
dormitory, and straw was laid on

the floor for beds. Everything went
fine until the summer rains came.
The dormitory was of such poor
construction that the students awa
kened one morning to find them
selves sleeping in four inches of
water.
In October, 1939, the school moved
once again, this time to Tsuki in
Kweichow province, two days' jour
ney from Chungking.
IN FI All O N IN CIIEA SES
Life at Tsuki was a struggle
against poverty; as the war went on
inflation became more and more se- i
rious. However, the hopeless pov- |
erty of the students and faculty had
no effect on their learning. It was
at Tsuyi in 1944 that Dr. Joseph
Needham, director of the English j
Scientific Council in China, visited j
the school.
Dr. Needham later broadcast from
London that "the remarkable thing i
is that in most cases the academic |
standards have remained high, and !
in some cases, as the National South-
West University and Chekiang Uni
versity, the standard is the equal of j
such centers of learning as Cam- !
bridge, Oxford, Stanford, or Yale, j
although actual achievement has j
been severely limited by lack of
equipment."
TEACHERS SUCCUMB
Mr. Chang ends his document by
telling how their beloved teachers,
bowed down by the heaviness of
life, poor nutrition, and profound
sorrow for the country, "loosened
their grasp on life."
"Through tin; soft, melancholy
evening twilight, from the distant
school tower, are coming the '
chimes, one succeeding another; fi
nally all vanished into the infinite
nothingness. Would that these be
loved souls have a calm repose in
the other world."
