# ISC WILL PRESENT PROGRAM TONIGHT
## Organization's Plan Outlined in Detail 
### 
The International Survey Committee will present the fol
lowing to Excom tonight to clarify the present confusion con
cerning its concrete aims and purposes and how it plans to
carry out the purposes, according to Beth Mac Vicar, chairman
of the co-ordinating committee on international groups.
The report was releasor) last night by Nada Skidinore of I.S.C.
Why is I.S.C. of value? Out of the haze of confusion and criticism,
many Stanford students have not been able to get a clear picture of the
purposes for sending several persons abroad in the summer.
They have not boon able to see why I.S.C. is a necessary part of our
hopeful programs for furthering international understanding, why it ha
specialized functions and aims that can only be carried out through such,
trips.
Most of the trouble derives from the fact that the present I.S.C!. pro
gram had to evolve slowly from its original broad and "vague" outlines.
Since those outlines have boon filled in and changed almost every day
by the added ideas of a groat many students and professors, a complete
plan has never been adequately presented to the student body. But .<
tentative program, which should be read by every interested person at
Stanford, is printed below. It is, of course, subject to revision, for thi;«
type of project will always need new brainstorms and actual work if it
is to succeed.
(iENERAL AIM: To furtl ier international understanding and good will.
SPECIFIC PURPOSES:
I. To give evidence of America's interest; to rofute the beliof that
America will return in the postwar to isolationism, through sending poi -
sonal representatives actively interested in the problems of other nation ,
The I.S.C.'s contribution supplements relief sent from Stanford.
(Statements from other foreign students and friends disagree with Mr.
Vittetoe's belief that Europeans wouldn't want to see our interest mani
fested in this way.)
Our representative* ran work on behalf of this purpose, hy:
a) Informal talks with foreign people.
b) Speeches made before groups.
c) Attendance at important student conferences if possible.
11. To promote interest in international affairs at Stanford; to encour
age interest in and a desire to visit other nations; to broaden tho stu
dents' viewpoint.
(The argument that Ijccausc students are not now using the information
about other nations provided expertly by our libraries and professors do< -
not prove that tho I.S.C. trips would be a waste, but rather shows the
need for a fresh approach and an added stimulus to inquire deeply into the
field of international relations.)
Surveyors can work on behalf of this purpose:
a) Through written reports for filing, general dissemination, publication
in the Daily.
b) Through speeches to the A.S.S.U. at assemblies, over KSU.
e) Through actual work on and guidance in campus committees.
d) Through speaking before hou.se meetings, etc., the initiative to ho
taken hy the surveyor himself.
o) Through taking part, in the International Discussion Groups (not
lectures) and providing fresh material for them.
(The discussion groups can furnish interesting forums on, for example,
political trends in France utilizing natives of France, war veterans who
wore there, and I.S.C. students to discuss the pre-war, wartime, and post
war situations.)
112) Possibly, through presenting movies of the trip.
111. To provide Stanford students with information to better enable
them to take concrete measures concerning world problems.
A. Relief
1. Determination of what areas need relief the most, character of relief
neodod, through personal observation.
2. Description of conditions in areas visited.
3. Report on reception and-administration of relief packages sent in
the past.
(Such research on I.S.C. trips would doubtless greatly implement drives
on tho campus not only from tho information but the appeal standpoint
Tho Four Feathers Drive last fall was honestly appraised a flop; it lacked
the personal closeness and concrete liaison necessary to touch the giver )
H. Political action
I. In Stanford, survey reports will aid discussions and student confei •
onces ending in resolutions 1o go to the National Students' Organization
and thence to Congress or the U.N. delegation.
2. After Stanford, survey reports will not only aid tho surveyors hot
all those who shared his information, as voters and in occupations.
(A citizen's international awareness does not blossom with graduation
from college or other such ago or psychological demarcations. It is a con
stantly growing habit. The I.S.C. will attempt to stimulate thought on the
subject now.)
IV. To tie in with Stanford's educational program.
a. Through furthering exchange scholarships, exchange professorship:,,
and general study abroad.
1. By talking to University representatives while there.
2. By explaining, at Stanford, the advantages of foreign study, do: it> ~.
of foreign students in this connection, by getting information on other uni
vcrsitie.s that is only available through personal contacts, such as housing,
physical conditions in the university areas.
(This information would be a valuable asset to the Information Kile
begun last, week under Excom sanction.)
V. To encourage students to look overseas for jobs.
a) To gain information and informal contacts for those already dofi
nitely interested.
b) To encourage those persons who had not before considered employ *
mont or the spending of any other time abroad.
(This information would also be a valuable asset to the Information
File.)

VI. To !>uilrl (lie International
Survey Committed at Stanford
and nationally. These are long
range plans.
a) The survey plan can he advo
cated through the National Stu
dents' Organization if it succeeds at
Stanford; thus the survey method of
promoting international understand
ing and good will will lie hugely
expanded.
b) As the idea grows at Stanford,
we may l>e able through increased
financial backing from A.S.S.U. to
send more students to more coun
tries.
(The present I.S.C. committee
wishes to establish the plan as a
growing tradition to aid the young
er, non-veteran student body which
will be at Stanford in the near fu
ture —those who haven't war
and its effects, and who will per

for international understanding as

Why is I.S.C. of value? Out of the haze of confusion and criticism,
many Stanford students have not been able to get a clear picture of the
purposes for sending several persons abroad in the summer.
They have not boon able to see why I.S.C. is a necessary part of our
hopeful programs for furthering international understanding, why it ha
specialized functions and aims that can only be carried out through such,
trips.
Most of the trouble derives from the fact that the present I.S.C!. pro

Since those outlines have boon filled in and changed almost every day
