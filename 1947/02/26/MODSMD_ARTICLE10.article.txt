# TRESIDDER BACKS DRIVE
## 
### 
The following letter was received from Dr. Tresidder in
support of the Red Cross Drive:
Stanford's American Red Cross Drive is one that merits the
support of all students within their financial means.
The Red Cross has long been a bulwark against disaster and
suffering. It is still doing much to aid veterans, whether hos
pitalized or back in civilian life, to say nothing of its humani
tarian activities in rehabilitation of war victims in Europe and
other areas of the world.
Stanford's many veterans have no need to be told of the fine
work done by the Red Cross during World War 11. They will
be giving to an organization whose gray-clad workers were war
time symbols to servicemen of friendliness and helpfulness.
The Red Cross work continues in peace as well as in war, and
I hope that the Stanford drive will reach its goal swiftly so that
the student body will be doing its share in support of the Red
Cross efforts to fight misery and suffering all over the world.
Donald B. Tresidder.
