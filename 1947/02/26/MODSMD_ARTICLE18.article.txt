Britain will give up its lesponsibili- j
ty for the defense of India if that j
country decides to withdraw from j
the British Empire, Prime Minister
Clement R. Attlee said today.
If India remains in the ompir.* i(f
status as regards defense will be tin
same as that of the dominions, Att
lee said. He added that if i; did
not, Britain would be happy to dis- J
cuss the question of India's security ;
subject to the United Nations char- j
tcr.
Attlee made his statenu:M on In- \
dieh defense in the House of Com- |
mons in reply to a conservative j
question. The question reflected a
general feeling in opposition ranks
that, in deciding urbitranly to with
draw from India, the government is
threatening to upset the balance of j
power in Asia.
Meantime the House of Lords-' I
opened a two-Jv/ deb. Tv on a cen
sure motion again >! the Labor Gov- |
ernment's decision to give up its j
rule of India by June, 1948.
