# BURGLARS GO SOFT
## 
### 
WINSLOW, Ariz.. Feb. 25 (UP).
â€”Burglars who robbed the F. C.
Whipple sporting goods store here
were either blind or had a soft spot
in their hearts.
The thieves knocked the combina
tion knob off the sale. They took
$370, but left an envelope with $190
in it marked "Community Chest
Fund."
