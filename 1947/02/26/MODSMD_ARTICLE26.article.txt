riui'OSES
According to F. C. Strickland ol
the Drama Department, these four
men and one woman serve a nuin-
Ici ol purposes. First, for a grow-;
irtf? and enlarging program such as

the Drama Department is planning,
qualified actors are needed who
have more time to devote to the
work. The three fellowship actors
can devote all their time to rehears
ing, whereas the regular students
have other classes that interfere
with rehearsals.
Second, the addition of these ex
perienced actors and technicians
raises the caliber of the Players'
productions and thus gives the au
dience a better type of play.
INSTRUCT STUDENTS
Third, these fellowship students
act as assistants to the drama pro
lessors by helping to teach students
the rudiments of acting and techni
cal work, and thereby taking some
of the work oft the professors'
hands. Also, these professionals
have just come from Broadway and
have learned acting tips that they
can pass on to the students and thus
help them to become better actors.
"These fellowship students," said
Mr. Strickland, "are helping the
Drama Department a great deal in
these three ways. They will be used
as they are needed and it is hoped
that they will help the department
fulfill its dual purpose of creating
superior actors and presenting good
plays."
