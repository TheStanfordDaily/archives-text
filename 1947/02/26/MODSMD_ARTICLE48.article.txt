# Thinclads Await Season Opening

### JOHN HUBBARD 
"This weather is great," exulted track coach Jack Weiers
hauser, sharing the sentiments of everyone on the sun-swept
Stanford campus.
"It's fine for training," he continued. "Up to this week, prog
ress had been held back seriously by rain and muggy weather."

One look at the blackboard of
"best performances" posted on the
porch of the clubhouse at Angel 1
Field tells the story.
Take the mile listing, for instance.
Early last week Frank Ganahl, dis
tance specialist, led the field with a
4:31.4 effort. This week the black
board shows that he has cut his time
down almost seven seconds, and is
now credited with a 4:24 7 mark.
In 1946 Ganahl won the Big Meet
mile event in 4:25.
And Ganahl is just one example.
There are approximately 100 men
working out under the tutelage of
Weiershauser and assistant coach
Cornelius '"Dutch" Warmerdam
and almost every one of them is
showing noticeable improvement.

tance specialist, led the field with a
4:31.4 effort. This week the black
board shows that he has cut his time
down almost seven seconds, and is
now credited with a 4:24 7 mark.
In 1946 Ganahl won the Big Meet
mile event in 4:25.
And Ganahl is just one example.
There are approximately 100 men
working out under the tutelage of
Weiershauser and assistant coach

and almost every one of them is
showing noticeable improvement.
Following is a run-down of the

"This weather is great," exulted track coach Jack Weiers
hauser, sharing the sentiments of everyone on the sun-swept
Stanford campus.
"It's fine for training," he continued. "Up to this week, prog
