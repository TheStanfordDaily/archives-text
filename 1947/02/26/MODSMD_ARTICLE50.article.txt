ably he lost in the shufi'le when
they arrive at Oakland Saturday,
for facing them in the elimination
tournament will be the top col
legiate and ajnateur wrestlers of j
the coast.
With ace Indian wrestler Win- j
ston Mum-by definitely consigned ;
'o the sidelines, Jones appears to
be Stanford's only entrant who has
any chance of emerging from the j
meet with an individual title.
The LSti-pound scrapper from
Illinois is rated by opponents as
the man to beat in his weight class
as he is undefeated in the few
starts he has made this winter.
Jones' toughest opponent should
be Borg of San Jose whom Jones
has already defeated this season.
San Francisco's Olympic Club, ;
loaded with ex-collegiate wrestling
talent, and San Jose's undefeated
Spartans are expected to leave the
rest of the teams far behind as they
fight it out for the team title Satur
day. â€¢

formance in the meet are not very
high. Coach liarry Stone main

able to cop a first place.
Chief interest in individual bouts
among coast wrestling fans is cen

the 175-lb. championship. Although
UC's Hugh Mumby, brother of
Stanford's Winston,'will probably be
forced to follow his brother to the
sidelines Saturday because of a re
cent injury, two other top-notch
grapplers, Hans Weidenhofer of San
Jose and Miller of the Olympic
Club, will be on hand to battle it
out.
