## Let's Get This Clear 
### 
Our editorial suggesting that an over-all
housing committee be established has brought
many comments to the effect that there is
such a committee. So, a fuller explanation is
in order.
There is no over-all committee on housing.
There is a committee which has been given
the job to prepare a plan which will deter
mine who will and who will not go to Toyon.
Now let's define a few terms. By "over-all
committee" we mean one that would consider
the housing problem, as was presented in the
previous editorial, of Toyon and the Village
and any other place where non-fraternity
men live. By "Toyon committee" we mean
that committee that ha« been appointed to de
termine who will go to that hall.
John Stalnaker, dean of students, stated
yesterday that he believed that the Toyon
question should be settled first before cer
tain difficulties in the Village were consid
ered.
If, however, the students want the problem
handled by an over-all committee, he said, he
is perfectly willing to cooperate with such a
committee when and if the A.S.S.U. creates it.
One of the problems that have developed
in the Village is this:
There is an opinion among the administra
tors of the Village, we are told by a reporter
who lives there, that perhaps the freshmen
who do go there should get private rooms.

I his means that some of the students already
there would have to be moved to the more
barrack-like buildings. This question has not
been settled.
Another question involving the Village is:
What percentage, if any, of those living
there, can move to Toyon?
Now this last qustion, it seems to us is def
initely inter-related with the Toyon commit
tee's assignment.
So we talked to members of the three-man
committee to see if they understand their task
to include this.
This is what we got.
"Don't quote me "
The sum total of what we didn't quote
equals this: They aren't sure just what their
assignment is.
We phoned Martin Anderson about the
housing committee and what its duties were.
He referred us to Dean Stalnaker.
There you have it. There is the story, or
as much of it as we can get by phoning or
seeing all the people connected with it.
We think therefore that an all-over commit
tee should be appointed to settle the whole
problem, and also committees should be given
a better idea of their assignments when they
are appointed.
The Daily is in no position to ask for per
fection—in government or anything else—
but we make the above suggestions in the
spirit of constructive criticism.—J.C.O.

such a committee. So, a fuller explanation is
in order.
There is no over-all committee on housing.
There is a committee which has been given
the job to prepare a plan which will deter
mine who will and who will not go to Toyon.
Now let's define a few terms. By "over-all
committee" we mean one that would consider
the housing problem, as was presented in the
previous editorial, of Toyon and the Village
and any other place where non-fraternity
men live. By "Toyon committee" we mean
that committee that ha« been appointed to de
termine who will go to that hall.
John Stalnaker, dean of students, stated
yesterday that he believed that the Toyon
question should be settled first before cer
tain difficulties in the Village were consid
ered.
If, however, the students want the problem
handled by an over-all committee, he said, he
is perfectly willing to cooperate with such a
committee when and if the A.S.S.U. creates it.
One of the problems that have developed
in the Village is this:
There is an opinion among the administra
tors of the Village, we are told by a reporter
who lives there, that perhaps the freshmen
who do go there should get private rooms.

I his means that some of the students already
there would have to be moved to the more
barrack-like buildings. This question has not
been settled.
Another question involving the Village is:
What percentage, if any, of those living
there, can move to Toyon?
Now this last qustion, it seems to us is def
initely inter-related with the Toyon commit
tee's assignment.
So we talked to members of the three-man
committee to see if they understand their task
to include this.
This is what we got.
"Don't quote me "
The sum total of what we didn't quote
equals this: They aren't sure just what their
assignment is.
We phoned Martin Anderson about the
housing committee and what its duties were.
He referred us to Dean Stalnaker.
There you have it. There is the story, or
as much of it as we can get by phoning or
seeing all the people connected with it.
We think therefore that an all-over commit
tee should be appointed to settle the whole
problem, and also committees should be given
a better idea of their assignments when they
are appointed.
The Daily is in no position to ask for per
fection—in government or anything else—
but we make the above suggestions in the
spirit of constructive criticism.—J.C.O.
Our editorial suggesting that an over-all
housing committee be established has brought
many comments to the effect that there is
such a committee. So, a fuller explanation is
in order.
