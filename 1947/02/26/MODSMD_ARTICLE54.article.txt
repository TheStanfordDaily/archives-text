### CARL HEINTZE 
This is just a word for the sickest part of present
day campus life, Stanford's eating clubs. Since the
war the clubs have been reduced by one thing and
another to relative obscurity, and right now they are
fighting a hard fight to keep going.
There was a time when the clubs filled a definite
niche in Stanford life. They had a lot to offer, and
still do for the fellow who doesn't want to go up the
How. but not many people know just what they
were, or what they stand for.
Before Pearl Harbor there were seven clubs: Los
Arcos, El Tigre, El Capitan, and El Quadro, which
occupied the small rooms along the rear of Encina
Commons, and Breakers, El Campo and El Toro
which held forth in what was called the "Little Quad."
It used to stand between Encina and Toyon and is
now sadly perched up on stilts over by the ROTC
stables.
The essential purpose of the eating clubs was to
give a man some one to eat with, a way to make
more social contacts, and to act as a balance be
tween the Row and the relatively loose organiza
tion of men's halls.
The clubs had a lot of fine traditions, all but for
gotten now, and had a real influence in campus life.
'I hey got a priority on rooms in Toyon and Branner
(an issue which is at the present moment in doubt).
They made it possible for a man to forego the pleas
ure of Encina breakfasts if he had no 8 o'clocks, and
still not have to pay a penalty for it (a nasty part
of the present eating system).
Each club had a personality, more or less, of its own.
Tigres for example were renowned as Branner poli
ticians. Breakers was famed for its water fights and
anti-woman attitude. Capitan always had a repu
tation after genial John Bunn was an (uninvited)
guest at one of their beer busts.
The clubs also formed a natural foundation for
intra-mural teams in all sports, just as fraternities
do, and they used to have some very good teams,
too.

They hcicl regular social functions, dances, beer
busts, parties, and so on, and by their method of
selection of membership, they made sure that all
members of the individual c;lub were congenial and
possessed of a common interest.
That's the way things were.
Right now, the clubs are up against it. Their pri
ority on rooms is in doubt, and (if it still stands) it
will only apply to Toyon.
I hat doesn't give them much to offer the lower
classman who wants to get out of the Village and
into an on-campus room.
All the clubs now eat in one large room in En- !
cina Commons. While it is a start, it isn't a solution :
by any means. Any food plans depend upon what
the Commons wants to do. and the breakfast which
you could take or leave as you wished doesn't meet
with Commons approval. Another advantage the
clubs might have had there is gone.
Because they are all together, the clubs don't
have a chance to establish any individuality as they
did before. They don't really feel that they have a I
place of their own, and. in fact, they don't.
The three 'independents" Toro, Breakers, and El
Lampo liked it when they had their own building.
All they have now is memories.
Lastly, a large portion of the clubs' membership ;
consists of graduates and seniors who will not be in |
school much longer. Until recently, freshmen have- â– 
n't shown much interest in club life, for which one
can hardly blame them. There hasn't been much
club life. But the inclusion of freshmen in the clubs
is essential if they are to continue.
Of course, in the end, it all comes down to this. Is
Stanford really interested in seeing the clubs con
tinued? True, we are in an abnormal situation as
far as campus living is concerned, but there will be
an end to that. When it comes, and it will, there will
still be a definite need and place for eating clubs.
They are a part of Stanford.
