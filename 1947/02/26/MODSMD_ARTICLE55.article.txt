The other day a letter arrived which made me
very happy; it was favorable—for a change. The
letter itself would be of interest only to me, but in
part it said, . . Today (Friday) you gave summary
<>112 battle between Lilienthal and McKellar—a clear,
unbiased, and pertinent summary on one of the most
pertinent issues of the clay. . . "
Unbiased my eye. The McKellar-Lilienthal col
umn was definitely biased; deliberately so. I hope
I shall always be biased against men like McKellar,
and in favor of men like Mi - . Lilienthal. I pride
myself on it.
To me, David Lilenthal is not so much a man as
an issue; an ideal, if you wish. He represents the
honest, capable public servant —of whom there are
still many. Id like to see these efficient men move
tip to higher positions; America needs them.
Sen. McKellar, on the other hand, is the symbol
of the Jacksonian spoils system at its very worst.
Patronage at its best is merely a method of reward
ing faithful supporters; at its worst it is a garotte
around the throat of good government. Sen. McKel
lar is the most notorious of the patronage seekers;
his avidity is boundless.
Would that David Lilienthal were the Senator from
Tennessee in place of McKellar! McKellar stays in
office merely because Tennessee is under the heel of
Boss Crump, whom he has served well. We talk about
free elections for foreign countries, and are scandal
ized because the Russians don't believe in them;
yet. in many places here at home, the same situa
tion exists. Some day—l tell myself—we'll succeed
in cleaning our own house.
But my biased attitude isn't centered entirely on
such minor politicians as Sen. Kenneth McKellar;
it includes those "statesmen" who want to take this
country back to the policies of McKinley, or even
back to Harding. Coolidge, or Hoover. The world
has progressed; a do-nothing, head-in-the-sand at
titude now would be ridiculous. You can't run an

automobile on hay; neither can you run a present
day government on the Republican platform of 1890.
Best known of all the men who sigh for the good
old days is Sen. Robert Taft of Ohio, who is probably
the only man alive today who thinks William Howard
Taft was a great President. I am biased against him
and all who agree with him, and I shudder to think
that he might well capture the Presidency in 1948.
He has been called the best-informed man in the
Senate.
Well, he has a brain like a filing cabinet—he prob
ably knows more facts than any other Senator. But
intelligence is shown by the interpretation of facts
known, not by the spewing out of statistics—and
there be falls down. He reminds me of the late Sen.
William E. Borah, who in the spring of 1939 in
formed the world that the U. S. State Department
was wrong, that he had better information, and
that there would be no European war.
My bias also encompasses the Wallace crowd, a
group of men who, it seems to me, think with their
emotions. They see that something is wrong; rather
than make a careful analysis they attempt to do
away with everything that exists, feeling — vaguely,
no doubt—that if enough changes are made we must
inevitably find the trouble.
Henry Wallace tried to change the Byrnes-Vanden
berg-Connolly policy toward Russia. He evidently
didn't realize that in the first. Moscow conference he
attended James F. Byrnes had tried everything Wal
lace later advocated —and came home without his
shirt. Appeasement has never worked, and I don't
think it ever will.
So you see that I'm biased against politicians
seeking to maintain themselves in power at the ex
pense of the people; I'm biased against those who op
pose any change at all those who think. "What was
good enough for my father is good enough for me;"
and I'm biased against men who want change just
for the sake of change. Me unbiased? Hardly!

Unbiased my eye. The McKellar-Lilienthal col
umn was definitely biased; deliberately so. I hope
I shall always be biased against men like McKellar,
and in favor of men like Mi - . Lilienthal. I pride
myself on it.
To me, David Lilenthal is not so much a man as
an issue; an ideal, if you wish. He represents the
honest, capable public servant —of whom there are
still many. Id like to see these efficient men move
tip to higher positions; America needs them.
Sen. McKellar, on the other hand, is the symbol
of the Jacksonian spoils system at its very worst.
Patronage at its best is merely a method of reward
ing faithful supporters; at its worst it is a garotte
around the throat of good government. Sen. McKel
lar is the most notorious of the patronage seekers;
his avidity is boundless.
Would that David Lilienthal were the Senator from
Tennessee in place of McKellar! McKellar stays in
office merely because Tennessee is under the heel of
Boss Crump, whom he has served well. We talk about
free elections for foreign countries, and are scandal
ized because the Russians don't believe in them;
yet. in many places here at home, the same situa
tion exists. Some day—l tell myself—we'll succeed
in cleaning our own house.
But my biased attitude isn't centered entirely on
such minor politicians as Sen. Kenneth McKellar;
it includes those "statesmen" who want to take this
country back to the policies of McKinley, or even
back to Harding. Coolidge, or Hoover. The world
has progressed; a do-nothing, head-in-the-sand at
titude now would be ridiculous. You can't run an

automobile on hay; neither can you run a present
day government on the Republican platform of 1890.
Best known of all the men who sigh for the good
old days is Sen. Robert Taft of Ohio, who is probably
the only man alive today who thinks William Howard
Taft was a great President. I am biased against him
and all who agree with him, and I shudder to think
that he might well capture the Presidency in 1948.
He has been called the best-informed man in the
Senate.
Well, he has a brain like a filing cabinet—he prob
ably knows more facts than any other Senator. But
intelligence is shown by the interpretation of facts
known, not by the spewing out of statistics—and
there be falls down. He reminds me of the late Sen.
William E. Borah, who in the spring of 1939 in
formed the world that the U. S. State Department
was wrong, that he had better information, and
that there would be no European war.
My bias also encompasses the Wallace crowd, a
group of men who, it seems to me, think with their
emotions. They see that something is wrong; rather
than make a careful analysis they attempt to do
away with everything that exists, feeling — vaguely,
no doubt—that if enough changes are made we must
inevitably find the trouble.
Henry Wallace tried to change the Byrnes-Vanden
berg-Connolly policy toward Russia. He evidently
didn't realize that in the first. Moscow conference he
attended James F. Byrnes had tried everything Wal
lace later advocated —and came home without his
shirt. Appeasement has never worked, and I don't
think it ever will.
So you see that I'm biased against politicians
seeking to maintain themselves in power at the ex
pense of the people; I'm biased against those who op
pose any change at all those who think. "What was
good enough for my father is good enough for me;"
and I'm biased against men who want change just
