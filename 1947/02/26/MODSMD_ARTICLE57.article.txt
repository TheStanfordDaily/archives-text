# Ad Building Houses Switchboard Oracle
## 
### STEVE McKEE 
Men have always seemed to feel
that any feminine voice from an in
visible source is apparently unat
tached and must have supernatural
powers of perception and great
stores of wisdom. It was so with the
oracle at Delphi in first - quarter
Western Civ and it is true today
with the Farm's uwn oracle, the
Un i versity switch board.
"BELIEVE IT'
Americans in this lucid age, after
having heard a pleasant voice say
"Stanford University," have been
known to present such vagaries as
these to the busy operators:
"One of my hens lays three eggs
a day. What shall I do?"
"Could you tell me how to spell
'cataclysm'?"
"A cow next door just had a calf.
Would you please call the dairy
and tell them to look after her?"
Such quotations seem to fall on
the shady side of a "Believe It or
Not" story, but we have them as
truth from Mrs. Georgia Ragghianti,
chief operator, who had it as truth
from the former chief.
MYSTERIOUS OFFICE?
The feeling of the mysterious pre
vails even when one sees the tele
phone office itself. It is in a hidden
room, apparently unknown but to
a few of Stanford's oldest janitors
and the water man.
It is at the head of a dark, narrow
stairway in the buck of the Admin
istration Building, Room 127 to be
exact. The door is always locked;
it seems that the operators have
enough to do without coping with
the problems of migratory Indians
on the prowl for lost classrooms.
INGENUITY PREVAILS
Within is a small room, armored
with steeply angled Venetian blinds
which filter the daylight into soft

mellowness and ward off American
curiosity. The room is equipped
with tiie switchboard, a small dress
ing room, a coffee maker, and a wa
ter stand. The switchboard and the
coffee maker are inadequate in the j
postwar boom; the water stand when j
last seen was empty.
Here Mrs. Ragghianti presides
over her crew of four operators from
8 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. The day's
traffic includes from 90 to 120 long
distance calls and uncounted thou
sands of local calls. This is the
place where the groping ignorance
that is the "outside world" is prop
erly sorted and connected with the j
reservoir of elucidation that is offi
cial Stanford.
The ingenuity of the operators in
using the Bawlout, the telephone
book, and other more obscure
sources of information must be
sharp and quick.
INFORMAL WORK
The operators say they prefer to
work at Stanford rather than for
the telephone company where the
atmosphere is more formal and al
most military.
These women are telephone op
erators and don't claim to be au
thorities on prolific chickens, the re
incarnated spirit of Noah Webster,
a combined "Voice of Experience"
and "Information Please," or in j
touch with the local pediatric vet- j
erinary. But it all seems to be in a j
day's work.

Would you please call the dairy
and tell them to look after her?"
Such quotations seem to fall on
the shady side of a "Believe It or
Not" story, but we have them as
truth from Mrs. Georgia Ragghianti,
chief operator, who had it as truth
from the former chief.
MYSTERIOUS OFFICE?
The feeling of the mysterious pre
vails even when one sees the tele
phone office itself. It is in a hidden
room, apparently unknown but to
a few of Stanford's oldest janitors
and the water man.
It is at the head of a dark, narrow
stairway in the buck of the Admin
istration Building, Room 127 to be
exact. The door is always locked;
it seems that the operators have
enough to do without coping with
the problems of migratory Indians
on the prowl for lost classrooms.
INGENUITY PREVAILS
Within is a small room, armored
with steeply angled Venetian blinds
which filter the daylight into soft

mellowness and ward off American
curiosity. The room is equipped
with tiie switchboard, a small dress
ing room, a coffee maker, and a wa
ter stand. The switchboard and the
coffee maker are inadequate in the j
postwar boom; the water stand when j
last seen was empty.
Here Mrs. Ragghianti presides
over her crew of four operators from
8 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. The day's
traffic includes from 90 to 120 long
distance calls and uncounted thou
sands of local calls. This is the
place where the groping ignorance
that is the "outside world" is prop
erly sorted and connected with the j
reservoir of elucidation that is offi
cial Stanford.
The ingenuity of the operators in
using the Bawlout, the telephone
book, and other more obscure
sources of information must be
sharp and quick.
INFORMAL WORK
The operators say they prefer to
work at Stanford rather than for
the telephone company where the
atmosphere is more formal and al
most military.
These women are telephone op
erators and don't claim to be au
thorities on prolific chickens, the re
incarnated spirit of Noah Webster,
a combined "Voice of Experience"
and "Information Please," or in j
touch with the local pediatric vet- j
erinary. But it all seems to be in a j
day's work.
Men have always seemed to feel
that any feminine voice from an in
visible source is apparently unat
tached and must have supernatural
powers of perception and great
stores of wisdom. It was so with the
oracle at Delphi in first - quarter
Western Civ and it is true today
with the Farm's uwn oracle, the
Un i versity switch board.
"BELIEVE IT'
Americans in this lucid age, after
having heard a pleasant voice say
"Stanford University," have been
known to present such vagaries as
these to the busy operators:
"One of my hens lays three eggs
a day. What shall I do?"
"Could you tell me how to spell
'cataclysm'?"
"A cow next door just had a calf.
Would you please call the dairy
and tell them to look after her?"
