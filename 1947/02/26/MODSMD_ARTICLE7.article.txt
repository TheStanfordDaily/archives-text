# Council Dismisses Cheating Charges
## 
### 
Men's Council yesterday after- |
noon dropped charges against two!
men students suspected of violating'
the honor code. The two students,
appearing before the council, were |
dismissed on the grounds of insuf- |
licient evidence, James Welch, j
council secretary announced.
Welch said the two students had
been charged with cheating in a re
cent examination, one for passing in
formation and the other for utilizing
said information.
Another student, summoned to j
the meeting after being reported as
creating a disturbance at History
Corner, was dismissed when ques- |
tioning revealed the report â€¢ carried (
wrong names.
"However," Welch stated, "'this I
disturbance case is definitely not j
closed. If council obtains accurate I
information as to who was responsi- j
ble. severe sentences will be passed .
on the guilty parties."
Prior to the honor code and dis- J
turbancc hearings, council reviewed j
cases of nine students charged with j
parking violations. Of these, Welch
said one was fined for speeding,
one for illegal parking, four sus
pended for illegal parking, two
fined for driving the wrong way on
one-way streets, and one fined and
reprimanded for driving a car on
Quad.
Welch said he wished to remind I
students that the yellow standpipes ,
used at the Village as fireplugs by I
the army are as much "off limits" I
for parking as regular plugs.
