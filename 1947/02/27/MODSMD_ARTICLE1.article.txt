# Red Cross Drive Goes Into Last Two Days
## 
### 
By JOANNE O'BRIEN
With only two more days to go, j
Stanford students have contributed '
only $733.96 or less than one-third j
of the Red Cross Drive $3,000 goal,
Ann Lilienthal, treasurer of the
drive, announced yesterday.
Two hundred and fifty-four dol
lars were received yesterday. Theta j
Chi, Village 119, and Lathrop were j
added to Phi Kappa Sigma and One- I
West of Branner as 100 per cent
contributors.
Only today and tomorrow remain
for Stanford to go "over the top"
and Barbara Allen, chairman of the
drive, urged students to add their
dollar to the national Red Cross
fund and "push the red line of the
Cellar thermometer up and over the ,
$3,000 mark."
Miss Lilienthal asked house and i
corridor representatives to turn in !

their results immediately. She will
be in the Excom room from 1 to
2 p.m. and in the A.S.S.U. presi
dent's office from 2 to 3 p.m. today
and tomorrow.
"One of the main troubles," said
Miss Lilienthal, "is that we have
had no news at all from Both,
Russell, and Jordan houses. Ru
ble, Toyon, Encina. Union Unit,
and many of the fraternities have
so far made poor showings in the
drive," she asserted.
Off - campus students may con
tribute to booths in front of the
Cellar and on the History corner.
"Off-campus students have shown
fine support of the Rod Cross so
far," stated Miss Lilienthal.
RESIDENTS TO BE CONTACTED
Permanent residents of the cam
pus, whether faculty or staff, will
be contacted for their Red Cross

j contributions during the national
| drive beginning Saturday.
"Stanford's hoped-for $3,000 will
pour into the national Red Cross
! fund to help replenish treasuries
which will give aid to countless des
titute in this country and overseas,"
said Dare Stark McMullin, volun
teer publicity director of the Palo
Alto branch of the Red Cross.
"Many Stanford students have
probably asked, 'But what hap
pens to our money once we have
contributed to the Rod Cross?'"
remarked Mrs. McMullin.
"As adult Americans, Stanford
students should know where every
dollar they give goes to work," she
continued.
I "Tons of clothing and nearly four
million dollars' worth of medical
supplies are currently being distrib
uted by the American Red Cross in

China, in a continuing rrlief pro
gram which has exceeded more than
$10,000,000 worth of supplies since
the beginning of World War II," she
Illustrated.
RED CROSS FEEDS THOUSANDS
"It costs money to clothe and
feed thousands," she continued, "and
the only way the Red Cross can
continue these acts of mercy is
through generous contributions by
everyone.
"With two-thirds of your dollar
you serve the armed forces and vet
erans. You give young Americans a
decent, cheerful home club for their
time off.
"In America you keep Red
Cross workers in hospitals who
keep up young veterans' spirits,
help them to take interest again,
to feel their cure is important.
You help veterans and their fami

lies iii money emergencies in sud
den illness, in job dltticulties, in
! wrangles with red tape.
"You guard the home front. You
j teach water - safety and lifesaving,
first aid and home nursing, accident
prevention and highway safety," she
said.
"You buy the cloth that keeps
thousands of volunteer women mak -
ing children's dresses and overalls,
baby clothes and blankets that go
to women overseas that haven't even
needles and thread.
"The student drive is yours. The
name of Stanford for generosity, re
sponsibility, sympathy, is yours for
a week. Each one of you has ;i
right to be asked. The little tin
fiag in your lapel marks you as a
volunteer in goodwill, a cltlz»*n in
humanity," Mrs. McMullin conclud
ed.

students should know where every
dollar they give goes to work," she

RED CROSS FEEDS THOUSANDS
"It costs money to clothe and
feed thousands," she continued, "and
the only way the Red Cross can
continue these acts of mercy is
through generous contributions by
everyone.
"With two-thirds of your dollar
you serve the armed forces and vet
erans. You give young Americans a
decent, cheerful home club for their
time off.
"In America you keep Red
Cross workers in hospitals who
keep up young veterans' spirits,
help them to take interest again,
to feel their cure is important.
You help veterans and their fami

"You guard the home front. You
j teach water - safety and lifesaving,
first aid and home nursing, accident

said.
"You buy the cloth that keeps
thousands of volunteer women mak -

RED CROSS FEEDS THOUSANDS
"It costs money to clothe and
feed thousands," she continued, "and
the only way the Red Cross can
continue these acts of mercy is
through generous contributions by
everyone.
"With two-thirds of your dollar
you serve the armed forces and vet
erans. You give young Americans a
decent, cheerful home club for their
time off.
"In America you keep Red
Cross workers in hospitals who
keep up young veterans' spirits,
help them to take interest again,
to feel their cure is important.
You help veterans and their fami

lies iii money emergencies in sud
den illness, in job dltticulties, in
! wrangles with red tape.
"You guard the home front. You
j teach water - safety and lifesaving,
first aid and home nursing, accident
prevention and highway safety," she
said.
"You buy the cloth that keeps
thousands of volunteer women mak -
ing children's dresses and overalls,
baby clothes and blankets that go
to women overseas that haven't even
needles and thread.
"The student drive is yours. The
name of Stanford for generosity, re
sponsibility, sympathy, is yours for
a week. Each one of you has ;i
right to be asked. The little tin
fiag in your lapel marks you as a
volunteer in goodwill, a cltlz»*n in
humanity," Mrs. McMullin conclud
ed.
