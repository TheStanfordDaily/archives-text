# Coach Dean, Luisetti Congratulate Team
## 
### 
Hank laiisetti, Stanford's former
All - American basketball star,
congratulated this year's team
last night for showing skeptics
that no enthusiasm for Farm ath
letics has Ik*cii lost in reconver
sion.
Speaking at a pre - Cal game
rally in Cubbcrley Auditorium.
"Basketball's Mr. Basketball"
pointed out that a team which
soared this season from an under
dog position to possible winners
of the league deserves every bit
of spirit the school can offer.
Introducing the varsity players
to the audience of about 250, Coach
Everett Dean would predict no
outcome for the games, but em
phasized how much the school's
support would mean to the team.
