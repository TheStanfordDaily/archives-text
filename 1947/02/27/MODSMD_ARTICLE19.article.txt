### DICK KEUSINK 
The Stanford University Hoard of j
Trustees yesterday rejected a con- j
fidential plan of the City of Palo J
Alto to lease additional University j
property for a proposed enlargement
of the Palo Alto Hospital.
President Donald B. Trcsidder de
clared that the lands of Stanford
University were meant for Univcr- :
sity use.
"The University policy is to re- i
serve its land for present and future j
uses," said Dr. Tresiddcr. "The pres- j
cnt plan of the Palo Alto City Coun
cil floes not conform with the gen
eral University policy."
The continued increase in regis- |
tration at Stanford and the conse
quent need to allow for expansion
entered into the Board of Trustees'

I decision not to lease additional eam
i pus lands.
Only 4 per cent of the patients at
j the hospital are Stanford students,
| and 38 per cent are Palo Alto resi
dents. The remaining (>() per cent
of the patients are from outside the
immediate community.

I inanities at Stanford, was made in
' the course of a general review of
planning studies going forward for
j the University. The statement had
no direct bearing on the hospital
; situation, but helped explain the ac
tion of the Board of Trustees.

'I no University should give Us
most careful scrutiny in its long
range planning to any further en
croachment on the flal land of the
University grounds. Stanford should
bo careful in view of thr unforeseen
demands for more land that may bo
made on the University," said Dr.
Mumford.
The Stanford trustees havo noli
(iod the city council's hospital com
mittee that they arc willing to ne
gotiate for purchase of the present
hospital buildings. These buildings
■ could be used by the University for
an infirmary, research center, or to
i provide dormitory space.
The city now holds a 99-year lease
| on the Stanford land on which the
I hospital is situated.
The Stanford University Hoard of j
Trustees yesterday rejected a con- j
fidential plan of the City of Palo J
Alto to lease additional University j
property for a proposed enlargement
of the Palo Alto Hospital.
President Donald B. Trcsidder de
clared that the lands of Stanford
University were meant for Univcr- :
sity use.
"The University policy is to re- i
serve its land for present and future j
uses," said Dr. Tresiddcr. "The pres- j
cnt plan of the Palo Alto City Coun
cil floes not conform with the gen
eral University policy."
The continued increase in regis- |
tration at Stanford and the conse
quent need to allow for expansion
entered into the Board of Trustees'

I decision not to lease additional eam
i pus lands.
Only 4 per cent of the patients at
j the hospital are Stanford students,
| and 38 per cent are Palo Alto resi
dents. The remaining (>() per cent
of the patients are from outside the
immediate community.
