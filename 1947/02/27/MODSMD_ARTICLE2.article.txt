# Truman Merger Bill Asks For Joint Service Secretary
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 (UP).—President Truman today sent
Congress his long-awaited bill to bring the Army, Navy, and Air
Forces under a single secretary of National Defense.
The measure would achieve unification by setting up a na
tional defense establishmnt under which would be separate

departments of the Army, of the
Navy, and of the Air Force. Under
the civilian secretary of National
Defense would be a non-cabinet
rank secretary for each department.
Under the bill the Navy would
retain command of its own air forces,
both sea and land based. This means,
unless Congress decrees otherwise,
that the proposed new air force de
partment would control only the
present army air forces compon
ents.
Mr. Truman's measure also makes
changes in the provision for presi
dential succession, sets up a new
war council, joint staff, munitions
board and a research and develop
ment board. It also provides for a
national security council, a central
intelligence agency to supplant Army
and Navy intelligence which some
times did not cooperate so well in
the past—and a national security
resource board.
These are the highlights of the
proposed changes:
1. The War Department would be
known as the Department of the
Army and its chief would be the
Secretary of the Army.
2. The Department of the Navy
would include tin- present depart
ment at Washington headquarters
of the Tinted States Marine Corps
with its reserve components; the
Coast Guard when operating as a
part of the Navy; and (he entire
operating forces of the U.S. Navy,
including naval aviation.
3. The Department of the Air
Force would include the present
Army air forces, the air corps of
the U.S. Army, and the general head
quarters aii' force (Air Force Com
bat Command).
4. Under the proposed cabinet
setup, the act would change the
present cabinet line of presidential
succession by eliminating both the
present secretaries of War and Navy,
and substituting therefore the new
secretary of National Defense.
