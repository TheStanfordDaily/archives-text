Against a background of conflict and bickering over the or
ganization and function of campus international groups, Excom
last night voted a $100 appropriation to send two students to the

reaffirmation of approval of the
I.S.C. program by Excom members.
Rill Heyl, Village representative,

the I.S.C. to the student body.
FIELD ATTACKS
His stand was attacked by Carl
Field who injected a side issue ita the
I.S.C. conflict which has been rag
ing during the last weeks.
Field said, "Should Excom take on
the job of selling I.S.C'.? Does ii
have the right to push the plan on
students when they don't, want it?
He was answered by Carl Burke,
Row representative, who asserted,
"It is Excom's job to lead student
opinion, to bring the student body
to conform to Excom'.s views if we
can."
The question, "Do we as Excom
members vote the way we feel ot
the way our constituents feel?"
came up repeatedly during the meet
ing.
EXCOM INDEPENDENT
H. D. Thoreau, ofT-campus repre
sentative, declared, "Under the in
direct form of government we vote
as we sec fit."

was with the understanding that wÂ«-
would legislate according to our own
views."

the I.S.C. student observer plan.
Anderson in defending the plan ad
mitted, "I.S.C. is a little bit <>112 a
gamble."
He was supported by Micky
Titus. Encina representative, who
stated, "It's a gamble; we can't be
expected to know what the observ
ers will bring back, but let's see if
it's worth while."
LITTLE TIME
Muriel Lowe called for an alter
nate plan. "There is very little time
to do something and it can be best
accomplished by attendance at im
portant student conferences. It is
an opportunity to organize students
all over the world."

pointed out that his organization
has made no definite statement thai
