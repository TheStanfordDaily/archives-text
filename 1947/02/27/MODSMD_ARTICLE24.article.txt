year.

Hayden Scott, Dick Ryan, Laura
I'atton, and Cecil Rospaw. Hugh
Hal in attended most sessions as an
alternate.
Mo. t important issue before the
talc convention was the Commu
nist issue. A standing unanimous
vote put the convention on record
a: denouncing the Communist pai -
tv. Hiil recognizing the fact that il
i- hard (o define and find a Commu
nist. and rather than indulge in
red - baiting" or "witch-hunting,"
liny recognized that it is easier to
denounce (he party in principle and
to light issues out on the floor of
llie meetings and to reach conclu
( ions democratically.
IJ UNITS TABLE!)
The bonus question, ait important
i ue to all veterans, was tabled on
Ihe floor of the convention, and del
egates preferred to wait and see
what the action would be from the
national convention of AVC in Mil
v aukee this summer.
Monsignor Dunne, of Loyola Col
lege at Los Angeles, made the key
note address of the meeting. He dis
cussed the general problem of ra
cial tolerance, which he preferred to
call racial "justice." Pointing out
that in his mind a "progressive" is
a man who believes in human
rights above all other rights, he
made the charge that Americans of
today are confused internally be
cause of their stand on racial issues.
As a ma'or issue the convention
■ npported direct action on the hous
ing question. Whether on a national
or state level, veterans' or local an
j.le. they went on record for all bills
in legislation, including the Wag
net Ellender-Taft Bill, the Doug
las Bill, and any other measure that
would facilitate housing for the ma
jority of people in the country.
On international, national, and
l ite levels, the convention went on
record as favoring measures and
action which would promote the
motto of AVC, "Citizens First and
Veterans Second."
!M MOCKACY IN ACTION
Delegates to the convention were
chosen from the chapter by a vote
of the chapter, and each issue which
was adopted as a part of the state
platform, was passed by the floor on
a majority vote. The convention
has been considered by many ex
-1 ci ts as a fine example of "democ
racy in action." The resolutions
adopted by the San Jose meeting
will be the plan of action of AVC
for the coming year within the state
and on the national level.
Charles G. Bolte, national chair
man, held up by adverse weather
in the East, arrived in time to ad
dress the convention in session Sun
day. His plea was for unity. He re
called the beginnings of the organi
zation when it was nothing more
than a pile of letters in a New York
apartment.

chosen from the chapter by a vote
of the chapter, and each issue which
was adopted as a part of the state
platform, was passed by the floor on
a majority vote. The convention
has been considered by many ex
-1 ci ts as a fine example of "democ
racy in action." The resolutions
adopted by the San Jose meeting
will be the plan of action of AVC
for the coming year within the state
and on the national level.

man, held up by adverse weather

than a pile of letters in a New York
apartment.
