# Kappa Sig's 'Mother' Sleeps in Guest Room
## 
### 
"Suzie Henzie (Mrs.) . . . SSS UD
. . . Kappa Sigma." That's what the
Bawlout says, and she does live in
a fraternity house.
Actually, Mrs. Henzie's husband
George is a graduate student and
resident adviser of the fraternity,
and the young couple solved their
campus housing problem by taking
advantage of the guest room that
goes with the job of R.A.
Unofficially Mrs. Henzie is house
mother to the 35 Kappa Sigs, oc
casionally sewing up a torn sweater
or typing a term paper for one of
the men. Whenever a chaperone is
needed for a house social function,
the chairman calls on the Henzies.
Lending the feminine touch to the
scene, she arranges the flowers and
gives advice when the huge recep
tion hall is converted into a ball
room for the evening.

| One of husband George's duties
! is to be present at fraternity meals,
so an extra place is set for the
woman of the house too.
"It not only solves our food prob
lem," Mrs. Henzie points out, "but I
' don't have to do any dishes."
Mrs. Henzie, a transfer from Wil
liam and Mary, is majoring in po
litical science while her husband is
in his fust year at Law School. He
was discharged from the navy last
yoar, and they were married last
July.
Laughingly admitting that her
friends in Richmond, Va., aren't
quite used to her address yet, Mrs.
Henzie says,"I don't think they're
used to the idea of my living in a
fraternity house yet. but they know
I'm very happy here. George and I
both feel we're very lucky."
