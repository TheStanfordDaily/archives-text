Quite a fabulous guy this Hank
Luisetti . . .
They called him 'the greatest bas
ketball player of all time," after be
led the Stanford cagers to three con
secutive Pacific Coast Conference
Championships, breaking a fistful
<>l national and conference individual
scoring records.
The city papers dubbed him
llankus-Pankus, and dragged out
.til their classiest adjectives when
lie ran wild week after week in
the Pavilion or wherever else
Coach John Bunn and his Indians
t ravelled.
Hank returned to the Farm last
night to speak at the Cal game
rally. And if Hank wasn't so mod
es! lie could tell us lot>> of stories
about some Cal games in the past,
when the "Laughing Boys" time
and time again dumped the lierk
leyans.
It was in the final Cal game in
HKJN that "the Stanford flash" broke
i hi' world's four-year individual
scoring records when he scored his
1596 th collegiate point. That's right,
1,596 points. That same year he
broke his own conference scoring
record, pouring in 232 counters in 12
league games.
And then the tall, good looking
Ilankus signed a $10,000 movie con
tract with Paramount right after
t hat 1938 Cal game. Quite a fabu
lous guy this Hank Luisetti. . . .
Tickets for the Friday night Cal
game are mighty scarce, they tell
me. With 7,200 Stanford students—
and a few hundred thousand Bay
Area basketball enthusiasts—want
ing a look-see at the amazing In
dians, demand exceeds supply.
But since the undersized Pavilion
can only be stretched to handle
2.K00 there are going to be a few
hundred thousand disappointed fans.
That Pavilion just isn't big enough!

Tiie Stanford natators (they don't
like to be called that) travel down
to San Jose today for a swim with
(lie Spartans. Coach Tom Haynie
figures that his boys can shatter just
about every time on the San Jose
pool racing books.
The bangtails are really coming
up in the world. Warren Wright's
Armed picked up .$50,000 last Sat
urday in llialcali's Wide n e r
Statkes, was hustled into a spe
cially constructed, plush airliner
and down to California, where the
pom will lie a red-hot favorite to
pick up a hundred grand in the
big one at Santa Anita come Sat
urday. Keep it quiet, but my two
bucks is riding on Stuart liamh
lin's reconverted work-horse. El
I yobo.

It's just a rumor, but they're say
ing that Jerry Shipkey, the Rose
Bowl UCLAN's hard-plunging back,
is considering transferring to the
Fa I'm. Conference rules would pre
vent him from suiting up in '47—
but he would be eligible for the 15)48
season.
