# Net Tourney In Semifinals
## 
### 
Stanford's semi-official Freshman
Tennis Tournament has advanced to
the semi-final brackets during the
last week of play. Four first year
men survive the gruelling elimina
tion system, which will pare the list
down to a singk person by next
week.
Expert early-season seeding pre
dicted the presence of three of the
four survivors in the semi-finals.
But in the fourth slot, a dark horse
candidate has upset the "dope buc
ket" by fighting his way into con
tention.
Bill Sarnoff, tall Frosh netster,
v/as not expected to survive the early
rounds of the tournament, but his
easy 0-3, (i-4 victory over Jim Lev
oi sen definitely stamps him as a pos
sible winner.
Meanwhile, automatic Errol Ros
enthal stroked his way to an 8-6,
<1-0 win over Swop Tiedeman to
justify his number one seeding post.
Rosenthal is slated to play Ned Mc-
CJanney, seeded number three, who
tillered the semi-finals with a 6-3,
victory over Norm Schwichten
bcrg.
The other bracket of the elimina
tion tournament pits the dark-horse
Sarnoff against number two man
Dick Kilner. Naturally, Kilner will
( liter the match as favorite to slash
his way to the finals, but the con
test should be a bitter one.
