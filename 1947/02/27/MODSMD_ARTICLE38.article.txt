# Farm Seeks Revenge Against Bear Quint
## 
### ART SHAPIRO 
The Indian basketeers will he out lor revenge when they meet the
Berkeley Bears this weekend in the Big Game. Having split their contests
with the conference-leading Uclans and copped the U.S.C. series -1, the
double defeat administered to the Cards by Cal remains the only blemish
on an otherwise successful league record.
The Cardinal quintet has come a long way since that bleak weekend

♦in January when the minions of
Berkeley downed the Indians 47-4(5
! and 48-36. It was an uphill tight to
! overcome the greenness of an inex
' perienced squad, and the results
| have been better than could possi
bly have been expected.
The Bed Machine which gave
promise id' starting in the first Cal
fray and sputtered in the second,
finally caught fire and rolled over
the Broncos of Santa Clara in a
stunning upset, trounced the Tro
jans. and managed to divide the
Bruin series al two all. The squad
has taken on a polish and the type
of ball played by the team at pres
ent is at least 50 per cent better
than it was away back during the
third weekend in January.
The five men who almost stumped
I Cal in the first game with their tight
j zone defense, and fell apart in the
J second because of too much activity
! the preceding night, have added a
potent offensive to the zone, and now
are twice as effective on the floor.
I The team which lost the first Bear
! game due to an inability to hit the
free throws awarded them, went
i through (he second half of last Sat-

urday's UCLA affair missing only
one gratis heave.
California also has come a long
w;iy since the first meeting, but not
in the same direction. They split
the first Uclan series, dropped the
second brace of games and split with
USC last week. They also bit the
dirt as they bowed to Santa Clara
lor the second time, blew one to
St. Mary's, and dropped a thrilling
tilt to the Oakland Bittners.
The last break Cal sprang on
Stanford stalled against UCLA's
scattered attack, backfired against
the methodical play of Santa Clara,
aiyl stopped dead against the set
attack of Southern Cal. All-
American Andy Wolfe has never
come lip to pre-season expecta
tions. and in general the Bear bas
ketball team has played a ragged
type of ball in the past three
weeks.
Chuck Hanger who is tied for sec
ond place in the scoring race with
Indian Steve Stephenson, has been
the only blight spot in a rather gray
Cal hoop year. Tall, rangy, and
armed with a lulu of a hook shot,
Chuck will be the boy to stop if the
Cards aspire to walk off with the
Big Games, and even the season's
matches with Berkeley at two all.

Berkeley downed the Indians 47-4(5
! and 48-36. It was an uphill tight to
! overcome the greenness of an inex
' perienced squad, and the results
| have been better than could possi
bly have been expected.
The Bed Machine which gave
promise id' starting in the first Cal
fray and sputtered in the second,
finally caught fire and rolled over
the Broncos of Santa Clara in a
stunning upset, trounced the Tro
jans. and managed to divide the
Bruin series al two all. The squad
has taken on a polish and the type
of ball played by the team at pres
ent is at least 50 per cent better
than it was away back during the
third weekend in January.
The five men who almost stumped
I Cal in the first game with their tight
j zone defense, and fell apart in the
J second because of too much activity
! the preceding night, have added a
potent offensive to the zone, and now
are twice as effective on the floor.
I The team which lost the first Bear
! game due to an inability to hit the
free throws awarded them, went
i through (he second half of last Sat-

urday's UCLA affair missing only
one gratis heave.
California also has come a long
w;iy since the first meeting, but not
in the same direction. They split
the first Uclan series, dropped the
second brace of games and split with
USC last week. They also bit the
dirt as they bowed to Santa Clara
lor the second time, blew one to
St. Mary's, and dropped a thrilling
tilt to the Oakland Bittners.
The last break Cal sprang on
Stanford stalled against UCLA's
scattered attack, backfired against
the methodical play of Santa Clara,
aiyl stopped dead against the set
attack of Southern Cal. All-
American Andy Wolfe has never
come lip to pre-season expecta
tions. and in general the Bear bas
ketball team has played a ragged
type of ball in the past three
weeks.
Chuck Hanger who is tied for sec
ond place in the scoring race with
Indian Steve Stephenson, has been
the only blight spot in a rather gray
Cal hoop year. Tall, rangy, and
armed with a lulu of a hook shot,
Chuck will be the boy to stop if the
Cards aspire to walk off with the
Big Games, and even the season's
matches with Berkeley at two all.

The Indian basketeers will he out lor revenge when they meet the
Berkeley Bears this weekend in the Big Game. Having split their contests
with the conference-leading Uclans and copped the U.S.C. series -1, the
double defeat administered to the Cards by Cal remains the only blemish
on an otherwise successful league record.
