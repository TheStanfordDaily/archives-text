# Stanford Nine Rallies To 7-4 Win Over Boston
## 
### ART LUBIC 
An explosion heard from here to
j Strawberry Canyon and back shat
tered the tranquil atmosphere on
! campus late yesterday when a de
j termined band of local Indians went
on an eighth inuing rampage to drub
an invading Boston major league
Rookie nine 7-4 on the Stanford dia
-1 mond.
The Stanlords were bumping along
on the short eftd of a 4-0 count when
ihe big eighth rolled around. Then
; Ihe joint started jumping. An eight
I hit barrage coupled with three Bos
ton miscues resulted in seven runs
before the smoke had cleared.
INAUSPICIOUS START
An inauspicious strikeout opened
Ihe frame and then the fireworks
began. Bill Arce pumped a single
into left, Ted Nell followed with
another base knock, and Buck
Brownson came through with a one
bagger that scored Arce. Big Lloyd
Merriman drew a pass to load the
! hassocks and Ward Walkup lined ,
a solid bingle into left scoring Nell j
and Brownson and .bringing the
Cards to within a, run of their ex
perienced foes.
Benny Cardinalli dropped a base
hit into left center, Merriman tally—
j ing, and Walkup crossed the plate
with the eventual winning marker ;
when the relay throw to third went
wild. While the major leaguers were
busy performing in disorderly fash
ion, heaving the spheroid all over
! the diamond, Benny the Card wan- j
dered home with run nufliber six.
KIKCHEK ADDS INSULT
As if that wasn't,enough, A 1 Kir
cher poled out a long double, his
second hit of the afternoon. Then
Paul McCloskey got credit for an
RBI when his Texas Leaguer
I dropped safely to the turf in right
i center, Kireher adding lucky num
j ber seven to the scoreboard.
j The Boston squad, comprising
l promising rookies from the Bay
j Area under the surveillance of Bean
| town scouts, looked every bit like '
| a winning ball club until the mighty I
i atomic charge went off.
j WOLF IN DUEL
Larry Wolf of the locals and Feliz- {
, zato of the invaders matched slants J
for the first three innings with noth- i
ing but gooseggs to show on the 1
j scoreboard.
Dick Flatland and Boston's Fass- j
I holtz took over from there with '
almost Ihe same results. Merriman J
brought the assembled citizenry to j
their feet in the fourth when he 1
j caught a chest-high pitch and drove (
it well over the center-fielder's head '
in deep center, but was thrown out
J by a quick relay to the plate when
he attempted to stretch the triole
i into a home run.
The Beantowners gut to Flatland
in the sixth for their first two runs,
both unearned. Two base hits sand
wiched between a couple of pop-ups
put runners on the base paths and a
1 dropped fly ball allowed both to
! score.
With Dave Stott on the hill in the j
top of the eighth the visiting nine 1
registered two more runs on an in- i
field error and three straight bin
| gles.
FOUR TWIN KILLINGS
The farm lads turned in four dou- i
j ble plays during the course of the
! afternoon, three of them started by
■ hustling Bill Arce at third base.
Marked improvement in the field
| and at bat stamp the Cards as a team |
j to watch in California Intercollegi- '
; ate Baseball Conference play this |
! year.
The University of San Francisco j
i opens intercollegiate competition for
j the locals Saturday afternoon on the
Stanford diamond and from then on
Ihe going will be rough for the
Roughs with a heavy college program
running straight through till the
final scheduled game with Cal on
May 31.
