### 
NEW YORK. Feb. 2(5 (UP).-The
, National Foundation for Infantile
' Paralysis said today that research
scientists at the University of Min
! nesota Hospital have made a dis
covery which fives' the first clue to
i chemical changes occurring in acute
infantile paralysis attacks.
Dr. Cecil J. Watson and his asso
j dates, the foundation said, have dis
covered that a mysterious chemical
| compound called porphyrin exists
i in the urine of polio victims.
The specific porphyrin found is
termed corpopoi phyrin, type 3.
Porphyrins, the foundation said, are
chemical substances associated with
j enzymes, the body elements which
play a part in the metabolism of
body cells.
"The presence* of porphyrin in
â€¢ small amounts may be detected in
j the urine of normal persons," the
report said, "but they have been
observed in abnormally large quan
tities in certain diseases, mainly
those attacking the central nervous
; system."
The foundation said that Dr.
i Maurice B. Bisscher, chairman of
Minnesota's Department, of Physi
! ology, described the discovery as the
"most significant observations on al
i tered biochemistry in poliomyelitis
I that ever have been made."
