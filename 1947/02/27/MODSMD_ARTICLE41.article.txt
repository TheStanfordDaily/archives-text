BARTLESVILLE. Okia.. Feb. 25
(UP).â€”Bartlesville blazed to a 36-
32 revenge victory over Oakland
here tonight to virtually clinch the
American Basketball League cham
pionships.
The Oklahomans, defending cham
pions in the league, had things pret
ty well in hand except for an Oak
land rush in the third period.
Bartlesville jumped to an 8-3
lead in the slim-scoring first per
iod. and held a 20-15 half-time edge.
Oakland got hot in the third per
iod. with Paul Napolitano, Gordon
Carpenter and Bob Livingstone lead
ing the way. The California troupe
tied the score twice in that period
before going into a 28-26 lead.
But Bartlesville, with big Bob
Kurland showing the way, bounced
back hard. The Oklahomans forged
back into the front position early in
the fourth period and then stayed
there despite heavy Oakland push
ing. The Californians managed to
tie the score twice again, but never
resumed the lead.
Kurland was high scorer for the
evening with 18 points, including six
field goals and six free throws. His
performance at the post was a stand
out, even though the goal which gave
Oakland the third-period lead was
his work.
