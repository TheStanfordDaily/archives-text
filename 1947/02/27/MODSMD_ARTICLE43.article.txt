team.
VARSITY STRENGTHENED
The Stanford varsity wiil be
strengthened by the return of Cap
tain Key Rule, Dick Narver and Em
Cashin, all of whom missed the
Olympic Club meet because of sick
ness. All three will add strength to
the distance events, which were
proven weak last week when the
Olympians captured 16 out of the 18
possible points.
Cashin and Narver will not con
tinue on with the team when Cap
tain Rule leads the remaining 11

victories 15, 16, and 17, to add to
their consecutive dual meet string,
which numbers back to three sea

lead the Indians on to Pasadena for
a setto with the Pasadena Athletic
Club, and on Saturday they will
move to La Jolla for a meet at the

ing used to watch the relay-men's
performance to get dope for future
meets and possibly for the national
championships, to be held in Seattle

Cashin, Tug Neville and Bob An

WINNING RELAY MARK
