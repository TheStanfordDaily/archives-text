Current food prices in the wholesale markets are
rising sharply. Government sources predict, indeed,
that the cost of living will reach an all-time high in
the next four months. Already the cost of living is
roughly 30 per cent higher than it was twelve months
;igo, although it fell about one per cent in December.
And a Senate sub-committee has recommended a 10
per cent increase in rent ceilings, with all rent ceil
ings off of new construction.
When price ceilings were removed last summer, it
was widely predicted that, after a brief period of ad
justment, production would have so increased that
prices have begun to fall. As an abstract statement,
that, may be sound. But the phrase "a brief period of
adjustment" is as much a part of it as is the "in
creased production-decreased prices" clause. And
there is a necessary qualification, too, that nothing
else interfere with productive processes. Now it
turns out that what is meant by "a brief period of
adjustment" is a sharp rise in prices. If rent ceilings
are removed and or relaxed, an "adjustment pro
cess" will begin there, too.
Actually, the increased commodity prices in the
Chicago markets (which will hit the household bud
get soon) are the result in part, of seasonal short
ages. Across the mountains, it's still winter.
Let us, however, return to consideration of this
adjustment process. It would appear that well-known
behaviour pattern that the economists have canon
ized as the law of supply and demand is at the bot
tom of it all. Without going into details (partly
because I'm not sure that I'm qualified to go into de
tails) it should be enough to point out that this
adjustment mechanism is not just something that
reigns and has power from last summer, when price
controls were removed, to next June when prices
reach a peak. It is a characteristic of our "free enter
prise" or capitalistic system that we are forever

going through a period of adjustment. Ideally, I
suppose, some sort of balance might be attained, but
I doubt if it ever has been attained. There is a con
tinual slipping and sliding, up and down, which dif
fers only in degree from the extreme situation de
scribed by the phrase "boom and bust."
Tliis adjustment may not of course be always
painful. Sometimes it is in your individual favor and
sometimes not. The popular prediction at the mo
ment is that prices will start to slip this summer, and
that this "adjustment" will be a "healthy" one; one.
that is, that will, it Is hoped, help John Q. Public as
a consumer, without hurting him as a producer.
The alternative to a perpetual series of adjustments
is some sort of planning, rather detailed and thor
oughly implemented planning, I am afraid. Those
who oppose a planned economy argue either that
these fluctuations, in the long run and taken with all
the other characteristics of a laissez-faire economic
system, have a net result that is socially desirable, or
that by making allowance for these cycles, by rolling
with the punch, by trying to cushion the drop and
skim the cream at the top, or something like that, we
achieve a net beneficial result. This latter view in
volves some government intervention and could be
tagged "New Deal."
What does all this mean? Well, one thing it does
not mean is that I favor the "brave new world" of a
planned society. And it may serve as a little cold
comfort to those who are squeezed by any of these
"adjustments." Some criticism of the use of cer
tain popular but (or because) euphemistic phrases
may be implied. But the principal point, I guess, is to
make olear that our system, such as it is, has some
faults. Those who want the benefits of what is cur
rently known as free enterprise would do well to
recognize this, and be prepared to solve its problems
or suffer its perils.

going through a period of adjustment. Ideally, I
suppose, some sort of balance might be attained, but
I doubt if it ever has been attained. There is a con
tinual slipping and sliding, up and down, which dif
fers only in degree from the extreme situation de
scribed by the phrase "boom and bust."
Tliis adjustment may not of course be always
painful. Sometimes it is in your individual favor and
sometimes not. The popular prediction at the mo
ment is that prices will start to slip this summer, and
that this "adjustment" will be a "healthy" one; one.
that is, that will, it Is hoped, help John Q. Public as
a consumer, without hurting him as a producer.
The alternative to a perpetual series of adjustments
is some sort of planning, rather detailed and thor
oughly implemented planning, I am afraid. Those
who oppose a planned economy argue either that
these fluctuations, in the long run and taken with all
the other characteristics of a laissez-faire economic
system, have a net result that is socially desirable, or
that by making allowance for these cycles, by rolling
with the punch, by trying to cushion the drop and
skim the cream at the top, or something like that, we
achieve a net beneficial result. This latter view in
volves some government intervention and could be
tagged "New Deal."
What does all this mean? Well, one thing it does
not mean is that I favor the "brave new world" of a
planned society. And it may serve as a little cold
comfort to those who are squeezed by any of these
"adjustments." Some criticism of the use of cer
tain popular but (or because) euphemistic phrases
may be implied. But the principal point, I guess, is to
make olear that our system, such as it is, has some
faults. Those who want the benefits of what is cur
rently known as free enterprise would do well to
recognize this, and be prepared to solve its problems
or suffer its perils.
Current food prices in the wholesale markets are
rising sharply. Government sources predict, indeed,
that the cost of living will reach an all-time high in
the next four months. Already the cost of living is
roughly 30 per cent higher than it was twelve months
;igo, although it fell about one per cent in December.
And a Senate sub-committee has recommended a 10
per cent increase in rent ceilings, with all rent ceil
ings off of new construction.
When price ceilings were removed last summer, it
was widely predicted that, after a brief period of ad
justment, production would have so increased that
prices have begun to fall. As an abstract statement,
that, may be sound. But the phrase "a brief period of
adjustment" is as much a part of it as is the "in
creased production-decreased prices" clause. And
there is a necessary qualification, too, that nothing
else interfere with productive processes. Now it
turns out that what is meant by "a brief period of
adjustment" is a sharp rise in prices. If rent ceilings
are removed and or relaxed, an "adjustment pro
cess" will begin there, too.
Actually, the increased commodity prices in the
Chicago markets (which will hit the household bud
get soon) are the result in part, of seasonal short
ages. Across the mountains, it's still winter.
Let us, however, return to consideration of this
adjustment process. It would appear that well-known
behaviour pattern that the economists have canon
ized as the law of supply and demand is at the bot
tom of it all. Without going into details (partly
because I'm not sure that I'm qualified to go into de
tails) it should be enough to point out that this
adjustment mechanism is not just something that
reigns and has power from last summer, when price
controls were removed, to next June when prices
reach a peak. It is a characteristic of our "free enter
prise" or capitalistic system that we are forever

going through a period of adjustment. Ideally, I
