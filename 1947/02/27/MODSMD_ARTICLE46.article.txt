### CARL HEINTZE 
Here are a couple of stories which are being noised
around these days. I can't say how true they are.
Draw your own conclusions.

It seems there is a guy over in the Village who
made a date with his girl to go to a local dance. They
had been going out together for a couple of months,
and the girl figured the guy was really interested in
her.
The day of the dance they agreed on a time to meet.
8 o'clock, and parted to get ready for the shin-dig.
On the way back to the Village, the boy runs into a
couple of buddies. One thing leads to another, and
they end up at Belt's sipping the nut-brown grape
juice. Before he knows it, the boy has chug-a-lugged
for a couple of hours, and finds that the garlic sau
sage doesn't even smell anymore, so he heads home
for the Village.
He vaguely remembers something about the dance,
but when he gets back to the room, the bed looks so
good that he lays down and —ah, goes to sleep.
About one o'clock in the morning he suddenly
wakes up, and remembers that he has a date with the
girl. Hurriedly he phones her up. and tells her that
he is still hot to go out with her.
The clincher is that the girl makes a date with him
for the dance coming up the next week.

This one concerns a certain campus woman.
She is driving back from Palo Alto after doing
some shopping in town, when she sees two men
standing on the Roos Brothers' corner waiting for
the traditional ride back to the Quad. So she stops
and picks them up like a patriotic Stanford woman
always does.

The lads are naturally grateful and in order to
break the ice sort of, they indulge in a little con
versation with the woman. It seems that they have
just pulled off a coup. They have spirited a couple
of chairs out of the lobby of one of the women's
halls, and have taken them up to their room because
they don't like the hard stools they are now sitting
on.
The woman listens with a great deal of interest
to the story, and laughs with them. Or maybe at
them is a better way of saying it. The woman hap
pens to be a resident in the hall they have swiped
the chairs from.
The chairs are now back in the lobby.
«»< «jt >:«
The last one is the result of all these exchange
dinners that have been going on lately.
It seems that in one of the eating clubs, this is
rapidly developing into a tradition. Before the men
start off for the hall where they arc to pick up the
women and bring them over to eat, they all set to
gether. Each man kicks in with a quarter, and a pot
is made.
Then they go pick up their dates and go to dinner.
After the dinner is over and they have taken the
girls back home again, they all meet again, and the
man who got the worst looking girl gets the pile of
25 cent pieces.
But the other night the boys had a bad time.
They had an exchange dinner with one of the girls'
halls, and they claim that everybody wanted to grab
the money.
I don't know. Maybe it's true.

the money.
I don't know. Maybe it's true.
Here are a couple of stories which are being noised
around these days. I can't say how true they are.
Draw your own conclusions.

It seems there is a guy over in the Village who
made a date with his girl to go to a local dance. They
had been going out together for a couple of months,
and the girl figured the guy was really interested in
her.
The day of the dance they agreed on a time to meet.
8 o'clock, and parted to get ready for the shin-dig.
On the way back to the Village, the boy runs into a
couple of buddies. One thing leads to another, and
they end up at Belt's sipping the nut-brown grape
juice. Before he knows it, the boy has chug-a-lugged
for a couple of hours, and finds that the garlic sau
sage doesn't even smell anymore, so he heads home
for the Village.
He vaguely remembers something about the dance,
but when he gets back to the room, the bed looks so
good that he lays down and —ah, goes to sleep.
About one o'clock in the morning he suddenly
wakes up, and remembers that he has a date with the
girl. Hurriedly he phones her up. and tells her that
he is still hot to go out with her.
The clincher is that the girl makes a date with him
for the dance coming up the next week.

This one concerns a certain campus woman.
She is driving back from Palo Alto after doing
some shopping in town, when she sees two men
standing on the Roos Brothers' corner waiting for
the traditional ride back to the Quad. So she stops
and picks them up like a patriotic Stanford woman
always does.

The lads are naturally grateful and in order to
break the ice sort of, they indulge in a little con
versation with the woman. It seems that they have
just pulled off a coup. They have spirited a couple
of chairs out of the lobby of one of the women's
halls, and have taken them up to their room because
they don't like the hard stools they are now sitting
on.
The woman listens with a great deal of interest
to the story, and laughs with them. Or maybe at
them is a better way of saying it. The woman hap
pens to be a resident in the hall they have swiped
the chairs from.
The chairs are now back in the lobby.
«»< «jt >:«
The last one is the result of all these exchange
dinners that have been going on lately.
It seems that in one of the eating clubs, this is
rapidly developing into a tradition. Before the men
start off for the hall where they arc to pick up the
women and bring them over to eat, they all set to
gether. Each man kicks in with a quarter, and a pot
is made.
Then they go pick up their dates and go to dinner.
After the dinner is over and they have taken the
girls back home again, they all meet again, and the
man who got the worst looking girl gets the pile of
25 cent pieces.
But the other night the boys had a bad time.
They had an exchange dinner with one of the girls'
halls, and they claim that everybody wanted to grab
the money.
I don't know. Maybe it's true.
