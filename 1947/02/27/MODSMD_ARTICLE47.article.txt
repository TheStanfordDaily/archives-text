# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
To the Editor:
The Stanford Daily of Feb. 18 contained a letter
purporting to explain (he widespread apathy toward
University activities and an editorial resolving the
conflict with a platitude: "Maturity carries a re
sponsibility."
It would appear that the two distinct elements
in the present student body suggested in the letter
do exist; that "a fine line of distinction must be drawn
between activities which have a strong effect on the
trend of American government and society, and those
which have little or no real effect," as suggested in
the editorial is valid too. lam of the opinion, how
ever, that testing "the degree of maturity" or the
inclination to use that maturity for the general im
provement of society on the basis of the amount of
enthusiasm displayed by either group in support of
Sadie Hawkins Day.the election of cheer leaders, at
all, is rather unfair.
The burning of John Walker's house in Redwood
City affords a more adequate and certainly a more
deserving criterion for judging the two groups. Here
is a concrete opportunity for action of the real sort
required of the mature citizen. Although some cam
pus organizations have expressed concern over the
incident, it would appear that this violent outburst
of racial prejudice and injustice is deserving of the
attention of the entire student body, and indeed of
action on the part of all of us.
1 consider the John Walker case an appropriate
example of the kind of issue with which we should
all be concerned as citizens of a community, be we
perennial sophomore, mature veteran of the student
body, Excom, faculty, corporation yard, or admin
istration. Here is a genuine problem: a challenge to
yesterday's generations and to tomorrow's; an oppor
tunity for a spontaneous effort on the part of all of
us for important action on a concrete, mature level.

ber ot writer. There is no limit on words but
it is desirable they be short and to the point.J

as a symbol of our generation's meeting problems of
the community intelligently and together with posi
tive action.

To the Editor:
It. is against my better judgment that I throw my
two cents in on this matter of "why the vet doesn't
take an interest in student government," but what
do I have to lose?
There exists a group that claims that, as vets, it
is too mature for this type of "torn-foolery." The
editor, in turn, answers that in looking at some of
our city councils he doesn't see much more matu
rity than is found in Excom's actions.
Might I suggest that the real crux of the prob
lem does not lie in the fact that vets are too mature
to be interested in government activities, but rather
that they are too mature to take an interest in futile
government.
To make myself clearer, let's look at the func
tions of Excom. Does it actually have any policy
making functions that bear any weight in the ad
ministration of the University? Anything of real
importance is handled "up at the front office" and
little student officers had better keep away or get
spanked.
This isn't pointed out to cast reflections against
student officers or the administration. Alter all.
this school, university that it is, is a privately run
organization and its policies can't be dictated by a
group of students who are not imbued with the
necessary abilities to govern such policies.
So let's call a spade a spade, and say that many
students on campus, not only vets, don't desire to
devote their time to walking up paths that lead no
where.
Now having had my say I shall crawl quietly
back into my shell.

lem does not lie in the fact that vets are too mature
to be interested in government activities, but rather
that they are too mature to take an interest in futile
government.
To make myself clearer, let's look at the func
tions of Excom. Does it actually have any policy
making functions that bear any weight in the ad
ministration of the University? Anything of real
importance is handled "up at the front office" and
little student officers had better keep away or get
spanked.
This isn't pointed out to cast reflections against
student officers or the administration. Alter all.
this school, university that it is, is a privately run
organization and its policies can't be dictated by a
group of students who are not imbued with the
necessary abilities to govern such policies.
So let's call a spade a spade, and say that many
students on campus, not only vets, don't desire to
devote their time to walking up paths that lead no
where.
Now having had my say I shall crawl quietly
back into my shell.

To the Editor:
The Stanford Daily of Feb. 18 contained a letter
purporting to explain (he widespread apathy toward
University activities and an editorial resolving the
conflict with a platitude: "Maturity carries a re
sponsibility."
It would appear that the two distinct elements
in the present student body suggested in the letter
do exist; that "a fine line of distinction must be drawn
between activities which have a strong effect on the
trend of American government and society, and those
which have little or no real effect," as suggested in
the editorial is valid too. lam of the opinion, how
ever, that testing "the degree of maturity" or the
inclination to use that maturity for the general im
provement of society on the basis of the amount of
enthusiasm displayed by either group in support of
Sadie Hawkins Day.the election of cheer leaders, at
all, is rather unfair.
The burning of John Walker's house in Redwood
City affords a more adequate and certainly a more
deserving criterion for judging the two groups. Here
is a concrete opportunity for action of the real sort
required of the mature citizen. Although some cam
pus organizations have expressed concern over the
incident, it would appear that this violent outburst
of racial prejudice and injustice is deserving of the
attention of the entire student body, and indeed of
action on the part of all of us.
1 consider the John Walker case an appropriate
example of the kind of issue with which we should
all be concerned as citizens of a community, be we
perennial sophomore, mature veteran of the student
body, Excom, faculty, corporation yard, or admin
istration. Here is a genuine problem: a challenge to
yesterday's generations and to tomorrow's; an oppor
tunity for a spontaneous effort on the part of all of
us for important action on a concrete, mature level.
IjH all of Stanford contribute to helping John Walker

(All letters should he addressed to the editor,
signed and contain address and phone num
ber ot writer. There is no limit on words but
it is desirable they be short and to the point.J

as a symbol of our generation's meeting problems of
the community intelligently and together with posi
tive action.

It. is against my better judgment that I throw my
two cents in on this matter of "why the vet doesn't
take an interest in student government," but what
do I have to lose?
There exists a group that claims that, as vets, it
is too mature for this type of "torn-foolery." The
editor, in turn, answers that in looking at some of
our city councils he doesn't see much more matu
rity than is found in Excom's actions.
