# 'Dry' Lake Causes Concern; Canoes May Have Wheels Yet
## 
### MARJORIE SAMPSON 
Lagunita girls are planning to put wheels on their canoes if the lake
doesn't fill up soon, because, if previous years are any standard, there
isn't much hope of. having a full lake this spring.
Always in the past, if the lake was going to hold its capacity of 11H
million gallons, it would have done so by the end of February. In both

1934 and 1939 the lake couldn't be'
used spring quarter, because of the
lack of rainfall during the winter.
In 1944 the lake didn't fill complete
ly, missing the top by about half a
foot.

Right now the lake contains about
four feet of water, approximately 10
million gallons. That is just 108
million gallons short. The lake is
Hi feet deep at the outlet when the
lake is holding its capacity.
DRY WINTER REASON
The reason behind the dry lake
is a relatively dry winter. There
has been only 8.34 inches of rain
this winter, as compared to an av
erage of 15 inches.
About 12 feet of water, or 70 mil
lion gallons, would be enough to
keep the floats afloat for a short
time.
And don't pin your hopes on
Searsville Lake. It normally holds
265 million gallons, and right now
it has 185 million gallons. Lagunita
doesn't get overflow until Sears
ville is full.
BIG RAINFALL WILL HELP
If there is a big rainfall within
the next few days, there is a chance
that Stanfordites will be able to use
the lake, but the flume will carry
only 10 million gallons a day. When
the lake gets partially full, the flume
loses two million of its 10-million
gallon daily capacity.
The last few rains have been so
small and so short that the ground
would just saturate and there would
be no run-off.
The only solution is to have a
heavy storm for the nex< week or
two. The lake needs only 108 mil
lion gallons more of water, or ap
proximately 12 feet.
