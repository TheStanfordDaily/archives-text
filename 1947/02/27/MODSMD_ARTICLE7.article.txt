# Krug Proposes Pacific Island Civilian Rule

### 
HONOLULU. T. H., Feb. 2G (UP).
â€”Secretary of Interior Julius Krug
said today he would urge that the
shift from military to civilian ad
ministration of Guam and other
Pacific islands be made as soon as
possible.
Speaking at a press conference up
on his return from an extensive tour
of Japan and the Pacific, Krug said
he believed the navy was doing an
excellent job of administration in
the islands, but added that he felt
the present setup did not fit in with
America's basic principle of self
government.
He said he found in Guam thai the
lack of redress or appeal from Navy
administration decisions was build
ing up a feeling of persecution in the
minds of Guamaninns and American
civilian workers, even though the
Navy strives for fairness in all
cases.
Krug pointed out that the change
from military to civilian adminis
tration would necessarily take time
as the move involves congressional
enactment of government charters
for the islands and selection of civil
administration agencies.
Meanwhile, he said, he was con
vinced the United States could work
out a meshing of services to give
individual Pacific islanders a good
portion of their civilian rights.
He said many practical problems
in the path of civilian administration
would be solved if the Navy v/ould
continue some of its present services
such as transport, communications
and health. He pointed ou' that such
services were successfully handled
in Alaska by the Army in coopera
tion with civilian authorities.
