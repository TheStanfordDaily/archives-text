# Curds Battle Cal in Finale
## 
### ART SHAPIRO 
Stanford's Indians, the team that
didn't have a chance, squares off
against the Cal hoopsters tonight in
the Pavilion, still holding on to a
mathematical chance at the con
ference crown. Saturday evening
the action shifts to Berkeley for the
season's finals, and perhaps the most
important conference clash of the
year.
A double victory for Stanford
coupled with twin defeats for the
league-leading Uclans, and the In
dians will slip into a tie for first
place. Should Cal rise up and flown
the Cards in both games and U.S.C.
puli the superman trick on U.C.L.A.,
the Boars would walk away with
the laurels. A single victory for the
Wcstwooders seals the door against
a Stanford or Cal entry in the con
ference grab bag.
A double victory for the Indians
would also push the varsity's season
record over the .500 mark, as well
as bring up tha conference record
to seven won against five lost. The
team which Sports Editor Paul Laz
arus of the Daily California?! con
fined to the cellar position in the
conference race may yet. make that
esteemed gentleman eat his belli
cose words.,
The Cards will not finish "Low
Men on the Totem Pole," hut they
arc in an excellent position to i
drive the well-spoken-for Bears :
down to the third slot in a four
team race. A repetition of last j
Saturday's style of play should he
too much for the Bears to stom- [
arh and should prove sufficient to j
the task of dropping the Blue and
(â€¢old one step removed from the
cellar.
The California quintet which will
test the Indians over the weekend j
boasts of much experience and little |
success. The one bright spot on
the year's record was the twin lac- i
ing administered to Stanford early !
in the season.
The starting lineup for the Boys
from Berkeley will be the same as
it was that third weekend in Janu
ary. Chuck Hanger, the 6-foot-6 j
center, will be working the pivot j
spot, with Andy Wolfe and Jack j
Rocker holding down the forward I
slots, and Bob Hogeboom and Bill '
Durkee at guard.
Chuck Hanger, the high-scoring
center, was held in check during
the last meeting of the two teams,
and was outscorcd by Bill Ste- j
phenson, hut .kick Rocker broke
loose with a flurry of two-point
ers which broke the hack of the
Indian five. Andy Wolfe, All- |
Coast last year, a tricky hall
handler and fine shot, hasn't come
up to pre-scason estimates, but |
always packs a potential wallop in j
his left-hand jump shot. In the
second clash Wolfe crossed into
(he keyhole spot and wreaked j
havoc with the Stanford /one de- j
fense.
The rest of the starting live, Dur
kee and Hogeboom, are capable
guard position is one of the clas
bchintl them. Durkee has a good i
eye and used it to advantage against I
Stanford in their first clashes. Hoge
boom is captain of the squad and
implements Andy Wolfe setting up
the plays and acts as the steadying
influence on the court.
Once again Coach Everett Dean
will start the same five men against
California. Morley Thompson and ;
Dave Davidson up front. Stephen
son at pivot, and Babe Higgins and :
Dick Berlin providing the protec- j
tion. Morley came through in the
second half of the Saturday U.C.-
L.A. game, pouring through 18
counters, and is the number one
Card scoring threat of late. David
son. who has been bothered with a
t tick ankle, burned fingers, and a
sore throat throughout the season,
has thrown off all of his ailments
and should be in top physical con
dition for this Big Game series.
