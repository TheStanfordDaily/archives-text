# Mumford Envisions Streamlined Farm
## 
### 
Complete revamping of the cam
pus road plan, concentration of
the University buildings in a com
pact urban group, and a distinct
change in lho architecture of
buildings lo combine the old with
the new—these are the recommen
dations offered for Stanford's fu
ture planning by Ix'wis Mumford,
former professor of Humanities
here.
Dr. Mumford, an internationally
known planner and architectural
critic, visited Stanford last week to
review the University's long-range
planning studies.
Emphasizing compactness, con
centration, and unity as the watch
words for planning, Dr. Mumford
suggested in his preliminary report
a plan for land housing to cncompass
the neigh bo rhaiod unit principle,
and to modernize and restore all of
the buildings of Inner Quad for their
fullest use.
He said that the original con
ception of the University and its
Surroundings was the work of the
most mature and effective mind
America has so far produced in
city planning and landscape de
sign. (He was referring to Fred
erick Olmsted, the original Quad
rangle architect). ,
The revamped road system would,
according to Dr. Mumford, create a
unified University area, free from
the invasion of traffic, in order to
give maximum use to the- campus
functions. It. would greatly
help in the concentration of the Uni
versity buildings into the proposed
compact grouping.
REVAMPED ROAD SYSTEM
This system would t>ive access to
every part of the University with
out the disturbance of unnecessary
through-traffic by diverting and re
routing the main road around the
campus, passing around the far side
of Lagunita Court and bordering the
Lake.
As a result of planning this wider
cifcuit, all present and future uni
versity buildings, including dormi
tories—with the exception of Bran
ner and Toy on Halls will form a
unified area, unbroken by any
traffic area.
When the new road system and
parking areas have been built., the
use of Serra street (running in front
of Encina and the Hoover Library)
would be blocked off except for spe
cial occasions. Dr. Mumford also ad
vised eventually there be a limited
amount of underground parking
space provided in the inner area on
the East side of the Quad.
TIE-IN WITH OLD
In his plans for architectural
change, Dr. Mumford stressed heavy
masonry used in the construction of
the original buildings is prohibitive
in cost for future building, and makes
further alterations to meet new needs
both expensive and unsatisfactory.
Rather than emphasis on the
construction, the architectural tie
in between the new ami the old
buildings should he made with
respect to height and scale with
the use of covered walks and ar
cades as a connecting thread be
tween the individual buildings.
"By using the arcades as a free
standing spine and designing the
buildings in repetitious units at an
angle to the arcade, an effective open
plan can be created which will give
a maximum of light, accessibility
and space for extension," he said in
the report.
EFFICIENCY ON QUAD
Dr. Mumford also advocated a
complete restoration of the buildings
of Inner Quad to efficient use by
the installation of modern methods
of lighting and, where necessary,
air conditioning, following the lines
already achieved in the remodeled
offices of the President.
In restoration, be said, there is
a great need for smaller classrooms
and be suggested the possibility of
building soundproof folding par
titions permitting change from
small classroom to one of double
size.
Combination of seminar room and
professorial office by a similar par
tition could form a single unit, un
der this plan, with outside access
for the office.

advisory capacity with Director of
Planning Eldridge T» Spencer, a
former San Francisco architect, on

will be. supplemented in several

the University plan.

ture planning by Ix'wis Mumford,
former professor of Humanities
here.
Dr. Mumford, an internationally
known planner and architectural
critic, visited Stanford last week to
review the University's long-range
planning studies.
Emphasizing compactness, con
centration, and unity as the watch
words for planning, Dr. Mumford
suggested in his preliminary report
a plan for land housing to cncompass
the neigh bo rhaiod unit principle,
and to modernize and restore all of
the buildings of Inner Quad for their
fullest use.
He said that the original con
ception of the University and its
Surroundings was the work of the
most mature and effective mind
America has so far produced in
city planning and landscape de
sign. (He was referring to Fred
erick Olmsted, the original Quad
rangle architect). ,
The revamped road system would,
according to Dr. Mumford, create a
unified University area, free from
the invasion of traffic, in order to
give maximum use to the- campus
functions. It. would greatly
help in the concentration of the Uni
versity buildings into the proposed
compact grouping.
REVAMPED ROAD SYSTEM
This system would t>ive access to
every part of the University with
out the disturbance of unnecessary
through-traffic by diverting and re
routing the main road around the
campus, passing around the far side
of Lagunita Court and bordering the
Lake.
As a result of planning this wider
cifcuit, all present and future uni
versity buildings, including dormi
tories—with the exception of Bran
ner and Toy on Halls will form a
unified area, unbroken by any
traffic area.
When the new road system and
parking areas have been built., the
use of Serra street (running in front
of Encina and the Hoover Library)
would be blocked off except for spe
cial occasions. Dr. Mumford also ad
vised eventually there be a limited
amount of underground parking
space provided in the inner area on
the East side of the Quad.
TIE-IN WITH OLD
In his plans for architectural
change, Dr. Mumford stressed heavy
masonry used in the construction of
the original buildings is prohibitive
in cost for future building, and makes
further alterations to meet new needs
both expensive and unsatisfactory.
Rather than emphasis on the
construction, the architectural tie
in between the new ami the old
buildings should he made with
respect to height and scale with
the use of covered walks and ar
cades as a connecting thread be
tween the individual buildings.
"By using the arcades as a free
standing spine and designing the
buildings in repetitious units at an
angle to the arcade, an effective open
plan can be created which will give
a maximum of light, accessibility
and space for extension," he said in
the report.
EFFICIENCY ON QUAD
Dr. Mumford also advocated a
complete restoration of the buildings
of Inner Quad to efficient use by
the installation of modern methods
of lighting and, where necessary,
air conditioning, following the lines
already achieved in the remodeled
offices of the President.
In restoration, be said, there is
a great need for smaller classrooms
and be suggested the possibility of
building soundproof folding par
titions permitting change from
small classroom to one of double
size.
Combination of seminar room and
professorial office by a similar par
tition could form a single unit, un
der this plan, with outside access
for the office.
ADVISORY CAPACITY
Dr. Mumford was here working in
advisory capacity with Director of
Planning Eldridge T» Spencer, a
former San Francisco architect, on
the long-range plan of the Univer
sity. Mumford's preliminary report
will be. supplemented in several
months by a more detailed study of
the University plan.
Complete revamping of the cam
pus road plan, concentration of
the University buildings in a com
pact urban group, and a distinct
change in lho architecture of
buildings lo combine the old with
the new—these are the recommen
dations offered for Stanford's fu
