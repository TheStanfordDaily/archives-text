# Red Cross Short of Drive Goal
## 
### 
Only $1,229.21, or less than one
half of the $3,000 Red Cross goal,
had been collected by 5 p.m. yes
terday, according to Ann Lillcn
thai, treasurer of the drive.
Today is the last day that living j
groups may contribute, and Miss 1
Lilienthal urged all corridor and 1
house representatives to turn in j
their results immediately. Miss Li 1- j
ienthal will be in the Excom room ;
from 1 to 4 p.m. today to receive :
final tabulations,
Barbara Allen, chairman of the |
drive, expressed extreme dissatis
faction with the contributions of
fraternities and men in living
groups.
"Out of 24 fraternities, only six j
have turned in any results at all," j
she remarked. "Five of the six went '
practically 100 per cent."
Miss Allen reported she has re
ceived no contributions at all from
either Toyon or Encina, nor has
she heard from Eucalypto, Olivo, j
the Oaks, and Elm.
"I cannot understand why the con- I
tribution from the men is so low.
Perhaps they have just neglected j
to hand in their returns," Miss Allen
remarked.
One hundred per cent contribu
tors include Russell, Thcta Chi.
Kappa Alpha, Delta Tau Delta,
Phi Kappa Sigma, Village 21(Â». Vil
lage 11!*, Lathrop. and One-West
of Branner.
Miss Allen stated that Ihe booths i
in front of the Cellar and on the His- !
to'ry corner will be open next Mon- !
day, Tuesday and Wednesday for j
those who were "caught short" at !
the end of the month and wish to
wait until the beginning of March
to contribute.
"However," she emphasized, "the j
drive officially closes today, so please
join the Red Cross without delay.' !


THESE KA(i(<K|) LITTLE VICTIMS OF WAR in Mcgcve, Francc. need American aid. Their empty
howls should he filled; they need new clothing. Chapter workers can help by producing garments in Red
Cross workrooms, and hy saving wheat, fats, and oils in their homes. Stanford students can aid them by
contributing during the present drive.
