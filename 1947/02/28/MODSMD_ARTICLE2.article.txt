Rooters arc requested to remain in the stands after tonight's and to
morrow night's games for the singing of the Alma Mater, according to
Jack Davis, head cheer leader.
For the benefit of many new students, the words to the hymn follow:
Where the rolling foothills rise.
Up toward mountains higher—
Where at eve the coast range lies,
In the sunset's lire—
Flushing deep and paling
Here we raise our voiccs hailing
Thee our Alma Mater.
It shall ring, as we sing.
It shall ring and float away—
lIAIL STANFORD HAIL!
Hail Stanford Hail!
