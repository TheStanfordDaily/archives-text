# Hovis Lists Russian Aims

### RALPH HOVIS 
John Foster Dulles, foreign policy
ndvi.-or to prominent Republicans, |
recently warned us, "the year 1947 j
must witness an extension of United
States foreign policy if that policy is I
to succeed in the face of Russia's |
"double - barreled" challenge — na- |
tionalistie expansion and social rev- [
ohition throughout the world."
Mr. Dulles suggested the year 1946 !
li id witnessed a curbing, at least a I
temporary one, of one of those chal
lenges nationalistic expansion. I
I' .- ia had halted troop movements
at cert; in points and the United J
StaW s had defined certain areas as I
boundaries beyond which Soviet!
i x'pansiun would be considered as |
aggression. •
But the other barrel—the ideo
logical one- was still loaded and i
aimed. "'ln most of the world," '
I)li lie; said, "effective popular lead
ei> hip 'rested with those in sympa- i
thy lo Soviet Communist doctrines. '
I evolutionary movements in China, I
I at in America, France, Italy, and in j
certain colonies gave Communists
tea on to .*eniember 1: 46 joyfully."
1 111 CHALLENGE
What really bothered Mr. Dulles j
v as "other countries are frightened I
by the unruly aspect we present and |
they suspect us of a certain moral |
arid intellectual bankruptcy. They
are attracted by the apparent j
moodiness and efficiency of a so- j
ciely where conformity is the rule !
and where all men walk in step. I
That is why Soviet Communism can j
•eriously .challenge us for world .
leadership." His conclusion? "The;
time' has come when we shall have >
lo put up or shut up."
TiioiU'h we may disagree with Mr. |
Dulles' analysis of our world prob- ;
len let us follow up his conclusion ,
by outlining a few suggestions made j
by national leaders for "getting!
along with Russia."
What can we do? At the outset
we ni'i ht rule out the extreme ap
proaches. The Daily Worker and j
lel low-travelers on the extreme Lett i
would have us follow the Moscow {
party line. The Hearst-McCormick- j
Gannet-Patterson alliance on the !
extreme Right w6uld have us drop
j1 few bombs on Russia to put an
end to Russian influence in the j
world. Between the two extremes
there are some things we might at- j
tempt to do and still live in peace !
with Russia.
SELF-CONDUCT RULES
Suggestions for self-conduct on j
the part of our leaders in meeting
the Soviet challenge might include: j
1. Attempting to determine the
extent of Western influences on j
Lenin's original conception of a So- {
vi<-1, state.
2. Attempting to discover what, if ■
any, influence on Soviet practice has j
resulted from contact with Western ;
peoples by Red armies in the past
few years.
3. Attempting to weed out some of
our original ideas that have bounc- j
ed back to us from Russia. Planning
for specific social ends was a West
ern idea, not Marxist; the ideas of
"work for all," high wages and low
prices, and expanding economy were
Western in origin but recently I
adopted by Russian spokesmen.
DIPLOMATIC NOTES
Diplomatic considerations for
meeting the Russian challenge were
realistically analyzed by Brooks At
kinson in the New York Times in
July, 1946. The core of his trio of I
articles is "Russia and United States j
are not enemies, but are not friends. !
Wherever and whenever Russia
might be inclined to encroach upon j
the vital interests of a stable and
peaceful world we should confront j
them with friendly firmness backed j
by superior strength." Atkinson ;
thinks "there is no other way."
CULTURAL NOTES
The final considerations are of a !
cultural nature and attempt to
reach the Russian people. The ideas
might include:
1. Attempts to expand the present
program of beaming radio broad
casts to Russia each evening, into a
larger plan of securing two-way in
terviews such as occur each Sunday
between Britons and Americans.
2. Attempts to exchange students
and teachers as we do with other
countries.
3. Attempts to acquire informa
tion, knowledge of Russian life.
We know that censorship, strict
control over admission of foreigners,
and fear of social or cultural rela
tions with us—all these make it
hard to acquire knowledge of Rus
sia. All the more reason exists to S
increase our efforts to reach the
Russian people. Once we reach them '
perhaps the world may be One
World.
