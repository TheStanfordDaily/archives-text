# Poll on Code Tabulated
## 
### 
Declaring that Stanford students
have expressed themselves as over
whelmingly in favor of the Honor
Code, members of the Code Stand
ing Committee yesterday released
new figures on the recent school
wide survey. A tabulation of the
2,5(50 questionnaires so far returned
reveals that 2,030 students believe
the Code is working successfully.
Committer chairman A 1 Forbes
said that 250 students expressed the
belief that the Code is not function
ing properly, while 280 ventured no
opinion.
In commenting on the relatively
small number of forms returned out
of the 7.000 distributed, Forbes de
clared that a large number of off
campus students had not turned in
forms and that some of the men's
living groups have not co-operated
to the fullest extent on the matter.
'"We anticipated that a sizeable
out would not be returned, but
U3aiS ss.ueuuojjsanb ol| j jo uorpiod
we fed that those we do have rep
resent overall student opinion of the
honor system to a fairly accurate
degree."
Forbes' breakdown of the query
form reveals that to the question:
"Have you noticed any violations of
the Code in the last two quarters?"
COO answered "yÂ«s" and 1.710 "no."
To, "Do you consider cheating in
short quizzes us serious as cheating
in' mid-quarters or finals?" Yes,
y.45; and no, 250.
Suspension from the University
regardless of the offense was fa
vored by 325, but 1,880 opposed es
tablishing such a policy, reflecting
the opinion that punishment should
vary according to the seriousness of
the offense. This question showed
1 ,835 for and 195 against.
When asked if any specific course
or class situation is known where
Honor Code violations are preva
lent, 1,565 students said "no." Of
the 350 answering "yes," four dif
ferent courses were listed as having
continual code violations.
Forbes said he will write to each
of the four professors concerned to
ask if their co-operation in up
holding tho system can be obtained.
Class breakdowns show that sen
iors led the school by turning in 575
questionnaires, followed by 485 for
the sophomore class. Juniors were
listed with 475 forms and freshmen
with 4CO. Two hundred eighty grad
uate students answered forms and
285 were returned with no class
designation.
The committee is planning to bind
400 of the best questionnaires as a
gift to the library and as reference
material to send other schools who
write Stanford asking about the
Code.
