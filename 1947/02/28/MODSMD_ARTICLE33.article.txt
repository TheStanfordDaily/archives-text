WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 (UP).—
Herbert Hoover today recommend
ed that the United States and Brit
ain spend $384,000,000 on a six
month program to te"d a hungry
Germany whose living conditions
"have been sunk to the lowest level
known in a hundred years of West
ern history."
The former President said earlier,
after a personal and written report
to President Truman, that Ameri
can taxpayers obviously must help
loot the bill to restore Germany to
a position where she can pay for her
own food. He said he was confident
that they would not object.
"Conditions are pretty grim all
over Europe, including England," he
told White House reporters. "This
is the worst winter Europe has had
in 50 years."
Newsmen asked Mr. Hoover if he
saw any danger of imperialism in
rebuilding Germany to a semblance
of sell-sufficiency.
*'No, 1 do not," he replied. "If
you could see the shattered condi
tions in the economic, political, and
social life of Germany you would
have no fright.
"All those people that might have
imperialism in their souls are either
locked up or under sanctions."
The former chief executive said
that after filing his report on Aus
tria next week, he would submit a
report recommending redevelopment
of enough German industry to raise
exports to a point where the Ger
man people can be at least partially
self-supporting.
