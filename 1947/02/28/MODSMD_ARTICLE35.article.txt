### GEORGE CAULFIELD 
What ever becomes of the Big
Men on the campus? What kind of
work does the athlete do after ex
changing the pigskin for a sheep
skin? Are ex-Chappie editors handi
capped by the follies of their un
dergraduate days when they face
life along side of Portia?
Maybe these questions will be an
swered a couple of hundred cen
turies from now when they dig up
tlvfc* time capsule that enterprising
New Yorkers buried somewhere in
their native land.
But until then we must delve in
to haphazard statistics.

ing men carrying footballs up and
down the gridiron in 1933 earned
him the title of All-American, is

the Atlantic and Pacific Tea Com

tns in all directions for the cage
