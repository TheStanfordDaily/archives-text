# Mitchell Tells of Old Time Farm Life
## Roughs Hardened By Paly Hike 
### LORRY LOKEY 
"Professor Jenkins was the most
absent - minded faculty member
ever to instruct at Stanford.
"One afternoon some 45 years ago,
the good professor was hurrying to
catch the 4:30 train. Pushing his
heavy, old - English bicycle down
dirt-surfaced Palm Drive, Jenkins
reached the station too late to catch
his train.
"When Jenkins realized he had
missed the train because he forgot
to get on the bicycle and ride it to
the station, he became .so enraged
that he threw the bike against a
palm tree.
"Stories about Professor Jenkins'
absent - mindedness while at Stan
ford from 1891 to 1910 would fill a
book," said Dr. J. P. Mitchell, regis
trar and professor of chemistry,
emeritus.
PALM DRIVE MUDDY
Asked about Stanford life and tra
ditions 45 years ago. Dr. Mitchell
described transportational and so
cial aspects of the Farm's environ
ment typical of the era when most
of our parents were still in gram
mar school.
Stanford had its muddy roads 40
years ago when Palm Drive was a
dirt road between the two familiar!
borders of shoulder - high palm i
trees. During the rainy season, the \
road was converted into a bicycle I
mud-trap.
FIRST CAR CAME IN '01
Speaking of roads, Dr. Mitchell
found that the first locally owned
car fo travel on campus roads was j
the 1901 Autocar owned by Ray i
Lynton Wilbur.
Dr; Wilbur, leading practicing j
phy.«ftr:ian in this area at the time,
needed faster transportation than the
conventional horse and buggy. Mrs. I
Stanford vetoed the car idea, how- j
ever, because the vehicles fright- ,
cned the horses.

After lengthy debate, the two
reached a compromise whereby the
doctor could drive a car to his cam
pus home across the street from the
post office provided he went via the
back gate through Mayfield to Palo
Alto.
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT?
While Dr. Wilbur carried on
with his Autocar, Stanfordites as
a whole refused to become car
conscious until after the World
War. In 1910 the very expensive
horseless carriages took two and
a half hours to reach San Fran
cisco ami invariably blew at least
one tire and one spark plug on the
round trip.
Although Cadillacs and Rolls-
Royces did not rate on campus 40
years ago. the streetcars did. In
October, 1909, the first streetcars ran
to the campus from Palo Alto via

| the present S.A.C. building to the
| site of the Bookstore.
BIG GAME FIRES POPULAR
Swinging to the social side of
Farm life, Dr. Mitchell tells of elab
| orate preparations for the Big Game
bonfire each quarter.
"Each year's class would try to
i outdo the preceding year's fire by
| gathering more wood and adding
j more originality to the Cal pyre.
"Finally, complaints from resi
i dents bordering the campus forced
bonfire builders to set up a stand
j ard-style mound each year in order
to halt eager freshmen before their
enthusiasm included Palo Alto."
Social life was restricted to the
campus because transportation was
too slow and awkard. There were
no frequent trips down the road,
up to the hills, or into the City.
Class rivalry was sharp, and


MOT TIME TONIGHT—Thirty-eight years ago Stanfordites built
I his bonfire to start off pre-game ceremonies. At the top of the mound
is a simulated Cal gridder on the gallows, liig Game tires have been
held in the dry lakcbcd and in fields around Encina and the main libe.

reached the station too late to catch

"When Jenkins realized he had
missed the train because he forgot
to get on the bicycle and ride it to

that he threw the bike against a

PALM DRIVE MUDDY
Asked about Stanford life and tra
ditions 45 years ago. Dr. Mitchell
described transportational and so
cial aspects of the Farm's environ
ment typical of the era when most
of our parents were still in gram
mar school.
Stanford had its muddy roads 40
years ago when Palm Drive was a
dirt road between the two familiar!
borders of shoulder - high palm i
trees. During the rainy season, the \
road was converted into a bicycle I
mud-trap.
FIRST CAR CAME IN '01
Speaking of roads, Dr. Mitchell
found that the first locally owned
car fo travel on campus roads was j
the 1901 Autocar owned by Ray i
Lynton Wilbur.
Dr; Wilbur, leading practicing j
phy.«ftr:ian in this area at the time,
needed faster transportation than the
conventional horse and buggy. Mrs. I
Stanford vetoed the car idea, how- j
ever, because the vehicles fright- ,
cned the horses.

After lengthy debate, the two
reached a compromise whereby the
doctor could drive a car to his cam
pus home across the street from the
post office provided he went via the
back gate through Mayfield to Palo
Alto.
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT?
While Dr. Wilbur carried on
with his Autocar, Stanfordites as
a whole refused to become car
conscious until after the World
War. In 1910 the very expensive
horseless carriages took two and
a half hours to reach San Fran
cisco ami invariably blew at least
one tire and one spark plug on the
round trip.
