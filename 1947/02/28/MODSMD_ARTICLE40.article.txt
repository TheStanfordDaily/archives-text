heaven help the lowly frosh if he
left his cap off his head when leav
ing Encina.
FROSH GET DUNKINGS
"Encina bathtubs 25 or 30 years
ago were the site of yearly rituals
of freshman hazing. Eventually, the
Administration decided that show
ers would serve the original cleans
ing pui pose better than the dual
role of the tub.
"Hazing originally started on
campuses throughout the United
States," said Dr. Mitchell, "but as
high schools adopted the fad for
their frosh, college men decided
that the roughhousing was too
childish for them to continue."
SHEEP COME TO COLLEGE
Stanford's environment from May,
1910, until after the World War was
punctuated by the cries of as many
as 200 ewes and 250 lambs employed
to keep the grass and weeds down
on Farm athletic fields.
Sam Mac Donald, athletic field cus
todian since August, 1907, first ad
vised the Farm's Board of Athletic
Control to purchase 15 sheep at
$4.50 a head to cut down on the
University's field expenses. The
animals duplicated like rabbits, how
ever, and Mac Donald influenced the
balance of nature by giving lamb
barbecues for Farm sport teams.
HOW ROUGH CAN IT GET?
Non-fraternity men before 1905
walked into Palo Alto three times a
day for meals because no such
University eating facilities existed.
When 1905 rolled around, the Uni
versity Inn was built on the present
library site.
"Men were men in those days,"
said Dr. Mitchell, "and a little
walk into town was nothing."
Now. out in the Village three
miles away by four-lane, paved
highways . . .
