## SLING TIME

As the Woman Said When ller Window
Was Broken, "Tin* (InrtaiiTs (»oinsr Down"
As the show people would say, tonight and tomorrow night's perform
ances v/ill ring clown the curtain on the basketball season. On the whole,
results have been satisfying; the Indian cagers have dune much better
than anyone expected. Better than anyone, that is, except a certain former
Daily sports editor who—after last year's disastrous denouement stated
baldly and boldly that Stanford would win the 1947 title.
He went overboard, but he was closer to the truth than the big-time
San Francisco guessperts who thought the locals would have to bribe their
opponents to win even one game. Well, they have lost five in league play—
but they have won five, too.
One would not be wrong in terming Coach Everett Dean's boys the
giant killers. They held the champs even, but they had trouble whipping
the bums. Of course, when they dropped the first two games to Cal they
were not the smooth-functioning outfit they are now —and the capable
reserves available now had not yet been developed.
The California Bears have slipped a great deal since the early sea
son—perhaps because they had to go on the road and no longer had the
advantage of the Berkeley rooting section. They have lost six out of
their last seven games, while the Cardinals have won eight out of their
last ten contests.
From that, one might assume that Stanford is a cinch to win both
games and that His Nibs Price's boys shouldn't even bother to show up.
If one assumes that, one does not think very deeply, however.
These College Men Are Really Spirited
The present over-age Stanford Rough is likely to poo-poo school spirit
and the will to win—but. it still exists. Even tht veterans, once they get
back into the swing of things, try as hard as they did when they were 15)—
at least, they do at Stanford. After the last game, they'll probably get even
more spirits.
Whatever we may think about the Berkleyans' choice of a school, we
must admit that they are much like us; they have the same emotions and
desires. Stanford still loves to beat Cal and, conversely, Cal still loves to
beat Stanford. If they could smother the Cards in these two remaining
contests, they would salvage, what has turned out to be a disastrous sea
son. Believe me, they'll do their damnedest.
There's this to consider, too; by winning at least one game they will
insure second place for themselves. If they happened to win both—and
Troy unexpectedly dropped the Bruins—they'd have the championship.
Stanford must win both to snare second place from Cal—and a possible
lie for the title.
Therefore—you can expect a pair of REAL basketball games this week
end. 1 think the Indians, if they can play as they did in the second half of
the second U.C.L.A. game, will outclass the Bears—but that was the abso
lute season's peak for the boys, and it won't be easy to maintain it. They'll
win the first game, 1 believe, but the second will be much tougher; the
added reserve strength may turn the trick—but I wouldn't bet on it.
Spring Comes at the (iraek ol' the Mat
Basketball is virtually over, and baseball is already upon us —baseball,
the real harbinger of spring. The bluebird is only a second rater. And,
I'm happy to tell you, Stanford has a baseball team. It may turn out to be
a very good one.
But don't go off dreaming about championships; ;the other teams have
improved too. The season will show who has improved the most. Win or
lose, though, people who watch the Stanfords perform this spring will
see baseball rather than a pitiful travesty on the game—as last year, for
instance. *
Among those playing is Larrnpin' Lloyd Merriman, who has become
Stanford's iVlr. Football. Believe it or not, he's a better baseball player
than he is a gridstcr, and that's saying plenty. He was one of the few
bright spots on last year's diamond squad. This year he is already
rounding into shape fast, and seemingly has his hitting eye hack already.
More often, this year, you'll see the Stanford infielders throw the batter
out at first rather than kick the ball into the dugout, or heave a wild one.
into the right field corner. Teddy Nell is working out at second base, and
looks good at making those pivots on double plays. He's not in top form
yet—but he will be.
Buck Brownson is back at short. Last year he was just recovering from
a nasty automobile accident; now he's ready. He covers a lot of ground,
and has a good peg to first. After one particularly brilliant throw, spec
tator Marchie Schwartz was heard to remark, I STILL think that boy
would make a great passer!
There are others, and I'll have something to say about 'them later—
after I've watched them a little more. But right now the only real weak
ness is pitching, and it's still to early to be positive about that.
Peripatetie Paragraphing
During the last Cal series Sgt, Slinger covered the Berkeley game via
radio, being an indolent type who abhors long, arduous journeys into for
eign and hostile lands. Suddenly he heard the announcer scream, "Rocker
fell down and hit his head and was replaced by Coach Nibs Price!" Come
now, Nibs, haven't you used up your eligibility?"

One of the stars of the brilliant gymnastics team that has entertained
basketball fans between halves, they tell me, is Ted Kalin. I say "They tell
me;" what with the thrillers the boys have been playing lately, my jumpy
nerves demand that I go outside and foul up the fresh night air with
cigarette smoke.
Incidentally, at one of these fresh air sessions Marchie Schwartz
suggested to a rather large young man of lethargic nature that he go out
for football. Now the aforementioned young man is talking about trans
ferring to Vale!

Recently Sgt. Slinger made a couple of boots in this department. He
said Hec Edmondson was the crew coach at Washington, but it's really A 1
Ulbrickson (these Washington sons are confusing). Also, he stated that
the major league waiver price is $7,. r »00; he didn't know the boys had
recently raised it to $10,000 —without even informing him.
(.VOW I'VE SEEN EVERYTHING! WHEN A COLUMNIST ADMITS
HE MADE AN ERROR INSTEAD OF BLAMING IT ON THE LINO
TYPE OPERATOR. IT MUST BE THE END OF THE WORLD!!)
Endsley's note: The above was written a week ago, but there wasn't
room to run it. Cecil Fair, the linotype operator, added the snide remark.
The whole thing must have been too much for him because he quit his
job the next day and hasn't been seen since.)
