Ilall, the U.S.F. Rugby team ven
tures down to the Farm Saturday
afternoon to play Stanford at 3 p.m.
on the Intramural Field.
Last week, in their first game, the
Dons were beaten by Petaluma Am
erican Legion, 8-15, the same team
that defeated Stanford, 9-3.
IMINS ARK HOUGH
The U.S.F. team is composed
mainly of football players and played
a rough brand of ball against the
sessions this week. Coaches Wylie
and Classen were somewhat dubious
oi the Indians' chances against the
Fulton Street boys. However, the
locals have looked good in winning
their last two games and should
outseore the inexperienced Dons.
A doubtful starter for the Farm
Saturday is Bert Avery, breakaway,
who injured his knee and hasn't
practiced this week.

completed for the Cal game, which
