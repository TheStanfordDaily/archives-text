# Card Nine Tackles USF
## 
### ART LUBIC 
The University of San Francisco
provides the first taste of collegiate
competition for Harry Walter's local
nine when the highly-touted Dons
invade the Farm tomorrow after
noon. Game time is 2:15 on the Stan
ford diamond.
Card fans are still talking about
the sudden display of hitting power
in Wednesday's game which saw the
Stanfords come to life and blast
home seven runs in a big eighth
inning rally to nip the Boston major
league rookies 7-4. The same Bean
town crew hung a 6-2 defeat on the
Dons at USF Sunday.
DAIILE TO PITCH
Southpaw Dave Dahfe draws the
starting assignment for tomorrow's
fray. The South lander, who starred
on the rubber for South Pasadena
High and San Diego Navy, has dis
played a world of stuff in his early
season performances and should do
veil this year if he can curb an in
clination toward wildness.
LINEUP UNCHANGED
Aside from Dahle the same lineup 1
which took the field in Wednesday's
game will be out there tomorrow.
The infield, which turned in four
double plays against Boston, sports
Benny Cardinalli on first, Ted Nell
at the keystone sack. Buck Brown
son at short, and diminutive Bill
Arce at third base. Ward Walkup
will be behind the bat to handle
Dahle's slants.
The outfield will have Al Kircher
in left, Lloyd Merriman in center,
and Paul MeCloskey in right with •
Hay Winterhalter, Lou Gowans, and
John Wallace in reserve.
WOLTERS SPLITS
MOUND DUTY
Since the game will not have any
bearing on the Farm's conference
record (first CIBA game is March
24 against USC at Los Angeles)
Wolter may adhere to his policy of
splitting the mound chores three
ways. In that case any of the nine j
remaining chuckers could see action j
against the Dons—Chuck Wakefield, j
Bill Brokaw, Don Pendergrass, I
Claude Rosenberg, Forrest Shum- j
way. Frank Laßrun or the trio of |
Larry Wolf, Dick Flatland, and D;ive !
Stott which won Wednesday.

The University of San Francisco
provides the first taste of collegiate
competition for Harry Walter's local
nine when the highly-touted Dons
invade the Farm tomorrow after
noon. Game time is 2:15 on the Stan
ford diamond.
Card fans are still talking about
the sudden display of hitting power
in Wednesday's game which saw the
Stanfords come to life and blast
home seven runs in a big eighth
inning rally to nip the Boston major
league rookies 7-4. The same Bean
town crew hung a 6-2 defeat on the
Dons at USF Sunday.
DAIILE TO PITCH
Southpaw Dave Dahfe draws the
starting assignment for tomorrow's
fray. The South lander, who starred
on the rubber for South Pasadena
High and San Diego Navy, has dis
played a world of stuff in his early
season performances and should do
veil this year if he can curb an in
clination toward wildness.
LINEUP UNCHANGED
Aside from Dahle the same lineup 1
which took the field in Wednesday's
game will be out there tomorrow.
The infield, which turned in four
double plays against Boston, sports
Benny Cardinalli on first, Ted Nell
at the keystone sack. Buck Brown
son at short, and diminutive Bill
Arce at third base. Ward Walkup
will be behind the bat to handle
Dahle's slants.
The outfield will have Al Kircher
in left, Lloyd Merriman in center,
and Paul MeCloskey in right with •
Hay Winterhalter, Lou Gowans, and
John Wallace in reserve.
WOLTERS SPLITS
MOUND DUTY
Since the game will not have any
bearing on the Farm's conference
record (first CIBA game is March
24 against USC at Los Angeles)
Wolter may adhere to his policy of
splitting the mound chores three
ways. In that case any of the nine j
remaining chuckers could see action j
against the Dons—Chuck Wakefield, j
