##

By JOIIN lIUBBARD
With middleweight mainstay, Yank
Levin, out of action due to a cut
eye. Stanford's boxing team trav
els to Berkeley tonight to battle
UC ring men.
The Indians' chances, despite loss
of Levin, look fairly promising. As
usual Coach Clayton Frye will have
to give the opposition a two, or pos
sibly three point running ,start by
forfeiting the 125 lb., 130 lbs and
heavyweight matches.
HEAVYWEIGHT MAY EIGHT
There is an outside chance that
Frye will enter a heavyweight. If
he does he will draw from the 175 lb.
bracket, manned by Elia Long, Joe
Cranmer, and Bill Edwards.
Levin, butted in the eye in his Cal
Aggie bout last week, may be side
lined for the rest of the season.
As always the match against Cal
marks the high point of Stanford's
intercollegiate boxing season. In the
past the Bears have had consistently
strong squads, but this year their
record is none too sparkling.
They dropped a (i-3 team, decision
to UCLA, almost the same score by
which Stanford defeated the Bruins,
and barely managed to salvage a

J 4-4 lie out of their clash with a
weak San Francisco State aggrega
tion.
SIX BOUTS ON CARD
Six bouts are listed on the even
-1 ing's card. Owing to the probable
! three-point deficit, the Indians must
win five of the six fracases to register
| a victory.
That is a pretty tough assignment,
. but Frye and assistant coach Mai
| Mynderse believe their proteges are
I equal to it.
The team will weigh in at the'gym
! at noon, and is scheduled to leave for
! Berkeley at 5 p.m. Starting time for
j the bouts is 8 p.m. in the Men's gym.
Following is the list of fights:
135 lbs. —George Jess (S) vs. Phil
j Booth or Bob Lustig (C).

ren Simmons or Pete Miller (C).
