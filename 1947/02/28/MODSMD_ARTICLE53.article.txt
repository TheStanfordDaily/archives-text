end against the California Blues.
The games will be played as curtain
raisers to the varsity contests, and
will start at 6:15 PM tonight at the
pavilion, and at 7:00 PM tomorrow
at Berkeley.
Jack Dana's squad has been run
ning hot and cold all season. One
evening they will lose to a second
rate quintet, and the next night come

The Frosh basketball quintet
will meet the Cal Frosh at 4:30
today in the Pavilion. Admission

clash with the Stanford B team

inilroading back 1o a lopsided win
over far better opposition.
One thing appears certain. To
carry off the laurels in these final
lilts the Stanford boys are going to
be at the height of their game. The
Cal Blues have lost only one fracas
all season.
The Farm Jayvees have had two
chief thorns in their sides this year
Menlo Junior College and the Blues,
who defeated them in their two pre
vious encounters. Two weeks ago
they avenged themselves against
the Jaycee team and a brace of wins
over Cal would mean the difference
between a good season and a medi

ocre one (as far as the Won-Lost
column goes.)
For Stanford the same starting
lineup as has done so well recently,
v/ill probably be nominated. This
includes Gene Martin and either
Jack Meredith or George Yardley
at the forward posts, Ralph Carver
in the pivot, with Bill Christiansen
and Jack Wood holding the guard
spots. Fred Lewis, Jack Crahan, and
dave Atcheson will fill in where
needed.
The Blues' starting lineup will
probably find Ray Lucas and Les
Dean at the forwards. John Cunning
ham operating at the center post,
and Claude Hiskey and Gordon
Cuneo holding down the guard spots.
