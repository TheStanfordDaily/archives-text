SHARFEN SHINES
Sharfen's sterling defensive back
board play was one of the chief rea
sons why the Machine attack was
never able to get started. The Med
ics led 12-7 at half time, and Jack
Reed's field goal consisted the only
scoring the Big Red Machine was

I height to good advantage as they
I edged a battling Townie Team 27-2* -
- outcome was in question un
; lil the closing minute of play al
' though the Betas were never be
j hind.
The Betas drew first flood with a
1 field goal by George Bower, and Pat
Casev followed suit for the Townies.

Bower and Bernard Woody then
dropped in a barrage of buckets and
when Ihe smoke had cleared, the ;
Betas were leading 11-2. At that
point, the game looked like a walk
away for the Betas, but the town- !
dwellers began to take advantage
of sloppy Beta ball handling and I
rallied to tie up the score at 11 all. |
The half ended with the fraternity 1
men ahead 14 -1
TOWNIES TIE IT UP
The Townies succeeded in tieing
the score three times in the second

scorer in the intramural competi- j
lion was again high point man with ;
13 counters. Bernic Woody com- j
bincd four successful free throws
