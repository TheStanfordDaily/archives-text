## The 						Need Is Clear 
### 
Six thousand students won't be going to to
night's basketball game with Cal, some by
their own choice, but at least two thousand
because the University's Pavilion can not seat
them.
Inadeguacy of the old Pavilion is painfully
obvious —particularly to the hundreds of stu
der.ts who stood in block-long lines for an
hour Monday only to find that the 1400 tickets
allocated to Stanford rooters had been sold
out.
Now this is a year of inadequacies. The
abnormally large enrollment has meant that
all students must make compromises on the
standard of full-scale pre-war college life.
Crowded classrooms, emergency housing, an
over-burdened faculty—all are problems
which are of first concern; beside them the
seating capacity of the Pavilion may seem
only a minor inconvenience. Yet we feel that
these pressing problems will pass away when
Stanford's 5,000 veterans graduate and enroll
ment falls to a near pre-war level. But still
the University Pavilion will remain inade
quate.

With basketball an even stronger drawing
card for sports followers than before the war,
it would take a mighty poor team not to attract
2800 fans to fill the Pavilion's meager seating
capacity.
There is no necessity of laboring the point. ;
The University needs a new Pavilion. Gradu
ate Manager A 1 Masters has said that receipts
from general admissions—income the Uni- !
versity now must pass up—would pay off
construction costs within a matter of a few
years. A new Pavilion, then, would saddle no
one with a long-standing debt.
The need is clear; the means are vague. 1
The Daily has passed the ball downcourt; who
wiil take it and score—the University? The
ASSU? The Memorial Fund Committee? B.H.
