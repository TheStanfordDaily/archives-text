### CARL HEINTZE 
What's wrong with American movies? The Acad
emy of Motion Ails and Sciences is holding their
Academy Award dinner next month, and the yearly
accolades are being dished out, but a strange thing
has happened. Among the pictures nominated for the
award as the best picture of the year, American pic
tures are being pushed out by foreign movies.
On the whole this has been a sad year for the boys
down in Culver City, Hollywood, and Beverly Hills.
About all they are able to boast about in spite of all
the money they spent are "The Yearling," "The Best
Years of Our Lives," and those two big heavy-budget
pictures, "The Razor's Edge," and "Duel in the Sun."
Stacked up against these comparatively weak pro
ductions are such things as "Henry V." "Brief En
counter, and "Open City," as well as a number of
smaller and less worthy English and French pro
ductions.
Not only this better quality of production is being
maintained by foreign producers, but they are in
creasing their quantity as well. There has been a
continual How of good, but not pretentious screen
plays from England which have been backed by the
money of Arthur Rank, an Englishman with a lot of
dough and patience.
Just what is the matter with American pictures?
It seems that they have lost their touch. The world
and the things they are showing is very pretty and
clean, but it doesn't exist outside of Hollywood. Take
'Open City." for example. It was a great picture be
cause it was real. It was not only significant, but
well acted, and tense and gripping.
"Henry V" is a special example, but it shows or
ouÂ«ht to show Hollywood that even Shakespeare if
properly presented can be good entertainment. In
stead we have something like "Duel in the Sun,"
which not only had one of the most preposterous ad
vertising campaigns in movie history, but was a poor
picture besides. Large budgets don't make up for a
lack of taste and story.
Take a couple of more examples, this time in their
treatment of love and marriage. "Brief Encounter"
is the Noel Coward story of two middle-aged people
who meet on a weekend and fall in love, only to find
that it is too late. "Vacation from Marriage" is the

story of how w;ir changed a man and his wife after
they had both been in the service for three years.
Both these pictures were made in England. One
was an English production, the other was made by
the English branch of M-G-M. The reason thoy are
%ood interesting pictures to watch is because the
people are real everyday persons. The middle-aged
matron in "Brief Encounter" doesn't look like Lana
Turner, nor the man like Tyrone Power. The couple
in "Vacation from Marriage" are just a couple of
people, too, as real as your next door neighbor.
But we run into weird characters like Pearl, The
Sin-Killer, and the like in "Duel in the Sun." It just
won't work.
There is a limit to everything, and when you do
things like running a love story into the develop
ment of the atomic bomb as Hollywood has done in
"The Beginning or the End," it's time to call a halt.
I wouldn t condemn all Hollywood efforts. For in
stance. take a picture like "The Killers" made over
from Ernest Hemingway's famous short story. It
was a good dirty gang fight, and a very good picture
in its way. "The Best Years of Our Lives" is an
other example of what the movie makers can do if
they try.
Both these pictures show that yuu don't have to
spend two or more million to make a good picture,
and one which will draw people to the box office.
They show that the rarified atmosphere of Southern
California could stand some fresh air, and some new
blood. One good sign is the increase in independent
producers where some one with an original idea
isn't hung by the nearest yes-man when he opens his
mouth.
Another is the large box office takes by foreign
movies. The money makers at the studios are getting
worried and are beginning to try new things.
There are a couple of other things that might be
done. One is to end the curse of the double bill
>vhich forces you to see "Dick Tracy vs. Cueball"
md "Humoresque" or something equally dissimilar
on the same night. Most people don't even sit through
the second feature anyway, but just get. hooked for
the extra picture in the price of admission.
After all. how can they expect you to study for
finals, if they don't run good pictures?
