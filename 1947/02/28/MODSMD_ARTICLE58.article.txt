### DAN ENDSLEY 
Partisan politics makes strange bedfellows, espec
ially in the present rather bizarre alignment. On
each successive day one is likely to discover another
weird combination of political leaders, ostensibly op
posed to each other but actually working toward the
same ends.
A rapid survey of the two major political camps
may throw a bit of much-needed light on the subject.
Republicans and Democrats in the generic sense
seemingly have ceased to exist. In the early days of
this nation political groups were created by great
issues; now issues are used to maintain political
groups in power.
Take the Republicans first. Within the party are
two powerful philosophies, contending for dominance
in party councils. They might loosely be called con
servative and liberal, although those terms have been
abused so much of late that neither now means a
great deal.
The conservatives are led by Sen. Robert Taft, Sen.
Kenneth Wherry. Speaker Joseph Martin, and others
of that ilk. In essence they advocate a return to
what they consider the tested and proved policies of
the past a protective tariff, self-sufficiency, and no
government interference in business and other 'pri
vate" affairs.
I he liberal wing of the party follows former Gov.
Harold Stassen, Sen. Arthur Vandenberg, and—to a
lesser degree—Governors Thomas E. Dewey and Earl
Warren. These men feel that the policies of the Re
publican party from Grant through Hoover are no
longer adequate. They believe a protective tariff
hurts the nation imposing it as much as it hurts out
siders. that lite today is necessarily interdependent
rather than self-sufficient, that social legislation is

in many instances necessary to protect the large body
of citizenry from small but powerful and predatory
minorities.
The Democratic party, like ancient Gaul, is divided
in three parts. To the far right are the Southern
Democrats—the McKellars and Georges and—yes,
even Bilbos. They are as hide-bound as the most
reactionary Republican now alive.
In the center—trying vainly to patch up a once
potent vote-getting machine— are what we shall
call moderates, led by President Truman, James F.
Byrnes, Sen. Connolly, and others.
To the far left is the Wallace group, of whom Sen.
Claude Pepper is the most, vociferous spokesman.
They are pseudo-socialists who espouse all sorts of
causes merely because those causes differ from the
present setup: they are the epitome of vagueness
(just my opinion).
The Republican liberals are much closer to the
Democratic moderates than to their conservative Re
publican colleagues; the Southern Democrats are
closer to the conservative Republicans than to the
moderate Democrats. The Wallace group stands alone.
Thus it isn't strange when we find Sen. Taft joining
Sen. McKellar in resorting to billingsgate in the David
Lilienthal matter nor is it surprising to find Mr.
Stassen embracing some of the more successful of
Franklin D. Roosevelt's reforms.
But so long as parties within parties exist, there is
bound to be chaos. We have to get all the people
who think alike segregated and tagged. Sooner or
later all the liberals must gravitate to one party, the
conservatives to the other—or we must form new
parties. Until that comes about, Congress will con
tinue to be a place of utter confusion.
