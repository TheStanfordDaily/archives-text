NINA ALMOND, librarian for the Hoover Library, and CHARLES
F. DELZELL, European representative for the library, inspect one of
the 10,000 separate pieces of documentary material on post-revolutionary
Spain that have arrived at the library.
More than half of the current shipment from Spain is made up of
books, pamphlets and Spanish language newspapers from the German
Cultural Institute in .Madrid. It is the largest single shipment of docu
ments ever received by the Hoover Library.
The remainder of the shipment consists of documents covering the
Franco regime since 1939 and also the Spanish Civil War from the
Franco standpoint.
