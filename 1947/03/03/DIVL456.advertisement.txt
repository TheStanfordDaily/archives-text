His genius gave wings to words
Ir was an historic moment. Alexander Graham Bell's telephone
had just spoken its first words—"Al/\ Will son, cmt/e here, I u\nil yon!"
That evening in Boston — March 10, 1876 —Dr. Bell's crude
instrument transmitted his voice only to the next room. But out
of it w as destined to come a w hole new er.t —the era of quick, easy
nation-wide telephony, of radio telephony in all its varied forms,
of talking pictures, voice and music reproduction systems and
electrical aids for the hard of hearing. Few inventions have played
a greater part in shaping the world we live in!
Since IX77 —just one year after Bell's long experimentation was
crowned with success —it has been Western lilectric's privilege to
help carry forward his great idea which gave wings to words. In
that year Western Hlccrric made its first telephone. More than
<15,000,000 have followed it —over 4,000,000 of them in 1946 alone.
Today, from coast to coast, in factories, offices, distributing
houses and central office installation crews, there are more than
llo.()()() Western F.lectric workers. Imbued with the Bell System
pirit of service, they are helping to provide equipment in record
quantities to meet telephone needs far beyond any envisioned by
the inventor.
/ "A 1 ins year marks the 100 th Anniversary of Bell's birth in

If ■%- Y,,1 ' IC was keenly interested in aiding the hard of hearing. He
'-V became a teacher ot "visible speech'" when 18 years old.
/K'-jA This work led to experiments with "telegraphing"
sound, out of which, in 1876, came his greatest invention
