### JACK CAPITO 
Block ''S" Society will hold its first meeting in eight years tomorrow
evening at 7:.'JO in the Women's Clubhouse.
The full support of students, particularly the varsity lcttermen, is
greatly needed, according lo Fred Boensch, chairman.
The new Block "S" Society sets up as its aims the following:

1) Betterment of athletics. *
2) Molding of student actions and
opinions.
.'}) Elimination of booing at con
tests.
4) Good attendance at all con
tests.
5) Aid in procurement of poten
tial athletes.
0) Development of public rcla- j
tions with outside groups.
7) Elimination of the wearing of :
foreign letters and sweaters on cam
pus.
8) Stipulation of size, weight, and i
type of letter to l>e awarded in each I
sport.
0) A yearly meeting with alumni ;
"S" men at a barbecue or dinner i
when initiating new members.
The first Block "S" Society was j
born at Stanford under the name |
"Skull and Snakes" Society, origi- j
nally composed of Block "S" men j
only. Later it took in other leaders i
on campus who showed interest in j
athletics. The main functions of the
society were sending Quads to high !
schools and keeping rooters in
check at. contests.
Reborn in the form of "Quadran
gles," it was composed of captains j
of various major sport teams, later
becoming more social than con- j
structive.
The Block "S" Society was or- ;
ganized in IO.'JO for Block "S" men j
only, by Andy Stojkovic and Gene j
Coldiron. After five meetings it j
folded upâ€”the victim of a cont.ro- |
versial athletic set-up, culminating
in the firing of Coach Thornhill.
It is pointed out by Boensch that i
intercession in hiring or firing ofj
athletic personnel is not among the |
aims of the new Block "S Society, j
as there is an absence of "pressure i
groups," and therefore there is a
rjuiet and satisfactory handling of j
incidents such as those that have
made so many headlines at other j
schools.
