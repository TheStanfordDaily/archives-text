# Smyth Stresses Free Research
## 
### 
In an hour's discussion of the last "Fifty Years of Atomic Physics,"
Dr. Henry D. Smyth last Friday emphasized the parts which the free in
ternational exchange of information and small-scale independence have
played in all the important discoveries in this field since 1895.
He pointed out that during the war there was "cessation of scientific

research 1 in favor of applied sci-"J
.science, a short - range policy. He I
warned against succumbing to all I
the pressures of "international pol- I
itiers" to maintain such a war at- !
mospb'Mc, saying, "The war period â– 
was a cessation of scientific research j
and a continuation of a war atmos
phere will prevent the healthy re
birth of scientific research."
Dr. Smyth drew attention to the [
modern paradox of science in its I
dual need for intellectual independ- j
cnce and for financial support in the
building of expensive machines,
such as cyclotrons, for research.
In support of his conclusions Dr.
Smyth cited repeated instances in
which Ihe success of the scientific
method has depended upon inter
national spread of the scientific word i
between widely scattered and little- ;
known research workers.
HISTORIC ILLUSTRATIONS
The prime example was the his- >
lory of the discovery of the neutron
in the early 1930'5.
Primary observations of unusual
phenomena which suggested the ex
istence of neutrons were first made
by Bothc and Becker in Germany in
19.'10. In ISKS2 Irene Curie and Jo
liel in Paris producd further inter
esting data, also making the exist
ence of neutrons seem probable. A
man named Chadwick in England |
finally proved the theory later in j
The discovery and proof of the
actuality of nuclear fission was also
accomplished by a scries of inter- |
national experiments and consulta- |
lions including Niels Bohr of Co- I
penhagen. Einsterin, Frisch, and J
Meitner of Germany, and a num- |
her of other Germans and Amcri- 1
cans. The principle was verified
by world-wide experimentation.
CONCLUSION
"II may be that the requirements I
<>l international politics will inter
fere . . . but let us not have any |
illusions. No amount of govern
ment financing or of organization ]
and official correlation will auto- |
matically keep free, imaginative re- 1
search going," said Dr. Smyth in his |
conclusion.
Dr. Smyth, who is the author of
the famous "Smyth Report" on the
military use of atomic energy, gave
his lecture under the auspices of
Sigma Xi. national honorary society
of scientific research.
