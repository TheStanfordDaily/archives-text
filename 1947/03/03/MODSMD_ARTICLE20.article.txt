### 
A new coast-to-coast radio net
work show originating from various
campuses will soon be aired if a
plan originated by Jim Gershman,
a KSU script writer, meets with
success. The first three of the week
ly programs will be broadcast from
the Farm, according to Gershnian's
present plans.
"The program will be sponsored
commercially and its tentative cost
is between $5,000 and $10,000 per

work to the advertiser," said Gersh
man. Tin- National Broadcasting
Company af first held an option on
the idea, but granted Gershman a
release so lie could contact other
agencies.
A 40-man organization has been
formed to forward t.lio show, ac
cording td Gcrshman. The plan calls
for a college variety program fea
turing musical comedy, dramatic
adaptation, situation and problem
comedy, and concert music, and will
be produced from a different cam
pus each week, he said.
The program will be produced by
professionals, he said, but will be
written, directed, and acted by ama
teurs. Work will be performed on
an honorarium basis, said Gcrsh
man, but union approval will first
have to be secured. A national
scholarship and radio institute will
be formed with the profits, he
stated.
Dates of campus-wide auditions
for both singers and actors will be
announced within the next week,
Gcrshman said.
