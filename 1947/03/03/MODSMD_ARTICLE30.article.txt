# Tresidder Declares at Alumni Meeting, 'Students Must Discard Old Ways in Meeting New World'
## 
### 
Keeausc we are 'likely to suc
cumb to the internal tensions of dis
unity, class hatred and confusion
which have afflicted our society for
centuries, students must be taught
to discard old ways in meeting the
revolutionary changes in our physi
cal world," stated Dr. Donald B.
Tiesidder, at the 15th annual alum
ni conference yesterday in Seattle.
Dr. Tresidder and five Stanford
professors traveled to the North
wist last weekend to be featured
peakers at the conferences in Port
land on Saturday, and in Seattle
yesterday. The programs were iden
tical. ,
In addition to technical skills to
be taught in universities, Dr. Trcs
idder said that students must be
taught how to live together co-op
eratively, tempering their sober real
ism with broad tolerance, warm
ympathy, and insight into the frail
lies of human nature.

Opening the conference in the
afternoon, John P. Troxell, Stan
lord of industrial relations, made a
plea for reason in labor relations,
on the side of both employers and
workers.
Dr. Troxell emphasized that the
public will not stand for labor and
employers "hi-jacking," simply be
cause either faction believes that
they can bring the public to its
knees whenever they wish.''
"We have a right to ask that rules
l.e found for conducting the struggle
m that we will not again go through
cm tain grim experiences such as the
railway strike of last May. the coal
hike of last December, or the situ
ation that plagued Oakland and
Pittsburgh last fall," he concluded.
In his survey of China's political
situation, Dr. Shau Wing Chan, pro-
It ssor of Chinese and humanities,
declared that the internal condition
ol lhat country is the forerunner of
what will eventually happen in
other parts of Asia.
Dr. Chan stated that the United
Stales has a direct interest in the
international ramifications of the
Chinese problem and urged that the
tlniled States "exert its good politi
cal influence and economic pressure
mii the leaders of both Chinese fac
tions, Nationalists and Communists,
so that they may know that this
country is only interested in ex
tending a helping hand to those who
will promote the welfare of the Chi
nese people."
CONTROLLED SCIENCE?
Me said lhat the Soviet Union
must be urged to co-operate with
us in maintaining a similar policy
ol non-interference and in encour
aging the formation of a liberal and
progressive yet friendly Chinese
government.
As long as the welfare of the Chi
nese people remains our objective,
we cannot possibly go wrong, even
il we fail to get Russian co-opera
lion, he said, for "it would be dan
gerous for the United States to ac
tually interfere."
The U.S. government and partic

ularly the Army and Navy tire pay- j
ing the bills for science today, and j
this revolutionary trend in the fi- |
nancing of research may not be in j
the best interests of long-range sci- j
entific accomplishment, was the (
view of Dr. Paul H. Kirkpatrick. I
Stanford professor of physics.
Dr. Kirkpatrick said that a way j
out of the situation of such govern- j
mental and service control of sci- j
?nce would be to establish a Na- |
tional Science Foundation such as I
Congress declined to establish in the j
last session.
The disadvantage of such a revo
lutionary trend is that "the hand
that signs the check controls the
direction of scientific progress, and
that such military control is war
and preparation for war."
"The most celebrated scientific |
achievements of the recent war— j
radar, penicillin, and atomic bombs J
—were applications of prewar basic j
discoveries of pure science, and j
were based upon peace - time re- [
search. Such pure science is re
tarded rather than advanced in
time of war," he said.
"Real progress has been made in
establishing the United Nations or
ganization, creating effective pro- I
cedures for its operation, and arous- I

ing interest in the international or
ganization throughout the world,"
said Professor Philip W. Buck, of
the Political Science Department,
before the Alumni Conference.
In his talk, "The United Nations
and Its Struggle for Peace," he
stressed that the international or
ganization needs the continued sup
port of all citizens of all nations.
EDUCATION TECHNIQUES
"Military training was simply
present-day educational techniques
adapted to Army and Navy situa
tions," declared Dr. A. John Bartky,
of the School of Education.
He denounced those who be
lieve that the military training used
in the war should be applied to im
prove modern education methods.
"If military training was satisfac
tory then also most of our present
approaches to "college education
must be satisfactory, for they are
and were one and the same thing,"
he said.
Stressing that the rules of educa
tion had changed since Walter
Camp's day. Dean Bartky pointed
out the need for more practical ap
plication of subjects, although it
meant the loss of more Aristotle and
subject matter which had been wor
shiped by the college academician.

troxell opens
Opening the conference in the
afternoon, John P. Troxell, Stan
lord of industrial relations, made a
plea for reason in labor relations,
on the side of both employers and
workers.
Dr. Troxell emphasized that the
public will not stand for labor and
employers "hi-jacking," simply be
cause either faction believes that
they can bring the public to its
knees whenever they wish.''
"We have a right to ask that rules
l.e found for conducting the struggle
m that we will not again go through
cm tain grim experiences such as the
railway strike of last May. the coal
hike of last December, or the situ
ation that plagued Oakland and
Pittsburgh last fall," he concluded.
In his survey of China's political
situation, Dr. Shau Wing Chan, pro-
It ssor of Chinese and humanities,
declared that the internal condition
ol lhat country is the forerunner of
what will eventually happen in
other parts of Asia.
Dr. Chan stated that the United
Stales has a direct interest in the
international ramifications of the
Chinese problem and urged that the
tlniled States "exert its good politi
cal influence and economic pressure
mii the leaders of both Chinese fac
tions, Nationalists and Communists,
so that they may know that this
country is only interested in ex
tending a helping hand to those who
will promote the welfare of the Chi
nese people."
CONTROLLED SCIENCE?
Me said lhat the Soviet Union
must be urged to co-operate with
us in maintaining a similar policy
ol non-interference and in encour
aging the formation of a liberal and
progressive yet friendly Chinese
government.
As long as the welfare of the Chi
nese people remains our objective,
we cannot possibly go wrong, even
il we fail to get Russian co-opera
lion, he said, for "it would be dan
gerous for the United States to ac
tually interfere."
The U.S. government and partic

ularly the Army and Navy tire pay- j
ing the bills for science today, and j
this revolutionary trend in the fi- |
nancing of research may not be in j
the best interests of long-range sci- j
entific accomplishment, was the (
view of Dr. Paul H. Kirkpatrick. I
Stanford professor of physics.
Dr. Kirkpatrick said that a way j
out of the situation of such govern- j
mental and service control of sci- j
?nce would be to establish a Na- |
tional Science Foundation such as I
Congress declined to establish in the j
last session.
The disadvantage of such a revo
lutionary trend is that "the hand
that signs the check controls the
direction of scientific progress, and
that such military control is war
and preparation for war."
"The most celebrated scientific |
achievements of the recent war— j
radar, penicillin, and atomic bombs J
—were applications of prewar basic j
discoveries of pure science, and j
were based upon peace - time re- [
search. Such pure science is re
tarded rather than advanced in
time of war," he said.
"Real progress has been made in
establishing the United Nations or
ganization, creating effective pro- I
cedures for its operation, and arous- I

ing interest in the international or
ganization throughout the world,"
said Professor Philip W. Buck, of
the Political Science Department,
before the Alumni Conference.
In his talk, "The United Nations
and Its Struggle for Peace," he
stressed that the international or
ganization needs the continued sup
port of all citizens of all nations.
EDUCATION TECHNIQUES
"Military training was simply
present-day educational techniques
adapted to Army and Navy situa
tions," declared Dr. A. John Bartky,
of the School of Education.
He denounced those who be
lieve that the military training used
in the war should be applied to im
prove modern education methods.
"If military training was satisfac
tory then also most of our present
approaches to "college education
must be satisfactory, for they are
and were one and the same thing,"
he said.
Stressing that the rules of educa
tion had changed since Walter
Camp's day. Dean Bartky pointed
out the need for more practical ap
plication of subjects, although it
meant the loss of more Aristotle and
subject matter which had been wor
shiped by the college academician.
Keeausc we are 'likely to suc
cumb to the internal tensions of dis
unity, class hatred and confusion
which have afflicted our society for
centuries, students must be taught
to discard old ways in meeting the
revolutionary changes in our physi
cal world," stated Dr. Donald B.
Tiesidder, at the 15th annual alum
ni conference yesterday in Seattle.
Dr. Tresidder and five Stanford
professors traveled to the North
wist last weekend to be featured
peakers at the conferences in Port
land on Saturday, and in Seattle
yesterday. The programs were iden
tical. ,
In addition to technical skills to
be taught in universities, Dr. Trcs
idder said that students must be

eratively, tempering their sober real

hike of last December, or the situ

Pittsburgh last fall," he concluded.
In his survey of China's political
situation, Dr. Shau Wing Chan, pro-
It ssor of Chinese and humanities,
declared that the internal condition
ol lhat country is the forerunner of
what will eventually happen in
other parts of Asia.
Dr. Chan stated that the United
Stales has a direct interest in the
international ramifications of the
Chinese problem and urged that the
tlniled States "exert its good politi
cal influence and economic pressure
mii the leaders of both Chinese fac
tions, Nationalists and Communists,
so that they may know that this
country is only interested in ex
tending a helping hand to those who
will promote the welfare of the Chi
nese people."
CONTROLLED SCIENCE?
Me said lhat the Soviet Union
must be urged to co-operate with
us in maintaining a similar policy
ol non-interference and in encour
aging the formation of a liberal and
progressive yet friendly Chinese
government.
As long as the welfare of the Chi
nese people remains our objective,
we cannot possibly go wrong, even
il we fail to get Russian co-opera
lion, he said, for "it would be dan
gerous for the United States to ac
tually interfere."
The U.S. government and partic

ularly the Army and Navy tire pay- j
ing the bills for science today, and j
this revolutionary trend in the fi- |
nancing of research may not be in j
the best interests of long-range sci- j
entific accomplishment, was the (
view of Dr. Paul H. Kirkpatrick. I
Stanford professor of physics.
Dr. Kirkpatrick said that a way j
out of the situation of such govern- j
mental and service control of sci- j
?nce would be to establish a Na- |
tional Science Foundation such as I
Congress declined to establish in the j
last session.
The disadvantage of such a revo
lutionary trend is that "the hand
that signs the check controls the
direction of scientific progress, and
that such military control is war
and preparation for war."
"The most celebrated scientific |
achievements of the recent war— j
radar, penicillin, and atomic bombs J
—were applications of prewar basic j
discoveries of pure science, and j
were based upon peace - time re- [
search. Such pure science is re
tarded rather than advanced in
time of war," he said.
"Real progress has been made in
establishing the United Nations or
ganization, creating effective pro- I
cedures for its operation, and arous- I

ing interest in the international or
ganization throughout the world,"
said Professor Philip W. Buck, of
the Political Science Department,
before the Alumni Conference.
In his talk, "The United Nations
and Its Struggle for Peace," he
stressed that the international or
ganization needs the continued sup
port of all citizens of all nations.
EDUCATION TECHNIQUES
"Military training was simply
present-day educational techniques
adapted to Army and Navy situa
tions," declared Dr. A. John Bartky,
of the School of Education.
He denounced those who be
lieve that the military training used
in the war should be applied to im
prove modern education methods.
"If military training was satisfac
tory then also most of our present
approaches to "college education
must be satisfactory, for they are
and were one and the same thing,"
he said.
Stressing that the rules of educa
tion had changed since Walter
Camp's day. Dean Bartky pointed
out the need for more practical ap
plication of subjects, although it
meant the loss of more Aristotle and
subject matter which had been wor
shiped by the college academician.
Keeausc we are 'likely to suc
cumb to the internal tensions of dis
unity, class hatred and confusion
which have afflicted our society for
centuries, students must be taught
to discard old ways in meeting the
revolutionary changes in our physi
cal world," stated Dr. Donald B.
Tiesidder, at the 15th annual alum
ni conference yesterday in Seattle.
Dr. Tresidder and five Stanford
professors traveled to the North
wist last weekend to be featured
peakers at the conferences in Port
land on Saturday, and in Seattle
yesterday. The programs were iden
tical. ,
In addition to technical skills to
be taught in universities, Dr. Trcs
idder said that students must be
taught how to live together co-op
eratively, tempering their sober real
ism with broad tolerance, warm
ympathy, and insight into the frail
lies of human nature.
troxell opens
Opening the conference in the
afternoon, John P. Troxell, Stan
lord of industrial relations, made a
plea for reason in labor relations,
on the side of both employers and
workers.
Dr. Troxell emphasized that the
public will not stand for labor and
employers "hi-jacking," simply be
cause either faction believes that
they can bring the public to its
knees whenever they wish.''
"We have a right to ask that rules
l.e found for conducting the struggle
m that we will not again go through
cm tain grim experiences such as the
railway strike of last May. the coal
hike of last December, or the situ
ation that plagued Oakland and
