# 'Unconscious' Bears Ignite, Cards Demand Saliva Test
## 
### ART SHAPIRO 
Displaying the finest brand of
basketball seen In these environs in
many a year, the Cal Bears com
pletely outclassed a game but luck
less Indian quintet Saturday even
ing at Berkeley, 88-46.
UCLA copped the southern divi
sion title with a record of nine and
three, with Cal taking second hon
ors to the tune of eight wins against
four defeats. Stanford had to be
satisfied with third position while
USC brought up the rear with two
victories against ten defeats.
REARS WAX BRILLIANT
Meshing together like the gears
of a well integrated machine, Cali
fornia could do no wrong. The fast
break of the Berkeley Boys clicked
with precision, the shooting was su
perb, and the floor play was just
short of the miraculous. California
was good enough to romp over the
Uclans with ease and perhaps even
Kentucky, had they met those
squads that fateful Saturday night.
It was a case of the irresistible
force meeting the moveable object,
and move they did, as more and
more force was applied by the min
ions of Nibs Price. Cal shot off bal
ance, falling away, with their backs
to the netting, and with their eyes
closed, but swish, swish, and the
score started mounting into the
astronomical regions. The Cal root
ers began to glory in the orgy, as a
pall of silence closed in over the In
dian rooting section, and looks of
surprise replaced determination on
the faces of the Card hoopsters.
DEAN LAUDS CARD SPIRIT
Coach Everett Dean, when ques
tioned about the game yesterday
replied, "There were two outstand
ing features of the Cal-Stanford

game: 1. The super, unbeatable
brand of ball played by Cal. In
(very department they were almost
perfect. In the second half Califor
nia took 39 shots from the floor and
made 22 baskets, for an average of
r>(i per cent. Their total for the night
was 41 per cent. This was the most
remarkable basketball shooting I've
ever seen. 2. The other outstanding
thing was the splendid courage and
fighting spirit of the Indians. This
was demonstrated in the face of al
most certain defeat. The players
were helpless in the face of the su
perior speed, height, and marks
manship of the Bears, and our team
played good basketball, but it was
to no avail against the Bear's in
spired game.
"I am proud of the many good
performances of the Cards, and any
one who saw the game Saturday
night should not be ashamed of the
team's splendid effort."
INDIANS TAKE LEAD
The contest started off slowly with
little indication of the eventual
slaughter which was to follow. Cal
took an 8-2 lead, but Stanford came
right back to go into the lead after
six minutes of action. 13-9. With ten
minutes of play remaining in the
first half the Blue and Gold had
tied up the score, 14-14. Five min
utes later the Bears were leading
3(J-16. The halltime score saw Stan
lord behind, 38-23.
The second half of the contest re

semblcd the pre - game warm -up
session, with -Cal players missing
a minimum of shots, and driving in
to the basket with complete impun
ity. With the score standing at 52-
31, in favor of Berkeley, the exhibi
tion began, and then the score was
69-31, and it was all over except
for the setting of the conference
scoring record.
CAL BREAKS KECORD
Cal extended the lead to 45 points
with the scoreboard reading 82-37,
and the clock three minutes to go.
Durkee broke the 85 poiiit record
made at Cal's expense by UCLA as
the minute hand of the clock waltzed J
around to the two minute mark. The j
roof was off, and the partisan pavil
ion broke into a frenzied roar.
Stanford had the Axe. but Cal had
tight streight victories over the In
dian hoopsters, and revenge tasted
like ambrosia in the mouths of the
Berkeleyans.
California took all of the scoring
honors as Rocker led the parade
with 23 counters followed closely by
Hanger with 21, Wolfe with 20. and |
Durkee with 17. High for Stanford !
was Bill Stephenson with twelve, j
FRIDAY WAS SAI). TOO
The Friday eve affair was won by
California, 46-40. High scorer was
once more Rocker with 17 markers,
with Stephenson copping second
honors with a total of 11.
Stanford's season wound up with
13 wins against 15 defeats, and 5
conference scalps against 7 confer
ence scalpings.
A word of praise is due to the j

Indian basketeers who came through
with a successful season after hav
ing been consigned to the cellar by
most of the pre-season dopesters.
All the boys will be back next fall,
and California had better look to
her laurels, for the Deanmen will
not be satisfied with much less than
ninety points, and His Nibs' own
toupee.
