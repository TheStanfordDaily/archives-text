### 
With the blue chips down on ev
ery move on the court, the Intra
mural Basketball League roars clown
the home stretch this week with the
champions slated to be crowned
Wednesday night. The S.A.E. Lions
open the final round against the
Betas in the Pavilion at 7 tonight.
The Betas ascended the long 'play
off ladder in a tremendous stretch
drive. After snagging the League II
flag by clipping the Delts, 27-23, the
Betas repeated the score in a win
over the Townies.
Meanwhile, S.A.E. advanced to
the semi-finals with a decisive 29-18
whitewash of the Shysters, champs
of League VI. The Lion team
romped through League I with a
minimum of effort and should give
the Betas quite a fight.
