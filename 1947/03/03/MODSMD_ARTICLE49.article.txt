# Ruggers Run Wild; Splatter Dons, 17-0
## 
### HILL HACHTEN 
Stanford's rugby team rolled to an easy, 17-0, victory over the U.S.F.;
Dons in a rough and tumble contest here Saturday afternoon. Bob Brodie,!
Indian scrum half, high scorer again with 8 points tallied by two penalty
kicks and a conversion.
The Dons, big, rough, and inexperienced, were just never in the game.

'The smaller and smarter Indians con
trolled the ball .most of the time,
matched the rough play of the Dons,
and cashed in on the breaks to
! score.
CRIST SCORES FIRST
The only score in the first half
was made by Robb Crist, when he
i fell on the ball across the goal for a
| try. A long, broken field run by
Don Lipclt set up the score.
Stanford almost scored again
when Bert Avery and Marty Fcld
i man dribbled the ball through the
whole U.S.F. team for 50 yards.
However, the try was missed when
the ball rolled out of the end zone
before Avery could down it.
Early in the second half, Stanford
; was awarded a penalty kick 15 yards
from the goalpost which Brodie made
good to give the locals a (i-0 lead.
DON'S THREAT STOPPED
The Don's only offensive threat
came when Grelesch broke in the
clear on a long run with only Jack
Reynolds between him and the goal.
Reynolds, however, brought him
down with a jarring tackle and
j Stanford took over.
I Another penalty kick by Brodie,
this time from a difficult angle, made
the score 9-0. Bert Avery scored
che next try after a fine run by Wing
A! Morris. Bob Lindsay made the
last try and Brodie converted to make
the final score, 17-0.
OUTSTANDING KICKING
The . only thing that U.S.F. had
was the great kicking of fullback
Fred Shew, who made several high,
' towering boots. John Rosekrans
| and Louis Sloss looked outstanding
| on a smooth-functioning, heads-tip
I Stanford team.
; Next Saturday afternoon the rug
i gers have their "Big Game" when
j they play Cal here in the Stanford
Stadium at 2:30 p.m.
