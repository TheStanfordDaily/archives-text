two tills to the Cal Blues over the
weekend, succumbing Friday at the
Pavilion by a 49-40 count and bow

24. In afternoon contests Phil Beng
j ston's freshman hoopsters were
tumbled 39-36 and 43-31 by Tom
j Bell's California frosh.
The Jayvees, Friday night, af-
J tor being behind nine points at one
j point in the first half, they closed
: the gap to 21-20 in favor of the

good for an upset if the Deanmen
could keep up the pace.

But all the fire had gone out of
the Indians as they returned to the
floor. Cal displayed an or—
- dinary type of ball but it was enough
I to enable them to forge into a thir
teen point lead as the Stanfordites
■ were forced into error after error,
j The Blues made their points the
| easy way as men were left uncovered
below the bucket. Big John Cun
ningham's rugged 220 pound frame
gave Cal backboard control.
I High scorer for the game was
! Gordon Cuneo, star of last year's
Dardi Dandy team of the AAU loop,
| with 15 counters. Ralph Carver of
. Stanford and Dean of Cal followed
