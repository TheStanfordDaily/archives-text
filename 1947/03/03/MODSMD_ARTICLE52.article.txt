## How Soon Can a G.I. Forget?... 
### 
, . . .The only warm spot in bleak Le Havre:
the fled Cross Canteen with crimson red pot
bellied stoves, fresh baked doughnuts, card
games through the waiting hours, and rede
ployment news in Stars and Stripes. . . .
. . . The months without seeing a woman,
and then suddenly to have three American
girls, the cutest invariably from California,
drive into the area with their phonographs
playing over a public address system and nos
talgic repartee across the clubmobile's coun
ter .. .
, . . The hot coffee shack alongside the
autobahn . . ,
. . , The stacks of pocket books read at
sea . . ,
. . . And the dozen girls who drove 70 miles
each Saturday night to dance with a battalion
of soldiers?
Have we really forgotten the Red Cross or
is it that we just don't realize that of the 60
million dollars the organization is currently
asking us for, 75 per cent is intended to aid
lonely, bewildered Gl's still stationed at such

choice posts as Greenland's air bases, plus
veterans and families.
Not to mention the relief to hungry, dis
contented people susceptible again to such
war germs as we've recently fought.
Stanford fell far short of its announced
53,000 goal in last week's drive, with many
houses failing to contribute at all. Hence the
collections committee has extended the con
tributing period until this Wednesday. It is
hoped that during the next three days more
living groups can be reached by campus
representatives and financial proof be re
ceived to show that the failure of last week's :
drive is the result of some misunderstanding
and not, as it appears, thoughtlessness for
othersâ€”B.A.
