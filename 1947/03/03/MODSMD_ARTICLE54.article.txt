# BULL SESSION

### CARL HEINTZE 
There's a guy over in Toyon who owns a car.
You've probably seen it running around the Quad.
It's a big, long, sleek yellow Buick Super, 1947 model
with lots of chrome on it, a convertible top and so on.
Really it isn't a car at all, it's more like a house
on wheels. It has little buttons that you push when
you want the windows to go up or down, little but
tons that you push to make the seat go back and
forth. When you open the doors (of which there are
(wo) lights flash off ond on like they do when you
open the refrigerator door.
There's a heater, an air-conditioning plant of
midget proportions, a battery of tail lights, head
lights, spotlights, and so on. When you want the top
to fold back, all you do is press a button.
The inside of the car looks like Buck Rogers'
space ship: dials, buttons, levers, and countless other
gadgets. It takes 15 minutes of pre-flight training
before you can take off. I wouldn't be surprised if
there was a radar scope for night and fog driving.
When you see that boat coming down the street,
you get a strange emotion. You want to run and
hide. It looks like something straight from Mars or
Venus, and you sort of expect Flash Gordon to be
sitting at the wheel.
Understand, I'm not panning the owner, I'm just
jealous.
I used to own a car once. It was a model A Ford
with dirty red paint and a leaky convertible top.
The rear mainspring was broken, and all the stuffing
was coming out of the seat. The windshield wiper
had to be worked by hand.
It had rattles, and when you got up around 40
miles per hour the thing began to fall apart. The

tires were always going flat, and the side curtains !
were full of holes.
But, gee, I wasn't afraid to take it out and drive
it. Now this big yellow thing (I refuse to consider it
an automobile) would be different. Every day I
would have to run out and sec how it had fared
during the night. I'd have to see that the birds hadn't
been near it, and I'd have to wipe ofT all the dust
that had accumulated on its shiny surface during the
night.
Every day I would be out washing it off, and
when I took it out on the highway or down town, Ii
would always bo afraid that someone would run
into me or scratch the fenders or something.
If somebody wanted to ride with me, I'd have to
print a little book of instructions so that they
wouldn't press the wrong button and make the seat
fall back into a bed.
I'd worry about the thing all the time when I
wasn't in it because I would be afraid someone might
steal it. or the insurance I had wouldn't cover some j
mishap that I hadn't counted on. and probably I'd
end up a nervous wreck.
It just wouldn't work at all. I would spend so
much time in the ear that I wouldn't have any time
to look for a place to sleep or cat, and I'd end up by j
living in the car.
Someday probably all those dials and buttons
and shiny silver gadgets on the dashboard would get
me, and I'd go stark raving mad, and think I was j
in a B-29 or something, and try to make the thing ;
take ofT. Then they'd carry me away, wishing I had j
stuck to my little model A.
Or maybe I'm just rationalizing.

Really it isn't a car at all, it's more like a house
on wheels. It has little buttons that you push when
you want the windows to go up or down, little but
tons that you push to make the seat go back and
forth. When you open the doors (of which there are
(wo) lights flash off ond on like they do when you
open the refrigerator door.
There's a heater, an air-conditioning plant of
midget proportions, a battery of tail lights, head
lights, spotlights, and so on. When you want the top
to fold back, all you do is press a button.
The inside of the car looks like Buck Rogers'
space ship: dials, buttons, levers, and countless other
gadgets. It takes 15 minutes of pre-flight training
before you can take off. I wouldn't be surprised if
there was a radar scope for night and fog driving.
When you see that boat coming down the street,
you get a strange emotion. You want to run and
hide. It looks like something straight from Mars or
Venus, and you sort of expect Flash Gordon to be
sitting at the wheel.
Understand, I'm not panning the owner, I'm just
jealous.
I used to own a car once. It was a model A Ford
with dirty red paint and a leaky convertible top.
The rear mainspring was broken, and all the stuffing
was coming out of the seat. The windshield wiper
had to be worked by hand.
It had rattles, and when you got up around 40
miles per hour the thing began to fall apart. The

tires were always going flat, and the side curtains !
were full of holes.
But, gee, I wasn't afraid to take it out and drive
it. Now this big yellow thing (I refuse to consider it
an automobile) would be different. Every day I
would have to run out and sec how it had fared
during the night. I'd have to see that the birds hadn't
been near it, and I'd have to wipe ofT all the dust
that had accumulated on its shiny surface during the
night.
Every day I would be out washing it off, and
when I took it out on the highway or down town, Ii
would always bo afraid that someone would run
into me or scratch the fenders or something.
If somebody wanted to ride with me, I'd have to
print a little book of instructions so that they
wouldn't press the wrong button and make the seat
fall back into a bed.
I'd worry about the thing all the time when I
wasn't in it because I would be afraid someone might
steal it. or the insurance I had wouldn't cover some j
mishap that I hadn't counted on. and probably I'd
end up a nervous wreck.
It just wouldn't work at all. I would spend so
much time in the ear that I wouldn't have any time
to look for a place to sleep or cat, and I'd end up by j
living in the car.
Someday probably all those dials and buttons
and shiny silver gadgets on the dashboard would get
me, and I'd go stark raving mad, and think I was j
in a B-29 or something, and try to make the thing ;
take ofT. Then they'd carry me away, wishing I had j
stuck to my little model A.
Or maybe I'm just rationalizing.
There's a guy over in Toyon who owns a car.
You've probably seen it running around the Quad.
It's a big, long, sleek yellow Buick Super, 1947 model
with lots of chrome on it, a convertible top and so on.
