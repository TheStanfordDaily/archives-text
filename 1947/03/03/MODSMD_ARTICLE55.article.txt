# HISTORY 1947

### BIPAN CHANDRA 
On Feb. 20 Prime Minister Clement 11. Attloe
announced that Great Britain would hand over its
power in India to Indians not later than June. 1948.
Behind this statement lies a 200-year-old history
filled with the sweat and tears of both Indians and
British.
The East India Company had started conquering
and ruling parts of India by the middle of the 18th
century, but it was not until 1857 that the whole of
India came under the company. Also, in 1857 the
people of India made their last attempt to escape the
domination of this commercial company. But the
Great Mutiny failed in its purpose except in that it
showed that India was too big a job for the company.
After this the country came directly under the Brit
ish Crown.
To rule a large country like India the government
needed thousands of clerks and small administrators.
High officials could be imported from England but
the population of England was not big enough to
start a mass migration of army and civil personnel
that India needed. Moreover, English clerks were
far more costly than the native ones. As a result the
British decided to give a limited education to a few
Indians and thus enlist their aid. The present system
of clerk-education resulted. This had a two-fold
effect: a middle class with English education was
born, and despite careful screening of the students
they bet"an to assimilate the 18th- and 19th-century
ideas of freedom, equality, and democracy. This,
combining with an inherent patriotism, resulted in
these Indians trying to assert themselves in some
way. In 1885 some Indians under the patronage of
Hume, an Englishman, formed a political organiza
tion, the Indian National Congress.
Indian people were also taking part in the internal
commerce and the foreign trade of the country. Most
of this trade and education benefited Hindus more
than Moslems, who lagged behind for a few reasons.
Britain had won its empire from Moslems, and fear

ing their reprisal, tried its best to keep them down.
By the beginning of the 20th century the British
saw that Hindus were getting too strong and nation
alistic and decided to bring their age-old policy of
"divide and rule" into operation. In 1908, limited
municipal and legislative elections were held. In
these elections the principle of "separate electorates"
was laid down. Under this system Hindu candidates
could vote for Hindu candidates and Moslem voters
for Moslems. This was the beginning of communal
friction in India. When candidates of one commu
nity had no need of going to the voters of another,
harmony was not to be expected. Indian national
ists, Hindu as well as Moslem, fought against the
measure, but the imperialists refused to change the
policy with the result that this system persists even
today. As the historians have recorded it, it is the
biggest factor contributing to the communal dis
harmony. We have but to imagine what would hap
pen in the Urfitcd States if the Catholics were to
vote for Catholics only, in order to realize the fatal
effects of "separate electorates" in India.
Just when the Indian National Congress had
started to fight for the freedom of India, the world
was engulfed in war in 1914. People of India co
operated in full with the British, who promised new
reforms for India after the war. But instead after
the war a new ordinance was passed giving the
police tremendous powers and restricting the free
dom of the press and of public gatherings. In 1919,
thousands of people were gathered in a closed park
in Amritsar to hold a protest meeting against the
ordinance when General Dyer placed guns at the
only gate and without any provocation whatsoever
ordered the soldiers to fire. More than one thousand
people were killed and military law was declared
in the whole of the Punjab province. People were
infuriated by the incident and the leadership of the
Congress was changed. Indians wanted to do some
thing and they found a new leader in Mohandass
Karamchand Gandhi.
