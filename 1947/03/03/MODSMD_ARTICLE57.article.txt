# Farm Grounds Men Keep Campus at Best
## 
### STU FITCH 
"I don't-a like, I don't-a stay."
These are the words of Nick Bus
ko, gardener, who has liked the
Farm well enough to stay for 21
years. His only complaint: "Too
many dogs, bush all-a smash-a da
up."
He is just one out of 109 building
and grounds men whose daily job
is to keep Stanford at its physical
best.
Busko's garden-beat this quarter
is the Union area. Last week he
started his "get ready for spring 'an
schluss'" by applying a little pitch
fork treatment to the geranium
beds.
FROM YUGOSLAVIA
He came to this country from
Yugoslavia in 1901 and went to work
in copper mines throughout the
United States. In 1926 he decided
to come top-side and join the Stan
ford Family.
Nick said his wife used to work
in a cannery, but gave it up last
year to make housekeeping her full
time job. The Buskos live in Sun
nyvale. where Nick spends his spare
time puttering in a garden of "on
ions and garlic and lettuce and cab
bage."
Busko can remember when a
street car ran from Paly to thÂ® heart
of the campus. The Farm's shuttle
trolleys ran from the train station,
ud bv wav of stadium - side, cut

across to the street between the
Bookstore and Roos Brothers' shack,
and clanged to a stop beside the
Press Building.

He does not want people to know
his age, but he's old enough to be
mighty proud of his daughter, four
grandchildren, and great - grand
daughter.
"I feel like-a 20," he said.
Another of the old-timers, but
one who doesn't say very much, is
.Joe Weiss. Weiss, an Austrian,
came to Stanford in 1914,
Many a student has been forced
to move from his comfortable,
sprawled position on the Library
lawn when Weiss putts by with his
mechanical lawn mower.
NOT ALWAYS SOFT
But he can remember when
things weren't so soft, and the
Farm's spacious green patches had
to be cut by hand mowers. It took
three days to cut the grass, and
three nights a week Weiss went
home with an aching back.
He planted the oaks that now line
the Outer Quad from the Cubberley
Building to the History corner.
The War Library and Memorial
Hall grounds are kept at their phys
ical best under the broom, rake, and
clippers of Eh Yovanovich.
