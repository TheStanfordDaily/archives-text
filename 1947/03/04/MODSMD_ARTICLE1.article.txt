I IRST SOCIETY
The first Block "S" society origi
nated at Stanford under the name
"Skull and Snakes" Society, com- 1
posed of Block "S" men only. Later j
it included other leaders on campus j
who showed interest in athletics, j
The main functions of this early or- j
ionization were sending Quads to i
high schools and keeping rooters in
check.
Begun again under the name of |
"Quadrangles," it was composed of
captains of various teams, and later
became njorc social than construc
tive.
ORGANIZED BLOCK 'S'
The original society was organized !
by Andy Stojkovich and Gene Cold
iron, but after five meetings it was
given up, being the victim of a con
troversial athletic set-up culminat- j
ing in the firing of Coach Thornhill. I
Chairman Fred Boc.-sch pointed
out that the reorganized Block "S"
does not intend to interfere in the
hiring or firing of athletic personnel,
as there is an absence of pressure
groups which are known for rais
ing such disturbances as have made
the headlines in other schools.
