"The thing that strikes a foreigner
most about Americans is their fast
way of living." said Ulf Ramm-Er
iekson, a student from Sweden, who
addressed the International Club
last Sunday.
"Your travel is fast, your educa
tion is fast, and your rate of spend
ing money is fast. You never save
for old age," he continued. "Maybe
you never think you will get old."
Praising the informality and friend
liness of Americans, he said that
nowhere else in the world can you
greet your professors on the cam
pus so informally.
Ara Oalstaun, an Indian student,
gave his impressions of 0.1.'s in In
dia. "They and not the Standard Oil
officials showed India what Ameri
cans are like," he said.
Telling of his first experience with
football while in Calcutta, he said,
"It looked like a crazy game to
us. We could never understand
why rooters played more of the
game than the players."
"The thing I like best about
America is that everybody is given
a break here," said Seril Mardin, a
Turkish student at Stanford. Aure
lio Obregon from Mexico praised
California and said that it is the
best, state that he has visited.
John Menisci, president of the"I"
C'lub, described the character of the
club to Lagunita girls, who had in
vited "I" Club to their "home."
"We believe in doing serious things
like international understanding in
a non-serious way," he said.
