MEXICO CITY, March 3 (UP). —President Truman, making the
first visit to Mexico by an American chiel executive, warned
the world tonight that "lawlessness" by one nation might threaten
the security of the entire world.
Mr. Truman flew here today from Kansas City to be the guest

of President Miguel AJernan of the
Mexican Republic. He was received
with typical J*itin American fervor,
complete with loudly shouted "vivas"
and showers of confetti.
He and Aleman spoke to the
world tonight from the ornate na
tional palace which was heavily
protected by steel-helmeted Mexican
troops and scores of Mexican and
American secret service agents.
GOOD NEIGHBORS
The American chief executive re
indorsed in strong terms the "good
neighbor" policy of the United
States toward I«atin America. He
promised that this nation would not
follow a blind policy of non-inter
vention when the independence of
smaller, weaker nations was threat
ened.
"Non-intervention does not and
cannot mean indifference to wha'
goes on beyond our own borders,"
Mr. Truman said.
"Events in one country may have
a profound effect In other countries.
The community of nations feeln
concern at the violation of accepted
principles of national behavior by
any one of its members. "The law
lessness of one nation may threaten
the very existence of the law on
which all nations depend."
"HANDS-AC ROSS BORDER"
Aleman, speaking before Mr. Tm
man, followed the same "Hands-
A cross-the-Border" theme. In florid
language, he professed Mexico's de -
sire to continue a policy of neighbor
liness with the United States.
"The hands that Mexico and the
United States extend to one an
other now can meet and clasp loy~
ally, with a manlike and real dig
nity," ho said.
Mr. Truman's visit produced a holi
day spirit in this Mexican capital
As the President drove through the
streets, dark-eyed senoritas show
ered him with confetti and threw
flowers from the rooftops. Part of
the city was hung with evergreen
garlands. American and Mexican
flags were on display everywhere
As he appeared at the door of hi<
plane, four-inch cannon thundered a
21 -gun presidential salute, and a
band played The Star Spangled
Banner.
