# Firehouse Progress Rapid-- From Hand-Pump to Cadillacs
## 
### GORDON NESS 
Stanford's fire department, which began with a hand-pump for protection for Senator Stan
-1 orcl's stock farm back in the 1800's, has enlarged to four engines, a firehouse, and twenty men
who guard 9,000 acres of land and $30,000,000 in buildings.
The firehouse gang, which is called upon to do everything from squelching flames to rescuing
a cat from a tree, has a fascinating history.
The story begins back in 1880 when Leland Stanford brought an old hand pump out here

from Boston. The next addition to
llit fire-fighting equipment came in
1895 lour years after Stanford Uni
versity opened its doors and two
yea is alter the death of its founder.
■»t this time Stanford University
purchased several horse - drawn
reels, stationary hose boxes, and
leather water-buckets.
CADILLAC TRADITION
These lire fighting devices con
lituted the whole of the equipment
until the year L 913 when Stanford's
lire department became mechanized

piece ol equipment is destined to
lose its prestige soon, however, for
I ire Chief John Marston is ex
pecting a new Seagravc lire en
gine any day now.
The Stanford iire department is
unique in that it is one of the few
lollege fire organizations to hire
.students. Fourteen roughs are on
<_.ill all day. Each night seven of
them report in the firehouse with
books under their arms. They re
main on duty until the next morn
ing.
Every Saturday the firehouse crew
runs through practice drills. The
lower in back of the firehouse en
ables them to work under condi
tions similar to those- which they
would encounter at actual fires.
FIREMEN ARK ATI I LET KS
Athletically, the firehouse fourteen
have proved to be the scourge of
intramural contests, as evidenced by
tlx ir imposing array of cups and
trophies. Just last fall they walked
off with the 194(5 touch-football cup.
But all is not play for these fire
men. So far this quarter they have
been called out on 12 alarms.
They got off to a quick start the
second day of the quarter by re
moving a smoke bomb from Encina
Hall. Two days later the firehouse
crew fought a stubborn house fire
on Bishop Lane for two and a half
hours and then roared over to Roble
Hall to remove a smoke bomb. The
damage to Roble was estimated at
On Jan. 20 they kept flames from
meading to the garage from a blaz
i.ig rubbish container at the Alpha
Sigma Phi house. The same night,
shortly after midnight, they extin
guished another rubbish fire at En
cina. The crew had scarcely re
turned to bed when the alarm went
<><T once more. This time the S.A.E.
lion was aflame with kerosene
oaked rags.
WORK IS DIVERSIFIED
But a fireman's work is diversi
fied. On Jan. 27 they responded to
a call from Russell House to fix the
thermostat on the boiler. It had
overheated and was threatening to
blow up. Feb. 1 Fire Chief Marston
was roused out of his bed at 1:30
a.m. to remove a ring from the
swollen finger of Audrey Newman at
Uoblc., ;, j
Earifei* th'at night ingenious gate-
V-i'.ishers had attempted to gain en
trance 1 to the Stanford-Santa Clara
• ame by starting a fire in a rubbish
can and setting it outside the main
entrance in an effort to divert the
attention of the gate-keeper. The
ruse failed when the blaze was put
out immediately by one of the fire
men who arc always,, on duty at
large gatherings of Stahfordit.es.
The sqehe of the last fire this
quarter was the Kappa Alpha
house. A heater had come in con
tact with some bedding and started
a blaze which was brought under
control with very little property
damage.
A defective alarm circuit brought
the firehouse gang out oil Feb. 4
and 5: Peace and quiet have reigned
since then.

FIREHOUSE GANG, composed of 14 students, is shown practicing
the use of fire equipment behind the firehouse.
Stanford's fire department, which began with a hand-pump for protection for Senator Stan

who guard 9,000 acres of land and $30,000,000 in buildings.
The firehouse gang, which is called upon to do everything from squelching flames to rescuing
a cat from a tree, has a fascinating history.
The story begins back in 1880 when Leland Stanford brought an old hand pump out here

from Boston. The next addition to
llit fire-fighting equipment came in
1895 lour years after Stanford Uni

FIREHOUSE GANG, composed of 14 students, is shown practicing

Stanford's fire department, which began with a hand-pump for protection for Senator Stan
-1 orcl's stock farm back in the 1800's, has enlarged to four engines, a firehouse, and twenty men
who guard 9,000 acres of land and $30,000,000 in buildings.
The firehouse gang, which is called upon to do everything from squelching flames to rescuing
a cat from a tree, has a fascinating history.
The story begins back in 1880 when Leland Stanford brought an old hand pump out here

from Boston. The next addition to
llit fire-fighting equipment came in
1895 lour years after Stanford Uni
versity opened its doors and two
yea is alter the death of its founder.
■»t this time Stanford University
purchased several horse - drawn
reels, stationary hose boxes, and
leather water-buckets.
CADILLAC TRADITION
These lire fighting devices con
lituted the whole of the equipment
until the year L 913 when Stanford's
lire department became mechanized

I hen in 1!)22 the nucleus of to
day's equipment wa.i acquired—a
7."i(1-gallon Seagrave pumper. This
piece ol equipment is destined to
lose its prestige soon, however, for
I ire Chief John Marston is ex
pecting a new Seagravc lire en
gine any day now.
The Stanford iire department is
unique in that it is one of the few
lollege fire organizations to hire
.students. Fourteen roughs are on
<_.ill all day. Each night seven of
them report in the firehouse with
books under their arms. They re
main on duty until the next morn
ing.
Every Saturday the firehouse crew
runs through practice drills. The
lower in back of the firehouse en
ables them to work under condi
tions similar to those- which they
would encounter at actual fires.
FIREMEN ARK ATI I LET KS
Athletically, the firehouse fourteen
have proved to be the scourge of
intramural contests, as evidenced by
tlx ir imposing array of cups and
trophies. Just last fall they walked
off with the 194(5 touch-football cup.
But all is not play for these fire
men. So far this quarter they have
been called out on 12 alarms.
They got off to a quick start the
second day of the quarter by re
moving a smoke bomb from Encina
Hall. Two days later the firehouse
crew fought a stubborn house fire
on Bishop Lane for two and a half
hours and then roared over to Roble
Hall to remove a smoke bomb. The
damage to Roble was estimated at
On Jan. 20 they kept flames from
meading to the garage from a blaz
i.ig rubbish container at the Alpha
Sigma Phi house. The same night,
shortly after midnight, they extin
guished another rubbish fire at En
cina. The crew had scarcely re
turned to bed when the alarm went
<><T once more. This time the S.A.E.
lion was aflame with kerosene
oaked rags.
WORK IS DIVERSIFIED
But a fireman's work is diversi
fied. On Jan. 27 they responded to
a call from Russell House to fix the
thermostat on the boiler. It had
overheated and was threatening to
blow up. Feb. 1 Fire Chief Marston
was roused out of his bed at 1:30
a.m. to remove a ring from the
swollen finger of Audrey Newman at
Uoblc., ;, j
Earifei* th'at night ingenious gate-
V-i'.ishers had attempted to gain en
trance 1 to the Stanford-Santa Clara
• ame by starting a fire in a rubbish
can and setting it outside the main
entrance in an effort to divert the
attention of the gate-keeper. The
ruse failed when the blaze was put
out immediately by one of the fire
men who arc always,, on duty at
large gatherings of Stahfordit.es.
