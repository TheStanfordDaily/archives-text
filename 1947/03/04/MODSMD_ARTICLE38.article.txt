# Anne Guthrie To Talk Here
## 
### 
Anne Guthrie, 11, national secre
tary for the Y.W.C.A., will speak on
"Women's Work Has Just Begun" at
an all-girl assembly next Monday
at 7:15 p.m. in Cubberley Audito
rium.
Miss Guthrie is now on a nation
al speaking tour, telling of the
needs of women everywhere and
how women in the United States
may help the world-wide problem
of reconstruction and rehabilitation.
After graduating from Stanford,
Miss Guthrie served as continental
director of all the "Y's" in South
America and later organized the
Y.W.C.A. in the Philippines. In co
operation with the government she
helped with the education program
for women, which resulted in suf
frage for Philippine women.
Just before the Japanese inva
sion, Miss Guthrie was asked to go
in India to work with the women
in uniform, where she set up recre
ation centers, hostels, and programs
for nurses. She was given the title
of majoi general in order that she
might have the priority necessary
to carry out her work.
When the Philippines were liber
ated, she was released from her
work in India to return to Manila
and begin reconstruction work
there. She was the first civilian to
enter Manila after the liberation.
During her visit at Stanford, Miss
Guthrie will attend a tea in her
honor given by Miss Mary Yost, for
mer Dean of Women; will be guest
for dinner at Guthrie House; and
will attend a tea at the home of
Dr. and Mrs. Donald B. Tresidder.
Members of the campus "Y"
Membership Committee are in
charge of plans for the assembly.
Ellie Brill and Guyla Runvon, pres
ident and vice-president of the "Y"
respectively, will present Miss Guth
rie. All house meetings will be can
celed so that all women can attend
the assembly.
