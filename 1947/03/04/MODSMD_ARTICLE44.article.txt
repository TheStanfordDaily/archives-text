## 
### 
Take a look at the heavens before wandering out to the
Sunken Diamond this afternoon to take in the Stanford-San Jose
State game, scheduled for 3:15. The Cardinal baseball crew ;
hopes to cheat old Jupe Pluvius out of a few licks this week be- j
fore calling a halt to all activity ever dead week and finals.

* In addition to the Spartan game
i slated today, the Indians have a tilt
on tap with the University of San
Francisco at USF Saturday after
! noon, and then will take a two week

Angeles,

l be played here, weather permitting,
on Thursday or Friday.
HAMPERED SESSIONS
Bad weather has hampered prac
| tice sessions since last Friday,
Coach Harry Wolter has been work
j int> the pitchers and catchers out
daily "under cover" and the battery
men will be in top shape if and when
they get an opportunity to display
their talents.
Lefty Dave Dahle and Don Pen
dergast will divide the mound
chores against San Jose State. The
two Farm speedburners are the first
; of the chuckers to get a chance to
go over three innings on the hill, the
previous policy being to split the
nine frame assignment three ways.
The lineup will have Ward Walk
up. Frank McGraw, or Dick Ahl- ,
| quist behind the bad, Benny Cardin
alli on first base, Ted Nell, Bo'b
Peters, or Clyde Dingfelder on sec
ond, Buck Brownson at short, and
Bill Arce at the hot corner,
MERRIMAN AGAIN

center, and Paul McCloskey in right

Winterhalter, Lou Gowans, John j
Wallace, Vic Conde, and Jim Wick
eishaw ready to step in at any mo- 1
ment for regular duty or pinch-hit

Last game for the varsity was a
7-4 triumph over the Boston major
league rookies here a week ago in
j which the locals scored all their runs
in an eplosive eighth-inning rally, i
I A tight defense, featured by four j
double plays, and 12 Stanford hits :
: highlighted the contest and gave
I warning that the Cards will have
! to be reckoned with in league play
j this year.
