Copping scoring honors for the |
1946 season was lanky Don Barks- j
dale, U.C.L.A. center, who was more
than 50 points ahead of his closest
rival, Jack Rocker of California.
As well as setting a new Bruin j
scoring record, Barksdale led his j
team to a Southern Division crown j
and was instrumental in defeating
U.S.C. in all four tilts, breaking a
19-year-old precedent. The Bruins j
also set a new conference scoring
record with 703 points. Previous top j
was Stanford's 634 points made in
1938.
Except for a split with Stanford,
UCLA soundly defeated both Cal and
USC. Headlining the Bruins were j
Davage Minor, guard, All-American j
from Toledo, and Johnny Stanich, a |
transfer from Sacramento JC.
Second place California was led j
by Rocker and Chuck Hanger, cen- j
ter. Last year's All-Coast Andy J
Wolfe and Bob Hogeboom, along
with Bill Durkee, finished out the ;
squad. All but Hogeboom scored

over 100 points during Ihe regular
season.
Leading Stanford were Stephen
son, with 137 points, and Morley
Thompson and Capt. Dave Davidson,
both totaling over 100 markers.
