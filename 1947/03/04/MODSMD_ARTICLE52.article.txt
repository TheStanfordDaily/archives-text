# DAILY EDITORIALS
## The 						Daily Takes Its Stand 
### 
Two weeks ago Excom set a theoretical
dead-line for campus international groups to
"straighten things out." To facilitate this, a
committee of three, headed by Beth Mac Vicar,
was to v/ork with the various chairmen to
direct the coordination of their activities.
When Excom made the belated decision
that campus international efforts should be
coordinated the Daily said editorially:
"We believe in the idea of international
ism that is, something to promote in us an
awareness and better understanding of the
rest of the world—but we are not at all sure
that the present campus attempt will achieve
even a portion of this objective."
(jirrenl Efforts Oiiestioued
It is evident from student reaction during
the past two weeks that the majority of stu
dents follow just this line of thought—they
are uncertain that present campus attempts
will accomplish anything or enough toward
betterment of world relations as far as Stan
ford students are concerned.
Whether or not Excom members realize it—
and judging from recent actions we doubt
that many of them do—the decisions they
make tomorrow night will be important ones.
Even if they decide to do nothing!
Consequently, it is rather important that
all student body members, particularly those
who now with a glazed expression, reply
"huh?" when asked what they think of the
ISC, consider in detail, today and tomorrow,
all the local attempts for furthering interna
tionalism.
Whatever Excom decides could have a di
rect effect on the Row, the Halls, student body
government of the future, probably on the
eventual Stanford academic program, and, of
course, on the A.S.S.U. fund which amounts
to more than $200,000, as well as on a large
number of students individually.
What Started the Movement?
Let us try to consider the whole idea ob
jectively. First, just what is provoking such
a large portion of students to wrap themselves
with such zeal in idealistic thoughts of inter
nationalism? Strangely enough, the need for
such thinking and actions is not self-evident
to everyone. If acceptance or support is to be
obtained, then everyone must be shown quite
clearly that the need exists for such activities.
The feeling which motivates international
ism is the direct result of world conditions fol
lowing the recent war. The necessity for world
cooperation was very apparent during the
war, and because of what a future war might
do to the v/orld, thinkers today are devoting
their full time to trying to drum home to the
average citizen the need for maintaining and
improving this cooperation.
Hack into Our Shells?
But when the immediate day-to-day danger
to your life and mine—as would be caused by
world conflict—becomes less tangible and
visible with each day of peace, then our cry
ing for wcrld cooperation diminishes accord
ingly, and we tend to crawl into our snug
little shell of security and forget about factors
which are tearing down the degree of world
cooperation which already exists.
Thoughts such as these are the motivating
drives behind those students backing campus
international activities, but let's come out of
the clouds and determine just where the stu
dent body fits into the picture.
Stanford's small part can include aiding in
relief, aiding foreign universities and students,
promoting student discussion, bringing speak
ers to Stanford and getting ideas and informa
tion from Stanford speakers, who possess
some knowledge of world conditions, and en
couraging students to work and study in other
nations where their services and viewpoints
might be needed.
Interested persons on campus have been
so zealous in their desires that they have
backed into the program instead of going
about it in a logical manner, with the result
that the small and comparatively insignificant
portions of the program have received major
attention, making very little sense, while over
all plans for campus international activities
have never been formed or presented.
Exeoni Slow lo (10-ordinate Groups
Excom has furthered this mess by giving
unqualified support and financial aid, and has
only recently decided that it might be a good
idea to find out just how these "groups" tie
together.
This job was handed to Miss Mac Vicar.
Before her report tomorrow night, and be
fore Excom makes any decision we would
like to offer our viewpoint of the set-up, which
will probably duplicate in many instances the
thoughts of other persons, and which, we un

derstand, is very similar to Miss Mac Vicar's
ideas.
First, there should be a Board of Directors
for Stanford International Activities.
It would be composed of chairmen of exist
ing organizations: International Discussion
Group, International Survey Committee, Inter
national Education Committee, plus a relief
committee, and, as an ex-officio member, the
head of the National Student Organization.
These chairman should choose from the
student body a chairman of the Board of Di
rectors, as well as a secretary and treasurer,
all of whom should have no other responsi
bilities or direct connection with subordinate
committees.
Board Would Draft Constitution
The Board should draft a constitution which
will state the functions of the sub-committees
of the organization and then present it for
Excom approval.
The Board Chairman would have to be an
ex-officio member of Excom, and would pre
sent to Excom an estimate of costs which all
the organizations would require.
Excom should grant an appropriation to the
Board of Directors which in turn would decide
just how much each sub-committee should
have for its activities.
The Board's main function would be to co
ordinate the work of the sub-committees and
prevent unncessary duplication.
Under this set-up, the ISC, over which most
of the controversy has raged, would be rele
gated to its proper position.
A sub-committee whose duties are to send
official Stanford student representatives
abroad to gather information of value to the
local relief committee, to establish contacts for
students interested in working or studying
in other nations, and to encourage foreign uni
versities to establish similar activities.
Material Ai<! Not Everything
We have fallen into the habit of meeting our
obligations as members of humanity by writ
ing checks, forgetting that material aid is not
everything. We have forgotten that man is not
a machine. When a car runs out of gas, we
fill the tank; but filling a person's stomach is
not enough. If there is ever to be understand
ing, real, personal interest must be shown.
Someone will have to go in person and tell and
show those who need our help that we actu
ally do care what happens to them.
However, this would be only one phase,
and at first not a very large phase, of Stan
ford international activities, but it would really
serve to augment the work that would be go
ing on on campus.
At the same time there would be: A relief
committee that could undertake to aid some
foreign university as well as directing general
campus foreign relief.
A committee to compile information on jobs
in other nations.
A committee to promote and handle ex
change scholarships.
A committee to promote student-led discus
sion on current world problems. This commit
tee could also supervise the work of the for
eign language clubs.
A committee to direct institutes which will
include well-known and qualified speakers
on foreign affairs.
Oilier (!o min it tees Possible
There are potentially a dozen other such
activities which the Board of Directors might
include in its work. All such activities work
toward the same end, but in slightly different
ways, and each serves to bolster in part the
work of the others.
We would hate to see junked what has al
ready been accomplished but if such a pro
gram is to be launched it must be done prop
erly and now—not next year.
If Excom and the present international or
ganizations cannot get together and work out
some plan similar to the one we have just
presented, then student opinion will certainly
smash the present impotent efforts as being
insufficient and poorly organized.
Changes will have to be made and toes will
have to be stepped on in order to achieve a
working set-up- and these things will have to
be done this week, or a fine and necessary
idea will receive a set-back that could be
fatal.
Ilo<l<re|>o<lge of Groups Out
We cannot see endorsing any hodge-podge
of uncoordinated groups, financially or other
wise, which threatens to fall flat on its face
due to student disgust with the manner in
which the work is being done.
Excom and the international groups will
have to meet this challenge before the end of
the quarter if this idea is to survive the refer
endum proposed for next quarter.
