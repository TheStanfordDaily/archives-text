# Prom Boasts Silk, Garber
## 
### 
All the exotic atmosphere of Ara
bia will be transported to the Pa
vilion Saturday from 9 to 1 when
the sophs put on what they promise
will be the biggest formal of the
year.
Strains of sweet music by the
orchestra of Jan Garber will pro
vide a mellow background for the
mystic mood. Canopies of multi
colored silk will completely shut
out any hint of the usual Pavilion
rafters. "We defy anyone to claim
that tliis is the usual Pavilion
dance," say the committee chair
men.
Bids are obtainable at the A.S.S.U.
office for $5, or by sending a self
addressed, stamped envelope with
the money enclosed to Meredith
Dunlap, Box 2773.
