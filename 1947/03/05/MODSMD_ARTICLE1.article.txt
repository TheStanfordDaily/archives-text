International Survey Committee
was formed in November, 1946, and
its plans have been before the stu
dents for more than five months.
Time to time changes have been
made in the plans on student sug
gest ions.
Many students have given thought
to I.S.C. plans and many more have
shown interest in them. Recently
students have been complaining of
not knowing enough about I.S.C. In
spite of the efforts of I.S.C. workers*
many of them arc still in the dark
about it.
AIMS TO hi: clarified
In tonight's meeting Niel Allen
will clarify tlie aims and working
of I.S.C. He will answer any ques
tions and take down any sugges
tions. Students will lie given all
opportunities to discuss theid ideas
with him and with each other.
There has been a feeling among
siime students that they have not
been given enough voice in the
matter and that what they say does
not matter.
Martin Anderson, A.S.S.U. presi
dent, has said that this idea is a
complete misunderstanding. Ac
cording to Anderson, student sug
gestions will always bo welcomed.
