## 
### 
All Enema's miners, cowhands,
card sharks, sourdoughs, and pros
pectors will beat a path down to
the "Eneina Emporium Saloon and
Dance Hall" Friday for the "Roar
ing Fifties."
At 8 they will call for their dancÂ°
hall "queens," wives, and prospects
of the evening in two well-uphol
stered hay racks. Every half hour
for the rest of the ovenine the wag
ons will conduct little scenic tours
from the front of Encina, says chair
man Dick Hughes.
Inside, the "saloon" in the lobby
will serve cider, pretzels, and pre
sent classy floor shows to suit the
discriminating tastes of those just
back from the hills, while others
sashay in the dance hall to the
smooth music of Eddie Kirkpatrick
and his "Washboard Wonder Boys."
Tickets and bids at $1.20 each are
now on sale to Encina men only.
They may be obtained from wine


Stanford's three special student
observers to the Pacific-Northwest
College Congress to be held at Reed
College, March 6 to 8, will leave for
Portland this afternoon on the Bea-
ver to represent Farm student opin-
ion on resolutions which will event
ually go before the UN in New York.
Cliff Nelson, Muriel Lowe, and
Lloyd Hall were the student rep
resentatives selected last Satur
day by the Planning Committee
of the Conference on International
Relations, to he held on campus
sometime in spring quarter.
Stanford was especially invited to
send observers to the Congress in
spite of the fact that the meeting
has been set up for college and uni-
versity students in the northwest
only.
All three of the student observ-
crs have been prominent in stu
dent international activities at
Stanford and are members of the
Planning Committee for the Con
ference on International Rela-
tions.
Miss Lowe came to Stanford as a
student from England where she was
an outstanding sports-woman and
served in the British army for five
years.
Cliff Nelson is co-chairman of the
Conference on International Rela-
tions, while Lloyd Hall is president
of the Student Federalists.
As observers they will have no
official voting powers in the Con
gress bill but they can participate and
express opinions in the general
and plenary sessions.
Resolutions to be taken to the
United Nations will represent stu-
dent thinking on the following in-
ternational issues:
Changes in the UN, occupation
and peace treaties with Germany
and Japan, disarmament, atomic
energy, trade and American policy,
living standards, human rights,
freedom of information and com
munication, and displaced persons.
