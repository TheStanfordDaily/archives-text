Old Man Weather, unless he ,
dumps buckets of rain continu- j
ously for two or three days, will !
not be co-operating to help till
Lake Lagunita. According to the !
engineers in (In- Corporation Yard
only <58 inch of rain fell Sunday !
night, and ..'lt inch Monday.
Such intermittent rains merely
give (he crickets and frogs some
thing lo chirp and croak about ;
since the rain is absorbed into Ihe
ground. About three inches of
rain would probably drown the I
animals and create Ihe necessary ;
overflow.
