# Block 'S' Club Lacks Backing Of Lettermen
## 
### 
"Lack of spirit among Block 'S'
men is our main obstacle,' declared
the handful of lettermen who
showed up for the newly formed
club's first meeting last night in
the Women's Clubhouse.
Out of at least 85 lettermen on
campus, 10 were present. Fred
Bnensch, chairman of the steer
ing committee, emphasized the
need for full support.
Some of the members felt that the
new aims the society has enumer
ated are too petty, and they would
like something more concrete. The
elimination of booing at contests
was given as an example.
The difference in interests of
the older lettermen — the vets—
and the younger men was pointed
out. The vets agreed that they
were more interested in getting
something constructive accom
plished. while the younger fel
lows were more interested in so
cial activities.
Possible remedies for the lack of
spirit were suggested, among which
were dances and barbecues.
It is also planned by the steering
committee to hold an election of
officers at the society's next meet
ing sometime at the beginning of
next quarter.
The aims of the new Block "S"
Society as originally set down are
the following:
1) Betterment of athletics.
2) Molding of student atcions
and opinions.
:{) Elimination of booing at con
tests.
4) Good attendance at all con
tests.
5) Aid in procurement of po
tential athletes.
(i) Development of public rela
tions with outside groups.
7) Elimination of the wearing
of foreign letters and sweaters on
campus.
