# Mothers' Club Gives Furniture To House 110 for Social Room
## 
### 
House 110, Stanford Village, now
has a social room to be proud of,
according to house president Alden
Brown.
The Stanford Mothers' Club last
week donated several couches,
chairs, tables, pictures, and lamps
for the house social room.
Mrs. W. H. Davis, president of

the Mothers' Club, said it was a spe
cial welfare enterprise project of the
club, with the idea of making life
more comfortable for those living
there.
"We were delighted to do it!" said
Mrs. Davis. "We furnished it as
their own mothers would want it."
Over 100 students of the Gradu

ate School of Business make up the
house population.
In addition to Mrs. Davis, Mrs. W.
Rodgers, tresurer, Mrs. A. W. Bren
nan, welfare chairman, and Mrs. C.
G. Vernier, financial chairman,
served on the club committee, se
lecting and arranging the furniture
and decorations.
