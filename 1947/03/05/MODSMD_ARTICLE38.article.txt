### DON DAVIES 
Comes the time for the onslaught
of mythical All-Coast basketball
teams. The Daily sports staff not
t«> be outdone by AP, UP. INS. KSU,
Bill Leiser and the rest has com
piled its own dream team.
Phenomenal Uclan Don Barks
dale, southern division individual
scoring champ, was the unanimous
choice for the ccnter position. "Gold
Dust Don,'' who racked up 108
points in 12 league games, was the
key man in the champion Bruins'
offensive play, and a cool and bril
liant defensive floorman.
Named first string on all but two
of the ballots, Cal s Jack Rocker
gets the nod at the number one
forward position. The Bear forward
who finished second in the league
scoring derby, pouring in a total of
145 counters, was a deadeye long
• I nit artist and a dependable back
boarder.
ROCK FORWARD
The other forward position goes to
little Gene Rock, the SC smoothie,
whose IM2 points earned him Gth
place in the individual scoring col
umn. Hock held the Trojan offens
ive and defensive play together with
his outstanding defensive play and
clever ball handling.

The Indians' amazing Babe Hig
gins earns one of the guard posi
tions. The Babe's amazing fake,
dribble in, and layin shots, and his
root floor play were important fac
tors in Stanford's surprising show
jtH> this year.
The other guard spot goes unani
mously to the second half of UCLA's
Gold Dusters, Davage Minor. Minor,
who earned All-American honors
at Toledo University, scored 114
points from his guard slot, and was
great on defense and ball-control.
Leading the balloting for # second
team positions was the Uclans'
Johnny Stanieh at one forward, and
Berkeley's Chuck Hangar, at cen
ter. The Farm's center, Steve
Stephenson, was named to a second
squad lorward position, with Cal's
Bill Durkee, and the Trojans' Tex
Winter at the guard spots.
Honorable mention votes are
y awarded to Stanford's Morley
Thompson and Captain Dave David
son. and to Cal's 1940 Ail-American,
Andy Wolfe.
SIX MONTHS EARLY:
Footballs will be flying around
the Farm's green-fenced practice
field come April 2. Headman Marchie
Schwartz and his staff will sign
the boys on the regular reg days.
March ill and Apr il 1. in the S.A.C.
football offices. Lynn Waldorf will
be interested to learn that Coach
Marchie expects a turnout of close
to 100 footballers.
Conference rules limit the spring
practice to 30 sessions, so Marchie
is planning to crack the whip five
days a week for .six weeks.

Bobby Brown, who was living at
Encina back in 1942, is making
some real lettuce this year with the
New Yawk Yankees. Brown, who is
fighting for an infield spot with the
Bombers on their Latin American
tour, played some mighty fine short
stop for Harry Wolter's Farm nine
in '43.
