## 
### MARSHALL NUNN 
The SAE's first half start proved too much for Delta Upsilon
team number one as the powerful Lions won a close 30-28 de
cision over the DU's last night to advance to the intramural bas
ketball finals.
Tonight the SAE's, champs of League L, meet an undefeated
Theta Delta Chi combine which also won its semifinal game last

night, coasting to an easy 2(5-13 vic
tory over tho Manglin' Medics. The
Medics of Building 21 (i had previ
ously won the Village champion
ship.
In the opening moments of the
SAE-DU tilt, the DU's jumped to
an early lead on several long set
shots from mid court. But soon the
SAE's, using their height advantage
effectively, took possession of the
lead which they never relinquished
during the rest of the contest.
Throughout the game the Lions
were able to control the backboard
and play under the basket. The
Delta Upsilon squad could not get
the range of the basket during the
first half and 10 points separated
the teams at intermission, SAE lead
ing 18-8.
DU RALLY TOO LATE
Jerry Stanley and Bill Gearhart
led a sensational DU rally in the
final frame as they narrowed the
Lions' lead to five points with one
minute remaining to play. But time
ran out before the DU's could over
come the deficit and the rally fell
short.
