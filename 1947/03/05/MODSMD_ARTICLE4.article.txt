### USE HOFMANN 
Stanford Players and the Music
Department will present this con
fury's first west coast performance
of Von Weber's "Dor Freischutz,"
Thursday, Friday and Saturday at
8:15 p.m. in the Memorial Auditor
ium.
At it.s first presentation in 1821,
"Dor Freischutz," one of the most
significant works in the history of
German opera, served to overcome
the German court preference for
Italian art. The opera's groat suc
cess was not merely a tribute to
Weber's genius but a symbol of a
stimulated patriotism; for the sub
ject, characters, settings and music
are all thoroughly Gorman.
The story, based on folklore, con
cerns a pact that certain individuals
used to make with the sinister
Black Huntsman, in virtue of which
they received in exchange for their
souls, seven magic bullets guaran
teed to bring down anything that
walked or flew. Six bullets obeyed
the possessor's will, but Ihe seventh
was directed by the Black Hunts-

Among the many professional sing
ers who participate in the produc
tion only Dorothy Waronskjold, a
soprano who has concert ized in the
Bay Area, is not connected with

her lover, burdened by misfortune
in tbe attempt to win her.
