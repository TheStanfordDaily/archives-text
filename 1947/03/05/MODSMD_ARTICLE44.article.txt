## Disfranchisement or Representation? 
### 
Excom has set the following dates for spring
quarter all-campus elections:
April 10, nominations begin; April 17, pri
maries; and April 24, final election.
The reasons behind the committee's de
cision to get elections over with early in the
quarter are:
1. Con Home week is April 28 to May 4
and it is desirable that elections do not con
flict with a week as busy as this.
2. There will be time for a thorough orien
tation program for newly-elected officers be
fore spring quarter dead week. No longer
would new officers take office in the fall
knowing little or nothing about what they
are supposed to do.
3. It is necessary to have the ASSU officers,
Excom members, class officers, men's and
women's council members, and women's con
ference officers elected early in the quarter
so there will be time later to elect house offi
cers and choose women sponsors. In the past,
there have been conflicts —decisions on new
sponsors have been held up until after elec
tions; and minor elections came so late in
the quarter that there was no time for these
new officers to learn something about their
jobs.
Although we agree that elections should
come early bcause of the above reasons, we
feel that the psychological effect of having a
newly-elected officer around observing for
over half a quarter is bad for present officers.
But the main objection to the scheduled
election dates is that under our present area
representative plan for election to Excom,
Roble, Branner, and Encina men not moving
to fraternities, will be disfranchised, as room
assignments for next year will not have been
made.
The seriousness of this is that since area rep

reservation was adopted the problem of when
to elect representatives has not been solved.
We feel that although area representation is
not perfect, it is such an improvement over
the former class representation system
(where contact between the Excom member
and his constituents was even more remote),
that it should not be allowed to fail because
of technicalities that could be solved.
We feel also that it is up to Excom to solve
the problem this year, thereby establishing
a precedent for future years, so the issue
will not come up again.
Some suggestions are:
1. Postpone the elections one or two weeks
(even though it will conflict with Con Home
week) so that room drawings can be had be
forehand. Elections would still be early
enough to allow for good orientation of of
ficers.
2. Arbitrarily assign the disfranchised per
sons to districts (even though they may turn
out not to be their proper districts) so they will
at least have a chance to vote. They would
be just as likely to know the persons they are
voting for this way than if they vote in their
proper future districts which would be new to
them.
3. Permanently disfranchise persons living
in Roble, Branner, and Encina spring quarter—
set a policy that would always place elections
before room drawings. An Excom member
then would be a person who does not represent
the persons who elected him so much as one
who is elected on the basis of his abilities and !
afterwards represents those persons who live
in his area although many of them would have
nothing to do with his election to Excom.
No matter what the solution, a definite
policy should be forthcoming from Excom.
The preservation of area representation may
depend on it.—N.B.
