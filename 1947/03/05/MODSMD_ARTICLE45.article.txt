It was Mr. Mark Twain, I think, who said that
everybody talks about the weather, but that no one
does anything about it. Maybe there will be an end
lo that sort of talk now that some scientist working
for General Electric has made snow by dropping
dry ice into clouds.
But will people ever change the clothes that they
wear in rainy weather? Rain garb runs all the way
from the straw coats and hats that the Japanese and
Chinese wear, to the Eskimo zoot suits made of furs
and blubber.
Even here on campus styles in rain clothes have
come in for some peculiar alterations. For example,
you never sec many of those screwy little hats that
men used to wear. Now we run to parkas, field
jackets, and with an occasional rooter's cap thrown
in. All men's winter wear has a decided GI flavor and
coloring to it, for reasons which are too obvious to
mention.
But the women!
Beginning at the bottom and working up. we note
first tlirit the girls wear their pretty (or otherwise)
limbs ericased in long, floppy rubber boots. Then
they don their raincoats, large ballooning affairs
which are not unlike maternity dresses. These come
down to the edge of the knee, or just where the
boots leave off.
As if this isn't enough, the whole deglamourizing
effect is carried to a nauseating climax by the addi
tion of a large floppy sou'wester hat made of oil
skin. rubber or some such material.

Under tliis hideous thing which hides all their
golden curls anyway, the women seem to take de
light in tying a bandana. They claim that this helps
keep the curl in their hair, and that, dampness and
the wind and the rain, contrary to what the song
says, will make their lovely locks not unlike old
string.
But how can you tell? No one ever gets a chance
to see it under all that junk. There just isn't anything
with less sexappeal than an old raincoat topped with
a drooping fisherman's hat.
It's my opinion that someone has sold these young
ladies a bill of goods. They've been reading too many
women's magazines, and they've got the pages mixed
or something.
1 mean, after all, if you see this lumpy, shapeless
thing moving toward you in the rain, it's hard to
tell just what it might be, male or female, animal,
vegetable or mineral.
Why can't they invent something like a furlined
bathing suit or something? It might not be as prac
tical. but it sure would be more interesting.
Or an electrically heated transparent cape? That
would keep them warm, and still display what was
necessary to establish that they were after all wo
men, and not codfishermen.
Yet perhaps after all I'm just being a little fan
tastic. Maybe it is just the rain, and the mud and
So on.
But thank God, it's nearly spring again!
