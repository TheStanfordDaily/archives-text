# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
Dear Sir:
A good deal of conversation has been made this
quarter about the APATHY of students toward stu
dent government. The Daily has decried the lack of
response; the Administration has bemoaned the lack
of participation of students; Martin Anderson and
Excom have been harping continually against stu
dents who find fault with student government and
yet fail to participate in it.
Numerous students have evidenced a definite
interest in the International Survey movement—
some against, some for. Students have NOT been apa
thetic. Last week the Daily reported of a student
who appeared before Excom at a regular meeting
to protest against the ISC program and was told,
rather inelegantly, that Excom would act in accord
ance with its own views and its members would
vote according to their own personal dictates.
This unmannerly and unjustified statement fol
lowed one week after an announcement to the stu
dent body that if the students did not like some
thing Excom was doing, Excom would drop the
project. Small wonder, then, that many students
are disgusted with and disinterested in an organiza
tion that apparently makes up its rules as it goes
along!
It would be well for Excom to remind itself that it
is not responsible only to God. They were elected by
the members of the Associated Students and may be
removed by those members.

T<> the Editor:
Six people have been arrested in connection with
the color-prejudiced arson in Redwood City. The
first impulse of believers in democracy is to hope that
those guilty of contributing to the crime will be given
"stiff" sentences in punishment.
Like alcoholism, prejudice with respect to groups

I
of individuals (whether based on color, physiognomy, I
ago, sex, occupation, name, or national origin) is an j
illness of the mind. In common with alcoholism, j
prejudice represents a fear of evaluation on the "real" !
level. This fear-inferiority complex i*oots itself deep :
in the mind, and depending on the strength of another
fear—that of social punishment—reflects itself in be
havior such as arson, employment and educational
discrimination, murder, restrictive covenants, rude- j
ness, etc. Any of these is a manifestation of a feeling
of personal inadequacy, or inferiority by the holder of
the prejudice: the individual tries to lift himself :
up by pushing others down. Regardless of whether
his actions are within the law (for the boundary is j
rough and artificial( fear and frustration stifle the
victim's personality and make him more unhappy
than any recognition of reality could.
So I ask you to have a impulse. Considera
tion of stiff vs. soft punishment as such is inappro- !
priate in our present state of knowledge in the so
cial sciences. Rather, let us give the victims of<
prejudice psychiatric-education treatment for their j
illness and confine them only to the extent recom
mended by the physicians. We have enough "dead
weight" in our prisons; year by year Ihe institutional
life of prisons fits its inmates less to adjust to normal
living conditions and is maintained only the ex
pense of tremendous human and money costs. Let !
us confine only those patients whom psychiatry in its
present state of development cannot take out of the
dangerous class.
"Preposterous," you say? Shall we as citizens
continue to be the victims of the methods leading to
our vast failures? Our nation spends over thirteen
times as much money combatting crime as it does !
on education. Or shall we as enlightened believers
in democracy have the courage and mental freedom
to use the means which have been discovered to lead
to a new and better world?
