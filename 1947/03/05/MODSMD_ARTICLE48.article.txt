# Job Hunting Book Gives Women Tips
## 
### RUTH DIMICK 
Despite the often repeated claims
, that the only reason women come to
college is to hook a man, many re
quests come in to campus authorities
Ie very day for vocational informa
l tion.
Book after book has been written
| on the technical end of job hunting
I for women, but realistic helpful
hints on the subject are sadly lack
: ing. It was to fill this need that the
editors of Mademoiselle turned out
their newest handbook, "The Made
i moiselle Handbook'' by Mary Ham
l man.
Light and entertaining material,
amusing sketches, and short, clev
i erly titled chapters keep this from
being just something else for the
j already hook-saturated girl to
read.
But the best thing about the man
| ual is that its suggestions are prac
: tical. The author plainly states that
the book is not guaranteed to make
| a successful woman overnight—or at
any time for that matter.
Miss Hamman gives out some
down-to-earth common sense which
! helps the reader apply the rules to
| herself. Women have heard many
|of these suggestions before, but
| they're given a new twist here and
1 serve as a good reminder. It's ma
terial that bears repeating more than
once.
Mary Hamman's approach is
strictly modern. She starts her
hook with a sigh of relief that the
j "good ol' days" arc over when a
woman's place was in the home
and the home alone. Nowadays, a
girl can expect her parents and
even her husband to take the an
nouncement that she's oIT to find
a job relatively calmly.
Yet, Miss Hamman warns few
: girls give picking a job the impor
! tance it deserves. She stresses the
| tremendous effect jobs have on hab
: its, friends, and in fact, the whole
| life.
i In listing some of the hints for
j successful job seeking, Miss Ham
man surprisingly enough advises
using any available pull to get a
! job. "Lucky breaks play an impor
tant part in any occupation, she says.
Her two most repeated warnings
are to be aggressive and to be nat
ural — this "just-for-the-occasion"
charm doesn't go over.
"The Mademoiselle Handbook"
doesn't stop short with the .actual
job. hut covers many related ques
tions such as appearance, atti
tude, how to get along in the big
city, how to get along with the
boss, and even how to manage
j beaus and husbands. The chapter
"Pardon Us, Your Education Is
Showing" is excellent, and "Men
Aren't Blind Either" is sure to open
more than one girl's eyes.
The book ends on an encouraging
, note—"There's no tax on dreaming,
] but it won't come true unless you
i work."
