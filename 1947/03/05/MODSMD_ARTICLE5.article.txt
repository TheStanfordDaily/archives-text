### 
Charged with flying over the cam
pus on Feb. 25 at an extremely low
altitude, a student pilot was yester
day sentenced to 75 hours of labor
at the Convalescent Home by Men's
Council.
Coupeil Secretary Jim Welch said
the charge was brought by a mem
he r of the Stanford police force
when the pilot was observed bring
ing his light, plane so low over the
campus that life and property were
endangered. The charge stated,
however, that the plane was not
stunting.
When questioned by Council, the
student declared that he was car
rying a companion who was taking
pictures of the university and that
he flew low so that his passenger
could obtain better shots. He denied
stunting, but admitted knowing
that he had violated C.A.A. regula
tions on low altitude flying. The
student passenger was cleared of
all charges by the Council.
