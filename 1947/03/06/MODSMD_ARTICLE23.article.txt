# Student Poll To Determine I.S.C's Future
## 
### 
A referendum on "Do You Want \
1.5.C.?" will be held early next
quarter, according to Martin An- I
derson, A.S.S.U. president.
"A lot of people," Anderson said, j
"think that Excom Is trying to shove :
the I.S.C. down their throat. Excom I
is showing its good faith by putting !
this to a vote."
Frank Creede, Excom represen- 1
tative from Toyon, said that "the j
bono of contention i.s I.S.C. Toyon
wants an international organization |
but is against a plan for sending ;
students overseas."
Anderson pointed out that the j
referendum would be restricted to I
the I.S.C. and not to an international j
organization. (See story on the j
right.)
Results of a poll of Toyon resi- j
dents on the I.S.C. question were !
read to Excom by Toyon president
Bill McPherson.
Ninety per cent of Toyoti resi
dents are nyf in favor of the present
I.S.C. plan, according to the poll.
Of t.he 20r> Toyon men who an- !
swered the questionnaire, 80 per '
cent said they thought the plan to j
send students overseas should be '
dropped altogether and efforts con- j
centrated on other I.S.C. proposals. !
Ninety-two per cent declared thai i
exchange scholarships or other j
types of international co-operation !
among students would be of more j
benefit than the present plan.

of having something done to arouse '
student interest in international af
fairs.
Forty - four per cent said they !
bad attended a lecture on inter- !
national affairs during the past year, !
