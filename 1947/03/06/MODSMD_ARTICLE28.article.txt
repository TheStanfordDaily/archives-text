# Kids Like Campus School
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
"Brainiest kids in the district," (
say the other Paly grammar schools.
"But gee, just 'cause some of us
.n- sons of professors and are right i
in the middle of the campus doesn't !
really mean much," modestly stated
Lloyd Carter, 12-year-old secretary
of the student council ol' Stanford |
Klementary School.
One hundred and eighty-four ol j
the "brainiest kids in the district"
tramp off to school each day, un- I
noticed by their 7.0)10 student-neigh
1 Mil's, but always impressed never- ,
thcless by their big brothers.
Close neighbors of the Alpha j
Dells and the A.T.O.'s, the younger |
members of the pink and green j
schoolhouse delight in peering |
through the wire fence at the odd
assortment of Stanford roughs that
saunter along the walk.
I? I. ASK
The fifth and sixth graders, how- j
ever, blase by now to the merits of j
Stanford students, devote their recess j
time to serious basketball practice. I
The grammar school has a good j
chance of copping the Paly school I
basketball trophy, and they're not
going to muff their chances by not
being in form. Even young Dr. Ste
vens, principal of the Stanford!
school, can be caught during the
two o'clock recess tipping in a few
balls.
The BMOC's tin the Stanford cam-
I us drop in importance when com- j
pared with the duties and activities
• if tall, dark-haired Dave Demson, j
!1 -year-old president (if the student j
(ouncil, and Lloyd who between i
themselves have set up a highly in- !
t( 'rated political machine. Besides
his duties as president, Dave holds i
I'nwn the position of editor-in-chief
ill the paper and judge at student |
rials, although he had lots more
1 un last term as prosecutoi 'But it .
vas ti/o small a job lot me Dave \
laled mphatically. 1 had to be
i resident.
Crony Lloyd wields a wicked pen
i .king clown the minutes of student I
council, and as editor of the paper. j
The "Little Indian," the school's pa- j
per, describes Lloyd as "a very
brilliant student." The article was
written by Dave. Athletic Lloyd
stars both in track and soccer.
Dave and Lloyd, Dr. Steven's
right-hand men, delight in showing
the classrooms to visitors particu
larly at 2:15 p.m. when they can
easily be induced to leave their j
spelling class.
They hastened to explain Mon- |
day that one could not get a true i
picture of all the classes because of
the absences that day. It appeared;
thai a new bus schedule had com

pletely befuddled the student body
and half of the children had failed
to show up at the appointed spots. !
POINT WITH PRIDE
They pointed with pride to some j
of the lovely spring pictures drawn |
by their upper-classmen, and gave
benevolent smiles of encouragement
to the tiny kindergarteners and lirst
graders who were more fascinated
by the appearance of two of the
older boys than by their daisy
drawings.
The second and third grades had :
just seen an animal movie and were
engaged in a rabid discussion as to I
which animal they liked best. The [
discussion proceeded in normal
tones until little pig-tailed Connie
tried to impress the class with her
knowledge of the hippopotamus.
The facts came out, but not the J
word; the class roared while Connie i
struggled for the right pronuncia- j
lion.
Dave, prompted by Lloyd, talked j
at length about the serious duties
that were entailed with running a j
student council. The council, run j
on the school's motto, "Where e'er |
you go, the rules you should know," j
is empowered to judge all cases of j
walking on the grass, running in j
the halls, and the like. Punishment j
usually consists of picking up papers j
or weeding after school.
A new development in the school's |
judicial system is a Detective Agency |
which is run by Dave, Lloyd, and
Traffic Captain Kit Dodds, a young
genius at the piano. "We don't j
snoop, just investigate," Kit said.
The agency would, however, like j
to forget their experience during an j
epidemic of missing lunches. The 1
three boys had carefully covered an j
apple and a candy bar in a lunch I
box with indelible pencil, believing I
that the culprit could be easily de- j
tected by the pencil marks on his '

hand. There was only one setback — i
the lunch was never stolen.
TRAFFIC SQUAD
The school's novel traffic squad. |
composed of both boys and girls, is '
a sore spot for Dave and Lloyd, j
"Girls are inefficient as traffic offi
cers." Dave argued. "In fact, they're j
inefficient in everything. Principal ;
Stevens, however, maintains that the
girls, for the most part, are more |
responsible than the boys.
Both Lloyd and Dave are strong
Stanford boosters, interested espe
cially in the Farm's athletes. At the
Stanford-Olympic Club basketball !
game they sat on the bench with the j
players and seemed to have been
greatly impressed by Gene Martin. |
"Now that Gene ..." Dave stated,
"easy as heck to talk to. Great
guy!" "So's Bob Anderson," Lloyd
added. Their only regret was that j
they didn't get Lloyd Merriman's j
autograph last season.
The school is looking outside its |
own little boundaries as illustrated j
from this quotation from this inter- |
nationally-slanted editorial written 1
by Dave:
"THAT'S STUPID"
'"A few days ago I was walking \
across the school grounds. I heard
a boy say. 'When I grow up I'm go
ing to be a movie make-up artist.'
Another boy said, 'That's stupid.
I'll bet you 2 cents you aren't going
to be one.'
"This little conversation is to
point out what is happening all over
the world today. Our country is
having an argument with Russia. ;
Great Britain is having an argument
with India and Palestine. China is 1
having an argument with itself." .
"But don't let anyone say our
school is the brainiest in Paly." j
Dave said. "It's only the best.—And !
I should know—l've been to six
of 'em."

TRAFFIC SQUAD
The school's novel traffic squad. |
composed of both boys and girls, is '
a sore spot for Dave and Lloyd, j
"Girls are inefficient as traffic offi
cers." Dave argued. "In fact, they're j
inefficient in everything. Principal ;
Stevens, however, maintains that the
girls, for the most part, are more |
responsible than the boys.
Both Lloyd and Dave are strong
Stanford boosters, interested espe
cially in the Farm's athletes. At the
Stanford-Olympic Club basketball !
game they sat on the bench with the j
players and seemed to have been
greatly impressed by Gene Martin. |
"Now that Gene ..." Dave stated,
"easy as heck to talk to. Great
guy!" "So's Bob Anderson," Lloyd
added. Their only regret was that j
they didn't get Lloyd Merriman's j
autograph last season.
The school is looking outside its |
own little boundaries as illustrated j
from this quotation from this inter- |
nationally-slanted editorial written 1
by Dave:
"THAT'S STUPID"
'"A few days ago I was walking \
across the school grounds. I heard
a boy say. 'When I grow up I'm go
ing to be a movie make-up artist.'
Another boy said, 'That's stupid.
I'll bet you 2 cents you aren't going
to be one.'
"This little conversation is to
point out what is happening all over
the world today. Our country is
having an argument with Russia. ;
Great Britain is having an argument
with India and Palestine. China is 1
having an argument with itself." .
"But don't let anyone say our
school is the brainiest in Paly." j
Dave said. "It's only the best.—And !
I should know—l've been to six
of 'em."

day that one could not get a true i
picture of all the classes because of
the absences that day. It appeared;

pletely befuddled the student body

to show up at the appointed spots. !
POINT WITH PRIDE

to the tiny kindergarteners and lirst
graders who were more fascinated
by the appearance of two of the

just seen an animal movie and were
engaged in a rabid discussion as to I
which animal they liked best. The [
discussion proceeded in normal
tones until little pig-tailed Connie
tried to impress the class with her
knowledge of the hippopotamus.
The facts came out, but not the J
word; the class roared while Connie i
struggled for the right pronuncia- j
lion.
Dave, prompted by Lloyd, talked j
at length about the serious duties
that were entailed with running a j
student council. The council, run j
on the school's motto, "Where e'er |
you go, the rules you should know," j
is empowered to judge all cases of j
walking on the grass, running in j
the halls, and the like. Punishment j
usually consists of picking up papers j
or weeding after school.

judicial system is a Detective Agency |

Dave and Lloyd, Dr. Steven's

They hastened to explain Mon- |
day that one could not get a true i
picture of all the classes because of
the absences that day. It appeared;
thai a new bus schedule had com

pletely befuddled the student body
and half of the children had failed
to show up at the appointed spots. !
POINT WITH PRIDE
They pointed with pride to some j
of the lovely spring pictures drawn |
by their upper-classmen, and gave
benevolent smiles of encouragement
to the tiny kindergarteners and lirst
graders who were more fascinated
by the appearance of two of the
older boys than by their daisy
drawings.
The second and third grades had :
just seen an animal movie and were
engaged in a rabid discussion as to I
which animal they liked best. The [
discussion proceeded in normal
tones until little pig-tailed Connie
tried to impress the class with her
knowledge of the hippopotamus.
The facts came out, but not the J
word; the class roared while Connie i
struggled for the right pronuncia- j
lion.
Dave, prompted by Lloyd, talked j
at length about the serious duties
that were entailed with running a j
student council. The council, run j
on the school's motto, "Where e'er |
you go, the rules you should know," j
is empowered to judge all cases of j
walking on the grass, running in j
the halls, and the like. Punishment j
usually consists of picking up papers j
or weeding after school.
A new development in the school's |
judicial system is a Detective Agency |
which is run by Dave, Lloyd, and
Traffic Captain Kit Dodds, a young
genius at the piano. "We don't j
snoop, just investigate," Kit said.
The agency would, however, like j
to forget their experience during an j
epidemic of missing lunches. The 1
three boys had carefully covered an j
apple and a candy bar in a lunch I
box with indelible pencil, believing I
that the culprit could be easily de- j
tected by the pencil marks on his '

hand. There was only one setback — i
the lunch was never stolen.
TRAFFIC SQUAD
The school's novel traffic squad. |
composed of both boys and girls, is '
a sore spot for Dave and Lloyd, j
"Girls are inefficient as traffic offi
cers." Dave argued. "In fact, they're j
inefficient in everything. Principal ;
Stevens, however, maintains that the
girls, for the most part, are more |
responsible than the boys.
Both Lloyd and Dave are strong
Stanford boosters, interested espe
cially in the Farm's athletes. At the
Stanford-Olympic Club basketball !
game they sat on the bench with the j
players and seemed to have been
greatly impressed by Gene Martin. |
"Now that Gene ..." Dave stated,
"easy as heck to talk to. Great
guy!" "So's Bob Anderson," Lloyd
added. Their only regret was that j
they didn't get Lloyd Merriman's j
autograph last season.
The school is looking outside its |
own little boundaries as illustrated j
from this quotation from this inter- |
nationally-slanted editorial written 1
by Dave:
"THAT'S STUPID"
'"A few days ago I was walking \
across the school grounds. I heard
a boy say. 'When I grow up I'm go
ing to be a movie make-up artist.'
Another boy said, 'That's stupid.
I'll bet you 2 cents you aren't going
to be one.'
"This little conversation is to
point out what is happening all over
the world today. Our country is
having an argument with Russia. ;
Great Britain is having an argument
with India and Palestine. China is 1
having an argument with itself." .
"But don't let anyone say our
school is the brainiest in Paly." j
Dave said. "It's only the best.—And !
I should know—l've been to six
of 'em."

"Brainiest kids in the district," (
say the other Paly grammar schools.
"But gee, just 'cause some of us
.n- sons of professors and are right i
in the middle of the campus doesn't !
really mean much," modestly stated
Lloyd Carter, 12-year-old secretary
of the student council ol' Stanford |
Klementary School.
One hundred and eighty-four ol j
the "brainiest kids in the district"
tramp off to school each day, un- I
noticed by their 7.0)10 student-neigh
1 Mil's, but always impressed never- ,
thcless by their big brothers.
Close neighbors of the Alpha j
Dells and the A.T.O.'s, the younger |
members of the pink and green j
schoolhouse delight in peering |
through the wire fence at the odd
assortment of Stanford roughs that
saunter along the walk.
I? I. ASK
The fifth and sixth graders, how- j
ever, blase by now to the merits of j
Stanford students, devote their recess j
time to serious basketball practice. I
The grammar school has a good j
chance of copping the Paly school I
basketball trophy, and they're not
going to muff their chances by not
being in form. Even young Dr. Ste
vens, principal of the Stanford!
school, can be caught during the
two o'clock recess tipping in a few
balls.
The BMOC's tin the Stanford cam-
I us drop in importance when com- j
pared with the duties and activities
• if tall, dark-haired Dave Demson, j
!1 -year-old president (if the student j
(ouncil, and Lloyd who between i
themselves have set up a highly in- !
t( 'rated political machine. Besides
his duties as president, Dave holds i
I'nwn the position of editor-in-chief
ill the paper and judge at student |
rials, although he had lots more
1 un last term as prosecutoi 'But it .
vas ti/o small a job lot me Dave \
laled mphatically. 1 had to be
i resident.
Crony Lloyd wields a wicked pen
i .king clown the minutes of student I
council, and as editor of the paper. j
The "Little Indian," the school's pa- j
per, describes Lloyd as "a very
brilliant student." The article was
written by Dave. Athletic Lloyd
stars both in track and soccer.
Dave and Lloyd, Dr. Steven's
right-hand men, delight in showing
the classrooms to visitors particu
larly at 2:15 p.m. when they can
easily be induced to leave their j
spelling class.
They hastened to explain Mon- |
day that one could not get a true i
picture of all the classes because of
the absences that day. It appeared;
thai a new bus schedule had com

pletely befuddled the student body
and half of the children had failed
to show up at the appointed spots. !
POINT WITH PRIDE
They pointed with pride to some j
of the lovely spring pictures drawn |
by their upper-classmen, and gave
benevolent smiles of encouragement
to the tiny kindergarteners and lirst
graders who were more fascinated
by the appearance of two of the
older boys than by their daisy
drawings.
The second and third grades had :
just seen an animal movie and were
engaged in a rabid discussion as to I
which animal they liked best. The [
discussion proceeded in normal
tones until little pig-tailed Connie
tried to impress the class with her
knowledge of the hippopotamus.
The facts came out, but not the J
word; the class roared while Connie i
struggled for the right pronuncia- j
lion.
Dave, prompted by Lloyd, talked j
at length about the serious duties
that were entailed with running a j
student council. The council, run j
on the school's motto, "Where e'er |
you go, the rules you should know," j
is empowered to judge all cases of j
walking on the grass, running in j
the halls, and the like. Punishment j
usually consists of picking up papers j
or weeding after school.
A new development in the school's |
judicial system is a Detective Agency |
which is run by Dave, Lloyd, and
Traffic Captain Kit Dodds, a young
genius at the piano. "We don't j
snoop, just investigate," Kit said.
The agency would, however, like j
to forget their experience during an j
epidemic of missing lunches. The 1
three boys had carefully covered an j
apple and a candy bar in a lunch I
box with indelible pencil, believing I
that the culprit could be easily de- j
tected by the pencil marks on his '

hand. There was only one setback — i
the lunch was never stolen.
TRAFFIC SQUAD
The school's novel traffic squad. |
composed of both boys and girls, is '
a sore spot for Dave and Lloyd, j
"Girls are inefficient as traffic offi
cers." Dave argued. "In fact, they're j
inefficient in everything. Principal ;
Stevens, however, maintains that the
girls, for the most part, are more |
responsible than the boys.
Both Lloyd and Dave are strong
Stanford boosters, interested espe
cially in the Farm's athletes. At the
Stanford-Olympic Club basketball !
game they sat on the bench with the j
players and seemed to have been
greatly impressed by Gene Martin. |
"Now that Gene ..." Dave stated,
"easy as heck to talk to. Great
guy!" "So's Bob Anderson," Lloyd
added. Their only regret was that j
they didn't get Lloyd Merriman's j
autograph last season.
The school is looking outside its |
own little boundaries as illustrated j
from this quotation from this inter- |
nationally-slanted editorial written 1
by Dave:
"THAT'S STUPID"
'"A few days ago I was walking \
across the school grounds. I heard
a boy say. 'When I grow up I'm go
ing to be a movie make-up artist.'
Another boy said, 'That's stupid.
I'll bet you 2 cents you aren't going
to be one.'
"This little conversation is to
point out what is happening all over
the world today. Our country is
having an argument with Russia. ;
Great Britain is having an argument
with India and Palestine. China is 1
having an argument with itself." .
"But don't let anyone say our
school is the brainiest in Paly." j
Dave said. "It's only the best.—And !
I should know—l've been to six
of 'em."
