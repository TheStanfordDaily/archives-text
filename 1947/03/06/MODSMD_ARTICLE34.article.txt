The Administration is still play
ing the old shell game with the
Stanford crew. The crewmen have
searched under all the shells and
have drawn nothing but blanks.
Could it be the game is rigged?
Apparently the Administration is
not even willing to chip in the $1,500
that the crew is asking. The $35,000
n year Cal spends on crew is the
chief argument used to argue
against the Stanford crew. But the
crew does not need and is not ask
ing any such prohibitive amount.
Student Coach Lou Lindsay
points out that a large chunk of
Cal's $35,000 goes to the mainte
nance of a large and luxurious
boathouse at Poughkeepsie, which is
used only once a year. Another
sizeable sum goes to pay the sala
ries of Ky Ebright and an assistant
coach. Still another stack of blue
chips goes to the maintenance of a
large team bus, with a full-time
chauffeur, to take the t -am from the
campus to the estuary.
Stanford does not need a boat
house at Poughkeepsie, a high-paid
coaching stall', or a bus. All they
want and all they are asking is that
the University help pay their trav
eling expenses and part of the up
keep of their few shells and their
small boathouse.
CREW ASKS $1,500
The crew has figured that $1,500
would take care of their needs. But
it looks like no dice—even for such
a reasonable request.
Nevertheless, the Indian oarsmen
are leaving for Corvallis today.
They are making the northern trip
in their own cars and at their own
expense to race against Oregon
State Saturday.
The Beaver crew is returning to
its oars after a war-time lapse,
but reports from up*north ("11 us
the Oregon men have a first-class
aggregation. The administration at
Oregon State is 100 per cent behind
Ihem. How do you think it's going
to sound when our crewmen have
to tell the Oi 'gnn Staters that Stan
ford University has refused to help
them in any way?

BLOCK S' APATHY
Attempts to organize a Stanford
Block "S" Society have met with an
apathetic response. The first meet
ing of the society drew seven out
of the school's 85 or more varsity
letter winners. Tuesday night's
meeting drew 10 lettermen. The
funny part about the whole thing is
that close to 50 of the letter wear
ers showed up to have their picture
taken for the Quad. Seems like all
the boys are anxious to have their
laces sprinkled throughout the
Quad like all good 8.M.0.C. should,
■hould, but when it comes to the
hard work and the no-thanks job
of organizing the Society they have
better things to do.
Fred Boenseh, chairman of the
nuclear group, has outlined its pro
posed aims. There has been some
criticism that the proposals "are too
petty." 1. the aid of procurement
oi good athletes for the Farm "too
petty"? I don't think so.
Is the promotion of greater inter
est in Stanford sports and better
attendance at all contests "too pet
ty"? I don't think so. The Block
' S" Society could do a great ileal
in bettering the sports program at
Stanford. They need and deserve
more than 50 smiling faces in the

points out that a large chunk of
Cal's $35,000 goes to the mainte

boathouse at Poughkeepsie, which is
used only once a year. Another
sizeable sum goes to pay the sala

large team bus, with a full-time
chauffeur, to take the t -am from the

Stanford does not need a boat
house at Poughkeepsie, a high-paid

want and all they are asking is that
the University help pay their trav

small boathouse.

BLOCK S' APATHY
Attempts to organize a Stanford
Block "S" Society have met with an
apathetic response. The first meet

of the school's 85 or more varsity
letter winners. Tuesday night's
meeting drew 10 lettermen. The
funny part about the whole thing is
that close to 50 of the letter wear

taken for the Quad. Seems like all
the boys are anxious to have their

Quad like all good 8.M.0.C. should,
■hould, but when it comes to the
hard work and the no-thanks job
of organizing the Society they have
better things to do.

criticism that the proposals "are too
petty." 1. the aid of procurement
