# Theta Delts Take Mural Basketball Crown
## New Champions Edge S.A.E. Lions 27-23 As Curtain Drops on Hoop Campaign 
### 
Theia Delta Chi's intramural cagers won out over an out
classed but threatening SAE team, 27-23 to win the intramural
basketball crown in a close, hard-fought battle last night at the
Pavilion. The game for the most part was a scoring duel between
Frank Casella, stellar SAE guard, and Mort Bunnell, driving Theta
Delt forward. In the first half it was Casella all the way, as the
stocky guard poured in shots from all parts of the floor and left
the court at the half with 10 points to his credit.
But in the second period Mort Bunnell cut under the bucket to

drop in six needed points and also
made good on two foul shots to pull
tlie game out of the fire. Meanwhile,
the tight Theta Delt zone defense
held Casella to a mere two field goals
in the second half.
SAKS DOMINATE FIRST HALF
Although they held no more than
three points advantage at any time,
the SAE's played a superior brand
of ball during the first half. With
Casella's brilliant shooting and work
under the Theta Delt backboard and
big Bob Thaxton's control of the de
fensive blackboard, they lacked only
a more even distribution of shooting
ability to pile up a substantial lead.
However, Casella was the only
man who could hit the hoop from
the floor, and Jim Brett, who scored
one foul shot, was the only other
man to aid the SAE first half scor
ing attempts.
The Theta Delts came onto the
floor for the second period on the
short end of an 11-1) score, but with
in eight minutes they tied the score
at 17—all. Then it was a see-saw
affair with first one team and then
the other gaining a one or two point
lead.
BUNNELL PUTS THETAS AHEAD
Then, with his team behind 23-22,
Bunnell raced under the basket for
a lay-in and scored on a foul shot
to give the Theta Delts a one point
lead. Bunnell wound up the even
ing's scoring with another field goal
to make the final score 27-23. Bun
nell's total for the game was 11
points.
Dick Stoddard with four digits,
Jim Rose and Bob Thaxton with
two apiece, and Jim Brett with one
point rounded out the SAE's start
ing quintet. Rose was injured in a
scramble under the bucket in the
second period and was replaced by
John Giannini.
The Theta Delts kept their start
ing five in for the entire game. Rod
White followed Bunnell with six
counters, Verne Freeman was next
with four, and Bob Anderson and
Ross Hughes each scored three
points.

Theia Delta Chi's intramural cagers won out over an out
classed but threatening SAE team, 27-23 to win the intramural
basketball crown in a close, hard-fought battle last night at the
Pavilion. The game for the most part was a scoring duel between
Frank Casella, stellar SAE guard, and Mort Bunnell, driving Theta
Delt forward. In the first half it was Casella all the way, as the
stocky guard poured in shots from all parts of the floor and left
the court at the half with 10 points to his credit.
But in the second period Mort Bunnell cut under the bucket to

drop in six needed points and also
made good on two foul shots to pull
tlie game out of the fire. Meanwhile,
the tight Theta Delt zone defense
held Casella to a mere two field goals
in the second half.
SAKS DOMINATE FIRST HALF
Although they held no more than
three points advantage at any time,
the SAE's played a superior brand
of ball during the first half. With
Casella's brilliant shooting and work
under the Theta Delt backboard and
big Bob Thaxton's control of the de
fensive blackboard, they lacked only
a more even distribution of shooting
ability to pile up a substantial lead.
However, Casella was the only
man who could hit the hoop from
the floor, and Jim Brett, who scored
one foul shot, was the only other
man to aid the SAE first half scor
ing attempts.
The Theta Delts came onto the
floor for the second period on the
short end of an 11-1) score, but with
in eight minutes they tied the score
at 17—all. Then it was a see-saw
affair with first one team and then
the other gaining a one or two point
lead.
BUNNELL PUTS THETAS AHEAD
Then, with his team behind 23-22,
Bunnell raced under the basket for
a lay-in and scored on a foul shot
to give the Theta Delts a one point
lead. Bunnell wound up the even
ing's scoring with another field goal
to make the final score 27-23. Bun
nell's total for the game was 11
points.
Dick Stoddard with four digits,
Jim Rose and Bob Thaxton with
two apiece, and Jim Brett with one
point rounded out the SAE's start
ing quintet. Rose was injured in a
scramble under the bucket in the
second period and was replaced by
John Giannini.
