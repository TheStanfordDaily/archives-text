# Cal Gymnasts Here Saturday
## 
### 
After royally entertaining Farm i
hoop fans with intermission exhibi
tions during basketball season, Stan- ,
ford's gymnastic team will compete
in an official meet with California in
Encina Gymnasium Saturday night.
Husky Hunt, Cardinal gymnastic
coach, announced that no admis
sion will be charged for the meet,
which is scheduled for 7:30 p.m.
The Golden Bear musclemen j
should give the locals a rough even
ing. if the Berkeley Gym half-time i
festivities are any indication. Coach J
Chuck Keeney of California par- '
aded an awe-inspiring trope of gym
nasts before the raucous Berkeley |
crowds, who appreciated every min
ute of the exhibitions.
Mainstay of the California team
is Adli Roushdi, star Egyptian gym- I
nast, who has already been a thorn j
in the side of Stanford gym fortunes. I
The brilliant, all - around gymnast
took top ho no us in the last Bear-In- j
dian battle, but scholastic difiicul- i
ties may force him out of Saturday's
meet.
CAL RESERVE STRENGTH
Still, the loss of Roushdi won't
trouble the California powerhouse
too much, as Coach Keeney has
been blessed with a tremendous
stronghold of reserves. Jack Ripley
performed on the 1945 team and as i
a senior all-around gymnast will see
action Saturday.
Meanwhile, one of the best tum
blers on the Pacific Coast wears the
Blue and Gold when Chuck Luc
chessi takes over the floor. Luc
ehessi has worked out with Califor
nia gymnasts since he was a high
school student in Oakland. Thus he
has rapidly developed into a bril
liant member of the varsity by his '
sophomore year.
After surveying the array of Cali
fornia talent, the inexperienced In
dian squad seems to be a good can
didate for underdog standing. But
the outlook for Husky Hunt's men ,
is not nearly as gloomy as the
Golden Bear press would have you
believe. In fact, with the added ad
vantage of performing on home
grounds, Stanford may upset the
highly-touted visitors.
KAHN A DOUBLE ENTRY
Diminutive Ted Kahn, who 1
thrilled the Pavilion hoop crowds j
with his free exercise stunts, will
enter two events under Stanford j
colors. He joins A 1 Linn for the free
exercise competition, and follows up
with hand-to-hand balancing stunts
coupled with Buck Thompson.
Yeoman work is expected from
Paul Freeman and Jerry Stewart,
who are representing the Farm in
three events apiece. Freeman ma
triculates at the horizontal bar. side
horse and the parallel bars. Mean
while, Stewart should collect some
Indian points on the horizontal bar,
long horse and in the tumbling
competition.
Coach Hunt has named Stan- j
ford's squad for the California meet ;
as follows: Ted Kahn, AI Linn, j
Larry Ainsworth. Bob Dunham, PauJ j
Freeman, Jerry Stewart, Lawrence'
Chennel. Buck Thompson, Ward j
Chennell, Dick Hoffman, Bob Gen
try, Don Lindsay, and Don T (, us- i
