# Ringmen Face Cal Tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanford's boxing team, in the
doldrums of a two-meet losing
streak, will make its final intercol
legiate appearance of the season in
the Pavilion tomorrow night against
California.
Coach Clayton Frye's ringmen
are pointing for this match. It will
give them a chance to even the score
! with the Bears, who punched out a
| 7-2 win over Stanford last week. A
victory tomorrow would also boost
the ' Indians' won - lost p >reentage
for the year above the .500 mark.
Elia Long, whose consistently
good light heavyweight outings have
! been a standout of the campaign,
I wrll be the only Stanford entry who
i won his previous bout against Cal.
. Ferris Boothe, another winner in
I last week's debacle at Berkeley, will
! not see action.
The schedule of bouts has not yet
â–  been definitely arranged. As usual,
I Stanford will forfeit the 125 lb. and
I Ijo lb. fights. Coach Frye hopes to
offset this disadvantage by lining
up extra bouts in the welterweight
and middleweight brackets.
Fistic action will follow the Stan
ford wrestlers' match with the
Bears, set to begin at 7


ELI A LONG
Undefeated light heavyweight
