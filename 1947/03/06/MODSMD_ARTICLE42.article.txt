## 
### 
The Cal-Stanford rugby game will
be play oil this Saturday on the Inter
mural Field instead of the Stanford
Stadium as previously publicized, the
S.A.C. announced last night. The
reason given was that repairs are
being made on the Stadium. Kick
oil' time for the Varsity game is 15
p.m. and admission is free.
The Cards will be out to avenge
an 11 —"i beating they took from the
Bears last year in Cal's Memorial
Stadium before 10,000 spectators.
Only tour regulars on this year's
Red team Sandy Atherton, Dave
Hendry, Fred Willy, and Don Li
pelt—played on that 194(5 team
coached by Pete Kmetovic.
KIKiKY RIVALRY

is closely associated with the annual
Big Game loot ball tradition. For,
during the years 1904 to 1919. Ameri
can football was not played on the
Farm and rugby took its place as
the Big Game.
Northern Calilornia and the Ivy
League in New England are the only
two areas in the United States in
which iugby is being played at the
present time. Il is through the efforts
ol the Northern California Rugby
Union, to which Stanford and Cal
both belong, that interest in this
fast and exciting game is being kept
alive.
The rugby team to represent the

United States in the 1948 Olympics
in London will probably be chosen
