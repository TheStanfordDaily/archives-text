Mahatma Gandhi became the leader of the Indian
National Congress in 1920 and changed the character
of this organization. From a party of arm-chair poli
ticians it became a revolutionary party. Gandhi gave
the much needed self respect to the subject Indians.
With a following of literally millions of people he
started his first movement of non-violent Satyagraha.
The Satyagrahis refused to cooperate with the gov
ernment and willingly went to jail. In 1921, he sud
denly stopped the movement because some villagers
had indulged in violence against the police.
The movement and its leaders were suppressed
strongly after this. Out of this struggle was born
another leader, Jawahar Lai Nehru. In 1929 under
the presidency of Nehru, the Indian National Con
gress gave an ultimatum to the British government
to grant dominion status to India before 1930. Failing
to get this, the Congress met on January 2G, 1930
and declared that from now on '"Puran Sawarajya," or
complete independence, will be the goal of India. Im
mediately afterwards Indian leaders were put into
jail.
In order to resolve the deadlock the Labor govern
ment in England called two Round Table conferences.
Gandhi agreed to go to the second one as the repre
sentative of the congress. It became evident at the
conference that Britain had no intention of giving up
its empire. In spite of this the British Parliament
passed the 1935 India Act, according to which all the
11 provinces of India were given Legislative Assem
blies and control of provincial subjects but the Crown
appointed Governor could veto anything. The central
power, including Defense, Finance, Police, Commerce
and Transport, remained in the hands of the viceroy.
Elections to the assemblies were held in 1936 and
the Congress party obtained majority in eight out of
ttleven provinces; and Congress ministeries were
formed in those provinces.
There was another important development in In
dian politics in 1936. The Moslem League had been
formed in 1908 to protect the interests of Moslems
and had so far acted as the ally of the British and
had no following among Indians. In 1936 Mohammed
A 1 i Jinrtah became president of the League. At first
the League drew support only from the reactionary
elements of the country, but soon Moslem masses

also began to support it. By the beginning of 1939
the League had as much support among Moslems as
did the Congress. In 1938, the League demanded the
division of India or "Pakistan." According to this
demand India was to be divided in three parts; one
consisting of Hindu-majority provinces and the other
two of Moslem-majority ones, each of which lay in
the East and West of the former part. These parts
were to be independent of each other. The Congress
party refused to agree to this demand and said that
division of India was against the interests of the
country. But in order to protect the interests of the
minorities, Congress was ready to give complete
autonomy to the provinces with the right to secede
from the center. No agreement could be reached
among the parties.
Then the war came in 1939. The British govern
ment declared war against Germany on behalf of
India without consulting the provincial or central
legislature. This enraged the people of India not
because they were not against Facism, but they
didn't like the idea of being pushed into the war
from London. In spite of this the Congress party
offered to help Britain in winning the war against
Hitler.
"But only free people can fight for the freedom
of other countries," said its leaders and demanded
freedom for India. Their demand was rejected. It
must be remembered that Congress leadership was
in the hands of tried anti-facists like Maulana Azad,
Nehru, and Gandhi. They went as far as to put
Gandhi out of the party and offer military help to
the allies.
In 1942, under pressure from America, Churchill
government sent Cripps proposals. It has been
proved they were not sincere and offered no power
to the Indian people. They were rejected by all
parties. On August 10, 1942 the government struck
suddenly and put all the Congress leaders into jail
along with thousands of their followers. Political
disturbances were put down with brutal force. For
three years people didn't even know where their
leaders were. All over the world the British painted
them as pro-facists but refused to try them in court.

conference that Britain had no intention of giving up
its empire. In spite of this the British Parliament
passed the 1935 India Act, according to which all the
11 provinces of India were given Legislative Assem
blies and control of provincial subjects but the Crown
appointed Governor could veto anything. The central
power, including Defense, Finance, Police, Commerce
and Transport, remained in the hands of the viceroy.
Elections to the assemblies were held in 1936 and
the Congress party obtained majority in eight out of
ttleven provinces; and Congress ministeries were
formed in those provinces.
There was another important development in In
dian politics in 1936. The Moslem League had been
formed in 1908 to protect the interests of Moslems
and had so far acted as the ally of the British and
had no following among Indians. In 1936 Mohammed
A 1 i Jinrtah became president of the League. At first
the League drew support only from the reactionary
elements of the country, but soon Moslem masses

also began to support it. By the beginning of 1939
the League had as much support among Moslems as
did the Congress. In 1938, the League demanded the
division of India or "Pakistan." According to this
demand India was to be divided in three parts; one
consisting of Hindu-majority provinces and the other
two of Moslem-majority ones, each of which lay in
the East and West of the former part. These parts
were to be independent of each other. The Congress
party refused to agree to this demand and said that
division of India was against the interests of the
country. But in order to protect the interests of the
minorities, Congress was ready to give complete
autonomy to the provinces with the right to secede
from the center. No agreement could be reached
among the parties.
Then the war came in 1939. The British govern
ment declared war against Germany on behalf of
India without consulting the provincial or central
legislature. This enraged the people of India not
because they were not against Facism, but they
didn't like the idea of being pushed into the war
from London. In spite of this the Congress party
offered to help Britain in winning the war against
Hitler.
"But only free people can fight for the freedom
of other countries," said its leaders and demanded
freedom for India. Their demand was rejected. It
must be remembered that Congress leadership was
in the hands of tried anti-facists like Maulana Azad,
Nehru, and Gandhi. They went as far as to put
Gandhi out of the party and offer military help to
the allies.
In 1942, under pressure from America, Churchill
government sent Cripps proposals. It has been
proved they were not sincere and offered no power
to the Indian people. They were rejected by all
parties. On August 10, 1942 the government struck
suddenly and put all the Congress leaders into jail
along with thousands of their followers. Political
disturbances were put down with brutal force. For
three years people didn't even know where their
leaders were. All over the world the British painted
them as pro-facists but refused to try them in court.

Mahatma Gandhi became the leader of the Indian
National Congress in 1920 and changed the character
of this organization. From a party of arm-chair poli
ticians it became a revolutionary party. Gandhi gave
the much needed self respect to the subject Indians.
With a following of literally millions of people he
started his first movement of non-violent Satyagraha.
The Satyagrahis refused to cooperate with the gov
ernment and willingly went to jail. In 1921, he sud
denly stopped the movement because some villagers
had indulged in violence against the police.
The movement and its leaders were suppressed
strongly after this. Out of this struggle was born
another leader, Jawahar Lai Nehru. In 1929 under
the presidency of Nehru, the Indian National Con
gress gave an ultimatum to the British government
to grant dominion status to India before 1930. Failing
to get this, the Congress met on January 2G, 1930
and declared that from now on '"Puran Sawarajya," or
complete independence, will be the goal of India. Im
mediately afterwards Indian leaders were put into
jail.
In order to resolve the deadlock the Labor govern

demand India was to be divided in three parts; one
consisting of Hindu-majority provinces and the other
two of Moslem-majority ones, each of which lay in
the East and West of the former part. These parts
were to be independent of each other. The Congress
party refused to agree to this demand and said that
division of India was against the interests of the
country. But in order to protect the interests of the
minorities, Congress was ready to give complete
autonomy to the provinces with the right to secede
from the center. No agreement could be reached
among the parties.
Then the war came in 1939. The British govern
ment declared war against Germany on behalf of
India without consulting the provincial or central
legislature. This enraged the people of India not
because they were not against Facism, but they
didn't like the idea of being pushed into the war
from London. In spite of this the Congress party
offered to help Britain in winning the war against
Hitler.
"But only free people can fight for the freedom
of other countries," said its leaders and demanded
freedom for India. Their demand was rejected. It
must be remembered that Congress leadership was
in the hands of tried anti-facists like Maulana Azad,
Nehru, and Gandhi. They went as far as to put
Gandhi out of the party and offer military help to
the allies.
In 1942, under pressure from America, Churchill
government sent Cripps proposals. It has been
proved they were not sincere and offered no power
to the Indian people. They were rejected by all
parties. On August 10, 1942 the government struck
suddenly and put all the Congress leaders into jail
along with thousands of their followers. Political
disturbances were put down with brutal force. For
three years people didn't even know where their
leaders were. All over the world the British painted
them as pro-facists but refused to try them in court.
