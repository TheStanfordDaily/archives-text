Odds and ends that were left over—Remember the
story about the man who slept through his date and
then called his girl up at one o'clock in the morning
and got another date. Word has reached me via the
grapevine that that wasn't the whole story.
It seems that when the guy called up. he told the
juirl his grandmother had died or some such story.
The girl swallowed it (maybe it was a good story,
well told) until she read the Daily. Then she called
up the lad again and demanded an explanation. Latest
reports say truth still rules triumphant.
Sorry. Mac.

Remember the story about the guy with the big
yellow super Buick. It had stacks of push buttons,
lights, chrome, and so on.
Well, it seems that this fellow with the big car
decides to go to Yosemite, driving (naturally). The
Buick makes the hills all right without taking off
into the wild blue yonder, and arrives at Yosemite
without using landing flaps. He pushes the buttons
and the windows open.
The guy goes skiing, or whatever you do at Yo
semite, and comes back to the car. He comes back
to the car only to find that all the windows have
frozen and the push buttons are all stuck.
So the big Buick goes back to Stanford with all
the windows wide open, and everybody frantically
pounding on the buttons.
Which should prove nature more powerful than
the push-button or something.

Another man (a different one) is riding home from

Palo Alto and passed the Roos Brothers corner. He is
in another car, and so even though he sees a buddy
of his, a prominent BMCO on campus, he can't pick
him up.
Also he sees that the guy is standing with a wo
man, one whom he has never seen before. A day or
so later, he sees the guy on Quad and stops him and
apologizes for not picking up the guy and his girl.
"What girl?" the BMOC says.
"Why, the girl standing with you on the corner."
Whereupon the BMOC replies (truthfully) "That
was no girl, that was my mother!"
So help me, it's the truth.

This story concerns a certain eating club (not the
one previously mentioned here). They are having a
fireside in one of the halls, after one of the basketball
games. It is nearly midnight and the affair is about
to adjourn.
One of the members stands up and gives a long
dissertation regarding the merits and demerits of the
Hall Director ending with several variations of the
aforementioned party's name. All of the other mem
bers are getting a tremendous laugh out of this, and
the guy really doesn't think that it is that funny.
Then he turns around.
The Hall Director is standing about a foot behind
him, putting mental daggers in his head.

Does the new firehouse whistle sound like a wild
elephant in heat to you?
