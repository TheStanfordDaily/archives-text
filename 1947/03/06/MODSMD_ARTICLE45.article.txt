To the Editor:
At the beginning of this week a sign appeared on
the post in the Village dining hall, announcing that
seconds would not be served unless specifically an
nounced.
Now, we have borne up under the quality of the
food here ever since we've been here, because ad
mittedly it IS cheaper than eating elsewhere. What
good does that do. however, it we must go out and
eat AGAIN? We can't get away from it—the Univer
sity decrees that we must eat here if we stay here,
and it makes no difference how many meals we are
able Id get to, we pay for them'all. This amounts in
many instances to paying twice for a meal regularly,
one or two meals a day. And with the latest blow,
which means we cannot get enough in the dining hall
to meet our requirements, we have no choice.
We are told by the University that we are being
fed as well as possible on the amount which we pay.
That may well be. but we are paying 56.8 cents per
meal, and with the quality and quantity we are get
ting that betokens either woefully inefficient man
agement or gross misuse of funds.
If conditions are to continue as they arc now, we
recommend:
1) That we be allowed to eat elsewhere—without
paying for meals we do not receive.
2) That there be a public accounting of the cafe
teria funds- -to find out just WHERE this 5(5.8
cents per meal is going.

To the Editor:
Congratulations on your editorial Tuesday! It is
an excellent statement of the challenge facing the
Excotn? It was strongly felt by those who attended
the Monday niyht discussions that oflices should be
elective, th;»t it should be an organization opened to

student body. There is one point, however, which I
would like to clear up and that is your statement
that 'over all plans for campus activities have never
been formed or presented." On the contrary, both
Niel Allen and myself presented detailed plans for
an overall organization to coordinate all international
activities on campus. The plan I presented included
every point mentioned by you and a few more (such
as a Youth Hostel Committee).
This plan was presented by Ralph Hovis and my
self to the Planning Committee of the "Group of In
terested Students." It was discussed and approved
by this committee. A summary of the Martin-Hovis
Planning Committee Plan was presented in the Daily
and discussed with student-body officers. The two
plans were then presented to all students interested
in international activities at a heated Monday discus
sion early in the quarter.
Agitation for either plan was dropped as a result
of chastisement of both plan originators for supposed
bickering. Actually, the differences between the two
plans revolved not around personalities but around
the point of power or control: i.e.. Should those inter
ested in participating in international activities select
their own leaders or should they be appointed by
all interested persons and not just to persons appoint
ed to committees. It was felt that participation by in
dividuals, the more individuals the better, was an
extremely important factor in increasing interest in
International Relations.
As a result of this wildly demonstrated interest
as shown at the three open meetings that were held,
an Institute Conference is being planned, an Inter
national Discussion Group has been holding a series
of successful discussions, an International Educa
tional Committee has been established, a group is
working on Youth Hosteling, much enthusiasm—
pro and con toward the I.S.C. has been generated,
but. so far there has been no coordination of efforts as
was urged by both planners. However, an Excom
Committee was appointed to investigate the plans
and to recommend a solution. This Committee has
investigated all plans submitted and makes its report
Wednesday night. It is now our turn to give objec
tive criticism and support to the recommendations
made. »
