nounced yesterday by Donald P>.

The Eye Bank will provide a
clearing house for corneal grafts on
i the West Coast. The grafts are used
I in a delicate but now common op
| eration of the eye in which the
| transparent covering over the pupil
of a healthy eye replaces clouded
I tissue in the eye of a blind person.
Time is the crucial element in
; the process. Corneal tissue, taken
: from otherwise injured eyes, or
within six hours after death from

persons who have made previous
arrangements, must be used withing
â€¢IS hours.
The Eye Bank is being founded
with t.'ifl funds received hy the Uni
versify, The work will be done with
a small handling cost to patient and
surgeon.
The University stress"s that only
blindness due to corneal cloudiness;
can be cured by corneal graft ;. It
is estimated that one out of 20 blind
persons is so afflicted.
The University has issued a call
for donors.

School's first "Popular Medical Lec
ture"' in San Francisco tonight will
be "New Eyes for Old: Corneal
