# Fund Head Secures Gifts
## 
### 
Morgan A. CJunst, chairman of the
Funds Committee almost from it;;
inception in J937, will celebrate his
<>oth birthday on Founder's Day.
Mr. Gunst's interest in Stanford has
extended since he attended Stan
ford in Ihe Class of J9OB.

As the chairman of the Funds
Committee, Mr. Gunst was influen
tial in securing donations totalling
$13,000,000 for the University. He
and the vice-chairman, L. H. Rose
berry, have also contributed their
own money to the University.
The Stanford Fund Committer |
was originated in the Fall of 1937 I
by the Stanford Associates, who or- j
ganized in 1935 for the purpose of j
doing whatever they could to further
the* interests of the University. The
Fund Committee has varied in size
from year to year, but Mr. Gunst
has remained at the helm.
Stanford was founded by the vol- j
untary gifts of Senator and Mrs. J
Stanford and has continued to oper-
I ate on a voluntary gift basis. This !
! system is in contrast to the financ- {
| ing of state universities which
I draw their revenue from tuxes lev- !
| iod on the entire population.
Though the original fortune of the ,
I Stanford's was quite large, it be- j
j came necessary to supplement this j
| to maintain the needs of the epand- j
ing university.


MORGAN GUNST, chairman of
(he Stanford Funds Committee.
