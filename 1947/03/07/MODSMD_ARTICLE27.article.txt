## Senator Stanford Undertook An Enormous Project With Great Singleness of Purpose 
### Ruth Dimick 
Tin* night alter his miii died of
In-art failure, I.eland Stanford
awoke with the thought "The chil
dren 'U California shall he my
children. ' This idea crystalized in
(lie form uf a university.
From thi> time on. it was the
sole aim iti the Senator's life to
found .hi institution of learning in
his stale <ii adoption which should j
be equal to all, and il possible excel
the hesi college- in the world.
Site for the -university was the
niagni lieent Palo \lto farm—famed j
lor the finest horses in the world, j
I In- buildings, Stanford thought,
honld have a California motif, so
Ih<- old San Juan ( apistrano Mis-J
-ion loiinded near San Diego In
l-'ather Junipero Serra was chosen!
fo give the university it- form.
I he finest architect alive, I fob- j
on Richards, of Boston, was cho
:-en to do the work. Paved streets j
were provided especially at Mr.
Stanlord's request, and lie person
illv named them after the padres j
who had led the missionaries in
ali fornia.

• Jane Latluop Stanford, the Sen- !
ator- wife, particularly saw the'
need for a university where educa- j
lion would he available to all—a
I 'niversity which recognized no
racial, social or religious lines; and
a University which would and could '
give an equal education to aspiring j
-indent- with little or no money. 1
Ever practical, the Senator felt j
that the university should not be
i*imid in it- structure and that any I
tradition- which might develop at
the institution should be it- own. A j
tew day- later, the first Stanford 1
tiadition—do smoking on quad—
was started at Mrs. Stanford's re- |
quest.
As a special note to men on cam
pus who complain about the un
favorable ratio, Mrs. Stanford
doubted the advisability of coeduca- !
lion and for a while seriously con
sidered establishing a separate girls' |

college adjacent to Stanford it-ell.
However, she decided against it,
j leaving the matter to the Ihiard of
Trustees.
Stanford carried out this project
:as he did everything else —with
I singleness of purpose. It was nec
essary for him to get the State leg
islature to pas- the Endowment Act
of 1885 to protect his endowment
and others of this character.
The remainder of the Senator's
and hi- wife's lives were largely de
-1 voted to the perfection of this great
institution. To guard against any
: possible failure of this plan by death
| or other unexpected events, Mr. and
j Mrs. Stanford provided in their
| wills for further vast endowments
ot the Institution.
The first Founders Day observ
ance, held in ISO]—the year the
1/niversitv opened—. was celebrated
1 with a picnic for the faculty and
1 students at Monterey. This was
j May 14. I.eland Junior's birthday,
i which for many years was cele
i brated as Founder's Dav. Since
i then the date has been changed to
March 1 12), the dav of creation of the
: University.
