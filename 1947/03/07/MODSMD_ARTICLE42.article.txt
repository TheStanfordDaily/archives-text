# Cards Name All Foe Team
## 
### 
Dominating the All - Opponent
team of the Indian cagers, Cal and
U.C.L.A. walked away with four of
the five honored slots. The squad
was chosen at a dinner given for the
Card team by Coach Everett Dean,
Wednesday evening.
Stanford's All - Opponent team
includes:
c—Don liarksdale, U.C.L.A.
I—Jack Rocker. California
f—Chuck Hanger, California
U, —Davage Minor, U.C.L.A.
g—Charley Black, Kansas
With Rocker and Hanger cop
ping the forward positions, and
Bark.sdaie and Minor taking center
and one of the guard slots, the
P.C.C. virtually monopolized the
first team, and actually took all of
the four positions decided upon for
the second squad. The only outsider
to break into either first or second
team was Charley Black of Kansas,
who took unanimous possession of
the second guard position.
The first five averages slightly
under (J feet 5 in height, but the
second four of Stanich, Rock, Dur
kee, and Winter is on the Lillipu
tian side of the six-foot mark. Both
aggregations are fast and boast of
some fine shots and capable ball
handlers.
The first squad is loaded with ex
perience and numbers among its
ranks two former All - Americans,
Charley Black and Davage Minor.
Minor made that honor away back
during his pre-war stay at Toledo
University. Black was a candidate
for "All-of-all" last year, and made
it during his sophomore year of
play.
The fifth position on the second
team was not agreed to by the In
dian hoopsters, and the center slot
was thus left vacant. A rather sur
prising feature of this year's Ail-
Opponent team is that not a single
individual was chosen to represent
the various independent quintets
the Cards ran up against during the
past cage season.
