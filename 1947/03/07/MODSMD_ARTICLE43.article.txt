## 
### 
Stanford's gymnastic team will at
tempt to win back a degree of In
dian honor tomorrow night, as they
compete with the dangerous Cali
fornia muscle men. Encina Gymnas
ium has been chosen as the site of
the battle, with action starting at
7:30 p.m.
Although the Indians enter the
competition as decided underdogs,
Coach Husky Hunt has whipped his
men into shape for a possible upset.
California continually excels in the
gymnastic field, and exhibitions be
tween halves of the Bears' basket
ball games have revealed the flaw
less style of this year's Blue and
Gold team.
On the other hand, Stanford need
take no back seat to the Berkeleyans
when discussing effortless gymnastic
performances. 'On the Pavilion floor
and in their impromptu meet with
the Olympic Club, the Indians
thrilled Farm fans with their per
fect coordination. At their athletic
peak, Stanford can knock the props
from under the cocky Californians.
