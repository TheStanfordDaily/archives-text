CORVALLIS, Ore., March 6 (UP).
—A renewal of the "civil war of
basketball" gets under way here to
morrow night as the North, repre
sented by Oregon State, tangles j
with the South, this time in the j
person of the powerful University j
of California at Los Angeles Bruins, I
for the championship of the Pacific
Coast Conference.
It will be a best two-out-of-three
series with games tonight and to
morrow—and if a third is necessary, i
on Monday night. To the winner
will go the honor of representing !
the Coast in the Western N.C.A.A. j
playoffs at Kansas City.
