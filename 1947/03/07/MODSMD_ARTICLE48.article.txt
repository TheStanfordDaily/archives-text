# Indians Seek Upset Over Favored Berkeley Matmen
## 
### LYNN CARMAN 
A revenge-hungry but somewhat makeshift Indian mat squad
makes its last home appearance of the season—in the Pavilion for
the first time—when it takes on California's rampaging grapplers
at 7 o'clock tonight.

The Bear matmen, fresh from
in the Far Western meet, come into
the Pavilion with every reason to
expect to rack up another victory
over coach Vein Jones' hardworking
wrestlers, who finished fourth in
that same meet Saturday.
LINEUP SHIFTED
The Indians will throw together
one of their hasty lineups tonight
when they go against the Bears, for
the hist minute loss of Bill Hoyt,
their 145-lb. starter, has made an
other last minute lineup change
inevitable.
Thus, the Indians will go into their
final dual meet of the season with
their "record" of never having used
the same lineup on two consecutive
meets still very much intact. This
factor has been one of the main
reasons for their inauspicious rec
ord this winter.
TIIKEE ON INJURY LIST
Winston Mumby and Fred Berry
were already on the sidelines, and
the addition of Hoyt to the injured
group leaves the Indians with just
one more gap to fill if they are to
give the Bears a rough time.
Still, coach Henry Stone's newly
crowned Bear champions will have
no easy pickings tonight, for despite
their riddled ranks, the Farm grap
plers are no longer the same inex
perienced and green athletes who
bowed to California at the beginning
of the season, 28 to 8.
After that shellacking, Farm
wrestling hopes were dim indeed.
But when Jones shook off scholas
tic difficulties and became eligible
for competition a week later, and
when Dave Garst began competing

their smashing triumph last week
[in tlie heavyweight division, the
j Cardinals received the shot in the ;
| arm that they needed. Thoy have
gained experience with each match j
since.
For tonight Jones has named Jim |
| Kurfess to fill Hoyt's spot in the
155-lb. match while Jones will move ]
j up one weight class to wrestle in
| the 345-lb. division. Taking Jones' 1
former berth will be Jim Walker, 1
J who already has seen considerable I
action in that position earlier in the
! season.
If Hugh Mumby. Winston's bro
i ther, can shake off the effects of a
recent leg injury and compete to
night, he'll give Stanford's Roy
i Naper a busy night in the 175-lb.
! bout. Garst, of course, will he hand
ling the heavyweight chores, and
will be up against the same man he j
beat in his campaign for the Far j
Western title last Saturday.
lIENNINGER VS. CHRISTENSEN
Lleland Christensen, the Bear's
destructive 121 -lb. groaner, goes i
| against Stanford's Dave Heninger in |
| the first bout of the meet. Then the
i Bears will get an automatic gift of j
! five points when the Farm boys !
have to forfeit the 128-lb. matCh be

the first time—when it takes on California's rampaging grapplers
at 7 o'clock tonight.

The Bear matmen, fresh from
in the Far Western meet, come into
the Pavilion with every reason to
expect to rack up another victory
over coach Vein Jones' hardworking
wrestlers, who finished fourth in
that same meet Saturday.
LINEUP SHIFTED
The Indians will throw together
one of their hasty lineups tonight
when they go against the Bears, for
the hist minute loss of Bill Hoyt,
their 145-lb. starter, has made an
other last minute lineup change
inevitable.
Thus, the Indians will go into their
final dual meet of the season with
their "record" of never having used
the same lineup on two consecutive
meets still very much intact. This
factor has been one of the main
reasons for their inauspicious rec
ord this winter.
TIIKEE ON INJURY LIST
Winston Mumby and Fred Berry
were already on the sidelines, and
the addition of Hoyt to the injured
group leaves the Indians with just
one more gap to fill if they are to
give the Bears a rough time.
Still, coach Henry Stone's newly
crowned Bear champions will have
no easy pickings tonight, for despite
their riddled ranks, the Farm grap
plers are no longer the same inex
perienced and green athletes who
bowed to California at the beginning
of the season, 28 to 8.
After that shellacking, Farm
wrestling hopes were dim indeed.
But when Jones shook off scholas
tic difficulties and became eligible
for competition a week later, and
when Dave Garst began competing

their smashing triumph last week
[in tlie heavyweight division, the
j Cardinals received the shot in the ;

gained experience with each match j
since.
For tonight Jones has named Jim |
| Kurfess to fill Hoyt's spot in the
155-lb. match while Jones will move ]
j up one weight class to wrestle in
| the 345-lb. division. Taking Jones' 1
former berth will be Jim Walker, 1
J who already has seen considerable I
action in that position earlier in the
! season.
If Hugh Mumby. Winston's bro
i ther, can shake off the effects of a
recent leg injury and compete to
night, he'll give Stanford's Roy

will be up against the same man he j
beat in his campaign for the Far j
Western title last Saturday.
lIENNINGER VS. CHRISTENSEN
Lleland Christensen, the Bear's
destructive 121 -lb. groaner, goes i

have to forfeit the 128-lb. matCh be
