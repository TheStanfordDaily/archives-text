Spring's a ! Jll!<> Laic I hi* Year, Or—
Silling on llie Inside. Looking ut the Outside
Gambling has conic in for more than its lair share of news space of
late. It all stalled wlrn a syndicate attempted to bribe two of the New
York Football Giants' star players, The man who took the rap for the
syndicate was a young fellow named Alvin "The Last Time 1 Saw" Paris,
who is now on the inside, looking at the outside.
Immediately all the politicians and church leaders jumped up and
started .screaming about the public morals. Gambling, they say, is sinful —
and they're against sin.
it is to laugh. Gambling in itself is not sinful; the sin arises when some
so-called "wise group uses crooked tactics. Tl»•-* crime lies in those
crooked tactics, not in the individual wagers. As a matter of fact gambling
is the oldest well, oir- of the oldest profession in the world.
In fact, it is one ol the tew actions natural to a human being, if there
is such a thing at all. karliest history tells us of games ol chance; even
then, some blue-nosed group was undoubt dly trying to quash them.
The very politicians who attack gambling have risked time and money
in their campaigns for election; do they mean to tell us they ran no risk?
11 so. it doesn't .sound very honest. The church leaders allied with them
frequently run bingo games and rallies in order to raise money. Who are
these amateurs, who presume to attack the professionals?

Even il this wcr" not so, gambling can't be stopped. Every time a man
crosses the street he is gambling his life on his chances of reaching the
other side salely. The odds are all in his favor—but every once in a while
someone loses. Or haven t you been reading the obituary columns lately?
When a s!i" 111 difference of opinion arises and one of the parties feels
sure he is right, more otten than not lie will drag out his wallet, remove
the mousetrap, and say, "Pui your money where your mouth is." Even if
one were to concede its sinfulness, nobody has been able to stop it during
the 4.000 years ol recorded history. Who is strong enough to stop it now?
The Old Testament is one of our sources concerning the past. A verse
in Ecclesiastes says. "Of making many books there is no end." Doubtless
that means the place was crowded with bookmakers—commonly called
bookies. A verse in Psalms says something about, "And their lines shall
go out to all the earth." Naturally, all the bettors were anxious to get quick
inhumation on who won the third race at Damascus.
how can anything as deep-seated as that be stopped? It's natural for
a man to gamble: ergo. Ire gambles. It's as simple as that. The ancient
Greeks were affected by the betting bug, too. In Sophocles' "Oedipus Rex"
Joeasta speaks eulogistical!y of "the life of chance." The Greeks knew
how to live.

There was an ancient civilization on the island of Crete. Nobody has
yet been able to decipher their writing, but we have their art; good art it
was, too. From that w? have discovered that their favorite spoi l was turn
ing somersaults over the back of an infuriated bull.
It seems certain that at all such public displays there was a bookie
present, making hook on who would get impaled first—but it was a rela
tively small island, so that when one of the b-'tting fraternity got cleaned
out because he hadn't protected himself on a long shot, he couldn't skip
the country. Honesty, they found, is the best policy, when there's no other
possible course of action.
Way back in the most ancient days lived a babe named Penelope, who
was married to an old s-adog named Ulysses. This guy Ulysses forgot to
come home for about 20 years one time, after starting to the store for a
bottle ol mead and some cut-plug. During all this time Penelope remained
true to him; sho never stepped out once.
Now this isn t generally known, but il all came about as the result of
a bet. Penny s mother-in-law bet her a couple of hundred drachmas she
couldn't do it: otherwise, she'd have been chasing around with a different
man every night and Homer's story would have been ruined.
Obviously gambling has a long and honorable past—but certain of our
less tolerant citizens (they probably are so reactionary they don't even
like Henry Morgan )want to rip it out by the roots. Ridiculous! Can
anyone stop the wind? Or the rain?

No doubt the.-e people who are stirring up all the fuss are fine, up
standing in mi who hardly ever beat theii wives, but their attitude is far
from realistic. Gambling, like Dean Stalnaker, is here to stay. If they are
interested in purity, the\ had much better concentrate on the crooks—and
leave tli'.? honest men alone. Things like the Paris affair give honest gam
blers a bad name, and should he stamped out ruthlessly; however, leave
us not burn down the house just because there's a dead skunk underneath
it. Much more realistic an approach would be to send for a fumigator.
Still, 1 guess we'll have attacks on gambling as long as we have poli
ticians. Some of them ar • honestly opposed, perhaps, but too many of
th em are in th. habit of striking out at gambling just to make people
think they're honest. More than one candidate has had himself dealt out
ol a poker hand so he could make a speech against gambling from the
rear of the train.
But at least they could be consistent. You seldom hear a politician
attack speculation in stocks, which is merely gambling on a monumental
scale. That is considered honorable. You almost never hear a politician
attack pai i-mutuel betting on the horses. The state gets its cut. So why
not leave a poor old penny ante gambler alone, so he can lose his money
in peace?
Gambling, of course, is not productive -but neither is the theater, nor
literature, nor professional athletics. Some radicals would even have you
believe that a newspaper columnist is in the same category. Therefore the
hon-productive argument is no condemnation of the institution of gam
bling. Crooks who try to put the lix on prize fights and horse races are
not gamblers at all. but swindlers. Fight them to the finish. I say, but
leave us poor, honest, stupid gamblers alone.

Even il this wcr" not so, gambling can't be stopped. Every time a man
crosses the street he is gambling his life on his chances of reaching the
other side salely. The odds are all in his favor—but every once in a while
someone loses. Or haven t you been reading the obituary columns lately?
When a s!i" 111 difference of opinion arises and one of the parties feels
sure he is right, more otten than not lie will drag out his wallet, remove
the mousetrap, and say, "Pui your money where your mouth is." Even if
one were to concede its sinfulness, nobody has been able to stop it during
the 4.000 years ol recorded history. Who is strong enough to stop it now?
The Old Testament is one of our sources concerning the past. A verse
in Ecclesiastes says. "Of making many books there is no end." Doubtless
that means the place was crowded with bookmakers—commonly called
bookies. A verse in Psalms says something about, "And their lines shall
go out to all the earth." Naturally, all the bettors were anxious to get quick
inhumation on who won the third race at Damascus.
how can anything as deep-seated as that be stopped? It's natural for
a man to gamble: ergo. Ire gambles. It's as simple as that. The ancient
Greeks were affected by the betting bug, too. In Sophocles' "Oedipus Rex"
Joeasta speaks eulogistical!y of "the life of chance." The Greeks knew
how to live.

There was an ancient civilization on the island of Crete. Nobody has
yet been able to decipher their writing, but we have their art; good art it
was, too. From that w? have discovered that their favorite spoi l was turn
ing somersaults over the back of an infuriated bull.
It seems certain that at all such public displays there was a bookie
present, making hook on who would get impaled first—but it was a rela
tively small island, so that when one of the b-'tting fraternity got cleaned
out because he hadn't protected himself on a long shot, he couldn't skip
the country. Honesty, they found, is the best policy, when there's no other
possible course of action.
Way back in the most ancient days lived a babe named Penelope, who
was married to an old s-adog named Ulysses. This guy Ulysses forgot to
come home for about 20 years one time, after starting to the store for a
bottle ol mead and some cut-plug. During all this time Penelope remained
true to him; sho never stepped out once.
Now this isn t generally known, but il all came about as the result of
a bet. Penny s mother-in-law bet her a couple of hundred drachmas she
couldn't do it: otherwise, she'd have been chasing around with a different
man every night and Homer's story would have been ruined.
Obviously gambling has a long and honorable past—but certain of our
less tolerant citizens (they probably are so reactionary they don't even
like Henry Morgan )want to rip it out by the roots. Ridiculous! Can
anyone stop the wind? Or the rain?

No doubt the.-e people who are stirring up all the fuss are fine, up

interested in purity, the\ had much better concentrate on the crooks—and
leave tli'.? honest men alone. Things like the Paris affair give honest gam
blers a bad name, and should he stamped out ruthlessly; however, leave
us not burn down the house just because there's a dead skunk underneath
it. Much more realistic an approach would be to send for a fumigator.
Still, 1 guess we'll have attacks on gambling as long as we have poli
ticians. Some of them ar • honestly opposed, perhaps, but too many of
th em are in th. habit of striking out at gambling just to make people
think they're honest. More than one candidate has had himself dealt out
ol a poker hand so he could make a speech against gambling from the
rear of the train.
But at least they could be consistent. You seldom hear a politician
attack speculation in stocks, which is merely gambling on a monumental
scale. That is considered honorable. You almost never hear a politician
attack pai i-mutuel betting on the horses. The state gets its cut. So why
not leave a poor old penny ante gambler alone, so he can lose his money
in peace?
Gambling, of course, is not productive -but neither is the theater, nor
literature, nor professional athletics. Some radicals would even have you
believe that a newspaper columnist is in the same category. Therefore the
hon-productive argument is no condemnation of the institution of gam
bling. Crooks who try to put the lix on prize fights and horse races are
not gamblers at all. but swindlers. Fight them to the finish. I say, but

Even il this wcr" not so, gambling can't be stopped. Every time a man

other side salely. The odds are all in his favor—but every once in a while
someone loses. Or haven t you been reading the obituary columns lately?
When a s!i" 111 difference of opinion arises and one of the parties feels
sure he is right, more otten than not lie will drag out his wallet, remove
the mousetrap, and say, "Pui your money where your mouth is." Even if
one were to concede its sinfulness, nobody has been able to stop it during
the 4.000 years ol recorded history. Who is strong enough to stop it now?
The Old Testament is one of our sources concerning the past. A verse
in Ecclesiastes says. "Of making many books there is no end." Doubtless
that means the place was crowded with bookmakers—commonly called
bookies. A verse in Psalms says something about, "And their lines shall
go out to all the earth." Naturally, all the bettors were anxious to get quick
inhumation on who won the third race at Damascus.
how can anything as deep-seated as that be stopped? It's natural for
a man to gamble: ergo. Ire gambles. It's as simple as that. The ancient
Greeks were affected by the betting bug, too. In Sophocles' "Oedipus Rex"
Joeasta speaks eulogistical!y of "the life of chance." The Greeks knew

There was an ancient civilization on the island of Crete. Nobody has
yet been able to decipher their writing, but we have their art; good art it
was, too. From that w? have discovered that their favorite spoi l was turn
ing somersaults over the back of an infuriated bull.
It seems certain that at all such public displays there was a bookie
present, making hook on who would get impaled first—but it was a rela
tively small island, so that when one of the b-'tting fraternity got cleaned
out because he hadn't protected himself on a long shot, he couldn't skip
the country. Honesty, they found, is the best policy, when there's no other
possible course of action.
Way back in the most ancient days lived a babe named Penelope, who
was married to an old s-adog named Ulysses. This guy Ulysses forgot to
come home for about 20 years one time, after starting to the store for a
bottle ol mead and some cut-plug. During all this time Penelope remained
true to him; sho never stepped out once.
Now this isn t generally known, but il all came about as the result of
a bet. Penny s mother-in-law bet her a couple of hundred drachmas she
couldn't do it: otherwise, she'd have been chasing around with a different
man every night and Homer's story would have been ruined.
Obviously gambling has a long and honorable past—but certain of our
less tolerant citizens (they probably are so reactionary they don't even
like Henry Morgan )want to rip it out by the roots. Ridiculous! Can
anyone stop the wind? Or the rain?

No doubt the.-e people who are stirring up all the fuss are fine, up

interested in purity, the\ had much better concentrate on the crooks—and
leave tli'.? honest men alone. Things like the Paris affair give honest gam
blers a bad name, and should he stamped out ruthlessly; however, leave
us not burn down the house just because there's a dead skunk underneath
it. Much more realistic an approach would be to send for a fumigator.
Still, 1 guess we'll have attacks on gambling as long as we have poli
ticians. Some of them ar • honestly opposed, perhaps, but too many of
th em are in th. habit of striking out at gambling just to make people
think they're honest. More than one candidate has had himself dealt out
ol a poker hand so he could make a speech against gambling from the
rear of the train.
But at least they could be consistent. You seldom hear a politician
attack speculation in stocks, which is merely gambling on a monumental
scale. That is considered honorable. You almost never hear a politician
attack pai i-mutuel betting on the horses. The state gets its cut. So why
not leave a poor old penny ante gambler alone, so he can lose his money
in peace?
Gambling, of course, is not productive -but neither is the theater, nor
literature, nor professional athletics. Some radicals would even have you
believe that a newspaper columnist is in the same category. Therefore the
hon-productive argument is no condemnation of the institution of gam
bling. Crooks who try to put the lix on prize fights and horse races are
not gamblers at all. but swindlers. Fight them to the finish. I say, but
