# Cal Invades Farm Tomorrow For 'Big Game' With Ruggers
## 
### BILL HACHTEN 
Those Golden Bears from Berkeley, still flush from last week's
basketball victorys, invade the Farm Saturday afternoon to meet
Stanford's rugby team on the Intramural Field at 3:00 p.m.
A preliminary game between the Cal and Cara Reserves will
be played at 1:30 p.m. Admission for both games is free.

Coaches Willard Classen and Jim
Wvlie expressed the sentiments of
the Stanford squad when they said:
"We think we have a very good
chance of winning and will be disap
pointed if we don't. '
CARDS POLISH OFFENSE
The team put the finishing touches
on their offense in last night's prac
tice and are ready to play their
best game of the year. Sabin Slur
levant and John Hopwood are tlu
only players who are definitely out
of tomorrow's contest due to in
juries.
The game will probably be de
cided in the scrum since the Bears
boast a forward wall that is big.
rugged, and aggressive. Seven of
California's starters starred (?) on
the gridiron for the Bears last fall.
Probably their biggest "name' player
is Ed Welch, the ASUC student body
president, who plays in the backtield
and does all the kicking tor the
extra points and penalty kicks.
Other players from the gridiron are
Bill Witter, Nate Shore, Ira Thomp
son, Ken Grolsema and Donn Doerr.
DENTIST COACHES BEAKS
The Bears are coached by Dr.
Miles Hudson, a dentist. They have
been practicing since before Christ
mas and are in good physical condi
tion. The game will be officiated by
Don Howe.
Stanford's starting fifteen was an
nounced last night by the coaching
stall. Jn the scrum, lrv Dentoni and
John McDonnell will be in the first
rank, Bob Kinsinger at hook. John
Kerman and John Rosekrans in the
second rank, and Marty Feldman
.jiui Ray Sliirey at breakaways.
In the haekfield, the two key pos
itions of scrum half and wing forward
will be playea by Dob Brodie and
Louis Sloss, respectively. Brodie's
Kicking, both on tree kicks and dur
ing play, has been the standout of
the Indian offense.
LI PELT AND WILLEY STAR
Den Lipelt, shifty back, will start
at first five-eighths. Field at second
five-eights, and big Fred Willey at
center three-quarters. A 1 Morris
and Af Turriziani will be at the
wings and steady Jack Reynolds,
whose deadly tackling has preventeu
many a score this year, will be at
lullback. At Thursday night's prac

| lice, Mickey Titus, right half from
, the football team was working out
I at wing and will probably play to
! morrow.
The only opponent of both teams
| lias been the University Club. Last
I Saturday, Cal beat the Club. 14-0,
and, the week before, Stanford won
1 22- !. However, it was a mdc'n
, stronger University Club, reinforced
! by five Cal ineligible*, that played
; the Bears.
Tin: sckum scours
rwo of Cal s scores were made by
the scrum, which indicates the po
tcnce of their forwards. A more om
inous I act i.s that the Cal reserves,
| who play the Farm reserves in the
, preliminary, were only (i-0,
by the Olympic Club. The Olympi
ans, it is recalled, defeated our var
sity, 12-3.
A victory over Cal tomorrow would
I turn Stanford's fair season into a
successful one. To date, the Cards
; have won three games and lost
| three.


Ered WILLEY. renter three-quarters on the rugln team, will he
"gunning for b'ar" when' Stanford lines up against Cal tomorrow. To
see big Fred and his teammates in action in their last game litis year,
come out to the Intramural Field at 3 p.m. and watch the fireworks.
It's sure to lie interesting. â€”Photo by Boh Dillon
