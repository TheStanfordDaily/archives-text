# Busy Card Baseball Team Meets Spartans and Dons
## 
### 
Two games remain on tap for the
Farm's promising baseball squad
this week before the boys begin a
wo-week sojourn from the horse
hide to unravel the mysteries of
academic life. San Jose State's
Spartans face the Cards at 3:15 to
day on the Sunken Diamond in the
first of the contests, a rescheduling
of Tuesday's game.
Tomorrow afternoon it'll be the
Stanford at 2:30 on the local battle
ground. The Dons, unlimbering their
big bats, trounced the Alameda Na
val Air Station 'J-o for their first
win Wednesday.
Harry Wolter's charges buckle
down to serious competition during
vacation week. The squad plays the
Stanford Alumni March 22, and
then has a live-game road trip be
ginning with a brace of engagements
carded against Southern California
at Bovard Field on the 24th and
25th. The tour continues the 27th
and 28th against the U.C.L.A. Bruins
at Westwood, and winds up en route
home with an exhibition against the
State College Gauchos at Santa
Barbara.
Heading the pitching staff are lfMo
lettermen Dick Flatland and Larry
Wolf, '42 varsity ehucker Don Pen
dergrass. '42 frosh numeralman Bill
Brokaw, last fall's grid star Chuck
Wakefield, and a quintet of smooth
operating frosh--Dave Dahle, Dave
Stott, Claude Rosenberg, Frank La-

Brum, and Forrest Shumway. Dahle
and Pendergrass are the only south
paws in the group.
Following the road trip, the Cards
tackle Fullerton J.C. and Cal on the
Stanford Diamond during Reg week.
From then until the season closes
May 31 at Berkeley, the Injuns have
a steady diet of action, 16 games
already scheduled for this nine week
period and more on the fire.
