## Building a World Instead of a Tower 
### 
Thoughts on leaving the Ivory Tower.
Current interest and discussion of interna
tional activities at Stanford are an encourag
ing sign that "One World" was not just the
title of a book, that on this campus at least there
is an awareness that stands on the verge of
action.
Are we in danger of forgetting, though,
that democracy begins at home, that princi
pies of social justice and respect for human
rights essential if any "one world" is to be
a worthwhile world —are not yet enjoyed
by all peoples even in the United States?
This is no plea for isolationism but only a
suggestion that the Stanford student cannot
give all his interest and activity to the inter
national scene with any hope of success with
out matching it with an equal effort on the
local and national level.
Confucius placed the responsibility for
world peace with the individual—as do cur
rent campus internationalists—but he included
a few intermediary steps that can not be over
looked.
He said that world peace through coop
oration is impossible until there is peace and
harmony within the nation, that this cannot

be achieved until there is peace within the
family, and that this is impossible until all is
set right within the heart ol the individual.
The hope for permanent world peace, then,
begins with the individual and broadens out
to include all nations and people. We at Stan
ford have enlarged our thinking to one of in
ternational scope, but some of us in our awak
ening to the new horizon overseas may be
forgetting old responsibilities at home.
In some sections of France one-half of school
age children have tuberculosis. But in Mis
sissippi there is suffering of another kind,
where suppression and illiteracy mar the lives
of thousands of negroes.
The French school children and the Mis
sissippi negroes are part of one humanity,
just where our responsibilities lie in respect
to each is an intricate and complicated so
cial problem. But one fact stands clear—
that neither can be forgotten; BOTH stand in
need of our interest and aid.
If our campus international activities are
aimed at giving, not getting, if they can serve
all humanity, not just peoples overseas, then
Stanford will have begun to build its share of
"one world."
Instead of an Ivory Tower.—B.H.

In some sections of France one-half of school
age children have tuberculosis. But in Mis
sissippi there is suffering of another kind,
where suppression and illiteracy mar the lives
of thousands of negroes.
The French school children and the Mis
sissippi negroes are part of one humanity,
just where our responsibilities lie in respect
to each is an intricate and complicated so
cial problem. But one fact stands clear—
that neither can be forgotten; BOTH stand in
need of our interest and aid.
If our campus international activities are
aimed at giving, not getting, if they can serve
all humanity, not just peoples overseas, then
Stanford will have begun to build its share of
"one world."
Instead of an Ivory Tower.—B.H.
