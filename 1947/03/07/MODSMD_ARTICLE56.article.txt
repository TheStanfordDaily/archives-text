### DAN ENDSLEY 
Congress must soon consider the Bullwinkle-Reed
hill. This piece of legislation is designed to exempt
the railroads from the provisions of the Sherman
Anti-Trust act and its complementing Clayton act.
In other words, the railroads would be allowed to
make agreements among themselves which normally
would he considered combinations in restraint of
I rude.
Undoubtedly there will be a great deal of opposi
tion, both from within Congress and from lobbies.
The United States has a long history of opposition to
anything which smacks of monopoly; free enterprise
has always been the watch word.
That is not a very realistic attitude. Some indus
tries —by their very natures —should be monopolies;
efficiency demands a monopolistic organization.
Heavy industry—that is. industry calling for a gi
gantie original outlay of capital-—which operates on
a nation-wide scale falls in this category. The greater
the output, the smaller will be average cost per unit
of the product. There is a point of diminishing re
turns. but it is so high that it is not a factor.
The railroads are such an industry. Their most
eflicient form of operation would be as one vast,
co-ordinated corporation—public or private.
There is also another point to consider. Rail transit
does not flourish under competition. Take the case
of two cities which want a rail connection. There
might be enough freight and passenger traflic to
support more than one line, but not enough to sup
port two and nobody has yet been able to build a
railroad and a half.
The larger the operating units of a corporation,
the less able is that, corporation to withstand com
petition. It doesn't mean that the weakest of the
competitors will be forced out of business; it's much
more likely that the whole industry will suffer.
Hail transit is a declining industry—both relatively
and absolutely. Not only are the railroads failing to

keep pace with the rest of the economy; there are
actually fewer miles of track than there were in
1!) L'(). The only country in the world where new lines
are being built is Soviet Russia; the railroads could
best stand up under competition there—but of course
there isn't any.
Most countries on the continent of Europe have
solved the problem by nationalization. That is one
obvious solution; in the years before World War II
more than half the private roads in the world—in
cluding those in the United States—were in receiv
ership. Now that the bonanza mined during the war
is worked out. the same thing undoubtedly will hap
pen again.
Therefore it's obvious that something must be
done; any nation lacking a strong, healthy railroad
industry is necessarily crippled. But the BulKvinkle-
Rped bill would allow railroad tycoons to set up a
monopolist ic or rather oligopolistic—organization.
Such a concentration of economic power in a few
hands is dangerous—even if the motives of the power
wielders are pure.
Two courses are open. First, the railroads could be
nationalized—but that seems hardly likely under the
American system. The alternative is to allow a com
plete integration of the roads under private lead
ership—but under a stringent social inspection and
control. The railroads are so important to the na
tional economy that it would be unthinkable to
allow the slightest mismanagement—even though
they are private property.
Something must be done if the rail transit indus
try is lo remain healthy; however, the BullwinkJe-
Reed bill is not enough. If the anti-trust laws are
to be suspended in favor of the railroads, a powerful
board must first be set up as a safeguard—a power
ful board comprised of HONEST. COMPETENT
men; not political hacks, not tools of the railroads.
The public welfare demands it.
