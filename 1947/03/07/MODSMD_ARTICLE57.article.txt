# BULL SESSION

### CARL HEINTZE 
You II pardon me if this is a little maudlin and
sad. It seems that one gets the habit of always
looking backward and seeing what lies behind him
and then painting it all in golden colors and calling
il "the good old days."
D<> to an unfortunate failing of mine. 1 have
been able to pass enough courses and garner enough
units so that graduation from this sunny clime can
no longer be postponed. Self-respect (and my bank
roll) demand that I get out and earn a living from
now on.
So here I sit, looking back over four years of
going to classes, taking mid-terms and finals, getting
grade envelopes, sweating out Reg day lines, and
doing all the one hundred and one other things that
a Stanford student has to do.
All of the merr Vies of Encina days, freshman
incredulity at Western Civ. the first spring quarter,
Krankie Albert and the T. waterbagging the passing
ears after the games, and the dirty water in the
Mandarin Cafe sink are just memories now.
The days of the first black-outs, the scare of
IVarl Harbor, the big line of bull that the Army
handed you before you signed on the dotted line,
and the time that you came back just for a week
end to see the Farm in wartime are all behind me.
And the wonderful feeling you had when you
saw the Quad again in the spring and the war was all
over for sure, and you were a civilian once more,
and how good it was to feel a book instead ol a
shovel or rifle in your hand, and how you knew
everyone's face, but just couldn't remember the
name are all things that have just now passed into
my memory.
Well, they are all over and down the drain now,
to be talked about and remembered but not to be

mounted for. I ant an alumni with whatever privi
leges and immunities that entitles me to.
Naturally. 1 think that Stanford is a great, place,
and one of the best schools in the country. It is my
Alma Mater, silly as those two words sound, and I'd
like to see it become the best school in the country.
The purpose of a university is to educate, and I
think I got a smattering of ignorance while I was
here. I learned how to live with other people,
how to think, what to believe in, and what, not to
believe in.
I also learned how to goof off, how to have fun.
and I. learned a lot of things that I'll probably for
get
And as an almost former Stanford man, I'd like
to see my school take more interest in getting good
educators here, and less in worrying about the admin
istration of the school.
I'd like to see Stanford take a lend in promoting
some sort of international institute with a long range
plan in view. I'd like to see the veteran get a fair
deal all the way around,
I'd like Stanford to find some way to get a lower
tuition through aid from the State of California if
necessary. If they can't do that, I'd like to see them
TAKE that last nickel and end all this foolishness.
I'd like lo see Stanford always keeps its Honor
Code, for it is one of the •greatest, things about this
school.
Mostly, I'd like to see Stanford existing like it
always has as a community of learning, free and
democratic. With maybe a few more dormitories for
the men.
That's about all. Thanks for looking at this space in
the mornings. Don't think it ain't been grand, cause
it has.

now on.
So here I sit, looking back over four years of
going to classes, taking mid-terms and finals, getting
grade envelopes, sweating out Reg day lines, and
doing all the one hundred and one other things that
a Stanford student has to do.
All of the merr Vies of Encina days, freshman
incredulity at Western Civ. the first spring quarter,
Krankie Albert and the T. waterbagging the passing
ears after the games, and the dirty water in the
Mandarin Cafe sink are just memories now.
The days of the first black-outs, the scare of
IVarl Harbor, the big line of bull that the Army
handed you before you signed on the dotted line,
and the time that you came back just for a week
end to see the Farm in wartime are all behind me.
And the wonderful feeling you had when you
saw the Quad again in the spring and the war was all
over for sure, and you were a civilian once more,
and how good it was to feel a book instead ol a
shovel or rifle in your hand, and how you knew
everyone's face, but just couldn't remember the
name are all things that have just now passed into
my memory.
Well, they are all over and down the drain now,
to be talked about and remembered but not to be

mounted for. I ant an alumni with whatever privi
leges and immunities that entitles me to.
Naturally. 1 think that Stanford is a great, place,
and one of the best schools in the country. It is my
Alma Mater, silly as those two words sound, and I'd
like to see it become the best school in the country.
The purpose of a university is to educate, and I
think I got a smattering of ignorance while I was
here. I learned how to live with other people,
how to think, what to believe in, and what, not to
believe in.
I also learned how to goof off, how to have fun.
and I. learned a lot of things that I'll probably for
get
And as an almost former Stanford man, I'd like
to see my school take more interest in getting good
educators here, and less in worrying about the admin
istration of the school.
I'd like to see Stanford take a lend in promoting
some sort of international institute with a long range
plan in view. I'd like to see the veteran get a fair
deal all the way around,
I'd like Stanford to find some way to get a lower
tuition through aid from the State of California if
necessary. If they can't do that, I'd like to see them
TAKE that last nickel and end all this foolishness.
I'd like lo see Stanford always keeps its Honor
Code, for it is one of the •greatest, things about this
school.
Mostly, I'd like to see Stanford existing like it
always has as a community of learning, free and
democratic. With maybe a few more dormitories for
the men.
That's about all. Thanks for looking at this space in
the mornings. Don't think it ain't been grand, cause
it has.
You II pardon me if this is a little maudlin and
sad. It seems that one gets the habit of always
looking backward and seeing what lies behind him
and then painting it all in golden colors and calling
il "the good old days."
D<> to an unfortunate failing of mine. 1 have
been able to pass enough courses and garner enough
units so that graduation from this sunny clime can
no longer be postponed. Self-respect (and my bank
roll) demand that I get out and earn a living from
now on.
