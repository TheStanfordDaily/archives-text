# Tuesday Series Speaker Asks Imaginative Planning
## 
### 
Stressing the need for imagina
tive, far-sightetl city planning. Mil
lard Sheets, painter and member of
♦he faculty at Scripps College,
opened the spring quarter Tuesday
Evening Series last night with his
lecture on "The Importance of Imag
ination.'"
Mr. Sheets maintained that we
have let our cities grow—Topsy-like
—in a gridiron pattern of blocks.
The houses have been built with no
regard for use of land, leaving space
for rubbish but no space for parks
and playgrounds.
In commercial areas the buildings
and streets were set up without
planning for parking. Now shoppers
can't park in town, so they don't
shop in town. "In downtown Los
Angeles," Mr. Sheets said, "the
property value has dropped 50 per
cent."
Mr. Sheets argued that wc now
need imagination to plan our cities
so they will be really adequate for
our needs and safety. Underpasses
at intersections, parking meters, end
slum clearance are merely "pills
after the patient is sick."
We need long-range planning for
the future, but first we must over
come the lethargic sentimentalism of
the people. The citizens, Mr. Sheets
said, are too often not willing to
take the trouble to plan, to use
their imagination, and to change
from their set ways.
Mr. Sheets is an outstanding wa
tcrcolorist who has served as an
artist-correspondent for Life maga
zine in the India-Burma theater
during the war. lie was introduced
by John W. Dodds, dean of the
School of Humanities.
