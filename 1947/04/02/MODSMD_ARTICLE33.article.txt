# Farm NSO Presents Plans For Local, National Action
## 
### 
Delegates from 303 colleges and universities throughout the
United States met at Chicago last December 28 to 30 in the initial
?;tep towards the formation of a National Student Organization
(N. 5.0.).
This student organization was conceived by students, prin
cipally in the east, who believed that student action on student
problems could be effective only if it were unified.

I,AVS GROUNDWORK
Stanford sent three delegates and
one observer to this convention.
Since N.S.O.'s approval locally by
Kxcom, the embryo organization
under the Excom - appointed head,
Marilyn Sidwell. has tried to lay the
groundwork locally and regionally
for effective action on the Pacific
(Oast.
With the present confusion of in
itials on the Stanford campus.
N S.O. would like to present what
il believes can be effected nation
ally and locally through student
support of the N.S.O. in a series of
articles in the Daily.
First, national organization:
N.S.O. will become a reality next
ummer when the work of the Na
tional Continuations Council (ap
pointed at the last conference) will
be presented t(i the Congress at Chi
cago. This Continuations Council,
consisting of regional chairmen from
i ach of the 30 regions in the United
States, three students representing
organizations, executive officers, and
a staff committee (which is writing
the constitution), is attempting to
compile attitudes and solutions to
the problems which face present
day students.
STUDENT AID
National aims are: (1) to promote
student friendship on the national
and international scale; (2) to se
cure for all people equal rights and
possibilities for primary, secondary,
and higher education regardless of
six, race, or religion; (3) to secure
for all students an extensive sys
tem of governmental and private
aid in obtaining scholarships, fam
ily allowances, the provision of text
books and supplies, and all other
means to assure their independence.
(4) To encourage student-faculty
co-operation on student problems
and the extension of democratic
student-controlled governments and
establish the independence and
freedom from censorship of student
organizations and publications; (5)
to assure that all activity funds are
controlled by the students them
selves.
((i) To foster student cultural ac
tivities; to secure the widest pos
sible publication of advances of
knowledge in the pure, natural, in
dustrial, and social sciences and the
fine arts, and methods of circula
tion of these publications which
would make available to all stu
dents the fullest information re
garding such new developments.
(7) To eliminate the commerciali
zation of intercollegiate sports and
to advocate the establishment of ad
equate courses of physical education
throughout the nation; to sponsor
interracial, interfaith, and intercol
legiate sports on an amateur basis;
to establish adequate medical facil
ities for athletes; to eliminate the
obligation of athletes to sign injury
waivers; to promote adequate recre
ational facilities.

Employment bureaus, nationally

wishes to act as a clearing-house,
catalog, and republication center for
local and regional student publica
tions and for material pertinent to
student problems and issues.
According to the preamble of the
National Continuations Council:
"Since this organization cannot
achieve its objectives or maintain
the active support of all college and
university students if its influence
should be diverted into partisan,
sectarian, or other narrow chan
nels. be it resolved that the N.S.O.
shall have as its objectives only
those which contribute to the en
hancement of the welfare of stu
dents and facilitate student contri
butions to international under
standing and good will and shall
specifically refrain from becoming
involved in partisan political affairs,
sectarian religious considerations, or
similar matters which do not di
rectly affect students in functions
and activities as students, with the
single exception that the N.S.O.
shall stand unalterably opposed to
any political doctrine which would
stifle free and democratic education
in the United States."
The above aims and plans are. of
course, tentative and depend upon

ideas brought by local N.S.O.'s to
the conference this summer. It is
their responsibility to recommend
the necessary changes and see that
the changes are carried through.

wishes to act as a clearing-house,
catalog, and republication center for
local and regional student publica

According to the preamble of the
National Continuations Council:
"Since this organization cannot
achieve its objectives or maintain
the active support of all college and
university students if its influence
should be diverted into partisan,
sectarian, or other narrow chan
nels. be it resolved that the N.S.O.
shall have as its objectives only
those which contribute to the en

butions to international under
standing and good will and shall
specifically refrain from becoming
involved in partisan political affairs,
sectarian religious considerations, or
similar matters which do not di
rectly affect students in functions
and activities as students, with the
single exception that the N.S.O.
shall stand unalterably opposed to
any political doctrine which would
stifle free and democratic education
in the United States."
The above aims and plans are. of
course, tentative and depend upon

ideas brought by local N.S.O.'s to
the conference this summer. It is
their responsibility to recommend
the necessary changes and see that
the changes are carried through.

Delegates from 303 colleges and universities throughout the
United States met at Chicago last December 28 to 30 in the initial
?;tep towards the formation of a National Student Organization
(N. 5.0.).
This student organization was conceived by students, prin
cipally in the east, who believed that student action on student
problems could be effective only if it were unified.

I,AVS GROUNDWORK
Stanford sent three delegates and
one observer to this convention.
Since N.S.O.'s approval locally by
Kxcom, the embryo organization
under the Excom - appointed head,
Marilyn Sidwell. has tried to lay the
groundwork locally and regionally
for effective action on the Pacific
(Oast.
With the present confusion of in
itials on the Stanford campus.
N S.O. would like to present what
il believes can be effected nation
ally and locally through student
support of the N.S.O. in a series of
articles in the Daily.
First, national organization:
N.S.O. will become a reality next
ummer when the work of the Na
tional Continuations Council (ap
pointed at the last conference) will
be presented t(i the Congress at Chi
cago. This Continuations Council,
consisting of regional chairmen from
i ach of the 30 regions in the United
States, three students representing
organizations, executive officers, and
a staff committee (which is writing
the constitution), is attempting to
compile attitudes and solutions to
the problems which face present
day students.
STUDENT AID
National aims are: (1) to promote
student friendship on the national
and international scale; (2) to se
cure for all people equal rights and
possibilities for primary, secondary,
and higher education regardless of
six, race, or religion; (3) to secure
for all students an extensive sys
tem of governmental and private
aid in obtaining scholarships, fam
ily allowances, the provision of text
books and supplies, and all other
means to assure their independence.
(4) To encourage student-faculty
co-operation on student problems
and the extension of democratic
student-controlled governments and
establish the independence and
freedom from censorship of student
organizations and publications; (5)
to assure that all activity funds are
controlled by the students them
selves.
((i) To foster student cultural ac
tivities; to secure the widest pos
sible publication of advances of
knowledge in the pure, natural, in
dustrial, and social sciences and the
fine arts, and methods of circula
tion of these publications which
would make available to all stu
dents the fullest information re
garding such new developments.
(7) To eliminate the commerciali
zation of intercollegiate sports and
to advocate the establishment of ad
equate courses of physical education
throughout the nation; to sponsor
interracial, interfaith, and intercol
legiate sports on an amateur basis;
to establish adequate medical facil

obligation of athletes to sign injury
waivers; to promote adequate recre
ational facilities.

According to the preamble of the
National Continuations Council:
"Since this organization cannot
achieve its objectives or maintain
the active support of all college and
university students if its influence
should be diverted into partisan,
sectarian, or other narrow chan
nels. be it resolved that the N.S.O.
shall have as its objectives only
those which contribute to the en

dents and facilitate student contri
butions to international under
standing and good will and shall
specifically refrain from becoming
involved in partisan political affairs,
sectarian religious considerations, or
similar matters which do not di
rectly affect students in functions
and activities as students, with the
single exception that the N.S.O.
shall stand unalterably opposed to
any political doctrine which would
stifle free and democratic education
in the United States."
The above aims and plans are. of
course, tentative and depend upon

ideas brought by local N.S.O.'s to
the conference this summer. It is
their responsibility to recommend
the necessary changes and see that
the changes are carried through.

Delegates from 303 colleges and universities throughout the
United States met at Chicago last December 28 to 30 in the initial
?;tep towards the formation of a National Student Organization
(N. 5.0.).
This student organization was conceived by students, prin
cipally in the east, who believed that student action on student
problems could be effective only if it were unified.

I,AVS GROUNDWORK
Stanford sent three delegates and
one observer to this convention.
Since N.S.O.'s approval locally by
Kxcom, the embryo organization
under the Excom - appointed head,
Marilyn Sidwell. has tried to lay the
groundwork locally and regionally
for effective action on the Pacific
(Oast.
With the present confusion of in
itials on the Stanford campus.
N S.O. would like to present what
il believes can be effected nation
ally and locally through student
support of the N.S.O. in a series of
articles in the Daily.
First, national organization:
N.S.O. will become a reality next
ummer when the work of the Na
tional Continuations Council (ap
pointed at the last conference) will
be presented t(i the Congress at Chi
cago. This Continuations Council,
consisting of regional chairmen from
i ach of the 30 regions in the United
States, three students representing
organizations, executive officers, and
a staff committee (which is writing
the constitution), is attempting to
compile attitudes and solutions to
the problems which face present
day students.
STUDENT AID
National aims are: (1) to promote
student friendship on the national
and international scale; (2) to se
cure for all people equal rights and
possibilities for primary, secondary,
and higher education regardless of
six, race, or religion; (3) to secure
for all students an extensive sys
tem of governmental and private
aid in obtaining scholarships, fam
ily allowances, the provision of text
books and supplies, and all other
means to assure their independence.
(4) To encourage student-faculty
co-operation on student problems
and the extension of democratic
student-controlled governments and
establish the independence and
freedom from censorship of student
organizations and publications; (5)
to assure that all activity funds are
controlled by the students them
selves.
