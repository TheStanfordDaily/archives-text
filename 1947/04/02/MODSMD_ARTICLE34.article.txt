lons of water in it up to last Mon
day. March 31. According to enqi
neer Carl Maier, th" creek is run
ning very slowly and won't hold up
very long without another rain.
It would take quite a bit more
rainfall to fill the lake to its 120-
ni ill ion - gallon capacity, and unless
there is at least one or two more
rains Stanford students will not be
able to launch canoes, although they
