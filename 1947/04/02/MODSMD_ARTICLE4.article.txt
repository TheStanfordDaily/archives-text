An informal meeting of the Stan
ford Flying Club was held yester
day in the Nitery to discuss reacti
vation of the club as a social or
ganization for Stanford flyers. The
meeting was led by Cutler Web
ster.
Minor changes in the constitution
and plans for a group flying trip
on Saturday, April 12, were consid
ered.
A formal meeting for the election
of officers and discussion of club
plans will be held on Thursday at
7:30 p.m. in the lower lounge of the
Women's Clubhouse. All Stanford
flyers are invited, according to
Webster.
Webster stressed the fact that the
purpose of the club is not to make
flying cheaper for members but
merely to provide a naturally con
genial social organization for flyers.
Members will make their own ar
rangements for planes.
The trip on April 12 will be simi
lar to the trip made last quarter by
a group of eight planes from Stan
lord to Hollister, Calif.
