## 
### 
Winter season minor sports at
Stanford made their last appear
ances of the year here the weekend
of March 7-8. Of the total of four
different sports which went to the
firing line against Cal —wrestling
boxing, gymnastics, and rugby—
only the boxers were able to make
their last outing a successful ven
ture.
The ringmen wound up their cam
paign March 7 by punching out a
7 -4' revenge victory over Cali
fornia in the Pavilion. The win gave
Stanford an even break in the home
and-home duo of matches with the
Bears and boosted the Indians' over
all percentage to .600.
Other Stanford athletic squads
were not so fortunate.
Student coach Vern Jones' wrest
lers, on the same night, were snowed
under by the Bear mat men. 21-11.
Tlie defeat was the second of the
season for Jones' proteges at the
hands of California.
An additional repeat trouncing
was scored by the Bears March 8
over the Indian rugby team, 8-0,
and California made its minor sport
weekend even more successful that
night by turning back a stubborn
Stanford gymnast outfit, 47-43, in a
hotly contested meet.
