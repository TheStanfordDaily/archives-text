# 148 Hopefuls Turn Out For Spring Grid Grind
## 
### BOB BULLOCK 
Optimism for Stanford's 1047 foot
ball campaign was the keynote of
Yesterday's Spring practice l egist ra
tion as Coach Marchie Schwartz wel
comed 148 men into the fold. The
encouraging turn-out surprised the
Cardinal coaching stafl which had
expected only 100 applicants for
varsity posts.
Immediately, Schwartz scheduled
the Hist squad meeting—an indoor
affair —lor this afternoon in the
S.A.C. The large grid class will
receive equipment on Friday, with
the first of .'JO outdoor sessfons slated
for Monday afternoon.
20 LETTEKMEN BACK
Nucleus for the 1047 Red Machine
is expected to be 20 lettermen, hold
overs from last year's successful
season. Unfortunately, experience
on the new Indian squad is strongly
concentrated in the backlield, while
the line has been weakened by the
i loss of 10 stalwarts.
BACKFIELD LOADED
In the power-laden backfield,
Ray Hammett of the coaching staff
will have a wealth of material with
which to mold a high-scoring ma
chine. Ainslie Bell, who quarter
backed the Indians to their impress

ive Big Game victory last year, will
be back after a quarter's absence for
a knee operation. Other backs of
proven ability who will cavort in
Spring training are Mickey Titus,
George Quist, and Gene Martin.
Conspicuous by its absence from
the Spring sign-up list is the daz
zling 1-2 punch duo of last year's
team, Lloyd Merriman and Bob An
derson. Mr. Football Merriman will
spend the quarter playing an equal
ly brilliant game of baseball as the
king-pin of the Stanford nine. Mean
while the Farm swimming team has
first call on Rapid Robert who leads
the local paddlers in their quest for
national recognition. But, both Bob
and Lloyd join the football squad
immediately after the baseball and
swimming seasons close.
DAKK HORSE FROM SANTA ANA
Dark-horse candidate for a start
ing backfield position is Jim Naf
ziger from Santa Ana Junior College
who rambled to All-J.C. team recog
nition last year. But he will be fac
ing tremendous competition in at
tempting to crash the Cardinal var
sity.
Line Coach Phil Bengston has his
work cut out for him in salvaging
the graduation-riddled forward wall

of the Red Machine. The 10 line- 1
inen lost from the powerful 104(>
line, which was the key to a num- i
ber of last year's victories, will not 1
be easily replaced.
Prominent among the returning
line veterans are Bill Hachten,
Pinky Phleger, and Marty Feldman.
Again, baseball detains a few of the
regular varsity from Spring prac
tice, as in the cases of Charlie Wake-
I field and Dick Flatland.
Still the forward wall prospectus
remains a problem for Coach
I Marchie and his staff.

be back after a quarter's absence for
a knee operation. Other backs of
proven ability who will cavort in
Spring training are Mickey Titus,
George Quist, and Gene Martin.
Conspicuous by its absence from
the Spring sign-up list is the daz
zling 1-2 punch duo of last year's
team, Lloyd Merriman and Bob An
derson. Mr. Football Merriman will
spend the quarter playing an equal
ly brilliant game of baseball as the
king-pin of the Stanford nine. Mean
while the Farm swimming team has
first call on Rapid Robert who leads
the local paddlers in their quest for
national recognition. But, both Bob
and Lloyd join the football squad
immediately after the baseball and
swimming seasons close.
DAKK HORSE FROM SANTA ANA
Dark-horse candidate for a start
ing backfield position is Jim Naf
ziger from Santa Ana Junior College
who rambled to All-J.C. team recog
nition last year. But he will be fac
ing tremendous competition in at
tempting to crash the Cardinal var
sity.
Line Coach Phil Bengston has his
work cut out for him in salvaging
the graduation-riddled forward wall

of the Red Machine. The 10 line- 1
inen lost from the powerful 104(>
line, which was the key to a num- i
ber of last year's victories, will not 1
be easily replaced.
Prominent among the returning
line veterans are Bill Hachten,
Pinky Phleger, and Marty Feldman.
Again, baseball detains a few of the
regular varsity from Spring prac
tice, as in the cases of Charlie Wake-
I field and Dick Flatland.
Still the forward wall prospectus
remains a problem for Coach
I Marchie and his staff.

Optimism for Stanford's 1047 foot
ball campaign was the keynote of
Yesterday's Spring practice l egist ra
tion as Coach Marchie Schwartz wel
comed 148 men into the fold. The
encouraging turn-out surprised the
Cardinal coaching stafl which had
expected only 100 applicants for
varsity posts.
Immediately, Schwartz scheduled
the Hist squad meeting—an indoor
affair —lor this afternoon in the
S.A.C. The large grid class will
receive equipment on Friday, with
the first of .'JO outdoor sessfons slated
for Monday afternoon.
20 LETTEKMEN BACK
Nucleus for the 1047 Red Machine
is expected to be 20 lettermen, hold
overs from last year's successful
season. Unfortunately, experience
on the new Indian squad is strongly
concentrated in the backlield, while
the line has been weakened by the
i loss of 10 stalwarts.
BACKFIELD LOADED
In the power-laden backfield,
Ray Hammett of the coaching staff
will have a wealth of material with
which to mold a high-scoring ma
chine. Ainslie Bell, who quarter
backed the Indians to their impress

ive Big Game victory last year, will
be back after a quarter's absence for
a knee operation. Other backs of
proven ability who will cavort in
Spring training are Mickey Titus,
George Quist, and Gene Martin.
