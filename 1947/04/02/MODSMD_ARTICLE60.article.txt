## Remember Your Cellar Check 
### 
The problem of Cellar walkouts pops up
each quarter to plague those in charge of the
Cellar and the student manager. Last quar
ter's loss from failure to pay checks, according
to Student Manager Gene Mitgard, totaled
over 5125.
A partial report of weekly losses shows:
Jan. 20-25. $21.31; Jan. 27-Feb. 1, $13.91;
Feb. 3 8, $14.88; Feb. 10 -15, $17.46; Feb. 17-
22, $17.57; Feb. 24-Mar. 1, $12.80; Mar. 3 8,
$15.07; and Mar. 10 15, $5.99.
Most of these walkouts, we think, result
from students who forget to pay rather than
from those who are intent on not paying. It

is simply a case of carelessness for which the
rest of the students are paying through in
creased operating costs.
The Cellar is run on a basis which leaves
the responsibility for paying entirely to the
student. It is a system which can work only
when each person accepts this very minor
responsibility, and takes a little pride in the
realization that it is a business system de
signed for honest, mature adults.
It is a simple problem to correct if everyone
will just make an effort to remember that the
Cellar can t continue to run if such losses
continue or increase.
