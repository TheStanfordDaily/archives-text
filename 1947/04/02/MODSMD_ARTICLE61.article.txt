# BULL SESSION

### DAN ENDSLEY 
Our Stanford girls really get around. The other
night 1 visited my brother; his wife tuned in on
"Noah Webster Says." which is one of the hundreds
of quiz shows on the air. Who should turn up as one
of the quizzees but Sharon Douglas, a Stanford girl.
I knew right away she was the Sharon Douglas who
goes to Stanford l>ecause she said so.
Naturally I rooted for her, just like I root for
Lloyd Merriman when he comes to bat with the bases
loaded. After all, Stanford women may not be
much, but they're our very own. The way I look at
it. nobody has a right to insult Stanford women—
except Stanford men.
But to get back to Miss Douglas. I was pulling for
her to answer all the questions right, just like she
was my little sister or something. I was especially
anxious for her to make a good showing because a
lady B.'! years old had just walked off with $50 because
she knew the difference between a stalactite and a
stalagmite. It seems a stalagmite is just a stalactite
with an inverted personality.
Well, our Miss Douglas got past the preliminary
questions all right—but as a topper Haven Mac-
Quarrie (the M.C.) asked her to define a didelphian
animal.
All was quiet; you could have heard an infinitive
split. Then, "Hmmm," she hmmmed, "That's a good
one." There was another pause while I mentally
agreed with her. I also mentally kissed her 50 bucks
goodbye. Then she said, "Could that be an animal
that lives in the daytime?"

Right away I felt better, because she had narrowed
Ihe field. She no longer had to consider the animals
that are dead at night. But she made no further
progress. Finally MacQuarrie gave her a hint.
"What's a marsupial?" he said.

Of course Miss Douglas had no
further trouble. She had been a
good girl and studied her biology
hard, so she was able to tell the
nice man that a marsupial is an
animal that carries its young in
a pouch, like pipe tobacco. She
collected her $50 and a bucket
of Snowdrift and left while I
heaved a sigh of relief.
Afterwards I tried to analyze
my feelings. I am certainly no
booster for Stanford women but,

had she failed, 1 would have felt a keen personal
disappointment. Then I remembered the old saying,
"In the spring a young man's fancy turns."
I'm not the only one who feels more mellow
about t Ho Stanford femininity. Not long ago I was
sitting on the library steps with a prominent rough.
He didn't say a word for 15 minutes, and I was sure
he was cogitating on nothing less weighty than the
Theory of Relativity.
Finally he turned to me, and I waited breathlessly
for some pearls of wisdom.
"You know," he said, "the beasts don't look so bad
this time of year."
