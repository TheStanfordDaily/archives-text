It is curious that the sessions of a freely-elected
representative legislative body debating proposed
legislation freely and in public and making their
decisions by a majority vote —should present what is,
at first glance, a strong argument against the whole
democratic mechanism. The antics of these bodies
or of their more vocal members and committees as
reflected in newspaper "banners" is a pretty poor
recommendation of our system—at first glance.
I am honestly of the opinion that this picture is
only impressionistic, to say the least. Newspaper
headlines are neither objective nor do they put the
scattered incidents they herald in any sort of perr
speetive. (This was one of the few conclusions
reached in the recent report of the Committee on the
Freedom of the Press.) And both the day-to-day
stories in the papers and the headlines over them
are, thank Heaven, As perishable as the paper on
which they were written.
But, misrepresentation or not, we can learn a
working philosophy of democracy from these reported
antics and goings-on. We can learn that—curious
or even wicked as some people—including Stanford
people—seem to think it—other people can honestly
hold opinions flatly contrary to our own. And the
conscript fathers of our legislatures are likely to give
all these opinions about the same consideration. We
can learn that there are other interests to be consid
ered besides our own or those that appear most
immediately to us. And it is born in upon us, too,
that people in high and low places both may be
neither over-honest nor over-intelligent.
From all this clash of issues and opinions, actual

conclusions emerge, and these conclusions are en- j
acted into law. Because they are law, to be enforced
wilh the full authority of the community, they must ;
please more than some minority group, and here we j
can learn the prime lesson of practical democracy,
the necessity of compromise. The zealous partisan
denounces compromise, and indeed many statutes on j
the book fly right in the face of the principles that
inspired them. But compromise is an answer both
simple and satisfactory, while it is not simple and j
usually not satisfactory to apply one's theories and J
principles to any concrete situation. All right, so it's
pragmatic, naturalistic, and so on. It's betteV than [
guillotines, concentration camps, racks and stakes ;
and faggots. That's where uncompromising principle
can lead,

I have been asked, by not less than two different
people, mind you, what is the inside story on the new j
King of the Hellenes, Paul the First (and, to make an
obvious remark, probably the Last). Well, I do ;
remember a big spread in LIFE some years back
when he was married. Seriously, I don't know any- i
thing about him. But. to give a curbstone opinion, !
the change will probably strengthen the Greek
monarchy, in the short run anyway. George II was
not a flaming success as a monarch; Paul may be an
improvement. Paul may be able to add a dash of
leadership, of glamor, a fresh supply of "the divinity !
that doth hedge a king." He may even bounce a few
prominent Greek politicians, which, from what Ii
read, could hardly lose him any support. In short,
he can give Greece some measure of national unity.
If he does, he deserves our support.

monarchy, in the short run anyway. George II was
not a flaming success as a monarch; Paul may be an
improvement. Paul may be able to add a dash of
leadership, of glamor, a fresh supply of "the divinity !
that doth hedge a king." He may even bounce a few
prominent Greek politicians, which, from what Ii
read, could hardly lose him any support. In short,
he can give Greece some measure of national unity.
If he does, he deserves our support.
It is curious that the sessions of a freely-elected
representative legislative body debating proposed
legislation freely and in public and making their
decisions by a majority vote —should present what is,
at first glance, a strong argument against the whole
democratic mechanism. The antics of these bodies
or of their more vocal members and committees as
reflected in newspaper "banners" is a pretty poor
recommendation of our system—at first glance.
I am honestly of the opinion that this picture is
only impressionistic, to say the least. Newspaper
headlines are neither objective nor do they put the
scattered incidents they herald in any sort of perr
speetive. (This was one of the few conclusions
reached in the recent report of the Committee on the
Freedom of the Press.) And both the day-to-day
stories in the papers and the headlines over them
are, thank Heaven, As perishable as the paper on
which they were written.
But, misrepresentation or not, we can learn a
working philosophy of democracy from these reported
antics and goings-on. We can learn that—curious
or even wicked as some people—including Stanford
people—seem to think it—other people can honestly
hold opinions flatly contrary to our own. And the
conscript fathers of our legislatures are likely to give
all these opinions about the same consideration. We
can learn that there are other interests to be consid
ered besides our own or those that appear most
immediately to us. And it is born in upon us, too,
that people in high and low places both may be
neither over-honest nor over-intelligent.
From all this clash of issues and opinions, actual

conclusions emerge, and these conclusions are en- j
acted into law. Because they are law, to be enforced
wilh the full authority of the community, they must ;
please more than some minority group, and here we j
can learn the prime lesson of practical democracy,
the necessity of compromise. The zealous partisan
denounces compromise, and indeed many statutes on j
the book fly right in the face of the principles that
inspired them. But compromise is an answer both
simple and satisfactory, while it is not simple and j
usually not satisfactory to apply one's theories and J
principles to any concrete situation. All right, so it's
pragmatic, naturalistic, and so on. It's betteV than [
guillotines, concentration camps, racks and stakes ;
and faggots. That's where uncompromising principle
can lead,

I have been asked, by not less than two different
people, mind you, what is the inside story on the new j
King of the Hellenes, Paul the First (and, to make an
obvious remark, probably the Last). Well, I do ;
remember a big spread in LIFE some years back
when he was married. Seriously, I don't know any- i
thing about him. But. to give a curbstone opinion, !
the change will probably strengthen the Greek
monarchy, in the short run anyway. George II was
