To the Editor:
In Village Counselor Wundei'lich's "Hi Neighbor"
letter of last month, he declared, "Board and room
cost will be maintained at the same level for the spring
quarter." It i.s true that the total cost remains the
same, but since the autumn quarter contained 12
weeks, the winter quarter 11 weeks, and the new
quarter has 10' j weeks, it is evident that villagers
will pay more per week in this quarter than they
paid in either of the two preceding quarters. There
fore. the cost has not remained upon the same level.
It has been increased steadily, and I might add, rather
deceptively.

veteran taken from one publication of a leading uni

atomized academic community. In the college, par
particularly, there i.s an unhealthy emphasis on grades, |
on making paper records in order to quality for the
Law or Business or Medical or other graduate schools

which all veterans are aware. There is an attitude
of excessive professionalism which is especially dis
turbing in the light of the recent emphasis on the
college as a place for general education." (Harvard
University Alumni Bulletin, March, 1947.)
This view of a competent educator should not
pass unnoticed. Now that our colleges have incum
bent upon them so much responsibility for the qual
ity of future citizens of the United States and of the
world, would it not be a proper time immediately to
look into that highest level of education which pro
duces the unhealthy competitive spirit, the determin
ation to make one's own path regardless of the next
man? Surely, most of us in whom such an unhealthy
desire to be "on the make" is fostered are not that
way by inclination. If we are using a system of
higher education which does foster such an attitude. |
we may well ask ourselves what kind of Americans
and world citizens we will be when our education is
completed.

It has been increased steadily, and I might add, rather
deceptively.

. . . . There are undoubtedly serious tensions

not much leisurely talk of fellowship or group spirit, i
Men go their individual ways living in a highly

particularly, there i.s an unhealthy emphasis on grades, |
on making paper records in order to quality for the
Law or Business or Medical or other graduate schools
in the highly-competitive system of admission of j
which all veterans are aware. There is an attitude
of excessive professionalism which is especially dis
turbing in the light of the recent emphasis on the
college as a place for general education." (Harvard
University Alumni Bulletin, March, 1947.)
This view of a competent educator should not
pass unnoticed. Now that our colleges have incum
bent upon them so much responsibility for the qual
ity of future citizens of the United States and of the
world, would it not be a proper time immediately to
look into that highest level of education which pro
duces the unhealthy competitive spirit, the determin
ation to make one's own path regardless of the next
man? Surely, most of us in whom such an unhealthy
desire to be "on the make" is fostered are not that
way by inclination. If we are using a system of
higher education which does foster such an attitude. |
we may well ask ourselves what kind of Americans
and world citizens we will be when our education is
completed.

To the Editor:
In Village Counselor Wundei'lich's "Hi Neighbor"
letter of last month, he declared, "Board and room
cost will be maintained at the same level for the spring
quarter." It i.s true that the total cost remains the
same, but since the autumn quarter contained 12
weeks, the winter quarter 11 weeks, and the new
quarter has 10' j weeks, it is evident that villagers
will pay more per week in this quarter than they
paid in either of the two preceding quarters. There
fore. the cost has not remained upon the same level.
It has been increased steadily, and I might add, rather
