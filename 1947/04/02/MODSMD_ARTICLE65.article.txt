# Farm Climbers Top Lofty Peak
## 
### 
Tackling California's third loftiest peak, three Farm ski-mountaineers,
Ulf Ramm-Erickson, Franz Gehrels, and Bill Kershaw, topped 14,254-foot
North Palisade Mountain spring vacation.
The hazardous winter ascent, difficult in the summer with ropes, has
been accomplished only once before, in 1941 after two previous unsuccess-

ful attempts. Fritz Lippman, a
member of the Stanford Alpine
Club, was present on the first climb
to the top.
Dressed in ski parkas and pants
and ski boots with tricouni nails,
rubber cleated soles, and climbing
spikes, the three Stanford men car
ried a two-man nylon army moun
tain tent, army mountain troop
double arctic sleeping bags, and a
small Coleman gasoline stove.
The trio left Glacier Lodge, which
is 10 miles from Big Pine on the
east side of the Sierras, altitude
7,800, Saturday noon with 50-pound
packs, traveling about six miles
hiking and skiing. The first night
out was spent at a mountain lake
where it snowed six inches. The
altitude was 10,000 there.
Sunday the Alpine Club members
passed the. timberline to Palisade
Glacier, the largest in the Sierras,
and camped that night 13,500 feet
above sea level.
Monday morning dawned calm
and clear, ideal climbing weather, |
and the adventurers skied about j
three-quarters of a mile up the gla- [
cier to the foot of a steep snow
gully at the base of the mountain. I
Using ice axes to chop steps and
jam into the snow for safety, the j
group labored farther up the icy
gully by foot. Roped together, the
men reached the gully top and j
looked eastward at the whole snow- j
capped Sierra range below.
An 80 - degree rock chimney,
blown clear of snow by fierce winds,
faced the mountaineers. Roped for j
safety, the trio reached the top in j
an hour and then began a fast tra- j
verse along a half-mile knife-edge |
ridge to the summit.
From the peak the group was j
high above everything but Mount ;
Whitney, 20 miles to the south. Ulf

Ramm-Erickson led the entire as
cent, which took seven hours from
the glacier camp.
Returning, the climbers rappeled
j down to the gully, using a con
| trolled fall to slow the progress of
! each member of the party as he
j slid down the ice and snow. When
j the men reached their skis the des
j cent to the camp on the glacier
i was a quick one.
Following the return to Glacier
Lodge on Tuesday, the tired trio
! spent a day recuperating in the
warm swimming pools at Death
Valley, 100 miles away.

east side of the Sierras, altitude
7,800, Saturday noon with 50-pound
packs, traveling about six miles
hiking and skiing. The first night
out was spent at a mountain lake
where it snowed six inches. The
altitude was 10,000 there.
Sunday the Alpine Club members
passed the. timberline to Palisade
Glacier, the largest in the Sierras,
and camped that night 13,500 feet
above sea level.
Monday morning dawned calm
and clear, ideal climbing weather, |
and the adventurers skied about j
three-quarters of a mile up the gla- [
cier to the foot of a steep snow
gully at the base of the mountain. I
Using ice axes to chop steps and
jam into the snow for safety, the j
group labored farther up the icy
gully by foot. Roped together, the
men reached the gully top and j
looked eastward at the whole snow- j
capped Sierra range below.
An 80 - degree rock chimney,
blown clear of snow by fierce winds,
faced the mountaineers. Roped for j
safety, the trio reached the top in j
an hour and then began a fast tra- j
verse along a half-mile knife-edge |
ridge to the summit.
From the peak the group was j
high above everything but Mount ;
Whitney, 20 miles to the south. Ulf

Ramm-Erickson led the entire as
cent, which took seven hours from
the glacier camp.
Returning, the climbers rappeled
j down to the gully, using a con
| trolled fall to slow the progress of
! each member of the party as he
j slid down the ice and snow. When
j the men reached their skis the des
j cent to the camp on the glacier
i was a quick one.
Following the return to Glacier
Lodge on Tuesday, the tired trio
! spent a day recuperating in the
warm swimming pools at Death
Valley, 100 miles away.
Tackling California's third loftiest peak, three Farm ski-mountaineers,
Ulf Ramm-Erickson, Franz Gehrels, and Bill Kershaw, topped 14,254-foot
North Palisade Mountain spring vacation.
The hazardous winter ascent, difficult in the summer with ropes, has
been accomplished only once before, in 1941 after two previous unsuccess-

ful attempts. Fritz Lippman, a
member of the Stanford Alpine
Club, was present on the first climb
to the top.
Dressed in ski parkas and pants
and ski boots with tricouni nails,
rubber cleated soles, and climbing
spikes, the three Stanford men car
ried a two-man nylon army moun
tain tent, army mountain troop
double arctic sleeping bags, and a
small Coleman gasoline stove.
The trio left Glacier Lodge, which
is 10 miles from Big Pine on the
