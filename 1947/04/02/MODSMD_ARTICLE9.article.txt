proportions tonight over Republican
Russell W. Root.

ceed Edward J. Kelly, mayor for 14
years, grabbed an early lead and re

Root, a percentage of approximately
59 and 41.
• Root acknowledged defeat less
than two and one-half hours after
the polls closed at 5 p.m. when un
official returns showed the Demo
cratic reform candidate winning
even in areas which last November
returned GOP majorities.
