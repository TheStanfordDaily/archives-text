establish a men's«nominating com-i
mitl.ee to function as does a women's j
comtniltee which recommends nom

ENCINA SPONSORS
A plan providing free room for
Encitia sponsors proposed by Chief
Counselor for Men Shelton L. Beatty
and A.S.S.U. President Martin An
derson was referred to Creede to in
vestigate previous methods of selec
tion. According to Anderson two
conflicts may arise: the question of
fraternities and eating clubs having
equal ratio in order not to overly in- \
lluence freshmen toward either, and i
the administration having the filial j
word in the selection.
The plan, a guide for chosing next j
fall's sponsors, would permit Excom i
to present the University a list of I
approved persons, with specific j
recommendations for the first six. j
Twelve sponsors and four other of
ficers would be selected from the list J
by tlw> Administration. The officers !
would be a flail president ;%d Busi

Encitia sponsors proposed by Chief

fraternities and eating clubs having
equal ratio in order not to overly in- \
lluence freshmen toward either, and i
the administration having the filial j
word in the selection.

fall's sponsors, would permit Excom i
to present the University a list of I
approved persons, with specific j
recommendations for the first six. j
