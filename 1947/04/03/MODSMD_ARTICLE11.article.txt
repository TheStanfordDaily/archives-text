# Activity Cards Poll Student Interests
## 
### 
Plans for Stanford's Activities
Agency, inaugurated last quarter to
increase participation in extra-cur
ricular activities, took definite form
this week as students checked their
interest on cards placed in the Ad
ministration Building during regis
tration.
A.S.S.U. activities cards will be
available in the Administration
Building throughout the week and
will then be distributed in living
groups, Agency co-chairmen Gordon
Johnson and Jean Strong said. John
son stressed the importance of filling
out the cards.
The Agency will begin functioning
as soon as the student cards are
tabulated and all organizations have
returned information sheets sent out
last quarter, Johnson said.
Organizations will be provided
with lists of students and any stu
dent wishing information on activi
ties may clear through the ccntral
office, he added.
All organization presidents who
have not received information sheets
are asked to contact Helch Dictz.
