### SHIRLEY ROGERS 
Stanford University engineers have announced a long range
plan for the future cultural and architectural development of thin
university into a concentrated system that will eliminate th«*
danger of haphazard and unimaginative building.
New housing for men and graduate students, new law school,
a publications center, a science guadrangle, modernization of
the old guad, and a new road system have all been proposed by
the University planners.
Still in a flexible and embryonic stage in offices of the university
planner, Eldridge T. Spence/, the plan will provide a tangible and well
ordered basics for the future building of the University.
The plan has been molded and remolded, and though it is still in a
putty-like condition it reveals how the Stanford of 50 or even 100 years
hcnce may look.
Representative symbol of this plan is a large aerial photograph of
the campus which covers nearly half the wall in the planning office (note
above cut). Roads are still white pieces of paper, and buildings not yet
actually conceited, are paper-pasted models.
From this office has come the basic outline of the Stanfnrd-of-tomor
row, the materialization of which depends upon the varied problems of
financing faced by the University. Dr. Tresidder said, "The planning i .
designed to chart a logical course for growth. The University has financial
problems which must be met before any large scale construction can be
undertaken unless specific items in the program are provided for by gifts "
Combining the compactness and unification of the planners' work, the
map offers a key t.o the highlights of the projected planning that has been
in progress for the past two years by Spencer and Lewis Mumford,
internationally known planning expert and former Stanford professor of
Humanities.
TWO NEW QUADRANGLES PLANNED FOR FARM
Two new "Quadrangles" will grow to the east arid west of the original
Quad, which is to be completely remodeled and modernized. These "Quad
rangles" would be especially adapted to growth and arranged on quad
rangular sections of land rather than the square courts of the original
quad.
Unification of men's halls will follow in the Toyon-Branner-Encina
Area (Note: 1, 2, 5, 6), with special provision for new lower division
housing (5) in the area below Toyon. These units will tie in a general
men's residential area.
Already two of these men's residences have been completed on paper:
Crothers' Hall, residence for Law Students, a gilt by Judge George Crother .
of San Francisco; and the Lucie R. Stern Residence Hall for men. Thi
hall, a gift from the estate of the late Palo Alto philanthropist, will prob
ably be located across Excondido Road from Crothers Hall.
Eventually the residential needs of graduate students and married
research workers and young faculty members, who have been forced to
live off-campus, will be met in the proposed plan. Areas for such mul
tiple dwelling units have been provisionally located near the Hacienda,
and on the land between the postoffice and Lake Lagunita. (Areas
3 and 4).
A second major part of this functional plan would be a possible re -
grouping of student activities into a central area to be placed either neai
the vicinity of the old Union or in the area between the Row and Roble
The centralization would provide adequate space for dances, bowling,
offices for student government and activities, a record library, Jounges,
and such commercial concerns as the bookstore, barbershop, and a clothing
store.
The quarters of the Daily, the Quad, the Chaparral, and the University
Press, would all be included in a new publications center, a unit of the
student activities center. Proposed also is a now postoffice to be located
next to the publications center so as to cffect more efficient coordination
of press activities.
SCIENCE QUAD INCLUDES NEW BUILDINGS
To the west of the present Quad, a Science Quadrangle would embrace
the major sciences in a group of buildings linked together by arcades
Included would be chemistry, engineering, physics, mineral sciences, and
prc-medicine, each with increased modern laboratory and research spacr
The new Law School, the plans for which have been completed, will
replace what is now the Administration building. Construction will begin
as soon as building prices have stabilized sufficiently, stated Thomas A
Spragens, assistant to Dr. Tresidder.
Offices vacated in the present Law School will furnish a framework
for new administrative facilities, constructed along the President's office
theme of organization.
Revitalizing of the inner-quad for classrooms and office space is
also proposed. The rooms would be improved with new lighting, heat
ing. and changes in partitions, in accordance with Mumford's plan
for effective space utilization.
Near to Memorial Hall, the planners arc contemplating a new music
building, adjacently placed to all university productions.
New buildings will generally be simple, low-storied structures, one or
two stories high but rather long and low in block like form, that will
harmonize with but not duplicate the present heavy masonry used in c.o»>
struetion of the original buildings.
NEW CAMPUS ROAD SYSTEM PLANNED
The white-paper strips representing the proposed new system <>112
peripheral roads designed to keep the academic area free of the disturb
ance of automobile traffic now forms almost a rectangle around the aca
demic center of the campus. Residential areas could be reached by roads
branching off to the East and West near the Quadrangles.
Behind "the plan." lie several years of concentrated work by
Spencer and his staff, who will continue to develop this long-range de
velopment.
Before the plans may be realized even in the distant future, said
General Secretary Thomas P. Carpenter, there must be financial aid a
nearly all the university funds are in trusts and in stipulated endowment
foi specific purposes. Current expenditures, which is not in such stipn
lated funds, and necessary immediate rebuilding use most of the inonev,
ht added.
Dr. Tresidder summarized the situation when lie said. "Planning is but
one phase of the preparations for the problems of tomorrow."
