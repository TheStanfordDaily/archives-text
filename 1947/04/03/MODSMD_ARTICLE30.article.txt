# Law Students Visit Courts
## 
### 
An insight into the workings of
courts was gained by a group of
students from the Law School during
the spring vacation when they toured
the federal and state courts in San
Francisco.
The trip also enabled the students
to visualize the actual workings in
volved in the cases studied in law
courses according to Olivia Cross
and Glen Fuller, two of the students
who made the trip.
HEAR LOCAL CAB DISPUTE
In the District Court of Appeals
they heard oral arguments on sev
eral cases including the one con
cerning the Yellow Cab Company in
Palo Alto and its exclusive right to
pick up passengers at the Southern
Pacific depot. The lawyers, Nathan
Finch for the Yellow Cab Co. and
Adron Beene for the contesting cab
companies, are former Stanford
students.
The group also heard a case in
which the accused was alleged to
have stolen penicillin from an Army
transport in Shanghai. The case was
dismissed for failure to make a case.
ADDRESSED BY FARM GRADS
Justices Maurice T. Dooling of the
District Court of Appeals, Homer R.
Spence of the Supreme Court, and
C. J. Goodell of the Superior Court
also addressed the group on the
workings of the courts. The first two
justices are former Stanford stu
dents.
"The judges were all friendly, help
ful, and anxious to give the students
all the information possible even
though the judges were very busy
with the courts then in session"
Fuller and Miss Cross said.
The trip was organized by John
Porter, a law student, with the aid
of Professor James E. Brenner, of
the Law School.
