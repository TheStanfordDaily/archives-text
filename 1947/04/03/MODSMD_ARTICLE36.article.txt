# Ham's Head Wants Spring Show Scripts
## 
### 
Spring has sprung, and again
Ram's Head is on the hunt for an
original musical comedy for the
Spring Show, slated for May lt> and
17. Scripts should be turned in by
Saturday noon to Bob Ashley,
Ram's Head spokesman, at the
S.A.E. house or the Dramatic Coun
cil office.
DROPPED DURING WAR
The show, Ashley said, is a tradi
tional Ram's Head production put
on by an all-campus cast. During
the war original scripts were dis
carded due to the lack of talent and
regular professional shows were
produced, he said, but now that
post-war headaches are in order the
original shows are making their re
appearance.
With selection of the script out of
the way, he said, Ram's Head will
turn to the selection of a chorus.
Ashley urges all students to try out
at auditions slated for Thursday,
April 10. from 2 to 5 p.m., and Fri
day, April 11, from 7 to 10 p.m., at
the Ram's Head room.
CHORUS OR CREW WORK OPEN
During these times students may
sign up for either chorus or crew
work, he said. Lead singers will be
chosen from the chorus, and speak
ing parts will be offered to inter
ested choristers. Acting tryouts will
be held between 7 and 10 p.m. on
April 14 and 15.
All students participating in the
show will be given points toward
admission to Ram's Head, honorary
dramatic society, said Ashley, and
the organization contributing the
most toward the show will receive
the Ram's Head plaque.
