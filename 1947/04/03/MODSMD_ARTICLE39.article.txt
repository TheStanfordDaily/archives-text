# Gym Reports Fewer Thefts
## 
### 
In spite of increased enrollment
and doubling up in lockers, thefts
in the Men's Gymnasium have been
reduced to practically nothing this
year as compared to losses amount
ing to close to $1,000 last year, ac
cording to Jake Irwin, manager of
Encina Gym store.
RULES All) IN DECREASE
Helping to eliminate the thefts is
strict enforcement of locker room
rules, which include the following:
1. Guests are not permitted to use
the locker rooms.
2. Towels cannot be taken from
athletic buildings and grounds, and
personal towels are not to be
brought into the gym.
3. Lockers are to be kept locked
at all times. (In every case of lock
er theft, the locker had been left
open.)
4. On Sept. 1 all lockers are
cleaned out and combinations are
changed. All personal gear left in
lockers is confiscated.
NO THEFTS SO FAR
From Jan. 1, 1940. until the end of
summer quarter, over $800 in cash
had been stolen aside from clothing
and gym equipment. No thefts have
been reported so far this year, said
Irwin.
The possibility of increased ob
servance of the Fundamental Stand
ard is made evident by the fact that
the Women's Gym reports a sharp
reduction in locker room thefts, al
though no strict enforcement of
locker room rules was attempted.
The Women's Gym states that the
losses reported last quarter were
negligible in number and value, due
mainly to loss rather than thelt.
