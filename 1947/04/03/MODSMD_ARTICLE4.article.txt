### 
LAKE SUCCESS. N.Y., April 2
(UP). — Great Britain passed the
Palestine crisis to the United Na
tions today by requesting a special
session of the General Assembly and
"an early settlement" of Palestine's
future.
Soon after Sir Alexander. Cado
gan, chief of the British U.N. dele
gation, recommended a special As
sembly meeting to seek a solution
of one of the world's sorest prob
lems, U.N. officials began polling the
55 United Nations. After 28 have
approved a special session, one will
be scheduled, probably for the sec
ond week of May. %
The British government promised
to give the Assembly a full account
of its 25-year-old League of Nations
mandate over the Holy Land.
The British said the Assembly
must determine '"the future govern
ment of Palestine" — a task which
may prove the severest test yet en
countered by the 15 - months - old
United Nations.
The note said a special session
should be called because of "the de
sirability of an early settlement''
and because of "the risk that the
General Assembly might not be able
to decidc upon its recommenda
tions" unless there is advance
spade-work.
