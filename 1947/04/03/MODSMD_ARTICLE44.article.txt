The Pacific Coast Conference is
playing footsie with the Bi?> Nine
•gain. The football marriage of the
two leagues was greeted by long
"id loud boos from the sports
brethren, but the same boys are ap
olauding the recent revival of tlie
inter-conference track meet.
The P.C-.C. - Big Nine einderfest
has been set for Cal's Edwards tSa
<liurn, June 28. The meet will be
scored like a regular dual meet,
willi three men from each confer
ence entering each event. What
with Illinois, last year's N.C.A.A.
champs, and Southern California,
N.C.A.A. runner-up, it should be
quite a show.
This track competition was start
ed back in H),'i7 but was baited after
the 1942 meet, which the Midwest
« rners won 70 '-s(»' ;.

Pacific Coast League baseball is
off to a roaring start. Big crowds
and an improved brand of ball
; hould make the League's 4711i sea
son the biggest and the best. The
Coasters think they are big league
caliber and they are out to prove it.
The pennant chase figures to be a
closie again with most of the ex
perts tabbing the Angels and the
Seals to fight it out for top spot. But
rny cabbage is riding with those
Oakland Oaks. Casey Stengel has
lost a lot of last year's second-place
team, but there is help on the way.
Casey is just the boy that can build
the Oaks into a winning combina
t ion.
It looks like the Seals will be
J ii*ht up there, too. Lefty O'Doul's
quad is loaded with pitching talent
and there is plenty of plate power.
Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacra
mento. and Seattle all have im
proved teams and can figure in the
pennant fight. Jimmy Dykes is
cooking trouble at Hollywood, and
the usually helpless Twinks could
easily prove to be the surprise of
the year. Only at Portland is the
picture black. The aging Bevos lack
.speed and batting power.
When the curtain comes down in
September, the lineup could read
like this:
1. Oakland Oaks
2. San Francisco Seals
Hollywood Stars
4. Sail Diego Padres
5. Los Angeles Angels
(!. Seattle Kainicrs
7. Sacramento Senators
X. Portland Beavers

There's been a lot of moaning
about Oregon State's failure in the
N.C.A.A. playoffs. The Beavers,
who were favored to win the title,
defeated Wyoming alter losing to
Oklahoma at Kansas City, 5(5-54.
This doesn't necessarily mean that
Coast basketball is inferior to the
rest of the country. Statistics show
that Coast cage teams won better
than 50 per cent of their intersec
tional games. Anyway, the flashy
Oregonians could probably clean up
on the Sooners in a longer series.
The sudden death playoff doesn't
mean much. Look what happened
in the Invitational. Ken' rcky's
Wildcats, with one of the or.su.id
i 11teams of recent years, got
I: nocked off by a good but certainly
not great Utah quintet.

Mel Patton, S.C.'s great sprinter,
turned in one of the most amazing
early season performances on rec
ord in the Trojan - Compton J.C.
dual meet down south last week.
Patton tripped off a 20.7 in the 220
Id break the oldest mark on the S.C.
books. Charlie Paddock set the rec
ord at 20.8 way back in 1921.
Patton also tore through a 100 in
!).5, and that's just one second off
the world's record, II Patton has
reached his peak form so early in
the season he may burn out before
long, but if he hasn't reached top
form yet. then watch out.

Bob Brown, ex-Stanford baseball
er. who cleaned up in the Interna
tional League last year and is with
the Yankees this year, has been
moved to third base and may get
the number one call at the hot cor
ner for the Yanks.

Bob Blatt, ski star from Palo Alto,
has returned to the University this
quarter, sifter a winter absence dur
ing which he competed against some
ol the world's top snowmen in West
Coast meets. In one of his more re
lent successes, he placed fourth in
the Harriman downhill ski race at
Sun Valley, Idaho, won by Edy
Pominger of St. Moritz, Switzer
land. A week earlier Blatt was de
clared combined events winner in
the Olympic trials over the same
course.
