# Rain Silences Big Farm Bats
## Red Nine Tops Fullerton, 4-0 
### LYNN CARMAN 
Stanford's baseball squad lost a
; close race to the elements here yes
terday afternon by a mere half
inning when a rain squall swept
across the Sunken Diamond to halt
the 4 to 0 uprising the Cardinals
were staging against Fullerton Jun
ior College.
The game was called at the end j
of four complete innings, with the j
game, as a result, going into the
record books as unofficial.
Hight-hander Dick Flatland, back j
on the mound for the first time since j
his appearances during spring va- J
cation, handcuffed the Hornets com
pletely as he strong-armed his way
through the abbreviated game. He
struck out three Fullerton batters,
while giving up but one hit and al- j
lowing no walks.
The Indians pushed across their I
first run in the second inning and i
added another in the third. They ;
' pushed two more across the plate I
in the fourth as storm clouds began
rolling in from the west.
In the meanwhile, the Hornets
were able to advance only one man
as far as second base, and gave no !
signs of an impending batting j
splurge as they waved at Flatland's I
offerings.
The Fullerton tilt yesterday
marked the return of the Cardinals |
to the Farm following their four
game swing through the Southland.
The game also gave the Indians a
last chance to oil up their bats be
fore going up against California's
hurlers Saturday afternoon.
The Cardinals haven't chalked up
a single victory over Cal's baseball

ers during the last five years of
competition, which means — count
ing the three-year wartime discon
tinuance of the series—that the Car
dinals have not won against Cal
since 1939. In fact, since 1931, Stan
ford has had to be content with five
diamond victories as the Bears have
lolled up the impressive total of 36
