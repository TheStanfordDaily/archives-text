## 
### 
Faced with an awesome eleven match schedule against highly touted
opponents, Stanford's 1947 tennis team will travel to Stockton Saturday
afternoon to meet College of Pacific for the initial stop on the '47 schedule.
The host Tigers will roll out the welcome mat for the Indian visit, but
the powerful C.O.P. net team will drop the formalities before the after-

noon is over. Leading the Tiger i
offense is slamming Hank Pfister who ,
made his mark in the tennis world
while still a student at Commerce I
High School in San Francisco. The
hitcst achievement on the Pfister
success story has been his advance
ment to the quarter finals of the
Northern California Inter-collegiate
tournament at Berkeley.
Meanwhile. Indian fortunes in the
Berkeley clambake have tumbled at

an alarming rate. In fact, the local
entry in the tourny has been all but
eliminated from serious contention.
Ted Meyers, tÂ«>p seeded Cardinal,
tasted defeat early in the going when
Harry Roche of U.S.F. pulled a mild
6-1. 7-5 upset. The sharp Don frosh
netster matriculates at the second
singles post on the undefeated
U.S.F. squad which bids well to
rule the Coast tennis scene.
In doubles play, the Stanford duo
of Drew Putty and Lucien Barbour
dropped a tight 6-4, 6-4 decision t<>
the first line California Bear team
of Gish and Beale. Finals in the
Berkeley tournament are scheduled
for today, weather permitting.
Coach Elwyn Bugge leads his in
experienced tennis team into the
back-breaking schedule which in
cludes dates with a continually im
proving Pacific Coast Conference.
U.C.L.A. seems to be the betting
favorite to cop the tennis bunting,
with U.S.C. right on the fringe of
the charmed circle.
Down in Westwood, Herbie Flam
has all of the Bruin fans excited over
h's sensational early season play.
The U.C.L.A. youngster ranks high
among the national Junior tennis
players.
