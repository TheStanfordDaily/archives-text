## 
### 
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y.. April 2
(UP). â€”The United Nations Security
Council tonight unanimously ap
proved permanent. American con
trol of Japanese-mandated islands
in the Pacific.
The Council granted the United
States a U.N. strategic trusteeship
over the islands, which means vir
tual sovereignty. It was probably
the most important decision which
the Council has made by unanimous
vote.
The agreement will go into efTcct
as soon as the U.S. Senate approves.
The plan specifically authorizes the
United States to fortify the islands,
close ofT the area at any time for
security reasons, and forbid foreign
nationals to enter the islands, which
arc scattered over more than 800,000
square miles of the Pacific.
British and Russian attempts to
amend the plan were defeated when
American delegate Warren Austin
reminded the Council that any im
portant change might force the Uni
ted States to drop the whole trus
teeship request. The United States
had asserted earlier that it would
keep the islands regardless of
whether the Council agreed.
