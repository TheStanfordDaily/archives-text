# Dunkel Poll Rates Utah As Top Five
## 
### REN CALLAWAY 
In a release made available to the
Daily today, Dick Dunkel s widely
accepted Converse-Dunkel Rating
System of collegiate basketball j
teams disclosed final standings of
the nation's top-flight quintets. Dun
kel's tabulations are based upon a
scoring correlation formula, and
give index numbers, not percentages.
They reflect the actual performance j
of the teams for the season just I
ended.
Among the nation's leading teams. I
Utah (80.4) was awarded first
place. Kentucky (79.i1), Holy Cross
(75.9). Oklahoma (72.2). and Wis
consin (72.1) were rated the four
next best. Oregon State (70.3) held
fifteenth position, while Washington
(70.2), Washington State (68.5),
and Oregon (68.0) were also among
the top "thirty teams. Not a single
P.C.C. Southern Division quintet
was rated in the upper thirty, while
three New York city area entries,
Long Island. C.C.N.Y., and St. John's,
all occupied high places.
Dunki'l's Far West rankings
gave Utah first place, with Oregon
State, Washington. Washington
State. Oregon. Wyoming, U.C.L.A.,
California, Whittier, Santa Clara,
Stanford, Denver, and Southern
California following in that order.
..Although these ratings originate
in the East. Dunkel's formula elimin
ates the possibility of a prejudiced
ranking. His poll throughout the!
season was based on previous re
sults, never upon personal beliefs or I
predictions. Undoubtedly the rela
tively low position of U.C.L.A. among 1
the nation's teams was partially based :
upon the Bruin's poor showing dur
ing their early Eastern tour.
The University of Oregon's sensa
tional rout of the powerful N.Y.U. in
the Gardens last December was a
decisive factor in the Webfeet's high
position. Meanwhile the O.S.C.
Beavers, although Coast Conference
Champions, created only a mediocre
impression upon Eastern cage fans.
