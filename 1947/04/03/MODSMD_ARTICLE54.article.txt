# Rebels Amaze Ted Williams; Newsom Dazzles Toledo Hens
## 
### 
The Dallas Rebels ihe TeAas
League worked a shift to end all
shifts today on Boston Red Sox out
fielder Ted Williams.
Everybody but t he pitcher and
the catcher retreated to the right
field bleachers and sat down.
After remaining seated for two or
three minutes while the amazed
Williams stood at the plate leaning
on his bat, the players returned to
their positions.
Manager A 1 Vincent and owner
George Schepps of the Rebels said
they figured it was the only safe
way to play Williams.
Meanwhile, down in Florida, vet
eran Bobo Newsom and rookie Scott
Gary combined to limit the Toledo
Mud Hens to one hit today and led
the Washington Senators to a 2 to 0

victory.
Newsom's two singles drove in
both Washington tallies. Glenn Wil
liard's single off Newsom in the
eighth was the lone Toledo hit.
