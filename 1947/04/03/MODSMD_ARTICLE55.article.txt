QUARTER MILE STRENGTH
Paced by three returning members
of last year's varsity in the persons
of George Grimes, A 1 Wilkins. and
Ted Off. the 4 JO prospects are
brighter this year as each of these
men is expected to be considerably
improved. Franklin Johnson, son of
"Pitch"' Johnson, Stanford track
coach 1941-1943, was a star sprinter
at Palo Alto High last year. He,
along with Bill Greenleaf, is the
most promising of the younger run
ners,
Grimes, who has already run
1:54.7 in the 880 this year, is again
leading the 880 men. Other veterans
from last year are OfT and A 1 Holu

event aganist California in 1940. and
