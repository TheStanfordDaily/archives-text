## To Get Rid of Hard Feelings 
### 
Much has been said around Stanford about
the lack of cooperation and understanding be
tween students and the administration. It is a
common complaint of students that they are
being gypped by the administration, that the
administration is interested mainly in getting
as much money as possible out 01 the students.
But there is another side to the story. Ad
ministration officials tend to feel that the stu
dents often get "too big for their breeches" and
try to meddle in affairs that do not concern
them and should not worry them.
There is a reason for both sides. It is true,
we think, that students often become excited
about things which needn't concern them; but
the reason they get all "hot and bothered" and
throw out criticism is that they are interested
in what's going on but can't find out what they
want to know. They think things are being
kept from them and therefore something
"fishy" must be going on.
Administration heads are too busy to talk to
all students v/ho want to find out about every
little thing that is going on, and many things
besides are of a confidential nature and can't
be talked about. Then, too, many officials are
loathe to talk to students because they feel
they have a belligerent attitude and are just
waiting to find out about some "fishy busi
ness," that they twist meanings of what is said.
If students come to them in a pleasant frame
of mind and with a constructive and under
standing attitude, they are glad to answer
questions.
Because these tendencies and attitudes ex
ist, we think there is a need for an administra
tion-student forum where four or five adminis

tration officials and four or five student officers
could get together about every two weeks and
discuss problems and questions on administra
tion and student policies and viewpoints. The
four or five would serve to check each other so
no false information would be given out and
several viewpoints in both groups would be
represented.
We think that through this forum, both
the student and administration leaders will
be able to act, knowing what the persons
living at Stanford really want done. Also
there would be less conflict between student
and administration policy because each
group would know what the other group
wanted to do and why.
Basically both the student leaders and ad
ministration leaders have the interests of Stan
ford at heait in whatever they do. It is a lack
of understanding of the problems facing each
group that causes so much friction on campus.
A forum might be the beginnings of a solution.

Cellar walkouts on Tuesday totaled 51.42!
At this rate the weekly totals for this quarter
will equal and probably exceed those of last
quarter.
Those in charge of the Cellar report that the
commonest offenders are those students who
order items on several checks and then only
pay for one check.
If the Cellar walkouts don't drop there is a
possibility that a turnstile system will replace
the present free-and-easy system which makes
the Cellar as enjoyable as it is.

Cellar walkouts on Tuesday totaled 51.42!
At this rate the weekly totals for this quarter
will equal and probably exceed those of last
quarter.
Those in charge of the Cellar report that the
commonest offenders are those students who
order items on several checks and then only
pay for one check.
If the Cellar walkouts don't drop there is a
possibility that a turnstile system will replace
the present free-and-easy system which makes
the Cellar as enjoyable as it is.
Much has been said around Stanford about
the lack of cooperation and understanding be
tween students and the administration. It is a
common complaint of students that they are
being gypped by the administration, that the
administration is interested mainly in getting
as much money as possible out 01 the students.
But there is another side to the story. Ad
ministration officials tend to feel that the stu
dents often get "too big for their breeches" and
try to meddle in affairs that do not concern
them and should not worry them.
There is a reason for both sides. It is true,
we think, that students often become excited
about things which needn't concern them; but
the reason they get all "hot and bothered" and
throw out criticism is that they are interested
in what's going on but can't find out what they
want to know. They think things are being
kept from them and therefore something
"fishy" must be going on.
Administration heads are too busy to talk to
all students v/ho want to find out about every
little thing that is going on, and many things
besides are of a confidential nature and can't
be talked about. Then, too, many officials are
loathe to talk to students because they feel
they have a belligerent attitude and are just
waiting to find out about some "fishy busi
ness," that they twist meanings of what is said.
If students come to them in a pleasant frame
of mind and with a constructive and under
standing attitude, they are glad to answer
questions.
Because these tendencies and attitudes ex
ist, we think there is a need for an administra
tion-student forum where four or five adminis

tration officials and four or five student officers
could get together about every two weeks and
discuss problems and questions on administra
tion and student policies and viewpoints. The
four or five would serve to check each other so
no false information would be given out and
several viewpoints in both groups would be
represented.
We think that through this forum, both
the student and administration leaders will
be able to act, knowing what the persons
living at Stanford really want done. Also
there would be less conflict between student
and administration policy because each
group would know what the other group
wanted to do and why.

ministration leaders have the interests of Stan
