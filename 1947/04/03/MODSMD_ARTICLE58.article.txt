Could it be that our good old University admin
istration plans to dispose of all the various women's
housing units? That's the story I hear and it sounds
awfully logical. Supposedly, the University is tired
of performing the duties of a landlord.
The women's residences, you know, are old so
rority houses. When the sororities were knocked in
the head the University had to buy up all the houses.
Now the real estate market has hit its peak and is
expected to slide downhill, and the Administration
doesn't want to be left holding a lot of bags—er. par
don me—houses.
That, of course, leads to a very pertinent ques-

tion: Will the men EVER get
Branner back? If all the housing
units are sold to private parties,
the women will he even more I
cramped for living space than!
ever. Branner was built for men, J
but right now it's a good bet that
they'll continue on the outside
looking in. . .
There is only one way out: a
Stanford' man must confess to the
Black Dahlia killing. Of course

there have been several confessions already, none
oi which were accepted—but this time it must be
made to stick. A public-spirited rough must study
up on all the details of the case so he can't bo tripped

up. His confession must be accepted and he must
be executed in the gas chamber. This is a drastic
expedient, but the cause makes the sacrifice worth
while. Stanford men will keep candles burning to
the martyr's memory forever.
Why? The answer is obvious. In the face of such
had publicity girls would withdraw from Stanford
by the hundreds, and Branner would be brought
back into the fold. It's the only way.
On second thought, though, perhaps that isn't
such a good idea. Our young co-eds are considered
sweet, innocent, and naive—but ARE they? Women
being such perverse creatures, the fact that a Stan
t'ord man was ostensibly the Dahlia killer might at
tract more and more women to school; the Adminis
tration might give them Toy on, too. Then where
would we be?
One recent event especially makes me doubt the
innocence of a great number of our feminine com
patriots. A friend of mine recently had a date with
one of tlie younger girls, and they went to a local
spot where they dispense liquid refreshments (she
was drinking coke, he says). A gentleman seated
nearby started singing a little ditty called "I Used
to Work in Chicago But I Don't Work There Any
More," but the gentleman in question stumbled on
the second verse and needed prompting.
My friend reports that the innocent young date
knew the words better than he did.
