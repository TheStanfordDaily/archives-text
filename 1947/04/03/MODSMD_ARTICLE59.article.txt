### STEVE MARTIN 
Results of the Moscow conference to date have
been bad. ll scorns that Mr. Molotov—and, through
him. the entire Soviet Union—has little desire to co
operate on any subject at all. That is just one more
proof that Henry Wallace and his group of appeasers
are completely wrong. It takes two sides to make a
fight. the old proverb says: that may not be strictly
true, but it certainly does take two sides to make an
agreement.
Il has been proven time and again—especially in
the last few years—that co-operation cannot be one
sided. The United States has not been altogether
blameless in the friction that has arisen since the end
of the war, but on the whole I think we're agreed
that the thing we want most —for ourselves and for
the rest ot the world—is peace. We fool that each
nation should bo allowed to follow its own destiny
without interference from the outside.
The Soviet Union obviously does not believe this;
the leaders of the Russian state, I moan. Every move
Russia has made since the end of the war apparently
has boon designed to aggrandize either her territo
rial holdings or her influence. I see little difference
beiwoen Russia today and Germany in IC3O. We may
yet be able to achieve peace-—but wo can't do it by
appeasement.
Two eminent men have recently stated that had
Russia been first to harness atomic energy—rather
than til - United States they would already have be
gun waging an atomic war against us. William Bul

litt was the first U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union
and at one time was extremely pro-Russian. He feels
now that the world will be a dangerous place in
which to live so long as the present hierarchy main
tains its power in Moscow.
George H. Earle went further than Bullitt. He
thinks that within the next 10 years 90 per cent of us
will be dead. That is a bit extreme —the world has
faced such monstrous threats before —but all the
other things he has to say should not be discounted
for that reason. Ho is a former Governor of Penn
sylvania and during the war was U.S. representative
in Bulgaria and Turkey. He has had a chance to see
the Soviets in operation at close quarters.
These men fear the future because they distrust
the men in the Kremlin. Events have shown that
their fears are not without basis. The United States
right now is the most powerful nation in the world
and thus will be first on the list of any powerful
aggressor. Russia, through its actions in Poland. Fin
land. the Baltic States, Rumania, Austria—in short,
wherever the Red Army has gone —has shown itself
to be an aggressor nation.
That's why we should be thankful that George C.
Marshall is Secretary of State, rather than Henry
Wallace. II there is any way to i»ain a lasting peace
out of the present mess, Marshall will do it. If there
i.s not. he will at least return from Moscow with this
country as strong as before. And if he fails—the
United States will need every ounce of strength it
can muster.

sylvania and during the war was U.S. representative
in Bulgaria and Turkey. He has had a chance to see
the Soviets in operation at close quarters.
These men fear the future because they distrust
the men in the Kremlin. Events have shown that
their fears are not without basis. The United States
right now is the most powerful nation in the world
and thus will be first on the list of any powerful
aggressor. Russia, through its actions in Poland. Fin
land. the Baltic States, Rumania, Austria—in short,
wherever the Red Army has gone —has shown itself
to be an aggressor nation.
That's why we should be thankful that George C.
Marshall is Secretary of State, rather than Henry
Wallace. II there is any way to i»ain a lasting peace
out of the present mess, Marshall will do it. If there
i.s not. he will at least return from Moscow with this
country as strong as before. And if he fails—the
United States will need every ounce of strength it
can muster.
Results of the Moscow conference to date have
been bad. ll scorns that Mr. Molotov—and, through
him. the entire Soviet Union—has little desire to co
operate on any subject at all. That is just one more
proof that Henry Wallace and his group of appeasers
are completely wrong. It takes two sides to make a
fight. the old proverb says: that may not be strictly
true, but it certainly does take two sides to make an
agreement.
Il has been proven time and again—especially in
the last few years—that co-operation cannot be one
sided. The United States has not been altogether
blameless in the friction that has arisen since the end
of the war, but on the whole I think we're agreed
that the thing we want most —for ourselves and for
the rest ot the world—is peace. We fool that each
nation should bo allowed to follow its own destiny
without interference from the outside.
The Soviet Union obviously does not believe this;
the leaders of the Russian state, I moan. Every move
Russia has made since the end of the war apparently
has boon designed to aggrandize either her territo
rial holdings or her influence. I see little difference
beiwoen Russia today and Germany in IC3O. We may
yet be able to achieve peace-—but wo can't do it by
appeasement.
Two eminent men have recently stated that had
Russia been first to harness atomic energy—rather
than til - United States they would already have be
gun waging an atomic war against us. William Bul

litt was the first U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union
and at one time was extremely pro-Russian. He feels
now that the world will be a dangerous place in
which to live so long as the present hierarchy main
tains its power in Moscow.
George H. Earle went further than Bullitt. He
thinks that within the next 10 years 90 per cent of us
will be dead. That is a bit extreme —the world has
faced such monstrous threats before —but all the
other things he has to say should not be discounted
for that reason. Ho is a former Governor of Penn
