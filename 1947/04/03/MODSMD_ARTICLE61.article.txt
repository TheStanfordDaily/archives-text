. I "How shall I ever be able to trust
them again?" This was the com
ment of Professor J. W. Mcßain,
I eminent physical chemist, when he
\ discovered that his wife and son had
| known about the surprise party
j given him in honor of his 65th birth
-1 day Friday, March 21, by his stu
j dents.
Mrs. Edna Mahler, Professor Mc-
Bain's secretary, was the one who
j planned the banquet and, with the
; help of several students and Mrs.
J Mcßain. carried the plans to a suc
cessful outcome without the know
ledge of the professor.
Mrs. Mahler and the students
compiled letters and pictures from
about 90 of tlie professor's former
students and presented them to him
i at the dinner in a big serapbook with
THE McBAIN CORPORATIONS en
graved on the cover.
SIXTYFIVE GUESTS
There were 05 persons gathered in
| L'Omellette's big banquet room—
; all either past or present students,
! "collaborators" or "Mcßainiacs" as
he calls them, of the professor, some
of whom had come from as far as
Oregon to attend the party. Many of
those who couldn't come sent letters
and telegrams of greeting to him.
Professor Mcßain proudly looked
at the group and said, "This group
will only get together once in 05
years. Perhaps they'd all come to
my 130 th brithday party."
Before coming to Stanford in 1!)27,
I Professor Mcßain taught at Bristol
University in England and he still
hears from his "collaborators" there.
Professor Mcßain will retire from
teaching at the end of this year, but
; not from work. He intends to keep
on doing reserch and will also
I continue giving lectures to chemists
on the Shell Development Company.
ONLY A "QUERY"
At the banquet, when toast
master Bill Sutton presented Profes-
I sor Mcßain with a "Shield of
; Achievement" presenting several of
the professor's most important dis
coveries and innovations, the pro
; lessor remarked that the only thing
! that he had really contributed was
the "query" after one formula, fie
stated that his students had done the
rest. That comment was, according
to his students, entirely typical ol
Professor Mcßain.

-1 day Friday, March 21, by his stu
j dents.
Mrs. Edna Mahler, Professor Mc-
Bain's secretary, was the one who
j planned the banquet and, with the
; help of several students and Mrs.
J Mcßain. carried the plans to a suc
cessful outcome without the know
ledge of the professor.
Mrs. Mahler and the students
compiled letters and pictures from
about 90 of tlie professor's former
students and presented them to him
i at the dinner in a big serapbook with
THE McBAIN CORPORATIONS en
graved on the cover.
SIXTYFIVE GUESTS
There were 05 persons gathered in
| L'Omellette's big banquet room—
; all either past or present students,
! "collaborators" or "Mcßainiacs" as
he calls them, of the professor, some
of whom had come from as far as
Oregon to attend the party. Many of
those who couldn't come sent letters
and telegrams of greeting to him.
Professor Mcßain proudly looked
at the group and said, "This group
will only get together once in 05
years. Perhaps they'd all come to
my 130 th brithday party."
Before coming to Stanford in 1!)27,
I Professor Mcßain taught at Bristol
University in England and he still
hears from his "collaborators" there.
Professor Mcßain will retire from
teaching at the end of this year, but
; not from work. He intends to keep
on doing reserch and will also
I continue giving lectures to chemists
on the Shell Development Company.
ONLY A "QUERY"
At the banquet, when toast
master Bill Sutton presented Profes-
I sor Mcßain with a "Shield of
; Achievement" presenting several of
the professor's most important dis
coveries and innovations, the pro
; lessor remarked that the only thing
! that he had really contributed was
the "query" after one formula, fie
stated that his students had done the
rest. That comment was, according
to his students, entirely typical ol
Professor Mcßain.
