# 'Toonerville Trolley' Toted Injuns
## 
### STU FITCH 
When the Farm's Toonerville
Trolley clanged to a stop beside the
Press Building, as likely as not the
conductor who yelled "End of the
line!" was William Rohner, at pres
ent a Stanford gardener.
Rohner spent 22 of his 64 years
hauling passengers from the train
station, along F,l Camino to the
woods just north of the Stadium. !
then up past Eneina, across the lot
in haek of the Education Building
to the street just above the Book
store.
He went to work for the Penin
sula Lines in 1010. The company
gave up the campus run in 1930 anr'
Rohner quit in '32 to join the Stan
ford Family as gardener in ehargc
of the Amphitheater, where he still
works.
MISS A LOT'
"Kids miss a lot by not having the
"Toonerville Trolley'," lie says
Rohner is full of stories about thr
Encina inmates who then gave up i
watcrbagging for soaping the rails j
That, was one of their favorite
tricks, he says, and many times he
took a 50-foot "skate" before re
gaining control of his car.
The conductor's day started al
0:10 a.m. and continued until mid
night. During the early days street
cars ran every 20 minutes, but with
increasing demand they went, on a i
10-minute schedule.
Rohner rnn remember home foot- '

ball games when he met the City
train and hauled boisterous rooters
•o the Stadium. One time he col
lected 108 five - cent fares before
starting the run.
That was somewhat of a record,
considering the streetcar's seating
capacity of 50 persons. "Those that
wern't qardined in the ear or its

open platforms were hanging on the
back and sides." he rccalls.
But the poor Toonerville took just
as big a beating when the team
played away from home, according
to Rohner. The returning Cards
would board the streetcar after get
ting off the train, and as usual Farm
fans were there to meet them

j Again the trolley was loaded I"
| better t ban triple capacity, and
j those who couldn't find room would
j climb tip on the roof. "It was noth
i ing to have about 40 or 50 people up
j there," .says Rohner.
One of the roof set's favorite
I tricks was to bounce to see if it
would cave in. "Fortunately il nev
er did." he says.
Another prank the Encina lad
! used to pull was to block tlic tracks.,
j If they didn't do it with th*» poll
cart they used to gather bonfire
t wood, they would form a eontinu
! ous walking linn in front of the car.
OIJ) 21 S WRECK
Hut the most famous trolley story
of all is the "Wreck of Old 21," says
Rohncr. The "21" jumped the wire
smack in the middle of the railroad
tracks down on the highway with
only the conductor and motorman
: aboard. They jumped out, and one
! at each end. tried to get the thing
j reconnected.
Pretty soon a freight train stal led
I rolling toward them, and the men
j worked too hard. As a result, the
j sensitive trolleys were jerked, not
! eased, into their position and re
fused to stay put.
The frustrated conductor and mo
torman finally gave up and ran to
safety, and the freight train engi
neer, seeing he could not stop, in
! creased his speed and neatly spread
the "21" all over the highway
