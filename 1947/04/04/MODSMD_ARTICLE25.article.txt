# NSO Policy Stresses Foreign Cooperation
## 
### 
To broaden the channels of exchange of ideas, students, and
relief between the youth of other countries and the United States,
the NSO devoted one of its four panels at the Chicago convention
1o forming a program for international action.
Students in Europe organized in the International Union of

Students at a convention in Prague I
last year. The N.S.O. has been au
thorized to send five observers to j
>!it next Prague meeting this sum
mer if the regions provide the finan
cial assistance.
A monthly bulletin is planned to i
net as a clearing house on all data j
mailable from European countries ;
<<n needs for assistance from Ameri- ;
< an students, as well as opportuni- !
tins abroad for education and travel!
ifi connection with rehabilitation. It
will also attempt to facilitate co
ordination of relief efforts of siu
di nt.s throughout America, by the
< xehange of information at regular i
intervals.
KIJSOLUTIONS PASSED
Oilier resolutions passed at the
convention determining the interna
tional program of N.S.O. are: (1)
The N.C.C. (National Continuations
Council, explained in yesterday's ar
ii le) should establish a temporary
committee to act as clearing house
for information on student ex
< bnnge, travel, relief, and rehabili
tation. Until June, this committee
will be the Harvard Student Coun
cil Committee on International Ac
tivities under the N.C.C. and will
work with other organizations in this
(2) The N.C.C. should refer to all
e.i.ling international organizations
wilh branches in the United States!
working in the field of the interna-!
lional student community for infor
mation and co-operation and so that
a working list of these organizations
111ii'111 be established.
PERMANENT AGENCY
(.''<) The N.C.C. should take up and !
refer to the N.S.O. that a perma-1
n< nt student travel and hospitalityl
agency be set up. This organ is to I
co-operate with all existing organi-I
/ations in facilitating student tours |
. ikl travel. This committee should j
investigate such projects as co-op- j
el ation with the American Youth J
Hostel efforts toward securing the |
release of a Liberty ship for cheap j

! universities. For instance, the
N.C.C. might call a meeting of all
I music schools and all interested mu
| sic majors for the purpose of es
-1 tablishing a cultural committee of
| music interests all over the country
: for the purpose of adopting foreign
â–  conservatories which have been de
j stroyed by the war. Each school
! could adopt its own conservatory
! with a view to helping it be rebuilt,
exchanging music and ideas.
(0) The N.S.O. should favor all
means of extending two-way stu
i dent exchanges by investigating the
; Fullbright Law and the Bloom Bill,
investigating the possibility of N.S.O.
| participating in the selection of
American students for student ex
changes. It would also provide a
bureau that will disseminate and
publicize information about courses
and opportunities for specialization
in foreign universities and colleges
for American students, and perform
the same service for foreign stu
dents. (The Harvard Bulletin han
dled this information in its first is
sue.)
PUBLICATIONS SET UP
(7) The N.C.C. should establish
a committee for the distribution of
foreign and international student
| publications and information on
I foreign students. This committee
1 should work with organizations al
; ready operating in this field.
(8) The N.S.O. should favor the
principle of NEED alone as the basis
of distribution of relief ond should
: investigate the problem of co-oper
' ation with World Student Relief in
! the realms of collecting relief funds
and distributing said funds.
(9) The N.S.O. should favor the
I principle of increasing the number
j of scholarships given to foreign stu
! dents by American universities.
(Tomorrow: How is N.S.O.
formed regionally, what does it
plan to do, and what has it done?)
