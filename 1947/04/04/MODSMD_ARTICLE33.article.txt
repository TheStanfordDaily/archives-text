# Indians Battle J.C.s In First Track Meet
## 
### JOHN HUBBARD 
Weather permitting, Stanfords track team makes its 1947
debut tomorrow at Angell Field against a squad representing
Sacramento, Stockton, Salinas, and Modesto junior colleges.
Indian Coach Jack Weiershauser plans to use a few of his top
men, along with some less experienced prospects, in the meet.

Three of these J.C.'s Sacramento,
Modesto, and Salinas absorbed a
t.7-60 trouncing Monday l'rom Cali
fornia's junior varsity.
Comparison of the winning marks
tmng up in Monday's meet with the
best performances turned in by
Stanford's thinclads before spring

vacation indicates, on paper at
least, that the Indians should have
little trouble making their first start
a winning one.
Only in the 100-yard dash, two
mile run, and possibly the high
jump did any of the junior college
performers post a mark good enough
to top the best Stanford athletes
have done in pre-season workouts.
01 course any such calculations
arc a rough estimate at best. Stock
ton did not enter the Cal meet, and
no line is available on what that
school's trackmen have to offer.
Also there is no assurance that

Weiershauser will call upon his best
men in every event.
Operating at maximum strength,
the Indians would probably present
a front line of offense consisting of:
100-yd. dash — Marty Anderson,
Terry Maxwell, Bob Fess, Frank
Johnson, Al Vierthaler—lo..'s.
22 -Terry Maxwell, Al Vierthaler
—22.9.
440—Terry Maxwell—so. H.
880—Ted Off 2:<M).
Mile—Frank Ganahl—4:24.7.
Two-mile-—Ganahl 10:29.9.
High jump — Don Auxier, Mar
shall Hjelte.
Broad jump — Fred Fank —21 ft.
11 in.
Pole vault—Bill Larson—l3 ft. 3 4
in.
Shot put Otis Chandler—47 ft.
11 in.
Discus Steve McKee—l3s ft.
Javelin—Frank Held—l7B ft. 6 in.
High and low hurdles —Al Sny
der.
(All times, heights, and distances
listed were turned in before spring
vacation.)
Field events in Saturday's meet
will get under way at 1:45 p.m., with
the first track event scheduled for
2 p.m. No admission will be charged.
