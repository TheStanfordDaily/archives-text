# Stanford Crew Foots Bills To Corvallis—Nips O.S.C.
## 
### BEN CALLAWAY 
Last month, when most of t he
local students were preparing for
final exams, a band of twelve, rep
resenting the Farm's newly organ
ized crew, journeyed north to meet
and defeat a strong and heavily fa
vored Oregon State eight.
Leaving at dawn on a Thursday,
the Indian oarsmen traveled by car,
arriving at Corvallis about 2 o'clock
the following morning after a long
trip made even longer by jalopy
trouble and poor weather.
ItEAVERS WAIT IN RAIN
The visitors were pleasantly sur
prised when met at that late hour
by a gathering composed of mem
bers of the Beaver crew and other
interested students, who had await
ed their arrival in spite of driving
rain. Each of the Stanford men was
fiven room and board at an Oregon
State fraternity house. They were
also presented with complimentary
tickets to both of the 0..5C.-U.C.-
L.A. basketball playoff games played
that weekend.
Stan Baker, an alumnus from Sa
lem, donated a considerable sum of
cash to help meet travel expenses.
After the race, he treated the entire
aggregation to a steak dinner.
RED OARS ON WILLAMETTE
Friday afternoon red-tipped oars
were seen churning over the Wil
lamette River course, as the Stan
t'ord shellmen acquainted themselves
there with a time trial.
Oii' Saturday afternoon the vace
itself took place, under itnermittent
showers. A crowd of 2,000 Orego
nians braved the elements to wit
ness the 1,500-meter contest. Stan
ford, far from familiar with river
rowing, encountered an additional
disadvantage when it drew the lane
farthest from shore—thirty feet out
in the strong Willamette current
from its opponents.
However, the Indian oarsmen
were able to gain an early lead,
gradually lengthen it, and managed
to beat off Beaver attempts to over
take the Stanford shell. The Cardi
nals won by a length and a half
(about,six seconds' time). This was
th" first time a Stanford crew had
ever beaten Oregon State, as two

previous attempts had failed.
The triumphant rowers then made
the long return trip over many
snow-eovered miles, arriving back
on the Farm late Sunday.
.'MOVIES TAKEN OF RACE
Technicolor movies were taken of
the race and members of the first
shell, setting another precedent. The
first films ever taken of a Stanford
race, they will serve two purposes:
a document of historical interest
and a means of spreading news to
enthusiastic friends.
Encouraged by their success and
by the cordial manner in which
they hove been received, the Indian
oarsmen are now pointing to im
portant meets this spring against the
best competition the West has to
offer.

Oii' Saturday afternoon the vace
itself took place, under itnermittent
showers. A crowd of 2,000 Orego
nians braved the elements to wit
ness the 1,500-meter contest. Stan
ford, far from familiar with river
rowing, encountered an additional
disadvantage when it drew the lane
farthest from shore—thirty feet out
in the strong Willamette current
from its opponents.
However, the Indian oarsmen
were able to gain an early lead,
gradually lengthen it, and managed
to beat off Beaver attempts to over
take the Stanford shell. The Cardi
nals won by a length and a half
(about,six seconds' time). This was
th" first time a Stanford crew had
ever beaten Oregon State, as two

previous attempts had failed.
The triumphant rowers then made
the long return trip over many
snow-eovered miles, arriving back
on the Farm late Sunday.
.'MOVIES TAKEN OF RACE
Technicolor movies were taken of
the race and members of the first
shell, setting another precedent. The
first films ever taken of a Stanford
race, they will serve two purposes:
a document of historical interest
and a means of spreading news to
enthusiastic friends.
Encouraged by their success and
by the cordial manner in which
they hove been received, the Indian
oarsmen are now pointing to im
portant meets this spring against the
best competition the West has to
offer.
Last month, when most of t he
local students were preparing for
final exams, a band of twelve, rep
resenting the Farm's newly organ
ized crew, journeyed north to meet
and defeat a strong and heavily fa
vored Oregon State eight.
Leaving at dawn on a Thursday,
the Indian oarsmen traveled by car,
arriving at Corvallis about 2 o'clock
the following morning after a long
trip made even longer by jalopy
trouble and poor weather.
ItEAVERS WAIT IN RAIN
The visitors were pleasantly sur
prised when met at that late hour
by a gathering composed of mem
bers of the Beaver crew and other
interested students, who had await
ed their arrival in spite of driving
rain. Each of the Stanford men was
fiven room and board at an Oregon
State fraternity house. They were
also presented with complimentary
tickets to both of the 0..5C.-U.C.-
L.A. basketball playoff games played
that weekend.
Stan Baker, an alumnus from Sa
lem, donated a considerable sum of
cash to help meet travel expenses.
After the race, he treated the entire
aggregation to a steak dinner.
RED OARS ON WILLAMETTE
Friday afternoon red-tipped oars
were seen churning over the Wil
lamette River course, as the Stan
t'ord shellmen acquainted themselves
there with a time trial.
