# Card Nine Faces Bears
## 
### LYNN CARMAN 
Can they do it? Can Stanford's j
underdog nine gang up on Califor- I
nia's talent-laden aggregation of vet- !
eran ballplayers and upset the Gol
den Bears—and the dope sheet—to
morrow afternoon in the Sunken
Diamond?
Well, yes—it's possible. But the
Cardinals have a long, rough pull
ahead of them if they are going to j
crash through to their first Big Game
victory in the last 17 BIG GAMES.
And apart from the traditional ri
valry with the Bears, the Farm ball
players badly need a victory over
Cal in order to climb up from tin ir
fourth place position in the Cali- !
ciation. Right now the Cardinals
l'ornia Intercollegiate Baseball Asso
have won but one league game in
four starts, whereas* California
soundly trounced St. Mary's in it'
only conference game.
STOTT MAY BE ON MOCND
Just who will take the mound lor '
the scalp-hungry Indians hasn't
been decided yet, for it depends on
f he improvement of Dave Stotl's ail--
ing right arm. If the soreness disap- '
pears between now and tomorrow
afternoon, the Farm mound ace will
handle the pitching chores.
But if Stott can't pitch tomorrow,
the hurling nod will go to Freshman J
Dave D«hle. the Farm southpaw who
has elbowed his way into the start- j
ing hurling ranks this spring.
Against one of these two Stanford
moundsmen, Coach Clint Evans of
Cal has the pick of an effective and
experienced pitching staff to choose '
his starter from. The choice narrows
dawn to Sophomore Dick Larner
and Freshman Nino Barnise, the two
who have proved most effective in
the Bears eight starts this season.
HE A lIS AKE LOADED
The Bears, who finished second in
conference play last spring, have
most of their regulars back and have '
added several pre-war standouts, in
cluding their 1943 circuit hatting
champ, to their fast-moving and
heads-up squad.
Cliff McClain pounded Coast pitch
ers for a .444 average four years
ago and also led the C.1.8.A. in runs
batted in. This spring, McClain is
back in right field for the Bears, j
and has just begun to round into
shape after suffering a wrenc'nod
back earlier in the.season.
With ..'>oo plus hitters such as Jim i
Fiscalini and Lyle Palmer teaming
up with McClain in the outfield, the i
Bears have the outer readies wo!i
stocked with a trio of returning let- j
.ermen who give the squad plenty of ;
power at die plate and lots of know
how in the field.
IHESIIMAN A REGULAR
I V simian Tim Cronin has made a
place *oi himself in the Ca! infit• I•.i j
wiiii iii:; heavy foiling and ; s

other three infielders are ah ieltir--

Shortstop Jim Brown and Third
Baseman Glenn Dufour. The last
two are .IiOO outers from le-i sea

But a heavy-hitting and fla.hy- ;

Wolum • n have in the Lack of their
"•in'U they set their -ial':.; o i the
Golden Dear.
The Cardinals dispensed with
practice yesterday as they all but
completed their preparations lor to
morrow's Big Game. With i licit
stalling lineup well set, and with
Wednesday's short game against
Fullerton Junior College providing
them vvitii a good tuneup game, die
Indians expect to go into lite game
in top shape.
INDIANS CAN EXPLODE
The Farm batting attack hinges on
whether or not the big bats of Lloyd
Merriman. Ted Nell, Benny Car
er,i;i!li ; n; 1 thv rest can con!, to life
against Cal's pitching. To date, ihis
season, the Cardinals h;u ° showed
a tendency o'f biding then time be
fore suddenly exploding with a Hur
ry of base hits and runs.
The Indians will be using the same
lineup they've been using all spring,
which means that Ward Walkup will
be catching. The infield shapes up
with Cardinalli at first, Nell at sec
ond. Buck Brownson at short, and
Bill Arce at third. Merriman and
A 1 Kircher will see action in the

outfield. willi tlii' third garden s k<l
not certain.
Jn addition to the varsity game,
the Cal and Stanford junior varsity
squads are slated to tangle tomor
row at 10 in a preliminary game.
Forrest Shumway will handle the
pitching for the Indians.
