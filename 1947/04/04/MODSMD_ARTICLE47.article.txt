## University Policy: A Good Sign 
### 
from our standpoint, yesterday's story on
University planning was one of the most sat
isfying pieces of news we've had the oppor
tunity to print in quite some time.
A few words of explanation about this story
might give the reader a better picture of what's
going on. During the latter part of February
a reporter received a "tip" which led to the
story. It has taken her since that time to ac
complish the research and interviews which
finally produced yesterday's story.
Without a good deal of cooperation from
University authorities such a story could not
have been accurately printed.
Naturally, we are pleased to have produced
the story, but at the same time we feel that
such information should have been forthcom
ing from the University long before this.
During January a healthy and very welcome
interest in student activities by University
officials blossomed forth. It was manifested in
attendance at student meetings, talking with
student leaders, and a far more pleasant recep
tion of students calling at University offices.
It is gratifying to see these men taking per
haps more time than their jobs allow them to
spare to discuss problems which might to
older men seem quite trivial.
However, such action will pay off eventu
ally not only financially but in good will for
which Stanford has been noted in the past.
It is very important that such a policy be
continued and extended where ever possible,

for talks with Alumni during the vacation
reveal that an uneasy feeling about Stanford
policies is transferring to them from the stu
dents, a feeling which will not be stopped by
official University publications and talks to
alumni groups.
When facts are kept from people they nat
urally grow suspicious of any act, whether or
not their suspicions are justified. This has
been the case at Stanford during the past year.
Such a feeling can only be stopped by tak
ing into rather complete confidence the stu
dents and alumni regarding University prob
lems. If this is done properly such action will
undoubtedly win support -rather than oppo
sition toward new proposals.
It is encouraging to see such a policy begin
ning to work.
