# Will Walkouts Decrease?

### 
Cellar walkouts for Wednesday totaled
53.10, an increase of 51.68 over Tuesday's
51.42 in walkout losses. It has been suggested
that if walkout losses do not decrease a turn
stile system may have to replace the present
open, honorable system for paying checks.
Such a move would not only be an attack on
the honor of Stanford students but would be
a nuisance interfering with the easy-going
atmosphere the Cellar now has. If everyone
watches to see that he does not forget to pay
his own check, this move will not have to be
taken. N.B.
