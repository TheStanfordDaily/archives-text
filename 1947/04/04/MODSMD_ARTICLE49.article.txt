Have you ever heard of "Good Housekeeping?"
That's a magazine for women to which my sister-in
law subscribes. It has .'!()() pages, of which at least
2!)0 are devoted to advertising and recipes, I was
thumbing through the latest copy the other day
(looking at the bra ads) when an article caught my
eye.
The article was called "What Mistakes Do YOU
Find?" The author bad raked together a lot of mis
prints that have appeared in newspapers, magazine,
;ijkl books, and sold the result for about 200 fish.
Why don't I ever think of something like that?
Of course the first thing he did was explain that

weird and seemingly cabalistic
phrase, "etaoin shrdlu," which
means nothing at all. You have
probably seen it in The Daily from
time to time. It just happens that
those letters form the first two
vertical rows of keys on a Lino
type keyboard. When the operator
fouls up a line he just hits those
two rows of keys to fill up the line
and get it out of the way. It's sup
posed to be discarded, but some-

times hi' forgets to throw it out and the proofreaders
and the makeup' man miss it.
Misprints are often very lunny, and have at times
led to libel suits. It is especially startling it the mis
take occurs in a large headline. Often a faux pas of
this sort is unprintable, such as the headline in the

I
University of Pennsylvania paper about a shot putter.
The article in "Good Housekeeping" tells of a
story in a weekly newspaper which read. "The mem
bers of St. John Baptist Church with the pastor in
bed . . . . and had a lovely meeting; reports were
good: amount $37.80."
Another paper had a story on a church social and
in the headline proclaimed:
CHRISTMAS SALE OF
METHODIST WOMEN TO
BE HELD TUESDAY
Ambiguity of that sort is the bane of a newspaper
man's existence; it's always lurking in a corner, wait
ing to leap out unexpectedly. During the war (while
the MEN were gone) our own Daily had one that I j
shall never forget:
ETHEL WOODALL TO LEAD
JUNIOR PROM WITH STERN
Alter a bit of reflection that obviously means that i
a tfirl named Ethel Woodall will lead the Junior !
Prom, and that her partner is named Stern—but on i
first glance it seems to mean something else, espe- i
cially to an old Navy man. 4
Even the great. occasionally fall into the pit of j
ambiguity, howeyer. Mrs. Roosevelt, the erstwhile
world traveler, once wrote: "Alter supper with the j
Inen, we went back to dress."
But my favorite misprint of all time is a classic j
in an edition of the Bible which has since come to l>e
called the Devil's Bible. The third word was left out
of the seventh commandment.

The article was called "What Mistakes Do YOU
Find?" The author bad raked together a lot of mis
prints that have appeared in newspapers, magazine,
;ijkl books, and sold the result for about 200 fish.
Why don't I ever think of something like that?
Of course the first thing he did was explain that

weird and seemingly cabalistic
phrase, "etaoin shrdlu," which
means nothing at all. You have
probably seen it in The Daily from
time to time. It just happens that
those letters form the first two
vertical rows of keys on a Lino
type keyboard. When the operator
fouls up a line he just hits those
two rows of keys to fill up the line
and get it out of the way. It's sup
posed to be discarded, but some-

times hi' forgets to throw it out and the proofreaders
and the makeup' man miss it.
Misprints are often very lunny, and have at times
led to libel suits. It is especially startling it the mis
take occurs in a large headline. Often a faux pas of
this sort is unprintable, such as the headline in the

I
University of Pennsylvania paper about a shot putter.
The article in "Good Housekeeping" tells of a
story in a weekly newspaper which read. "The mem
bers of St. John Baptist Church with the pastor in
bed . . . . and had a lovely meeting; reports were
good: amount $37.80."
Another paper had a story on a church social and
in the headline proclaimed:
CHRISTMAS SALE OF
METHODIST WOMEN TO
BE HELD TUESDAY
Ambiguity of that sort is the bane of a newspaper
man's existence; it's always lurking in a corner, wait
ing to leap out unexpectedly. During the war (while
the MEN were gone) our own Daily had one that I j
shall never forget:
ETHEL WOODALL TO LEAD
JUNIOR PROM WITH STERN
Alter a bit of reflection that obviously means that i
a tfirl named Ethel Woodall will lead the Junior !
Prom, and that her partner is named Stern—but on i
first glance it seems to mean something else, espe- i
cially to an old Navy man. 4
Even the great. occasionally fall into the pit of j
ambiguity, howeyer. Mrs. Roosevelt, the erstwhile
world traveler, once wrote: "Alter supper with the j
Inen, we went back to dress."
But my favorite misprint of all time is a classic j
in an edition of the Bible which has since come to l>e
called the Devil's Bible. The third word was left out
of the seventh commandment.

Have you ever heard of "Good Housekeeping?"
That's a magazine for women to which my sister-in
law subscribes. It has .'!()() pages, of which at least
2!)0 are devoted to advertising and recipes, I was
thumbing through the latest copy the other day
(looking at the bra ads) when an article caught my
eye.
