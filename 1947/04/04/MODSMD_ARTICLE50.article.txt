War ended in 1945 and Indian National Congress
leaders were also released alter three years confine
ment in jail. Events began to move fast in India. In
,«pite of the fact that Congress and Moslem League
leaders failed to come to an agreement, the enthusi
asm and hopes of the people began to rise sharply.
After students had given a lead to the country at the
end of 1945 by staging mass demonstrations and
strikes, the Koyal Indian Navy staged a sit down
strike in Bombay in February 194t> and went as far
as to threaten an armed battle with the British ships.
The British Government began to realize that
they could mi longer rely on the hitherto reliable In
dian Army. Meanwhile the temper of Indian people
was rising. It was also becoming clear that next time
India may abandon Gandhi's non-violence and take
to arms. The result was a new offer by the British'
government in April 1940, which has resulted in the
statement by Prime Minister At I lee that the British
will quit India before June I!) 48.
Thus far no agreement has been reached between
Congress and Moslem League despite numerous ef
forts. Mohammad Ali Jinnah, leader of Moslem
League insists on his demand for Pakistan <>r division
of India, which he bases on the assumption that the
Hindus and the Moslems belong to two different na
tions. Congress refuses to agree to this assumption
and thus to Pakistan though it is ready to give right
ol separations to different areas and provinces. Even
at pr< •sent efforts are being made to bring the two
parties together. In the meantime some people are
trying to exert pressure by staging and fighting
bloody riots. Some observers fear that a civil war
may break out if a solution to the problem is not
found immediately. Whether or not these predictions
will come true, nobody knows.
Ihit one thing that is obvious to me is that there
isn't as much danger of a civil war as American
news-correspondents and newspapers would have
us believe. News about India that reaches here is
highly disproportionate. We mainly get the news
about riots and deaths while other important events
and political developments are seldom published
here.
What the future of India? While trying to an
swer this question I will remind the readers that it
mainly rests on its people. And though it may seem
idealistic l«i say so. people ol India are on the march

to progress and prosperity. Difficulties will come in
their wayand there are plenty—but they are bound to
overcome them in the end. They have already made
some progress in this direction. Politically they have
won a great battle by practically becoming a free
country. The first Ambassador from India to America
is already in Washington.
Indian embassies in China and France have been
set up and very soon diplomatic relations with Rus
sia will be opened. India is supporting the United
Nations fully and its members are serving on dif
ferent U.N. committees. Even at present an ALL
Asiatic Conference is meeting in New Delhi to con
sider the economical, social and cultural problems of
Asia. Delegates from practically all Asiatic countries
as well as from Egypt and Asiatic Russia are attend
ing the conference.
In the economic field, huge efforts are being made
to industrialize India and to improve its agriculture.
Five power-dams on the pattern and scale of T.V.A.
are being planned and built at an estimated cost of
one billion dollars. Indian government is sending
more than GOO students every year to America, Aus
tralia, and Europe to study different branches of
Engineering. First Indian board for standardization
of manufactured goods has been set up.
Within the last six months three National Research
Laboratories for different sciences have been inaugu
rated. Efforts are being made to open as many en
gineering schools as possible. Indian national gov
ernment is giving lull attention to the education of
the people. A plan for primary eduction of India
by John Sargeant, an English educator is al
ready in operation. Government of India is ex
pected to spend more than 500 million dollars in the
next five years on primary education alone.
On the social side also India is making progress.
Already untouchables hold equal legal rights with
other Indians. There are two untouchable members
in the Interim cabinet consisting of 14 members.
Various movements are afoot to raise the status of
women in India. Trade Union movement is gaining
fast ground throughout India with support from peo
ple and the government.
Yes, the future looks hopeful as well as gloomy
lor India. 1 think and I hope that Indian people will
rise to the occasion and fight back their difficulties to
take a respectable place in the peaceful nations of the
world.
