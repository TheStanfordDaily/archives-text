# Greco-Turk Aid Endorsed

### 
WASHINGTON, April 3 (UP).â€”
President Truman's $400,000,000
Greco-Turkish aid bill was opproved
by the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee today with a surprise
amendment authorizing the United
Nations to halt the American pro
gram at any time by a simple ma
jority vote of its Security Council
or General Assembly.
The amendment, which the State
Department endorsed as a concilia
tory gesture to the U.N. and to Con
gressional critics who have clam
ored that the world organization
was being by-passed, stipulated that
the United States would not veto
any U.N. order to get out of Greece
or Turkey.
Committee members said the
amendment also meant that no oth
er Big Five power could veto a U.N.
directive to end the aid program.
That was viewed as a startling
departure in this country's relations
with the U.N. If approver! by Con
gress, it would mark the first time
that any of the Big Five powers has
offered to waive its veto power over
Security Council decisions.
