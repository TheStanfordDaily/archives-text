are the now members of the Re
search Institute J.tafT. All three will
be working on the natural rubber
research project that is now under
way at Stanford.
Dr. Gerstel comes to Stanford
from the University of California
where he has been conducting ge
netic research on tobacco. Dr.
Catcheside is on a six-month leave
of absence from Trinity College,

guayule shrub in connection with
the research project that the Insti
tute has undertaken for the Office
of Naval Research.
RUBBER INCREASE SOUGHT
The guayule research project is
concerned with increasing the per
centage of rubber in the guayule
shrub by means of breeding tech
niques, and increasing the hardiness
of the plant so that it may be grown
in colder climates.
The natural rubber research proj
