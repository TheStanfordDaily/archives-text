With their faces still ,-i little crim
son liotn January Ist s Arroyo Seco
Blood Bath, the UCLA football
team has trotted out into the warm
southern California sun for a little
Spring practice. Only 125 Bruins
greeted Coach Bert Laßrucheries
as compared to the 148 gridders
that answered Marchic Schwartz'
call.
Among the name players from
Hit-' 1946 Coast champions that are
returning are All-Coast center Don
Paul, All-Coast tackle Bill Cham
bers, and guards Bill Clements, Les
Stciner, and Mike Dimitro, plus a
whole flock of backs like little Ernie
Johnson, Johnny Roesch. the Bev
erly Ilills flash, and Benny Reiges.
A 1 Hoisch and Jerry Shipkey are
busy with the track team, and Cal
I'ossi and Moose Myers are playing
baseball, but they will be in uniform
next fall.
Bob Waterfield, the L. A. Ram's
great T-tactieian, has been signed
again to coach I fie Bruin signal
callers during the Spring stint. The
l-ruins may come up with another
great team, and they would like
nothing better than to get a crack
at any one of those Big Niners in
tl.< • Rose Bowl.

A very interesting story came out
ol the Seals recent San Francisco
. pring training stay in Hawaii. Re
porters from all the San Francisco
papers were taken along to pine
apple land with all expenses paid.
(No, the Daily sports staff was ne
glaeted when the invitations were
passed out.)
One of the writing crew, Bucky
Walter, got a little carried away
with all the hula babes, palm trees,
and hula babes and almost got
drowned at Waikaki.
Walter overestimated his paddling
powers and swam just a little tool
tar out. Just before he went down
lor the last time, he was hooked j
onto and pulled to safety by Mr. |
Lelty O'Doul, the Seals' great man
ager.
This event in itself would be un
usual. but as Bill Stern would say,
this is not the end of the story.
Walter's sports editor has been
conducting a heated campaign ;
against Charlie Graham and Paul I. |
Fagan, the Seals owners, for a year. ]
Now that O'Doul has saved the life
of one of his ace scribes, will he ease
up on the management of the Seals":
Those who know the sports editor in 1
question don't think he will.

Another important national sport
ing event will be held on the west
coast for the first time this year. 1
The San Francisco Olympic Club,
has been awarded the National
A.A.U. Senior Wrestling Champion
ships. The event is scheduled for j
this Friday and Saturday, April 11 j
and 12, in-the Club's well-equipped)
gym.
About 200 of the nation's outstand- '
ing amateur grunt and groaners will ;
be on hand for the Club's first I
national wrestling tournament. Invi- 1
tations have been extended to lead
ing wrestlers in universities, Y. M.
C. A.'s, and athletic clubs in 48
'.tales, Alaska, and Hawaii.
The West wood branch of the U.
of C. will present the National In- 1
tereollegiate Tennis tournament late
in June. This marks the first time
in the 67 year history of the N.C.A.A.
net event that it has been held on
the west coast. The Bruins are
: pending over $45,000 to get their
courts in shape for the Nationals.
Could be they are using a little of
that Rose Bowl lettuce.
