# Trackmen Triumph Over Jaycee Squads
## 
### 
Stanford's track team, making its first appearance of the sea
son, romped to a leisurely 104' -54 1 victory over the combined
junior college squads of Salinas, Stockton, Modesto, and Sacra
mento on the Angell Field ovel Saturday afternoon. The Indians
took blue-ribbon honors in 12 of the 15 events, and scored clean

* sweeps oi ine nrst three places in
I both the shotput and javelin.
Oik.' record fell by the wayside.
Husky Otis Chandler, bright frosh
prospect, sent out a shotput heave
ol 48 ft. 71 in., setting a new mark
I tor Stanford freshmen. He exceeded
j by almost five inches the previous
■ record of 48 ft. 2' in. made by Jim
Reynolds in 1934.
j On the whole, however, most of
tlie performances turned in by Coach
Jack Weiershauser's trackmen were
evidence that the Indians did not
operate at maximum strength in the
meet, and that, even so, there is
i much work to be done if Stanford
j is to be a serious factor in the Con
ference title fight.
LARSON VAULTS 13'
[ Bill Larson, protege of assistant
coach Cornelius Warmerdam, pole
vaulted 13 teet to score an easy
I victory in that event.
Messrs. Weiershauser and War
merdam were given a momentary
twinge during the last race on the
> program, an exhibition relay be
tween two Farm foursomes. George
Grimes, probably Stanford's best
; middle distance runner,
anchor for one relay team in the ex
hibition, pulled up lame rounding
the first turn. Luckily, however,
I Grimes had felt the pull beginning,
and had stopped before serious dam
age resulted.

afternoon's proceedings was the
j field work of Chuck Coker, recent
transfer from San Jose State. Coker

junior college squads of Salinas, Stockton, Modesto, and Sacra

Stanford's track team, making its first appearance of the sea
son, romped to a leisurely 104' -54 1 victory over the combined
junior college squads of Salinas, Stockton, Modesto, and Sacra
mento on the Angell Field ovel Saturday afternoon. The Indians
took blue-ribbon honors in 12 of the 15 events, and scored clean

* sweeps oi ine nrst three places in
I both the shotput and javelin.
Oik.' record fell by the wayside.
Husky Otis Chandler, bright frosh
prospect, sent out a shotput heave
ol 48 ft. 71 in., setting a new mark
I tor Stanford freshmen. He exceeded
j by almost five inches the previous
■ record of 48 ft. 2' in. made by Jim
Reynolds in 1934.
j On the whole, however, most of
tlie performances turned in by Coach
Jack Weiershauser's trackmen were
evidence that the Indians did not
operate at maximum strength in the
meet, and that, even so, there is
i much work to be done if Stanford
j is to be a serious factor in the Con
ference title fight.
LARSON VAULTS 13'
[ Bill Larson, protege of assistant
coach Cornelius Warmerdam, pole
vaulted 13 teet to score an easy
I victory in that event.
Messrs. Weiershauser and War
merdam were given a momentary
twinge during the last race on the
> program, an exhibition relay be
tween two Farm foursomes. George
Grimes, probably Stanford's best
; middle distance runner,
anchor for one relay team in the ex
hibition, pulled up lame rounding
the first turn. Luckily, however,
I Grimes had felt the pull beginning,
and had stopped before serious dam
age resulted.
i CHUCK COKER SHINES
A particularly bright spot in the
afternoon's proceedings was the
j field work of Chuck Coker, recent
transfer from San Jose State. Coker
won the discus with an effort of 138
ft. 7 in. and placed second in the
! javelin with 170 fa.
