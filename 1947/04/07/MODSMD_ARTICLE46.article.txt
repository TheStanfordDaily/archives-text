# Ernie Kellburg Loses in Golf
## 
### 
A red-hot putter named Morgan
Fottrell Jr. of San Jose State Col
lego gained a (J and 4 victory over
Stanford's Ernest Kellburg in the
finals of the first annual Northern
California Intercollegiate golf tour
nament held last Saturday at Santa
Cruz. Fottrell forged two up on
Kellburg as a result of the morn
ings' match play, and carded a 75
to the loser's 78.
In qualifying. Stanford captured
the Stuart Hawley Jr. Memorial
Trophy, symbolic of the team cham
pionship.
A 1 Masters, graduate manage!',
gave Stanford's golf hopefuls a defi
nite shot in the arm when he indi
cated that there was a good possi
bility of the school's financing the
team back to the National Collegi
ate tourney at Ann Arbor, Michi
gan, in June. Last year, members
of the squad picked $500 nut of their
own pockets each, to compete and
returned home with the National
title.
Masters, in elaborating further,
said: "Last year we were just re
suming our sports schedule. We
had no income and felt it was not
propitious to pay for any team's
national competition. However, this
is another year and we intend no
exception to our pre-war policy of
sending every deserving team to
national events. Of course I cannot
commit myself now. but if one team
continues to indicate it is worthy of
victories in our dual meets, I will
recommend the trip. As you know,
we sent our swimming team to the
nationals at Seattle and—on the
basis ol what the golfers have shown
to date—it is unlikely we will deny
the same privilege to them.
