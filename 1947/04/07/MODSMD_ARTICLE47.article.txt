# Card Rally Fails As Bears Win Opener
## 
### LYNN CARMAN 
in a hotly contested battle, Cali
fornia's Bears staved off a belated
last-01-the-ninth Stanford rally to
d<Â»wn a determined Indian baseball
squad, 3 to 2, in the Sunken Dia
mond here last Saturday afternoon.
Earlier, the invading junior var
sity squad walked off with a 4 to 0
victory over Stanford's Jayvees to
make it a clean sweep for Cal as j
the two schools opened their 1947
diamond rivalry.
STOTT BAFFLES BEARS
It took the Bears more than six j
innings to solve Pitcher Dave Stott's
curve balls, but when the California
batters finally got the range they I
teed off to drive in two runs in the !
seventh to take the lead which they ,
never lost but which they were hard
put to protect.
The Bears added another run inj
the ninth on an overthrow to second >
base to take what seemed to be a j
perfectly secure 3-0 lead as the tail j
end of the Cardinal batting order j
came up for their last turn at the |
plate.
But Pinchitter Clyde Dingfeldei J
lined out a single to center field to j
start the Stanford half of the ninth.
Then Don Pendergrass, hitting for
Cardinelli, came through with a long i
double to left center to put men on j
second and third, with none out, and j
the Cardinals had a new lease on life i
in the ball game..
FIRST INDIAN RUN
Coach Harry Wolter's third pinch j
hitter in a row, Frank McGraw, was i
thrown out at first on an infield play,
but he sent Dingfelder scooting
home with the first Indian run and i
sent Pendergrass to third base.
Nino Barnise, Cal's tiring hurler, i
pulled himself together to send I
Leadoff Man Bill Arce down on
strikes and Stanford's rally seemed !
almost nipped. But then George j
Sloat pounded out his second single j
in the ball game, sending the sec- !
ond Stanford run home and putting j
the tying run on first base.
Stanford's hopes for tying the j
ball game up went glimmering,
though, as Outfielder Cliff McClain
raced far to his right to pull down
Buck Brownson's liner to end the ;
rally, and the game.
It was this same McClain who. i
earlier in the seventh inning, broke !
the liitless spell which Stott had I
woven around the Bears and sent a j
350-foot triple into right field. Jimmy
Brown singled and McClain went J
home; Glenn Dufour doubled and !
the speedy Brown went all the way
home. That gave the Bears the J
two-run lead they needed.
In the first half of the ninth, j
Brown singled again and went to sec
ond on Jim Fiscalini's sacrifice. He i

went on to score Cal's third run
when Benny Cardinelli, Stanford
first baseman, sent a throw to sec
ond into the outfield and the relay
into home ialied to catch Brown.
Although being charged with the
loss, the official scorekeeper charged
only one earned run off of Stott. who
now has gone sixteen innings in
conference play with only one earned
run being scored against him.
NINE HITS ALLOYVEI)
Tlie Cardinal batters scattered
nine hits . throughout the nine
frames as compared to Cal's five safe
blows, but the Bear bingles were
concentrated in the final three inn
ings. The Bears left only five men
stranded on the bases, whereas the

Indians lelt ten men on base
factor which was of considerable im- j
portanee in the airtight game.
The Big Game victory sent Cali
fornia into first place in the Cali
fornia Intel-scholastic Baseball As- |
sociation with a two and nothing
mark.
On the other hand, Saturday's loss i
settled the Indians more securely
in their present fourth place position, !
which they do not seem destined to
hold for long. St. Mary's and Santa
Clara can both climb over the In- ;
dians in the standings by each
winning just one game, no matter if j
the Cardinals win their next game.
The varsity nine is scheduled to j
go against the Jayvees this after
noon in a tuneup match for their El ,
Toro Marine game on Wednesday. I
Coach Wolter expects to send a Hock j
of hurlers to the mound to get more j
of a line on some who have not seen I
a lot of action this spring.
