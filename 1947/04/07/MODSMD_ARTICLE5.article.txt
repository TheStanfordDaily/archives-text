# Coal Paralysis Faced by Nation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. April (5 (UP).â€”
Indefinite paralysis of the soft coal
fields faced the nation tonight as the
government and John L. Lewis en
gaged in another test of power.
At 8 p.m., EST, it appeared that
the six-day mourning period which
Lewis ordered for victims of the
Centralia, 111., mine disaster would
extend indefinitely into a '"safety
shutdown" which could cripple
nearly all industry if prolonged.
The mourning period was due to
expire at midnight tonight. But
Lewis served notice that his miners
will not enter any pits until they
are adjudged safe by federal mine
inspectors.
Federal Administrator,N. H.
Collisson, in turn, told the beetle
browed mine boss that if the work
stoppage continues, he must accept
sole responsibility. He called Lewis'
position arbitrary.
