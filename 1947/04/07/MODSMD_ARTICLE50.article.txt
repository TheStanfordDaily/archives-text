# Needed: 7,000 Activity Cards
## 
### 
Have you turned in your activities file cards
yet? These were the cards placed in the Ad
Building all last week for students to pick up
when they registered, fill out, and put into
boxes in front of the Building.
Tonight, those who have not turned in cards
will have a last chance to do so when the
cards are passed around to living groups.
The cards will be used in setting up a cross

file to place students in activities in relation
to their interests and gualifications. The file
will also contain information concerning ex
tracurricular activities for student reference.
The file has been needed a long time as
evidenced by the lack of participation in activi
ties except by "the few," but it will be of little
value unless it is complete.— N.B.
