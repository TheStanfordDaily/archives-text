Hollywood does it every time. Year after year
tins typical American institution has faithfully por
trayed another thoroughly American tradition—the
small home town. The movies show with simple hon
esty the average day-to-day life of the clean little
town we come from. Of course everyone on the Farm
comes from such a town.
My hometown didn't seem to fit this typical pat
tern till 1 really got to thinking.
My hometown shows careful civic planning, has
the ideal Hollywood hometown weather and of course
the ideal American family is the average in my
town.
Civic planning is obvious in the zoning of my
town. The streets are wide enough for four vehicles
to pass. Of course horses were the chief transporting
agent when the city fathers did the planning. But
how were they to guess the width of the family Cad
today?
The businesses and shops show thoughtful plan
ning. On one side of the main street the formula is:
bar, shoeshop, cigar store; cocktail lounge, movie,
loan company; bar, drug store, bank; cocktail lounge,
movie, drugstore; bar, etc. Opposite this picturesque
facade the block begins with the cigar store and
runs through the same formula. This 1 to 3 ratio is
slightly varied iti the zoning of the highways leading
into my town. There the bars are 3 to 3.
The climate certainly fills the Hollywood bill for
the typical town. Along wide, tree-lined streets,
summer sun warms afternoon shoppers with a pleas
ant 1)2 in the shade of movie marquee's. In fall
leaves clutter the gutters and drains. Then snow—

a heart-warming White-Christmassy mountain bliz
zard covers them, the sidewalks, fireplugs, fences,
mailboxes, and last the parked cars. Snowshoeing to
school was yreat fun even when I lost two toes that
way.
But spring in my town is the best of all. The
typical American town must be on a hill like my
town though you can still see the watermarks on
the houses.
The average family is in the true Hardy family
tradition. Dad's a solid citizen; Mom, a versatile
civic-minded clubwoman and mother; Sis, pretty,
home-loving, modest; and Son, athletic, jolly and a
bit of a tease.
Although Dad isn't always a lawyer or a doctor,
he frequently has dealings with the law and with
hospitals. He goes to church every Sunday before
turning in. Mom has her clubs—bridge, and a small
one for Son.
The girls in my town are the typical clean-haired
sweater-shirt-and-bobby-sock kind. The lion on
our high school lawn roars pretty often, but then,
we have lots of women teachers.
We have the usual number of gaily pointed ja
lopies parked near the school with clean-cut fellows
in jeans sitting in them at all hours, especially from
tl to 12 and 1 to 3 in the day and at other times. You
know the lean, awkward type, but not too awkward
tdrain is tanks quickly and put out street lamps
at a hundred yards.
Even the college kids in my town are true to the
Andy liardy tradition. They like college so well they
stay five or six years.

town. The streets are wide enough for four vehicles
to pass. Of course horses were the chief transporting
agent when the city fathers did the planning. But
how were they to guess the width of the family Cad
today?
The businesses and shops show thoughtful plan
ning. On one side of the main street the formula is:
bar, shoeshop, cigar store; cocktail lounge, movie,
loan company; bar, drug store, bank; cocktail lounge,
movie, drugstore; bar, etc. Opposite this picturesque
facade the block begins with the cigar store and
runs through the same formula. This 1 to 3 ratio is
slightly varied iti the zoning of the highways leading
into my town. There the bars are 3 to 3.
The climate certainly fills the Hollywood bill for
the typical town. Along wide, tree-lined streets,
summer sun warms afternoon shoppers with a pleas
ant 1)2 in the shade of movie marquee's. In fall
leaves clutter the gutters and drains. Then snow—

a heart-warming White-Christmassy mountain bliz
zard covers them, the sidewalks, fireplugs, fences,
mailboxes, and last the parked cars. Snowshoeing to
school was yreat fun even when I lost two toes that
way.
But spring in my town is the best of all. The
typical American town must be on a hill like my
town though you can still see the watermarks on
the houses.
The average family is in the true Hardy family
tradition. Dad's a solid citizen; Mom, a versatile
civic-minded clubwoman and mother; Sis, pretty,
home-loving, modest; and Son, athletic, jolly and a
bit of a tease.
Although Dad isn't always a lawyer or a doctor,
he frequently has dealings with the law and with
hospitals. He goes to church every Sunday before
turning in. Mom has her clubs—bridge, and a small
one for Son.
The girls in my town are the typical clean-haired
sweater-shirt-and-bobby-sock kind. The lion on
our high school lawn roars pretty often, but then,
we have lots of women teachers.
We have the usual number of gaily pointed ja
lopies parked near the school with clean-cut fellows
in jeans sitting in them at all hours, especially from
tl to 12 and 1 to 3 in the day and at other times. You
know the lean, awkward type, but not too awkward
tdrain is tanks quickly and put out street lamps
at a hundred yards.
Even the college kids in my town are true to the
Andy liardy tradition. They like college so well they
stay five or six years.
Is your hometown a real American small town?
Hollywood does it every time. Year after year
tins typical American institution has faithfully por
trayed another thoroughly American tradition—the
small home town. The movies show with simple hon
esty the average day-to-day life of the clean little
town we come from. Of course everyone on the Farm
comes from such a town.
My hometown didn't seem to fit this typical pat
tern till 1 really got to thinking.
My hometown shows careful civic planning, has
the ideal Hollywood hometown weather and of course
the ideal American family is the average in my
town.
Civic planning is obvious in the zoning of my
town. The streets are wide enough for four vehicles
