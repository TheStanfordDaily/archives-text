### DAN ENDSLEY 
For years every schoolboy has been told about the
Monroe Doctrine; perhaps in future days the young
sters will also have to study the Truman Doctrine.
The President's speech to Congress in which he
pleaded for aid to Greece and Turkey is already
known by that name. The new Tinman Doctrine
means that the U.S. government plans to fight the
Russian brand of Communism throughout the world,
in an effort to further the American belief in liberty
for the individual—whether it be individual persons
or individual states.
Immediately the question arises: Why did the
United States take; unilateral action rather than work
through the United Nations? Most of the commen
tators know the answer, but they hate to put it into
words. The answer is that the United Nations is too
weak and inefficient—the United Nations is power
less.
Warren Austin, U.S. delegate to the Security

Council, told his fellow members
that President Truman meant no
slight to the Security Council and
that the United Slates hopes to
tin n the whole problem over to the
U.N. at a later date. Political au
thorities have said that the U.N.
is not yet strong enough to handle
such weighty problems and that
the young organization must be
given a chance to gain strength
before it is saddled with such a

controversial matter. Words, nothing but words.
The United States is acting alone because the
U.N. is nothing but a debating society. The Security
Council has had nearly two years in which to put
itself on an operating basis; it has done little but
haggle over procedure. Any strong action is virtually
impossible because of the veto—which American
leaders want just as much as do the Russians.
But the veto is what will keep the United Nations

from ever becoming more powerful than the old
League of Nations. Probably history's prime exam
ple of a successful federation is the United States of
America. If the Constitution had provided for a Se
curity Council on which New York. Massachusetts,
and Virginia would have veto powers, the United
States would have failed too.
Under the Articles of Confederation each state
retained its own sovereignty. The individual states
could wage war, establish tariffs, and so forth. The
experiment was a miserable failure. It was not until
the states surrendered their sovereignty to a federal
government that this nation became a solvent con
cern.
The same will be true of any loose confederation;
it is bound to fail. Any successful world federation
will have to have a central government to which all
states will delegate their sovereign powers. But —
such a federation must have a constitution acceptable
to all members. It's hard to see how democratic and
totalitarian states can belong to the same federation.
That may be where we've made our mistake.
We're trying to go too far. too fast. President Wash
ington was inauguarated in 1789; it wasn't until 7(5
years later, after the North won the Civil War, that
the United States proved itself a sovereign nation.
Perhaps ii would be better if the peace-loving
democracies got together and. after drawing up a
constitution, surrendered their sovereignty to a cen
tral government. True, the jingoists in this country
(and in all other countries as well) would object
violently and cry "Treason!" Also, the world would
still be split into two camps. But all the like-thinking
nations would be welded together as never beiore;
their strength together would be much greater than
the sum of their individual strengths—and perhaps,
step by step, we might eventually achieve that "One
World" which is so necessary if mankind is to sur
vive.
