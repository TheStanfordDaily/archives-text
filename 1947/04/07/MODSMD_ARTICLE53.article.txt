To the Editor:
Steve Martin, in the column "History 1947" in
last Thursday's Daily, speaks of "Henry Wallace and
his group of appcasers."
1 wonder if Steve Martin has read any of Henry
Vv T nl|aces recent writings, or if he has been content
to base his opinions on the thunderinys of Wallace's
detractors? Tlie.se detractors arc particularly vocal
right now, and usually make up in loudness and
repetition what they lack in accuracy.
I have read several of Henry Wallace's editorials
which are now appearing weekly in the New Repub
lic. They contain well thought-out recommendations
for United States domestic and foreign policy hy a
man who has been giving earnest study to domestic
and foreign economic and political affairs for years.

The editorial "The Truman Doctrine —or a Strong
U.N.," appearing in the March 31 issue, treats of the
Greek-Turkish-Balkan question in a far more let s
get-down-to-facts manner than any of the other
current columns I have read on the same subject.
Wallace herein outlines not a merely palliative but
a genuinely constructive program whereby the
United States can. through the United Nations, help
Greece and the entire Balkan region to become eco
nomically stable.
Henry Wallace's editorials do not sound like the
work of a weak-kneed compromising "appetiser."
They are the work of a clear-thinking American who
is sensible enough to see that in genuine co-opera
tion between nations lies the world's hope.
