The American University is in for a change.
This is the essence of the meeting of President Truman's Commission
cm Higher Education from which Atvin C. Enrich, Stanford's Vice-Presi

Two basic questions cfre under examination by the commission. Both

vitally concern the future of the >

lord in particular, according to Dr. j
Enrich.
One concerns the physical dimen
ions and amount of extension of
the system of higher education to

"In the face of the increased and
increasing demand for college edu

take care of all qualified people—
.vhirh means more money and
financial stability—or they must
restrict the number even further
than they already have by a proc
i of more rigid selection."
As far as education itself is con
cerned, the commission is attacking
a far more fundamental question,
according to Eurich.
