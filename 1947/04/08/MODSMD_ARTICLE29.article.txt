# Quick Fire Crew Aid Halts Roble Blaze
## 
### 
Blazing flames roared in Roble
yesterday morning, as curtains
draped across a lamp ignited and
burned the floor, walls, ceiling,
and bedding of June Summers'
room. No one was injured.
The blast of the new fire whistle
routed the Stanford Fire Depart
ment out of bed and classes at !J:2l
a.m. The flames were brought
quickly finder control, and dam
age was limited to approximately
$75. Fire Chief John Marston all
ium need.
