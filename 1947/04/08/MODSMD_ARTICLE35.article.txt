# Shuffling the Cards with DON DAVIES
## 
### 
\Ve've got a lot of nasty words
ad a case of empty beer bottles to
larm at some of the judges at the
CAA swim meet in Seattle. When
ie Indians' top splasher, Bob Aii
erson, who won the 50-yard-free
iyle event in 194(5, finished sth in
'47 there was a lot of comment,
nme of the sports scribes were ask
>g "What happened to Anderson?"
young Bob wasn't the quiet, un
isuming guy that he is he cnuld've
leared up the situation.
It seems that the finish of the 50
t Seattle was practically a dead
eat between five swimmers, in
luding Anderson. There were four
udges assigned to spot the first
>ur finishers. The judge to tab the
/inner named one swimmer, the
id.ye to catch second place named
ie same swimmer, (this guy could
t finish both first and second) and
ie judge to pick third place named
ne of the swimmers caught by the*!
rst and second place judges. The
nirth place judges named a fourth
wiminen Confused? So were the i
udges.
When Anderson climbed out of
he pool the camera boys swarmed i
■found him convinced that he was
lie winner. The timer in Anderson's
ane showed the fastest tirne. It
ooked like Rapid Robert had done j
t again and then .... here's where '
ve start tossing those brown bottles.
The befuddled judges hashed their
leeisions over for a while and then
lamed Harry Weinberg of Michigan
is the winner, and relegated Ander- I
on to fifth place because he had not
jeen mentioned on their ballots,
■vhich were obviously wrong. We
vuz robbed!
It seemed to us that the NCAA
ould use one of those new, fool- ;
jroof electronic clocking and place- 1
ricking devices.

Down on Figueron street Coach
lefl Cruvath is plotting just how he
s going to put his Trojans back on

'oirig to come up with a winning
combination.

leorge Murphy. John Naumu, and
Ted Tannehill around to till the
backfield spots the Trojans are fat,
ljut the line was hard hit.
There are over 50 boys up from
iast year's undefeated frosh team.
There was a lot of talent on that
1 robabe team, and especially keep
in eye on Jimmy Powers. Powers,
who won prep laurels at Beverly
Hills, is a smooth ballhandler, an
uitstanding punter, a clever passer,
nd a signalcaller with lots of savvy.
Jim might just be able to snag a
tailing post on the Trojan's 1947
I'-machine.

Graduate Manager Al Masters has
(imounced that the green fees on
llu- Stanford Golf Course have been
raised. Everything is going up these
lays and this raise seems justified
is it is necessary to keep the Farm's
■ ourse in the top-notch playing
condition that it has always been in.
The rates for a student script book
have been raised from SlO to $15
per quarter. That averages about
t!i cents a round, which isn't bad
lor the best (and the toughest)
course on the Coast. (Well, maybe
Pebble Beach is a little harder.)
Eddie Twigg's NCAA champion
varsity golfers will get a break this
quarter. The team members will
rale the rightaway from 12:30 to 1
on Monday. Tuesday, and Thursday.

The Stanford Athletic Council has
slammed the door and locked it on
the crew's plea for some University
upport. The S.A.C. feels that Stan

that crew would be too much of a
