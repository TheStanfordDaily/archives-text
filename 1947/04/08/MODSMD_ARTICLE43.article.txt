## 
### 
Hopes by Stanford's crew members and supporters for more
backing on the part of the university took a body blow yesterday
when the Athletic Council voted not to recognize crew as an
official sport.
Not only did the council turn back efforts to have the activity

►recognized this year, but it also in
dicated tliilt crew had little chance
of gaining the ollicial support of the
University "for years to come."
Chief objection to accolading the
struggling aquatic sport, according
to the Athletic Council, was that
the heavy financial burden of buck
ing crew at Stanford would force
the reviseinent of the athletic pro
gram here.
COUNCIL ISSUES STATEMENT
The nine-man council, consisting
of three students, three faculty
members, and three alumni, issued
the following statement through its
chairman, Mr. Louis R. Vincenti:
"Stanford cannot now or for years
to come adopt crew as an official
sport. Tlie revival of intercollegiate
athletics at Stanford, begun only
last year, requires all the financial
and manpower resources available
to maintain our present program.
The addition of crew, an extreme
ly expensive sport, would force us
to curtail drastically our present in
tercollegiate and intramural pro
gram. This, in our opinion, is not
in the best interests of Stanford
University."
CREW KEEPS PLUGGING
But, official recognition or no,
Coach Lou Lindsay is still looking
for candidates for the squad, partic
ularly freshmen and sophomores
who can be developed for future
seasons.
Th'_> shell men are slated to go
up against Cal's mighty rowing ma
chine on May 3.
