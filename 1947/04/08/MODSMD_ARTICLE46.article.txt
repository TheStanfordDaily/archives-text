# Coast Loop Inaugural Big Success
## 
### 
The annual shake-down cruise of
the S.S. Pacific Coast League is over
and from all early indications it
was a huge success.
"It looks as though we are in for
a great year," says Charley Gra
ham, president of the San Francisco
Seals and the Mr. Baseball of the
West. "We don't have a third major
league yet, but we are offering
very fine entertainment —and it ap
pears the fans will love it."
STACK UP WELL
Mr. Graham, as usual, is being
conservative. Things stack up after
the first week of play this way:
1. The league drew 145,000 paid
admissions, despite threatening
weather through the week-days.
2. Indications are that the teams
are very evenly matched, giving rise
to the speculation that there might
be a ding-dong eight-team race for
the pennant.
3. The caliber of play is the best
since the good ol' pre-war days.
4. While the pitching is classier
in spots than in many recent sea
sons, there are more long-ball hit
ters to supply that home-run punch
that the fans love.
PADRES CLOUT HALL
The first - week sensation, of
course, are Manager Rip Collins'
San Diego .Padres. The bordertown
fans, used to second division clubs,
love the new home-run hitting Pa
dres, as witness their first week's
attendance of 34.012 and a rcord
shattering 10.500 for Sunday's twin
bill against Oakland.
Just how good the Padres really
are may be tested in games that
start tonight when they get a crack
at a surprisingly good Portland
Beaver team that battled Los An
geles to a 1-3 stand-off in the first
week of play.
In other series, Iho second-place
San Francisco Seals, winner over
Seattle by a 5-2 count, take on the
Hollywood Stars, who dropped a
4-3 decision to Sacramento; the So
lons engage Seattle and Los Ange
les plays host to Oakland.
MAY ACHIEVE GOAL
Of course, attendance in the cir
cuit always is big when all teams
still have a chance—such as during
the opening week of play. However,
if the 145.000 per week average
should hold up. the P.C.L. would
come close to its announced goal of
5.000.000 for a season.
Los Angeles, which drew 35,000
for the .opening week, always does
better when it starts playing night
games later in the season. San Fran
cisco attracted 41,000 paid admis
sions. but expects to average better
than GO,OOO during the season.
