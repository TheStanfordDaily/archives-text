# BULL SESSION

### DAN ENDSLEY 
Law and order, most people agree, are necessary
things. That's why we have a Men's Council here
at Stanford. However, sometimes the powers that
bo gel so wrapped up in law and order that justice
isn't done. Evn the finest and most efficient of
bodies as Men's Council is—can make a mistake.
That is the subject of today's little sermon.
It seems that, not long ago, three young gentle
men were creating quite a disturbance outside the
Western Civ Library. My legal roommate would
probably call it maintaining a public nuisance. I
might add that the young gentlemen aforementioned
were, like an old door that does not squeak, well
oiled.
The Commanding Officer of the Western Civ Li-

brary is Miss Theressa Gay. Quite
understandably. she did not like
ail the noise outside her window;
there are a few freshmen who fre
quent her territory with the in
tention of studying—and il is much
easier to study when quiet reigns.
Miss Gay suppressed her an
noyance, but the noise kept get
ting noisier all the time. Finally
the public disturbance came to a
peak and became a full - blown
public scandal. She acted.

Pencil and paper in hand, she went outside and
collared the culprits. After taking down the three
names she turned them over to Men's Council.

Up to this point in the story, you will note, law,
order, and justice have been synonymous. But from
the time Men's Council took over, justice miscarried.
The gentlemen who preside over Stanford's pub
lie morals went into action, and almost immediately
they made a disconcerting discovery—the culprits
had given Miss Gay names all right, but they were
the wrong names.
Two of the names were not in the Eawlout at
all. The third was simply J. Jackson. Men's Council
found several Jacksons in the Bawlout, including
two which began with J. Finally they decided on
J. Hugh Jackson, Jr., as their culprit and sent him
a summons.
Aside from the fact that the boy was probably
innocent, they were doing all right but they made
a little mistake. In addressing the summons they left
off the "Jr." and it went to "Sr.''
Now it happens that J. Hugh Jackson, Sr., is Dean
of the Grad School of Business. It also happens that
he is not a drinking man. It must have been quite
a shock to him when he received a summons to ap
pear before an undergraduate body on a drunk and
disorderly charge.
Dean Jackson is a God-fearing man, but he hasn't
too much reason to fear Men's Council. He wrote
the boys a very nice letter, politely but firmly de
clining their invitation to appear.
I daresay there were some red faces on Men's
Council.

innocent, they were doing all right but they made
a little mistake. In addressing the summons they left
off the "Jr." and it went to "Sr.''
Now it happens that J. Hugh Jackson, Sr., is Dean
of the Grad School of Business. It also happens that
he is not a drinking man. It must have been quite
a shock to him when he received a summons to ap
pear before an undergraduate body on a drunk and
disorderly charge.
Dean Jackson is a God-fearing man, but he hasn't
too much reason to fear Men's Council. He wrote
the boys a very nice letter, politely but firmly de
clining their invitation to appear.
I daresay there were some red faces on Men's
Council.

Law and order, most people agree, are necessary
things. That's why we have a Men's Council here
at Stanford. However, sometimes the powers that
bo gel so wrapped up in law and order that justice
isn't done. Evn the finest and most efficient of
bodies as Men's Council is—can make a mistake.
That is the subject of today's little sermon.
It seems that, not long ago, three young gentle
men were creating quite a disturbance outside the
Western Civ Library. My legal roommate would
probably call it maintaining a public nuisance. I
might add that the young gentlemen aforementioned
were, like an old door that does not squeak, well
oiled.
The Commanding Officer of the Western Civ Li-

brary is Miss Theressa Gay. Quite
understandably. she did not like
ail the noise outside her window;
there are a few freshmen who fre
quent her territory with the in
tention of studying—and il is much
easier to study when quiet reigns.
Miss Gay suppressed her an
noyance, but the noise kept get
ting noisier all the time. Finally
the public disturbance came to a
peak and became a full - blown
public scandal. She acted.

Pencil and paper in hand, she went outside and
collared the culprits. After taking down the three
names she turned them over to Men's Council.

Up to this point in the story, you will note, law,
order, and justice have been synonymous. But from
the time Men's Council took over, justice miscarried.
The gentlemen who preside over Stanford's pub
lie morals went into action, and almost immediately
they made a disconcerting discovery—the culprits
had given Miss Gay names all right, but they were
the wrong names.
Two of the names were not in the Eawlout at
all. The third was simply J. Jackson. Men's Council
found several Jacksons in the Bawlout, including
two which began with J. Finally they decided on
J. Hugh Jackson, Jr., as their culprit and sent him
a summons.
Aside from the fact that the boy was probably
innocent, they were doing all right but they made
a little mistake. In addressing the summons they left
off the "Jr." and it went to "Sr.''
