In Washington these days, they are busy working
out the details of what has been denominated the
"Truman Doctrine." It is, roughly, a policy of sup
porting free governments against threatened aggres
sion with American money, advice, and arms. As you
all should know, the first recipients of our bounty
are to be Greece ;uid Turkey. This leaves the pre
cise definition of "free governments" somewhat in
doubt. Certainly the Peron government in Argen
tina is us free o government as these, and even El Cau
dillo, generalissimo of Spain, might be within the
fold. That is the first objection.
A second'objection comes from the supporters of
U.N. and world government advocates in general.
This "Truman Doctrine" is a policy of the United
States alone, and is to be put in execution by the
United States alone. The support of free govern
ments (without regard to the particular definition)
everywhere is, I believe, a particular function of
the United Nations. Unilateral execution of this
function by the United States alone amounts either
to a deliberate snub to the United Nations if it can
discharge this function, or official recognition by the
United States that the United Nations is unable to
do its assigned work. To this objection, answers have
been made. One i.s that so long as the worthy pur
poses of the U.N. are accomplished, the immediate
means of their execution is unimportant. Another i.s
that Secretary-General Lie or any member of the
United Nations can hail the United States before
the Security Council whenever they think that our
activities amount to a threat to peace. And Congress
itself has supplied a third answer, that the Security
Council, by a bare majority, not subject to our veto,
can terminate the program at any time.
In any case, both these objections are valid only
if it is first presumed that there is no serious threat
of aggression in the world. If the troubles in the
world were only differences of opinion, only dis
agreements over the facts of the ease, only minor
misunderstandings, certainly the U.N. could and
should handle the matter. If. on the other hand.

there is any nation or any group of nations coolly
ami purposefully implementing a plan of aggression
aimed at the whole world, they can be halted only
by the counter-policy of a nation or nations equal
in military strength and equal in determination. And
if .we conclude from the facts of the situation that
there are aggressor or would-be aggressor nations
on the loose, the precise definition of "free" becomes
unimportant. We should be prepared to support any
government that will oppose the aggressor (and. let
me add, that will not itself turn into a menace to our
peace and security).
This is a pragmatic, uninspired policy. It is not
founded in any theories of the brotherhood of man.
It anticipates international difficulties, oven war.
And. expecting trouble, it appears that we are try
ing to take the stitch in time. How often are we told
that Hitler could have been stopped at the time of
the Rhineland or Austrian incidents, if someone had
taken a firm stand? The Truman Doctrine means
immediately that we are preparing to nip aggres
sion in the bud.
Now it appears today that either you see Russia
as at least a potential aggressor or you see Russia
as the potential victim of the aggression of everyone
else. The heads of our government, on information
available to them, have cast Russia for the role of
the aggressor. Certainly, I cannot see that we are
moved by an aggressive spirit. Bluntly the Truman
Doctrine is only an expanded isolationism, an at
tempt to keep trouble at arm's length. It is isola
tionism in the same way that the Panama declaration
that war must be kept out of the Western Hemi
sphere, that the Monroe Doctrine, that Washington's
advice to keep out of foreign entanglements were all
isolationism. It is a negative policy, founded I would
say in the basic American desire to be let alone, to be
free to go on our way. We do not want war with
Russia or anyone el Sc. We do not seek to impose
anything on Russia; we seek only to make it more
convenient for her that she stay on her own side of
the street.

say in the basic American desire to be let alone, to be
free to go on our way. We do not want war with
Russia or anyone el Sc. We do not seek to impose
anything on Russia; we seek only to make it more
convenient for her that she stay on her own side of
the street.
In Washington these days, they are busy working
out the details of what has been denominated the
"Truman Doctrine." It is, roughly, a policy of sup
porting free governments against threatened aggres
sion with American money, advice, and arms. As you
all should know, the first recipients of our bounty
are to be Greece ;uid Turkey. This leaves the pre
cise definition of "free governments" somewhat in
doubt. Certainly the Peron government in Argen
tina is us free o government as these, and even El Cau
dillo, generalissimo of Spain, might be within the
fold. That is the first objection.
A second'objection comes from the supporters of
U.N. and world government advocates in general.
This "Truman Doctrine" is a policy of the United
States alone, and is to be put in execution by the
United States alone. The support of free govern
ments (without regard to the particular definition)
everywhere is, I believe, a particular function of
the United Nations. Unilateral execution of this
function by the United States alone amounts either
to a deliberate snub to the United Nations if it can
discharge this function, or official recognition by the
United States that the United Nations is unable to
do its assigned work. To this objection, answers have
been made. One i.s that so long as the worthy pur
poses of the U.N. are accomplished, the immediate
means of their execution is unimportant. Another i.s
that Secretary-General Lie or any member of the
United Nations can hail the United States before
the Security Council whenever they think that our
activities amount to a threat to peace. And Congress
itself has supplied a third answer, that the Security
Council, by a bare majority, not subject to our veto,
can terminate the program at any time.
In any case, both these objections are valid only
if it is first presumed that there is no serious threat
of aggression in the world. If the troubles in the
world were only differences of opinion, only dis
agreements over the facts of the ease, only minor
misunderstandings, certainly the U.N. could and
should handle the matter. If. on the other hand.

there is any nation or any group of nations coolly
ami purposefully implementing a plan of aggression
aimed at the whole world, they can be halted only
by the counter-policy of a nation or nations equal
in military strength and equal in determination. And
if .we conclude from the facts of the situation that
there are aggressor or would-be aggressor nations
on the loose, the precise definition of "free" becomes
unimportant. We should be prepared to support any
government that will oppose the aggressor (and. let
me add, that will not itself turn into a menace to our
peace and security).
This is a pragmatic, uninspired policy. It is not
founded in any theories of the brotherhood of man.
It anticipates international difficulties, oven war.
And. expecting trouble, it appears that we are try
ing to take the stitch in time. How often are we told
that Hitler could have been stopped at the time of
the Rhineland or Austrian incidents, if someone had
taken a firm stand? The Truman Doctrine means
immediately that we are preparing to nip aggres
sion in the bud.
Now it appears today that either you see Russia
as at least a potential aggressor or you see Russia
as the potential victim of the aggression of everyone
else. The heads of our government, on information
available to them, have cast Russia for the role of
the aggressor. Certainly, I cannot see that we are
moved by an aggressive spirit. Bluntly the Truman
Doctrine is only an expanded isolationism, an at
tempt to keep trouble at arm's length. It is isola
tionism in the same way that the Panama declaration
that war must be kept out of the Western Hemi
sphere, that the Monroe Doctrine, that Washington's
advice to keep out of foreign entanglements were all
isolationism. It is a negative policy, founded I would
say in the basic American desire to be let alone, to be
free to go on our way. We do not want war with
Russia or anyone el Sc. We do not seek to impose
anything on Russia; we seek only to make it more
convenient for her that she stay on her own side of
