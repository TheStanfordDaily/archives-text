To the Editor:
It seems hard to believe that a column such as
History 1947 which appeared in the Daily. April
is any more than a barb to arouse comment. I doubt
very much il .salaries are big enough in the Daily
Shack to allow the purchase of many writers' souls,
hence it is presumed Martin was writing with some
fort brightness and integrity. If the presumption is
correct, then I think the article hardly meets the
standards one might expect in a college publication.
I am not interested in either extolling the merits
of nor attacking the possible liabilities of the "Wal
lace Brand of Internationalism," What is objection
able is someone reasoning along these lines: "Results
. . . have been bad. . . . the Soviet Union has little
desire to co-operate. . . . That is . . . proof that Henry
Wallace and bis group of appeasers are completely
wrong. Frankly, I had trouble following the proof,
even in its entirety. In essence, it seems to say, ' We
have not followed Wallace's ideas, but nevertheless,
Wallace is wrong because results have been bad."
It is pretty obvious Wallace has a peculiar posi-

tion in America â€”might it be termed the "whipping
boy" of the opposition? I've heard him labeled
"pseudo-socialist" (Endsley, 1 think) and it is above
intimated he is an appeaser. Needless to say, in pri
vate conversation or through the American press,
I've heard him labeled everything from Fascist to
Communist. It should indicate by this wide range
of opinion between the two extremes of name calling
that a lot of people who write (or prove as Martin
purports to do) about Wallace don't know what
they're talking about, so they blithely throw on an
other label and the issue is settled.
Th"re are several other questionable statements of
fact and lines of reasoning which I will forego for
the coup de grace, "That's why wi should be thank
ful that George C. Marshall is Secretary of State,
rather than Henry Wallace." The relevancy of this
statement even in conjunction with the rest of the
article seems obscure, to say the least. The whole
article seems to smack of a brand of journalism that
had its inception in the City.
