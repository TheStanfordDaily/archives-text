"Greek is no longer cumpulsory
study at Oxford." said David Nichol
Smith in his lecture, "Oxford During
and After the War," last night at
the Tuesday Evening Series. He
added, however that, some Latin is
-.till required.
Stressing the importance of the
oast in Oxford's future, the former
Meiton professor of English litera
ture at the University maintained
that was "moving in the
light direction so lone as it is not
untrue to its past. However," he
■aid. "this does not mean that it is
not fully awake to the present."
PENICILLIN DISCOVERY
Dr. Smith brought out the im
portance of Oxford's contributions
i- it war research, especially t.he dis
I'overv of penicilljn. The study of
medicine and physical sciences is in
creasing at the university, but not
at the expense. Dr. Smith hoped, of
the humanities.
The problem:, of American uuiver
si ties are also facing Oxford, prob
lems of large enrollment, housing,
and a rapidly growing college town.
The town of Oxford has become
choked with war refugees from l/m
-don who are now reluctant to leave.
NO BOMBS FKLI.
During the war no bf»tnbs fell on
Oxford, Dr. Smith said. We kept
going even though our numbers were
very depleted I sometimes had
classes of only "ne or two students.'
However the number of Indents in
sciences increased.
Dr. Smith clarified the system of
colleges at Oxford, He said that
they were self-governing bodies
which select their own students, arid
provide tutors. Together the col
leges form the university, which
grants degrees and gives examina
tions.
The student. Dr. Smith said, must
lirst be accepted by a college before
lie can matriculate at Oxford.
