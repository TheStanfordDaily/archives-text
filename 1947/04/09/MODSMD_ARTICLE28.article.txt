# Guayule, Rubber Source, Farm Research Problem
## 
### RICHARD DICE 
The Mexican guayule phrub, the plant that may one day be
come America's domestic source of natural rubber, is being
grown here at Stanford, according to Dr. Reed C. Rollins, head of
the genetical division of Stanford's rubber research project.
The guayule shrub is being grown at the Stanford Experi-

mental Gardens, and the shrubs
lor research use only, said Dr. Rol
lins. The plants that are at Stan
lord were originally brought here by I
Dr. Rollins in the spring of 1945.
WORK MI) AT SAUNAS
During the war, Dr. Rollins worked
on the guayule research project at
Salinas that was under the direction
of the Department of Agriculture.
When the Department abandoned
the project, Dr. Rollins wished to
continue research on the shrub, and
he brought the shrub stocks with
him to Stanford.
Besides the original guayule shrubs
that are now growing on plots of
;round at the Experimental Gar
dens, there are some 7,000 seedlings
; rowing in the greenhouse. The re
search staff is doing genetical re
;-torch on the seedlings as well as on
the mature shrubs.
The guayule project is concerned (
with increasing the percentage of
i uhber that the shrub will produce,
and with increasing the hardiness of
the shrub so that it will have a
; renter area of cultivation.
NAVAL RESERVE GRANT
The research project is being car
i ied on under a $150,000 grant from
the OH ice of Naval Research. The
i hi ire natural rubber research pro
ject here at Stanford is under the
Stanford Research Institute.
Ur. Collins indicated tne vital role
that natural rubber from guayule
might play in case our foreign
.sources of rubber should be cut off
as they were at the first of the war.
"Of course none of wish for war,"
fiaid Dr. Rollins, "but we should be
ready for any eventuality." He also
pointed out that it would be impor
tant to have basic research done on
guuyule in case of another war.
Dr. Rollins also indicated that the
I.a: ie genetical research on the shrub
will take a long time. "We can get
only two generations of guayule a
year," said Dr. Rollins, "therefore,
genetical research on the shrub is a
long time proposition."

Besides the original guayule shrubs
that are now growing on plots of
;round at the Experimental Gar
dens, there are some 7,000 seedlings
; rowing in the greenhouse. The re
search staff is doing genetical re
;-torch on the seedlings as well as on
the mature shrubs.
The guayule project is concerned (
with increasing the percentage of
i uhber that the shrub will produce,
and with increasing the hardiness of
the shrub so that it will have a
; renter area of cultivation.
NAVAL RESERVE GRANT
The research project is being car
i ied on under a $150,000 grant from
the OH ice of Naval Research. The
i hi ire natural rubber research pro
ject here at Stanford is under the
Stanford Research Institute.
Ur. Collins indicated tne vital role
that natural rubber from guayule
might play in case our foreign
.sources of rubber should be cut off
as they were at the first of the war.
"Of course none of wish for war,"
fiaid Dr. Rollins, "but we should be
ready for any eventuality." He also
pointed out that it would be impor
tant to have basic research done on
guuyule in case of another war.
Dr. Rollins also indicated that the
I.a: ie genetical research on the shrub
will take a long time. "We can get
only two generations of guayule a
year," said Dr. Rollins, "therefore,
genetical research on the shrub is a
long time proposition."

The Mexican guayule phrub, the plant that may one day be
come America's domestic source of natural rubber, is being
grown here at Stanford, according to Dr. Reed C. Rollins, head of
the genetical division of Stanford's rubber research project.
The guayule shrub is being grown at the Stanford Experi-

mental Gardens, and the shrubs
lor research use only, said Dr. Rol
lins. The plants that are at Stan
lord were originally brought here by I
Dr. Rollins in the spring of 1945.

During the war, Dr. Rollins worked
on the guayule research project at
Salinas that was under the direction
of the Department of Agriculture.
When the Department abandoned
the project, Dr. Rollins wished to
continue research on the shrub, and
he brought the shrub stocks with
him to Stanford.
