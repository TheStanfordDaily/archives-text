# Bronco Netmen Invade Cardinal Courts Today
## 
### 
Intercollegiate tennis returns to the Farm this afternoon as the Indian
net squad acts as host to a Santa Clara Bronco invasion. The first match
will begin at 1:30 p.m. on the local courts.
Stanford's coach, Elwyn Bugge, sends the once-beaten Stanford squad
into the match with a strong chance for victory. Santa Clara has yet to

distinguish itself in Bay Area rac- i
quet circles, while the Indians were
impressive despite their defeat in
Saturday's Stockton battle.
iic;i;ks win tiuht match
Although College of Pacific walked
off with a f>-'> win over the Indians, j
the vaunted Tiger team was forced
to extend its court talents until the '
last match. Power in the first three I
singles positions spelled a Pacific
victory, with the Indians annexing
points in the lower seedings.
Today's match should decide j
whether the local net entry merely
ran up against a tennis juggernaut

The tentatively scheduled Var
sil> swimming meet with the Col
lege of the Pacific Saturday has
been cancelled, according to Don
Lcibcndorfcr, S.A.C. publicist. No
substitute meet has been arranged.

hist Saturday, or if Stanford court j
fans are doomed to a disappointing !
season. The Bronco meeting will j
serve as a test case as indication of <
how Stanford will fare in the Pacific j
Coast Conference.
MYKKS SEEDED FIRST
Ted Myers leads the locals into j
today's fray at the first singles posi- j
tion. Misfortune has dogged the top !
seeded Stanford man as he has been >
pitted against some of the headline j
netmen of the Pacific Coast. Larsen j
of C.O.P. was fresh from his Berke- j
ley Intercollegiate singles champion
ship when he dropped Myers in
straight sets, 6-1, 6-1.
Meanwhile, the remainder of the
Indian tennis chores will be assigned
to the same team that battled Col- i
lege of Pacific on even terms.
Bob Lewis, second seeded Indian,

walked straight off the basketball
court at the end of the season and
into varsity seeding on the tennis
.squad. The elongated hoop utility
man, whose brilliant performance
highlighted the final U.C.L.A. game,
has been equally effective on the ten
nis courts.
The Broncos may believe that
they are troubled with double vis
ion in the second doubles match,
but the dynamic play of Bob and
Fred Lewis will soon dispel the il
lusion. In their last outing against
C.0.P., the Lewis twins romped to
an easy victory and will be favored
to duplicate their win this after
noon.
RUTLEDGE DROPS THRILLER
Third slot on the Indian varsity
falls to Bob Rutledge who nearly
upset Hank Pfister, former champion
junior netster from San Francisco.
The terrific three-set battle easily
took top billing for thrills at Stock
ton last Saturday.
The remaining positions on the
Farm team will be filled by Kirke
Mechem, Ross Hughes, and Drew-
Putty. In doubles competition, Dave
Basham pairs off with Bob Rutledge
in the number one place. Lucien
Barbour and Drew Putty polish off
the afternoon in the final doubles
match.
DONS INVADE SATURDAY
U.S.F.'s powerful tennis team
furnishes the Indians with compe
tition Saturday afternoon as they
visit the Farm in a "natural" at
traction for local fans. The Dons are
the darlings of San Francisco sports
reporters who have visions of a
Coast title for U.S.F.
