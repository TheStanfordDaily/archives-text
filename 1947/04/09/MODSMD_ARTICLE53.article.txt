## 
### 
I
The second session of spring foot- I
i hull practice saw approximately 150
of Coach Marchie Schwartz's grid
hopefuls on the practice field yes
terday. Missing from the white uni
formed ranks were some of the best
Indian players—Lloyd Merriman,
Wayne Erickson. Bob Anderson,
Buck Brownson —all busy in other
sports.
The usual short period of calis
thenics was followed by hard drill ;
in tackling and blocking by the line
: men both in pairs and individually
; with • the tackling dummies. The
1 backs, under coaches Hammett,
Kmetovic and head coach Marchie j
Schwartz, came in for their share oi
similar drill plus some open-field
running.
Group workouts were continued
' under assistant coach Elwood, with 1
coaches Taylor. Bengston and Scrib- i
ner handling the line. Particular
attention was given to blocking of |

the regular, body, and man-to-man
types.
A half hour of punting drill ended
the session of hard off-season prac
tice. Plenty of enthusiasm is in
evidence on the practice gridiron
these days as the competition for
berths on the regular team gets,
under way.
One casualty, other than the usual
cuts and bruises, was reported from
Monday's blocking drill. Richard
Owen, line aspirant, suffered a
broken shoulder and will be out of
the picture in spring practice.
