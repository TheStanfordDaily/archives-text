# Red Track Captain Chosen
## 
### 
Al Snyder, senior transfer from
Dartmouth, was elected captain of!
| Stanford's track team Monday niuht.
He succeeds Martin Anderson. An
| lerson is recuperating from a recent
I iperation, which will keep him on ■
the sidelines for most, or perhaps 1
I ill, of the season.
j Snyder, spending his first year in ii
]i Cardinal uniform, has established
himselt as the team's top-seeded
j hurdler. In practice he has been
! clocked at 14 !) in the 120-yd. high
i hurdles, just two-tenths of a second
j slower than his second place time
j in the IC4A tournament last year.
The new captain's specialty i.s
, the 220-yd. low hurdles. He won
■ that' event for Dartmouth in the
! IC4A last year with 24.2, around a
, turn. His best time in the lows here
[at Stanford is 24.7, recorded just
i before spring vacation.

! Snyder's first opportunity to lead
! the Indians into action rolls around
Saturday, when Stanford plays host
I to San Jose State on Angell Field,
j San Jose will provide the first
I serious competition of 15)47 for Coach
Jack Weiershauser's trackmen. The
1 Spartans have embarked on a pro
| gram intended to build up their
j track and field prestige during re
cent years.
j Thanks to this increased emphasis,
i San Jose defeated Stanford in a

three-way meet in 1!I4(5, 79 5 (! to
s(i 1 (i, with Alameda Air Station,
the other entry, finishing last.

The Indians' hopes fur revenge this
season depend a lot on whether or
not ace middle-distance man George
Grimes will he able to run. Grimes
pulled a leg muscle in last Satur
day's meet.
Grimes has been working out care
fully this week and has not yet
opened up to thoroughly test the
leg. If, when he does try a full
speed test, the leg gives him no
trouble, Stanford will be able to
offer a real argument against the
Spartans.

A battle royal is shaping up be
tween shotputters Otis Chandler of
Stnlord and San Jose's Woody
Linn, for these two weight hurlers
are about as evenly matched as two
shotputters can be. Both heaved
the 16-pound spheroid 48 feet, 7 anil
a quarter inches in different meets,
last Saturday.

The Spartan attack features speedy
Billy Khyne, whose talents include
those of sprinting, broadjuniping
and hurdling, and whose efforts this
Saturday should give Stanford's
thinclads lots of competition in his
three events. However, Rhynf
burst a blood vessel in last week
rtieet, and it i.s not absolutely cer

the Saturday hostilities.

The Indians' hopes fur revenge this
season depend a lot on whether or
not ace middle-distance man George
Grimes will he able to run. Grimes
pulled a leg muscle in last Satur
day's meet.
Grimes has been working out care
fully this week and has not yet
opened up to thoroughly test the
leg. If, when he does try a full
speed test, the leg gives him no
trouble, Stanford will be able to
offer a real argument against the
Spartans.

A battle royal is shaping up be
tween shotputters Otis Chandler of
Stnlord and San Jose's Woody
Linn, for these two weight hurlers
are about as evenly matched as two
shotputters can be. Both heaved
the 16-pound spheroid 48 feet, 7 anil
a quarter inches in different meets,
last Saturday.

The Spartan attack features speedy
Billy Khyne, whose talents include
those of sprinting, broadjuniping
and hurdling, and whose efforts this
Saturday should give Stanford's
thinclads lots of competition in his
three events. However, Rhynf
