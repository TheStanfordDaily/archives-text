## Reasons for That One Bottle 
### 
Hesults of the Encina Commons milk poll
held last quarter showed that the number of
students willing to pay for an extra bottle of
milk at meals was not great enough to war
rant the University to make an extra board
charge for all students so that those who
wished could have an extra bottle.
The average number of bottles sold at break
fast was approximately 24, at lunch and din
ner, from 200 to 225, out of a total of approxi
mately 800 students who eat at the Commons,
according to Business Manager Alf E. Bran
din.
Because of high price of milk, it is impossi
ble to allow extra bottles under the existing
board rate. The University is hoping, of
course, and expecting the price of milk to go
down fairly soon so that no restrictions will
have to be put on milk.
Since the students are getting all the milk
actually required each day (according to medi

cal experts 1 pint is required and we are get
ting 1 1 pints plus milk used in other foods)
we feel that the step taken is the right one
and that adequate investigation was made
before this policy was adopted. â€”N.B.

Ollar Walkouts Drop!
A definite decline in the number of Cellar
walkouts indicates a healthy cooperation by
students in holding the losses to a minimum.
Reports show walkout losses as:
April 1, 53.45; April 2, 52.06; April 3, $1.53;
April 4, $.93; and April 5, 5.06! Losses for
days since the last date have not yet been
released.
Such a decline in losses shows that a little
effort on the part of each student can suc
cessfully maintain the system under which
the Cellar operates.
