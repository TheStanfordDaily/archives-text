It's amazing how quickly the young tilings that
come to Stanford gain m weight, color and general
good health during their years here. Some people
attribute this change to the climate, some say it's the
healthful hours we keep. But we know that it's really
the food that does it.
The rest homes, the drive-ins, and the highway
restaurants nightly are filled with coeds who know
what they're missing, but just couldn't make it to
dinner.
The dieticians balance our meals with almost
mathematical symmetry. Chili beans for lunch bal
ance Lima beans for dinner. A nice starch in the
potatoes balances a nice starch in the pie for dessert
with dinner. And the soup'on Monday balances that

on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, not
only in consistency but in flavor and taste. Our cooks
are real artists. Their favorite creations seem to
be "Variations on a Theme by the Chef of San
Qucntin."
We don t even have to ask tor seconds on milk,
salad or the main dish. We know we won't get them.
But we were especially lucky last week. On Good
Friday* meat was on the menu with creamed fish.
Cauliflower with white worm and cabbage salad with
boiled fly was served at our table. We were so sur
prised that after that we couldn't eat another tiling.
Incidentally, a friend of ours asked for "borsch"
in a local restaurant a week ago and has been sub
poenaed by the Tenney Committee.
