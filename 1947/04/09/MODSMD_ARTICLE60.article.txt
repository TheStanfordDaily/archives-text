### CECIL ROSPAW 
Traditionally the British have supported "the
strong" and not "a democratic" government in the
countries of the Near East This is the policy that
had her supporting the Moslem Government of the
Turkish Sultan against the uprising of the Greek
peoples 120 years ago. The same Greek people we are
rushing to defend today.
Churchill, undoubtedly a fine war leader, but
undoubtedly a rank conservative, witness the Fulton
speech, was in complete control of British policy
under war-time conditions when Greece was "given
democracy" in 1944.
During time of crisis few people who sincerely
hate and want to fight an oppressor bother t,o check,
or care about, party affiliations. Communists may
not be a lot of things, but they are willing to work,
they are able, and they did hate Fascists, which gave
a coinmonbond with all other haters of Facismj
Because of their long experience before the war
there is little doubt that many of the top leaders of
the strong resistance groups in Greece in 1944 were
Communists. But' there were some 60,000 men in the
ELAS, which was the fighting force of the EAM, the
political group which supported the guerillas. It has
been admitted by almost every faction in Greece that
the EI.AS was the most effective fighting force under
the Nazi occupation.
There is no way of checking but it stands to rea
son that not all of those 00,000 were Communists. In
fact active Communists were probobly a very small
minority of the number.
The British were faced with a decision. If they
recognized the ELAS as a whole they would be recog
nizing the Communist minority in their midst. This
could develop into a situation similar to the one
which we now see before us in France. There Dem
ocracy is in balance, but there is no civil war.
Churchill backed a Royalist government. The
ELAS turned its guns from the retreating Germans

onto the advancing British. Greece has been in a
state of Economic and Civil anarchy ever since.
We are now talking of supporting the govern
ment set up by British, sending in troops to support
the policies already established, and in essence con
tinuing the Civil War.
The situation in Greece is rapidly approaching
that state of political vacuum which made Spain so
hard for a person of the "middle group" when it was
in the throes of a Civil War. A .person interested in
preserving "democratic institutions" there had his
choice of backing a government dominated and backed
by Fascists and tolerated for expediency by many of
the democracies of the world, or backing an Army
composed of Communists and Anarchists who were
getting a lot of active support from people who hon
estly hated Fascism.
There is an old Greek proverb which fits here:
"It's the tailor's fault, and they beat the cook." When
we consider Greece why not consider the people,
probably a large majority, who are not Communists,
but who will not support a Royalist government and
will fight us if we do support a Royalist government.
Should we fight the middle group of Greece for
something that is not their fault, but rather the fault
of a small militant group of Communists?
Greece could be the beginning of a strong U.N.
Aid will be granted to Greece, Russia will be
stopped. A Government will continue in Greece.
Why not let the U.N. do it? There is only one possi
ble way of getting the necessary trust from the im
portant people of Greece and that is to appeal to
them, not as one nation, leaving itself wide open to
charges of "imperialism," but to appeal to them as a
group of nations pledged to set up a strong and able
government based on the majority will of the people.
What can a college student do about this situation?
Keep the name and the ideals of the U.N. alive and ask
for all possible support along this line for Greece.

the policies already established, and in essence con
tinuing the Civil War.
The situation in Greece is rapidly approaching
that state of political vacuum which made Spain so
hard for a person of the "middle group" when it was
in the throes of a Civil War. A .person interested in
preserving "democratic institutions" there had his
choice of backing a government dominated and backed
by Fascists and tolerated for expediency by many of
the democracies of the world, or backing an Army
composed of Communists and Anarchists who were
getting a lot of active support from people who hon
estly hated Fascism.
There is an old Greek proverb which fits here:
"It's the tailor's fault, and they beat the cook." When
we consider Greece why not consider the people,
probably a large majority, who are not Communists,
but who will not support a Royalist government and
will fight us if we do support a Royalist government.
Should we fight the middle group of Greece for
something that is not their fault, but rather the fault
of a small militant group of Communists?
Greece could be the beginning of a strong U.N.
Aid will be granted to Greece, Russia will be
stopped. A Government will continue in Greece.
Why not let the U.N. do it? There is only one possi
ble way of getting the necessary trust from the im
portant people of Greece and that is to appeal to
them, not as one nation, leaving itself wide open to
charges of "imperialism," but to appeal to them as a
group of nations pledged to set up a strong and able
government based on the majority will of the people.
What can a college student do about this situation?
Keep the name and the ideals of the U.N. alive and ask
for all possible support along this line for Greece.
Traditionally the British have supported "the
strong" and not "a democratic" government in the
countries of the Near East This is the policy that
had her supporting the Moslem Government of the
Turkish Sultan against the uprising of the Greek
peoples 120 years ago. The same Greek people we are
rushing to defend today.
Churchill, undoubtedly a fine war leader, but
undoubtedly a rank conservative, witness the Fulton
speech, was in complete control of British policy
under war-time conditions when Greece was "given
democracy" in 1944.
During time of crisis few people who sincerely
hate and want to fight an oppressor bother t,o check,
or care about, party affiliations. Communists may
not be a lot of things, but they are willing to work,
they are able, and they did hate Fascists, which gave
a coinmonbond with all other haters of Facismj
Because of their long experience before the war
there is little doubt that many of the top leaders of
the strong resistance groups in Greece in 1944 were
Communists. But' there were some 60,000 men in the
ELAS, which was the fighting force of the EAM, the
political group which supported the guerillas. It has
been admitted by almost every faction in Greece that
the EI.AS was the most effective fighting force under
the Nazi occupation.
There is no way of checking but it stands to rea
son that not all of those 00,000 were Communists. In
fact active Communists were probobly a very small
minority of the number.
The British were faced with a decision. If they
recognized the ELAS as a whole they would be recog
nizing the Communist minority in their midst. This
could develop into a situation similar to the one
which we now see before us in France. There Dem
ocracy is in balance, but there is no civil war.
Churchill backed a Royalist government. The
ELAS turned its guns from the retreating Germans

onto the advancing British. Greece has been in a
state of Economic and Civil anarchy ever since.
We are now talking of supporting the govern
ment set up by British, sending in troops to support
the policies already established, and in essence con
tinuing the Civil War.
