To the Editor:
The reasons offered for the Truman Doctrine are
three: Soviet expansion; the threat of Communism;
the defense of democracy. The extension of Soviet
frontiers ended 20 months ago, on V-J Day. No
where in the world are Russian forces beyond the
lines they held then. Everywhere along their perim
eter they have been withdrawn, although no power
on earth could have forced them to do so against
their will, short of full-fledged war by us.
Mere is the record: complete withdrawal from
Norway. Danish Bornholm Island, Czechoslovakia.
Yugoslavia, and Iran. Withdrawal from Finland and
Manchuria except for one naval base city in each
ease the only bases Russia holds beyond her Iron
tiers in the entire world. She asks two more. Par
tial withdrawal from Poland, Bulgaria, Rumania,
and Hungary. The overall picture is that the USSR,
second strongest | ower in the world, has less terri
tory than ci MTepit Tsarist Russia on the eve of
World War 1! Its most distant military outposts are
far closer to home than our own.
What of the threat of Communism? Turkey is one
of the very few countries in the world that have no
Communist party, legal or illegal. Neither did it
have a Democratic party, or any other l"gal opposi
tion. until a year ago, when one was created as part
of the drive for American and British support which
began with the Turkish declaration of war against

Germany one month before V-E Day, when Ger
man troops were safely out ol reach. At present,
opposition is so feared that the Chronicle reports
(way down on an inside page) that the Democratic
party boycotted the municipal elections just held
because it considered them completely unfair. Where,
then, is the Communism which Mr. Truman allegedly
fears? Where is the democracy he seeks to protect?
Greece has a strong Communist party, so strong
that the resistance movement it led made the British
entry a parade—four Tommies killed in the whole
country, according to official casualty reports! Does
that make the Greek Communists —and the non-
Communist but non-royalist majority who followed
them our enemies? Does that make democrats of its
kings, nephews of the last German Kaiser Wilhelm
Hohenzollern?
In France, where the Soviet Army never set foot,
the Communist party won the largest number of
votes in ili«> recent election. In Cuba and Chile. Com
munist votes in the last elections have been so great
that they sit in the Cabinet, as in most countries of
Europe. Does that mean that France, Cuba, Chile,
Belgium, Italy. Finland. Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia,
and Poland are to see the kind of thing that just
got five marines killed in China? Anti-Communism
cannot be made to work as the 2Ulh century version
of the Whit" Man's Burden. Hitler tried it. America
didn't fall for it.
