Glasses, combs, textbooks, class
notes, scarves, dime - store beads,
leather jackets, a smoking jacket,
fountain pens, keys, term papers,
mittens, and slide-rules rest in a
carefully guarded room in the Ad
ministration Building's accounting
offices, constituting the Lost and
Found Department in room 1(55.
"There's no special reason for the
department to be here," explains
genial Otis Sather. who is in charge
of the department. '"It's just been
in our offices for years. The stuff
just gets handed down from one
year to the next, as do the articles
that don't get claimed," explained
"Otie" as his associates call him.
Probably some of the items have
been there for fifty years, he said.
Mr. Sather is also cashier of the
University and was formerly em
ployed in the banking business.
BANKER NEEDED
"And it takes a banker to run the
department, since it really is like
a little bank," he explains.
To reduce the vast accumulation,
the department is now investigating
the legality of giving the articles to
the finders in case the owners do
not claim them within a reasonable
lime.
ITEMS TO BE TAGGED
A new mimeographed form which
is being prepared will provide for
greater systematization of the de
partment. Each article will be tag
ged with a number. The number
will be put on the mimeographed
form, along with the date, descrip
tion, and finder's identification. The
finder will get a duplicate form. If
it is legal, the article will be given
to the finder if not claimed. If the
article is not claimed by the finder,
it will be disposed of by the Uni
versity, explained Sather.
There is also a small lost and
found department in the A.S.S.U.
office to handle items lost at dances
and social functions on campus.
Among the treasures there are an
evening handbag and a pearl ring,
which have been there since last
year.
