# Speculations Flood Campus As Elections Approach
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
Wlnio the nation looks to the '48 political scene, Stanford
focuses its attention today on the Farm's coming election.
Speculation on probable candidates for the ASSU presidency
and vice presidency has run high all week with few prospective
candidates ready to commit themselves to a definite "yes" or
"no" on the question of their running. Each candidate is waiting
for the next one to toss the first hat in the ring.
The question of whether the Row will continue its hold on
the presidency in spite of its reduced ratio in comparison with
the halls and the Village has caused comment all oyer campus
this week. The backers of a hall candidate have stated that they
can see serious competition for their man only in such Row pos
sibilities as Morley Thompson, Eugene Mitgard, or Dave David
son. Two fraternity men, on the other hand, said today that they
feel tliat this year the president will come from either the Hails
or the Village.
"To heck with the men," stated a prominent political figure

on campus, who refused to have his name divulged. "The vole
around this campus that really matters is the women's. The
men's vote will be split anyway, but the women are apt to vote
as a body. Secondly, more women, in proportion to their num
ber, vote in student elections."
Probable candidate Eugene Mitgard hedged when confronted
with the question of his running. "I don't know," Mitgard said,
"It depends on many factors." He went no further in explaining
the conditions. Many of his fraternity brothers, however, be
lieve he will hop on the political merry-go-round.
Tom Martzloff and Bill McPherson have, on the other hand,
definitely committed themselves on the presidency. Berth an
swered yes.
Martzloff has already jumped into the race with friends all
ever the campus comprising a Martzloff publicity agency. "The
encouragement I have received from friends in many different
living groups coupled with my own interest and desire to par
ticipate in student government were the primary considerations

influencing my decision to run for president," Martzloff said.
Toyori groups plus the Eating Clubs have expressed favor in
McPhersou's decision to run. McPherson, in fact, stated that
because of their suggestion he considered being a candidate.
To date, Morloy Thompson has answered in the negative,
but some factions on the campus believe that he might step into
the field at a later date. Many Row men can se<=> the possibility
of the presidency falling to a fraternity man only with a strong
candidate like Thompson or Mitgard. An Alpha Delt stated that
the Row must get firmly behind one good candidate and not
split their strength on numerous nominees.
John Averill looms as the Village's candidate for the presi- |
dency. Earlier Wray Wilson denied the iuinor that he was also
a probable Village candidate.
Another "1 don't know, wait and sec" candidate is Cecil
Rospaw. He is, as yet, undecided, but the possibility of his run- !
ning can not be overlooked.
An emphatic "no" came from Dave HeyJer, who had numer- j

ous times last quarter been rumored to have the presidency in
mind. His Phi Psi brother, Dave Davidson, said simply that ho
didn't know anything about his own candidacy, although he
admitted that there had been some talk in his house about it.
Bob Coate expressed surprise when confronted with the
probability of his running. He, too, said that although he hadn't
seirously considered being a nominee, he had heard some agita
tion among the Fijis concerning his candidacy. "But I don't in
tend to run on my own," Coate said.
Looking to the vice-presidency, only two women, Guyla
Run yon and Babs Wilbur, have definitely stated that they axe in
tho running. Sonne women politicos are worried that too many
well-qualified women will run for the vice-presidency without
also considering the accompanying position of president of
Women's Conference, a job that will demand outstanding quali
fications.
The field is open; Stanford's political wheels have started
revolving. Speculation will continue until the final outcome,
April 24.
