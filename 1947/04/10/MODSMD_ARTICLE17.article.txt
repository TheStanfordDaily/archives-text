## 
### 
The three point program of the Truman Doctrine, stopping expansion
of Russia, checking Communism, and supporting democracy, primarily in
Greece and Turkey, was repudiated last night by William Mandel, fellow
at <he Hoover War Library in Slavic studies, before the Stanford AVC.
Mandel pointed out. using documented facts, that: Russia is smaller

today than she was at the beginning
of World War I; she has withdrawn
from all but enemy territories in
cluding Poland, the Balkans, Iran,
and China; that the countries of
Western Europe are today more in
danger of Communism than those of
the East; that the present govern
ment of Greece is not democratic;
that the government of Turkey has
never been democratic.
He stated that the Russians' pri
mary concern is to work out a peace
with the Allies based on the Pots
darn agreement. Mandel felt that
the Greco-Turkish question had
been raised to apply pressure or
Russia to get concessions in Ger
many.
He further declared that the sit
uation in Eastern Europe is not onf
nf primarily Communist inspiratior
but. basically one of social changf
He said, "The countries of the Bal
kans and Central Europe have more
in common with each other than
with either America or Russia ns
they are all governed by coalition
governments formed from the ele
ments which fought Fascism.
Mand?l did not, feel thatoo r
move meant war in th« immediate
future, bu* he did state that unles r
■* broad movement of the- Ameri
can people stopped this ' imperial
ism" r-oon it could only lead to war.
