# Last Village Family Units To Be Completed May 15
## 
### 
Completion of the last units of the Stanford Village family
housing project by May 15 was announced yesterday by Dwight
B. Adams, Village Director.
Fifty-eight additional family units will be occupied between
now and May 15 to fill the project's original guota of 300 family

apartments. "As each of the
apartments is completed, it is occu
pied by u veteran and his family,"
Adams staled.
- UFANTS MOVE IN
No families occupied the apart
ments last September. As the Fed
i v.d Public Housing Commision com
leted each imit, u family promptly
occupied the area. "Only veterans
are alloted space in the project,"
Adams said, "but we are authorized
by the federal Lanham Act to allot
j percent of our space for faculty
members." Many of the 15 faculty
members are veterans.
Family unit population includes
5 children, f>3 of that number be
ing expectant. Nearly half of the
youngsters are under two yea/s id
jge while the eldest are 11.
NO FARM PROFITS
Family housing in the Village is
federally financed. "All profits go to
the government, but losses must be
sustained by the University. There
is no chance lor Stanford to earn
a dime from the project," Adams
pointed out.
Few, if any, apartments or homes
outside of Stanford Village exist for
the families, and the only students
to leave their units have been those
leaving Stanford itself.
"Some families are so content
with their surroundings that they
have turned down apartment offers
in this area, while others have even
stepped building on private homes,
"Parents feel," Adams said, "that
the friends they have met In their
backyards plus companionship the
children have with youngsters of
their own age is a valuable asset to
the family group."
Several families have added to
their apartments such small items
as additional shelves, lawns, and
gardens. Industrious student fathers,
however, furnished the labor to
fence in backyards to prevent cross
country wanderings by the children.
Materials and experienced super
vision was financed and furnished
by the University.
EACH UNIT IS FURNISHED
Each apartment contains a kero
sene stove, icebox, dinette table and
i hairs, bureaus, mirrors, and beds.
Families prepare 'their own meals
m the kitchens, wash their clothes
;.t the Bendix self-laundering serv
-1 i\ and plan neighborhood projects
through the Family Council presided
over by Mrs. Kenneth Cuthbertson. I
"All apartments have a kitchen
nd bathroom. Some of the units,
however, liave two bedrooms and a
living room or one bedroom and a
living room or just the one bedroom- i
living room combination. Rent is'
$45, $39.50, and $36.50, respectively,"
be said. All 300 family units fall
into one of the three above cale- I
gories.
UMTS HERE TO STAY
Adams summed up Village fain- j
i!y housing with, "Family apart-!
ments aie open 12 months of the j
year. As long as the units are needed '
by the ex-G.I. students and their j
families, the area will be available."
