# Elixir for Stanford Dance Problem Still Sought
## 
### 
The experiment's been tried.
And now is the time to measure
up the results and see what the
campus dance situation is right now.
Controversy covered the Quad last
quarter as one group said high
priced, lushly decorated, all-campus
dances weren't the solution to the
apathy greeting all Farm social at
tempts.
The other side hailed the Soph
Cotillion as the first step toward
overcoming that apathy.
but it is clear that the question
goes far beyond that of one dance,
according to Millie Edwards, vice
president of the student body.
"The problem is based oil the
mood not only of Stanford but the
whole nation. The so-tailed apa
thy is due to the mood of the
times in a period of post-Mar re
adjustment. When people realign
themselves we won't have to wor
ry about solutions to the problem.
There won't be a problem."
Referring to the Sophomore Co
tillion, Miss Edwards said that it is
not lair to use the one dance as a
basis lor deciding the big dance vs.
small dance question. It would take

more than one dance to prove any
thing.
"The results of the Sophomore
Cotillion can't be measured until we
see the effect, on future dances. Al

though the dance lost money, there
are other intangible considerations
to take into account," Miss Edwards
said.
The intangibilities are the success
of the dance with those who went
and the attendant word of mouth
that followed.
"I heard many persons say they
wished they'd gone," Miss Edwards
pointed out. "Next time they will
go, and because of the spadework
of the Soph Cotillion."
As lo a matter of money, the
Sophomore Cotillion took in about
Sl,50() and has already paid oul
$2,050 with more bills yet unset
tled, according to the A.S.S.U.
business office.
Another point to take into con
sideration in examining the worth
of the Soph Cotillion is that few
Cotillions down through the years
have made money.
"Although Excom hasn't formu
lated a 'policy' about the dance sit
uation, 1 think the most people will
be the happiest by having a few big
dances and really supporting them
and having many small intimate af
fairs in individual houses,'' said
Miss Edwards.

Row street dances, or mid-Quad
J dances or mass open houses are all
j good ideas. "We want to put on a
| variety of events so that everybody
I on campus will find something to
their taste," Miss Edwards stated.
"What we need is the ideas. All
' this criticism pro and con that has
been going 011 is healthy ami con
! struclive in the long run, because
the best ideas come out that way,"
she said.
Just the other day somebody
; brought in the idea of hanging a
■ large sign outside the Union to an
j nounce coming social events, she
j stated.
Meanwhile Gene Mitguard, busi
ness manager of the A.S.S.U., added
j an interesting financial angle to the
| situation, "There is also a happy
medium about the big dances, them
selves," he said. "Take for example
1 the dances alter the S.C. game last
; fall. People had a reason to go. The
! prices wex - e right. And both dances
| made money.
"More important, they pleased the
• people. From a strictly business
, point of view, 1 think it is easier to
interest two persons at $2.50 a bid
i than one at $5."

The experiment's been tried.
And now is the time to measure
up the results and see what the
campus dance situation is right now.
Controversy covered the Quad last
quarter as one group said high
priced, lushly decorated, all-campus
dances weren't the solution to the
apathy greeting all Farm social at
tempts.
The other side hailed the Soph
Cotillion as the first step toward
overcoming that apathy.
but it is clear that the question
goes far beyond that of one dance,
according to Millie Edwards, vice
president of the student body.
"The problem is based oil the
mood not only of Stanford but the
whole nation. The so-tailed apa
thy is due to the mood of the
times in a period of post-Mar re
adjustment. When people realign
themselves we won't have to wor
ry about solutions to the problem.
There won't be a problem."
Referring to the Sophomore Co
tillion, Miss Edwards said that it is
not lair to use the one dance as a
basis lor deciding the big dance vs.
small dance question. It would take

more than one dance to prove any
thing.
"The results of the Sophomore
Cotillion can't be measured until we
see the effect, on future dances. Al

though the dance lost money, there
are other intangible considerations
to take into account," Miss Edwards
said.
The intangibilities are the success
of the dance with those who went
and the attendant word of mouth
that followed.
"I heard many persons say they
wished they'd gone," Miss Edwards
pointed out. "Next time they will
go, and because of the spadework
of the Soph Cotillion."
As lo a matter of money, the
Sophomore Cotillion took in about
Sl,50() and has already paid oul
$2,050 with more bills yet unset
tled, according to the A.S.S.U.
business office.
