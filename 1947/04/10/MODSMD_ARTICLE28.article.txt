# Thieves Raid Fraternities
## 
### 
Burglars entered Sigma Nu, The la
Xi, and Delta Chi fraternities about
3 last night, taking loot estimated
at $130, according to Chief of Po
lice (Jordon R. Davis.
In each case the second - floor
rooms wefe entered and currency
was removed from wallets that had
been left on desks or in pockets.
Chief Davis warned: "Buildings
have always been left open with
personal property of value left scat
tered about. This is indicative of
substantial losses in the future un
less step.-; are taken by each house
to make such robberies impossible."
In past years prowlers have been
caught, but always have had a
plausible excuse for being in the
house.
In the future Chief Davis hopes
that if a prowler is accosted during
die early morning hours, he will be
detained or at least his description,
the direction he left, and his trans
portation will be noted.
