Jackie Robinson lias been banner
sports copy since he was signed by
Brunch Rickey last year to play for
tlie Brooklyn - patented Montreal
entry in the International League.
The big question then and now is
will dusky Jackie yet a chance with
the Dodgers, and become the first
Negro to crash into big-time base
ball since 1884?
Robinson is perhaps the greatest
all-round athlete his race has ever
produced. He is right at the top in
bast-ball, football, and track. At
IJ.C.L.A. he played All - American
football but just like Kenny Wash
ington he was denied All-American
recognition. It this freedom of op
portunity?
A BUM DEAL
Shouldn't the leaders of Ameri
can athletics, a fine and important
part of the American way of life,
take the lead in seeing that there is
freedom of opportunity in sports?
This may sound a little high and
mighty, but it all boils down to the
J act that some Jewish, Negro, and
other minority group athletes have
been and still are getting a bum
deal from some leaders of the sports
world.
During the past basketball season,
for example, the coach of a leading
Rocky Mountain university yelled
nasty names at some of the Jewish
members of an Eastern college team
which his team was playing. A
j-uy like that shouldn't live so long
as to find himself in a position of
leadership in sports.
A SURE-FIRE BET
'letting back to Jackie Robinson.
Although every scribe and scout
that has seen him play during spring
training has said that he shows ev
erything and more that can be
asked of any rookie, and that he
think Jackie will get the chance he
looks like a sure-fire bet. I don't
deserves.
Brooklyn owner Branch Rickey is
undoubtedly a sincere man. Ho
would like to see Jackie Robinson
playing for his Bums. The Mahatma
is not one to turn down any extra
shekels, anil Robinson would be a
tremendous turnstile - mover. But
there is outside and inside pressure
that is determined to keep Jackie
out of the majors.
WHAT ABOUT JOE LOUIS?
Some of the baseball hierarchy
are Southerners who just don't like
to admit that a member of the in
ferior Negro race is capable of ath
letic ability equal to the whites. (I
don't know how they explain away
.Joe Louis.) Then there are baseball
leaders that just don't want to cross
such a controversial bridge. Maybe
they've been reading Thornton
Wilder's "Bridge of San Luis Roy"
or maybe they just lack the guts
to take such a step.
LOTS OF PRESSURE
There is also pressure from within
the Dodgers. Some of the Bums
(that's a good nickname, too) don't
want to see Jackie on "their" team.
"Where would he stay when we're
on the road?" . . . "He couldn't cat
with us." . . . "He'd have to ride
in our railroad car." . . . Oh. my!
Those that are afraid to say any
thing else alibi with statements like
"He's just a flash in the pan and
could never stick in the majors any
way." or "He's just not major league
caliber." That doesnt' seem to be
too logical when Jackie led the In
t rnational League batters last year,
looked very good in the field, and
has been hotter than a Cuban fan
danuo during spring training.
CiUNS AND BATS
Jackie is ready to come to close
quarters with his lnte. He sincerely
h els that he will get a chance with
the Dodgers. He says. "Uncle Sam
doesn't care about a boy's color when
he sticks a gun in his hands; I can't
ee why a baseball club should do
any different when they stick a bat
in his hand."
The Dodgers need a first base
man. and Jackie has worked very
well at that spot with the Montreal
team during spring training. Though
he had never played first before,
lie stepper right in and looked like
he was born and raised on thp'sack.
Ed Stevens and Howie Schultz
. bared the bag for the Bums last
year and n'either burned up the
league. There "are three rookies
working out for the spot, Jack
Pacpke, Lou Ruchser, and Jack
Douglas, but these boys haven't
hown the class or the savvy that
Jackie has.
APRIL IS DEADLINE
The bridge has to be crossed soon,
if at all. The Brooklyn organization
both the bosses and players—must
<'orne to a definite decision by April
18. By that date Jackie must be
called up to the National League
club or left in the minors.
The Dodgers need Jackie Robin
son, and be wants and deserves the
chance, but I don't think he'll get it.
1 hope I'm wrong.

.Joe Louis.) Then there are baseball
leaders that just don't want to cross
such a controversial bridge. Maybe
they've been reading Thornton
Wilder's "Bridge of San Luis Roy"
or maybe they just lack the guts
to take such a step.
LOTS OF PRESSURE
There is also pressure from within
the Dodgers. Some of the Bums
(that's a good nickname, too) don't
want to see Jackie on "their" team.
"Where would he stay when we're
on the road?" . . . "He couldn't cat
with us." . . . "He'd have to ride
in our railroad car." . . . Oh. my!
Those that are afraid to say any
thing else alibi with statements like
"He's just a flash in the pan and
could never stick in the majors any
way." or "He's just not major league
caliber." That doesnt' seem to be
too logical when Jackie led the In
t rnational League batters last year,
looked very good in the field, and
has been hotter than a Cuban fan
danuo during spring training.
CiUNS AND BATS
Jackie is ready to come to close
quarters with his lnte. He sincerely
h els that he will get a chance with
the Dodgers. He says. "Uncle Sam
doesn't care about a boy's color when
he sticks a gun in his hands; I can't
ee why a baseball club should do
any different when they stick a bat
in his hand."
The Dodgers need a first base
man. and Jackie has worked very
well at that spot with the Montreal
team during spring training. Though
he had never played first before,
lie stepper right in and looked like
he was born and raised on thp'sack.
Ed Stevens and Howie Schultz
. bared the bag for the Bums last
year and n'either burned up the
league. There "are three rookies
working out for the spot, Jack
Pacpke, Lou Ruchser, and Jack
Douglas, but these boys haven't
hown the class or the savvy that
Jackie has.
APRIL IS DEADLINE
The bridge has to be crossed soon,
if at all. The Brooklyn organization
both the bosses and players—must
<'orne to a definite decision by April
18. By that date Jackie must be
called up to the National League
club or left in the minors.
The Dodgers need Jackie Robin
son, and be wants and deserves the
chance, but I don't think he'll get it.
1 hope I'm wrong.
with DON DAYIES
Jackie Robinson lias been banner
sports copy since he was signed by
Brunch Rickey last year to play for
tlie Brooklyn - patented Montreal
entry in the International League.
The big question then and now is
will dusky Jackie yet a chance with
the Dodgers, and become the first
Negro to crash into big-time base
ball since 1884?
Robinson is perhaps the greatest
all-round athlete his race has ever
produced. He is right at the top in
bast-ball, football, and track. At
IJ.C.L.A. he played All - American
football but just like Kenny Wash
ington he was denied All-American
recognition. It this freedom of op
portunity?
A BUM DEAL
Shouldn't the leaders of Ameri
can athletics, a fine and important
part of the American way of life,
take the lead in seeing that there is
freedom of opportunity in sports?
This may sound a little high and
mighty, but it all boils down to the
J act that some Jewish, Negro, and
other minority group athletes have
been and still are getting a bum
deal from some leaders of the sports
world.
During the past basketball season,
for example, the coach of a leading
Rocky Mountain university yelled
nasty names at some of the Jewish
members of an Eastern college team
which his team was playing. A
j-uy like that shouldn't live so long
as to find himself in a position of
leadership in sports.
A SURE-FIRE BET
'letting back to Jackie Robinson.
Although every scribe and scout
that has seen him play during spring
training has said that he shows ev
erything and more that can be
asked of any rookie, and that he
think Jackie will get the chance he
looks like a sure-fire bet. I don't
deserves.
Brooklyn owner Branch Rickey is
undoubtedly a sincere man. Ho
would like to see Jackie Robinson
playing for his Bums. The Mahatma
is not one to turn down any extra
shekels, anil Robinson would be a
tremendous turnstile - mover. But
there is outside and inside pressure
that is determined to keep Jackie
out of the majors.
WHAT ABOUT JOE LOUIS?
Some of the baseball hierarchy
are Southerners who just don't like
to admit that a member of the in
ferior Negro race is capable of ath
letic ability equal to the whites. (I
don't know how they explain away

son, and be wants and deserves the
chance, but I don't think he'll get it.

Jackie Robinson lias been banner
sports copy since he was signed by
Brunch Rickey last year to play for
tlie Brooklyn - patented Montreal
entry in the International League.
The big question then and now is
will dusky Jackie yet a chance with
the Dodgers, and become the first
Negro to crash into big-time base
ball since 1884?
Robinson is perhaps the greatest
all-round athlete his race has ever
produced. He is right at the top in
bast-ball, football, and track. At
IJ.C.L.A. he played All - American
football but just like Kenny Wash
ington he was denied All-American
recognition. It this freedom of op
portunity?
A BUM DEAL
Shouldn't the leaders of Ameri
can athletics, a fine and important
part of the American way of life,
take the lead in seeing that there is
freedom of opportunity in sports?
This may sound a little high and
mighty, but it all boils down to the
J act that some Jewish, Negro, and
other minority group athletes have
been and still are getting a bum
deal from some leaders of the sports
world.
During the past basketball season,
for example, the coach of a leading
Rocky Mountain university yelled
nasty names at some of the Jewish
members of an Eastern college team
which his team was playing. A
j-uy like that shouldn't live so long
as to find himself in a position of
leadership in sports.
A SURE-FIRE BET
'letting back to Jackie Robinson.
Although every scribe and scout
that has seen him play during spring
training has said that he shows ev
erything and more that can be
asked of any rookie, and that he
think Jackie will get the chance he
looks like a sure-fire bet. I don't
deserves.
Brooklyn owner Branch Rickey is
undoubtedly a sincere man. Ho
would like to see Jackie Robinson
playing for his Bums. The Mahatma
is not one to turn down any extra
shekels, anil Robinson would be a
tremendous turnstile - mover. But
there is outside and inside pressure
that is determined to keep Jackie
out of the majors.
WHAT ABOUT JOE LOUIS?
Some of the baseball hierarchy
are Southerners who just don't like
to admit that a member of the in
ferior Negro race is capable of ath
letic ability equal to the whites. (I
don't know how they explain away
.Joe Louis.) Then there are baseball
leaders that just don't want to cross
such a controversial bridge. Maybe
they've been reading Thornton
Wilder's "Bridge of San Luis Roy"
or maybe they just lack the guts
to take such a step.
LOTS OF PRESSURE
There is also pressure from within
the Dodgers. Some of the Bums
(that's a good nickname, too) don't
want to see Jackie on "their" team.
"Where would he stay when we're
on the road?" . . . "He couldn't cat
with us." . . . "He'd have to ride
in our railroad car." . . . Oh. my!
Those that are afraid to say any
thing else alibi with statements like
"He's just a flash in the pan and
could never stick in the majors any
way." or "He's just not major league
caliber." That doesnt' seem to be
too logical when Jackie led the In
t rnational League batters last year,
looked very good in the field, and
has been hotter than a Cuban fan
danuo during spring training.
CiUNS AND BATS
Jackie is ready to come to close
quarters with his lnte. He sincerely
h els that he will get a chance with
the Dodgers. He says. "Uncle Sam
doesn't care about a boy's color when
he sticks a gun in his hands; I can't
ee why a baseball club should do
any different when they stick a bat
in his hand."
The Dodgers need a first base
man. and Jackie has worked very
well at that spot with the Montreal
team during spring training. Though
he had never played first before,
lie stepper right in and looked like
he was born and raised on thp'sack.
Ed Stevens and Howie Schultz
. bared the bag for the Bums last
year and n'either burned up the
league. There "are three rookies
working out for the spot, Jack
Pacpke, Lou Ruchser, and Jack
Douglas, but these boys haven't
hown the class or the savvy that
Jackie has.
APRIL IS DEADLINE
The bridge has to be crossed soon,
if at all. The Brooklyn organization
both the bosses and players—must
<'orne to a definite decision by April
18. By that date Jackie must be
called up to the National League
club or left in the minors.
