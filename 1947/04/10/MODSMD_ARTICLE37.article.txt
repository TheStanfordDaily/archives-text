CINCINNATI, 0., April 9 (UP) Commissioner Happy Chand
ler, in the most sweeping punitive action since the Black Sox
scandal in 1919, today suspended Brooklyn Manager Leo Duro
cher lor a year, banned New York Yankee Coach Charley Dres
sen for 30 days, and fined each club 52,000 for "conduct

detrimental to baseball."
He also handed out a $500 fine to
Harold Parrott, road secretary of
the Brooklyn club, "for writing a de
liberately derogatory column about
others in baseball."
It was the first time that Chandler
had gotten tough enough to wield a
big stick since he was installed as
commissioner, but once he made up
his mind to do il he was merciless.
Never before had a big league
manager been banned from running
his team for an entire season, and
the blow came as a particularly
heavy one to the Dodgers, who were
left without a Held pilot five days
before the opening of the 15)47 sea
son.
DUROCHER-MacPIIAIL FEUD
The rulings were the outgrowth
of a winter-long feud between the
teams which started when Dress en
broke a gentleman's agreement with
President Branch Rickey of the
Dodgers and went to the Yankees
as a coach. It was climaxed at the
Dodgers' spring training camp in
Havana when both Durocher and
Rickey accused MacPhail of having
two well - known gamblers in his
box at an exhibition game between
the teams.
INCIDENT IN HAVANA
"This incident in Havana, which
brought considerable unfavorable
comment to baseball generally, was
one of a series of publicity-produc
ing affairs in which Manager Duro
cher has been involved in the last
few months," Chandler said in his
ruling.
"Managers of baseball teams are
responsible for the conduct of play
ers on the field. Good managers are

able to insure the good conduct of
the players on the field and fre
quently their example can influence
players to be of good conduct off
the field."
Chandler said that "Durocher has
not measured up to the standards
expected or required of managers of
iÂ»ur baseball teams. . . . As a re
sult of the accumulation of unpleas
ant incidents detrimental to base
ball, Manager Durocher is hereby
suspended from participating in
professional baseball for the, 1947
season."
Chandl"! - in a parting thrust
warned all parties involved in the
feud that they were treading on
"thin ice."
"All parties to this controversy
are silenced from the time this order
is issued," he said.
