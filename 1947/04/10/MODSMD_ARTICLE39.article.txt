# Cards Work for 'Shakes; Prep for San Jose Meet
## 
### JOHN HUBBARD 
As an added incentive for their j
Cardinal trackmen, now in training j
for Saturday's meet with San Jose
State here, coaches Jack Weiers
hauser and Cornelius "Dutch" War- :
merdam are offering a set of re
wards —each in the form of one (1) ;
milkshake—to the first team mem
ber in any event who can measure
up to certain prescribed standards, j
A total of 11) "shakes have been ,
reserved at the Encina Cellar for the
lucky Indians who can qualify for |
them. None of the 'shakes, however, >
have been claimed as yet.
MAXWELL IN THE CENTURY
The standards set up by the two
coaches are not out of the reach i
of Stanford's thincluds, even at this
early point in the season.
For instance, in the 100-yd. dash j
all Weiershauser and Warmerdam
ask is that someone negotiate the
distance in less than 10 seconds.
Terry Maxwell, low man in the
century with a practice time of 10.1,
has the inside track on the bonus j
for that event.
Maxwell also has the edge in the
220. The coaches have listed any
thing under 22 seconds as their re
quired time, and the six-foot sprinter '
is nudging that mark with 22.1.
GRIMES CAN COLLECT
For the 440 the two Mr. W's are j
looking for anything better than 49
seconds. George Grimes could well
collect fhe shake in the quarter
mile. He's done 49.6 in practice. 1
Grimes seems to be the number:
one candidate in the 880, as well, j
His time of 1:54.7 is just seven-!
tenths of a second over the pre
scribed mark.
Ganahl is making a strong bid for
honors in both the mile and two- j
mile. He has been clocked at 4:24.7 1
and approximately 9:5(5 in those !
events, with the coaches asking just j
better than 4:20 and 9:45.
Newly elected captain A1 Snyder j
has done 14.9 in the high hurdles
and 24.7 in the lows. The required
times or this dun of races—anything J
under 14.8 and 24.4.
Frosh Otis Chandler, who broke
a frosh shotput record of 13 years
standing in the meet against the j
jaycees last Saturday, is only five I
inches short of the coaches' mark.
His record breaking heave was 48' I
7',"; he'll have to do just over 49'
to earn his milkshake.
Chuck Coker, recent transfer from
Modesto, is the favorite to capture
the honors in the discus. He's done
138' 10", with the standard set at |
145' plus.
Frank Held, with 188 feet in the \
javelin, is two feet short of the
goal of 190 plus in that event.

The coaches are asking that 22'
6" be bettered in the broad jump.
Fred Fank has leaped 22 3 " in
practice.
A dark horse, John Bryan, is mak
ing a strong bid for the milkshake
money in the high jump. He turned
in a 6' 1 7 8" performance earlier
this week, a slim quarter of an inch
under the required height.
Bill Larson, with 13' 1 3 8" in
the pole vault, needs an additional
four plus inches to top the 13' 6"
mark set by the coaches.
The balance of the 19 shakes are
offered for bettering the following
marks in odd-distance events:
352 yd. race—3B.o; 660 yd.—1:22.0.
1320 yd.—3:10.0, six laps—7:oo, 120
yd. low hurdles—l2.B.

A dark horse, John Bryan, is mak
ing a strong bid for the milkshake
money in the high jump. He turned
in a 6' 1 7 8" performance earlier
this week, a slim quarter of an inch
under the required height.
Bill Larson, with 13' 1 3 8" in
the pole vault, needs an additional
four plus inches to top the 13' 6"
mark set by the coaches.
The balance of the 19 shakes are
offered for bettering the following
marks in odd-distance events:
352 yd. race—3B.o; 660 yd.—1:22.0.
1320 yd.—3:10.0, six laps—7:oo, 120
yd. low hurdles—l2.B.
As an added incentive for their j
Cardinal trackmen, now in training j
for Saturday's meet with San Jose
State here, coaches Jack Weiers
hauser and Cornelius "Dutch" War- :
merdam are offering a set of re
wards —each in the form of one (1) ;
milkshake—to the first team mem
ber in any event who can measure
up to certain prescribed standards, j
A total of 11) "shakes have been ,
reserved at the Encina Cellar for the
lucky Indians who can qualify for |
them. None of the 'shakes, however, >
have been claimed as yet.
MAXWELL IN THE CENTURY
The standards set up by the two
coaches are not out of the reach i
of Stanford's thincluds, even at this
early point in the season.
For instance, in the 100-yd. dash j
all Weiershauser and Warmerdam
ask is that someone negotiate the
distance in less than 10 seconds.
Terry Maxwell, low man in the
century with a practice time of 10.1,
has the inside track on the bonus j
for that event.
Maxwell also has the edge in the
220. The coaches have listed any
thing under 22 seconds as their re
quired time, and the six-foot sprinter '
is nudging that mark with 22.1.
GRIMES CAN COLLECT
For the 440 the two Mr. W's are j
looking for anything better than 49
seconds. George Grimes could well
collect fhe shake in the quarter
mile. He's done 49.6 in practice. 1
Grimes seems to be the number:
one candidate in the 880, as well, j
His time of 1:54.7 is just seven-!
tenths of a second over the pre
scribed mark.
Ganahl is making a strong bid for
honors in both the mile and two- j
mile. He has been clocked at 4:24.7 1
and approximately 9:5(5 in those !
events, with the coaches asking just j
better than 4:20 and 9:45.
Newly elected captain A1 Snyder j
has done 14.9 in the high hurdles
and 24.7 in the lows. The required
times or this dun of races—anything J
under 14.8 and 24.4.
Frosh Otis Chandler, who broke
a frosh shotput record of 13 years
standing in the meet against the j
jaycees last Saturday, is only five I
inches short of the coaches' mark.
His record breaking heave was 48' I
7',"; he'll have to do just over 49'
to earn his milkshake.
Chuck Coker, recent transfer from
Modesto, is the favorite to capture
the honors in the discus. He's done
138' 10", with the standard set at |
145' plus.
Frank Held, with 188 feet in the \
javelin, is two feet short of the
goal of 190 plus in that event.

The coaches are asking that 22'

Fred Fank has leaped 22 3 " in
practice.
