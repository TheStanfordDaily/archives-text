# Indian Nine on Warpath, Battle Bank of America
## 
### LYNN CARMAN 
Coach Harry Wolter's steadily-improving Indian baseballers
go on the warpath again this afternoon at 3:15 when they take
on an invading Bank of America nine on the Sunken Diamond.
Larry Wolf will take the mound against the visitors as he
makes his first starting appearance since the spring vacation
series in the Southland.

The Indians, with last Saturday's
one-run loss to California's Bears
still rankling in their memories, fig
ure to be on the rebound against
the Bankers when they take the
field this afternoon.
BANKERS UNKNOWN QUANTITY
Just how powerful a squad the
Bankers will send into the game is
almost an unknown quantity, for
about the only line the Stanford
camp can get on the invaders is

VILLAGE SOFTBALL SKED
Field A—lildg. 08 vs. Big Red .Ma
chine; official, Mooney
Field B—House 117 vs. House 212:
official. Broun

from the Cal-Banker game played
earlier in the season, when the Bears
came alive in the late innings of the
game to rout their opponents, 16 to 6.
That's only one game, and besides,
the score is deceptive—the Bankers
had a (5-2 lead on Cal going into the
last half of the sixth inning, but
simply fell apart from that point
on. That happens to any team every
now and then, and the question is,
was it an accident that the Bankers
fell apart, or were they playing
over their heads when they held
their four-run lead over the Bears?
INDIANS WILL FIND OUT
Whatever the answer to that ques
tion. the Indians are certain to find
it out this afternoon, and should
have a busy afternoon in battling
the Bankers' attack. Bay Area ama
teur teams seem to have a tendency
to change their personnel from week
to week, and if anything, the Bank,
ers should have a better squad by
now than the one which lost to Cal.

The hurler who'll be out there
against the visitors—Wolf, started
two games during the four-game
Southland tour, but ran into tough
sledding when he was charged with
a loss against Southern California,
with the credit for the other game
he started going to another Cardinal
pitcher.
The same lineup which gave Cal
such a rough time last Saturday will
be back on the field today, with but
one possible exception. Either Frank
McGraw or Ward Walkup will han
dle the catching chores for the In
dians.
DEPENDABLE OUTFIELDERS
Thus. George Sloat. Ted Nell and
Lloyd Merriman will be back pa
trolling the outfield which they so
capably handled last week when
they chased twelve outfield flies dur
ing the course of the game and ga
athered them all in.
Ben Cardinalli will be back at first
base, with Peters taking charge of
second base and diminutive Bill Arce
cooling the hot corner. Buck Bron
son rounds out today's lineup at
short.
Alter today's game, the Red Ma
chine is slated to play the El Toro
Marine baseball squad here Satur
day afternoon.
