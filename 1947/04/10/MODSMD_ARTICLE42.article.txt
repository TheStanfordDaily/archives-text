# HAVE YOU SAID, "I GUESS I'M NOT RELIGIOUS."?
## 
### 
HAVE YOU LOST INTEREST in
all churches because science and
common sense have made many of
their creedal forms and doctrines
seem unsound? Do you feel that no
church should prescribe what you
should believe in matters of theol
ogy over which wise men of all
ages have disagreed?
Because its beliefs are not fro
zen into an inflexible creed, be
cause it is open to all new truths,
from whatever source they may
arise, Unitarianism is a modern,
growing, strengthening faith!
"For me, it is heartening in
these troublous days to turn to the
liberal religion of Jefferson, Emer
son, and Horace Mann. The ac
ceptance of the limitless evolving
truths of science, the freedom from
dogmatic statement or complicated
structure within the church, and,
above all, a positive emphasis on
the democratic process in religion—
these factors alone should arouse a
wide-spread interest in the simple
tenets of Unitarianism." —George
D. Stoddard, President of the Uni
versity of Illinois.
