The visiting firemen from Santa Clara just didn't have enough

power to stem the Cardinal on
slaught which rolled the locals into
an early lead. A couple of late
rallies sent matches into the third
set, but Stanford's netsters calmly 1
put the deciding sets away for match.
Feature match of the day was one
of the long, drawnwout struggles i
which could have gone either way. I
A 1 Martin of Santa Clara finally
pulled the match out of the fire by
stopping Indian Ted Myers' deter
mined rally. Game score was 7-5.
