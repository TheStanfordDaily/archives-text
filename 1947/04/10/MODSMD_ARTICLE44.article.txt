## Lo! The Red Herring 
### 
The accusations recently leveled at Prof.
Paul R. Hanna and Stanford School of Educa
tion would be amusing to the point of being
completely ridiculous had they come at any
other time but this.
However, the present situation is far too
indicative of a trend of reaction which is
sweeping across the entire country, and threat
ens to become worse unless stepped on and
tempered by persons of sound judgment.
This current campaign against Communism
started as a very legitimate move to bar from
positions of authority those persons intent on
forcibly overthrowing the government, but it
has been given such impetus by men like
William C. Bullitt and Gov. Earle that it now
resembles a witch-hunt touched with scenes '
fiom the French Revolution and the Spanish
Inquisition.
The trend, started by men of some experi
ence and reputation and aimed at a rather
narrow field, is now being carried on by com
paratively unknown men of limited experi
ence, many of them maladjusted. They are
seizing the opportunity to resist progressive
change, and are basing their feeling on im
mature emotionalism rather than impartial
study of facts and history.
Such actions must be checked and given a
proper balance by responsible men in posi
tions of authority who can present the facts to
those persons not in possession of them.
We urge the State Legislature to look deeply
into the charges presented to them, and not
to be led by emotional public clamor not
based on facts.
