Interviews v/ith candidates for president,
secretary, and treasurer of Executive Council

of Institute of International Relations are be
ing conducted by Babs Wilbur, temporary
chairman of the Council.
The Institute is the result of two quarters of
effort to unite the various campus groups in
terested in internationalism into one board
which will supervise and coordinate their
activities.
It is essential that a competent and inter
ested person be chosen to head these activi
ties. We urge those who in the past have ex
pressed active interest in such organizations
to contact Babs Wilbur for an interview.

"It is a privilege to teach at a school where
I am not forced to walk up and down the aisles
constantly watching the students whenever I
give a test."
These were the words a Stanford professor
used when discussing the Honor Code with
one of his classes.
Referring to a large university in the mid
west at which he formerly taught, the pro
fessor continued, "At that school supervision
of examinations was such that the professor
felt that he was in a sort of competition with
the student."
Combine this faculty opinion with the ob
vious feeling of the student that taking tests
under the Honor Code is a more suitable man
ner of advanced testing and it becomes ap
parent that Stanford is now using a system that
is appropriate for a university that is interested
in more than the simple teaching of concrete
subjects.â€”G. C.
