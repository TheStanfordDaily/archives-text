"Communist" is a horrid word. At one time it was
not considered fit for use in polite company. Now.
because of a shift in the mores of t.hc American
people, we consider many things in a different light;
we discuss them quite openly. Still, "Communist" is
a term of opprobrium. In an Illinois court it was
recently ruled libel per se to call a person a Com
munist.
Perhaps for that reason Mr. Aaron Sargent (of

I he Sons of the American Revolu
tion Sargents) did not call Prof.
Paul R. Hanna a Communist open
ly. But he certainly implied it. He
called him virtually everything else.
This all came about because the
Sons (and the American Legion—
of which I. unfortunately, am a
paid-up member) do not like a
group of eighth and ninth grade
text hooks called "Building Ameri
ca series. The whole tempest

shows just how ridiculous it is possible for a group
of presumably rational individuals to get.
I have not read the "Building America" series.
However, I have read several of the passages which
Mr. Sargent claims are subversive. These passages
Mr. Sargent cites are so far from being subversive
that at first I thought the whole business was a cheap
publicity stunt, but apparently the Sons are sincere.
If so, I feel sorry for them.
Apparently this series of books attempts to be
objective, with the view of encouraging the young
sters to think for themselves. However, a certain
group of people calling themselves true Americans

has no use for objectivity. Everything has to he
slanted their way.
Others of us have different views, but people
like the Sons feel that any exposition of human fail
ings in the founding fathers is gross slander. They
are too small to see that a man is greater than his
fellows because he is able to rise above his faults,
not because he has none. History shows us only one
perfect man—and the great majority no longer be
lieve in Him.
Those same people also consider it treason to hint
that, there has ever been a fault in what they so
blithely call The American Way. The truth is that
our system is not perfect now, never has been, and
never will be. Our only chance for improvement
lies in our being able to recognize our shortcomings
and go on from there.
Obviously we can't do that if we study only texts
eulogizing the existing system, as Mr. Sargent and
his cohorts wish us to do. We shall have to ignore
the Mr. Sargents of this world—even though it pains
us to do so—and try to improve ourselves by ob
jectively considering every side of every question
strictly on its merits. The periodic blasts and erup
tions of the Mr. Sargents had best be classified along
with the front page editorials run by a certain
coast-to-coast chain of newspapers—and forgotten.
No doubt I shall be reported to the Tenney Com
mittee as a dangerous Red if Mr. Sargent happens to
read this, even though some people on campus call
me a fascist because I think Henry Wallace is a
crackpot. And he will be armed with damaging
evidence.
After all. the editor runs my picture on the LEFT
side of the page.

Mr. Sargent claims are subversive. These passages
Mr. Sargent cites are so far from being subversive
that at first I thought the whole business was a cheap
publicity stunt, but apparently the Sons are sincere.
If so, I feel sorry for them.
Apparently this series of books attempts to be
objective, with the view of encouraging the young
sters to think for themselves. However, a certain
group of people calling themselves true Americans

has no use for objectivity. Everything has to he
slanted their way.
Others of us have different views, but people
like the Sons feel that any exposition of human fail
ings in the founding fathers is gross slander. They
are too small to see that a man is greater than his
fellows because he is able to rise above his faults,
not because he has none. History shows us only one
perfect man—and the great majority no longer be
lieve in Him.
Those same people also consider it treason to hint
that, there has ever been a fault in what they so
blithely call The American Way. The truth is that
our system is not perfect now, never has been, and
never will be. Our only chance for improvement
lies in our being able to recognize our shortcomings
and go on from there.
Obviously we can't do that if we study only texts
eulogizing the existing system, as Mr. Sargent and
his cohorts wish us to do. We shall have to ignore
the Mr. Sargents of this world—even though it pains
us to do so—and try to improve ourselves by ob
jectively considering every side of every question
strictly on its merits. The periodic blasts and erup
tions of the Mr. Sargents had best be classified along
with the front page editorials run by a certain
coast-to-coast chain of newspapers—and forgotten.
No doubt I shall be reported to the Tenney Com
mittee as a dangerous Red if Mr. Sargent happens to
read this, even though some people on campus call
me a fascist because I think Henry Wallace is a
crackpot. And he will be armed with damaging
evidence.
After all. the editor runs my picture on the LEFT

"Communist" is a horrid word. At one time it was
not considered fit for use in polite company. Now.
because of a shift in the mores of t.hc American
people, we consider many things in a different light;
we discuss them quite openly. Still, "Communist" is
a term of opprobrium. In an Illinois court it was
recently ruled libel per se to call a person a Com
munist.
Perhaps for that reason Mr. Aaron Sargent (of

I he Sons of the American Revolu
tion Sargents) did not call Prof.
Paul R. Hanna a Communist open
ly. But he certainly implied it. He
called him virtually everything else.
This all came about because the
Sons (and the American Legion—
of which I. unfortunately, am a
paid-up member) do not like a
group of eighth and ninth grade
text hooks called "Building Ameri
ca series. The whole tempest

shows just how ridiculous it is possible for a group
of presumably rational individuals to get.
