To the Editor:
It appears that Mr. Maridel is using a customary
Party Line technique of isolating segments of policy
and attacking them without recognizing the whole
picture.
Whether the governments of our satellites are
"democratic" or even popular is irrelevant in power
politics provided they are strong enough and oppose
communism (granted there have been mistakes in
the former factor). If this wtjc a criterion, we would
never have accepted Russia as an ally in the second
stage of the present world war.
Granted that talk of "supporting free peoples, etc."
is so much propaganda in the bitter fact of power
polilies. thi> necessity for this was imposed upon us
by Russia. It is not we who have hamstrung and emas
culated the United Nations by vetoing every vital
issue, refused free inspection and dissemination of
uncensored information about our country, and de
veloped the greatest and most widespread Fifth Col
umn network in world history. We. at least, even
when we find it necessary to intervene in world
affairs, are willing to leave the final say to the United
Nations, without benefit of veto (one of the most
statesmanly amendments to come out of Congress).

it is desirable they be short and to the point.)

Who in America could foment war with Russia if
she would do the same? Can it honestly be said
that we represent the greater threat to world peace,
the United Nations, or individual liberty?
It is not the physical expansion of Russian bound
aries we fear, but the insidious infiltration into the
governments of supposedly independent nations, the
attacks of Russian propaganda on our liberties and
way of life, so that many people now think the
American worker who owns a car and home, and
sends his children to school until they are eighteen,
is being ground clown and exploited by the only
economic system yet devised which provides so much.
Let no one forget the fanaticism of Communist
ideology, and the consistency of its tortuous path to
ward its avowed goal of world revolution and Soviet
domination. I. for one, want no part of controlled
thought and a police state, nor do I prefer the du
bious benefits of bureaucratic economic control over
our own fairly efficient free system.
Let Mr. MancJel sludy the whole picture before he
attempts to weaken our policy. It is time for Russia
to do some appeasing and thinking about the rights
of free peoples.
