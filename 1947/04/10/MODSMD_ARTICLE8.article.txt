or eight bundles." he said, "which

to tbe destitute peoples of Europe."
MONEY DONATED
All the clothing is in excellent
condition. Miller said. In addition,
enough money has been donated by
Toyon residents to mail at least two
bundles.
'"Hie drive will continue as long
as there is any response," Miller ex
plained. "Right now we are short
of toilet, articles, school supplies,
and books. The people of Europe
need paper, pencils, and looks just
as much as I hey need foot!."
All types "112 books and magazines
are acceptable. Textbooks are espe
cially desired.
NAMES NEEDED
r rhe relief committee has an
nounced that 'be bundle;; will he
sent principally to students and
their families in Holland and
France. However, anyone having
knowledge of specific persons in
Europe needing help is asked t<>
give thai name to the committee.
The name will then be placed on
the bundle list.
The Toyon committee is accepting
no food, but in-lead is distributing
CARE food blanks. Members stale
I but food can be purchased at a
much lower price in Europe through
the CARE agency. In addition, this
method is said to be quicker and
safer than sending individual food
contributions to Europe.

are needed tonight to wrap and ad
dress the bundles. All persons in
terested in helping are asked to
come into the Toyon Resident Di
