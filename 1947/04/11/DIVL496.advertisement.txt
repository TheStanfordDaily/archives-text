In the Church?

The world is in a constant state
of change, and almost daily science
and philosophy are discovering new
truths. Religion must be sensitive
to these changes. It must adjust
itself to new facts, new conditions.
Unitarians approach religion in the

they are always seekers of truth.
"I regard religious liberalism as

the truth in the field of religion,
wherever that truth may be found."

tice of the U.S. Supreme Court.
