# Cindermen to Meet Fast Spartan Team
## 
### JOHN HUBBARD 
A hasly look at the year's track schedule is apt to give the
false impression that Saturday's Angell Field meet between
Stanford and San Jose will be more or less of a warm-up session
for the Indians, in preparation for bigger and better meets to
come. But, in reality, Coach Jack Weiershauser's charges will
have their work cut out for them. I

The Spartans arc no soft touch. A.s {
;i matter of fact, Stanford is very
likely (o he rated the underdog by
pro-meet dopesters.
INDIANS STRONGER THIS YEAR
Last year San Jose topped Stan- I
ford by slightly more than 20 points ;
in a three-way meet, with Alameda !
Naval Air Station blinking up the
rear. It's no secret that the Indians
are greatly strengthened now over
their last season's showings, but the
same (.-an bo said for San Jose.
SI'ARTAN PERFORMANCES
Take a look at some of the Spar
tan performances last Saturday
against a squad of junior college all
stars:
In the 100-yd. dash San Jose en
tries were one-two-three. The win
ner, Hugh Bingham, turned in a
!).H effort. He finished just inches
ahead of two other teammates, Don
Smalley and Bill Rhync. Stanford's ;
fastest man in this event is Terry i
Maxwell. He's done 10.1. The In- 1
dians' other century sprinters—Bill
Smith and Al Vicrthnler, to name j
two arc a tenth of a second or so j
behind Maxwell. On the basis of !
these statistics the Spartans have a]
very good chance of sweeping the |
100, which would give them nine
big points.
TAR BINGHAM, SMALLEY
Bingham and Smalley, ofT their
race last week, can take first and
second in the 220. Bingham was
clocked at 21 8, with Smalley right
on his heels. Stanford will pin its
hopes on Maxwell, who has done
22.1 in practice.
Outside of the 100. 220, and broad
jump, Saturday's meet should be
pretty much touch-and-go. Weicrs
hauser's men, if they are to win. j
must either break through the San
Jose domination in the sprints and
broad jump or bear down extra
hard in the other events.
Weicrshause has his fingers .
