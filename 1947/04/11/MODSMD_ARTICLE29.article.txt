# Willis Publishes Argentine Story
## 
### 
Dr. Bailey Willis, Stanford professor of geology, emeritus, will be 90
next month, and the occasion will be marked by an accomplishment of
which few men his age can boast—he will have a new book, "A Yanqui in
Patagonia," on the bookstands.
A familiar and beloved figure on the Stanford campus, where he has

been a faculty member since 1915,
Dr. Willis is himself the "Yanqui"
who was in Patagonia, and whose
story is told in the book just pub
lished by the Stanford University
Press.
A R<.EN 11NE EXPEKIENCES
'Die lx>ok relates his experiences
from 1911 to 1915 as consulting geol
ogist to the Minister of Public
Works of Argentina.
The minister dreamed coloniza
tion, and the Yanqui's job was to
explore a remote lake and mountain
region in the Andes, where the
practical Dr. Willis located railways,
classified lands, and estimated wa
ter power.
PLANNED CITY
He planned a city to order, the
"mythical city of the Caesars," and
he tells the reader how. The city
has yet be built, but his explora
tions led to the development of a
national park which is now the re
sort of Argentines for summer and
winter sports. The colonization
which he planned is developing
through energetic Swiss settlers.
EARTHQUAKE' WILLIS
To generations of Stanford stu
dents, the bewhiskered professor
has been affectionately known as
"Earthquake" Willis. He is still
willing to wager that someday the
south pier of the Golden Gate
Bridge may be shaken down by an
earthquake.
Dr. Willis is still active and vigor
ous. His inclination, had he not
become a geologist, might have led
him to the career of an artist, and
he has pursued that interest as a
hobby throughout his world-wide
travels.
One of the world's experts on
earthquakes, he takes no chances in
his own home. His house on the
Stanford campus is 'quake-proofed,
and has specially arranged cup
boards which can shake without
breaking dishes or any of the valu
able collections he has assembled
from a lifetime of geological ex
plorations.

Ninety-year-old professor pub
lishes new book
Dr. Bailey Willis, Stanford professor of geology, emeritus, will be 90
next month, and the occasion will be marked by an accomplishment of
which few men his age can boast—he will have a new book, "A Yanqui in
Patagonia," on the bookstands.
A familiar and beloved figure on the Stanford campus, where he has

been a faculty member since 1915,
Dr. Willis is himself the "Yanqui"
who was in Patagonia, and whose
story is told in the book just pub
lished by the Stanford University
Press.
A R<.EN 11NE EXPEKIENCES
'Die lx>ok relates his experiences
from 1911 to 1915 as consulting geol
ogist to the Minister of Public
Works of Argentina.
The minister dreamed coloniza
tion, and the Yanqui's job was to
explore a remote lake and mountain
region in the Andes, where the
practical Dr. Willis located railways,
classified lands, and estimated wa
ter power.
PLANNED CITY
He planned a city to order, the
"mythical city of the Caesars," and
he tells the reader how. The city
has yet be built, but his explora
tions led to the development of a
national park which is now the re
sort of Argentines for summer and
winter sports. The colonization
which he planned is developing
through energetic Swiss settlers.
EARTHQUAKE' WILLIS
To generations of Stanford stu
dents, the bewhiskered professor
has been affectionately known as
"Earthquake" Willis. He is still
willing to wager that someday the
south pier of the Golden Gate
Bridge may be shaken down by an
earthquake.
Dr. Willis is still active and vigor
ous. His inclination, had he not
become a geologist, might have led
him to the career of an artist, and
he has pursued that interest as a
hobby throughout his world-wide
travels.
One of the world's experts on
earthquakes, he takes no chances in
his own home. His house on the
Stanford campus is 'quake-proofed,
and has specially arranged cup
boards which can shake without
breaking dishes or any of the valu
able collections he has assembled
from a lifetime of geological ex
plorations.
