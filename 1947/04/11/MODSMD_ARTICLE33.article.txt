# N.S.O.to Act As Liaison
## 
### 
N.S.O. on the Stanford campus
will act as liaison between students,
administration, student government,
and faculty by investigating prob
lems and facts given to them by
these groups or individual students
and presenting the information
gathered* to the appropriate bodies
for consideration.
N.S.O. will have the time and fa
cilities, with student support, to
help solve problems which other
wise are insufficiently investigated
due to lack of time on the part of
the bodies involved, according VÂ»
co-chairman Marilyn Sklwell. Also,
facts and solutions to similar prob
lems on other campuses will be
kept on file and will facilitate solu
tions and speedier action at Stan
ford.
STUDENTS TO LEGISLATE
The organization will be set up
with a Central Committee composed
of every student on campus. This
committee will legislate, but only
students who have actively partici
pated in N.S.O. for one quarter will
lie able to vote. Every student will
be entitled to voice his opinions and
suggestions.
Under the Central Committee, the
Steering Committee will act as the
executive authority and will be
composed of the chairman, the co
chairman, the four major commit
tee chairmen, and the treasurer and
secretary ex officio.
COMMITTEES NAMED
The four major committees will
be Regional - National, which will
handle contacts and information
with other schools; Office-manage
ment. Publicity, and Fact-finding.
This last committee will be com
posed of the five commissions de
scribed in yesterday's article, and
will deal specifically with local af
fairs.
Miss Sidwell is the present Ex
com-appointed chairman of N. 5.0.,
with Morley Thompson co-chair
man. Students may attend Central
Committee meetings or contact
these two if more information is de
sired concerning its activities.
