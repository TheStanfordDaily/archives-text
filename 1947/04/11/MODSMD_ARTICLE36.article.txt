# Faculty Members Join UN Reform Movement
## 
### 
Thirty-five members of (hp Stanford faculty have joined the Stanford
Chapter of the Citizens Committee fyr United Nations Heform, according
to B. Q. Morgan, professor of {Jjerman. The CCUNR, with Ely Culbertson
as Acting Chairman, has developed a Quota Force Plan by which they
Believe they could prevent a third world war with Russia.
This plan for the United Nations reform consists of three reforms:

(1) establishment of an effective
world authority, able to act by ma
jority vote (no veto) to prevent ag
gressive war and preparation for
aggressive war; (2) control of the
atomic threat and prevention of re
armament for aggression; and, (3)
establishment of an effective but
tyranny-proof world police force.
Under each of these reforms was
listed a number of steps to aid in
carrying out the plan.
PLANS LAID DOWN
The CCUNR expressed the belief
that the only way to stop an im
minent World War 111 is to have an
international organization strong
enough to stop it, and this commit
tee has laid down a set of steps to
accomplish this: the Quota Force
Plan.
Stanford faculty members have
joined the CCUNR believing that
(1) to do nothing means to drift
into war with Russia as soon as
Russia is ready and therefore some
thing must be done quickly; (2) the
plan proposed by the CCUNR will
be workable as soon as there are
enough supporters for it; and (3)
there is no other plan in sight which
promises anything for the immedi
ate future, according to Professor
Morgan.

Thirty-five members of (hp Stanford faculty have joined the Stanford
Chapter of the Citizens Committee fyr United Nations Heform, according
to B. Q. Morgan, professor of {Jjerman. The CCUNR, with Ely Culbertson
as Acting Chairman, has developed a Quota Force Plan by which they
Believe they could prevent a third world war with Russia.
This plan for the United Nations reform consists of three reforms:

(1) establishment of an effective
world authority, able to act by ma
jority vote (no veto) to prevent ag
gressive war and preparation for
aggressive war; (2) control of the
atomic threat and prevention of re
armament for aggression; and, (3)
establishment of an effective but
tyranny-proof world police force.
Under each of these reforms was
listed a number of steps to aid in
carrying out the plan.
PLANS LAID DOWN
The CCUNR expressed the belief
that the only way to stop an im
minent World War 111 is to have an
international organization strong
enough to stop it, and this commit
tee has laid down a set of steps to
accomplish this: the Quota Force
Plan.
Stanford faculty members have
joined the CCUNR believing that
(1) to do nothing means to drift
into war with Russia as soon as
Russia is ready and therefore some
thing must be done quickly; (2) the
plan proposed by the CCUNR will
be workable as soon as there are
enough supporters for it; and (3)
there is no other plan in sight which
promises anything for the immedi
ate future, according to Professor
Morgan.
