## 
### 
NEW YORK, April 10 (UP). â€”Jackie Roosevelt Robinson be
came the first Negro baseball player in the major leagues today
when the Brooklyn Dodgers bought his contract from the Mont
real Royals.
There appeared to be a better than even chance that the 27-
year-old former star athlete at the University of California at Los
Angeles will be at first base for the Dodgers when they open
their season against the Braves at Ebbets Field Tuesday.
"I'm thrilled," the six-foot, 180-pound Negro said. "This is
what I've been waiting for."
As he posed for pictures in his new Dodger uniform and the
Montreal players with whom he played last year rushed up to
congratulate him and wish him luck, Robinson replied:
"Thanks, I'll need it."
Clyde Sukeforth, who took over as acting manager when Leo
Durocher was suspended yesterdey by Commissioner A. B.
Chandler for one year, said he would use Robinson in the Yankee
exhibition series opening tomorrow, although he may not start
him.
"I also don't know what position he'll play, but it may be
first."
Rickey revealed that he made up his mind to bring Robinson
up this morning.
"I just snapped my fingers and made up my mind," Rickey
said, adding that his coaches and the Dodger organization heads
were unanimous in believing that Robinson should be on the
Dodgers.
