### LYNN CARMAN 
Gunning for their second straight victory in three days, Stan
ford's hustling Indians take on the invading El Toro Marines on
the Sunken Diamond tomorrow afternoon at 3:15.
The high-flying Cardinals cleared the decks for the Marines
yesterday when they rang up the "No Cash" sign against an

out eight batters and giving up nine
hits as he gained credit for the win.
His mound opponent, Ken Larkin,
unleashed a potent curve ball
against the Indians but tired in the
4 late innings when the Cardinal bats
caught up to him.
Larkin started out by whiffing the
first two Indians to face him, but
Brownson broke the ice with a
' single to 'center. Center fielder
Lloyd Merriman worked out a walk,
and then catcher Ward Walkup came
through with a single to drive
Brownson in from second with the
first run of the game.
In the third, only a sensational
unassisted double play on the part
; of Giovanetti, the Banker shortstop,
prevented the Indians from scoring
again. The dark-haired infielder
made a one-handed stab of Mac-
Graw's line drive past second and
stepped on second base to catch
Kircher, who had been on his way to
third:
Wolf started off the big seventh
by knocking out a single. Scrappy
Bill Arce laid down what was in
tended to be a sacrifice bunt, but
the over-eager Larkin scooped it up
and then made a poor throw to sec
ond to try to catch the runner. The
ball went bouncing into the outfield,
Wolf kept on going to third, and
Arce wound up on second by the
time the Bankers had done with
kicking the baseball around.
Then Kircher produced his single,
and the Indians were in the lead,
well on his way to a shut-out vic
tory last week when he handcuffed
Fullerton Junior College's batters
for four innings, but rain spoiled
his efforts and tomorrow he'll be
back, hoping to pick up right where
he left off. Dahlquist will do the
catching.

innings later the Bankers same back
to kisot the count in the sixth. Stan
for countered with two runs in the
seventh, but the visitors kept right
in the ball game by bouncing back
with a run in the first of the eighth,
making the score 3-2.
The Indians, however, kept bear
ing down in their half of the eighth,
and scored two men to boost their
lead to three runs and the score to
5-2. The Bankers made their last
ditch stand to fill the sacks in their
last turn at the plate, but the po
tential runs died on base as the
close game ended.
Coach Harry Wolter's protegees
kept the storekeepers busy as they
lashed out 13 base hits, but all of
them were singles and most of them
were scattered. Kircher collected
three of them in four trips to the
plate, and Buck Brownson knocked
out three in five times at bat. Ted
Nell and Peters both hit safely
twice.

TOUGH LUCK FOR MYERS
Indian top man, Myers, has gone
down to del eat at the hands of some
i of the sharpest racqueters on the
j Coast. Misfortune dogged him again
i last Wednesday, when he dropped a
: three-set heart-breaker to A 1 Mar
! tin of Santa Clara, 7-5, 6-8, (>-3.
Outcome of the crucial Don meet
j ing will probably be determined in

the lower brackets where no amount
oi manipulation can gustimate the
outcome. A clean sweep of the three
lower seeding matches can com
pletely nullify any early lead that
either squad should run up. Thus
any prediction of the winner would
be nigh impossible, although the
court experts have tabbed the Dons
for high honors.
DONS WELL ROUNDED
U.S.F.'s squad is a well-rounded
aggregation which doe.s not sacrifice
ability even in the lower slots. Li
kas, who leads the team as captain,
will be ably supported by Harry
Roche, Conway Catton, and a ga
laxy of net talent. Roche is the an
cient nemesis of Ted Myers of Stan
ford. as the second seeded Don elim
inated Myers from the Berkeley
intercollegiates in decisive fashion,
6-1, 7-5.
Illness on the Don team caused
cancellation of this week's warm-up
meet against Fresno State. But Li

in full force for the Indian battle.—

Harry Likas seems to be the key
| to the Don offensive, as his national
! ranking might well indicate. The
S number one Don netster was seeded
first in the Northern California in
tercollegiates at Berkeley, but in a
major upset h? was ousted from the
j semifinals by Hank Pfister of Pa
i cific. Despite the loss, Likas will
i enter tomorrow s feature match f&-
l vored to win over Ted Myers of
j Stanford.
TOUGH LUCK FOR MYERS
Indian top man, Myers, has gone
down to del eat at the hands of some
i of the sharpest racqueters on the
j Coast. Misfortune dogged him again
i last Wednesday, when he dropped a
: three-set heart-breaker to A 1 Mar
! tin of Santa Clara, 7-5, 6-8, (>-3.
Outcome of the crucial Don meet
j ing will probably be determined in

the lower brackets where no amount
oi manipulation can gustimate the
outcome. A clean sweep of the three
lower seeding matches can com
pletely nullify any early lead that
either squad should run up. Thus
any prediction of the winner would
be nigh impossible, although the
court experts have tabbed the Dons
for high honors.
DONS WELL ROUNDED
U.S.F.'s squad is a well-rounded
aggregation which doe.s not sacrifice
ability even in the lower slots. Li
kas, who leads the team as captain,
will be ably supported by Harry
Roche, Conway Catton, and a ga
laxy of net talent. Roche is the an
cient nemesis of Ted Myers of Stan
ford. as the second seeded Don elim
inated Myers from the Berkeley
intercollegiates in decisive fashion,
6-1, 7-5.
Illness on the Don team caused
cancellation of this week's warm-up
meet against Fresno State. But Li
kas and company promise to be out
in full force for the Indian battle.—
