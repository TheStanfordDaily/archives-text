# To Iron Out Conflict
## 
### 
A student-administration forum was pro
posed in an editorial last week. Participating
in the forum, we suggested, would be four or
five student officers and four or five adminis
tration officials who would get together once
every two weeks and discuss problems and
questions that come up regarding both student
and administration policies and points of view.
The need for such a forum exists because of
lack of cooperation and understanding be
tween the administration and the students
â– 
and the apparent tendency for each group to
distrust the other. There would be less con
flict if the two groups could get together and
learn each other's policies. By having four
01 five in each group, you would get rid of the
possibility that false information could be

given out, as group members would serve as
a check on each other, and you would get a
variety of viewpoints from each group.
The idea will be presented to Cardinals
Tuesday for their consideration. This group
seems the logical organization to start such
a plan, one of their aims being to promote any
campus activity in need of assistance. The
work involved in setting up a forum should
be very little once Cardinals has determined
if there is support from administration and
student officers.
Since student-administration friction must
be done away before we can pull together for
the interests of Stanford as a whole, the pos
sibilities of a forum should not be overlooked.
