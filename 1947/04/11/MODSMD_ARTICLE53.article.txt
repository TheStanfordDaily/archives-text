# BULL SESSION
## 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
No doubt most of you have heard of Mangini's
Barn, although I trust that none of vou have ever
been there. Moreover, the Ob-Senior Class picnic
will be held there this Sunday afternoa. so everybody
will get a chance to look the place over.
That is, the co-chairmen of the senior committee
call it a senior picnic. Actually they've gone and
invited the whole campus. I have never been to
Mangini's, of course, but I presume that the barn, no
matter how large, will be rather crowded when filled
with over 7,000 persons.
One line of the publicity blurb put out by the

committee is obviously designed to
attract favorable attention. This
particular wingding, it is said, will
not wring any more blood out of J
the turnips walking up and down I
over the campus. In other words, Jj
it's free.
That sounds great—only some
body slipped a joker into the deck.
No admission will be charged, but
the already overburdened rough
will be forced to dig down deep

and extract enough cash out of his aching wallet to
pay for his own refreshments; "liquid in nature,"
tlu-v called it. That means buying for any stray
co-ed who crowds in for a free drink.
Obviously all this talk about the senior picnic

being "free" is just a come-on for the suckers, like
the barker outside a side-show tent. Undoubtedly
Mr. Mangini is using the committee to attract cus
tomers.
Another thing: the committee threatens to impose
a strenuous regimen of volleyball, baseball, and foot
ball on all who attend. There should be some other
way to pass the time amicably without running the
risk of broken bones and dangling tongues. The
threat, I fear, is serious; in the Daily story of last
Tuesday these activities were mentioned twice. Ob
viously they are a .sacred cow of the committee.
Just one final point and I shall desist. It has been
announced that the picnic will be a no-date affair.
Sounds great—only I have been to these no-date af
fairs before. The usual combinations show up; they
arrive together, spend the whole time, together, and
leave together. Of course it's not a date, you under
stand; it's a no-date, a new word for the very same
thing.
Incidentally, a prominent 8.M.0.C. (for Baldest
Man on Campus) wants to know why it is that all
the senior girls he's ever heard of are named "B. J."
It confuses him no end.
If you have followed my line of reasoning you
can see plainly that the so-called senior picnic has
been grossly misrepresented. It's just another picnic.
However, I am a senior. As much as I dislike picnics
generally, and beer drinking in particular, I shall go.
I owe it to my class.
