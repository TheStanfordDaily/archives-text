To the Editor:
This is to express what I think is a legitimate
"gripe." I am referring to the recent action of the
Department of Athletics, whereby student golf cards
can no longer be used on Saturday morning. The
right to play on Saturday afternoons, Sundays, and
holidays had already been denied to students.
Under the new set-up, a student who purchased a
golf card can play on week days for 75c (it was 50c
prior to this quarter) or can play on a Saturday, Sun
day, or holiday for $2.50.
Theoretically, at least, Stanford Golf Course is a
university course, and one on which you might ex
pect that students would be offered privileges at least
equal to those of an outsider. Such is not the case,
however, as any student who plays golf at the Stan
ford course can tell you. Actually it is nothing short
of a private course, upon which the club members
(from Palo Alto and vicinity) have practically all the
privileges. Why is it that on a university course,
members of the student body can't be offered privi
leges at least equal to those of club members, who
have no connection whatever with the University?
Granted, the club members are a source of income,
but then aren't the students also? Tli.it $45(9.50 we
pay for tuition, plus the $15.00 we pay for a golf
card "ain't hay." regardless of what view the Depart
ment of Athletic" may take of it.

Last quarter a petition was signed by a large num
ber of Stanford students asking that only students
be allowed to play on Stanford Golf Course. The
petition, of course, was turned down, and instead of
students being granted more privileges, the price
of a golf card was raised from $10 to $15 and students
were no longer allowed to play on Saturday morn
ings. As a matter of fact, the idea of keeping club
members and others off the course entirely was
going too far, in my opinion.
Club memberships should be permitted. I do not
believe, however, that there is any good reason why
such club members and members pf the student body
should not be accorded at least EQUAL privileges.
By that, I mean that students should be permitted to
play on Saturdays and Sundays, and that if club
members are allowed to sign up for a starting time
days ahead, that students should be granted the
same privilege.
How about asking the Department of Athletics, or
whoever else is responsible for this unnecessary dis
crimination. just what, if any reason there is for it:
It seems as though the least we are entitled to is some
sort of explanation for this new policy even if our
petitions and letters arc not accorded any affirmative
action.

day, or holiday for $2.50.
Theoretically, at least, Stanford Golf Course is a
university course, and one on which you might ex
pect that students would be offered privileges at least
equal to those of an outsider. Such is not the case,
however, as any student who plays golf at the Stan
ford course can tell you. Actually it is nothing short
of a private course, upon which the club members
(from Palo Alto and vicinity) have practically all the
privileges. Why is it that on a university course,
members of the student body can't be offered privi
leges at least equal to those of club members, who
have no connection whatever with the University?
Granted, the club members are a source of income,
but then aren't the students also? Tli.it $45(9.50 we
pay for tuition, plus the $15.00 we pay for a golf

Last quarter a petition was signed by a large num
ber of Stanford students asking that only students
be allowed to play on Stanford Golf Course. The
petition, of course, was turned down, and instead of
students being granted more privileges, the price
of a golf card was raised from $10 to $15 and students
were no longer allowed to play on Saturday morn
ings. As a matter of fact, the idea of keeping club
members and others off the course entirely was
going too far, in my opinion.
Club memberships should be permitted. I do not
believe, however, that there is any good reason why
such club members and members pf the student body
should not be accorded at least EQUAL privileges.
By that, I mean that students should be permitted to
play on Saturdays and Sundays, and that if club
members are allowed to sign up for a starting time
days ahead, that students should be granted the
same privilege.
How about asking the Department of Athletics, or
whoever else is responsible for this unnecessary dis
crimination. just what, if any reason there is for it:
It seems as though the least we are entitled to is some
sort of explanation for this new policy even if our
petitions and letters arc not accorded any affirmative
action.

This is to express what I think is a legitimate
"gripe." I am referring to the recent action of the
Department of Athletics, whereby student golf cards
can no longer be used on Saturday morning. The
right to play on Saturday afternoons, Sundays, and
holidays had already been denied to students.
