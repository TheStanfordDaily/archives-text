# Pepper Declines to Head Wallace's 'Third Party'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 13 (UP).—
Senator Claude Pepper, D., Fla., to
day rejected former Vice-Presideht
Henry A. Wallace's invitation to
bead a third party and pledged he
would stay in the Democratic fold
as long as it is "truly liberal."
Wallace extended the invitation
from London where he boldly de
nounced President Truman's for
eign policy as "ruthless imperial
ism" and broke away from Demo
cratic ranks to propose a third party
that would try and wield the bal
ance of power in the 1948 presiden
tial election.
Pepper gave his answer iti a tele
phonic statement to the United
Press from Miami, Fla.
In his statement Pepper said:
"It. is very kind and complimen
tary of Mr. Wallace, but I have in
sistently advocated to all liberals it
would be a grave mistake to make
any effort to organize a third party.
"I expect to support and work for
the Democratic nominees in the
general election. However, if the
Democratic party refuses to perform
its mission to serve the people as
against the special interests, it
would not be Henry Wallace or
Claude Pepper who would start a
third party movement, but the peo
ple themselves."
Wallace took his tolerance for
Russia and global "new deal" cam
paign to millions of Britons over
the British Broadcasting Corpora
tion and once again accused his own
country of using it.s immense power
and wealth for "strategic and mili
tary purposes."
Since he followed the !) o'clock
news —an institution on BBC—he
had about the largest potential au
dience it is possible to get on the
state-monopolized radio. He made
a public appearance at Liverpool
during the day and accused his con
gressional criticism of assuming the
world already is at war again.
He said the "only justification for
charging me with treason is the as
sumption that the world is at war."
He spoke to 2.000 students and
members of the Liverpool United
Nations Association..
"I am a patriotic American," he
said. "If the world was at war, I
could not have said what I have said
in England.
"The use of the word 'treason' in
dicates that in the minds of some
people, the world is at war. That
frame of mind is precisely what I
am trying to combat."
President Truman, returning to
the capital tonight after a round
trip flight back home to visit his
ailing mother, gave a clipped "No
comment" in response to reporters'
questions on what he planned to do
about. Wallace's outspoken criticism
of his foreign policy.
