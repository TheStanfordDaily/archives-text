# Spring Show Signups Continue for Chorus
## 
### 
"Fourteen tremendous songs, seven
of them chorus numbers, and no
chorus. I hat is the situation facing
Ram's Head in thr May Ifi and 17
production of "It's a Deal." as
plained by Bob Ashley, Spring Show
director.
Chorus signups were definitely
wanting, he said in summing up last
week s tryouts. Further signup pe
riods have been scheduled for today
and tomorrow, between 2 and f>
p.m. and 7 and 10 p.m. in the Ram's
Head room.
Ashley fears the word "singers"
may have sounded too professional
lor campus warblers and thus held
back interested persons. "Willing
ness to work and enthusiasm for
the show's success arc what wc are
looking for," he said.
I here is a lot of fun to putting on
â€¢i show of this nature, he said, and re
hearsals offer students good oppor
tunities to meet brother and sister
Stanfordites.
