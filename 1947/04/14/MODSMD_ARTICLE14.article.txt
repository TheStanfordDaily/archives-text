CAIRO, Egypt, April KJ (UP).-
The Reynolds Round-the-World
Bombshell roared off the runway
here tonight with her nose pointed
toward Karachi, India, her crew sot
on a globe-girdling record, and a
gale of .smashed flying marks already
behind her.
Hounded by bad luck but blessed
by good weather, the Bombshell
was 21 hours and 57 minutes out of
New York and about a third of the
way around the world when she
took off at 10:08 p.m. (.'):08 p.m.
EST).
A flat, tire on the nose wheel
kept, the silver, blue-trimmed plane
here for two hours and 16 min
utes, just as a bad radio had ground
ed her for 77 minutes in Paris.
"We're practically there already,"
grinned Milton Reynolds. 54-yar
old millionaire owner of the plane.
The Bombshell already had set
new, unofficial speed records from
New York to Gander, .'I hours flat;
from Gander to Shannon, Ireland,
j hours and 17 minutes; Gander to
Paris, 7 hours flat; and Paris to
Cairo, (> hours and .'5B minutes.
