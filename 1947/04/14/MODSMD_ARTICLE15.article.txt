I the Soviet zone fear the Russians

j duct of Soviet occupation troops in

I reel."
This conclusion was reached by
this correspondent after a five-day
tour of the northern part of the
i Russian zone the first extended
j tour granted by the Russians in

There is no "reign of terror" vis

I fear the Russians.
Germans resent any occupation
forcc. They have been taught to
hate and fear the Russians through
12 years of Hitlcrism. Some drunk
en and some criminal elements in
the Soviet army—they have some,
the same as the American and any
other army—keep on stirring up the
Germans' fears.

policeman in the oily of Stralsund
whispered. The difficulty came, ho
admitted, from drunken Soviet sol
diers who, like t licit* American

rob Germans.
"Oh, those Russians!" a woman hI
a youth dance commented. Asked
to specify her complaints, she said:
"Well, their conduct has b"en
quite correct hut they sometimes
walk into dances like this and if
vou don't have your identity papers
they lock you up all night."
