"With the deadline for nominations less than 2-1 hours away,
only three men have signified their intention to run for ASSU
president and there are seven offices for which there are no
candidates at all," Gordon Ness, election board head stated last
night.
Robert Lewis of the Village is the latest presidential candi-

date. Bill McPherson of El Campo
eating club and Encina Sponsor Tom
Mart/lofT announced their intentions
to run earlier last week. So far,
there have been no nomination,
from the Row.
FEW WOMEN
"The surprising thing is that there
are so few women submitting peti
tions," said Carl Burke, Excom''.
election chairman. "Usually there
are more women than men running
for office. Unless there are many
more new petitions turned in tomor
row, it seems to me that this election
indicates more than usual student
apa thy."
The women's nominating board
was defended by Bubs Wilbur, Ex
com representative from Lagunita,
who declared that she thought the
system worked very well in the
majority of instances.

a men's nominating board similar
to the women's was brought up in
Excom several weeks ago, but th*i.
no further action was taken.

all offices," said Ness. "There are
only two or three persons running
for the majority of positions that
are open." Burkt, who was election
board head last spring quarter,
stated that at tluit time approximate
ly I.'IO candidates ran.
