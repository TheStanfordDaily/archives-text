# Eating Clubs Rush Frosh
## 
### 
Toyon will hold an open house
Wednesday for those freshmen who
want to join eating clubs, according
to Norm Swanson, Inter-Club rush
ing chairman. The men will have a
chance to look over the hall and
get acquainted with the eating club
members, Swanson said.
Toyon President Bill McPherson
and Inter-Club Council President
Fred Struck will give short talks,
and movies of the Stanford crew in
action are tentatively scheduled for
the evening.
Each eating club except Breakers
will have a table in the Toyon
lounge, Swanson explained, where
club members will hold forth to
give out information about the clubs
and to answer aay questions the
visiting freshmen might have. Also,
sign-lip lists for eating a meal with
a club will be available at the
tables.
Later, postcards will be sent to
those men signing up, inviting them
to a specific meal with the club in
which they are interested.
Arrangements for those men who
are not able to attend the open
house will be announced later,
Swanson said.
