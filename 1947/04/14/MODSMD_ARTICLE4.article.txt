# Beirne Asks Truman's Aid
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 13 (UP). -
Joseph Beirne, president <>112 the
striking National Federation of
Telephone Workers, said tonight he
would appeal to President Truman
to bring about renewed negotiations
to end the week - old nationwide
telephone walkout.
Meanwhile, in San Francisco Ibe
lower volume of calls on Sunday
resulted in an improvement in (lie
handling of telephone trallic today,
despite the absence from their jobs
, of all members of the CIO American
Communications Association in sup
port of the strike.
NO GOVERNMENT SEIZURE
Beirne said his appeal would not
include a request, the government
seize the telephone system because
the union's general counsel had ad
vised him the government no longer
has legal seizure powers.
He said he would merely ask the
President to use his good offices in
an attempt to bring about renewed
negotiations between the NFTW and
the American Telephone and Tele
graph Company.
His statement coincided with the
return of the President from a flying
visit to Missouri. Mr. Truman said
he had no plans to discuss the strike
tonight.
NEGOTIATIONS STALK-MATH!)
Negotiations on nearly all fronts
appeared stalemated but there still
was no indication the White House
planned to intervene.
Labor Department officials held
"exploratory" talks with represen
tatives of the 801 l system and the
striking National Federation of Tel
ephone Workers in their search for
a basis for new contract negotia
tions. But they reported no prog
ress and were frankly less optimistic
about a settlment than at any time
since the walkout began.
Beirne praised the Labor Depart
ment for its week-long conciliation
efforts, but said Mr. Truman may be
able to act "more conclusively."
On the West Coast. Lyle Brown,
division manager of the Pacific Tel
ephone and Telegraph Company,
said all ACA members were staying
away fron picketed offices in five
Western stales.
In San Francisco, however, office
forces were nearly one-third of nor
mal, and while only emergency calls
j were being handled through long
distance switchboards, some regular
calls were being completed in ad
dition to emergency calls in local
manual exchanges.
In the East Bay area offices, forces
were one-half of normal and all
calls were taken care of, Brown re
ported. Northern California and
Nevada reported about. (50 per cent
of normal working staffs on the job.
