# Indian Nine Pounds Toro Marines, 13-3
## 
### 
A big fifth inning broke the backs of the El Toro Marines and
Stanford's Indians coasted the rest of the way to a decisive 13
to 3 victory last Saturday afternoon on the Sunken Diamond.
At the same time, the Indian junior varsity suffered a 3 to 1
defeat at the hands of Menlo Junior College on the adjacent

nosh field, giving the Farm diamond
performers an even split in the two
games played over the weekend.
BRONCOS TOMORROW
After a week of non-conference
action, the rolling Red Machine
swings back into C.1.8.A. play to
morrow afternoon when it plays
host to Santa Clara's rebounding
Broncos, who were soundly thumped
by California in their conference
opener Saturday, 8 to 4.
Saturday's debacle started out as
an evenly matched but freely scor
ing ball game as both teams worked
the opposing hurlers for hit after
hit. But the wild pitches, the
passed balls and the walks the El
Toro battery insisted on giving the
Indians completely changed the
complexion of the game and emp
tied the stands of most of the fans
by the seventh frame.
li nothing else, the Marines gave
the spectators the most awesome
display of straight concentrated
power hitting seen in the Sunken
Diamond this season when they
bunched two long triples and two
fugles in the third inning to score
three runs. But the barrage ended
a quickly as it began and the Mar
ines never again threatened; they
were too l'ar behind to make it
worth while after that.
The three Marine hurlers allowed
Stanford eight hits while they ac
cumulated seven. But the service
hurlers walked 17 Indians, and that
was the game right there. The Ma
rine hitters just couldn't make up
lor the wildness of their pitchers.
PLATLAND ALL THE WAY
Pitcher Dick Flatland went the
route for the Cardinals, and except
lor some tightrope walking in the
second and third innings, he had
little trouble in gaining credit for
tlie win.
The visitors gave an inkling of
what was to come in the first inning
when they allowed one Stanford
run to score, putting the Indians
into the lead they never lost. After
two were gone, shortstop Buck
Brownson worked out a walk. He
went all the way to third on a wild
pitch, and then moments later came
cruising home on a passed ball.
El Toro seriously threatened in
the second inning, but a sensational
one-handed stop of a single by
Brownson prevented a run from
coring from second with two out
and two men on. The shortened
-ingle loaded the bases, but Flat
land got out of the jam by forcing
Seipp, El Toro's pitcher, to ground
to second for a l'orce-out play. |
In their half of the second, the
Indians pushed across five runs on 1
only lour hits to go into a 6-0 lead.'
Ted Nell walked and went to sec
ond on a wild pitch. Clyde Ding
felder got another walk to put two j
men on. then Benny Cardinalli laid
down a nifty bunt and beat it out for '
a hit when Seipp couldn't make up \

long run as Wienart scored. Lemons
beat out a hit to keep the rally alive,
but Flatland settled down to retire
the next two men on a strikeout and
a flyball. He had no trouble from
that point on.
That three-run rally by El Toro
was the last offensive gesture the
visitors made during the afternoon,
and when the Indians galloped home
with six more runs in the fifth, the
game was as good as over.
During the Cardinal explosion
in the fifth, Brownson slashed out
a liner to center field which went
under the Marine outfielder to the
fence for an inside-the-park home
run. It drove in three runs, with
one out, after Dingfelder had already
scored a run. Stanford added an
other marker to the score on three
walks and an infield out, and the
top-heavy score went to 12-3 as the
inning ended.
The Indians added another run in
the seventh, but it was anti-climax.

his mind where to throw the ball.
Flatland struck out, but Arce
singled to score two runs and put
C.irdinalli on third. A 1 Kircher
came through with a single for an
other Farm run. Then Brownson
hit a ball to the first baseman, and
everybody wound up safely when
the play went to home instead of to
first base -Arce didn't attempt to
come home and fooled the Marine
strategy.
VIERRIMAN SINGLES
Merriman, with the bases loaded,
dumped a single into short right
and two more runs came home. The
Marines finally put the fire out by
ending in Tally, a left hander, who
lorced the next two batters to fly
out and ended the inning.
But the Marines hadn't given up,
yet. They roared hack in the third
with a long-blow hitting attack
which for a while had Flatland buf
faloed. Their leadoff man, Robinson,
powdered a pitch deep into left
center, and Shirley drove him home
with a single. Then Wienart, El
Turo first baseman, hit the right field
fence on the fly for another triple,
not her run.and the third straight
hit off Flatland.
Anderson unlimbered another long
Mow into the outer pastures, but
Merriman hauled it down after a

football and baseball star, who

tory over Fl Toro Maiincs last
Saturday.
