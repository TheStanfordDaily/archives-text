Saturday's Angell Field track meet between Stanford and
San Jose state turned out to be a rough afternoon for the Indians,
who suffered their first defeat of the season, 78-53.
For a while the two teams fought on even terms. After 7 of the
15 events had been run off, San Jose's Spartans held a not-too-

comfortable 33-30 lead. And then,
with a resounding thud, the roof
fell in on Stanford.
SPARTANS AWAY
It was San Jose a clean sweep in
the discus, first and second in the
220. first and second in the javelin,
first and second in the broad jump,
first in the two-mile, first in the
low hurdles—as the Spartans won
going away.
Despite San Jose's virtual strangle
hold on the sprints, Stanford came
very close to holding its own in the
track events, racking up 37 points
to the opposition's 40. The field
events proved to he the Indian's
Waterloo, San Jose amassing a 38 to
10 advantage in the "heave and leap'
activities.
Larry Hoff, Captain A 1 Snyder, and
Bill Larson were Stanford's only in
dividual blue-ribbon winners. Hoff
scampered to victory in the 440 at
49.0, leading two teammates—Frank
Johnson and A 1 Wilkins —to the tape
for the home team's one clean sweep
of the day.
SNYDER ANNEXES FIRST
Snyder won by a deep breath over
the Spartan's Jack Passey in th/c
high hurdles, and then lost the low
hurdle decision by the same mnragin
to speedy Bill Rhyne, of San Jose.
Rhyne was clocked at the fast time
of 24.0.
Larson captured top honors in the
pole vault, althlough he failed to
improve over his 13' effort of the
April 5 meet.
George Grimes, Stanford's pride
and joy in the 880. finished second
behind San Jose's lanky Thelno
Knowles in the half-mile. Grimes led
the field for the first BGO yards but
gave way to Knowles' long-striding
gather in the race for the tape.
DOUBLE WINNER
Woody Linn, 285 pound san Jose
weight man, was the only double
winner of the day. He got off a
48' 9'4 " heave in the shot put. best
ing Stanford's Otis Chandler by
slightly more than a foot, and led
the Spartan discus sweep with
147' 6'.'
