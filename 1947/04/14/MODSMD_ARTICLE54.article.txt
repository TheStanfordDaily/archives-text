## 
### GORDON LEVY 
Paced by Bud Richter's trium
phant low hurdle victory and a bevy
ot seconds and thirds when they
were needed most, Sigma Chi an
nexed the annual intramural track
test on Angell Field Friday after
noon with a total of 24*:» points, just
barely nosing out Delta Tau Delta
which amassed 24 digits even.
The Sigma Chi title was not de- 1
cided until the final event of the 1
day—the 880-yard relay—when the I
two anchor men, Len Kellogg of j
Phi Psi and Richter of the Sigs. hat - j
tied down the homestretch. Richter 1
wilted in the linal burst, but his
second place was good enough to
nab the title.
URADSIIAW SCORES 13
Jimmy Bradshaw, running under
Delt colors, nabbed high point hon
ors for the afternoon with a flurry
of 13 points—seconds in the broad
jump and 220-yard dash, a third in
the low barriers, and a fourth in
the 100.
Following the champion Sigma
Chi's and runner-up Delts, were
the D.K.E. with 17*4; Phi Gumma
Delta, 16; Alpha Delts, 15; Kappa
Sigma. 13; Sigma Nu, and Zfcta
Psi. 12. Nineteen other teams fin
ished with less than 12 points.
Comparatively good marks — for j

the untrained, barefoot mural
youngsters at least were registered
in both sprints as Tug Neville of
the Alpha Delts copped victories in
both the 100 and 220. He was
clocked at 10.8 seconds in the
century and sizzled down the fur
long in 24.1. Boh Anderson of
swimming and football fame gar
nered a twin win during the pro
ceedings by sailing out 21 ft. 2 in.
in the broad jump and then, with
out even taking a breath, tossing the
javelin 157 feet for two very noble
efforts.
Johnny Wallace, representing 210
Village, bounced around the 880 in
2:14.2 seconds with free-wheeling
ease, followed by Johnny Davis of
Sigma Chi.
HORTH TAKES 440
John Horth, another 210 Village
thinclad, gathered in the most ap
plause of the day with a fairly rap
id 50.2 quarter-mile. Horth had to
overcome a difficult handicap in
emerging from the unweildy pack
before the turn, but he succeeded
and sailed home the winner.
Richter's 27 flat hurdle effort, and
Van Johns' 17.9 high stick perform
ance were fairly decent under the
circumstances, as was Gene Ma

thias' 40-ft. 5½-in. shove with the
16-pound iron pellet.
EVEN TWO-MILE
Surprisingly enough, five runners
staggered around the two - mile
course. John White ol the Dekes fi
nally winning out in the soap opera
time of 12:30. Mat Wallace ol A.T.O.
did a better job of it in the mile
event, turning in a 5:17.2 clocking
with the Kappa Sigs' Burdick close
behind.
