## Cardinals, What Next? 
### 
Cardinals, working under provisions of the
A.S.S.U. Constitution, acts as an organization
to "promote campus welfare." If Cardinals
are going to justify their existence as a work
ing committee of Stanford men and women
who are attempting to better the welfare of
the students, they must look ahead.
Justly or unjustly the most recent criticism
of Cardinals has been that they spend most of
their time selecting new members. Perhaps
university life at Stanford might be made a
little more pleasant if this organization would
show more interest in problems arising from
lack of student understanding.
The increased enrollment at Stanford pre
sents certain problems that have not appeared
before.
The Reserve Book Room has become a jam
of students trampling on each other to check
out books. Consequently, university authori
ties have had to take steps which work hard
ships on students working in the Reserve
Book Room as well as those using the room
for study.
Student body cards have to be shown to
check out a book. Perhaps if Cardinals had

taken some positive action in acquainting the
students with the problems that exist here this
situation would not have had to result.
The business of Cellar walkouts could be
taken in hand by a committee of Cardinals
which could be formed to investigate the
problem.
With the increased number of cars now on
campus the parking problem has become one
of real concern to students from the Village
who cannot find a place to park. Cardinals
could investigate this problem also.
The Red Cross drive was successful under
the leadership of Cardinals. This quarter's
Convalescent Home Drive will be directly
under the sponsorship of Cardinals. But there
are everyday situations which arise that need
study and assistance of a student committee,
as well as these drives.
If Cardinals are going to continue as an
active committee of student leaders they
should meet this challenge.
Otherwise Cardinals will simply become
another Stanford honor society whose sole
reason for existence is that it is composed of
students who were once active in campus
politics.â€” D.K.
