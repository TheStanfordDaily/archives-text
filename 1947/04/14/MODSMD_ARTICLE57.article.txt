Stanford women are well oiled these days. And
they're out flat on their backs. But they're not vio
lating (he Fundamental Standard. They're sunbath
ing.
Sunbathing isn't .really the lazy, luxurious occu
pation it seems to be at first glance. Getting the
mahogany color that sets you off from the palefaces
around here is a process requiring the fortitude, skill,
and patience of a chef supervising'the roasting of a
Christmas turkey.
In the tirst place you need a good bird. If you're
old and tough you won't turn brown no matter how
long you stay out. If you're too young and tender
you'll burn at the first touch of sun. If you're one of
tlu anemic-looking hot-house birds you'll just tan
in spots. Some people like freckles.
The actual cooking can be done in the closed
oven on the roof of your house or at the open ovens
on the beach. For a quick turn between your ten

and twelve o'elocks, the roof seems more convenient.
First, you clean the bird in the shower and strip to
the least possible coverage. That isn't very much.
Then you round up bottles, jars, towels, pillows,
cigarettes, matches, decks of cards, and books. (Pre
tending to read makes you look like you're such an
old hand at this that you can cook with only one eye
on the bird.)
You trot up to the roof and find a few unoccu
pied inches between inert bodies and stretch out.
Then, oil up till you shine like a greased bird over
a hot flame. You feel like one, too.
Frequent turning and re-oiling insures an even
browning. The sun really takes it out of you. As you
get weaker and weaker you feel less and less like
getting up and going to your twelve o'clock. By a
quarter to two you're really out of it. You're done.
Do this every day for a couple of weeks and you'll
be the envy of all your friends, if they recognize you.
