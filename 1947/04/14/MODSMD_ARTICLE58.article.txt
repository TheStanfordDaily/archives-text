### CECIL ROSPAW 
Two weekends ago a little drama was enacted
in Sacramento (capital of this state for those who
are interested) which was, in import, one of the big
ger things which ever took place in that city, but has
received little, or no, publicity.
Wo of Stanford know that housing is not all that
it should be. We know of people who wish to be
married, or would like to live off campus for better
studying facilities, and through them we know that
low-cost housing is not available, and is not being
made available.
In the last two quarters we have watched a new
drive-in being built, and today many of us enjoy the
food at Marquard's. We have watched the comple
tion of a new theater in the same city. We have
seen one-quarter of the store fronts remodeled, and
many new stores constructed in Palo Alto. A few
new homes have been built, but not enough of any
type, or especially in the low-cost class, to ease the
situation.
What happened in Sacramento? Some I!, 000 peo
ple, mostly veterans, descended on the Capitol from
all over the state to meet in session with the Legis
lature and present thir problem.
These people were worried about housing. Most
of them had served in the armed forces and had
seen what American production could do in the
time of "emergency." They had felt the support of
this great country in the equipment that had flowed
to every battle line.
Now they are again civilians. But no houses are
forthcoming. It is easy for a person who lives in a
house to feel that the housing shortage is just a
"vicious rumor' started by "some radicals."
Those people 1 saw up there weren't radicals, yet.
They were just a bunch of-guys and gals who didn't
have the $10,000 to build a home under present
conditions. And they are tired of living in garages
and ;ittics, paying too much for too little, raising their
children in the wrong atmosphere, and living with
Mom and Dad.

The mass meeting they held was well conducted,
the speakers were good, and surprisingly enough
there were no riots or demonstrations. They asked
for time in the Assembly and Senate to present their
plea. It was granted. A very able speaker was elected
from the group. And for the first time in the history
of the California State Legislature an outside speak
er was escorted to the stand and given the privi
leges of the floor.
They asked for $1,000,000 to be granted to the
State Housing Authority under existing FHA laws,
for $35,000 to be appropriated to purchase existing
Army barracks, etc., and that the laws relating to
racial covenants now on the books be enforced.
Reaction of the Legislature was more than favor
able to this well-controlled and ably represented
group. Bills are now being presented to cover their
wishes. It will be interesting to see how far the
wishes of the people carry.
One dangerous sign was noted. These people
were dissatisfied. The Communists were there with
their literature. Communism does breed on dissatis
faction. We in thus country who today arc suppos
edly so worried about "reds" should wake up to the
fact that people like those who gathered in Sacra
mento find it easy to laugh at the propaganda, today.
But another year of dissatisfaction and they might
start reading the Daily Worker more avidly. Here
is a chance for those who arc sincerely afraid of
Communism to inject an inoculation to stop the
spread of the disease.
This is an "emergency," or "crisis" if you wish.
Houses are needed by all classes and in all sections
of the state. This country and state has the ability
and the materials to build homes. But it will take
some co-ordination and co-operation. Wouldn't it.
lx> belter to start worrying more about why a person
is a Communist, rather than who is a Communist?
And bv finding out the "why" maybe we can start
from there and build for a stronger and surer post
war America, internally.
