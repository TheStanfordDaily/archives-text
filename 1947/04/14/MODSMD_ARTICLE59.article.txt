(All letter.i should he addressed to the editor,

it is desirable they be short and to the point.)

To the Editor:
As a staunch and loyal son of the languishing
Republic, I was duly shocked and astonished by the
stupefaction that was Wednesday's Daily's potential
expose, or at least, report on same. Recovering my
self, however. I saw at once that now is the time for
caution.
Since we are now under national suspicion, and
since the campus will soon be the scene of innumer
able "ah-HA!-ing" congressional investigating com
mittees, and since things get started so easily—don't
you agree that we'd better play safe and begin re
telling to each season's competitive sport's team
as "The Big BLUE Machine," or something?

To the Editor:
In the "History 1947" column of the Stanford
Daily, dated April 0. 1947. there appears the follow,
ing statement:
"Traditionally the British have supported 'the
strong' and not a 'democratic' government, in the
countries of the Near East. This is the policy that
had her supporting the Moslem Government of the
Turkish Sultan against the uprising of the Greek
peoples 120 years ago."
I should like to point out that on October 20, 1827,
a British fleet under Sir Edward Codrington helped
to defeat the Turks at the famous naval battle of
Navarino. Perhaps the historian would elaborate on
his statement. Gordon M. Petersen
