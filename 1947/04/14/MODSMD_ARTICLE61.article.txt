# Post Office Can't Handle Business, Callahan Says
## 
### JACKIE MILNOR 
"Stanford's post oflice Ls completely inadequate for the immense amount
of business it handles." This is the opinion of John J. Callahan, superin
tendent of the University Post Oflice.
He estimates the incoming letters at 12.000 to 15,000 daily, and outgoing
at 8,000 a day, six days a week. There are approximately 1.000 outgoing

packages and GOO incoming daily.
All this mail is handled by 20
men: 17 at the campus office and
three at the Village. The main
problem is lack of space, although
the post office has been enlarged
twice since it was built. To he sat
isfactory. the post office should have
three times as much room as at
present, Mr. Callahan believes.
Mr. Callahan has been at Stanford
since 1926. At that time, the post
office was an independent branch of
the United States Post Oflice, an
swerable only to the United States.
Since 1930 it has been an independ
ent branch of the Palo Alto post of
fice under Ralph W. Evans, postmas
ter of Palo Alto.
Stanford Village is Unit 1 of the
campus office. All its mail is first
handled by the main office and is
sent to the Village by a special mes
senger service. It holds the same re- :
lation to the campus office that the
campus office does to Palo Alto.
The affable lady behind the gen
oral delivery window is Mrs. Ge
neva S. Wormley. She claims that
she can recognize almost all of the \
800 students who come to her win
dow each day. "I've only been
caught three times," she says. Stu
dents arc not allowed to get others' j
mail, either at general delivery or
in the boxes, unless a written au- j
thorization is on file.
She has little trouble with vet
erans receiving their G.I. checks.
Sometimes the men don't call for i
their checks within 10 days, and the i
checks are sent back to Washington.
Sometimes the notices of the checks'
arrival are lost in the fraternity
houses to which they are sent. "But, !
on the whole, the men co-operate j
very well," she says.
The mail is put in the boxes fol- !
lowing each train. Three mails I
come in before 8 a.m., after which it
comes in at 8:30 a.m., 9:30 a.m., 10:30
a.m., 1:30 p.m., and 5 p.m. However,
sometimes it takes an hour for the I
mail to be put in the boxes.
Assistant to Mr. Callahan is j
Claude Wheeler, clerk in charge. He ;
sees that the oflice work goes |

| smoothly, handling everything ex
| cept the finances which Mr. Calla
han does personally.
Mr. Wheeler has been clerk in
' charge since 1928. From 1942 to
February of 194G he was in the
Army as superintendent of the post
I office at Camp Stoneman, California.

Mr. Wheeler and Mr. Callahan ask
for co-operation from the students
in order to give the best possible
service. They offer the following
suggestions:
1. Have all mail and magazines
addressed either to General Deliv
ery or a box number.
2. Have mail sent directly to
Stanford University, not Palo Alto.
3. When leaving for a long vaca
tion, instruct the post office as to
disposal of daily papers and ipaga
zinos. They will destroy them for
you. but unless instructed different
ly, they must hold them until your
return.
