## 
### 
Branner Hall will remain a wo
men's dormitory next year, accord
ing to Dean of Students John Stal
nakcr.
Stalnaker, back from a week's j
trip to New York for a College En
trance Examination Board meeting,
stated that Stanford Village is ade- ;
quately housing all male students !
at Stanford.
"Jf we were to give Branner back j
to the men now," commented Stal
naker, "we would only have to re- j
strict, the number of women at Stan- t
ford even further and raise the !
ratio."
Stalnaker said that Branner is
slated for return to the men in "a
year or two" since it was designed
as a men's hall and is on the men's
â– side of the campus.
"There is no reason for a change j
of policy right now." said Stalnaker. j
'"I he main problem is to take care j
of the persons who are already here, j
We can beat that problem by keep- j
ing temporarily Branner a women's j
residence."
Branner will continue to house!
freshman and transfer women.
