With a last-minute flurry of nomination petitions, 78 students

Although fear was expressed in some quarters that a few
offices might be left vacant or with two oi three persons running.

only our Excom district (XI, Vil

number of offices have only two or
Hirer- candidates.
The expected "apathy in the
election" was certainly absent
from the interest in and number
of candidates running for A.S.S.C.
president. The three candidates,

been augmented by nine addition -

Carl Burke, Kappa Sigma and En
cina sponsor; Dave Davidson, Phi

Tau Delta: Robert Long, Phi Signvi
Kappa; Eugene Mitguard, Alpha
Delta Phi; Joseph Pickering. Phi
Delta Theta; Morley Thompson,
Beta Theta Pi; aiul Nirl Allen, Al
pha Tau Omega.
Allan Forbes is now Toyon's sec
ond presidential candidate.
This total leaves the Village with
one candidate, two Toy on candi
dates, two Encina sponsors, and
eight Row candidates (excluding
Burke).
Primaries which will be held
Thursday will eliminate all but
four presidential candidates, as
will be the case of all offices
where there arc more than four
candidates.
