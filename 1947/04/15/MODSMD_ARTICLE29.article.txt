which has no apparent brush stroke,
fade-; away to a pale green, giving
a fueling of deptii. The old shack
and foreground are painted in
browns and yellows.
A still life by Victor Amautofl' is
a painting rich in color and compo
sition which employs design from
cabbage, radishes, and a paper bag.

ing a coffin in a dark foreground J

Among the student work, one of

clothes near by, is full of fun and
is sincere in color and composition.
Another painting, "Natives Wash
in}; Clothes," by Huyden Scott, is ol

bing clothes in a river. The subject
and color remind one of Gauguin's

SKULL AND MASK
A still life painted by Kay Pinoris
uses an animal skull and a round
eyed mask. The surprised look on
the face of the mask, the swirling
background, and the color, give the
painting exciting action.
Roger Tilton has a different tech
nique in his water color, in using
enough v#ater so that the color
steps into the paper. Particularly
good is his spring landscape, in
which the pinks and greens of
pring blend with each other and
give a light, delicate effect.
A landscape and a still life by
Veda Flowers show solidarity of
form through the use of contrasting
tones and colors.
An interesting painting is "Self
Portrait" by Dorothy Bowes, which
combines her own portrait with slill
life and landscape.

ADVANCE DECORATIVE DESIGN is shown in a model of a small

Stanford's lirst faculty and stu- |
dent art exhibit of the year opened
at the Gallery April 7 with a dis
play of paintings, designs, and cera
mics in varying styles and subjects.
Among the faculty work are two
landscapes and one portrait by Dan
iel Mendelowitz. The most strik
ing landscape, "Autumn Orchard,"
•hows fruit trees in brilliant yellow
against a dark mountain and a gray
sky.
The work of Dr. Kay Faulkner
is shown in three bright watercolors
of abstract, design called "Guate
mala Landscape," '"Guatemala," and
"New York City."
'AHANDoNKI) SHACK* DKTAIL
"Abandoned Shack," a painting
by Frcidoliu Kessler, done in com
plete detail, appears to be almost
three dimensional. A blue sky,
which has no apparent brush stroke,
fade-; away to a pale green, giving
a fueling of deptii. The old shack
and foreground are painted in
browns and yellows.
A still life by Victor Amautofl' is
a painting rich in color and compo
sition which employs design from
cabbage, radishes, and a paper bag.
Another painting by Arnautoff,
entitled ''Anii Lynching Demon
ttiation," shows lour Negroes bear- '
ing a coffin in a dark foreground J
which contrasts \vtth bright colors i
•if a city.
Two detailed watercolors repre- |
sent the work of Kdward IVI. Farm- j
er One of them is a still life of I
shells in natural pastel colors.

The Stanford Ail Gallery will i
be open lo visitors tonight from
8 to It) following the chamber
music program presented on the i
Tuesday Evening Series.
Regular gallery hours are Tues- j
days through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to |
[» p.m. and Sundays I t«i 5 p.m.

Among the student work, one of
the most impressive paintings is
"Still Life with a Rag Doll." This
painting, showing a rag doll lying
on a chair and a small chest ol
clothes near by, is full of fun and
is sincere in color and composition.
Another painting, "Natives Wash
in}; Clothes," by Huyden Scott, is ol
Negro women in bright colors scrub
bing clothes in a river. The subject
and color remind one of Gauguin's
paintings of the South Sea Islands.
SKULL AND MASK
A still life painted by Kay Pinoris
uses an animal skull and a round
eyed mask. The surprised look on
the face of the mask, the swirling
background, and the color, give the
painting exciting action.
Roger Tilton has a different tech
nique in his water color, in using
enough v#ater so that the color
steps into the paper. Particularly
good is his spring landscape, in
which the pinks and greens of
pring blend with each other and
give a light, delicate effect.
A landscape and a still life by
Veda Flowers show solidarity of
form through the use of contrasting
tones and colors.
An interesting painting is "Self
Portrait" by Dorothy Bowes, which
combines her own portrait with slill
life and landscape.
