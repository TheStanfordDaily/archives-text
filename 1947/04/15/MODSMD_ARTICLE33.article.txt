# Ex-KSU Radio Shop Offered Village Hams
## 
### 
"Would you like a radio shack,
a work shop, and a high spot for
your antenna?" C. E. Cunningham,
assistant village counselor, asks.
Since KSU's transfer to Memor
ial llall, the Village's auditorium
halcony has been unused.
Because the broadcasting booth
and shop spate is available for
radio work, a bulletin from Cun
ningham encourages radio hams
to think over the situation.
Village students interested in
forming a radio shop or some allied
organization may contact Cun
ningham in the Village Counsel
or's otlicc.
