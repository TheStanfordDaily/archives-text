# "Managua Nicaraguan" Compares Native Land to Hit-Parade Tune
## 
### LORRY LOKEY 
j "Managua, Nicaragua, is a licauti- j
I'nl place;
You buy a hacienda for a few
pesos down
And give ft to the girl you are
trying to win.
IWil her father won't let you come
in . .
"Lile comes easily in Managua
; where work is left for 'manana',"
j says Adelita Pellas, Stanford junior,
I native of the Central American j
country. "The song, 'Managua, Ni- !
j caragua,' is a little bit exaggerated ;
in places," she said, "but the coun
try is a wonderful place."
"Americans are never happy when
they leave the small Latin American •
country because they face so many i
of life's problems when they return j
to the hustle and bustle of Atneri
| can cities."
I Miss Pellas did concede that ha-
I cienda real estate cost a little more
than a few pesos (worth 20 cents

each) down, but their owners be- I
i came rich from coffee, sugar, and
| livestock production in tbe tropical
climate.
MUX I CO IS ARTIFICIAL
Contrasting Mexico with "the :
country across the 'agua'," Miss I
Pellas said, "Mexico is a convenient
country for tourists where many of |
the sights have been built for the ;
; visitor. Nicaragua, on the other |
bund, is neither artificial nor ruined ,
! by tourist trade; it is the same pic- ,
turesque country that it has always '
| been."
With that boost for the local
J Chamber of Commerce, Miss Pella.s
praised Managua weather to the I
■ point of making any native Califor-
I nian (a person born in Iowa) envi
! ous. Hot weather exists the year
'< 'round, with timely tropical showers
of short duration replenishing the
water supply.
"The song, 'Managua, Nicaragua,' i
says nothing of the continuous !

change of clothing residents employ
several limes a day to escape the
heat,' Miss Pellas pointed out.
IT'S NOT IN AFRICA
"i get so angry when people ask
me if Managua, Nicaragua, is in
South America or Africa," she com
plained, "but now that the song has
been written, everyone will realize
that Nicaragua is in Central Amer
ica."
Contrary to the third-place bal
lad on the "Hit Parade," Managua is
not a shipping port, although the
city of over 125,000 is situated on
one of the country's smaller lakes.
Incidentally, Miss Pel las also said,
"The ehaperone system in Nicara
gua is not used because the country
is so small that everyone knows his
neighbor. Pates are usually double
or in large parties."
Asked what "caramba scramba
barbarita" meant. Miss Pellas re
plied, "A yirl emphatically says
j 'no'."

"Lile comes easily in Managua

j says Adelita Pellas, Stanford junior,
I native of the Central American j
country. "The song, 'Managua, Ni- !
j caragua,' is a little bit exaggerated ;
in places," she said, "but the coun
try is a wonderful place."
"Americans are never happy when
they leave the small Latin American •
country because they face so many i
of life's problems when they return j
to the hustle and bustle of Atneri

I Miss Pellas did concede that ha-
I cienda real estate cost a little more
than a few pesos (worth 20 cents

each) down, but their owners be- I

Contrasting Mexico with "the :
country across the 'agua'," Miss I
Pellas said, "Mexico is a convenient
country for tourists where many of |
the sights have been built for the ;
; visitor. Nicaragua, on the other |
bund, is neither artificial nor ruined ,
! by tourist trade; it is the same pic- ,
turesque country that it has always '
| been."
With that boost for the local
J Chamber of Commerce, Miss Pella.s
praised Managua weather to the I
■ point of making any native Califor-
I nian (a person born in Iowa) envi
! ous. Hot weather exists the year
'< 'round, with timely tropical showers
of short duration replenishing the
water supply.
"The song, 'Managua, Nicaragua,' i
says nothing of the continuous !

change of clothing residents employ
several limes a day to escape the
heat,' Miss Pellas pointed out.
IT'S NOT IN AFRICA
"i get so angry when people ask
me if Managua, Nicaragua, is in
South America or Africa," she com
plained, "but now that the song has
been written, everyone will realize
that Nicaragua is in Central Amer
ica."
Contrary to the third-place bal
lad on the "Hit Parade," Managua is
not a shipping port, although the
city of over 125,000 is situated on
one of the country's smaller lakes.
Incidentally, Miss Pel las also said,
"The ehaperone system in Nicara
gua is not used because the country
is so small that everyone knows his
neighbor. Pates are usually double
or in large parties."
Asked what "caramba scramba
barbarita" meant. Miss Pellas re
plied, "A yirl emphatically says
j 'no'."
