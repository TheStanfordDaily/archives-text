# Stanford Nine Meets Broncos Today
## Dave Dahle Starts; Injuns Out After Second CIBA Loop Scalp 
### LYNN CARMAN 
Stanford's diamond perfomers return io tne C.1.8.A-. Daseball wars after a week of non-con
ference play when they seek to chalk up their third straight victory this afternoon at the expense ;
ot Santa Clara's visiting Broncos at 3:15 on the Sunken Diamond.

The Indians left off conference
play with their close .'i to 2 loss to
California a week and a half ago,
whereas the Broncos opened their
loop campaign only Saturday with
an 8 to 4 defeat by these same
Bears.
IT'S A "CROOCIAL"
That holdover from the basket
ball campaign—the "croocial" game
tag—can be dusted off and used
again for this afternoon's fracas,
fur a defeat by the Broncos dumps
the Indians into fifth place and paves
the way for a later drop into the
loop cellar. But if the Cardinals
wind up on the long end of the score
today, it's possible that they may
he able to hold onto their fourth
place position and even improve it
later on.
Southpaw Dave Dahle has been
named to carry the pitching bur
den for the Red Machine, and the
freshman portsider will be out there
after his first conference win in
two starts.
DAHLE GETS SUPPORT
Backing him in the field will he
a revised lineup, but it will be dif
ferent only in that the particular
combination hasn't been together
since the California game two Sat
urdays ago.
The chief change that Coach Harry
Wolter has made for today's ball
game is the left field switch which
puts George Sloat back into action
in the place of Al Kircher. Bob
Peters will be back on second and
Ward Walkup will don catching
togs again.
NO OTHER CHANGES
The rest of the ball club which
rolled to two clean-cut victories
last week will be back on the field
today. Bill Arce, who collected three
hits in Saturday's 13 to 3 rout of
the El Toro Marines, will be on
third, with glue-gloved Buck Brown
son scooping them up at short.
Benny Cardinalli will hold down
first.
