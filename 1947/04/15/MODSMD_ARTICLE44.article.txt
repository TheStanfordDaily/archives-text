# Shuffling the Cards with DON DAVIES
## 
### 
Lefty Truman unleashes his
strong Missouri sidearm today and
they're oil and running in the 1D47
baseball marathon, and with or
without Lippy Leo it will be the
biggest, ballyhooingest season of
them all.
The men who do the betting and
those who do the writing agree that
the defending ehamps the Cards in
the National and the Red Sox in the
American—are practically shoo-ins.
BOSOX ARE LOADED
Looking at the junior circuit first.
tin? Bosox are loaded — with Ted
Williams, Dom DiMaggio, Rudy
York, Bobby Doerr, Johnny Pesky
in the field and at the plate, and a
pitching staff led by Tex Rughson,
800 Ferriss, and Mickey Harris, the
Millionaires' worries are few. But
1 don't see another runaway like
J 94(1 proved to be. The Tigers and
Yanks, and the Cleveland Indians,
have some ideas of their own.
The Detroit entry boasts the
strongest array of hurlers in either
league, led by Hal Newhouser, who
is probably the best twirler in the
majors today, Dizzy Trout, Virgil
"File" Trucks, Freddy Hutchinson,
Al Benton, Stubby Overmire, and
more and more. Steve O'Neill has
one of the top garden combos with
luirkl-slugging Dick Wakefield, Hoot
Evers, and Pat Mullin patrolling ihe
outer reaches.
The infield is on the weak side,
and spring hitting and baserunning
haven't becu what they should be,
but I look for a big improvement
and see the Autocityers fighting it
out with the Beantowners right
down to the wire.
WHAT ABOUT YANKS?
What about the Yanks? The once
formidable Bronx Bombers seem to
be disintegrating under the Mac-
I'hail leadership. But Bucky Harris
is one of the game's top pilots and
may steer the Yanks onto the come
back trail.
II Joe DiMaggio has a big year,
if Snuffy Stirnweiss can start hit
ting, if Chandler, Bevens, and Rey
nolds can carry t lie pitching load,
if ex - Stanford baseballer Bobby
Blown comes through at third.
And then there's Cleveland and
Bobby Feller. Lou Boudreau has a
rejuvenated ball club built around
the hurling of Rapid Rob. And with
Boudreau and Joe Gordon they
have possibly the best shortstop
second base crifnbine in either
league.
Washington's Senators still have
a pretty fair ball club, the Chisox
are improved, but the situation is
about the same old story at St.
Louis and Mackadelphia.
The Junior League finish could
look something like this:
1. Boston Red Sox
2. Detroit Tigers
3. Cleveland Indians
1. New York Yankees
ii. Chicago White Sox
li. Washington Senators
7. St. Louis Browns
8. Philadelphia Athletics
WE WANT THE BUMS
Turning to the National, we want
the Dodgers! -It's disheartening to
think of penny-pinching Sam Brea
don winning another pennant and
stuffing more cabbage in his wallet
that won't pass around to the boys
who do the work.
The loss of Manager Durocher
was a blow — but the signing of
Jackie Robinson will iiive the Bums
a big boost. The Brooklyn hurling
contingent looks good with Ed Head,
Kirby Higbe, Ralph Branca. Vic
f.Minibardi, and Hal Gregg. Dixie
Walker. Carl FurilU), and Dick
Whitman give whoever is going to
be at the Brooklyn reins a strong
outfit Id. Bruce Edwards is a young
backstop who looks very good, and
the addition of Robinson brightens
u)j the infield picture, as Reese and
Stanky are among the best short
second combines. Pete Reiser and
th- rejuvenated Arky Vaughan are
still big question marks. If the Pis
tol-can play most of the season, and
if he is hot—it will be like a whole
case of benzidrene for the Bums.
The world champions are im
proved. They're going to be hard
to handle with a pitching staff that
lists Pollet, Munger, Beazley. Bre
rheen, and Dickson. The Cards still
have Mr. Shortstop, Marty Marion,
batting champ Stan Musial, Enos
Slaughter, and a whole flock of sea
soned Redbirds.
CARDS MAY STALE
The Cards have the stuff, but
Breadon is liable to j>et rid of ono
too many of his boys and the team
will go into a stall in the stretch.
If the Birds drop, the Cubs and

Braves will be hot on their necks.
The Cubs will come strong in late
season, and Bill Southworth is
whipping up a lot of trouble in
Bean town.
Better watch the Phillies, too. Ben
Chapman is doing a great job of
remodeling and the Phils might
prove to be the joker in the deck.
The Pirates and Reds are having
troubles, and the Giants may find
themselves back in the cellar de
spite a good spring showing.
When the senior circuit winds up
the list could read like this:
1. Brooklyn Dodgers
2. Chicago Cubs
.'!. Boston Braves
1. St. Louis Cardinals
Philadelphia Phillies
(i. Pittsburgh Pirates
7. Cincinnati Reds

Lefty Truman unleashes his
strong Missouri sidearm today and
they're oil and running in the 1D47
baseball marathon, and with or
without Lippy Leo it will be the
biggest, ballyhooingest season of
them all.
The men who do the betting and
those who do the writing agree that
the defending ehamps the Cards in
the National and the Red Sox in the
American—are practically shoo-ins.
BOSOX ARE LOADED
Looking at the junior circuit first.
tin? Bosox are loaded — with Ted
Williams, Dom DiMaggio, Rudy
York, Bobby Doerr, Johnny Pesky
in the field and at the plate, and a
pitching staff led by Tex Rughson,
800 Ferriss, and Mickey Harris, the
Millionaires' worries are few. But
1 don't see another runaway like
J 94(1 proved to be. The Tigers and
Yanks, and the Cleveland Indians,
have some ideas of their own.
The Detroit entry boasts the
strongest array of hurlers in either
league, led by Hal Newhouser, who
is probably the best twirler in the
majors today, Dizzy Trout, Virgil
"File" Trucks, Freddy Hutchinson,
Al Benton, Stubby Overmire, and
more and more. Steve O'Neill has
one of the top garden combos with
luirkl-slugging Dick Wakefield, Hoot
Evers, and Pat Mullin patrolling ihe
outer reaches.
The infield is on the weak side,
and spring hitting and baserunning
haven't becu what they should be,
but I look for a big improvement
and see the Autocityers fighting it
out with the Beantowners right
down to the wire.
WHAT ABOUT YANKS?
What about the Yanks? The once
formidable Bronx Bombers seem to
be disintegrating under the Mac-
I'hail leadership. But Bucky Harris
is one of the game's top pilots and
may steer the Yanks onto the come
back trail.
II Joe DiMaggio has a big year,
if Snuffy Stirnweiss can start hit
ting, if Chandler, Bevens, and Rey
nolds can carry t lie pitching load,
if ex - Stanford baseballer Bobby
Blown comes through at third.
And then there's Cleveland and
Bobby Feller. Lou Boudreau has a
rejuvenated ball club built around
the hurling of Rapid Rob. And with
Boudreau and Joe Gordon they
have possibly the best shortstop
second base crifnbine in either
league.
Washington's Senators still have
a pretty fair ball club, the Chisox
are improved, but the situation is
about the same old story at St.
Louis and Mackadelphia.
The Junior League finish could
look something like this:
1. Boston Red Sox
2. Detroit Tigers
3. Cleveland Indians
1. New York Yankees
ii. Chicago White Sox
li. Washington Senators
7. St. Louis Browns
8. Philadelphia Athletics
WE WANT THE BUMS
Turning to the National, we want
the Dodgers! -It's disheartening to
think of penny-pinching Sam Brea
don winning another pennant and
stuffing more cabbage in his wallet
that won't pass around to the boys
who do the work.
The loss of Manager Durocher
was a blow — but the signing of
Jackie Robinson will iiive the Bums
a big boost. The Brooklyn hurling
contingent looks good with Ed Head,
Kirby Higbe, Ralph Branca. Vic
f.Minibardi, and Hal Gregg. Dixie
Walker. Carl FurilU), and Dick
Whitman give whoever is going to
be at the Brooklyn reins a strong
outfit Id. Bruce Edwards is a young
backstop who looks very good, and
the addition of Robinson brightens
u)j the infield picture, as Reese and
Stanky are among the best short
second combines. Pete Reiser and
th- rejuvenated Arky Vaughan are
still big question marks. If the Pis
tol-can play most of the season, and
if he is hot—it will be like a whole
case of benzidrene for the Bums.
The world champions are im
proved. They're going to be hard
to handle with a pitching staff that
lists Pollet, Munger, Beazley. Bre
rheen, and Dickson. The Cards still
have Mr. Shortstop, Marty Marion,
batting champ Stan Musial, Enos
Slaughter, and a whole flock of sea
soned Redbirds.
CARDS MAY STALE
The Cards have the stuff, but
Breadon is liable to j>et rid of ono
too many of his boys and the team
will go into a stall in the stretch.
If the Birds drop, the Cubs and

Braves will be hot on their necks.
The Cubs will come strong in late
season, and Bill Southworth is
whipping up a lot of trouble in
Bean town.

batting champ Stan Musial, Enos
Slaughter, and a whole flock of sea
soned Redbirds.
CARDS MAY STALE
The Cards have the stuff, but
Breadon is liable to j>et rid of ono
too many of his boys and the team
will go into a stall in the stretch.
If the Birds drop, the Cubs and

Braves will be hot on their necks.
The Cubs will come strong in late
season, and Bill Southworth is
whipping up a lot of trouble in
Bean town.
Better watch the Phillies, too. Ben
Chapman is doing a great job of
remodeling and the Phils might
prove to be the joker in the deck.
The Pirates and Reds are having
troubles, and the Giants may find
themselves back in the cellar de
spite a good spring showing.
When the senior circuit winds up
the list could read like this:
1. Brooklyn Dodgers
2. Chicago Cubs
.'!. Boston Braves
1. St. Louis Cardinals
Philadelphia Phillies
(i. Pittsburgh Pirates
7. Cincinnati Reds
8. New York Giants
Lefty Truman unleashes his
strong Missouri sidearm today and
they're oil and running in the 1D47
baseball marathon, and with or
without Lippy Leo it will be the
biggest, ballyhooingest season of
them all.
The men who do the betting and
those who do the writing agree that
the defending ehamps the Cards in
the National and the Red Sox in the
American—are practically shoo-ins.
BOSOX ARE LOADED
Looking at the junior circuit first.
tin? Bosox are loaded — with Ted
Williams, Dom DiMaggio, Rudy
York, Bobby Doerr, Johnny Pesky
in the field and at the plate, and a
pitching staff led by Tex Rughson,
800 Ferriss, and Mickey Harris, the
Millionaires' worries are few. But
1 don't see another runaway like
J 94(1 proved to be. The Tigers and
Yanks, and the Cleveland Indians,
have some ideas of their own.
The Detroit entry boasts the
strongest array of hurlers in either
league, led by Hal Newhouser, who
is probably the best twirler in the
majors today, Dizzy Trout, Virgil
"File" Trucks, Freddy Hutchinson,
Al Benton, Stubby Overmire, and
more and more. Steve O'Neill has
one of the top garden combos with
luirkl-slugging Dick Wakefield, Hoot
Evers, and Pat Mullin patrolling ihe
outer reaches.
The infield is on the weak side,
and spring hitting and baserunning
haven't becu what they should be,
but I look for a big improvement
and see the Autocityers fighting it
out with the Beantowners right
down to the wire.
WHAT ABOUT YANKS?
What about the Yanks? The once
formidable Bronx Bombers seem to
be disintegrating under the Mac-
I'hail leadership. But Bucky Harris
is one of the game's top pilots and
may steer the Yanks onto the come
back trail.
II Joe DiMaggio has a big year,
if Snuffy Stirnweiss can start hit
ting, if Chandler, Bevens, and Rey
nolds can carry t lie pitching load,
if ex - Stanford baseballer Bobby
Blown comes through at third.
And then there's Cleveland and
Bobby Feller. Lou Boudreau has a
rejuvenated ball club built around
the hurling of Rapid Rob. And with
Boudreau and Joe Gordon they
have possibly the best shortstop
second base crifnbine in either
league.
Washington's Senators still have
a pretty fair ball club, the Chisox
are improved, but the situation is
about the same old story at St.
Louis and Mackadelphia.
The Junior League finish could
look something like this:
1. Boston Red Sox
2. Detroit Tigers
3. Cleveland Indians
1. New York Yankees
ii. Chicago White Sox
li. Washington Senators
7. St. Louis Browns
8. Philadelphia Athletics
WE WANT THE BUMS
Turning to the National, we want
the Dodgers! -It's disheartening to
think of penny-pinching Sam Brea
don winning another pennant and
stuffing more cabbage in his wallet
that won't pass around to the boys
who do the work.
The loss of Manager Durocher
was a blow — but the signing of
Jackie Robinson will iiive the Bums
a big boost. The Brooklyn hurling
contingent looks good with Ed Head,
Kirby Higbe, Ralph Branca. Vic
f.Minibardi, and Hal Gregg. Dixie
Walker. Carl FurilU), and Dick
Whitman give whoever is going to
be at the Brooklyn reins a strong
outfit Id. Bruce Edwards is a young
backstop who looks very good, and
the addition of Robinson brightens
u)j the infield picture, as Reese and
Stanky are among the best short
second combines. Pete Reiser and
th- rejuvenated Arky Vaughan are
still big question marks. If the Pis
tol-can play most of the season, and
if he is hot—it will be like a whole
case of benzidrene for the Bums.
The world champions are im
proved. They're going to be hard
to handle with a pitching staff that
lists Pollet, Munger, Beazley. Bre
rheen, and Dickson. The Cards still
have Mr. Shortstop, Marty Marion,
batting champ Stan Musial, Enos
Slaughter, and a whole flock of sea
soned Redbirds.
