# Schwartz, King Sol Keep Grid Candidates in Sweat
## 
### 
Old King Sol reigned yesterday afternoon as 150 perspiring
footballers took the field to begin the second week of spring prac
tice. Head Coach Marchie Schwartz sent the gridsters through
a full workout and light contact drill under the blazing afternoon
sun in preparation for the 1947 model of the Big Red Machine.
After the preliminary calisthenic period, the squad divided

j into five groups, each under the*
I watchful eye of an assistant coach.
While the guards, tackles, ends and
I centers worked out under the watch
j ful eyes of Coaches Phil Bengtson,
Chuck Taylor, Mai Elwood. and Fred
Scribner, the backfield men were
[ sent through their paces on an ad
joining field by Coaches Ray Hara
mett and Pete Kmetovic.
Later, the linemen were joined
by the backs, and at the end of the
j session the strings were running
' through plays as units.
