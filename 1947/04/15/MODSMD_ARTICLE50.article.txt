### 
Coach Jack Weiershauser took siock of his Indian track squad
after Saturday's disastrous San Jose State outing and sent his
men back into training immediately for tomorrow's cinderfest
with the combined junior colleges of San Francisco, San Mateo,
snd Menlo. Meet time is 4:15 p.m.
Rain two weeks ago postponed the jaycee track battle at a

♦ time when the Stanford thin clacls
were just getting organized. With
two practice battles under their
hell*, the Indians are favored to
run roughshod over the visiting
J.C. teams.
Tomorrow's hastily re-scheduled
meet will merely be a warmup
grind for the locals, who challenge
the Olympic Club on Angell Field
Saturday afternoon. Thus the tire—
i less Indians will participate in three
official meets in seven days.
