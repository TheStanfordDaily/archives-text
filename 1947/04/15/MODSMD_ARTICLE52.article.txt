# BULL SESSION

### DAN ENDSLEY 
When worse movies are made, Hollywood will
undoubtedly produce them. And the agents will in
dubitably be right on hand to collect their 10 per
cent.
All of which is in preface to a short diatribe on
how not '.j go to ;i movie.
in the first place, don't go on Friday night—
especially in Redwood City. It seems to be family
night. 1 have nothing against the institution of the
family, but —why must the entire noisy bunch go to
the flicks the same night, and thus spoil my enjoy
ment?
Put yourself in my shoes on a recent evening. You

decide you're in the mood for a
little relaxation, so you look up a
young friend who possesses a car—
male. (I understand it's also pos
sible to enjoy a movie if you take
a girl, and some day I plan to
try it.)
When you get to Redwood you
find that there is already a line of
six people before the box office,
and such a condition is well-nigh
intolerable. It takes you about
five minutes to get inside.

Once seated, you discover that you have walked
inside in the middle of the feature. The picture is
"Sheherezade" and there are a couple of Russian
officers talking. One tells the other he has just had
the first gentleman's girl out on a big date. You
have no way of knowing that he is lying and that
his friend knows it—or is this all too confusing?

Also—this untruthful gentleman calls his friend
"Romanov," so that you have no way of knowing
that he is in reality Nick Rimsky-Korsakov, the emi
nent musical man. There is also another slight draw
back; you assume from the picture that you are see
ing the straight dope about Nick's life. You don't
find out until the second time around that all this
was merely "inspired from the music of." There is
some doubt as to the validity of the inspiration, but
leave it lay.
You noticed when you sat down that there was
a pair of 14-year-olds in front of you. The boy keeps
trying to put his arm around the girl, and the girl
keeps jumping up to go over and consult with her
girl friend, six rows away.
You can stand that without exploding in annoy
ance —but there is a troupe of 8-year-old boys be
hind you, giving a good imitation of tearing down
the building. All children, you decide, should be
strangled at birth.
In time you find your eyes back on the picture,
and you perceive Yvonne De Carlo dancing some of
the ballet from Rimsky-K.'s "Sheherezade." Now
Miss D.C. is quite a handsome young woman, but
she dances like a sick cow with three legs. Your
evening is completely spoiled and there is nothing
left to do but go home and study.
On the way home your friend informs you that,
contrary to what you may think, there actually are
women in Hollywood who are both beautiful girls
and competent actresses.
It's a pity, you reflect, that none of them are in
pictures.
