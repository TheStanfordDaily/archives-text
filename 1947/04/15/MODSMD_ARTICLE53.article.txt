There is now before the Congress a bill spon
sor, d l.v the AVC that would increase subsistence
allowances a flat $35 to SlOO dollars a month for
single veterans and to $125 for veterans with depend
ants. This proposal was. I believe, debated by the
campus AVC chapter last quarter; I understand that
I hey did not indorse it. However, the national AVC
organization, "citizens tirst and veterans second" as
always, is presently pushing the legislation. And 1
see by the Daily that some 400 Stanford students have
signed an AVC-sponsored petition in favor of such
increased allowances. (Surprised I am that they
didn't put in a plug for increased unemployment
benefits at tlie same time. Is it fair, I ask you. to
expect a Stanford graduate to live the abundant
life on a measly $20 a week?)
II would be hard to deny that married couples
with children need more than $90 a month. A bill
granting an increase to them alone would be defensi
ble. But the proposition that a single veteran student
needs $100 a month for his or her bare subsistence is
fantastic. And there is one financial problem that
confronts many veteransâ€”the cost of textbooks.
That problem, however, is the creation of the Uni
versity; the intention of Congress was that more
than five cents would be left after payment of tuition
and lees.
Sure, it's a tight squeeze to get by on $65 a month.
Granted, it doesn't leave much for beer and movies,
not lo mention more extensive social activities, like a
$15 Senior Ball. But the $05 will, for most of us, cover
the cost of food and lodging, and I cannot say that
we have any right to tap the public treasury for
more. Kee-ristopher! At $100 a month, some people
would never leave school!

I found in my mail last week a leaflet from the
campus local of the "Citizens' Committee for United
Nations Reform." The organization here is com
posed of many of our most esteemed faculty members,
and I think that you will agree that, prima facie, it
can be presumed what the faculty says is worth
listening to. Calling it the "Quota Force Plan," the
CCUNR proposes three reforms in the present set-up
of the United Nations. First, to re-organize the
Security Council and abolish the veto, so that that
body can act against agression or threatened agres
sion. Second, to control the production of atomic
weapons in line with the Baruch proposal, and to
regulate the production of other scientific weapons
by assigning limited quotas to each nation. Third,
to organize a volunteer international army of citi
zens of the smaller nations under the direct control
of the Security Council, leaving national armies in
existence, but limited by production quotas.
Naturally, today, we are driven to ask, what about
Russia? In the event that Russia or any other major
nation refuses to accept the proposed three reforms
(abolish the veto, control armaments, form an inter
national army) then a special organization is to be
set up by the rest of the world to execute these
measures, leaving the dissenting state free to join
later. And all this clears the way for the long-term
solution of the economic and social problems that are,
they say, the real causes of war.
Now, I do not say that this is the answer. Even
I can attempt to criticize the plan as regards some
of the details. But it is a serious attempt by intelli
gent men to solve an immediate problem. I commend
their answer to your serious consideration.
