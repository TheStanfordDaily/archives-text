# CAMPUS OPINION

Editor, Stanford Daily
.So often in the past year, we have been confronted
with critical issues which have been and are being
decided by or for the American public. I for one,
must admit that it has been impossible for me at
least to be certain of enough knowledge surrounding
any of them to make a just decision. It is only pos
sible to stale what 1 believe, what I do not believe,
and what I think.
So, in the present issue—the Truman Doctrine—l
.submit the following:
1 cannot believe now, as I could not in Europe
two years ago. when I heard it from our enemies,
that Russia is or intends to become an aggressor
nat ion.
I cannot believe that we shall be able to buy the
support for our way df life that Russia is able to
.secure by sending missionaries and organizers.
1 cannot believe that we shall be able to extend
the areas of democratic belief and freedom, when
for the purposes of that extension, "its precise defini
tion becomes unimportant."
1 cannot believe that we shall be stronger if we
act alone, than we would be if we acted with the
approval of the majority of the other nations of the
world.
I cannot I clieve that Russia should be forced to
confine her interests to a particular corner of the
world, leaving the rest for "us democratic nations."
1 do believe that our only chance for world se
curity lies with the UN. and that it will only suc
ceed il we use the machinery we provided there to
solve our problems collectively.
I do not believe that the success of the UN is
more important to our civilization and to the human
race than whether any nation or the whole world
adopts communism, or socialism.
1 do believe that we have gone a long way from
the ideals of the Atlantic Charter, but that we have
not yet gone so far that the "precise definition of
freedom has become unimportant."
I do believe that if we are to justify our efforts

in behalf of any nation or cause, it can only be be- |
cause such effort will bring us closer to the freedom !
and happiness for which so many have already died, i
and for which so many others are now losing hope. \
I do believe that we Americans have contributed
a great deal to bring us so close to the possibility of '
world peace, but that other peoples in other nations
and at others times have also contributed, and that
their future is not now ours alone to decide.
I do believe that while we Americans have laid |
claim to the exclusive protection of the Western !
Hemisphere, we have not divided the rest of the I
world with Russia as yet, so that she now has "her j
own side of the street."
I thought that man was making advances in his
long search for truth, but find it growing more and i
more difficult to determine for myself.
I thought that with the ending of the war, nations
would for a few years at least, have resort to the
Assembly and Council, and to the World Court to
protect their interests and integrity, but am now
told that freedom and democracy can only be de- ;
fended by force and armed might.
I thought that democracy could only be secure i
when all peoples are allowed freedom to express |
their beliefs, and then only if each separate view I
was considered by the people, but am now told that
the mere expression of certain (communistic) beliefs
and any consideration of their values or faults is
dangerous to our system.
I thought that a political belief, or a political
affiliation was a person's own private affair, and could
not deprive him of any of his natural rights, but am I
now told that in certain parts of the world we must j
now determine a man's right to eat by his political I
belief.
Certainly if we are unable to determine the cor- |
reetness of these issues here with vast libraries for
reference, and professors and learned men to aid us, J
certainly the bulk of the American public has little
chance to reach an intelligent decision.
