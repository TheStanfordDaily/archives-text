WASHINGTON, April 14 (UP).—
A House committee informally de
mantled criminal prosecution of
Henry A. Wallace today, amid
growing clamor from Democrats and
Republicans for a quick White
House "crackdown" on the former
Vice-President.
Some members of Congress urged
President Truman to revoke Wai
lace's passport and compel his re
turn from England, where ho has
been making a series of speeches
disagreeing sharply with the Ad
ministration's foreign policy. One
member, Rep. L. Mendel Rivers, D.,
S.C., shouted in a House spech that
Wallace is "a mendacious idiot."
Chairman J. Parnell Thomas, R..
N.J., and members of his House Un-
American Activities Committee dug
into history and came up with a
14H-ye»r-old law, the I<ogan Act,
which they urged Attorney General
Tom Clark to employ promptly to
hall Wallace's utterances.
The law, enacted in 17M during
the John Adams administration and
brought iip to date in 1932. provide l
a three-year, prison term or .tf>,ooo
line for any person found guilty of
acting without authority to advise
or assist a foreign government to
oppose United States foreign policy.
The White House so fur has in
dicated no desire to get into the
controversy, though it renters
around Mr. Truman's $400,000,000
Greco - Turkish aid program now
pending in the Senate.
