# Professors' Rights Sought
## 
### 
Academic freedom—the right of
professors to express themselves in- j
dependently of trustee influence or \
stale control—is one of the many j
problems which the National Stu- i
dents Organization will probe when
il gels under way, according to i
Marilyn Sidwell, NSO chairman.
Academic freedom, expression of j
student opinion by student publi
cations, the right of student govern
ment to exist and play a major role
in college life are all problems which
come under the heading of Stanford's
regional commission.
Ned Fleming heads this commis
sion which will sift reports from 29
schools in California and Nevada
in an attempt to clarify the issues '
and aid in their solutions. j
"Questionnaires have been sent to
all the colleges in the region to ga- j
(her all the information for elassi- j
lication and analysis." said Fleming. I
lie emphasized NSO is a fact- ;
finding qroup and will attempt to i
examine all angles and aspects of
pressing collegiate problems coming
within his ("roup's interests.
