### 
WASHINGTON. April 15 (UP).-'
The House Committee on Un-Amcr
ican Activities charged tonight that
American Youth for Democracy is
â– \ direct arm of the Communist In
ternationale and is trying to plant
the seeds of Communism in Ameri
can universities and colleges.
In a documented, 20-page report
to Congress, the committee said the
organization "is neither American
nor democratic in its origin or pur
poses" and that it is "manipulated
by shrewd and specially trained or
ganizers behind the scenes."
It said it poses a threat to national
security "'as critical as any in his
tory" and added:
"The specter of Communism
stalks our college campuses masked
under the cloak of the American
Youth for Democracy.
Behind a veil of a multitude of
high-sounding slogans, one is con
scious of a determined effort to dis
alTect our youth and to turn them
against religion, the American
home, against the college authori
ties and against the government it
self."
The report did not recommend
specifically that the various states
and universities outlaw the group,
but it said that could best be de
cided by those conecrncd.
