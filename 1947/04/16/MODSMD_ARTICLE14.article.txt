# Truman Requests Embargo Power

### 
WASHINGTON, April 15 (UP).—
President Truman followed up his
quarantine Communism proposal
today with a special message to
Congress requesting authority to
embargo the shipment of American
arms and other war-making mate
rials to would-be aggressor states.
Warning that American weapons
must never again be permitted to
fall into the hands of a potential
enemy, the President asked revision
of the 1939 Neutrality Act lo pre
vent a recurrence of the wide-open
munitions traffic which helped arm
Japan for the attack on Pearl Har
bor.
"If war should ever at'ain become
imminent," he said, "il would be in
tolerable to find ourselves in our
present position of being bound by
our own legislation to give aid and
support lo any power which might
attack us."
Mr. Truman was blunt and em
phatic in his bid for the arms em
bargo, and he linked it directly to
the national security and the new
foreign policy which he has defined
as one of opposition—independently
and in co-operation with the United
Nations—to the forcible spread of
totalitarianism everywhere.
He pointed out thf.l under Section
12 of the neutrality law. the United
States cannot forbid the export of
arms to any foreign country, even
an aggressor, unless such shipments
would violate an existing treaty.
