## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
Retirement at 18!
Su<?h was the decision of young,
| aspiring Alice Farmer who forsook
! the glamour of the Bullet Hus.se lor
four years of concentrated study at
Stanford.
As she sat on her bed at Roble
surrounded by a Western Civ text
book and notes, pretty, petite Alice
looked quite unlike a girl who had
danced in the corps de ballet
throughout Centra! and South
America.
Graduated from high school at HI,
I Alice received an offer from the
famous ballet company during the
I summer of '45. She joined the com
pany in August of that year and
| remained with i! until the close of
the New York Metropolitan season

IN SOUTH AMERICA
While in South America, Alice,
t one of the youngest members in the
1 chorus, kepi a rigorous schedule ol
three hours' rehearsal, three hours
i of performance a day.
In Rio, Alice experienced a South
: American revolution of three days.
When questioned as to her personal
feelings during those days, she re
pli'-d simply, "Oh, I just walked
I through it all.
As to a career in ballet dancing,
Alice is quite emphatic. "I had I"
get the bug out ol my head," she
; laughingly replied. "And 1 did. Let
me fir. - t gel out of Western Civ he
j lore I start thinking seriously ol
j any sort of a career.
DESCRIBES MEN DAMT'JtS
The first question nearly every -
j body asks Alice when they find out
I she's a dancer is about men in the
ballet corps. Alice answers by say
: ing that most of the men are Irom
| old European families who have
| nothing left of once-glorious lamily
fortunes but a lew jewels.
"In Europe and South America,
people do not look down on arty
1 things like in'.*n dancers -as they
are inclined It) in the United Stales,"
I Alice said. She admitted that a lew
j were "horrible and unusual," but
| the majority wet" not what we
! might cull "sissies.
Thai American audiences are
I colder than other audiences was
J confirmed by Alice. "Americans ale
| impressed by show and big names,'
j she said.
One of Alice's lavorites in the
i ballet corps was the dancing direc
tor who could speak every language
but English. '"But we «ot along la
mously using sign language. 1 even
i picked up a little Russian, ' Alice
j remarked.
PERFORMS AT MIDNIGHT
Questioned as to whether Alice
ever performed for her corridor
mates, her roommat" promptly re
plied, "She keeps it to horsell most
|of the time." She says fhe would
hJldly know she was living with a
dancer if it weren't for the many
pictures of dancers decorating the
| room, and a box of theatrical make
! up and Costumes under the bed
Alice did, however, perform once
lor her corridor, but only under
compulsion. "We all gathered in
i one of the rooms at midnight to see
Alice dance in black tights black
lights, mind you,' her roommate
i stated. "When the housemother
1 came around to see what was caus
ing ihe big disturbance, one of the
j girls remarked dryly that w were

HURTS BALLROOM DANCING
Alice looked up from her Civ
