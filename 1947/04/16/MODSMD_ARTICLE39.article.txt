Pitcher Dave Dahle won his own
ball game with a single in the sev

he led his mates to a 4 to 3 victory
over Santa Clara's Broncos on the
Sunken Diamond.
The one-run victory boosted the
Indians to within half a game of
third place U.C.L.A., and dropped
the Broncos into a tie for the cellar.
Coach Harry Welter's win-hun
gry performers are slated for more
action this afternoon when they
play host to the California Aggies.
The Indians will be out looking for
their fourth straight victory when
the games begins at 3:15.
WAKEFIELD GOES TODAY
Charlie Wakefield has been named
by Wolter to go to the mound today
as the Indians send the same lineup
out to the field again.
Up until the seventh inning, t.he
Indians—and Dahle—were well in
control of the ball game and seemed
destined to coast to a 3 to 0 win.
But with two out, the Broncos took
advantage of an error and proceeded
to knock three runs across the plate
to tie up the game.
But in their half of the seventh,
the Cardinals came back into the
winning lead when first-baseman
Ben Cardinalli laced a double to
right and scored when D«hle came
through with a single
STOTT IS FIREMAN
Dave Stott took over the pitching
for Stanford in the eighth when
Santa Clara touched Dahle for an
other single, the runner going to
third on an outfield error, but Dahle
gained credit for the win.
The Indians jumped into an early
one-run lead, just as they have done
during the past three games, when
Lloyd Merriman knocked a slow
ball into the outfield for a single
and later scored.
Catcher Ward Walkup sacrificed
Merriman to second, and Ted Nell
walked to put two men on. Then
Bob Peters laid down a bunt, which
the pitcher gobbled up and threw to
first. Merriman came racing arouno
third and headed for home, sliding
in safely as the catcher dropped the
ball on the peg from first.
SCORE TWO IN THIRD
The Indians didn't waste any time
in coming back with another run
flu try, for they drove in two more
in the third to make the count 3-0.
With one out. Bill Arce started the
rally with a walk. Sloat hiit a per
fect double play ball to the second
baseman, but the Bronco infielder
muffed the rolling ball as Arce raced
all the way to third and Sloat went
on to second.
Buck Bj'ownson drove the two run
ners in with a rousing double to the
left field wall, but when he tried to
-tretch it into a triple the relay
caught him, cleaning the bases oi

Indian runners and ending the rally.
BROWNSON HITTING STAB
Brownson later collected another
double, but was again thrown out
at third. The speedy shortstop was
the only Farm' ball player to col
lect more than one hit during the
game.
Came the seventh, and the rally
of the visitors. After Pitcher Dick
Smith had gone down swinging for
the second out, Bill Crowley ground
ed to Bob Peters, but the Farm
second basement made a wild throw
to first and Crowley wound up on
second.
Harvey Toso rapped out a single
and went to second as Crowley came
home on the hit. But with one run
across, the visitors were not satis
fied. Bill Prentice hit one of Dahle's
slow balls past second to drive in
Toso.
PCLL DELAYED STEAL
Rightfielder Mason banged out a
single and Toso went to third. The
Broncos pulled a delayed steal out
of the hat—Mason lit out for second,
and when the throw went to second
Toso raced for home, beating the
cutoff and return throw as Santa
Clara tied up the count.
That was as near as the visitors
got to winning the game, for after
Stanford scored in its half of the
seventh the Broncos never threat
ened.
The Indians collected seven hits
off of two Santa Clara hurlers,
whereas the Broncos totaled eight
safe hits before the game was over.
But Santa Clara leit nine runners
stranded while Stanford left only
six men on base.
GOME/ VISITORS' STAR
Third baseman Caesar Gomez led
the attack for the visitors as lie .slam
med out three hits in four trips to
the plate, garnering hitting honors
lor the day. Prentice of Santa Clara
collected two hits in five trips.
For today's game, Coach Wolter
