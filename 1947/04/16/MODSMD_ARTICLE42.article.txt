## Indian J.V.'s Meet Jaycee Combo Today 
### JOHN HUBBARD 
i Three nearby junior colleges—
'San Mateo. San Francisco, and Men- j
110 combine forces ibis afternoon on !
Angell Field for a dual meet with
'Stanford's jayvee track team. This 1
will be the first, and probably the!
last, appearance of the season for J
ihe Indian junior varsity as a unit,
although many members of the squad
also see action in varsity competi- i
tion.
The trio of junior colleges were \
humbled 106-3 10 to 52-7 10 in a
flual meet with California's jayvees !
i April (i. but produced a lew pretty !
! respectable individual performances, j
SFJC's Julian Griffin turned in a
; 10 flat hundred, and a 22.7 220 to |
! pace the field in those two events.
George Caredio. running lor the ;
.same school, was clocked at 51.7 in
J the quarter-mile.
SHOULD WIN EASILY
On the whole, however, the In- 1
dians are expected to have little j
I trouble in garnering enough points j
to put the meet on ice. Coach Jack j
Weiershauser will call on Dell Rus
sell and Paul Kent in the two hur
j die races. Bill Smith and Bob Fess
in the sprints, and Frank Held and ,
Don Campbell in the pole vault to J
j spearhead Stanford's attack.
Meanwhile, the track team as a
| whole is hard at work preparing J
! for the Olympic Club meet here Sat
urday. Coaches Weiershauser and
| "'Dutch" Warmerdam have posted
two notices on the Angell Field bul
letin board as a grim reminder to |
their charges.
One of the notices compares Stan
fords showing against San Jose
I State with Cal's record against !
I Michigan last week, indicating, on
j that basis, California would have a ;
j 66 ! . edge over the Indians.
The other follows the same tech
i nique in regard to UCLA's meet
I with Occidental, concluding that the

Bruins would hold a 75-sti advantage.
