# Delts Collect Mural Victory
## 
### 
Behind the effective hurling of
Gus Chavalis, Delta Tau Delta got
the long end of a 7 to 0 score over
Sigma Nu in Intramural softball
yesterday afternoon. In an extra
inning, the Delts broke the back of
a till-then hard-fought bull game
by blasting in four runs for a de
cisive win.
The other scheduled games saw
Phi Psi defeat Chi Psi, 4 to 1: Phi
Kappa Sigma nosed out Kappa Alpha
by a 2 to 1 score; and Sigma Chi,
with pitcher Bob Slobe delivering,
steamrollered Delta Kappa Epsilon
13 to 0.
Village Softball exploded with a
25 to 12 win by House 210, the cir
cuit clout of A 1 Ambrose being the
final blow to rout the 314-312 team.
House 117 topped 308. 8 to 2. in the
other scheduled contest.
