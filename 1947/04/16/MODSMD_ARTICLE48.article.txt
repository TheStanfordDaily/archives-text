## Items of interest to Students of Science and Engineering Research Problems in the Manufacture of Nylon 
### 
< -1-1 mont h in this space the develop
ment of nylon was traced from a funda
mental research study on linear polymers
ilii first synthetic organic fibers, the
u ( :<rpolya mides. This installment deals
wilt the complex manufacturing re
eiich problems that followed.
From the start 1 here were obstacles
o the product ion on a commercial scale
oi the "66" polymer—so named because
the adipic acid and hexamethylenedia
mine from which it is made have six
carbon atoms each.
Although adipic acid was being pro
duced in Germany, it was necessary to
developa new process to meetcondit ions
at I)u 1 'ont's Belle,W. Va.. plant, where,
because of the catalytic technique in
volved, it was decided to make this
intermediate. 1 lexamet hylenediamine
was only a laboratory curiosity, and a
process for its commercial production
had likewise to be worked out. Fortu
nately it was found that the diamine
could be made from adipic acid by new
catalytic processes. The results of these
investigations may be summarized as
follows:

A Nylon Polymer
The synthesis of intermediates was
only part of the problem. Nylon poly
mer was an entirely new material with
properties different from any previous
synthetic product. It. provided the first
example of spinning fiber from .1 molten
polymer (m.p.263'C) and required en
tirely different techniques from ravon
spinning. Information was acquired
only by painstaking experimentation at
each step.
Manufacturing Process Outlined
The process as finally developed for the
manufacture of nylon and its fabrica
tion into yarn may be briefly outlined
as follows:
Nylon salt is heated in an autoclave
with addition of stabilizers to control

molecular weight and viscosity. A long
chain linear polymer is formed with a
molecular weight of 10,000 or higher.
The melt is converted to solid chips
that are later re-melted and extruded
through a spinneret to form filaments
at a speed of 2,500 feet a minute. The
filaments are then drawn out to about
four times their original length in order
to develop the desired textile qualities

These operations i?oun<F simple "
enough, hut some oi the problems en
countered were ox* raordin;iVily difficult.
For example, a droned;
'for melting the polytrief w&.i'necessary
because ol'the poor thermal conduetiy
ity of the polymer; pumps letd to pporV
ate at 285 C with onlypolymerias a
lubricant; special a (u'asion-resist ant
steels that did not soften or wafp at
28f) r 'C were necessary; the .spirmliig. as
sembling required radically ftV-w engi
neering developments to produce the
necessary fiber qualities. > . ,•„
All of these ehejnioat, physical and
mechanical, engineering problems had
to be s6lved and into a uni
fied process before manufacture-of riy-.
lon could be undfjj'rtfllyc*'. F;Y a ft. about
230 .technical men and eight jnaniMuo .

credit for making nylon the important
part of American life it is today.
