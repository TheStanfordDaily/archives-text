## Housing: A Tough Job 
### 
When sororities were abolished from the
Stanford campus in Spring, 1944, a major
problem confronted the university what to
do about women's housing. A student organi
zation known as Housing Committee was set
up to work out a revised housing program.
Since fall, 1944, the committee has pre
sented and used seveial plans. Housing com
members have worked conscientiously to
solve housing difficulties but during their
two and one-half years of planning they have
discovered that no campus housing program
will satisfy all women students.
Because of the unusually crowded living
situation of the campus several minority
groups have been given preference in room
drawing. Women outside of these groups
have objected to having their chances of
moving lowered, but the sophomores forced
to stay in Roble an extra year and the other
students handicapped by the crowded condi
tions feel that they deserve help in moving.
An argument against preferences is that it
they are continued a precedent will be started
that may be difficult to stop.
The ratio system of drawing, which Housing
Com put into effect for spring guarter moving
last year has dissatisfied some students. In
this system vacancies in every house are
given to classes according to the ratio of wo
men drawing from that class as compared to
the total number moving. This plan was in
troduced to help the small living groups keep
a representative number of every class in their
houses, but it makes it more difficult for upper
classmen to move to the houses of their choice

before they graduate. Therefore, fall and win
ter moving is done by class preference.
Two other problems, a decision on the so- i
cial program to introduce freshmen to campus
living groups and the placement of transfer
students, are facing Housing Com now. It is
up to this committee to weigh both sides of
the arguments and reach a decision that will
displease the least number of students.
Fair decisions will be difficult to make and
at least one group on campus is certain to be
dissatisfied. However in testing new housing
programs and ideas the committee will be
forming a foundation for happier women's
housing in the future.â€”M.S.
