# BULL SESSION

### HELEN PINKERTON 
(Note: The editor says this column can be about
something that isn't humorous. He's the only one
who hadn't realized that fact yet. Today's session
happens to be a story that's intentionally straight.)
(Note, again: We have been asked to do a re
view of a recent vocal concert, but we're not an
authority on music and leave this task to more
competent judgements.)
Free will's a funny thing. We knew an intellec
tual once (he's not at Stanford anymore) who be
lieved in free choice. He "just knew'' he was the
boss of his own action.
In one part of his mind he was pretty scientific
and objective. He knew that falling bodies fall at
a certain speed, that heredity follows certain laws,
that given a certain set of conditions a certain result
habitually follows.
But in another part he was sure that he was
different, because he was human. His argument was
that if you believe in your freedom it is there. Still
he thought it preposterous to think that if you pos
tulate a light switch, light will be there.

Our intellectual had a habit of long-standing.
Once or twice a week he went out to "heist a cou
ple. Being an intellectual and poor, of course, he
knew this took time and money better spent on other
things. No matter how hard and long he thought
about it. still when the boys piled out, he went too.
He didn't enjoy himself though, his conscience both
ered him so much.
One day the "reason" which guided his free action
turned up in the shape of a brown-eyed brunette
from the Mid-West. She didn't enjoy hoisting a
couple at any time and didn't want any one else to
either. In a shot our friend "voluntarily" gave it up.
He called it will-power, but it looked to us like a
learned reaction, because when she became engaged
to a biz school grad, our intellectual (again volun
tarily) gave up giving up.
Later he went to the University of Chicago and
flunked out.
He ended up in the regular army where his free
will has assumed an even more abstract nature.
We told you it wasn't a funny story.

One day the "reason" which guided his free action
turned up in the shape of a brown-eyed brunette
from the Mid-West. She didn't enjoy hoisting a
couple at any time and didn't want any one else to
either. In a shot our friend "voluntarily" gave it up.
He called it will-power, but it looked to us like a
learned reaction, because when she became engaged
to a biz school grad, our intellectual (again volun
tarily) gave up giving up.
Later he went to the University of Chicago and
flunked out.
He ended up in the regular army where his free
will has assumed an even more abstract nature.
We told you it wasn't a funny story.
