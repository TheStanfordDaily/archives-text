### DAN ENDSLEY 
Much has been said about Henry Wallace of late,
and not the least of the contributors has been Henry
Wallace. You can accuse him of almost anything
else, but nobody can truthfully claim the man is shy.
Ho has become the rallying point for numerous
liberals and pseudo-liberals in this country, We
can discount the support he Rets from Russia; few
would maintain that such support is sincere and ob
jective.
Let's take a look at the man's record. He is good—
even brilliant—in his own line, which is farming.
He is still receiving dividends on a type of hybrid
corn he developed. He was also considered a success
as editor of a farm paper, but "Wallace's Farmer"—
which came to him from his grandfather and father
was on the downgrade when he left the editorship.
He is one of the few men in public life whose sin
cerity and honesty is not open to doubt. No thinking
man would question his integrity. In fact, the reason
he gets himself in hot water so often is because he
is so forthright. He talks too much at the wrong
times.
When I' .D.R. began his New Deal experiment in
I!KJ3. Henry Agard Wallace became Secretary of Agri
culture. From the start he was one of the President's
fair-haired boys. He had over-all direction of the
Agricultural Adjustment Act from its inception. It
was desired to raise farm prices so the farmers would
have a greater purchasing power.
It was, as many of you remember, a period of
depression. Consumers didn't have enough purchas
ing power to buy the things they needed; thus pro
ducers had no profits with which to increase produc
tion and hire more men. At this time the A.A.A.
established an economy of scarcity in the midst of
want. Ihe killing of little pigs and the plowing under
oi corn became front page news. Rather than increas
ing production, the A.A.A. curtailed it and at the
same time raised prices, making matters worse.
The A.A.A. was ruled unconstitutional, but Wal
lace remained in the Cabinet eight years. Then he
became Vice-President—because F.D.R. crammed him
down the throats of the delegates at the Chicago
convention. He did not withdraw as a candidate when
h» saw he was not wanted and that only F.D.R.'s

prestige could pull him through; he brazened it out.

But the Democratic Party would
not renominate him and instead
named Harry Truman four years
later, Wallace muscled his way
back into the Cabinet, and again
it was only F.D.R.'s prestige and
personal friendship which made it
possible.
F.D.R. died, and the new Presi
dent was pretty green at first. In
the midst of a delicate foreign situ
aiton Wallace made public state-

ments disagreeing with the State Department's policy.
He was then Secretary of Commerce —not of State. !
A private citizen has a right to criticize his govern
ment —but a member of that government can't
honorably do so publicly without resigning. He didn't
resign. ,
What Wallace advocated—and has been advocating
ever since—was a policy Secy. Byrnes had tried at
the first Moscow Conference he attended. Byrnes was
so conciliatory as to verge on appeasement; he yielded
on almost every point. But Russo-American relations j
reached their very nadir. Alter a stiffer policy was [
adopted, affairs improved a bit and have never since I
got quite so bad.
Wallace, as a member of the government, de
manded that the U.S. go back to a policy which was
a proven failure. Finally he had to be booted out '
of the Cabinet. He has become editor of The New :
Republic, and his writings sound wonderfully logi- j
cal—until he reaches his conclusions. For instance,
he says all we have to do is reform the government j
of Greece to eliminate all cause for trouble there, j
That's fine—but HOW do we reform the government !
of Greece? He thinks emotionally, not logically. The
world would be a fine place if it were full of Henry
Wallaces—but unfortunately it is not.
Those of us who feel that the present American
system is in need of improvement internally and ex
ternally, if it is to survive, need a leader badly, but
Wallace isn't the man. Perhaps he's behind the
times -and perhaps he's far ahead of them—but he
has no place in this era of strife.

was desired to raise farm prices so the farmers would
have a greater purchasing power.
It was, as many of you remember, a period of
depression. Consumers didn't have enough purchas
ing power to buy the things they needed; thus pro
ducers had no profits with which to increase produc
tion and hire more men. At this time the A.A.A.
established an economy of scarcity in the midst of
want. Ihe killing of little pigs and the plowing under
oi corn became front page news. Rather than increas
ing production, the A.A.A. curtailed it and at the
same time raised prices, making matters worse.
The A.A.A. was ruled unconstitutional, but Wal
lace remained in the Cabinet eight years. Then he
became Vice-President—because F.D.R. crammed him
down the throats of the delegates at the Chicago
convention. He did not withdraw as a candidate when
h» saw he was not wanted and that only F.D.R.'s

prestige could pull him through; he brazened it out.

But the Democratic Party would
not renominate him and instead
named Harry Truman four years
later, Wallace muscled his way
back into the Cabinet, and again
it was only F.D.R.'s prestige and
personal friendship which made it
possible.
F.D.R. died, and the new Presi
dent was pretty green at first. In
the midst of a delicate foreign situ
aiton Wallace made public state-

ments disagreeing with the State Department's policy.
He was then Secretary of Commerce —not of State. !
A private citizen has a right to criticize his govern
ment —but a member of that government can't
honorably do so publicly without resigning. He didn't
resign. ,
What Wallace advocated—and has been advocating
ever since—was a policy Secy. Byrnes had tried at
the first Moscow Conference he attended. Byrnes was
so conciliatory as to verge on appeasement; he yielded
on almost every point. But Russo-American relations j
reached their very nadir. Alter a stiffer policy was [
adopted, affairs improved a bit and have never since I
got quite so bad.
Wallace, as a member of the government, de
manded that the U.S. go back to a policy which was
a proven failure. Finally he had to be booted out '
of the Cabinet. He has become editor of The New :
Republic, and his writings sound wonderfully logi- j
cal—until he reaches his conclusions. For instance,
he says all we have to do is reform the government j
of Greece to eliminate all cause for trouble there, j
That's fine—but HOW do we reform the government !
of Greece? He thinks emotionally, not logically. The
world would be a fine place if it were full of Henry
Wallaces—but unfortunately it is not.
Those of us who feel that the present American
system is in need of improvement internally and ex
ternally, if it is to survive, need a leader badly, but
Wallace isn't the man. Perhaps he's behind the
times -and perhaps he's far ahead of them—but he
has no place in this era of strife.

Much has been said about Henry Wallace of late,
and not the least of the contributors has been Henry
Wallace. You can accuse him of almost anything
else, but nobody can truthfully claim the man is shy.
Ho has become the rallying point for numerous
liberals and pseudo-liberals in this country, We
can discount the support he Rets from Russia; few
would maintain that such support is sincere and ob
jective.
Let's take a look at the man's record. He is good—
even brilliant—in his own line, which is farming.
He is still receiving dividends on a type of hybrid
corn he developed. He was also considered a success
as editor of a farm paper, but "Wallace's Farmer"—
which came to him from his grandfather and father
was on the downgrade when he left the editorship.
He is one of the few men in public life whose sin
cerity and honesty is not open to doubt. No thinking
man would question his integrity. In fact, the reason
he gets himself in hot water so often is because he
is so forthright. He talks too much at the wrong
times.

dent was pretty green at first. In
the midst of a delicate foreign situ
aiton Wallace made public state-

ments disagreeing with the State Department's policy.
He was then Secretary of Commerce —not of State. !
A private citizen has a right to criticize his govern
ment —but a member of that government can't
honorably do so publicly without resigning. He didn't
resign. ,
What Wallace advocated—and has been advocating
ever since—was a policy Secy. Byrnes had tried at
the first Moscow Conference he attended. Byrnes was
so conciliatory as to verge on appeasement; he yielded
on almost every point. But Russo-American relations j
reached their very nadir. Alter a stiffer policy was [
adopted, affairs improved a bit and have never since I
got quite so bad.
Wallace, as a member of the government, de
manded that the U.S. go back to a policy which was
a proven failure. Finally he had to be booted out '
of the Cabinet. He has become editor of The New :
Republic, and his writings sound wonderfully logi- j
cal—until he reaches his conclusions. For instance,
he says all we have to do is reform the government j
of Greece to eliminate all cause for trouble there, j
That's fine—but HOW do we reform the government !
of Greece? He thinks emotionally, not logically. The
world would be a fine place if it were full of Henry
Wallaces—but unfortunately it is not.
Those of us who feel that the present American
system is in need of improvement internally and ex
ternally, if it is to survive, need a leader badly, but
Wallace isn't the man. Perhaps he's behind the
times -and perhaps he's far ahead of them—but he
has no place in this era of strife.
