# No One Seems to Know When It Will Cool Off
## 
### 
Mrs. 15, cook at the Alpha Sigma
Phi house, is baffled. Never be
fore in her memory has the beat
lasted more than three days.
Sunday she confidently predict
ed that the fog would roll in dur
ing the afternoon. On .Monday
she was sure it would cool oft'
soon, but decided not to count
Friday as the first hot dav since it
was hot only in the afternoon.
Yesterday, becoming slightly
worried, she declared that Sun
day could not be counted 011 the
list of hot days either because it
was a holiday. Late last night she
was still sure i( would cool off
soon.
Bailey Willis, professor of geol
ogy emeritus, whose book. "/\
Yanqui in Patagonia." is 011 sale
at the Bookstore, remarked that
this is "ideal earthquake weath
er."
The weather man. however, was
noncommittal, confining bis re
marks and predictions to the in
formation that it was only about
X 4 degrees in the shade yesterday
afternoon.
