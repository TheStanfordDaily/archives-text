## 
### 
Yvor Winters, associate professor of English, has had two books pub
lished this year, "In Defense of Reason" and "Edwin Arlington Robinson."
"In Defense of Reason," a miscellaneous collection of essays on Ameri
can literature, is Mr. Winter's main work of the last two decades, it con
tains reprints of three of his earlier works, "Primitivism and Decadence,"

"Maule's Curse," and "Anatomy of
Nonsense."
"Maule's Curse" is a study in the
history of American obscurantism,'a
tendency which may sometimes be
found in the work of T. S. Eliot.
The book also contains a new
essay, "Significance of the Bridge,"
by Hart Crane, or "What Are We to
Think of Professor X?," and a new
introductory essay.
Mr. Winters, who has been de
scribed as one of the country's out
standing critics, tells of the growth
of Edwin Arlington Robinson as a
poet in his "Edwin Arlington Rob
inson. ' In it he analyzes many of
his most important poems, it is a
critical review, and must be read
in conjunction with Robinson's
"Collected Poems."
"Time, in its review of January
G, said, "Winters has a sensitiveness

to poetic effect that lifts his critic
ism of the late poet . . . far out of
the academic class."
