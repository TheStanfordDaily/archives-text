## 
### 
TEXAS CITY, Tex., April 16 (UP) —A chain of explosions
blasted this industrial city today, killing and injuring hundreds
ot persons, setting chemical and oil fires which still blazed
furiously tonight and causing property damage estimated as
high as 575,000,000.
New explosions, adding to the series which started aboard a French
nitrate freighter Grand Camp, extended into the $19,000,000 Monsanto
Chemical Company plant with disastrous consequences.
Death toll estimates were as high as 1,200, but Gov. Beaufort Jester,
after a three hour personal survey of (he blast area, said "it is impossible
to make an accurate estimate" of the dead.
KM) CROSS REPORTS
The Red Cross reported 500 bodies had been removed by 5:15 p.m.
E.S.T., and hospitals at Galveston estimated they had already treated
more than .'5,000 persons for blast injuries.
Wild rumors that new explosions were imminent on ships in the
harbor brought a panicky but temporary exodus from the city tonight.
A report spread that a ship loaded with "nitrate" was about to blow
up, but il turned out to one carrying a cargo of flour.
Police cars with public address amplifiers patroled the debris-strewn
streets, urging the still-living among the city's 18,000 population to leave
the disaster area.
FUMES AVERTED
The threat that poisonous gas fumes—-chlorine from a burning tank
and nitrogen dioxide from exploded chemicals—would cloud over the city
was averted when a northerly wind mercifully carried the fumes out
over the bay.
Fire still raged 12 hours after the first explosion through the 30-acre
Monsanto plant and in two oil refineries and 50 huge oil tanks along the
waterfront. Officials believed the fire would burn for days.
