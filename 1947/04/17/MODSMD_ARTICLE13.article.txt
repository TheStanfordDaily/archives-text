# it's Your Responsibility (Editorial)
## 
### 
Today's primary, the first in Stanford's history, contains
both good and bad aspocts which should bo considered by
voters.
On the positive side, it offers a large selection of candidates
from which to choose, and it also allows the students an extra
week to look over those persons running.
On the negative side there is danger that with such a large
field that "minority" candidates will be pushed into the finals
due to a widely split vote. This is a situation which exists today.
The job of student body president possesses far less glamor
than most persons realize. It requires an experienced organizer
and administrator, of proven ability, who is willing to work
hard to make his term of office a success. It is not a position
for those who are willing to devote only a couple hours a day
to the job.
Stop to consider, before you vote, just what you know of
a candidate's proven ability. Don't be misled by "big names"
or confuse ability in unrelated fields with executive ability.
Make your decision a good one. If you are one who has
expressed dissatisfaction with campus student government,
hen this is your opportunity to put in persons who you think
will produce.
