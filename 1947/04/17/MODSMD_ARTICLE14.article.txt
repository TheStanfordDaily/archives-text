# Presidential Candidates Talk Before 400 Stanford Women
## 
### 
Four hundred women gathered in Lagunita Court last night
to hear 11 presidential candidates present their political plat- S
forms— platforms that all hinged on one central plan—to promote
a greater degree of cooperation and unity between the adminis
tration and the student body.

Morley Thompson dramatically
phrased this central idea with the
slogan, "co-ordination and co-op
eration." "Find out. what, the student
wants," Thompson stated, "and then
get it."
CAMPUS GET- TO - G ETHERS
A new function of student gov
ernment was brought to the atten
tion of the assembled women by A 1
Forbes. He suggested that, the
elected officers be used to introduce
students to both the methods of gov
ernment and the offices so that they
might, understand how their gov
ernment is run. "We explain what
happens," Forbes said; "you carry
on from there."
Bob Lewis again reiterated the
close tic that should exist between
the administration and the students.
A second proposal of the Village
candidate was that of organizing
campus get-to-gcthers with outside
entertainment to carry on Farm
spirit.
IMPROVE HONOR CODE
"More liaison between the two
groups, "Bill MePherson stated em
phatically. The second point in Mc
pherson's program was that inter
national groups should be supported
if they have the backing of the stu
dents. A further change in govern
ment policy advocated by the Toyon
president was that the different or
ganizations such as Rally Com and
Cardinals have ex-officio members
whose duty it would be to report
their happenings to the students.
Carl Burke made his stand on four
clear issues: (1) More student par
ticipation in student activities; (2)
improving the Honor Code; (3) a
new Union and gymnasium by means
of a referendum; (4) responsible and
capable governmental officials.
Tom Martzloff based his platform
on the plan that the spirit of unity
shbuld be conveyed all over cam
pus. "Get out and vote tomorrow,"
Martzloff urged. "Views unexpressed
are of no value."
CAMPUS UNITY
Another candidate impressed with
the idea of continuing and fortifying
campus unity was Dave Davidson
who spoke of the student body act
ing as one unit. "Members of Ex
com should go directly to the stu
dents," Davidson advised. He spoke
with sincerity of a government re
spected by the administration and
student body alike.
"A vigorous and well-coordinated
student administration" was the pro
posal of George Grimes. 'Hie presi
dent shouldn't think for the stu
dents," Grimes emphasized, stress
ing the need of the student govern
ment. to support the policy of living
groups through their representa
tives.
Mitguard defined an able
president as one who would carry
out his duties with care, aggressive
ness, clear thinking, and seriousness
of purpose. "A student president
must be fair and unprejudiced,"
Mitguard added.
MUST BE A LEADER
"Opcn-mindedness and coopera
tion in office" was stressed by Niel
Allen. A president must give care
ful and complete consideration to
all student opinion, according to the
I.S.C. head.
To be a president, Joseph Picker
ing stated, one must actually be a
leader; must protect, student's rights;
and serve as a mediator between
administration and the students.
