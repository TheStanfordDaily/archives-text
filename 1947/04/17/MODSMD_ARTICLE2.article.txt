WASHINGTON, April 16—Leaders of the nation's 325,000
striking telephone workers tonight accused company officials
of trying to break the 10-day-old strike by threats and intimida
tion, but warned the walkout will continue until union members
win or are "starved into submission."
In a nationwide radio address (ABC), President Joseph A. Beirne
of the National Federation of Telephone Workers charged that officials of
the American Telephone & Telegraph Co. were threatening strikers with
loss (if jobs, priority, sick leave benefits, and pensions unless they re
turned to work.
But, he said, the strike will go on—"either until AT&T gives in, or
until the workers arc starved into submission."
He said ihe $12 weekly wage boost demanded by the union was
needed to improve the telephone workers' living standards which have
"slipped dangerously in the past year and are steadily getting worse."
"No Bell company has offered a penny of wage increase as a counter
proposal to our demand," he said.
"They have admitted that we are entitled to an increase, but they want
lis to wait tor the steel ;md other industries to move before they do."
