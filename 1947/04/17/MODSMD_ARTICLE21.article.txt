## 
### MARY KRAFT 
Spring vacation brought 24 stu
dents and professors back to cam
pus with even better tans than those
who went to Carinel or Balboa.
These people, members of the
Stanford Natural History Club,
went to Death Valley to collect
specimens for the Natural History
Museum. The members of the group
ranged from two freshmen to sev
eral professors. Taking food from
Palo Alto to last thein the entire
trip, they camped at Midway Well
io Death Valley.
LONG FIELD TRIPS
Now a group composed of anyone
interested in natural history, the
club takes long field trips in fall and
spring arid shorter ones during the
quarter. The club has been collect
ing specimens for the museum since
its founding in the same year as
the University under the name of
the Zoological Club.
Botanists, mineralogists, ichthyol
ogists, ornithologists, entomologists,
and even a couple of English majors
were included in those who went to
Death Valley.
I INI> RARE PLANT
Everyone collected what he or
she was most interested in, but they
all helped each other. One of the

biggest events was when Betty
Kahn, a junior at Lagunita, spotted
a plant for which Ira L. Wiggins,
director of the Natural History Mu
seum, had been searching for some
time.
Everyone returned from the trip
with specimens except the ichthy
ologists, who caught no fish. Among
the specimens which were brought
back, mostly alive, were three pyg
my iguanas (lizards), all sizes of
horned toads all named Horace,
gridiron - tail lizards, ehuckwallas,
and a sidewinder rattlesnake.
RATTLESNAKE ESCAPES
Two of the botanists came close
to bringing back a rare Panamint
rattler, which they caught by using
a belt for a noose, but unfortunately
the snake escaped.
'Hie expedition carried its own
fuel, building bonfires at. night with
Presto logs, and cooking on gasoline
stoves. Chores were divided tip so
tliat each took a turn at cooking and
did his own dishes.
MANY PLANTS IN VALLEY
According to Mrs. Wiggins there
are varieties of many plants in
Death Valley which are found no
place else.
Besides collecting material around
Midway Well, groups made side

trips to Übehebe Crater and the old
i mining towns near Beatty.
