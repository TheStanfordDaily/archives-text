## 
### 
"The best Issue ever put out in
April 1947."
That's the promise of Chaparral
editor, Old Boy F. Q. Ilewitt. A
photo spread on the life of a Stan
ford woman, more queens than
you can count, and pages of gags
all topped by a terrific three-color
cover by Jim Conner, is the Old
Boy's description of the spring is
sue which will hit the campus
selling-spots Wednesday.
"Only a limited number of these
sensational 44-page mags will be
available . . . and at the new low
price of 25 cents," claims Boris
Wolper, business manager.
