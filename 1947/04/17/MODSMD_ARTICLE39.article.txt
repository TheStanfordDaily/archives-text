Stanford's undefeated junior var
sity tenriis team continued its im
pressive record yesterday afternoon
in trouncing San Mateo Junior Col
lege, 8-1, on the local courts. The
Indians return to the net wars later
this month against San Jose State.
DOMINATE PLAY
Yesterday, the Stanford second
string completely dominated the
play while mowing down seven sin
gles victories and one of the two
doubles matches. The San Mateo
team managed to cop the first
doubles match, but only after the
locals had the match all tucked
away.
Tom Huffman operated at the
number one slot for the Indians
and took the feature match of the
day, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. His last-minute
rally swept through Sample of San
Mateo after the visitor had taken
the first set.
SNAP RACK
Late in the afternoon, when the
San Mateans finally found the
range, they took the first doubles
match under strong protest from
Indians Huffman and Norm Chris
tensen. The Junior Collegians took
the first set handily, 6-1, but the
second set was something else again.
Twenty-six games later the visitors
finally won out, 14-12. The mara
thon match went to San Mateo for
its first and only win of the day.
