BEN CARDINALLY, slugging Indian first baseman, laced a scorching double to right field in the lucky
seventh inning Tuesday afternoon to start the winning Stanford rally. Santa Clara and Stanford were all
lied up, 3-3, when Ben stepped to the plate and delivered a two-base hit. A moment later, Hen waltzed
home with the tie-breaking run on a single by pitched Dave Dahle. The Farm nine went on to chalk up a
4-15 victory, their second league win of the season. —Photo by Phil Welch
