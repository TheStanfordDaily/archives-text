# Late Stanford Rally Hands Cal Aggies 6-4 Whipping
## 
### 
Center fielder Lloyd Merriman lashed out a long triple and later
scored in the fifth inning to lead Stanford's diamond performers to a
lackadaisical 6 to 4 victory over the California Aggies yesterday afternoon
on the Sunken Diamond.
The visitors overcame a two-run- deficit in the third inning and forged

into a 3-2 lead. Later, in the fifth
they increased their margin to 4-2,
but the Indians roused themselves
and blasted in two runs to tie it back
up in their half of the same inning.
Then, in the seventh and eighth
innings, the Aggie fielding fell to
pieces and the Cardinals tallied once
in each frame to sew up the game,
their fourth victory in a row.
WOLF GETS CREDIT
Larry Wolf took over the mound
duties from starter Charlie Wake
! field in the fifth inning with a run
| ner on third and two out, and gained
| credit for the win as he set down
j the Aggies with one hit for the re
i mainder of the game.
The Aggies gained their temporary
; lead in the third on three hits and
| a walk after "the Farm" scored
i twice in the first. Pitcher Terry
Hutton waited out a walk and went
to second when Wakefield balked.
Jack Hutton connected with a sin
gle to send his brother to third.
After Jack Hutton pilfered sec
ond base, shortstop Brown drove
two runs home with a single. Brown
went on to steal second, and then
Nedderman slapped out another sin
gle and Brown scored. But that was
all for the visitors; Brocket - hit into
a double-play ball and the rally was
finished.
The Aggies baited the Indians

further in the fifth when they scored
their fourth run and took their
temporary two-run lead on a single,
a sacrifice, and a wild throw to
first.
INDIANS RALLY
The aroused Indians proceeded to
get down to business after this last
Aggie run. George Sloat started
the rally gping with a" walk with
one down. Buck Brownson struck
out, but Merriman hit the bottom
of the right field fence, driving in
Sloat and practically settling the
issue. Catcher Ward Walkup drove
Merriman home with a single, and
the Indians had tied up the game at
4-4.
Sloat opened the seventh inning
with a triple, followed by Merriman's
walk one out later. The Farm cen
ter fielder left the Aggie second
baseman Hanley holding the bag
when he stole second and then step
ped off the baseâ€”Hanley tried to
run Merriman down, the result being
a merry but unsuccessful chase to
third while Sloat took advantage of
the preoccupied Hanley to score
from third.
The final nail in the Aggie coffin,
came about through two errors, two
passed balls and a wild pitch in the
eighth.
