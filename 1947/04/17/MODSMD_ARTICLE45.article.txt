# Experience No Handicap To Snyder
## 
### TOM BURDICK 
A 1 Snyder, top-flight hurdler and
recently elected Indian track cap- ,
tain, certainly does not lack expe
rience in guiding the 1947 version of
Coach Jack Wei ersh a user 'a scanty
clads. The slim 6-ft. 141-lb. timber
topper lists among his top laurels
the 194G 1.C.4 A. low hurdle crown
with a mark ol 24.2 sees., set while
attending Dartmouth University un
der the Navy V-12 program.
TOI> HIGH HURDLER
As evidenced by his twin smash
ing victories in the high barriers in
the J.C. combine and San Jose
meets this year, Snyder has proven
that he's no slouch in the high sticks
either. His best mark in competition
in this event is 14.7, and although
he hasn't approached that figure as
yet, he should tag it before the sea
son's out.
ATHLETICS, NOT ALL
Snyder prepped at Hamilton High
I in L.A. where he was one of the
better hurdlers down south. His
j likeable personality doubtlessly
went a long way toward his election
as student body prexy in his senior
; year, and his ensuing appointment
to the Ephebian Society on the basis
: of scholarship, leadership, and serv
ice.
Uncle Sam let A 1 finish out one
\ summer quarter at Stanford before
thrusting him in the service. This
is Snyder's last hitch on "The Farm"
[ and apparently McGill Med School
; in Montreal, Canada, has the inside
track to his services. Trout fishing
| consumes as much free time as Al
can put to it in the way of a hobby.
