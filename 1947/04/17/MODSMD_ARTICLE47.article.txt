Double trouble hits the Stanford Tennis team this weekend as the
local netsters meet two of the strongest teams on the Coast. Tomorrow
afternoon Southern California visits the Farm courts, while a return match
with College of Pacific is scheduled for Saturday.
The Trojan invasion tomorrow rips the cover oft the 1947 Conference

season. According to the net handi
cappers, Southern California should
romp to the title with some argu
ment from their southern rivals, the
Bruins. California and Stanford
have both been shuffled into the
background in pre-season predic
j lions.
But the Farm entry must not be
! discounted from the Conference race
I this early in the going. Coach El
wyn Bugge has a constantly im
proving squad which is capable of
pulling a couple of upsets. First op
j portunity for the under-dog Cardi
! nals to knock off the giants of the
I Coast will be afforded this weekend.
Stanford enters tomorrow's meet
! with a pre-season record of one win
I and one loss against collegiate op
ponents. The pesky College of Pac
ific Tigers tripped the local net team
I in its 1947 debut, (i-3. But the out-
I come was hotly contested despite
j the high national standing of the
! Stockton team.
Last week the Indians came back
to crush Santa Clara, 7-2, in their
! opening Farm appearance. The ag
j gregation that Coach Bugge fielded
j for the Santa Clara match needed
polishing in various positions, but

the burly Cardinals swept through
the matches with power, if not
finesse.
Meanwhile, Southern California's
tennis record is an impressive one
of eight consecutive victories.
