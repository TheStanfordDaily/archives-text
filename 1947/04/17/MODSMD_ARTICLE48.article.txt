## Cardinals Fumble Again 
### 
Action of Cardinals Tuesday night in mak
ing no attempt to establish a definite plan for
the formulation of a Student-Administration
Forum clearly indicates this organization is not
willing to take the lead in promoting better
administration-student relationships.
Endorsed by faculty members and student
officers alike, the forum seeks to bring admin
istration leaders, alumni members of Stan
ford, and students together in a series of in
formal meetings to discuss plans that relate
both to the students and the university.
President Donald B. Tresidder at the all-
University assembly last January remarked
that he was in hopes that there could be bet
ter understanding between students and the
administration. A.S.S.U. President Martin An
derson has pointed out that there was a defin
ite attitude of misunderstanding between stu
dents and administration and that such a
forum could better relationships.
Other University officials, Dean of Students
John M. Stalnaker, Business Manager Alf E.
Brandin, and the Vice-President of the Uni
versity, Alvin C. Eurich, have expressed ap
proval of such a forum plan.
But most of the Cardinals were "too busy"
to tackle the problem. One member of the
group had not heard of the plan. Another
member wanted to know what evidence there

was to show why we needed such a forum.
Remarks were made that the idea sounded
like "something for the N.S.O. to handle" and
that the program was a "reminder of the
P.T.A."
One member was just plain "not interested"
in the idea. After an unenthusiastic discussion
the members agreed that perhaps the idea
would go over, but no one volunteered to take
over the job.
The whole meeting would have gone for
nothing had not a newly-appointed member
of Cardinals been delegated to formulate plans
to set up the forum.
But this is not enough. Had not the idea
of the Student-Administration Forum been en
dorsed by almost everyone concerned there
might be a guestion to the advisability of set
ting up such a plan.
The idea is of a sound, practical nature.
Rumor mongering, the spread of misinforma
tion concerning University policies, and the
criticism of the student government are prob
lems with which such a forum could effec
tively deal.
Evidently Cardinals is not too eager to
show interest or participate in a forum which
could help maintain the ideal of good student
faculty relationships and the rights of student
government.â€”D.K.
