### DAN ENDSLEY 
Henry Wallace is the "liberal" who has been
garnering the large headlines of late; Henderson has
dropped into relative obscurity. If influence is meas
ured in tons, then he has about three ounces of it. Yet
he is—and has always been—one of the most clear
thinking and logical men in public life.
He is now executive chairman of a group called

"Americans for Democratic Ac
tion" (of which you probably have
never heard) and is now in San
Francisco. In a recent interview J
he postulated the position of hisl
organization in regard to foreign
affairs.
First of all, ADA is supporting
the Truman Doctrine of aid to
Greece —with an important reser
vation. It favors turning the en
tire question over to UN as soon

as the latter body is strong enough to handle it.
(Of course that will be sometime in the vague
future, since UN is weak now and since some groups—
even in this country, unfortunately—seem bent on
keeping it weak.)
Henderson does not agree with high-flying Henry
at all. He said: "Wallace does not represent the
liberals and progressives of ADA. As a matter of

fact, wo are moving at about 180 degrees from him."
That's an exaggeration, since 180 degrees would
put ADA diametrically opposite to the small but
leather-lunged Wallace faction. Both Henderson
and Wallace want exactly the same thing—world
peace and an adequate international authority. They
disagree on their methods of attaining their common
objective. Henderson sounds like a man who has
thought the problem through from all angles, while
Wallace does not.
Henderson has delivered one of (he most intelli
gent statements on the situation that I have yet
seen:
"We don't believe we arc heading for war. We
can reach a working agreement with the U.S.S.R.,
but not through appeasement. Nor can we reach it
by automatically opposing everything Russia puts
forward."
Of See'y. Marshall he said he "represents pe
culiarly just what ADA believes."
That is encouraging and refreshing. Here is a
man who has held high public office who has not
succumbed to the wide-spread Communist-hating
hysteria which has led to innumerable cases of witch
hunting. nor is he so naive as to believe that co
operation can oe all on one side—that all we have
to do is show the world our hearts are in the right
place in order to achieve Utopia,
