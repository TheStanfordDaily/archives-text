To the Editor:
I would like to answer Mr. Norton's article of
April 15, 1947, appearing in "History 1947," in which
he discusses negatively a bill before Congress which
would increase subsistence allowances from $65.00
to $100.00 per month.
According to Mr. Norton, the reasons for defeat
ing this bill are: 1) impliedly, because the American
Veterans Committee has endorsed it; 2) "the propo
sition ... is fantastic"; 3) though the writer admits
that it's a "tight squeeze" to get by on $05.00 a month,
he asserts we have no right to "tap the public treas
ury" for any more. These, then, are Mr. Norton's
reasons for defeating this bill.
In speaking in affirmation of the proposed Con
gressional bill upping subsistence allowances, let
us take the financial statement of a veteran living at
Encina Hall. In one quarter he receives a subsistence
allowance of $195.00 (SO5 x 3). For this same quar
ter he is socked $135.00 for board, $42.50 for room,
and approximately $12.00 for textbooks—a total of
$189.50. This leaves him the sum total of $5.50 for
the remainder of the quarter. In eleven weeks, with
this $5.50. he must buy toilet articles such as soap,
toothpaste, and shave cream. In addition he must
pay for laundry and dry cleaning. It is safe to assume
that the veteran would show a marked deficit for the
quarter after miscellaneous needs were taken into
consideration and deducted. It does seem absurd,
therefore, to maintain that a veteran can subsist on
$65.00 per month alone.
On the other hand, i f is a fact that, very few. if
any. Stanford veterans are subsisting solely on this
allowance. Many vets are either working outside of
classes, sending home for money frequently, or
withdrawing capital from personal savings accounts.
In the calm consideration of $100.00 as a raise
from $05.00. it does seem a legitimate expenditure
for the following reasons: 1) it is presently not
possible to subsist normally on $65.00 per month
alone: 2) it will allow the veteran to devote his time
more proportionately to both academic and social
activities, because he will not have either to work
evening:; to help put himself through school, or stay
home over the weekends because of a shortage of
funds; and 3) the veteran will not be forced either
to wire home to relatives for cash, or withdraw from
his personal savings account preciously-accumulated
capital, saved during and Ix'fore the war years, in
order to bolster a meager governmental allowance.

The time has come to initiate a "RICH, BEAUTI
FUL PROSE DEPARTMENT" in our own Stanford

Daily. More specifically, I call to noticc the fiery
charade in HISTORY 1947 by Dan Endsley. My basal
metabolism rose to unprecedented heights when I
followed his dynamic rendition of the comings and
goings of Henry Wallace. First, he (Henry) was
"crammed down the throats of the delegates at the
Chicago convention." Then, "pulled through" by
F.D.R.'s prestige, he "brazened it out." Later, he
"muscled his way back in the Cabinet" but they
managed to "boot him out."
Endsley pointed out that Wallace thinks "emo
tionally. not logically" and I believe he (Endsley)
should be able to tell. By the time I had finished the
article I was an emotional wreck and ready to settle
down and think logically and my first thought was
that Dan Endsley would make a fine football coach.
His metaphor is more ideally geared for the endo
crincs and not for my morning Wheaties.

To the Editor:
If an AVC wastrel like myself be allowed to com
ment, I would like to dissolve some of the confusion
Ted Norton—in his usual form—may have created.
In the first place, the Stanford chapter of AVC
after lengthy debate approved an increase in sub
sistence allowances about six months ago. A proviso
was attached to the resolution to the efleet that such
ati increase is recommended in the event that Con
gress did not take effective measures to lower the
cost of living. Even Mr. Norton is familiar, I think,
with the direction of the cost-of-living index since
the abolition of price control.
Of course, I am not acquainted with Mr. Norton's
living habits, but. when he suggests that $65.00 per
month is ample to cover the minimum living require
ments of the average student, I am forced to con
elude either that he leads an exceedingly ethereal ex- |
istence, or that he possesses some budgetary secret I
uf which the rest of us are not aware. If the latter
be true, please, please, Mr. Norton, devote one of |
your columns to your technique, and give a boon |
to your readers!
My own uncomplicated arithmetic shows the fol- j
lowing: A Spartan diet costs a minimum of $1.75 ;
per day. (Unreasonable, Ted?) Using a slide rule, |
my result comes to $52.00 per month. Thus a balance !
of $12.50 is left lor rent. Do you know where I can j
find such a room? Not only are $05.00 inadequate for
Mr. Norton's beer, movies, Senior Ball, or even a !
milk shake, but the amount can at best keep us j
half-starved or sleeping in a pup tent.
To paraphrase Mr. Norton, at $05.00 a month, many
vets cannot even start school! »

The time has come to initiate a "RICH, BEAUTI
FUL PROSE DEPARTMENT" in our own Stanford

Daily. More specifically, I call to noticc the fiery
charade in HISTORY 1947 by Dan Endsley. My basal
metabolism rose to unprecedented heights when I
followed his dynamic rendition of the comings and
goings of Henry Wallace. First, he (Henry) was
"crammed down the throats of the delegates at the
Chicago convention." Then, "pulled through" by
F.D.R.'s prestige, he "brazened it out." Later, he
"muscled his way back in the Cabinet" but they
managed to "boot him out."
Endsley pointed out that Wallace thinks "emo
tionally. not logically" and I believe he (Endsley)
should be able to tell. By the time I had finished the
article I was an emotional wreck and ready to settle
down and think logically and my first thought was
that Dan Endsley would make a fine football coach.
His metaphor is more ideally geared for the endo
crincs and not for my morning Wheaties.

If an AVC wastrel like myself be allowed to com
ment, I would like to dissolve some of the confusion
Ted Norton—in his usual form—may have created.
In the first place, the Stanford chapter of AVC
after lengthy debate approved an increase in sub
sistence allowances about six months ago. A proviso
was attached to the resolution to the efleet that such
ati increase is recommended in the event that Con
gress did not take effective measures to lower the
cost of living. Even Mr. Norton is familiar, I think,
with the direction of the cost-of-living index since
the abolition of price control.
Of course, I am not acquainted with Mr. Norton's
living habits, but. when he suggests that $65.00 per
month is ample to cover the minimum living require
ments of the average student, I am forced to con
elude either that he leads an exceedingly ethereal ex- |
istence, or that he possesses some budgetary secret I
uf which the rest of us are not aware. If the latter
be true, please, please, Mr. Norton, devote one of |
your columns to your technique, and give a boon |
to your readers!
My own uncomplicated arithmetic shows the fol- j
lowing: A Spartan diet costs a minimum of $1.75 ;
per day. (Unreasonable, Ted?) Using a slide rule, |
my result comes to $52.00 per month. Thus a balance !
of $12.50 is left lor rent. Do you know where I can j
find such a room? Not only are $05.00 inadequate for
Mr. Norton's beer, movies, Senior Ball, or even a !
milk shake, but the amount can at best keep us j
half-starved or sleeping in a pup tent.
To paraphrase Mr. Norton, at $05.00 a month, many
vets cannot even start school! »

To the Editor:
I would like to answer Mr. Norton's article of
April 15, 1947, appearing in "History 1947," in which
he discusses negatively a bill before Congress which
would increase subsistence allowances from $65.00
to $100.00 per month.
According to Mr. Norton, the reasons for defeat
ing this bill are: 1) impliedly, because the American
Veterans Committee has endorsed it; 2) "the propo
sition ... is fantastic"; 3) though the writer admits
that it's a "tight squeeze" to get by on $05.00 a month,
he asserts we have no right to "tap the public treas
ury" for any more. These, then, are Mr. Norton's
reasons for defeating this bill.
In speaking in affirmation of the proposed Con
gressional bill upping subsistence allowances, let
us take the financial statement of a veteran living at
Encina Hall. In one quarter he receives a subsistence
allowance of $195.00 (SO5 x 3). For this same quar
ter he is socked $135.00 for board, $42.50 for room,
and approximately $12.00 for textbooks—a total of
$189.50. This leaves him the sum total of $5.50 for
the remainder of the quarter. In eleven weeks, with
this $5.50. he must buy toilet articles such as soap,
toothpaste, and shave cream. In addition he must
pay for laundry and dry cleaning. It is safe to assume
that the veteran would show a marked deficit for the
quarter after miscellaneous needs were taken into
consideration and deducted. It does seem absurd,
therefore, to maintain that a veteran can subsist on
$65.00 per month alone.
On the other hand, i f is a fact that, very few. if
any. Stanford veterans are subsisting solely on this
allowance. Many vets are either working outside of
classes, sending home for money frequently, or
withdrawing capital from personal savings accounts.
In the calm consideration of $100.00 as a raise
from $05.00. it does seem a legitimate expenditure
for the following reasons: 1) it is presently not
possible to subsist normally on $65.00 per month
alone: 2) it will allow the veteran to devote his time
more proportionately to both academic and social
activities, because he will not have either to work
evening:; to help put himself through school, or stay
home over the weekends because of a shortage of
funds; and 3) the veteran will not be forced either
to wire home to relatives for cash, or withdraw from
his personal savings account preciously-accumulated

To the Editor:
I would like to answer Mr. Norton's article of
April 15, 1947, appearing in "History 1947," in which
he discusses negatively a bill before Congress which
would increase subsistence allowances from $65.00
to $100.00 per month.
According to Mr. Norton, the reasons for defeat
ing this bill are: 1) impliedly, because the American
Veterans Committee has endorsed it; 2) "the propo
sition ... is fantastic"; 3) though the writer admits
that it's a "tight squeeze" to get by on $05.00 a month,
he asserts we have no right to "tap the public treas
ury" for any more. These, then, are Mr. Norton's
reasons for defeating this bill.
In speaking in affirmation of the proposed Con
gressional bill upping subsistence allowances, let
us take the financial statement of a veteran living at
Encina Hall. In one quarter he receives a subsistence
allowance of $195.00 (SO5 x 3). For this same quar
ter he is socked $135.00 for board, $42.50 for room,
and approximately $12.00 for textbooks—a total of
$189.50. This leaves him the sum total of $5.50 for
the remainder of the quarter. In eleven weeks, with
this $5.50. he must buy toilet articles such as soap,
toothpaste, and shave cream. In addition he must
pay for laundry and dry cleaning. It is safe to assume
that the veteran would show a marked deficit for the
quarter after miscellaneous needs were taken into
consideration and deducted. It does seem absurd,
therefore, to maintain that a veteran can subsist on
$65.00 per month alone.
On the other hand, i f is a fact that, very few. if
any. Stanford veterans are subsisting solely on this
allowance. Many vets are either working outside of
classes, sending home for money frequently, or
withdrawing capital from personal savings accounts.
In the calm consideration of $100.00 as a raise
from $05.00. it does seem a legitimate expenditure
for the following reasons: 1) it is presently not
possible to subsist normally on $65.00 per month
alone: 2) it will allow the veteran to devote his time
more proportionately to both academic and social
activities, because he will not have either to work
evening:; to help put himself through school, or stay
home over the weekends because of a shortage of
funds; and 3) the veteran will not be forced either
to wire home to relatives for cash, or withdraw from
his personal savings account preciously-accumulated
capital, saved during and Ix'fore the war years, in
order to bolster a meager governmental allowance.

The time has come to initiate a "RICH, BEAUTI
FUL PROSE DEPARTMENT" in our own Stanford

Daily. More specifically, I call to noticc the fiery
charade in HISTORY 1947 by Dan Endsley. My basal
metabolism rose to unprecedented heights when I
followed his dynamic rendition of the comings and
goings of Henry Wallace. First, he (Henry) was
"crammed down the throats of the delegates at the
Chicago convention." Then, "pulled through" by
F.D.R.'s prestige, he "brazened it out." Later, he
"muscled his way back in the Cabinet" but they
managed to "boot him out."
Endsley pointed out that Wallace thinks "emo
tionally. not logically" and I believe he (Endsley)
should be able to tell. By the time I had finished the
article I was an emotional wreck and ready to settle
down and think logically and my first thought was
that Dan Endsley would make a fine football coach.
His metaphor is more ideally geared for the endo
crincs and not for my morning Wheaties.

If an AVC wastrel like myself be allowed to com
ment, I would like to dissolve some of the confusion
Ted Norton—in his usual form—may have created.
In the first place, the Stanford chapter of AVC
after lengthy debate approved an increase in sub
sistence allowances about six months ago. A proviso
was attached to the resolution to the efleet that such
ati increase is recommended in the event that Con
gress did not take effective measures to lower the
cost of living. Even Mr. Norton is familiar, I think,
with the direction of the cost-of-living index since
the abolition of price control.
Of course, I am not acquainted with Mr. Norton's
living habits, but. when he suggests that $65.00 per
month is ample to cover the minimum living require
ments of the average student, I am forced to con
elude either that he leads an exceedingly ethereal ex- |
istence, or that he possesses some budgetary secret I
uf which the rest of us are not aware. If the latter
be true, please, please, Mr. Norton, devote one of |
your columns to your technique, and give a boon |
to your readers!
