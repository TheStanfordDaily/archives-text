Toyon and spread to Branner under
the direction of hall chairman Anne

"Donations have been coming in
from all over the campus," Miller
said. "We have received contribu
tions from all the men's and wom
en's halls. Branner has been espe
cially co-operative."
WOMEN'S CLOTHING, TOO
Miller went on to explain that
contributions from women's living
groups made possible the sending of
clothing to family units, whose
women need clothing as badly as
the men.
"We still need monetary contri
butions, both for postage for the
clothing packages and for CARE
packages," said Miller. "It costs
about $1.50 to send each 10-pound
package to Europe."
During the week, El Campo eating
club donated $7 for postage, while
El Tigrc gave $2(5 for CARE pack
ages.
NOT ONLY CLOTHES
"Clothing contributions are com
ing along nicely," stated Miller, "but
we really need school supplies, toi
let articles, and books. If you only [
have a bar of soap, drop it in the
collection box in the Toyon lobby. !
Every little bit is appreciated in Eu
rope."
The drive will continue for at
least another two weeks in order
that students may send home for old
clothing, according to Miller. "If
you have anything at all to give,!
drop it in the collection boxes either
in the Branner or Toyon lobbies," ;
he said. "If you want to give money t
for postage or for CARE packages,
put your donation in the small
boxes in the lobbies."

women need clothing as badly as
the men.
"We still need monetary contri
butions, both for postage for the
clothing packages and for CARE
packages," said Miller. "It costs
about $1.50 to send each 10-pound
package to Europe."
During the week, El Campo eating
club donated $7 for postage, while
El Tigrc gave $2(5 for CARE pack
ages.
NOT ONLY CLOTHES
"Clothing contributions are com
ing along nicely," stated Miller, "but
we really need school supplies, toi
let articles, and books. If you only [
have a bar of soap, drop it in the
collection box in the Toyon lobby. !
Every little bit is appreciated in Eu
rope."
The drive will continue for at
least another two weeks in order
that students may send home for old
clothing, according to Miller. "If
you have anything at all to give,!
drop it in the collection boxes either
in the Branner or Toyon lobbies," ;
he said. "If you want to give money t
for postage or for CARE packages,
put your donation in the small
boxes in the lobbies."
