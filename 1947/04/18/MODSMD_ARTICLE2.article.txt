# House Passes New Union Control Bill; Measure Bans Closed Shop Contracts
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 1 (AP). —The House today passed and
sent to the Senate the most rigid union control bill in American
Labor history, despite advance threats of a presidential veto.
The roll call vote was announced as 308 to 107, more than
enough to override a veto. It came after the House defeated,

291 to 122, a motion by Rep. Augus
tine B. Kellcy, D„ Pa., to send the
bill back to the Labor committee.
Besides invoking other curbs, the
measure outlaws closed shop con
tracts and industrywide bargaining,
two cardinal precepts of Labor doc
trine, and is the fruition of a Re
publican campaign pledge which
conservative Democrats helped them
carry out.' •
The far-reaching legislation is
much more rigorous than a Labor
reform bill approved late today by
the Senate Labor committee and
scheduled lor floor consideration
next week. The Senate bill pro
hibits the closed shop and allows the
union shop, but unlike the House
version, does nothing about indus
trywide bargaining.
It raises a major political issue
for the 1948 presidential campaign.
It the President vetoes the final
Senate-House version, Republican
ehieltains will try to override him.
It they can't amass the strength to
do that, they plan to lay the matter
before the voters and tell them that
Mr. Truman is solely responsible for
continued labor •management strife.
