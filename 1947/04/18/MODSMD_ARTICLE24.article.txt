# I.S.C. Representatives Present Views
## Farrer Outlines Faith in Survey 
### STUART MILLAR 
"Get me off the ivory tower," said
Bill Farrer. And the short, blond
co-winner of the proposed I.S.C.
trip stabbed his pencil at the law
book lying in front of him.
Talking in his cubbyhole counsel
or's room in Village 310 A, Farrer
was outlining his faith in the idea of
the summer survey.
MORE INTEREST
"They say this is an attempt to
create more interest in internation
al affairs at Stanford . . . but I con
ceive of this idea as far broader and
much more meaningful. We've got
to remember that if it goes over at
Stanford other colleges will take it
over and really make something
of it.
"This kind of idea means some
thing on a large scale only . . .
when several hundred students from
American colleges wilJ be able to
go to Europe in one summer . . .
you can't tell me that it wouldn't
have a telling effect.
"This could be a basic step in
forming the whole student body of
the United States into a powerful
body politic. You know, the United
States is one of the few countries
of the world where students don't
support and help define national
policy. No, that isn't to say that I
want a bunch of anarchistic stu
dents starting riots . . . but an in
telligently organized and respon
sible body of students exerting their
influence as a group ... so that it
would mean something.
"The I.S.C. is a definite step in
that direction . . . students must
realize that there Ls something more
important than next Saturday
night's date, something that vitally
affects them . . . vitally and funda
mentally."
LAW STUDENT
Farrer is a law student at Stan
ford and 24 years old. He talks fast
in a high voice. He has a curling
grin that starts on one side of his
face and spreads all over it. He
talks with his hands and wants you
to understand exactly what he
means.
He wants the Stanford students
to understand that he is grinding no
axe in his statement for the I.S.C.
"Sure I'd like to go . . . who would
n't? But I'm not that eager. Going
will mean that I can stay at Stan
ford a whole year longer and help
push along and develop the whole
program.
"You can't expect Shorty or me to
accomplish miracles if we go. You
can't lay this on the line . . . it's an
experiment . . .an awful lot can be
done. But I'm not a big wheel and
I'm not an expert and I'm not going
over to get the cure-all . . . the elixir
in my hip pocket.
"A bond of understanding . . .
that's it . . . mutural respect. I
want to get impressions, ideas, and
concepts. Then I want to try to
make Stanford students aware of
them.
PROSPECTIVE PLANS
"Toward this somewhat intangible
end, these are my prospective plans:
I would like to go right to the place
in which there is the greatest inter
est. The Russian problem is the big

one . . . but since we can't get to
Russia we should get to the next
closest place . . . like Czechoslova
kia. ... I want to go there instead
of Spain. The Czechs are a people
trying to get back on their feet and
they are faced with the choice of
Communism and Democracy. ... I
can see something there . . . and the
International Students' Conference
will be there . . . readymade for an
exchange of ideas . . . free exchange.
Farrer wanted to make himself
absolutely clear. "Sure, 1 w;int to
sell myself and sure I think I'm
qualified . . ." And his record tes
tifies to that:
Student, body president of U.C.-
LA., '42-'4 3.
Chairman, College Groups for
Warren, 104(5.
Aide-de-camp to the Command
ing General of the 33rd Division in
the Philippines.
Conducted tours for Secretary of
War Patterson, the House Naval Af
fairs Committee, and a Russian mis
sion in Japan.
JUST A START
Getting back to his original point,
Farrer said, "Don't measure the re
sults of the tour with a ruler. The
main thing is that it's a start. Don't
expect results one, two, three. Sure,
it should be judged by its results,
but not the first time . . . you've got
to lay the groundwork . . . you can't
rope students into Mem Aud and
MAKE them listen.
'"How can it prove its value? I'll
tell you. If this trip results in just
a little insight ... a little interest
provoked ... a little more good
will and understanding of impor
tant issues . . . then it has proved
its worth. If the students give it a
chance, I think it will."

LAW STUDENT
Farrer is a law student at Stan
ford and 24 years old. He talks fast
in a high voice. He has a curling
grin that starts on one side of his
face and spreads all over it. He
talks with his hands and wants you
to understand exactly what he
means.
He wants the Stanford students
to understand that he is grinding no
axe in his statement for the I.S.C.
"Sure I'd like to go . . . who would
n't? But I'm not that eager. Going
will mean that I can stay at Stan
ford a whole year longer and help
push along and develop the whole
program.
"You can't expect Shorty or me to
accomplish miracles if we go. You
can't lay this on the line . . . it's an
experiment . . .an awful lot can be
done. But I'm not a big wheel and
I'm not an expert and I'm not going
over to get the cure-all . . . the elixir
in my hip pocket.
"A bond of understanding . . .
that's it . . . mutural respect. I
want to get impressions, ideas, and
concepts. Then I want to try to
make Stanford students aware of
them.
PROSPECTIVE PLANS
"Toward this somewhat intangible
end, these are my prospective plans:
I would like to go right to the place
in which there is the greatest inter
est. The Russian problem is the big

one . . . but since we can't get to
Russia we should get to the next
closest place . . . like Czechoslova
kia. ... I want to go there instead
of Spain. The Czechs are a people
trying to get back on their feet and
they are faced with the choice of
Communism and Democracy. ... I
can see something there . . . and the
International Students' Conference
will be there . . . readymade for an
exchange of ideas . . . free exchange.
Farrer wanted to make himself
absolutely clear. "Sure, 1 w;int to
sell myself and sure I think I'm
qualified . . ." And his record tes
tifies to that:
Student, body president of U.C.-
LA., '42-'4 3.
Chairman, College Groups for
Warren, 104(5.
Aide-de-camp to the Command
ing General of the 33rd Division in
the Philippines.
Conducted tours for Secretary of
War Patterson, the House Naval Af
fairs Committee, and a Russian mis
sion in Japan.
JUST A START
Getting back to his original point,
Farrer said, "Don't measure the re
sults of the tour with a ruler. The
main thing is that it's a start. Don't
expect results one, two, three. Sure,
it should be judged by its results,
but not the first time . . . you've got
to lay the groundwork . . . you can't
rope students into Mem Aud and
MAKE them listen.
'"How can it prove its value? I'll
tell you. If this trip results in just
a little insight ... a little interest
provoked ... a little more good
will and understanding of impor
tant issues . . . then it has proved
its worth. If the students give it a
chance, I think it will."

that direction . . . students must
realize that there Ls something more
important than next Saturday
night's date, something that vitally
affects them . . . vitally and funda
mentally."
LAW STUDENT
Farrer is a law student at Stan
ford and 24 years old. He talks fast
in a high voice. He has a curling
grin that starts on one side of his
face and spreads all over it. He
talks with his hands and wants you
to understand exactly what he
means.
He wants the Stanford students
to understand that he is grinding no
axe in his statement for the I.S.C.
"Sure I'd like to go . . . who would
n't? But I'm not that eager. Going
will mean that I can stay at Stan
ford a whole year longer and help
push along and develop the whole
program.
"You can't expect Shorty or me to
accomplish miracles if we go. You
can't lay this on the line . . . it's an
experiment . . .an awful lot can be
done. But I'm not a big wheel and
I'm not an expert and I'm not going
over to get the cure-all . . . the elixir
in my hip pocket.
"A bond of understanding . . .
that's it . . . mutural respect. I
want to get impressions, ideas, and
concepts. Then I want to try to
make Stanford students aware of
them.
PROSPECTIVE PLANS
"Toward this somewhat intangible
end, these are my prospective plans:
I would like to go right to the place
in which there is the greatest inter
est. The Russian problem is the big

one . . . but since we can't get to
Russia we should get to the next
closest place . . . like Czechoslova
kia. ... I want to go there instead
of Spain. The Czechs are a people
trying to get back on their feet and
they are faced with the choice of
Communism and Democracy. ... I
can see something there . . . and the
International Students' Conference
will be there . . . readymade for an
exchange of ideas . . . free exchange.
Farrer wanted to make himself
absolutely clear. "Sure, 1 w;int to
sell myself and sure I think I'm
qualified . . ." And his record tes
tifies to that:
Student, body president of U.C.-
LA., '42-'4 3.
Chairman, College Groups for
Warren, 104(5.
Aide-de-camp to the Command
ing General of the 33rd Division in
the Philippines.
Conducted tours for Secretary of
War Patterson, the House Naval Af
fairs Committee, and a Russian mis
sion in Japan.
JUST A START
Getting back to his original point,
Farrer said, "Don't measure the re
sults of the tour with a ruler. The
main thing is that it's a start. Don't
expect results one, two, three. Sure,
it should be judged by its results,
but not the first time . . . you've got
to lay the groundwork . . . you can't
rope students into Mem Aud and
MAKE them listen.
'"How can it prove its value? I'll
tell you. If this trip results in just
a little insight ... a little interest
provoked ... a little more good
will and understanding of impor
tant issues . . . then it has proved
its worth. If the students give it a
chance, I think it will."

"Something more important than
next Saturday's date"
"Get me off the ivory tower," said
Bill Farrer. And the short, blond
co-winner of the proposed I.S.C.
trip stabbed his pencil at the law
book lying in front of him.
Talking in his cubbyhole counsel
or's room in Village 310 A, Farrer
was outlining his faith in the idea of
the summer survey.
MORE INTEREST
"They say this is an attempt to
create more interest in internation
al affairs at Stanford . . . but I con
ceive of this idea as far broader and
much more meaningful. We've got
to remember that if it goes over at
Stanford other colleges will take it
over and really make something
of it.
"This kind of idea means some
thing on a large scale only . . .
when several hundred students from
American colleges wilJ be able to
go to Europe in one summer . . .
you can't tell me that it wouldn't
have a telling effect.
"This could be a basic step in
forming the whole student body of
the United States into a powerful
body politic. You know, the United
States is one of the few countries
of the world where students don't
support and help define national
policy. No, that isn't to say that I
want a bunch of anarchistic stu
dents starting riots . . . but an in
telligently organized and respon
sible body of students exerting their
influence as a group ... so that it
would mean something.
