# Grannis Promises Results for I.S.C.
## 
### STUART MILLAR 
'If we go to Europe this summer
we won't be like those wartime for
eign correspondents who went to a
country for two weeks, looked
around a little, and came back to
the U.S. as self-styled experts on
cultural, social, economic, and po
litical aspects of the country," said
Lawrence "Shorty" Grannis, who
will travel to France this summer
i! the I.S.C. is approved next week.
"Can we dig up facts and do a
better objective xeporting job than
qualified news bureau men who
have been in the scene for years?
No . . . we won't attempt to.
PERSONAL TOUCH
"But can we bring home to Stan
ford students that which we have to
offer in a much more successful and
effective way? Yes, I think we can
do that , .
Grannis was talking in a low, se- (
rious voice. He was half-sitting,
half-lying on a couch in the Nitery.
And he was trying hard to phrase
his words carefully.
Shorty is a guy with a quick
smile. He says something and he I
smiles quickly and he turns his
hands palms up and he looks at yon.
'15-MINUTE TREATMENT'
"Another thing we don't want to
get is the 15-minute treatment. You
know what I mean. You meet some
one like De Gaulle, you shake
hands with him . . . maybe you get
your picture taken. He says, 'France
ar\d America forever.' You shake
hands again and that's it.
"We want to get to that second \
level of personalities who are sig- j
nificant and important and yet have j
time to talk to you . . . like news
puper editors, business officials, and j
tcachers.
"And when we get back to Stan- j
ford we want to submit the most j
complete report possible ... a com
plete report about the concrete ob
jective we have picked. In my case j
that will be to examine the conflict I
of the Right and the Left in France,
make contacts for future trips, and
set up the preliminaries for a wide
: cale exchange student program.
WELL QUALIFIED
Grannis is well qualified to make
the flip if it is approved in the com
ing election. He is a Phi B»ta Kap
pa, a member of the champ debating
;r:aad that toured the country a few
years back, and is now in law
school. ' T I
"'We hope the students don't get
the idea that they would be sending i
us on a vacation. Europe won't be
much of a vacation spot for anyone
this year . . . there's too much mis
ery over there.
"Yes, the whole I.S.C. can still be
shelved after we come back ... if
we fumble the ball. While we're
not experts, I know Bill's been
around some and I won't be a stran
ger in a foreign country.
"But it's all up to the students.
If they want to send us, we'd like to
go. 1 hope we can do a job for them
. . . if they give us a chance."
