## 
### 
Dr. Joseph S. Davis, director of the Stanford Food Research Institute,
upheld the importance of individual and pro up enterprise in speaking
yesterday before the American Association ol University Women conven
tion at Fort Worth, Texas.
"Never before has any nation, great or small, been so richly leavened

as the United States in the 1940s is
leavened by its university women,"
lie declared.
"More easily than less fortunate
women, you can rise above petti
ness, cattincss, and what Thor
stein Veblen called 'conspicuous
waste.'
NEED PERSPECTIVE
"You can, if you will, cultivate
perspective instead ol' prejudices,
rout fears with solid thinking, and
replace shallow optimism by well
based confidence. These are invalu
able assets. America, and the world,
sorely need to have them invested
and re-invested for the general
good," he continued.
Dr. Davis, in speaking of the im
portance of university women in
political life, said, "Do not, I beg
you, fall prey to the fallacy that
nothing any one person can do will
make any difference, locally or na
tionally.
ENTERPRISE IMPORTANT
"Such a view can make your good
leaven useless. My whole experi
ence and observation attest to the
importance of individual and group
enterprise—in home life, in commu
nity affairs, and on state and na
tional issues, as well as in the busi
ness world.
"Increasingly general and skillful
resort to polls of opinion, public
and private, is expanding the influ
ence of individual attitudes.
PROCESS SLOW
"Of course, you will not expect
your little lever to move the world
al once, but the cumulative effect of
your use of it. can be great.
The university women of Amer
ica can, if they will, play an ever
larger role in solving the economic
and social problems of our times,"
he concluded.
