"Row men must be alerted re
garding burglaries," declared cam
pus Police Chief Gordon Davit,.
"Unless all precautions are taken,
further petty thefts imminent."
Stanford has been fortunate so
far, according to Davis. On other
campuses in the Bay Area, espe
cially at the University of Califor
nia, the problem has become a ma
jor one. "The primary danger pe
riod is shortly after the first of the
month when veterans have cashed
their subsistence checks," Davis
concluded.
