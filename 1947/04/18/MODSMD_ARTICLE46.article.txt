# Economic Outlook Good For This Year, Hadley Says
## 
### 
"The economic outlook for the rest of 1947 is favorable, Dr. Clausin
D. Hadley said last night at a meeting of the San Francisco branch of the
American Marketing Association.
Dr. Hadley i.s acting assistant professor of business statistics in the Start
ford Graduate School of Business. He is also the West Coast representa-

tive of the Econometrics Institute,
Inc., which is a management con-i
suiting firm.
OUTLOOK GOOD
The outlook for this year in the
Institute's December 1940 report
was good "because those industry
groups most sensitive to depression
were in a strong position, and," Dr.
Hadley added, "most businessmen '
had put their houses in order."
The report predicted that whole
sale prices would show a mild up
ward trend by July, but that con
sumer prices would remain at the
same level reached • in the last part
of 194(5.
PRODUCTION INCREASE
Production will increase only
gradually this year because of lim
itations in equipment, materials, and 1
labor," Hadley said.
Competition will become greater
because consumers are closer to
their pre-war spending patterns.
TWO CORRECTIONS
The forecast for 1948 continues
good provided Congress recognizes
and corrects two serious maladjust
ments:
1. Excessive personal taxes lead
ing to too rapid debt retirement.
f2. Rents on existing residential
properties are too low in relation to
thf cost of new construction.
WAGE KATES UP
"The general pattern of wage
rates is not likely to decline in the
near future," Dr. Hadley told the
executives.
A large part of the price increases
of the past six months were due to
the closing of the gap imposed by
the OPA between actual prices and
those justified by increased cost and
consumer income. "But,"' Professor
Hadley concluded, "profits in mosi
industries are high enough to ab
sorb most of the wage increases (8
to 12 per cent) without price in
creases.'
