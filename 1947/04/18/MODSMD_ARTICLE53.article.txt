Golf is a major sport at Stanford.
And still the golf team has not yet
I een officially recognized as a
"major" sport and Farm golfers
have to be content with circle S
. umerals.
Since the undergrad days of Law
>n Little, Stanford golfers and the
tanford golf team has made banner
headlines throughout the country.
I'ince Eddie Twiggs became golf
( oach in 1931, the Indians have won ■
National Championships, 10 Pac
ific Coast Championships, over 90' '
of their dual matches, and 14 out
"112 IS of their matches with the
Berkeley Branch of U.C.
INDIANS DOMINATE
The Farm's almost complete dom
ination of Pacific Coast and National
intercollegiate golf competition has
been a valuable source of favorable
publicity to the University. Golf
has carried Stanford's name across!
ihe Atlantic. When Lawson Little j
won the British and American Ama
eur Championships in 1934 and 1935
lie was representing the Indian golf
team. And Lawson wasn't even
i rst man of the Farm's team some of
the time that he was recognized as
the outstanding amateur golfer in the
\'orld. He had to battle for his posi
tion and played third man much of
the time.
1000 GOLFERS
Golf interest at the Farm is not
i miled to varsity competition. Close j
1 > 1000 students, men and women,
duffers and hotshots, trek up to
Stanford golf course, which is rec
ognized as one of the best cared
for and toughest links in the world.
187 men are enrolled in golf classes,
and over G5O students play on the
Farm links regularly, as seen by the
huge sale of student golf tickets
every quarter.
This amazing student participa
tion in golf is a large source of reve
nue to the University. Golf makes
more money than any other "minor"
sport and than most of the "ma
jor" sports at Stanford.
Al Masters, Graduate Manager of
Athletics, has expressed his approval
of the plan to officially recognize
golf as a major sport. The golf team
is going to present its plan to Exeom
Wednesday night and I can't see
how that body can turn them down.
GOLF IS A MAJOR SPORT
If being a "major" sport means
Pacific Coast and National Collegi
ate competitive success, if it means
the amount and quality of the pub
licity which the sport brings, if it
means the number of students who
are interested in, and participate
in the sport, if it means the quality
of the sports playing field and facil
ities, if it means the amount of time
and skill required by the sport, if it
means the national importance of the
sport, il it means any of these things,
then golf is a major sport at Stan
ford.

All the City papers are applaud
ing the appointment of Ray Lunny
as head boxing coach at the Farm.
The former State Lightweight champ
made a lot of friends as well as an I
outstanding amateur and professional j
ring record.
Lunny turned pro in 1938 after !
losing only three out of 40 amateur
bouts. As a pro he won 35 straight
fights, finally losing to the World's
Lightweight king, Chalky Wright,
in 1941.
In Friday's Daily we ran the slory
of Lunny's appointment, but we
tied up and put an extra e in his
name. Its Lunnv. not Lunney.
Apologies to Ray and to Don Lei
bendorfer, S.A.C. publicity director.

H. D. Thoreau, of Bull Session
lame, was recently appointed full
time assistant to Victor O. Schmidt,
Pacific Coast Conference Commis
sioner. H. D.. who was Sports Editor
of the Daily in 1941-42 and gradu
ated from the Stanford School of
journalism, will have charge of press
.statistical material released from the
Commissioner's office, and will assist
Schmidt in other general duties.

One of the more laughable stories I
(he Daily s United Press ticker has
produced in a long time came over
the wire last Thursday. It seems a
New Hampshire Legislative Commit
tee approved a bill abolishing slate
wrestling on grounds that it comes
under the heading of vaudeville,
rather than sports. Man Mountain I
Dean- better hurry up and join the I
Actor's Guild.
