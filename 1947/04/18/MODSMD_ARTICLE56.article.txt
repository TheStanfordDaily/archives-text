# WHAT IS A UNITARIAN?
## 
### 
. .UNITARIANS SEE MAN, not as
a helpless victim of original sin,
but as possessing within himself
unmeasured possibilities for growth
in wisdom and character. They re
spect the divinity in man's soul.
If, with a faith roofed in unshake
able ideals of truth, goodness and
service, you strive for the better
ment of character and for the ad
vancement of man, the Unitarian
church believes that you are a
truly religious person.
Unitarianism assists your religi
ous development by drawing spiri
tual vitality from the deepest wis
dom of all the religious, intellectual
and cultural movements of man
kind.
"The Unitarian Church has no
arbitrary boundaries, it is opposed
to any check upon human thought.
It seeks to direct human thinking
towards betterment of the indi
vidual, the family, the community,
the nation, and humanity gener
ally."—Harry B. Mitchell, Presi
dent, U.S. Civil Service Commis
sion.
