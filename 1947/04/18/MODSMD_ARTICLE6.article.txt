concert.
The closing number, "Concerto in
F," from the Gershwin music, pro

classic, and the compromise of the

by Elizabeth Spies.

in "Ceremonial," were a strong
feature, and danced with great case

"Red Roses," a quaint folk song
sung by Jack Taylor and choreo
graphed by Mary Pat Sawyer, and
"Yea. Thee and Me." choreograohed
by Mary Martin, were very well re

"Big Bear Stomp," an admirable
satire on modern boogie, based on
the music of Lu Walters and choreo
graphed by Barbara Peyser was the
most comical dance of the evening.

novel, "The Scarlet Letter" very
