# Indian Trackmen Tackle Powerful Olympic Club; Underdog Farm Netmen to Battle Trojans Tigers
## 
### JOHN HUBBARD BOB BULLOCK 
The king size crowd expected to be on hand at Angell Field
tomorrow afternoon for the Sianford-Olympic Club track meet
may not see the greatest competitive clash of the year, but they
are certain to see a wonderful show. As an added attraction,
assistant coach Cornelius "Dutch" Warmerdam will put on an

exhibition pole vault performance.
Dink Templeton's "Winged-O"
squad is about the closest thing to
an athletic three-ring circus on the
Pacific Coast.
Although no actual list of entries
has been received from the Olympic
Club, all three "rings will probably
be loaded with famous personages
in the track world.
For instance, in the track event
"ring" Tcmpleton hopes to use Hal
Davis, one of the greatest sprinters
of all lime. Davis, at the University
of California before the war, legged
the 100 yd. dash in 9.4 seconds,
equaling the world's record. This
season, in workouts, he's done 9.9—
reportedly breezing.
MOORE TO HI RULE
Then there's 33-yoar-old Tom
Moore, the oldest active huruler in
the United States. Moore has natu
rally lost some of his speed since his
younger days, but he can still nudge
15 seconds in the highs and 25 sec
onds in the lows.
In the jumping events, the Olympic
Club lists on its roster Willard
Smith, Irving Moore, and Guinn
Smith. Willard Smith, a former
Stanford track man, holds the fill
time University high jump record at
6 feet 7 ! i inches.
Guinn Smith and Irving Moore,
two top-flight pole vaulters, are
almost certain entries in the meet.
Smith went 14 feet 6 inches at Mo
deslo Li-l week (lie highest vault in
competition in the United States this
season.
Martin Biles and Lowell Todd are
tentatively billed as headline per
formers in tho throwing "ring."
Both are javelin specialists, and each
can do well over 200 feet.
CONNIE ON EXHIBITION
As if all this wasn't enough,
"Dutch" Warmerdam will vault as an
exhibition. Warmerdam has a mon
opoly on the world's vaulting records
— he holds the indoor title at 15 feet
Br'.;8 r '.; inches, and the outdoor at 15
feet 7 i inches.
He's the only man who has ever
cleared the bar ,at 15 feet or above,
and he's accomplished that feat 44
times.
In practice this year Warmerdam

has reached the very respectable
height of 14 feet 8 inches.
Tlic actual point-gathering busi
ness of the afternoon should pro
vide its share of thrills, too. Best
race of the day is looked for in the
880, with Stanford's ace, George
Grimes, matching strides with the
Olympic's Bob Lehman. Grimes has
been clocked at 1:54.7 this season,
and Lehman at 1:56.7.
GANAHL AND GIRARD
Another heated argument is ex
pected in the mile between the In
dians' Frank Ganahl and Marston
"Mushy" Girard, of the Olympic
Club. Girard, running for Stanford
in 1940, pared his time down to 4:12.9.
His best mark for this campaign is
4.20. Ganahl's peak performance
to date is 4:24.7.
Girard, an accomplished half
miler as well, will probably not ap
pear in that event tomorrow.
VITAL STATISTICS
Festivities are scheduled to get
under way at 1:45 p.m., with the
first track event—the mile—slated
for 2. Admission for non- student
body card holders is $1.20.
Probable Stanford entries:
100 Maxwell, Smith, Vierthaler,
Wood or McKillip.
220 —Maxwell, Smith, Vierthaler,
F. Johnson.
440—Hoff, F. Johnson, Reynolds,
Greenleaf or Mclnerny or Wilkins.
880—Grimes, Holubar, Off, Wag
ner.
Mile —Ganahl, G. Johnson, Davis,
Mueller.

otti, Hjelte.
Relay—Four selected from Wil
kins, Reynolds, Grimes. Holubar,
Maxwell.

Stanford's unpredictable tennis team tears into the two leading net teams of the West Coast
, on successive days, today and tomorrow, in an ambitious—but terrifying—schedule arrangement.
This afternoon at 1:30, the Indians join with Southern California in inaugurating the 1947
Conference schedule on the local courts. Then, without stopping for breath, Stanford battles the
powerful College of Pacific Tigers tomorrow in a rematch of an earlier Tiger victory.

Gunning for their ninth PCC
Southern Division tennis title South
j em California's wondermen will en
' ter today's clash as heavy favor
j ites. In fact, the boys from Troy
j have practically been awarded the
! Conference title already, it' you wish
I to believe (he flowery news copy
I pouring from the Southland. No team
; can be THAT good.
The Indians have had their ups
j and downs this season, but their
improvement has been encouraging
I to Coach Elwyn Bugge. So far, the
| locals are batting .500, with one loss
! and one win. College of Pacific ad
ministered the defeat, 6-3; while
| Santa Clara submitted to a 7-2 drub
bing at the hands of Stanford.

SAN FRANCISCO, April 17
(UP). —The favored University of
j Southern California tenuis team
swept its way through seven
| matches today to down Univer
; sity of San Francisco, 7 to 2.

Unfortunately for Farm tennis
j followers, the Trojan net record has
i been nothing short of sensational.
Eight successive times Southern Cal
has prevailed over its opponent, with
| most of the victories being of a de
j cisive nature. The lengthy string
j of conquests gives the Indians a
; tempting target to upset, but the
I Trojans will be just as determined
I to keep the record intact.
Prime gold star on the S.C. win
! list marks the 7-2 spanking the Tro
| jans gave to sassy College of Pa
! cific. The Tigers from Stockton trav
| eled to Los Angeles with illusions

of unseating the championship Troy j
squad. After the powerful Trojans j
mopped up the court with them, the
Tigers limped through a 4"/< all tie
with the U.C.L.A. Bruins.
Whether the Tigers from COP
have slipped from their high Coast
standing remains to be seen. To
morrow's grudge battle with Stan
ford may supply the answer.
Revenge motivates the increased
hustle on the Indian squad as they
prepare for the Pacific match. That
early season 6-3 loss to the Stock
ton still rankles the Cardinals, who
nearly upset the high-flying Tigers.
Added interest to tomorrow's re
turn match was assured when COP
turned in a 6-3 victory over Califor
i nia Wednesday afternoon. By com
: parative scores, the Indian-Bear
meeting later in the season will be
extremely close. Stanford hopes to
nudge the statisticians with a better
i score tomorrow and thus whip the
j Bears - at least on paper.

Stanford's unpredictable tennis team tears into the two leading net teams of the West Coast
, on successive days, today and tomorrow, in an ambitious—but terrifying—schedule arrangement.
This afternoon at 1:30, the Indians join with Southern California in inaugurating the 1947
Conference schedule on the local courts. Then, without stopping for breath, Stanford battles the
powerful College of Pacific Tigers tomorrow in a rematch of an earlier Tiger victory.

Gunning for their ninth PCC
Southern Division tennis title South
j em California's wondermen will en
' ter today's clash as heavy favor
j ites. In fact, the boys from Troy
j have practically been awarded the
! Conference title already, it' you wish
I to believe (he flowery news copy
I pouring from the Southland. No team
; can be THAT good.
The Indians have had their ups
j and downs this season, but their
improvement has been encouraging
I to Coach Elwyn Bugge. So far, the
| locals are batting .500, with one loss
! and one win. College of Pacific ad
ministered the defeat, 6-3; while
| Santa Clara submitted to a 7-2 drub
bing at the hands of Stanford.

SAN FRANCISCO, April 17
(UP). —The favored University of
j Southern California tenuis team
swept its way through seven
| matches today to down Univer
; sity of San Francisco, 7 to 2.

Unfortunately for Farm tennis
j followers, the Trojan net record has
i been nothing short of sensational.
Eight successive times Southern Cal
has prevailed over its opponent, with
| most of the victories being of a de
j cisive nature. The lengthy string
j of conquests gives the Indians a
; tempting target to upset, but the
I Trojans will be just as determined
I to keep the record intact.
Prime gold star on the S.C. win
! list marks the 7-2 spanking the Tro
| jans gave to sassy College of Pa
! cific. The Tigers from Stockton trav
| eled to Los Angeles with illusions

of unseating the championship Troy j
squad. After the powerful Trojans j
mopped up the court with them, the
Tigers limped through a 4"/< all tie
with the U.C.L.A. Bruins.
Whether the Tigers from COP
have slipped from their high Coast
standing remains to be seen. To
morrow's grudge battle with Stan
ford may supply the answer.
Revenge motivates the increased
hustle on the Indian squad as they
prepare for the Pacific match. That
early season 6-3 loss to the Stock
ton still rankles the Cardinals, who
nearly upset the high-flying Tigers.
Added interest to tomorrow's re
turn match was assured when COP
turned in a 6-3 victory over Califor
i nia Wednesday afternoon. By com
: parative scores, the Indian-Bear
meeting later in the season will be
extremely close. Stanford hopes to
nudge the statisticians with a better
i score tomorrow and thus whip the
j Bears - at least on paper.

FRANKLIN "PITCH" JOHNSON"—one of the Farm's ace quar
termilcrs who will run against the Olympic Club tomorrow. "Pitch"
is the son of "Pitch" Johnson, former Stanford track Coach.
—Photo b\ Bob Dillon
The king size crowd expected to be on hand at Angell Field
tomorrow afternoon for the Sianford-Olympic Club track meet
may not see the greatest competitive clash of the year, but they
are certain to see a wonderful show. As an added attraction,
assistant coach Cornelius "Dutch" Warmerdam will put on an

exhibition pole vault performance.
Dink Templeton's "Winged-O"
squad is about the closest thing to
an athletic three-ring circus on the
Pacific Coast.
Although no actual list of entries
has been received from the Olympic
Club, all three "rings will probably
be loaded with famous personages
in the track world.
For instance, in the track event
"ring" Tcmpleton hopes to use Hal
Davis, one of the greatest sprinters
of all lime. Davis, at the University
of California before the war, legged
the 100 yd. dash in 9.4 seconds,
equaling the world's record. This
season, in workouts, he's done 9.9—
reportedly breezing.
MOORE TO HI RULE
Then there's 33-yoar-old Tom
Moore, the oldest active huruler in
the United States. Moore has natu
rally lost some of his speed since his
younger days, but he can still nudge
15 seconds in the highs and 25 sec
onds in the lows.
In the jumping events, the Olympic
Club lists on its roster Willard
Smith, Irving Moore, and Guinn
Smith. Willard Smith, a former
Stanford track man, holds the fill
time University high jump record at
6 feet 7 ! i inches.
Guinn Smith and Irving Moore,
two top-flight pole vaulters, are
almost certain entries in the meet.
Smith went 14 feet 6 inches at Mo
deslo Li-l week (lie highest vault in
competition in the United States this
season.
Martin Biles and Lowell Todd are
tentatively billed as headline per
formers in tho throwing "ring."
Both are javelin specialists, and each
can do well over 200 feet.
CONNIE ON EXHIBITION
As if all this wasn't enough,
"Dutch" Warmerdam will vault as an
exhibition. Warmerdam has a mon
opoly on the world's vaulting records
— he holds the indoor title at 15 feet
Br'.;8 r '.; inches, and the outdoor at 15
feet 7 i inches.
He's the only man who has ever
cleared the bar ,at 15 feet or above,
and he's accomplished that feat 44
times.
In practice this year Warmerdam

has reached the very respectable
height of 14 feet 8 inches.
Tlic actual point-gathering busi
ness of the afternoon should pro
vide its share of thrills, too. Best
race of the day is looked for in the
880, with Stanford's ace, George
Grimes, matching strides with the
Olympic's Bob Lehman. Grimes has
been clocked at 1:54.7 this season,
and Lehman at 1:56.7.
GANAHL AND GIRARD
Another heated argument is ex
pected in the mile between the In
dians' Frank Ganahl and Marston
"Mushy" Girard, of the Olympic
Club. Girard, running for Stanford
in 1940, pared his time down to 4:12.9.
His best mark for this campaign is
4.20. Ganahl's peak performance
to date is 4:24.7.
Girard, an accomplished half
miler as well, will probably not ap
pear in that event tomorrow.
VITAL STATISTICS
Festivities are scheduled to get
under way at 1:45 p.m., with the
first track event—the mile—slated
for 2. Admission for non- student
body card holders is $1.20.
Probable Stanford entries:

The king size crowd expected to be on hand at Angell Field
tomorrow afternoon for the Sianford-Olympic Club track meet
may not see the greatest competitive clash of the year, but they
are certain to see a wonderful show. As an added attraction,
assistant coach Cornelius "Dutch" Warmerdam will put on an

exhibition pole vault performance.
Dink Templeton's "Winged-O"
squad is about the closest thing to
an athletic three-ring circus on the
Pacific Coast.
Although no actual list of entries
has been received from the Olympic
Club, all three "rings will probably
be loaded with famous personages
in the track world.
For instance, in the track event
"ring" Tcmpleton hopes to use Hal
Davis, one of the greatest sprinters
of all lime. Davis, at the University
of California before the war, legged
the 100 yd. dash in 9.4 seconds,
equaling the world's record. This
season, in workouts, he's done 9.9—
reportedly breezing.
MOORE TO HI RULE
Then there's 33-yoar-old Tom
Moore, the oldest active huruler in
the United States. Moore has natu
rally lost some of his speed since his
younger days, but he can still nudge
15 seconds in the highs and 25 sec
onds in the lows.
In the jumping events, the Olympic
Club lists on its roster Willard
Smith, Irving Moore, and Guinn
Smith. Willard Smith, a former
Stanford track man, holds the fill
time University high jump record at
6 feet 7 ! i inches.
Guinn Smith and Irving Moore,
two top-flight pole vaulters, are
almost certain entries in the meet.
Smith went 14 feet 6 inches at Mo
deslo Li-l week (lie highest vault in
competition in the United States this
season.
Martin Biles and Lowell Todd are
tentatively billed as headline per
formers in tho throwing "ring."
Both are javelin specialists, and each
can do well over 200 feet.
CONNIE ON EXHIBITION
As if all this wasn't enough,
"Dutch" Warmerdam will vault as an
exhibition. Warmerdam has a mon
opoly on the world's vaulting records
— he holds the indoor title at 15 feet
Br'.;8 r '.; inches, and the outdoor at 15
feet 7 i inches.
He's the only man who has ever
cleared the bar ,at 15 feet or above,
and he's accomplished that feat 44
times.
In practice this year Warmerdam

has reached the very respectable
height of 14 feet 8 inches.
Tlic actual point-gathering busi
ness of the afternoon should pro
vide its share of thrills, too. Best
race of the day is looked for in the
880, with Stanford's ace, George
Grimes, matching strides with the
Olympic's Bob Lehman. Grimes has
been clocked at 1:54.7 this season,
and Lehman at 1:56.7.
GANAHL AND GIRARD
Another heated argument is ex
pected in the mile between the In
dians' Frank Ganahl and Marston
"Mushy" Girard, of the Olympic
Club. Girard, running for Stanford
in 1940, pared his time down to 4:12.9.
His best mark for this campaign is
4.20. Ganahl's peak performance
to date is 4:24.7.
Girard, an accomplished half
miler as well, will probably not ap
pear in that event tomorrow.
VITAL STATISTICS
Festivities are scheduled to get
under way at 1:45 p.m., with the
first track event—the mile—slated
for 2. Admission for non- student
body card holders is $1.20.
Probable Stanford entries:
100 Maxwell, Smith, Vierthaler,
Wood or McKillip.
220 —Maxwell, Smith, Vierthaler,
F. Johnson.
440—Hoff, F. Johnson, Reynolds,
Greenleaf or Mclnerny or Wilkins.
880—Grimes, Holubar, Off, Wag
ner.
Mile —Ganahl, G. Johnson, Davis,
Mueller.
Two-mile—Ganahl, Lyons.

Relay—Four selected from Wil
kins, Reynolds, Grimes. Holubar,
Maxwell.

Stanford's unpredictable tennis team tears into the two leading net teams of the West Coast
, on successive days, today and tomorrow, in an ambitious—but terrifying—schedule arrangement.
This afternoon at 1:30, the Indians join with Southern California in inaugurating the 1947
Conference schedule on the local courts. Then, without stopping for breath, Stanford battles the
powerful College of Pacific Tigers tomorrow in a rematch of an earlier Tiger victory.

Gunning for their ninth PCC
Southern Division tennis title South
j em California's wondermen will en
' ter today's clash as heavy favor
j ites. In fact, the boys from Troy
j have practically been awarded the
! Conference title already, it' you wish
I to believe (he flowery news copy
I pouring from the Southland. No team
; can be THAT good.
The Indians have had their ups
j and downs this season, but their
improvement has been encouraging
I to Coach Elwyn Bugge. So far, the
| locals are batting .500, with one loss
! and one win. College of Pacific ad
ministered the defeat, 6-3; while
| Santa Clara submitted to a 7-2 drub
bing at the hands of Stanford.

SAN FRANCISCO, April 17
(UP). —The favored University of
j Southern California tenuis team
swept its way through seven
| matches today to down Univer
; sity of San Francisco, 7 to 2.

Unfortunately for Farm tennis
j followers, the Trojan net record has
i been nothing short of sensational.
Eight successive times Southern Cal
has prevailed over its opponent, with
| most of the victories being of a de
j cisive nature. The lengthy string
j of conquests gives the Indians a
; tempting target to upset, but the
I Trojans will be just as determined
I to keep the record intact.
Prime gold star on the S.C. win
! list marks the 7-2 spanking the Tro
| jans gave to sassy College of Pa
! cific. The Tigers from Stockton trav
| eled to Los Angeles with illusions

of unseating the championship Troy j
squad. After the powerful Trojans j
mopped up the court with them, the
Tigers limped through a 4"/< all tie
with the U.C.L.A. Bruins.
Whether the Tigers from COP
have slipped from their high Coast
standing remains to be seen. To
morrow's grudge battle with Stan
ford may supply the answer.
Revenge motivates the increased
hustle on the Indian squad as they
prepare for the Pacific match. That
early season 6-3 loss to the Stock
ton still rankles the Cardinals, who
nearly upset the high-flying Tigers.
Added interest to tomorrow's re
turn match was assured when COP
turned in a 6-3 victory over Califor
i nia Wednesday afternoon. By com
: parative scores, the Indian-Bear
meeting later in the season will be
extremely close. Stanford hopes to
nudge the statisticians with a better
i score tomorrow and thus whip the
j Bears - at least on paper.

Stanford's unpredictable tennis team tears into the two leading net teams of the West Coast
, on successive days, today and tomorrow, in an ambitious—but terrifying—schedule arrangement.
This afternoon at 1:30, the Indians join with Southern California in inaugurating the 1947
Conference schedule on the local courts. Then, without stopping for breath, Stanford battles the
powerful College of Pacific Tigers tomorrow in a rematch of an earlier Tiger victory.

Gunning for their ninth PCC
Southern Division tennis title South
j em California's wondermen will en
' ter today's clash as heavy favor
j ites. In fact, the boys from Troy
j have practically been awarded the
! Conference title already, it' you wish
I to believe (he flowery news copy
I pouring from the Southland. No team
; can be THAT good.
The Indians have had their ups
j and downs this season, but their
improvement has been encouraging
I to Coach Elwyn Bugge. So far, the
| locals are batting .500, with one loss
! and one win. College of Pacific ad
ministered the defeat, 6-3; while
| Santa Clara submitted to a 7-2 drub
bing at the hands of Stanford.

SAN FRANCISCO, April 17
(UP). —The favored University of
j Southern California tenuis team
swept its way through seven
| matches today to down Univer
; sity of San Francisco, 7 to 2.

Unfortunately for Farm tennis
j followers, the Trojan net record has
i been nothing short of sensational.
Eight successive times Southern Cal
has prevailed over its opponent, with
| most of the victories being of a de
j cisive nature. The lengthy string
j of conquests gives the Indians a
; tempting target to upset, but the
I Trojans will be just as determined
I to keep the record intact.
Prime gold star on the S.C. win
! list marks the 7-2 spanking the Tro
| jans gave to sassy College of Pa
! cific. The Tigers from Stockton trav
| eled to Los Angeles with illusions

of unseating the championship Troy j
squad. After the powerful Trojans j
mopped up the court with them, the
Tigers limped through a 4"/< all tie
with the U.C.L.A. Bruins.
Whether the Tigers from COP
have slipped from their high Coast
standing remains to be seen. To
morrow's grudge battle with Stan
ford may supply the answer.
Revenge motivates the increased
hustle on the Indian squad as they
prepare for the Pacific match. That
early season 6-3 loss to the Stock
ton still rankles the Cardinals, who
nearly upset the high-flying Tigers.
Added interest to tomorrow's re
turn match was assured when COP
turned in a 6-3 victory over Califor
i nia Wednesday afternoon. By com
: parative scores, the Indian-Bear
meeting later in the season will be
extremely close. Stanford hopes to
nudge the statisticians with a better
i score tomorrow and thus whip the
j Bears - at least on paper.

FRANKLIN "PITCH" JOHNSON"—one of the Farm's ace quar
termilcrs who will run against the Olympic Club tomorrow. "Pitch"
is the son of "Pitch" Johnson, former Stanford track Coach.
—Photo b\ Bob Dillon
The king size crowd expected to be on hand at Angell Field
tomorrow afternoon for the Sianford-Olympic Club track meet
may not see the greatest competitive clash of the year, but they
are certain to see a wonderful show. As an added attraction,
assistant coach Cornelius "Dutch" Warmerdam will put on an

exhibition pole vault performance.
Dink Templeton's "Winged-O"
squad is about the closest thing to
an athletic three-ring circus on the
Pacific Coast.
Although no actual list of entries
has been received from the Olympic
Club, all three "rings will probably
be loaded with famous personages
in the track world.
For instance, in the track event
"ring" Tcmpleton hopes to use Hal
Davis, one of the greatest sprinters
of all lime. Davis, at the University
of California before the war, legged
the 100 yd. dash in 9.4 seconds,
equaling the world's record. This
season, in workouts, he's done 9.9—
reportedly breezing.
MOORE TO HI RULE
Then there's 33-yoar-old Tom
Moore, the oldest active huruler in
the United States. Moore has natu
rally lost some of his speed since his
younger days, but he can still nudge
15 seconds in the highs and 25 sec
onds in the lows.
In the jumping events, the Olympic
Club lists on its roster Willard
Smith, Irving Moore, and Guinn
Smith. Willard Smith, a former
Stanford track man, holds the fill
time University high jump record at
6 feet 7 ! i inches.
Guinn Smith and Irving Moore,
two top-flight pole vaulters, are
almost certain entries in the meet.
Smith went 14 feet 6 inches at Mo
deslo Li-l week (lie highest vault in
competition in the United States this
season.
Martin Biles and Lowell Todd are
tentatively billed as headline per
formers in tho throwing "ring."
Both are javelin specialists, and each
can do well over 200 feet.
CONNIE ON EXHIBITION
As if all this wasn't enough,
"Dutch" Warmerdam will vault as an
exhibition. Warmerdam has a mon
opoly on the world's vaulting records
— he holds the indoor title at 15 feet
Br'.;8 r '.; inches, and the outdoor at 15
feet 7 i inches.
He's the only man who has ever
cleared the bar ,at 15 feet or above,
and he's accomplished that feat 44
times.
In practice this year Warmerdam

has reached the very respectable
height of 14 feet 8 inches.
Tlic actual point-gathering busi
ness of the afternoon should pro
vide its share of thrills, too. Best
race of the day is looked for in the
880, with Stanford's ace, George
Grimes, matching strides with the
Olympic's Bob Lehman. Grimes has
been clocked at 1:54.7 this season,
and Lehman at 1:56.7.
GANAHL AND GIRARD
Another heated argument is ex
pected in the mile between the In
dians' Frank Ganahl and Marston
"Mushy" Girard, of the Olympic
Club. Girard, running for Stanford
in 1940, pared his time down to 4:12.9.
His best mark for this campaign is
4.20. Ganahl's peak performance
to date is 4:24.7.
Girard, an accomplished half
miler as well, will probably not ap
pear in that event tomorrow.
VITAL STATISTICS
Festivities are scheduled to get
under way at 1:45 p.m., with the
first track event—the mile—slated
for 2. Admission for non- student
body card holders is $1.20.
Probable Stanford entries:

tomorrow afternoon for the Sianford-Olympic Club track meet
may not see the greatest competitive clash of the year, but they
are certain to see a wonderful show. As an added attraction,
assistant coach Cornelius "Dutch" Warmerdam will put on an

exhibition pole vault performance.
Dink Templeton's "Winged-O"
squad is about the closest thing to
an athletic three-ring circus on the
Pacific Coast.
Although no actual list of entries
has been received from the Olympic
Club, all three "rings will probably
be loaded with famous personages
in the track world.
For instance, in the track event
"ring" Tcmpleton hopes to use Hal
Davis, one of the greatest sprinters
of all lime. Davis, at the University
of California before the war, legged
the 100 yd. dash in 9.4 seconds,
equaling the world's record. This
season, in workouts, he's done 9.9—
reportedly breezing.
MOORE TO HI RULE
Then there's 33-yoar-old Tom
Moore, the oldest active huruler in
the United States. Moore has natu
rally lost some of his speed since his
younger days, but he can still nudge
15 seconds in the highs and 25 sec
onds in the lows.
In the jumping events, the Olympic
Club lists on its roster Willard
Smith, Irving Moore, and Guinn
Smith. Willard Smith, a former
Stanford track man, holds the fill
time University high jump record at
6 feet 7 ! i inches.
Guinn Smith and Irving Moore,
two top-flight pole vaulters, are
almost certain entries in the meet.
Smith went 14 feet 6 inches at Mo
deslo Li-l week (lie highest vault in
competition in the United States this
season.
Martin Biles and Lowell Todd are
tentatively billed as headline per
formers in tho throwing "ring."
Both are javelin specialists, and each
can do well over 200 feet.
CONNIE ON EXHIBITION
As if all this wasn't enough,
"Dutch" Warmerdam will vault as an
exhibition. Warmerdam has a mon
opoly on the world's vaulting records
— he holds the indoor title at 15 feet
Br'.;8 r '.; inches, and the outdoor at 15
feet 7 i inches.
He's the only man who has ever
cleared the bar ,at 15 feet or above,
and he's accomplished that feat 44
times.
In practice this year Warmerdam

has reached the very respectable
height of 14 feet 8 inches.
Tlic actual point-gathering busi
ness of the afternoon should pro
vide its share of thrills, too. Best
race of the day is looked for in the
880, with Stanford's ace, George
Grimes, matching strides with the
Olympic's Bob Lehman. Grimes has
been clocked at 1:54.7 this season,
and Lehman at 1:56.7.
GANAHL AND GIRARD
Another heated argument is ex
pected in the mile between the In
dians' Frank Ganahl and Marston
"Mushy" Girard, of the Olympic
Club. Girard, running for Stanford
in 1940, pared his time down to 4:12.9.
His best mark for this campaign is
4.20. Ganahl's peak performance
to date is 4:24.7.
Girard, an accomplished half
miler as well, will probably not ap
pear in that event tomorrow.

Stanford's unpredictable tennis team tears into the two leading net teams of the West Coast
, on successive days, today and tomorrow, in an ambitious—but terrifying—schedule arrangement.
This afternoon at 1:30, the Indians join with Southern California in inaugurating the 1947
Conference schedule on the local courts. Then, without stopping for breath, Stanford battles the
powerful College of Pacific Tigers tomorrow in a rematch of an earlier Tiger victory.

Gunning for their ninth PCC
Southern Division tennis title South
j em California's wondermen will en
' ter today's clash as heavy favor
j ites. In fact, the boys from Troy
j have practically been awarded the
! Conference title already, it' you wish
I to believe (he flowery news copy
I pouring from the Southland. No team
; can be THAT good.
The Indians have had their ups
j and downs this season, but their
improvement has been encouraging
I to Coach Elwyn Bugge. So far, the
| locals are batting .500, with one loss
! and one win. College of Pacific ad
ministered the defeat, 6-3; while
| Santa Clara submitted to a 7-2 drub
bing at the hands of Stanford.

SAN FRANCISCO, April 17
(UP). —The favored University of
j Southern California tenuis team
swept its way through seven
| matches today to down Univer
; sity of San Francisco, 7 to 2.

Unfortunately for Farm tennis
j followers, the Trojan net record has
i been nothing short of sensational.
Eight successive times Southern Cal
has prevailed over its opponent, with
| most of the victories being of a de
j cisive nature. The lengthy string
j of conquests gives the Indians a
; tempting target to upset, but the
I Trojans will be just as determined
I to keep the record intact.
Prime gold star on the S.C. win
! list marks the 7-2 spanking the Tro
| jans gave to sassy College of Pa
! cific. The Tigers from Stockton trav
| eled to Los Angeles with illusions

of unseating the championship Troy j
squad. After the powerful Trojans j
mopped up the court with them, the
Tigers limped through a 4"/< all tie
with the U.C.L.A. Bruins.
Whether the Tigers from COP
have slipped from their high Coast
standing remains to be seen. To
morrow's grudge battle with Stan
ford may supply the answer.
Revenge motivates the increased
hustle on the Indian squad as they
prepare for the Pacific match. That
early season 6-3 loss to the Stock
ton still rankles the Cardinals, who
nearly upset the high-flying Tigers.
Added interest to tomorrow's re
turn match was assured when COP
turned in a 6-3 victory over Califor
i nia Wednesday afternoon. By com
: parative scores, the Indian-Bear
meeting later in the season will be
extremely close. Stanford hopes to
nudge the statisticians with a better
i score tomorrow and thus whip the
j Bears - at least on paper.
