It's another ffimc for the Indians
today on the Sunken Diamondâ€”a
tentative meeting with Camp Stone
man's diamond warriors, which has
been in the offing for some time,
suddenly jelled yesterday and as a
result the Farm baseballers will trot
out on the field in search of their
fifth straight win this afternoon at
3:15.
Toinorow afternoon, the Stanford
Jayvc' take over the Sunken Dia
mond when they play host to San
Deniio in one of the holier games
on the Jay vi e schedule. Ilight-hand
er Forrest Shumway has been named
J.o chuck for the Farm, Don Ga
in ielson, a converted first baseman,
may get a chance to pitch a few
innings of the game, which star fi
at 3:15.
That's llu l bulk of the baseball

action for the weekend, until the
varsity moves over to St. Mary's
next Tuesday afternoon to resume
t heir come-back campaign in the
C.1.8.A.
Dick Flatland or Dave Stott are
the flingers most likely to get the
starting nod for the varsity this af
ternoon. Both hurlers have already
appeared in eight of the 16 games
played this season, with Flatland
boasting a 1-0 win-lose record for
the season and Stott having chalked
up two wins against one defeat.
The Indians have recovered from
their three losses in the Southland j

past eight days have cruised to
consecutive wins over Bank of
America, the El Toro Marines,
Santa Clara and the Cal Aggies.
