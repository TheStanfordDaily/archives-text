## Election System Should Be Improved 
### 
The faults of our election system became
even more apparent to us in Stanford's first
primary yesterday. In addition, some new
ones were added.
Under the present system, no check is
made upon the area or class from which a
student votes. Yesterday many men who do
not live in the lower row area could have and
probably did vote for lower row candidates.
All they had to do was toll the girl in charge
of ballots that they lived there.
Students could vote for any class they
v/ished as long as they only voted for one
class. It is so easy for a living group to sup
port its candidate when every member of the
group can vote for him no matter what class
that member belongs to.
Another fault with our system is that there
is no check on the ballots whether there is
just one ballot or a group of them. Some of
them can blow away, especially on a windy
day like yesterday, only to be picked up
later and voted, possibly by someone who
has already cast his vote.
Also some of the ballot boxes were so full
yesterday that ballots were protruding from
the slots. It would have been easy for some
one to have reached in and grabbed a hand
ful and destroyed some of them. There were
so many people meddling around the voting
booths that the act would not have been
noticed.
The girls in the election booths are not
trained in their jobs. Yesterday one question
they commonly asked was, "What class do
you belong to," or simply, "What class?" The
obvious answer the student makes is the class
fo which he now belongs instead of the one
he will belong to next year. Then both the
voter and the girl at the booth get confused
and sometimes a mistake is made. Jt is pos
sible that many graduating seniors voted for
senior class president yesterday.
A new fault that crept into yesterday's

election was tho use cf the red pencil. When
the pencil mark is erased from a student body j
card it is unnoticeable for all practical pur
poses. Students could vote a number of times.
Then too, when you have only one ballot
and check the offices a student can vote foi
with red pencil, it is possible for the student
to check some additional offices on his ballot
with his own red pencil.
It is obvious that something must be .done,
and done before Thursday's election. All
student body cards should be punched in a
specified place. Everyone who votes should
be checked in the bawlout or on a list made
up of the persons living in a particular area
or belonging to a particular class. The bal
lots themselves should be numbered and
checked off; but if that is impossible to do
before Thursday, a closer tab should be kept
on them by the girls at the booths.
The girls should be better trained in hand- ■
ling their booths. They should be taught the ;
proper way to ask a person his class and to ]
keep a close check on the ballots.
These measures are awkward and hard to
administrate. Therefore by the time of the
next elections, a new system should be
worked out that will permanently solve many
of these problems. We suggest that student
body cards, beginning fall quarter, have an
extra line on them for a student's class or the
year he plans to graduate and his residence.
Then the girls at the booth would look at his
card and hand him the correct ballots. Num
bering of the ballots should be in the per
manent plan, and also training of the girls
who take charge of the booths.
Election Board should line up a group of
people ahead of time to count the ballots
and train them as to the method of doing it.
No matter what solution is worked out
Eleclion Board should start working on it now
and give the problem adequate consideration
so that elections like yesterday's won't occur
again. N.B.

student body cards should be punched in a
specified place. Everyone who votes should
be checked in the bawlout or on a list made
up of the persons living in a particular area
or belonging to a particular class. The bal
lots themselves should be numbered and
checked off; but if that is impossible to do
before Thursday, a closer tab should be kept
on them by the girls at the booths.
The girls should be better trained in hand- ■
ling their booths. They should be taught the ;
proper way to ask a person his class and to ]
keep a close check on the ballots.
These measures are awkward and hard to
administrate. Therefore by the time of the
next elections, a new system should be
worked out that will permanently solve many
of these problems. We suggest that student
body cards, beginning fall quarter, have an
extra line on them for a student's class or the
year he plans to graduate and his residence.
Then the girls at the booth would look at his
card and hand him the correct ballots. Num
bering of the ballots should be in the per
manent plan, and also training of the girls
who take charge of the booths.
Election Board should line up a group of
people ahead of time to count the ballots
and train them as to the method of doing it.
No matter what solution is worked out
Eleclion Board should start working on it now
and give the problem adequate consideration
so that elections like yesterday's won't occur
again. N.B.
The faults of our election system became
even more apparent to us in Stanford's first
primary yesterday. In addition, some new
ones were added.
Under the present system, no check is
made upon the area or class from which a
student votes. Yesterday many men who do
not live in the lower row area could have and
probably did vote for lower row candidates.
All they had to do was toll the girl in charge
of ballots that they lived there.
Students could vote for any class they
v/ished as long as they only voted for one
class. It is so easy for a living group to sup
port its candidate when every member of the
group can vote for him no matter what class
that member belongs to.
Another fault with our system is that there
is no check on the ballots whether there is
just one ballot or a group of them. Some of
them can blow away, especially on a windy
day like yesterday, only to be picked up
later and voted, possibly by someone who
has already cast his vote.
Also some of the ballot boxes were so full
yesterday that ballots were protruding from
the slots. It would have been easy for some
one to have reached in and grabbed a hand
ful and destroyed some of them. There were
so many people meddling around the voting
booths that the act would not have been
noticed.
The girls in the election booths are not
trained in their jobs. Yesterday one question
they commonly asked was, "What class do
you belong to," or simply, "What class?" The
obvious answer the student makes is the class
fo which he now belongs instead of the one
he will belong to next year. Then both the
voter and the girl at the booth get confused
and sometimes a mistake is made. Jt is pos
sible that many graduating seniors voted for
senior class president yesterday.
A new fault that crept into yesterday's

election was tho use cf the red pencil. When
the pencil mark is erased from a student body j
card it is unnoticeable for all practical pur
poses. Students could vote a number of times.
Then too, when you have only one ballot
and check the offices a student can vote foi
with red pencil, it is possible for the student
to check some additional offices on his ballot
with his own red pencil.
It is obvious that something must be .done,
and done before Thursday's election. All
student body cards should be punched in a
specified place. Everyone who votes should
be checked in the bawlout or on a list made
