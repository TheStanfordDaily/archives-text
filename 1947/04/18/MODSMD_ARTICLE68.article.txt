### DAN ENDSLEY 
Some clays it doesn't even pay to get out ol bed.
Take yesterday, for instance. You take it—and you
can have it.
As some of you sports lovers already know, doubt
less, the San Francisco Chronicle honored me with
the post of campus correspondent after Mr. S. Farkas
left school somewhat precipitately, due to a slight
misunderstanding with the scholarship committee.
That means running around and covering all the
;ports events which take place on this beautiful, wide
spread Farm- -from the rockbound entrance to Palm
Drive all the way to'the sunny shores of Lake Lagun
ita, and even farther. Of course there are frequently
Jive or six contests going on in as many sports, but
then again thure are frequent easy weekends when

Yesterday promised to be a beautiful, calm, sunny
day. with only a baseball game and a track meet
scheduled to occur simultaneously. In addition, my
esteemed room mate had accepted an invitation for
me lo have dinner at Manzanita at (> o'clock. His sister
lives there.
Well, you'd think they could get a simple little
thing like a track meet over by 6 o'clock; I had no
worries. That is not until the appointed hour arrived
and they hadn't even started the 2-mile run vet.

Anyhow, the clambake finally
ground lo ;i halt and I filed my
track story by Western Union. That
101 l the baseball game, which I had
been unable to watch personally.
Only by the time, the track meet
was over, so was ihe ball game—
and everyone had left.
It was necessary to hie myself
back to Toyon, where I planned
fondly to .net in touch with Mr. L.
Carman, who is The Daily's base-

ball expert. 1 picked up the phone ar»d, several min
utes later when the operator answered, I asked for

P.A. 221(5(), which happens to be The Daily's number.
"I'm very sorry," the operator said, "but we have
no outside lines. Try again in a couple of minutes.'"
Freely translated, that means, "Go on down to the
pay booth and use a nickel, you cheapskate."
Not having any nickels and finding it impossible
to get a dollar bill into the coin box, I returned to
the house booth and tried again. The operator didn't
answer, but I somehow got connected with a gentle
man down on the first floor.
"Do you have a call for me?" he asked.
"Of course not," I answered.
"But you just buzzed my room!" he cried.
"The heck I did," I said. "I'm in a booth up on j
the third floor, and all 1 want is the operator."
"Oh," he said disgustedly, and desisted.
Finally 1 got the operator. It was a girl this I
time, and she didn't have any lines open either. In a i
few minutes I tried again, and she told me she ,
couldn't give me a line until eight o'clock. Giving up j
with some slight displeasure, I finally found a gen- j
tleman who was willing to loan me a nickel and got
through to The Daily. Mr. Carman was very happy
to give me the information I needed so badly.
Finally I was able to get through to the Chronicle.
I won't bother you with my troubles there, except
to tell you that I had to listen to the operator discuss j
her love life with one of the other girls for about 15 i
minutes before she'd deign to notice me.
By the time I got back up to my room I found it i
was rather late; in fact, a somewhat incensed room J
mate was waiting for me to tell me dinner had been
eaten without me.
He told me the girls were very disappointed when i
I hadn't arrived on .schedule. One of them in par- |
ticular was down in the mouth. She had intended, I
my room mate learned, to throw a salad in my facc j
because of a recent column which appeared under my j
name.
Come to think of it, that dinner was probably the j
best meal I never ate.

I won't bother you with my troubles there, except
to tell you that I had to listen to the operator discuss j
her love life with one of the other girls for about 15 i
minutes before she'd deign to notice me.
By the time I got back up to my room I found it i
was rather late; in fact, a somewhat incensed room J
mate was waiting for me to tell me dinner had been
eaten without me.
He told me the girls were very disappointed when i
I hadn't arrived on .schedule. One of them in par- |
ticular was down in the mouth. She had intended, I
my room mate learned, to throw a salad in my facc j
because of a recent column which appeared under my j
name.
Come to think of it, that dinner was probably the j
best meal I never ate.

Some clays it doesn't even pay to get out ol bed.
Take yesterday, for instance. You take it—and you
can have it.
As some of you sports lovers already know, doubt

the post of campus correspondent after Mr. S. Farkas
left school somewhat precipitately, due to a slight

Yesterday promised to be a beautiful, calm, sunny
day. with only a baseball game and a track meet
scheduled to occur simultaneously. In addition, my
esteemed room mate had accepted an invitation for
me lo have dinner at Manzanita at (> o'clock. His sister
lives there.
Well, you'd think they could get a simple little
thing like a track meet over by 6 o'clock; I had no
worries. That is not until the appointed hour arrived
and they hadn't even started the 2-mile run vet.

Anyhow, the clambake finally
ground lo ;i halt and I filed my
track story by Western Union. That
101 l the baseball game, which I had
been unable to watch personally.
Only by the time, the track meet
was over, so was ihe ball game—
and everyone had left.
It was necessary to hie myself
back to Toyon, where I planned
fondly to .net in touch with Mr. L.
Carman, who is The Daily's base-

ball expert. 1 picked up the phone ar»d, several min
utes later when the operator answered, I asked for

P.A. 221(5(), which happens to be The Daily's number.
"I'm very sorry," the operator said, "but we have
no outside lines. Try again in a couple of minutes.'"
Freely translated, that means, "Go on down to the
pay booth and use a nickel, you cheapskate."
Not having any nickels and finding it impossible
to get a dollar bill into the coin box, I returned to
the house booth and tried again. The operator didn't
answer, but I somehow got connected with a gentle
man down on the first floor.
"Do you have a call for me?" he asked.
"Of course not," I answered.
"But you just buzzed my room!" he cried.
"The heck I did," I said. "I'm in a booth up on j
the third floor, and all 1 want is the operator."
"Oh," he said disgustedly, and desisted.
Finally 1 got the operator. It was a girl this I
time, and she didn't have any lines open either. In a i
few minutes I tried again, and she told me she ,
couldn't give me a line until eight o'clock. Giving up j
with some slight displeasure, I finally found a gen- j
tleman who was willing to loan me a nickel and got
through to The Daily. Mr. Carman was very happy
to give me the information I needed so badly.
