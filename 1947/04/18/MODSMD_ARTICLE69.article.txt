To the Editor:
In reading the classified section of the April 14
Daily (Classifieds Get Results), I w;is intrigued by the
"For Kent" ad concerning the double room for gradu
ate men.
This ad speaks of a ' semi-private bath.' Now, we
of the "Spider Web" have several theories as to what
this means and wish that Stanford as a group would
decide which is correct:
1.) Semi-private means that half of the time you
will, be alone in the bath room.

(All letters should be addressed to the editor,
si'/ncd and contain address and phone /lum
ber ol writer. There is no limit on words hut
it is desirable they be short and to tha point.)

L'.) The bath room has glass walls, but the street
has little traffic. hence, semi-private.
Semi-private means that only half of the house
hold use the bath room.
4.) Semi-private means that this bath room is
restricted to P.F.C.'s.
5.) Semi-private means that the bath room is j
held in conjunction with a nearby gas station, j
Perhaps all of these are wrong.
