# U.S.-Russ Mix Over Austria
## 
### 
MOSCOW. April 17 (UP).—Sec
retary of State George C. Marshall
indirectly accused Russia today of
seeking to use in the Big Four
Foreign Ministers' Conference the
veto which it exercises in the United
Nations.
At two meetings the Big Four dis
cussed the treaty to restore inde
pendence to Austria, which Adolf
Hitler seized in 1938.
In the morning Yugoslavia made
its formal demand for a bit* part of
Carinthia and $150,000,000 war rep
arations from Austria — a demand
which, it was made known, the
United States will oppose to the end
even if it means the Austrian treaty
cannot be written here.
DISPLACED PERSONS PROBLEM
In the afternoon the Foreign Min
isters were discussing what is to
happen to the estimated 500,000 dis
placed persons in Austria, many of
them political refugees from Russia
and its "iron curtain" satellites.
Andrei Vishinsky, Russian delegate
speaking for Foreign Minister Via
eheslav Molotov, insisted that Aus
tria be bound in its treaty to expel
all displaced persons.
The Western Allies want to bind
Austria to treat displaced persons
in accordance with United Nations
resolutions, which would guard
them against forcible repatriation.
SOVIETS IN ERROR
Marshall reminded Vishinsky that
the U.N. action was taken by a two
thirds vote of the entire Assembly.
"Does the Soviet delegation think
that others should not propose the
.same thing her just because the
Soviet. Union opposed it at the
U.N.?" asked Marshall. "'ls this a
new use of the veto?"
Vishinsky said Marshall was mix
ing things up—that he had no inten
tion of using the veto. The U.N., he
said, did not mention Austria spe
cifically.
