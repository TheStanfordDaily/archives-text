# Hanna Defends His Texts In State Senate Hearing; Denies Sargent's Charges
## 
### 
At a hearing Thursday in the California Senate chamber,
Dr. Paul R. Hanna, professor of education, defended his "Build
ing America" textbooks against Communist charges, denied
flatly that he has radical tendencies, and issued a stirring warn
ing to America against Communism.
He said, "I can tell you, from my experience in Panama, that

I know Communism is making real
inroads in the countries of our
neighbors to the South."
"The threat of the Communist to
talitarian concept of life is much
deeper than any of us are aware to
day."
DIVIDE AND RULE
Two weeks ago Dr. Hanna was in
Berlin as a consultant to the Sec
retary of War, working with a four
nation council in an attempt to get
a system of history texts for Berlin
schools that would satisfy the Rus
sians, British, French, and Ameri
cans.
He warned, "Day after day I've
seen Communists prevent four
party action and announce action of
their own. The Russians are play
ing a clever game of divide and rule,
and are deepening Communist roots
in Europe."
"We end up every issue," he said,
"with as strong a ringing plea for
the American way of life as we can
possibly put into it."
In answer to Aaron Sargent, Palo
Alto lawyer, who has intimated
Hanna is a Communist sympathizer,
Hanna said he is not a Communist,
never has been associated with Com
munist front organizations, is not
now and never expects to be.
CAPACITY OF CHILDREN
He told of giving explicit orders
to the "Building America" editorial
staff never to hire any one associ
ated with Communism "because I
myself was concerned with the very
problem that worries you here."
A key issue between Hanna and
Sargent was the capacity of children
in seventh and eighth grades to learn
about adult life problems.
Sargent said, in a half-hour rebut
tal, "These pupils are not able to
take controversial material!. Un
trained children cannot tackle world
problems in the classroom."
Hanna said, however, "I want our
youngsters to know it has always
been a struggle to achieve anything
worth while. We didn't achieve
these United States by wishing."
