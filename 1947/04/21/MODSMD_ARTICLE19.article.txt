# Preamble For Austrian Pact Is Completed
## 
### 
MOSCOW, April 20 (UP).—'The
BiK Four Foreign Ministers com
oleted the preamble of the Aus
trian treaty today, including a
clause which Russia demanded
■pecifying Austria '"cannot avoid a
certain responsibility arising from
its participation in the war."
The United States and Great Brit
ain, mindful that Austria was seized
by Germany more than one year
before the war started, wanted to
say merely that Austria could not
escape the "consequences" of the
war.
Though they agreed on some mi
nor points, the Big Four and their
deputies failed in separate meetings
to break the deadlock on major
Joints. Unless unexpected progress
>s made tomorrow, it is believed the
Moscow conference will end shortly,
a virtual failure.
MOLOTOV GIVES IN
Russian Foreien Minister Molo
tov, at the Big Four meeting, gave
in on two articles of the treaty—one
concerning the extradition of al
leged war criminals in Austria, the
other concerning naturalization of
Germans in that country.
As regards naturalization, Russia
had wanted to forbid the naturali
zation of any Germans in Austria.
Today Molotov agreed that only
naturalization of former Nazis
should be forbidden.
The Foreign Ministers agreed also
to a proposal by French Foreign
Minister Bidault that the Austrian
treaty be written in only three texts
—English, French and Russian—be
caute the Austrians use the German
language. Bidault said he did not
want to put German on an equal
footing with the other languages.
LEGAL HEADACHES
However, conference circles pre
dicted the lack of a German text
would cause so many legal head
aches in Austria that in the end
there probably will be one.
They agreed also on a clause con
cerning the return to Germany of
German citizens in Austria and per
sons of German origin.
The third agreement was tbat
Austria must give up all claims
against the Allies. This means Aus
tria will assume responsibility for
occupation currency issued by the
Allies.
