ston Churchill told Henry A. Wal

confess publicly or privately the
convictions of my group that war is
inevitable.'
"My viow is as follows: War is
not inevitable, but it would be in
evitable if Britain and the United
States were to follow the policy of
appeasement and one-sided disar
mament which brought about the
last war."
Churchill denied that he had
called Wallace a "crypto-Commu
nist" last Friday in a speech before
his Conservative party's Primrose
League in Albert Hall.
