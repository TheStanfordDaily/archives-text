# Octopus 'Takes In Sun' On Dekes' Front Lawn, Then 'Stags It' at Dance
## 
### EVELYN WYTHE 
Friday afternoon was warm and Sunny and the Farm lay
peacefully sleeping after a long strenuous week. To the two
ladies who were unconcernedly riding past the Deke house
nothing seemed amiss. Without thinking, one of the ladies care
lessly glanced at the crowd of IX'kes lounging on the lawn.

Suddenly her eyes popped open and*
a wild shriek burst from her throat.
"What is it?" she gasped.
Horrified her friend jammed on
the brakes, looked at the lawn and ,
yelled, "It's a monster. Almost
immediately, the ear disappeared in
the distance.
The "monster," an octopus with
only seven tentacles and measur
ing 11 feet, lay unmoving and quite
dead on the Deke lawn.
WHITE FINDS "MONSTER"
Early in the afternoon, Jack j
White, a Deke, went swimming at J
Shelter Cove, six miles north ol
Half Moon Bay. While diving for
abalones in about eight feet of water
he chanced to look down and saw
the octopus on the ground slowly
.swaying with the current.
While swam back to shore but
seeing the octopus hadn't made any
attempt at his life, he took an iron
rod used in abalone catching and
swam back to the octopus.
White then hit the octopus several
times over the head with the rod
and finally succeeded in killing it.
Grabbing one of the octopus's seven
tentacles White pulled it back to
shore, tied it on the back of his car
and brought it to the Deke house
lawn for examination.
A SOCIAL SUCCESS
The octopus, being a sociable
creature, attracted the attention of
several passers-by. While answer
ing questions of "Is it a star-fish?"
and"It looks like a crustacean,"
the afternoon finally wore away and
the octopus's short college career
ended in the garbage can.
However, as the story goes, some
body stole the octopus from the
garbage can sometime during the
evening. Mysteriously it was thrown
onto the dance floor during inter
mission time at the Toyon formal
that night.
