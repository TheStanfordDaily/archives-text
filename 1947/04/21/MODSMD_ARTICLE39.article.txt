# Farm Netmen Drop Two Contests Over Weekend
## 
### 
Saturday's battle was especially
heart-breaking for the large crowd
of Indian fans which turned out to
see the touted Tigers perform. The
Cardinals had the Pacific team hang
ing on the ropes in the final stages
of the match. But when the chips
were down, the stronger team from
Stockton prevailed.
Climax of the extensive net week
end was the crucial second doubles
contest on Saturday between Drew
Putty and Lucien Barbour of Stan
ford and the Pacific duo of Art Lar
sen and Ted Collins. Match score
was tied at 4 all as this doubles bat
tle took the court.
Putty and Barbour look command
early in the first set by twice break
ing the service of C.O.P.'s Collins.
Thus Stanford led, 5-2, and seemed
to have the first set all sewed up.
But colorful Art Larsen of Pacific,
who threw his racket when he
missed shots . . . with suitable com
mentary, took the match into his
own hands. Pacific took over the
offensive by running out the next
four games for the first set, 7-5.
SAME STORY
The second set was almost an ex
act duplicate of the first one. Stan
ford took an overpowering 4-1 lead,
but the visiting Tigers put an end to
the suspense. Five sad games later,
C.O.P. tucked away the match, 6-4,
and the entire meet, 5-4.
Earlier in the C.O.P. match, the
Tigers rushed through the first three
singles matches with a minimum of
effort. In the feature match, George
Druliner of Pacific rolled unmer
cifully over, Indian Bob Lewis, 6-1,
6-1.
Coach Elwyn Bugge juggled his
starting line-up when Ted Myers

Stanford's unhappy tennis team took it on the chin twice over
the weekend, dropping the Friday debacle to U.S.C., 7-1, and
losing a 5-4 heartbreaker to C.O.P. on Saturday. The results
were according to the form sheet, but the Indians deserved a
better fate in their detertnined bid for upsets.

leg injury. Fred Lewis, who had
only been used in doubles play pre
viously, was inserted in the second
singles pairing. Art L;irsen finally
defeated Fred after a tight battle,
6-3. 7-5.
MECHEM WINS
Sparkling play in the lower sin
gles brackets by Drew Putty, Kirke
Mechem, and Ross Hughes tied up
the match for the Indians, 3-3.
Mechern was forced to three sets be
fore he prevailed over CheJ Covey
of C.0.P.. 6-4, 4-6, 6-2. Meanwhile,
Hughes continued his steady im
provement by trouncing ISi ; oeli
Prince, 6-1, 6-2.
Both early doubles wins were of a
decisive nature. Pfister and Dru
liner of Pacific soundly spanked Bob
Rutledge and Dave Basham of
Stanford, 6-2, 6-2. The Indians
came back with an easy 6-3, 6-2 win
which Bob Lewis and Kirke Mechem
chalked up over Covey and Prince
of Pacific.
Friday's match? Well, the only
bright spot on the entire U.S.C. vic
tory parade was the sixth singles
win that Stanford's Ross Hughes won
over Jean Fiegenbaum, 6-1, 6-3.
Otherwise, the 7-1 final score of the
meet amply indicates the complete
predominance of Trijan talent.
