# Olympic Club In Track Win
## 
### BILL ALLEN 
Stanford track captain A 1 Snyder stole the individual lime
light from pole-vaulters Cornelius Warmerdam and Guinn Smith
as the Olympic Club trackmen defeated the Indians 74-57 on
Angell Field Saturday. Snyder made the fastest times of his
career in scoring a double win in the high and low hurdles.

Ml* ran the highs in 14:5, the lows
in 23.9.
Snyder's time over the 120 yard
high hurdles compares favorably
with any time made in the country
this year, and teammate Dell Rus
sell finished only two yards behind
him. In the lows the 33-year-old
clubman Tom Moore got between
the two Indians for speed.
DUTCH SOARS
Warmerdam who has vaulted over
15 feet 41 times made all heights up
to and including 14 feet 4 inches
look easy and failed in three close
tries at 14-8. His amateur standing
in doubt because of his position as
a physical education instructor here,
Warmerdam was vaulting as an ex
hibition.
It was the club's superiority in the
field events which brought them the
victory. Cardinals jumpers and
tossers garnered a measly nine points
out of 54. On the track Stanford led
48-29. Olympic Club swept the high
jump and pole vault and took first
and second in the shot put, discus,
and javelin. Gaylord Bryan took
Stanford's only first place in a field
event, winning the broad jump with
a leap of 22 feet 6'4 inches.
GIRARD TAKES MILE
In taking second to Mushy Girard
in the mile, Frank Ganahl estab
lished a new personal record of
4:23.2. Ganahl battled the ex-Stan
ford distance man on even terms
throughout most of the race until
Girard pulled away in the stretch to
win by 15 yards. His winning time
was 4:21. Best race of the day was
the 880 where the club's Bob Leh
! man beat off a stretch drive by
1 George Grimes to win in the re
j spec-table time of 1:54.9.
Stanford scored two clean sweeps,
in the 440 where Bob Mclnerney led
teamates Pitch Johnson and A 1 Wii
kins in 49.7, and in the 220 where
Terry Maxwell finished ahead of
Bob Smith and Johnson in 21.8.
Earlier in the day Maxwell had
i finished behind the great Hal Davis
in the 100. Davis' time, after a four
j year layoff from competition, was
I 9.8.
TWO-MILE EXCITING
An Indian relay team of Maxwell,
Wiikins, Grimes, and Mclnerney
defeated their opponents easily in
Ihe mediocre time of 3:25. A fairly
exciting two-mile race found the
club's Coughlin and Kline leading
A 1 Lyons and George Johnson
across the line in 10:07.4.
Winged "O" men in the field
events had several better-than-av
erage maraks. Martin Biles, former
Cal javelin thrower, tossed the spear
213 feet to win, and Jim Delaney of
San Francisco high school and Notre
Dame fame won the shot with a put
of 52 feet inches. Stanford fresh

man Otis Chandler was a foot be
hind his best mark, taking third with
47 feet (> 1 4 inches.

Stanford track captain A 1 Snyder stole the individual lime
light from pole-vaulters Cornelius Warmerdam and Guinn Smith
as the Olympic Club trackmen defeated the Indians 74-57 on
Angell Field Saturday. Snyder made the fastest times of his
career in scoring a double win in the high and low hurdles.

Ml* ran the highs in 14:5, the lows
in 23.9.
Snyder's time over the 120 yard
high hurdles compares favorably
with any time made in the country
this year, and teammate Dell Rus
sell finished only two yards behind
him. In the lows the 33-year-old
clubman Tom Moore got between
the two Indians for speed.
DUTCH SOARS
Warmerdam who has vaulted over
15 feet 41 times made all heights up
to and including 14 feet 4 inches
look easy and failed in three close
tries at 14-8. His amateur standing
in doubt because of his position as
a physical education instructor here,
Warmerdam was vaulting as an ex
hibition.
It was the club's superiority in the
field events which brought them the
victory. Cardinals jumpers and
tossers garnered a measly nine points
out of 54. On the track Stanford led
48-29. Olympic Club swept the high
jump and pole vault and took first
and second in the shot put, discus,
and javelin. Gaylord Bryan took
Stanford's only first place in a field
event, winning the broad jump with
a leap of 22 feet 6'4 inches.
GIRARD TAKES MILE
In taking second to Mushy Girard
in the mile, Frank Ganahl estab
lished a new personal record of
4:23.2. Ganahl battled the ex-Stan
ford distance man on even terms
throughout most of the race until
Girard pulled away in the stretch to
win by 15 yards. His winning time
was 4:21. Best race of the day was
the 880 where the club's Bob Leh
! man beat off a stretch drive by
1 George Grimes to win in the re
j spec-table time of 1:54.9.
Stanford scored two clean sweeps,
in the 440 where Bob Mclnerney led
teamates Pitch Johnson and A 1 Wii
kins in 49.7, and in the 220 where
Terry Maxwell finished ahead of
Bob Smith and Johnson in 21.8.
Earlier in the day Maxwell had

Wiikins, Grimes, and Mclnerney
defeated their opponents easily in
Ihe mediocre time of 3:25. A fairly
exciting two-mile race found the
club's Coughlin and Kline leading
A 1 Lyons and George Johnson
across the line in 10:07.4.
Winged "O" men in the field
events had several better-than-av

Cal javelin thrower, tossed the spear
213 feet to win, and Jim Delaney of
San Francisco high school and Notre

Stanford track captain A 1 Snyder stole the individual lime
light from pole-vaulters Cornelius Warmerdam and Guinn Smith
as the Olympic Club trackmen defeated the Indians 74-57 on
Angell Field Saturday. Snyder made the fastest times of his
career in scoring a double win in the high and low hurdles.

Ml* ran the highs in 14:5, the lows
in 23.9.
Snyder's time over the 120 yard
high hurdles compares favorably
with any time made in the country
this year, and teammate Dell Rus
sell finished only two yards behind
him. In the lows the 33-year-old
clubman Tom Moore got between
the two Indians for speed.
DUTCH SOARS
Warmerdam who has vaulted over
15 feet 41 times made all heights up
to and including 14 feet 4 inches
look easy and failed in three close
tries at 14-8. His amateur standing
in doubt because of his position as
a physical education instructor here,
Warmerdam was vaulting as an ex
hibition.
It was the club's superiority in the
field events which brought them the
victory. Cardinals jumpers and
tossers garnered a measly nine points
out of 54. On the track Stanford led
48-29. Olympic Club swept the high
jump and pole vault and took first
and second in the shot put, discus,
and javelin. Gaylord Bryan took
Stanford's only first place in a field
event, winning the broad jump with
a leap of 22 feet 6'4 inches.
GIRARD TAKES MILE
In taking second to Mushy Girard
in the mile, Frank Ganahl estab
lished a new personal record of
4:23.2. Ganahl battled the ex-Stan
ford distance man on even terms
throughout most of the race until
Girard pulled away in the stretch to
win by 15 yards. His winning time
was 4:21. Best race of the day was
the 880 where the club's Bob Leh
! man beat off a stretch drive by
1 George Grimes to win in the re
j spec-table time of 1:54.9.
Stanford scored two clean sweeps,
in the 440 where Bob Mclnerney led
teamates Pitch Johnson and A 1 Wii
kins in 49.7, and in the 220 where
Terry Maxwell finished ahead of
Bob Smith and Johnson in 21.8.
Earlier in the day Maxwell had

TWO-MILE EXCITING

Wiikins, Grimes, and Mclnerney
defeated their opponents easily in
Ihe mediocre time of 3:25. A fairly
exciting two-mile race found the
club's Coughlin and Kline leading
A 1 Lyons and George Johnson
across the line in 10:07.4.
Winged "O" men in the field
events had several better-than-av
erage maraks. Martin Biles, former
Cal javelin thrower, tossed the spear
213 feet to win, and Jim Delaney of
San Francisco high school and Notre
