pulling in their belts after fattening
up with five straight victories dur
ing the past two weeks, arc looking
thead towards two tough C.1.8.A.
coming up this week.
Tomorrow they journey to St.
Mary's to resume their comeback
campaign in confei'ence play, and
Saturday they play host to Southern
California's Trojans.
The Indians cleared the deck for
this week's conference activity by
neatly polishing off a visiting Camp
Stoneman squad, 7 to 3, last Friday
afternoon on the Sunken Diamond.
Four Cardinal pitchers held the
soldiers to but two base hits, one
of them of the scratch variety, as
their Farm teammates slammed out
12 base blows. A 1 Kircher, Lloyd
Merriman and Clyde Dingfelder all
collected two hits apiece.
The Junior Varsity is slated to
precede their varsity mates into
action this week, for San Mateo
Junior College will invade the Farm
this afternoon for a game with the
Jayvees.
The Jayvees took it on the chin
in their Saturday afternoon slug
fest with San Benito, for the visit
ors jumped into*a 9-2 lead and
coasted to a 15 to 11 win.
