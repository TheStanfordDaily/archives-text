## Concerning Our Golf Course... 
### 
Earlier this year a petition was presented
to Excom criticizing the present policy of the
University golf course toward campus golfers.
Last week a letter in the Campus Opinion
column of the Daily commented on the golf
course situation.
In order to fully comprehend the reasons
for recent changes in the treatment of student
golfers it is necessary to know the basic facts.
The controversial questions exist in the
minds of many student golfers:
(1) Why do we have outside members?
(2) Why has the rule regarding Saturday
morning play been changed?
(3) Why have the costs of "golf cards"
been raised?
If the course is to be kept in good playing
condition a minimum income is necessary.
This income could be derived from student
players only if their fees were exceptionally
high. In order to keep campus golfers' fees
at a reasonable sum and still keep the course
in good condition, outside members have
been accepted.
At present outside members number 242.
Their annual fee of $130 accounts for much
more of the total income than the fees received
from students playing on the course.
Up until a short time before the war no
students were allowed to use their cards on
weekends. At that time golfers decreased
and it was decided that Stanford golfers

should be allowed to use the course on Satur
day morning.
At present the course is overcrowded. In
order to allow the outside members who sup
port the course an opportunity to use it, nec
essity demands that it be closed to students
again on weekends as was the practice until
the war years.
Unlike many private clubs, the golf club
offers no outside inducements such as social
activities and the only benefit derived by out
side members is the right to play on the course.
Many new members have been refused admit
tance to the club as their use of the course
would further hamper students.
Mr. A 1 Masters, Director of Athletics, says
that the present limitation on Saturday morn
ing play is neither definite nor arbitrary. A
compromise may be made if it is shown that a
large number of persons are inconvenienced.
The present increase in golf fees is justified
in that the salaried of employees and the cost
of equipment has risen. These increases have
been distributed equitably among students,
faculty, and outside members. The course
recorded no actual profit last year and antici
pates none this year.
When these facts were presented to Excom
by a committee headed by Mickey Titus of
that organization, Excom rejected the petition
which was presented to it and termed the
requests therein as unjustified.—G.C.

recorded no actual profit last year and antici
pates none this year.
When these facts were presented to Excom
by a committee headed by Mickey Titus of
that organization, Excom rejected the petition
which was presented to it and termed the
requests therein as unjustified.—G.C.
Earlier this year a petition was presented
to Excom criticizing the present policy of the
University golf course toward campus golfers.
Last week a letter in the Campus Opinion
column of the Daily commented on the golf
course situation.
In order to fully comprehend the reasons
for recent changes in the treatment of student
golfers it is necessary to know the basic facts.
The controversial questions exist in the
minds of many student golfers:
(1) Why do we have outside members?
(2) Why has the rule regarding Saturday
morning play been changed?
(3) Why have the costs of "golf cards"
been raised?
If the course is to be kept in good playing
condition a minimum income is necessary.
This income could be derived from student
players only if their fees were exceptionally
high. In order to keep campus golfers' fees
at a reasonable sum and still keep the course
in good condition, outside members have
been accepted.
At present outside members number 242.
Their annual fee of $130 accounts for much
more of the total income than the fees received
from students playing on the course.
Up until a short time before the war no
students were allowed to use their cards on
weekends. At that time golfers decreased
and it was decided that Stanford golfers

should be allowed to use the course on Satur
day morning.
At present the course is overcrowded. In
order to allow the outside members who sup
port the course an opportunity to use it, nec
essity demands that it be closed to students
again on weekends as was the practice until
the war years.
Unlike many private clubs, the golf club
offers no outside inducements such as social
activities and the only benefit derived by out
side members is the right to play on the course.
Many new members have been refused admit
tance to the club as their use of the course
would further hamper students.
Mr. A 1 Masters, Director of Athletics, says
that the present limitation on Saturday morn
ing play is neither definite nor arbitrary. A
compromise may be made if it is shown that a
large number of persons are inconvenienced.
The present increase in golf fees is justified
in that the salaried of employees and the cost
of equipment has risen. These increases have
been distributed equitably among students,
faculty, and outside members. The course
recorded no actual profit last year and antici
pates none this year.
