The basis of most of the truly great educational
institutions of the world is not in the size of the
endowment funds, the number of books published by
instructors, the amount of money paid to professors
(although we are told it helps), or the size and beauty
of the physical structure. Rather the fame of such
institutions as Cambridge, Oxford, the Sorbonne, and
other European universities, and our own Harvard
and Yale, is based on the type of teaching employed
and the liberality and flexibility of teaching methods.
In the general run of American universities stand
ardization of techniques has penetrated into our
thought processes so well from our over-standardized
industry that cutting off of all thought and discussion
with the class bell has become an accepted procedure.
A very interesting thing happened up on "the
Row" of this University the other night. A frater
nity invited one of the more distinguished members
of the History Department up for dinner. The pre
dinner conversation was a little stiff, but immediately
afterward the entire group adjourned to the living
room.
The professor took the bull by the horns and in
formally presented his views on the current prob
lems presented by the news: Henry Wallace, Greece
and Turkey, and the advance of Communism. A stiff
and formal session soon broke down into heated dis
cussion, and many classroom facts and figures, theory
and dogma were correlated and crystallized.
The ideas tossed about in this one small session
are not of importance. But the idea of the meeting
itself is.
Here was an application of a side of education
which has been sadly lacking at Stanford. There
were no grades at stake. Both professor and students
could meet on common ground, formality was dis
pensed with, and premises only stood if valid.
I am sure that the fellows of that particular house
would be more than glad to pass on the idea to all
living groups on campus as one which would add
to the value of life here on the Farm in a very essen
tial way.

While the news of Henry Wallace s outbursts in
England was keeping the front pages of our news
papers boiling this last week, another private citizen
who once controlled a large segment of American
opinion finally sounded off after a long silence. (Some
people might comment on the power of sedition laws
during war-time at this point.)
The speaker was Mr. Charles A. Lindbergh, who
was the main sounding board for the America First
party and through them many of America's own na
tive Fascists, up till the time of Pearl Harbor.
He made this statement: '"Seven years ago I
toured this country pleading for a consistent Ameri
can policy toward Europe." He is right, his policy
was consistent, but then so is an ostrich.
Lindbergh did admit that he opposed intervention
in 1940-41. But it is the things he doesn't admit that
are interesting. Remember the theory that "the Ger
mans weren't so bad after all; why not let them
defeat the Communists and then work with them?"
Have we forgotten the opposition that all good Amer
ica Firsters gave to the draft and aid to Britain?
What is really pertinent is to note that Lindbergh
still feels that we shouldn't have tangled in "Eu
rope's affairs." But now that we are involved the
Truman Doctrine is the one that comes closer to
being the "strong and consistent" policy which he
has always advocated.
Lindbergh does not back the Truman Doctrine
directly. That policy is probably not quite strong
enough for him, but he certainly docs think that it
is a step in the "right" direction.
As if people in America weren't confused enough
already this latest move should be the last and final
step. In some camps the thought runs that "Wallace
is all right, but to support his policies is to indirectly
support Communism."
Now comes the suggestion that "the Truman Doc
trine is all right, but to support these policies is to
indirectly support Fascism." This is poor logic, but
it is the same type that is used about Mr. Wallace
every day. It. will be interesting to, see just how
many of our neo-Fascists in this country follow their
former leader's new party line.
