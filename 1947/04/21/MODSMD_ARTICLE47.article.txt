# CAMPUS OPINION

To the Editor:
First, a brief biography: I, an Army veteran of
three years' servicc, my wife, two children, and a
non-existent bankroll live in one room and a double
garage, which I built myself (it's mortgaged!). Wc
have no kitchen, no refrigerator, and only an elec
tric hot plate for cooking. We have no washing ma
chine but do have laundry tubs, which double as
bath tubs for the kids. Wc have little heat, much
(unplanned) ventilation, and cold feet—except on
hot days, when the milk sours and the oleo languidly
drools down the side of our orange-box cupboards.
Tragic, isn't it?
But somehow we manage to live, even though the
absence of rich parents and a Cadillac or two is
deeply felt—and I don't feel that the subsistence al
lowance should be increased. My wife has her hands
full with the two kids and the vegetable garden, and
so I am forced to work to make up the difference
between the allotment and living costs; but, strangely
enough, we actually believe we'll live through it. It
isn't easy, and we both miss a normal social life some
what; but I feel that this is the greatest opportunity
of my life—the chance to complete the studies in my
chosen field. I have two more years to go; and
without the government assistance, it would be vir
tually impossible for me to continue. But I don't
feel that my military service is, or should be, an
Aladdin's lamp.
I'm grateful for the opportunity of going to school
and certainly don't mind having to work a little bit
for it. And why should I? College is a privilege, not
a heritage, as some people seem to think. If there are
those who are so immature that they cannot sacrifice
some of the little things in life so that they may have
the greater benefits, then they do not deserve and

it is desirable they be short and to the point.]

have no right to those benefits; and tbey have no
place in this or any other university. For those who
arc willing to sacrifice and work, the reward is
waiting.
The world is their oyster; and though—like the
oyster—difficult to open, it is not unopenablc.
Sincerely, ,

To the Editor:
If university students represent a superior sam
pling of our society, they should be expected to set
an example of good breeding and considerate beha
vior. Unfortuntely, there is a group of students
who seem to think that enrollment in college con
stitutes carte blanche for any sort of boorish be
havior.
This attitude was beautifully demonstrated last
Thursday night at the Orchesis concert. To a capacity
crowd, many of whom were townspeople, these "rep
resentative Stanford students" exhibited the same
sort of polished manners and consideration for the
feelings and pleasure of others that has previously
evoked comment in the press.
Their keen appreciation of a somewhat more ab
stract form of expression was further shown by their
early and forceful selection of seats in the front row
center, a portion of the house in previous years roped
off as untenable or reserved for small children. No
doubt their concept of "dance" is somehow linked
with bubbles, fans, and the "bald-headed row."
It is sincerely to be hoped that the off-campus
members of the audience won't judge all of us by
their behavior.

Tragic, isn't it?
But somehow we manage to live, even though the
absence of rich parents and a Cadillac or two is
deeply felt—and I don't feel that the subsistence al
lowance should be increased. My wife has her hands
full with the two kids and the vegetable garden, and
so I am forced to work to make up the difference
between the allotment and living costs; but, strangely
enough, we actually believe we'll live through it. It
isn't easy, and we both miss a normal social life some

of my life—the chance to complete the studies in my
chosen field. I have two more years to go; and
without the government assistance, it would be vir
tually impossible for me to continue. But I don't
feel that my military service is, or should be, an
Aladdin's lamp.
I'm grateful for the opportunity of going to school
and certainly don't mind having to work a little bit
for it. And why should I? College is a privilege, not
a heritage, as some people seem to think. If there are

If university students represent a superior sam
pling of our society, they should be expected to set
an example of good breeding and considerate beha
vior. Unfortuntely, there is a group of students
who seem to think that enrollment in college con
stitutes carte blanche for any sort of boorish be
havior.
This attitude was beautifully demonstrated last
Thursday night at the Orchesis concert. To a capacity
crowd, many of whom were townspeople, these "rep
resentative Stanford students" exhibited the same
sort of polished manners and consideration for the
feelings and pleasure of others that has previously
evoked comment in the press.
Their keen appreciation of a somewhat more ab
stract form of expression was further shown by their
early and forceful selection of seats in the front row
center, a portion of the house in previous years roped
off as untenable or reserved for small children. No
doubt their concept of "dance" is somehow linked
with bubbles, fans, and the "bald-headed row."
It is sincerely to be hoped that the off-campus
members of the audience won't judge all of us by
their behavior.
