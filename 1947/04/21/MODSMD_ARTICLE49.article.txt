# Youth Hostel to Provide Opportunity for Students to See Post-war Europe
## 
### MAUDIE BOEHM 
Brad Breyman, Stanford economics major, would like to go to France
this summer with a work project sponsored Ly the American Youth
Hostel group.
"1 believe that the way to find out about people is by living with them,
and I'd like to get an insight on conditions in a post-war France today,"

stated the tall, blond Phi Delt. Brad.i
a photographer for the Stanford
Quad, said also that he was inter
ested in taking pictures—"lots of
pictures."
Brad and other Stanford students
who have applied for the privilege
of going with the AYH group would
like to spend their summer travel
ing in Europe but won't know until
the end of Spring quarter if they
have been accepted.
The AYH, through its headquarters
in Northfield, Mass., sponsors hostel
ing trips in Central Europe, Central
America, Mexico, Montreal and
Quebec, Scandinavia, and the Brit
ish Isles. On all these hostel trips,
hostelers must get from place to
place under their own power: bik
ing, horseback riding, or walking, ;
but absolutely no hitch-hiking.
WORK PROJECTS POPULAR
Of great interest to students all
over the United States are the spon
sored work projects consisting of ten
hostelers and a leader sent to France,
Belgium, Germany, Canada, Hol
land, and Russia. The hostelers work
for one month rebuilding hostels
destroyed during the war and help
ing out where best they can. On
weekends they will go on short
mountain climbing, hiking, or biking
trips.
After this month of work, the hos
telers tour the country for one
month. The trip costs $200 from
New York, plus passage both ways.
Anyone over 17 may apply for the
privilege of going on one of these
projects. The hostelers will be se
lected from applicants from all over
the United States on the basis of
previous hosteling camping experi
ence, and physical fitness. However, |
manual dexterity and an under
standing of post-war problems will
take precedence over other quali
fications.
OFFICIAL APPROVAL
The first of these sponsored work
projects were carried out last year,
and hostelers came back full of en
thusiasm for future trips. The proj
ects were such a success the State
Department has approved their con
tinuance.
The AYH has hostels throughout
the United States, where it costs 25
cents a night for a bed—hostelers
carry their own sleeping sacks, sil
verware and plates, while the hostels
provide blankets and cooking uten
sils.
Most AYH hostels are former
farm houses or wayside inns. Each
one has a couple in residence who act
as houseparents and care for the
hostel.
It is not essential to have had
previous hosteling experience before
taking most of the sponsored trips.
However, cycling proficiency is usu
ally necessary.
The aim ol the AYH is to provide
travel, leadership experience, and
healthful living for people of all
races, creeds, color, and from all
walks of life at a minimum cost.
