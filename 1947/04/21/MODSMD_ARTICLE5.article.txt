# Class of '49 Begins Dues Drive Today
## 
### 
Sophomore Excom will begin a
collection today of $2 from every
member of the class. Money is
needed to carry on functions of the
Class of '49 during the next two
years, said Harlan Harmsen, who
has charge of collecting dues.
The primary reason for this col
lection, said Harmsen, is the fact
that in past years classes have failed
to collect $3 from freshmen. During
the war when all freshman men did
not live in Encina, the $3 could not
be collected, and as a consequence
finances are not yet straightened out.
LOSE $400 ON COTILLION
Commenting on the financial sta
tus of the sophomore class, Harmsen
said the class started the year with
$200. In addition to the usual ex
penses, such as Quad pages, the
sophomores lost $400 on the Cotil
lion.
In their junior year, the cl°ss of
'49 will make payments of $60 for
Quad pages and $50 for the Water
Carnival. Two or three hundred
dollars' profit is exnected from the
Junior Prom, said Harmsen.,
EXPENSES LISTED
Senior year minimum expenses
will be $400 for the reunion fund.
$250 for the bronze plate, $40 for
Class Day, and $60 for Quad pages.
There are also expenses for flowers
for the Stanfords* crypt and for class
social functions.
Graduation classes make gifts to
the University costing from $200 to
$1,600.
