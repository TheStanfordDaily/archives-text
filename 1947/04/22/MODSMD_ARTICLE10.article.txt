# Housing Com Presents Woman Placement Plan
## 
### 
Housing Committee, in several meetings this quarter, has discusscd
and formulated an extensive plan for the placing of women after the
spring drawing, to be held early in May, according to Taffy Countryman,
chairman of Housing Cdmmittee.
This plan is subject to approval of Women's Conference, and will be

presented to that group this week, j
The main points of the plan are as j
follows:
1. Vacancies occurring at the end j
of spring quarter will be filled ac- j
cording to a flexible ratio determined |
by the.number of girls who arc mov
ing. This ratio will be applied to ;
'he vacancies rather than to the j
house as a whole. When there is a j
decision to be made between women )
of two different classes, placement,!
will be made with reference to the \
house makeup, that is to the propor- i
tion of each class in the house. This j
is the same plan used last spring J
quarter.
COMPROMISE PLAN MADE
2. In considering the possibility |
of giving the Roble sophomores some
sort of preference, the following j
compromise plan was worked out:
A ratio as described above would
be worked out from the entire list
of vacancies, and the number of
vacancies to be filled by each class j
in each living group would be ap- I
proximated. A number of places in
each whole group, determined by a
ratio of the number of Roble sopho
mores (present Roble girls who have j
spent five or more quarters in Ro- |

ble) in proportion to the number of
other sophomores in the drawing
.vould be reserved for the Roble
sophomores.
There will be enough places al
loted in all houses outside of Bran
ner so that Roble sophomores will
not have to move there unless they
choose to do so.

Ihore will be two days designated

come at all the living groups in one

"It is hoped that each woman will
acquaint herself fully with the terms
of this plan, so that if approved by
Women's Conference, it may have
the full cooperation of the students,"
stated Miss Countryman.

of two different classes, placement,!
will be made with reference to the \
house makeup, that is to the propor- i
tion of each class in the house. This j
is the same plan used last spring J
quarter.
COMPROMISE PLAN MADE
2. In considering the possibility |
of giving the Roble sophomores some
sort of preference, the following j
compromise plan was worked out:
A ratio as described above would
be worked out from the entire list
of vacancies, and the number of
vacancies to be filled by each class j
in each living group would be ap- I
proximated. A number of places in
each whole group, determined by a
ratio of the number of Roble sopho
mores (present Roble girls who have j
spent five or more quarters in Ro- |

ble) in proportion to the number of
other sophomores in the drawing
.vould be reserved for the Roble
sophomores.
There will be enough places al
loted in all houses outside of Bran
ner so that Roble sophomores will
not have to move there unless they
choose to do so.
iROSH SOCIAL PROGRAM
3. The freshman social program
would be as follows:
Panel discussions would be held

sentatives from Union, Lagunita,

for the time freshmen will be wel
come at all the living groups in one
area. Union will hold open house

"It is hoped that each woman will
acquaint herself fully with the terms
of this plan, so that if approved by
Women's Conference, it may have
the full cooperation of the students,"
stated Miss Countryman.
Housing Committee, in several meetings this quarter, has discusscd
and formulated an extensive plan for the placing of women after the
spring drawing, to be held early in May, according to Taffy Countryman,
chairman of Housing Cdmmittee.
This plan is subject to approval of Women's Conference, and will be

presented to that group this week, j
The main points of the plan are as j
follows:
1. Vacancies occurring at the end j
of spring quarter will be filled ac- j
cording to a flexible ratio determined |
by the.number of girls who arc mov
ing. This ratio will be applied to ;
'he vacancies rather than to the j
house as a whole. When there is a j
decision to be made between women )
of two different classes, placement,!
will be made with reference to the \
house makeup, that is to the propor- i
tion of each class in the house. This j
is the same plan used last spring J
