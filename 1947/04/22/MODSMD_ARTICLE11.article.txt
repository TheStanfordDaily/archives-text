# Senate Argues On Vet Groups
## 
### 
Of interest to veterans are two
bills now presented in the Assembly
and Senate of the California State
Legislature to amend the present
statutes which define what consti
tutes a veterans' organization.
The two bills, Assembly Bill 299
and Senate Bill 1474, are the same
in wording. They would amend the
statutes to read: '"A veterans' or
ganization consists solely of former
soldiers, sailors, and marines who
participated actively in combat
against the enemy."
The amendments were originally
intended to hit at fly-by-night vet
erans' groups, noted for laxity in
membership requirements. The pur
pose of the bills is now overshad
owed by the fact that many recog
nized veterans' groups will be out
lawed by the amendments, and will
be denied the privileges that are
granted to veterans' groups.
Among the veterans' group which
will be disfranchised by the bill arc
the Marine Corps League and the
Regular Veterans' Association, both
of which admit peacetime vets, the
AVC which admits Merchant Mari
ners, and the status of Am vets.
VFVV, and the Legion will be on the
fence because they all have a cer
tain percentage of members who
were in special {'roups connccted
with the armed forces.
The Senate Bill (1474) went out
of committee last week with a "do
pass" reommendation to the floor o!
the Senate. If it passes the Senate
the previously mentioned pro"p:
will immediately be denied the right
to meet in all public buildings or
veterans' halls. They will also be
denied the rights of the State and
National Veterans' Administration.
