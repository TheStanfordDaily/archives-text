### 
Lake Lagunita is definitely closed from now on, according to a state
mcnt issued yesterday by Eugene Mitguard, Student Manager.
"The water receded a foot in the last week, and the rate is increasing,"
he said.
"Several people have been injured in the last few days by jumping

or diving from the dock into loss
han two feet of water, where there
is evidently glass on the bottom."
"The canoes," Mitguard continued,
'now have to be launched from the
beach, which is very inconvenient.
So the lake has been closed for all
iwimming and canoeing."
Mitguard emphasized the fact
hat it will he considered a violation
of the Fundamental Standard U
wim or canoe in the lake.
The flume is wide open he said, but
only a trickle of water is running
into the lake daily.
"Certainly," he added, "if we
have more rain and the water starts
to rise, the lake will be reopened

when safety precautions are satis
"actory.
In connection with the lake's clos
ing, Marilyn Cleek and Joe Picker
ui", co-chairmen for the annual
Junior Vrter Carnival, announced
last niaht that the Carnival will not
be held this year. No suitable sub
stitute for the lake was available,
they said.
