Suspension from the University
for two quarters and failure in the
course was the sentence recom
mended by Men's Council yesterday
afternoon for three students charged
with violating the Honor Code dur
ing the Psychology (iO final exami
nation of last quarter, stated Ted
Lee, Council chairman.
The sentence came cift-Â»- a lengthy
heal ing of cross-examining the sus
pects and a careful study of the ex
amination papers which were sub
mitted to the Cot'ncil by the course
instructor as showing proof of
cheating and co-operation by the
three students, Lee said.
Council members, justifying their
decision after a bitter protest by the
suspects, reminded the students that
the sentence was sub'ect to approv
al by the Dean of Students, but in
the light of the striking similarities
of the examination papers a lighter
penalty would not be compatible
with the evidence.
Another student was sentenced to
one quarter of social probat'on for
turning in a term paper for English
oc > in whi'-h thr> instructor had out
lined portions of the text showing a
"verbatim stealing" of material from
course reference books, Lee de
clared. Council recommended that
the instructor give the student an
"F" for the paper.
Two students were fined $15 for
using the golf course without pay
ing a greens fee.
