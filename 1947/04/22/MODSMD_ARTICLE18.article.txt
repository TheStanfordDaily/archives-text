# President, Vice-President Tell Problems of Holding Office
## 
### MARGIE SAMPSON 
Although the ASSU Constitution lists the qualifications nccessary to
run for its president and viee-presidcnt, it does not give the complete
picture.
The Constitution states that to be eligible to run for any office, "the
candidate must be in good standing of this Association and must have a

"C" average, as evidenced by the
latest Directory of Officers and Stu
dents, at the time of election. . ."
When a Stanford student ran for
ASSU president or vice-president
before the war. he had a good chance
of knowing a majority of the stu
dents; there were about half as many
students on campus as there' are
now. But today the candidate has
to face the problem of getting the
votes of thousands of students whom
he hasn't had a chance to know."The
ASSU president is now less a per
sonality and more a figure in office,"
stated Martin Anderson, ASSU pres
ident. "And because of that, students
are hesitant to accept his judgments."
The average Stanford student has
either been here only for a short
time, or has had his education in
terrupted. Students have also trans
ferred from other universities. This

has caused a large turnover at the
:md of each year, so that the student
officers are not truly representing
.he student body.
"The main problem of the presi
dent is to knit the student body into
closer unity," stated Anderson.
Speaking of problems involved in
his presidency, Anderson said, "We
have approached a common ground
of understanding with the Adminis
tration. Now the problem of the stu
dent body is to get student groups
working together. All too often,
with the best of intentions, different
organizations have worked at cross
purposes."
"Ihe important qualification for
being a student officer is the ability
io get. along with people," stated
Millie Edwards, ASSU vice-presi
dent.
