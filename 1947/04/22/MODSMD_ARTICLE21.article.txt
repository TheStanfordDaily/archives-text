808 LEWIS said: "One of the
primary causes for the lack of ad
ministration-student co-operation is
the failure of many of those con
cerned to realize that there are def
inite spheres of interest into which
the various issues naturally fall."
"It is obvious to all that most mat
ters of university policy must be
finally decided by the faculty and
administration. The broad long
range policy making decisions vital
ly affecting the academic and cor
porate status of the university must
be made by men who are fully in
formed and competent to pass on
them.
INFORMED STUDENT BODY
"However, though the students do
not participate in these decisions, it
is obviously both -the duty and in
the interest of the faculty to keep
the student body fully informed on
the trend of these decisions. A tully
informed student body will be in
telligently critical, rather than harp
ing!
"The second sphere of interest is
the social and extracurricular phases
of Stanford life. Here the students
must make the final decision, for
only thus can we learn by actual
participation the duties which we
must be prepared to assume in a
democratic society.
"Ihe third area of problems is
that in which both faculty and stu
dents have a cordial interest in the
solution. It is in this most crucial
sphere of all that we must redou
ble our efforts.
'"Ihe obvious solution is the free
interchange of information between
_ne administration and the student,
oody. This interchange could best,
oe accomplished by periodic informal
neetings of student and administra
te representatives. Contemporary
problems could be aired and ade
quate publicity given to the agree
nent reached. This procedure would
eliminate the present confusion of
.urisdictional lights and enable both
the students and the administration
to extend their concerted efforts
towards a common goal."

TOM MARTZLOFF said: "I believe
that a primary function of the stu
dent body president is to act as liai
son man between the students and
the Administration. The ultimate
goal is complete harmony and co
operation, but before cooperation
can be attained there must be mu
tual understanding.
PiiEStNTS .{ PROPOSALS
"Therefore I propose in the fol
lowing order:
"(1) Adequate dissemination of
the facts influencing a decision or
change of policy via the Daily or a
special bulletin published for that
purpose.
"(2; Discussion of difficult or con
roversial points between a com
mittee of elected student leaders and
the administrative personnel con
cerned, aiming toward complete un
derstanding of both sides of the
question.
"(3) Full explanation to the stu
dent body ol all decisions reached
n these committee meetings.
"When this ground work has been
well laid, when students and ad
ministration each show an eagerness
o attain harmony, cooperation will
follow."
