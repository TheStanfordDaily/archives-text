808 LEWIS said: "One of the
primary causes for the lack of ad
ministration-student co-operation is
the failure of many of those con
cerned to realize that there are def
inite spheres of interest into which
the various issues naturally fall."
"It is obvious to all that most mat
ters of university policy must be
finally decided by the faculty and
administration. The broad long
range policy making decisions vital
ly affecting the academic and cor
porate status of the university must
be made by men who are fully in
formed and competent to pass on
them.
INFORMED STUDENT BODY
"However, though the students do
not participate in these decisions, it
is obviously both -the duty and in
the interest of the faculty to keep
the student body fully informed on
the trend of these decisions. A tully
informed student body will be in
telligently critical, rather than harp
ing!
"The second sphere of interest is
the social and extracurricular phases
of Stanford life. Here the students
must make the final decision, for
only thus can we learn by actual
participation the duties which we
must be prepared to assume in a
democratic society.
"Ihe third area of problems is
that in which both faculty and stu
dents have a cordial interest in the
solution. It is in this most crucial
sphere of all that we must redou
ble our efforts.
'"Ihe obvious solution is the free
interchange of information between
_ne administration and the student,
oody. This interchange could best,
oe accomplished by periodic informal
neetings of student and administra
te representatives. Contemporary
problems could be aired and ade
quate publicity given to the agree
nent reached. This procedure would
eliminate the present confusion of
.urisdictional lights and enable both
the students and the administration
to extend their concerted efforts
towards a common goal."

TOM MARTZLOFF said: "I believe
that a primary function of the stu

goal is complete harmony and co
operation, but before cooperation
can be attained there must be mu
tual understanding.
PiiEStNTS .{ PROPOSALS
"Therefore I propose in the fol
lowing order:
"(1) Adequate dissemination of
the facts influencing a decision or
change of policy via the Daily or a
special bulletin published for that
purpose.
"(2; Discussion of difficult or con
roversial points between a com

the administrative personnel con

derstanding of both sides of the
question.
"(3) Full explanation to the stu

"When this ground work has been
well laid, when students and ad
ministration each show an eagerness

the Administration, I would like to
propose the following:
"(1) Realization of a student-ad
ministration forum that would bring
greater cooperation and understand

"(2) Meetings should be held be

and constructive subjects that have
been submitted to the committee.
"(3) Allow the National Students

which they have gathered locally
and nationally concerning the issues,
and encourage all compus groups to
recommend new fields for discus

808 LEWIS said: "One of the
primary causes for the lack of ad
ministration-student co-operation is
the failure of many of those con
cerned to realize that there are def
inite spheres of interest into which
the various issues naturally fall."
"It is obvious to all that most mat
ters of university policy must be
finally decided by the faculty and
administration. The broad long
range policy making decisions vital
ly affecting the academic and cor
porate status of the university must
be made by men who are fully in
formed and competent to pass on
them.
INFORMED STUDENT BODY
"However, though the students do
not participate in these decisions, it
is obviously both -the duty and in
the interest of the faculty to keep
the student body fully informed on
the trend of these decisions. A tully
informed student body will be in
telligently critical, rather than harp
ing!
"The second sphere of interest is
the social and extracurricular phases
of Stanford life. Here the students
must make the final decision, for
only thus can we learn by actual
participation the duties which we
must be prepared to assume in a
democratic society.
"Ihe third area of problems is
that in which both faculty and stu
dents have a cordial interest in the
solution. It is in this most crucial
sphere of all that we must redou
ble our efforts.
'"Ihe obvious solution is the free
interchange of information between

the failure of many of those con

"It is obvious to all that most mat

"However, though the students do

"The second sphere of interest is
the social and extracurricular phases

must make the final decision, for

BILL McPIIERSON said: "I be
lieve that the students have a definite
>take in Stanford's administration;
we should not shirk the responsibil
ty of presenting our views to the
ldministration. The President of the
University has offered to talk over
administrative policies with the stu
dents. The solution to the problem
lies in the setting up of machinery
to harmonize the two, and the oper
ation of such machinery falls within
the responsibilities of the ASSU
president.
"The students and the administra
tion, after all, have the same aims
in view; that is, the benefit and im
provement of Stanford University.
Certainly a mutual understanding
and cooperation is possible when
working from this common basis.
SHOULD DISCUSS PROBLEMS
"In carrying out this program I
would suggest weekly meetings be
tween the ASSU officers and the
University President at which an
exchange of ideas and problems
would do much to increase coopera
tion and mutual understanding be
tween the two groups."

MORLEY THOMPSON said: "In
attempting to answer the question
of how one could promote greater
cooperation between students and
the Administration, I would like to
propose the following:
"(1) Realization of a student-ad
ministration forum that would bring
greater cooperation and understand
ing to our campus, and promote uni
fied action.
"(2) Meetings should be held be
fore each forum between a commit
tee of students and the Dean of Stu
dents to select the most pertinent
and constructive subjects that have
been submitted to the committee.
"(3) Allow the National Students
Organization to present to the stu
dents on the Forum information
which they have gathered locally
and nationally concerning the issues,
and encourage all compus groups to
recommend new fields for discus
sion.
