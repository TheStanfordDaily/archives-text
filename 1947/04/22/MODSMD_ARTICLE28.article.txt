## 
### 
The scourge of dreaded "spring
fever" will be isolated to the locale
around Branner Hall this Friday
evening from 9 lo 1 when Branner
residents will attempt, to inoculate
200 couples against this plague by
exposing them to the most outstand
ing characteristics of this disease,
according to Barbara Aronson,
dance chairman.
The Branner lobby will be turned
into a world infested with "spring
fever'' and preparations will include
swinging garden gates, spring flow
ers, and the music of Phil Bovero,
music director of station KGO, and
his popular San Francisco orchestra,
said Miss Aronson.
Bids for the Branner formal are
on sale now at the A.S.S.U.; they
are selling for $2 a couple, stated
Miss Aronson.
Patron and patroness for the
dance will be Dr. and Mrs. Graham
DuShane, according to Miss Aron
son.
