# Munk Announces Plans for Information
## 
### MEL HOFFMAN 
The administrative officers of the
International Information Files met
yesterday afternoon in the A.S.S.U.
office to co-ordinate publicity and
office schedules for the quarter,
chairman Alfred Munk announced.
Howard Ives, Jr., was appointed
secretary of Information Files and
will co-ordinate all matters per
taining to publicity, office hours, and
personnel among the four subcom
mittees.
Within a week Information Files
will announce its office location and
the hours during which the student
body will be able to come to the
office and receive available infor
mation.
The various subcommittees of In
formation Files will provide infor
mation on foreign schools, travel,

work abroad, and correspondence
with foreign students.
This information will be made
available to all students and will be
kept in large files staffed by mem
bers of the committees.
Ives feels that the four commit
tees — education, jobs, travel, and
correspondence — will fit together.
For example, a student wishing to
study in some European country for
three months might at the end of
that time travel for a while, or
work abroad. He might meet people
with whom either he or fellow stu
dents have been in contact through
the correspondence committee.
Education Committee
The International Education Com
mittee is headed by Lois Davidson.
Its purpose is to gather information
on tuition, curricula, and housing
accommodations at universities
abroad. It will obtain State De
partment visa regulations affecting
student travel.
Veterans are reminded by Miss
Davidson that with very few ex
ceptions all foreign schools have
been authorized for study under the
G.I. Bill of Rights.

Job (lommittee
Mellon Shelton is in charge of
foreign jobs. Her committee will
i get information from the State De-
I partmenl, appointment services, for
i eign labor offices, and other sources
about both summer and permanent
job openings abroad.
She will welcome assistance on
the committee from all students
who have lived in foreign countries'
or who have contacts abroad. Stu
| dents wanting to work with her on
; the committee should contact her
| at Hurlburt House.
Letter <kmimiltce
The correspondence committee,
headed by Lise Hofmann, will col
lect addresses of foreign students
and others with whom Stanford stu
dents can correspond. This corre
spondence will be very useful to
' American students and travelers

there, for they will find friends in
the people who have been corre
sponding with Stanford students.
Anyone with contacts abroad
who is intrested in working on this
committee, and those wishing to
correspond abroad, should contact
Miss Hofmann at Roble.
Travel Coinniiltw

tion Files is headed by Eleanor Eliel.

Students interested in working
with Miss Eliel on the committee

Also, students who are interested in
traveling abroad either this sum
mer or in the future should discuss

mation on foreign schools, travel,

work abroad, and correspondence
with foreign students.
This information will be made
available to all students and will be
kept in large files staffed by mem
bers of the committees.
Ives feels that the four commit
tees — education, jobs, travel, and
correspondence — will fit together.
For example, a student wishing to
study in some European country for
three months might at the end of
that time travel for a while, or
work abroad. He might meet people
with whom either he or fellow stu
dents have been in contact through
the correspondence committee.

been authorized for study under the
G.I. Bill of Rights.
