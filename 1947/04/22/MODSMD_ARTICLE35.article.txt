# Shuffling the Cards with DON DAVIES
## 
### 
''Dixie Howell, the human howit
zer from Hartford, Alabama, blasted
the Rose Bowl dreams of Stanford
today with one of the greatest all
around exhibitions that football has
ever known. The slender suppling
from Hartford, weighing IGI pounds,
led a passing, kicking, and running
attack to beat a big, game Stanford
team, 29-13, as 85,000 sat beneath a
blue California sky and saw the
sunny atmosphere full of flying
footballs thrown from Howell's rifle
shot hand into Don Hutson's waiting
arms.
"Dixie Howell today gave the im
pression of a Dizzy Dean throwing
strikes, an antelope along the
ground, and one of the finest kickers
the Rose Bowl has ever seen."
That was Grantland Rice's im
pression of Dixie Howell on Jan. 1,
1935. Mr. Howell will be back next
fall to plague the Stanford Indian
once again. The human howitzer
won't be filling the sunny Palo Alto
atmosphere with footballs, but he'll
be on the bench showing his Idaho
Vandals how.
Howell recently signed as head
football coach at the potato institu
tion, and he's pointing for the game
with the Cards; he'd like to put an
other black - ringed page in the
Farm's book of football.

It's going to be very hard to find
another golf coach like Eddie
Twiggs. University age - require
ment regulations will force the
Farm's golf coach to retire after
next year, but it will be a long time
before the outstanding competitive
record and the outstanding golfers
he's developed will be forgotten.
Any Stanford golfer, past or pres
ent, will tell you that Eddie's con
tributions to Stanford have been
more than his ability to teach the
game. That he is the best college
golf coach and one of the best teach
ing professionals in the country is
obvious from the record his teams
and his students have compiled. Ed
die, moreover, has been confessor,
confidant, adviser, and friend to
countless Stanfordites during the 15
years he has been at the Farm. He
has built up golf at Stanfoi'cl from
nothing to a position of national im
portance, with Stanford ranking as
the top golf school in the nation to
day.
We are in a position now to show
our appreciation to Eddie Twiggs.
By making golf an official "major"
sport, we can say thanks to Eddie
for the many things he's done for
the University and for golf.

The last - place Oakland Oaks

major league attendance by any
standards.

The first dead heat in a major
Western stakes race in years was
recorded Saturday at Tanforan.
PJerfecto, a long-shot field horse of
the Polka Dot Stable, crossed the
wire nose and nose with Hemet
Squaw. The co-owner of the Polka
Dot Stable is one Tom Lamphier, Jr.,

time their canary yellow and red
polka dots have been carried in a

Now that the Big Nine is so
chummy with the Pacific Coast Con

take steps to bring their spring prac

policies. The Coasters are limited
to 30 days of off-season practice,
while their Big Nine buddies are
not limited at all.
Many of the Western Conference
schools take advantage of this, hold

With Michigan's gridders working
out for two or three months, and the
Indians for only 30 days it seems the
Wolverines will have an advantage
when the two teams tangle.

It's going to be very hard to find
another golf coach like Eddie
Twiggs. University age - require
ment regulations will force the
Farm's golf coach to retire after
next year, but it will be a long time
before the outstanding competitive
record and the outstanding golfers
he's developed will be forgotten.
Any Stanford golfer, past or pres
ent, will tell you that Eddie's con
tributions to Stanford have been
more than his ability to teach the
game. That he is the best college
golf coach and one of the best teach
ing professionals in the country is
obvious from the record his teams
and his students have compiled. Ed
die, moreover, has been confessor,
confidant, adviser, and friend to
countless Stanfordites during the 15
years he has been at the Farm. He
has built up golf at Stanfoi'cl from
nothing to a position of national im

the top golf school in the nation to
