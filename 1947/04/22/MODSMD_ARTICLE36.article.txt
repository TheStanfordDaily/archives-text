# Footballers Have Rest
## 
### 
After two bruising scrimmage ses
sion last week, the Farm gridmen
had what was comparatively a day
of repose yesterday as Head Coach
Marchie Schwartz devoted the af
ternoon's drill to passing, kicking,
learning new plays, and other non
contact work.
Led by quarterbacks Ainslee Bell
and A 1 Morris, the varsity spent
most of the afternoon running
through line plays and end runs.
The practice session was concluded
with a passing and kicking drill.
While the varsity gridsters were
working out under Coaches
Schwartz, Bengtson, Elwood, Ham
mett, and Taylor, the greener candi
dates could be found on an adjoin
ing field receiving additional in
struction in gridiron fundamentals
from Pete Kmetovic and Fred Scrib
ner.
GET ONLY BRIEF REST
The Indian footballers' "resting
period" will be a brief one, as Head
Man Marchie plans to call two more
scrimmages this week, one on Wed
nesday, and the other on Friday. It
is through scrimmages that Schwartz
hopes to polish up the rough spots
in his team's blocking and tackling,
so the Big Red gridders are not
likely to get much of a chance to
rest up their bruised muscles dur
ing the 19 practice sessions that re
main.
Coach Schwartz announced yes
terday that offensive play will be
stressed in this week's drills, al
though defense will not be neglected.
Marchie indicated that performances
thus far have been quite satisfac
tory, and he went on to point out
that they will improve greatly as
the players gain a little more ex
perience and self confidence.
The showing of A 1 Morris at quar
terback was singled out by Stan
ford's coach as being particularly
outstanding, as was that of freshman
halfback Dave Field and ends Norm
Barnes and Don Mervin.
