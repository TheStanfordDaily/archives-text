# Chisox Find Win System

### 
NEW YORK, April 21 (UP).—The
"old m n" of the Chicago White Sox
came up today with what seemed to
be a sure-fire method of winning
ball games — they take two days of
rest between each start—and the
system has paid off by making them
the only team in the majors still
unbeaten.
They won their third straight
game today, beating the great Hal
Newhouser of the Detroit Tigers,
6 to 4. Newhouser, who was sur
prisingly wild in his second start of
the season, beaned outfielder Ralph
Hodgin in the first inning, sending
him to a hospital with a brain con
cussion. In that same session, he
gave up three walks and one hit as
the White Sox scored three times.
The Chicago Cubs won the only
other major league of the day, pick
ing up their third victory in a row
after three defeats, 3 to 0 over the
visiting Cincinnati Reds. Hank
Wyse held the Reds to one hit until
the ninth when he weakened and
allowed two more. All were singles
and Ray Lamanno got two of them.
Len Merullo led the Cubs with four
hits in as many times at bat. The
Cubs made all their runs in the sixth
off Rookie Kent Peterson when Phil
Cavaretta, Bill Nicholson, Don John
son, Merullo and Wyse hit singles.
All other major league games were
rained out.
