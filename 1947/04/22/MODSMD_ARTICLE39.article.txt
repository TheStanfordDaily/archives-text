# Crew Slates Busy Program
## 
### 
Despite lack of official support
from the University, the Indian
crew appears to be on its way up
the ladder to rowing success. The
brilliant, victorious race against Cal
last autumn, and the surprise win
over a favored Oregon State Beaver
shell at Corvallis last month attest
this fact. â€¢
Largely through the tireless ef
forts of Lou Lindsey, who takes
time out from his studies to coach
the oarsmen, the Stanford rowers
have carried on successfully in the
face of all obstacles. A 60 - man
turnout and the recently hand-built
float which now graces the Paly har
bor are further evidences of prog
ress.
In an interclass crew race Sunday
afternoon, the sophomore oarsmen
outstroked the upper - class shell.
The contest featured festivities of
the opening of the Palo Alto Yacht
Club's current season.
Rowing in winning shell were:
8, Silberling; 7, Benedict; 6, Lacy;
5, Brannaman; 4, Vander Ende; 3,
Swanson; 2, Brickman; and 1, Sncd
ecor.
The orphaned oarsmen have a full
schedule of races this spring, which
will find them meeting the strongest
crews in the West. A frosh race
against Sacramento J.C. at the cap
ital city has been booked for April
27. The Big Race against Cal has
been definitely scheduled for the
Oakland Estuary May 17, with three
boats to represent each School. One
week later, on May 24, three Cardi
nal shells will journey to Los Ange
les to meet U.C.L.A. Tentative races
with San Diego State and the mighty
University of Washington have been
planned.
