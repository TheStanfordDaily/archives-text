# St. Mary's Army Face Local Nines
## Rampaging Woltermen Meet Gaels 
### 
With their sights zeroed in
on a first division position in
the Coast Intercollegiate Base
ball Association, 21 Farm dia
mond performers journey to St.
Mary's this afternoon to open their
10,47 series against Herman Wede
meyer and company.
The Indians bounced into a third
place tie with U.C.L.A. last Friday
when the Gaels nosed the Uelans,
2 to 1, and as promptly rebounded
out again when the Bruins turned
around and defeated the Gaels in
their Saturday game, 4 to 3.
Now, the Indians can step back
up into that tie by setting St. Mary's
down this afternoon, and be in a
good position to open a second-place
campaign this Saturday when they
meet league-leading Southern Cali
fornia on the Sunken Diamond.
COULD WIND UP IN FIFTH
But if the Gaels take the Car
dinals into camp today, then St.
Mary's will be in fourth place and
the Farm performers will be rele
gated back to a lowly fifth place
berth, from which they'll have trou
ble jockeying into a first-division
finish at this, late date.
Coach Harry Wolter is taking five
pitchers with him when the squad
leaves this noon, and it's a tossup as
to just who will start for the Farm.
Wolter has Dick Flatland, Dave
Dahle, Larry Wolf, Dave Stott,
Charlie Wakefield and Don Pender
grass from which to choose his start
ing moundsmen, but the choice nar
rows down to Flatland or Dahle.
DAHLE MAY START
All Wolter would say yesterday
was "Flatland looked good," and if
the right-handed chucker is ready
to go after starting last Friday's
game, he may get the nod. But
Dahle, who pitched against Santa
Clara last week, will also be ready
to toe the slab today, in which case
he'll be seeking his second C.1.8.A.
win in three starts. Flatland has a
2-0 record for the season.
Jack Rial, the Gael hurling ace,
will probably get the starting nod
for St. Mary's, which means that
the Indian batsmen will have to
have their eyes peeled when they
go up against the speedy pitcher.
Last Friday, Rial pitched two-hit
ball in setting down the Bruins, and
allowed no hits until the sixth in
ning.
GAELS HAVE POWER
The Gaels may have won but one
game in four starts, but they still
have plenty of potential power at
the plate, nevertheless. In Wede
meyer and Bill Van Huitt, St. Mary's
has two boys who can break up a
close ball game at any time with a
long blow. Van Huitt's game win
ning homer last Friday is a case in
point.
