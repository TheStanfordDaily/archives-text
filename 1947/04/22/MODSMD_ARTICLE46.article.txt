# DAILY EDITORIALS
## A 						Custom to Change 
### 
In an editorial in Friday's paper we pointed
out the faults of our election system and sug
gested some solutions for them. The editorial
was not intended to bawl out a new and in
experienced Election Board but rather to
point out to the Student body abuses of our
system which have been going on a long time
and needlessly so. In fact the new Board
showed it had planned ahead of time by such
things as a new location for voting booths
which were more convenient and the single
ballot which was a tremendous improvement
from the individual voter's point of view.
Just because these abuses have been going
on a long time is no excuse for not anticipating
them at each election and making an effort to
correct them. No directive reports were
written by the two previous Election Board
chairmen to the present one pointing out the
faults they had come up against, and recom
mending ways of correction. These reports
could be very helpful to a new Election Board
which wants to keep previous mistakes from
happening again.
The solution to our problem of election
abuses lies in closer supervision and tighter
control over Election Board of Excom who
should make sure that the election procedure
is well safeguarded and that all possibilities
of abuse found in previous elections have
been anticipated. When an Election Board is
relatively new it is particularly important that
a well-informed Excom check on the Board's
plans.â€”N.B.
