# A
						New Solution Is Offered

### 
Housing Committee, in a meeting last week,
drew up a plan concerning the spring drawing

which will be presented to Women's Confer
ence Thursday. The committee offers this
plan as a solution to the problem of giving
the sophomores who have been forced to
live in Roble five or more quarters a fair
chance to move to another residence.
The idea of giving this entire group pref
erence over all women on campus was re
jected on the grounds that it would freeze
other sophomores.
It was decided, therefore, to reserve enough
places in all living groups on campus other
than Branner to provide for the 64 sophomores
now in Roble. This plan will not hurt any
other group's chances of moving. The number
of vacancies which will be given to one class
will be determined by a ratio of the students
drawing in that class applied to the vacancies
in each individual house.
The places reserved in every living group
for the Roble sophs will be determined by the
ratio of this group to the number of other
sophs drawing. In this way sophomores out
side of Roble will have a fair chance to move
in the spring drawing.
Housing Committee considered all sides of
the Roble sophomore problem in reaching the
above decision. The final plan was drawn
up in an effort to be fair to everyone involved
in this quarter's room drawing. Minor objec
tions may be raised to the program, but the
equality of the plan is apparent and once
again the members of Housing Committee
have shown the ability to work out student
problems with open-mindedness.—M.S.
