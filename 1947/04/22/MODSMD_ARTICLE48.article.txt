### TED NORTON 
Since the first reports of contention between the
foreign ministers were printed, which is approxi
mately ever since the ceremonial greetings required
by international protocol were exchanged, the predic
tion by the commentators and editorial writers has
been that the Moscow conference is doomed to
failure. A national news magazine predicted two
weeks ago that Secretary Marshall was even then
packing to come hojne. And still the conference is
rocking along. True, its progress is like that of the
ox-cart of California "before the gringo came," with
its solid wooden wheels squealing around an un
greased axle as the team dragged it up a dirt road
over the hills, but some progress has been made.
If the USSR and the USA, not to mention France and
Great Britain can even agree on what they disagree
on, I say that's progress. To formulate a problem, is
usually to find, at least, the direction in which the
answer lies.
After following the doings of the several Big
Four conferences that have been held since the end
of the war, I don't think that there is any question
but that bargaining with the Russians is a painful
process. It may be that the Russians merely want
to be convinced that we are in earnest; it may be
that the Red diplomats are only trying to protect
themselves against the next purge; for all I know,
Uncle Joe may get a big laugh out of driving for
eign envoys to the verge of a nervous breakdown.
But so far, where the American and other delegates

have taken a firm grip on their blood pressures and
stuck to their guns, some acceptable sort of com
promise seems to have emerged. Granted that it
takes the patience of Job and the determination of
Columbus, but where the whole principle of inter
national cooperation is at stake, where eventually
world peace may be in the balance, such patience
and determination does not seem too much to expect.
This is not an attack on the so-called Truman
Doctrine. It may be that it is the difficulties of
"doing business" with Russia- that forces us to such
heavy-handed tactics; certainly those difficulties leave
the impression that the Soviets understand and are
impressed by only the heavy hand. Nevertheless,
that we make any progress at all, that agreement can
be arrived at, that eventually all parties join in
some result, even if the give-and-take of negotiation
is carried on, as it were, with sledge-hammers rather
than foils, is both encouraging and profitable.
The usual question when I get this far through
the column is, what am I trying to say? I'm trying
to say that if we can continue to settle our inter
national problems around a conference table, we
should make every effort to do so. It has not yet
been demonstrated that we cannot. Marshall, Bevin,
Bidault, and Molotov should exhaust every effort,
whatever the strain or pressure, to maintain all
possible unity and cooperation. And in the immedi
ate situation, this means to keep the Moscow Con
ference going.
