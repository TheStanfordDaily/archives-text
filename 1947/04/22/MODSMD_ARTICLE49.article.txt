To the Editor:
I should like to add a dissenting voice to some of
the most glaring assertions of Dan Endsley in his
article on Wallace, April 16. In the first place, he
is being decidedly reckless with the truth when he
states that under Byrnes' early policy of "concilia
tion," "Russo-American relations reached their very
nadir," and that ever since they have been improving
"a bit." I submit that Byrnes never used a policy of
conciliation or "appeasement," and that he never
made a major concession that would have interfered
in any way with the nationalist aspirations of this
country.
Just for the record, after Wallace's New York
speech on foreign policy, which in Mr. Endsley's
opinion must have been shockingly "appeasing," re
lations with Russia were for a time a good deal more
cordial. And the statement that relations have "im
proved" since then must require a very unusual kind
of political blind spot! Certainly even Mr. Endsley
can see that with countries, as with people, the use
of aggressiveness does not suddenly create a beautiful
atmosphere of peace, but that on the contrary it be
gets further aggressiveness.
In his mention of the A.A.A. and the depression,
Endsley is giving only a partial economic picture.
Consumer purchasing power had not declined be
cause of high farm prices, but because of unemploy
ment and the withdrawal of investment funds. Manu
facturing producers were able to cut production when
they saw no opportunities for profit (thus, incident
ally, creating further unemployment), but the farm
ers coulcf do no such thing. As a result there was
overproduction in agriculture, and the "increasing
production" which Endsley thinks should have taken
place would have aggravated an already bad situa
tion.

Most people certainly agree with Mr. Endsley that
there is something desperately wrong when people
are starving and yet the goods of the earth are being
destroyed, but this "economy of scarcity" was not
invented by Henry Agard Wallace.
One last point, in answer to Endsley's question,
"but HOW do we reform the government of Greece?"
The question was evidently uttered in exasperation
that Mr. Wallace could even think of such a thing,
but why doesn't Endsley go to the facts for a change
and read Wallace's concrete suggestions on the sub
ject? In closing I would suggest that perhaps it is Mr.
Endsley, not Wallace, who thinks emotionally rather
than logically.

To the Editor:
Congratulations to the I.S.C. selection committee
for choosing a man like Bill Farrer for the proposed
trip to Europe this summer. Bill has expressed the
ideas which so many of us wanted the I.S.C. to adopt
for this project. He has chosen to visit the place
where he can utilize them. At' the International
Students Conference he could exchange ideas for
World Peace with students from all over the world.
World Peace is the earnest desire of students all
over the worldâ€”Bill's visit could open the door for a
unity of effort. I think the ballot will reveal that
by choosing Bill and Lawrence, the I.S.C. has re
gained our confidence, and I hope to see these two
boys sent on this important mission with the full
hearted support and good wishes of the whole student
body.
