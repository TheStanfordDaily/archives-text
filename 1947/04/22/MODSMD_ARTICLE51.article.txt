# Stanford Pioneers Held First Student Body Election in 1891
## 
### STU FITCH 
Persons fit to be in college are fit to look after their own affairs," said Dr. Jordan in his
welcome to the pioneer students at Stanford. "T he place is youro; it was made for you.''
The starting gun fired, Stanford students let go their inborn desire for leadership and on
Oct. 9, 1891 held their first student body election.
The offices of student body president and vice-president have remained fairly constant

throughout Stanford's growth, but
enforcement of conduct rules and the
basis of representation have shifted
from one group to another.
In the early days a faculty com
mittee on student aflairs dealt with
the problems and enforcement of
conduct. At the time it was sufli
cient and did not meet with student
opposition. The pioneer spirit of
comradeship between faculty and
students was so great, close coopera
tion nudged offenders back onto the
straight and narrow.
NEW BLOOD INJECTED
But as time wenr on and new
blood was injected into the student
body, students and administration
parted close company. Then drink
reared its ugly head, and following
the fatal shooting of a student in
Menlo in 1907 a bridge between stu
dents and administration was formed
by the President's Conference.
This group, composed of the best
men from each of the major de
partments as chosen by faculty su
periors, met with the president of
the University, but acted merely as
a consultant board.
BOARD GIVES WAY
In 1909 it gave way to the Uni
versity Conference, composed of
elected department representatives,
which had no power but crystallized
student opinion and started the grad
ual shift from faculty control to
student self-government.
But students were hesitant about
taking over their government and
the punishment of conduct viola
tions, and it was not until 1911 that
the women shouldered their own
responsibilities in the establishment
of the Women's Judicial Board.
Men followed suit in 1912 when a
student election made self-govern
ment an established fact at Stan
ford. The forerunner to Mert's
Council provided for an election by
upperclassmen of a committee to
supervise student behavior under
certain general rules established by
the faculty.
This set-up was successful and met
its demise only with the outbreak
of World War I, when the Student

Affairs Committee was reestablished.
In 1919 student government was
resumed.
HONOR CODE ADOPTED
By 1921, when the honor code was
adopted, student control embraced
all disciplinary matters and lead to
the establishment of the Men's and

Women's Councils as the Farm's
judiciary boards.
Excoin was shaped through trials
and periods of change. Student
representation jumped from depart
ments to residents of itidividual liv
ing groups, on to the present set-up
of district representation.

straight and narrow.
NEW BLOOD INJECTED
But as time wenr on and new
blood was injected into the student
body, students and administration
parted close company. Then drink
reared its ugly head, and following
the fatal shooting of a student in
Menlo in 1907 a bridge between stu
dents and administration was formed
by the President's Conference.
This group, composed of the best
men from each of the major de
partments as chosen by faculty su
periors, met with the president of
the University, but acted merely as
a consultant board.
BOARD GIVES WAY
In 1909 it gave way to the Uni
versity Conference, composed of
elected department representatives,
which had no power but crystallized
student opinion and started the grad
ual shift from faculty control to
student self-government.
But students were hesitant about
taking over their government and
the punishment of conduct viola
tions, and it was not until 1911 that
the women shouldered their own
responsibilities in the establishment
of the Women's Judicial Board.
Men followed suit in 1912 when a
student election made self-govern
ment an established fact at Stan
ford. The forerunner to Mert's
Council provided for an election by
upperclassmen of a committee to
supervise student behavior under
certain general rules established by
the faculty.
This set-up was successful and met
its demise only with the outbreak
of World War I, when the Student

Affairs Committee was reestablished.
In 1919 student government was
resumed.
HONOR CODE ADOPTED
By 1921, when the honor code was
adopted, student control embraced
all disciplinary matters and lead to
the establishment of the Men's and

Women's Councils as the Farm's
judiciary boards.
Excoin was shaped through trials
and periods of change. Student
representation jumped from depart
ments to residents of itidividual liv
ing groups, on to the present set-up
of district representation.
Persons fit to be in college are fit to look after their own affairs," said Dr. Jordan in his
welcome to the pioneer students at Stanford. "T he place is youro; it was made for you.''
The starting gun fired, Stanford students let go their inborn desire for leadership and on
Oct. 9, 1891 held their first student body election.
The offices of student body president and vice-president have remained fairly constant

throughout Stanford's growth, but
enforcement of conduct rules and the
basis of representation have shifted
from one group to another.
In the early days a faculty com
mittee on student aflairs dealt with
the problems and enforcement of
conduct. At the time it was sufli
cient and did not meet with student
opposition. The pioneer spirit of
comradeship between faculty and
students was so great, close coopera
tion nudged offenders back onto the
straight and narrow.
