# Greek Aid Bill Passes In Senate
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 22 (UP).—
President Truman's $400,000,000
program to quarantine Greece and
Turkey against Communism re
ceived Senate approval today de
spite the alarmed cries of its foes
that it was "a declaration of war
with Russia."
The non-interventionist minority
was overwhelmed by a roll-call vote
if 0? to 23 on the overall bill.
They failed by an even wider
margin of 68 to 22 to obtain pas
sage of an emasculating amendment
which would have banned all mili
tary supplies from the program and
cut Turkey out entirely.
A motion by Sen. Edward V. Rob
ertson, R., Wyo., to shelve the en
tire program was rejected just be
fore the final tally bv the same mar
gin accorded the bill itself.
The only restrictive amendment
tacked onto the bill in the final
flurry was sponsored by Sen. Edwin
C. Johnson, D„ Colo., specifying
that the United States would not
underwrite agreements between
American oil companies and Middle
Easetrn governments.
Final passage now is up to the
House, which is scheduled to begin
debate next week. House leaders
plan to limit oratory and put the
legislation on the President's desk
within the same week —one month
after Mr. Truman's original dead
line.
