# Presidential Nominees Discuss I.S.C. Question
## 
### 
What is your stand on the continuation cf the 1.5.C.? This
was the second of three questions presented to the four candi
dates for president, Morley Thompson, Bill McPherson, Tom
Martzloff, and Bob Lewis. The final question pertaining to rais
ing funds for a new pavillion will be discussed by the nominees

tomorrow. y
MORLEY THOMPSON said
"Tomorrow the students of Stanford
are going to vote on the plan set
forth hy the International Survey
Committee. If this proposal is adopt- j
ed it will be the duty of your student
body president next fall to see that
the results of the trips are properly
compiled and presented in a manner
that will reach the most students, i
and to sunervise the maintenance of
contacts made abroad by Stanford's
representatives.
WOULD COORDINATE PLAN
"With adoption may come future
exchange student, relationships with ,
foreign universities and as your
president, I would do everything
possible to coordinate your plan
with international groups and drives.
However, if the voters defeat the
proposal tomorrow, the issue is
automatically dead. But regardless
of the success or failure of the pro
posed survey we must not lose
sight of our movement and objec
tives in international activities. At
all times it would be your president's
privilege to support relief drives
and aid the international groups on
camnus in the most effective man
ner."
BILL McPIIERSON said: "I firmly
believe that the ISC program, in
principle, has a definite place under
the International Institute. How
ever, I feel that, at present, insuf
ficient preparation has been put into
the planning of the trips abroad, pre
paring the two students selected for
the tour, and defining the missions
of these students after they reach
their destination. For example, I
believe that proficiency in the lan
guage of the countries visited is an
essential prerequisite. This has not
been considered necessary by the
ISC.
GIVE ISC SUPPORT
"Although these shortcomings do
exist, the ISC must have the sup
port of the students so that the plan
can be further perfected. Efforts
have been made to overcome m?ny
of these weaknesses so that the
students selected for the trip this
summer will not be handicapped by
the lack of time for preparation. I,
therefore, feel that the ISC should
be supported and given the oppor- I
tunity to work out more completely
their plans in the coming year."
TOM MARTZLOFF said: "Inter
national understanding is an irre- j
lutably worthy goal. ISC trips need
not be regarded as the final expres
sion of Stanford's progress toward
this end. There remain—even if
these surveys prove effective —addi-
tional measurers for the promotion
of international understanding.
FURTHER SUGGESTIONS
"In the future, the following
might be profitably considered either
as alternatives or supplementary to
ISC: (1) An expanded and more
representative student - exchange i
program; (2) lecture series by quali- 1
fled persons from abroad and stu- |
dents who arc well-informed as a
result of personal experience.
"This list is offered merely as a
suggestion and must not be con
strued as being all-inclusive.
"However, my opinion on this
matter as a candidate is irrelevant.
The referendum will decide the fu
ture of the ISC.'
808 LEWIS said: "The personal
opinion of the next student body
president on ISC should have no
effect on the outcome of the present
plan. Whoever is elected must be
bound by the ma ority vote on
tomorrow's referendum on the ISC.
"I believe that the motive which j
inspired the ISC—the desire to fos- |
tcr an awareness of international
problems on American campuses —
is a worthy one. But this is as far
as I can endorse the present plans, j
ISC ALONE WORTHLESS
"I feel that the ISC is worthless
by itself. What we need is a direct
exchange between Stanford and for
eign universities, a plan where six
or eight Stanford' students lrom
various living groups would give
up their rooms for a year to foreign I
students and would themselves go j
abroad and occupy the university j
quarters of the foreign exchange j
students: whereby the Stanford stu
dent body would have a chance to I
irmke contacts with these exchange
students that would carry over
when they return to their native j
country; whereby the student body
could hear about a particular coun
try not only from its representative
here, but at the same time from our
Stanford student over there; where
by we would have continuous con
tact with other countries here on
campus, through its native son in
each major living group.
"An undertaking as important as
bettering international relations is
worth an all-out effort on our part.
A definite plan, similar to the one
outlined above, would be a real step
toward international thinking, wor
thy of a school like Stanford."

exchange between Stanford and for
eign universities, a plan where six
or eight Stanford' students lrom
various living groups would give
up their rooms for a year to foreign I
students and would themselves go j
abroad and occupy the university j
quarters of the foreign exchange j
students: whereby the Stanford stu
dent body would have a chance to I
irmke contacts with these exchange
students that would carry over
when they return to their native j
country; whereby the student body
could hear about a particular coun
try not only from its representative
here, but at the same time from our
Stanford student over there; where
by we would have continuous con
tact with other countries here on

each major living group.

bettering international relations is
worth an all-out effort on our part.
A definite plan, similar to the one

thy of a school like Stanford."
What is your stand on the continuation cf the 1.5.C.? This
was the second of three questions presented to the four candi
dates for president, Morley Thompson, Bill McPherson, Tom
Martzloff, and Bob Lewis. The final question pertaining to rais
ing funds for a new pavillion will be discussed by the nominees

tomorrow. y
MORLEY THOMPSON said
"Tomorrow the students of Stanford
are going to vote on the plan set
forth hy the International Survey
Committee. If this proposal is adopt- j
ed it will be the duty of your student
body president next fall to see that
the results of the trips are properly
compiled and presented in a manner
that will reach the most students, i
and to sunervise the maintenance of
contacts made abroad by Stanford's
representatives.
WOULD COORDINATE PLAN
"With adoption may come future
exchange student, relationships with ,
foreign universities and as your
president, I would do everything
possible to coordinate your plan
with international groups and drives.
However, if the voters defeat the
proposal tomorrow, the issue is
automatically dead. But regardless
of the success or failure of the pro
posed survey we must not lose
sight of our movement and objec
tives in international activities. At
all times it would be your president's
privilege to support relief drives
and aid the international groups on
camnus in the most effective man
ner."
BILL McPIIERSON said: "I firmly
believe that the ISC program, in
principle, has a definite place under
the International Institute. How
ever, I feel that, at present, insuf
ficient preparation has been put into
the planning of the trips abroad, pre
paring the two students selected for
the tour, and defining the missions
of these students after they reach
their destination. For example, I
believe that proficiency in the lan
guage of the countries visited is an
essential prerequisite. This has not
been considered necessary by the
ISC.
GIVE ISC SUPPORT
"Although these shortcomings do
exist, the ISC must have the sup
port of the students so that the plan
can be further perfected. Efforts
have been made to overcome m?ny
of these weaknesses so that the
students selected for the trip this
summer will not be handicapped by
the lack of time for preparation. I,
therefore, feel that the ISC should
be supported and given the oppor- I
tunity to work out more completely
their plans in the coming year."
TOM MARTZLOFF said: "Inter
national understanding is an irre- j
lutably worthy goal. ISC trips need
not be regarded as the final expres
sion of Stanford's progress toward
this end. There remain—even if
these surveys prove effective —addi-
tional measurers for the promotion
of international understanding.
FURTHER SUGGESTIONS
"In the future, the following
might be profitably considered either
as alternatives or supplementary to

the planning of the trips abroad, pre
paring the two students selected for
the tour, and defining the missions
of these students after they reach
their destination. For example, I
believe that proficiency in the lan
guage of the countries visited is an
essential prerequisite. This has not
been considered necessary by the
ISC.
GIVE ISC SUPPORT
"Although these shortcomings do
exist, the ISC must have the sup
port of the students so that the plan
can be further perfected. Efforts
have been made to overcome m?ny
of these weaknesses so that the
students selected for the trip this
summer will not be handicapped by
the lack of time for preparation. I,
therefore, feel that the ISC should
be supported and given the oppor- I
tunity to work out more completely
their plans in the coming year."
TOM MARTZLOFF said: "Inter
national understanding is an irre- j
lutably worthy goal. ISC trips need
not be regarded as the final expres
sion of Stanford's progress toward
this end. There remain—even if
these surveys prove effective —addi-
tional measurers for the promotion
of international understanding.
FURTHER SUGGESTIONS
"In the future, the following
might be profitably considered either
as alternatives or supplementary to
ISC: (1) An expanded and more
representative student - exchange i
program; (2) lecture series by quali- 1
fled persons from abroad and stu- |
dents who arc well-informed as a
result of personal experience.
"This list is offered merely as a
suggestion and must not be con
strued as being all-inclusive.
"However, my opinion on this
matter as a candidate is irrelevant.
The referendum will decide the fu
ture of the ISC.'

opinion of the next student body

ISC ALONE WORTHLESS
"I feel that the ISC is worthless

exchange between Stanford and for
eign universities, a plan where six
or eight Stanford' students lrom

students and would themselves go j
abroad and occupy the university j
quarters of the foreign exchange j

country; whereby the student body
could hear about a particular coun

What is your stand on the continuation cf the 1.5.C.? This
was the second of three questions presented to the four candi
dates for president, Morley Thompson, Bill McPherson, Tom
Martzloff, and Bob Lewis. The final question pertaining to rais
ing funds for a new pavillion will be discussed by the nominees

tomorrow. y
MORLEY THOMPSON said
"Tomorrow the students of Stanford
are going to vote on the plan set
forth hy the International Survey
Committee. If this proposal is adopt- j
ed it will be the duty of your student
body president next fall to see that
the results of the trips are properly
compiled and presented in a manner
that will reach the most students, i
and to sunervise the maintenance of
contacts made abroad by Stanford's
representatives.
WOULD COORDINATE PLAN
"With adoption may come future
exchange student, relationships with ,
foreign universities and as your
president, I would do everything
possible to coordinate your plan
with international groups and drives.
However, if the voters defeat the
proposal tomorrow, the issue is
automatically dead. But regardless
of the success or failure of the pro
posed survey we must not lose
sight of our movement and objec
tives in international activities. At
all times it would be your president's
privilege to support relief drives
and aid the international groups on
camnus in the most effective man
ner."
