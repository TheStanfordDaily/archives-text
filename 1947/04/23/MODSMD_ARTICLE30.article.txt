Stanford Flying Club members

Lull, club president, said yesterday.
The contest will be held at Bu
chanan Field near Concord, 40 miles
north of here.
Flyers interested in participating
in the plane meet may attend to
day's club meeting or call Lull at
the Theta Delta Chi house. Events
for the contest are 720-degree and
180 - degree spot landings, paper
cutting, and bombing runs from a
height of 500 feet. Additional events
may be added before the May 4
meet, Lull said.
Farm pilots may rent planes from
Palo Alto or Buchanan airports by
placing their reservations with Lull.
Passengers will be permitted to ac
company pilots in the three events.

* students are studying under this
program; 43 are veterans.
With passing years, the program
is expected to equip a growing
number of young Americans to un
derstand international problems and
i to train them for vocations in the
international field.
"Something needs to be done
about world affairs â€” that was the
i general tenor of veterans' requests
for training," says Dr. Philip W.
Buck, chairman of the committee of
I the School of Social Sciences in
charge of the program.
"Practical results," explains Dr.
Buck, "are what we have kept in
mind continually ever since we put
together the curriculum. . . . We
want to keep the program realistic.
. . . Applicants are chosen on the
basis of seriousness of purpose, and
a high level of accomplishment is
expected from them."
The documents in the Hoover War
Library as well as the Stanford
Food Research Institute, the de
partments of Political Science, Eco
nomics-Sociology, and History are
tied into the program.
International relations is given
full academic status in the Univer
sity and students may proceed from
the Bachelor's degree to the Mas
ter's and Ph.D. degrees. This differ
entiates the program from those of
many other universities in the Uni
ted States which have offered grad
uate training for foreign service, or
have given general courses in inter
national relations.
"We discourage students from
spreading themselves over the
whole field of international affairs,"
Dr. Buck stated, "and encourage
specialization."
