# Gaels Trounce Cardinal Nine9 11-3
## Stanford Skids to Fifth Place in P.C.C. Standings 
### STU MILLAR 
Stanford's baseball team was dispossessed from its fourth
place conference standing yesterday when a smoking hot St.
Mary's nine practically knocked them off the Moraga diamond.
The score was 11 to 3.
The Gaels fattened their batting averages off three Indian

hurlers, Dick Flatland, Dave Stott
and Larry Wolf. They accumulated
eighteen base knocks in the course
of the afternoon.
Meanwhile, St. Mary's Jack Rial
who had a fast one AND a curve
that consistently fooled the locals,
whiffed eleven Stanford batters and
allowed only six hits.
Prospects looked good for the
Farm in the first inning when, with
two out and Bill Arce on second,

three more on five consecutive hits
and another Cardinal infield bobble.
And as if not content, the inhospit
able Gaels scored thrice more in the
eighth.
A lone Stanford tally in the same
inning didn't even brighten the
team's spirits, let alone help the
cause.
The tail end of the St. Mary's bat
ting order provided most of the
batting punch. Wes Colgan, Duayne
Kling, Ray White, and Rial, him
self. produced eleven of the hits
and nine of the runs between them.
Herm Wedemeyer managed only
one cheap hit for the afternoon.

Stanford unleashed its only display
of concerted power all afternoon.
Lloyd Merriman larruped a single
into center field to knock in Arce
and scored three pitches later when
Frank MacGraw laced a long, roll
ing triple into right-center field.
But that was all for six whole
innings as the Indians went down in
straight order before the quick Gael
hurler. .
Meanwhile Dick Flatland, though
pounded for a half a dozen hits, had
scraped through to the end of the
fifth with a 2 to 1 lead. But when
the blond righty got in trouble in
the sixth, Coach Harry Wolter jerked
him in favor of the heretofore sensa
tional Dave Stott.
However young Dave—and the in
field behind him—were then com
pletely befuddled by a Gael bunt
ing exhibition that kept the bases
packed and the home stands cheer
ing. The Gaels scored four runs in
that inning on four hits plus a pair
of Stanford errors.

one cheap hit for the afternoon.

Stanford unleashed its only display
of concerted power all afternoon.
Lloyd Merriman larruped a single
into center field to knock in Arce
and scored three pitches later when
Frank MacGraw laced a long, roll
ing triple into right-center field.
But that was all for six whole
innings as the Indians went down in
straight order before the quick Gael
hurler. .
Meanwhile Dick Flatland, though
pounded for a half a dozen hits, had
scraped through to the end of the
fifth with a 2 to 1 lead. But when
the blond righty got in trouble in
the sixth, Coach Harry Wolter jerked
him in favor of the heretofore sensa
tional Dave Stott.
However young Dave—and the in
field behind him—were then com
pletely befuddled by a Gael bunt
ing exhibition that kept the bases
packed and the home stands cheer
ing. The Gaels scored four runs in
that inning on four hits plus a pair
of Stanford errors.

as they dropped the count to the
Gaels, 11-3,
Stanford's baseball team was dispossessed from its fourth
place conference standing yesterday when a smoking hot St.
Mary's nine practically knocked them off the Moraga diamond.
The score was 11 to 3.
The Gaels fattened their batting averages off three Indian

hurlers, Dick Flatland, Dave Stott
and Larry Wolf. They accumulated
eighteen base knocks in the course
of the afternoon.
Meanwhile, St. Mary's Jack Rial
who had a fast one AND a curve
that consistently fooled the locals,
whiffed eleven Stanford batters and
allowed only six hits.
Prospects looked good for the
Farm in the first inning when, with
two out and Bill Arce on second,

three more on five consecutive hits
and another Cardinal infield bobble.
And as if not content, the inhospit
able Gaels scored thrice more in the
eighth.
A lone Stanford tally in the same
inning didn't even brighten the
team's spirits, let alone help the
cause.
The tail end of the St. Mary's bat
ting order provided most of the
batting punch. Wes Colgan, Duayne
Kling, Ray White, and Rial, him
self. produced eleven of the hits
and nine of the runs between them.
Herm Wedemeyer managed only
one cheap hit for the afternoon.
