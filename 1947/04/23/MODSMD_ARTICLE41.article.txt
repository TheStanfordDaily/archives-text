# Indian Net Team Awaits Crucial California Tilt
## 
### 
Stanford's embattled tennis team takes a well-earned rest this
week after their disastrous two day stand against U.S.C. and
C.O.P. last weekend. The vacation will come to an abrupt end
on May 3 when the Indians journey to Berkeley to battle the Bears.
Coach Elwyn Bugge sends a grimly determined squad into

the Berkeley matches, for this is the
best Cardinal chance to annex a
league victory. The Southland mem
bers of the PCC conference, U.S.C.
and U.C.L.A., are overwhelming fav
orites to romp to the win and place
positions in the Conference stand
ings.
Such a distressing situation in
Bay area tennis circles leaves the
Bears and Indians to battle it out
for third place. The locals are gun
ning for a win to dunk the Ber
keyites in the league cellar.
Despite the trouncing that the
Trojans administered to the Indians
last Friday, Stanford fans are optim
istic for success in the California
series. First of all, U.S.C. contin
ued its tour of Northern California
last Saturday by waxing the Bears
by the same 8-1 score. The lone
Berkeley win also came in the sixth
singles slot that Ross Hughes won
for Stanford against Troy.
More reassuring for Coach Bugge
are the comparative scores against
College of Pacific. California drop
ped a decisive 6-3 loss to the Tigers
last week. Meanwhile, the Indians
were only out-hustled at the last
minute when the Tigers eked out a
5-4 victory.
At any rate, the Berkeley fracas
next week should be extremely close,
with the slight edge going to the
locals. The second league battle for
Stanford will be an important one in
determining how the locals will fare
in future Conference tilts.
While the varsity stays away from
inter-collegiate competition, the
Junior Varsity takes on San Jose
State at the local courts next Wed

nesday. Right now, the young In
dian netmen are working on an un
defeated record which will meet
the acid test against the powerful
Spartans.
