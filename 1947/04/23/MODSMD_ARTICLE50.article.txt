## Vote Yes on No. 1

In addition to deciding new student body
officers and Excom members, tomorrow's
election will decide whether or not the Inter
national Survey Committee is to become a
part of the Institute of International Relations.
During the past two quarters the campus
has been swayed first one way and then the
other on the question of the ISC. Most of the
opposition to it has come from students who
feel that the ISC is not the proper way to
launch campus international activities.
Alternate plans to the ISC were taken into
consideration by Excom when they tackled
the job of integrating various internationally
interested groups into one organization.
After several weeks of work, discussion and
arguments, the Excom-appointed temporary
chairman was able to present to Excom a
constitution which included all the interna
tional groups and coordinated their work
through one organization.
This constitution was approved during dead
week of last quarter, and is now in operation.
The ISC has been magnified all out of pro
portion in the minds of most persons. It is
really only one part of the over-all program
of the Institute of International Relations.
But it is a necessary part of the program, and
will assist the other phase of the Institute in
carrying out their work.
Because of this the ISC needs your approval
in tomorrow's election.
