Proposition 2 on Thursday's ballot refers
to electioneering.
At present, in accordance with section two
of article five of the A.S.S.U. constitution,
candidates for office are not allowed to spend

money for electioneering, have written cam
paign literature, or distribute campaign ma
terial.
Proposition 2 would change this section so
that each candidate for A.S.S.U. president and
vice-president would be allowed to spend
fifteen dollars on his or her campaign. Other
candidates would be allowed to spend ten
dollars on their individual campaigns. All
prohibitions on written or distributed cam
paign literature would be abolished by this
proposition.
If this proposition is passed the question
of electioneering will have just begun. How
will Excom audit the individual campaign ac
counts? If a candidate has access to a print
shop and does his own printing of election
eering pamphlets, does this constitute an "ex
penditure"? If another candidate has a friend
who owns a plane and that friend "skywrites"
the candidate's name above the Hoover War
Memorial Tower at high noon, does that con
stitute five dollars of campaigning or just a
gesture of friendship?
Stanford would undoubtedly benefit if
changes were allowed in the present system
of electioneering. Candidates would be able
to use a little initiative and reach a few more
students.
But isn't putting the question on a monetary
basis the wrong approach?
Merely because one can find fault in the
present election system is not sufficient rea
son for voting yes on proposition 2. It should
be decided if the proposed change will ac
tually improve the elections.
With the present wording, Proposition 2
should be defeated as it offers no solution to
the problem it aims to eliminate.—G.C.
