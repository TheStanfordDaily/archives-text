To the Editor:
Mr. Bruchler apparently cannot believe a lot of
things he does not want to believe. Taking several
of the clearer items in his letter:
We will not be "acting alone" in our policies, but
will have the active cooperation and support of the
"majority of the other nations of the world." The
only reason we do not and can not use the machinery
of the United Nations rather than thus bypassing it,
is that the USSR has hopelessly jammed the mech
anism by vetoing every proposal that remotely
touches her policy.
Was it noticed that Gromyko attacked the amend
ment to the Aid to Greece and Turkey Bill rather than
the bill itself. The amendment relinquishes our veto
power over the actions of the United Nations regard
ing it, and thus not only ruins the propaganda value
of the bill to Russia, but if generally applied, would
clearly show Russia to be the only world power afraid
of peace or the United Nations. No wonder Mr.
Gromyko was embarrassed. Too many people are
intentionally ignoring this most vital and illuminat
ing matter.
I thought that I had pointed out that in a vital
struggle between the powers of Freedom (more or
less) and the powers of Totalitarianism (totally),
we cannot further weaken our stand by idealogical
considerations, when our opponents have no such
scruples. At least we encourage democracy (our
kind, not theirs) in our satellites, whereas the Rus
sians would totally crush all freedom if we let them
take over, as they have shown they would if they
could.
The fallacy of appeasement was so clearly shown
after Munich, that it is astounding that it should ever
again appear. Every firm diplomatic stand we have
taken has met with success, eventually, but every
attempted appeasement has only brought more im
possible demands. As long as Russia plays power
politics, we have no choice; like war, it takes only
one to wage, while peace and cooperation require
everyone's assistance and willingness. It is Russia
that will not resort to the World Court or the United
Nations, nor abide by their decisions.
Regarding people's "Right to Eat'' (a fictitious
and modern concept having no existence in nature),
will we best serve the peoples of the world by feed
ing those who would destroy us, the goose that lays
the golden egg? Moreover, can anyone expect Congress
to go on financing such a program? Would it not be
better to feed some than none at all?
Besides, if Poland, Yugoslavia, and all the rest are
so willing to look to Russia for political and every
other kind of guidance and control, why should they
not look to the vast graineries of the Ukraine for food?
If Russia wants satellites, let her feed them. We
have enough to take care of in our own country. Un
til the standard of living in Greece and France is
raised to a decent subsistence level, why should
we shoulder other burdfns?
Incidentally, the recent article of Mr. Churchill
in "Life" is a rather excellent rebuttal of many of the
attacks upon him. I believe his "documentary evi
dence" is at least as valid as Mr. Mandel's, and his
interpretation is far less tortured. It is very easy to
attack Britain when you conveniently forget the
relevant factors causing her policies. Could we have
done better under the circumstances?
Perhaps Mr. Brucliier finds the truth hard to find
because the truth he seeks is non-existant. The situ
ation, though painful, seems nonetheless clear to
most of us.

To the Editor:
In the Daily of April 21 Mr. Bernard Hartman,
Jr. recited for us the rather unsatisfactory living
conditions under which his family is living on the
present subsistence allowance of ninety dollars
per month while he goes to school. He then went
on to state his opposition to any increase in this

allowance. We all admire, I'm sure, the spirit of Mr.
Hartman and his family. At the same time I believe
there are some fallacies in his argument which are
rather easily exposed if we apply his statements to
the great group of student veterans.
In the first place what Mr. Hartman is essen
tially supporting is the age-old theory of the sur
vival of the fittest. When he says, "College is a
privilege, not a heritage, as some people think," he
seems also to be saying that while education in and
of itself may be valuable, another and possibly a
more important value comes from the accompanying
struggle to achieve it. He seems to infer that there
is some inherent good found in the tensions, the wor
ries, and the fears that beset mankind when his back
is against an economic wall and an emergency sick
ness or other unexpected crisis can not be met ade
quately. If this is true why do we bother with free
public education at all? If education for all who are
willing and capable to receive it is not a necessity
for living intelligently and richly in a democracy, but
only a luxury to be made difficult to secure and
limited in its availability, then Mr. Hartman is right,
and we can go back to the days of our fathers when
it was assumed that the struggle for life was the
real builder of character and that the more difficult,
trying, and bare was one's existence, the more
eminently qualified it would make him for future
work and leadership. The doctrine, you see, of the
earth belongs to the strong.
But if we believe that education can not only
enrich life, but is absolutely necessary for the very
existence of democracy, then shouldn't we be always
striving to make it more and more easily available
and wider in its scope and meaning? Present day
leaders in the field of mental health have been trying
to show us for a long time that rather than enriching
life and strengthening character, tensions, worries,
and feelings of economic insecurity are really ex
tremely harmful to one's total physical good health
and well-being. If our society is really to be a pro
gressive and enlightened one should we not be at
tempting to help all our citizens achieve a reason
able amount of financial security, adequate living
conditions, and thereby help them to a mental con
dition conducive to effective studying and learning?
Have we already thrown overboard the last two of
the late President Roosevelt's "Four Freedoms?"
Let us not exalt in our privations and in the sub
standard living conditions of some our students and
of so many of our non-students. Rather, let us look
on it as a present tragedy, but as an opportunity for
work and improvement. I believe an increase in the
subsistence allowance for student veterans with
children would be a step in the right direction.

To the Editor:
Of course it all depends on the way individuals
look at things, and what is more important than in
dividual expression, but it looks as if Stanford
students have a chance to write a little "history" of
their own come Thursday, election day.
I am referring to the ISC issue which will be in
the ballot. Admitting that the plan has been idealistic,
vague, and that its aims were much too high at its
inception, it is still a very good thing. And something
which will irrevocably tie Stanford to the Inter
national idt'al.
As now presented, and with the two able men
who will represent us overseas to make the neces
sary contacts and lay the groundwork for future
participation of this University in world student or
ganizations, relief drives, etc., the plan is an integral
part of new international set-up on the campus, and
will support and be supported (Dy the other organi
zations.
The trips this summer will only be a start, but the
reports will be invaluable as supplements to modern
history and Poly Sci courses.
