"If Excom approve.'* our plan to
night, Iho student. administration
forum will start within a week,"
declared Ann Lilienthal, Cardinal
president.
"Cardinals feels that we have (lie
on this plan as a result
of NSO's poll of student opinion
'aken recently," she said. "Most of
the students believed that there was
a need for something in thr nature
if active student-administration re
lations."
Meanwhile, Janet Vester, commis
sion chairman of Ihr NSO had some
comment on the poll itself.
She said, "I don't like to say that
it wasn't a valid poll. However, the
time element necessitated our taking
the poll over the weekend; so we
probably didn't net a real cross
section of students.
"Even if the poll didn't represent
all the students, it did represent all
the sides on the issue. And we
found that most persons either en
thusiastically supported the idea or
nit the need but didn't think a forum
was the solution," Miss Vester
stated.
Miss Lilienthal maintained, "The
students must realize that this won't
just be a cure for the ills of the
Stanford campus. It will prevent
the ills. If this forum functions
effectively people won't have to
worry about problemsâ€”there won't
be any."
Poorest response to NSO's poll was
at' Stanford Village. "The fact that
only two questionnaires were re
turned from the Village shows a def
inite lack of interest from that sec
tion of the campus," said Miss Ves
ter.
