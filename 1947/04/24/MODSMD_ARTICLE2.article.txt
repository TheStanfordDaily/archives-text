# Polls Open At 8:30; 90 Candidates Vie
## MORE ABOUT Candidates' Views 
### 
Stanford's student body goes to
the polls today to make the final
.selection of officers as 90 candidates
vie for i!l positions on the ballot.
Three propositions will also be
put before the voters today: the
question of whether the ISC should
be continued; whether funds should
be used in electioneering, and the
question of a 30-day interim be
tween the nomination and election
of yell leaders.
Polls located at the Post Office,
Lagunita, the Cellar, Library, and
Encina Commons will be open from
<S:.'>o a.m. to ;J:3O p.m. The Village
Poll, placed at the dining hall exit,
will open at 7 a.m. and close at
3:ISO p.m.
The preferential system will be

used in this final election, the voter
making first, second, and third
choices as specified on the ballot,
Gordon Ness, election board chair
man, stated.
A student body card will be a
prerequisite to voting, Ness said.
He further announced that several
preventive measures, which he re
fused to divulge, will be used in
today's elections, since it became
obvious in the primary election last
week that students weren't applying
the Fundamental Standard to vot
ing.

ballot, the election board head said.

MORLEY THOMPSON said: "It
is perfectly evident to all that we
need a new pavilion and the ques
tion i.s just how are we going to get
the money to build it. First of all,
! I would like to say that the funds
can come from but one source, that is
the SAC. The SAC can draw on
I football funds in future years, a
group of pavilion subscribers, and
a loan should be made—and repaid
by the proceeds. Additional funds
might be raised as they are at the
University of Oregon by sending
their basketball team to Madison
Square Gardens. However, not one
cent should come from the ASSU be
cause we already are under the debt
of the present memorial auditorium."
808 LEWIS said: "The need for
a new pavilion has been obvious to
both students and faculty alike for
many years. Eventually we will
get one. The quickest way to sat
isfy this need is for the students to
take the lead in raising funds. There
fore, I would favor a plan whereby
students would add a definite amount
of money to the ASSU dues for the
express purpose of building a pavil
ion. Left over money from various
organizations and living groups each
quarter could also go into a pavilion
fund. When we have the ball roll
ing then is the time to get all pos
sible aid from the alumni through
donations. A new pavilion would
be a paying proposition. If the stu
dents are willing to back this drive
now, we could start on a new pavil
ion just as soon as building con
ditions are stabilized enough to
permit the total cost to be accur
ately determined."

MORLEY THOMPSON said: "It
is perfectly evident to all that we
need a new pavilion and the ques
tion i.s just how are we going to get
the money to build it. First of all,
! I would like to say that the funds
can come from but one source, that is
the SAC. The SAC can draw on
I football funds in future years, a
group of pavilion subscribers, and
a loan should be made—and repaid
by the proceeds. Additional funds
might be raised as they are at the
University of Oregon by sending
their basketball team to Madison
Square Gardens. However, not one
cent should come from the ASSU be
cause we already are under the debt
of the present memorial auditorium."
808 LEWIS said: "The need for
a new pavilion has been obvious to
both students and faculty alike for
many years. Eventually we will
get one. The quickest way to sat
isfy this need is for the students to
take the lead in raising funds. There
fore, I would favor a plan whereby
students would add a definite amount
of money to the ASSU dues for the
express purpose of building a pavil
ion. Left over money from various
organizations and living groups each
quarter could also go into a pavilion
fund. When we have the ball roll
ing then is the time to get all pos
sible aid from the alumni through
donations. A new pavilion would
be a paying proposition. If the stu
dents are willing to back this drive
now, we could start on a new pavil
ion just as soon as building con
ditions are stabilized enough to
permit the total cost to be accur
ately determined."
