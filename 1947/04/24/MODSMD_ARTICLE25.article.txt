# Can USC Edge 100 Mark Is Top Query
## 
### JOHN HUBBARD 
When Dean Cromwell's track and field troupe from USC
goes into action against Stanford on Angell Field Saturday no
one in his right mind will bother to wory about who's going to
win the meet. The only question in the minds of the track ad
dicts will be, "Can the Indians hold Trojans below 100 points?"

That USC will win the meet is a
foregone conclusion, hut whether
or not the visitors from Los Angeles
will top the century mark in the
scoring column is a matter of much
debate.
The general consensus of opin
ion among the sporting gentry is
that the Trojans should gather in a
little more or a little less than 110
points.
MIGHT WIN TIIEM ALL
Those who subscribe to this esti
mate point out that USC has a very
good chance of winning first place
in every one of the 15 events on the
afternoon's program.
Such an unfortunate eventuality
is not impossible.
The Trojan's brilliant Mel Pat
ton, is in a class by himself in both
the 100 and 220. The 23-year-old
sophomore might well equal, or even
break, the 9.4 seconds world record
in the century. He has done 9.5,
and USC's Daily "Trojan" reports,
"He was robbed out of a 9.4 at
Riverside." His best time for the
season in the 220 is a whirlwind
20.4.
SINK C AN WIN TWO
Another almost certain winner
for USC is distance runner Roland
Sink. He should have little trouble
in the mile, if he can come any
where near his peak of the year,
4:18.4. Should Cromwell see lit to
use him in the two-mile, Sink
would be the logical first-place can
didate there, too. He has been
clocked at 9:50.4â€”f0ur seconds faster
than Stanford's top man, Frank
Ganahl.
The Trojans can field two under
-48 seconds quartermilers. Wells De
Loach and Ilubie Kerns, which
should guarantee them blue-ribbon
honors in that event.
They have a good chance to sweep
the high jump with Jim Follis, 6 ft.
0 in., Dick Newman, 0 ft. 4 in., and
Hill Wakefield, 6 ft. 3 in.
SAME STORY
It's the same story the rest of the
way down the line:
Bob Chambers is given the dope
sters' nod in the 880, with a top
performance of 1:54.5.
Dick Attlesey rates top billing in
the high hurdles with 14.5, although
Stanford's Captain A 1 Snyder can
not be counted out of contention.
Ron Frazier will rank as favorite
in the low hurdles, with 23.8. Here
again, Snyder might come through
for the Indians.
Bill Bayless is head and shoulders
above the other shotputters on the
two teams. He has heaved the 16-
pound ball out 50 ft. 1 in.
LIKELY DOUBLE WINNER
Doug Miller is the logical choice
in the discus with 140 ft. 3; j in.,
and rates first among the javelin
throwers at 191 ft. 3'j in.
Edsel Curry, a 23 ft. 5 in. broad
jumper, is figured to win that event,
with Bob Hart the favorite in the
pole vault at 13 ft. G in.
Looks kind of hopeless for Stan
ford, doesn't it? But the Indians
are grimly at work this week, hoping
and planning to find at least one
exploitable crack in the Trojan's
seemingly invincible armor.
They lost to USC 108-23 last year,
and that kind of defeat does not
sit well with Messrs. Weiershauser
and Warmerdam, two gentlemen not
at all accustomed to losing.
