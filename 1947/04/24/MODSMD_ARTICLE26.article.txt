# Horsehiders Swing Back Into Action
## 
### 
With their C.1.8.A. diamond pros
pects shot from 'under them by
Tuesday's disastrous 11 to 3 defeat
by Si. Mary's, the Farm's ball play
ers are digging in today to prepare
for undefeated Southern Califor
nia's invasion of the Sunken Dia
mond Saturday afternoon.
JV's GO TODAY
Their junior varsity counterparts
beat the Cardinals back into action
when they take on Santa Clara's
Jayvees on the Sunken Diamond
this afternoon. Manager Ed Shea
ban says that Don Gabrielson will
probably get the starting assign
ment.
Since they're now out of the front
running picture, the Indians can at
least salvage the remainder of the
loop season by taking over a new
role as the conference giant kill
ersâ€”and they couldn't choose a
better time to start pulling a few
upsets than Saturday afternoon.
For the high-riding Trojans, who
boast a 5-0 C.1.8.A. mark, racked
up two of those wins at the expense
of the Indians a month ago in the
Southland, and are currently bat
tling California for the 1947 pen
nant. An upset by the Indians Sat
urday would partially heal some of
the Indians' earlier-season wounds,
and at the same time help to put a
crimp into the Trojan campaign.
GAELS TOUGH
The Indians are still shaking their
heads about that St. Mary's game,
for they couldn't hit Jack Rial and
they couldn't handle the Gael bunt
ing, the two main factors for their
eight-run rout.
But their coach, Harry Wolter, dis
missing Tuesday's loss as "one of
those things," is looking ahead to
the Trojan game and he means it
when he says,"I thick we've got
just as good a chance of winning
Saturday's game as they do."
"Why, look, we scored 12 runs
down there against S.C. in two
games, and we didn't win. And
since then, we've improved a lot
and I don't see how they could have
improved much since the time we
saw them."
Well, he's right when he says that
the Indians are better now; up until
Tuesday's game the Indians were
riding along on the crest of a five
game winning streak, and had been
just barely nosed out by California,
2 to 1, in their only loss of the spring
quarter.
Now, the question is, can the
Cardinals bounce back and upset
the Trojans on the rebound?
That's a question that will have to
wait until Saturday afternoon to be
finally answered. In the meanwhile,
lots of Farm ball fans are having
quite a time kicking that question
around.
