# Tab Ganahl to Help Stymie Splurge of Trojan Points
## 
### TOM BURDICK 
When the proverbial "smoke clears from the Angell Field
battlement Saturday afternoon, Stanford may be on the receiv
ing end of one of its worst defeats in recent track history. Indian
coach, Jack Weiershauser, has gone on record as saying a 40
point Stanford total against the Southern California juggernaut
—_ would be no less than a moral vie-

Tory!
INDIAN DEPENDABLES
If this 40 odd figures is to be ac
complished, it will rest principally
on the performances of the Indian
"dependables," such as Frankie
Ganahl. The top-notch distance man
is equally at home in the mile as well
as the two-mile, and can double lip
in both events if necessary.
Ganahl knocked off a 4:25.G mile
in his first year at Stanford, and
lias since lowered that time to 4:23.2
this season. His best mark in the
longer grind recorded this year is
9:54. Frankie will have to run
comparative times or better this
Saturday ii he is to break into the
heavy scoring ranks against the tire
less Trojan runners, led by Roland
Sink.
CORONA PREP SCHOOL
Ganahl matriculated to Stanford
last year from Corona High via a
short stop-off at Chaffee Jr. Col
lege. The 21-year-old, 5 ft. 10 in.,
155 pound Fiji is majoring in politi
cal science from where he hopes to
go on into law.
