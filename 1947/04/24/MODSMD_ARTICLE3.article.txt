# Candidates Asked Views On New Pavilion Question
## MORE ABOUT Election Poll 
### 
How would you propose raising
funds for a new pavilion?
This was the final question sub
mitted to presidential candi<\ites
Tom MartzlofF, Bill McPherson,
Morley Thompson, and Bob Lev/is
for their opinions.
TOM MARTZLOFF said: "As a re
ult of some investigational inquiries,
it seems to me that the following two
proposals are very practical: (1) Re
quest the S.A.C. and the University
to set aside surpluses each year to
pay for a new pavilion. (2) Use the
additional income resulting from the
increased number of spectators ac
commodated, over and above the
present pavilion's capacity.
"The Associated Students are

ircsen 'y paying o.f the debt on I
Memorial Hall."
BILL McPIIERSON ..aid: "I feel
that tlie only successful method of i
financing a new basketball pavilion I
by "the Associated Students would
be tliroup.h the S.A.C. Within the !
next two years the receipts from alb- |
letics should be suflicient to begin '
a fund for the pavilion. To supple- j
mcnt this, percentages of the re
ceipts from the present pavilion and
other sources could be channelled
toward a building fund; however,
this would not aflord large returns.
"I am opposed to the Associated
Students borrowing the money and
do not feel that a drive for alumni j
candidates' platforms and view
points.
PRIMARY PRAISED
Stanford's first primary last
Thursday drew the approval of 90
per cent of the pollees, the survey
showed. Only criticism of the pri
mary was that candidates did not
receive enough prior publicity.
Because publicity is incomplete,
20 per cent of the students admitted
they had to vote on the basis of "big
names" or for candidates they had
heard "a lot about."
WOMEN VOTE
Largest living areas interested in
the elections are women's Row and
dormitory units, the poll revealed.
While approximately half of the
men show interest in election re
sults, nearly 90 per cent of the co
eds interviewed intend to cast their
votes today.
Indicative of the women's inter
est in election candidates is their
knowledge of who the various nom
inees are. Nearly 70 per cent of the
women said they knew the candi
dates' qualifications. Only 20 per
cent of the men, on the other hand,
believed they were well enough ac
quainted with the candidates to
vote intelligently.
CAMPUS VOTERS
While men's and women's per
centages were about equal on all
other questions on the poll, there
was a great difference between cam
pus living groups and the Village.
Almost 100 per cent of those living
on campus said they had some in
terest in the elections, while slightly
more than half of the Village resi
dents polled were interested. How
ever, at the primary election last
week only 41 per cent of the student
body actually did vote.
About two-thirds of those polled
declared they felt the present elec
tion system was defective and im
provements could be made. The
most frequent criticisms of the sys
tem were:
CRITICISMS
1. Primaries follow too soon after
nominations, leaving little time for
sufficient publicity.
2. Voting booths should be used
so that bystanders could not influ
ence the voting.
3. Electioneering should be al
lowed. (Proposition Two on today's
ballot allows funds for limited elec
tioneering.)
4. Candidates hedge on vital is
sues and do not have definite plat
forms.
However, one Roble girl had no
criticism at all of the present sys
tem and claims she has a fool-proof
guide for voting. "I just vote on
the basis of whether they're Betas
or not," she said.

PRIMARY PRAISED
Stanford's first primary last
Thursday drew the approval of 90
per cent of the pollees, the survey
showed. Only criticism of the pri
mary was that candidates did not
receive enough prior publicity.
Because publicity is incomplete,
20 per cent of the students admitted
they had to vote on the basis of "big
names" or for candidates they had
heard "a lot about."
WOMEN VOTE
Largest living areas interested in
the elections are women's Row and
dormitory units, the poll revealed.
While approximately half of the
men show interest in election re
sults, nearly 90 per cent of the co
eds interviewed intend to cast their
votes today.
Indicative of the women's inter
est in election candidates is their
knowledge of who the various nom
inees are. Nearly 70 per cent of the
women said they knew the candi
dates' qualifications. Only 20 per
cent of the men, on the other hand,
believed they were well enough ac
quainted with the candidates to
vote intelligently.
CAMPUS VOTERS
While men's and women's per
centages were about equal on all
other questions on the poll, there
was a great difference between cam
pus living groups and the Village.
Almost 100 per cent of those living
on campus said they had some in
terest in the elections, while slightly
more than half of the Village resi
dents polled were interested. How
ever, at the primary election last
week only 41 per cent of the student
body actually did vote.
About two-thirds of those polled
declared they felt the present elec
tion system was defective and im
provements could be made. The
most frequent criticisms of the sys
tem were:
CRITICISMS
1. Primaries follow too soon after
nominations, leaving little time for
sufficient publicity.
2. Voting booths should be used
so that bystanders could not influ
ence the voting.
3. Electioneering should be al
lowed. (Proposition Two on today's
ballot allows funds for limited elec
tioneering.)
4. Candidates hedge on vital is
sues and do not have definite plat
forms.
However, one Roble girl had no
criticism at all of the present sys
tem and claims she has a fool-proof
guide for voting. "I just vote on
the basis of whether they're Betas
or not," she said.
How would you propose raising
funds for a new pavilion?
This was the final question sub
mitted to presidential candi<\ites
Tom MartzlofF, Bill McPherson,
Morley Thompson, and Bob Lev/is
for their opinions.
TOM MARTZLOFF said: "As a re
ult of some investigational inquiries,
it seems to me that the following two
proposals are very practical: (1) Re
quest the S.A.C. and the University
to set aside surpluses each year to
pay for a new pavilion. (2) Use the
additional income resulting from the
increased number of spectators ac
commodated, over and above the
present pavilion's capacity.
