# Linksters Host Spartans
## 
### 
Stanford's unbeaten linksters will
! give their nearest competitors, the
S;m Jose State Spartans, a second
chance to do what they couldn't ac
complish the first time, this Satur
day on the home greens. Last Mon
day the Card golfers soundly
trounced the highly regarded Stat
ers by a score of 17 to 10 at the
Hub City's Country Club.
San Jose, boasting some of the
best collegiate golfers in the state,
including Morgan Futtrell, recent
Northern California Intercollegiate

Tourney champ, and Boh Harris,
State Junior titlist, not to mention
Eli Bariteau, definitely marked the
strength of the Indian squad in giv
ing the Indians so little trouble.
Things will be different this time,
vows the Spartan squad.
Coach Eddie Twiggs' talented
sextet of Tom Lambie, Bob Rosburg,
Bob Cardinal, Bob Rosecrance, Jack
ShulÂ«r, and Ernie Kellburg will be
out to prove that last week's victory
was no fluke.
