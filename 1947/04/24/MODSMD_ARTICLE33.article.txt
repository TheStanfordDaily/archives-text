## Stop to Consider Today 
### 
, Today's election marks the end of the hard
est-fought and most interesting campaign
which Stanford has seen in many years.
Before voting today there are a few things
which each person should consider â€”things
which make this election different from its pre
war prototypes.
The size of the campus has increased to
such an extent that it is difficult to know many,
if any, of the candidates as has generally been
the case in the past.
This makes the responsibility of intelligent
voting much more difficult. The voter for the
most part is forced to rely on speeches and
published statements rather than on personal
knowledge of the candidates.
And this presents dangers. Stop to consider,
before you vote, just what you know of a can
didate's proven ability. Don't be misled by
"big names" or confuse ability in unrelated
fields with the executive ability student body
offices require.
The job of student body president possesses
far less glamor than most persons realize. It
requires an experienced organizer and admin
istrator, of proven ability, who is willing to
work hard to make his term of office a success.
It is not a position for those who are willing
to devote only a couple hours a day to the
job.
In strongly contested elections, such as this
one, there is always the danger of some per
sons becoming so overzealous on election day

that their actions give a "shady" touch to the
voting.
Such actions can mar an otherwise fair elec
tion and reflect on the personal integrity of
every student.
Make your decisions today good ones. If
you are one who has expressed dissatisfaction
with campus student government, then this
is your opportunity to put in persons who you
think will produce.
