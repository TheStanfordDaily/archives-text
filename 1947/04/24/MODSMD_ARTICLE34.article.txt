### 
Cardinals' recent plan to enlarge the stu
dent-administration forum is a definite step
in the right direction. Even if the idea ex
pressed by the plan is not acceptable to the
students and the members of the administra
tion, at least the whole forum will get a fair
trial.
Students now have a chance to turn in
their questions and complaints about admin
istration policies with assurance that a basic
student board will present their side of the
question to the officials directly concerned
with the problem. The board will also handle
questions between student organizations.
Cardinals' plan to poll representative groups
as to the type of questions that they would
like to present to the forum is an excellent
one.
The action taken by Cardinals shows that
this organization is one which can take the
lead in helping promote unity on the Stan
ford campus.—D.K.
