### DAN ENDSLEY 
Stanford's election assembly gave many of the
students a chance to see the candidates and make a
selection, but one thing happened which left a sour
taste in the mouths of many people present. I refer
to the unfortunate manner in which the I.S.C. issue
was presented.
Of course Excom has the authority to put the pro
gram through whether or not the campus as a whole
approves, and its action in agreeing to abide by stu
dent opinion as expressed in the coming referendum
is laudable.
However—the assembly was supposed to be non
partisan, and on the I.S.C. question it certainly
wasn't. At a nonpartisan meeting BOTH sides should
be presented. There is a strong feeling against the
projected trips abroad—but the only speakers were
the two men selected as Stanford's represeptatives,
and they certainly are not the most unbiased speak
ers available on the question.
The people against the program have had little or
no voice; the assembly gave them no hearing—and
yesterday's Daily came out editorially in favor of the
plan. The other side deserves a chance to be heard.
One of the most obvious things against the plan
is this—if there is anything Europe can do without
right now, it is touring Americans. Europeans are in
the midst of a most trying period. Money, food, in
dustrial goods, expert advice—these are all badly
needed; needless to say, Stanford's representatives
can't hope to contribute.
Another thing: these two men are going to stay in
Europe six weeks. People who have moved to a new
neighborhood where they speak the same language
will know that it took them much longer than six
weeks to get around the area and find out what was
going on. Stanford's representatives will divide their
time among several countries where there will be a
language barrier. At best, they can hope for nothing
more than a conducted tour; they'll see everything
through eyes other than their own.
Thirdly, one of the men who spoke in favor of

the plan—who seemed, incidentally, more like a frus
trated cheer leader than one capable of leading col
lege students in more serious lines—stated that Stan
ford's representatives would improve their time
abroad by setting up the exchange scholarships ex
pected to result from the Fulbright Blil.
That is obviously ridiculous; if those scholarships
come through, their administration will not be in the
hands of college students. Rightly or wrongly, a
group of older people will make all the decisions.
Any belief to the contrary is based on fallacy.
As I have said, if there is anything Europe can
do without, it is junketing Americans. Europeans are
too busy with their own very real problems to en
joy playing the gracious host right now. Undoubt
edly, though, there is a definite need for international
understanding and co-operation. A good place to
start is in the colleges—with exchange scholarships.
No specified sum of money has been set aside for this
junket, but I understand the plan is to spend about
2,000.
It would be much better to take that money and
set up an A.S.S.U. scholarship for some foreign stu
dent. It would be a small beginning, but at least it
would be a step forward. The projected plan can do
no good, and may do harm. If Stanford wants to
take the lead in improving international understand
ing, the obvious thing to do is to bring a student over
here for a year—so he can get to know us.
Maybe later on we can do more; we should cer
tainly try. It seems the older generation is hopeless,
but there is still a chance that the younger people
who inhabit the nations of the world can salvage
something out of the shambles. It would be criminal
not to try.
We can't do this by wasting our money on a plan
which can accomplish nothing, no matter how pure
the motives of the men who try to execute it. In
stead, let's start at the logical beginning; perhaps the
prepaid vacations' abroad will be possible later—at
a more opportune time.
