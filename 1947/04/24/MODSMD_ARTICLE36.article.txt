To the Editor:
Student government reached a new low at today's
election assembly. I refer not to the actions or state
ments of any candidate for office but rather to those
of the present head of student government.
Every argument has at least two sides, and I
resent having only one of these presented to me at
an assembly designed to introduce candidates for
office in an impartial light. A long, bombastic speech
favoring the 1.5.C., delivered by one of its key men,
was inserted in the program. The fact that the I.S.C.
proposal is to appear on the ballot tomorrow indicates
that it is a controversial issue. That petitions were
submited against it indicates that some Stanford
students do oppose it.
However, in today's assembly no speech opposing
or criticizing i.S.C. was permitted. A man in the au
dience rose to speak, protesting that "This is being
railroaded through!" and asked to be heard. This
man was ignored without'as much as a single glance
by the chairman if the meeting. It could be that he
was not heard, but this is unlikely.
Student government should indeed head for the
roundhouse when controversial issues cease to have
two sides in the eyes of student leaders.
I feel myself that the I.S.C. has some merit, but
no one man or group can lie so omniscient that he
can himself decide that opposition must not be heard.
The I.S.C. proposition must be defeated if for no
other reason than that its opponents have been de
nied the right to express their views.

To the Editor:
Today, we will go to the polls to vote on the I.S.C.
All of the points in favor of this program have been
pointed out carefully to the student body in the
paper, on the radio, and in the all-student assembly.
I note, however, that there is an amazing lack of
presentation of the other side of the question. The
most glaring of these lacks appeared in the assembly
when Martin Anderson refused to give the floor to
a student who wished to show the con side, after the
two chosen students had shown the pro. This selec
tion of information, evident also in last quarter's Ex
coin meetings, has the taste of propaganda.
I would like, then, to present, as best I can, the
other, opposing side of this issue. There obviously
is such a side or the I.S.C. would not be up for a
vote.
The most important point is that it is the wasting
of student body funds on a project whose chances
of producing the desired effects are too small to take
the risk. If the students are sent abroad, there is
no guarantee that they will get any response from
the student body when they return. A recent survey
of the men in Toyon showed that they probably
would have a very small turnout. The suggestion
that the veterans who have already been over in
these countries give talks has been completely ig
nored. We are not voting on whether we should be
internationally minded, but on whether we should
let student body funds be spent on a six weeks'
vacation for two students.
