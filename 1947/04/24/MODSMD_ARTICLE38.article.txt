# Farm Psychologists Consider Problems of injured Veterans
## 
### JERRY STAVIG 
"In partial solution to one of the most poignant of human
postwar problems, how to deal sensibly with injured veterans,
two articles will appear in the April and October issues of the
"Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology," Dr. Tamara
Dembo, Stanford psychologist, said yesterday.
These articles are the result of a prolonged research project

by a group of Stanford psychologists♦
under a contract between the uni
versity and the Office of Scientific
Research and the Army Medical Re
search and Development Board of
the Surgeon General's office. The
research group includes: Eugenia
Haufmann, Helen H. Jennings,
Gloria Ladieu, Milton Rose, Ralph
K. White, and Beatrice A. Wright.
FOUR GUIDE POSTS
According to Dr. Dembo, director
of the project, the investigation war
rants the establishment of four pri
mary guideposts in dealing with
veterans who have visible injuries. !
"Don't help (in the sense of phy
sical help) unless it appears neces
sary. Remember that the inconven
ience which is tolerated by injured
persons often far exceeds % that ordin
arily tolerated by non-injured per
sons. Don't talk about the injury
unless the veteran brings it up him
self. Above all, don't make an issue
of helping an injured person."
From a psychological viewpoint, j
Dr. Dembo continued, the right kind
of help is "help that leads to an j
enlargement of the space of free
movement of the injured man." |
Help of the wrong kind can be worse
than useless. "Some people knock ;
you down opening doors for you," j
one veteran contended.
LEARN FOR THEMSELVES
The psychologist explained that
the injured want to learn to do
things for themselves, and further, !
that they feel unwanted help re- .
tards that learning. "Help is bad !
unless the man is terribly handi- j
capped. Even then be careful un- ;
less he wants it," one veteran af- !
firmed.
Idle curiosity and staring are fur
ther taboos, Dr. Dembo asserted.
She quoted a veteran as comment
ing, "The audacity of staring puts j
you in the same class as some freak j
in a sideshow,"
According to the research staff, i
the attitude of the injured towards j
sympathy and pity will be discus
sed in a forthcoming study.

"In partial solution to one of the most poignant of human
postwar problems, how to deal sensibly with injured veterans,
two articles will appear in the April and October issues of the
"Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology," Dr. Tamara
Dembo, Stanford psychologist, said yesterday.
These articles are the result of a prolonged research project

by a group of Stanford psychologists♦
under a contract between the uni
versity and the Office of Scientific
Research and the Army Medical Re
search and Development Board of
the Surgeon General's office. The
research group includes: Eugenia
Haufmann, Helen H. Jennings,
Gloria Ladieu, Milton Rose, Ralph
K. White, and Beatrice A. Wright.
FOUR GUIDE POSTS
According to Dr. Dembo, director
of the project, the investigation war
rants the establishment of four pri
mary guideposts in dealing with
veterans who have visible injuries. !
"Don't help (in the sense of phy
sical help) unless it appears neces
sary. Remember that the inconven
ience which is tolerated by injured
persons often far exceeds % that ordin
arily tolerated by non-injured per
sons. Don't talk about the injury
unless the veteran brings it up him
self. Above all, don't make an issue
of helping an injured person."
From a psychological viewpoint, j
Dr. Dembo continued, the right kind
of help is "help that leads to an j
enlargement of the space of free
movement of the injured man." |
Help of the wrong kind can be worse
than useless. "Some people knock ;
you down opening doors for you," j
one veteran contended.
LEARN FOR THEMSELVES
The psychologist explained that
the injured want to learn to do
things for themselves, and further, !
that they feel unwanted help re- .
tards that learning. "Help is bad !
unless the man is terribly handi- j
capped. Even then be careful un- ;
less he wants it," one veteran af- !
firmed.
Idle curiosity and staring are fur
ther taboos, Dr. Dembo asserted.
