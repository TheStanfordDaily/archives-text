### LORRY LOKEY JOHN TURNBLAD 
Nearly three-fifths of llio Stan-
I ford student body arc not familiar
| with the candidates they will vote
for today, according to the results
i of a Daily poll conducted yester
day throughout Stanford living
j "roups. A representative cross sec
lion of the Stanford electorate was
obtained from men's and women's
dormitories, Row houses, and the
; Village, where students answered
j the 10-question poll circulated by
; the Daily.
j MOItE PUBLICITY NEEDED
About 65 per cent of students
' polled stated they believed that can
! didates should get more publicity.

I They said candidates for the lesser |
I known offices especially need pub
| licity, and more personal in forma
} tion should be published about each
j candidate. One-third of the stu
dents admitted did not even
I know the names of the four presi
dential nominees in today's elec
tion.
Two-thirds of those reached by j
the poll stated they favored election {
speeches over KSU and would listen j
to them if they were presented.
While over half of those inter- i
viewed said election publicity in the j
Daily is generally complete, other
students criticized the paper for be
ing too general in its presentation of
uation, "Stanford has always had a
terrific tendency to retire," she ad
mitted. "To prevent this retirement,
I think Excom should foster any
good group that will work toward
making Stanford an internationally
minded community."
Guyla Runyan of Union Unit said,
"The primary system should be con
tinued if a plan can be devised to
let people know more about the can
didates beforehand. The students
should get to know the candidates
as individuals rather than as just
names."
CONTACT SOCIAL COMMITTEE
Her social program uses the social
committee as a contact committee,
made up of the social chairmen of
the various houses who would find
out what the students in each house
wanted and present those ideas at
the meetings.
"The primary system will be very
beneficial," said Barbara Lang of
Union Unit, "but it could have been
run better this time. More checks
and balances are needed." Miss
Lang, who is at present secretary of
the International Club, feels that
Stanford needs a strong and well
co - ordinated international set -up
with closer bonds between it and
Excom. "I would like to see Stan
ford take the lead in international
affairs," she admitted.

j MOItE PUBLICITY NEEDED
About 65 per cent of students
' polled stated they believed that can
! didates should get more publicity.

I They said candidates for the lesser |
I known offices especially need pub

} tion should be published about each

I know the names of the four presi

speeches over KSU and would listen j

beneficial," said Barbara Lang of

Stanford needs a strong and well
co - ordinated international set -up
with closer bonds between it and
Excom. "I would like to see Stan
