I In an attempt to give the students
a better insight on the candidates
running for the office of vice-presi
dent, the Daily has interviewed tlio
four candidates, Dorothy Lamar,
Babs Wilbur, Guyla Runyan, and
Barbara Lang, to find out what they
think of current controversial is
sues. Views on three Issues of in
j tercst arc presented.
Dorothy Lamar, of Man/.anita
j Lodge, asserting her views on the
I new election system, said, "If we arc
I going to have primaries, there
j should be some way to have the
i campus know who is running." In
regard to the international situation,
she thinks that it is a good idea to
have the students vote on the I.S.C.
plan, since it is such a controversial

| issue. "Il is important to havr llto
| students back such a plan as this,"
| she adfled.
Miss Lamar's social program in
j chides co-ordination of social ac
tivities with area representation and
equal distribution of social function.,
with more thorough and advanced
j planning.
Bahs Wilbur of Casa Eucalypto
i thinks that the primary system
j helps to eliminate candidates so that,
j a smaller number of people are run
] ning and the students have a better
| chance of knowing about the candi
dates. "All in all. I think it is the
j only sensible system to use," she
j declared.
