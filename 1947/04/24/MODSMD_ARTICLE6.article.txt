# Four Campus Leaders Take Stand As I.S.C. and Election Fund Issues Await Today's Referendum Results
## Pros and Cons of Electioneering And I.S.C. Fold by Student Leaders 
### 
Two of the Farm's most contro
versial issues of the past two quar
ters. I.S.C. and electioneering funds,
have swung into the current politi
cal arena as a result of last week's
petitions to Election Board. These
topics will be subject to a student
referendum at today's general elec
tion.
Cognizant of the widespread in
terest but general misunderstand
ing of both questions, the Daily has
asked four prominent campus lead
ers, each of whom has studied and
actively supported one side of the
issues, to express his attitude as an
aid in forming student opinion.
Election Funds
Martin Anderson, A.S.S.U. presi
dent, Beta Thcta Pi: "'Talks to liv
ing groups, Daily interviews, KSU
appearances, and election assem
blies all aid intelligent voting. How
ever, the proposed amendment to
the constitution to allow candidates
to spend money and flood the cam
pus with leaflets of the VOTE-FOR
JOHN-DOE variety will be no help
to that intelligent voting. The pro
posal is a hangover of high school
elections—long ago recognized by
Stanford as contributing nothing to
voters' knowledge."
Gordon Ness. Election Board
chairman, Village: "In the past two
elections, the publicity committee of
Election Board has publicized can
didates through living group
speeches, over KSU, at the election
assembly, by means of mock ballots,
Daily articles, and every other
means that are legal under the ex
isting constitution.
"Still many complaints are heard
that candidates' qualifications and
the candidates themselves are not
well enough known, I feel that the
only way the students can get to
know what each candidate stands

for is to let that candidate tell the
students his qualifications and plat
form by means of posters, paid
Daily ads (with picture, for in
stance), and other methods that re
quire a small amount of money—
which would probably come from
the candidate's supporters."
I.S.C. Program
Lorcn Smith, Men's Council, Tov
on: "From the very start of the
I.S.C. program, we opposing it
sought only to let the plan stand or
fall on its own merits. But we soon
realized the program was to be hid
den beneath -a cloud of Senator
Clnghornish cries of 'International
ism will perish.' We then asked
on'y that the students be given a
chance to vote for or against the
I.S.C. plan to send students over
seas to conduct 'survey tours.'
REQUIRED PETITIONS
"We were told by the head of Ex
com that 'Excom votes as they damn
please.' It was only through initiat
ing a petition that we were able to
force the issue before the student
body. Then in a further effort to
cloud the issue we were told prior
to yesterday's assembly that we
would not be allowed to speak
against the I.S.C. in answer to those
speaking for it.
"We point out these facts, not to
cry for sympathy, but merely to
point out how, at every turn, those
advocating I.S.C. attempted to cloud
the issue and hide the complete
facts from the voters.
ARGUMENT CHANGED
"The original plan was to conduct
a six weeks' survey to note 'condi
tions.' When student opinion rose
against this plan, as ridiculous, the
I.S.C. insisted upon sticking to it
until this past, week, when they
fmally realized its futility. They
then turned to the argument, that
the men touring Europe could set
up plans for exchange scholarships.
"But a penny postcard to the State
Department will get you volumes of
information on every detail of hous
ing, studies, etc., including the
names of over 30 organizations—as
the million-dollar Rockefeller Fel
lowship Program—that have been
set up for years to do nothing but
aid exchange students in every way.
EXPENDITURE WASTE
"The spending of several thousand
dollars to duplicate work already
rlone, to get information already at
our disposal, is a waste. Consider
what material aid worth several
thousand dollars can do.
"By voting against the 1.5.C.. stu
dents are not voting against in
ternational co-operation, exchange
scholarships, material aid. or any
other definite aid that can be done.
They will be voting to end the folly
of making a survey tour to get in
formation we now have.
"Vote against the I.S.C. and let
us at once use our money and ener
gy to take advantage of the volu
minous information already at hand

to start exchange scholarships and
to send material aid.
"Vote NO on Number One."
Chuck Martin, president of the
Stanford Institute of International
Relations, Village: "There are five
specific objects which the I.S.C. trip
can accomplish:
PERSONAL CONTACTS
"1. It can establish personal eon
tacts abroad for the 1,000 Stanford
students who are expected to study,
travel, and work abroad annually as
provided by the State Department
programs such as the Fulbright bill.
"2. It can investigate a specific
relief project to be engineered by
the Stanford student body- such as
adopting a foreign university.
It can represent Stanford at
the World Youth Festival at Prague
n which (50 nations will participate.
"4. It can lay the foundation for a
'student-for-student' exchange pro
gram in those countries where the
Fulbright Bill docs not apply.
"5. It can bring back specific in
formation required by other com
mittees of the Stanford Institute of
International Relations on education,
travel, jobs, relief, etc.
GOOD WILL ABROAD
"6. If this program is not adopted
it will be a blow to Amcriaan good
will abroad. The idea has already
been favorably received abroad and
is supported by our State Depart
ment. If the I.S.C. is defeated, in
Europe's eyes it will mean that iso
lationism still exists in the U.S.—
whether or not this is a correct in
terpretation. On the other hand, if
it passes it is concrete evidence to
the Europeans that American col
lege students are interested in other
peoples. It is an example of Stan
ford leadership in world student
thinking and action. Let give this
progresisve leadership our full sup
port."
