# Toyon Ends Relief Drive
## 
### 
Toyon Hall's European relief drive
will end its activities this week-end
and the final packages will be wrap
ped Monday night, committee mem
ber Ralph Miller announced yester
day.
So far, in three weeks of activity,
the relief committee has collected
approximately 360 pounds of cloth
ing. This is enough to make up 36
packages, 21 of which have already
been mailed to destitute persons in
Europe.
' We still need money for postage,"
said Miller. "Each package requires
about $1.50 for stamps. Contribu
tions can be placed in the small
boxes in both the Toyon and Bran
iter lounges."
The Toyon relief drive is being
consolidated with a campus-wide
relief agency, according to Milier.
Between the time the new agency
begins operations and the closing of
the Toyon drive, Toyon men may
leave their donations with Branner
drive members, he said.
Anyone interested in helping wrap
packages Monday may come into the
Toyon resident director's suite be
tween 7 and 8 p.m., Miller said.
Branner women have been helping
both in collecting arid wrapping the
clothes during the last two weeks.
