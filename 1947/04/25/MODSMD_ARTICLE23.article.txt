# Engineer's Touch Is Necessary to Oversee Corp Yard, Superintendent Blacker Declares
## 
### WELLS KEDDIE 
"It takes an engineer to handle the job."
This terse description of the problems of ovsrseeing the Stanford Corporation Yard activi
-3 came from husky, vigorous Carroll L. Blacker, superintendent.
Kis actions during the day prove his point.
From the moment he enters his professor-like office—with its bookshelves and charts

lining the walls—in the morning at 8
until he locks the door in the even
ing any time after G, the Superin
tendent of Buildings and Grounds is
a busy man. His flat-topped desk
is covered—but not littered—with
the detailed paper work of his pro
fession, and the phone rings con
stantly.
Despite the press of office prob
lems, however, Blacker finds time
to contact personally the men in each
of the many departments which
handle the complex job of maintain
ing and repairing the Farm's build
ings and grounds. Even just a cas
ual "hello" serves to keep coopera
tion between the Superintendent and
the men who do the "heavy" work
at a high level, he claims.
FULL TIME JOB
Merely contacting the 13 depart
ments is a full time job. Blacker's
charts reveal that 98 men, includ
ing 2 engineer assistants, are needed !
to keep the Corp Yard at minimum j
strength.
Blacker also revealed that most '
of the "casual help," part time work
ers, are recruited from the ranks of
Farm students. Vacation time finds
a fairly large number of campus
roughs on the payroll, he said.
Blacker is also in charge of the
maintenance department at Stan- !
foVd Village,' arid spends part of his
already-overcrowded time there each
day. In June, 1946, he came to Stan
lord fcet up the department at the
Village, and later that same year, in
October, he took over as Superin- |
tendent.
WORKERS
Carpenters, plumbers, painters,
electricians, steam plant workers,
masons, garage mechanics, mechani
cians (metal work technicians), la
borers, truck driver, gardeners and
nurserymen—each has his own prob
lems which arise from the nature of
his work. Blacker's "personalized"
treatment of these problems keeps
the Corp Yard on a smooth-running
basis.
The name "Corporation Yard" has
nothing to do with corporations, he
interjected. "It's just a name which
has grown up through usage, desig- I
nating what is actually a "mainten- I
ance and repair yard'," he ex
plained.
BLACKER HOMECOMING
Blacker's arrival at Stanford was
'mcrr£ or less a homecoming. He
was graduated with the Farm class
of 25 with a civil engineering de
gree. Palo Alto was his stopping
place for the next 19 years while
he served as a City Engineer. In
World War 11, he helped to construct
the Naval hospital at Corona as a
commander in the Navy's Civil En
gineer Corps.
He terms himself a "municipal en
gineer, " although admitting that, ac
cording to college degrees, the term
is non-existant. "But that's my job,"
he shrugged.
