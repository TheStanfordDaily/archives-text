# TRACKMEN BATTLE FAVORED S.C.
## 
### JOHN HUBBARD 
The drama of "David and Goliath"—l 947 track and field ver
sion—will be presented before an expected overflow crowd at
Angell Field tomorrow afternoon. But there have been a couple
of slight changes made in the script. David, played by Stan
ford's Indian, will be minus his legendary slingshot, and Goliath,
enacted by USC's Trojan, will be |

bigger, stronger, and meaner than
ever.
As a result, unless things go ab
solutely haywire, Goliath stands a
better than excellent chance of re
versing a previous decision he lost
to David way back in the B.C.'s.
Dean Cromwell's USC team is a
real powerhouse this year, and most
experts figure Stanford will be very
lucky to hold the visitors under
100 points.
TROJANS NEED 109
There are even those who predict
the Trojans will hand Stanford its
worst defeat in the 41-meet history
of competition between the two
schools. To accomplish this feat,
USC would have to ring up more
than 108 points of the 131-point total.
Last season USC amassed the - big
gest winning score to date, annihil
ating the Indians, 108-23.
Meet records are apt to fall with
gay abandon in the course of the
afternoon's activities.
Mel Patton, Trojan sophomore,
will go for the 100 and 220 sprint
records, and on Angell Field's ex-
I ceedingly fast track it is not outside
! the realm of possibility that he will
| break them both.
PATTON FLIES
Patton has done 9.5 down south in
the 100 yd. dash and 20.4 in the 220.
Charles Paddock, running for USC
in 1921, set the century record of
9.6 seconds. It was tied once, by
the Trojan's Hector Dyer, in 1930.
The 220 record was posted y USC's
| Foy Diaper in 1934 at 20.9.
Each team has a man who can con
! ceivably smash the half-mile mark
I of 1:53.5, set by USC's Ross Bush
Jin 1935. Stanford's ace, George
Grimes, could push Bob Chambers,
of the Trojans, to a record-upset
ting performance, or vice-versa.
Chambers is, on paper, slightly
I more rapid than Grimes—he has !
done 1:54.5 this year against Grimes'
1:54.7. But Indian Coach Jack
| Weiershauser feels confident Grimes
i can turn the trick, if he is trained
j to razor-edge sharpness and track
i conditions are right.
SINK AFTER MILE MARK
Little Roland Sink, Cromwell's
| top distance runner, broke the two-
I mile mark last year, and will be gun
j ning for the one-mile record tomor
row. He has come within four and
a half seconds of the required time.
Stanford's Paul Moore now holds
the title at 4:11.5, a mark he estab
, lished in 1940.
Aside from possible record-break
ing the meet should provide some
excellent competitive races.
Grimes vs. Chambers is a natural
in the 880, and Stanford Captain A 1
Snyder against Ron Frazier in the
low hurdles and against Dick At
tlesey in the highs promise to be
"down-to-the-wire" thrillers.
Snyder, a 14.5 high hurdle man,
will be perfectly matched with At
tlesey, who also has done 14.5. The
Indian captain must be rated a slight
underdog in the lows. His best is
23.9, while Frazier has been clocked
at 23.8.

The USC-Stanford meets began in
1908. Since that time Stanford has
won 26 meets and the Trojans 15.
But there's a joker—USC has won
every one of the 11 meets since 1933.
However, the Indians were top dog
in the early days of the competition,
with an unbeaten record against
USC from 1908 to 1925—a 22-meet
string.
Stanford students with their ASSU
cards will be charged 50 cents ad
mission at the meet, with outsiders
assessed $1.20. The first field event
is scheduled for 1:45 p.m. The mile,
opening track feature, gets under
way at 2.
Probable Indian entries:
100—Maxwell. Vierthaler, Fess.
220—Maxwell. Smith. Vierthaler.
440—Ho(T, F. Johnson, Wilkins.
880—Grimes, Holubar, Off.
Mile—Ganahl, Wagner, Mueller.
Two-mile—Ganahl, G. Johnson,
Lyons.
High hurdles—Snyder, Russell,
Kent.
Low hurdles—Snyder, Fank,
11 off.
Javelin—Held. Coker, Goldsbor
ough.
Shot put — Chandler, McKee,
Nourse.
High jump — Bryan, Ghilotti,
Hjelte.
Broad jump—Bryan, Fank, J.
Campbell.
Discus—McKee, Coker, Ghilotti.
Pole vault—Larson, D. Camp
bell. Held.

"down-to-the-wire" thrillers.
Snyder, a 14.5 high hurdle man,
will be perfectly matched with At
tlesey, who also has done 14.5. The
Indian captain must be rated a slight
underdog in the lows. His best is
23.9, while Frazier has been clocked
at 23.8.

The USC-Stanford meets began in
1908. Since that time Stanford has
won 26 meets and the Trojans 15.
But there's a joker—USC has won
every one of the 11 meets since 1933.
However, the Indians were top dog
in the early days of the competition,
with an unbeaten record against
USC from 1908 to 1925—a 22-meet
string.
Stanford students with their ASSU
cards will be charged 50 cents ad
mission at the meet, with outsiders
assessed $1.20. The first field event
is scheduled for 1:45 p.m. The mile,

The drama of "David and Goliath"—l 947 track and field ver
sion—will be presented before an expected overflow crowd at
Angell Field tomorrow afternoon. But there have been a couple
of slight changes made in the script. David, played by Stan
ford's Indian, will be minus his legendary slingshot, and Goliath,
enacted by USC's Trojan, will be |

bigger, stronger, and meaner than
ever.
As a result, unless things go ab
solutely haywire, Goliath stands a
better than excellent chance of re
versing a previous decision he lost
to David way back in the B.C.'s.
Dean Cromwell's USC team is a
real powerhouse this year, and most
experts figure Stanford will be very
lucky to hold the visitors under
100 points.
TROJANS NEED 109
There are even those who predict
the Trojans will hand Stanford its
worst defeat in the 41-meet history
of competition between the two
schools. To accomplish this feat,
USC would have to ring up more
than 108 points of the 131-point total.
Last season USC amassed the - big
gest winning score to date, annihil
ating the Indians, 108-23.
Meet records are apt to fall with
gay abandon in the course of the
afternoon's activities.
Mel Patton, Trojan sophomore,
will go for the 100 and 220 sprint
records, and on Angell Field's ex-
I ceedingly fast track it is not outside
! the realm of possibility that he will
| break them both.
PATTON FLIES
Patton has done 9.5 down south in
the 100 yd. dash and 20.4 in the 220.
Charles Paddock, running for USC
in 1921, set the century record of
9.6 seconds. It was tied once, by
the Trojan's Hector Dyer, in 1930.
The 220 record was posted y USC's
| Foy Diaper in 1934 at 20.9.
Each team has a man who can con
! ceivably smash the half-mile mark
I of 1:53.5, set by USC's Ross Bush
Jin 1935. Stanford's ace, George
Grimes, could push Bob Chambers,
of the Trojans, to a record-upset
ting performance, or vice-versa.
Chambers is, on paper, slightly
I more rapid than Grimes—he has !
done 1:54.5 this year against Grimes'
1:54.7. But Indian Coach Jack
| Weiershauser feels confident Grimes
i can turn the trick, if he is trained
j to razor-edge sharpness and track
i conditions are right.
SINK AFTER MILE MARK
Little Roland Sink, Cromwell's
| top distance runner, broke the two-
I mile mark last year, and will be gun
j ning for the one-mile record tomor
row. He has come within four and
a half seconds of the required time.
Stanford's Paul Moore now holds
the title at 4:11.5, a mark he estab
, lished in 1940.
Aside from possible record-break
ing the meet should provide some
excellent competitive races.

gay abandon in the course of the
afternoon's activities.
Mel Patton, Trojan sophomore,
will go for the 100 and 220 sprint
records, and on Angell Field's ex-
I ceedingly fast track it is not outside
! the realm of possibility that he will
| break them both.
PATTON FLIES
Patton has done 9.5 down south in
the 100 yd. dash and 20.4 in the 220.
Charles Paddock, running for USC
in 1921, set the century record of
9.6 seconds. It was tied once, by
the Trojan's Hector Dyer, in 1930.
The 220 record was posted y USC's
| Foy Diaper in 1934 at 20.9.
Each team has a man who can con
! ceivably smash the half-mile mark
I of 1:53.5, set by USC's Ross Bush
Jin 1935. Stanford's ace, George
Grimes, could push Bob Chambers,
of the Trojans, to a record-upset
ting performance, or vice-versa.
Chambers is, on paper, slightly
I more rapid than Grimes—he has !
done 1:54.5 this year against Grimes'
1:54.7. But Indian Coach Jack
| Weiershauser feels confident Grimes
i can turn the trick, if he is trained
j to razor-edge sharpness and track
i conditions are right.
SINK AFTER MILE MARK
Little Roland Sink, Cromwell's
| top distance runner, broke the two-
I mile mark last year, and will be gun
j ning for the one-mile record tomor
row. He has come within four and
a half seconds of the required time.
Stanford's Paul Moore now holds
the title at 4:11.5, a mark he estab
, lished in 1940.
Aside from possible record-break
ing the meet should provide some
excellent competitive races.
Grimes vs. Chambers is a natural
in the 880, and Stanford Captain A 1
Snyder against Ron Frazier in the
low hurdles and against Dick At
tlesey in the highs promise to be
"down-to-the-wire" thrillers.
Snyder, a 14.5 high hurdle man,
will be perfectly matched with At
tlesey, who also has done 14.5. The
Indian captain must be rated a slight
underdog in the lows. His best is
23.9, while Frazier has been clocked
at 23.8.

The USC-Stanford meets began in
1908. Since that time Stanford has
won 26 meets and the Trojans 15.
But there's a joker—USC has won
every one of the 11 meets since 1933.
However, the Indians were top dog
in the early days of the competition,
with an unbeaten record against
USC from 1908 to 1925—a 22-meet
string.
Stanford students with their ASSU
cards will be charged 50 cents ad
mission at the meet, with outsiders
assessed $1.20. The first field event
is scheduled for 1:45 p.m. The mile,
opening track feature, gets under
way at 2.
Probable Indian entries:
100—Maxwell. Vierthaler, Fess.
220—Maxwell. Smith. Vierthaler.
440—Ho(T, F. Johnson, Wilkins.
880—Grimes, Holubar, Off.
Mile—Ganahl, Wagner, Mueller.

The drama of "David and Goliath"—l 947 track and field ver
sion—will be presented before an expected overflow crowd at
Angell Field tomorrow afternoon. But there have been a couple
of slight changes made in the script. David, played by Stan
ford's Indian, will be minus his legendary slingshot, and Goliath,
enacted by USC's Trojan, will be |

bigger, stronger, and meaner than
ever.
As a result, unless things go ab
solutely haywire, Goliath stands a
better than excellent chance of re
versing a previous decision he lost
to David way back in the B.C.'s.
Dean Cromwell's USC team is a
real powerhouse this year, and most
experts figure Stanford will be very
lucky to hold the visitors under
100 points.
TROJANS NEED 109
There are even those who predict
the Trojans will hand Stanford its
worst defeat in the 41-meet history
of competition between the two
schools. To accomplish this feat,
USC would have to ring up more
than 108 points of the 131-point total.
