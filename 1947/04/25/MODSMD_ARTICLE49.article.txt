# Champ Card Golfers Face San Jose State
## 
### 
Stanford's defending national
champion golf team will attempt to
continue its victory streak tomor
j row on the local links, when it
meets a visiting San Jose Spartan
sextet in a return match.
Last Friday the Indian golfers de
feated the highly regarded Hub City
team, 17 to 10, at the San Jose
Country Club. Tomorrow the same
j two teams meet on the local greens,
! with the neighbors intent on hand
| ing the Card golfers their first de
| feat of the current campaign.
The Spartans' ranks include some
of California's best collegiate golf
ers. Morgan Futtrell, Northern Cal
i ifornia Intercollegiate title holder,
and Bob Harris, State Junior Cham
pion, along with the very talented
Eli Bariteau, lead the parade of
; Spartan linksters.

The apparent strength of the San
Jose sextet, when coupled with the
ease with which the home entry
won last Monday, definitely marks
Eddie Twiggs' men as the team to
beat this year. The Cardinals open
competition against Coast Confer
ence foes next week at Berkeley
against California. Then, for three
consecutive Saturdays beginning
May 10, the Farm golfers play host
to U.C.L.A., U.S.C., and the Bears.
Slated to play for Stanford to
morrow are: Tom Lambie, Bob Ros
burg, Bob Cardinal, Bob Rose
crance, Jack Shuler, and Ernie
Kellburg. This sextet is confident
that iUwill be able to beat back the
Spartan bid and establish its su
premacy beyond any doubt.
Tee-off is slated for 9:15 on the
Stanfprd course.
