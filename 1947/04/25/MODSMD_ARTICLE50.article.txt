# Mermen Aim For Cal Meet
## 
### 
Even though Coach Tom Haynie
has a sign on the bulletin board in
the swimming shack at the pool to
remind members of the Varsity the
Conference Championships are only
36 days away, no one is really look
ing any farther ahead than next
Saturday's meet with the University
of California.
Not a person in the know is too
full of assurance that the meet will
be a push-over lor the Indians. In
fact, Haynie has a pessimistic way
the meet may turn out —filled with
lots of ifs and buts—in which the
Bears could snap Stanford's win
streak at 20.
The Farm swimmers have been
taking it competitively easy since
last Saturday's rout of the Olympic
Club. Coach Hal Weatherbe's Bears
on the other hand, have a meet to
night with the Olympic Club, and
one tomorrow with the College of
the Pacific. I
One of the highlights of the Big- I
meet will be the renewal of the |
rivalry between Bob Anderson and
Stan Morketter of Cal. In the na- |
tional championships in Seattle, !
Morketter got the judges' nod over
Anderson in the finish of the fifty j
free. Morketter was placed fourth !
while Anderson finished fifth.
The meet will also bring together
two of the better distance-men on j
the Coast in Fred Taioli and Don I
Beanston of the Bears. These two
will most likely collide in both the |
220 yard freestyle and the quarter- j
mile.
The Indians will be hampered by !
the loss of Tug Neville, who is in
eligible. Neville, second ranking
sprinter on the squad, was counted
on for points in the sprints and help
in the relay.
