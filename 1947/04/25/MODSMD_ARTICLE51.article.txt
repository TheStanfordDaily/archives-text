# Village 214 In Mural Win
## 
### 
The Breakers couldn't quite reach
the fast ones of pitcher Fred Smith,
Phi Kappa Sigma, yesterday, and
handicapped by a shortage of ball
players dropped the intramural soft
ball gaupe by a lopsided 11-0 score.
Smith was still hot after his one
hitter of the day before and proved
too hard to handle in this contest.
A.K.L. was also blanked, D.U. ad
ministering them a 29-0 drubbing.
Hitting when and where they
pleased, D.U. won going away,
pitcher Bob Barsocchini allowing
only three hits.
By a lone run margin, Encina
S.W. got the nod over Zeta Psi, 8-7,
John van Benthem hurling for the
winners. On Field 2, the second
inning eight-run explosion of Phi
Kappa Sigma batting toppled the
Shysters 12-6, drspite pitcher Clyde
Tritt's homer. Winning mound du
ties were carried out by Jim Bar
ringer.
Meanwhile, the Big Red Machine
of the Village league, behind How
ard Prcece's twirling and the hit
ting of Jack Reed, dumped House
110 with a 7-4 count. In the other
Village game, Clint Jones, House
214, chalked up his second win of
the season, giving up seven hits to
the combined team of 212 - 31G.
Sparked by the two circuit clouts
of Bob Williams, 214 snagged a tie
for first place in team standings by
winning this one, G-3.
