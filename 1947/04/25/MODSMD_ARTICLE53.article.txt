# Stanford Nine Will Tackle league â€“ Leading Trojans
## 
### LYNN CARMAN 
Sluggers. That's the synonym for Southern California's league-leading ball club.
And that's what Trojan Coach Sam Barry is bringing with him to the Farm tomorrow after
noon to battle the Indians on the Sunken Diamond tat 3:15.
IF the Indians con solve the offerings of the Trojan mounds corps and IF the Farm's
hurler can squelch the visiting bats, then the Indians just might have a chance to take the game.

It can happen, and it might, but if
the Trojans do bite the dust tomor
row, then it will have to rank as
one of the big top upsets in the cur
rent Coast Intercollegiate Baseball
Association season.
Here's an inkling of the potency
of the hitting attack the Trojans
have come up with this spring; four
men are averaging about .350 or
more, and the entire team itself is
currently rolling along with a very
respectable .297 average in 2G games.
LII.LIE SHINES
Shortstop Bill Lillie is pacing the
Trojans with a sensational .417, and
he's backed up by first baseman
Buddy Pennell (.379), second base
man Jim Brideweser (.367) and
catcher Ken McCreight (.346).
And the men who can't match
these four in the averages can't be
dismissed as easy outs, either. Gor
don Jones, who holds down center
I field, ranks as one of the longer ball
j hitters on the club. The other two
! outfielders, Wilson and Workman,
and third baseman Crutchfield round
out the top half of the batting order
j on the ball club which S.C.'s paper,
| The Trojan, calls "a 'once in a life
time' college nine."
But, "dream team" or not, the Tro
jans still put their pants on one leg
at a time, and they can be beaten. If
the Trojans were coming up here for
a four or live game series, then
they'd be almost certain to return
with the series victory; but in one
afternoon, in one game, they might
stub their toes.
If they trip tomorrow, the Injuns
are going to be right in there try
ing to shove them the rest of the
way to the dirt, and avenge two
earlier losses at the hands of the
Trojans.

Lefty Dave D;ihlo, the ex-San
Diego Navy hurler, has first call on
the starting assignment tomorrow;
that is, if he's at all ready to go.
DAIILE ON MOUND
Dahle has been the Farm's start
ing choice for this gave ever since
Wednesday, but yesterday the burly
pitcher# was nicked by a sizzling
line drive in practice. Result; one
damaged left arm.

There will be a 50-cent admis
sion charge for Stanford student
body card holders at the Stan
ford - Southern California track
meet at Angell Field tomorrow.
Forty cents will be charged stu
dents at the Card-Trojan baseball
game on the Sunken Diamond.
Charging students admission to
games with U.S.C. has always
been a Farm policy, announced
Don Liebendorfer, S.A.C. publici
ty director.

Coach Harry Wolter won't know
until today, or tomorrow, just how
bad. or how good, Dahle's arm is
going to be. But he said last night
that if the arm does come around,
the southpaw will get a chance to
avenge an 8 to 6 defeat the Trojans
gave him last month.
Wolter is sending George Sloat
back into his left field post to re
place A 1 Kircher, who will be avail
able for any pinch-hitting duties
that may come up during the game.
Ralph Davis, who's playing this
spring has been hampered by a

stitched -up leg, may handle first
base for the Farm in the place of
Bi nny Cardinally who hasn't seen
much action since he came up with
ijn injured foot after the Santa
Clara game last week.
Ward Walkup will don his catching
regalia for the battle, and the rest
of the starting team will be same as
the one which has been playing to
gether for most of the season.
That means that Lloyd Merriman
and Ted Nell arc slated for outfield
duty, with Bill Arce, third base,
Buck Brownson, short, and Bob
Peters, secortd base, handling the
other infield positions.
.lAYVEES LOSE TO PONIES
The Farm's Jayvee baseballers
lost, 8 to 4, to the Santa Clara Ponies
yesterday afternoon as three home
runs were lashed into the outfield.
Dun lap and Bedolla of the Ponies
collected two of them, with Harry
Reichling of the Farm hitting the
other.
The Jayvees will not play again
until next Wednesday, when they
journey to Santa Clara for a return
game with the Ponies.

line drive in practice. Result; one
damaged left arm.

There will be a 50-cent admis
sion charge for Stanford student
body card holders at the Stan
ford - Southern California track
meet at Angell Field tomorrow.
Forty cents will be charged stu
dents at the Card-Trojan baseball
game on the Sunken Diamond.
Charging students admission to
games with U.S.C. has always
been a Farm policy, announced
Don Liebendorfer, S.A.C. publici
ty director.

Coach Harry Wolter won't know
until today, or tomorrow, just how
bad. or how good, Dahle's arm is
going to be. But he said last night
that if the arm does come around,
the southpaw will get a chance to
avenge an 8 to 6 defeat the Trojans
gave him last month.
Wolter is sending George Sloat
back into his left field post to re
place A 1 Kircher, who will be avail
able for any pinch-hitting duties
that may come up during the game.
Ralph Davis, who's playing this
spring has been hampered by a

stitched -up leg, may handle first
base for the Farm in the place of
Bi nny Cardinally who hasn't seen
much action since he came up with
ijn injured foot after the Santa
Clara game last week.
Ward Walkup will don his catching
regalia for the battle, and the rest
of the starting team will be same as
the one which has been playing to
gether for most of the season.
That means that Lloyd Merriman
and Ted Nell arc slated for outfield
duty, with Bill Arce, third base,
Buck Brownson, short, and Bob
Peters, secortd base, handling the
other infield positions.
.lAYVEES LOSE TO PONIES
The Farm's Jayvee baseballers
lost, 8 to 4, to the Santa Clara Ponies
yesterday afternoon as three home
runs were lashed into the outfield.
Dun lap and Bedolla of the Ponies
collected two of them, with Harry
Reichling of the Farm hitting the
other.
The Jayvees will not play again
until next Wednesday, when they
journey to Santa Clara for a return
game with the Ponies.
Sluggers. That's the synonym for Southern California's league-leading ball club.
And that's what Trojan Coach Sam Barry is bringing with him to the Farm tomorrow after
noon to battle the Indians on the Sunken Diamond tat 3:15.
IF the Indians con solve the offerings of the Trojan mounds corps and IF the Farm's
hurler can squelch the visiting bats, then the Indians just might have a chance to take the game.

It can happen, and it might, but if
the Trojans do bite the dust tomor
row, then it will have to rank as
one of the big top upsets in the cur
rent Coast Intercollegiate Baseball
Association season.
Here's an inkling of the potency
of the hitting attack the Trojans
have come up with this spring; four
men are averaging about .350 or
more, and the entire team itself is
currently rolling along with a very
respectable .297 average in 2G games.
LII.LIE SHINES
Shortstop Bill Lillie is pacing the
Trojans with a sensational .417, and
he's backed up by first baseman
Buddy Pennell (.379), second base
man Jim Brideweser (.367) and
catcher Ken McCreight (.346).
And the men who can't match
these four in the averages can't be
dismissed as easy outs, either. Gor
don Jones, who holds down center
I field, ranks as one of the longer ball
j hitters on the club. The other two
! outfielders, Wilson and Workman,
and third baseman Crutchfield round
out the top half of the batting order
j on the ball club which S.C.'s paper,
| The Trojan, calls "a 'once in a life
time' college nine."
But, "dream team" or not, the Tro
jans still put their pants on one leg
at a time, and they can be beaten. If
the Trojans were coming up here for
a four or live game series, then
they'd be almost certain to return
with the series victory; but in one
afternoon, in one game, they might
stub their toes.
If they trip tomorrow, the Injuns
are going to be right in there try
ing to shove them the rest of the
way to the dirt, and avenge two
earlier losses at the hands of the
Trojans.

Lefty Dave D;ihlo, the ex-San
Diego Navy hurler, has first call on
the starting assignment tomorrow;
that is, if he's at all ready to go.

the Trojans do bite the dust tomor
row, then it will have to rank as
one of the big top upsets in the cur
rent Coast Intercollegiate Baseball
Association season.
Here's an inkling of the potency
of the hitting attack the Trojans
have come up with this spring; four
men are averaging about .350 or
more, and the entire team itself is
currently rolling along with a very
respectable .297 average in 2G games.
LII.LIE SHINES
Shortstop Bill Lillie is pacing the
Trojans with a sensational .417, and
he's backed up by first baseman
Buddy Pennell (.379), second base
man Jim Brideweser (.367) and
catcher Ken McCreight (.346).
And the men who can't match
these four in the averages can't be
dismissed as easy outs, either. Gor
don Jones, who holds down center
I field, ranks as one of the longer ball
j hitters on the club. The other two
! outfielders, Wilson and Workman,
and third baseman Crutchfield round
out the top half of the batting order
j on the ball club which S.C.'s paper,
| The Trojan, calls "a 'once in a life
time' college nine."
But, "dream team" or not, the Tro
jans still put their pants on one leg
at a time, and they can be beaten. If
the Trojans were coming up here for
a four or live game series, then
they'd be almost certain to return
with the series victory; but in one
afternoon, in one game, they might
stub their toes.
If they trip tomorrow, the Injuns
are going to be right in there try
ing to shove them the rest of the
way to the dirt, and avenge two
earlier losses at the hands of the
Trojans.

Lefty Dave D;ihlo, the ex-San
Diego Navy hurler, has first call on
the starting assignment tomorrow;
that is, if he's at all ready to go.
DAIILE ON MOUND
Dahle has been the Farm's start
ing choice for this gave ever since
Wednesday, but yesterday the burly
pitcher# was nicked by a sizzling
line drive in practice. Result; one

There will be a 50-cent admis
sion charge for Stanford student
body card holders at the Stan
ford - Southern California track
meet at Angell Field tomorrow.
Forty cents will be charged stu
dents at the Card-Trojan baseball
game on the Sunken Diamond.
Charging students admission to
games with U.S.C. has always
been a Farm policy, announced
Don Liebendorfer, S.A.C. publici
ty director.

Coach Harry Wolter won't know
until today, or tomorrow, just how
bad. or how good, Dahle's arm is
going to be. But he said last night
that if the arm does come around,
the southpaw will get a chance to
avenge an 8 to 6 defeat the Trojans
gave him last month.
Wolter is sending George Sloat
back into his left field post to re
place A 1 Kircher, who will be avail
able for any pinch-hitting duties
that may come up during the game.
Ralph Davis, who's playing this
spring has been hampered by a

stitched -up leg, may handle first
base for the Farm in the place of
Bi nny Cardinally who hasn't seen
much action since he came up with
ijn injured foot after the Santa
Clara game last week.
Ward Walkup will don his catching
regalia for the battle, and the rest
of the starting team will be same as
the one which has been playing to
gether for most of the season.
That means that Lloyd Merriman
and Ted Nell arc slated for outfield
duty, with Bill Arce, third base,
Buck Brownson, short, and Bob
Peters, secortd base, handling the
other infield positions.
.lAYVEES LOSE TO PONIES
The Farm's Jayvee baseballers
lost, 8 to 4, to the Santa Clara Ponies

runs were lashed into the outfield.
Dun lap and Bedolla of the Ponies

Reichling of the Farm hitting the
other.
The Jayvees will not play again
until next Wednesday, when they
journey to Santa Clara for a return
game with the Ponies.
Sluggers. That's the synonym for Southern California's league-leading ball club.
And that's what Trojan Coach Sam Barry is bringing with him to the Farm tomorrow after
noon to battle the Indians on the Sunken Diamond tat 3:15.
IF the Indians con solve the offerings of the Trojan mounds corps and IF the Farm's
hurler can squelch the visiting bats, then the Indians just might have a chance to take the game.
