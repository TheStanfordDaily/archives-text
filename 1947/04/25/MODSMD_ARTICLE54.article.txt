## A 						Job That Was Well Done 
### 
Yesterday's election was one of the best
handled final elections we've seen at Stanford
in a long time.
The single ballot for voter convenience is
hard to beat. Student body cards were
punched in a special place so that no one
could vote more than once. By having voters
sign their names, residence, and class when
they voted, Election Board can check up if
any question of legality is raised. Just having
registration compulsory will prevent many
voters from cheating for fear of getting caught
if a check-up is made.
Stamping of offices to be voted instead of
checking them with a red pencil was also a
big improvement.
Election Board under Gordon Ness has
shown that our election abuses can be elim
inated.—N.B.
