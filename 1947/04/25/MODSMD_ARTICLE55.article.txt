# Room for Improvement
## 
### 
With an excess of 3000 cars on the Uni
versity grounds every class day, Stanford has
a traffic problem that nearly overwhelms the
Farm's six-man police force. In spite of this,
Chief of Police Gordon R. Davis, in praising
Stanford students, maintains that the Farm's

drivers "show a fine spirit of cooperation" in
obeying the traffic laws and the University
parking regulations.
But there is still room for improvement. The
main traffic problem centers in the smaller
cross streets back of the Chi Psi Lodge, run
ning west to the post office and the bookstore.
Vehicular traffic is particularly heavy here
and many of the professor's children use the
streets as a playground.
Other centers of trouble are the post office
and the campus gas station where traffic is
heavy during the afternoon hours.
Most of the dangers from accidents, how
ever, come from the bicycle riders. Cyclists
do not use common sense in watching for
pedestrians and other cyclists. Consequently
traffic becomes snarled after eight o'clock
classes and at the noon rush.
Palm drive is dangerous to the people rid
ing bicycles which are not adequately equip
ped with lights and reflectors. Riding in a
car down Palm drive at many motorists
are unable to see cyclists in the glare of on
coming headlights. Riders are risking their
own lives and the lives of others if they do
not take care to see that their bicycles are
properly equipped for night riding.â€”D.K.
