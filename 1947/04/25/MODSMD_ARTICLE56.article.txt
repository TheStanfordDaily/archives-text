# BULL SESSION

### DAN ENDSLEY 
As a Stanford booster, I hale very much to see a
great, worthwhile old Stanford tradition dying on its
ieet. Believe me, you freshmen, the Chaparral used
to be a pretty good magazine—well worth 10 cents,
or maybe even 15 if you drive a Cadillac.
Things have come to such a pass that I no longer
can hold my peace. Yes, I know the Chappie boys
are always making nasty cracks about The Daily (to
which I have become somewhat attached), but I hold
no grudge whatsoever. If they can get a laugh out
of lampooning us. let them go ahead; none of us are
exactly thin skinned.

That isn't what I feel so bad
about at all. Chaparral is an al
leged humor magazine, and I've
always had the idea—this may be
silly — that a humor magazine
should be funny. I hope that isn't
a radical idea because I'd hate to
have Aaron Sargent and the Ten
ney Committee after me, but it
seems only logical.
The stories—well, you can't ex
pect anything as professional as

the New Yorker might present, but there certainly is
a limit on how low you can go. I am not a prude; it
doesn't bother me if a humorist exceeds the bounds
of good taste a little bit. I ask only that he keep it
funny.
And the jokes. I don't think I'm radical at all
when I say that a joke, by definition, should be
funny. If you haven't noticed how badly our be
loved Chappie has dropped in class, here are some
samples of the latest issue's labored efforts:
"Immigration agent—Are you Russian?
Immigrant—Hell, no! I ain't in no hurry at all."

" 'Hello, Afton, can I see you tonight?'
'Sure thing. Ronnie; come on over.'
'But I'm not Ronnie.'
'And I'm not Afton.' "

"There's one about the Scotchman who emigrated
(sic) to New York and was sitting on a pier in Jersey
City when a diver came to the surface, removed his
headgear, and lit a cigarette. 'Hoot, nion,' said the
Scot, 'why did no one tell me about this? I'd have
walked over meself.'"

That, 1 believe, is a fair sample of what Chappie
is handing out these lean days. The first and third
effort might have been funny at one time, but cer
tainly all of us have heard the original jokes and their
variations so many times that the edge has been taken
oil for us. The second "joke"—oh, I can't even talk
about it. The blasted thing depresses me.
It is possible, I submit, to present jokes which,
though they may be no funnier at all, are at least
original. If we must be corny, at least let it be home
grown corn—not filched from the stalks of some other
"humor" mag.
It's an old axiom that one must not criticize with
out offering a remedy, so here are some jokes I just
thought up out of my own head which I offer to my
esteemed Chappie contempt-oraries free of charge.
They aren't funny, but at least they were grown
on the Farm:
A man named Stonewall Jackson Coughlin is
writing a column for an Alabama paper. He calls it
Bull Se-cession.

There is a local tong the members of which always
congregate at the same drive-in after a night on the
town. You know—birds of a feather.
* * * *
An odorous company is bringing out a new line
of perfume made from the blood of female sheep.
It will be called Ewe de Cologne.

I freely admit that those gags will cause no
shivers to run down the spines of Henry Morgan,
Fred Allen, et al., but — sad thouph it be — they're
a big improvement over the recent Chappies.
