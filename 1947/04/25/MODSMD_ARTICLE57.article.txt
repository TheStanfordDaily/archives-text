To the Editor:
In my previous letter, it was not my intention to
imply that the only adequate education is one that is
necessarily frought with strife and sacrifice, although
I certainly do believe that there is an important value
to be derived from having to work for the things we
want. Unless an individual is unusually adult in his
thinking, he is not likely to fully appreciate that
which comes too easily and so may be thoroughly
educated under our system and still be irresponsible
and immature; and the future of our existence is de
pendent on the moral integrity and mature think
ing of our people.
A more capable society is undoubtedly the result
of better living conditions and greater security, but
it is easily possible to do too much for the citizen.
Throughout history, the relief of individual respon
sibility has brought about demoralization of charac
ter and disintegration of civilization.
Granted that the benefits of free public education
are innumerable, may 1 point out that this education
does not necessarily include the defrayment of all
living costs. Completely free public education (and
support for all those who wish to attend) on the col
lege level is now an economic impossibility. '

''All letters should be addressed to the editor,
signed and contain address and phone num
ber ot writer. There is no limit on words but
it is desirable letters be short and to the poin'J

Though the policy is entirely desirable, its appli
cation at present allows only the ex-service man these
benefits; and 1 feel that, under the existing provisions
of the G.I. Bill of Rights, the veteran in college is be
ing amply repaid for his service and for any loss of
earnings he may have suffered.
Certainly the addition of many more millions to
the already heavy tax burden by any subsistence
increase would not assist in the foundation of a stable
national economy. The solution to the present rising
spiral of living costs cannot lie in the theory, "He got
his, so I want mine," as it is this same theory that has
brought about the present chaotic conditions.

To the Editor:
On behalf of the entire student body I should
like to extend my heart-felt sympathies to the poor
veterans who, because of inadequate government
allowance, have to work part-time to put themselves
through college. As every self respecting Stanford
student will agree, it is highly unconventional for
anyone to do part-time work while in college to help
pay his expenses.

national economy. The solution to the present rising
spiral of living costs cannot lie in the theory, "He got
his, so I want mine," as it is this same theory that has
brought about the present chaotic conditions.

On behalf of the entire student body I should
like to extend my heart-felt sympathies to the poor
veterans who, because of inadequate government
allowance, have to work part-time to put themselves
through college. As every self respecting Stanford
student will agree, it is highly unconventional for
anyone to do part-time work while in college to help
pay his expenses.

To the Editor:
In my previous letter, it was not my intention to
imply that the only adequate education is one that is
necessarily frought with strife and sacrifice, although
I certainly do believe that there is an important value
to be derived from having to work for the things we
want. Unless an individual is unusually adult in his
thinking, he is not likely to fully appreciate that
which comes too easily and so may be thoroughly
educated under our system and still be irresponsible
and immature; and the future of our existence is de
pendent on the moral integrity and mature think
ing of our people.
A more capable society is undoubtedly the result
of better living conditions and greater security, but
it is easily possible to do too much for the citizen.
Throughout history, the relief of individual respon

Though the policy is entirely desirable, its appli

benefits; and 1 feel that, under the existing provisions
of the G.I. Bill of Rights, the veteran in college is be
ing amply repaid for his service and for any loss of
earnings he may have suffered.
Certainly the addition of many more millions to
the already heavy tax burden by any subsistence
increase would not assist in the foundation of a stable
national economy. The solution to the present rising
spiral of living costs cannot lie in the theory, "He got
his, so I want mine," as it is this same theory that has
brought about the present chaotic conditions.
