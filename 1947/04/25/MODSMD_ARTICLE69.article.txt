## Coeds Pick Play Clothes For Comfort, Durability 
### DEE KEATLEY 
Now that spring is really here
and the hot California .sun shines
brightly down on Quad every day,
Stanford girls are blossoming out j
in those familiar companions of |
spring and summer, "play clothes." j
For picnicking, hiking, sunbathing, j
or just anything, play clothes are
ever in demand because of their
durability, comfort, and attractive- !
ness.
Along about 11 o'clock every
morning when the sun is riding high
in the sky, Stanford girls are bask- 1
ing in the sun on their dorm roofs
or on the dock of the boathouse 1
trying their best to turn black so '
that visitors will take them for true 1
Injun maidens. The usual attire :
for this activity is a bathing suit,
the locality determining whether it i
be a faded last years' model or one !

in the latest flattering style. Three
types of bathing suits are promin
ent lit the boathouse: the durable
standard one-piecer of cotton or
rayon elastic, the tight fitting two
piccer, and the fluffy rullly cotton
-.unsuit type>
Standard white shorts are ever
popular where the sun is hot. One
particularly fresh example of these
standbys is made of white pique
with a matching halter top. Another,
of white canvas, has a wide elastic
top, a direct steal from the boxing
ring. G'ne Hoble girl owns a pair
»112 "lien hunting in Africa pants,"
long khaki shorts looking" exactly
like the short pants explorers wear
in the tropics. Hawaiian print shirts,
and shorts are still popular as are
cut-oft' blue jeans fringed in the
Indian manner.
An unusually cut sundress seeno

on Quad recently by your reporter,

; around the bottom of the full skirt.
Another attractive cotton one of
yellow and navy blue big plaid had
a high neck and no back to the waist.
A matching bolero jacket covered
the top and made it look like an or
dinary dress.
In the midrif-skirt section two
dresses seen around recently should
be mentioned. The top of a gingham
one has cap sleeves, and a huge ruffle
around the low neck. The full skirt
is made with two white ribbon tiers
running around it horizontally. The
other dress ol green and white pol
kadotted cotton has white rickrack
