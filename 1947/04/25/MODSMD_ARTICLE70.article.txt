# Ingenuity Shown in Bed-time Fashions

Spring slfeepers . •. . no, they're
not a type of flower, unless you
term the average Indian maiden
the flower of the Farm crop.
Look out! Personality definitely
can be judged by your bed-time
fashions. One Brannerite, a recent
return from Florida, came back with
the most intriguing outfit yet. The
Salome, so called, has alternating
bright pink and blue on the top and
bottom, a sweetheart neckline,
and a long, draped jersey skirt with
a slit to the knee line. Split per

l sonality for that gal—or perhaps 1
something else!
If they don't like intrigue, the
1 maidens go in for bright colors and j
odd shapes (in nightwear, that is). !
One pair of pajamas practically j
gave us a circus nightmare. Imag- j
ine elephants and giraffes tramp
ling on you all night in 15 clashing
colors (orange predominating).
Just the thing for these warm ;
nights are shorties of all shapes,
sizes, and descriptions. Great white
billowing skirts—size 42 or 44 (tent
size for packing and stealing away j
into dreamland) are quite popular. |

Tailored tommie coats with shorter
sleeves and the briefer shorts with
a tie-up top also top the list.
A winter hangover, and not quite
jas common at Stanford, are, the
j Dr. Denton specials with the feet
included and the conventional back.
But in accord with the season, ma
| terial consumption is getting less
; and less instead of more and more,
j For those sleepers whose material
! has reached the point of nothing
; ness, we recommend the Teddy Bear
| and Tootsies to complete that bare
| look.
