# Print Dresses Top Stanford Coeds Date Attire
## Light Materials Replace Wool in Spring Wardrobe 
### PAULA NUSSER 
It's that time of year when yoy
i first begin to realize that the hills
across the lake have got a bright,
new coat of green paint, that the
red burn on your cheeks wasn't
acquired out ol a rouge box, and
that last year's bathing suit shrunk
during the winter season (your diet,
of course, was immaterial).
You smile to yourself when you
i read in your Daily that "the beasts
j look better this time of year" and
I make a mental note to store your
j sweater, skirts, and wool dresses in
I the back nook of the closet lor a
| colder month.
REFRESHING PRINT
A refreshing white print would
i be just the right background for a
| deep red tan (kidding ourselves out
of the term "sunburn"). And there
it is—a white rayon crepe, pencil
i slim with the ever faithful cap
sleeves. When you turn your back
on your favorite beau, he will dis
cover a large, little-girl bow accent-

Ed by a soft gathering <;f the ma
terial dropping smoothly to the new
long hemline.
But, you ask, what about that
special Saturday night date at Kin
del Mar or atop the Claremont—
i-i'sr got to be something just a little
different. A coffee hammered satin
dress fits the bill for "What's New."
The material is its eyecatching fea
ture so simplicity is the keynote for
the cut of the dress. The neckline
iS high with a short, pointed collar.
The shoulders are softened by three
unusual pleats on each side ending
in abbreviated cap sleeves. Delicate,
shining gold-brown buttons reach
from the neck to the waistline.
Small pleats are gathered at the
hips falling into a very long hem.
FOR DINNER AT DINAH'S
Dinner at Dinah's or church on
Sunday niyht call for a dashing new
prey pabardine suit. The jaunty
gabardine has the now cutaway
acket with spicy jet buttons and
saucy Hap pockets.

Formally speaking, just what did
you lind in formals? So you found
out that cotton is going dancing this
season, did you? Your new yellow
and grey striped cotton is really on
top of the fashion heap. Stripes run
round and round the strapless bodice
and tiered skirt.
Happy dating, Miss Co-ed. Though
the laces and silks of Cinderella's
time are still scarce, you have quite
the jump on the fairy-tale heroine.
She had never heard of special two
thirtics!
