New spring outfits demand now
spring accessories and the fashion
designers are supplying them. Hand
bags are becoming more imaginative
and distinctive.
Many of the new leather bags are
complete with matching belts. One
double-purpose accessory consists of
a capeskin bell that will highlight
spring clothes when worn alone and
a matching pouch that can be hung
on the belt or worn alone also.

The favorite overshoulder bags 1
are those that sport a large, hand
some medalion. These leather beau- j
ties r're red or brown.
For those who prefer a bag in the j
hand, the designers prepared a small, j
compact round purse â€” cylinder- j
shaped.
Another overshoulder bag that is j
popular this year is the pouch with
a drawstring opening. A matching
Lclt which can be purchased with i

this bag can act as a tonic lor
not-so-new clothes.
Spring shoes are both high and
low. Ballet shoes, loafers, and vari
ations of the shanksmere are still
popular. Now that the well-loved
spectators are more plentiful, they
are coming back into the foreground
of spring and summer fashions. Plat
form shoes are still advised by the
fashion expert.
