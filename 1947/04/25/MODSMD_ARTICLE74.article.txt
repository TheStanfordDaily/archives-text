Dear Wondering:
To make a special hit for that dreamland date, several have tried
the high-necked wool pajamas, straight from the Aleutians with cult's
and a drawstring. These are impractical however if you breathe very
often.
Believe it or not, some maidens arc caught clad in old-fashioned
high-neck flannel nightgowns. Even more interesting are the sheer
black chiffon nighties, dripping with lace. . . .
Love. Cynthia
