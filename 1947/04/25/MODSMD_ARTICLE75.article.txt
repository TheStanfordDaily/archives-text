# SLIPPER FASHIONS VARY
## 
### 
Stanford women seek comfort !
rather than beauty in their slipper ;
fashions. Indian moccasins made of
suede and decorated with tiny beads j
arc popular with coeds. Furry slip- [
heeless slippers arc an all
around, all-time fashion.
Hand knit baby slippers are |
chosen for their comfort as well as j
originality. Their colors arc true to J
form, baby blue and pink.
Ski socks with reinforced soles }
are still sought by Stanford stu- i
dents. A new, dressier type of slip- !
per, with gold or silver metal em- I
bossments, are becoming popular in j
campus dorms.
