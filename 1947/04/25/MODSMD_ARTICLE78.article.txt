# Suits are Good for All Seasons and Occasions
## Post-war Fashions Repeat History 
### MARGIE SAMPSON 
In 1922 Maurice Chevalier, the
singing sensation from Paris, was
giving out with "My Man;" our par
ents were the college kids of those
days, and their parents were ex
claiming about "lliat younger gen
eration."
The fashion was the opposite of
today's "sweater girl" type, with
the typical coed blossoming forth in
the fashionable shapeless dress with
a waistline down about her hips.
That was in 1922, four years after
the first world war; comparable to
1949—four years after World War
11.

Wilh an eye to the future, let's
take a look at the prevailing fash
ions in women's clothes after the
first World War. If, as they say,
history repeats itself, we may be
able to predict long skirts, dipping
hemlines, full, draped skirts, and
low waistlines for the next few
years.
With a potato-sack effect, the tip
per half of the l'J22 dress went
straight from shoulder to hips, blous
ing over the sash tied around the
hips. Emphasis was on the long
sweeping lines, causing a wide,
straight silhouette.
The long, draped skirt was popu

lar after the first World War, just
as it is now. Often split part way
up the front, the skirts had uneven,
dipping hemlines—another trend of
these post-World War II years. Off.
the-shoulder dresses were popular
for dinner and evening wear, as
they are now, emphasizing the
slender silhouette.
Alter skimping on material dur
ing the years of both wars, manu
facturers and fashion designers ran
rampant on the use of material, as
shown in the fully draped, extra
long skirts, and full sleeves popular
in 1020 and 1047. Deep hems and
real pockets are again fashionable

i after years of material rationing.
Paris fashion designers seem to
I be leading us along the same path as
| after World War I. An observant
lerson may, with dismay, predict
that soon the well-known American
sweater girl will be no more, and
in her place will be the girl of 1922
with a wide, straight silhouette.
