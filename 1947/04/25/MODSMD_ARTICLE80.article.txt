# Authorities Add Two Inches To the Fashionable Skirt
## 
### BETTY TALBOT 
Practically everything is in fash
ion this year—straight skirts, pleated
skirts, long jackets, short jackets—
anything that is the most becoming
to you.
Above all the most revolutionary
movement in fashion is the longer
skirt. Authorities decree two inches
longer than last year, but any
longer length is right if it is Hat
taring.
Straight box jackets over slim
. kirts are seen with boleros and
pleated-all-around skirts. To add
to the variation, long cut-away
jackets are as much in fashion as

short jackets with little flares in
back.
The full pleated skirts are back
again after so long an absence. Even
bias-flared skirts are being show.
Sometimes peplums are pleated
over straight-skirted dresses.
Necklines are dropping lower by
night, but they're buttoned up high
by day.
Hats have taken a definite turn for
the better. They are molded to the
shape of the head, smaller, $nd
simpler. Bonnets and (floches are
liberally trimmed with flowers this
spring.
