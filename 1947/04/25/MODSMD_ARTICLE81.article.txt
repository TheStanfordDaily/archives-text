# Roughs Wear Service Trousers on Quad; Broadcloth To Replace Wool Plaid Shirts
## 
### STU FITCH 
In spring a young man's fancy
clothes lightly turn—in both color
and weight. Obviously the Stanford
fashion plate in these warmer daze
will make his class appearance in
at least two things—pants and shirt.
Casual Quad scenes give a liberal
choice in the uniform of the day.
Khaki and gr£y service trousers
are the most frequenlty seen, with
levis running a close second. Ob
viously the choice is not for fash
ion's sake, but economy's.
TIIE MOOTED ROUGH
The more financially sound Rough
(rhymes with Cadillac) may be the
proud owner of enough slacks to
make a daily selection. But then
enters the problem of cleaning bills,
which limits regular slack wearing
to the allowance receivers.
Pants on, the man then ponders
over a shirt to wear. Easiest, and
frequently seen, the familiar
white skivy or T shirt. If the Rough
decides to wear a shirt over same,
it is usually white or a plain color.
"The" stores claim white shirts as
the best sellers. Plain colored ones
lead out next, with striped jobs

I sitting on the shelves in a state of
j rest.
BROADCLOTH FOR SPRING
Wool plaids were in keeping with
| winter fashions, and now spring is
here, the broadcloth version of same
is expected to ring up sales.
Over the shirt comes the sweater,
j Stores would have one believe no
[ body is anybody unless he always
I wears a cashmere. At 25 bucks a
| throw, it takes somebody to have
j enough assortment to make daily
i appearances without having people
j mutter "unclean" to their associ
ates. So, any sweater will do, pref
erably one that isn't wearing through
at the elbows.
MALES SPORT ARGYLES
For the well dressed fellow a
sporting pants, shirt, and sweater,
: shoes and socks are in order. Sock
j wearing Stanford males go in for
argylss mainly and plain white
jobs for strictly summer wear. Cot
ton arpyles are now replacing their
wintertime wool brothers.
Shoes in the line of fashions show
a race for first between saddles and
moccasins, but solid browns are
.'irking up in popularity.
For date dress and undress the

male animal goes in for sports coats
i and slacks. Clothiers state check
i pants and plain coats are the cur
rent rage. One local merchant says
University taste in color combos is
lousy, so the color-blind youth
has little to worry about in keeping
abreast with the times.
STRIPES ARE NEW
Esquire and the merchants an
nounce that stripes is the latest word
in ties, but still a good many loud
j prints are seen around local necks.
; 3ow and four-in-hands are both in
i fashion. One Paly store boasts a
| booming business in hand painted
jobs.
So, the well dressed Rough has a
chance to be just that in almost any
attire. What he doesn't have, he
borrows from his roommate. If he
buys, Mose is the man to see.

here, the broadcloth version of same

MALES SPORT ARGYLES

jobs for strictly summer wear. Cot
ton arpyles are now replacing their

So, the well dressed Rough has a
chance to be just that in almost any

borrows from his roommate. If he
buys, Mose is the man to see.


THREE STANFORD HOUGHS APPEAR IN VAR lED OUTFITS in the above picture. Fred Wiley (left)
is modeling a chocolate brown wool cardigan coat. All (he outfits in this picture are from Mould's in Los
Alios. Bernard Woody (center) is wearing a small l> lue and grey check sportcoat. The coat is brightened
with large red squares. Gene Martin (right) is mode ling one of Mould's white tennis sweaters. The three
fellows are pictured on the lawn in front of the Stanford Museum.


CASHMERE IS THE THEME OF THIS OUTFIT from Fox Limited
in Pulo Alto. Dick Padgham models a navy blue cashmere sweater
and grey slacks just right for campus wear. The sweater has the
traditional V neck. Dick's slacks are flannel. He is posing on the
lawn in front of the Stanford Museum.
In spring a young man's fancy
clothes lightly turn—in both color
and weight. Obviously the Stanford
fashion plate in these warmer daze
will make his class appearance in
at least two things—pants and shirt.
Casual Quad scenes give a liberal
choice in the uniform of the day.
Khaki and gr£y service trousers
are the most frequenlty seen, with
levis running a close second. Ob
viously the choice is not for fash
ion's sake, but economy's.
TIIE MOOTED ROUGH
The more financially sound Rough
(rhymes with Cadillac) may be the
proud owner of enough slacks to
make a daily selection. But then
enters the problem of cleaning bills,
which limits regular slack wearing
to the allowance receivers.
Pants on, the man then ponders
over a shirt to wear. Easiest, and
frequently seen, the familiar
white skivy or T shirt. If the Rough
decides to wear a shirt over same,
it is usually white or a plain color.
"The" stores claim white shirts as
