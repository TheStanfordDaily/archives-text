# Campus Fashions Headline Cool Date Dresses
## Clothing Fads Become Chic 
### 
This year has seen many changes
in clothing fads. True to the pre
diction of the fashion world the
trend has been toward the more
chic.
Hair clips this year have appeared
in silver and gold, in any shape from
the slim bar to the most elaborate
buckle type. The buckle type is the
newest and encompasses the small
oval typo to the largest of the rec
tangular ones.
Especially in footgear has the
swing been to the more elabor">t».
Shanksmeres arc replacing dirty
saddles and even ie«uier sanuliD
are the coming thing for the spring
weather. Some of these sandles have
no body to the shoe but a single
thong that keeps it on the bare feet.
Others of them are reminiscent of
the crossed leather buckled shoes
worn by kindergarten students. But
all of these sandles and shanksmares
as well as the ballet shoes come in
nearly every color.
The appearance of belts—big wide
ones, and the disappearance of the
sagging sweater has made the win
ter clothes more trim looking. Now
that cashmeres are easier to obtain,
closer fitting sweaters are more fre
quently seen. 4
Another type of sweater to gain
favor among the campus women are
the short-sleeved ones. These seem
to be especially good for the cool
mornings of this climate.
Large silk bandanas have been
seized upon to replace the old white
as soon as the silk was obtainable
on the market. The silk prints vary
all the way from the New York sky
line, large floral patterns to the
map of the world.
In the matter of hair orn§in)ents,
there have been fewer' of the hair
bands seen. Large bpws at the ,back
of the head or on the Side have taken
their place. Flowers also are worn
in the hair both on Quad and on
dates. In the early spring sweet
smelling daphne was worn every
where and later rose buds and
orange blossoms,- -. ... ..
