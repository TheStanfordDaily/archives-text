# Anderson Explains Scheduling of I.S.C. Talks; Says Misunderstanding Caused 'Pro' Speech
## 
### 
In an effort to present a clear picture to the students of the I.S.C.
presentation at the clcction assembly. I am submitting this article.
In response to students' requests to introduce the I.S.C. candidates
to the student bof';' so that thry might be judged as other candidates,
1 put tin in 011 the program, litis was done several days before the
assembly, 'there was no secret made of thisâ€”Flection Board knew of it.
My understanding was that they were not to sell the I.S.C. but merely
to state what was involved as I bad done 011 the previous two propo
sitions. 'I he second speaker presented a strong case in favor of the
program. It was not his fault, but rather mine in not clearly explaining
to him bis purpose before the assembly.
Stan Shpctncr, two minutes before the assembly, asked to speak
against the I.S.C. lie was told at that time that, when the two candidates
were to be introduced, there would be no "pro" or "con" speeches, but
merely a presentation of the I.S.C.
Shpctncr knew or should have known the candidates were introduced
in good faith.
Shpctncr was NCT thrown or ordered off the stage!
As evidence to good faith in this matter, 1 should like to point out
that it was at irv suggestion last quarter that Fxcom submit the propo
sition to popular vote. IF a petition of 15ft students was received. There
's no provision for such a referendum in the A.S.S.U. constitution.
Martin Anderson,
A.S.S.U. President
