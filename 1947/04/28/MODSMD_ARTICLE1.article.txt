# U.S. Adopts Firm Policy--Marshall
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 27 (UP).—Secretary of State George C.
Marshall told President Truman and top Congressional leaders
tonight he had emphasized at the Moscow conference that the
United States had adopted an unbending, unappeasing policy
on the unsettled Axis peace treaties.
In a one-hour and 50-minute White House conference, the

Secretary gave the President and
Republican and Demcratic leaders
of both House and Senate a "pre
view" of his radio report to the na
tion tomorrow night on the Big Four
peace conference which ended in
disagreement.
NO APPEASEMENT
"They were my impressions of
what took place," Marshall told
newsmen on the windswept White
House portico after the meeting.
But the Senators and Congress
men who attended said the report
was more than that. In effect, the
report indicated that the United
States for the first time in a meet
ing of the Big Four Foreign Minis
ters had shown no inclination to
appease Russia.
"He gave us at this meeting the
idea that he had clarified the U.N.
and put it across to the Russians,"
one of the conferees said.
NEW POLICY
This confcree said that Marshall's
report indicated a new American
policy of firmness, exemplified by
the fact that the Secretary of State
waited through most of the long,
discouraging conference before he
sought a meeting with Premier Jo
sef Stalin.
"Marshall impressed all of us with
a new sureness," this informant
said. "We got the distinct impres
sion that not only had he strength
ened the hand of our people at the
Moscow conference, but that he also
had given the other countries of
Europe and their free peoples defi
nite courage."
Fully half the meeting was taken
up with questions. The discussion
was limited to the Moscow confer
ence. There was no mention, the
conferee said, of additional funds to
fipht Communism in Europe.
"Marshall did not indicate in any
way that the Groak - Turkish aid
measures taken by the United States
had affected the outcome of the Big
Four conferences in any way," he
added, "but there was no question
in his mind but that it had had a
profound cflcct upon the Russian
leaders."
EXCELLENT JOB
Another of the conferees, Chair
man Styles Bridges, R., N.H., of the
Senate Appropriations Committee,
summed up the meeting this way:
"I came away from the confer
ence with the feeling that Marshall
had done an excellent job of pre
senting the American case, the case
of a free people, at Moscow.
"The conference closed with no
visible accomplishments, but one
thing that was accomplished was the
clarification of all the many issues
which were in controversy. This
clarification, I feel, may in time be
the basis for definite tangible prog
ress."

said. "We got the distinct impres
sion that not only had he strength
ened the hand of our people at the
Moscow conference, but that he also
had given the other countries of
Europe and their free peoples defi
nite courage."
Fully half the meeting was taken
up with questions. The discussion
was limited to the Moscow confer
ence. There was no mention, the
conferee said, of additional funds to
fipht Communism in Europe.
"Marshall did not indicate in any
way that the Groak - Turkish aid
measures taken by the United States
had affected the outcome of the Big
Four conferences in any way," he
added, "but there was no question
in his mind but that it had had a
profound cflcct upon the Russian
leaders."
EXCELLENT JOB
Another of the conferees, Chair
man Styles Bridges, R., N.H., of the
Senate Appropriations Committee,
summed up the meeting this way:
"I came away from the confer
ence with the feeling that Marshall
had done an excellent job of pre
senting the American case, the case
of a free people, at Moscow.
"The conference closed with no
visible accomplishments, but one
thing that was accomplished was the
clarification of all the many issues
which were in controversy. This
clarification, I feel, may in time be
the basis for definite tangible prog
ress."
WASHINGTON, April 27 (UP).—Secretary of State George C.
Marshall told President Truman and top Congressional leaders
tonight he had emphasized at the Moscow conference that the
United States had adopted an unbending, unappeasing policy
on the unsettled Axis peace treaties.
In a one-hour and 50-minute White House conference, the

Secretary gave the President and
Republican and Demcratic leaders
of both House and Senate a "pre
view" of his radio report to the na
tion tomorrow night on the Big Four
peace conference which ended in
disagreement.
NO APPEASEMENT
"They were my impressions of
what took place," Marshall told
newsmen on the windswept White
House portico after the meeting.
But the Senators and Congress
men who attended said the report
was more than that. In effect, the
report indicated that the United
States for the first time in a meet
ing of the Big Four Foreign Minis
ters had shown no inclination to
appease Russia.
"He gave us at this meeting the
idea that he had clarified the U.N.
and put it across to the Russians,"
one of the conferees said.
NEW POLICY
This confcree said that Marshall's
report indicated a new American
policy of firmness, exemplified by
the fact that the Secretary of State
waited through most of the long,
discouraging conference before he
sought a meeting with Premier Jo
sef Stalin.
"Marshall impressed all of us with
a new sureness," this informant
said. "We got the distinct impres
sion that not only had he strength
ened the hand of our people at the
Moscow conference, but that he also
had given the other countries of
Europe and their free peoples defi
nite courage."
