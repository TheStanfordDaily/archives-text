# 'Thank You' Letters Received by ‘Y’ For Gifts Sent To Foreign Students
## 
### MARGIE HANSON 
Excerpt from a letter from Burgi
Cornides of Vienna:
. You cannot imagine what a
great thing 'parcels' have become in
Europe; it is one of the principal
topics of conversation, thought, and
emotion. And such an agreeable
topic . . . instead of thinking and
talking about what one needs! They
make you so happy because you
feel that there are friends in the
world outside. . . . And then of
course comes the unpacking of those
parcels, for which all the family
and friends gather, which is a treat,
because everything from food to
underwear, to books, everything is
lovely because it fulls some great
need. . . ."
This letter, and many more like
it, are testimonials to the value of
the work of the Y.YV.C.A. Foreign
Students Committee last quarter in
sending 32 boxes to France, Ger

many, Holland. Belgium, and Scot- I
land.
ONE OF 10 ACTIVITIES
This committee, headed by Emily
Angle, is one of the 10 "Y" activity
committees.
According to Miss Angle the
boxes were sent only to students or
families with students. Names were
turned in by Stanford students and
faculty, and foreign women students
with relatives or friends abroad.
Inspired by letters of gratitude for
previous parcels, the committee en
larged its program last quarter and
created a central file containing |
complete information about mailing
packages to Europe.
This file, available in the "Y" of
fices to any living group or indi- j
vidual who wishes to send a parcel, ;
contains addresses, suggestions for
contents, and regulations for pack
| ing and mailing. The average cost
j for mailing each 11-pound box is
I $1.54.

CORRESPONDENCE PLANKS
In addition the file contains appli
cation blanks for those who would
like to correspond with a foreign
student. These application blanks,
when returned to the "Y" officcs,
will be sent to the International
Student Service in Geneva, where
they will be matched with applica
tions of European students.
As contacts with students are
made through this correspondence,
new n&mes will be added to the file
and packages will be sent to them.
"Any student interested in work
ing on this project or in meeting the
foreign women students on campus
should contact me or Miss Pat Da
vidson, director, in the 'Y' offices,"
Miss Angle said.
Last quarter the committee held a
tea for foreign women students on
campus, to give them a chance to
meet other Stanford women. The
committee is planning another such
tea within two weeks.

because everything from food to
underwear, to books, everything is
lovely because it fulls some great
need. . . ."
This letter, and many more like
it, are testimonials to the value of
the work of the Y.YV.C.A. Foreign
Students Committee last quarter in
sending 32 boxes to France, Ger

many, Holland. Belgium, and Scot- I
land.
ONE OF 10 ACTIVITIES
This committee, headed by Emily
Angle, is one of the 10 "Y" activity
committees.
According to Miss Angle the
boxes were sent only to students or
families with students. Names were
turned in by Stanford students and
faculty, and foreign women students
with relatives or friends abroad.
Inspired by letters of gratitude for
previous parcels, the committee en
larged its program last quarter and
created a central file containing |
complete information about mailing
packages to Europe.
This file, available in the "Y" of
fices to any living group or indi- j
vidual who wishes to send a parcel, ;
contains addresses, suggestions for
contents, and regulations for pack
| ing and mailing. The average cost
j for mailing each 11-pound box is
I $1.54.

CORRESPONDENCE PLANKS
In addition the file contains appli
cation blanks for those who would
like to correspond with a foreign
student. These application blanks,
when returned to the "Y" officcs,
will be sent to the International
Student Service in Geneva, where
they will be matched with applica
tions of European students.
As contacts with students are
made through this correspondence,
new n&mes will be added to the file
and packages will be sent to them.
"Any student interested in work
ing on this project or in meeting the
foreign women students on campus
should contact me or Miss Pat Da
vidson, director, in the 'Y' offices,"
Miss Angle said.
Last quarter the committee held a
tea for foreign women students on
campus, to give them a chance to
meet other Stanford women. The
committee is planning another such
tea within two weeks.
Excerpt from a letter from Burgi
Cornides of Vienna:
. You cannot imagine what a
great thing 'parcels' have become in
Europe; it is one of the principal
topics of conversation, thought, and
emotion. And such an agreeable
topic . . . instead of thinking and
talking about what one needs! They
make you so happy because you
feel that there are friends in the
world outside. . . . And then of
course comes the unpacking of those
parcels, for which all the family
and friends gather, which is a treat,
because everything from food to
underwear, to books, everything is
lovely because it fulls some great
need. . . ."
