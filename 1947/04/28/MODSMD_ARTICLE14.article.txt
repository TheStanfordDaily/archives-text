"Donate that favorite stuffed ani
mal," said Carolyn Reeder, head of
the Convalescent Home Toy Drive,
who urged all women to help in the
collection of toys and games for the
Convalescent Home children.
The drive, starting today, will
; continue until Wednesday when
i trucks will collect the toys from sta
| rions at Branner, Lagunita, Storey
House, and Union Unit. The toys
will be distributed Wednesday to
the children.
Small animals and games or any
small inexpensive toys purchased at
the dime store are especially needed
; for the bedridden patients. "It is
| one thing from which the children
| will get immediate benefit, and the
I effort is very little in comparison
| to their amusement," concluded Miss
I Reeder.
