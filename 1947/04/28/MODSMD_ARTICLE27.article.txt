# Glamorous Limb To Hold Pennies
## 
### 
Copper coin contributions to the
Stanford Convalescent Home may
be deposited in the glamorous leg in
front of the Cellar this week, chair
man Jean Rodgers has announced.
After the big has been filled with
coins, it will be placed in a booth
at the Sophomore Carnival, and
students may guess the number of
pennies for a prize, Miss Rodgers
added. The cent pieces will then Ie
added to the money collected for the
Convalescent Home.
