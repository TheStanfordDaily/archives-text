# Farm Students Learn Horsemanship On Acreage Adjoining Old Red Barn
## 
### MARY HILL 
In the historic setting of the oak-tree shaded acreage adjoining the Old Red Barn, Stanford stu
dents are learning the A, B, C's of horsemanship, and the advanced students, riding and jumping
like veterans of the show ring, are getting down the alphabet of equestrian knowledge.
More than 60 students, men and women, are taking part in the riding program which was
revived at Stanford in September of 1946 when Mr. and Mrs. Allen Ross came to campus to

revive the art of Stanford horse
manship at the Old Red Barn, where
Senator Leland Stanic«d once bred
and trained the trotters and other
thoroughbreds which carried the
Stanford colors.
new equipment
The Rosses brought 35 horses and
complete equipment for both west
ern and English style riding, and
opened the stable facilities to stu
dents and faculty alike, as well as
to friends of the university.
The eight-month program of in
struction which they have directed
is paying off now in the skills of
Stanford men and coeds alike, who
arc jumping hurdles and handling
their horses with the firm but gen
tle skill which comes to riders only
through experience and expert train
ing.
'the riding program is part of the
physical education curriculum and
open to all students for a $45 a
quarter equitation fee which enti
tles them to ride twice a week and
receive instruction in six classes
which run throughout the week.
The riding meets lower division
physical education requirements
and counts as credit for juniors and
seniors.
RIDING SINCE CHILDHOOD
Mr. Ross, who has been connected
with riding since he was 16 and
whose wife, Mrs. Patti Ross was
Stanford coed in the class of 1940,
points out that riding fee is much
less than any student would pay
for similar facilities in any private
riding stables on the Peninsula, as
is the casual riding fee of $1.50 an
hour open to anyone connected with
the university. All that is required
for students or faculty to make use
of the horses is a reservation which
can be made by telephoning Palo
Alto 2-5713. Boarding facilities for
horses are available at the stable.
Only restriction on persons out
side the university family making
use of the facilities is that they must
he accompanied on the ride by a
student or faculty member.
Expert horsewomen of the ad
vancde class include Paula Jones,
Margaret Carol Slater, Anne Stick
ney, Edith Magee and Joan Clay.
Several of them have taken the rid
ing courses more than once.
Among the horsemen who are
making rapid progress in riding
skill are Philip Roos, Don Beeman,
Henry Bernstein and Robert Mc-
Cann.
I I N WHILE LEARNING
The Aliens emphasize informality
and fun in their instruction, and
there is little of the top nit, ion v.
red hunting coat approach to their
style of teaching. Jeans are as com
mon riding wear as jodphurs or rid
ing trousers, and the emphasis is on
learning how to ride properly rather !
than looking pretty while you do it,
the Rosses point out.
The instruction is thorough, how
ever. The beginning student learns
first to ride and saddle his own horse.
He learns how a horse should be
cared for, as well as the proper
form in his chosn type of riding,
either western or English.
Instruction is given partly in a

ring which is now being covored
with the traditional tanbark of
horse show rings, or in the oval
which lies between the fairways of
the Stanford golf course, and the
rest of the time is spent riding over
the campus or in the hills back of
the university.
The intermediate students get
more advanced instruction in the
fundamentals with which they be
come acquainted as beginner, and
spend a good deal of time outside
of the ring, and begin drills on
horseback.
The advanced student gets into
jumping, as well as "stick and ball,"
which is an adaptation of polo.
Western style riders learn tricks of
roping and packing which will come
in handy on pack trips. Both west
ern and English style students do
drilling on horseback.
LONG HISTORY
The revival of interest in horse
manship is in keeping with the tra
ditions of the Old Red Barn, which
was part of the Palo Alto Stock Farm
which Senator Stanford purchased
in 187(5.
At one time there were more than
75 trotting horses in training daily
at the farm, and more than 20 stal
lions and 300 mares.
Eighty men were employed on the
farm, not counting blacksmiths, Chi
nese laborers, harness makers, and
ranch hands.
A mile track as well as a three
quarter track were maintained and

an open training paddock about a
tenth of a mile in circumference,
and a covered paddock for use in
rainy weather.
FIRST MOVIES
It was in a loft of Ihe Red Barn
that the famous Muybridge photos
were first shown, the result of Mr.
Stanford's curiosity about the posi
tion of a horse's legs in action. A
monument, not far from the present
oval, commemorates this event,
which produced a result not unlike
present motion pictures.
The tradition of Stanford horse
manship and love of fine horses is
being revived in a setting which is
full of memories of one of the most
colorful features of the early days
of Stanford when fine horses —
champion trotters, blue-blood stal
lions and mares—made the name of
Stanford as famous in the field of
horsemanship and trotting competi
tion as it was in the fields of edu
cation and government.

LONG HISTORY
The revival of interest in horse
manship is in keeping with the tra
ditions of the Old Red Barn, which
was part of the Palo Alto Stock Farm
which Senator Stanford purchased
in 187(5.
At one time there were more than
75 trotting horses in training daily
at the farm, and more than 20 stal
lions and 300 mares.
Eighty men were employed on the
farm, not counting blacksmiths, Chi
nese laborers, harness makers, and
ranch hands.
A mile track as well as a three
quarter track were maintained and

an open training paddock about a
tenth of a mile in circumference,
and a covered paddock for use in
rainy weather.
FIRST MOVIES
It was in a loft of Ihe Red Barn
that the famous Muybridge photos
were first shown, the result of Mr.
Stanford's curiosity about the posi
tion of a horse's legs in action. A
monument, not far from the present
oval, commemorates this event,
which produced a result not unlike
present motion pictures.
The tradition of Stanford horse
manship and love of fine horses is
being revived in a setting which is
full of memories of one of the most
colorful features of the early days
of Stanford when fine horses —
champion trotters, blue-blood stal
lions and mares—made the name of
Stanford as famous in the field of
horsemanship and trotting competi
tion as it was in the fields of edu
cation and government.

In the historic setting of the oak-tree shaded acreage adjoining the Old Red Barn, Stanford stu
dents are learning the A, B, C's of horsemanship, and the advanced students, riding and jumping
like veterans of the show ring, are getting down the alphabet of equestrian knowledge.
More than 60 students, men and women, are taking part in the riding program which was
revived at Stanford in September of 1946 when Mr. and Mrs. Allen Ross came to campus to

revive the art of Stanford horse
manship at the Old Red Barn, where
Senator Leland Stanic«d once bred
and trained the trotters and other
thoroughbreds which carried the
Stanford colors.
new equipment
The Rosses brought 35 horses and
complete equipment for both west
ern and English style riding, and
opened the stable facilities to stu
dents and faculty alike, as well as
to friends of the university.
The eight-month program of in
struction which they have directed
is paying off now in the skills of
Stanford men and coeds alike, who
arc jumping hurdles and handling
their horses with the firm but gen
tle skill which comes to riders only
through experience and expert train
ing.
'the riding program is part of the
physical education curriculum and
open to all students for a $45 a
quarter equitation fee which enti
tles them to ride twice a week and
receive instruction in six classes
which run throughout the week.
The riding meets lower division
physical education requirements
and counts as credit for juniors and
seniors.
RIDING SINCE CHILDHOOD
Mr. Ross, who has been connected
with riding since he was 16 and
whose wife, Mrs. Patti Ross was
Stanford coed in the class of 1940,
points out that riding fee is much
less than any student would pay
for similar facilities in any private
riding stables on the Peninsula, as
is the casual riding fee of $1.50 an
hour open to anyone connected with
the university. All that is required
for students or faculty to make use
of the horses is a reservation which
can be made by telephoning Palo
Alto 2-5713. Boarding facilities for
horses are available at the stable.
Only restriction on persons out
side the university family making
use of the facilities is that they must
he accompanied on the ride by a
student or faculty member.
Expert horsewomen of the ad
vancde class include Paula Jones,
Margaret Carol Slater, Anne Stick
ney, Edith Magee and Joan Clay.
Several of them have taken the rid
ing courses more than once.
Among the horsemen who are
making rapid progress in riding
skill are Philip Roos, Don Beeman,
Henry Bernstein and Robert Mc-
Cann.
I I N WHILE LEARNING
The Aliens emphasize informality
and fun in their instruction, and
there is little of the top nit, ion v.
red hunting coat approach to their
style of teaching. Jeans are as com
mon riding wear as jodphurs or rid
ing trousers, and the emphasis is on
learning how to ride properly rather !
than looking pretty while you do it,
the Rosses point out.
The instruction is thorough, how
ever. The beginning student learns
first to ride and saddle his own horse.
He learns how a horse should be
cared for, as well as the proper
form in his chosn type of riding,
either western or English.
Instruction is given partly in a

ring which is now being covored
with the traditional tanbark of
horse show rings, or in the oval
which lies between the fairways of
the Stanford golf course, and the
rest of the time is spent riding over
the campus or in the hills back of

RIDING SINCE CHILDHOOD
Mr. Ross, who has been connected
with riding since he was 16 and
whose wife, Mrs. Patti Ross was
Stanford coed in the class of 1940,
points out that riding fee is much
less than any student would pay
for similar facilities in any private
riding stables on the Peninsula, as
is the casual riding fee of $1.50 an
hour open to anyone connected with
the university. All that is required
for students or faculty to make use
of the horses is a reservation which
can be made by telephoning Palo
Alto 2-5713. Boarding facilities for
horses are available at the stable.
Only restriction on persons out
side the university family making
use of the facilities is that they must
he accompanied on the ride by a
student or faculty member.
Expert horsewomen of the ad
vancde class include Paula Jones,
Margaret Carol Slater, Anne Stick
ney, Edith Magee and Joan Clay.
Several of them have taken the rid
ing courses more than once.
Among the horsemen who are
making rapid progress in riding
skill are Philip Roos, Don Beeman,
Henry Bernstein and Robert Mc-
Cann.
I I N WHILE LEARNING
The Aliens emphasize informality
and fun in their instruction, and
there is little of the top nit, ion v.
red hunting coat approach to their
style of teaching. Jeans are as com
mon riding wear as jodphurs or rid
ing trousers, and the emphasis is on
learning how to ride properly rather !
than looking pretty while you do it,
the Rosses point out.
The instruction is thorough, how
ever. The beginning student learns
first to ride and saddle his own horse.
He learns how a horse should be
cared for, as well as the proper
form in his chosn type of riding,
either western or English.
Instruction is given partly in a

ring which is now being covored
with the traditional tanbark of
horse show rings, or in the oval
which lies between the fairways of
the Stanford golf course, and the
rest of the time is spent riding over
the campus or in the hills back of
the university.
The intermediate students get
more advanced instruction in the
fundamentals with which they be
come acquainted as beginner, and
spend a good deal of time outside
of the ring, and begin drills on
horseback.
The advanced student gets into
jumping, as well as "stick and ball,"
which is an adaptation of polo.
Western style riders learn tricks of
roping and packing which will come
in handy on pack trips. Both west
ern and English style students do
drilling on horseback.
LONG HISTORY
The revival of interest in horse
manship is in keeping with the tra
ditions of the Old Red Barn, which
was part of the Palo Alto Stock Farm
which Senator Stanford purchased
in 187(5.
At one time there were more than
75 trotting horses in training daily
at the farm, and more than 20 stal
lions and 300 mares.
Eighty men were employed on the
farm, not counting blacksmiths, Chi
nese laborers, harness makers, and
ranch hands.
A mile track as well as a three
quarter track were maintained and

an open training paddock about a
tenth of a mile in circumference,
and a covered paddock for use in
rainy weather.
FIRST MOVIES
It was in a loft of Ihe Red Barn
that the famous Muybridge photos
were first shown, the result of Mr.
Stanford's curiosity about the posi
tion of a horse's legs in action. A
monument, not far from the present
oval, commemorates this event,
which produced a result not unlike
present motion pictures.
The tradition of Stanford horse
manship and love of fine horses is
being revived in a setting which is
full of memories of one of the most
colorful features of the early days
of Stanford when fine horses —
champion trotters, blue-blood stal
lions and mares—made the name of
Stanford as famous in the field of
horsemanship and trotting competi
tion as it was in the fields of edu
cation and government.

In the historic setting of the oak-tree shaded acreage adjoining the Old Red Barn, Stanford stu
dents are learning the A, B, C's of horsemanship, and the advanced students, riding and jumping
like veterans of the show ring, are getting down the alphabet of equestrian knowledge.
More than 60 students, men and women, are taking part in the riding program which was
revived at Stanford in September of 1946 when Mr. and Mrs. Allen Ross came to campus to

revive the art of Stanford horse
manship at the Old Red Barn, where
Senator Leland Stanic«d once bred
and trained the trotters and other
thoroughbreds which carried the
Stanford colors.
new equipment
The Rosses brought 35 horses and
complete equipment for both west
ern and English style riding, and
opened the stable facilities to stu
dents and faculty alike, as well as
to friends of the university.
The eight-month program of in
struction which they have directed
is paying off now in the skills of
Stanford men and coeds alike, who
arc jumping hurdles and handling
their horses with the firm but gen
tle skill which comes to riders only
through experience and expert train
ing.
'the riding program is part of the
physical education curriculum and
open to all students for a $45 a
quarter equitation fee which enti
tles them to ride twice a week and
receive instruction in six classes
which run throughout the week.
