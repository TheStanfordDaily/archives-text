# Activities Agency Now in Operation; To Co-ordinate Students and Groups
## 
### 
To benefit both committee chair
men and individual students is the
aim of the Activities' Agency now :
in operation, according to Cam San- i
ders, vice-chairman of the agency, j
Four-thousand students have cards |
on file listing their experience and I
willingness to work. Forty-nine or
ganizations are also listed who need
help from time to time. "Practically
every independent organization on
campus that many people do not
â€¢ veil know the existence of have con
tacted us," Miss Sanders said.
The agency's aim is not to inter- ]
fere with the clubs, but to suggest |
appointments. "We just help the !
tudents and clubs get together, and |
Jet them go on from there," Miss j
Sanders continued.
The agency has many plans. They
are now working on the Frosh Bible,
together with Publications Council.
"We want it to become similar to
ihe Harvard Handbook with maybe
not such a permanent cover, but
with more content inside. We want
to include all activities that Fresh
men can enter. We want to make
it more or less an indoctrination
course into Stanford," the said.
Thoy also hope to initiate a coun
seling service for transfers who come
late into the school and never are
told of the ideals, the background,
Ihe traditions of Stanford.
They plan to send out a form at
Ihe end of the year asking sugges
tions and ideas for the agency.
"We're just in the experimental
stage and welcome any suggestion,"
she continued.
Their main problem now is lack
of an office. They have been forced

i they are hard to get at. They aren't
| able to have office hours, and it is
I hard for committees to get in touch
I with Ihe three heads of the agency.
"We want to emphasize (hat the
| agency is now ready for business.
I Any organization needing willing
I people to work can call on us," Miss
Sanders urged.
Gordon Johnson and Jean Strong
are co-chairmen of the agency.
