# Indian Nine Hands USC First League Defeat, 6-5
## 
### LYNN CARMAN 
The up-again, down-again boys—the Indian diamond performers—turned the Stanford-South
ern California ball »ame here into a three-ring circus in the fifth inning last Saturday, making
the Irojans look like clowns for about fifteen minutes, and when the inning's act was over the
Indians had fashioned themselves a precious two run lead which held up during the remaining
frames as the Indians toppled the here-to-fore unbeaten Trojans, 6 to 5.
All the Indians asked for was an even break in the ball game, which they got; but then they

went out and made a few of their
breaks, and that was just a mite
more than the Trojans hud bargained
for.
WALK IT CUTS OFF RUNS
For instance, in Ihe first inning,
the Trojans opened up full blast
on the first few pitches with three
consecutive power blows, one of
them a double, but Indian catcher
Ward Wulkup went the Trojans one
"better and threw two of them out
at second with two clothesline strikes
to stomp out the lire before it could
get started.
Walkup's two perfect throws,
coming when they did, unsettled the
visitors and set them up for the
Sunday punch in the fifth frame.
And what's more important, his
pegs put the Indians back into a
winning frame of mind after it had
begun to look as if they had wasted
their time in coming to the ball
park.
TBI) NELL A STANDOUT
In the wake of the triumph,
Walkup and outfielder Ted Nell
have to be given the accolade as
the pair most responsible for the
Farm win. The two Indian ball
players were in S.C.'s hair all af
ternoon, beginning with Walkup's
timely throws in ihe first.
By the time the game was over,
the twosome had batted in and
scored three runs, collected three
singles and a double, and pulled a
squeeze play after a successful
steal to third.
Both of them made errors which
cost the Indians a total of three
runs, but that was incidental as the
pair led the way in the Indian up
rising.
Starting pitcher Dave Dahle, and
Larry Wolf, who relieved Dahle in
the seventh and held the fort by
striking out? four men in three in
nings, were nicked for nine hits,
but only two of the Trojan runs
were earned.
WILD AND WOOLY GAME
It was a bitter, back-and-forth
struggle all the way, and it wasn't
until Card second-baseman Bob
Peters scooped up a ground ball
and threw to Cardinalli for .the
final out that the wild-and-wooly
game was finally decided.
For four innings it was a matter
of the Trojans getting a one-run
lead only to have the Indians come
back to tie it up in the next. Twice
that happened, and (hen the fifth
inning opened, with the two teams
all tied up at 2-2.
When the firing had ceased in that
merry-go-round frame, six runs
had crossed the plate on four errors
and the Trojans had gained, and
promptly lost, a two-run lead.
TROJANS TAKE LEAD
The visitors got their break in
their half when, with Jim Brideweser
Archie Wilson's perlect force-out
on first and two out, Peters muffed
ball and the two Trojans wound up
on first and second. Gordon Jone;
took advantage of the boot to line a
single into left field, but Nell got
tangled up and the ball went through
him; Brideweser and Wilson both
came all the way home as S.C. went
into the lead for the third time. 4-2.
Doug Essick, the Trojans' hurling
ace, picked the last of the fifth to
go into a tumbling act, and that was
all the Indians were waiting for.
Dahle led off with a single. When
Bill Arce followed with a neat sac
rifice bunt. Essick heaved the ball
into right field and Dahle went to
second.
PITCHER ESSICK BALKS
1 hat rattled Essick; lie got him
self further inlo a jam by balking

and both runners advanced a base.
George Sloat hit a slow roller be
tween the mound and first, but
Essick couldn't reach it and fell
down as Dahle scored.
The Trojan hurler managed to
whiff Brownson, but Lloyd Merri
man tagged him for a long fly to
center and Arce came in. That left
Sloat on first, with two out, and the
score tied up again.
Walkup hit a high popup, and the
raliy seemed to be over—but Buddy
Pennell dropped the ball. He made
matters worse by throwing it over
to third, where the ball hit a pebble
and went right on by the Trojan
third baseman. Sloat ended up on
third and Walkup on second.
That was the final break, and Nell
made ii count by cracking a single
past the in-playing right fielder to
score two more runs and put Stan
ford into the lead for the first time

in the game, 6-4.
INDIANS lIOLD LEAD
After that, it was a question of
holding the margin, and the Indians
did. But they had quite a time do
ing it.
In the sixth, the Trojans maneu
vered men onto first and third when
Arce hobbled a line drive on a hit
and-run play with two out, but the
next man hit into an easy force-out
play.
Again in the seventh, the visitors
got men to first and second with none
out on a walk and another error by
Arce. Coach Harry Wolter replaced
Dahle with Wolf at that point. Wolf
g<it by the first man on a foul out,
but Hank Workman singled to drive
in a run and put men on first and
third.
WOLF BEARS DOWN
It was pay-day for the Trojans,
; but Wolf short-changed them and
! set the next two men to face him
down on strikes.
Wolf breezed through the eighth,
but in the ninth Southern California
made a last bid.
Workman walked on a 3-2 pitch
with one out. Wolf struck out the
next man on three straight pitches,
only to'have Workman put the tieing
run on second on a steal. Pennell
ended the game, though, on an "easy
grounder to Peters.
Both teams got nine hits, and
Stanford made six errors to S.C.'s
four, but the Indians won the ball
game and that's all that mattered.

vered men onto first and third when
Arce hobbled a line drive on a hit
and-run play with two out, but the
next man hit into an easy force-out
play.
Again in the seventh, the visitors
got men to first and second with none
out on a walk and another error by
Arce. Coach Harry Wolter replaced
Dahle with Wolf at that point. Wolf
g<it by the first man on a foul out,
but Hank Workman singled to drive
in a run and put men on first and
third.
WOLF BEARS DOWN
It was pay-day for the Trojans,
; but Wolf short-changed them and
! set the next two men to face him
down on strikes.
Wolf breezed through the eighth,
but in the ninth Southern California
made a last bid.
Workman walked on a 3-2 pitch
with one out. Wolf struck out the
next man on three straight pitches,
only to'have Workman put the tieing
run on second on a steal. Pennell
ended the game, though, on an "easy
grounder to Peters.
Both teams got nine hits, and
Stanford made six errors to S.C.'s
four, but the Indians won the ball
game and that's all that mattered.


CATCHER WARD WALKUP,
husky Stanford mittman whose
Hj* bat played an important rede
as the locals stunned the C.S.C.
haseballt-rs, G-5, last Saturday.
The up-again, down-again boys—the Indian diamond performers—turned the Stanford-South
ern California ball »ame here into a three-ring circus in the fifth inning last Saturday, making
the Irojans look like clowns for about fifteen minutes, and when the inning's act was over the
Indians had fashioned themselves a precious two run lead which held up during the remaining
frames as the Indians toppled the here-to-fore unbeaten Trojans, 6 to 5.
All the Indians asked for was an even break in the ball game, which they got; but then they

went out and made a few of their
breaks, and that was just a mite
more than the Trojans hud bargained
for.
WALK IT CUTS OFF RUNS
For instance, in Ihe first inning,
the Trojans opened up full blast
on the first few pitches with three
consecutive power blows, one of
them a double, but Indian catcher
Ward Wulkup went the Trojans one
"better and threw two of them out
at second with two clothesline strikes
to stomp out the lire before it could
get started.
Walkup's two perfect throws,
coming when they did, unsettled the
visitors and set them up for the
Sunday punch in the fifth frame.
And what's more important, his
pegs put the Indians back into a
winning frame of mind after it had
begun to look as if they had wasted
their time in coming to the ball
park.
TBI) NELL A STANDOUT
In the wake of the triumph,
Walkup and outfielder Ted Nell
have to be given the accolade as
the pair most responsible for the
Farm win. The two Indian ball
players were in S.C.'s hair all af
ternoon, beginning with Walkup's
timely throws in ihe first.
By the time the game was over,
the twosome had batted in and
scored three runs, collected three
singles and a double, and pulled a
squeeze play after a successful
steal to third.
Both of them made errors which
cost the Indians a total of three
runs, but that was incidental as the
pair led the way in the Indian up
rising.
Starting pitcher Dave Dahle, and
Larry Wolf, who relieved Dahle in
the seventh and held the fort by
striking out? four men in three in
nings, were nicked for nine hits,
but only two of the Trojan runs
were earned.
WILD AND WOOLY GAME
It was a bitter, back-and-forth
struggle all the way, and it wasn't
until Card second-baseman Bob
Peters scooped up a ground ball
and threw to Cardinalli for .the
final out that the wild-and-wooly
game was finally decided.
For four innings it was a matter
of the Trojans getting a one-run
lead only to have the Indians come
back to tie it up in the next. Twice
that happened, and (hen the fifth
inning opened, with the two teams
all tied up at 2-2.
When the firing had ceased in that
merry-go-round frame, six runs
had crossed the plate on four errors
and the Trojans had gained, and
promptly lost, a two-run lead.
TROJANS TAKE LEAD
The visitors got their break in
their half when, with Jim Brideweser
Archie Wilson's perlect force-out
on first and two out, Peters muffed
ball and the two Trojans wound up
on first and second. Gordon Jone;
took advantage of the boot to line a
single into left field, but Nell got
tangled up and the ball went through
him; Brideweser and Wilson both
came all the way home as S.C. went
into the lead for the third time. 4-2.
Doug Essick, the Trojans' hurling
ace, picked the last of the fifth to
go into a tumbling act, and that was
all the Indians were waiting for.
Dahle led off with a single. When
Bill Arce followed with a neat sac
rifice bunt. Essick heaved the ball
into right field and Dahle went to
second.
PITCHER ESSICK BALKS
1 hat rattled Essick; lie got him
self further inlo a jam by balking

and both runners advanced a base.
George Sloat hit a slow roller be
tween the mound and first, but
Essick couldn't reach it and fell
down as Dahle scored.
The Trojan hurler managed to
whiff Brownson, but Lloyd Merri
man tagged him for a long fly to
center and Arce came in. That left
Sloat on first, with two out, and the
score tied up again.
Walkup hit a high popup, and the
raliy seemed to be over—but Buddy
Pennell dropped the ball. He made
matters worse by throwing it over
to third, where the ball hit a pebble
and went right on by the Trojan
third baseman. Sloat ended up on
third and Walkup on second.
That was the final break, and Nell
made ii count by cracking a single
past the in-playing right fielder to
score two more runs and put Stan
ford into the lead for the first time

in the game, 6-4.
INDIANS lIOLD LEAD
After that, it was a question of
holding the margin, and the Indians
did. But they had quite a time do
ing it.
In the sixth, the Trojans maneu
vered men onto first and third when
Arce hobbled a line drive on a hit

rifice bunt. Essick heaved the ball
into right field and Dahle went to
second.
PITCHER ESSICK BALKS
1 hat rattled Essick; lie got him
self further inlo a jam by balking

and both runners advanced a base.
George Sloat hit a slow roller be
tween the mound and first, but
Essick couldn't reach it and fell
down as Dahle scored.
The Trojan hurler managed to
whiff Brownson, but Lloyd Merri
man tagged him for a long fly to
center and Arce came in. That left
Sloat on first, with two out, and the
score tied up again.
Walkup hit a high popup, and the
raliy seemed to be over—but Buddy
Pennell dropped the ball. He made
matters worse by throwing it over
to third, where the ball hit a pebble
and went right on by the Trojan
third baseman. Sloat ended up on
third and Walkup on second.
That was the final break, and Nell
made ii count by cracking a single
past the in-playing right fielder to
score two more runs and put Stan
ford into the lead for the first time

in the game, 6-4.
INDIANS lIOLD LEAD
After that, it was a question of
holding the margin, and the Indians
did. But they had quite a time do
ing it.
In the sixth, the Trojans maneu
vered men onto first and third when
Arce hobbled a line drive on a hit
and-run play with two out, but the
next man hit into an easy force-out
play.
Again in the seventh, the visitors
got men to first and second with none
out on a walk and another error by
Arce. Coach Harry Wolter replaced
Dahle with Wolf at that point. Wolf
g<it by the first man on a foul out,
but Hank Workman singled to drive
in a run and put men on first and
third.
WOLF BEARS DOWN
It was pay-day for the Trojans,
; but Wolf short-changed them and
! set the next two men to face him
down on strikes.
Wolf breezed through the eighth,
but in the ninth Southern California
made a last bid.
Workman walked on a 3-2 pitch
with one out. Wolf struck out the
next man on three straight pitches,
only to'have Workman put the tieing
run on second on a steal. Pennell
ended the game, though, on an "easy
grounder to Peters.
Both teams got nine hits, and
Stanford made six errors to S.C.'s
four, but the Indians won the ball
game and that's all that mattered.


CATCHER WARD WALKUP,
husky Stanford mittman whose
Hj* bat played an important rede
as the locals stunned the C.S.C.
haseballt-rs, G-5, last Saturday.
The up-again, down-again boys—the Indian diamond performers—turned the Stanford-South
ern California ball »ame here into a three-ring circus in the fifth inning last Saturday, making
the Irojans look like clowns for about fifteen minutes, and when the inning's act was over the
Indians had fashioned themselves a precious two run lead which held up during the remaining
frames as the Indians toppled the here-to-fore unbeaten Trojans, 6 to 5.
All the Indians asked for was an even break in the ball game, which they got; but then they

went out and made a few of their
breaks, and that was just a mite
more than the Trojans hud bargained
for.
WALK IT CUTS OFF RUNS
For instance, in Ihe first inning,
the Trojans opened up full blast
on the first few pitches with three
consecutive power blows, one of
them a double, but Indian catcher
Ward Wulkup went the Trojans one
"better and threw two of them out
at second with two clothesline strikes
to stomp out the lire before it could
get started.
Walkup's two perfect throws,
coming when they did, unsettled the
visitors and set them up for the
Sunday punch in the fifth frame.
And what's more important, his
pegs put the Indians back into a
winning frame of mind after it had
begun to look as if they had wasted
their time in coming to the ball
park.
TBI) NELL A STANDOUT
In the wake of the triumph,
Walkup and outfielder Ted Nell
have to be given the accolade as
the pair most responsible for the
Farm win. The two Indian ball
players were in S.C.'s hair all af
ternoon, beginning with Walkup's
timely throws in ihe first.
By the time the game was over,
the twosome had batted in and
scored three runs, collected three
singles and a double, and pulled a
squeeze play after a successful
steal to third.
Both of them made errors which
cost the Indians a total of three
runs, but that was incidental as the
pair led the way in the Indian up
rising.
Starting pitcher Dave Dahle, and
Larry Wolf, who relieved Dahle in
the seventh and held the fort by
striking out? four men in three in
nings, were nicked for nine hits,
but only two of the Trojan runs
were earned.
WILD AND WOOLY GAME
It was a bitter, back-and-forth
struggle all the way, and it wasn't
until Card second-baseman Bob
Peters scooped up a ground ball
and threw to Cardinalli for .the
final out that the wild-and-wooly
game was finally decided.
For four innings it was a matter
of the Trojans getting a one-run
lead only to have the Indians come
back to tie it up in the next. Twice
that happened, and (hen the fifth
inning opened, with the two teams
all tied up at 2-2.
When the firing had ceased in that
merry-go-round frame, six runs
had crossed the plate on four errors
and the Trojans had gained, and
promptly lost, a two-run lead.
TROJANS TAKE LEAD
The visitors got their break in
their half when, with Jim Brideweser
Archie Wilson's perlect force-out
on first and two out, Peters muffed
ball and the two Trojans wound up
on first and second. Gordon Jone;
took advantage of the boot to line a
single into left field, but Nell got
tangled up and the ball went through
him; Brideweser and Wilson both
came all the way home as S.C. went
into the lead for the third time. 4-2.
Doug Essick, the Trojans' hurling
ace, picked the last of the fifth to
go into a tumbling act, and that was
all the Indians were waiting for.
Dahle led off with a single. When
Bill Arce followed with a neat sac
rifice bunt. Essick heaved the ball
into right field and Dahle went to
second.

until Card second-baseman Bob
Peters scooped up a ground ball
and threw to Cardinalli for .the
final out that the wild-and-wooly
game was finally decided.
For four innings it was a matter
of the Trojans getting a one-run
lead only to have the Indians come
back to tie it up in the next. Twice
that happened, and (hen the fifth
inning opened, with the two teams
all tied up at 2-2.
When the firing had ceased in that
merry-go-round frame, six runs
had crossed the plate on four errors
and the Trojans had gained, and
promptly lost, a two-run lead.
TROJANS TAKE LEAD
The visitors got their break in
their half when, with Jim Brideweser
Archie Wilson's perlect force-out
on first and two out, Peters muffed
ball and the two Trojans wound up
on first and second. Gordon Jone;
took advantage of the boot to line a
single into left field, but Nell got
tangled up and the ball went through
him; Brideweser and Wilson both
came all the way home as S.C. went
into the lead for the third time. 4-2.
Doug Essick, the Trojans' hurling
ace, picked the last of the fifth to
go into a tumbling act, and that was
all the Indians were waiting for.
Dahle led off with a single. When
Bill Arce followed with a neat sac
rifice bunt. Essick heaved the ball
into right field and Dahle went to
second.
PITCHER ESSICK BALKS
1 hat rattled Essick; lie got him
self further inlo a jam by balking

and both runners advanced a base.
George Sloat hit a slow roller be
tween the mound and first, but
Essick couldn't reach it and fell
down as Dahle scored.
The Trojan hurler managed to
whiff Brownson, but Lloyd Merri
man tagged him for a long fly to
center and Arce came in. That left
Sloat on first, with two out, and the
score tied up again.
Walkup hit a high popup, and the
raliy seemed to be over—but Buddy
Pennell dropped the ball. He made
matters worse by throwing it over
to third, where the ball hit a pebble
and went right on by the Trojan
third baseman. Sloat ended up on
third and Walkup on second.
That was the final break, and Nell
made ii count by cracking a single
past the in-playing right fielder to
score two more runs and put Stan
ford into the lead for the first time

in the game, 6-4.
INDIANS lIOLD LEAD
After that, it was a question of
holding the margin, and the Indians
did. But they had quite a time do
ing it.
In the sixth, the Trojans maneu
vered men onto first and third when
Arce hobbled a line drive on a hit
and-run play with two out, but the
next man hit into an easy force-out
play.
Again in the seventh, the visitors
got men to first and second with none
out on a walk and another error by
Arce. Coach Harry Wolter replaced
Dahle with Wolf at that point. Wolf
g<it by the first man on a foul out,
but Hank Workman singled to drive
in a run and put men on first and
third.
WOLF BEARS DOWN
It was pay-day for the Trojans,
; but Wolf short-changed them and
! set the next two men to face him
down on strikes.
Wolf breezed through the eighth,
but in the ninth Southern California
made a last bid.
Workman walked on a 3-2 pitch
with one out. Wolf struck out the
next man on three straight pitches,
only to'have Workman put the tieing
run on second on a steal. Pennell
ended the game, though, on an "easy
grounder to Peters.
Both teams got nine hits, and
Stanford made six errors to S.C.'s
four, but the Indians won the ball
game and that's all that mattered.
