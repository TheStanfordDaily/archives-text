# Rifle Team Organizes

### 
The Stanford rifle team, inactive j
since 194.5, is once again calling for |
prospective sharpshooters interested
in firing gallery matches. Interested
persons are urged to contact Ed
Koriick at 214 Toyon. No previous
experience is necessary.
Challenges for shoulder-to-shoul
der matches have been received i
from California, U.S.F., and San j
Mateo J.C. Minor sports awards I
will be given to qualifying team
members.
Before the war, the rifle team
played an important role in the
Stanford sporting scene, firing
matches against California, U.C.-
L.A., and other Pacific Coast col
leges.
In February, a few students got
together and entered a team in the
National Intercollegiate Tourna- j
merit. The team showed definite j
promise, despite inadequate facili- j
ties and lack of practice.
The range was formerly located
in th r ! basement of the Administra
tion Building. Because of crowded
conditions, it was found necessary to
move it to the R.O.T.C. area where
a range has been devised from one
of the stable buildings.
