# S.C. Trackmen Win
## 
### TOM BURDICK 
Two Indian Unknowns," hurdler Dell Russell and 2-miler
Gordy Johnson accounted for the only two clear-cut Stanford
wins, as the potent cindermen from the University of Southern
California captured an easy 94 3 /4 to 3GVa track victory last Sat
urday afternoon on the Angell Field Oval. Bill Larson, top

Indian pole vaulter, cleared an even
I.{ ft. to figure in a four way tie
for first with Hart, Sunders and
Wolfe of the Trojans for the other
top Indian performance.
Although the mighty men of Troy
swept only one event, the high
jump, overall depth enabled them
to take firsts and seconds in the mile,
440, shot put, broad jump and low
hurdles.
JOHNSON RUNS GREAT 2-MILE
After Roland Sink, the Trojans'
bi illiant distance act who had cop
ped the mile in the excellent time
of 4:16 flat earlier in the day, had
been withdrawn and Art Nash, sec
ond ranking Troy leather-lunger had
dropped out due to a log muscle in
jury after three laps, the 2-mile race
developed into a battle between
Johnson and John Cherry of the
visitors. Johnson's closing sprint
just did carry him past his oppon
ent by a whisker as the junior trans
fer from M.I.T. registered his fast
est time of the season—9:ss.9.
Dell Russell, the Inter-Alfied
games high hurdle champ in Berlin
in 194(5, pulled the other Indian sur
prise of (he day, outsprinting the
favorites, Captain A 1 Snyder and
Trojan Lou Futrell to the tape in
a 14.9 high barrier effort.
WIND HAMPERS PATTON
A sharp gusty wind which blew
intermittently cut down consider
ably the times of the dashes and
hurdles. Mel Patton, who was shoot
ing lor near-record performances in
the 100 and 220 was clocked in 9.8
and 21.2 seconds respectively. Hubie
Korns served notice that he may be
returning to his pre-war form, by
flashing by teammate Wells DeLoach
to take (he 440 in 48.3. Franklin
Johnson finished third for Stanford.
Trojan Bob Chambers led prac

tieally from start to finish 1o emerge
the easy half mile winner in :f)4.8.
George Grimes, Indian middle-dis
tance ace, put on a terrific sprint
which easily collared Troy's Wilson
but was too late to catch the long
striding Chambers. Al Holubar
closed well for third.
TROY SWEEPS 11 Kill JUMP
Although Troy's high jumping trio
ol Follis, Wakefield and Newman
had little trouble taking their event
with a three way tie at 6 ft. 4' j in.,
Stanford picked up a few points in
the field events with Held and Co
lter's and third in the jave
lin. and McKee's second in the
discus.
Despite the overwhelming score,
Stanford's track team, as a whole,
showed a marked improvement over
its performances of the last two
weeks against the Olympic Club and
San Jose State. Although he placed
third, Frank Ganahl ran a 4:21 mile,
the fastest time of his career.
George Grimes, although he has
not won a race in his last three
starts, has been turning in some
remarkable times in the 880 and will
be heard from before the season
ends.
Next Saturday, May 2, the Indians
meet the U.C.L.A. Bruins on the
Westwood oval. The Cards stand an
excellent chance of taking this dual
meet on the basis of Saturday's per
formance against the Trojans.
Last Satruday, the Bruins defeat
ed Cal at Berkeley and scored an
upset in the process.
