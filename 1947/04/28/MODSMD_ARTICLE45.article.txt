## This Is Your Charity 
### 
"Con Home Week" has begun.
During the next five days the Stanford stu
dent body will have a chance to aid sixty
convalescent children living at the Con Home
on campus.
The annual Drive will feature a Strawberry
Brunch, Labor Day at the home, a Sophomore
Carnival, and the Con Home dance. The
opportunity to support and participate in this
charity is given to every student.
Twenty-five years ago Stanford undertook
the first Convalescent Home Drive. Since
that time the Farm has adopted the Home as
"Stanford's own charity."
In 1917, under the leadership of Dr. D.
Charles Gardner, a summer home for children
was founded on the campus by interested
students, and in 1919 it was converted into a

home for convalescent children of bay area
and peninsula residents. The parents of these
children pay what they can to the home. The
remainder of the expenses are donated through
charity drives.
This week solicitors will contact students to
ask for donations for the Convalescent Home.
However, the committee organizing the drive
v/ants more than monetary contributions.
Wednesday every student will have a chance
to visit the Home, see the children, and under
stand for themselves the work that is accom
plished there.
This is a charity that Stanford founded, has
continued to support, and that needs your aid
today. The Con Home is as much a part of
the campus as the Quad. Participation in this
drive is your chance to help maintain an ac
tive, worthy tradition of the University.â€”M.S.
