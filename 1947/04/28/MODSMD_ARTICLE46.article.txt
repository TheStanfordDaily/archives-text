It's not the world that's mad; its the people in it.
And Stanford has bad its share of characters.
Doodles Weaver, of course, tops the list. And be
fore taking on other characters, let's review some
of his infamous episodes. First there was the dedi
cation of a statue of a famous educator. The statue
was draped, to be unveiled after dedication speeches.
When the rope was pulled, there was Doodles in the
famous man's arms, smoking a cigar.
Another time Doodles wagered he could drive to
L.A. in six hours. His timer tired a gun, started his
stop watch, and Doodles reared down Lasuen. He
failed to make the bookstore corner and rolled his
car. Undaunted he climbed from the wreckage,
brushed himself off, promptly hailed a passing car.
To the thunderstruck driver, Doodles shouted, '"Los
Angeles, and step on it."
Another Weaver trick was to barricade the main
campus roads about lock-out time. He knew a large
percentage of "parkers" would stretch out those last
minutes, then race home. When they came to a bar
ricade, the drivers, without exception backed up, tried
the other road. Finding it blocked too, turned
back once more. When it finally occurred To them to
get out and simply move the road block, it was too
late. Some historians say Doodles received a com-

mission from the cai}dy sellers and florists for his
dirty work.
Another character, an SAE I believe, hated to
get out of bed for eight o'clocks. So one day he just
pulled his sheet around him, Ghandi style, and
stomped off to class. He got such a boot out of it
he went to all classes thusly attired. Naturally pro
fessors began to object to the sideshow competition
to their lectures. One finally ejected him from the
class. So subsequently the sheeted one climbed up on
the skylight and gave the professor the bronx cheer
during his lectures.
The veracity of all these tales I can't vouch for;
they're good reading anyway. But the guy who
told them to me was the biggest character of all. He
wore a blue chambray combination shirt, navy uni
form, white duck trousers, and a straw hat. He loved
to play pool but had a terrific handicapâ€”he could
only see half the length of the pool table, no matter
how hard he squinted. To get a shot a table length
away he'd walk around, judge the position of the
ball, haul off and shoot by dead reckoning, usually
missing it a country mile. But on close shots he was
a deadeye. He was a good egg though, never seemed
to catch on that we deliberately snookered him by
putting the ball out of his sight.
