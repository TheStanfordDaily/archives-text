### CECIL ROSPAW 
During this last week an important case, to some
30,000 Mexican-Americ .ns at least, was decided in
the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
The Federal Court decision was in favor of 10
Mexican residents of Orange County, California who
had originally appealed in local courts against the
discrimination practiced in that county by educa
tional institutions.
Supreme and lower court decisions have taken
on the meaning of law in many recent test cases.
Witness the recent Mt. Clemens Pottery Case which,
unless Congressional action outlaws it. will upset our
whole industrial structure on the question of portal
to-portal pay.
Upheld by the Supreme Court, which it probably
will be, and given the power of law, this case, known
locally as the "Westminster Case,'' may well be the
foundation stone for a completely new outlook on
the problem of minority segregation and education
in the United States.
The peculiar situation which brought about this
latest stand on the segregation issue is a purely local
situation, but one which is synonymous with many
other localities throughout the country.
With the growth of the citrus and agricultural
industries in the Orange County region cheap labor
was needed. Year alter year Mexican citizens were
invited to immigrate to, or heard of the demand and
came to, the district. The labor market was soon
overcrowded.
Language difficulties were encountered and edu
cational facilities were taxed. Separate schools were
set up for the children born of Mexican parents, but
American citizens with language as their only tie
with the old country.
Under an old Supreme Court decision, which
hedged the discrimination issue by ruling that as long
as "equal privileges" were granted to minority
groups the intent of the 14th amendment would be

carried out, discrimination has plodded on down to
the present time.
Although the equal privileges ruling could be a
panacea in areas of minority population, the pro
vision has been violated time and time again. Schools,
an important safeguard of democracy, are not kept
up to standards. As a rule the minority institutions
are old, run-down, and catch-alls for young inex
perienced instructors, or the bitter old maids left
over on district tenure.
The ten families who originally appealed to the
courts in 1844 from this particular district did so
mainly because of the lack of good facilities for
their children, and because the laws of California
did not uphold segregation of Mexican-American
Citizens.
The opinion which was rendered with the latest
decision was unanimous. The justices denounced the
practice of segregation as a "vicious principle ' and
maintained that in this district it was operating in
violation of the 14th amendment. They said that
School Board trustees who allowed the practice were
violating their oaths of office and were liable.
The discussion of this decision will continue for
years. The national implications will be slowly un
derstood as the years go by, and it will be years be
fore the implied reforms are carried out.
The "Pachuco Wars," which occurred in Los An
geles in May, 1943, when dissatisfied Mexican young
sters wore strange clothes and engaged in fights with
service men, who also wanted to let off excess nerv
ous energy, were almost a direct result of the present
school system.
In this one district it will be interesting to watch
and see how much the tension will abate in relation
to number of reforms carried out. The storm, which
is building now, might be avoided, and the example
might be taken and used in other parts of the country
where minorities present the same problems.

cational facilities were taxed. Separate schools were
set up for the children born of Mexican parents, but
American citizens with language as their only tie
with the old country.
Under an old Supreme Court decision, which
hedged the discrimination issue by ruling that as long
as "equal privileges" were granted to minority
groups the intent of the 14th amendment would be

carried out, discrimination has plodded on down to
the present time.
Although the equal privileges ruling could be a
panacea in areas of minority population, the pro
vision has been violated time and time again. Schools,
an important safeguard of democracy, are not kept
up to standards. As a rule the minority institutions
are old, run-down, and catch-alls for young inex
perienced instructors, or the bitter old maids left
over on district tenure.
The ten families who originally appealed to the
courts in 1844 from this particular district did so
mainly because of the lack of good facilities for
their children, and because the laws of California
did not uphold segregation of Mexican-American
Citizens.
The opinion which was rendered with the latest
decision was unanimous. The justices denounced the
practice of segregation as a "vicious principle ' and
maintained that in this district it was operating in
violation of the 14th amendment. They said that
School Board trustees who allowed the practice were
violating their oaths of office and were liable.
The discussion of this decision will continue for
years. The national implications will be slowly un
derstood as the years go by, and it will be years be
fore the implied reforms are carried out.
The "Pachuco Wars," which occurred in Los An
geles in May, 1943, when dissatisfied Mexican young
sters wore strange clothes and engaged in fights with
service men, who also wanted to let off excess nerv
ous energy, were almost a direct result of the present
school system.
In this one district it will be interesting to watch
and see how much the tension will abate in relation
to number of reforms carried out. The storm, which
is building now, might be avoided, and the example
might be taken and used in other parts of the country
where minorities present the same problems.
During this last week an important case, to some
30,000 Mexican-Americ .ns at least, was decided in
the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
The Federal Court decision was in favor of 10
Mexican residents of Orange County, California who
had originally appealed in local courts against the
discrimination practiced in that county by educa
tional institutions.
Supreme and lower court decisions have taken
on the meaning of law in many recent test cases.
Witness the recent Mt. Clemens Pottery Case which,
unless Congressional action outlaws it. will upset our
whole industrial structure on the question of portal
to-portal pay.
Upheld by the Supreme Court, which it probably
will be, and given the power of law, this case, known
locally as the "Westminster Case,'' may well be the
foundation stone for a completely new outlook on
the problem of minority segregation and education
in the United States.
The peculiar situation which brought about this
latest stand on the segregation issue is a purely local
situation, but one which is synonymous with many
other localities throughout the country.
With the growth of the citrus and agricultural
industries in the Orange County region cheap labor
was needed. Year alter year Mexican citizens were
invited to immigrate to, or heard of the demand and
came to, the district. The labor market was soon
overcrowded.
Language difficulties were encountered and edu
cational facilities were taxed. Separate schools were
set up for the children born of Mexican parents, but
American citizens with language as their only tie
with the old country.
