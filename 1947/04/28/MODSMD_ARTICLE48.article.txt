To the Editor:
Allow me to stir up the coals of the current fire
under the "$65 question."
It is my belief that the present government sub
sistence allowance does provide for the minimum
living expenses of Stanford's veterans. Let me use
Mr. Lissuer's tack but in a more appropriate fash
ion, i.e., Stanford Village instead of Enema Hall. At
the Village—Mr. Sorotskin also, please note—a vet
eran's room and board for the quarter can be held to
$150 for the former and Sl2."> for the latter—total $155.
That leaves $40 for book shave-cream, dnd beer. If,
the government as regards colle veterans and Pub
be done, Mr. Lissuer still believes that "very few, if
any Stanford veterans are subsisting on this allow
ance," I invite him to the village for a small survey.
Suppose we grant that many veterans are "with
drawing capital from personal savings accounts."
Wherein lies the wrong? I agree that extra-curricu
lar activities—social and otherwise are necessary
parts of our college life. But what better investment
could there be for our hard earned and fought-for
savings? If we do have savings, what is to be
showed in the investing of them in our own future?
All this debate over government subsistence, and
living expenses also involves the larger question of
just what should the government be expected to pay
for. I have shown that at Staniord, the government
has paid for our living expenses and then some. I

do not think it the purpose of government to support
all its citizens in whatever straits. Call me a rock
ribbed, reactionary Republican if you will, but I
maintain that the government has adequately dis
charged whatever obligations it has to us veterans
at Stanford. So prices have gone up (Stanford's
have not); these are not the legitimate concerns of
in the light of these statistics showing that it can
lie Law 346 until we are unable to subsist on our
grant. The government should, and does pay for our
subsistence; beyond that is our province and not that
of the U.S. Congress. Contrary to the growing world
sentiment, I do not believe in government subsi
dization of every want. Governments do not exist to
buy us beer and Senior dances. Some peoples cannot
help themselves. But we in America can. Califor
nia's history should make it, of all places, the home
of this spirit of self-reliance.
So let Messrs. Lessuer and Sorotskin and the 400
petition signers look to the facts and to their phil
osophy of government. Though I was in (lie Navy, I
feel sure the buildings wherein I reside at the village
does not resemble a "pup tent. Nor does the Con
Home roster indicate we are being "half-starved.
Stanford veterans cannot justifiably demand a
raise; the spirit of the GI Bill of Rights has not been
violated. Let us cease this Pork Barrel Clamor, and
get on with the business of our education.

That leaves $40 for book shave-cream, dnd beer. If,
the government as regards colle veterans and Pub
be done, Mr. Lissuer still believes that "very few, if
any Stanford veterans are subsisting on this allow
ance," I invite him to the village for a small survey.
Suppose we grant that many veterans are "with
drawing capital from personal savings accounts."
Wherein lies the wrong? I agree that extra-curricu
lar activities—social and otherwise are necessary
parts of our college life. But what better investment
could there be for our hard earned and fought-for
savings? If we do have savings, what is to be
showed in the investing of them in our own future?
All this debate over government subsistence, and
living expenses also involves the larger question of
just what should the government be expected to pay
for. I have shown that at Staniord, the government
has paid for our living expenses and then some. I

do not think it the purpose of government to support
all its citizens in whatever straits. Call me a rock
ribbed, reactionary Republican if you will, but I
maintain that the government has adequately dis
charged whatever obligations it has to us veterans
at Stanford. So prices have gone up (Stanford's
have not); these are not the legitimate concerns of
in the light of these statistics showing that it can
lie Law 346 until we are unable to subsist on our
grant. The government should, and does pay for our
subsistence; beyond that is our province and not that
of the U.S. Congress. Contrary to the growing world
sentiment, I do not believe in government subsi
dization of every want. Governments do not exist to
buy us beer and Senior dances. Some peoples cannot
help themselves. But we in America can. Califor
nia's history should make it, of all places, the home
of this spirit of self-reliance.
So let Messrs. Lessuer and Sorotskin and the 400
petition signers look to the facts and to their phil
osophy of government. Though I was in (lie Navy, I
feel sure the buildings wherein I reside at the village
does not resemble a "pup tent. Nor does the Con
Home roster indicate we are being "half-starved.
Stanford veterans cannot justifiably demand a
raise; the spirit of the GI Bill of Rights has not been
violated. Let us cease this Pork Barrel Clamor, and
get on with the business of our education.

Mr. Lissuer's tack but in a more appropriate fash
