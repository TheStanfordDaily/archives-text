# Toyon Drive Nets 10 Food Parcels
## 
### 
Four hundred pounds of clothing
and enough money for 10 CARE
food packages have been collected
in the three weeks of Toyon's Eu
ropean relief drive, committee mem
ber Ralph Miller announced last
night.
"Contributions have been coming
in from almost all living groups,"
said Miller. "One of the latest do
nations was a $20 gift for CARE
packages from Building 123 of the
Village."
Branner has also given $20 for the
food parcels, Miller said.
Toyon will discontinue its drive
with the final wrapping tonight, but
Branner will continue to collect re
lief supplies for another week, ac
cording to Miller.
"Response to our drive has been
extremely gratifying," said Miller.
'This has been made possible only
through the interest and co-opera
tion shown by various individuals
throughout the campus.
Twenty-one packages have al
ready been wrapped and sent to
Europe. The remaining clothes will
be collected and wrapped tonight.
Anyone interested in helping may
come into the Toyon resident di
rectors suite between 7 and 8, Mil
ler said.
