# Tresidder Sees College Danger Near
## 
### 
Dr. Donald B. Tresidder warned
last week in his annual report to
the Board of Trustees that Ameri
can colleges and universities are
facing grave dangers.
The most serious danger, he de
clared, is that in attempting to pro
vide for ever - increasing numbers
they may spread their resources too
thin, lowering the quality of work
to the point where coming genera
tions of graduates will be inade
quately prepared for responsibilities
which they must assume.
URGES VIGILANCE
Dr. Tresidder urged vigilance
against the intrusion of trivial activ
ities into the university's curricu
lum; keeping guard against over
specialization; and the bringing of

more unity and a clearer sense of
purpose into the program of general
education.
One of the hazards facing higher
education today, Dr. Tresidder not
ed, is the shortage of teachers. To
meet the deficit which exists in
gifted teachers in face of'a growing
university population, he called for
plans to be laid to accelerate the
recruiting and training of college
and university teachers of highest
attainments.
VETS SUCCEED
"A very substantial proporton of
the returning veterans who had
studied at Stanford before their
war service are making consistently
higher grades than before," Dr.
Tresidder said, in praising the vet
erans for their performance. The
that a large part of the
veteran enrollment stemmed from
the desire for a "free ride" on the
G.I. Bill has not been borne out by
Stanford's experience, he added.
