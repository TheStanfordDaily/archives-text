# Moscow Conference Is Failure--Marshall
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 28 (UP).â€”Secretary of State George C.
Marshall, in a bleak report on the Moscow peace conference, said
tonight that Generalissimo Joseph Stalin had told him he ex
pected little from that meeting and was counting instead on an
eventual "compromise through exhaustion" to settle the big
powers' major differences.
Reporting to the nation by radio on his 46 futile days in Moscow, Mar
shall rejected emphatically the policy of delay and concession suggested
by the Soviet Premier.
He said bluntly that the United States will not compromise on its fun
damental principles for the sake of getting an agreement with Russia. He
warned that the political and economic condition of Europe is too critical to
permit unneaessary delay in writing the peace for that war-ravaged con
tinent.
SOVIETS BLOCKED AGREEMENT
Marshall said frankly but without bitterness that Russia must shoulder
the blame for the failure of the conference. He said the Soviets blocked
agreement on all major Issues by their uncompromising insistence on
demands which inevitably would lead Germany and all Europe back into
dictatorship and strife.
He tempered his report only with the cautious hope that the meeting,
by bringing the major disagreements into the open, might have cleared
the air and paved the way for greater progress when the Russian, British,
and French Foreign Ministers meet with him again in New York and Lon
don next fall.
SOME HOPE LEFT
The best that can be hoped for in the intervening months, he said, is
possibly settlement of some minor issues and further "clarification" of the
basic Russo-American differences that threaten to divide the world into
two hostile camps.
While stressing the differences and disagreements of the conference,
Marshall also urged the American public to rccognize that the problems
involved in the European peace-making are many and complex and to try
and understand the viewpoints of other peoples.
