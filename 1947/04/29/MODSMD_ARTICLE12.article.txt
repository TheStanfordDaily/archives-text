# Farm Will Buy Tags, Berries; Work For Con Home Children
## Con Home Tags to Sell Today On Ouad, at Cellar, Post Office 
### 
"One of Many" is the slogan chosen for Tag Day which will
be observed today as part of the Convalescent Home Week drive.
Tags shaped like the numeral "1" will be sold from 8 a.m.
to 5 p.m. at Engineering Corner, History Corner, Psychology
Corner, and Geology Corner on the Quad, and at the Cellar and

the postoffice, according to Jess Por
ter of Roble, Chairman of Tag Day.
Girls from Roble, Branner, Ven
tura, and Guthrie will sell the tags
at 10 cents each. Every student is
Iraditionally supposed to wear one
and may pay more than the 10
cents if he wishes.
Tags will be sold by graduate
women students living at the Vil
lage during meal hours, said Miss
Porter. This will enable students
who live at the Village to get them
more conveniently. They will ialso
be sold near the Strawberry Brunch
which will be held in Union Court
today.
If every student buys a tag, over
$700 would be added to the Con
Home Drive. This event is part of
the annual Con Home Week which
is observed every year in order to
raise money for the Farm's only
full-time charity. Miss Porter urges
every student to be "One of Many."
and wear a tag for the Con Home
Loday.
