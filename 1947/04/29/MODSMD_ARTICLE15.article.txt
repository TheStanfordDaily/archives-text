A toy for each child at the Con

the Convalescent Home Toy Drive,
which started yesterday in all wom

Carolyn Reeder, chairman.
Miss Reeder wishes to urge every
woman on campus to donate toys,

may own. or to purchase them from
the dime store. These toys are es
pecially needed for the amusement
of the bedridden patients, she said.
The collection will continue until
Wednesday, when trucks will col

ner, Lagunita, Storey House, and
Union Unit. The toys will be dis
