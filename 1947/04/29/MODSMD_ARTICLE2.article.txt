# Pacific Tel and Tel Rejects Wage Offer of Striking Unions
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, April 28 (UP).—The Pacific Telephone and
Telegraph Company today followed the pattern set by telephone
company negotiators in Washington last week and rejected a $6
weekly wage boost proposed by striking unions as a "return to
work" measure.
The union's offer to acccpt that amount—half of the originally de
manded $12 weekly—came during a two-hour session with company and
union negotiators before Federal Conciliator Omar Hopkins.
Actually, said Paul Johnson, chairman of the P. T. & T. bargaining
committee, the union had merely slashed $6 from all the increase de
mands and was still asking for boosts ranging from $6 to $26, and in
some cases higher, rather than for $12 to $32 a week.
Company spokesman termed the strikers' proposal "strictly unaccept
able" and suggested instead that the union agree to arbitration of wages
on a local basis. That is the same demand made by Bell System negotia
tors in Washington ever since the strike began three weeks ago.
Meanwhile, across San Francisco Bay in Oakland, a union official and
six women were arrested in front of the P. T. & T.'s central office on
charges of violating a court order order limiting pickets to six at cach
company building.
