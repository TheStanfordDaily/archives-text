# Golf Tournament To Today
## 
### 
First playoffs in this week's Con
valescent Home Golf Tournament
begin this afternoon at 1, when 13
teams will meet at the Stanford golf
course for a nine - hole handicap
contest, according to Bob Rosburg,
chairman of the golf meet.
Handicap awards will appear on
the score sheet of each team, Ros
burg said. Prizes will be awarded
on the basis of how scores compare
with the handicaps. There is no
green fee charge.
Contestants must pay the 50-ccnt
entry fee to Biz Hall at the course
before starting play. As soon as a
team finishes the nine holes, their
score cards must be turned in to the
student in charge.
Golfers on the winning team will
receive two golf balls each, and the
runner-up entry will be awarded
one ball each.
Rosburg said that if any golfer
finds he cannot be at the course at
the time allotted him, he should no
tify his partner. The team will no
tify the course management that
they arc playing in the tournament
when they arrive at their new time.
