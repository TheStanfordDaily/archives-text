# Celebrations, Breaking Dishes Continue Among Traditional Activities of Hashers
## 
### JACK CAPITO 
Probably the best loved hashing
event is the birthday tradition. The
girl with a birthday selects a hasher
to bring out her cake, with which
she receives a kiss. A hasher's
handsomeness is therefore rated by
the number of birthday cakes he
carries out.
The main complaint of today's
hasher is the food. Food is the dom
inant topic at every meal. Instead
of greeting each other with,
"Nice day, isn't it?"
they say,
"Lousy lunch, isn't it?"
That, too, is a tradition.
(.RIPING A TRADITION
"Griping about the food is as
much a tradition as knocking spokes
out of the bannisters at Encina,"
stated the director of one of the
halls. "Their fathers did it too."
"Likes and dislikes are the tough
est. part of life to face for dining
hall directors," said another director.
"We have never yet produced a meal
which has pleased both girls and
hashers."
When asked about the girls he
verves, a hasher at Branner said:
"There are three kinds of women:
the kind that slaps your hand when
you try to take her plate, the kind
that cracks your knuckles with the
handle of a dinner knife, and the
kind that just hangs on to the plate
and 'wrassles' with you. But," he
states proudly, "I've never lost, a
plate."
LOVE THAT HASIIER
A Roble girl, when asked about
hashers, said:
"I love them, but must they always
get their hands tangled up in my
hair and drop knives in my water
glass when they are clearing the
table? I'm going to begin wearing
a bathing suit to dinner!"
A Lag girl remarks:

"I don't mind them tripping over
my chair while I'm drinking coflee
or sticking their fingers in my pie
or dropping ice cream down my
back, but 1 do wish they'd let nit
take a good look at my dinner be
fore snatching it away.'
A Union girl's only onunent was:
'Mmmmm, can they dish it out!'
HASHER. SCIIMASHER
"Hashers, schmashers," is what
Stan Shpetner, head hasher at Union
public dining room, would answer
if asked about hasher ;.
Union and the University dining

halls are probably the biggest "crash
houses'' on campus. Mrs. Dorothy
Bell, Union director, states that 2,100
dishes were broken at Union last
quarter, and 1,920 pieces of silver
were lost. At one hall, the head
hasher saved all the dishes broken
during one week. On Saturday
evening he piled the pieces on a tray
and one of the hashers dropped it
in the dining room where the girls
were eat ing.
"We save our good dishes that
way," explained the resourceful
head man.

There are 34 men hashers and 1!)
women at Lag, 28 men and 12 wo
men at Roble, 43 men and 13 wo
men at Union, 30 men and 10 women
at the Cellar, 87 men and no women
at Encina, 2G men and 2 women at
Brimner, making a total of 248 men
; nd 5(5 women hashing at University
dining halls, not including the vil
lage, according to Mrs. Bell.
The men get each meal they hash,
while the women, who must pay
llieir board at the beginning of the
quarter, receive 00 cents in return
.or each meal they hash.
"The principal function of a hasher
is to eat,'' said a house mother at
one of the women's Row houses.
"The rest is incidental except for
breaking dishes. That's the second
most important function. They'd ra
ther break the dishes than wash
them. But as a rule, they've a pret
ty fine bunch of fellows."
50 ON ROW
There are IVoni 45 to 50 men hash
ing at women's row houses. Each
house has five or six hashers, who
each work lrom two to three hours
for lunch and dinner.
"They eat in the kitchen," ex
plained the house mother, "and
they're just one of the family. When
ever the gii Is give a party or dance
the boys aie always invited."
MEN'S ROW INFORMAL
The men's row houses have no
dish-breaking problem. Their hash
ers aije members of the fraternities
in which they hash, therefore the
sport would prove quite costly to
them and would certainly take the
bang out of it. Hashing at a fra
ternity house is probably the most
informal type of hashing.
Irl charge of hashers at the fra
ternities are the house managers.
"Hashing at Stanford bears no
social stigma as it does at many
other colleges," declared Mrs. Bell.
"At Stanford it is a widely sought
social activity as well as a means of
earning extra spending money.
HASIIER PARTIES
The hashers have Christmas par
ties and spring barbecues. In Union
Ihe hashers and girls eat lunch
cafeteria style in the same dining
room or on the patio. They also
have volleyball games in the yard
before and after dinner.
Many a romance has budded be
neath a hasher's tray, one of them
being Herbert Hoover's. He met Mrs.
Hoover while hashing at the Kappa
House (Russell).
Frankie Albert, Hank Lussetti,
Ed Stamm, Pete Zager, Gal
lerneau. Gene Coldiron, Lloyd Mer
ritnan, Morley Thompson, Bob An-
Jerson, are but a few of the long
list of well-knowns who hash or
have bashed at Stanford.

dishes were broken at Union last
quarter, and 1,920 pieces of silver
were lost. At one hall, the head
hasher saved all the dishes broken
during one week. On Saturday
evening he piled the pieces on a tray
and one of the hashers dropped it
in the dining room where the girls
were eat ing.
"We save our good dishes that
way," explained the resourceful
head man.

There are 34 men hashers and 1!)
women at Lag, 28 men and 12 wo
men at Roble, 43 men and 13 wo
men at Union, 30 men and 10 women
at the Cellar, 87 men and no women
at Encina, 2G men and 2 women at
Brimner, making a total of 248 men
; nd 5(5 women hashing at University
dining halls, not including the vil
lage, according to Mrs. Bell.
The men get each meal they hash,
while the women, who must pay
llieir board at the beginning of the
quarter, receive 00 cents in return
.or each meal they hash.
"The principal function of a hasher
is to eat,'' said a house mother at
one of the women's Row houses.
"The rest is incidental except for
breaking dishes. That's the second
most important function. They'd ra
ther break the dishes than wash
them. But as a rule, they've a pret
ty fine bunch of fellows."
50 ON ROW
There are IVoni 45 to 50 men hash
ing at women's row houses. Each
house has five or six hashers, who
each work lrom two to three hours
for lunch and dinner.
"They eat in the kitchen," ex
plained the house mother, "and
they're just one of the family. When
ever the gii Is give a party or dance
the boys aie always invited."
MEN'S ROW INFORMAL
The men's row houses have no
dish-breaking problem. Their hash
ers aije members of the fraternities
in which they hash, therefore the
sport would prove quite costly to
them and would certainly take the
bang out of it. Hashing at a fra
ternity house is probably the most
informal type of hashing.
Irl charge of hashers at the fra
ternities are the house managers.
"Hashing at Stanford bears no
social stigma as it does at many
other colleges," declared Mrs. Bell.
"At Stanford it is a widely sought
social activity as well as a means of
earning extra spending money.
HASIIER PARTIES
The hashers have Christmas par
ties and spring barbecues. In Union
Ihe hashers and girls eat lunch
cafeteria style in the same dining
room or on the patio. They also
have volleyball games in the yard
before and after dinner.
Many a romance has budded be
neath a hasher's tray, one of them
being Herbert Hoover's. He met Mrs.
Hoover while hashing at the Kappa
House (Russell).
Frankie Albert, Hank Lussetti,
Ed Stamm, Pete Zager, Gal
lerneau. Gene Coldiron, Lloyd Mer
ritnan, Morley Thompson, Bob An-
Jerson, are but a few of the long
list of well-knowns who hash or
have bashed at Stanford.


IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN TO A HASHER, EVEN
Probably the best loved hashing
event is the birthday tradition. The
girl with a birthday selects a hasher
to bring out her cake, with which
she receives a kiss. A hasher's
handsomeness is therefore rated by
the number of birthday cakes he
carries out.
The main complaint of today's
hasher is the food. Food is the dom
inant topic at every meal. Instead
of greeting each other with,
"Nice day, isn't it?"
they say,
"Lousy lunch, isn't it?"
That, too, is a tradition.
(.RIPING A TRADITION
"Griping about the food is as
much a tradition as knocking spokes
out of the bannisters at Encina,"
stated the director of one of the
halls. "Their fathers did it too."
"Likes and dislikes are the tough
est. part of life to face for dining
hall directors," said another director.
"We have never yet produced a meal
which has pleased both girls and
hashers."
When asked about the girls he
verves, a hasher at Branner said:
"There are three kinds of women:
the kind that slaps your hand when
you try to take her plate, the kind
that cracks your knuckles with the
handle of a dinner knife, and the
kind that just hangs on to the plate
and 'wrassles' with you. But," he
states proudly, "I've never lost, a
plate."
LOVE THAT HASIIER
A Roble girl, when asked about
hashers, said:
"I love them, but must they always
get their hands tangled up in my
hair and drop knives in my water
glass when they are clearing the
table? I'm going to begin wearing
a bathing suit to dinner!"
A Lag girl remarks:

"I don't mind them tripping over
my chair while I'm drinking coflee
or sticking their fingers in my pie
or dropping ice cream down my
back, but 1 do wish they'd let nit
take a good look at my dinner be
fore snatching it away.'
A Union girl's only onunent was:
'Mmmmm, can they dish it out!'

HASIIER PARTIES
The hashers have Christmas par
ties and spring barbecues. In Union
Ihe hashers and girls eat lunch
cafeteria style in the same dining
room or on the patio. They also
have volleyball games in the yard
before and after dinner.
Many a romance has budded be
neath a hasher's tray, one of them
being Herbert Hoover's. He met Mrs.
Hoover while hashing at the Kappa
House (Russell).
Frankie Albert, Hank Lussetti,
Ed Stamm, Pete Zager, Gal
lerneau. Gene Coldiron, Lloyd Mer
ritnan, Morley Thompson, Bob An-
Jerson, are but a few of the long
list of well-knowns who hash or
have bashed at Stanford.


IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN TO A HASHER, EVEN
Probably the best loved hashing
event is the birthday tradition. The
girl with a birthday selects a hasher
to bring out her cake, with which
she receives a kiss. A hasher's
handsomeness is therefore rated by
the number of birthday cakes he
carries out.
The main complaint of today's
hasher is the food. Food is the dom
inant topic at every meal. Instead
of greeting each other with,
"Nice day, isn't it?"
they say,
"Lousy lunch, isn't it?"
That, too, is a tradition.
(.RIPING A TRADITION
"Griping about the food is as
much a tradition as knocking spokes
out of the bannisters at Encina,"
stated the director of one of the
halls. "Their fathers did it too."
"Likes and dislikes are the tough
est. part of life to face for dining
hall directors," said another director.
"We have never yet produced a meal
which has pleased both girls and
hashers."
When asked about the girls he
verves, a hasher at Branner said:
"There are three kinds of women:
the kind that slaps your hand when
you try to take her plate, the kind
that cracks your knuckles with the
handle of a dinner knife, and the
kind that just hangs on to the plate
and 'wrassles' with you. But," he
states proudly, "I've never lost, a
plate."
LOVE THAT HASIIER
A Roble girl, when asked about
hashers, said:
"I love them, but must they always
get their hands tangled up in my
hair and drop knives in my water
glass when they are clearing the
table? I'm going to begin wearing
a bathing suit to dinner!"
A Lag girl remarks:

"I don't mind them tripping over
my chair while I'm drinking coflee
or sticking their fingers in my pie
or dropping ice cream down my
back, but 1 do wish they'd let nit
take a good look at my dinner be
fore snatching it away.'
A Union girl's only onunent was:
'Mmmmm, can they dish it out!'
HASHER. SCIIMASHER
"Hashers, schmashers," is what
Stan Shpetner, head hasher at Union
public dining room, would answer
if asked about hasher ;.
Union and the University dining

halls are probably the biggest "crash
houses'' on campus. Mrs. Dorothy
Bell, Union director, states that 2,100
dishes were broken at Union last
quarter, and 1,920 pieces of silver
were lost. At one hall, the head
hasher saved all the dishes broken
during one week. On Saturday
evening he piled the pieces on a tray
and one of the hashers dropped it
in the dining room where the girls
were eat ing.
"We save our good dishes that
way," explained the resourceful
head man.

There are 34 men hashers and 1!)
women at Lag, 28 men and 12 wo
men at Roble, 43 men and 13 wo
men at Union, 30 men and 10 women
at the Cellar, 87 men and no women
at Encina, 2G men and 2 women at
Brimner, making a total of 248 men
; nd 5(5 women hashing at University
dining halls, not including the vil
lage, according to Mrs. Bell.
The men get each meal they hash,
while the women, who must pay
llieir board at the beginning of the
quarter, receive 00 cents in return
.or each meal they hash.
"The principal function of a hasher
is to eat,'' said a house mother at
one of the women's Row houses.
"The rest is incidental except for
breaking dishes. That's the second
most important function. They'd ra
ther break the dishes than wash
them. But as a rule, they've a pret
ty fine bunch of fellows."
50 ON ROW
There are IVoni 45 to 50 men hash
ing at women's row houses. Each
house has five or six hashers, who
each work lrom two to three hours
for lunch and dinner.
"They eat in the kitchen," ex
plained the house mother, "and
they're just one of the family. When
ever the gii Is give a party or dance
the boys aie always invited."
MEN'S ROW INFORMAL
The men's row houses have no
dish-breaking problem. Their hash
ers aije members of the fraternities
in which they hash, therefore the
sport would prove quite costly to
them and would certainly take the
bang out of it. Hashing at a fra
ternity house is probably the most
informal type of hashing.
Irl charge of hashers at the fra
ternities are the house managers.
"Hashing at Stanford bears no
social stigma as it does at many
other colleges," declared Mrs. Bell.
