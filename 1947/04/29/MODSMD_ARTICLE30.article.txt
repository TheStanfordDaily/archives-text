The first of three semi-finals in

p.m. in Cubberley Auditorium when
the case of the Thurman Manufac
turing Company, plaintiff-appellant,
vs. Scott National Bank of Sequoia,
defendant-respondent, will be de
cided.
Counsel for the appellant will be

vers and for the defendant, Kenneth
M. Eymann and Richard E. Lyon.
The case will be judged by Judge
Edmund Scott of the Superior
Court of San Mateo County, Charles
E. Corker, acting assistant professor
of law, and Jack Hauer, a student.
The semi-finals are the second
step in moot court competition.
The case involves a chock written

by a corporation to two employees
jointly. One of them forged the oth
er's name in the endorsement and
cashed the check.
He deposited the money in an ac- I
count the employer had in another
bank. The employee, who was au
thorized to draw checks on this ac
count, withdrew $5,000 from the
hank, cashed it, and disappeared.
The corporation sued the first
bank saying they should not have
paid the employee, so they are not
entitled to debit the account of the
corporation in that bank.
The judgment in the lower court |
was for the defendant.
The public is invited to attend the j
proceedings.
