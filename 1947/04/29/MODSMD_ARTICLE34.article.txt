# Shuffling the Cards with DON DA VIES

"The Great Moulder" lias a frown
on his face.
Dean Cromwell, the man who has
been "moulding" championship
track teams at the University of
Southern California .since the 20's
has produced another fabulous col
lection of cinder talent.
TIIE GOOD DEAN FROWNS
Still the old man frowns.
He frowns because his boys will
have to trudge into the Los Angeles
Coliseum Saturday for a dual ex
travaganza with the NCAA defend
ing champs from the University of
Illinois. "We don't have a chance,"
the patriarch sighs.
But look very closely and you
might see a twinkle in the Dean's
eye. His boys not only have a
chance, but they might very well
run away with the show, and send
the Illini home with a few bad
dreams.
PATTON MEETS HERB
Loping Mel Patton won't have too
much trouble in the 100. The Illini's
9.5 century man, Bill Mathis, is on
the academic shelf, so Mel will be all
by himself but in the 220, the dusky
Jamaican Herb McKenley will be
light up there with Patton. On paper
McKenley will be heavily favored
to win the quarter mile.
But Cromwell is counting on Hu
bie Kerns. Hubie hasn't shown the
form he showed a few years ago
when he turned in an unofficial 46.2
and an official 46.6, but he is improv
ing and will give Herb a real race.
SINK GOES FOR DOUBLE
Roland Sink can win both the mile
and two mile. In the first event,
Illini coach Leo Johnson has Tom
Twomey and Bob Rehburg who are
both down around 4:15, but Sink,
who turned in a 4:16 effort against
Stanford, is capable of crowding
the 4:10 mark
A lew weeks ago Twomey was
nosed out in a two-mile effort by
Forrest Efaw, whose winning time
was 9:11.4. But little Rollie breezed
home in 9:14.9 against Occidental
three weeks ago and if pressed can
trim that down.
DUEL FOR BXO HONORS
Another great duel can be ex
pected in the 880 between the Tro
jan's Bob Chambers and Bob Reh
berg. Chamber's best mark this
year is 1:54.9, while Rehberg has
been credited with a 1:53. But the
Illini lad will have a tough time
turning in his best half-mile time
just four events after he runs the
mile.
So frown or no frown, the old
master is out to prove that the great
est track team in the country can
be found in the Figueroa pasture.

Stanford's National Championship
golfers went to Excom last Thursday
to ask that body for "Major" recog
nition. The request was refeiTecl to
ihe S.A.C. and the National Student
Organization.
MASTERS VOICES APPROVAL
Now, Graduate Manager A 1 Mas
ters has already announced his ap
proval of the plan, and the S.A.C.
will undoubtedly follow suit. The
N.S.O. is an investigating and fact
finding group, and they can't help
but find the facts that will put the
clincher on the golf team's request.
The team's unparallelled competitive
record and the tremendous student
interest in the sport speak for them
selves.
There are some who say that
there are already too many "major"
sports, and that the line has to be
drawn. Why should the number of
major sports be arbitrarily limited.
When any sport qualifies as "major"
it should be officially recognized.
And there is no doubt that golf is a
"major" sport at Stanford.

MASTERS VOICES APPROVAL
Now, Graduate Manager A 1 Mas

proval of the plan, and the S.A.C.
will undoubtedly follow suit. The
N.S.O. is an investigating and fact
finding group, and they can't help
but find the facts that will put the
clincher on the golf team's request.
The team's unparallelled competitive
record and the tremendous student

There are some who say that
there are already too many "major"
sports, and that the line has to be
drawn. Why should the number of
major sports be arbitrarily limited.
When any sport qualifies as "major"
it should be officially recognized.
And there is no doubt that golf is a

Coach Everett Dean, who deserves
the coach of the year award for the
job he did this year with the Farm's
basket bailers, was recently elected
to the Board of Directors of the Na
tional Association of Basketball
Coaches at their annual meeting in
New York.
"The Great Moulder" lias a frown
on his face.
Dean Cromwell, the man who has
been "moulding" championship
track teams at the University of
Southern California .since the 20's
has produced another fabulous col
lection of cinder talent.
TIIE GOOD DEAN FROWNS
Still the old man frowns.
He frowns because his boys will
have to trudge into the Los Angeles
Coliseum Saturday for a dual ex
travaganza with the NCAA defend
ing champs from the University of
Illinois. "We don't have a chance,"
the patriarch sighs.
But look very closely and you
might see a twinkle in the Dean's
eye. His boys not only have a
chance, but they might very well
run away with the show, and send
the Illini home with a few bad
dreams.
PATTON MEETS HERB
Loping Mel Patton won't have too
much trouble in the 100. The Illini's
9.5 century man, Bill Mathis, is on
the academic shelf, so Mel will be all
by himself but in the 220, the dusky
Jamaican Herb McKenley will be
light up there with Patton. On paper
McKenley will be heavily favored
to win the quarter mile.
But Cromwell is counting on Hu
bie Kerns. Hubie hasn't shown the
form he showed a few years ago
when he turned in an unofficial 46.2
and an official 46.6, but he is improv
ing and will give Herb a real race.
SINK GOES FOR DOUBLE
Roland Sink can win both the mile
and two mile. In the first event,
Illini coach Leo Johnson has Tom
Twomey and Bob Rehburg who are
both down around 4:15, but Sink,
who turned in a 4:16 effort against
Stanford, is capable of crowding
the 4:10 mark
A lew weeks ago Twomey was
nosed out in a two-mile effort by
Forrest Efaw, whose winning time
was 9:11.4. But little Rollie breezed
home in 9:14.9 against Occidental
three weeks ago and if pressed can
trim that down.
DUEL FOR BXO HONORS
Another great duel can be ex
pected in the 880 between the Tro
jan's Bob Chambers and Bob Reh
berg. Chamber's best mark this
year is 1:54.9, while Rehberg has
been credited with a 1:53. But the
Illini lad will have a tough time
turning in his best half-mile time
just four events after he runs the
mile.
So frown or no frown, the old
master is out to prove that the great
est track team in the country can
be found in the Figueroa pasture.
