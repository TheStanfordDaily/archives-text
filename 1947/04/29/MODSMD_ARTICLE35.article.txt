CINCINNATI, 0., April 28 (UP).â€”
Bnseball Commissioner A. B. (Hap
py) Chandler today announced post
ponement of his hearing with New
York Yankee president Larry Mac-
Phail until Thursday morning.
MacPhail, reportedly charged with
"insubordination in connection with
the recent banning of Brooklyn
Dodger manager Leo Durocher, was
to have met with Chandler here to
morrow but the commissioner
granted the delay because of Mac-
Phail's previous appointments to
morrow and Wednesday.
In banning Durocher, Chandler
said, "all parties to this controversy
are silenced from the time this order
is issued." MacPhail has since been
quoted as saying that the commis
sioner "didn't have ground on which
to hang a five-minute suspension."
