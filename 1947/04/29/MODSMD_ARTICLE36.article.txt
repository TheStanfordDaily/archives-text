NEW YORK. April 28 (UP).—The
world champion St. Louis Cardinals
are playing a strange and unhappy
rol" today—they are in last place
lor the first time since April 25. 1938.
Their amazing transition from
champs to chumps defied explana
tion, but there they are down at the
bottom while their arch rivals, the
Brooklyn Dodgers, are riding high,
wide and handsome in first place.
