# Indian Nine Cards Three Tilts; Faces Busy Week
## 
### STU MILLAR 
With three games scheduled for the week—two of them con
ference crucials —Harry Wolter's baseballers will batten down
the hatches and go all out to fatten their victory column.
Wednesday, the Farmers attempt revenge on the St. Mary's
Gaels. The Injuns took an 11-3 tromping by the Gaels last week

and seem anxious to even the series.
Righty Dave Stott, who had unfor
tunate luck with the Moragans'
bunting prowess last week, will try
again. Frank MacGraw will be be
hind the bat.
San Francisco J.C. faces the Cards
on Thursday. Charley Wakefield and
Dick Ahlquist, Wolter's most robust
battery, will probably pitch and
catch.
U.CX.A.'s Bruins provide confer
ence opposition Saturday afternoon.
Earlier this season the locals and the
Bruins split a two-g; ..ie series down
south. This will be the last meeting
of the teams for the season.
Wolter can cnoose between Dick
Flatland, Dave Dahle. or Larry Wolf
for mound dutie . In all likelihood
it will be Wolf. Dahle is still com
plaining of a sore shoulder. Wolf
looked particularly sharp in his re
lief stint against U.S.C. last Satur
day. Ward Walkup will handle the
catching chores for this game.

Although Wolter's battery fluctu
ates from game to game, the rest of
the team is pretty well set.
Cardinally Peters, Brownson, and
Arce form the regular infield com
bination, though Clyde Dingfelder
could conceivably break in if his
fielding picks up. He is one of the
better hitters on the team.
Lloyd Merriman and Tod Nell are
sure performers in center and light
field. But George Sloat and A 1
Kircher are still fighting it out for
the left field berth.
