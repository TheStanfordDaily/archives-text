# California, Farm Swim Squads Vie
## 
### 
From all indications, Stanford's |
coming swim meet with California
Saturday will prove to be the big
gest hurdle the Indians will have to
scale to keep their '47 dual meet
win string intact.
The Bears, unbeaten so far this
year, splashed through two meets
last weelcnd. using a minimum of
effort.
Friday night, Cal walloped the
San Francisco Olympic Club 53 to
22. It may be remembered that the
Farm swimmers downed the Club
men 55 to 20 and 44 to 31 in their
two meetings this year. Saturday,
the Bears brushed by College of the
Pacific at Stockton.
Stan Morketter and Don Bcanston
still lead the Boars. In the Club
meet, both scored double wins, Mor
ketter in (he 50 and 100 and Bean-'
ston in the 220 and 440-yard free
styles.
Best races of the day could easily
be the meetings btoween Fred Taioli
and Beanston. Possibly the two best
clistancemen on the coast, the two
will be taking up once again the ri
valry which began in the national
championships at Seattle last April.
