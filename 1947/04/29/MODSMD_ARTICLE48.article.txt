Letters from A.S.S.U. President Martin An
derson went out yesterday to all newly-elected
Excom members inviting them to attend Ex
ecutive committee sessions during the re
mainder of the quarter.
While some persons may take these invita
tions as mere formalities, there are some very
practical reasons for them which shouldn't be
overlooked.
The rapid turn-over of student body officers,
the short terms, plus the press of studies tends
to create a situation where student govern
ment is apt to be no more than a formality.
In such a situation student officers of neces
sity have to depend on faculty and administra
tion members, who have been connected with
Stanford student government for some time,
until they learn enough to make valid de
cisions of their own.
This can be avoided if officers-elect, who
are to take over next fall, recognize the respon
sibilities which will be theirs and begin to pre
pare themselves for them now.

We suggest that incoming officers:
1. Attend Excom meetings regularly for the
rest of the quarter.
2. Work closely with the person whose job
they are taking over.
3. Read and acquaint themselves fully with
the A.S.S.U. constitution.
4. Get to know members of the Adminis
tration and Faculty with whom they'll be doing
business during the next year.
5. Visit and learn something of the opera
tion of the Daily, Quad, Chaparral, and K.S.U.
6. Study up on the background of all phases
of the Institute on International Relations, and
the N.S.O.
7. Acquaint themselves with the jurisdic
tion and operation of the S.A.C.
These are main suggestions which, if fol
lowed, would enable Excom and other student
officers to start off in high gear in the fall.
The burden of responsibility for preparing
themselves for their jobs rests with newly
