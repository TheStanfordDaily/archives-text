### DAN ENDSLEY 
Believe me, I didn't realize what a hornet's nest I
was stirring up when I pointed out a few of our re
vered Chappie's failings. Had I realized the senti
ment with which a large part of the campus (mostly
people who work for Chappie) regards that scream
ingly unfunny publication, I never would have dared
take such a controversial step. I'm really very timid.
However, the hurricane has commenced and I'm
bound to ride out the storm. Please understand,
though, that I merely offer constructive criticism,
without malice. Some of my best friends work on
Chappie. I don't brag about it; I mention it just to
show I'm not a snob.
If you have already perused the Campus

Opinions, you know that The
Daily has received two letters
which disagree with my column of
Friday. Mr. Ray Elsmore has de
livered a quite unnecessarily 1
lengthy essay on the virtues
Chappie, in which he undertakes
to prove that said magazine has
no faults whatsoever. I am sure
he was not swayed by the fact,
that he is a Chaparral photog
rapher. •

Mr. Elsmore also contends that the "jokes" I per
petrated while in a mood of perhaps misguided help
fulness were so bad that not one person on the
campus laughed at them. There I have him. I freely
admitted at the time that they were not funny, and
I certainly would not laugh at them myself—but
yesterday a young man told me he thought they were
marvelous. To a certain degree he took the edge off

my pleasure when he said he also liked that Chappie
monstrosity about Afton and Ronnie.
The other letter comes directly from the Chappie
staff, and asks my editor's permission to use some of
my Histories. Evidently they think even my serious
columns are funnier than their designedly "humor
ous'' material. I consider that a great honor, and
don't think I don't appreciate it—but I'm afraid it
just helps to prove one of the points I made Friday.
You can see it, can't you? Chappie is already
under fire because its staff is incapable of writing
sufficiently humorous material. Now it shows itself
desirous of reprinting matter which has already ap
peared in The Daily—a publication they insinuate is
unfit even as drawer-lining material. "Oh, how the
mighty have fallen!" as the Good Book says.
Mr. Stanley "Railroad" Shpetner—who ish one
of the biggesht men on the campush—happens to be
an associate editor of our beloved contempt-orary.
He tells me that none of Chappie's staff has any de
sire to run those atrocious exchange "jokes," but that
their readership demands it. Even if I were a moron
(my I.Q. is above 75, so no remarks), I would consider
that statement a direct insult to my intelligence. If
said about Berkeley it might be believable—but
Stanford? Oh, surely not!
Let it not be thought, however, that I consider
Chappie completely bad. The "Pig of the Month" feat
ure in the latest issue is much better than usual. All
the boys—young and old—should be congratulated for
their enterprise.
It must be admitted, however, that opinion here at
The Daily is not unanimous on the Chaparral ques
tion. Even my own editor thinks the latest Chappie
issue was a pig improvement.
Said he: "Chappie is only half as bad this month."

staff, and asks my editor's permission to use some of
my Histories. Evidently they think even my serious
columns are funnier than their designedly "humor
ous'' material. I consider that a great honor, and
don't think I don't appreciate it—but I'm afraid it
just helps to prove one of the points I made Friday.
You can see it, can't you? Chappie is already
under fire because its staff is incapable of writing
sufficiently humorous material. Now it shows itself
desirous of reprinting matter which has already ap
peared in The Daily—a publication they insinuate is
unfit even as drawer-lining material. "Oh, how the
mighty have fallen!" as the Good Book says.
Mr. Stanley "Railroad" Shpetner—who ish one
of the biggesht men on the campush—happens to be
an associate editor of our beloved contempt-orary.
He tells me that none of Chappie's staff has any de
sire to run those atrocious exchange "jokes," but that
their readership demands it. Even if I were a moron
(my I.Q. is above 75, so no remarks), I would consider
that statement a direct insult to my intelligence. If
said about Berkeley it might be believable—but
Stanford? Oh, surely not!
Let it not be thought, however, that I consider
Chappie completely bad. The "Pig of the Month" feat
ure in the latest issue is much better than usual. All
the boys—young and old—should be congratulated for
their enterprise.
It must be admitted, however, that opinion here at
The Daily is not unanimous on the Chaparral ques
tion. Even my own editor thinks the latest Chappie
issue was a pig improvement.
Said he: "Chappie is only half as bad this month."

Believe me, I didn't realize what a hornet's nest I
was stirring up when I pointed out a few of our re
vered Chappie's failings. Had I realized the senti
ment with which a large part of the campus (mostly
people who work for Chappie) regards that scream
ingly unfunny publication, I never would have dared
take such a controversial step. I'm really very timid.
However, the hurricane has commenced and I'm
bound to ride out the storm. Please understand,
though, that I merely offer constructive criticism,
without malice. Some of my best friends work on
Chappie. I don't brag about it; I mention it just to
show I'm not a snob.
If you have already perused the Campus

Opinions, you know that The
Daily has received two letters
which disagree with my column of
Friday. Mr. Ray Elsmore has de
livered a quite unnecessarily 1
lengthy essay on the virtues
Chappie, in which he undertakes
to prove that said magazine has
no faults whatsoever. I am sure
he was not swayed by the fact,
that he is a Chaparral photog
rapher. •

Mr. Elsmore also contends that the "jokes" I per
petrated while in a mood of perhaps misguided help
fulness were so bad that not one person on the
campus laughed at them. There I have him. I freely
admitted at the time that they were not funny, and
I certainly would not laugh at them myself—but
yesterday a young man told me he thought they were
marvelous. To a certain degree he took the edge off

my pleasure when he said he also liked that Chappie
monstrosity about Afton and Ronnie.
The other letter comes directly from the Chappie
staff, and asks my editor's permission to use some of
my Histories. Evidently they think even my serious
columns are funnier than their designedly "humor
ous'' material. I consider that a great honor, and
don't think I don't appreciate it—but I'm afraid it
