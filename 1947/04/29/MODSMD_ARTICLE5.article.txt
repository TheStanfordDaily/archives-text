### 
Student leaders will meet with
President Donald B. Tresidder some
time this week—possibly Thursday
—to set up formally the new stu
dent-administration forum, accord- '
ing to Ann Lilienthal, chairman of
Cardinals.
Martin Anderson, Tom MartzlolT, j
Millie Edwards, Guyla Runyan, |
Gene Mitguard, Newt Wise, and j
Miss Lilienthal will attend the I
meeting.
TRESIDDER FAVORS
Expressing tentative approval of i
the proposed forum. Dr. Tresidder
said, "I'm in favor of it in principle, :
but we must be sure to set it up the
right way."
Dr. Tresidder thought that the
forum, as it is proposed now, might
weaken student government by tak
ing power out of Excom's hands.
Dean of Students John Stalnaker
had some comment on the aims of
the proposed forum.
"It should have a two-fold pur
pose," he said. "It should not only
present a means of distributing in
formation where it will do the most
good, but it should allow the pres
entation of points of view. It is in j
that way that students and admin- j
istration can reconcile their feel
ings."
STALNAKER NOT WORRIED
"More important, it should be
representative," Dr. Stalnaker said.
"I'm not worried about student
opinion as long as it is representa
tive. That's why I'm for the forum.
"These are the important issues
which I should like to see the forum
consider," Stalnaker said.
"1. Undergraduate cur.-.culum.
"2. Vocational vs. general educa
tion.
"3. Effective educational living
groups. (This in many ways is the
most important of all, for growing
up is essential to education at Stan
ford.)
"4. Student union.
"5. Understanding of the financial
arrangements and actions of the
University so that students can un
derstand what can and what cannot
be done in the way of improve- |
ments."
