Like so much else in Europe, the Moscow con
ference of foreign ministers is "alles kaputt." Yet
it can be pointed out that the note struck so far by
our returned delegation is not one of despair or
desperation. One gathers that we have broken off
an engagement, but have lost neither a battle nor the
war. Another session of the foreign ministers is
planned for next November at which, presumably,
the German and Austrian treaties will be further
considered. General Marshall, gently but firmly
puts the blame for the failure of the Moscbw meet
ing on the USSR, but talks hopefully of the prob
able success of future negotiations.
I get the impression that a conference of foreign
ministers is not a meeting of persons determined on
settling some problems of mutual concern. It is dis
charging the same function as our own Congress. The
important work is done behind the scenes. Rarely in
Congress do the speeches on the floor much influence
the course of legislation. Almost always the decisions
arc made in the committees, in the hotel rooms, or at
home in the county meetings. Yet these decisions
must be formally discussed, in theory, freely, openly,
and on a high plane of reason and policy. In the
forum, Congress or Conference, the influence of the
übiquitous special interests, of the pressure groups,
disinterested and otherwise, is usually concealed or
by some tacit gentlemen's agreement—all legislators
live in glass houses—passed over in silence.

On the higher levels, this formal legislative pro
cess is a game, as formal a game as is chess. There
arc rules, and under these rules there can be defeats
and victories, and the contestants are under a curious
compulsion to accept the results of the game if it
proceeds to its conclusion. In spite of all the back
room planning and bargaining, once a proposition
gets out on the floor the battle must be fought or
the masquerade acted out under new rules and some
times to a different conclusion.
In the Moscow conference we saw a game like
this played. Intelligent men, followed certain rules
and used accepted tactics to implement certain long
range policies and plans. The matters immediately
under discussion, although they happened to involve
the welfare and security of millions of people, were
only the pieces and tokens of this game. Each of
the players moved his pieces to his best advantage,
whether to improve his own position or weaken his
opponents. (Perhaps, to strain the figure a little
further, the players were only interested in picking
up some favorable press notices.) But, whether it
was merely a practice session, or the opening round
of a tournament, or whatever else a metaphorical
mind can drag into the act, the conclusion is that
the players squeezed all the advantage possible out
of the match, left the pieces on the board, and went
to the showers.

able success of future negotiations.
I get the impression that a conference of foreign
ministers is not a meeting of persons determined on
settling some problems of mutual concern. It is dis
charging the same function as our own Congress. The
important work is done behind the scenes. Rarely in
Congress do the speeches on the floor much influence
the course of legislation. Almost always the decisions
arc made in the committees, in the hotel rooms, or at
home in the county meetings. Yet these decisions
must be formally discussed, in theory, freely, openly,
and on a high plane of reason and policy. In the
forum, Congress or Conference, the influence of the
übiquitous special interests, of the pressure groups,
disinterested and otherwise, is usually concealed or
by some tacit gentlemen's agreement—all legislators
live in glass houses—passed over in silence.

On the higher levels, this formal legislative pro
cess is a game, as formal a game as is chess. There
arc rules, and under these rules there can be defeats
and victories, and the contestants are under a curious
compulsion to accept the results of the game if it
proceeds to its conclusion. In spite of all the back
room planning and bargaining, once a proposition
gets out on the floor the battle must be fought or
the masquerade acted out under new rules and some
times to a different conclusion.
In the Moscow conference we saw a game like
this played. Intelligent men, followed certain rules
and used accepted tactics to implement certain long
range policies and plans. The matters immediately
under discussion, although they happened to involve
the welfare and security of millions of people, were
only the pieces and tokens of this game. Each of
the players moved his pieces to his best advantage,
whether to improve his own position or weaken his
opponents. (Perhaps, to strain the figure a little
further, the players were only interested in picking
up some favorable press notices.) But, whether it
was merely a practice session, or the opening round
of a tournament, or whatever else a metaphorical
mind can drag into the act, the conclusion is that
the players squeezed all the advantage possible out
of the match, left the pieces on the board, and went
to the showers.
Like so much else in Europe, the Moscow con
ference of foreign ministers is "alles kaputt." Yet
it can be pointed out that the note struck so far by
our returned delegation is not one of despair or
desperation. One gathers that we have broken off
an engagement, but have lost neither a battle nor the
war. Another session of the foreign ministers is
planned for next November at which, presumably,
the German and Austrian treaties will be further
considered. General Marshall, gently but firmly
puts the blame for the failure of the Moscbw meet
ing on the USSR, but talks hopefully of the prob
able success of future negotiations.
