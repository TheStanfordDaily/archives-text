# CAMPUS OPINION

To the Editor:
Surely anyone, so long as he could read and
write, could write such a fragile criticism of any
humor magazine as did our popular Dan Endsley
write of the Chaparral in last Friday's Daily. Any
one of you could pick up the last edition of the New
Yorker, quote the three worst jokes to be found
therein and then write an attack on the New Yorker
on the basis that those particular jokes were sec
ondhand, out-dated and not capable of inspiring a
laugh.
If a reader were gullible enough to consider the
criticisms of that article just or valid, he certainly
must have seen the whole thing collapse when he
read the three ridiculous puns at the end, imposed
upon him by Mr. Endsley's original, farm-grown wit.
I couldn't even force myself to laugh at such flap
doodle, nor could I find anybody on campus who even
snickered at his attempts at witticism.
At first I wondered that anyone of Dan Endsley's
reputed literary ability would offer an article which
was so evidently folly. Then it occurred to me that,
since he is so well versed in humor and completely
up-to-date on all published or spoken jokes, he must
have developed a very refined sense of humor. That

'All letters should be addressed to the editor,
signed and contain address and phone num
ber of writer. There is no limit on words but
it is desirable letters be short and to the poin'J

would certainly explain it, for what then seemed
humorous to him would not be appreciated by the
layman and vice-versa. For that reason I truly
hope that I never develop a refined sense of humor.
With my present crude sense of humor I found the
last edition of the Chaparral literally packed with
laughs. My sides still ache and I want to continue
to experience this aching sensation once each month
when the Chappie comes out.
Before quoting his own jokes, Dan justifies them
thus. "They aren't funny, but at least they were
grown ort the farm." That statement I will vouch for.
To the Editor of the Chaparral: Please, Mr. Hewitt,
if these be an example of farm-grown humor, include
nothing but urban humor in your delightful maga
zine.

To the Editor:
We read the Bull Session column in last Friday's
Daily. We would like to know if there is any pos
sibility of borrowing your Mr. Endsley for the re
mainder of the quarter. Or, if that is not possible,
may we reprint some of his "History 1947" columns?
