# Encina Mob Enters Toyon; Riot Ensues
## 
### 
The Jolly Roger which Toyon
Hall hoisted over its ramparts last
Thursday in protest to the results
of the election which passed the
I.S.C was the cause of a mild riot
staged in Toyon last night.
The flag was stolen from Toyon
Saturday night and displayed at
the class of '50 dance. Toyon re
gained possession of the banner
Sunday afternoon and cached it
away.
Last night "a dozen Encina men,
all at least eight feet tall." ac
cording to an observer, pursued
Stan Shpctncr into Toyon in
search of the flag.
A tussle followed which awoke
Glenn Bothwell and Carl Field,
who were asleep in Shpctncr's
room which the invaders were
trying to enter. They barricaded
the door and held ofT the attack
crs.
The noise of the scufTlc woke a
counselor who called the campus
police, who broke up the fracas.
Toyon still has possession of the
Jolly Roger and say that they
"will defend it to the last man."
