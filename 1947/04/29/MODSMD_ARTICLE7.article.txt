A verse by "Brakspcar" accom
panies the glamorous receptacle
for "Kopper Koins for Convales
cent Kids" in front of the Cellar,
according to .lean Rodgcrs, chair
man of the drive.
The plastic leg is being used to
hold copper coin contributions to
the Convalescent Home drive, she
added. At noon yesterday the leg
was filled up to the ankle.
The leg will be displayed at the
Sophomore Carnival, and people
will have a chance to guess the
number of pennies in it. After
the guessing the coins will be giv
en to the Convalescent Home, Miss
Rodgcrs stated.
