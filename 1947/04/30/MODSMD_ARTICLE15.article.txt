## 
### 
A discussion of the student-ad
! ministration forum and the possi
i bilities of holding; a home-coming
j weekend next fall highlighted the
Cardinals meeting last night.
Student leaders Martin Anderson,
Tom MartzlofT, Millie Edwards,
Guy la Runyan, Gene Mitguard,
I Newt Wis?, and Ann Lilienthal will
, meet with President Donald B.
Tresidder tomorrow to discuss plans
| Cor a student-administration forum,'
r ,aid Miss Lilienthal, president of
! Cardinals.
The N.S.O. poll presented to liv-
I :ng groups concerning pertinent
! questions that might bo discussed at
;uch a forum was withdrawn be
! cause it v/as found to be invalid,
according to Ned Fleming, co-chair
; man of the N.S.O.
Dr. Tresidder has asked student
J leaders to meet with him not be
| cause he opposes the forum, but !
| rather for assurance that it will be j
set. up in the right manner.
The forum as it was proposed by
j Cardinals might tend to take away j
some of Excom's jurisdiction, Dr.
Tresidder felt.
Ke also remarked that the setting I
up of numerous campus organiza
tions might serve to weaken stu- j
dent government rather than j
strengthen it.
Cardinals Bob Bcrryman and j
Evelyn Reitze were appointed to in
vestigate the possibilities of hold- i
ing a Stanford home-coming week
end when Stanford plays Cal this |
fall.
Tentative plans include partici- j
i pation of all living groups in a pa
| rade which might extend through
Palo Alto.
"Stanford has never had a home- j
coming weekend, and this would be j
-in ideal way for all old and new
Stanfordites to celebrate the first
home-played Big Game in several
years," said Miss Lilienthal.
