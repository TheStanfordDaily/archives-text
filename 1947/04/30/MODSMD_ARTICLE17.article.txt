# Honor Code, Highly Prized Student Institution Depends on Informed Student Opinion: Tresidder
## 
### 
"Tho sucfc.s of the Honor Code
defends not so much on enforce
ment against, violators as on an in
formed student opinion."
His statement, m do last week
by Dr. Douald B. Tresidder. k?y
notcd a D*>iiy~: pon ored adminis
tration and student-leader critique
of the school-wide survey made
I art quarter by the Honor Code
Standing Committee.
Corrnnnting upon the poll tabu
lations which showed th?t one stu
dent out of enht believed the Honor
Code unsuccessful, Dr. Tresidder
said:
"The Code is one of our most
highly prized student institutions,
but it is an i:r titution that requires
i program of continual education i r
th? maximum of its benefits arc lo
be obtained.
"Sporadic attempts to further un
derstanding of the Honor Code will
never be effective. The educational
program must acquaint students
with the Code when they enter
St! nford as freshmen and be con
tinued until their graduation."
Dr. Tresidder listed the war inter
ruptions and the tremendous ex
pansion of the student body as the
major reasons for the current rise

n number of violators appearing
before Men's Council.
STUDENT SUPPORT HIGH
This view coincides with a state
■rent made last quarter by Dean ol
Students John M. Stalnaker, that
"considering the huce number of
students now at Stanford who arc
•mt thoroughly acquainted with the
Honor Code, support of the system
seems quite hi«h."
Dean Stalnaker said, "I think the
noli indicates that the students are
greatly in favor of the Code and if
such a favorable attitude exists the
Code is bound to succeed."
He explained that the Honor Code
had lived through several similar
periods of general student apathy,
but had always managed to regain
support.
Both Dr. Tresidder and Dean
Stalnaker remarked that if the stu
dents once cave serious thought to
the Code and its intrinsic moral ob
ligations, they would realize that
nothing could effectively take its
place.
"My feeling as a Stanford man
and not as President of the Univer
sity," Dr. Tresidder said, "is that the
Honor Code represents one of the
best opportunities that Stanford of

ers in learning to deal with one's
elf honorably."
The need for intensified educa
j (ion on ti e Code was stressed by
| A.S.S.U. President Martin Ander
son.
' One failure of the Code," Ander
son said, '"is that there is great re
luctance on the part of students to
report cheating when they sec il
| occur."
HONOR CODE EDUCATION
Anderson said it. was his belief
: that if the students were to realize
S the full extent of good faith and re
sponsibility placed on them by the
of such an honor system,
I th? desired support and co-opera
j tion would be automatic.
Recommendations of several spe
cific needs for any Honor Code edu
cation program were related yes
i terday by A 1 Forbes, co-ordinator
of the recent survey and outgoing
chairman of the standing committee.
Forbes advised that new students
should not be asked to sign the hon
or pledge in their rcg books.
SIGN CODE AS FORMALITY
"They sign the card as a mere
formality, it being simply another
I line where a signature is required.

"Instead, informal meetings in the
various freshman living groups
ihould be he'd two or three days
after registration. At such a time
the Code can be fully explained to
them. The student can then be pre
sented with the card for his sig
( nature, and he will sign it under a
much different psychological atti
j tude than he would in the confu
j ion of a leg day."
FORBES RECOMMENDS
Forbes also recommended that
j the chairman of the standing com
| mittee attend Men's Council meet
) ings so as to witness Code violation
| hearings. He said that if the com
mittee has knowledge of specific
eases, it will be able to handle the
educational program in a much
i more realistic fashion.
Forbes said he had finished his
; official report of the survey and
I that hi would present copies to Ex
: com and the University this week.
He said he had written letters to
the professors of the 14 classes that
- the poll had shown as havini rc
; current Honor Code violations. Each
instructor, he said, had sent a
prompt reply pledging suj port in
the future.
