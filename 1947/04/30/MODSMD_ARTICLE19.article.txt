EXPRESSIONISTIC PLAY
Of the expressionistic type. '"The
j Adding Machine," in seven scenes,
will show the effect of machine age
society over individuality, Chuck
Ingram, director, said. This will be
achieved through penetration be
neath reality. Essences rather than
! the outward views will be portrayed,
| he added.
Simple but distorted scenery and
lights, according to Ingram, produce
this effect. "The scenes show things
as Zero sees them, not as they really
are," he declared. The seven sets,
built by the Speech and Drama Class
in Stagccraft, were designed by Har
rison McCreath, technical director.
CO-WORKERS
Zero's co-workers will illustrate
i society of today by showing lack of
originality in dress, acts, and man.
ncrs. They will be used as was the
\ Chorus in the ancient Greek Dramas.
This production marks the first
time two people have collaborated
nn a production thesis for masters'
degrees. Director Ingram is using
it as his director's thesis and Me
! Creath, as his technical production
j thesis.
