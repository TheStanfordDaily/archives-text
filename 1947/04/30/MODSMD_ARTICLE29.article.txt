# Yvette Infante Models For Graphic Art Classes, Likes to Sing, Ski, Cook, Wear Crazy Clothes
## 
### STU FITCH 
There is more in the Graphic Art
Building than meets the average
eye. In fact it is a very select group
who have the chance to view the
person of Yvette Infante, who has
been posing for "would-be" Stan
ford artists for the past two years.
She has a never-failing sense of
humor and a continual line of chat
ter that has put many a first-day
Graphic Art 2 pop-eyed rough or
blushing coed at drawing board
ease.
"1 get along with all the boys and
girls," she says.
Born in Marseilles, France, Miss
Infante came to this country in 1919
at the age of 11. Her mother was
French, her father Italian, she says,
but it was from her Spanish-gypsy
grandfather she inherited her red

hair, jolly spirit, and love of travel.
ROYAL ANCESTRY
Miss Infante boasts royal Spanish
ancestry. "Just look up 'Infante' in
the dictionary," says she.
The model has been in the busi
ness for 10 years. At first she posed
in bathing suits, but after a year of
hoofing and warbling in "The
Drunkard" up in the city she
plunged back into modeling—nude.
Every evening she practices poses
for an hour before retiring. This
gives her ideas for sittings, and
helps her to build up a long-session
endurance.
When the models decided it was
high time to unionize, Miss Infante
was one of the ringleaders of the
San Francisco group. Organization
plans coincided with fall quarter's
finals, and G.A. 2 students did a

final penciling of a draped chair.
LIKES TO COOK
Miss Infante designs her own
clothes, and makes her own shoes
and hats. She is a whistler and a
singer. Her hobby is cooking, and
she "loves" to have people over for
dinner. Every weekend during the
winter months she took off for the
ski fields, and whenever there is a
good fight in town she wants to be
there rooting.
The model admits she dresses dif
ferently than most people, but does
not care. The crazier the better, and
people like her for it.
She poses on the average of nine
hours a day. Sittings begin at 9 in
the morning, break for meals and
rest periods, and when 10 p.m. rolls
around she is ready to put on some
clothes and do the town.

"I'm out every single night," she
says.
The model has had two tries at
marriage, but she is "single now,
thank God."
D!I) UNDERCOVER WORK
During the war she did under
cover work with the F. 8.1. "But we
don't talk about that," she warned.
She also visited service camps with
the U. 5.0., and the boys at Camp
Bell voted her their pin-up girl in
1943.
Miss Infante says she has enjoyed
her life in spite of its ups and downs,
but there is one thing she would
really like to do —read and write
English.
"I speak Spanish, Italian, a little
French," says she, "but I kill the
American language."

don't talk about that," she warned.
She also visited service camps with
the U. 5.0., and the boys at Camp
Bell voted her their pin-up girl in
1943.
Miss Infante says she has enjoyed
her life in spite of its ups and downs,
but there is one thing she would
really like to do —read and write
English.
"I speak Spanish, Italian, a little
French," says she, "but I kill the
American language."
There is more in the Graphic Art
Building than meets the average
eye. In fact it is a very select group
who have the chance to view the
person of Yvette Infante, who has
been posing for "would-be" Stan
ford artists for the past two years.
She has a never-failing sense of
humor and a continual line of chat
ter that has put many a first-day
Graphic Art 2 pop-eyed rough or
blushing coed at drawing board
ease.
"1 get along with all the boys and
girls," she says.
Born in Marseilles, France, Miss
Infante came to this country in 1919
at the age of 11. Her mother was
French, her father Italian, she says,
but it was from her Spanish-gypsy
grandfather she inherited her red

hair, jolly spirit, and love of travel.
ROYAL ANCESTRY
Miss Infante boasts royal Spanish
ancestry. "Just look up 'Infante' in
the dictionary," says she.
The model has been in the busi
ness for 10 years. At first she posed
in bathing suits, but after a year of
hoofing and warbling in "The
Drunkard" up in the city she
plunged back into modeling—nude.
Every evening she practices poses
for an hour before retiring. This
gives her ideas for sittings, and
helps her to build up a long-session
endurance.
When the models decided it was
high time to unionize, Miss Infante
was one of the ringleaders of the
San Francisco group. Organization
plans coincided with fall quarter's
finals, and G.A. 2 students did a

final penciling of a draped chair.
LIKES TO COOK
Miss Infante designs her own
clothes, and makes her own shoes
and hats. She is a whistler and a
singer. Her hobby is cooking, and
she "loves" to have people over for
dinner. Every weekend during the
winter months she took off for the
ski fields, and whenever there is a
good fight in town she wants to be
there rooting.
The model admits she dresses dif
ferently than most people, but does
not care. The crazier the better, and
people like her for it.
She poses on the average of nine
hours a day. Sittings begin at 9 in
the morning, break for meals and
rest periods, and when 10 p.m. rolls
around she is ready to put on some
clothes and do the town.

"I'm out every single night," she
says.
The model has had two tries at
marriage, but she is "single now,
thank God."
D!I) UNDERCOVER WORK
During the war she did under
cover work with the F. 8.1. "But we
don't talk about that," she warned.
She also visited service camps with
the U. 5.0., and the boys at Camp
Bell voted her their pin-up girl in
1943.
