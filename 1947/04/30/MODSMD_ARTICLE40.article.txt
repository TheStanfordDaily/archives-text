### MAX DUNAWAY 
A tanned, cui ly-hfiired English
man in field jacket and shorts ped
alled his bicycle onto the campus
yesterday and announced he had
just completed 11,500 miles of an
expected 20,000 or 25,000 mile tour.
He was Eric J. Cooke, 117-year-old
tool-and-die maker of London, who
used to dream of a world cycling
tour as he worked at his lactory
bench.
Thirteen months ago he began to
make that dream come true.
Purchasing a three-gear British
sports bike with rim brakes and
drop handle bars, he set ofl with two
cameras and a camp kit. The kit
included a tent, ground sheet, down
felt sleeping bag, gas stove, can
teen, and food. Bicycle and camp
kil weighed a total of 05 pounds.
Leaving his London home March
4, 1!)4G, he pedalled through Wales.
Scotland, Ireland, and Eire on a
4,G00 mile jaunt.
Not satisfied with such a short
trip, Mr. Cooke took a freighter from
Belfast to New York doing a bit of
incidental cycling while aboard ship
just to keep in trim.
"The first thing I had to learn in
New York," he said with a Cockney
accent, "was to ride on the right side
of Ihe street instead of I he left.
After that I got along all right."
Ten hectic days he spent in New
York seeing the sights, broadcasting,
and marvelling at the hoi' ht of the

skyscrapers. Then he was ofT
through the Adirondacks on his way
to Canada. He cycled as far as Wind
sor, G'nt., then reentered the States
at Detroit.
At the mention of Detroit the
1 healthy looking Britisher sighed and
perhaps blushed a bit beneath his
I tan.
"It was there," he said, "I met the
very lovely lady who is to be my
| bride next year. She is one of the
leaders of the American Youth Hos
tel in Detroit. For her I gave up
cycling for a week."
The week was soon past, and Mi'.
Cooke was off for Chicago, where he
appeared on Don McNeil's breakfast
club.
"I thought Chicago had the finest
I view I had ever seen," he said, "but
| that was before I looked down on
j San Francisco from the top of a
| hill."
Through St. Louis, through the
Ozarks of Missouri and Arkansas,
on into the wide reaches of the
Texas plains, the sturdy-legged Eng
| lishrnan made his way.
"I won't mention any places, but
i there are some pretty drab stretches
in parts of this country," he com
mented ruefully.
But "drab stretches" could not
stop him. New Mexico and Arizona
ground away beneath the second
pair of bike tiresiâ€”he had to change
j after 6,500 miles. By Christmas, less
than five months after leaving New

York, Mr. Cooke was in Hollywood, j
He had averaged about 1,000 miles a
month so far on his tour.
Asked what were his chief impres
sions of America, he replied: "The
great hospitality I find here and the
wonderful sights. The Ozarks were
beautiful and so is California."
From here the cyclist will go to
Yoseniite, Tahoe, Crater Lake, Port
land, Seattle on through the great
Northwest.
In July the girl from Detroit will
meet him for a bicycle tour through
the Canadian Rockies.
'I lien in the spring of '48 the two
will do a comprehensive bike tour
through the United States. The hap
py ending will be in New Zealand
where the Cookes will settle down
and put the bicycles in storage.
Mr. Cooke is staying at the Hidden
Villa Ranch Youth Hostel in Los
Altos. He expects to leave for Yo
seniite tomorrow or Friday.
