# Bull Session For Kiddies
## 
### UNCLE DAN 
Gather round, kiddies, and lis- j
ten to the story of Cinderella.
Cindy was a typical Stanford girl
—no better, no worse. But she j
never had any dates. She knew all |
about the ratio and all that, but it j
never seemed to do her any good.
She was s the only girl on campus
who didn't have a Cadillac, so she
was a social leopard. Leper. Maybe
I mean lemon.
It was frustrating, to say the
least. Every night her roommate
would go up to the Top o' the Mark,
or the Barbizon Room, or Finno
chio's, or maybe even Belt's Oasis— j
but she never went anywhere but
the libe. She knew that the house
in which Napoleon was born on
Corsica had outside plumbing, and
that Alexander the great got to be
king because his old man got his
skull laid open during a drunken
family brawl, but she had no con- j
ception of how to throw a Stanford
rough out at first base. She'd never
had the opportunity to learn.
TANGLED TRESSES
Sometimes she used to stand nnd j
look at herself in the mirror. She !
was no different from anyone else, |
she saw. She let her hair flop down j
over her shoulders and wave its j
tangled tresses in the wind, like j
the others. When she changed her i
hairdo she employed a stringy up- I
swont. like the others.
TVVO-INCII NAILS
Her nails were always two inches j
long and the color of coagulated j
calves' blood, and her toes were too. j
Her dresses came down halfway be- ;
tween her ankles and her knees,
i ust. like the others. When she
1 wasn't weal ing dresses she wore j
floppy pedal pushers or rolled-up
jeans, like the others.
Her glasses were oblong and
turned up at the outer edges, and j
the frames were always green or j
Durple or some other such color. |
; Nothing odd about that. She used
! lipstick to paint her mouth into
some shape other than its natural
one. Just like the others.
RAINS CAME
This went on until spring quarter
of her senior year, and she was des
perate. But one clay she was walk- ]
ing in the hills back of the golf j
course, feeling sorry for herself,, and I
it started to rain. It rained some
thing awful.
It washed the lipstick ofl' her face [
and left her very own luscious lips j
j visible to the eye. An extra-strong |
| gust of wind snatched away her
classes. Her fingernail polish scaled !
off. Her dress was cotton, and it 1
shrank up to a spot an inch or two
below her knees. Her hair got all
wet.
RAINS WENT
She ran under a tree and stayed
there till Ihe rain stopped. Then
she smoothed her dress, combed the
tangles out of her hair, and headed
for the highway. She got there just
as a battered old Model A went past.
It screeched to a halt and the young
man driving it opened the door.
"This is awful," she thought.
"This is the first time since I've been
I at Stanford that I've been in a car
{ with a boy. and I look a fright—
not like a Stanford woman at all."
But he looked at her and said,
j "You know, you're the first natural-
I looking girl I've ever seen around
here. You're beautiful."
To make a long story short, they
graduated in June and got married
right away, and now they have 10
I children.
Moral: A pigeon dressed in pedal
I pushers doesn't look like much.
