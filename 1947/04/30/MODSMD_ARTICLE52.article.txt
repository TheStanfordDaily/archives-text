# Convalescent Home Now in Thirtieth Year; Farm Atmosphere Ideal for Recuperation
## 
### MARY KRAFT 
In 1917 a group of Stanford stu
dents, under the direction of Dr. D.
Charles Gardner, started a summer
home for children in the Stanfords'
old home, and thus the Farm's own
charity institution was begun.
Two years later the home was
turned into a Convalescent Home
for children from San Francisco
hospitals. At first there were a few
children with one practical nurse,
but the results were good, as the
Farm atmosphere seemed to be just
what the city children needed for
recuperation. So donations were
sought and soon there were means
for the accommodation of 20 chil
dren with a graduate nurse and her
assistants.
The McLaughlin unit, which is
now used for the boys, was donated
by Henry J. Crocker in 1923, and

has 20 beds in the main ward and
seven in the admission ward, which
was added in 1928.
Mrs. Harry Babeock's will left
$40,000 for a third unit', which is
used for iris and was built in 1932.
The final unit was donated by the
Ladies' Auxiliary Board in 1927 and
now houses 30 children who are
able to be out of bed part of the
time. x
The Stanford Convalescent Home
was incoiporated in 1!:24 and is a
non - profit organization under a
Board of Directors, purely for char
ily.
The educational system of public
school work is carried on by three
teachers who give the children a
full-time school program. A teacher
has been assigned to each unit, and
they have succeeded in adapting the

school program to the vitality and
i interest of convalescent pupils.
The summer school session was
conducted during 1945. A teacher
was assigned to each of the two
j units for a period of eight weeks.
The results attained were very en
; couraging. The department is under
I the supervision of the Palo Alto
Board of Education. The mainten-
J ance is shaied by state aid and the
charges made on the school district
from which the children come.
Thirteen student nurses from the
! Stanford University School of Nurs
ing serve for one month each, ob
taining experience in the care of con
valescent children and taking ad
> vance work in pediatrics. The course
! includes six lectures, assigned read
i administrative experience, new
! nursing procedures, and a case study.
