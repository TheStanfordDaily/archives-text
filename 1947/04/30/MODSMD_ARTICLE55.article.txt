### DEE KEATLEY 
Twenty-five years ago Friday the
first charity drive for the Stanford
Convalescent Home for Children
was inaugurated. For the first time
students were asked to contribute
to the monthly expense of main
taining the Rome, usually raised by
charity contributions from other
sources. No particular goal was set
for the drive.
Con Home hen- fits at this time
included a Masque Ball, the profits
of which went to the Con Home
fund, and the annual Labor Day be
gun in 192.), when the Home was
created, for tlr purpose of "having
the students put the grounds around
the residence in condition for the
Home."

The grand sum of $1,.">00 4- $500
ov?r the sot vo;.1 was raised in the
1'.;2'6 drive. The money, rais ed for the
first time through separate organi
zations. helped pay o f T a Con Home
debt. An original innovation to the
Labor Day entertainment was a
Greek vaudeville show given at the
Home after the- barbecue.
Nineteen twenty-r.ine was the best
year yet, with a drive netting $4,000
-$2,116 of which came from the
students and faculty, the remainder
from oil campus.
AT vson: BALL SUCCESS
Tag sales and elections for the
Masque Ball King and Queen were
added to the drive activities in 1930,
supplementing the Masque Bali and
Labor Day. Red and white tags
were sold for 10 cents by "beauti
ful young ladies from Roble." The
ballots for the King and Queen elec
tions were sold for one cent apiece
and tlr- winning contestants were
unmasked in the middle of the
dance. The goal which' was to top
the 1929 record was missed by $500.
The women contributed an average
of 52.72 per person; the men gave
only ;i8 cents per person.
BEAN DAY IN 'UJJ
Bean Day first made its appear
ance in 19315. On this day students
ate only beans and apples for lunch,
the 30 cents per person saved going
to the Con Home fund. However,
Strawberry Brunch was served that
afternoon, so the students didn't
starve.
A beard-growing contest and a
"Back to the Farm Day" increased
di ive activities in lf'4l. Cn the day
after Labor Day all students were
required to wear old-fashioned or
rustic clothes, preferably in the
1890 fashion. No motor vehicles
were allowed on campus and all the
roads were blocked to enforce this
rule. A Gay 90s Dance culminated
the festivities. The drive took in
over $5,000 that vear.
