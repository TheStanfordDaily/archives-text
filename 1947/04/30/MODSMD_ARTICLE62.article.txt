# 'Stanford Rooters' at Con Home Like Movies, Annual Visit of 'Boys, Girls'
## 
### PAULA NUSSER 
Only a fifteen minute bicycle drive from the heart of the cam
; pus are 80 Stanford rooters who have never seen the Quad.
There down the shady rocky road that sidrts Stanford's fam
ous cactus garden, mausoleum, and stock farm lies a home
that has meant both health and happiness to hundreds of

for Tuesday evenings. At (his lime
the beds are wheeled down the ramps
to a supper that includes sandwiches
and watermelons.
Stanford co-eds used to hide eggs |
for the children on Easter. lhe
nurses are still laughing over the 1
co-ed who, taking one of the small
boys by the hand, led him over to a
group of his compatriots hunting |
eggs. One of the boys looking up
from his search said in a somewhat !
disgusted voice, "Is she your mo- !
ther?" |
: strange maladies
Although 110 infectious cases are i
allowed in Ihe rest home, the slafl :
has come across some strange mal
adies. There was the case a year ago
oJ Willie "The Banana King." This
little boy, the son of a San Francisco
street car conductor, could cat noth
ing but bananas. On rr .ianksgiving
when every other boy in the Bay
Area was eating turkey, Willie was '
j eating his holiday meal of bananas.
Because of his strange diet on the
holiday, Willie hit every newspaper
in the Bay Area. It is reported late
ly that today Willie is eating quite ,
normally with only a lew bananas
on the side.
The convalescent children always 1
have looked forward to seeing "the
real Stanford kids" that vi: it them
on Labor Day. Last year after Labor !
Day the student body received the
following letter:
I Dear Stanford Students,
I am riteing this letter to thant
I you for cleaning up the yard on j
labour day.
You did a very good job of cloning
the yar and also of claning the road, j
Singei'lly yours,
Elwyn
RED AND WHITE DRESS
The children in the wards look for :
all the world like a group of Stan- j
ford football players garbed in white |
pajamas and red sweaters with red j
j bedroom slippers. Even with their j
j short stays they feel for the home J
somewhat the same loyalty students I
i feel for their alma mater. Here is j

small children.
"The children of California shall
be? our children," Senator Stanford
once said. This spirit, on which this
University was founded, is reflected
in the Stanford » 'onvalescent. Home.
It is only fitting ( vat the rest home
should occupy the Senator's estate.
GIRLS' AND BOYS" UNITS
The boys confined to bed live in j
the McLaughlin unit, girls in the
Babcock unit. The "run-about" chil
dren are housed in the Auxiliary
uni f while the office and staff quar
ters are in what remains of the old
Stanford home, the greater part of
which was destroyed in the 1906
earthquake.
"When are you boys and girls I
coming to see us?" curly-headed '
I Jackie, one of the run-about chil
dren, asked yesterday, taking time
out from a round of tag to talk t >
us. "We can sing almost all the Stan
ford songs now and, gee, will the
band play this year like it did last
year?"
Jackie had a playmate in tow when I
he stopped for the short chat, a bub
bling, dark-eyed little girl of eight
named Thelma. When questioned as
to whether she liked the home, she
replied, "I like to live at the home
best cause I never have to wash
dishes."
! CHARITY SUPPORTED
The children at the home "**_ be
! tween the ages of four and twelve
and rest at the home for an average i
of three months. The rest home is :
entirely supported by charity, the
Community Chest contributing a i
large part. Stanford, in past drives, '
has collected enough money to j
maintain forr beds a year. The cost j
of a bed, ho .vever, has doubled in ,
the past few years—a bed now costs
$5 a uay to maintain.
In the 26 spacious acres al'oted to
the home, the children put on tans as
well as pounds. Their school, which
is accredited with the Paly Elemen
tary Schools, is sometimes held out
of-doors on the porches. Teachers j
come to the bedside of those children !
unable to get about. "Our school I
even has its own report cards," Mrs. j
Ruth Attwoou, H.N., director of the '
home, proudly stated.
LETTER WRITING DAY
Yesterday was letter writing day
at the home. Peeking over the shoul
der of one of the boys in the Mc- j
I Laughlin unit propped up in a sea of
I pillows, we watched him laboriously
I writ ing home to mom and dad -"1 j
hope you have as nice a place to be
j ill in as I have."
The children enjoy all the advan-
I tages of both urban and country life,
in iact, the home might be termed j
a wondrous play-heaven for boys !
I and girls. There is a clubhouse for
j boys, a treehouse for girls plus a
dollhouse of life-size proportions I
i completely furnished.
MOVIES SHOWN
Movies are shown in the wards !
; once a week, and picnics are slated

t letter written by one of their ex
patient.s on arrival home:
Dear Children:
T !iis is my letter of hello! And how
are all of you I am fine and happy
to be here but I miss ail of you kids

tented but you know we love our
dad and our mom but if 1 had no
mommy nor daddy and I had to
choose I would choose yoiu the
nurses and the home.

Sally
