You may think. Stanford's Con
valescent Home is just another
Farm fixture nobody hears about
till his second or third quarter on
campus. You may think so; but if
you do you're wrong.
When the Home's real function is
under food it is easy to see why its
reputation extends far l>eyoncl the
territory whose children it nurses
and who.se charity supports it.

In its field it stands alone â€” a
model for future convalescent
homes which some day will meet a
need modern hospitals are helpless
to answef.

tween two extremes: hospitals and
homes. As Mrs. At wood, director,

valescents lhn.se too healthy to be
happy in hospitals, yet still too run
down to he h"tilthy <"t home.
But Stc nf(>i') Home lor Conva
lescent Children >s, even wider in
.scope than its mine implies. It
