# Injun Varsity, JV Nines Play Today
## 
### LYNN CARMAN 
Stanford's hustling, make-the-breaks ball club gets another
crack at St. Mary's powerful Gaels this afternoon when the boys
from Moraga hit the Sunken Diamond at 3:15 for another make
o;-break game.
Last week it was the Indians who made a trip to play the Gaels,

and a disastrous trip it was. St.
h.ary's got out its biggest bats to
welcome the Indians, and blasted
li'.em out of their fourth place posi
tion in the Coast Intercollegiate
baseball Association standings by
; n 11 to 3 score.
Today, the Indians find themselves
I uck in that fourth place berth by
\ irtue of last Saturday's rugged G to
/in over Southern California while
tlu Gaels were losing to California,
; nd as a result, the two teams will
battle it out all over again.
t aels lose to bears
Last night, the Gaels took a 17 to
(j lashing at the hands of California's
! igh-riding Bears in* a night game, 1
which means that they'll still be
smarting when they arrive at the {
Sunken Diamond today.
The Bear win, incidentally, j
strengthened their lead in the
C.i.B.A. again, for they have yet to I
l:e beaten by a loop team. Several 1
teams have almost turned the trick,
L.;t Cal has always managed to come
Lack and put just enough runs
across to win.
Coach Harry Wolter is sending
Dave Stott to the mound today as the
Indians seek revenge fnr the mis- j
lu.p which occurred last week. Stott
was the boy who the Gaels found i
m )st to their liking, for he had trou- j
ble handling their bunts.
lilAL MAY GO TODAY
St. Mary's Jack Rial, who started
tlie California heartbreaker last week
in which the Bears eked out a one
r in win in the tenth, pitched against
l!.e Farm boys last Tuesday, and it's
likely that he'll go again today.
Rial, who rates among the top

j hurlers in the C.I.B.A., struck out
; no less than 11 Indians last time,
j and if he pitches again today the
1 Indians are going to have to make
j quite an improvement to beat him.
But the Injuns aren't too worried
about Rial's effectiveness today.
They long ago dismissed the 11 to 3
i loss as an accident, and proceeded to
show some real light in their game
| against the Trojans.
WHO'LL CATCH?
Just who is going to catch today
is a question, but the decision falls
between Ward Walk'up and Frank
MacGraw, the two men who have
been sharing the catching burden
all season long. Both men are right
up there when it comes to hitting,
and that's why it's difficult to decide
who to play.
Apart from the catching, the In
| dians will field t»he same squad which
| won for them Saturday. Benny Car
dinally Bob Peters, Buck Brownson,
and Bill Arce will hold clown the
four infield positions again.
In the outfield, George Sloat, Lloyd
' Merriman and Ted Nell will be back
at the positions from which they've
been operating with plenty of punch.
BROWN PLAYS FOR GAELS
The Gaels were unique last week
in that it was the tail end of their
batting order that produced the most
telling base blows, but that doesn't
mean that the top half doesn't have
latent power. Left fielder Bill Van-
Huitt is still the big gun in the St.
Mary's attack.
The Gaels bring with them a player
whose name should be familiar to
Stanford fans—Bill Brown. His
brother, Bob Brown, was the former
Farm baseball star who is now
breaking in with the New York
Yankees this spring. Bill operates
from an outfield position, and he's
one of the keystones in the Gael
attack.
ARNERICH LEADS OFF
Lil Arnerich leads off for the vis
itors, with Van Huitt occupying
the cleanup spot. Jack Buick, short
stop, and Herman Wedemeyer, in
centerfield, bat second and third.
When Stott gets through facing
those four men, he has to fog them
by Brown, first baseman Wels Cal
gan, third baseman Duane Kling,
and catcher Ray White.
Today's game is only the second
meeting between the two teams this
spring, leaving one game to go be
fore the three-game series is com
pleted.
The Indians are scheduled to play
the University of San Francisco
here tomorrow afternoon.
INJUNS OUT FOR WIN
The Indians have sort of a mental
list—they remember the teams that
took them to the cleaners, and wait
until that team comes to town again.
Then it's, "Look out, visitors."
That's the attitude the Gaels are
going to be bucking when they play
today. It's an attitude that's going
to be tough to overcome. The Gaels
might do it—but on their own home
grounds, the Injuns are going to
be a might rough team to beat today.

Stanford's up-and-coming Jayvee baseballers pile into four
cars this afternoon and hie themselves over to Santa Clara to
battle their C.I.B.A. counterparts in the second meeting between
the two teams.
Last week, the Santa Clara Ponies invaded the Sunken Dia
mond. for a game and walked off*

with it by an 8 to 4 count after
blasting two Farm hurlers for two
home rurfs.
Today, the Jayvees are hoping to
reverse the tables in convincing
fashion, and the odds are good that
they might turn the trick.
IS MAKE TRIP
Manager Ed Sheehan and 18 Stan
lord ballplayers are making the trip,
which is their last visit to an enemy
ball park until May 24.
Don Gabrielson is going to start
on the mound for the Farm invaders.
Gabrielson has been one of the
squad's consistently better hurlers,
both in starting and in relief roles.
In the event that the Ponies solve
Gahrielson's offerings, Claude Ros
enberg will probably be the hurler
who will trudge in from the bull
pen to put out the fire. But the In
dians aren't expecting anything of
the sort to happen, however, and
figure to come back with the win
tucked in their collective pockets.
BIG FOUR LEAD ATTACK
The Jayvees will call on the big
bats of John Wallace, Captain Harry
Reichling, shortstop Hal Richardson
and catcher Roger Stilson to pace the
Farm batting attack.
The "big four" have been mighty
active at the plate lately, with their
best effort coming forth when they
scored 16 runs against the Suisun-
Fairfield ball club. Last week, they
could only score four runs against
Santa Clara, but today they'll be
aiming for a higher figure.
OTHER STARTERS
The starting nine is rounded out
with Tom Golden, center field; Don
Lipelt, right field; Ray Winterhalter
or "Shorty" Viole, third base; and
A 1 Yates, first base.
Tomorrow, the Jayvees are sched
uled to play the San Francisco Jun
ior College "B" squad here.

LARRY WOLF has been one of
the Farm's workhorses out on the
I mound this spring. The tall right
hander has racked up three vic
tories against one defeat so far,
but is still looking ahead toward
j breaking the ice in conference

Stanford's hustling, make-the-breaks ball club gets another
crack at St. Mary's powerful Gaels this afternoon when the boys
from Moraga hit the Sunken Diamond at 3:15 for another make
o;-break game.
Last week it was the Indians who made a trip to play the Gaels,

and a disastrous trip it was. St.
h.ary's got out its biggest bats to
welcome the Indians, and blasted
li'.em out of their fourth place posi
tion in the Coast Intercollegiate
baseball Association standings by
; n 11 to 3 score.
Today, the Indians find themselves
I uck in that fourth place berth by
\ irtue of last Saturday's rugged G to
/in over Southern California while
tlu Gaels were losing to California,
; nd as a result, the two teams will
battle it out all over again.
t aels lose to bears
Last night, the Gaels took a 17 to
(j lashing at the hands of California's
! igh-riding Bears in* a night game, 1
which means that they'll still be
smarting when they arrive at the {
Sunken Diamond today.
The Bear win, incidentally, j
strengthened their lead in the
C.i.B.A. again, for they have yet to I
l:e beaten by a loop team. Several 1
teams have almost turned the trick,
L.;t Cal has always managed to come
Lack and put just enough runs
across to win.
Coach Harry Wolter is sending
Dave Stott to the mound today as the
Indians seek revenge fnr the mis- j
lu.p which occurred last week. Stott
was the boy who the Gaels found i
m )st to their liking, for he had trou- j
ble handling their bunts.
lilAL MAY GO TODAY
St. Mary's Jack Rial, who started
tlie California heartbreaker last week
in which the Bears eked out a one
r in win in the tenth, pitched against
l!.e Farm boys last Tuesday, and it's
likely that he'll go again today.
Rial, who rates among the top

j hurlers in the C.I.B.A., struck out
; no less than 11 Indians last time,
j and if he pitches again today the
1 Indians are going to have to make
j quite an improvement to beat him.
But the Injuns aren't too worried
about Rial's effectiveness today.
They long ago dismissed the 11 to 3
i loss as an accident, and proceeded to
show some real light in their game
| against the Trojans.
WHO'LL CATCH?
Just who is going to catch today
is a question, but the decision falls
between Ward Walk'up and Frank
MacGraw, the two men who have
been sharing the catching burden
all season long. Both men are right
up there when it comes to hitting,
and that's why it's difficult to decide
who to play.
Apart from the catching, the In
| dians will field t»he same squad which
| won for them Saturday. Benny Car
dinally Bob Peters, Buck Brownson,
and Bill Arce will hold clown the
four infield positions again.
In the outfield, George Sloat, Lloyd
' Merriman and Ted Nell will be back
at the positions from which they've
been operating with plenty of punch.
BROWN PLAYS FOR GAELS
The Gaels were unique last week
in that it was the tail end of their
batting order that produced the most
telling base blows, but that doesn't
mean that the top half doesn't have
latent power. Left fielder Bill Van-
Huitt is still the big gun in the St.
Mary's attack.
The Gaels bring with them a player
whose name should be familiar to
Stanford fans—Bill Brown. His
brother, Bob Brown, was the former
Farm baseball star who is now
breaking in with the New York
Yankees this spring. Bill operates
from an outfield position, and he's
one of the keystones in the Gael
attack.
ARNERICH LEADS OFF
Lil Arnerich leads off for the vis
itors, with Van Huitt occupying
the cleanup spot. Jack Buick, short
stop, and Herman Wedemeyer, in
centerfield, bat second and third.
When Stott gets through facing
those four men, he has to fog them
by Brown, first baseman Wels Cal
gan, third baseman Duane Kling,
and catcher Ray White.
Today's game is only the second
meeting between the two teams this
spring, leaving one game to go be
fore the three-game series is com
pleted.
The Indians are scheduled to play
the University of San Francisco
here tomorrow afternoon.
INJUNS OUT FOR WIN
The Indians have sort of a mental
list—they remember the teams that
took them to the cleaners, and wait
until that team comes to town again.
Then it's, "Look out, visitors."
That's the attitude the Gaels are
going to be bucking when they play
today. It's an attitude that's going
to be tough to overcome. The Gaels
might do it—but on their own home
grounds, the Injuns are going to
be a might rough team to beat today.

Stanford's up-and-coming Jayvee baseballers pile into four
cars this afternoon and hie themselves over to Santa Clara to
battle their C.I.B.A. counterparts in the second meeting between
the two teams.
Last week, the Santa Clara Ponies invaded the Sunken Dia
mond. for a game and walked off*

with it by an 8 to 4 count after
blasting two Farm hurlers for two
home rurfs.
Today, the Jayvees are hoping to
reverse the tables in convincing
fashion, and the odds are good that
they might turn the trick.
IS MAKE TRIP
Manager Ed Sheehan and 18 Stan
lord ballplayers are making the trip,
which is their last visit to an enemy
ball park until May 24.
Don Gabrielson is going to start
on the mound for the Farm invaders.
Gabrielson has been one of the
squad's consistently better hurlers,
both in starting and in relief roles.
In the event that the Ponies solve
Gahrielson's offerings, Claude Ros
enberg will probably be the hurler
who will trudge in from the bull
pen to put out the fire. But the In
dians aren't expecting anything of
the sort to happen, however, and
figure to come back with the win
tucked in their collective pockets.
BIG FOUR LEAD ATTACK
The Jayvees will call on the big
bats of John Wallace, Captain Harry
Reichling, shortstop Hal Richardson
and catcher Roger Stilson to pace the
Farm batting attack.
The "big four" have been mighty
active at the plate lately, with their
best effort coming forth when they
scored 16 runs against the Suisun-
Fairfield ball club. Last week, they
could only score four runs against
Santa Clara, but today they'll be
aiming for a higher figure.
OTHER STARTERS
The starting nine is rounded out
with Tom Golden, center field; Don
Lipelt, right field; Ray Winterhalter
or "Shorty" Viole, third base; and
A 1 Yates, first base.
Tomorrow, the Jayvees are sched
uled to play the San Francisco Jun
ior College "B" squad here.

Stanford's hustling, make-the-breaks ball club gets another
crack at St. Mary's powerful Gaels this afternoon when the boys
from Moraga hit the Sunken Diamond at 3:15 for another make
o;-break game.
Last week it was the Indians who made a trip to play the Gaels,

and a disastrous trip it was. St.
h.ary's got out its biggest bats to
welcome the Indians, and blasted
li'.em out of their fourth place posi
tion in the Coast Intercollegiate
baseball Association standings by
; n 11 to 3 score.
Today, the Indians find themselves
I uck in that fourth place berth by
\ irtue of last Saturday's rugged G to
/in over Southern California while
tlu Gaels were losing to California,
; nd as a result, the two teams will
battle it out all over again.
t aels lose to bears
Last night, the Gaels took a 17 to
(j lashing at the hands of California's
! igh-riding Bears in* a night game, 1
which means that they'll still be
smarting when they arrive at the {
Sunken Diamond today.
The Bear win, incidentally, j
strengthened their lead in the
C.i.B.A. again, for they have yet to I
l:e beaten by a loop team. Several 1
teams have almost turned the trick,
L.;t Cal has always managed to come
Lack and put just enough runs
across to win.
Coach Harry Wolter is sending
Dave Stott to the mound today as the
Indians seek revenge fnr the mis- j
lu.p which occurred last week. Stott
was the boy who the Gaels found i
m )st to their liking, for he had trou- j
ble handling their bunts.
lilAL MAY GO TODAY
St. Mary's Jack Rial, who started
tlie California heartbreaker last week
in which the Bears eked out a one
r in win in the tenth, pitched against
l!.e Farm boys last Tuesday, and it's
likely that he'll go again today.
Rial, who rates among the top

j hurlers in the C.I.B.A., struck out
; no less than 11 Indians last time,
j and if he pitches again today the
1 Indians are going to have to make
j quite an improvement to beat him.
But the Injuns aren't too worried
about Rial's effectiveness today.
They long ago dismissed the 11 to 3
i loss as an accident, and proceeded to
show some real light in their game
| against the Trojans.
WHO'LL CATCH?
Just who is going to catch today
is a question, but the decision falls
between Ward Walk'up and Frank
MacGraw, the two men who have
been sharing the catching burden
all season long. Both men are right
up there when it comes to hitting,
and that's why it's difficult to decide
who to play.
Apart from the catching, the In
| dians will field t»he same squad which
| won for them Saturday. Benny Car
dinally Bob Peters, Buck Brownson,
and Bill Arce will hold clown the
four infield positions again.
In the outfield, George Sloat, Lloyd
' Merriman and Ted Nell will be back
at the positions from which they've
been operating with plenty of punch.
BROWN PLAYS FOR GAELS
The Gaels were unique last week
in that it was the tail end of their
batting order that produced the most
telling base blows, but that doesn't
mean that the top half doesn't have
latent power. Left fielder Bill Van-
Huitt is still the big gun in the St.
Mary's attack.
The Gaels bring with them a player
whose name should be familiar to
Stanford fans—Bill Brown. His
brother, Bob Brown, was the former
Farm baseball star who is now
breaking in with the New York
Yankees this spring. Bill operates
from an outfield position, and he's
one of the keystones in the Gael
attack.
ARNERICH LEADS OFF
Lil Arnerich leads off for the vis
itors, with Van Huitt occupying
the cleanup spot. Jack Buick, short
stop, and Herman Wedemeyer, in
centerfield, bat second and third.
When Stott gets through facing
those four men, he has to fog them
by Brown, first baseman Wels Cal
gan, third baseman Duane Kling,
and catcher Ray White.
Today's game is only the second
meeting between the two teams this
spring, leaving one game to go be
fore the three-game series is com
pleted.
The Indians are scheduled to play
the University of San Francisco
here tomorrow afternoon.
INJUNS OUT FOR WIN
The Indians have sort of a mental
list—they remember the teams that
took them to the cleaners, and wait
until that team comes to town again.
Then it's, "Look out, visitors."
That's the attitude the Gaels are
going to be bucking when they play
today. It's an attitude that's going
to be tough to overcome. The Gaels
might do it—but on their own home
grounds, the Injuns are going to
be a might rough team to beat today.

Stanford's up-and-coming Jayvee baseballers pile into four
cars this afternoon and hie themselves over to Santa Clara to
battle their C.I.B.A. counterparts in the second meeting between
the two teams.
Last week, the Santa Clara Ponies invaded the Sunken Dia
mond. for a game and walked off*

with it by an 8 to 4 count after
blasting two Farm hurlers for two
home rurfs.
Today, the Jayvees are hoping to
reverse the tables in convincing
fashion, and the odds are good that
they might turn the trick.
IS MAKE TRIP
Manager Ed Sheehan and 18 Stan
lord ballplayers are making the trip,
which is their last visit to an enemy
ball park until May 24.
Don Gabrielson is going to start
on the mound for the Farm invaders.
Gabrielson has been one of the
squad's consistently better hurlers,
both in starting and in relief roles.
In the event that the Ponies solve
Gahrielson's offerings, Claude Ros
enberg will probably be the hurler
who will trudge in from the bull
pen to put out the fire. But the In
dians aren't expecting anything of
the sort to happen, however, and
figure to come back with the win
tucked in their collective pockets.
BIG FOUR LEAD ATTACK
The Jayvees will call on the big
bats of John Wallace, Captain Harry
Reichling, shortstop Hal Richardson
and catcher Roger Stilson to pace the
Farm batting attack.
The "big four" have been mighty
active at the plate lately, with their
best effort coming forth when they
scored 16 runs against the Suisun-
Fairfield ball club. Last week, they
could only score four runs against
Santa Clara, but today they'll be
aiming for a higher figure.
OTHER STARTERS
The starting nine is rounded out
with Tom Golden, center field; Don
Lipelt, right field; Ray Winterhalter
or "Shorty" Viole, third base; and
A 1 Yates, first base.

Stanford's hustling, make-the-breaks ball club gets another
crack at St. Mary's powerful Gaels this afternoon when the boys
from Moraga hit the Sunken Diamond at 3:15 for another make
o;-break game.
Last week it was the Indians who made a trip to play the Gaels,

and a disastrous trip it was. St.
h.ary's got out its biggest bats to
welcome the Indians, and blasted
li'.em out of their fourth place posi
tion in the Coast Intercollegiate
baseball Association standings by
; n 11 to 3 score.
Today, the Indians find themselves
I uck in that fourth place berth by
\ irtue of last Saturday's rugged G to
/in over Southern California while
tlu Gaels were losing to California,
; nd as a result, the two teams will
battle it out all over again.
t aels lose to bears
Last night, the Gaels took a 17 to
(j lashing at the hands of California's
! igh-riding Bears in* a night game, 1
which means that they'll still be
smarting when they arrive at the {
Sunken Diamond today.
The Bear win, incidentally, j
strengthened their lead in the
C.i.B.A. again, for they have yet to I
l:e beaten by a loop team. Several 1
teams have almost turned the trick,
L.;t Cal has always managed to come
Lack and put just enough runs
across to win.
Coach Harry Wolter is sending
Dave Stott to the mound today as the
Indians seek revenge fnr the mis- j
lu.p which occurred last week. Stott
was the boy who the Gaels found i
m )st to their liking, for he had trou- j
ble handling their bunts.
lilAL MAY GO TODAY
St. Mary's Jack Rial, who started
tlie California heartbreaker last week
in which the Bears eked out a one
r in win in the tenth, pitched against
l!.e Farm boys last Tuesday, and it's
likely that he'll go again today.
Rial, who rates among the top

j hurlers in the C.I.B.A., struck out
; no less than 11 Indians last time,
j and if he pitches again today the
1 Indians are going to have to make
j quite an improvement to beat him.
But the Injuns aren't too worried
about Rial's effectiveness today.
They long ago dismissed the 11 to 3
i loss as an accident, and proceeded to
show some real light in their game
| against the Trojans.
WHO'LL CATCH?
Just who is going to catch today
is a question, but the decision falls
between Ward Walk'up and Frank
MacGraw, the two men who have
been sharing the catching burden
all season long. Both men are right
up there when it comes to hitting,
and that's why it's difficult to decide
who to play.
Apart from the catching, the In
| dians will field t»he same squad which
| won for them Saturday. Benny Car
dinally Bob Peters, Buck Brownson,
and Bill Arce will hold clown the
four infield positions again.
In the outfield, George Sloat, Lloyd
' Merriman and Ted Nell will be back
at the positions from which they've
been operating with plenty of punch.
BROWN PLAYS FOR GAELS
The Gaels were unique last week
in that it was the tail end of their
batting order that produced the most
telling base blows, but that doesn't
mean that the top half doesn't have
latent power. Left fielder Bill Van-
Huitt is still the big gun in the St.
Mary's attack.
The Gaels bring with them a player
whose name should be familiar to
Stanford fans—Bill Brown. His
brother, Bob Brown, was the former
Farm baseball star who is now
breaking in with the New York
Yankees this spring. Bill operates
from an outfield position, and he's
one of the keystones in the Gael
attack.
ARNERICH LEADS OFF
Lil Arnerich leads off for the vis
itors, with Van Huitt occupying
the cleanup spot. Jack Buick, short
stop, and Herman Wedemeyer, in
centerfield, bat second and third.
When Stott gets through facing
those four men, he has to fog them
by Brown, first baseman Wels Cal
gan, third baseman Duane Kling,
and catcher Ray White.
Today's game is only the second
meeting between the two teams this
spring, leaving one game to go be
fore the three-game series is com
pleted.
The Indians are scheduled to play
the University of San Francisco
here tomorrow afternoon.
INJUNS OUT FOR WIN
The Indians have sort of a mental
list—they remember the teams that
took them to the cleaners, and wait
until that team comes to town again.
Then it's, "Look out, visitors."
That's the attitude the Gaels are
going to be bucking when they play
today. It's an attitude that's going
to be tough to overcome. The Gaels
might do it—but on their own home
grounds, the Injuns are going to
be a might rough team to beat today.

Stanford's up-and-coming Jayvee baseballers pile into four
cars this afternoon and hie themselves over to Santa Clara to
battle their C.I.B.A. counterparts in the second meeting between
the two teams.
Last week, the Santa Clara Ponies invaded the Sunken Dia
mond. for a game and walked off*

with it by an 8 to 4 count after
blasting two Farm hurlers for two
home rurfs.
Today, the Jayvees are hoping to
reverse the tables in convincing
fashion, and the odds are good that
they might turn the trick.
IS MAKE TRIP
Manager Ed Sheehan and 18 Stan
lord ballplayers are making the trip,
which is their last visit to an enemy
ball park until May 24.
Don Gabrielson is going to start
on the mound for the Farm invaders.
Gabrielson has been one of the
squad's consistently better hurlers,
both in starting and in relief roles.
In the event that the Ponies solve
Gahrielson's offerings, Claude Ros
enberg will probably be the hurler
who will trudge in from the bull
pen to put out the fire. But the In
dians aren't expecting anything of
the sort to happen, however, and
figure to come back with the win
tucked in their collective pockets.
BIG FOUR LEAD ATTACK
The Jayvees will call on the big
bats of John Wallace, Captain Harry
Reichling, shortstop Hal Richardson
and catcher Roger Stilson to pace the
Farm batting attack.
The "big four" have been mighty
active at the plate lately, with their
best effort coming forth when they
