The lid should be about ready to
blow off the Pacific Coast Confer
ence. The four southern schools,
Stanford, Cal, U.S.C., and U.C.L.A.,
should see that something is done
about the feeble 10-school football
setup, with teams haphazardly scat
tered from Los Angelas to Missoula,
Montana.
Too often great football teams
have journeyed to (he great North
west to be '"upset" by mediocre
northern teams. Too many times it
was rain and a muddy field that did
the "upsetting."
Idaho and Montana, which never
have been and probably never will
be able to compete on even terms
with the California institutions, do
not belong in the same league.
The strong California independ
ents, Santa Clara, St. Mary's, and
Universtiy of San Francisco, and
nossibly Loyola of Los Angeles,
have always been left out in the
cold when Rose Bowl time came
around, and have had to beg for
games wilh the Conference schools.
These schools should be admitted to
the Arroyo Seco scramble by tie
ing them in closely with the four
southern schools in the P.C.C.
By splitting the conference, as is
done in basketball, the problem
could be smoothed over satisfacto
rily. The Northern Division would
include Washington, Washington
State, Oregon State, Oregon, and
Nevada.
The Southern Division would in
clude Stanford. Cal, Southern Cal,
U.C.LA., Santa Clara, St. Mary's,
and U.S.F. Every year the southern
teams would schedule at least five
of the other California schools and
at least one team in the northern
fjroup. This would he a minimum
of six conference games.
Each northern section team would
play all the northern schools, and
would bo guaranteed at least, one
game every year in San Francisco
or Los Angeles.
Nevada, although not geographi
cally in the northern group, would
be able to compete evenly with the
other schools in the group.
The winners of the two divisions
would meet in a playoff game to de
cide the Coast's Rose Bowl repre
sentative.
