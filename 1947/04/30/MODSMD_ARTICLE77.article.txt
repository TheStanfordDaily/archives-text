# JV Net Team Battles San Jose
## 
### BOB BULLOCK 
Stanford's undefeated Junior
Varsity tennis players step into
the big league competition this
afternoon as they play host to
the San Jose State Varsity.
Action on the local courts is slated
tor 2:30 p.m.
Up to now, the sassy Indian
youngsters have been content
with slapping down near-by Junior
Colleges. San Mateo and Menlo have
been among the victims of the Farm
victory march. Today's venture in
to faster company is the high-point
of an excellent J.V. season.
CRUCIAL FOR IJOTII TEAMS
San Jose State has been going no
where in the year's play against col
leges of its own size. Thus the Spar
tans are hungry for a victory scalp
over the pint-sized Indians. The lo
cals will be striving just as desper
ately to show their undefeated
standing is no fluke.
Seeded number one for the San
Jose match is Lucien Barbour, the
outstanding Freshman on the entire
net squad. Barbour operates at the
second doubles position in Varsity
competition as well as holding down
the sixth Varsity singles at the last
count.
Norm Christensen has captured
second billing for todays matches
on the strength of his batlling chop
stroke attack. Third slot falls to Tom
Huffman of the Village.
FRESHMEN STAR
Eneina dominates the three re
maining positions on the J.V. team.
Lanky Ed McGanney plays in fourth
place, while Dick Kilner is listed for
fifth. The sixth place goes to Jack
Frost who played on last year's
varsity.
Doubles pairings have been made,
but no rankings have been decided
upon as yet. Fred Lewis joins Bar
bour in what looks to he the team to
get the first call by Coach Bugge.
McGanney and Kilner make up an
other possible team, while Walker
Wallace pairs with Tom Huffman to
round out the entries.
CALIFORNIA NEXT
Next opponent for the J.V.'s will
be the California Junior Varsity as
an early morning preliminary to
Saturday's Varsity clash with Cal.
Both matches are slated for the
Berkeley courts.
