Women, either junior or seniors, who wish
to become sponsors at Roble next year must
file an application in the A.S.S.U. office by
today at 5 p.m. Then Sponsor Choosing Com
mittee will interview early next week all those
women who apply and choose from cmong
them next year's sponsors.
Sponsors are important because through
them new Stanford women will learn about
Stanford—its traditions, goals, and activities.
Freshmen tend to be impressionistic and eas

ily influenced. It is often chiefly through their
sponsor's influence that they decide how they
will spend their next four years here.
It is apparent then, that if we are to have a
freshman class that is lively and interested
in Stanford activities, we must have a lively,
interested of sponsors. We hope that
today's deadline will be met by girls who have
taken an active part in student affairs and
want to help others to do so also. Sponsoring
is one of the greatest services that can be
given to the University.—N.B.
