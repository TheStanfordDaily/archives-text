College, we find, somewhat like married life.
You come here for almost any reason. Either it';; the
handiest campus, or you like its appearance, or it has
prestige and a name. Or maybe it's been arranged
for you by family tradition. You've grown up with
Stanford taken for granted.
Anyway, you come. The first year or two you
endure all the soul-wearing, nerve-shivering adjust
ments appropriate to a honeymoon. You find out how
much you must change to conform to your new situ
ation. And you do most of the changing.
People treat you as if you were an adult. They
demand a lot (or it seems a lot if you're not used to
giving) and they give you a lot if you demand it.
If you live in happy communion with the grad
school of business your children will probably be
numerous and ctisp. If you get along well with the
med school, they will be healthy and prompt. If you
like the English department and they like you, there's

no guarantee hut you may father a book. Ami you
will love it even if no one else does.
On the other hand, maybe you're the indecisive
kind. You shilly-shally from major to major or from
school to school. The consequences are as unfortun
ate as are a number of broken engagements. Shifting
from archeology to French to journalism in three
quarters is like trying to keep up three apartments.
Alter you've been together awhile, you reach
your level of intellectual and social activity, where
you'll probably stay in comfort the rest of your life.
Or else you find that your college hasn't anything
more in the way of ideas or people to stimulate your
interest and you want to go somewhere else.
As Dr. T. amiably said, there is the danger of a
college's spreading its resources too thin. It's like
having a thin-minded husband or wife. He or she
may be good to look at, lively to live with and the
proper tiling to own or belong to, but still may not
be able to provide much of the real stuff we live on.
