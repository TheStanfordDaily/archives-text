### DAN ENDSLEY 
Now thai elections are nearly a week in the past
and over-heated tempers have cooled down some
what, it might be a good idea to take another look
at the I.S.C. question.
Stanford is definitely committed to send two rep
resentatives abroad. The vote was only 40 per cent
and the issue; won by a very narrow margin, but it
won nevertheless. Many people abstained from vot
ing because they couldn't make up their minds; many
of those who voted against I.S.C. did so, not because
they are against an international program at Stan
ford, but because they disliked the plan offered.
Many opponents of the plan fear that its young,

enthusiastic backers expect more
in the way of results than it can
possibly accomplish. They fenr a
normal reaction when these expec
tations are not fulfilled —a reaction
in which the students at Stanford
will retire to the Ivory Tower; in
other words, return to an isolation
ist viewpoint. Isolation in this
country is in ill repute, but it is
not dead; its proponents hope for
a come-back.

That is something we must guard against. This
may be a pessimistic attitude, but it is a fact that
if expectations arc not too high, disappointment will
not be so bitter.
There are two things this summer's trips abroad
can do. As stated by the backers of 1.5.C., they will
serve to set the international ball rolling on the
Stanford Campus They will also give Stanford rep
resentation at two student conferences to be held
abroad this summer.
The first point may have debatable value; the
second is undeniably good. Students are not going
to turn the world upside down, or right all its wrongs
immediately, but such conferences are at least a start
toward better world understanding. There should
be more of them; it's fine that Stanford will be repre
sented.
Only two of the student body can fco abroad, but
if the rest of us here at home expect no more than
we arc likely to get—a small beginning toward bet
ter international student understanding—interna
tionalism at Stanford will be the stronger for it.
