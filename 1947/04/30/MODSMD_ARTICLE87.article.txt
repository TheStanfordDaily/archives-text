To the Editor:
I do not work for the Chappie and I never have.
I think Mr. Endsley is showing a surprising lack
of imagination in devoting two entire columns to a
rather vulvar condemnation of the recent Chappie.
Whether or not the magazine was enjoyable de
pended a great deal on individual taste. I personally
thought it was one of the better Chappies I have
seen, particularly in the short story line.
And the jokes showed an attempt at clean humor,
at least.
The "feud" between the Daily and the Chappie
has traditionally been a fairly friendly one. I think
Endsley's "humorous" poking fun reflects a very
nasty turn of mind and places the Daily in an unfair
position of passing unconstruc'.ive criticism on a
fellow publication.

To the Editor:
Of course it's great fun to play around with gener
alities, such as Barnard ffai tman does in behalf of his
rather admirable (but not necessarily ustifiable) at
titude regarding increases in the subsistence allow
ance of veterans —or, like Donald Do Pledge, to make
a sarcastic offer of "heart-felt sympathies to the poor
veterans who, because of inadequate government al
lowance, have to work part-time to put themselves
through college." But just as a novelty, bow about
looking at the problem in an entirely objective way?
I believe I see a solution whereby Uncle Sam can
save himself almost fifty dollars on Hartman's educa
tion, and Ilartman can achieve his goal much sooner —
all by means of the controversial subsistence in
crease!
In order to be objective, we're going to have to
consider some facts and figures. Unfortunately, I'm
yoint* to have to assume some of them, since my in
formation is not complete; but I think that the as
sumptions are fair ones, and that the principle is
valid even though some figures may not be precise.
1 believe Hartman said that he works 26 hours
per week, which would be about 112 hours per month;
and if he is paid at the basic campus rate (75c per
hour), would amount to some $84 each month. Let's
assume thai his tuition (paid by the V.A.) is $1(56.05
per quarter, and that his other scholastic expenses
would total, at the end, about the same -regardless
of how fast he completed the units. Assume that he
is now taking 15 units of study per quarter. Assume
that he would Le able (and be allowed) to accom
plish 9 more units per quarter, if he devoted each
week's 26 working hours to additional study. I be-

'All letters should be addressed to the editor,
signed and contain address and phone num
ber ol writer. There is no limit on words but
i/ is desirable letters be short and to the poin'.)

lieve Ilartman said it would take him two years
more to achieve his educational goal. Let's assume
that means (as it does for most married veterans) 8
quarters of study—which at 15 units per quarter
would be 120 units.
Now my proposal is simply that Hartman be al
lowed (as additional monthly subsistence) the amount
l,e now must earn by outside work—and that he use
for study the 26 hours per week thus saved. If he
managed an additional 9 units per quarter, for a total
of perhaps 24 units, he could finish the 120 units in
only 5 quarters instead of the 8 quarters planned.
This would allow Hartman to complete the present
worth-while but difficult grind three quarters earlier
than planned—which would undoubtedly delight
both Mr, and Mrs. Hartman. It would also result in
a saving to the V.A., as indicated below:
Cost Under Cost Under
Present Plan: Proposed Plan:
At $!>0 per month At $174 per month
for 2 years: for 15 months:
Subsistence $2160.00 $2610.00
At $166.65 per At $166.65 per
quarter, for 8 quarter for 5
quarters: quarters:
Tuition $1333.20 $ 833.25
TOTAL COST $3493.20 $3443.25
Not so objectively, I'd like to mention that I favor
subsistence increases particularly for veterans with
children (which includes Hartman, but not me), and
for disabled veterans. But even for the ordinary vet
eran, whose position is not nearly so difficult as those
others (yet who feels just as deep an appreciation
for the nation's assistance in economic rehabilitation),
1 do not think it amiss to present for the consideration
of Congress this fact: whatever proportion of the
veteran's living expenses Congress intended should be
supplied by the $90 allowance enacted in 1945, now
the proportion actually supplied is considerably less.
And not so sincerely: as a sop to the persons who
feci (either out of malice, or out of a sincere concep
tion of the conditions necessary for development of
maturity and moral integrity and appreciation, etc.)
that the life of the G.I. student should have a full
share of hardship and trouble, let me suggest that all
of us who haven't otherwise sufficient difficulty and
insecurity should sk«ep on a spike bed at the edge
of a cliff.

Endsley's "humorous" poking fun reflects a very

To the Editor:
Of course it's great fun to play around with gener
alities, such as Barnard ffai tman does in behalf of his
rather admirable (but not necessarily ustifiable) at
titude regarding increases in the subsistence allow
ance of veterans —or, like Donald Do Pledge, to make
a sarcastic offer of "heart-felt sympathies to the poor
veterans who, because of inadequate government al
lowance, have to work part-time to put themselves
through college." But just as a novelty, bow about
looking at the problem in an entirely objective way?
I believe I see a solution whereby Uncle Sam can
save himself almost fifty dollars on Hartman's educa
tion, and Ilartman can achieve his goal much sooner —
all by means of the controversial subsistence in
crease!
In order to be objective, we're going to have to
consider some facts and figures. Unfortunately, I'm
yoint* to have to assume some of them, since my in
formation is not complete; but I think that the as
sumptions are fair ones, and that the principle is
valid even though some figures may not be precise.
1 believe Hartman said that he works 26 hours
per week, which would be about 112 hours per month;
and if he is paid at the basic campus rate (75c per
hour), would amount to some $84 each month. Let's
assume thai his tuition (paid by the V.A.) is $1(56.05
per quarter, and that his other scholastic expenses
would total, at the end, about the same -regardless
of how fast he completed the units. Assume that he
is now taking 15 units of study per quarter. Assume
that he would Le able (and be allowed) to accom
plish 9 more units per quarter, if he devoted each
week's 26 working hours to additional study. I be-

'All letters should be addressed to the editor,
signed and contain address and phone num
ber ol writer. There is no limit on words but
i/ is desirable letters be short and to the poin'.)

lieve Ilartman said it would take him two years
more to achieve his educational goal. Let's assume
that means (as it does for most married veterans) 8
quarters of study—which at 15 units per quarter
would be 120 units.
Now my proposal is simply that Hartman be al
lowed (as additional monthly subsistence) the amount
l,e now must earn by outside work—and that he use
for study the 26 hours per week thus saved. If he
managed an additional 9 units per quarter, for a total
of perhaps 24 units, he could finish the 120 units in
only 5 quarters instead of the 8 quarters planned.
This would allow Hartman to complete the present
worth-while but difficult grind three quarters earlier
than planned—which would undoubtedly delight
both Mr, and Mrs. Hartman. It would also result in
a saving to the V.A., as indicated below:
Cost Under Cost Under
Present Plan: Proposed Plan:
At $!>0 per month At $174 per month
for 2 years: for 15 months:
Subsistence $2160.00 $2610.00
At $166.65 per At $166.65 per
quarter, for 8 quarter for 5
quarters: quarters:
Tuition $1333.20 $ 833.25
TOTAL COST $3493.20 $3443.25
Not so objectively, I'd like to mention that I favor
subsistence increases particularly for veterans with
children (which includes Hartman, but not me), and
for disabled veterans. But even for the ordinary vet
eran, whose position is not nearly so difficult as those
others (yet who feels just as deep an appreciation
for the nation's assistance in economic rehabilitation),
1 do not think it amiss to present for the consideration
of Congress this fact: whatever proportion of the
veteran's living expenses Congress intended should be
supplied by the $90 allowance enacted in 1945, now
the proportion actually supplied is considerably less.
And not so sincerely: as a sop to the persons who
feci (either out of malice, or out of a sincere concep
tion of the conditions necessary for development of
maturity and moral integrity and appreciation, etc.)
that the life of the G.I. student should have a full
share of hardship and trouble, let me suggest that all
of us who haven't otherwise sufficient difficulty and
insecurity should sk«ep on a spike bed at the edge
of a cliff.

I do not work for the Chappie and I never have.
I think Mr. Endsley is showing a surprising lack
of imagination in devoting two entire columns to a
rather vulvar condemnation of the recent Chappie.
Whether or not the magazine was enjoyable de
pended a great deal on individual taste. I personally
thought it was one of the better Chappies I have
seen, particularly in the short story line.
And the jokes showed an attempt at clean humor,
at least.

lowance, have to work part-time to put themselves
through college." But just as a novelty, bow about
looking at the problem in an entirely objective way?
I believe I see a solution whereby Uncle Sam can
save himself almost fifty dollars on Hartman's educa
tion, and Ilartman can achieve his goal much sooner —
all by means of the controversial subsistence in
crease!
In order to be objective, we're going to have to
consider some facts and figures. Unfortunately, I'm
yoint* to have to assume some of them, since my in
formation is not complete; but I think that the as
sumptions are fair ones, and that the principle is
valid even though some figures may not be precise.
1 believe Hartman said that he works 26 hours
per week, which would be about 112 hours per month;
and if he is paid at the basic campus rate (75c per
hour), would amount to some $84 each month. Let's
assume thai his tuition (paid by the V.A.) is $1(56.05
per quarter, and that his other scholastic expenses
would total, at the end, about the same -regardless
of how fast he completed the units. Assume that he
is now taking 15 units of study per quarter. Assume
that he would Le able (and be allowed) to accom
plish 9 more units per quarter, if he devoted each
week's 26 working hours to additional study. I be-

'All letters should be addressed to the editor,
signed and contain address and phone num
ber ol writer. There is no limit on words but
i/ is desirable letters be short and to the poin'.)

lieve Ilartman said it would take him two years
more to achieve his educational goal. Let's assume
that means (as it does for most married veterans) 8
quarters of study—which at 15 units per quarter
would be 120 units.
Now my proposal is simply that Hartman be al
lowed (as additional monthly subsistence) the amount
l,e now must earn by outside work—and that he use
for study the 26 hours per week thus saved. If he
managed an additional 9 units per quarter, for a total
of perhaps 24 units, he could finish the 120 units in
only 5 quarters instead of the 8 quarters planned.
This would allow Hartman to complete the present
worth-while but difficult grind three quarters earlier
than planned—which would undoubtedly delight
both Mr, and Mrs. Hartman. It would also result in
a saving to the V.A., as indicated below:
Cost Under Cost Under
Present Plan: Proposed Plan:
At $!>0 per month At $174 per month
for 2 years: for 15 months:
Subsistence $2160.00 $2610.00

quarter, for 8 quarter for 5
quarters: quarters:
Tuition $1333.20 $ 833.25
TOTAL COST $3493.20 $3443.25
Not so objectively, I'd like to mention that I favor
subsistence increases particularly for veterans with
children (which includes Hartman, but not me), and
for disabled veterans. But even for the ordinary vet
eran, whose position is not nearly so difficult as those
others (yet who feels just as deep an appreciation
for the nation's assistance in economic rehabilitation),
1 do not think it amiss to present for the consideration
of Congress this fact: whatever proportion of the
veteran's living expenses Congress intended should be
supplied by the $90 allowance enacted in 1945, now
the proportion actually supplied is considerably less.
And not so sincerely: as a sop to the persons who
feci (either out of malice, or out of a sincere concep
tion of the conditions necessary for development of
maturity and moral integrity and appreciation, etc.)
that the life of the G.I. student should have a full
share of hardship and trouble, let me suggest that all
of us who haven't otherwise sufficient difficulty and
insecurity should sk«ep on a spike bed at the edge
of a cliff.

I do not work for the Chappie and I never have.
I think Mr. Endsley is showing a surprising lack
of imagination in devoting two entire columns to a
rather vulvar condemnation of the recent Chappie.
Whether or not the magazine was enjoyable de
pended a great deal on individual taste. I personally
thought it was one of the better Chappies I have
seen, particularly in the short story line.
And the jokes showed an attempt at clean humor,
at least.
The "feud" between the Daily and the Chappie
has traditionally been a fairly friendly one. I think
Endsley's "humorous" poking fun reflects a very
nasty turn of mind and places the Daily in an unfair
position of passing unconstruc'.ive criticism on a
fellow publication.
