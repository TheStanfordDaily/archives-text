# House Passes Relief Bill With Appropriation Cut, Anti-Communist Policy
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 30 (UP). —A rebellious House riddled
President Truman's $350,000,000 foreign relief bill with anti-
Communist amendments today, cut it to $200,000,000, and passed
it along to the Senate for final action.
It was a blow to the bi-partisan foreign policy advocated by the Presi
dent, Secretary of State George C. Marshall, and leaders of both parties in
Congress. Administration supporters warned that, unless the money is
restored in the Senate, hungry peoples abroad may be driven into Com-

jnunism.
The House ignored the protests
and rammed the measure through
on a roll call vote of 333 to 66. That
vole was taken after the members
shouted down a motion by Rep. Al
vin E. O'Konski, R., Wis., to shelve
(he entire bill until Marshall reports
formally that his State Department
has been reorganized to "a truly
unti-Communistic policy."
The final House version specifi
cally authorizes the spending of
$200,000,000 to clothe, feed and pro
vide medical care for war victims in
five European countries and China.
Jt would bar all relief to Commu
nist - dominated countries unless
'they permit the help to be distrib
uted by American missions. That
amendment was adopted by a 324 to
75 vote.
Another amendment aimed at
Communist areas authorizes the
President to withhold or end relief
in any country which refuses to
permit United States government
and press representatives to observe
.and report freely on use of tho
American aid.
The recipient states also would be
prohibited from making any war
reparations payments to other
countries while they are getting
American relief.
