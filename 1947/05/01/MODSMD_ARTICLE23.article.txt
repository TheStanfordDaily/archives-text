# Laborers Find Kids' Smiles Cure for Their Aching Backs
## 
### 
It may have started late and it may have been work, but
Labor Day was a success. And by 7 p.m. weary Farm workers
were trudging home to wash up, change clothes, and treat sun
burn, mosquito bites, and poison oak.
All outlined work was done, and approximately 3,500 persons

ran the chow line for their service
of barbecued lamb. The Con Home
kids hoard the band, and their play
ground had another cleanup to tide
it over until next year.
WORK SLOW STARTING
Work started at a siow roll at 1
p.m., but by 3:30 Stanford workers
were invading from all sides. There
were plenty of tools to fill eager
hands until the "aunschluss" when
the supply dwindled and idle "su
pervisors" were left standing on the
side lines.
"The lack of tools was unfortu
nate," said Bob Levison, work
chairman, "but the University was
unable to lend its supply, and
down-town sources could not see
their way clear to call a holiday for
their workers in the middle of the
week."
"But we got everything done," he
said, "and that is what counts. I
want to thank everyone for turning
out."
FELL THREE TREES
Farm laborers felled three trees,
cleaned up the fence along the
creek, pulled weeds, and plowed

garden bods. The playground sand
was sifted, and the tree house put in
ready-for-play order. In fact, the
play area was made tempting
enough to attract Stanford "young
sters" who turned to on swings,
May poles, and sce-saws in the
late afternoon.
Supper time brought added crow
Supper time brought added
crowds and three lines filed into the
barbecue area. Sam McDonald was
on hand to see that the beans were
kept hot, the salad given its proper
toss, and the lamb its proper turn.
SERVE 3,300 WORKERS
Tom Elke, barbecue chairman,
said approximately 3,500 persons
were served by "hashers" recruited
from Roble and Encina.
Dot Hodges, concessions chair
man, reported financial suecess in
coke and ice cream sales, helped
along by hot sun and truck-stirred
dust. Profits to be turned over to
the Con Home fund hit $95, shaming
last year's $24 total.
Remark of the day made by a
Roble freshman: "Gee, this is fun!
Just EVERYBODY is here."

Dot Hodges, concessions chair
man, reported financial suecess in
coke and ice cream sales, helped
along by hot sun and truck-stirred
dust. Profits to be turned over to
the Con Home fund hit $95, shaming
last year's $24 total.
Remark of the day made by a
Roble freshman: "Gee, this is fun!
Just EVERYBODY is here."
It may have started late and it may have been work, but
Labor Day was a success. And by 7 p.m. weary Farm workers
were trudging home to wash up, change clothes, and treat sun
burn, mosquito bites, and poison oak.
All outlined work was done, and approximately 3,500 persons

ran the chow line for their service
of barbecued lamb. The Con Home
kids hoard the band, and their play
ground had another cleanup to tide
it over until next year.
WORK SLOW STARTING
Work started at a siow roll at 1
p.m., but by 3:30 Stanford workers
were invading from all sides. There
were plenty of tools to fill eager
hands until the "aunschluss" when
the supply dwindled and idle "su
pervisors" were left standing on the
side lines.
"The lack of tools was unfortu
nate," said Bob Levison, work
chairman, "but the University was
unable to lend its supply, and
down-town sources could not see
their way clear to call a holiday for
their workers in the middle of the
week."
"But we got everything done," he
said, "and that is what counts. I
want to thank everyone for turning
out."
FELL THREE TREES
Farm laborers felled three trees,
cleaned up the fence along the
creek, pulled weeds, and plowed

garden bods. The playground sand
was sifted, and the tree house put in
ready-for-play order. In fact, the
play area was made tempting
enough to attract Stanford "young
sters" who turned to on swings,
May poles, and sce-saws in the
late afternoon.
Supper time brought added crow
Supper time brought added
crowds and three lines filed into the
barbecue area. Sam McDonald was
on hand to see that the beans were
kept hot, the salad given its proper
toss, and the lamb its proper turn.
SERVE 3,300 WORKERS
Tom Elke, barbecue chairman,
said approximately 3,500 persons
were served by "hashers" recruited
from Roble and Encina.
