Dr. Philip W. Buck, chairman of the Stanford Rhodes Scholarship Se
lection Committee, will conduct a meeting for all potential Rhodes Schol
arship candidates Wednesday at 4:110 p.m. in the West Memorial Library
ol the Political Science Building.
The purpose of the session will be "to discuss with any interested stu-

dentb the qualifications anil proce
dures for obtaining Rhodes Scholar
ships," Dr. Buck said.
"Successful candidates receive
scholarships entitling them to two
years of study at Oxford University
in England."
PREPARATION SUGGESTED
Applications for this year's awards
will not be received until next fall.
Dr. Buck suggests, however, that
those interested in applying should
begin now to direct their college
activities toward the qualifications
sought by the selection committee.
For this reason, freshmen and soph
omores who will not normally apply
until 15)48 or 1949 are especially in
vited.
"Most successful candidates for
these scholarships have had it in
mind during the greater part of
their college careers. Organized
planning for this goal will not dis
tort the student's normal activities
but will increase his chances of se
lection," he stated.
WAR SERVICE SCHOLARSHIPS
Because of the war-caused dis
ruption of academic activities, the
Rhodes Scholarship Committee is
offering 16 War Service Scholar
:.hips in the United States during
each of the next few years in ad
dition to the 32 regular scholarships.
Regular candidates are required
lo be United Slates citizens, un
married, have junior standing in the
University, and to be between 19
and 25 years of age on Oct. 1 of the
year for which they are elected.
Requirements for War Service
candidates differ in that they may
be married, from 19 to 33 years of
age, and have only one year of col
lege. In addition, they must have
spent at least one year in war serv
ice, including draft-exempt civilian
defense work.
CHARACTER CONSIDERED
Primary criteria of selection are
literary and scholastic ability and
attainments, and such qualities as
manhood, truth, courage, and fel
lowship. Also important are moral
force of character, leadership, and
participation in outdoor sports.
For selection purposes, the coun
try is divided into eight districts of
six states each. Each state nomi
nates two regular candidates and
one War Service candidate, a total
of 18 from each district. From these
18, a district committee selects four
regular and two War Service sehol
are to go to Oxford.
Dr. Buck will outline the history
and aims of the scholarships in the
meeting, as well as give assistance
to applicants. Pafticular emphasis
will be placed on the matter of ad
vance preparation.
