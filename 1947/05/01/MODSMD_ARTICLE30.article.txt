## 
### 
Comments on a proposed book ex
change are desired by Alpha Phi
Omega, national service organiza
tion, sponsors of the plan. Ideas
may be telephoned to Dick Lentz,
chairman, at BGB3.
The plan which the group will lay
before Dean John Stalnuker tomor
row is roughly as follows. The ex
change will accept books in good
condition for resale to students at
(it! percent of the original purchase
price.
A card file 1 system will be main
tained. Receipts will be issued to
the owner when books are brought
in; and presentation of the receipt
will entitle owner to the proceeds
of the sale.
A small charge will be made for
the service: for a sale price up to a
dollar, 5 cents; from $1.01 to $3.00,
10 cents; and over $3.00, 15 cents.
