# Aid Group Planning Relief Poll
## 
### 
Final formulation of the plans for
SIRO, Stanford's International Re
lief Organization, have been made
and a questionnaire will be sent to
the entire campus in order to find
j out the student preference in the
| matter of sending relief overseas,
stated the chairmen of the commit
tee, Bill Dirker and Molly Shaw.
PURPOSE OF COMMITTEE
The purpose of the committee as
stated by the chairman is to collect
and disseminate information on the
needs and methods of international
relief.
Through the questionnaire the
committee hopes to discover three
things:
1) What countries the students
want to send relief to.
2) What countries the students do
not want to send relief to.
3) The names of any specific peo
ple in foreign countries who are in
need of relief.
ISC MAY CONTACT A SCHOOL
To further personalize the drive,
the committee hopes to contact a uni
versity in a foreign country which
is in need of aid. This university
could be visited by the I.S.C. repre
sentatives who are going to Europe
this summer. In the fall the I.S.C.
can report on that particular uni
versity, its people and conditions,
and hope to set up exchange scholar
ships by this contact.
Letters have been sent to all cam
pus organizations in regard to their
appointment of a representative to
take charge of relief. Special agents
have been appointed in all living
groups. The agents will send the
materials collected—clothes now and
possibly text books later, as well as
food relief.
PLAN PERSONALIZED RELIEF
5.1.R.0. plans to extend relief on
t a personal basis, remain non-contro-
I versial, and to operate in a contin
uous fashion rather than the sporadic
attempts at relief that have taken
place up until now. Students are
encouraged to contribute throughout
the year to their agents instead of
responding to various uncoordinated
drives.
Assisting the chairmen Bill Kirker
and Molly Shaw are the main repre
j sentatives Ken Carey, Village; Mary
Richards, Halls; Jeff Howe, Row; and
| Subhas Dhar, General. Under the
! Hall category are the representatives:
I Ann Cheney, Branner; Ralph Mil
ller, Toyon; Bill Yates, Encina; Sally
Brown, Roble; June Selder, Lagun
ita; and Betty Rice, Union.

PLAN PERSONALIZED RELIEF
5.1.R.0. plans to extend relief on
t a personal basis, remain non-contro-
I versial, and to operate in a contin
uous fashion rather than the sporadic
attempts at relief that have taken
place up until now. Students are
encouraged to contribute throughout
the year to their agents instead of
responding to various uncoordinated
drives.
Assisting the chairmen Bill Kirker
and Molly Shaw are the main repre
j sentatives Ken Carey, Village; Mary
Richards, Halls; Jeff Howe, Row; and
| Subhas Dhar, General. Under the
! Hall category are the representatives:
I Ann Cheney, Branner; Ralph Mil
ller, Toyon; Bill Yates, Encina; Sally
Brown, Roble; June Selder, Lagun
ita; and Betty Rice, Union.
Final formulation of the plans for
SIRO, Stanford's International Re
lief Organization, have been made
and a questionnaire will be sent to
the entire campus in order to find
j out the student preference in the
| matter of sending relief overseas,
stated the chairmen of the commit
tee, Bill Dirker and Molly Shaw.
PURPOSE OF COMMITTEE
The purpose of the committee as
stated by the chairman is to collect
and disseminate information on the
needs and methods of international
relief.
Through the questionnaire the
committee hopes to discover three
things:
1) What countries the students
want to send relief to.
2) What countries the students do
not want to send relief to.
3) The names of any specific peo
ple in foreign countries who are in
need of relief.
ISC MAY CONTACT A SCHOOL
To further personalize the drive,
the committee hopes to contact a uni
versity in a foreign country which
is in need of aid. This university
could be visited by the I.S.C. repre
sentatives who are going to Europe
this summer. In the fall the I.S.C.
can report on that particular uni
versity, its people and conditions,
and hope to set up exchange scholar
ships by this contact.
Letters have been sent to all cam
pus organizations in regard to their
appointment of a representative to
take charge of relief. Special agents
have been appointed in all living
groups. The agents will send the
materials collected—clothes now and
possibly text books later, as well as
food relief.
