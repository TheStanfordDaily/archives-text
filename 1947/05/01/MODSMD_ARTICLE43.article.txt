# Tracksters Trek South For Bruins
## 
### JOHN HUBBARD 
Stanford's track victim of
three straight defeats at its Angell
Field home, will try its luck on for
eign fields this weekend. The In
dians leave tomorrow, by train, for
Los Angeles, where they are sched
uled to tangle with U.C.L.A.'s Bru
ins at Westwood Saturday after
noon.
The U.C.L.A. meet will be the first
"away from home" venture of the
year for Coach Jack Weiershauser's
charges.
As usual, the Indians will be rated
as underdogs for the meet, with
U.C.L.A. doped to win by some
where in the neighborhood of 10
points.
But that margin is by no means
considered a safe one for the Bruins.
Stanford is very, very hungry for
its first real victory of the campaign,
and will be shooting the works in an
attempt to break into the win col
umn.
CROMWELL'S PREDICTION
And, despite Dean Cromwell's
gloomy prediction to the effect that
Stanford hasn't a ghost of a chance
against the Bruins, the Indians
could conceivably spring an upset.
U.C.L.A. is not a team of many
standout performers. They do have
an excellent hurdler in Craig Dixon
and a topflight discus and shot put
man in Jerry Shipkey, but outside
of those two the Bruins fit into the
"good, not sensational, well - bal
anced" classification.
Dixon will be favored to win both
hurdle races. His best meet time of
the year in the lows is 23.3 (with
the wind behind him), and in the
highs, 14.5.
SHIPKEY CAN WIN TWO
Shipkey should have little trouble
in taking first place in his two fa
vorite events. He has hefted the
shot 51 ft. 10% in. this season, and
is credited with a 200-ft. javelin ef
fort.
Ralph Gold, U.C.L.A. distance
runner, might win both the 880 and
the mile, although he will be hard
pressed by Stanford's George
Grimes in the former and Frank
Ganahl in the latter.
Gold's top marks of the season for
the two races are 1:54.2 and 4:21.0.
The Bruins are noticeably weak
in the sprints. A 1 Kapp is their
leading 100 and 220 runner on the
strength of his just average times
of 10.1 and 22.1. Art Miller, U.C.-
L.A.'s number one quarter - miler,
has done 49.8.
STRONG IN FIELD
But they are relatively strong all
along the line in the field events.
Aside from Shipkey, the Bruins
have:
Davage Minor and Don Barks
dale, stars of U.C.L.A.'s basketball
team, both capable of topping 6 ft.
4 in. in the high jump.
Barksdale and footballer A 1
Hoisch in the broad jumpâ€”Barks
dale can go slightly better than 23
ft. and Hoisch trails him by only
two inches.
Ray Maggard, a 13-ft. G-in. pole
vaulter.
Chuck Page, who can do 142 ft.
in the discus.
Judging entirely from past per
formances, U.C.L.A. should be able
to win all six of the field events,
the relay, both hurdle races, the
mile and two-mile, and the 880.
That would give them a total of GO
first-place points.
TWO POSSIBILITIES
It only takes G6 points to win a
track meet, so the Indians will ei
ther have to grab up almost all the
place and show points plus victories
in the 100, 220, and 440 if they are
to win, or break through the Bruin
domination in the field events and a
lew of the track events.
That either of those possibilities
will materialize does not seem likely
to most observers, but Stanford is
determined to upset the dope sheet
at least once during the season,
and this is as good an opportunity as
any.
