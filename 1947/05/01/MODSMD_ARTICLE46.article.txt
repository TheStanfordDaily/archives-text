## 
### 
Stanford's ball players took the measure of hurler Jack Rial
yesterday afternoon and tagged the Gael's speedball pitcher
for eight hits as they banged out a convincing 4 to 0 decision
over St. Mary's on the Sunken Diampnd.
The Indians got no rest after the victory, however, for today

slated to take on an mvading
San Francisco Junior College nine
at 3:15. Dick Flatland will pitch
for the Indians.
In yesterday's game, Dave Stott
and Larry Wolf teamed up on the
mound as the Indians scored their
1 first conference shutout victory of
the year. Stott retired at the end of
the fifth with a sore arm after get
! ting himself into —and out of—four
I jams, while Wolf had little trouble in
setting the Gaels down on two hits
during the last four innings.
LEVEL SIGHTS
George Sloat, Buck Brownson and
Lloyd Merriman were quick to level
) their sights on Rial, and led the In
dian attack with two hits apiece.
Sloat and Nell both got long triples
and Merriman came through with a
i double.
The Indians grabbed a one-run
lead in the first when Sloat tripled
and scored on a passed ball, and from
that point on the Farm boys were
i never headed.
ADD TWO IN FOURTH
They added two runs in the fourth
and racked up another in the sixth,
and it was too much for the deflated
Gaels, who only last week met an
ofls-form Stanford squad and pinned
the Indians' ears back, 11 to 3.
Nell opened the fourth for the
Farm with a triple, and came in
, when Bob Peters was robbed of a
base hit by the Gael first sacker.
i Then Benny Cardinalli got on base
on an error, went to third on an in
field play and another error, and
scored on Bill Arce's single through
second.
DROPS FLY
The last Cardinal tally came in
the sixth when Buck Brownson
singled and came all the way home
when the Gael's Bill Brown dropped
Merriman's deep fly.
The Gaels tried in vain to break
the scoring ice, but the nearest they
got to scoring a run came when they
loaded the bases in the third with
one out. Rial was forced out at home
on the next play and John Buick
popped to Cardinalli to end the
inning.
St. Mary's had men on third with
two out in the first and second in
nings, and had a man on second with
one out in the fourth. But Stott
always managed to bear down and
retire the side before any real dam
age could be done.

San Francisco Junior College nine
at 3:15. Dick Flatland will pitch
for the Indians.
In yesterday's game, Dave Stott
and Larry Wolf teamed up on the
mound as the Indians scored their
1 first conference shutout victory of
the year. Stott retired at the end of
the fifth with a sore arm after get
! ting himself into —and out of—four
I jams, while Wolf had little trouble in
setting the Gaels down on two hits
during the last four innings.
LEVEL SIGHTS
George Sloat, Buck Brownson and
Lloyd Merriman were quick to level
) their sights on Rial, and led the In
dian attack with two hits apiece.
Sloat and Nell both got long triples
and Merriman came through with a
i double.
The Indians grabbed a one-run
lead in the first when Sloat tripled
and scored on a passed ball, and from
that point on the Farm boys were
i never headed.
ADD TWO IN FOURTH
They added two runs in the fourth
and racked up another in the sixth,
and it was too much for the deflated
Gaels, who only last week met an
ofls-form Stanford squad and pinned
the Indians' ears back, 11 to 3.
Nell opened the fourth for the
Farm with a triple, and came in
, when Bob Peters was robbed of a
base hit by the Gael first sacker.
i Then Benny Cardinalli got on base
on an error, went to third on an in
field play and another error, and
scored on Bill Arce's single through
second.
DROPS FLY
The last Cardinal tally came in
the sixth when Buck Brownson
singled and came all the way home
when the Gael's Bill Brown dropped
Merriman's deep fly.
The Gaels tried in vain to break
the scoring ice, but the nearest they
got to scoring a run came when they
loaded the bases in the third with
one out. Rial was forced out at home
on the next play and John Buick
popped to Cardinalli to end the
inning.
St. Mary's had men on third with
two out in the first and second in
nings, and had a man on second with
one out in the fourth. But Stott
always managed to bear down and
retire the side before any real dam
age could be done.
Stanford's ball players took the measure of hurler Jack Rial
yesterday afternoon and tagged the Gael's speedball pitcher
for eight hits as they banged out a convincing 4 to 0 decision
over St. Mary's on the Sunken Diampnd.
The Indians got no rest after the victory, however, for today
