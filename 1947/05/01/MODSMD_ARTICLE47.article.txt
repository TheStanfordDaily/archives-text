# Netters Test Cal Saturday
## 
### 
Eager for its first Conference net
win, Stanford's battered varsity ten
nis team gets its big chance Satur
day afternoon in the traditional
clash with California. The matches
are to be played in Berkeley, begin
ning at 1:30 p.m.
NIP AND TUCK
The Indian-Bear fracas should be
one of the closest in all competition
between the two teams. Compara
tive scores rate both teams as also
rans in the Conference race. In fact,
their marks against some of the
leading tennis teams of the Coast
are remarkably similar.
U.S.C., on its way to the Confer
ence championship, clipped the In
dians and Bears by the same score,
8-1 And the lone win for the Bay
Area entries came in the same
bracket â€”sixth singles.
Then, against the giant - killing
C.O.P. wonder team, Stanford
opened up the season with a (5-3 loss
to the Tigers. The bears duplicated
the loss when they ran up against
the powerful Stockton team, G-3.
The only edge that comparative
scores show is in the second Indian
outing against C.O.P. Only a great
comeback by the Tigers allowed
them to win out, 5-4. Thus the Stan
ford team enters the matches Sat
urday with a slight statistical edge.
Playing on the Berkeley courts
may handicap the Indians, who have
not been able to salvage a victory
away from home. But with both the
Bears and Indians hoping to break
the ice in the Conference, pre-game
guestimates are of little value.
DOWN SPARTANS
Rolling over the San Jose State
varsity with a minimum of effort,
the Stanford junior varsity tennis
team continued its undefeated sta
tus with a 6-3 win yesterday after
noon. The matches were played on
the local courts.
In their first dip into varsity com
petition, the young Indian netters
clinched the count early in the go
ing and waltzed to an easy triumph.
Next stop on the J.V. sensational
drive is Saturday's meeting at Ber
keley with the powerful California
Cub racketeers.
