# Lawson Little, Bud Brownell Vie for Golfing Honors
## 
### TOM BURDICK 
(Golf as demonstrated by Stan
ford's great teams of the past has
long been regarded as a major sport
by addicts of the Links, the world
over. The current trend on cam
pus is to give this activity its fitting
place in the athletic sun, by officially
recognizing it as a "Major Sport."
The following is the first of a series
of articles written to give Daily
readers an insight into the Farm's
rich golfing lore. —Sports Ed. Note.)
/

Undoubtedly the two greatest
linksters produced here at Stanford,
since the construction of the famed j

course in 1929, are Lawson Little .
and "Bud" Brownell.
The name Lawson Little needs'
no introduction in the golfing world
but his accmplishments while at
tending the "Farm" need some en
lightening to those unfamiliar with
Stanfordiana. Little, while still an
under-grad, surprised the world by
capturing both the British and the
U.S. Arpateur titles for two consecu
tive years (1934 and "35) a feat never
before accomplished or since du
plicated. An interesting sidelight
which makes this achievement all
the more impressive is that Little
I had to battle to hold his position on
the Indian team during those same
years. He played third man a good
deal of tlie time behind Vfcrne
"Spec" Stewart and Jack Hoerner.
The name Brownell not only fails i
to ring the bell in the average duf
fer's headpiece, but brings an in
quisitive shake of the noggin. And
yet it is safe to say that if the cards
had fallen right, he might have gone
on to surpass Little in fame and
ability. Certainly Brownell has done
something in his own right that no
other golfer has accomplished, in
cluding his compatriot.
November 2G, 1941 was an exceed
ingly damp, heavy, day. The sky
threatened to deluge the countryside
as it had done all week long. Nev
ertheless a large gallery congregated

to see the renowned Denny Shute,
just over the peak of his game,
which saw him capture among other
laurels the British and American
Open championships, but still one of
the big names in the golfing fratern
ity, play an exhibition. Brownell,
No. 1 man of the defending N.C.A.A.
championship Stanford linksters, was
to go along as company.
As is so often the case however,
it turned out that Shute was the
one that went along for the ride,
as Brownell, playing unquestionably
the greatest game of his life, fired
nine 3's and an equal number of 4's
for a course shattering total of 63.
The previous record was 65 set in
1938 by Art Doering, now a pro,
but then the Indian's No. 1 man.
With three holes left, Brownell
needed pars to tie Doering's record.
"Bud" sank an 8 ft. putt for a birdie
on the 16th, and continued his magic
work with the putter, by dropping
an extremely difficult curling, down
side-hill effort of some 6 ft. for a
par on the 17th, and topped it off
with a sensational 35 footer for a
birdie on the final hole. The stam
pede which headed for the likeable
Brownell, known as "Elmer" to his
friends, prevented Shute from putt
ing out his round. Commenting
later, Shute said that Brownell's
was the finest round of golf he had
ever seen played in his life, and

added that the course was also one
of the best he had ever played on.
Brownell, a Lt. J.G. in the Navy,
after leaving Stanford, served as a
Boat Officer on a troop transport
until his death resulting from a
Kamikaze attack off Lingayen gulf
during the recent conflict.

rich golfing lore. —Sports Ed. Note.)

Undoubtedly the two greatest
linksters produced here at Stanford,
since the construction of the famed j

course in 1929, are Lawson Little .
and "Bud" Brownell.
The name Lawson Little needs'
no introduction in the golfing world
but his accmplishments while at
tending the "Farm" need some en
lightening to those unfamiliar with
Stanfordiana. Little, while still an
under-grad, surprised the world by
capturing both the British and the
U.S. Arpateur titles for two consecu
tive years (1934 and "35) a feat never
before accomplished or since du
plicated. An interesting sidelight
which makes this achievement all
the more impressive is that Little
I had to battle to hold his position on
the Indian team during those same
years. He played third man a good
deal of tlie time behind Vfcrne
"Spec" Stewart and Jack Hoerner.
The name Brownell not only fails i
to ring the bell in the average duf
fer's headpiece, but brings an in
quisitive shake of the noggin. And
yet it is safe to say that if the cards
had fallen right, he might have gone
on to surpass Little in fame and
ability. Certainly Brownell has done
something in his own right that no
other golfer has accomplished, in
cluding his compatriot.
November 2G, 1941 was an exceed
ingly damp, heavy, day. The sky
threatened to deluge the countryside
as it had done all week long. Nev
ertheless a large gallery congregated

to see the renowned Denny Shute,
just over the peak of his game,
which saw him capture among other
laurels the British and American
Open championships, but still one of
the big names in the golfing fratern
ity, play an exhibition. Brownell,
No. 1 man of the defending N.C.A.A.
championship Stanford linksters, was
to go along as company.
As is so often the case however,
it turned out that Shute was the
one that went along for the ride,
as Brownell, playing unquestionably
the greatest game of his life, fired
nine 3's and an equal number of 4's
for a course shattering total of 63.
The previous record was 65 set in
1938 by Art Doering, now a pro,
but then the Indian's No. 1 man.
With three holes left, Brownell
needed pars to tie Doering's record.
"Bud" sank an 8 ft. putt for a birdie
on the 16th, and continued his magic
work with the putter, by dropping
an extremely difficult curling, down
side-hill effort of some 6 ft. for a
par on the 17th, and topped it off
with a sensational 35 footer for a
birdie on the final hole. The stam
pede which headed for the likeable
Brownell, known as "Elmer" to his
friends, prevented Shute from putt
ing out his round. Commenting
later, Shute said that Brownell's
was the finest round of golf he had
ever seen played in his life, and

added that the course was also one
of the best he had ever played on.
Brownell, a Lt. J.G. in the Navy,
after leaving Stanford, served as a
Boat Officer on a troop transport
until his death resulting from a
Kamikaze attack off Lingayen gulf
during the recent conflict.

no introduction in the golfing world
but his accmplishments while at
tending the "Farm" need some en
lightening to those unfamiliar with
Stanfordiana. Little, while still an
under-grad, surprised the world by
capturing both the British and the
U.S. Arpateur titles for two consecu
tive years (1934 and "35) a feat never
before accomplished or since du
plicated. An interesting sidelight
which makes this achievement all
the more impressive is that Little
I had to battle to hold his position on
the Indian team during those same
years. He played third man a good
deal of tlie time behind Vfcrne
"Spec" Stewart and Jack Hoerner.
The name Brownell not only fails i
to ring the bell in the average duf
fer's headpiece, but brings an in
quisitive shake of the noggin. And
yet it is safe to say that if the cards
had fallen right, he might have gone
on to surpass Little in fame and
ability. Certainly Brownell has done
something in his own right that no
other golfer has accomplished, in
cluding his compatriot.
November 2G, 1941 was an exceed
ingly damp, heavy, day. The sky
threatened to deluge the countryside
as it had done all week long. Nev
ertheless a large gallery congregated

to see the renowned Denny Shute,
just over the peak of his game,
which saw him capture among other
laurels the British and American
Open championships, but still one of
the big names in the golfing fratern
ity, play an exhibition. Brownell,
No. 1 man of the defending N.C.A.A.
championship Stanford linksters, was
to go along as company.
As is so often the case however,
it turned out that Shute was the
one that went along for the ride,
as Brownell, playing unquestionably
the greatest game of his life, fired
nine 3's and an equal number of 4's
for a course shattering total of 63.
The previous record was 65 set in
1938 by Art Doering, now a pro,
but then the Indian's No. 1 man.
With three holes left, Brownell
needed pars to tie Doering's record.
"Bud" sank an 8 ft. putt for a birdie
on the 16th, and continued his magic
work with the putter, by dropping
an extremely difficult curling, down
side-hill effort of some 6 ft. for a
par on the 17th, and topped it off
with a sensational 35 footer for a
birdie on the final hole. The stam
pede which headed for the likeable
Brownell, known as "Elmer" to his
friends, prevented Shute from putt
ing out his round. Commenting
later, Shute said that Brownell's
was the finest round of golf he had
ever seen played in his life, and

added that the course was also one
of the best he had ever played on.
Brownell, a Lt. J.G. in the Navy,
after leaving Stanford, served as a
Boat Officer on a troop transport
until his death resulting from a
Kamikaze attack off Lingayen gulf
during the recent conflict.
