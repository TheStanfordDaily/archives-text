# Phone Strike Settlement May Be Near
## 
### 
I WASHINGTON, April 30 (UP).—
The 24-day national telephone strike
began breaking up today, but hopes
for early, nationwide settlement*
collapsed when the American Tele
phone and Telegraph Co. again failed
to make a wage offer to its striking
long lines workers.
More than 43,000 strikers in New
York and Pennsylvania settled for
weekly pay raises of $3 to $4. The
fi,ooo Pennsylvania strikers will re
turn to work tomorrow, but New
York's 37,000 voted to respect the
picket lines of Western Electric and
long lines workers.
John Moran, long lines president,
said the union still was waiting for
j the company to make its first wage
; offer. The company is holding out
for submitting the entire wage ques
tion to arbitration.
I SAN FRANCISCO, April 30 (UP).
—Officials of the United Brother
hood of Telephone Workei's today
were considering an offer by the
Pacific Telephone and Telegraph
Company to bargain separately from
other striking unions on a cash wage
offer.
The move would j?plit the Unions
and be the first definite step toward
settlement of the strike in at least
northern California and Nevada.
An affirmative decision, according
to Federation Conciliator Omar
Hoskins, would mean opening a joint
negotiations session between the
company and union at 10 a.m. tomor
row.
The question of whether the
ÜBTW would be willing to break
away fi-om supporting the striking
National Federation of Telephone
workers arose when the PT&T
agreed to propose a cash offer to
the non-striking independent.
