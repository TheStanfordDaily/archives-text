# Bronco Uprising Humbles J.V. Nine
## 
### 
A 10-run uprising in Mie sixth in
ning turned a close ball game into a
rout as Santa rampaging
Bronco reserves swamped the In
dian J.V.'s, 13-5, yesterday after
noon on the victors' diamond.
Stanford was leading 5-3 when
the deluge descended, aided and
abetted by a comedy of Indian
errors. Starting Cardinal hurler
Claude Rosenberg, who was lifted
for Forrest Shumway in the disas
trous sixth, was charged with the
defeat.
