## The
						Stanford Standard 
### 
Everyone lives by a certain set of standards.
' Yet if asked to give an accurate definition of
these standards the average person would
encounter difficulty.
Stanford has long used the Fundamental
Standard and the Honor Code as the basis of
its "way of life."
But how many of us could sit down and tell
some one exactly what the Honor Code is?
The Constitution of the Associated Students
of Stanford University gives a two-point def
inition of the Honor Code:
1. The Honor Code is an undertaking of the
students, individually and collectively, that
they will conform to the letter and the spirit
of the Fundamental Standard, particularly in
the following respects:
(a) That they will not give nor receive
aid in examinations; that they will not give
nor receive unpermitted aid in class work, in
the preparation of reports, or in any other
work that is to be used by the instructor as
the basis of grading.
(b) That they will do their share and take
an active part in seeing to it that others as
well as themselves obey the spirit and the
letter of the Honor Code.
2. The University on its part manifests its
confidence in the honor of its students by re
fraining from proctoring examinations, or

otherwise taking special steps to prevent the
form of dishonesty mentioned above.
The Fundamental Standard of which the
Honor Code is an integral part says that "stu
dents are expected to show both within and
without the University such respect for order,
morality, personal honor, and the rights of
others as is demanded of good citizens."
The Honor Code, as a subdivision of the
Fundamental Standard, is more than just an
unwritten intangible.
It is an outline of what Stanford students
believe is the best way to run their classroom
society.—G.C.
