Pete Low, who should have graduated in '06, but
who was held up by the war, says there is no sense in
dredging up all the stories of Doodles Weaver and
other Farm characters. 01' course, he's heard them
all. But there are lots of you people who haven't, I'll
bet. Besides, I like history; and as the profs say,
history is so colorful because it's colored.
The best character story, the wildest that is, was
left out—for reasons of good taste. But it didn't fool
a Roble girl, who said the column sounded a little
tame. And it didn't fool two Branner residents, who
telephoned that THEY knew who the biggest char
acter on campus was.
Pete, can you stand one more story about pre-war
Stanford? This one is about, dogs.
Time was when dogs were abolished, banished,
verboten from the campus. It was a necessary step.
Because of the easy life on the Farm, hundreds of
hounds drifted into the area. On hot Spring days
they would gather in groups as large as 20 or 30 in
the '200' rooms in the History Corner basement.
Now that's altogether too many dogs in one spot. It
was no trick at all for one of the animals to become
irritated as someone stepped on his tail—probably
deliberately to break up the class. Soon the whole

pack would be howling in chorus. Naturally the pro
fessors couldn't compete with the noise.
And when the dogs weren't wreaking havoc in the
classrooms, they were fighting outside. And at the
first hint of a good dog fight, Roughs would pour out
of the classrooms to watch, and to cheer for "their"
dog.
And now, for Pete and the rest of the old guard
who've heard the old stories, Bull Session presents
a modern character, the frustrated bicycle rider.
We mean the girl who tries to maintain control
of her bicycle with one hand while frantically
clutching at her skirt with the other—just to hide
her "limbs" from the predatory gaze of some Stan
ford male. The same gal thinks nothing of appearing
at the Boat House or the beach with only a few
square inches of cloth covering her pelt. The argu
ment of course is, "that's different."
Still I just can't help wondering why the gals
don't adopt the French girls' sophisticated approach
to the problem. When cycling, they merely hitch up
their skirt slightly, tuck first the left side, then the
right side carefully under their, under their, uh, un
derneath them, and ride blithefully along. The effect
is something like pedal pushers or long shorts, no
fuss, no muss, very neat. Saves a lot of accidents,
too.
