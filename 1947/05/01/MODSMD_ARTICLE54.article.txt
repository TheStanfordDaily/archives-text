### DAN ENDSLEY 
Toyon Tall has a bad name among the more ideal
istic of the internationalists on campus, because it
was the center of the fight against I.S.C. There is a
certain German refugee girl now living in San Fran
cisco, however, who wouldn't agree.
She came down to the Farm a few weeks ago
to attend a track meet, and she and her girl friend
waited in the lobby of Toyon while their dates
changed clothes. Immediately she spotted the box
against the wall with the sign, "Put European Re-

lief Contributions Here."
Said she: "Will they allow just
anybody to make gifts? It would
be worth a special trip from San
Francisco. I think it's wonderful
that Stanford thinks about the
poor people overseas."
It was explained to her that the
whole idea was strictly unofficial.
Some of the fellows in Toyon got
together, decided they should do
something, then went ahead and
did it without haggling for months

over plans. This impressed the German girl even
more.
She isn't just an average refugee. Her parents
had money, and she and her sister were at school
in England when war broke out in 1939. Her fam
ily was already in bad with Hitler, and the girls
didn't hear from their parents for years.
She was 16. her sister a year older when they
were thrown on their own in an alien land. The sis

ter went into nurse's training; after only a year
she was assigned to duty in an insane asylum. That
was unpleasant, but she was luckier than the younger
girl.
The 16-year-old was in a bad spot, but she got a
job keeping house for an old lady; not much pay,
but food and a home at least. Soon, though, she was
taken away because she was near the coast. They
put her in a home for refugee children for a year.
They let her out when she managed to get a job
delivering milk. She had to get up at 3 every cold
morning, but it was a living—until her feet and hands
were severely frost-bitten. She was no quitter,
though; she got a job doing office work.
This all has a happy ending. The whole family
survived and is now united again, in San Francisco.
The girl is well enough to work now, and her sister
works too. The father—over 70 —pounds the pave
ments selling paper, and seems happy, even though he
used to own a large business.
Here's the point of all this: the girl has been
through more than most of us, and never got too much
in the way of help from others—yet she spends a
sizeable segment of her small check to help others
who are now worse off than she. She is willing to
make a special trip down here to contribute to an
unofficial drive—and she doesn't care where her
packages go—"Holland, France, Germany, any place
they need help," is the way she put it.
In the face of a story like that, those of us who
have contributed, actually, little more than words
and arguments have a right to feel ashamed of
ourselves.

was unpleasant, but she was luckier than the younger
girl.
The 16-year-old was in a bad spot, but she got a
job keeping house for an old lady; not much pay,
but food and a home at least. Soon, though, she was
taken away because she was near the coast. They
put her in a home for refugee children for a year.
They let her out when she managed to get a job
delivering milk. She had to get up at 3 every cold
morning, but it was a living—until her feet and hands
were severely frost-bitten. She was no quitter,
though; she got a job doing office work.
This all has a happy ending. The whole family
survived and is now united again, in San Francisco.
The girl is well enough to work now, and her sister
works too. The father—over 70 —pounds the pave
ments selling paper, and seems happy, even though he
used to own a large business.
Here's the point of all this: the girl has been
through more than most of us, and never got too much
in the way of help from others—yet she spends a
sizeable segment of her small check to help others
who are now worse off than she. She is willing to
make a special trip down here to contribute to an
unofficial drive—and she doesn't care where her
packages go—"Holland, France, Germany, any place
they need help," is the way she put it.
In the face of a story like that, those of us who
have contributed, actually, little more than words
and arguments have a right to feel ashamed of
ourselves.

Toyon Tall has a bad name among the more ideal
istic of the internationalists on campus, because it
was the center of the fight against I.S.C. There is a
certain German refugee girl now living in San Fran
cisco, however, who wouldn't agree.
She came down to the Farm a few weeks ago
to attend a track meet, and she and her girl friend
waited in the lobby of Toyon while their dates
changed clothes. Immediately she spotted the box
against the wall with the sign, "Put European Re-

lief Contributions Here."
Said she: "Will they allow just
anybody to make gifts? It would
be worth a special trip from San
Francisco. I think it's wonderful
that Stanford thinks about the
poor people overseas."
It was explained to her that the
whole idea was strictly unofficial.
Some of the fellows in Toyon got
together, decided they should do
something, then went ahead and
did it without haggling for months

over plans. This impressed the German girl even
more.
She isn't just an average refugee. Her parents
had money, and she and her sister were at school
in England when war broke out in 1939. Her fam
ily was already in bad with Hitler, and the girls
didn't hear from their parents for years.
She was 16. her sister a year older when they
were thrown on their own in an alien land. The sis

ter went into nurse's training; after only a year
she was assigned to duty in an insane asylum. That
was unpleasant, but she was luckier than the younger
girl.
