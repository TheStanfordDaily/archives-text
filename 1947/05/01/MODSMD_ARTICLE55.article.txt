To the Editor:
In addition to the many other "gripes" appearing
in this column, I want to add mine. It is just this;
Why can't we have our pianos in tunc?
If one is interested enough to investigate, he will
find that nearly every piano on campus available to
students, is badly in need of tuning. Sure—they get
plenty of use, the more the better. That's what
they're here for. But the piano, itself, is sadly
neglected.
Anyone knows how disagreeable a piano out of
tune can sound, both the the performer, and to the
audience. And yet, our pianos sound as though
they've been used in a beer hall, not a college cam
pus. Certainly, some who use the pianos do so harm
fully, but there are also those who learned to take

care of a piano at home. 1 believe this last group to
be in the majority.
It makes little difference to a "banger" whether the
piano is in tune, or whether the keys all play. To
anyone else using the piano, though, it makes a big
difference.
A good instrument, and all of our are, is usually
ready for tuning after about four months of use
customary in the home. Some of our pianos have not
been tuned since before last September or October.
These are the ones that receive the hardest use of all.
Many are in need of repairs.
Let s get some attention paid to this. Whoever is
responsible for the maintenance of the pianos, whether
it is a committee of students or a single person, should
make sure they're in reasonably sound condition.
