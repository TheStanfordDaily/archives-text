# Sponsor Plan Born And Dies on Farm
## 
### MAUDIE BOEHM 
One night in 1924, Dean Mary Yost, being very tired, went to bed right
after dinner. About 9, she heard the doorbell, but, determined not to be
disturbed, refused to answer it.
However, much to her amazement, she heard the front door open, steps
on the stairs, and three girls rushed right into her bedroom. They didn't

seem to notice that she had retired
for the night.
GIRLS EVOLVE PLAN
"We have a wonderful idea!" they
told her.
These three sorority girls had no
ticed the rift between Row and Ro
ble freshmen. According to Panhel
lenic, Row girls weren't able to meet
the Roble girls. The only girls who
could help the freshmen were the
"independents" who lived in Roble.
The three girls who called on Miss
Yost that night wondered if there
would be any way in which Row
girls could live in Roble for a while
—cutting off all affiliation with their
houses—and be "sponsors," as they j
put it.
The University had realized that
there was this problem, but had so
far done little about it, except to
change rushing from fall quarter to
spring quarter and finally to winter
quarter. The problem was still
there, however, and this was the
first constructive plan to be pre
sented.
WILBUR APPROVES
Dean Mary and the girls went to
see Dr. Wilbur, who gave his con
sent but said he did want the power
to veto, although, in all the years
of sponsoring, not one girl was ve
toed.
Panhellenic also agreed to let
some of its girls be released from
the hcruses to live in the freshman
hall.
There were 12 girls chosen that
year to be sponsors: six from the
Row and six independents. The
three originators of the idea were
among the six row sponsors chosen.
The girls discussed the function of
sponsoring and the qualifications
necessary.
The foremost qualification and the
most important in the minds of all
those girls was the desire to render
a service to the University—a serv
ice which could be given through
actual deeds. The girls felt that they
could only perform this service by
living with the freshmen and by
having a clear philosophy of the
possibilities and limitations entailed.
There could be no cross purposes;
the girls had to work with the ad
ministration in the hall.
This program was, at first, diffi
cult for all to accept. The inde
pendents had always been swamped
by the freshmen, so had just gone
their own ways and ignored them;
therefore, the independent sponsors
had to change their attitudes.
Until the war there was a fine
sponsor institute. There were al
ways at least five meetings stressing

the different aspects and aims of
sponsoring, with discussion carried
on by the outgoing and incoming
sponsors. And during the summer,
each sponsor was sent all the liter
ature which was sent to the fresh
j men, including advance copies of
j the Frosh Bible which these spon
' sors all but memorized.
These girls refused to be paid.
1 They didn't want their room and
j board. They were merely members
of the Roble community,, but with
I a keener concern for it.
SELECTION BASE WIDENS
At first the sponsors were chosen
through the recommendations of the
Roble dii'ector, the sorority house
mothers, and the outgoing sponsors.
The girls thought they would feel
the responsibility more if they were
directly responsible to Conference
instead of to Dr. Wilbur.
After a time, they felt that a
broader base was needed for choos
ing the sponsors. Therefore, the !
sponsor - choosing committee was
composed of presidents of Confer- !
ence and Council, vice-president of I
the student body, and the outgoing
senior sponsors.
The most important thing to re- j
member about sponsoring is that
Stanford women started it them
selves and carried it out to a well
organized and honored tradition.

"We have a wonderful idea!" they
told her.
These three sorority girls had no
ticed the rift between Row and Ro
ble freshmen. According to Panhel
lenic, Row girls weren't able to meet
the Roble girls. The only girls who
could help the freshmen were the
"independents" who lived in Roble.
The three girls who called on Miss
Yost that night wondered if there
would be any way in which Row
girls could live in Roble for a while
—cutting off all affiliation with their
houses—and be "sponsors," as they j
put it.
The University had realized that
there was this problem, but had so
far done little about it, except to
change rushing from fall quarter to
spring quarter and finally to winter
quarter. The problem was still
there, however, and this was the
first constructive plan to be pre
sented.
WILBUR APPROVES
Dean Mary and the girls went to
see Dr. Wilbur, who gave his con
sent but said he did want the power
to veto, although, in all the years
of sponsoring, not one girl was ve
toed.
Panhellenic also agreed to let
some of its girls be released from
the hcruses to live in the freshman
hall.
There were 12 girls chosen that
year to be sponsors: six from the
Row and six independents. The
three originators of the idea were
among the six row sponsors chosen.
The girls discussed the function of
sponsoring and the qualifications
necessary.
The foremost qualification and the
most important in the minds of all
those girls was the desire to render
a service to the University—a serv
ice which could be given through
actual deeds. The girls felt that they
could only perform this service by
living with the freshmen and by
having a clear philosophy of the
possibilities and limitations entailed.
There could be no cross purposes;
the girls had to work with the ad
ministration in the hall.
This program was, at first, diffi
cult for all to accept. The inde
pendents had always been swamped
by the freshmen, so had just gone
their own ways and ignored them;
therefore, the independent sponsors
had to change their attitudes.
Until the war there was a fine
sponsor institute. There were al
ways at least five meetings stressing

the different aspects and aims of
sponsoring, with discussion carried
on by the outgoing and incoming
sponsors. And during the summer,
each sponsor was sent all the liter
ature which was sent to the fresh
j men, including advance copies of
j the Frosh Bible which these spon
' sors all but memorized.
These girls refused to be paid.
1 They didn't want their room and
j board. They were merely members
of the Roble community,, but with
I a keener concern for it.
SELECTION BASE WIDENS
At first the sponsors were chosen
through the recommendations of the
Roble dii'ector, the sorority house
mothers, and the outgoing sponsors.
The girls thought they would feel
the responsibility more if they were
directly responsible to Conference
instead of to Dr. Wilbur.
After a time, they felt that a
broader base was needed for choos
ing the sponsors. Therefore, the !
sponsor - choosing committee was
composed of presidents of Confer- !
ence and Council, vice-president of I
the student body, and the outgoing
senior sponsors.
The most important thing to re- j
member about sponsoring is that
Stanford women started it them
selves and carried it out to a well
organized and honored tradition.
