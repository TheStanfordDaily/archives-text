# 'Adding Machine' Called Powerful
## 
### 
Elmer Rice's "The Adding Ma
chine," the most unusual and most
powerful play given by the Stan
ford Players this season, opened its
four night run last night at 8:15
p.m. in the Little Theatre, before a
capacity crowd.
An excellent portrayal of Zero,
the average workingman who is con
fused by environment and unable to
fight against it, was turned in by Hal
Todd. Pauline SchafTer, as Mrs.
Zero, was also very good in her
realistic portrayal of a nagging old
woman, ruled by the movies. The
role of Daisy Deforc was well played
by Ruth Fisher, as were the parts
of Lt. Charles by WAlkcr Vaughan,
and Shrdlu by William Melton.
Scene II of the play was rather
weak, but. the remainder, of the
scenes were moving and held the
audience's attention very well.
Scene 111, of the Zeros' party, pro
vided just the right amount of
comedy necessary in a serious
drama.
The sets of the play were excel
lently done, particularly the Elysian
Field background and the huge add
ing machine, and showed that a lot
of work had been put in on them.
Chuck Ingraham directed the
play and Harrison McCrcath was
in charge of settings and costumes.
