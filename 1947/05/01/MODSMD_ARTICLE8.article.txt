# Barahal Says Vets' Checks To Arrive Soon
## 
### 
Only 18,000 of the 60,000 veterans
in training within the jurisdiction
of the San Francisco VA Regional
Office will be affected by the delay
in subsistence checks, according to
George D. Barahal, Stanford Vet
erans' Co-ordinator.
WHICH 16,000?
But, he said, no one knows who
these 16,000 will be.
"This is a temporary thing," Mr.
Barahal stated. "There is no serious
cause for alarm."
However, he urged any hardship
case needing a loan to see Mr. Shel
ton L. Beatty, chief counselor for
men. Dean John Stalnaker an
nounced Tuesday that "the Univer
sity will do its best to help the af
fected veterans."
Mr. Barahal said that the San
Francisco office had informed him
that the checks were made out and
will be mailed as soon as funds ar
rive.
DEFICIENCY IN FUNDS
The confusion relating to sub
sistence checks results from a de
ficiency in the operating funds of
the regional office. Congress has
not yet completed action on the de
ficiency appropriation now before it.
SACRAMENTO. April 30 (UP).—
Governor Warren today signed a
bill to appropriate $9,256,360.30 for
emergency payment of benefits for
May and June to California's needy
aged, blind, and children.
The appropriation becamc neces
sary if the state's needy were to be
cared for when Congress delayed
passage of a deficiency appropria
tion.
The bill, introduced by Sen. H. E.
Dillinger, provides that the state's
general fund be reimbursed when
federal funds become available.
This bill will not apply to veterans
going to school under the G.I. bill.
