# NSO Program Still Delayed
## 
### 
Activities of the National Students
Organization at Stanford arc pro
ceeding slowly since they arc still in
(he process of organization, accord
ing to Ned Fleming, co-chairman.
"Although the group is working
on a great number of campus prob
lems, results are still in the nebu
lous stage," Fleming said. "Anyway,
we can't work too fast on what we !
have planned because the campus
is tired of polls and won't co- i
operate."
MEMBER JUMPS Gl'N
Fleming referred to the recent
poll that was recalled when he told
Excom last night that "unauthor
ized information had been released
by a member without N.S.O. sanc
tion."
"We were off base," he said.
Joyce Kleger, Committee chair
man, said that N.S.O.'s social report
will probably not be ready until the
end of the quarter because, "much
work still needs to be done." But
Mildred Edwards, vice-president of
the ASSU told Excom last night that
she should have a complete report
within two weeks.
LEADERSHIP IS PROBLEM
N.S.O. investigation of the campus
leadership problem is still in its pre
liminary stages, according to Miss
Kleger.
"We want to contact other univer- j
sities and find how they arc solving
their problems so that we can pre
sent a well-rounded view to Excom,"
Miss Kleger said. "And correspon
dence takes time."
Meanwhile, Betty Davies, Presi
dent of Women's Conference, said
that a leadership plan submitted by
Sally Woodard would probably be
tried this quarter, and that "N.S.O.'s
inclusive report would be considered
at a later date."
