"We're all set to present to the
Farm tonight the greatest Soph
Carnival of all time," says Hap
Black, co-chairman with Bob Lec
feldt of the Con Home fun-fest.
DECORA TIONS COMPLETE!)
This afternoon the committee and
the helpers from the living groups
will finish up the 40 concession
booths in the Pavilion and complete
the decorations. Carnival hours are
7:30 to 12 tonight.
"With each booth trying to raise
the most money for the Con Home
tonight." says Leefeldt, "tremendous
gamos and stunts have been
dreamed up and novel prizes are
being offered."
'SPLATTER A PLATTER'
"Splatter a platter," the Alpha
Kappa Lambdas call their record
ing-breaking game. The A.T.O.'s
will test the carnival - goer's aim
with a slingshot, running competi

tion with the Delts' shooting gal
lery. A typical carnival game, the
nenny pitch, is being set up by the
Kappa Alphas.
Lagunita is establishing an ar
tists' colony and the women at Du
rand offer to draw caricatures.
FOOD. DANCING ON BILL
No carnival is complete without
hot dogs, punch, ice crcam, and
candied apples, and all these will be
in abundance, according to the com
mittee. Music and dancing, com
plete with Roble taxi dancers, is
another feature of the night's enter
tainment.
"I'm not sure about a roller
coaster," admits Black, "but we
have everything else, and more,
that a carnival has to offer." Buy
gardenias, send telegrams, bowl,
throw rotten eggs, waterbag, shoot
water pistols, or record your voiceâ€”

-dl for the benefit of the Con Home
children, he added.

Leefeldt reminds all groups
that:
1. Booths must be built and
completely decoratcd by 5 p.m.
2. Originality is desired in the
decorations.
3. Those staffing the booths
must be there by 7 p.m.
4. Each house will tear down
its own booth and clean up after
the Carnival.

Admission is free to the Carnival,
which is the traditional climax to
the Con Home Drive. "The Carni
val usually makes the most money
for the whole drive," says Lecfeldt.
"The committee hopes that every
one will turn out for a good time
and make this contribution to the
Convalescent Home a big success."
