the Con Home Drive until you have
gone to the 'Charity Hop' tomor
row night," says Tom Williamson,
publicity chairman of the traditional
climax of the drive.
The price of $1.90 is reasonable,
and if the dance is a sell-out even
with the limited number of bids
available, students can enjoy them
selves and still contribute to a wor
thy charity, he continued.

will provide the music that will be
broadcast over KSU and piped to
