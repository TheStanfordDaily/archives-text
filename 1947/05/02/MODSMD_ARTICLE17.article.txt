# Campus Drive Returns Fall Below Expectations

### 
"A successful Con Ilome Drive depends upon (lie .support of every
student in (lie University." Hob Coate, drive chairman, said last night as
on-campus collections fell far hclow expectation.
"We are not asking students to contribute any specific amount,"' he
stated. "If each student would give something, no matter how little,
the drive would go over the top."
Coate recalled the history of the Convalescent home, founded on the
campus for needy Hay Area children. '"Because Stanford i>> the only
university with a charitable institution on its campus, the students
should feci that il is their responsibility," Coate said.
In past years, Stanford has supported four beds a year through its
drive. Although the campus activities during Con Week such as Labor
Day and the Strawberry Brunch supply a great portion of the receipts,
the on-campus contributions are the nucleus of the whole drive, accord
ing to Coate.
"The ofi-campus contributions are way ahead of the on-campus
drive," Coate remarked. "With fill! student support in this last day of
the drive, we can chalk up the 1!(17 Convalescent: Home Drive as one
of the most successful on record."
