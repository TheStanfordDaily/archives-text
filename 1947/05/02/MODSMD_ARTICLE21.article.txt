# Rent Controls Go to Senate
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. May 1 (UP).
The Hon; o tonight passed and sent
to the Senate a bill which continues
federal rent controls at least until
Dec. 31, but gives state, county and
city governments power to end con
trols whenever they find that a
housing emergency no longer exi; Is
in their communities.
Previously the House had voted
tentatively to send the bill back to
the Banking Committee, which
would have virtually killed the
measure. However, the decision was
reversed by a roll-call .vote of l!) 7
to 18!) late last night.
As approved by the House Bank
ing Committee, the legislation
would extend rent ceilings at least
until Dec. 31, and give President
Truman, power to extend them an
additional three months. It would
abolish the office of housing expe
diter and transfer rent controls to a
permanent agency selected by Mr.
Truman.
