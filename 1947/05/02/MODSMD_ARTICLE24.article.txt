## 
### 
The National Students' Organiza
tion hopes to conduct its next poll
in conjunction with the Stanford
Psychology Department, according
to Marilyn Sidwell, N.S.O. chair
man.
The poll will probe student feel
ing and suggestions about the sag
ging Farm social program. Guyla
Runyan, vice-president-elect of the
student body, is heading the over
all N.S.O. investigation into this
problem.
N.S.O. decided at last night's cen
tral committee meeting to aid its
sister group at U.S.C. in re-estab
lishing allegedly abridged student
rights at that school.
"We will compile information
about our student government at
Stanford so that a goal can be pro
vided for student action at Southern
California," Miss Sidwell said. "I
think we can help them greatly."
Reports from the southern cam
pus indicate that student govern
ment there "is a farce . . . the ad
ministration can veto everything the
student senate plans."
On the local scene, the N.S.O. will
continue work on the hashing prob
lem. A new angle has been pro
posed to the group: that needy stu
dents be allowed first opportunity
for hashing jobs in the future.
"We will evaluate the worth of
the proposal and present our recom
mendation as soon as possible," Miss
Sidwell said.
Nation-wide student co-operation
with (he N.S.O.'s investigation into
campus leadership is expected, Miss
Sidwell said. Reports from other
schools will provide aid in the for
mulation of a concrete program to
improve student leadership here.
N.S.O. will ask the approval of
Excom next week on a proposed in
vestigation into wages for student
library workers. Reports have
reached the group that students arc
being underpaid.
