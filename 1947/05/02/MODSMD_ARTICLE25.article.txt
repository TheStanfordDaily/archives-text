# Tunnel Safari Admits Failure
## 
### WELLS KEDDIE 
SOMEWHERE UNDER THE
QUAD (Special to the Daily).—The
solution to the lockout problem in
the women's residences is no nearer
today.
This is the report made by Lafe
Moxon, Stanford Rough, today.
Moxon has been leading an expedi
tion in search of a direct route, via
steam-pipe tunnel, to Union, Roble,
and I*jgunita halls.
The search has been made in the
interest ol' science and spring, Mox
ot) declared.
It was a hopeless quest.
Moxon's expedition traced (lie
network of steam - pipe - carrying
tunnels from its inception at Encina
Hall, around the Quad, up to the
north-south tunnel that runs under
the hydraulic laboratory, Schools ol
Engineering and Metallurgy, and
over toward the women's swimming
pool.
The lead toward the swimming
pool proved false.
All Moxon has found so far i;> one
steamfitter, wrapping a pip" with
asbestos.
DEFEAT ADMITTED
Leader Moxon, yetting up quickly
from an unwrapped steam - pipe,
said: "We must admit defeat. Evi
dence gathered on this trip proves
conclusively that the only under
ground access to the women' resi
dences is via the steampipe itself.
It's not worth the try."
The expedition is attempting to
r< liace its steps to the nearest man
hole exit.
Moxon formed the expedition
after becoming intrigued with the
method used by the steam plant for
producing and distributing steam
heat.
"After looking at the boilers and
realizing how much man's scientific
knowledge has contributed to mod
ern society, I became interested in
just how all this steam was deliv
ered,"he said. "When I discovered
that a network of tunnels existed,
my curiosity was resolved in ac
tion."
SCIENTIFIC DATA INTRIGUE
Moxon warmed to his subject.
"Foreman Frank Thommen told me
that the boilers are capable of pro
ducing 2,000 horsepower," he said.
"During cold spells, the fires that
heat the water consume from 7,000
to 8,000 gallons of oil daily, from a
65,000 - gallon tank located behind
th«- plant.
"Moderate weather brings both a
decrease in consumption and a
change of fuel. Natural gas, unavail
able because of heavy demand dur
ing cold snaps, is burned, with three
hogshead-sized gas meters busily
recording the boilers' appetites,"
Moxon elaborated.
Further proof of his purely scien
tific interest was offered by Moxon
when he revealed that he had taken
the trouble to learn that 90 per cent
of tlie water used to make the steam
was salvaged and re-used.
FIRE- M AKINC i IN VESTIG A TED
"Incidentally," lie added, "the
fires are lighted with long-handled
blow torches." (He named the

source for this last information as
Fireman Fred Thorn.)
Because of all this technical and
scientific knowledge in action, Mox
on declared, the scientific spirit cap
tured his imagin;ition. The expedi

tion below the Quad was the natural
result, he claims.
"Besides," he said, "it's spring."
The expedition is expected to sur
face- in time for Commencement ex
ercises.

QUAD (Special to the Daily).—The
solution to the lockout problem in
the women's residences is no nearer
today.
This is the report made by Lafe
Moxon, Stanford Rough, today.
Moxon has been leading an expedi
tion in search of a direct route, via
steam-pipe tunnel, to Union, Roble,
and I*jgunita halls.
The search has been made in the
interest ol' science and spring, Mox
ot) declared.
It was a hopeless quest.
Moxon's expedition traced (lie
network of steam - pipe - carrying
tunnels from its inception at Encina
Hall, around the Quad, up to the
north-south tunnel that runs under
the hydraulic laboratory, Schools ol
Engineering and Metallurgy, and
over toward the women's swimming
pool.
The lead toward the swimming
pool proved false.
All Moxon has found so far i;> one
steamfitter, wrapping a pip" with
asbestos.
DEFEAT ADMITTED
Leader Moxon, yetting up quickly
from an unwrapped steam - pipe,
said: "We must admit defeat. Evi
dence gathered on this trip proves
conclusively that the only under
ground access to the women' resi
dences is via the steampipe itself.
It's not worth the try."
The expedition is attempting to
r< liace its steps to the nearest man
hole exit.
Moxon formed the expedition
after becoming intrigued with the
method used by the steam plant for
producing and distributing steam
heat.
"After looking at the boilers and
realizing how much man's scientific
knowledge has contributed to mod
ern society, I became interested in
just how all this steam was deliv
ered,"he said. "When I discovered
that a network of tunnels existed,
my curiosity was resolved in ac
tion."
SCIENTIFIC DATA INTRIGUE
Moxon warmed to his subject.
"Foreman Frank Thommen told me
that the boilers are capable of pro
ducing 2,000 horsepower," he said.
"During cold spells, the fires that
heat the water consume from 7,000
to 8,000 gallons of oil daily, from a
65,000 - gallon tank located behind
th«- plant.
"Moderate weather brings both a
decrease in consumption and a
change of fuel. Natural gas, unavail
able because of heavy demand dur
ing cold snaps, is burned, with three
hogshead-sized gas meters busily
recording the boilers' appetites,"
Moxon elaborated.
Further proof of his purely scien
tific interest was offered by Moxon
when he revealed that he had taken
the trouble to learn that 90 per cent
of tlie water used to make the steam
was salvaged and re-used.
FIRE- M AKINC i IN VESTIG A TED
"Incidentally," lie added, "the
fires are lighted with long-handled
blow torches." (He named the

source for this last information as
Fireman Fred Thorn.)
Because of all this technical and
scientific knowledge in action, Mox
on declared, the scientific spirit cap
tured his imagin;ition. The expedi

tion below the Quad was the natural
result, he claims.
"Besides," he said, "it's spring."
The expedition is expected to sur
face- in time for Commencement ex
ercises.
