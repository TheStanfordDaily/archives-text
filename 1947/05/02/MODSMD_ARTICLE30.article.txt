# Track Team Seeks Upset Over Bruins in L.A. Meet
## 
### JOHN HUBBARD 
Twenty-eight selected Stanford track and field Indians will
leave the reservation today on the noon train, bound for Los
Angeles and tomorrow's meet with UCLA.
The Bruin clash will be the first road appearance of the year
for Stanford, and Coach Jack Weiershauser's pupils hope to

celebrate the occasion by putting
an end to their three-meet losing
streak.
But if the Indians do pull an up
set they will have to do it the hard
way against the dope sheets of the
track "experts" and against a
stronger all-around team than they
can field. Stanford is rated any
where from a 10 to a 20 point un
derdog.
KItUINS OUTLUCKED CAE
Victory, however, is at least pos
sible, if not probable. UCLA is def
initely not one of the strongest
teams on the coast. A few weeks
ago the Westwood aggregation
knocked over California, 73 to 58,
but the win was due to a freak
occurrence which ruined Cal's
chances.
The Bears had been generally
conceded a clean sweep for all three
positions in the 100-yd. dash, but
their fastest trio of sprinters were
disqualified for jumping the gun
too many times. If they had been
allowed to run, Cal would have
added nine crucial points and eked
out a Gti-65 victory.
CAN TIIE INDIANS WIN?
All of which is to say that the
Bruins "can be had." Whether Stan
lord will be trained fine enough or
pitched high enough to "have" them
is another question.
The Indians can fairly safely count
on victories in the 100, 220, and 440.
Terry Maxwell should be able to
score a double win in the two shorter
races and Larry Hoff seems to be
the logical candidate in the 440.
Besides those point-winning per
lormances Weiershauser's men are
doped to collect enough second and

third place markers to swell their
j total to 00 points, give or take a
few.
UPSETS REQUIRED
That won't be enough to win the
meet, so Stanford—to win—must pull
off a few surprises:
The most dangerous Indian dark
horses are Captain A 1 Snyder, half
miler Georges Grimes, and miler
Frank Ganahl. None of them are
tabbed to win their events, but at
least one, or possibly all three, are
capable of springing upsets.
SNYDER-DIXON DUEL
Snyder will have to beat off
UCLA's ace hurdler, Craig Dixon.
Dixon holds a decided edge in the
low hurdles, but Stanford's captain
has a good chance to break the
tape in the highs.
Grimes and Ganahl are scheduled
to compete with Ralph Gold, of the
Bruins. Gold is a 4:21 miler and a
1:54.2 half-miler, but if the day
is hot he may confine himself to
one of the two races. In that case,
Stanford's entry in the race Gold
doesn't run will be an almost cer
tain winner.
GANAIIL, GRIMES MAY WIN
Even if Gold does run both events,
Ganahl and Grimes cannot be counted
out of the running. Ganahl has
come very close to 4:21, and Grimes
is just a shade off Gold's time in the
880.

off a few surprises:
The most dangerous Indian dark
horses are Captain A 1 Snyder, half
miler Georges Grimes, and miler
Frank Ganahl. None of them are
tabbed to win their events, but at
least one, or possibly all three, are
capable of springing upsets.
SNYDER-DIXON DUEL
Snyder will have to beat off
UCLA's ace hurdler, Craig Dixon.
Dixon holds a decided edge in the
low hurdles, but Stanford's captain
has a good chance to break the
tape in the highs.
Grimes and Ganahl are scheduled
to compete with Ralph Gold, of the
Bruins. Gold is a 4:21 miler and a
1:54.2 half-miler, but if the day
is hot he may confine himself to
one of the two races. In that case,
Stanford's entry in the race Gold
doesn't run will be an almost cer
tain winner.
GANAIIL, GRIMES MAY WIN
Even if Gold does run both events,
Ganahl and Grimes cannot be counted
out of the running. Ganahl has
come very close to 4:21, and Grimes
is just a shade off Gold's time in the
880.
Count the "ifs" and "buts" in this
article, and you have the picture.
Stanford can win. In order to ac
complish that objective, though, the
locals will have to take advantage
of every one of those "ifs" and
"buts." And that is no easy assign
ment.
Twenty-eight selected Stanford track and field Indians will
leave the reservation today on the noon train, bound for Los
Angeles and tomorrow's meet with UCLA.
The Bruin clash will be the first road appearance of the year
for Stanford, and Coach Jack Weiershauser's pupils hope to

celebrate the occasion by putting
an end to their three-meet losing
streak.
But if the Indians do pull an up
set they will have to do it the hard
way against the dope sheets of the
track "experts" and against a
stronger all-around team than they
can field. Stanford is rated any
where from a 10 to a 20 point un
derdog.
KItUINS OUTLUCKED CAE
Victory, however, is at least pos
sible, if not probable. UCLA is def
initely not one of the strongest
teams on the coast. A few weeks
ago the Westwood aggregation
knocked over California, 73 to 58,
but the win was due to a freak
occurrence which ruined Cal's
chances.
The Bears had been generally
conceded a clean sweep for all three
positions in the 100-yd. dash, but
their fastest trio of sprinters were
disqualified for jumping the gun
too many times. If they had been
allowed to run, Cal would have
added nine crucial points and eked
out a Gti-65 victory.
CAN TIIE INDIANS WIN?
All of which is to say that the
Bruins "can be had." Whether Stan
lord will be trained fine enough or
pitched high enough to "have" them
is another question.
The Indians can fairly safely count
on victories in the 100, 220, and 440.
Terry Maxwell should be able to
score a double win in the two shorter
races and Larry Hoff seems to be
the logical candidate in the 440.
Besides those point-winning per
lormances Weiershauser's men are
doped to collect enough second and

third place markers to swell their
j total to 00 points, give or take a
few.
