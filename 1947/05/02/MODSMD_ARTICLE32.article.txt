# Card Netters Meet Cal Tomorrow At Berkeley
## 
### BOB BULLOCK 
Big Game fever, tennis variety, grips the California campus
tomorrow afternoon as Stanford invades the Bear lair in search
of its first conference win. Action between the two evenly
matched teams is slated for a 1:30 p.m. getaway.
The Indians enter the Cal crucial match with a slight edge

'according to comparative scores.
Against powerful College of Pacific,
Stanford fared better than the Bears.
The Indians were edged out, 5-4,
while the C.O.P. wonders waxed
Cal. 6-3.
IT'LL BE CLOSE
Such a slim one game margin
won't be of much use tomorrow, as
the Bears will naturally be "high"'
for a win over the locals. Both teams
have yet to clip off a conference
win, so the outcome should be bit
terly contested.
Last week's rest was a welcome
one for the harassed Indians who
took on a double barrel of trouble
two weeks ago. They tried to
trade blows with U.S.C. and C.0.P.,
hot shots of the Coast, on successive
days. The resulting double dunking
cooled off the Indians, who will be
after a measure of face-saving to
morrow.
LEWIS LEADS CARDS
Bob Lewis leads the locals at the
number one slot, a position he took
over as a result of a challenge match
win over Ted Myers before the Tro
jan invasion. Myers takes second
seeding for the Bear struggle.
Coach Elwyn Buggc has shaken
up his lineup as a result of other
challenge matches. Sixth position
falls to Lucien Barbour, who also
plays first singles on the J.V s. He
defeated Ross Hughes to take over
the Varsity rung.
