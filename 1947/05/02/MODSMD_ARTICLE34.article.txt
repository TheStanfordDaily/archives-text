they tee-off in their scheduled en
counter with Cal's Golden Bears at
Berkeley.

charges are determined to enter the
win column again, after dropping

record of two wins and two losses
so far this season, also tasted defeat
at the hands of the San Jose State
divot diggers. However, the boys

lately, as demonstrated by two con
secutive wins, and might provide a
lot of competition this Saturday.

orites, as they take to the links to
