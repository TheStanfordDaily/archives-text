# Woltermen Skittle Uclans Tomorrow
## 
### LYNN CARMAN 
Coach Harry Wolter's Indians are
looking for their ninth win in their
last ten starts—and a secure hold on
third place in the Coast Intercolle
giate Baseball Association —when
they play host to U.C.L.A.'s travel
ing Bruins tomorrow afternoon on
the Sunken Diamond at 3:15.
Yesterday they added win num
ber eight to their fast-glowing list
when they polished off a visiting
San Francisco Junior - College nine
by an 8 to 4 count.
It's been a long, tough, upward
climb to third place for the Wolter
men, who dropped three out of their
first four loop games, and tomorrow
they'll be up against the team that
they've been battling for third place
all season long.
Right now, the Indians' .444 win
ning percentage, on four wins and
five losses, puts them just a shade
ahead of the Uclans, who have com
piled a .429 average with a three
and-four loop record.
The Indians gained possession of
third place last Wednesday when
they dropped St. Mary's, 4 to 0, to
climb over the idle Bruins. But
then the Indians will have to win
tomorrow if they're to keep their
grip on their upper-division berth.
Lefty Dave Dahle, who mowed

down U.S.C.'s Trojans after a shaky ,
beginning last Saturday, will be out
on the slab tomorrow as he seeks to j
chalk up his third league victory in
four starts.
Ward Walkup has been tagged by
Wolt«r to handle Dahle's hurling in
the battle for third place.
The invading Bruins will prob- I
ably unload their ace moundsman, j
Jim Daniel, on the Indians tomor- J
row, for the speedy South lander has j
been pacing their mounds corps all !
spring. If Daniel doesn't start, Bob
Seltzer may be the pitcher the In
dians will have to contend with.
The Bruins are bringing with
them a couple of the top C.1.8.A. ,
sluggers in the persons of third 1

baseman Doug Sale and captain
shortstop Lou Briganti. Sale is gal
loping along at a .375 clip, whereas
Briganti boasts a hefty .440 mark.
Johnny Stanich, the dead-eye
Bruin cage ace, is a regular on the
diamond squad and leads ofT when
he isn't playing center field. Cal
Rossi is another familiar name to
Coast sports fans—he holds down
the left field slot.
For a while, Bruin coach Art
Reichle had trouble digging up a
capable received for his pitchers,
but he finally came across Hal
Hundley has been a reg
ular ever since.
As for the Indian lineup, it'll be
the same as it's been all through

| their win campaign. In other words,
the batting order will read like this:
Bill Arc?, 3b; George Sloat, If; Buck
! Brownson, ss; Lloyd Merriman, cf;
j Walkup, c; Ted Nell, l'f; Bob Pe
ters. 2b; and Benny Cardinalli, lb.
In yesterday's game, winning
pitcher Dick Flatland allowed San
Francisco J.C. six hits in the .six
j innings he pitched, and then Char
lie Wakefield took over and limited
\ the visitors to just two hits during
the last three frames.
| A 1 Kircher knocked in two runs
j with a single and a double in three
trips to tihe plate to share hitting
honors with Buck Brownson, who
I also hit a single and a double in five
' at-bats.

Coach Harry Wolter's Indians are
looking for their ninth win in their
last ten starts—and a secure hold on
third place in the Coast Intercolle
giate Baseball Association —when
they play host to U.C.L.A.'s travel
ing Bruins tomorrow afternoon on
the Sunken Diamond at 3:15.
Yesterday they added win num
ber eight to their fast-glowing list
when they polished off a visiting
San Francisco Junior - College nine
by an 8 to 4 count.
It's been a long, tough, upward
climb to third place for the Wolter
men, who dropped three out of their
first four loop games, and tomorrow
they'll be up against the team that
they've been battling for third place
all season long.
Right now, the Indians' .444 win
ning percentage, on four wins and
five losses, puts them just a shade
ahead of the Uclans, who have com
piled a .429 average with a three
and-four loop record.
The Indians gained possession of
third place last Wednesday when
they dropped St. Mary's, 4 to 0, to
climb over the idle Bruins. But
then the Indians will have to win
tomorrow if they're to keep their
grip on their upper-division berth.
Lefty Dave Dahle, who mowed

down U.S.C.'s Trojans after a shaky ,
beginning last Saturday, will be out
on the slab tomorrow as he seeks to j

the battle for third place.

The Bruins are bringing with
them a couple of the top C.1.8.A. ,
sluggers in the persons of third 1

baseman Doug Sale and captain
shortstop Lou Briganti. Sale is gal
loping along at a .375 clip, whereas
Briganti boasts a hefty .440 mark.
Johnny Stanich, the dead-eye
Bruin cage ace, is a regular on the
diamond squad and leads ofT when
he isn't playing center field. Cal
Rossi is another familiar name to
Coast sports fans—he holds down
the left field slot.
