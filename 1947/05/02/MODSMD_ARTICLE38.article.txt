# BULL SESSION
## 
### DAN ENDSLEY 
The white flag is flying from the Daily shack.
Call off your hounds, Chappie, let's call a peace
conference. I am willing to bandy words from here
to yonder, but reading a telegram every few min
utes gets monotonous.
Yes, we've been getting telegrams over here;
so many, in fact, that Western Union will no doubt
soon declare its biggest dividend in years. If the Old
Boy's telegraphic campaign had come a couple of
weeks ago, the State Public Utilities Commission
would have found it unnecessary to give Western

Union a rate increase.
These mechanized messages of
love we've been snowed under with
purport to come from people all
ovfcr the world, but our Mr. Rich-j
ard Keusink did a little private*
eye work and found they were alls
filed in Palo Alto. I find it hard to
believe that such important per
sonages would have traveled all
the way to our little" town to file,,
a telegram, so 1 assume that the
whole conspiracy was conceived

in the secret councils of Chaparral's editorial
hierarchy.
But maybe if I let you look at some of the wires
you can decide for yourself:
Editor Stanford Daily—
Stanford Chaparral is the hottest thing at the
South Pole stop
Admiral Byrd.
Editor Stanford Daily—
Arriving Thursday to punch Dan Endsley in
the stop
Frank Sinatra.

Editor Stanford Daily—
The United Mine Workers are solidly behind The
Daily in its fight to eliminate Chappie stop Loquats
to Dan Endsley stop contribution follows stop
John L. Lewis
Monsieur L'Editcur Stanford Daily—
J'aecuse Dan Endsley stop Le Chaparral est
vraiment fou ct vraiment bon stop Quelle fromagc
stop
Jean Sablon
Editor Stanford Daily—
Tovarich your campaign to purge college humor
in America has the full approval of the party stop
Joe Stalin
P.S. Order of the Red Star follows.

This all goes to prove the point I've been, in my
floundering way, trying to put across: viz., that (1)
There is a need for a good humor magazine on cam
pus (no pun intended), and (2) It is possible to have
one.
Although I have been made the butt of a very
good gag, it doesn't bother me; I'm just happy that
Chappie presented to Bull Session—without charge—
the best idea it has evolved from its collective mind
since the Yellow Journalism issue of a year ago.
Thanks, boys—I'll try not to do the same for you
some day.

This being my last ration of Bull—at least for
awhile—I'd like to say that I don't believe in tearing
anyone down just for the heck of it. Whenever I've
criticised, it's been because I thought improvement
was both desirable AND possible. If anybody's
feelings have been hurt, don't take it to heart.
