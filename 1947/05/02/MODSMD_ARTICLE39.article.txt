This session of Congress has seen some examples
of whole-hearted bi-partisan cooperation, but it has
also seen some sorry examples of partisan non-co
operation. Naturally, some of this is to be expected
in any system that makes use of organized political
parties, but I do not think that it is too much to
expect of even our Senator Claghorns that they will
remember that there are limits even to the exercise
of the sacred rights of partisanship. That is to say,
there are, I would say, occasions when considera
tions of party might decently be laid aside in the
interests of tlie whole country. To reinstate Herbert
Hoover as the genius loci of what was for some years
known as Boulder Dam is innocent Republican sport,
perhaps. To solemnly enact an anti-third term
amendment, to hold up appointments of Democratic
judges and postmasters may be just good, clean, par
tisan fun. But there are limits to this sort of thing
and I suggest that the majority in Congress, my Re
publican friends, are coming rather close to them.
Granted, that John Q. Citizen and John Q. Con
gressman may have some legitimate difficulty in dis
tinguishing the points at which partisanship should
give way to citizenship. The political affiliations of
most of our voters are dictated by inherited preju
dice, and reason and prejudice are usually mutually

exclusive. So the confusion of party and national
interests can be effected with the best intentions in
the world.
Yesterday's paper headlined a story 011 the House's
revision of the Administration-sponsored foreign
relief bill, intended to fill, in some measure, the gap
left by the termination of the UNRRA program. Not
only did the House of Representatives chop $150
million out of the appropriation, but they ran rough
shod over such recommendations as that the State
Department administer the program and that the
Administration be free to designate the countries
eligible for relief. And added a few more restrictions
in favor of freedom of the press and American super
vision of distribution in "Communist-dominated"
countries. And tossed in a few more slaps at the
Communists for good measure, I guess.
Now I do not say that these revisions were made
in a narrow, partisan spirit. Taken all together,
they might be read as an application of a consistent
American foreign policy, in line with the program
of aid to Greece and Turkey. But they can be read
otherwise, too. If the House re-wrote this bill in
the captious party spirit that might be read into it,
they are coming close, to close for comfort, to the
limits of the proper scope of political opposition.
